In the early to mid-1970s, standard LV aneurysmectomy was performed for patients with preoperative VT episodes in the setting of prior infarction. Unfortunately, the operative mortality rates were high and VT recurrences were frequent [10] . Endocardial encircling ventriculotomy, introduced by Guiraudon et al. [11] , was designed to isolate the arrhythmogenic tissue from the remainder of the ventricle by creating a nearly transmural incision through the edge of the border zone, sparing only the epicardium. This operation was associated with marked postoperative LV dysfunction, likely due to interference with coronary arterial blood supply. Guiraudon et al. [12] also attempted to disarticulate the right ventricular (RV) free wall from the rest of the ventricles in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Although the surgery was successful in isolating the arrhythmogenic RV free wall and in producing interesting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of sinus rhythm simultaneous with persistent sustained VT in the same patient, most patients ultimately did poorly because of progressive RV failure. In the late 1970s, Josephson et al. [13] developed the technique of mapguided subendocardial resection. This procedure was based on the observation that diastolic or presystolic electrical activation could be recorded during VT on the endocardium near or within the border between the densely scarred aneurysm or infarct and more normal muscle [14] [15] [16] . The surgical procedure thus targeted areas specified by mapping. As originally practiced, subendocardial resection removed segments of endocardium approximately 3 mm thick and 5 cm 2 [13] . These areas were almost always within regions of visibly scarred endocardium, extending from the edge of a densely scarred aneurysm. As the procedure evolved, a more extensive area of resection was typically performed because of the ease of defining a single plane of resection with the goal of eliminating other arrhythmogenic areas within the visual scar. Adjunctive cryoablation was applied to locations that were not easily resected, such as the papillary muscles or the deep myocardial layers beneath the removed subendocardium when VT was localized to these regions. Cryoablation targeting an isthmus of surviving myocardium between a more densely scarred inferior infarction and the mitral annulus improved the outcome of VT ablation associated with this substrate [17] . More extensive cryoablation of the entire visually scarred endocardial surface was also used with some success [18] . Although success rates approached 90% with surgery in terms of VT elimination, a mortality rate of 5%-15% limited the procedure to a few select patients [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 15, "end": 18, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 356, "end": 360, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 433, "end": 437, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 786, "end": 790, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1304, "end": 1308, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1612, "end": 1616, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1617, "end": 1621, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1622, "end": 1626, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1816, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2591, "end": 2595, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2709, "end": 2713, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2869, "end": 2873, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "History of ventricular arrhythmia ablation"}, {"text": "In 1983, endocardial catheter ablation of VT using direct current energy electrical shock delivered via the distal electrode of a standard quadripolar endocardial catheter positioned in the area to be modified was first described by Hartzler [20] .

One to 8 R-wave-synchronous shocks of preselected energy ranging from 160 to 320 joules were delivered per session, with 23 patients undergoing at least one repeat procedure. Of note, a success rate of 87% in preventing VT recurrence was achieved, and no deaths were thought to be related to the endocardial shock itself. Strategies for analyzing the 12-lead ECG during VT and pace mapping to mimic the QRS of VT were first described in the early 1980s to help to regionalize areas of interest for more detailed activation mapping for surgical or early catheter-based VT ablation [22] [23] [24] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 242, "end": 246, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 305, "end": 309, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 996, "end": 1000, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1005, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1010, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "History of ventricular arrhythmia ablation"}, {"text": "Concern about barotrauma and the need for general anesthesia with direct current shock ablation led to the use of radiofrequency (RF) energy for catheter ablation for all arrhythmias, including VT, by the end of the 1980s [25, 26] .

[27] and Morady et al. [28] , respectively. Activation mapping to identify diastolic activation coupled with entrainment mapping techniques to identify critical components of the VT circuit ultimately proved most useful to define a critical isthmus through which a VT circuit must pass. This isthmus identification allowed for successful targeted ablation using RF ablation techniques for hemodynamically tolerated VT [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] .

A successful substratebased ablation strategy that did not require detailed mapping of VT was first described by Marchlinski et al. [36, 37] . Linear ablation created by sequential point lesions transected the border zone, extending into the region of dense infarction defined by detailed bipolar voltage mapping with a color-coded display on a threedimensional (3D) mapping system. The mapping system facilitated the ability to track lesion deployment. The location of the ablation line was guided by analyzing the 12-lead QRS of VT and by pace mapping to mimic the QRS complex. Subsequent substrate-based VT targets, which were reported to be effective surrogates of the VT circuit, included 1) late potentials (LPs); 2) channels defined by high voltage surrounded by lower voltage or by areas of pace capture surrounded by myocardium that could not be captured at 10 mA pacing output; 3) local abnormal ventricular activity (LAVA) that could demonstrate more abnormality with pacing; 4) paced map QRS morphologies that matched VT and demonstrated a long stimulus to QRS duration; and 5) regions in which pace mapping demonstrates abrupt transition in paced QRS morphologies [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] .

Implicit in each recommendation are several points: 1) the procedure is being performed by an electrophysiologist with appropriate training and experience in the procedure and in a facility with appropriate resources; 2) patient and procedural complexity vary widely, and some patients or situations merit a more experienced operator or a center with more capabilities than others, even within the same recommendation (eg, when an epicardial procedure is indicated and the operator or institution has limited experience with this procedure, it might be preferable to refer the patient to an operator or institution with adequate experience in performing epicardial procedures); 3) the patient is an appropriate candidate for the procedure (as outlined in Section 5.1), recognizing that the level of patient suitability for a procedure will vary widely with the clinical scenario; and 4) the patient's (or designee's) informed consent, values, and overall clinical trajectory are fundamental to a decision to proceed (or not) with any procedure. Therefore, in some clinical scenarios, initiation or continuation of medical therapy instead of an ablation procedure may be the most appropriate option, even when a class 1 recommendation for ablation is present. There may also be scenarios not explicitly covered in this document, and on which little or no published literature is available, in which the physician and patient must rely solely on their own judgment. In drafting these recommendations, the writing committee also referenced several other relevant clinical documents, including the 2017 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for Management of Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death [4] , among others. The exclusive focus of the current document on VA ablation led to the opportunity to develop more detailed and nuanced recommendations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 241, "end": 246, "text": "[216]", "ref_id": "BIBREF217"}, {"start": 2267, "end": 2270, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Indications for catheter ablation"}, {"text": "Recommendation-specific supportive text 1. In symptomatic patients with frequent PVCs from the RVOT, catheter ablation had a higher rate of efficacy than pharmacotherapy with either metoprolol or propafenone in an RCT [217] . Ablation success rates are reported at 80%-95%, with low complication rates [213, 217, 228, 237, 248, 249] . Catheter ablation can be considered as a preferred therapy in suitable, symptomatic patients. However, some patients with minimal or tolerable symptoms might prefer medical therapy or no therapy. 2. RVOT and LVOT are the most common SOOs for idiopathic VA in patients without SHD. VAs arising from LV arrhythmias referred for catheter ablation and are characterized by frequent PVCs or recurrent monomorphic VT with a catecholamine-sensitive focal m e c h a n i s m . V T c a n a r i s e f r o m e i t h e r t h e posteromedial papillary muscles or the anterolateral papillary muscles [86, 172, [261] [262] [263] [264] [265] [266] [267] . These arrhythmias often require several RF applications for successful ablation. A change in QRS morphology of the VA after ablative applications to either side of the involved papillary muscle is common. Due to the thickness of the papillary muscles and their vigorous contraction, catheter stability can be challenging and might be improved by the use of intracardiac ultrasound and possibly cryoablation [262, 266] . The recurrence risk after initial successful ablation of papillary muscle VAs is higher than for many other idiopathic VA sites, and repeat procedures are required in approximately 30% of patients [172, 262] . The mitral annulus is the SOO for approximately 20% of idiopathic LV arrhythmias, with the majority being PVCs or nonsustained VT rather than sustained VT [268, 269] . Mitral annular VAs are based on a focal, catecholamine-sensitive mechanism. A superioranterior mitral annular origin is more common than an inferior-posterior origin [95, [267] [268] [269] . Successful ablation is achieved in approximately 90% of mitral annular VAs, with a very low risk of complications [95, 146, [267] [268] [269] [270] [271] .

Endocardial mapping demonstrates a prepotential in the majority of VAs originating in this location, with successful ablation in over 90% of patients with a low risk of complications [272, 273] . 3. VAs that can be mapped and ablated within the GCV or AIV are relatively common SOOs near or within the LV summit [84, 87, 244, 274, 275] . Proximity to the coronary arteries needs to be assessed (see Sections 9.3 and 11.1) prior to ablation. If the SOO is too close (<5-10 mm) to a coronary artery, ablation from the adjacent endocardium might be successful when within 1 cm of the SOO [276] . These arrhythmias from the superior portion of the coronary venous system are usually based on a focal mechanism and typically require an irrigated-tip ablation catheter due to high impedance within the coronary vein. Mapping and ablation from the LSV or LV endocardium might also be successful, even if the local ECG in the coronary venous system is earlier [277] . For VAs with an intramural location, ablation within the perforator veins from within the LV septum [278] , simultaneous bipolar or simultaneous unipolar RF energy from the coronary venous system and the LV endocardium might be required to achieve successful ablation. Sustained monomorphic VT arising from the crux of the heart is typically very rapid, based on a focal catecholamine-sensitive mechanism, and often produces syncope [279] [280] [281] [282] . The QRS morphology is characterized by an abrupt transition from negative in lead V1, to positive in lead V2, to more negative in lead V3 [279] . Ablation can be achieved within the coronary venous system, including the middle cardiac vein [279, 280, 282] and the adjacent endocardium, or might require epicardial access [279] [280] [281] . The proximity of the coronary venous system to the posterior descending coronary artery requires imaging to prevent arterial injury. 4. VAs arising from the RV septum near the His bundle can be successfully ablated in approximately 70%-90% of patients, with several series reporting a higher likelihood of abandoning attempts at ablation due to concerns about inducing AV block [253, 259, 260, [283] [284] [285] [286] [287] [288] . The appearance of an accelerated junctional rhythm is common during RF application in this region, though AV block is not [253] . Catheter stability and the need to prevent injury to the AV node are issues that are carefully considered for these VAs [288] . Pacing maneuvers may be beneficial to prevent damage to the AV node [292] . The careful use of cryoablation can help to prevent damage to the conduction system if ablative therapy is delivered in close proximity to the conduction system. 5. The posterior-superior process of the LV is the most inferior and posterior aspect of the basal LV, posterior to the plane of the tricuspid valve [289] . Ablation of VAs in this region can be accomplished from the LV endocardium [290] . However, VAs arising from this region can also be successfully ablated from the inferior septal surface of the right atrium, where a small atrial signal and a larger ventricular signal, earlier than the earliest site in the LV endocardium, can be recorded [289] . Reports also describe ablati on from withi n t he CS [291] . Successful ablation can be achieved with either RF or cryoablation energies. The risk of complications appears to be low, although data are limited, and caution is required due to the proximity to the AV node and the AV nodal artery [289] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 79, "end": 84, "text": "[272]", "ref_id": "BIBREF273"}, {"start": 270, "end": 275, "text": "[272,", "ref_id": "BIBREF273"}, {"start": 276, "end": 280, "text": "273]", "ref_id": "BIBREF274"}, {"start": 399, "end": 403, "text": "[84,", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 404, "end": 407, "text": "87,", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 408, "end": 412, "text": "244,", "ref_id": "BIBREF245"}, {"start": 413, "end": 417, "text": "274,", "ref_id": "BIBREF275"}, {"start": 418, "end": 422, "text": "275]", "ref_id": "BIBREF276"}, {"start": 672, "end": 677, "text": "[276]", "ref_id": "BIBREF277"}, {"start": 1039, "end": 1044, "text": "[277]", "ref_id": "BIBREF278"}, {"start": 1147, "end": 1152, "text": "[278]", "ref_id": "BIBREF279"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1485, "text": "[279]", "ref_id": "BIBREF280"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1491, "text": "[280]", "ref_id": "BIBREF281"}, {"start": 1492, "end": 1497, "text": "[281]", "ref_id": "BIBREF282"}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1503, "text": "[282]", "ref_id": "BIBREF283"}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1649, "text": "[279]", "ref_id": "BIBREF280"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1751, "text": "[279,", "ref_id": "BIBREF280"}, {"start": 1752, "end": 1756, "text": "280,", "ref_id": "BIBREF281"}, {"start": 1757, "end": 1761, "text": "282]", "ref_id": "BIBREF283"}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1832, "text": "[279]", "ref_id": "BIBREF280"}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1838, "text": "[280]", "ref_id": "BIBREF281"}, {"start": 1839, "end": 1844, "text": "[281]", "ref_id": "BIBREF282"}, {"start": 2225, "end": 2230, "text": "[253,", "ref_id": "BIBREF254"}, {"start": 2231, "end": 2235, "text": "259,", "ref_id": "BIBREF260"}, {"start": 2236, "end": 2240, "text": "260,", "ref_id": "BIBREF261"}, {"start": 2241, "end": 2246, "text": "[283]", "ref_id": "BIBREF284"}, {"start": 2247, "end": 2252, "text": "[284]", "ref_id": "BIBREF285"}, {"start": 2253, "end": 2258, "text": "[285]", "ref_id": "BIBREF286"}, {"start": 2259, "end": 2264, "text": "[286]", "ref_id": "BIBREF287"}, {"start": 2265, "end": 2270, "text": "[287]", "ref_id": "BIBREF288"}, {"start": 2271, "end": 2276, "text": "[288]", "ref_id": "BIBREF289"}, {"start": 2401, "end": 2406, "text": "[253]", "ref_id": "BIBREF254"}, {"start": 2529, "end": 2534, "text": "[288]", "ref_id": "BIBREF289"}, {"start": 2605, "end": 2610, "text": "[292]", "ref_id": "BIBREF293"}, {"start": 2924, "end": 2929, "text": "[289]", "ref_id": "BIBREF290"}, {"start": 3007, "end": 3012, "text": "[290]", "ref_id": "BIBREF291"}, {"start": 3271, "end": 3276, "text": "[289]", "ref_id": "BIBREF290"}, {"start": 3332, "end": 3337, "text": "[291]", "ref_id": "BIBREF292"}, {"start": 3573, "end": 3578, "text": "[289]", "ref_id": "BIBREF290"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Indications for catheter ablation"}, {"text": "Recommendation-specific supportive text 1. In patients with a suspected PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, catheter ablation can be considered an alternative to long-term AAD therapy, particularly for patients with monomorphic PVCs, or PVCs of an RVOT origin [293] . PVC-induced cardiomyopathy should be suspected when cardiomyopathy and frequent PVCs are present and a comprehensive cardiac evaluation fails to identify alternate etiologies. Several studies have confirmed a correlation between a higher PVC burden and development of cardiomyopathy, although no precise burden of PVCs consistently predicts the development of a cardiomyopathy. Several studies have demonstrated a higher incidence of cardiomyopathy with PVC burdens >15%-25% [88, 215, 288, 303] ; however, patients with similarly high PVC burdens can also maintain normal cardiac function. Reversible PVC-induced cardiomyopathy has also been reported in patients with PVC burdens as low as 4%-5% [149, 304] . When PVC-induced cardiomyopathy is suspected in these patients with relatively low PVC burdens, other etiologies for cardiomyopathy should be thoroughly investigated and addressed, and the persistence of the PVC burden established. Other risk factors for the development of a PVC-induced cardiomyopathy to consider include epicardial origin of PVCs, PVCs with a longer QRS duration, longer exposure to PVCs, asymptomatic PVCs, interpolated PVCs, and male sex [293, 296, 305, 306] . In patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, PVC ablation has an overall reported success rate of 65%-90%, with a low complication rate [88, 149, 225, 293, [295] [296] [297] [298] ]. Predictors of ablation success include an RVOT PVC origin and a uniform PVC morphology. Following successful ablation, the majority of patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy experience significant improvement and, possibly, normalization of their LVEF. Based on a review of current data, routine catheter ablation of frequent PVCs in asymptomatic patients without evidence of LV dysfunction is not presently recommended.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 252, "end": 257, "text": "[293]", "ref_id": "BIBREF294"}, {"start": 735, "end": 739, "text": "[88,", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 740, "end": 744, "text": "215,", "ref_id": "BIBREF216"}, {"start": 745, "end": 749, "text": "288,", "ref_id": "BIBREF289"}, {"start": 750, "end": 754, "text": "303]", "ref_id": "BIBREF304"}, {"start": 956, "end": 961, "text": "[149,", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 962, "end": 966, "text": "304]", "ref_id": "BIBREF305"}, {"start": 1428, "end": 1433, "text": "[293,", "ref_id": "BIBREF294"}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1438, "text": "296,", "ref_id": "BIBREF297"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1443, "text": "305,", "ref_id": "BIBREF306"}, {"start": 1444, "end": 1448, "text": "306]", "ref_id": "BIBREF307"}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1591, "text": "[88,", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 1592, "end": 1596, "text": "149,", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 1597, "end": 1601, "text": "225,", "ref_id": "BIBREF226"}, {"start": 1602, "end": 1606, "text": "293,", "ref_id": "BIBREF294"}, {"start": 1607, "end": 1612, "text": "[295]", "ref_id": "BIBREF296"}, {"start": 1613, "end": 1618, "text": "[296]", "ref_id": "BIBREF297"}, {"start": 1619, "end": 1624, "text": "[297]", "ref_id": "BIBREF298"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1630, "text": "[298]", "ref_id": "BIBREF299"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Indications for catheter ablation"}, {"text": "In some asymptomatic patients with very frequent PVCs and preserved cardiac function who express a strong preference for ablation, approximately half of the writing committee members agreed that an ablation can be considered after adequate counseling on the risks, benefits, and alternatives to ablation, whereas half would not offer ablation. Additional clinical features that may portend worsening LV function that should be considered include LV dilation or a relative decrease in EF that may still be considered in the normal range. 2. In patients with underlying SHD, the presence of frequent PVCs can contribute to a cardiomyopathy, and successful PVC elimination by ablation can improve cardiac function [88, 208, 209] . Detailed cardiac imaging (such as CMR to quantify scarring) in conjunction with a comprehensive cardiac history, including the time course of cardiomyopathy devel-possible, and recurrent PVCs can arise from an alternate focus [300] . Successful ablation, therefore, often does not eliminate the need for an ICD. 4. In patients who are clinical nonresponders to CRT, with limited biventricular pacing due to frequent PVCs despite pharmacological therapy, successful PVC ablation has demonstrated an improvement in heart failure class and a modest improvement in LVEF. In one prospective multicenter study in which CRT nonresponders with frequent and primarily monomorphic PVCs were ablated, the improvements in LV function and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class were proportional to the preprocedural PVC burden, and the greatest improvement was noted in patients with a preablation PVC burden >22% [102] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 711, "end": 715, "text": "[88,", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 716, "end": 720, "text": "208,", "ref_id": "BIBREF209"}, {"start": 721, "end": 725, "text": "209]", "ref_id": "BIBREF210"}, {"start": 954, "end": 959, "text": "[300]", "ref_id": "BIBREF301"}, {"start": 1631, "end": 1636, "text": "[102]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Indications for catheter ablation"}, {"text": "Recommendation-specific supportive text 1. For patients presenting with VT despite AAD therapy, which often results in ICD therapies (shocks or ATP), therapeutic options include escalating AAD therapy by increasing the dose, changing the drug, adding a new drug, and catheter ablation.

The composite primary endpoint of death, VT storm, or appropriate ICD shock was reduced by catheter ablation. Benefit was observed in the subgroup on amiodarone at baseline, for whom escalated drug therapy was an increase in amiodarone or an addition of mexiletine (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.38-0.80; P = .001), but not in the subgroup of patients who were on sotalol at baseline, for whom escalation of drug therapy was initiation of amiodarone (HR 1.14; 95% CI 0.65-2.02; P = .64) [307] .

In addition to the VANISH trial described above [307] , 3 large, prospective, multicenter cohort studies have examined the role of catheter ablation in reducing recurrent VT in patients with IHD, most of whom had recurrent VT despite AAD therapy [308] [309] [310] . In these trials, the patient served as his/her own control, and VT episodes were reported for the 6 months before and the 6 months after ablation. In each study, a consistent reduction in VT episodes was observed post ablation. In the Euro-VT study, VT recurrence occurred in 49% of the patients [309] . A reduction in device therapies (ATP and shocks) was observed in 79% of these patients, with the mean number of therapies falling from 60 \u00b1 70 in the 6 months prior to ablation to 14 \u00b1 15 in the same period of time after ablation (P = .02). In the Multicenter Thermocool VT Ablation Trial, and the similarly designed Post-Approval THERMOCOOL VT Trial, the number of VT episodes in the 6 months before and after ablation was reduced from a median of 11.5 to 0 episodes (P < .0001), and from 13 to 0 episodes (P < .0001), respectively [308, 310] . 3. There are limited comparative data on catheter ablation vs other therapies in the management of VT storm. AAD therapy is almost universally used as first-line therapy for these patients; however, catheter ablation is a particularly important therapy when VA recurs. Two small, single-center, nonrandomized studies found that patients treated with ablation had a lower risk of recurrence than those treated medically [324] , or they had a similar risk of recurrence but lower mortality [325] ; however, these studies were limited by their retrospective study design and the small number of patients. Several other large series [311] [312] [313] [314] and a systematic review and meta-analysis [315] have shown a reduction in ICD therapies after catheter ablation and reasonable success in controlling arrhythmia, with a nonetheless significant mortality. A common finding is that unsuccessful ablation (persistent VT inducibility) is associated with poor outcomes. 4. Patients who do not tolerate or are unsuitable for AAD therapy have not generally been included in RCTs. However, the writing committee felt it was reasonable to recommend catheter ablation in such patients over no therapy, in view of the reduction in recurrent VT demonstrated in multiple clinical trials. Examples of contraindications to AAD therapy include significant renal dysfunction or QT prolongation in the case of sotalol, and severe pulmonary disease, which might be worsened by amiodarone. 5. Four RCTs have examined the role of catheter ablation in patients who have experienced their first episode of VT [8, [316] [317] [318] [319] . In these studies, an ICD has been a mandatory part of the protocol. Two of these trials have shown a reduction in the primary endpoint with catheter ablation [316, 317] . The CALYPSO pilot study found an increased time to first VT recurrence with ablation versus AADs [318] .

The VANISH2 trial is currently comparing these two strategies in patients with prior MI and VT while not on AAD therapy [327] . There are limited data exploring the feasibility of managing VT with catheter ablation without an ICD in selected patients with IHD and relatively preserved LV function [328] [329] [330] . Of 302 patients with IHD who underwent a catheter ablation procedure sufficiently successful to make ICD implantation unnecessary, approximately 3% experienced sudden death during 3-4 years of follow-up [328] [329] [330] . The writing group did not feel there was sufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding ablation as a stand-alone therapy without an ICD for patients with IHD and sustained VT. 6. It has long been recognized that the epicardial surface can contain critical elements of VT circuits in patients with IHD [67, 320] . However, the VT substrate can be accessed from the endocardium in most cases, and endocardial mapping and ablation have been the mainstay of therapy. A number of studies have shed light on the incidence of epicardial substrate in IHD. In the initial description of epicardial mapping and ablation in patients with inferior wall MI, an epicardial circuit was found in 7 of 30 VTs [67] . In another series of 11 patients with 1 to 4 prior unsuccessful endocardial ablation procedures, epicardial access was successful in 10, and 7 required epicardial ablation, which abolished the clinical VT in all patients. However, 40% had recurrence during follow-up, and there was one periprocedural death [321] . Two larger, singlecenter observational studies have reported similar or improved VT-free survival in patients with IHD undergoing combined endocardial and epicardial ablation [331, 332] . A prospective study of patients undergoing catheter ablation for electrical storm, in which epicardial access was obtained in all patients in one arm being treated with a scar homogenization technique (n = 43), found that ablation was performed in one-third. However, whether the epicardial substrate participated in clinical or inducible VT was not assessed [322] . There are limited data on the use of combined endocardial and epicardial ablation as a firstline approach in patients with IHD and VT [68] ; an RCT is currently examining this question [333] . Preprocedural imaging can be useful to determine the presence of epicardial substrate, and therefore the likelihood of requiring epicardial access for complete substrate ablation [334] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 421, "end": 426, "text": "[326]", "ref_id": "BIBREF327"}, {"start": 549, "end": 554, "text": "[327]", "ref_id": "BIBREF328"}, {"start": 726, "end": 731, "text": "[328]", "ref_id": "BIBREF329"}, {"start": 732, "end": 737, "text": "[329]", "ref_id": "BIBREF330"}, {"start": 738, "end": 743, "text": "[330]", "ref_id": "BIBREF331"}, {"start": 949, "end": 954, "text": "[328]", "ref_id": "BIBREF329"}, {"start": 955, "end": 960, "text": "[329]", "ref_id": "BIBREF330"}, {"start": 961, "end": 966, "text": "[330]", "ref_id": "BIBREF331"}, {"start": 1279, "end": 1283, "text": "[67,", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1288, "text": "320]", "ref_id": "BIBREF321"}, {"start": 1670, "end": 1674, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1984, "end": 1989, "text": "[321]", "ref_id": "BIBREF322"}, {"start": 2167, "end": 2172, "text": "[331,", "ref_id": "BIBREF332"}, {"start": 2173, "end": 2177, "text": "332]", "ref_id": "BIBREF333"}, {"start": 2539, "end": 2544, "text": "[322]", "ref_id": "BIBREF323"}, {"start": 2681, "end": 2685, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2732, "end": 2737, "text": "[333]", "ref_id": "BIBREF334"}, {"start": 2919, "end": 2924, "text": "[334]", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Indications for catheter ablation"}, {"text": "Recommendation-specific supportive text 1. Patients with NICM represent a heterogeneous population with diverse etiologies, including undifferentiated dilated NICM and valvular, hypertensive, hypertrophic, toxic, genetic, inflammatory, tachycardia-induced, peripartum, and infiltrative cardiomyopathy. Several retrospective and prospective cohort studies have shown VT-free survival of 40.5% to 70% at 1 year post ablation [335] [336] [337] [338] [339] [340] . VTs in the context of NICM are more often pleomorphic and polymorphic; they are less hemodynamically tolerated, are more difficult to induce, and are faster compared with postinfarction VT [348, 349] . Differences in the results of VT catheter ablation between NICM and ICM could be due to a substrate that is less favorable to ablation with NICM [350] . The substrate is often intramurally located and can involve the epicardium; it is typically located at the basal perivalvular regions and at the interventricular septum. The intramural substrate makes the arrhythmogenic substrate less accessible for identification of optimal ablation target sites based on pace mapping and identification of abnormal electrograms. Although sustained VT occurs in only 5% of patients with NICM, it is an important cause of sudden cardiac death [351] . Recurrent VT is associated with significantly increased mortality in NICM [352] . 2. Electrical storm with recurrent VT/VF episodes in patients with NICM and ICD can adversely affect hospitalization rates and long-term survival [352, 353] .

However, due to an increased risk of complications or late adhesions preventing future pericardial accesses, epicardial ablation may be reserved to firstline endocardial approach failures [335] , except when ECG or imaging suggests a predominant epicardial substrate [335] . Consideration should be given to the ability to proceed to epicardial access during the initial procedure. 4. Cardiac sarcoidosis is associated with a poor prognosis. VT is frequently resistant to AADs and immunosuppression, requiring ICDs. Recurrent VT is common in cardiac sarcoidosis and is associated with a poorer prognosis. Catheter ablation decreases VT recurrence and ICD shocks in cardiac sarcoidosis [111, [344] [345] [346] [347] . 5. AADs are not as effective as the ICD at decreasing mortality in patients with SHD and sustained VAs. Even if successful at acutely terminating VT or VF, ICD shocks have been associated with increased heart failure and mortality in NICM [354, 355] . To date, there has been no RCT comparing catheter ablation with AADs for preventing VT recurrences in NICM. Indirect comparisons have found similar reductions in VT recurrences with catheter ablation or amiodarone in patients with SHD [356] . Amiodarone might increase mortality in patients with cardiomyopathy [356, 357] and can cause serious long-term adverse effects. Catheter ablation of VT appears to be safe and effective in NICM, achieving long-term arrhythmia control in 50% to 70% [335, 340, 351, 358] (with AADs in onethird), with a survival rate of 70% [335, 340] . Retrospective series show that acute success of catheter ablation and freedom from recurrent VT after catheter ablation are associated with a significant reduction in mortality and heart transplantation in NICM [335, 340, 359, 360] . 6. Mutations in the lamin A/C (LMNA) gene are an important cause of NICM, with a disease course more aggressive than other forms of idiopathic NICM in terms of progression to end-stage heart failure or the tendency toward malignant VAs [361, 362] . Catheter ablation can be beneficial as a palliative strategy to allow transient arrhythmia control in patients with NICM related to LMNA mutations before aggressive heart failure management is proposed [110] . However, acute and chronic success are low, due to frequent intramural substrate, and complication rates are high in the published literature [110] . Disease progression to end-stage heart failure requiring mechanical support or transplant is also common, and VT ablation might be best targeted toward those with relatively earlier stage disease, rather than being a means to delay progression in those approaching end-stage heart failure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 104, "end": 108, "text": "[60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 109, "end": 112, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 217, "end": 222, "text": "[337,", "ref_id": "BIBREF338"}, {"start": 223, "end": 227, "text": "338]", "ref_id": "BIBREF339"}, {"start": 299, "end": 303, "text": "[59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 304, "end": 307, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 498, "end": 503, "text": "[335]", "ref_id": "BIBREF336"}, {"start": 577, "end": 582, "text": "[335]", "ref_id": "BIBREF336"}, {"start": 995, "end": 1000, "text": "[111,", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1006, "text": "[344]", "ref_id": "BIBREF345"}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1012, "text": "[345]", "ref_id": "BIBREF346"}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1018, "text": "[346]", "ref_id": "BIBREF347"}, {"start": 1019, "end": 1024, "text": "[347]", "ref_id": "BIBREF348"}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1271, "text": "[354,", "ref_id": "BIBREF355"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1276, "text": "355]", "ref_id": "BIBREF356"}, {"start": 1514, "end": 1519, "text": "[356]", "ref_id": "BIBREF357"}, {"start": 1590, "end": 1595, "text": "[356,", "ref_id": "BIBREF357"}, {"start": 1596, "end": 1600, "text": "357]", "ref_id": "BIBREF358"}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1774, "text": "[335,", "ref_id": "BIBREF336"}, {"start": 1775, "end": 1779, "text": "340,", "ref_id": "BIBREF341"}, {"start": 1780, "end": 1784, "text": "351,", "ref_id": "BIBREF352"}, {"start": 1785, "end": 1789, "text": "358]", "ref_id": "BIBREF359"}, {"start": 1843, "end": 1848, "text": "[335,", "ref_id": "BIBREF336"}, {"start": 1849, "end": 1853, "text": "340]", "ref_id": "BIBREF341"}, {"start": 2067, "end": 2072, "text": "[335,", "ref_id": "BIBREF336"}, {"start": 2073, "end": 2077, "text": "340,", "ref_id": "BIBREF341"}, {"start": 2078, "end": 2082, "text": "359,", "ref_id": "BIBREF360"}, {"start": 2083, "end": 2087, "text": "360]", "ref_id": "BIBREF361"}, {"start": 2326, "end": 2331, "text": "[361,", "ref_id": "BIBREF362"}, {"start": 2332, "end": 2336, "text": "362]", "ref_id": "BIBREF363"}, {"start": 2541, "end": 2546, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 2691, "end": 2696, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "3."}, {"text": "Recommendation-specific supportive text 1.

Among idiopathic VT cases referred for ablation, 2.8% were focal nonreentrant fascicular tachycardia, which had distinct clinical characteristics and usually originated from the left posterior fascicle (LPF), and less commonly from the left anterior fascicle (LAF) and RV Purkinje network. Catheter ablation guided by activation mapping is effective, whereas a pace map-guided approach is less effective. VT recurrence was observed in 27% of patients, and among them, pace mapping was used to target VT during the initial ablation attempt [389] . Another small series reported two focal Purkinje VT cases with IHD in whom complete AV block occurred after the successful ablation of the VT. This outcome suggests that ablation often is not sufficient as the sole therapy due to other induced VTs and conduction abnormalities, requiring pacemaker and/or defibrillator implantation for these VT patients with SHD [105] . 5. The Purkinje system might be part of the reentry circuit in patients with postinfarction monomorphic VT, resulting in a type of VT with a relatively narrow QRS complex that mimics fascicular VT. Catheter ablation is effective [138, 392] . 1. The substrate for VAs in patients with repaired CHD is typically reentry related to ventricular hypertrophy and areas of scar from prior incisions, patches, and conduit placement. The development of VAs in patients with CHD can be a manifestation of hemodynamic abnormalities, including valvar obstruction or regurgitation, ventricular dysfunction, or coronary abnormalities. Identification of the underlying abnormality contributing to ischemia, ventricular dysfunction, and VAs is important to therapeutic planning, given that interventions for the substrate may reduce the frequency of recurrent VAs and/or improve the hemodynamic status. 2. Most data regarding reoperation for patients with CHD and sustained VAs are from patients with tetralogy of Fallot. Treatment of underlying hemodynamic abnormalities may reduce the incidence of recurrent VAs and allow for ventricular remodeling or improvement in ventricular function. In studies of patients with tetralogy of Fallot and sustained VT undergoing reoperation for hemodynamic abnormalities without specific arrhythmia intervention, late postoperative VT was reduced to 11%-33% during mid-term follow-up [395, [400] [401] [402] 406] . Given the incomplete protection from recurrent VA, consideration should also be given to catheter and surgical ablation and/or ICD therapy as indicated (Fig. 2 ). 3. The majority of reports of successful VT ablation in adults with repaired CHD include patients with tetralogy of Fallot, with small numbers of patients with transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defects (VSDs), and other lesions [339, 410, 411, 420] . VT circuits tend to be multiple and related to prior ventriculotomies and VSD patches in patients with complex CHD [412-415, 417, 420, 421] . In patients with tetralogy of Fallot, anatomical isthmuses (AIs) critical to the reentrant circuit have been identified between the septal defect patch or ventriculotomy and the pulmonary valve, and between the tricuspid annulus and the OT patch or septal defect patch [412, 415, 417] . EAM to identify and ablate reentrant channels, with verification of conduction block and occasionally ablation from the left side of the ventricular septum, have procedural success rates of approximately 80% [414, 417, 421 ]. Patients with procedural success from catheter ablation and with preserved biventricular ventricular function have not experienced recurrent VT or sudden cardiac death in up to 10year follow-up [412, 415] . 4 . Several small studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of map-guided surgical ablation of VT during concomitant repair of SHD, with recurrent VT reported in 15%-20% of patients [395, 401, 402, 404] . To date, in patients with tetralogy of Fallot empiric surgical cryoablation lesions for sustained VT without electrophysiological mapping of the tachycardia circuit have shown recurrent VT in 18%-45% of patients [418, 422] . The role of prophylactic empiric cryoablation of the OT in selected high-risk patients with tetralogy of Fallot is evolving [409, 418] .

Over time, the need for repeat catheter ablation is common and due to the scar location, and an epicardial approach is often necessary. Long-term freedom from VA is achieved in approximately one-third of patients with an endocardial approach [426] . An endocardial followed by an epicardial ablation approach if the patient remains inducible for VT may avoid unnecessary epicardial access and associated procedural risk. However, strong consideration should be given to performing the procedure in a setting where it is possible to proceed to epicardial ablation during the same procedure, if endocardial ablation fails to terminate the clinical VA, or if the patient remains inducible.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 182, "end": 186, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 431, "end": 436, "text": "[426]", "ref_id": "BIBREF427"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "2."}, {"text": "In patients with ARVC, recurrent VT or frequent appropriate ICD interventions for VT can be seen despite the use of multiple AAD therapies [439] . The majority of patients undergoing catheter ablation are on antiarrhythmic therapy, including beta blockade before and after ablation. However, some patients in the published series were not on AAD therapy at the time of ablation [423, [425] [426] [427] [428] [429] ]. The overall acute success rates are acceptable, especially when an epicardial approach is used, and indeed are superior to that reported for other substrates like NICM [424] . Patients are often younger and might not be on other medications, which could influence the choice between AAD therapy and ablation. Two studies have assessed whether the substrate underlying VAs in ARVC progressed over time. In the first, scar progression, as assessed by bipolar voltage mapping in patients undergoing repeat ablation, was observed in 2 of 11 patients over a mean follow-up of approximately 6 years [440] . In the second, similar progression occurred in 2 of 7 patients over a 30-month follow-up, and recurrent VTs were ablated within the previously documented scar, suggesting incomplete ablation at the index procedure [441] . This outcome suggests that with a comprehensive initial procedure that achieves noninducibility, substrate progression and recurrent VA are not inevitable, at least over the medium term. Strong consideration should be given to performing such a procedure in a center that can proceed to an epicardial ablation during the same procedure should an endocardial ablation be insufficient to eliminate VT. However, to achieve long-term freedom from AADs, patients might require repeated ablation procedures and rely on ICD interventions for treatment of hemodynamically unstable VT. The writing committee felt that stronger consideration could be given to catheter ablation as a first-line approach without preceding AAD therapy by experienced operators and centers, and with fully informed patients. Reference should also be made to the 2019 HRS Expert Consensus Statement on Evaluation, Risk Stratification, and Management of Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy [438] . The role of catheter ablation in new-onset single morphology VT without ICD therapy prior to or after ablation was examined only in a small number of patients [439] . Catheter ablation has not been shown to reduce sudden cardiac death in patients with ARVC; thus, ICD therapy remains the mainstay for sudden cardiac death prevention [439, [442] [443] [444] . 4. Patients with Brugada syndrome and a type I Brugada ECG pattern (spontaneous or drug induced) have an arrhythmogenic substrate located in the anterior epicardial RVOT that can be further unmasked with provocative drug testing [436] . Targeted catheter ablation can normalize the electrographic abnormalities and reduce VA inducibility during programmed stimulation [434] [435] [436] [437] . Use of abla-tion with substrate modification in the most symptomatic patients (recurrent VF/VT, VF storm, or frequent ICD interventions) with Brugada syndrome and a type I Brugada ECG pattern (spontaneous or drug induced) has demonstrated a reduction in arrhythmic events [434] [435] [436] [437] . Long-term follow-up has been limited, and generalizability is unknown, given that procedures have been performed at highly specialized centers with expertise in Brugada syndrome and epicardial ablations [434] [435] [436] [437] . Drug therapy with quinidine should be considered as a first-line alternative [445] . 5. In patients with ARVC, combined endocardial and epicardial substrate catheter ablation has improved acute success and lowered recurrence rates compared with endocardial-only catheter ablation. A combined endocardial-epicardial approach might be a reasonable first-line approach, although not all patients require epicardial catheter ablation for elimination of VT. Risks associated with epicardial access and ablation should be considered, and these procedures should be performed at centers with expertise [59, 60] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 139, "end": 144, "text": "[439]", "ref_id": "BIBREF440"}, {"start": 378, "end": 383, "text": "[423,", "ref_id": "BIBREF424"}, {"start": 384, "end": 389, "text": "[425]", "ref_id": "BIBREF426"}, {"start": 390, "end": 395, "text": "[426]", "ref_id": "BIBREF427"}, {"start": 396, "end": 401, "text": "[427]", "ref_id": "BIBREF428"}, {"start": 402, "end": 407, "text": "[428]", "ref_id": "BIBREF429"}, {"start": 408, "end": 413, "text": "[429]", "ref_id": "BIBREF430"}, {"start": 585, "end": 590, "text": "[424]", "ref_id": "BIBREF425"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1015, "text": "[440]", "ref_id": "BIBREF441"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1237, "text": "[441]", "ref_id": "BIBREF442"}, {"start": 2192, "end": 2197, "text": "[438]", "ref_id": "BIBREF439"}, {"start": 2359, "end": 2364, "text": "[439]", "ref_id": "BIBREF440"}, {"start": 2533, "end": 2538, "text": "[439,", "ref_id": "BIBREF440"}, {"start": 2539, "end": 2544, "text": "[442]", "ref_id": "BIBREF443"}, {"start": 2545, "end": 2550, "text": "[443]", "ref_id": "BIBREF444"}, {"start": 2551, "end": 2556, "text": "[444]", "ref_id": "BIBREF445"}, {"start": 2788, "end": 2793, "text": "[436]", "ref_id": "BIBREF437"}, {"start": 2927, "end": 2932, "text": "[434]", "ref_id": "BIBREF435"}, {"start": 2933, "end": 2938, "text": "[435]", "ref_id": "BIBREF436"}, {"start": 2939, "end": 2944, "text": "[436]", "ref_id": "BIBREF437"}, {"start": 2945, "end": 2950, "text": "[437]", "ref_id": "BIBREF438"}, {"start": 3225, "end": 3230, "text": "[434]", "ref_id": "BIBREF435"}, {"start": 3231, "end": 3236, "text": "[435]", "ref_id": "BIBREF436"}, {"start": 3237, "end": 3242, "text": "[436]", "ref_id": "BIBREF437"}, {"start": 3243, "end": 3248, "text": "[437]", "ref_id": "BIBREF438"}, {"start": 3454, "end": 3459, "text": "[434]", "ref_id": "BIBREF435"}, {"start": 3460, "end": 3465, "text": "[435]", "ref_id": "BIBREF436"}, {"start": 3466, "end": 3471, "text": "[436]", "ref_id": "BIBREF437"}, {"start": 3472, "end": 3477, "text": "[437]", "ref_id": "BIBREF438"}, {"start": 3557, "end": 3562, "text": "[445]", "ref_id": "BIBREF446"}, {"start": 4075, "end": 4079, "text": "[59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 4080, "end": 4083, "text": "60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "3."}, {"text": "Recommendation-specific supportive text 1.

By demonstrating location [495, 508, 509] and extent [509] of delayed enhancement, CMR helps to identify the location of the arrhythmogenic substrate and therefore is beneficial in periprocedural planning regarding the need for obtaining epicardial access. Other imaging modalities, such as CT and nuclear imaging, have been correlated with electroanatomical voltage mapping data to identify scarring by detecting areas of delayed enhancement [493] [494] [495] [496] [497] [498] [499] [500] 502] , wall thinning [504] , hypoperfusion [503] , and lack of metabolic activity [507] .

Various cutoff values have been used to distinguish the border zone from the scar core and have been correlated with outcomes [521] [522] [523] . Controversy exists, however, about which of the methods and which of the cutoff values is preferable for assessment of tissue heterogeneity. It is important to note that quantification of the border zone still awaits histologic validation. Limitations of LGE-CMR include the limited spatial resolution that is in the 1-to 2-mm range, making it difficult to characterize tissue heterogeneity if the wall thickness is in this range. This, among others, is one of the reasons why the assessment for LGE in the thinner RV is challenging when using standard LGE-CMR techniques.

This is no longer the case, and provided that certain precautions are followed, CMR has been shown to be safe in several studies [516] and registries [514, 515] . However, in the presence of a CIED, artifacts from the device generator, especially from ICDs, can obscure the myocardium and render a CMR study completely or partially nondiagnostic [525] . It is therefore recommended to perform CMRs prior to ICD implantation. The prevalence and extent of artifact can be minimized by wideband CMR sequences [526] .

The American Society of Anesthesiologists defines levels of sedation in a continuum, varying from minimal sedation (anxiolysis), to moderate sedation or analgesia (conscious sedation), to deep sedation or analgesia, to general anesthesia [541] . Careful preprocedural assessment is indicated to define the ideal strategy for sedation and analgesia based on age and comorbidities, targeted arrhythmia, planned procedure, risk for airway obstruction, and patient wishes. General anesthesia ensures patient comfort that facilitates vascular and especially epicardial access, and also ensures immobility during catheter manipulation for mapping and ablation, especially for procedures of long duration. However, a major disadvantage of general anesthesia is its potential suppression of VA. Elimination of mental stress and the related changes in the autonomic tone during general anesthesia or deep sedation can potentially decrease the spontaneous manifestation of catecholamine-sensitive VA and the induction/ maintenance of reentrant VT [542] [543] [544] [545] . Inhaled anesthetics that prolong action-potential duration and ventricular refractoriness (sevoflurane and isoflurane) and intravenous anesthetics that reduce sympathetic tone (dexmedetomidine) are commonly avoided for ablation procedures [542, 543] . Additionally, most of the anesthetic agents used for sedation and analgesia reduce myocardial contractility and systemic vascular resistance, causing hypotension that could be exacerbated during VT, requiring pharmacological or mechanical HS. Those cardiovascular effects are more intense at the anesthetic doses needed for general anesthesia, which additionally produce higher attenuation of sympathetic tone. General anesthesia or the use of cardiodepressive medications, such as propofol for anesthesia in patients with severely compromised LV function, can result in acute hemodynamic compromise during the ablation procedure, and its use needs to be carefully considered for these patients. If general anesthesia is used during epicardial ablation procedures, the concomitant use of muscle relaxants could preclude identification of the phrenic nerve during epicardial ablation. Use of a short-acting muscle relaxant during induction of anesthesia is acceptable, without redosing; however, it could necessitate a deeper level of anesthesia with resultant exaggeration of the above-mentioned hypotensive effects. Nevertheless, the effects of propofol on cardiac electrophysiological proprieties are diverse and could include arrhythmia suppression. In fact, propofol has been associated with suppression of VT and VT storm [544] . The need for sedation and analgesia varies throughout the procedure, being higher during vascular and epicardial access and cardioversion or defibrillation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 281, "end": 286, "text": "[541]", "ref_id": "BIBREF544"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1085, "text": "[542]", "ref_id": "BIBREF545"}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1091, "text": "[543]", "ref_id": "BIBREF546"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1097, "text": "[544]", "ref_id": "BIBREF547"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1103, "text": "[545]", "ref_id": "BIBREF548"}, {"start": 1345, "end": 1350, "text": "[542,", "ref_id": "BIBREF545"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1355, "text": "543]", "ref_id": "BIBREF546"}, {"start": 2685, "end": 2690, "text": "[544]", "ref_id": "BIBREF547"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Anesthesia"}, {"text": "On the other hand, a more superficial level of sedation (or any) is desirable to prevent VA suppression and to assure VT induction and maintenance for mapping.

Intravenous boli of midazolam and fentanyl at repeated doses as needed was reported by a single-center observational study as a feasible and safe strategy for minimal sedation in patients with idiopathic PVC or VT planned for shorter procedures [539] . However, even shorteracting sedatives such as midazolam have the potential for suppressing idiopathic VA for prolonged periods of time and need to be used with caution during procedures targeting idiopathic VAs, such as frequent PVCs. A strategy to use shorter-acting sedatives such as propofol for allowing temporary deeper sedation is frequently used initially, and if VAs are suppressed, sedation can be reduced or discontinued to allow for arrhythmias to reappear as necessary. For patients with scar-related VTs, sedatives such as midazolam, which has the additional benefit of amnesia, do not impact on inducibility of VT and can be used in conjunction with analgesics and/or other sedatives such as propofol to achieve the desired level of sedation. Continuous infusion of propofol, alone or complemented with repeated boli of fentanyl (as needed), has been proposed for deep sedation of stable patients during ablation of idiopathic or scar-related VT that are expected to have a longer duration or that require more painful and challenging techniques, such as epicardial access.

General anesthesia was associated, however, with less hemodynamic stability and greater use of vasopressor support with phenylephrine, without an adverse effect on procedural outcomes. More aggressive stimulation was often required with general anesthesia than with conscious sedation [547] . In another cohort of 25 patients referred for epicardial ablation in the setting of NICM, a strategy of initial programmed stimulation under sedation with midazolam, fentanyl, or remifentanil led to induction of tolerated VT in 15 patients, and avoidance of epicardial access (which was performed under general anesthesia) altogether occurred in 10 (40%) [540] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 157, "text": "[546]", "ref_id": "BIBREF549"}, {"start": 833, "end": 838, "text": "[547]", "ref_id": "BIBREF550"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1131, "text": "[547]", "ref_id": "BIBREF550"}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1494, "text": "[540]", "ref_id": "BIBREF543"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The selection of sedation strategy for patients under-"}, {"text": "On the basis of the cited single-center observational studies [481, 539, 540, [542] [543] [544] [545] [546] [547] [548] about the various sedative and analgesic strategies for ablation of VAs, it is reasonable to avoid general anesthesia and deeper levels of sedation in patients with idiopathic VAs (PVC or VT) planned for shorter procedures, particularly when the arrhythmia is suspected to be catecholamine-sensitive (typically, automatic and triggered arrhythmias) or was not inducible during a prior procedure. In these patients, a minimal sedation strategy with short-acting sedatives and analgesics, with repeated doses as needed, can be useful to ensure adequate sedation without VA suppression. 4. Epicardial scar-related VT mapping and ablation under deep sedation with sufentanil or remifentanil and intermittent boli of midazolam was reported as a feasible and safe strategy in a single-center prospective series and a case report [546, 548] . Interestingly, no respiratory failure resulting in endotracheal intubation or prolonged periods of hypotension requiring HS were observed (except during periods of unstable VT) in these cases (combined 79 procedures in 73 patients). Importantly, this strategy allowed epicardial access with comfort, preventing the need for general anesthesia and muscle relaxants (facilitating the identification of the phrenic nerve during epicardial ablation), and providing rapid recuperation of consciousness with no recall of punctures or cardioversions. Remifentanil is an opioid with an analgosedative effect that can have advantages for ablation of VAs, including a lack of negative inotropic effect, comparatively little effect on arrhythmogenicity, time-to-peak effect of approximately 90 s and a half-life of 3-4 min [546] . This agent is also associated with hypotension likely secondary to vasodilatation and bradycardia. Moderate to deep sedation with continuous infusion of propofol and repeated boli of fentanyl under close hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring might be considered for stable patients with ablation of idiopathic or scar-related VA with no indication for general anesthesia who are expected to undergo a procedure of longer duration or for patients who require more painful techniques, such as epicardial access. Another short-action anesthetic, such as remifentanil or sufentanil, could also be considered. Of note, patients with severe hemodynamic compromise, severe life-threatening comorbidities or acute illness, respiratory failure, high risk for airway obstruction, or who were intubated before the procedure for arrhythmia storm or cardiogenic shock were excluded in the cited studies and are also traditionally considered candidates for general anesthesia.

The choice of peripheral vascular access depends upon several factors, including the arrhythmia's SOO, the location of any substrate identified on preor intraprocedural imaging, the patient's anatomy, and the presence of peripheral vascular disease or venous occlusion or agenesis. LV access can be achieved through either retrograde transaortic or antegrade transseptal approaches, depending on patient specifics and operator preference, the latter especially in the presence of mechanical aortic valve replacement or severe aortic or peripheral vascular disease. Although most areas of the endocardial LV can be accessed by either approach, the degree of contact force can vary (eg, contact force was significantly higher transseptally in the midanteroseptum, mid-lateral, and apical segments, and significantly higher with a retrograde approach in the basalanteroseptum, basal-inferoseptum, basal-inferior, and the basal-lateral segments) [555] . If a retrograde access to the LV endocardium has been chosen, the use of long sheaths can be helpful in the presence of tortuosity of the iliac arteries or the distal aorta.

Because of the risk of arterial injury, imaging of the coronary arteries with arteriography is essential. The use of other coronary artery imaging techniques assumes that an adequate registration of imaging data has been accomplished. Hence, coronary angiography is the preferred technique. 2. Epicardial ablation requires considerable preparation prior to the procedure. Major complications occur in approximately 5% of epicardial ablation procedures [60] . Unintended puncture of the RV can occur in up to 17% of cases [60] , although bleeding is usually self-limited provided that a sheath has not been introduced through the RV free wall. The patient's blood should be typed and cross-matched for immediate transfusion should significant bleeding occur. Because bleeding within the pericardial space is common, intracardiac or transthoracic echocardiography should be immediately available. In addition, cardiothoracic surgical backup should be readily available. A potentially serious complication of percutaneous subxiphoid transpericardial puncture is laceration of the liver or intra-abdominal arteries. Thus, unexplained hypotension should prompt imaging of these structures to evaluate possible intra-abdominal bleeding that could necessitate surgical repair. 3. The presence of pericardial adhesions can severely restrict the ability to maneuver a guidewire or catheter within the pericardial space. Thus, patients with prior cardiac surgery or a history of pericarditis can present significant challenges for epicardial ablation. Although dissection of pericardial adhesions using a guidewire, deflectable catheter, or deflectable sheath can be useful to allow epicardial mapping [559] [560] [561] , access to the entire epicardial surface might not be possible, and loculated pericardial effusions that are challenging to drain percutaneously can occur in this setting. A planned surgical dissection of pericardial adhesions can allow dense adhesions to be safely lysed and allow epicardial ablation in selected cases [562, 563] . 4. Damage to the phrenic nerves can occur if the ablation electrode lies adjacent to these structures [564] and can be minimized by pacing from the ablation electrode using high stimulus intensity to identify phrenic nerve stimulation.

The presence of a subepicardial or midmyocardial scar with contrast-enhanced CT or CMR is a valuable tool to identify potential epicardial substrates for VT and correlates with voltage mapping [583, 584] . Preprocedural imaging is therefore useful to select patients for epicardial mapping and ablation and to guide the operator to the regions of interest. The surface ECG [174, [176] [177] [178] 585] during VT provides important clues to an epicardial origin, including the presence of a pseudo-delta wave (\u226534 ms in duration) in the precordial leads, an intrinsicoid deflection to the peak of the R wave in lead V2 \u2265 85 ms, and an RS duration of \u2265121 ms, although with limited specificity in patients with ICM [174, 585] .

Although the origin of epicardial VTs in patients with SHD depends on scar location, in patients without SHD, the SOO is often in close proximity to the mitral annulus and the LV summit. This area can be reached and mapped via the coronary venous system. Scar-related VTs are often beyond the reach of the coronary venous system and hence require different access to the pericardial space.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 119, "end": 124, "text": "[495,", "ref_id": "BIBREF496"}, {"start": 125, "end": 129, "text": "583,", "ref_id": "BIBREF586"}, {"start": 130, "end": 134, "text": "584]", "ref_id": "BIBREF587"}, {"start": 183, "end": 187, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 477, "end": 482, "text": "[583,", "ref_id": "BIBREF586"}, {"start": 483, "end": 487, "text": "584]", "ref_id": "BIBREF587"}, {"start": 657, "end": 662, "text": "[174,", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 663, "end": 668, "text": "[176]", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 669, "end": 674, "text": "[177]", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 675, "end": 680, "text": "[178]", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}, {"start": 681, "end": 685, "text": "585]", "ref_id": "BIBREF588"}, {"start": 997, "end": 1002, "text": "[174,", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 1003, "end": 1007, "text": "585]", "ref_id": "BIBREF588"}, {"start": 1226, "end": 1231, "text": "[177]", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1363, "text": "[177]", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1529, "text": "[586]", "ref_id": "BIBREF589"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Criteria suggesting epicardial substrate"}, {"text": "Access to the epicardium is most often achieved with a subxiphoid, transpericardial puncture using either a 17-18-gauge, 6-in. Tuohy or similar needle with a beveled tip [58] , a thinner 21-gauge needle [587] , or a needle-in-needle technique [587, 588] . Three-quarters of the writing committee who perform epicardial access use a Tuohy needle, whereas the rest use the needle-in-needle technique. The latter approach uses a 7-cm, 18gauge needle for support while puncturing the skin and subcutaneous tissues, while a longer (15-20-cm) 21-gauge micropuncture needle is inserted through the 18-gauge needle to puncture the parietal pericardium [588] . With either approach, small amounts of radiographic contrast are injected to confirm that the needle is within the pericardial space and that contrast moves freely within this space. A long guidewire is then advanced through the needle, with care taken to ensure that it moves freely to surround the cardiac silhouette. The angle of entry into the pericardial space can be either anterior, in which case the guidewire travels superiorly over the free wall of the RV, or posterior (inferior approach), in which the guidewire travels beneath the LV inferior wall before traveling superiorly toward the posterobasal LV. Transpericardial access should be guided by fluoroscopy, including a steep left anterior oblique or lateral view; the latter being useful for an anterior access. Once successful entry within the pericardial space is achieved, a sheath is advanced over the guidewire, allowing the mapping and ablation catheter to be moved across the epicardial surface. Percutaneous subxiphoid access to the pericardial space might not be feasible in patients with dense pericardial adhesions, including patients with prior cardiac surgery, previous pericarditis, or prior epicardial ablation procedures [559] [560] [561] . For these patients, a limited thoracotomy with a small subxiphoid or larger left lateral thoracotomy might be required that allows for manual lysis of adhesions and control of bleeding [562, 563] . Thus, a collaborative approach with a cardiothoracic surgeon and an electrophysiologist might be required for patients in whom a percutaneous approach is not feasible because of pericardial adhesions. The presence of less extensive pericardial adhesions can be approached percutaneously, using a deflectable catheter and sheath for adhesion lysis. Insufflation of carbon dioxide or contrast via intentional exit into the pericardial space from the right atrium [589] or coronary venous system [590] could have a role in determining the extent of adhesions in patients with prior cardiac surgery [589] and can facilitate epicardial access; however, further study is required. Catheter ablation on the epicardial surface is usually performed with irrigated RF current, though cryoablation has also been reported [591] [592] [593] [594] [595] . Use of a low irrigation flow rate (5-7 mL/min) appears to result in a similar lesion size as the higher flows used in endocardial ablation while limiting intrapericardial fluid accumulation, which reduces lesion size [592] . Frequent aspiration of irrigant is also important to prevent hemodynamic compromise. The use of contact force-sensing catheters can improve orientation of the ablation electrode so that current is directed toward the epicardial surface rather than toward the parietal pericardium [596] [597] [598] . Epicardial fat >5 mm in thickness results in reduced electrogram voltage and increased stimulation threshold, and could limit the depth of RF lesions [528, 581, [599] [600] [601] [602] [603] .

Major complications have been reported in approximately 5% of patients [59, 60] . The most common complication of epicardial mapping and ablation is pericarditis, which can occur in over 20% of patients [59] . The use of systemic or intrapericardial steroids can decrease the risk and severity of pericarditis (see Section 10.1). Inadvertent puncture of the RV can occur in up to 17% of cases and usually results in selflimited bleeding of <80 cc venous blood [60] . Avoidance of dual antiplatelet therapy can reduce periprocedural bleeding during epicardial ablation. Inadvertent puncture of the RV can be recognized if a guidewire can be advanced into the pulmonary artery. This is managed by withdrawing the guidewire from the RV, withdrawing the needle, and readvancing the wire until the pericardial space is accessed. If the needle enters and then exits the RV before pericardial access is obtained, a \"through and through\" puncture of the RV can result. In this case, hemodynamic collapse might occur only on removal of the sheath at the end of the procedure. This complication can be detected when bleeding occurs after withdrawal of the pericardial sheath with the guide wire still in place. It is recommended to advance a guide wire into the pericardial space prior to sheath removal and to observe the puncture site for bleeding before removing the guide wire. Other complications of percutaneous, subxiphoid pericardial access include laceration or puncture of an epicardial coronary artery or vein (which could necessitate coronary stenting or surgical repair), RV pseudoaneurysm, and coronary spasm [604] . RF current that is applied within 5 mm of an epicardial coronary artery can produce occlusion, spasm, or stenosis of the artery [556] [557] [558] . Because of this risk, imaging of the coronary arteries with arteriography or preprocedural CT angiography is essential to accurately localize the ablation electrode relative to the position of the coronary arteries. The left phrenic nerve has a variable course and can be damaged by RF or cryoablation energy [564, 565] . Preprocedural imaging (see Section 5) has been particularly helpful to display the anatomical course of the coronary arteries and the phrenic nerve, thereby preventing damage to these structures. Reliance on imaging only, however, might cause damage to these structures in case of imperfect image registration. Also, pacing from the ablation electrode with high stimulus intensity prior to ablation should be performed to exclude phrenic nerve stimulation. In some cases in which the ablation target is in close proximity to the phrenic nerve, a balloon or steerable catheter can be advanced into the pericardial space to shield the nerve from ablation-related injury [564, 605] ; the use of air and fluid in the pericardial space has also been reported to reduce the risk of phrenic nerve damage [565] . Of note, the presence of air in the pericardial space can increase the defibrillation threshold, requiring emergent decompression or internal defibrillation if defibrillation is required [606] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 139, "end": 143, "text": "[59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 144, "end": 147, "text": "60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 271, "end": 275, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 528, "end": 532, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1686, "text": "[604]", "ref_id": "BIBREF607"}, {"start": 1817, "end": 1822, "text": "[556]", "ref_id": "BIBREF559"}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1828, "text": "[557]", "ref_id": "BIBREF560"}, {"start": 1829, "end": 1834, "text": "[558]", "ref_id": "BIBREF561"}, {"start": 2146, "end": 2151, "text": "[564,", "ref_id": "BIBREF567"}, {"start": 2152, "end": 2156, "text": "565]", "ref_id": "BIBREF568"}, {"start": 2186, "end": 2196, "text": "Section 5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2827, "end": 2832, "text": "[564,", "ref_id": "BIBREF567"}, {"start": 2833, "end": 2837, "text": "605]", "ref_id": "BIBREF608"}, {"start": 2956, "end": 2961, "text": "[565]", "ref_id": "BIBREF568"}, {"start": 3151, "end": 3156, "text": "[606]", "ref_id": "BIBREF609"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epicardial access complications"}, {"text": "Esophageal injury can also occur if ablation is performed in the posterior LV [607] [608] [609] .

Recommendation-specific supportive text 1. In patients with VAs and severe comorbidities, incessant or recurrent VTs treated by multiple ICD shocks might cause end organ hypoperfusion and further deterioration in cardiac function [359, 451] . Planning for a VA ablation procedure, in which there is a significant risk that it will be complicated by hemodynamic deterioration, should involve specialists in heart failure. The patient's values regarding the various temporary and permanent HS options and their feasibility should be considered. 2. Data about strategies for HS during VT ablation are available from single and multicenter, nonrandomized, retrospective, and observational trials, which have demonstrated feasibility and safety [455, 459, [610] [611] [612] [613] . Mapping of nontolerated VTs can be performed for longer periods of time when HS with either percutaneous left ventricular assist device (pLVAD) (Tandem Heart, CardiacAssist, Pittsburgh, PA; and Impella, Abiomed, Danvers, MA) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is performed as opposed to no support or intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) [610, 611] . A large retrospective multicenter report, however, has demonstrated that the use of HS was associated with higher acute ablation failure rates, increased periprocedural complications, higher mortality, and a higher rate of VT recurrence [613] . It is possible that HS was used in patients with more severe disease in this study, and outcome data were similar between the HS and no HS groups compared with patients with severely compromised EF (\u226420%) and advanced heart failure (NYHA class III and IV). Hence, the use of HS in these patients needs to be carefully considered. Of note, data supporting HS as a bailout strategy during or right after VT ablation are poor and do not demonstrate a benefit for procedural outcomes and survival [454, 455, 459] . 3. The benefit of HS to allow mapping of unstable VTs needs to be weighed against the potential detrimental effects of HS, depending on the type of support that is used, including vascular damage due to large-bore venous and arterial access sites, among others [610] . Prevention of hemodynamic deterioration during the ablation procedure by cautious use of cardiodepressive medications such as propofol could obviate the necessity for HS; also, the use of general anesthesia has been identified as a factor associated with hemodynamic deterioration and needs to be carefully considered in patients with severely impaired myocardial function. Adequate patient selection using risk assessment algorithms (see Section 5) could help to identify patients for whom HS might be beneficial.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 618, "end": 623, "text": "[359,", "ref_id": "BIBREF360"}, {"start": 624, "end": 628, "text": "451]", "ref_id": "BIBREF452"}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1133, "text": "[455,", "ref_id": "BIBREF456"}, {"start": 1134, "end": 1138, "text": "459,", "ref_id": "BIBREF460"}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1144, "text": "[610]", "ref_id": "BIBREF613"}, {"start": 1145, "end": 1150, "text": "[611]", "ref_id": "BIBREF614"}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1156, "text": "[612]", "ref_id": "BIBREF615"}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1162, "text": "[613]", "ref_id": "BIBREF616"}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1508, "text": "[610,", "ref_id": "BIBREF613"}, {"start": 1509, "end": 1513, "text": "611]", "ref_id": "BIBREF614"}, {"start": 1753, "end": 1758, "text": "[613]", "ref_id": "BIBREF616"}, {"start": 2254, "end": 2259, "text": "[454,", "ref_id": "BIBREF455"}, {"start": 2260, "end": 2264, "text": "455,", "ref_id": "BIBREF456"}, {"start": 2265, "end": 2269, "text": "459]", "ref_id": "BIBREF460"}, {"start": 2533, "end": 2538, "text": "[610]", "ref_id": "BIBREF613"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epicardial access complications"}, {"text": "Recommendation-specific supportive text 1. Catheter ablation of VA can be associated with risk of thrombus formation and thromboembolism. Although the individual risk varies with type and site of ablation and patient factors, the risk of clinically apparent stroke or thromboembolism in patients with SHD undergoing VT ablation in RCTs has ranged from 0% to 1.9% [307, [316] [317] [318] [319] and is lower in patients without SHD [616] . A small study with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance brain imaging demonstrated the presence of a new brain lesion in 58% of patients undergoing LV endocardial ablation [617] . These lesions were detected in the absence of clinically apparent stroke; no brain lesion was identified in patients undergoing RV ablation. Although systemic heparinization has been routine for LV endocardial ablation since the earliest large-scale investigations, few studies have compared different approaches to anticoagulation before, during, or after the VT ablation procedure [614, 615] (Table 9 ). Systemic anticoagulation with heparin is recommended for all procedures that last more than several minutes involving left heart catheterization. Intraprocedural anticoagulation schemes differ between centers. Unfractionated heparin is commonly administered after sheath insertion as an initial bolus (empirical 3. Anticoagulation is not required solely for epicardial mapping and/or ablation. If LV mapping is planned, epicardial access can be obtained prior to LV instrumentation and systemic anticoagulation (see Section 6.3).

Two small studies reported epicardial access in fully anticoagulated patients without a major increase in risk of bleeding complications [620, 621] . When the writing committee was surveyed about epicardial access after full heparinization, half of the writing committee would administer protamine for heparin reversal even when extensive endocardial ablation had been performed, 20% would administer protamine only after limited LV endocardial ablation, and another 20% of the writing committee members would terminate the procedure and schedule an epicardial ablation as a separate procedure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 363, "end": 368, "text": "[307,", "ref_id": "BIBREF308"}, {"start": 369, "end": 374, "text": "[316]", "ref_id": "BIBREF317"}, {"start": 375, "end": 380, "text": "[317]", "ref_id": "BIBREF318"}, {"start": 381, "end": 386, "text": "[318]", "ref_id": "BIBREF319"}, {"start": 387, "end": 392, "text": "[319]", "ref_id": "BIBREF320"}, {"start": 430, "end": 435, "text": "[616]", "ref_id": "BIBREF619"}, {"start": 611, "end": 616, "text": "[617]", "ref_id": "BIBREF620"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1007, "text": "[614,", "ref_id": "BIBREF617"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1012, "text": "615]", "ref_id": "BIBREF618"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1702, "text": "[51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1703, "end": 1707, "text": "619]", "ref_id": "BIBREF622"}, {"start": 1847, "end": 1852, "text": "[620,", "ref_id": "BIBREF623"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1857, "text": "621]", "ref_id": "BIBREF624"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1013, "end": 1021, "text": "(Table 9", "ref_id": "TABREF31"}], "section": "Intraprocedural hemodynamic support"}, {"text": "Prophylactic antibiotics are not generally indicated for sterile procedures such as VA ablation [622] .

In addition, a baseline assessment of arrhythmia induction can be useful by comparison for the eventual assessment of procedural outcome (see Section 9.17). Given the majority of idiopathic VAs are caused by cAMP-mediated delayed afterdepolarizations, they can be provoked with catecholamine infusion and burst pacing [623, 624] . Although purely substrate-based ablation (without arrhythmia induction) can be performed, many laboratories perform programmed stimulation in select patients with reentrant scarrelated VT for several reasons: 1) to perform activation and entrainment mapping in tolerated VT; 2) to identify the clinical VT morphologies to better focus substrate-based ablation; and 3) to limit the extent of ablation delivery. Although \"legacy\" protocols for programmed stimulation have been proposed [625, 626] , most laboratories that perform programmed stimulation would hold to a minimal standard of at least 1 site and 2 drive CLs, with the delivery of 1-4 ventricular extrastimuli at coupling intervals limited by local refractoriness or a minimum of 180-200 ms. Given known site dependence for induction of reentrant VT, additional sites of stimulation (particularly the LV) can be useful. The use of long-short sequences during programmed stimulation has been particularly helpful to induce BBRVT that can easily be addressed with an ablation procedure. The most important objective of the ablation procedure is to identify and eliminate the clinical VT. Prior studies have demonstrated that programmed stimulation results in VT induction in 93%-95% of patients with healed MI and a history of sustained VT [626, 627] . Importantly, these studies were concerned with induction of any VT, but not necessarily the clinical VTs. Limited data are available to address the question of how reliable PES is in reproducing all clinically pertinent VT morphologies. Given that 12-lead ECGs of the clinical VT are frequently not available, ICD electrograms have been described to reliably identify the clinical VT when induced in the electrophysiology lab [628] . Unfortunately, the clinical VT is not always inducible: 7%-24% of patients are completely noninducible [629] [630] [631] , and the clinical VT cannot be induced in another 13%-30% of patients [628, 629, 632] . Furthermore, induction of VTs that have not been previously documented occurs frequently, depending on whether the PES protocol is completed, until all extrastimuli are delivered from multiple sites and refractoriness has been reached. Elimination of all inducible VTs has been found to result in improved outcomes [633, 634] ; hence, this is the ideal objective of the ablation procedure. Inducibility of nonclinical VTs post ablation has been found to be associated with a high VT recurrence rate [635] . Risks and benefits will need to be weighed, however, given it might take performance of longer procedures to reach this objective. A major concern about the reliability of PES is that VTs often recur even when patients have been rendered completely noninducible post ablation [634] .

In \"exit sites,\" electrograms can be fractionated and immediately precede the onset of the QRS complex.

Ablation of the diastolic pathway \"isthmus\" is therefore a more desirable target, given it can eliminate the machinery required for reentry. Electrograms at isthmus sites occur earlier during diastole, are typically of very low-voltage amplitude (<0.5 mV), and can have multiple potentials. Mapping of these circuits with multielectrode mapping catheters can be helpful for identifying low amplitude signals, for differentiating near-field from far-field potentials, and for shortening the time required for mapping (see Section 8.1). It should be noted that the mere presence of diastolic potentials does not suggest an isthmus location. These can also be recorded in dead-end pathways and adjacent bystanders unrelated to the circuit. It is therefore important to carefully review and interpret the activation map in order to understand the location and complexity of the circuit. In principle, an activation map of a macroreentrant VT circuit should demonstrate distinct entrance, isthmus, and exit sites that all serve as obligatory parts of the circuit, such that it cannot continue without all of these elements. However, scar-related circuits (particularly in patients with a nonischemic substrate) can have intramural component(s) that might not be recorded on the surface.

The QRS configuration during entrainment provides information about whether the pacing site is within or outside the protected zone of the reentry circuit. With the pacing site being located outside the reentry circuit, during entrainment, the stimulated wavefronts that propagate out from the pacing site collide with the orthodromically propagating wavefront of the reentry circuit and fuse; therefore, the QRS complex is due to the fusion of wavefronts propagating directly away from the pacing site with those emerging from the tachycardia circuit (classic entrainment). During pacing from within a protected region in or near the reentry circuit, pacing entrains VT without changing the QRS configuration (concealed entrainment or entrainment with concealed fusion) [29, 652, 653 ]. 2. The stimulus-QRS interval during entrainment with concealed fusion: Entrainment with concealed fusion Adapted with permission from Elsevier [31] indicates that the pacing site is within a protected region of the reentry circuit, and can be located in the common pathway of the reentry circuit (also referred to as a critical isthmus or channel), or in a bystander site that communicates with a critical isthmus. If pacing is performed from a site in the circuit, the stimulus-QRS interval should be equal to the electrogram-QRS interval during VT. On the other hand, if stimulation is performed from a bystander site, the stimulus-QRS interval is longer than the electrogram-QRS interval during tachycardia [30, 654] . A difference in stimulus-QRS and electrogram-QRS up to 30 ms was superior to other criteria for distinguishing bystander sites from critical sites in one study [655] . The stimulus-QRS interval indicates the conduction time from the pacing site to the VT exit site [656] . Similarly, the stimulus-QRS/VT CL ratio is a reflection of the pacing site location within the critical zone of the reentry circuit (Figs. 5 and 6). The exit site is defined as a stimulus-QRS/VT CL ratio < 0.3, the common pathway and entry sites have a stimulus-QRS/VT CL ratio 0.3-0.7, and the inner loop sites have a stimulus-QRS/VT CL ratio > 0.7. There is, however, an important exception to keep in mind: a longer stimulus-QRS/VT CL ratio of >0.7 can occur at critical sites within the reentry circuit. Discrete potentials located in electrical systole rather than diastole that match with the stimulus-QRS interval are present in these situations and reflect that the catheter is within the VT entrance zone [657] . 3.

The PPI includes the conduction time for a full revolution of the propagating wavefront through the reentry circuit. Several factors can impact PPI accuracy. A faster pacing rate can result in slower conduction and a prolongation of the PPI. The measurement of the PPI assumes that the recorded electrogram indicates a depolarization at the pacing site.

Furthermore, ICE can be used as an adjuvant technique to identify scarring by identifying wall segments with wall thinning, wall motion abnormalities, excessive trabeculations [700] , segments with increased echogenicity [586, 681] , and also to identify intracardiac thrombi [535] .

EAM systems combine cardiac electrical information obtained from catheter-mounted electrodes and 3D spatial location information to reconstruct an image that represents the targeted cardiac chamber [723] . Several EAM systems are commonly used in clinical practice. The CARTO mapping system (current version CARTO 3, Biosense-Webster, Diamond Bar, CA) makes use of magnetic field differences for accurate localization of proprietary mapping and ablation catheters. This system also uses an impedance-based algorithm to visualize the electrodes and shafts of various diagnostic catheters. A proprietary intracardiac ultrasound catheter can interface with the mapping system to further define cardiac geometry within the mapping field [712] . Regardless of the type of EAM available, knowledge of the first principles of cardiac electrophysiology remains essential to create maps that accurately represent the physiology and anatomy. Maps created using EAM systems are subject to considerable variability depending on a number of factors, including (but not limited to) accurate annotation of electrogram qualities, consistent catheter contact with tissue, distributed sampling of the entire structure of interest, density of location \"points\" in the map, type of rhythm being mapped, direction of activation wavefront propagation, and the size and spacing of the electrodes used to acquire the data. Numerous technologies have been developed or are in development to improve mapping quality and user experience. These include automated chamber segmentation, imported scar delineation from alternative cardiac imaging, such as CMR, CT, and echocardiography, and automated electrogram analysis tools. Ultra high-density mapping catheters have significantly changed the resolution of scar features and, as a result, our understanding of VT circuit physiology. EAM has proven to be a versatile technology to guide treatment of a wide range of arrhythmias. Prospective randomized trials with and without EAM in patients with SVT demonstrate similar acute procedural success rates and substantial reduction in fluoroscopy use [713, 714] . No such randomized trials with and without EAM exist for VAs, and no prospective trial has demonstrated superior outcomes with the use of EAM. It is generally accepted that the use of EAM can reduce fluoroscopy time and allow for more precise mapping, with comparative analyses of nearby locations during VA ablation procedures. Particularly for more complex strategies of mapping ventricular scar, EAM enables the user to perform the necessary mapping to achieve a successful result, which would otherwise be impossible without EAM [36] . For patients undergoing ablation for VA, the use of an approved magnetic navigation system can be useful to reduce fluoroscopy exposure. One small prospective randomized trial comparing magnetic navigation to manual ablation demonstrated reduced use of fluoroscopy without clear differences in procedure outcome [721] . A retrospective case series supported similar conclusions, with a low rate for procedural complication [731] . A multicenter, single-arm study using remote navigation for patients with ischemic VT has demonstrated favorable procedural outcomes of VT noninducibility and longer-term VT freedom rates that are comparable to published results for manual catheter ablation [732] . Several retrospective comparison studies and single-arm series in patients with SHD consistently support reduced fluoroscopy times during the procedure and low rates of procedural complication [722, [733] [734] [735] [736] [737] [738] [739] .

This technology was refined with the addition of temperature sensing and larger tip catheters and further with catheter tip cooling. Lesion depth is limited by the amount of power that can be safely delivered: too much power will result in overheating at the tip-tissue interface and consequent protein denaturation with thrombus formation [744, 745] . Irrigation of the ablation electrode reduces temperature at this interface and allows greater power delivery and thus the creation of larger lesions [746] [747] [748] . Several catheter tip designs and irrigation rates have been made available, each of which generates similar myocardial lesion depth and volume [749] . Some degree of surface sparing is observed with irrigation, more so at higher flow rates and with tip designs that direct more irrigant at the surface [749, 750] . Power delivery, however, remains limited by the risk of deep tissue overheating and steam pops [747] . Catheter tip designs with greater irrigant dispersion might permit lower irrigation flow rates and less volume load for patients with reduced ventricular function. Ablation lesion size increases with the duration of current application [751] , and although short duration applications are sufficient for ablation in thin structures, 60-90 s or longer applications are usually employed for VT. The optimal duration has not yet been defined. Steam pops can occur when excessive heating of myocardial tissue occurs and can occasionally result in harmful tissue disruption [752] . However, the methods for avoiding steam pops are limited. Catheter tip irrigation partially attenuates the correlation between tip temperature and tissue temperature. Steam pops can still occur when tip temperatures rise excessively, although higher flow catheters with more irrigation ports could reduce the incidence of steam pops [753] . Monitoring the impedance could be useful in preventing steam pops, most of which occur when the impedance decreases more than 18 \u03a9 from baseline or when greater power is delivered for longer durations [754] . A typical initial power setting for ablation with an open irrigated catheter in the LV is 30 watts and can be adjusted up to 50 watts to achieve an impedance drop of 10 \u03a9.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 438, "end": 443, "text": "[744,", "ref_id": "BIBREF747"}, {"start": 444, "end": 448, "text": "745]", "ref_id": "BIBREF748"}, {"start": 600, "end": 605, "text": "[746]", "ref_id": "BIBREF749"}, {"start": 606, "end": 611, "text": "[747]", "ref_id": "BIBREF750"}, {"start": 612, "end": 617, "text": "[748]", "ref_id": "BIBREF751"}, {"start": 763, "end": 768, "text": "[749]", "ref_id": "BIBREF752"}, {"start": 922, "end": 927, "text": "[749,", "ref_id": "BIBREF752"}, {"start": 928, "end": 932, "text": "750]", "ref_id": "BIBREF753"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1035, "text": "[747]", "ref_id": "BIBREF750"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1279, "text": "[751]", "ref_id": "BIBREF754"}, {"start": 1607, "end": 1612, "text": "[752]", "ref_id": "BIBREF755"}, {"start": 1948, "end": 1953, "text": "[753]", "ref_id": "BIBREF756"}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2162, "text": "[754]", "ref_id": "BIBREF757"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Unipolar radiofrequency catheter ablation"}, {"text": "Lesion size is critically dependent on the contact of the ablating electrode with the tissue [755] .

Identification of intramural scars is best accomplished by a preprocedural CMR. In the absence of CMR data, intramural scarring is suspected when the endocardial bipolar voltage is >1.5 mV (with 3.5-mm electrode mapping catheters) over the endocardial region that is closest to the VT. If located at the LV free wall, an epicardial origin can be excluded when epicardial mapping fails to identify a VT substrate in the overlying epicardium. The unipolar endocardial voltage can be helpful for identifying deeper seated scar tissue. An LV unipolar voltage <8.3 mV over an area with an endocardial bipolar voltage >1.5 mV is consistent with intramural or epicardial scars; however, electrogram amplitude is also dependent on wall thickness, and there is substantial variability [55, 65, 914, 915] . As indicated in Section 8.5.2, different voltage cutoff values have been reported, and validation studies with CMR-defined scars have demonstrated that there is a substantial overlap of unipolar low voltage between scar zones and regions without scars.

Patients with cardiac symptoms and low LVEF fare the poorest among patients with cardiac sarcoidosis in terms of prognosis and mortality. In contrast, patients with asymptomatic cardiac sarcoidosis and normal LVEF have a 10-year survival rate of 89%-100%. Although only approximately 5% of patients with systemic sarcoidosis have symptomatic cardiac involvement, autopsy and imaging studies suggest that asymptomatic cardiac involvement occurs in 25%-92% of patients [157, 986, 987] . Isolated cardiac involvement has been increasingly recognized; a longitudinal study in Finland found that nearly twothirds of 110 patients with histologically confirmed cardiac sarcoidosis had isolated cardiac involvement. The initial presentation was associated with AV block in 48% of cases and with VT or VF in 38% [986] . The 5-year survival probability for patients with cardiac sarcoidosis treated with immunosuppression has been reported to be as high as 95%, with the greatest benefits seemingly gained by those without severe LV systolic dysfunction (1327, 1331-1333). For patients with cardiac symptoms and low LVEF, the 10-year survival rate is 19%-27% and the cause of death is often heart failure or arrhythmia [157, 986, 987] . These findings suggest that early recognition and treatment could be of value, although there are no randomized trials on this issue. For patients presenting with VT, consideration of cardiac sarcoidosis is important, given the differences in both acute and long-term management, specifically regarding therapy with immunosuppressive drugs [157] . A CMR can be particularly helpful in raising the suspicion of an infiltrative disease process such as cardiac sarcoidosis [988] , and obtaining this imaging is recommended in current heart failure guidelines (COR IIa, LOE B) [518] . Importantly, cardiac sarcoidosis can mimic ARVC, and its involvement can be localized to the RV [157, 344, [989] [990] [991] [992] [993] . There is substantial overlap in the clinical diagnostic criteria for ARVC and cardiac sarcoidosis, including imaging characteristics, identification of epsilon waves, surface ECG characteristics, including signal-averaged ECG, scar distribution, VT morphologies, and other substrate characteristics identified in intracardiac mapping [157, 344, [989] [990] [991] [992] [993] . There are a number of clinically useful findings that can help to differentiate the 2 conditions. In contrast to cardiac sarcoidosis, ARVC rarely involves the septum, and therefore the conduction system is rarely involved in ARVC [992] . The disease process in ARVC also originates in the epicardium, whereas the granulomas in the inflammatory process of sarcoidosis are located within the myocardium and reach the endocardium/ epicardium by extension of the intramural lesions [994] . Reaching a cardiac tissue diagnosis is often difficult because granulomatous infiltration can be patchy, and the yield of b l i n d e n d o m y o c a r d i a l b i o p s y i s < 2 5 % [ 1 5 7 ] .

Although the pathogenesis of cardiac damage is complex and not completely understood, at least 4 possible mechanisms have been suggested: cardiac parasympathetic neuronal depopulation, immune-mediated myocardial injury, parasite persistence in cardiac tissue with secondary antigenic stimulation, and coronary microvascular abnormalities causing myocardial ischemia. Diffuse arteriolar dilatation found in CCM can result in a coronary steal phenomenon of blood flow from epicardial coronary arteries to dilated arterioles, producing low perfusion pressure in the distal microvasculature supplying susceptible areas distal to the coronary branches. The watershed areas between main coronary artery branches would be the most susceptible to this steal phenomenon, causing low perfusion pressure, secondary ischemia, microinfarctions, and reparative fibrosis.

LAVAs thus include standard LPs but also the split potentials (those with an isoelectric interval between components of at least 30 ms) that are not late and even some normal-appearing electrograms for which stimulation might reveal previously unobserved abnormalities. Whereas elimination of LPs has generally been performed on the endocardium, LAVA mapping and ablation requires endocardial and (when possible) epicardial mapping and ablation. Elimination of all LAVAs (the endpoint of this strategy) has been correlated with high rates of freedom from spontaneous recurrence of VT. Problems with this approach include the lack of standard programmed stimulation methods to detect LAVA at sites without these potentials during sinus rhythm, the extent of ablation needed to treat all LAVAs (endocardial and epicardial ablation, the latter might not always be feasible), and the inability to know when all LAVAs had been ablated successfully (sampling bias). Additionally, the mapping catheter used can affect LAVA detection, with small, closely spaced electrodes detecting LAVA and LP more readily than standard ablation electrodes. However, this might necessitate double access to the chamber in question or repeated catheter exchanges. 4) Dechanneling: Using this method, EAM is used to identify sites with high-frequency delayed (not necessarily \"late\") potentials inscribed after a far-field component in sinus rhythm and targets those with relatively short intervals from potential entry sites into channels within scars that can participate in reentry. Endpoints of this \"dechanneling\" approach are the elimination of delayed potentials or reversal of the activation sequence of delayed potentials when recorded with multipolar catheters. VT-free outcomes were better when complete dechanneling could be affected [46] . 5) Substrate homogenization [619] : This strategy is similar in principle to LP and LAVA ablation but more broadly targets the entire region in which low-amplitude (<1.5 mV bipolar) abnormal electrograms are observed with very extensive ablation on both the endocardium and epicardium when abnormal epicardial substrate is identified. The endpoint is electrogram elimination (amplitude reduction to the background noise level or below) and noninducibility of VT. In a small randomized trial of patients with prior MI and a nonrandomized series of patients with post-MI and NICM, VT recurrence was less likely with extensive substrate ablation than with ablation guided by activation and entrainment mapping targeting only the clinical VT [358, 619] . However, it is not known whether this technique would be superior to the targeting of clinical VT(s) plus more limited substrate ablation using the other described techniques. This approach necessarily requires extensive ablation (with more fluid volume administered if irrigated ablation is employed) and potentially longer procedural times. The technique is not applicable to diseases that do not have identifiable lowvoltage scar regions. 6) Core isolation [50, 688] : The principle underlying this strategy is that endocardial VT circuits can be somewhat \"compartmentalized\" by layers of midmyocardial scar tissue, such that conduction is largely spread on the endocardial surface. The encircling of the region with abnormal electrograms that contain the VT circuits need only reach the midmyocardial barrier to isolate the area (ie, damage need not be transmural). In the study by Tzou et al. [50] , core isolation was usually achievable and was associated with improved freedom from VT recurrence compared with a nonrandomized reference group. This approach is not always feasible and requires extensive ablation in some patients. The extent to which these core elements reconnect with healing of the ablation lesions and resolution of the edema is unknown. 7) Imaging-guided lesion assessment: Estimating the acute extent (particularly depth) of ablation-related damage, particularly in normal ventricular tissue, has been shown to be feasible with intracardiac ultrasound [1085] , CMR [1086] , near-infrared spectroscopy [1087] , and by elevations in the pacing threshold [1088] , as well as with other methods. Lesion size assessment has promise for future applications as an indicator of the adequacy of ablation but has not been studied in detail as a procedural endpoint. 8) Identification of a largely anatomically fixed substrate during baseline rhythm by pace mapping [36] and by locating isolated potentials [38] has been beneficial in identifying a critical isthmus. Targeting the arrhythmogenic substrate by combining pace mapping and electrogram mapping has further demonstrated a reduction in VT recurrence in patients post infarction [39] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 42, "end": 46, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 559, "end": 563, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 836, "end": 842, "text": "[1084]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1088"}, {"start": 980, "end": 985, "text": "[684]", "ref_id": "BIBREF687"}, {"start": 3005, "end": 3009, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 3040, "end": 3045, "text": "[619]", "ref_id": "BIBREF622"}, {"start": 3750, "end": 3755, "text": "[358,", "ref_id": "BIBREF359"}, {"start": 3756, "end": 3760, "text": "619]", "ref_id": "BIBREF622"}, {"start": 4223, "end": 4227, "text": "[50,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 4228, "end": 4232, "text": "688]", "ref_id": "BIBREF691"}, {"start": 4661, "end": 4665, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 5243, "end": 5249, "text": "[1085]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1089"}, {"start": 5256, "end": 5262, "text": "[1086]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1090"}, {"start": 5292, "end": 5298, "text": "[1087]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1091"}, {"start": 5343, "end": 5349, "text": "[1088]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1092"}, {"start": 5646, "end": 5650, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 5687, "end": 5691, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 5918, "end": 5922, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Current ablation strategies and assessment of results"}, {"text": "As noted, most strategies also use PES to assess for VT inducibility at the end of the procedure.

Several observations can be made based on available data: 1) Some method of assessing success (prespecified endpoints) should be employed at the end of any ablation procedure for treating VA, insofar as possible (constrained by patient safety considerations). Scarbased reentrant VT usually incorporates PES using 3 extrastimuli at 2 drive CLs from 1 or more RV stimulation sites or at least as vigorous a stimulation protocol as was required to initiate arrhythmia prior to ablation, as well as achieving endpoints particular to whichever substratebased ablation strategy is used. 2) If a \"clinical\" (spontaneously occurring) VT remains inducible at the end of the procedure, the likelihood of postprocedure recurrence is high. 3) Nonclinical VTs induced at the end of an ablation procedure have a recurrence rate during follow-up lower than persistently inducible clinical VTs but higher than if no VT is induced at the end of the ablation procedure. Clinicians should carefully consider the risks and benefits of targeting these nonclinical VTs, which entail longer procedure time and potential risk. 4) It is reasonable to consider using NIPS 2-3 days after ablation to refine the prognosis (see Section 10.4).

Although little has been written on postprocedural management of access sites specifically after catheter VT ablation, practices have been adapted by extrapolating results from other procedures requiring femoral venous or arterial access.

In randomized studies of other electrophysiology procedures comparing manual compression with temporary suture closures or a vascular closure device, comparable high rates of hemostasis had been achieved [1089] [1090] [1091] . Extrapolating these results to ventricular ablation procedures, manual compression is effective in achieving hemostasis, though time to suture that can be removed after achieving hemostasis has been studied after venous access in other ablation procedures, such as for AF, in which procedures are routinely performed on uninterrupted anticoagulation and/or with large-bore catheters [1092] [1093] [1094] [1095] [1096] . Compared with manual compression, temporary suture techniques can yield faster hemostasis and ambulation times and reduce the pain or discomfort associated with hemostasis.

Arterial access after VT ablation is typically closed by manual compression or use of vascular closure devices, with comparably high success rates in achieving hemostasis. Though not specifically studied for VT ablation access closure, manual compression and vascular closure device use have been extensively studied for coronary or structural intervention procedures. Several systematic reviews and randomized trials have demonstrated shorter time to hemostasis, with little need for compression, shorter time to mobilization, and lower hematoma rates with use of vascular closure devices for arterial closure compared with manual compression, with no differences in vascular injury, thrombosis, or infection [1100, 1101] . Extrapolating these results to arterial closure after VT ablation, vascular closure device use could reduce the time to hemostasis and ambulation and reduce the risk of hematoma, compared with manual compression. Vascular injury rates for pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or arteriovenous fistula might be more reflective of insertion difficulties rather than of closure methods.

In one study by Turagam et al. [613] , however, the incidence of cardiac tamponade was 5% vs 1.8% when HS was used in VT ablation procedures. A greater incidence of pericardial effusion is expected in epicardial compared with endocardial approaches [1114] . Possible mechanisms of this complication are cardiac perforation due to overheating, direct trauma due to catheter manipulation, transseptal accident when this approach is chosen, or accident when using a pericardial approach. The level of anticoagulation can also influence the possibility of hemopericardium, facilitating the perpetuation of bleeding. Cardiac tamponade must be suspected if there is a drop in blood pressure; thus, an arterial line for continuous blood pressure monitoring is important, and previous recordings of cardiac silhouette in the left anterior oblique view can be helpful. ICE can help to prevent or quickly detect this complication, allowing earlier initiation of appropriate treatment that might prevent more serious and irreversible consequences. The use of ICE in this setting is discussed in Section 8.6. When pericardial drainage is needed, anticoagulation therapy should be reevaluated, and reversing heparin effects with protamine might be necessary. Percutaneous pericardiocentesis and placement of a pericardial drain are frequently mandatory in cardiac tamponade. The aspirated pericardial blood can be returned to the central vein when the cardiac tamponade is diagnosed during the procedure, although this approach has not been systematically evaluated. The ablation procedure is usually interrupted unless bleeding stops shortly after drainage. In some cases, surgical repair might be necessary if the bleeding is not controlled. After drainage and clinical stability, a pericardial drain should be maintained during the first 24 h, and echocardiography should be used for further evaluation and decisions regarding the timing of removing the pericardial drain.

Prior to sheath deployment, confirmation that the guide wire used for arterial access is indeed in the lumen and not in the arterial wall is important to avoid retrograde dissection of the iliac artery and aorta. This can be accomplished with techniques such as ultrasound or angiography. Furthermore, longer sheaths are preferable in the setting of tortuous peripheral vessels to avoid damage of the vessel wall with the catheter tip. Imaging of the aortic arch (with transesophageal echocardiography or CT) prior to ablation using a retrograde approach could help to identify patients at risk for thromboembolic events in the presence of mobile atheromas or thick plaque material.

These decisions relate to whether to perform NIPS, whether to maintain the patient on an AAD, and how to best program and follow ICDs in patients with such devices. Another important decision after VT catheter ablation is whether to maintain a patient on an AAD, and if so, what medication to choose and for what duration. No RCTs have specifically addressed these issues, and RCTs of VT catheter ablation implemented different protocols related to postprocedure use of AADs (Table 9 ). In 3 clinical trials of VT catheter ablation, preablation AADs (mostly amiodarone) were continued either for 3 to 6 months or for an unspecified period of time [70] [71] [72] 307] . In 3 other clinical trials of VT ablation, the use of AADs post-VT catheter ablation was either discouraged or left to the discretion of the treating physician [309, 317, 318] . In the SMASH-VT trial, no patient received an AAD (other than beta blockers) before the primary endpoint was reached [1123] . Given this variability in the use of AADs post-VT ablation in prior RCTs, there is no standard of care for their use in this scenario; as such, decisions in this regard should be individualized based on patient characteristics and findings of the PES at the end of the VT catheter ablation (or later), keeping in mind the toxicities of these medications and their potential detrimental effects on survival [4] . In particular, given its toxicities, many favor discontinuing amiodarone after ablation.

For randomized trials specifically enrolling patients with high VT burden, the use of reduction in VT burden provides a meaningful endpoint for both patient satisfaction and scientific inquiry.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 100, "end": 105, "text": "[311,", "ref_id": "BIBREF312"}, {"start": 106, "end": 110, "text": "340,", "ref_id": "BIBREF341"}, {"start": 111, "end": 115, "text": "634,", "ref_id": "BIBREF637"}, {"start": 116, "end": 121, "text": "1148]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1153"}, {"start": 509, "end": 514, "text": "[307,", "ref_id": "BIBREF308"}, {"start": 515, "end": 520, "text": "1149]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1154"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Endpoints for prospective clinical trials of ventricular tachycardia ablation"}, {"text": "Further research is required to identify optimal methods for arrhythmia suppression and to understand the influences of each method on arrhythmia outcomes, as well as on cardiac function, symptoms, quality of life [1135] , cost-effectiveness [1150, 1151] , and long-term outcomes.

In patients undergoing epicardial access after systemic heparinization, reversal of heparin with protamine is reasonable. In a survey regarding intraprocedural anticoagulation among the writing committee members, for idiopathic VA, 48% of the responders use ACT levels longer than 250 s, 39% longer than 300 s, and 13% longer than 350 s. For patients with SHD, 25% of the committee members use an ACT target of 250 s, 58% use a target longer than 300 s, and 17% use a target longer than 350 s. The ACT level should be checked at 15-min intervals until therapeutic anticoagulation is achieved, and then at 15-to 30-min in te rv als for the dura tion of t he proce dure. Approximately 90% of the surveyed committee members routinely check for ACT during VT ablation procedures. Most members use either a Hemochron ACT (Instrumentation Laboratory, Bedford, MA) or an i-STAT (Abbott Point of Care Inc., Princeton, NJ) device for ACT monitoring. For transseptal access, heparin should be administered prior to or immediately following the transseptal puncture. More than 70% of the writing committee members surveyed routinely administer heparin before the transseptal puncture, and approximately 20% use a higher target ACT when a transseptal approach is used. Among the writing committee members, 85% use continuous flushing for sheaths, especially if a transseptal approach is used. Heparin infusion can be discontinued once all catheters are removed from left sided chambers. In the event of significant persistent bleeding or cardiac tamponade, protamine should be administered to reverse heparin. In patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or allergy, a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as bivalirudin or argatroban, can be considered as an alternative for intraprocedural anticoagulation; however, limited experience exists in patients undergoing VA ablation[618]. 2.

The approach evolved over time from no steroids to systemic oral or intravenous steroids (1 mg/kg/day for 3 days) to intrapericardial steroids (triamcinolone acetate 2 mg/kg, injected into the pericardial space via a pigtail catheter and left in place by capping of the pigtail). Compared with no steroids, the incidence of pericarditic chest pain was lower with intrapericardial steroids (21.1% vs 58.8%; P = .006), but not with intravenous or oral steroids (43.4% vs 58.8%, P = 0.31).

The use of amiodarone might be reasonable to lower the risk of new-onset AF after epicardial VT ablation in patients with evidence of acute pericarditis. AF is reported to occur in 4.1%-19.5% [1103-1105] of patients after epicardial VT ablation and tends to occur more commonly in those with signs of pericarditis. In the study by Dyrda et al.
