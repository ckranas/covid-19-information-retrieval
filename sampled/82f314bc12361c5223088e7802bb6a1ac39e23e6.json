No drugs specifically targeting RVs are available. We aimed to develop a specific antirhinoviral therapeutic based on DNAzyme technology. Method: A total of 226 candidate DNAzymes were designed against highly conserved regions of RV RNA genome, 5'-untranslated (5'-UTR) and cis-acting replication element (CRE), by use of three representative strains, RVA1, -A16, and -A29. All DNAzymes were screened for their cleavage efficiency against in vitroexpressed viral RNA. Those showing any catalytic activity were subjected to bioinformatic analysis of their reverse complementarity to (coverage of) 322 published rhinoviral genomic sequences. Further molecular optimization was conducted for most promising candidates. Cytotoxic and off-target effects were excluded in HEK293-cell-based systems. Antiviral efficiency was analyzed in infected human bronchial BEAS-2B cells and ex vivo-cultured human sinonasal tissue. Results: Screening phase generated DNAzymes characterized by either good catalytic activity or by high RV strain coverage but no single molecule representing a combination of those two features. Modifications in length of the binding domains of two lead candidates, Dua-01(-L12R9) and Dua-02(-L10R11), improved their cleavage efficiency to an excellent level with no loss in strain coverage (about 98%). Both DNAzymes showed highly favorable cytotoxic/offtarget profiles. Subsequent testing of Dua-01-L12R9 in BEAS-2B cells and sinonasal tissue demonstrated its significant antiviral efficiency. Conclusion: Effective and specific management of RV infections with Dua-01-L12R9 might be useful in preventing asthma exacerbations.",

Cross-reactivity between the different Aspergillus species was indicated by inhibition blots, where A. fumigatus proteins could inhibit IgE-reactivity towards Aspergillus section Nigri allergens. To identify the cross-reactive allergens, inhibition immunoblots were performed with available recombinant allergens of A. fumigatus (Asp f 3, 4 and 6). The fact that Asp f 3 and 6 inhibited IgEbinding to the three low molecular weight proteins allowed identification of these proteins as novel cross-reactive black fungi allergens.",

University of Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia Background: Immune response to helminths shares many features with the allergic response. In tropical regions where helminths are highly prevalent, asthma is still a major public health burden. Large clinical cohorts suggest that high blood eosinophils (HBE=>400 cells/ mm 3 ) are associated with asthma exacerbations. However, the association between HBE and asthma severity in rural communities with prevalent helminthic infections is unclear.",

Although for general application of diagnostic clinical criteria all physicians rated similarly, in general accordance with the MAG suggestions, a third of non-pulmonologist practitioners don't recognize chest discomfort as one of the clue symptoms of asthma, but they erroneously believe crackles are (P = 0.01). We found agreement in almost half of all physicians to erroneously believe that viral illness' induced wheezing in non atopic children predisposes asthma. Conversely, 75-85% are aware that allergic sensitization predisposes to asthma. Most specialists -except pulmonologists (P = 0.02)-incorrectly listed FEV1 as the best parameter to identify airflow obstruction (AO) and FEV1/FVC to assess AO severity. 20% of GPs do not know peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements could be valuable, and 75% of all specialists are not aware that changes in PEF can also be used to confirm AO reversibility.

Logistic regression analysis revealed an association between different questionnaire items and positive allergy tests among suspected cases and diagnosed cases of latex allergy. Approximately 20% of people who work with laboratory animals experience some allergic symptoms and about 10% of animal technicians go on to develop serious symptoms of asthma. UK government guidelines state that employers must prevent or adequately control exposure of employees to animal allergens and should undertake monitoring to ensure that suitable controls remain effective. The most widely used monitoring method is personal IOM filters. However, these need to be attached to a pump and carried by the technician which can be cumbersome and awkward. Previous data has demonstrated that allergens from dust mite, cat, dog and pollen could be captured and quantified by a novel type of nasal filter. In this current study, we sought to assess the feasibility of using the nasal filters for the assessment of exposure to mouse allergen in a laboratory facility.",

Adverse reactions to dental materials were suspected based on subjective complaints in the oral cavity and/or objective conditions of the oral mucosa. Square plastic chambers on hypoallergenic tape were used. Patch tests were applied to the upper back and removed by the patient after 48 hours. Readings were performed 3 and 7 days after application (D3 and D7). Results were evaluated according to the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group guidelines. Positive patch test reactions fulfilled the criteria of at least a one plus (+) reaction on D3 and/or D7. The term \u00bbcontact allergy\u00ab is usually used for such reactions. We prefer the term \u00bbcontact sensitization\u00ab. Clinical relevance of positive reactions to dental materials was not systematically assessed in this analysis. Conclusion: We report a high frequency of positive reactions on D7 that were not seen on D3. This finding demonstrates the importance of an additional late patch test reading in patients with suspected contact allergy to dental materials. Background: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Its etiopathogenesis is not exactly known. It is believed that the disease occurs in people with genetic tendency with the effect of a triggering factor. In some studies it is observed that contact dermatitis in psoriasis is increased with respect to normal population. For this reason it is proposed that allergen materials could trigger psoriasis. In this study it is aimed to determine contact allergy frequency in psoriasis cases using patch test. Results: 62 of the cases were plaque, 5 of them were guttate, 10 of them were palmoplantar and 3 of them were inverse type. More positivity rate is observed in psoriasis cases (26.25%) than control (12%). The positively responsed materials with respect to decreasing number of patients are found as follows: Nickel sulphate (16.25%), thimerosal (7.5%), peru balsam(5%), p-phenylenediamine(2.5%), colophony(2.5%), n-isopropyl-n-fenil-4-fenilendiamin(2.5%), mercaptobenzothiazole(2.5%), benzocaine(2.5%), Most frequently plaque type and following guttate type positive responses are observed in evaluations with respect to clinical types.

Case report: Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is a condition of hypersensitivity to progestogens. It is not an easy diagnosis given the variety of clinical presentations it may have, ranging from eczema, urticaria, erythema multiforme, folliculitis, to angioedema or even anaphylaxis. Manifestations are cyclical, occurring when the levels of progesterone are higher, this is, at the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and disappear during menses, with the physiological decrease of the hormone. It can also be triggered by exposure to exogenous progestins. We report the case of a 49-year-old woman with a cyclical erythematous and violaceous rash related to the menstrual period. The symptoms typically began 4-6 days before the onset of menses and ended 1-2 days before. The diagnosis was based in the clinical history and intradermal skin tests: skin prick testing with levonorgestrel and medroxyprogesterone were negative, but the intradermal skin test with medroxyprogesterone was positive at a concentration of 50 mg/mL. We performed intradermal testing with the same concentration in three other women with no symptoms to exclude an irritative reaction, which were negative. Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is, perhaps, not so rare, but rather poorly recognized and reported, and thus, underdiagnosed. Clinicians should be aware and include always this condition in the differential diagnosis, especially in cases of atypical or intractable skin eruptions.

Rare subcutaneous swellings were considered allergic reactions preventing proper diagnosis.

Clinical history and standard tests may be sufficient to provide an answer, but for many the tests are inconclusive and an oral food challenge is required. This review was undertaken to determine the most accurate tests. Conclusion: These data suggests that peanut SPT and Ara h 2 provide the most accurate prediction of the outcome of oral food challenge in adults.

Results of these analyses also highlight that degree of hydrolysis alone is not sensitive enough to characterise eHFs, and that whilst a high degree of hydrolysis is desirable, further quality control measures are essential to ensure clinically safe and suitable products.

We previously reported that a low-dose OFC can avoid complete elimination, even if patients react to higher doses of causative foods. Nevertheless, this approach has only been validated in a retrospective single-center trial. We have previously reported that the median time for initial symptom onset is 50 minutes for egg OFC using a single exposure. Therefore, this study aimed to confirm the safety and effectiveness of a stepwise single-dose OFC in a multicenter, prospective study. who showed a positive reaction to low-dose OFC, only 1 patient (2%) showed a severe reaction: barking cough immediately improved with adrenaline inhalation. Among 8 patients with a positive reaction to medium-dose OFC, none had a severe reaction. The median times to symptom onset were 60 and 50 minutes following low-dose and medium-dose OFC, respectively.

It faded spontaneously. She didn't recall if she had ever taken that medicine, but denied known drug allergies. Although FDE is primarily a clinical diagnosis, we conducted an oral challenge test with fluconazole (150 mg). Two hours after intake of the drug the patient started complaints of pain and erythema in both hands and the challenge was stopped. Two days after the challenge, she developed red painful erythematous macules on the same sites of the first episode. Due to the specificity of the challenge, local patch testing was not performed.

Similar CD melting experiments revealed that Bla g 1 could bind lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram positive bacteria, but did not interact with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram negative bacteria.

In this way, the results obtained from several immunological assays showed that Alt a 1 is able to produce a response of the immune system through different immune innate receptor pathway inducing the Th2 cytokines. Background: Increasing evidence of cross reactivity syndromes between pollen grains and fruits, with immediate or delayed reactions, has been reported. While some syndromes such as the birch pollen/apple syndrome are well documented, some other such as the cypress pollen/peach syndrome remain to be understood. For the latter, significant progress has recently been made with the discovery of a new allergen family, the gibberellin regulated proteins (GRPs), which has been shown to be responsible for the observed cross reactivity i.e. Pru p 7 and BP14 (1, 2) for the peach and the cypress pollen respectively. GRPs are small cationic proteins with anti-microbial properties and have been shown to be over produced in response to a stress. Herein, the case of a patient, born and raised in the south of France but currently living in Paris, has been studied. This patient has been suffering since childhood from allergic rhinoconjunctivitis to cypress pollen and from some oral symptoms to peach and other fruits (including pomegranate).",

Background: Nine allergens of Phleum pratense have been described until now (IUIS database) and classified into groups based on their function and cross-reactivity. Group 1 and 5 allergens are considered the most immunodominant, due both to their greater IgE-binding capacity and the number of patients IgE-reactive to them.

Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable primary malignant brain tumour with a median life span of less than 15 months despite multimodal treatments. Therefore, there is a serious need for the development of innovative medications. Several epidemiological studies underlined an inverse correlation between pre-existing IgEmediated allergy and GBM risk, where having such an allergy decreased the odds of developing GBM by 20 to 40%. We aim to delineate the intrinsic immuno-biological and molecular mechanisms that can be responsible for these correlations, based on the hypothesis that allergies may promote a state of increased immuno-surveillance in the brain through the presence of immunological factors such as immunoglobulins, cytokines and cells involved in Th2-driven allergic reactions. We consider that as the major immune cell type of the brain, microglia should be implicated in this beneficial association and may favour the elimination of the nascent tumour in brain parenchyma in an allergic context.",

Introduction: Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a systemic disease that may affect all organs, most frequently the ears, noses, throats, sinuses, lungs and kidneys. It is a rare autoimmune disease, also called granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation in small and medium sized blood vessels. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody against to proteinase 3(c-ANCA) is thought to be responsible for autoimmune inflammation. The coexistence of WG and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is extremely rare.

The correlation between the daily grass pollen count and the daily CSMS was analyzed with a mixed effects model accounting for patient-specific correlations and symptom levels. Conclusion: These results confirm a statistically significant correlation between grass pollen counts and the CSMS. Importantly, these findings suggest that the optimal window to observe treatment effects after immunotherapy may be a short interval after start of the GPS and during the peak GPS, due to generally higher CSMS values. This provides sufficient basis to consider additional sensitivity analyses to evaluate the treatment effect of grass MATA MPL SCIT on the primary CSMS endpoint during a shortened window after the start of the GPS and to consider excluding the overlapping period between the BPS and GPS from the primary analysis. 0894 | Combo-VAS as a tool to assess efficacy of allergen immunotherapy Ciprandi G 1 ; Silvestri M 2 ; Olcese R 2 ; Tosca MA 2 1 Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy; 2 Istituto G.

A report of four patients with allergy to ginger Background: Ginger (Zingiber officinale) belongs to the family Zingiberoidae, along with cardamom and turmeric. The edible portion is the horizontal rhizome, and it is very appreciated for its aroma and spicy flavor. It also presents great interest for its therapeutic and culinary use. Hypersensitivity to ginger is rare and has been scarcely reported.

Crocodile meat is a nutritious alternative choice in many countries around the world; however, it has recently been reported to also trigger severe allergic reactions. In these two case reports from 2017 pediatric patients were sensitised to the major fish allergen parvalbumin (PV), a potential cross-allergen. Bony fish contain predominantly PVs of the \u03b2-lineage, which are the most common trigger of allergic reactions in fish allergic patients. In most other vertebrates, PVs of the \u03b1-lineage are most abundant, which have been reported as a causal allergen in frog, cartilaginous fish, and chicken allergies.

In the present study, estimations of asthma severity by researchers were assessed by comparing the concordance between the assessment of asthma control through the GINA 2015 guidelines and the ACT questionnaire Method: Cross-sectional observational study on the evaluation of factors related to treatment that influence the poor control of asthma was assessed through the GINA guidelines and the ACT questionnaire. Patients referred to a pneumologist or allergist by a primary care for the first time were evaluated. Two variables were collected for the assessment of asthma control: one derived from the GINA 2015 guidelines and another derived from the ACT questionnaire.

Results: Of 15 437 asthma patients (mean age 47.8 years, female 62.6%), regular OCS use was identified for 223 patients (1.4%), periodic OCS use for 3054 patients (19.7%), and no OCS use for 12 160 patients (78.7%) 1-year post-index. Regular OCS users had a greater mean age, were more often male, and had greater eosinophil counts, lower lung function, and greater prevalence of comorbidities than did the periodic and no OCS users (P < 0.001). Total yearly cost was greatest for the regular OCS users (\u20ac 5509), followed by periodic OCS users (\u20ac 2892) and no OCS users (\u20ac 2042) (P < 0.001). Among regular OCS users, hospital admissions were the main cost driver (41.5% of total cost), while GP consultations were driving the total cost in periodic and no OCS users (48.0% and 52.9% of total cost, respectively).",

However, the system can only detect IgE against a single allergen, the multiple antigen simultaneous tests has been developed such as the Fluorescence Enzyme Immunoassay View Allergy 39 (VA) or Chemiluminescent Enzyme Assay MAST IV (MA) and both assay detect more than 39 allergen-specific IgE.

Given the absence of term \"BMA\", we selected only the ICSRs of angioedema without associated symptoms evoking another underlying mechanism, such as histamine angioedema (e.g. pruritus, urticaria, rash, etc.). Drug class exposure was \"ACEi\" and \"DPP4i\", considered suspect or concomitant, using the ATC classification. We Results: There was no correlation between mother's disorders such as periodontitis, rhinitis, diabetes etc. and the onset of AR (P > 0.05). A multivariate analysis showed, neonatal jaundice (P < 0.001), respiratory system infection (P < 0.001), diarrhea (P < 0.001), eczema (P < 0.001) in the first 6 months of life and home environmental factors (house decoration (P < 0.001), mold environment (P < 0.001), keeping flowers (P < 0.001), passive smoking (P < 0.001)) increased the risk of AR. Besides, there was no significant difference in current height and birth weight of the participants between AR and control group. However, AR group had significantly lower current weight (P = 0.003) and age (P < 0.001) compared with the control group. Paternal age and maternal age in the AR group were significantly higher than the control group (P < 0.01).",

Specific studies for H2RA are still to be done. In our case we had a negative result for the BAT test, although we proved ranitidine was responsible for the reaction. Conclusion: Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used systemically for septicemia and as prophylaxis during surgery. Immediate type allergy (type I) to gentamicin is rarely reported. Since 2016, approximately only five cases have been reported in literature. In our case, initial theories were pointed towards cefazolin as beta-lactams report a higher rate of allergic reactions.

Results: The status of all patients after DC immunotherapy was evaluated as satisfactory. Heart rate, blood pressure in patients remained within the age norm. Skin had normal color without rash or peripheral edema. There were no local or systemic allergic reactions. The body temperature after the injection did not exceed 37\u00b0C. Conclusion: These results show, for the first time, that among mastocytosis patients, besides the already known periodontal disease risk factors that include diabetes, age, osteoporosis and alcohol consumption, the bone marrow mast cell burden is also associated with increased periodontal disease severity. Results: Metformin at relatively low doses (1-10 \u03bcM) was shown to mildly suppress IgE-mediated responses, including degranulation (34% reduction, P = 0.0135), TNF-\u03b1 (23% reduction, P = 0.0139) and IL-13 (38% reduction, P = 0.0015) secretions in BMMCs.

The effect of house dust mite SLIT was similar between mono-sensitized and poly-sensitized allergic rhinitis children. House dust mite SLIT could also be recommended to polysensitized allergic rhinitis children. Method: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled, multicenter phase II study was conducted with four different concentrations of cluster allergoid CLUSTOID Wiesenlieschgras (group 1: 2000 TU/mL; group 2: 10 000 TU/mL; group 2: 30 000 TU/mL; group 4: 50 000 TU/mL). Out of 103 patients screened, 83 grass pollen allergic patients (18-59 years) were randomized. The cluster build-up phase was followed by four monthly maintenance injections of 0.5 mL. The efficacy was evaluated by the change of the threshold concentration step needed to induce a positive reaction in a titrated nasal provocation test (tNPT) before start and after end of the study (pre-post analysis). The safety profile was assessed for each treatment group by analyzing treatment-related adverse events. Background: Allergen immunotherapy relies on the consistent administration of allergen extract, therefore compliance to these treatments (subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) tablets and drops) is vital for efficacy. As SCIT is administered as an injection by a healthcare professional, and SLIT is self-administered, compliance to SCIT may be perceived as superior. Therefore, a review of real-world studies investigating compliance to SCIT, SLIT-tablets or SLIT-drops was conducted. Real-world studies, instead of clinical trials, were included in this review as they are more likely to reflect actual clinical practice and patient compliance.",

Panallergens occur in unrelated organisms and perform a similar function in them. In their structure, they have highly conserved amino acid sequence regions and a similar three-dimensional structure, and thus meet the requirements for cross-recognition by IgE. Results: In 46 patients (92%) ISAC test has been shown to have specific IgE for panallergen components. Mostly, the presence of IgE for PR-10 proteins has been shown in 41 patients. In 12 patients IgE to LTP; 11 patients IgE to CCD; 6 patients to profilin; 5 patients to tropomyosin; 4 patients to serum albumin, 1 person to TLP. An important aspect is undoubtedly the occurrence of simultaneous sensitization to several panallergens.

Studies have demonstrated that EBT is increased in asthma, proportionately to the level of control of the disease. In an attempt to further increase the usefulness of this approach, we have further developed a device to allow the assessment of the relative contribution of the central and peripheral airways (Caw and Paw).

Blood eosinophil levels are shown to be highly elevated in patients with EA-CRS/NP and have potential for tissue infiltration. We aimed to demonstrate the clinical features of the patients who have a blood eosinophil level above 10% and have thorax computed tomography findings due to blood eosinophilia. Results: We identified 36 patients who met the above criteria. We defined this group as \"Eosinophilic Asthma with chronic Rhinosinusitis and/or nasal polyposis with Radiological findings related to blood eosinophilia\" (EARR). The mean age was 44.9 \u00b1 11 years and 64% was female. Nasal polyps, aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease and atopy was present in 81%, 47% and 25% of the patients, ABSTRACTS | 665 respectively. The mean blood eosinophil count was 1828.6 cells/mm 3 (19%). The majority of EARR patients had upper lobe dominant ground-glass opacities. The mean follow-up period was 3.2 \u00b1 2.5 years. EARR patients did not evolve into eosinophilic granulomatous polyangiitis in the follow-up. Method: We aimed to identify features more probably associated with asthma in a unselected group of patients with diagnostic criteria for ACO. We consecutively selected the first 10 consecutive patients with diagnostic criteria for ACO. All patients were evaluated by accurate clinical history interview, assessment of Asthma Control Test (ACT) and COPD Activity Test (CAT), lung function and exhaled nitric oxide (FE NO ) measurements, sputum cytology, blood eosinophil count, serum total IgE and periostin levels, methacholine and adenosine-mono-phosphate (AMP) bronchial challenges. All these measures were repeated after an oral corticosteroid (OCS) trial of methylprednisolone 32 mg/day for 14 days. We defined 9 parameters that we expected improved after the OCS trial, and therefore considerable as markers of asthma: FEV 1 , FEF 25-75 , FEV 1 /FVC, FE NO , ACT, sputum and blood eosinophilia, methacholine and AMP challenges. Patients with improvement of at least 4 of these parameters after OCS trials were defined as \"responders\" to the treatment, and therefore more likely to be asthmatic than COPD or ACO.",

One study reported a single ITU admission but no other studies reported admissions to ITU. Two studies investigating macrolides reported diary card symptom score and showed antibiotics improved symptoms (MD \u22120.34, 95% CI \u22120.60 to \u22120.08). One study including 40 participants reported more symptom-free days in the macrolide group than usual care. One study of a penicillin including 69 participants reported asthma symptoms at hospital discharge; the between group difference was reported as non-significant. Serious adverse events were rare; 10 events were reported across the three trials (n = 502). The pooled effect estimate for all adverse events from three studies was imprecise (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69-1.43). No deaths were reported. Conclusion: Our results confirmed that omalizumab significantly improves disease control and is a safe add-on therapy.

We already demonstrated in previous allergic rhinitis cohort (ARCO) kids study that stress might be a risk factor for pediatric allergic rhinitis (AR). The aim of this ARCO study is to investigate relationship between stress intensity, symptoms severity and quality of life as well as allergic markers in adult AR patients. Results: As stress intensity increased, the proportion of moderatesevere AR patients was significantly increased. AR patients in high stress group was likely to belong to moderate-severe group (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.01-2.50). Global VAS of AR symptom was 7.0 \u00b1 1.9 in high stress group and 6.7 \u00b1 2.0 in low stress group, respectively. The each 7 RQLQ domain score was significantly higher in high stress group than in low stress group. Total RQLQ scores were 75.3 \u00b1 35.5 in high stress group and 57.4 \u00b1 36.0 in low stress group, respectively. However, as the level of stress increased, there were no significant changes in serum levels of allergic markers.",

However, lipoplexes are quickly captured by reticuloendothelial system cells after the injection and taken out of a blood stream. There are many modification methods of liposomal surface for liposomes with prolonged pharmacokinetic properties production. Addition of hydrophilic polymers (PEG) is seemed to be the most promising approach, that is able not only to create steric barrier on the particle`s surface and prevent the interaction with blood plasma lipoproteins, but also inhibits the protein adsorption, opsonisation and subsequent degradation in human body. The aim of this study is the evaluation of liposomal surface modification by hydrophilic polymers influence on nucleic acids`lipoplexes conjugation and on their physico-chemical and biological properties.",

Eighteen minutes after starting an infusion with oxytocin (15 mL/h) and a vaginal toucher, the patient developed a decreased level of consciousness, generalized edema/erythema and thoracic pain, followed within 3 minutes by fetal bradycardia and maternal collapse. After resuscitation, an urgent sectio was performed, and a baby girl was born. Patient was extubated the same day. Serum tryptase, 1 hours after the event, was 11.2 \u03bcg/L (basal tryptase level 3.4 \u03bcg/L). Allergy workup demonstrated negative specific IgE and skin tests for latex and chlorhexidine, negative skin and provocation testing for ropivacain.

The pathogenesis remains incompletely understood, however, it has been suggested that AFE involves an anaphylactic reaction to fetal tissue exposure associated with breaches of the maternal-fetal physiological barrier, supported by transiently increased serum tryptase levels. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, and generally one of exclusion. No specific antemortem diagnostic tests are available to confirm AFE. Postmortem identification of fetal squames in the maternal pulmonary circulation gives final diagnosis. Differential diagnosis includes drug-induced anaphylaxis or mastocytosis, which were ruled out in our case.

Background: Multiple sclerosis is a debilitating autoimmune and degenerative condition of the central nervous system, that predominantly affects young adults. Both genetic and environmental factors are associated with increased risk for this disease. We propose that the effect of environmental factors, particularly latitude of childhood, is mediated through epigenetic mechanisms. Specifically, we propose that unfavourable gene methylation predisposes individuals to multiple sclerosis, that this is set in childhood and adolescence, and transmitted from haematopoietic stem cells to progeny.",

The physiological basis underlying the setting of this epigenetic signature is still to be elucidated, but may involve UV light and/or vitamin D, and may provide novel therapeutic targets, especially at a personalised level, for treatment of MS. Background: Auto-inflammatory diseases are rare disorders characterized by recurrent episodes of fever/inflammation affecting serosal surfaces, joints, eyes and skin without autoantibody production or an underlying infection. Innate immunity is implicated in their pathogenesis and the underlying genetic defect has been identified in a fraction of the syndromes. During last years, the increased knowledge about auto-inflammatory diseases and the difficulty in their characterization aroused great interest to better understand these pathologies.",

It causes myotonia, progressive muscles atrophy, muscular weakness, and problems at the heart's conduction tissue and at the respiratory muscles. In patients with myotonic dystrophy, hypogammaglobulinemia is frequently described. The associations and the pathogenesis between those affections are not totally clear, but it is recognized an increased catabolism of the immunoglobulin in these patients. In most of the cases, hypogammaglobulinemia affects only the IgG class and does not become clinically manifest. However, replacement treatment is not always successful in these patients.

The tropics has climatic, environmental and ecological peculiarities that allow us to emit several hypotheses that could explain this phenomenon. In one of them, it is postulated that the increase of the sensitization to food, is due to the presence of lower serum levels of vitamin D, product of the adoption of a western lifestyle, with lower sun exposure, which in its turn diminishes the immunomodulatory action of this vitamin at intestinal level, favoring the sensitization against food antigens.

Background: In proven cases of non-IgE mediated cow's milk allergy clinical response can be partial even when treated with amino acid formulae e.g pain in infants. Residual intestinal symptoms can be related to ongoing nerve hypersensitivity, changes in microbiome or motility disturbance. Mast cells are thought to play crucial role in non-IgE mediated food allergy. Ketotifen is a first generation H1 antihistamine which has mast cell stabilising properties with pain blocking and anti TNF-a effect. Hence ketotifen could have important role in symptom resolution where diet elimination has not been successful. We aim to find out effectiveness of ketotifen to unresponsive/partially responsive symptoms such as pain in non-IgE mediated cow's milk allergy infants.",

Wheat allergy seems to be rarely investigated in our center and may deserve more attention. Case report: Eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs), including eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EoG), are a inflammatory diseases, characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms and eosinophilic infiltration. Patients with EoE have an increased incidence of allergy, with increased IgE mediated food and inhalant sensitivities. Use of either a targeted food allergen avoidance approach (based on allergy testing) or untargeted approach (based on food allergen avoidance) results in the resolution of eosinophilia in the gastrointestinal tract of 50%-70% of adult. We describe a case of a 27-year-old patient diagnosed with eosinophilic enteritis, associated to protein-losing enteropathy. The patient experienced severe diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and weight loss, that caused a severe dysproteinaemia and electrolytes abnormalities. An upper and lower endoscopy was performed, showing an ulcerative ileitis. The histological pattern was characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of ileum and duodenum>40 HPF. She presented also high levels of total IgE (800 K/UI), high serum tryptase (20 \u03bcg/L, n.v. \u22649.0) and sensitization to the lipid transfer protein (LTP) of peach. The patient was prescribed to a six-food elimination diet (SFED) and underwent high doses of oral and intravenously corticosteroids, but a satisfactory therapeutic response was not achieved. We hypothesized that IgE has a role in the mechanism of AEG and that blocking IgE would have improved disease symptoms and reduced allergic inflammation, as measured by a decrease in intestinal tissue eosinophilia. We started off-label administration of omalizumab 300 mg/month subcutaneously, the same dosage schedule used in allergic asthma and, by other authors, in eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease after achieving informed consent by patient. Except for an exacerbation of symptoms occurred 9 months after starting the therapy, when a further endoscopy, showing a gastrointestinal eosinophilic infiltration>50 HPF, was performed, a significant improvement of both gastrointestinal and cutaneous symptoms was observed during therapy, together with a normalization of laboratory parameters. After 30 months a clinical remission of disease was obtained and administration was stopped. Although a histological remission during the first few months of treatment was not obtained, in a subset of AEG patients, IgE plays a role in the pathophysiology of the disease and that anti-IgE therapy with omalizumab may result in disease remission.",

However, being a \"novel food\" in the industrialized part of the world, several safety aspects, like allergenicity, need to be thoroughly addressed. In the present work we evaluated the cross-recognition of IgE from patients allergic to crustaceans, house dust mite or stable flies, using house cricket Acheta domesticus (AD), desert locust Schistocerca gregaria (SG) and mealworm Tenebrio molitor (TM).

Implant failure has a significant impact on patient's quality of life and a diagnosis of hypersensitivity is important to prevent further re-exposure. Case Report: We present the case of a 64-year-old woman who underwent total right-hip replacement. Days after the surgery, she developed pain at the site of the implant (with no other apparent signs or symptoms), which increased gradually during the following 10 months. At this time, imaging studies revealed loosening of the femoral stem. She underwent a new replacement surgery and during the post-op she developed an intense local inflammatory reaction of the surgical wound, without fever, and which improved under antiinflammatory therapy. After the surgery, she re-initiated pain at the site of the implant. Imaging studies revealed loosening of the femoral stem and a PET scan showed hyperfixation at the site of the femoral stem component of the prosthesis, suggesting aseptic displacement. The patient was referred to Immunoallergology and Dermatology Departments for evaluation. Patch tests (Chemotechnique Diagnostics) with Portuguese standard series, metal series and acrylate series showed a positive reaction for chromium at day 4 and 7. Evaluation showed presence of chromium solely on the femoral stem portion of the prosthesis (27-29%).Conclusion: Following arthroplasty, the persistence or early reappearance of inflammatory symptoms should raise suspicions for hypersensitivity. These patients should be promptly evaluated to prevent new surgeries and placement of implants with the relevant components. However, hypersensitivity is a diagnosis of exclusion and non-allergic causes should be excluded in advance.",

It was found that the optimal values of the PEG molecular mass are in the range from 1000 to 4000 Da. Too short PEG molecules can not provide a significant increase in the circulation time of particles in the bloodstream, which is the main goal of pegylation method. On the other hand, too large molecules of PEG (with a molecular weight of 5000 Da or more) sterically interfere the interaction of liposomes with the target cell, penetration into the cell and further release from the endosomes. PEG 2000 is thought to be the most suitable substance for prolonged liposomes creation.Method: Liposomes were prepared from thin lipid layer of lipopeptides and PEG derivatives. Particles size distribution was defined by means of photon-correlation spectroscopy. Transfection activity was detected with luciferase assay.Results: Liposomes based on lipodipeptide OrnGlu(C 16 H 33 ) 2 and lipotripeptide OrnOrnGlu(C 16 H 33 ) 2 were obtained. Each type of liposomes was modified by addition 5% (by mass) of PEG 2000 (37-46 units in length) or PEG 3400 (68-77 units in length) derivative during thin lipid bilayer preparation step. The photon-correlation spectroscopy data showed that PEG addition does not affected the size of liposome particles significantly regardless of the PEG units' amount. It was found, that all pegylated liposomes possess lower transfection activity than non-modified ones. However, liposomes containing long PEG derivatives on their surface tend to have bigger decline of transfection efficiency. PEG 2000 conjunction leads to decrease in activity only 2-3 times, while the PEG 3400 addition decreasing the activity index more than 5 times. Conclusion: Thus, it was confirmed that 2000 Da is an optimal molecular mass to form sterically stabilized liposomes, which would not influence the gene drug transfection too much.

He proceeded to the emergency room where hypotension (BP 70/30) was documented, and attributed to a vasovagal event. His symptoms resolved following treatment with IV fluids. Subsequently, he had several episodes of flushing, chest pain, and tachycardia, which resolved spontaneously. In 2013, he was admitted to hospital after sudden onset of visual changes, flushing, diarrhea, hypotension and acute renal failure, all presumed to be secondary to myocardial infarction. In 2014 he developed urticaria and was assessed for mastocytosis. Urinary leukotrienes were found to be elevated though his baseline serum tryptase was normal. Examination of bone marrow revealed a clonal population of spindle shaped mast cells, which were KIT D816V mutated establishing the diagnosis of MMAS. Despite treatment with Cetirizine, Ranitidine, Hydroxyzine, Montelukast, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) the patient continued to experience urticaria on a daily basis, in addition to episodes of anaphylaxis. Upon initiation of treatment with Omalizumab there were no further episodes of anaphylaxis and a significant reduction in urticaria. Cetirizine, Hydroxyzine and Montelukast were discontinued. We attempted to increase the interval between injections to 5 and then 6 weeks, but this resulted in recurrence of episodes of flushing, diarrhea and hypotension. Maintained on Omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks, the patient has remained asymptomatic. Owing to the rarity of these conditions, there is a paucity of evidence examining effective treatment for mast cell activation disorders, including MMAS. Treatment recommendations are typically individualized for patients depending on the affected organ systems and severity of symptoms. These may include H1 and H2 blockers, montelukast, ASA and corticosteroids. In a recently published cohort of 13 patients with systemic mastocytosis, 11 reported improvement in their symptoms following treatment with Omalizumab, with no severe adverse reactions observed. Omalizumab should be considered as a treatment option in patients with mast cell activation disorders, particularly those who are recalcitrant to other therapies. Given the rarity of these disorders, collaboration and communication are essential in optimizing management of these challenging patients. In Germany, approximately 800.000 people suffer from chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). According to the current German guideline, biologicals can be used for treating refractory forms of this disease. Studies targeting the patient-centred care of individuals suffering from this often serve dermatologic disease in a non-hospital environment and possible barriers in the use of biologicals are extremely rare.Method: In order to analyse the current patient-centred care with respect to guideline-compliant use of medication and possible barriers, all Bavarian office based dermatologists (n = 499) received a questionnaire within the framework of a non-interventional crosssectional study. They were selected using the database of the KVB (Kassen\u00e4rztliche Vereinigung Bayerns) and supplemented using the webpages of the selected physicians.

Boletus edulis is the most commonly distributed mushroom in Belarus and Eastern Europe. The aim of the investigation was to compare the effects of Reishi, Shiitake and Boletus mushrooms on dendritic cell (DC) and T-cell immunophenotype.Method: Reishi, Shiitake and Boletus mushroom extracts (0.5% w/v final concentration in the culture media) were used. Monocytederived DC (n = 6) and T-cells (n = 9) isolated from human whole blood were stimulated for 24 hours with mushroom extracts. PMA was used as positive control and PSB as negative control (C). Expression of CD69 and HLA-DR by T-cells and CD80, CD205, CD206 and HLA-DR by DC were assayed by flow cytometry.Results: Aqueous extracts of all the studied mushrooms increased the expression of CD69 by human blood T-cells (3) %; Shiitake-5.7(3.9-9.6)%; P < 0.02 for all), while the expression of the HLA-DR remained intact. Reishi and Boletus extracts induced 2.5-fold increase of the CD205 expression by DC, while the changes in the expression of CD206 were statistically insignificant.",

The mean baseline score of the control group was 16.78 and the mean score of week 16 was 14.43. The results show a significant decrease in the of score in AST group compared to control group (P = 0.0001). Conclusion: This study shows that the patients receiving the AST had better results with DLQI questionnaire compared to the group receiving antihistamine which means the AST group had major improvement in life quality compared to the group taking the first line of treatment. This shows the efficacy of AST as a new and lowcost treatment in patients not responding to antihistamines and as potential substitute for next line treatments such as omalizumab. Allergic rhinitis (AR) and allergic asthma are chronic diseases characterised by inflammation of the upper and lower airways in response to allergens such as pollen. Both diseases are typically managed with symptom-relieving pharmacotherapy, which does not treat the cause of the disease. Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) treats the underlying disease, but is only available to individuals who are unable to adequately manage their symptoms using pharmacotherapy. This study aimed to generate estimates of actual healthcare costs and resource use for patients with AR and patients with asthma, prescribed and not prescribed AIT. Method: Anonymised data for all German National Health Insurance beneficiaries insured by the AOK PLUS (Saxony) from January 2005 to December 2014 (N = 1 739 440) were retrieved. For cohorts of patients with prevalent AR (prescribed AIT: n = 17 289; not prescribed AIT: n = 57 353) and asthma (prescribed AIT: n = 3460; not prescribed AIT: n = 30 902), mean annual costs of pharmaceutical treatments (2005, 2010, 2014) and inpatient costs (2010 and 2014) were calculated, including and excluding the cost of AIT. Patient groups were not mutually exclusive. Results: In all years, mean annual costs of pharmaceuticals were lower in AR patients who had been prescribed AIT (2005: \u20ac467; 2010: \u20ac523; 2014: \u20ac543) than those who had not (2005: \u20ac487; 2010: \u20ac656; 2014: \u20ac714).

When the AIT pharmaceutical costs themselves were subtracted, this difference was more pronounced, with the lowest mean costs of non-AIT pharmaceuticals at \u20ac47 for patients with AR and \u20ac470 for patients with asthma (AR prescribed AIT, 2005: \u20ac47; 2010: \u20ac336; 2014: \u20ac348; asthma prescribed AIT, 2005: \u20ac470; 2010: \u20ac696; 2014: \u20ac615).

No relevant difference in tolerability and safety was found between the gentle up-dosing scheme A and the schemes B or C, which used only the highest strength solution. 0896 | Compatibility of an accelerated dose escalation with a high-dose, hypoallergenic birch pollen allergoid Pl\u00fcckhahn K; Akboga Y; Fox G Allergopharma GmbH & Co. KG, Reinbek, Germany Background: Subcutaneous specific immunotherapy (SCIT) with a high-dose birch pollen allergoid is an effective and tolerable treatment method. This study examines the safety and tolerability of a dose escalation scheme reduced to 4 injections with a hypoallergenic birch pollen preparation. Frequency and severity of adverse events were comparable in both treatment arms. Local reactions occurred in 54.0% of patients in the accelerated and 56.7% of patients in the standard dose regimen. Systemic reactions occurred in 6.3% of patients in the accelerated and in 3.0% of patients in the standard dose regimen. More than 85% of the patients as well as the investigators rated the accelerated dose regimen as good to very good tolerated. Conclusion: The accelerated dose regimen with a high dose, hypoallergenic birch pollen allergoid provides an additional safe dosing regimen for patients suffering from an allergic rhinoconjunctivitis with or without bronchial asthma. Treatment of adult patients with the hypoallergenic birch pollen preparation can be initiated about 4 weeks before the pollen season. 0897 | Updated safety analysis of a high-dose hypoallergenic birch pollen allergoid from clinical trial data Mayer F; Akboga Y; Kettner J; Fox G Allergopharma GmbH & Co. KG, Reinbek, Germany Background: Subcutaneous high-dose hypoallergenic allergen immunotherapy (AIT) using a birch pollen allergoid has been wellestablished for decades in birch-pollen specific immunotherapy of allergic rhinitis and asthma. Recently performed new clinical trials prompted a reappraisal of the overall safety data pool from clinical trials. Method: 800 patients diagnosed for grass pollen allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (+/-) asthma were included in 3 randomized, controlled trials. The pooled active safety set (PASS) comprised all patients receiving active AIT via the standard dose escalation scheme (7 injections) either as preseasonal or perennial treatment for a maximum of 3 years. Adverse events (AE), adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as well as routine biochemical and hematological laboratory safety parameters were analysed. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA 19.0) terminology was used throughout for coding with recoding of AE terms from lower MedDRA versions where appropriate. All codes were assessed to their primary system organ class (SOC). Results: 304 (159 female, 145 male) patients with a mean age of 36.8 years and a mean duration of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis of 13.3 years were included in the safety analysis. 83 (27.3%) Patients were diagnosed for having bronchial asthma at study entry. of patients, n = 69). No notable differences in changes of laboratory measurements following AIT compared to placebo were observed. Conclusion: The updated overall analysis of safety data from randomized, controlled clinical trials confirmed previous analyses of clinical trial data and was found in accordance with the long-term experience from the use of the high dose hypoallergenic birch pollen allergoid in the market. 0898 | Safety of ultra-rush schedule of subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy with house dust mite extract in patients with atopic dermatitis conducted in an outpatient clinic Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea; 2 Younsei-Ajou Pediatric Clinic, Gwang-Ju, South Korea Background: Ultra-rush schedule of subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy (UR-SCIT) administering maximum maintenance dose of allergen extract within one-day can save time and effort in patients with allergic diseases. However, UR-SCIT is associated with an increased risk of systemic reaction compared to conventional subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy and is usually conducted in a hospital admission setting. To overcome these limitations of UR-SCIT, we evaluated the safety of one-day UR-SCIT in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) conducted in an outpatient clinic. Method: UR-SCIT was performed in 421 patients with moderateto-severe AD sensitized to house dust mites (HDM). A maximum maintenance dose of tyrosine adsorbed HDM extract (1 mL of maintenance concentration) was divided into 4 increasing doses (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mL) and administered to the patients by subcutaneous injections at 2-hour interval for 8 hours in an outpatient clinic. Systemic reactions associated with UR-SCIT were classified according to the World Allergy Organization grading system. Results: Systemic reaction was observed in 8 of 421 patients (1.9%) during UR-SCIT. Severity of systemic reaction was grade 1 in 5 patients (1.2%) and grade 2 in 3 patients (0.7%). Severe systemic reaction (grade 3 to 5) was not observed. Prescheduled 4 increasing doses of HDM extract could be administered in 420 of 421 patients except one patient who experienced a systemic reaction at 1.5 hours after the first dose injection. Systemic reactions were observed within 2 hours in 7 patients and at 5.5 hours in one",

            "text": "Background: Development of targeted drugs with selective antitumor activity is a global challenge. Earlier, cationic peptides (CPs) with high apoptosis effectivity for cutaneous melanoma cells were specially designed. Probable cellular targets for CPs are chaperone proteins nucleolin/C23 and nucleophosmin/B23 involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, molecular transport, signaling, transcription, ribosome biogenesis, etc. C23/D23 are overexpressed in most of tumors, C23 molecules are receptors for many ligands including endostatin, a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. Receptor C23 activation is likely effected by the interaction of the cationic cluster of endostatin and anionic cluster of C23. Proposed mechanism of C23/ B23 interaction with CP is similar. Objective is to analyze the cytotoxicity mechanisms of CPs with different molecular structure.Method: 8 CPs with different charge and molecular mass were synthesized by solid phase method using the Fmoc-protective strategy, their structures were confirmed by HPLC and MALDI-MS. Human tumor cell lines of cutaneous melanoma-melIS, melH; glioblastoma-Glb-Sh and Glb-17; ovarian cancer-CrovCel; multidrug-resistant breast cancer HBL-100/Dox; hepatocarcinoma -Huh7; 4 pancreatic cancer cell lines-Panc1, MiaPaCan2, AsPc1, CaPa2; renal cancer -Rpoch1-\u041a\u041a and control fibroblast line H1036 were studied. CP R 8 K 4 K 2 KAC-NH 2 was labelled fluorescently by Cy5 for visualization in cells. For western blotting and immunohistochemical assay (IHA) proteins p53, C23/B23 were labelled by commercial mAbs. Results: High cytotoxicity of 5 CPs in relation to all tumor cell lines was found. Cell viability was varied as 8-25%, while cytotoxicity was not detected in control. Analysis by RT PCR, blotting and IHA has revealed the high expression of C23/B23 and encoded genes NCL/ NPM in all tumor cell lines under study. The level of NCL gene expression before the incubation with CPs was 8.5 times higher than in normal cells, for TP53 gene it was 2.8 times lower. After 3-day incubation, the level of NCL gene expression drops sharply, and p53 gene increases 2.5-fold. Tumor cell apoptosis induction was proved by cytofluorometry with labeled caspases 3, 8, 9, DAPI and H\u00f6chst staining. Conclusion: Possible mechanism of selective cytotoxicity of CPs is a competitive interaction with C23/B23 after intracellular transport, subsequent accumulation of p53 via MDM2 negative regulation capacity and apoptosis. 0904 | Inflammatory mediators in the nasal lavage of patients with allergic rhinitis before and after specific immunotherapy with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus extract after specific nasal challenge Rodrigues AT; Ramanholo BS; Brugnolli RM; Neto EC; Kalil J; Galv\u00e3o CE Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Background: The Allergic Rhinitis is the clinical expression of the link between the IgE-antibodies and antigens in the nasal mucosa resulting in inflammation. In daily practice, There are patients with a clinical picture suggestive of allergic rhinitis, but who do not present specific systemic IgE. Some of these patients have local specific IgE and are diagnosed with local allergic rhinitis. There are authors who advocate the use of immunotherapy in these cases. However, little is known about the changes produced by immunotherapy in the nasal mucosa of patients with RA who present systemic specific IgE. Our objetive was to determine the local inflammatory response by examining the nasal lavage fluid after nasal challenge tests of patients with allergic rhinitis before and after treatment with specific allergen immunotherapy to house dust mite for a period of 6 months using the standard inflammatory Th1/Th2 and Th17 responses. Method: We selected patients sensitized to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus diagnosed with persistent allergic rhinitis and performed the collection of pre and post nasal lavage fluid after nasal challenge with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. After 6 months of treatment and placebo the patients were reevaluated. We performed the analysis of the Th1/Th2 and Th17 cytokines responses.Results: We analyzed 19 patients in the immunotherapy group and 17 in the placebo group. The dosage of the free cytokines in nasal lavage were not significantly changed by 6 months of immunotherapy, but it was observed an increase in the levels of IL-13, IL-10 after nasal challenge in both groups; there was also a significant increase in GM-CSF levels in both groups.",

Results: The particle size distribution profiles of the twenty batches were comparable shown by the obtained dv values: dv(0.5): 20-28 \u03bcm (mean: 23 \u03bcm), dv(0.1): 10-13 \u03bcm (mean: 11 \u03bcm) and dv(0.9): 36-56 \u03bcm (mean: 44 \u03bcm). The SEM images revealed that the visible particles consist of tightly agglomerated small primary particles with a subvisible size of 16-20 nm. Hence, the visible particles in the suspension are agglomerated primary particles. Conclusion: The results offered a detailed insight into the formation, structure and size distribution of the visible particles in an aluminum hydroxide based SCIT product. High-resolution SEM uncovered the nanostructure of the visible particles which are based on primary particles. The close insight into the particle morphology offers the possibility to elucidate variations during drug product development and routine manufacturing. The low batch-to-batch variation regarding the morphology and size distribution of the adsorbate particles demonstrated the high reproducibility of the production process. A drug product of high quality is crucial for a consistent and successful therapy. 0942 | Development of an inhibition-assay for the determination of specific IgG reactivity of allergoid-based allergen preparations Sch\u00f6nknecht C; Reese G; Stock M; Scharff V; Willers C; Augustin S Allergopharma GmbH & Co. KG, Reinbek, Germany Background: Chemically modified allergens, so called allergoids, are reduced in their IgE-binding reactivity but still contain structural features mandatorily needed for T cell recognition and the formation of the allergen-specific IgG antibodies. The Guideline on AllergenProducts demands the use of animal sera based potency assays to verify the IgG reactivity of allergoids. Therefore, in the present study a microtiter plate based inhibition-assay was to be developed, to determine the relative specific IgG activity of allergoids and aluminum-adsorbed-allergoid-based allergen preparations (manufactured from pollen of grasses, birch, mugwort and olive).Method: The established immunological method consists of allergoid-reactive polyclonal antibodies, a secondary antibody and HRP/ TMB as detection system. The allergoid-preparation in the soluble phase of the assay competes with the allergoids coated on the surface of the microtiter plate for the binding of the anti allergoid-antibodies. The relative potency of the allergoid-preparation is inversely proportional to the optical density determined in the assay and is calculated as the relation of the dilution factor at 50% inhibition of sample to reference (Prel_DF). For further evaluation of the method for routine the parameters linearity, accuracy, precision, reproducibility and robustness have been assessed.",

Although RA is uncommon (likely-10% of patients with asthma), clinical characteristics and risk factors for the development of the condition has to be details to improve management of affected individuals. The aim of the present study is to characterize RA by comparing with non-RA. Method: 131 patients with \"problematic asthma\" (female: 67, mean age: 49 years) were recruited in our Allergy Outpatient Clinic over a 2-year period, between July 2015-June 2017, presenting the diagnostic criteria for RA included continuous requirements for systemic corticosteroid or high dose inhaled corticosteroid to maintain control (Innovative Medicines Initiative -2011). For each patient, we recorded anamnestic data, respiratory function, body Mass Index (BMI), presence and type of comorbidities. Serum IgE and complete blood count (CBC) were obtained while disease control was stable. Results: 14 patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of RA. Patients with RA displayed significantly lower FEV 1 /FVC compared with patients with non-RA (P = 0.012). Reversibility to B 2 agonist tended to be lower in patients with RA. The CBC showed higher percentage of neutrophils (P = 0.0081) for RA patients.

CARAT is the only control of asthma tool that reflects control of AR. However, cut-points of the asthma and AR subscale of CARAT are unknown. From a clinicians point of view the purpose of the upper cut-point (between controlled vs partlyis to confirm uncontrolled disease. This is similar in structure to the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ). The aim of the current study is identifying the cut-points of the CARAT asthma subscale to differentiate between controlled, partly controlled and uncontrolled asthma using the ACQ. Method: Asthma patients from the Netherlands, Greece and Portugal completed CARAT together with the ACQ. Decisions were based on NPV\u2265.850 for the upper cut-point and on PPV\u2265.850 for the lower cut-point, supported by: Area Under the Curve (AUC), sensitivity (SS), specificity (SP), percentage correctly classified patients (PCCP). Results: Data from 653 asthma patients (49.3% with rhinitis; ACQ: 46.7% well controlled, 17.3% partly controlled, 17.5% uncontrolled; 35.4% men, mean age 51.6 yrs), suggested an upper cut-point of 14.5 (SS 83%, SP 79%, AUC 0.891, PCCP 80.8%, PPV 76%, NPV 86%) and a lower cut-point of 8.5 (SS 46%, SP 99%, AUC 0.93, PCCP 87%, PPV 88%, NPV 87%). The characteristics of the AR group did not meet statistical demands to result in a AR cut-point. Conclusion: We defined cut-points of 14.5 (to exclude uncontrolled disease) and 8.5 (to confirm uncontrolled disease) for the CARAT asthma scale. Further analysis should reveal cut-points for the AR subscale. 1001 | The use and willingness of asthma patients toward mobile phone functionalities in support of self-management , Faculty of Medicine Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran; 2 Assistant Professor, Health Information Management Research Center, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran; 3 Professor, Health Information Management Research Center, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran; 4 Ms student, Health Information Management Research Center, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran Background: Information technology-based interventions such as mobile health have potential to enhance self-management in Patients with chronic illness through the provision of supports (e.g., information, education, and reminders). An important factor in successful implementation of mobile health interventions is the positive attitude of users, especially patients, towards these interventions.

Regular use of OCS puts patients at risk for systemic corticosteroid-related complications (e.g., osteoporosis and diabetes). The aim of this study was to investigate the total cost of health care resource utilization for asthma patients in Sweden with different dosages of OCS. Method: Patients in primary care, \u226518 years of age with a record of a drug claim for obstructive pulmonary diseases (ATC R03) during 2007-2009, and a physician-diagnosed asthma (ICD-10 J45-J46) established prior to drug collection were identified (index). Patients with a concomitant diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (ICD-10 code M35.3) or rheumatoid arthritis (ICD-10 code M05) were excluded. Primary care medical records data were linked to national Swedish health registries. Patients were classified by their OCS claims from pharmacy during 1-year post index (baseline): regular OCS (\u22655 mg per day); periodic OCS (<5 mg per day); and no OCS (no OCS claim).

Method: In this study, 103 children with asthma aged 7-18 years were enrolled in the pneumology clinic. The imaging evaluation of the bronchopulmonary lesions in children was performed by thoracic computed thoracic HRCT (Aquilion 32, Toshiba, Japan). Results: The pulmonary imaging assessment of children with asthma detected 1.94% of cases of bronchiectasis. These children were diagnosed with severely uncontrolled asthma. In the first case, the child was diagnosed at age 9 with mixed bronchiectasis in the lower left pulmonum (segments 8, 9, 10). At the age of 14 he is undergoing surgery: lower lobectomy on the left. Subsequently, the condition of the child with improvement and the evolution of bronchial asthma became controlled, spirometric indices and quality of life improved. Another child diagnosed with uncontrolled severe BRCA at 7 years of age has been confirmed to have bilateral mixed bronchiectasis in the lower lobes. After the combination of antiasthmatic treatment with gastroesophageal reflux disease therapy and treatment for bronchiectasis, partial bronchial asthma control was achieved, and then the evolution to controlled bronchial asthma. Conclusion: The presence of bronchiectasis in children with bronchial asthma causes a severe evolution and absence of control of the disease. Control of asthma can be obtained after the treatment of bronchiectasis and comorbidities. 1011 | Alternaria alternata sensitization and clinical manifestation at the children of preschool age Sharikadze O; Okhotnikova O Shupyk National Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Kyiv, Ukraine",

All children had no any signs of acute respiratory infection and did not receive antibiotic therapy prior to the examination. Asthmatics were on inhaled corticosteroids therapy with no differences in total equivalent dose. For the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae/Chl. pneumoniae infections we determined specific antibodies classes A, M, and G using ELISA test systems SeroMP/SeroCP (Savyon \u00ae ). Chi-square with Yates correction and two-sided Fisher's exact tests were used. Results: The presence of IgA and IgM against both M. pneumoniae and Chl. pneumoniae were associated with poor asthma control (Table 1). The uncontrolled asthma group exhibited threefold increase in proportion of children with IgA presence against intracellular respiratory pathogens, a good serological marker of chronic course of M. pneumoniae/Chl. pneumoniae infection. Conclusion: Chronic M. Pneumoniae/Chl. Pneumoniae infection is associated with poor asthma control in children. We suppose that intracellular respiratory pathogens may be involved in the asthma pathogenesis through the induction of inflammation. On the other hand, asthma itself and/or inhaled corticosteroids therapy may predispose to activation of chronic intracellular infection. 1014 | Determinants for asthma control, quality of life and use of complementary and alternative medicine in asthmatic pediatric patients in four cities Leung TN 1 ; Hon KL 2 1 The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR; 2 The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR Background: Asthma is a significant chronic health problem worldwide. Management aims at disease control by reducing functional impairment and exacerbations and improving quality of life (QoL). We report a multi-center study to survey asthma control and QoL in four cities in the Pearl River Delta Region of Southern China. Method: The conjoint survey involved 10 Hong Kong pediatric hospitals/units, 2 Shenzhen hospitals, 2 Macau hospitals and 2 Guangzhou hospitals on asthma control (using Asthma Control Test, ACT) and QoL (Pediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire, PADQLQ). Acceptability of a treatment is graded as very good/good/fair/poor. Results: Good asthma control was only reported in 80% subjects in Hong Kong but higher in sister cities (85-94%, P < 0.001). Allergic rhinitis, \"incense burning\" and \"smoker in family\" were prevalent among the four cities. Logistic regression showed better control of asthma was associated with better PADQLQ (B = \u22120.029, P < 0.001), better acceptability of bronchodilator (B = \u22121.488, P = 0.025), negatively with \"smoker in family\" (B = \u22120.83, P = 0.015) and various PADQLQ domains.

Therefore, the search for methods of prevention of respiratory tract infections in children who have not been successfully treated for asthma is of particular importance. The aim of the study was to determine the clinical significance of polyvalent mechanic bacterial lysate (PMBL) treatment in children with uncontrolled asthma.Method:The study data were obtained from the patient's medical records and the physical examination of the children. The assessment of the quality of life of a child with asthma was made using the Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire-PAQLQ and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ or ACQ-IA) was used to estimate asthma control. Children were evaluated at the time of inclusion in the study, after 3 months of additional therapy and after 6 months from its completion.Results: In the years 2014-2015 a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 78 children aged 6-16 years who were treated with SABA on demand and ICS (inhaled corticosteroids) or iCS+LABA for chronic IgE-dependent asthma. The population consisted of 26 girls (33%) and 52 boys (67%) with an average age of 9.73 \u00b1 2.6 years. Statistically, PMBL group and the placebo group did not significantly differ ().

Ole e 7, a non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) from olive pollen, is a major allergen responsible for severe symptoms such as anaphylaxis in extensive regions with high olive pollen counts. Despite the clinical relevance of this allergen, its cloning has been impossible since the late 90's mainly due to its high polymorphism, what prevented the analysis of the implication of Ole e 7 in cross-reactivity.The aim of this work consists of determining the whole Ole e 7 amino acid sequence by proteomics for its subsequent cloning, expression and analysis of its structural and immunological features.Method: Ole e 7 purified from olive pollen was separated by 2DEgel electrophoresis, in-gel digested with trypsin and analyzed by nLC-MS/MS in an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos for de novo peptide sequencing. The obtained peptides were used to complete the full-length amino acid sequence of Ole e 7. After optimizing the codon usage for the production in Pichia pastoris yeast, the DNA codifying for Ole e 7 was synthesized and used to produce the recombinant protein. Once purified to homogeneity, a comprehensive immunological analysis by ELISA and immunoblotting, and an analysis of the release of allergic mediators in cell-based assays (RBL-2H3 mast cell model and Basophil Activation Tests) using sera and blood of allergic patients' sera.",

The D. pteronyssinus grown in the aseptic medium were unusually bacterium-free in contrast to the other two species. The concentration of endotoxin derived from the extract of mites was confirmed and the results corresponded to the distribution of the microbiota. Conclusion: The microbiota of three species of mites grown under the same conditions is different. Endotoxin, derived from microbiota, is an adjuvant of allergens and affects allergic reaction. Endotoxin concentrations were high in D. farinae and T. putrescentiae, which corresponded to the distribution of microbiota, but endotoxin concentrations were very low in D. pteronyssinus with few bacteria. 1037 | Validation of air sampling technique for control of Fel d1 levels in cat allergen exposure chamber Trials Inc., Ottawa, Canada; 2 Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada Background: Cat allergen can cause a significant allergic response in affected patients. Monitored exposure to cat allergen, Fel d1, can provide a better understanding of patients' allergic responses in a controlled environment. However, controlling the allergen level in the chamber remains challenging. Previous work evaluated the use of fans and blanket shaking as a means to aerosolize the cat dander. It was found that blanket shaking provided more consistent levels of airborne Fel d1 over a period of time. The purpose of this study is to standardize and validate the blanket shaking technique to provide controlled levels of Fel d1 in the chamber for future cat allergen exposure studies. Method: The Natural Exposure Chamber, with a volume of 520 ft 2 (14.7 m 3 ), was designed and built to accommodate two neutered cats and 1 to 2 subjects at a time. To quantitate Fel d1 levels, three surface swabs, using glass fiber filters (Milipore), were collected from the chamber walls and floor. Air samples at 4 L/min were collected at four different locations in the chamber using portable air cats' blanket was shaken for 1 minute every 15 minutes just before sampling start. The average of all the tests performed show stabilized air concentrations of Fel d1 in the cat chamber with 44.12 \u00b1 39.34 ng/m 3 in the first procedure and 39.17 \u00b1 24.36 ng/m 3 in the second procedure. Conclusion: The obtained results demonstrate controlled levels of Fel d1 in the Exposure Chamber validating the air sampling techniques which will be used for future clinical studies. 1038 | Prevalence of skin sensitisation to pollen of salsola oppositifolia in the east coast of Spain Ramirez Hernandez M; Lopez-Barnes IM; Carre\u00f1o-Rojo A; Pajaron-Fernandez MJ; Huertas-Amoros AJ Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain Background: The first aim of this study was to know de prevalence of skin sensitisation to pollen of Salsola oppositifolia in patients with pollinosis residing in the area of Cartagena, in the East Coast of Spain.

Panallergens comprise a variety of protein families of plant and animal origin and are responsible for wide IgE cross-reactivity between different allergenic sources. The most important panallergens are lipid transfer proteins (LTP), profilins and PR-10 (pathogenesisrelated proteins). The aim of this study was to describe the LTP and PR-10 allergen sensitization in Georgian allergic patients. Method: 221 allergy patients were studied by ImmunoCAP-ISAC-112 microarray analysis (Thermo Scientific, Sweden), among them 47 patients with atopic dermatitis, 80 with allergic rhinitis and 51 with asthma. Prevalence of sensitization to LTP and PR-10 was calculated with 95% confidence interval. Associations were assessed by the Fisher's exact test.

No eliciting factors were evident. His past medical history as well as his family history was unremarkable. Skin prick tests with common inhalant allergens were negative. Hemogram, VS, standard chemistry, coagulation study, viral markers (HIV and HCV) and thyroid function were normal. However, a complete IgG / lambda monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance was detected.The myelogram did not present a characteristic phenotype of multiple myeloma. The skeleton X-ray were normal. The urticaria was resolved with antihistamine (Bilastine 20 mg/day) as well as moisturizer and he has remained asymptomatic.Clinical relevance: The association of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) in patients with chronic urticaria (CU) may have multiple isotypes and it may sometimes represent a variant of Schnitzler syndrome. In this patient, MGUS was diagnosed during the workup of another disease. It is difficult to differentiate a pathogenic relationship from a coincidental one. Nonetheless, MGUS is one of the most common pre-malignant disorders and therefore, appropriate follow-up with malignancy screening is warranted.Chronic urticaria associated with paraneoplastic syndromes is relatively rare but it is important to document these cases in order to increase their awareness. Orolingual angioedema associated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration in stroke patients is a rare, but potentially life-threatening side effect, with a incidence between 0.2% and 5.0%. It typically manifests as a mild, transient facial swelling, but may cause fatal airway obstruction in around 13% of those developing tPA-related angioedema. tPA activates plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn degrades fibrin but also converts factor XII into its active form. Thereby factor XIIa activates the plasma contact pathway and stimulates the production of bradykinin. Bradykinin increases vascular permeability potentially resulting in angioedema.Treatment with ACEi, blocking the degradation of bradykinin, is recognized as the main risk factor for occurrence of tPA-induced angioedema. However, no uniform guidelines exist on how angioedema in this setting should be treated or whether a relative contraindication would be imperative in those with recent episodes of ACEi-induced-angioedema and a minor indication for thrombolysis.Case Report: A 63-year-old male presented with sudden onset of vertigo, dysarthria and temporary loss of consciousness, since <1 hour. Home medications included Lisinopril. Clinical examination was normal, except an abnormal Romberg's test. Head CT scan and angiography were negative and tPA was administered for a potential stroke. A lip and tongue swelling was noticed 10 minutes after tPA.The infusion was stopped. Methylprednisolone, ebastine and tranexamic acid were administered. 15 minutes later, rapid progression towards orofacial angioedema, stridor and respiratory distress was observed, next to an urticarial rash. Epinephrine was administrated.However, collapse due to asphyxia occurred, necessitating an urgent tracheotomy and resuscitation. The angioedema resolved. The patient left 4 days later. From hindsight, the patient reported previous episodes of angioedema that was attributed to ACEi use. C1esterase-inhibitor deficiency was excluded. Familial history was negative for angioedema. Serial serum tryptase levels were normal arguing against anaphylaxis.Conclusion: A case of life-threatening angioedema after tPA, presumably bradykinin-mediated, is reported. Prior ACEi-inducedangioedema should be considered as a potential relative contra-indication for tPA and treatment guidelines for this reported severe side-effect, potentially including tranexamic acid, icatibant and C1esterase-inhibitor, are mandatory.",

A patient aged 72 years presented to our clinic complaining asthenia and weight loss of about 10 kg in the last two years. She had episodes of abdominal colicky pain and colonic diverticulosis. She also had proteinuria and stage 2 of chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate of 79 mL/min) and severe osteoporosis. Due to clinical history, blood count alterations (anemia, lymphopenia, hypereosinophilia and thrombocytosis) and hepatosplenomegaly she carried out haematological evaluation.Method: In the diagnostic assessment, it was decided to perform an bone marrow biopsy and blood samples were taken for genetic studies by next-generation sequencing.Results: Bone marrow biopsy showed an increase in the myelopoietic and megakaryocyte series with regular maturation and distribution. In addition there was the presence of spindle-shape cells. Immunohistochemistry showed CD117 (c-KIT) positivity, highlighting the presence of aggregates of mast cells as well as individual mast cells, with the interposition of rare eosinophilic granulocytes with a predominantly trabecular location. For this reason the patient was tested for serum tryptase which was increased to 80 ng/mL. The search of C-Kit mutations on peripheral blood showed the presence of the D816V mutation with the co-occurence of JAK2 (V617F) mutation. Conclusion: These findings appear compatible with the concurrent diagnosis of chronic myeloproliferative syndrome and systemic mastocytosis (systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematological neoplasm SM-AMENM). This condition had been very rarely reported in the literature, being associated with a severe prognosis. The patient is now on chronic therapy with Oncocarbide with discrete benefit on both conditions. It also was given anti-H2 antihistamine, adrenaline, 25-OH cholecalciferol therapy. Aim of this work was to investigate the role of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in metabolic syndrome (MetS) and their association with metabolic syndrome components. Method: We have investigated serum concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines such as, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in 68 patients with metabolic syndrome compared to those 52 patients without MetS by ELISA kits from 2016 September to 2017 June. Metabolic syndrome was defined by the Harmonized definition of the MetS. Laboratory data and anthropometry parameters were measured. All data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. Results: The initial socio-demographic characteristics of patients with and without MetS did not differ statistically. There was a significant increase of IL-6 (P < 0.05), IL-1\u03b2 (P < 0.01), and TNF-\u03b1 (P < 0.001) in MetS subjects compared to those without MetS. Among components of the MetS, abdominal obesity (AO) LDL-cholesterol and fasting glucose positively correlated with IL-6 (r = 0.572, P = 0.035; r = 0.468, P = 0.041; and r = 0.417, P = 0.045 respectively). Only AO (r = 0.367, P = 0.032) and LDL cholesterol (r = 0.395, P = 0.040) positively correlated with IL-1\u03b2.

Rare but recognized associated with lymphoproliferative diseases. Due to expansion of B cell clones producing anti -C1 INH antibodies, anti C1q antibodies, due to the underlying disease. Reduced or deficiency of c1 -inhibitor leads to activation of the classical complement path way leading to secretion of bradykinin which increases vascular permeability and induces angioedema. Case report: A 65 year old female with asthma presented with first episode of lips an tongue angioedema. With no family history. No obvious trigger. On investigation lab results were normal including normal cell blood count liver enzymes, renal function test and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Due to no response to antihistamine adrenalin and corticosteroid treatment, complement parameters were checked to rule out bradykinin induced angioedema. Presented with low C4 and low C1 esterase inhibitor activity including low C1q, suspecting antibodies production. Computed tomography scan of chest and abdomen was normal. Due to recurrent episodes of angioedema further investigation was preceded with bone marrow aspiration which revealed infiltration with B cell low grade lymphoma. Adult onset angioedema nonreactive to standard therapy should prompt physicians to suspect underlying lymphoproliferative disorder despite normal labs. One should order C1 esterase and C1q levels and if low precede further investigation including bone marrow aspiration. 1082 | Dealing with the itch associated with allergen skin testing without an antihistamine?

In the 2014 the T-score was \u22122.4 for the Lumbar Spine and \u22121.8 at the Hip (osteopenia). In 2015 the condition worsened, leading to a diagnosis of osteoporosis (T-score Spine \u22122.6 and T-score Hip \u22122.2), so he was started on therapy with Zoledronic Acid (ZA) 4 mg every 28 days for four consecutive months in association with Paracetamol, Corticosteroids and Protonic Pump Inhibitor to prevent drug-induced reactions. The results were successful and in 2017 he was switched to therapy with ZA 5 mg/year, a more convenient mode of administration, that is being administered without adverse effect and with a good outcome and increase in bone density. Conclusion: The patient responded well to BP first, with an improvement in bone mineral density and resolution of bone pain.According to what has been found in the literature, a single 5 mg ZA intravenous infusion in patients with osteoporosis secondary to indolent SM is associated with significant increases in spine and hip bone mineral density, and with decreases of bone turnover markers over at least 1 year.

For several years, she presented crises of abdominal pain associated with vomiting, greater intensity in the premenstrual period. An evaluation in general practitioner with colonoscopy, upper digestive endoscopy and pelvic magnetic resonance, did not reveal alterations. After 9 years of absence in the IA outpatient department, she restarted treatment with Stanozolol 2 mg daily, with progressive improvement. A crises of intense abdominal pain took her to the Emergency Service of her residence area. Initially, acute surgical abdomen was excluded. She performed abdominal ultrasound, that showed globose and swollen pancreas with heterogeneous and hypoechoic structure, without other alterations. Analytically, C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased-17.3 mg/dL, with no other alterations in the remaining analytical parameters (hemogram, liver tests including lipase and amylase). She was treated with several analgesic drugs (Acetaminophen, Butylscopolamine, Metamizole and Tramadol) without improvement, complete improvement of pain occurred only after the administration of C1 inhibitor. The patient repeated abdominal ultrasound 24 hours after with visualization of the pancreas and spleen without anomalies and moderate amount of free fluid in the Morrison space and PCR was also normalized. 72 hours later, she was totally asymptomatic and was discharge with the diagnosis of abdominal crisis of HAE due to therapeutic failure.Conclusions: Abdominal crises with pancreatic involvement are rare. Its pathophysiology is uncertain, but it is thought to be secondary to edema of the pancreatic duct or Vater's ampulla, followed by obstruction of the same. HAE should be considered as a possible cause of pancreatic edema/pancreatitis and C1 inhibitor/Icatibant may be a fast-acting therapeutic option.

Chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a common nasal disease globally and in China that is histologically characterized by persistent inflammation and irreversible structural remodeling in the sinonasal mucosa. Current treatment strategies involve surgery. However, recurrence remains a major challenge and is largely mediated via the inflammatory reaction. Berberine (BER), a traditional Chinese herb, is used in the treatment of infection, allergies, and cancer. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of BER on the regulation of inflammatory responses in CRSwNP for the purpose of determining whether BER could be used to prevent relapse.Method: Sixty-four patients who had been diagnosed withCRSwNP were enrolled in the study initially (n = 33 in the treatment group and n = 31 in the placebo group). None of the patients had received any prior treatment for CRSwNP. Patients in the treatment group received oral BER 0.3 g at each time, twice per day for 30 days before surgery and did not use intranasal corticosteroids, oral or topical antihistamines, or oral glucocorticoids during the study period. Polyp tissues were collected at the time of diagnosis and after surgery. Histologic staining, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to detect the levels of cytokines and immune cells.Results: BER reduced the expression of the cytokines interleukin in polyp tissues of patients in the treatment group compared with levels in tissues of patients in the placebo group (P < 0.05). In addition, the eosinophil distribution was reduced significantly in polyp tissues of patients in the treatment group (P < 0.05). Overall, recurrence was detected in 9% (3/33) of patients in the treatment group compared with 32.3% (10/31) of patients in control group during a 10-month follow-up.Conclusion:The results of this study suggest that BER may be an effective therapeutic agent for preventing the recurrence ofCRSwNP.BER on the regulation of inflammatory responses in CRSwNP for the purpose of determining whether BER could be send to prevent relapse. Medicine, Chuncheon, South Korea; 3 Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Boramae Medical Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea Background: The evidences of osteitis are frequently observed in the patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), especially in the recalcitrant cases. However, the studies focusing on biological markers of osteitis are limited, and it is still not clear whether the osteitis is differently associated with the various phenotypes of CRS. Method: Patients with CRS without nasal polyps (n = 27) or CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP, n = 47) and control (n = 9) were enrolled. Clinical information and CT scores, histologic phenotypes were investigated. The clinical parameters (Global osteitis score) and molecular marker of bone remodeling, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) are analyzed in each type of CRS. CRS mice models was tested using anti-RANKL. Results: Global osteitis score (GOS) was significantly higher in all CRS vs control. GOS in non-eosinophilic CRSwNP was higher compared to eosinophilic CRSwNP. Osteitis was dominant in maxillary sinus of non-eosinophilic CRS vs in ethmoidal sinus of eosinophilic CRS. Moreover, high GOS in non-eosinophilic CRSwNP was associated with high score of postoperative endoscopic findings. Bone remodeling marker RANKL was upregulated in CRS and mRNA expression was positively correlated with Lund-Mackay CT score and GOS. A potent RANKL inducer IL-22 and neutrophils-associated markers (MPO and CXCL2) was associated positively with RANKL protein level in CRS. In mouse CRSwNP model, anti-RANKL treatment abrogated neutrophil recruitment in nasal mucosa. Conclusion: Clinical osteitis is present in CRS and CRSwNP, with more clinical significance in non-eosinophilic CRSwNP. RANKL is well-correlated with clinical osteitis and disease severity in CRSwNP. These findings shed light on the importance of RANKL as a potential biomarker of CRS and a key player in CRS pathogenesis. 1096 | The analysis and study of allergen features in chronic rhinosinusitis with or without polyps Meng C; Gao G; Cui N; Zhao C; Sha J China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China Background: Allergen features were compared in the two subtypes of CRS: chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps(CRSwNP) and chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps(CRSsNP). The Allergen features were compared in the two subtypes of CRS. To study the distribution features and clinical significance of allergens in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis(CRS) and chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps(CRSwNP).The analysis was performed in 187 cases of CRS and CRSwNP. Differences of allergens features of CRS were analyzed, and they were compared to the allergens of 65 patients with allergic rhinitis(AR). Results: The total allergen positive rate in CRS was 49.8%. The allergen positive rate, distribution proportion of inhaled and food allergens, distribution proportion of allergens subsets, distribution proportion of single and multiple allergens between two subtypes of CRS had no significant difference(P > 0.05). The major allergens of CRS were single inhaled allergens(72.3%). Some CRS patients were allergic to food allergen (8.6%). The minority allergens of CRS were a mixture of inhaled and food allergens (7.2%). Compared to AR, the distribution proportion of inhaled and food allergens (\u03c72 = 17.81, P < 0.001), the distribution proportion of allergens subsets (\u03c72 = 15.51, P < 0.001), and the distribution proportion of single and multiple allergens(\u03c72 = 9.727, P < 0.001) had significant difference. Conclusion: The allergen positive rate of CRS is much higher than the prevalence of allergic diseases in general population, suggesting that allergic factors may be closely correlated to the pathogenesis of CRS. The clinical features of allergens are similar in the two subtypes of CRS, while there are significant differences in allergen distribution between CRS and AR patients. The detection of allergens may be helpful in prevention and treatment of CRS. 1097 | MP-AzeFlu for management of allergic rhinitis symptoms in patients \u226565 years: A post hoc efficacy and safety analysis from three pooled phase LR EIP on AHA, Montpellier, France; 2 Allergy & Asthma Medical Group and Research Center, San Diego, Ca, United States; 3 Mylan Inc., Bad Homburg, Germany; 4 Mylan Inc., Canonsburg, Pa, United States Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is common among older adults, and medication efficacy and tolerability may vary with age due to comorbidities and interaction with other medications. Intranasal MP-AzeFlu (azelastine hydrochloride [AZE] and fluticasone propionate [FP]) has proven to be an effective treatment for AR.

School of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea; 2 Seoul National University College of Medicine, Boramae Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea; 3 Hallym University College of Medicine, Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital, Chuncheon, South Korea Background: It is well known that obesity is associated with asthma, particularly severe and uncontrolled asthma. However, there are few studies about the relationship between rhinosinusitis and obesity. The aims of this study are to determine whether obesity is associated with surgical outcome for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP) and to elucidate differences in cytokine profiles according to body mass index (BMI). Method: A total of 338 patients (151 obese and 187 non-obese) with CRSwNP who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) between Jan. 2014 and Apr. 2017 were enrolled in this study. Preoperative demographic data, computed tomography (CT, -obese). Protein levels were measured by Multiplex cytokine analysis kits and ImmunoCap \u00ae . Comparative analysis was performed according to the presence or absence of obesity (BMI \u2265 25 kg/m 2 ) and the classification of eosinophilic nasal polyp (ENP) or non-eosinophilic nasal polyp (NENP).Results: There was no significant difference in tissue eosinophilia, preoperative CT score, endoscopic score, and SNOT-22 scores between the obese and non-obese group. However, SNOT-22 scores were worse in the obese group at 3 and 6 months after ESS (P = 0.037, 0.005 respectively). In plasma, BMI positively correlated with leptin, IL5, and IL10 and negatively correlated with adiponectin.The level of leptin and CCL11 in nasal polyp tissue was elevated in the obese group compared to the non-obese group. Leptin, CCL11, and IL5 were elevated while adiponectin, CXCL1, and CXCL2 were decreased in the obese group compared to the non-obese group in NENP, but not in ENP.Conclusion: Obese patients with CRSwNP had worse quality of life after ESS. These worse outcomes might be associated with an increased level of eosinophilic mediators in NENP.",

For example, patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) are often also diagnosed with asthma, and among these individuals, untreated AR is associated with poorly controlled asthma and higher rates of asthmarelated exacerbations and emergency department (ED) visits. In contrast, treatment of AR is associated with fewer exacerbations and ED visits. This retrospective cohort study examined the correlation between the use of medications to treat AR and the concomitant use of asthma medication.Method: Individuals were identified from the Danish National Prescription and Patient Registries who, during the pollen seasons April-July of 2013-2015, received a first-time prescription (INCS+OAH; prescriptions within \u22647 days of each other), or INCS followed by add-on OAH (prescriptions >7 days apart). Patients were included in the analysis if they also received a prescription for asthma \u226415 months prior to the first AR prescription. The primary endpoint was change in asthma prescriptions during the 15 months following the first AR prescription (analyzed using t test). The correlation between specialist consultations and asthma prescriptions was also examined.Results: Of the 6733 individuals who met all inclusion criteria, 161 received MP-AzeFlu, 1583 received INCS+OAH combination, and 1176 received INCS and add-on OAH. In the 15 months following the initial AR prescription, prescriptions for asthma in the MP-AzeFlu cohort increased nonsignificantly by 0.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: \u22120.1-1.7; P = 0.082). Conversely, asthma prescriptions in both the INCS+OAH and INCS/add-on OAH cohorts increased, respectively, by 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0-2.5; P < 0.001) and 1.9 (95% CI: 1.6-2.3; P < 0.001). No correlation was observed between specialist consultations and change in asthma prescriptions. Findings were similar when the data were analyzed by individual year. Conclusion: Treatment with MP-AzeFlu was associated with a substantially smaller increase in asthma prescriptions than treatments with INCS and OAH. These findings suggest that MP-AzeFlu may provide better control of AR, contributing to improved control of asthma. 1101 | Berberine treatment reduces symptoms of allergic rhinitis: A randomized double-Neurosurgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, ChinaBackground: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common nasal disease worldwide and in China specifically, and although it is not a fatal disease, the symptoms can be severe and greatly diminish patients' quality of life, possibly by even negatively impacting behavior, learning, and memory. The current standard therapy includes intranasal corticosteroids, oral and topical antihistamines, and an oral glucocorticoid. Unfortunately, these pharmacological treatments only control the symptoms of AR temporarily and have low therapeutic effectiveness for many patients with resistance. Moreover, long-term use of these agents can result in serious side effects. Therefore, the development of a new herbal drug for AR treatment would be of great benefit to patients. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of berberine (BER) against the symptoms of AR in patients. the drug with respect to alleviating AR symptoms (rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal obstruction and itchy nose) was evaluated through patient-provided visual analog scale (VAS) scores (range, 0-10) before administration and at the end of the treatment period.Serum IgE levels were checked at the time of diagnosis and the end of intervention.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with and without nasal polyps represent different stages of one chronic inflammatory disease of the mucosa of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. The cause of nasal polyp disease remains controversial. The aim of our study is to understand the role of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), serum tryptase, total and specific IgE (phadiatop) in assessing of different therapies of nasal polyposis. Method: The study included 70 patients, who were diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. All patients consulted by allergologist. The patients were split into two groups. The first group (35 patients) received only intranasal corticosteroid sprays, and the second group (35 patients) received intranasal corticosteroid sprays combined with intramuscular corticosteroid injections. All patients were under observation for 80 days, during which the clinical status of the patients was evaluated, and in the end, laboratorial tests were retaken. Results: In the first group, there was a decline in TIgE in 12 patients. (34.2%, P < 0.01), Tryptase in four patients (11.4%, P < 0.01), ECP-11 patients (31.4%, P < 0.01) while Phadiatop was not altered in any patient. In the second group, there was a decline in TIgE in 22 patients (62.8%, P < 0.01), Tryptase-14 patients (40%, P < 0.01), ECP-18 patients (51.4%, P < 0.01) and Phadiatop-6 patients (17.1%, P < 0.05). Conclusion: We concluded that the patients who were received both intranasal corticosteroid spray and systemic intramuscular corticosteroid therapy showed better clinical improvement than the patients who were received only intranasal corticosteroid spray therapy.

By 2050, mortality from antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria is projected to increase to 10 million people per year, which will exceed the death rate from cancer. Mutations in bacteria occur faster than new antibacterial drugs are marketed. In search of effective protection against infections, new strategies and approaches are being developed, one of which is the use of activators of innate immunity combined with etiotropic chemotherapy. Method: Muramyl peptides that are part of the peptidoglycan cell walls of all known bacteria, and regularly formed in the body during the decay of microflora are the natural regulators of immunity. Results: When interacting with intracellular receptors of innate immunity, they trigger a signaling cascade of reactions that induces the expression of a large number of genes, in particular, the genes of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon), acute phase proteins, inflammatory enzymes (NO synthase and cyclooxygenase), molecules of the main histocompatibility complex. The result of the activation of the receptors of innate immunity is the body's reaction, manifested in the enhancement of the antimicrobial function of neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages, increasing the cytotoxic activity of macrophages, natural killers (NK cells) and T-killers, which eventually leads to the elimination of the pathogen. Muramyl peptides induce the synthesis of colony-stimulating factors and thus activate leukopoiesis, restoring the disturbed balance of blood cells. Conclusion: Thus, muramyl peptides are involved in stimulating all forms of anti-infective protection of the body: phagocytosis, cellular and humoral immunity, as well as hemopoiesis, regulating all links of the immune system. The report discusses clinical studies of drugs based on muramyl peptides in the treatment of immune disorders, allergy, infectious and oncological diseases. 1116 | The effect of respiratory syncytial virus infection on the accumulation of nuocytes in lung tissue of allergic mice Center-Institute of Immunology FMBA of Russia, Moscow, Russia; 2 Mechnikov Research Institute for Vaccines and Sera, Moscow, Russia Background: IL-33 extend their effect on the innate lymphoid cells type II-nuocytes. Nuocytes produce IL-5 and IL-13 which play an important role in allergic bronchial asthma (BA). Previously we showed that IL-33 expression was increased in lung tissue of mice infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and in mice with RSVinduced BA exacerbations. The aim of the study was to assess changes in nuocytes amount using the mouse model of RSV-induced BA exacerbations. Method: Female BALB/c mice were divided into four groups: mice with induced BA (1st group), mice with RSV-induced BA exacerbations (2nd group), mice with RSV infection (3rd group) and intact mice (4th group). BA was induced by i.p. injections of ovalbumin allergen (OVA) mixed with aluminum hydroxide on days 0, 14, 28, followed by i.n. OVA challenge on days 42-44. During induction of BA mice were infected with RSV strain A2 in dose of 5 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 on day 40. Third group of animals was treated with RSV only. IL-33 gene expression and viral load in lungs were evaluated by qPCR. Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) was measured by non-invasive plethysmography. Accumulation of nuocytes were assessed in lungs and spleens by flow cytometry. Results: All three groups demonstrated significant increase in AHR compared to intact mice. RSV infection was confirmed by qPCR, allowed to detect 2-7 \u00d7 10 6 viral genome copies/1 \u03bcg of total RNA isolated from lung tissue. Histological analysis revealed predominantly eosinophil infiltration after OVA sensitization and lymphocyte infiltration in animals treated with RSV only. The mice received OVA followed by RSV infection demonstrated both eosinophil and lymphocyte infiltration into the lungs. IL-33 gene expression in lung tissue measured by qPCR was significantly increased (1.5-1.7-fold) in the lungs of infected mice (groups 2 and 3). Despite that, these groups did not show increased numbers of nuocytes in lung addition, the levels of activated nuocytes were elevated in lungs and spleens of mice with BA only. Conclusion: We didn't confirm the hypothesis that nuocytes are activated under RSV infection. A significant increase in the number and proportion of activated nuocytes in the lungs and spleens was observed in mice with BA phenotype.

As sensing of the intestinal microbiota by the host mucosal immune system is important to induce protective immune responses, modification of the gut microbiota might be able to support health and to prevent or treat allergies. Hence, we aimed to investigate the effects of synbiotics on the differentiation of human immune cells in the context of grass pollen allergy. Method: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from grass-pollen allergic patients and healthy controls were stimulated in vitro with grass-pollen extract and supplemented with different synbiotics. T helper cell subset differentiation was examined by flow cytometry and the measurement of cytokines in culture supernatants. Results: In contrast to non-allergic controls, in grass pollen-allergic individuals, stimulation with grass pollen extract induced proliferation of Th2 cells. The addition of synbiotics, containing different probiotic strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and fructooligosaccharides as prebiotic supplement, regulated the immune response of allergic individuals on the T helper cell level. A shift from an allergic Th2-driven immune response towards a Th1 immune phenotype was observed.This effect was mediated directly by synbiotics as well as indirectly by \"only\" culture supernatants of the probiotic bacteria.Conclusion: Taken together, the presence of synbiotics showed an immune-modulating capacity via suppression of Th2-type inflammation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of grass pollen-allergic individuals. Hence, these effects of synbiotics on the host immune response might implicate a potential approach to modify allergic immune responses. Further studies might give an insight into the regulatory mechanisms of specific compounds derived from probiotics, which suppress the Th2-driven immune-phenotype.",

There is a blocking of inducible expression of TLR4 and EGFR receptor genes in cells with myelomonoblastic leukemia. Chemokine CXCL12 leads to a twofold increase in the chemotaxis of MNCs in healthy donors and TLR-mediated induction of expression of the genes of the chemokine receptors CCR4 and EGFR is observed in these cells.Conclusion: CXCL12 reduces the chemotaxis of tumor cells in patients with myelomonoblastic leukemia and also the expression of EGFR and TLR4, leading to tumor regression, as a decrease in chemotaxis leads to a decrease in metastasis, and a decrease in expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor and TLR4 leads to a decrease in proliferation. The role of DNA and RNA ligands in the MNC of healthy donors is twofold: on the one hand, inhibition of chemotaxis, on the other hand activation of the expression of innate immunity factors.

Kyriakou\" Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece Background: Age-dependent changes of innate cytokine production have been reported, including molecules implicated in antiviral responses. Furthermore, several studies suggest that the postnatal development of these responses might be modified by the presence of atopy and this might be linked to an enhanced susceptibility to infections. Nonetheless, most of the recent research focuses on changes occurring early in life and there are rare data on differences in responses between allergic and non allergic subjects. Method: We aimed to evaluate i) the maturation trajectory of the TLR7/8 antiviral pathway ii) if this trajectory varies between atopics and non atopics. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from otherwise healthy atopic and non-atopic subjects, aged 0-45 years. Atopy was assessed by medical history and skin prick testing to eight common aeroallergens and egg white. Selected cytokines involved in antiviral TLR7/8 response were measured by Luminex multiplexing technology in 24 hours culture supernatants of R848-stimulated PBMCs. Data were analyzed by estimating the nonparametric correlation between age and cytokine expression in atopics and non atopics. A sub-analysis was performed for ages 0-20 years in both groups.Results: The analysis comprised data from 39 atopic and 39 non atopic patients (mean age 10.8 years, age range 0-45 and mean 10.3 years, range 0-43.3, respectively). Significant age-related increases in the production of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2 were found only in non atopics. Significant age-related increase in the production of IFN-\u03b12 and IL-12 was found only in the non-atopics 0-20 years-old.Significant maturation of antiinflammatory IL-10 production was observed in both groups and different age ranges.Conclusion: Age-related increases in cytokines implicated in innate antiviral responses were observed mostly for non atopics. Atopy was associated with suboptimal Th1-proinflammatory cytokine and interferon type I responses, in the context of the TRL-7/8 pathway postnatal maturation. Differences in the developmental pattern of those cytokines between atopics and non atopics may contribute to the reported increased susceptibility of atopics to infections.",

Case report: A 67 year old female was diagnosed with primary Sj\u00f6gren Syndrome in March 2015 based on ocular and oral symptoms and signs, positive minor salivary gland biopsy with positive antinuclear antibodies and anti-Ro antibody. Initially she was treated with corticosteroids and antimalarials. In May 2015 she was admitted to the Clinic for Pulmonary Diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia due to fever, fatigue, right rib cage pain and fainting.

Multiple drug hypersensivity syndrome (MDHS) is a peculiar clinical condition characterized by a propensity to react against different chemically unrelated antibiotic or non-antibiotic drugs (tow or more). The origin of MDHS is still unclear but recent studies place severe cutaneous adverse reactions, particulary DRESS, at high risk of inducing multiple sensitizations and thus they increase the understanding of, at least, a part of the spectrum of MDH pathways.Case report: 54 years-old woman, nurse, with a past medical history of multiple myeloma, chronic renal failure on regular hemodialysis, type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, and hypertension. She was referred to the Immunoallergology (IA) outpatient department because of a DRESS after treatment with vancomycin, amikacin and piperacillin-tazobactam-several long-term treatment with antibiotics due to febrile syndrome. She also described one episode of a pruritic maculopapular generalized exanthema on the 2th day of treatment with meropenem for febrile neutropenia. In order to do an allergologic evaluation, all antibiotics involved were testedskin prick tests (SPT) and intradermal (ID). Piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin and daptomycin SPT an ID were negative in immediate and late reading. ID with vancomycin and meropenem were positive in late reading. To evaluate beta-lactams allergy, beta-lactam-specific IgE were performed and negative, SPT and ID with major (PPL) and minor (MDM) determinants and penicillin, clavulanic acid and cephalosporins were also negative in immediate and late reading. Amoxicillin ID positivity was observed at 48 hours. The diagnosis of delayed hypersensitivity reaction to vancomycin, meropenem and aminopenicillins was established.Conclusion: The number of hypersensitivity reactions to antibiotics described is increasing and consequently the MDHS diagnosis. It should be emphasized that patients with MDHS present a risk of reaction to a new drug far superior to the general population and for that it is essential take steps to avoid or prevent infections and thereby minimize the need for antibiotic therapy. The authors describe a case of a clinical condition still uncommon: delayed hypersensitivity to vancomycin, meropenem and aminopenicillins where the prompt recognition of this entity was essential for rapid diagnosis and therapeutic alternatives.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hypersensitivity to rivaroxaban in which the implication of this drug has been documented by a positive LTT. The LTT could be a useful diagnostic tool of delayed hypersensitivity reaction caused by rivaroxaban, especially in more severe cases, in which in vivo tests are contraindicated.",

We describe our experience in the methods used to confirm the diagnosis of BL hypersensitivity. Method: Between 2015 and 2017, BL allergy was confirmed in 80 subjects. To reach the diagnosis, in vivo (skin prick and intradermal tests) and in vitro tests (basophil activation test, BAT, and radio allergo sorbent test, RAST) were performed.

Finally, 44% subjects were diagnosed of selective allergy to AX, 32% of selective allergy to CLV, 22% of allergy to all BL and 2% of selective allergy to cephalosporins.Conclusion: Patients with selective allergy to AX and CLV are clearly increasing, probably due to the broad use of these drugs, whereas hypersensitivity to other BL is decreasing. Therefore, in patients with story of AX-CLV/AX reactions the performance of a combination of in vivo and in vitro test followed by DPT when necessary is crucial to obtain an accurate diagnosis and to per-Unverified penicillin allergy leads to adverse downstream clinical and economic sequelae. Penicillin allergy evaluation can be used to identify true, IgE-mediated allergy.\u00b9 Beta-lactam antibiotics are the drugs that most frequently produce adverse reactions mediated by a specific immunological mechanism. 2 Within these, penicillins are the group most involved and best studied. Currently, amoxicillin, probably due to its high consumption, hasdisplaced benzylpenicillin in terms of the number of reactions. 3 Method: We have evaluated 90 patients with reported penicillin allergy referred to our hospital in the last seven months, performing penicillin allergy histories, penicillin skin testing and drug challenges under medical observation to distinguish true allergy. In addition, we have analyzed, based on positive results, who had personal or atopy family history, who had an immediate reaction, who had a dubious skin prick test with intradermal positive and who was evaluated with an oral challenge with the drug involved and who with an alternative. Results: We have obtained a positive result 17 patients out of 90 with reported penicillin allergy (18.88%). Of these, they have a family history of atopy the 35.29% and a personal history of atopy the 17.65%. Most of the patients with positive results have had an immediate reaction (64.71%). In two patients skin prick test was doubtful, so we performed intradermal test with positive result. Moreover, one of them was positive patch test. In 23.53% of patients skin tests were negative, so it was conducted oral challenge with the suspect drug, with positive result in all of them. More than half of patients (64.71%) was carried out oral challenge with an alternative drug, with negative results in all of them. Conclusion: In our study of penicillin allergy evaluation, 5.88% of our patients were positive with skin prick test, 64.71% with intradermal test, 5.88% with patch test and 23.53% with oral challenge. We have obtained a positive result in the 18.88%, data similar to others described in the literature. One of them shows us that only 19% of the suspected cases of reported beta lactams allergy were confirmed, emphasizing the importance to refer patients to Penicillin allergy is self-reported in 10% of the UK population. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by Treponema pallidum for which penicillin is the first line treatment. Since 2012 syphilis diagnoses have increased by 97% and an epidemic is ongoing. Untreated infection can lead to acute or long-term neurological and cardiovascular sequelae. The current British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) guidelines for the management of syphilis recommend desensitisation for patients with penicillin allergy. In order to improve care of patients with confirmed syphilis and self-reported penicillin allergy, a referral pathway from sexual health to immunology services for rapid assessment and treatment has been developed. Method: A retrospective evaluation was carried out looking at a cohort of patients referred urgently from the sexual health clinic to investigate suspected penicillin allergy. All the patients had a diagnosis of syphilis that required prompt treatment. Two of the three patients had a history of rash following penicillin. The third patient had been diagnosed with penicillin allergy based on positive skin tests in China but could not recall an adverse reaction following penicillin. The patients all underwent blood, skin and graded challenge testing to penicillin. Following challenge the patients were given a full treatment course of penicillin for syphilis. Results: The patients all had negative allergen specific IgE (penicillin panel), normal mast cell tryptase, negative skin prick and intradermal testing (standard panel of penicillins and the penicillin chosen for challenge-either amoxicillin, benzathine penicillin or procaine penicillin). All patients assessed tolerated penicillin and subsequently received first line curative treatment. Clinical and serological follow up was carried out in the sexual health clinic to ensure treatment had been curative.Conclusion: Rapid assessment for penicillin allergy improves outcomes in patients with syphilis by allowing appropriate rapid use of first line antibiotic therapy. With the ongoing increase in syphilis diagnoses nationally, clinical services need to be responsive to treatment challenges posed. We present our pathway for rapid assessment of penicillin allergy in urgent cases with syphilis. Penicillin allergy remains the most common drug allergy. There are a large number of patients labelled as allergic to drugs commonly used in clinical practice without having been studied. This creates a major health resource problem, having to use alternative antibiotics.Method: A retrospective review of medical records was performed in patients over 60, studied by adverse reactions to penicillin for a period of 12 years. Diagnosis was supported by in vivo testing including skin test such as prick and intradermal test. Whether skin tests were negative a single-blind challenge or Drug Provocation Test was performed under medical surveillance to establish or exclude the diagnosis of penicillin allergy and, in selected cases, to provide alternative drugs for the patient in need. A total of 804 patients over 60 were studied for penicillin allergy, during a period of 12 years.Results:The results of the study show 106 positive cases(13.18%)    of penicillin allergy. This percentage is similar to those obtained in studies conducted in general population. Most positive cases were detected by skin tests (n = 78). Benzylpenicillins were the betalactam group most frequently involved in adverse reactions studied (33%, n = 265), contrary to current consumption pattern.",

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics were the most frequently suspected class of drugs (22/18); 17 patients reported symptoms with multiple drugs. There were 20 patients with urticaria and/or asthma and 15 had a previous anaphylactic reaction to drugs. We counted 251 challenges: 189 DPT and 62 PCC. The latter were mostly positive and oral challenges (32/52 respectively). The clinical presentation at PCC was subjective in 27 patients (pruritus in 10, paresthesias in 6, heat/sweating in 5) and objective in 8 (urticaria in 2, erythema in 2). In 14 patients who had a positive/inconclusive DPT and repeated DPT with the same culprit drug after PCC, the final outcome was not reproducible in 10 patients. Conclusion: When clinical presentation is subjective, a PCC can be a decisive factor to the final result, taking in consideration that: a DPT may be difficult to classify, a positive PCC doesn't imply a negative DPT and an objective presentation is also possible in a PCC. It would be important to have guidelines on the interpretation of DPT and the use of PCC on drug hypersensitivity, as they exist in food allergy. 1159 | Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the drugs prescribed in allergy provocation testing in planning compounding needs Matte G; Bonnici A; Joseph S; Tsoukas C McGill University Health Center, Montreal, CanadaBackground: Our centre has a dedicated drug allergy testing program that generates a high volume of procedures including skin and drug provocation tests.

            "text": "Background: Daudi cells are B-lymphocyte-like culture of human cells originating from Burkitt's lymphoma characterized by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency. Immunopathogenesis of infections caused by EBV is directly related to clonal expansion of B-lymphocytes caused by changes in cytidine deaminase (CDA) gene expression with alteration of the expression of a number of immune system genes. Method: Immune system gene expression was studied in the Daudi cell line (RRPCEM, Belarus). As a control, mean gene expression was assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBMC) cell cultures from 12 healthy individuals. Total RNA was isolated from mononuclear leucocytes in peripheral blood using Tri-Reagent (Sigma, USA). cDNA was synthesized and labeled from total RNA using Superscript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, CA). The labeled cDNA was hybridized to the Discover Chip \u2122 (Arrayit, USA). DNAarrays were scanned on Innoscan 700 (Carbon, France). Results: Human Discover Chip \u2122 used to study gene expression showed that the Daudi line was characterized by expression of 18 genes not expressed in 12 control PBMC cultures: CCNB1, MYB, MYC, FUBP1, CCND3, PRKDC, STAT5A, MAN2B1, VAMP, EGR1, IL12RB2, ITGAE, E2F1, SLC22A2, CXCR2, MTHFR, SOD1, PLK. A characteristic feature of expression of the Daudi cell line immune system genes, compared with PBMC cultures, is increased expression (P < 0.05) of groups of genes (n = 8) associated with activity of cyclin-dependent kinases with Daudi B lymphocytes characterized by specific expression of cyclin B1 genes and D3, not detectable in uninfected PBMC. Enhanced expression of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 5 (CDC 4, CDC 5) genes from the Daudi line was 3 fold greater than in uninfected PBMC. Conclusion: Identification by DNA-array of features of EBV latency associated with the activity of cyclin-dependent regulation genes can be used to create a diagnostic test based on PCR expression. 1170 | Cryopreservation alters the absolute levels of immune responses but does not change the response profiles of circulating immune cells Martikainen M; H\u00e4kkinen E; Roponen M University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland Background: Freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are seldom used in immune cell analyses in cohort studies, as the use of fresh cells is usually laborious and impractical due to logistical and scheduling reasons. Several challenges may also hinder the interpretation of the results i.e. alterations in data acquired during different periods of time and, in multicenter studies, the differences in instrumentation and technical personnel. Analysis performed in one center in one batch using cryopreserved PBMCs is widely used answer to these challenges. Few studies, however, have published data concerning the effect of freezing on PBMCs. In this study, we investigated whether cryopreservation DCs (mDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and monocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytokine production of PBMCs (IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-12/IL23p40, IL-13, IL-17, TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3) was analyzed by multiplexed ELISA method. Results: The overall response profiles induced by different stimuli were similar in fresh and frozen cells, but the intensity of the responses varied in some extent. Some immune responses were slightly weaker in frozen cells than in fresh cells (PI, POLY(I:C) and LPS stimulated expression of CD80 in mDCs, POLY(I:C) stimulated expression of CD80 and LPS stimulated expression of ILT4 in monocytes (P < 0.05)). The response to increasing doses of LPS was lower in frozen cells, measured as the percentage cells expressing CD80. Cytokine data are in line with the cellular data, although some cytokines seem to be more sensitive to cryopreservation and thawing than others. Conclusion: Based on the results, it can be concluded that cryopreservation does not have a critical effect on the response profile of cells, and thus cryopreserved cells can be used in cohort studies reliably. The study suggests, though, that when interpreting and comparing the results of different studies, the possible effects of freezing on the absolute levels of immune responses should be taken into account.

Periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition that affects the tissues surrounding/supporting the teeth-gums, cementum, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. It is broadly classified as gingivitis, or periodontitis, when alveolar bone loss is present. Here we investigated the impact of mastocytosis on the severity of periodontal disease. Method: A cross sectional study was conducted with 67 mastocytosis patients, aged 18-69 years (median: 45 years, interquartile range: 20). Medical data was collected via a short questionnaire and clinical records, and included: diagnostic category of mastocytosis, duration of disease, bone marrow mast cell burden (BMMC%) as assessed by flow cytometry, associated bone disease and bone mass index, basal serum tryptase levels, multilineage involvement of hematopoiesis by KIT mutation, atopy, cardiovascular risk factorsdiabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension and obesityand toxic habitsalcohol consumption and tobacco smoking.

            "text": "Allergen-specific IgE plays a major role in the development of allergic reactions. It binds with high-affinity to the primary IgE receptor Fc\u03b5RI on basophils and mast cells. Upon exposure to the cognate allergen IgE-loaded cells immediately degranulate and release soluble mediators causing allergic symptoms. The therapeutic anti-IgE antibody Omalizumab is known to neutralize free IgE and to prevent binding of IgE to basophils and mast cells. Recently, we have reported that Omalizumab actively desensitizes basophils at high concentrations. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that a mutated IgE-Fc variant, which is resistant to Omalizumab binding, may be used to actively replace the IgE-repertoire on the surface of primary human basophils when co-applied with Omalizumab. This combination treatment significantly increased inhibition of antigenmediated basophil activation ex vivo. Here, we aim to further investigate the exact mechanism of basophil inhibition for the mutated IgE-Fc variant.Method: Human primary basophils were isolated from whole blood donations of grass-pollen allergic individuals and treated with wildtype IgE-Fc or mutated IgE-Fc variants alone or in combination withOmalizumab. Subsequently, cells were challenged with a grass-pollen allergen mix. Basophil activation was measured by flow cytometry.Results: Interestingly, the mutated IgE-Fc variant alone diminished basophil activation in a competition-independent manner, while the wildtype IgE-Fc variant showed no effect. Furthermore, the IgE-Fc variant showed synergistic and dose-dependent inhibition already at low concentrations when used in combination with Omalizumab.Conclusion:Our data indicate that the mutated IgE-Fc variant might engage an inhibitory receptor on the surface of basophils.However, further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.The IgE-Fc variant could potentially be used as an efficient add-on treatment to the current Omalizumab therapy. Eicosanoids are oxygenated lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids like arachidonic acid. Through different (non-) enzymatic pathways a diverse group of metabolites can be synthesized that are highly diverse in their actions. Because of its specificity and sensitivity liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has enabled a comprehensive analysis of lipid mediators. Herein we present the development of a method for the quantification of 52 oxylipins and its application in zymosan-stimulated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Method: PMN were isolated from fresh whole blood of 6 healthy volunteers via centrifugation on a density gradient. PMN were treated with zymosan, a yeast cell wall component, or left untreated (control). After 24 hours all PMN were incubated with the Ca 2+ ionophore A23187, supernatants were harvested and stored in 50% methanol (MeOH) at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. Five different solid phase extraction (SPE) methods were compared for their precision and accuracy. Based on these parameters, Strata-X single columns were selected as the extraction method of choice. Samples were diluted to a MeOH content of 10% before SPE. Eluates were evaporated and reconstituted in MeOH:H 2 O for LC-MS/ MS analysis. Concentrations were calculated using a calibration curve. Results: SPE using Strata-X columns showed the most accurate and reproducible results for the eicosanoid extraction from cell culture medium. Of the 52 metabolites included in the LC-MS/MS panel only 11 or 13 were detectable in the samples from PMN stimulated with ionophore or zymosan/ionophore, respectively. 9-and 15hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), as well as, prostaglandin (PG) E 2 and PGF 2\u03b1 were detectable only after zymosan stimulation, while leukotriene (LT) D 4 and 12-oxoETE were only present in control samples. The concentration of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) metabolites, LTB 4 , LTC 4 , LTD 4 , LTE 4 and 5-HETE was higher in ionophore compared to zymosan/ionophore stimulated PMN. Zymosan treatment led to an increase of the cyclooxygenase (COX) metabolites thromboxane B 2 and PGE 2 . Conclusion: The described method allows the quantification of up to 52 lipid mediators. Zymosan stimulation of human PMN led to the secretion of COX metabolites, while 5-LO metabolites were more abundant in control PMN, which is in line with the current literature. The established method can be used to quantify lipid mediators in a variety of (patho-) physiological settings. concentrations in a Serum mast cell tryptase (MCT) \u226511.5 ng/mL has previously been reported in 900/15 298 (6%) subjects in an Austrian cohort with immediate and delayed allergy on a background of multisystem disease. Dominantly inherited TPSAB1 gene allele duplications and triplications (alpha-tryptasemia) have recently been identified as an underlying cause of a baseline MCT \u22658.0 ng/mL in 35 American and British families. The aim of this survey was to determine the prevalence of baseline MCT above \u22658.0 ng/mL and associated clinical phenotype in a large British cohort. Method: We retrospectively surveyed anonymized baseline MCT in a cohort of patients referred to the Greater Manchester Immunology Service in the five-year period from 2012 to 2017. Patients with a clinical history of acute allergic reactions/anaphylaxis and duplicate samples were excluded. Results: 4283 blood samples were analysed from patients with a median age 38 (range 0-96) years, 60% of whom were female. 195 (5%) (median age 52 (range 0-86) years, 50% female) had a baseline MCT \u22658.0 ng/mL. 87 (45%) patients had been labelled as having a \"mast cell disorder-not further defined\", 72 (37%) patients had repeat baseline MCT measured one week or more following an allergic reaction and 24 (12%) had atopic disease or chronic idiopathic urticaria/angioedema. Conclusion: One in twenty subjects in our British cohort, nearly half of whom had been labelled with undefined mast cell disorders had a MCT \u22658.0 ng/mL. Genetic testing for alpha-tryptasemia in these patients might provide an underlying genetic cause for a proportion of their high MCT and clinical features. 1181 | Value of long-term prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema: a review of physiciansAnalysis, LLC, Malvern, Pa, United States Background: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder stemming from a deficiency or dysfunction of C1inhibitor (C1-INH), and results in recurrent episodes of angioedema. These debilitating attacks, which lead to poor quality-of-life (QoL) and can be fatal, may be treated using on-demand therapy and/or long-term prophylaxis (LTP). Physicians' opinions differ on appropriate criteria for starting LTP and/or the choice of LTP regimen. Publications were excluded if they were not guidelines, consensuses, comments, letters, reviews, or editorials, or only included pediatric patients. The reference list of each publication was assessed for eligible papers not found in the databases. Results: Of 367 articles identified in the databases, 40 were included in the review, and another 7 were included based on reference mapping. Of the 47 articles, 28% were guidelines, 26% were expert consensuses, and 45% were international articles (others were country-specific). Most (68%) were published after 2011. The most recent expert consensus documents and guidelines were less likely to recommend number of attacks as the only criterion for starting LTP and more likely to recommend a broader range of criteria, including QoL impact, location of attacks, access to resources, and inadequate control with on-demand therapy. Due to limitations associated with antifibrinolytics (lack of efficacy) and attenuated androgens (severe adverse events), the majority of recent guidelines recommend either that LTP treatment selection be customized according to individual risk factors or that plasma-derived C1-INH (pdC1-INH) be the preferred first-line LTP treatment in all patients. Conclusion: Recent publications recommend a broad range of criteria for starting LTP, including HAE impact on patients' QoL, location of attacks, access to resources, and inadequate control with ondemand therapy. With regard to regimen, most recent publications recommend that LTP should either be individually customized or that all patients should receive first-line treatment with a pdC1-INH. 1182 | Prophylaxis with subcutaneous C1-Esterase inhibitor (C1-INH [SC]) reduces symptom days and severity of symptoms in patients with Hereditary Angioedema (HAE): Results from the COMPACT study median attack rate with C1-INH (SC) relative to placebo. The effect of prophylactic therapy on the number of days with HAE symptoms and/or the severity of symptoms may be a more relevant measure of efficacy for patients with HAE. This analysis examines the efficacy of C1-INH (SC) in terms of its impact on the number of HAE symptom days and the severity of symptoms, based on patientreported data in the COMPACT study. Method: Patients self-administered C1-INH (SC) or placebo twice weekly in a double-blind, crossover manner over 2 consecutive 16week treatment periods. The time-normalised number of days of HAE symptoms and the sum of severity scores per patient were exploratory endpoints. Each day, patients entered in an eDiary whether they experienced HAE symptoms (yes/no). For every day of recorded HAE symptoms, the patient graded the severity of each symptom as mild = 1, moderate = 2, or severe = 3. The following parameters were calculated per patient: (a) time-normalised number of days of HAE symptoms, (b) time-normalised number of consecutive HAE symptom days, (c) sum of symptom severity scores, and (d) sum of symptom severity scores combined with rescue medication use. Days with missing entries for HAE symptoms were considered symptom-free days. Results: C1-INH (SC) reduced the time-normalised number of HAE symptom days overall and consecutive HAE symptom days relative to placebo. The mean (SD) time-normalised number of HAE symptom days per month was 1.61 (4.39) with C1-INH (SC) 60 IU/kg and 7.51 (5.59) with placebo. The mean (SD) time-normalised number of consecutive HAE symptom days was 0.84 (1.37) per month with C1-INH (SC) 60 IU/kg and 5.00 (2.66) per month with placebo. The sum of symptom severity scores was also lower with C1-INH (SC) 60 IU/ kg compared with placebo (0.07 vs 0.45) as was the sum of symptom severity scores combined with rescue medication use (0.09 vs 0.73). Conclusion: Based on analysis of patient-reported data, prophylaxis with C1-INH (SC) 60 IU/kg increases the number of symptomfree days relative to placebo in patients with HAE and reduces the severity of HAE symptoms.

Corticosteroids and antihistaminic drugs that are used in case of acute histamine-induced angioedema are ineffective in case of an acute hereditary angioedema. Making the correct diagnosis is crucial for patients with this disease. Based upon family history, we were able to identify a family with hereditary angioedema manifesting in adulthood, with a fatal case of a 19year old female member of the family. Laboratory and genetic diagnostics of C1-INH and F12 genes were completely normal, indicating a hitherto unknown mutation responsible for angioedema in this family.Method: We evaluated clinical data, family history, and routine laboratory parameters and performed Sanger sequencing of exon 9 of the PLG gene.",

            "text": "Background: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is characterised by recurrent episodes of swelling of the face, limbs, trunk, and genitourinary and respiratory tracts. Laryngeal attacks pose the greatest risk, as airway obstruction can lead to asphyxiation. Subcutaneous C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH [SC]) at 60 IU/kg was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in June 2017 as routine prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks in adolescents and adults, based on the COMPACTstudy. In this study, the median attack rate was reduced by 95% with C1-INH (SC) 60 IU/kg relative to placebo. We examined the effects of C1-INH (SC) on the HAE attack rate by anatomical location. Method: In the COMPACT study, 45 patients self-administered C1-INH (SC) 60 IU/kg body weight or placebo twice weekly in a double-blind, crossover manner over two 16-week treatment periods. The primary endpoint (time-normalised number of HAE attacks) was analysed by anatomic location of HAE attacks (facial, peripheral, laryngeal, thoracic, abdominal, genitourinary, other). by location was markedly lower with C1-INH (SC) 60 IU/kg than with placebo: abdominal (43 vs 243), peripheral (27 vs 207), genitourinary (3 vs 56), and facial (3 vs 8) regions. No laryngeal attacks occurred during treatment with C1-INH (SC) 60 IU/kg vs 12 with placebo. The majority of attacks that occurred during treatment with C1-INH (SC) 60 IU/kg were of mild or moderate intensity. Only 9% of patients experienced a severe attack with C1-INH (SC) 60 IU/ kg, compared with 69% of patients on placebo. C1-INH (SC) was well tolerated, with no related serious adverse events.Conclusion: Prophylaxis with C1-INH (SC) 60 IU/kg is effective in reducing the rate of HAE attacks at all anatomic locations. No patient experienced a laryngeal attack during treatment with C1-INH (SC) 60 IU/kg. 1189 | Onset of effect of prophylactic treatment with subcutaneous C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH [SC]) for prevention of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) attacks: Findings from the phase III compact study first 2 weeks of therapy with C1-INH (SC) 60 IU/kg vs 70 attacks with placebo (17 severe). Population pharmacokinetic models indicate that C1-INH functional activity exceeds the critical threshold of 40% after the second dose of C1-INH (SC) (C max = 60.7%, T max = 58.7 hours, C trough = 48%). Conclusion: The preventive effect of C1-INH (SC) is already evident in the first 2 weeks of switching from on-demand treatment, as evidenced by less severe and fewer attacks during prophylaxis.

We assessed the serum concentrations of AGEs and AOPPs in patients affected by HAE. Method: The blood samples were collected to measure the serum concentrations of AGEs and AOPPs by spectrofluorimetric and spectrophotometric methods in patients affected by C1-INH-HAE and FXII-HAE during remission. Results: The circulating levels of AOPPs observed on control group (0.94 (0.36) nmol/mg) were significantly lower than those observed on the C1-INH-HAE group (1.68 (0.47) nmol/mg; P = 0.002) and FXII-HAE (1.50 (0.27) nmol/mg; P = 0.001). The circulating levels of AGEs were significantly higher in C1-INH-HAE group (211.58 (151.05) AU/g; P = 0.02) than the FXII group (141.48 (89.59) AU/g), thus demonstrating a state of heightened oxidative stress. Conclusion: Our observations show additional underlying events involved in HAE and are of central importance for further investigations of differences in bradykinin receptors signaling among the two disease subgroups, that may result in the differences here preliminary demonstrated in oxidative stress markers. Subcutaneous high-dose hypoallergenic allergen immunotherapy (AIT) using a 6-grasses pollen allergoid has been well-established for decades in grass-pollen specific immunotherapy of allergic rhinitis and asthma. Recently performed new clinical trials prompted a reappraisal of the overall safety data pool from clinical trials. Method: 1023 patients diagnosed for grass pollen allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (+/-) asthma were included in 5 randomized, controlled trials. The pooled active safety set (PASS) comprised all patients receiving active AIT via the standard dose escalation scheme (7 injections) either as preseasonal or perennial treatment for a maximum of 3 years. Adverse events (AE), adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as well as routine biochemical and hematological laboratory safety parameters were analysed. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA 19.0) terminology was used throughout for coding with recoding of AE terms from lower MedDRA versions where appropriate. All codes were assessed to their primary system organ class (SOC). Results: 495 (254 female, 241 male) patients with a mean age of 32.8 years and a mean duration of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis of 12.1 years where included in the safety analysis. 98 (19.8%) Patients were diagnosed for having bronchial asthma at study entry. More than 40% if treatment emergent AEs were observed in the following SOCs: General disorders and administration site conditions (n = 240) as well as infections and infestations (n = 219). 4.4% of patients (n = 22) had systemic reactions. 1 treatment related serious adverse event (anaphylactic reaction) was observed. The most frequent drug related adverse events (ADRs) were injection site reactions like swelling (reported for 31.1% of patients, n = 154), pruritus (25.3%, n = 125), and erythema (18.2%, n = 90). No notable differences in changes of laboratory measurements following AIT compared to placebo were observed.Conclusion:The updated overall analysis of safety data from randomized, controlled clinical trials confirmed previous analyses of clinical trial data and was found in accordance with the long-term experience from the use of the high dose hypoallergenic 6-grasses pollen allergoid in the market.1192 | Monitoring change in ige/igg4 ratio has predictive significance for estimating efficacy of allergen-specific immunotherapy (ait) and enhances rendering clinical decisions during treatment Blagojevic G; Arsenijevic J; Vuckovic O Institute for virology, sera and vaccines, Torlak, Belgrade, Serbia Background: Clinicians administering AIT need improved monitoring of its effects and as objective as possible evaluation of its efficacy. Determining IgE and IgG4 levels before initiating treatment, and 1 and 3 years into treatment, allows monitoring its effects. Monitoring the changes in the IgE/IgG4 ratio and dynamics of this change which correlates with a clinical improvement may serve to predict efficacy.",

They share IgG4 increase and a decrease in the IgE/IgG4 ratio: (a) IgE decrease in 24% of SLIT patients, and in 35% of VIT patients; (b) moderate IgE increase after 1 year, with a decrease to the level below the baseline after 3 years in 13% of patients in both groups; (c) a marked IgE increase after 1 year with a decrease to the level below the baseline after 3 years in 13% of patients in both groups. There was a 59%decrease in the IgE/IgG4 ratio mean after 1 year compared to the baseline in the SLIT group, i.e. 91% in the VIT group. No statistically significant difference in IgE levels after 1 and 3 years compared to the baseline was found in all patients except those on the VIT rush protocol (a statistically significant difference). A statistically highly significant difference was determined regarding a decrease in the IgE/IgG4 ratio after 1 and 3 years when compared to the baseline in both groups, which is of predictive significance for estimating the efficacy of immunotherapy.Conclusion:A decrease in the IgE/IgG4 ratio in patients on AIT realistically predicts establishing of allergen tolerance. Routinely monitoring changes in this ratio can contribute significantly to understanding clinical improvements and help in making clinical decisions on stopping or modifying AIT. An important issue in sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is how to improve efficacy. The aim of the study is to compare the clinical and immunological efficacy of SLIT: with vitamin D supplementation to placebo in children with allergic rhinitis.Method: Fifty children aged 5-12, sensitive to grass pollen, with allergic rhinitis (8 patients had concomitant asthma) participated in 5 month prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Children received Oralair 300 IR tablet with either vitamin D 1000 IU daily supplementation, or placebo. Primary endpoints included symptom-medication score and lung function.

Among tree pollen the ones from ash are sometimes underestimated as cause for allergic symptoms. The objective was to evaluate retrospectively diagnostic results of patients with allergic symptoms during spring time for sensitization to ash pollen as well as the safety of allergen specific immunotherapy (AIT). Method: Patients with positive anamnesis and allergic symptoms during spring time were tested for ash pollen sensitization in skin prick test (SPT) and nasal provocation test (NPT). In case of positive results, AIT (CLUSTOID Esche) was prescribed and the safety profile of the cluster schedule (0.2 + 0.5 mL with an interval of 15 minutes on the first treatment day, followed by monthly maintenance injections of 0.5 mL) was documented (according to Pfaar et al. 2009).

Method: Using the Lifelink \u2122 Treatment Dynamics database (IQVIA, Paris, France) of data on prescription fulfilment by 7300 pharmacies across France, we compared two cohorts of patients with grass-pollen-induced allergic rhinitis (AR): a \"SLIT tablet\" group of 1099 patients having received Oralair\u00ae and/or Grazax\u00ae SLIT tablets, and a control group of 27 475 patients. The analysis focused on asthma onset in patients not having received asthma medications during the reference (pre-index) period, and on the progression of asthma in patients having already received asthma medications during the preindex period. Results: 37.6% (n = 413/1099) of the SLIT tablet group and 39.2% of the control group (n = 10 776/27 475) had asthma at the index date. Among the initially non-asthmatic patients, asthma onset was observed during the treatment period in 12.1% of the patients in the SLIT tablet group and in 12.3% of the patients in the control group. During the follow-up period, the frequency of asthma onset was three times lower in the SLIT tablet group (n = 11/603, 1.8%) than in the control group (n = 782/14 645, 5.34%). After adjustment for age, the risk [95% CI] of asthma onset in the SLIT tablet group during the follow-up period was found to be 63.7% [31.5%; 80.7%] lower than in the control group (P = 0.0018). In patients with asthma in the pre-index period, fulfilments of asthma medications fell by 40% in the SLIT tablet group (when comparing the pre-index and followup periods) and increased by 20% in the control group. When compared with the control group after age matching, the regression coefficient [95% CI] for the risk in the SLIT tablet group was -0.61 [-0.76;-0.46] (P < 0.0001).Conclusion: A retrospective analysis of the fulfilment of prescriptions of symptomatic medications shows a significant reduction in anti-asthma treatment deliveries for RA patients with associated asthma and suggests that worsening of allergy (the occurrence of asthma) is less frequent 2 or 3 years after the initiation of treatment with SLIT tablets.

To shorten the updosing schedule of two SCIT products (ALK, Denmark) a clinical trial was initiated in 2017 to demonstrate safety and tolerability of up-dosing schedules with 7 injections (three allergens: grass, birch and house dust mite), all compared with the established 11-injection schedule for grasses. Method: The phase II partly-randomised (only the two grass arms were randomised), controlled, open-label trial is being conducted in Germany and Spain (EudraCT No. 2017-000971-97). A total of 320 subjects with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis to grass, birch or house dust mites (with or without asthma, aged 12-65 years) are allocated to 1 of 4 treatment arms (1:1:1:1) with updosing of the grass-, birch-or house dust mite SCIT product to 100.000 SQ-U as maximum dose by either 7 (all allergens) or 11 weekly injections (grass only, serving as control group). Subsequently, all patients receive the first two maintenance injections with 2-and 4 week-intervals respectively, thus the total treatment lasting 12 or 16 weeks. Results: The primary endpoint is the number of treatment-related adverse events. Secondary endpoints include number of local and systemic reactions (immediate and delayed), number of serious adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, as well as change in vital signs and peak expiratory flow (pre and post injection). Conclusion: With this trial design it is possible to generate safety data for a new short updosing schedule for 3 allergens at the same time. If the trial shows acceptable safety and tolerability of the 7injection updosing schedule, updosing of SCIT for these 3 allergens may become feasible with 4 injections to a dose of 10.000 SQ-U and with 3 additional injections to 100.000 SQ-U.

The tolerability of the single therapies with modified Trees, Grasses and the Grasses/Trees mixture were similar. In daily practice the Rush up-dosing has proven itself. Subcutaneous specific immunotherapy (SCIT) with a hypoallergenic grass pollen allergoid is an effective and tolerable treatment method. This study investigates the safety and tolerability of an accelerated dose escalation scheme with only one strength of the preparation. Method: 13 sites in Germany, Poland, Spain and Russia will recruit patients (18-65 years) with a positive skin prick test to grass pollen allergens, specific IgE [>0.70 kU/L] and symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis on grass pollen exposure documented in the medical history. The safety and tolerability of an accelerated dose escalation scheme (3 injections with strength B) will be compared with the standard escalation scheme (7 injections with strength A+B) of a hypoallergenic grass pollen in a multicentre phase II clinical trial. Both groups will receive 2 additional maintenance doses. All adverse events will be recorded. Patients and investigators will assess the tolerability of the therapy using a 5-point Likert scale.Results: The study design has been approved by CompetentAuthorities and Ethic Committees in all participating countries.Approximately 100 male and female outpatients, aged 18-65 years, will be screened. It is planned to randomize 70 patients, 35 patients in each active treatment group.The use of an alternative dose escalation schemes with less injections is common in daily practice.

Objective: We have evaluated the tolerance to a new cluster schedule during the dose-increase phase using an extract of mites absorbed in aluminum hydroxide and standardized in IR/mL. Method: We pooled our patients in two groups based on weight: less than 40 kg and equal or more than 40 kg. The schedule using the highest concentration vial consisted in 3 days of cluster: day 1, day 8 and day 22. On the first day were administered two doses of 0.1 mL separated by 30 minutes in the group of less weight and 0.10 + 0.20 mL in the other group. The second day, separated by 30 minutes, patients with least weight was administered 0.2 and 0.3 mL and 0.3 and 0.5 mL in the greater weight. Finally, the third day, both groups were given directly their maintenance dose according to their weight: 0.5 and 0.8 mL respectively. Finally the third day all received the maintenance dose that was directly 0.50 mL for the <40 kg group and 0.80 mL for the \u226540 kg. Results: Total patients: 61.

Hybrid 1 was further studied by negative stain electron microscopy. Antisera raised against Phl p 5, Bet v 1 and peptides thereof were used to test hybrid 1 for IgG reactivity. IgE reactivity and basophil activation of hybrid 1 was studied by quantitative dot blotting and basophil activation tests.Results: Unlike the isolated monomeric allergens, SEC and DLS showed that the hybrid formed stable, soluble high molecular weight aggregates which could be visualized by negative stain electron microscopy. CD-based secondary structure prediction of the hybrid indicated a loss of a-helical content compared to the equimolar mix of Phl p 5 and Bet v 1. The hybrid reacted as well as the monomeric allergens with Bet v 1-and Phl p 5-specific rabbit IgG antibodies but showed lower reactivity with peptide-specific IgG antibodies. Interestingly, the hybrid exhibited significantly stronger IgE binding than the equimolar mix when tested with sera of patients sensitized toBet v 1 but not with sera of patients sensitized to Phl p 5. However, the hybrid elicited a 10-100-fold reduced basophil activation strongly reduced allergenic activity due to formation of high molecular weight aggregates. The reduction of allergenic activity of the IgE-reactive high molecular weight allergen aggregates may be explained by altered orientation of IgE epitopes of Bet v 1 in the hybrid architecture.1224 | The effects of local heating on hymenoptera venom allergenicity: Could high temperature change the natural history?Feketea GN Hospital Unit Amaliada, General Hospital of Ilia, Amaliada, Greece Case report: Hymenoptera venoms contain vasoactive and proinflammatory mediators that cause local pain and swelling. In sensitized individuals, venom-specific IgE binds to IgE-binding epitopes, triggering an allergic reaction. The epitopes on major hymenoptera allergens are almost entirely discontinuous and conformation-dependent. Food allergy studies show that native conformational epitopes can be destroyed, and new epitopes appear during heating, the effect on protein allergenicity depending on the temperature and duration. Hymenoptera allergy may cause large local reactions (LLRs) at the sting site and systemic reactions. Individuals who have previously experienced LLR often have LLRs to subsequent stings, and up to 10% have a systemic reaction. The treatment of LLRs is symptomatic, including cold compresses, antihistaminic, analgesic medication, and even a short course of glucosteroids. Recently, I was stung on my foot by a wasp while walking barefoot at the edge of the sea. I felt intense pain at the sting site, and within minutes, abdominal cramps, with tachycardia and cold sweat. Fearing anaphylaxis, I ran through the very hot sand for 3-4 minutes to seek help. As, during this time, the pain decreased considerably and the other symptoms almost disappeared, I kept my foot in hot sand for 30 minutes, after which there was only mild swelling and erythema at the sting site, which persisted for the next two days. I also describe the cases of 3 children with a history of LLR after insect sting, who attended the local hospital emergency department 5-15 minutes after being stung on the hand. They were all in good general condition, with no swelling in the affected hand. They were immediately placed with the sting site in water at temperature of 45-55\u00b0C for 1 hour, and remained asymptomatic. After 2 hours they were discharged and presented no symptoms after 12, 24, 72 hours, without further treatment. Conclusion: These experiences suggest that exposure to local high temperature (depending on individual tolerance), immediately after a sting, could reduce venom-protein allergenicity and the severity of adverse reactions. To the best of my knowledge the effect of heating on venom-protein allergenicity has not been reported. In vivo (sting challenges with application of different supportable temperatures) and in vitro research (immunoblot with denaturized venom protein at different temperatures and for different times) is indicated. 1225 | The danger of bee sting therapy Argiz L; Belver MT; Vega F; Bazire R; Vera A; Bernaola M; Bartha I; Blanco C Department of Allergy, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitario Princesa (IP.), Madrid, Spain Introduction: Use of bee venom (BV) as a therapeutic agent for the relief of joint pain dates back to Hippocrates. Also known as apitherapy, this technique is widely used in Eastern Europe, Asia, and South America. Beneficial effects of bee stings can be attributed to melittin, an anti-inflammatory agent, known to be hundred times stronger than cortisone. Recent studies have reported that BV has anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects. It is used to treat disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases). Unfortunately, certain substances in the BV trigger allergic reactions which can be life threatening in a sensitized individual.Case report: We present a 60 year old woman who developed facial angioedema, tongue swelling and generalized urticaria 20 minutes after the fourth bee sting during a session of bee sting therapy (BST). Symptoms resolved with intramuscular methylprednisolone in less than one hour.She had undergone 15 sessions of BST in the last year because of joint pain and chronic pruritus. In each session, she received 5-6 stings in her back, developing local reaction that usually resolved without treatment in less than 24 hours.",

Pollen monitoring data and weather conditions were compared to the intensity of symptoms. Results: In 17 patients who received SLIT with birch pollen allergen average daily symptoms score during the pollen season was 0.45 \u00b1 0.3, average dMS was 2.38 \u00b1 0.75, average CSMS was 2.71 \u00b1 0.88 out of maximum 6. Maximum symptoms severity was from 25 Apr 2016 to 28 Apr 2016, average symptoms score was 0.66, average CSMS was 3.11. During these days Food additives improve food conservation visual aspect or food palatability. Even though they could be responsible for IgE-mediated allergy, allergic reactions to food additives remain rare. The main objective of this study was to describe a pediatric cohort suspected of allergy to food additives, food dye or sodium benzoate. As a secondary objective, families were contacted in order to monitor clinical evolution after the food additives challenge, whatever its result. Method: All the patients who underwent open oral food challenge for sodium benzoate (250 mg), tartrazine, yellow sunset, carmine red, cochineal red, erythrosin, or patent blue V (2.5 mg), between 2013 and 2016 in our department were analyzed retrospectively. A survey was sent to families during year 2017 in order to know if allergic reactions reappeared, and to evaluate feeding behaviors with food additives.Results: Twenty-three patients (median age: 5 years old) were included. Allergological investigations incriminated foods (n = 20; 80%) and/or medicines (n = 7; 30%). Candies were the main suspected foods, found in 11 patients (48%). Forty-six open oral food challenges were performed, only one was positive (urticaria 60 minutes after ingestion of carmine and cochineal red). Subsequently, 98% of the food additives challenges were negative. Fifteen families answered the survey. Despite the negativity of the challenge in all cases, 5 families reported occurrence of supposed allergic reactions to food additives and 6 declared to systematically exclude additives in their child's feeding.",

Well skin care and early use of TCS to control AD may have cancelled the seasonal effect on FA. Allergy and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand; 2 Institute of Molecular Biosciences, Mahidol University, Salaya, Nakhonpathom, Thailand Background: Although wheat and other cereal grains have a broad range of the in vitro cross-reactivity, the clinical relevance is uncertain. The oral food challenge remains the gold standard to avoid unnecessary avoidance of all cereal grains in patients with IgEmediated wheat allergy. This prospective study aimed to study the clinical cross-reactivity between cereal grains (barley, oat, and job's tear) among children with IgE-mediated wheat allergy.Method: Patients between the ages of 5 and 15 years with a history of immediate reactions after wheat ingestion were enrolled.Skin prick test (SPT) to wheat, barley, oat, and job's tear and measurement of serum specific IgE (sIgE) to wheat, \u03c9-5 gliadin, barley, and oat were performed. Open food challenge (OFC) to barley, oat, and job's tear were conducted to confirm the status of grain allergy in each patients. Immunoblotting with sIgE to wheat, barley, oat and ELISA-inhibition assay were done to confirm the cross-reactivity.Results: Ten patients were enrolled in this pilot study with themedian age of 8 years (range 5-10 years). Nine of them (90%) had a history of wheat anaphylaxis, whereas the other one had only cutaneous symptom (urticaria and angioedema). The median size of mean wheal diameter (MWD) of the SPT and level of the sIgE to wheat was 6 mm (IQR 3.9-10.4 mm) and 86.5 kAU/L (IQR 7.9-228.5 kAU/ L). The OFC to each grain was performed only in patients who had MWD of the SPT not more than 5 mm, and did not have history of anaphylaxis. The OFC to barley were performed in 4 patients. All of them had negative result. Among 8 patients whom underwent oat OFC, anaphylaxis developed in one patient. Two patients had history of job's tear anaphylaxis, therefore 8 patients underwent job's tear OFC, and no one developed allergic reaction. Immunoblotting showed a strong signal of sIgE to wheat bound to a 35 kDa allergen which are most likely to be gliadin. SIgE of wheat allergic patients bound to 30-35 kDa protein from barley extract. The ELISA-inhibition assay showed extract of barley, but not oat could inhibit sIgE bind to wheat gliadin. Conclusion: Avoidance of all cereal grains is unnecessary among patients with severe wheat allergy with the negative SPT The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of sIgE to \u03b1-Gal in subjects with acute urticaria or anaphylaxis from different geographical areas of Spain and to evaluate the relevance of demographic and lifestyle aspects as risks factors for the development of this immune response.Method: Participants were recruited from Allergy Departments at 14 Spanish hospitals. Patients aged 18 years or older presenting with urticaria or anaphylaxis were enrolled into one of two arms; cases (symptoms of unknown origin, after eating meat or innards of mammalian origin, related to gelatin of mammalian origin administration, cetuximab administration, tick bites) and controls (symptoms of known etiology excluding foods of mammalian origin, cetuximab, colloid-based gelatin and tick bites). An interviewer-administered questionnaire recording data of sex, age, place of residence (urban, halfurban and rural), clinical presentation (urticaria/anaphylaxis), blood group, atopy, history of tick bites, suspected trigger agent, practice of outdoors activities, exposure to pets and the presence of cofactors was obtained from each participant.

Humans can become an incidental host due to the ingestion of raw or uncooked fish. Cantabria's gastronomy (characterized by fresh and marinated fish consumption) lends itself to contact with live larvae. AS is present in a high percentage of the most abundant species in the Cantabrian Sea. Seropositive anti-AS IgE result without clinical relevance is a frequent finding in our consultations. The objective was to investigate the clinical and risk factors associated with this seroprevalence in Cantabria.Method: Total IgE and anti-AS IgE were determined by means of ImmunoCAP (ThermoFisher\u00d2) in 401 blood donors, selected at random at the Blood and Tissue Bank.

Method: A retrospective analysis was undertaken to evaluate the clinical presentations, diagnostic modalities and response to avoidance measures in Indian patients with CMPA. Diagnosis of CMPA were determined by a detailed clinical history and diagnostic tests. Results: Overall 130 patients were found to have CMPA (males -49.2%; Hb -11.0 \u00b1 1.9 [mean \u00b1 SD). The age at presentation was \u22641 years in 60 (46.2%), 2-5 years in 46 (35.4%), 6-11 years in 18 (13.8%) and \u226512 years in 06 (4.6%) patients. The most common systemic manifestations were respiratory symptoms, skin symptoms followed by gastrointestinal symptoms. Two cases also had angioedema and anaphylaxis. Presence of other food allergies were observed in 13 (10%) of the cases. IgE-mediated CMPA was diagnosed in 85 (65.4%) of the cases and non-IgE mediated CMPA in 45 (34.6%). Patients with IgE-mediated CMPA had more predominantly moderate-severe symptoms (50.8%), while almost all patients with non-IGE-mediated CMPA had mild symptoms (97.8%), P < 0.0001. Additionally, failure to thrive was more common in the IgE-mediated group (14 [16.5%]) as compared to the non-IgE-mediated group positive with the SPT to fresh milk and 54 (63.5%) had a serum milk-sIgE \u22650.35 KAU/L.

Analysis of demographic data and application of the questionnaire \"Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire -Parent Form (FAQLQ-PF)\" to the parents of 74 children with food allergy, followed in an external consultation of Immunoallergology, in a consecutive way for 6 months. Children were between 0-12 years old. In the evaluation of the quality of life questions were analyzed, depending on the age of the child. Each question ranged from 0 to 6 (6 = highest impact on quality of life). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. The test for the normal distribution of the data was performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test (P > 0.05). The groups were divided into age groups. It was studied the existence of a correlation between gender, number of foods involved and type of reaction (anaphylaxis vs without anaphylaxis) with Quality of Life Score (QLS) for each age group.Results: The study included 74 children, 67% of the male gender.The distribution by age group was: 21% with 0-3 years; 35% with 4-6 years and 42% with \u22657 years. Egg allergy (41%) and cow's milk protein allergy (39%) (CMPA) were the most documented, and 43% had multiple allergies. There was a positive, statistically significant and moderate correlation between the number of foods and QLS(r = 0.577, P < 0.001) in the group [0-3]years; a positive, statistically significant and strong correlation between the presence of anaphylaxis and QLS (r = 0.77, P < 0.001) in the group [4-6]years, and a positive statistically significant and moderate correlation between the number of foods (r = 0.509, P < 0.01) and the clinical value (r = 0.574; P < 0.01) in the QLS in the group aged \u22657 years. Conclusion: From the application of the questionnaire and the analysis of the different variables, it was concluded that in patients with FA, the severity of the manifestations and the number of foods involved are associated with a decrease in QLS. This association suggests that it may be advantageous to apply from the type of questionnaires in the approach of patients with FA.

Clinical history: A 23 year old male, from Cape Town, with no significant medical history presented with nasal symptoms and aggravation to dust. He does not have asthma, eczema or any history of food allergy as a child. He resides inland. He had two moderate reactions following shrimp ingestion, involving the skin and gastrointestinal systems. Both reactions were immediate, and responsive to antihistamines.Investigations: IgE testing confirmed a strong sensitization HDM with dermatophagoides pteronyssinus 1 (58.6 kUA/L); dermatophagoides farinae 2 (41.4 kUA/L); blomia tropicalis (9.10 kUA/L).",

To our knowledge this is the first time LTP, OEE2 and thaumatin have been related to Yerba Mate allergy. of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Ergonomics, Division of Ergonomics and Exercise Physiology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, NCU, Bydgoszcz, Poland Introduction: The prevalence of shellfish allergy depends on the climate zone and population. It is assumed that about 0.5%-2.5% of the general population is allergic to shrimps. The best-characterized allergens are tropomyosin, arginine kinase, sarcoplasmic calciumbinding protein and hemocyanin. Case Report: The patient, 28 year old male, was admitted in July 2017 to the Department of Allergology to diagnose the cause of anaphylactic reaction, which occurred 3 months prior to the hospitalization after consumption of king prawns. Immediately after the meal the patient developed pruritus and generalized urticaria as well as swelling of the hands and face. Next the patient developed tachycardia and hypotension. He was administered adrenaline, steroids and antihistamines with good clinical effect. During the diagnosis, the patient had skin prick tests with extracts of food and inhalant allergens, including standardized shrimp allergen extractachieving a positive result for D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae, grass, weeds, cat dander, hazel, birch and alder, but negative for all food allergens tested, including shrimp. The prick by prick tests were performed with fresh royal shrimp (both raw and cooked)with strongly positive results. The concentration of IgE specific to shrimp allergen was elevated-5.25 kU/L, while the concentration of IgE of shrimp tropomyosin was not elevated (ImmunoCap). In addition, concentrations of IgE specific for D. pteronyssinus-9.86 kU/L, D. farinae-7.90 kU/L, grass -19.09 kU/L, cat's dander-2.94 kU/L.",

However, the protein composition and the potential molecular allergens present in this new food matrix have still not been studied in detail and described in the literature. The aim of the present study was the analysis of the potential cross-reactivity between the widespread allergens of shrimps and house dust mites (HDM) and those of crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus).Method: Twelve patients aged 7-50 y.o. and presenting a shellfish and/or HDM allergy were selected on the basis of their positive specific IgE (sIgE) results on ImmunoCAP250 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in particular against two tropomyosins, Der p 10 (HDM, from 0.01 to >100 kUA/L) and Pen a 1 (shrimps, from 14.3 to >100 KUA/ L). A total Gryllodes sigillatus protein extraction was performed and proteins were separated on the basis of their isoelectric point(Ip)    and their molecular weight. Furthermore, 1D and 2D Western blot (WB) were carried out to determine the molecular allergen reactivity profile of each patient serum to the extract.Results: The 1D WB confirmed the anti-HDM and anti-shrimp sIgE reactivity to a 37 kDa molecular weight of cricket protein that could be either the tropomyosin or the arginine kinase (AK). The 2D WB confirmed the reactivity against a 37 kDa protein with an Ip of 3-4 that could be the tropomyosin and/or against a 37 kDa protein with an Ip of 6-7 that could be the AK. Furthermore, another spot of interest located around 17.5 kDa with an Ip of 4 could be the troponin C, another protein described as a molecular allergen in HDM and shellfish, presenting high sequence homology with insect proteins.Conclusion: These preliminary results showed a clear IgE crossreactivity between the cricket tropomyosin and sIgE in the serum of 12 shrimp and/or HDM allergic patients with positive sIgE to Der p 10 and/or Pen a 1. The proteins identified as responsible for this cross-reactivity are tropomyosin, arginine kinase as well as troponin C. These hypotheses will be confirmed by a precise identification by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Food challenges in infants and young children are becoming an increasingly common occurrence in the allergy clinic. This is the result of various factors including (a) recent significant changes in our approach to allergenic food introduction with the aim to prevent the development of food allergy (b) known important advantages in baked milk and egg introduction and (c) importance of differentiating between sensitization and true allergy early in life. Method: We developed a dedicated early life allergy clinic with the aim to encourage food introduction in infants and young children that are able to tolerate this, support introduction of baked milk and egg and differentiate between sensitization and true allergy in young ages. We collected data prospectively on the first 14 patients below the age of 2 years who underwent food challenges with the aim to evaluate safety of this procedure in this age group. Results: Among the first 14 children (median age: 13 months) undergoing food challenges in our clinic, 12/14 (86%) had a negative challenge. Only 2/14 (14%) had a positive challenge and in both cases symptoms were mild and limited to the skin (erythema, hives and eczema exacerbation). Symptoms occurred within 2 hours and treated successfully with a single dose of oral antihistamine. There were no biphasic reactions. Foods challenged included: peanut (5/ 14), baked milk (3/14), baked egg (1/14), almond (2/14), soy (2/14) and sesame (1/14). In 8/14 the food had never been ingested previously.

FeNO measurement was compared with standard testing according to guideline recommendations for asthma management. FeNO measurement was compared and/or combined with reversibility testing, bronchial provocation and sputum eosinophil count. These measures were then evaluated with respect to impact on asthma control, including inhaled corticosteroid use, exacerbations and hospitalizations vs symptoms and lung function as in standard care. Resource use and health outcomes were evaluated over a 1-year time frame. Direct costs were calculated from a German payer perspective (base year: 2017). In the base case only costs for FeNO measurement and asthma medication are taken into account. Extensive univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty in the model. Results: Despite additional cost for FeNO measurement in asthma diagnosis, the base case demonstrated that routine use of FeNO measurement resulted in cost savings of approx. 2EUR in year 1-25 EUR in year 5 per asthma patient compared to standard diagnostic methods. Incorporating costs for hospitalization, physician visits and standard tests, the savings increased to 4EUR in year 1-31 EUR in year 5.

Method: In 2016 was created a register of patients requiring anti-IgE therapy (38 patients) on the basis of the Regional Clinical Hospital #4 in the Chelyabinsk city. Since November 35 patients received omalizumab -9 men (26%) and 26 (74%) women aged 18-63 years, average age 44.5 years, the duration of the disease 25.2 years. All patient were examined by allergologist and diagnosed concomitant allergic pathology: allergic rhinitis-in 100%, atopic dermatitisin 26.5%, food allergy in 44.1%, polynosis in 79.4%. The level of total IgE in the blood from 72 to 787 IU/mL. High sensibilization to household (88.6%), epidermal (62.9%) and pollen (74.3%) allergens was revealed. All patients received basic combined therapy of ICS and LABA in high doses, IV-V stage of therapy. 28 (82.4%) patients additionally took systemic CS, 19 (55.9%) took antileukotriene drugs and 12 (34.3%) took tiotropium. Results: During 12 months of therapy with omalizumab (the drug was administered in accordance with the level of IgE and body weight) were not severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization and administration of systemic CS. The expression of daytime symptoms decreased by 94.8%, nighttime symptoms decreased by 94.5%. The need for using SABA for arresting asthma attacks decreased by 95.8%.

Conclusion: The use of omalizumab in addition to basic therapy in patients with severe atopic uncontrolled asthma along with significant clinical improvement allows us to achieve the normalization of the functional parameters the function of external respiration. Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is used as add-on therapy for moderate to severe persistent atopic asthma in patients with persistent symptoms and frequent exacerbations despite step 4 treatment according to GINA guidelines. Real life studies on this treatment option for our country are limited. For this reason, this study aims to assess the clinical efficacy and treatment outcomes of omalizumab in atopic severe persistent asthma. Method: Patients with atopic severe persistent asthma that were treated with omalizumab between 2009-2017 were retrospectively evaluated. We noted and compared baseline and last results of; symptom scores (GINA categorical), controller medications, blood eosinophil counts, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) values and the number of exacerbations that were treated with systemic corticosteroids at least 3 days within last 1 year. Effect of coexisting aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) on these parameters was also analyzed. Step-down of other asthma medications were tried in patients with symptom control and without exacerbation history within last 6 months. Results: Thirty-eight patients (mean age 50 years, 30 were female) were included in the study. Four had AERD.

            "text": "Asthma affects 334 million persons worldwide. 15 million days are lost due to disability from asthma every year. Omalizumab was first registered in Australia (in 2002 for moderate and 2005 for severe allergic asthma). Until 31st Dec 2016 the estimated exposure worldwide in adult patients was 516 481 patients-years. This analysis estimates the contribution of omalizumab to the reduction in worldwide asthma burden over 15 years. Method: Reduction of asthma burden was estimated in asthma related deaths; exacerbations leading to hospitalization or Emergency Department (ED) visits and improvement in quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Cumulative asthma deaths avoided were calculated by applying exacerbation related mortality on exacerbations leading to: (a) hospitalization (b) hospitalization or ED visit. Annualized exacerbation rates and the QALY gain were based on Brown et al. 2007. Proportions of clinically significant severe exacerbations and of ED visits/hospitalizations by exacerbation type were based on the European registration trial (INNOVATE). Proportion of patients by age was based on a large observational study in 14 countries (eXpeRience) and age specific mortality risks were retrieved from Roberts et al. 2013. Results: Over 15 years omalizumab reduced number of exacerbations leading to: (a) ED visits by 38 580 (2572 per year) and (b) hospitalizations by 74 024 (4935 per year). Overall avoided asthma deaths with type of exacerbation ranged from 527 to 802. At least 37 187 QALYs were gained. Limitations: only deaths avoided in secondary care were included; no inclusion of pediatric population exposed; generalization of mortality risks across different geographies. Conclusion: On average each patient responding to omalizumab gained 1 year and 1 month of full health. Omalizumab reduced asthma deaths by 58% in secondary care. Continuous effort is necessary from all stakeholders to link access to effective treatments to appropriate disease management. Data for asthma mortality risk outside secondary care is warranted. Persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR) often co-exists in asthmatic patients. Intranasal cellulose powder (ICP) was reportedly effective in ameliorating PAR. We aimed to investigate whether ICP is equally effective compared with intranasal corticosteroids in improving asthma control as well as nasal symptoms among children with PAR and allergic asthma (AA). Method: Between July 2015 and September 2016, we did a single center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Asthmatic children aged 6-14 years with mild-to-moderate PAR were randomly assigned to formoterol/budesonide inhalation (4.5 \u03bcg/80 \u03bcg, twice daily) plus intranasal budesonide 64 \u03bcg twice daily (group A), ICP 250 \u03bcg thrice daily (group B), or intranasal placebo 250 \u03bcg thrice daily (group C) for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was change in Asthma Control Test for Children (C-ACT) score from baseline to week 8 post-treatment. Changes in spirometry, peak expiratory flow (PEF), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and visual analogue scale (VAS) for nasal and ocular symptoms were detected as secondary outcomes. Results: We included 121 patients (38 in group A, 41 in group B, and 42 in group C) in full-analysis set. C-ACT score was markedly higher at week 8 compared with baseline (mean difference: 5.11, 6.05, and 4.85 points in groups A, B, and C, respectively; P < 0.05).There were interactions between baseline and treatment in C-ACT scores (P < 0.05). Group B demonstrated greater improvement in C-ACT score than group C among children with baseline C-ACT score of 6-18. 95% CIs of group A at baseline overlapped with those of groups B and C. The treatment achieves reduced VAS symptoms in groups A and B but not in group C. Incidence of adverse events was comparable. No serious adverse event was reported.Conclusion: ICP could be recommended for children with PAR and AA who have poorer asthma control.",

Asthma and BPD are both obstructive lung disease and share some clinical features in childhood, but not totally the same mechanism. In the population with prematurity and BPD, we want to find the differences of respiratory cares in antenatal and postnatal period between children with and without asthma symptoms in young childhood. Method: 441 children with preterm birth (gestational age (GA) <37 weeks) and BPD were enrolled in Mackay Memorial Hospital from 2004 to 2015. All subjects' medical records were retrospectively collected up to 2-8 years of age. All subjects were divided into asthma group and non-asthma group.

Age and gender matched subjects without asthma were enrolled in non-asthma group. Analyzed parameters between the two groups were recorded from the first birth hospitalization, including GA, birth body weight (BBW), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) grade, administered antenatal corticosteroid doses, administered surfactant doses, endotracheal tube inserted days, mechanical ventilator supported days, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) supported days, total oxygen supplied days.The oxygen-supplied days were calculated from birth to total discontinuation of oxygen after discharge.Results: 441 children aged of 2-8 years were enrolled.

Our hypothesis is that sex hormone profile positively affects lung function in adolescent.Method: We prospectively recruited 620 children (10-12 years-old) who participated in the SAP 2017 cohort, sponsored by the Seongnam City Government (Republic of Korea). This study provided assessments of breasts and genitals development according to 5 Tanner stages by the questionnaire and line drawings. Moreover, we also determined each subject's blood sex hormone profile (estradiol and testosterone), oscillometric lung function, body composition (using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis).Results: Among total of 620 children enrolled in the SAP 2017 study group, 457 (73.7%) children met the study criteria for completing the oscillometric lung function test, body composition test, blood sampling. Mediation analysis showed that percentage of lean body significantly involve the association between serum testosterone levels and reactance area (AX) adjusted by age, gender, height, prematurity or low birth weight, passive smoking, aeroallergen sensitization, ever wheezing, and 25-OH vitamin D. Moreover total, direct, and indirect effect effects of testosterone on oscillometric lung function through lean body mass were statistically significant (direct, coefficient = \u22120.055, P <0.001; indirect, coefficient = 4.020, P <0.001). The estimated indirect mediation proportion explanted 24.68% of the association. Human milk (HM) cytokines and in particular transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u00df) appear to be essential in developing and maintaining appropriate infant immune responses. However, role of TGF-\u00df in the prevention of allergic diseases remains controversial. This systematic review aims to provide comprehensive analysis of published studies on the association between HM TGF-\u00df and allergic outcomes in infancy and early childhood. We considered a wide range of allergic outcomes including eczema, food allergy (FA), asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) and allergic sensitization, confirmed by skin prick test and/or sIgE measurement. Method: Extensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library for any prospective, retrospective and crosssectional human study published in English. The risk of bias was assessed in duplicate using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence methodological checklists for intervention (IS) and observational studies (OS). Results: Of 353 hits identified in the databases search 103 relevant papers were screened. Of these, 27 that met the selection criteria were reviewed and 21 studies (9 intervention and 12 observational) were included in the systematic review. Among health outcomes measured, 3 studies assessed the association of HM TGF-\u00df1 and TGF-\u00df2 concentrations and risk of asthma and/or wheezing and/or ARC; 11 risk of eczema and/or FA; and 7 studies assessed both groups of outcomes. Results indicate that TGF-\u00df1 shows either a neutral or protective effect for infant allergic outcomes (differential results for TGF-\u00df2 in colostrum (negative) and mature milk (neutral). There was a high level of heterogeneity among the studies and some studies carried high risk of bias. Conclusion: HM TGF-\u00df is involved in the regulation of inflammation and development of allergy in infancy and may potentially regulate immunological responses during postnatal life and childhood.",

Conclusion: Although the detected incidence of CD in our dermatological department is not so high compared to the global figures, we consider it necessary to perform screening (antibodies to tissue transglutaminase) among patients with poorly treatable atopic dermatitis, all types of atypical dermatitis and alopecia, since a glutenfree diet in case of revealed CD is extremely effective in relation to the skin process. counseled parents (education group) to complete the same questionnaire for comparison purposes. Investigated questionnaire items were (a) washing; (b) moisturizing; (c) skin-care practices; and (d) onset of AD symptoms. Results: The proportion of mothers encountering infant dermal health issues exceeded 80% for both the education and health-check groups; however, among children in the education group, there were significantly fewer AD diagnoses (by a physician) before the age of 18 months compared with the health-check group (5% vs 37%) [[Please confirm.]]. Many parents who had received individual education on skin care in the prenatal and neonatal periods understood proper skin care and could apply these practices appropriately. Conversely, few uncounseled parents understood proper skin care. Conclusion: We suggest that parental acquisition of proper skin care practices in the early neonatal period may prevent AD through practical application. In the future, we plan to present cases effectively utilizing visual and other materials, which we consider to be important for increasing the number of parents educated on Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Allergy and Clinic Immunology, Istanbul, Turkey; 2 Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, Department of Pediatric Allergy and Clinic Immunology, Istanbul, Turkey; 3 Istanbul Okan University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Istanbul, Turkey; 4 Istanbul Bilim University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Istanbul, Turkey Case report: Omalizumab is an immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific, recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that reduces levels of circulating IgE and expression of high-affinity IgE receptors on mast cells. By these effects it decreases proinflammatory mediator release and reduces allergic inflammation. Omalizumab has been approved by the FDA for children aged 12 years and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria who are symptomatic despite treatment with H1 antihistamines.

Deterioration of skin barrier integrity and imbalance of the immune system play a role in the pathogenesis. Infants who have other atopic diseases with severe AD have a higher risk of developing eczema herpeticum. In here we report five cases of infants who have been diagnosed as Eczema herpeticum in the course of AD treatment. Conclusion: Eczema herpeticum can be severe, potentially life threatening disease that occurs mostly in patients with AD. Diagnosis is based upon the clinical findings. Patients often present with grouping vesiculopustular skin lesions over the eczematous skin.Fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, keratoconjunctivitis, meningitis, encephalitis may be seen in the clinical course. Therapy should be started without delay, with high suspicion (blisters in child with AD). Infants with severe atopic dermatitis with extended skin lesions, atopic dermatitis accompanying food allergy, having a long-lasting topical steroid treatment, high serum IgE levels, and high absolute eosinophil count in the peripheral smear are striking identic sings in our case series. Early recognition of this clinical condition in infants will decrease the mortality and dissemination of the disease.",

The avoidance of these proteins is a difficult procedure in view of the widespread use of cow's milk in our diet. Nevertheless, precautions to avoid them should not be restricted to foods.Case report: Seven-month old boy referred to our immunoallergy department for suspected CMPA. He had been exclusively breastfed up to four-months of age. At this age, immediately after his first cow's milk formula intake, he developed an episode of perioral urticaria, with spontaneous resolution in thirty minutes. He featured several subsequent reproducible episodes, with no complaints from other systems. For this reason, a partially hydrolyzed milk was introduced keeping breastfeeding, with good tolerance. Specific IgE assays performed for CMP were negative. At seven-month old immediately after the application of first teeth gingival balm, he started episodes of reproducible perioral urticaria identical to those observed with CMP with spontaneous resolution in less than sixty minutes. Skin prick tests (SPT) performed with commercial extracts (Bial-Aristegui Lab) for cow's milk and its protein fractions and the culprit balm were positives. We also carried out SPT with the balm in five atopic controls that were all negatives. It was found milk proteins in the ingredients list of the balsam under the name of \"Lactis proteinum\". Based on these results it was recommended absolute avoidance of CMP and extensively hydrolyzed formula as an alternative to breast milk.",

The level of stress is related with different kind of allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and eczema that infants, toddlers and other children can develop. Case report description: A nine year old boy presented to our hospital clinic with severe itching and severe atopic dermatitis complicated with infection. Her grandmother and her uncle took care of him and brought him to the hospital as his father lives in another country and he is working abroad to secure with very difficulties incomes for his family as a construction worker. Her mother works night and day to earn something for the whole family as they have a difficult life in a village. Both of the parents have low level of education. The symptoms had begun three years ago with itching and skin redness in hands and face. During the last 2 years he had also cough during the night and after effort or exercise. He had a positive family history for atopic diseases. Methods and materials: The pediatric specific IgE revealed sensitization to soya, dog epithelia and cat epithelia. The boy loved of play with dogs and cats and he spent lots of time with them instead of staying with other kids, who refused to stay or teased him on a regular basis because of the skin lesions. This was the major boy's problem. He suffered o lot and everyone could recognize disappointment in his face. Skin prick tests to foods and inhalant allergens resulted negative.

Allergy and CD are triggered by one to a few proteins in a food source, with unique proteins triggering responses in different patients. Avoiding consumption of triggering foods is necessary to protect allergic and CD affected consumers. There are no highly specific tests to predict the potential allergenicity or CD potential of individual proteins. Thus identification of offending proteins and comparison of new proteins is essential to evaluate safety. Allergen and CD databases on www.AllergenOnline. org were updated in January 2018 to provide tools for comparison. Method: Entries in the NCBI Protein database and the WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature database were reviewed to identify potential new allergens. Literature searches were performed using PubMed for references demonstrating IgE binding and allergenic as well as CD activity. Sequences and references were entered into an archival system. Data collection and expert reviews were as published in 2016 for allergens (PMID: 26887584), and as presented in the EAACI Congress in Geneva in 2013. The CD database includes sequences of peptides from prolamin and glutelin proteins of wheat, barley, rye and oats that bind HLA DQ 2 or DQ 8 and stimulate CD4 + T cells from CD patients. A few that are toxic to intestinal epithelial cells are included. Peptides described by the European Food Safety Authority in 2017 for CD are included. Results: AllergenOnline version 18 was updated in January, 2018. It includes 2101 protein sequences from 834 taxonomic protein groups representing allergens or putative allergens (IgE binding proteins) for FASTA comparisons.

Taking these facts into account, local control of real threats has been conducted and disease maps as well as maps of most frequent sensitizers have been drawn up. One of markers of sensitization prevalence can be sIgE (specific immunoglobulins). The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of specific IgE in relation to inhalant allergens in a Polish population of children and adults likely to be allergic, and evaluating the obtained data for potential geographical differences.Method: Results of sIgE were collected from different labs in Poland performing the quantitative multiparameter enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Polycheck \u00ae , Biocheck GmbH, M\u00fcnster, Germany). Collected results were arranged according to voivodeships. Statistical analysis was done using Statistica 10 (StatSoft Polska). Results: This study collected 237 017 results of sIgE concentration (in kU/L) for 46 inhalation allergens which were analyzed for 16 267 patients with a suspicion of allergy. Data from 13 among Poland's sixteen voivodeships were collected. Voivodeships where the number of assays was less than 100 were excluded in the analysis. Gender proportions were approximately balanced. 42% of total number of patients were children younger than 3 years old. Among inhalant allergens, 10 with the largest number of positive results were these against Dermatophagoides farina (25%), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (23%), alder (22.5%), dog (22%), hazel (22%), rye (19%), birch (19%), timothy grass (18%), cat (18%) and oak (13%).

Exclusive breast-feeding and avoidance of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can be safely recommended. However, some concepts about primary prevention of asthma vary among different specialists and generalists. Mexican Asthma Guidelines (GUIMA 2017) were published as an effort to unify asthma diagnosis and management.Method: As part of GUIMA dissemination strategy and to detect distinct physicians' current concepts on Asthma, an online survey was sent out to members of participating societies containing some of the clinical questions of GUIMA. Replies concerning prevention of asthma were analysed per specialty against the GUIMA 2017 experts' recommendations/suggestions; differences between specialists (allergists, pulmonologists, ENT, paediatricians and primary physicians) were investigated. Results: Vaccination against bacteria or virus does not increase risk for development of asthma and therefore GUIMA primary prevention of asthma in the child. Only half of the clinicians agreed on this statement (50-61.2%), indicating many physicians still tend to prescribe restriction diets to pregnant and breastfeeding women. GUIMA recommends against the delayed introduction to allergenic food in children to decrease the risk of developing asthma. However, most clinicians answered in favour of delayed introduction. There were important differences between ENTs, allergists and paediatricians (respectively, 82.4%, 65.4% and 53.6% in favour of delayed introduction). Conclusion: There are several factors that might increase or decrease the risk of asthma development, some of them amendable to manipulation. Their correct identification is quite important.

Method: Our clinical study was performed in allergological center \"Umit\", Astana, Kazakhstan in 2010-2017, and enrolled totally 34 patients with cholinergic urticaria. The special allergological questionnaires were completed. All patients signed written informed consent for publication. Diagnosis was made on the basis of approved GA 2 LEN consensus panel recommendations (2009). Study population was divided into two groups: 12 (35.3%) Mongolian and 22 (64.7%) Caucasian. Results: In the first group there were 9 (75%) men and 3 (25%) female with mean age of 24.3 \u00b1 2.3 years, whereas in the second group (Caucasian) there were 17 (77.3%) men and 5 (22.7%) female with mean age of 26.5 \u00b1 1.9 years, showing the prevalence of male gender in both study groups and age homogeneity.

Samples were taken from March 1 until October 31. Slides were analyzed with a mean of three horizontal transects in the years 2009-2012 and by the 12 vertical transects since then. Daily average pollen and spore concentrations were calculated and analyzed. Results: Intense Alternaria spores concentrations overlapped with grass, mugwort and ragweed pollen seasons, beginning in May and ending in October. The highest Alternaria spore concentrations were seen in the mid of July during a short gap between intense Poaceae and Artemisia pollination followed by start of Ambrosia season. High levels of Alternaria spores, exceeding the symptom threshold for this spore type (100 spores per cubic meter of air) were seen during the ragweed high pollen season. Alternaria season lasted at least two weeks longer than that of pollen producing species including Ambrosia. Thus, Alternaria can be a potential trigger of symptoms in late September and in October when pollen counts are low. Conclusion: Alternaria should be considered as the potential agent of seasonal allergy from May to October in Ukraine when grasses and weeds pollinate. Further studies are needed to determine the connection between high Alternaria spore concentrations and symptoms of sensitive individuals. 1374 | Mugwort season in Ukraine in association with the ragweed pollen season Institute of New England, Gardner, MA, George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, Dc, United States Background: Artemisia pollen is an important allergen, which initiates the weed pollen season in Ukraine. Due to its occurrence overlapping with Ambrosia pollen, symptoms that have been induced by mugwort pollen often continue during the ragweed pollen season. This study analyzes the timing of Artemisia season in Central Ukraine and overlap with the Ambrosia pollen season. Method: Pollen counts were obtained from 2009 to 2017 using volumetric methods employing a Burkard trap placed at a height of 25 meters above the ground on the roof of a Vinnitsa Medical University building. Samples were taken from March 1 until October 31. Slides were analyzed with a mean of three horizontal transects in the years 2009-2012 and by the 12 vertical transects since then. Daily average pollen concentrations were obtained and analyzed. Results: Artemisia season onset varied from July 3 to July 30 with tendency for earlier pollen season start during the years of research. Artemisia pollen peak varied within 10 days from August 5-15. The season ended September 10 to October 19. No clear tendency to a later peak or season end was observed. The annual mugwort pollen index decreased up to 3.8 fold in 2015 when droughts were recorded in Ukraine in comparison with the years of most intense pollination (2011-2012).For Ambrosia this coefficient was 5.4 showing greater impact of droughts on ragweed pollination. The Artemisia season was characterized by two pollination waves in every year, the first being more intense from July 21 to August 25, the second being from September 4 and 22, almost completely coinciding with the second period of intense Ambrosia pollination seen in September in Vinnytsia. From August 11 to August 23, mugwort season overlapped with the high ragweed season in Vinnytsia, the Ambrosia season starting 17 days later than Artemisia. Intensity of the both seasons decreased gradually after September 24 but some mugwort pollen could be seen in the second fortnight of October. Conclusion: Active mugwort pollination is seen in Vinnytsia from mid of July to the end of October with overlap from mid August to the end of the season with ragweed pollination, intense pollen emission from both species noted from August 16-23 and from September 4-22. 1377 | Alternative Method for the measure of the biological particles in the air: Brussieu, France; 2 PLAIR, Plan-Les-Ouates, Switzerland Background: The particles with a biological origin transported by the wind, as pollen grains and mold spores, are present in the air sometimes in very important concentrations according to the seasons.

The aim of this work is to analyze, from an aerobiological point of view, the general behavior of Olea pollen in the atmosphere of central Spain and to relate the allergy risk of the olive pollen according to the abundance of the olive grove surfaces. Method: Sampling was carried out in central Spain at six pollen stations of the Castilla-La Mancha Aerobiology Network, located in the main cities of Castilla-La Mancha region. Olea pollen grains were recorded during a period of five years (2009-2013) using Hirst volumetric spore traps, following the protocol established by the International Association of Aerobiology. The Annual Pollen Integral, APIn (summation of the average daily pollen concentrations during the year) and the number of days on which daily pollen concentrations exceeded allergy-risk thresholds proposed for the Spanish Aerobiology Network, were calculated. Results: Results showed that the olive pollen season in central Spain started between the end of April and the second week of May, and ended between the second week of June and the beginning of July. The highest APIn values for the period of five years have been obtained in Ciudad Real and Toledo, although with a high year-to-year variability (7754 \u00b1 2771 and 7171 \u00b1 3056 pollen grains/ m 3 and year). These two cities, capitals of their provinces, have similar olive cultivation areas that cover almost 270 000 ha, which represents up to 70% of the olive groves in the region. Ciudad Real and Toledo also showed the highest amounts of the maximum daily pollen concentrations (977 \u00b1 284 and 1441 \u00b1 925 pollen grains/m 3 ) and the greatest number of days with high risk allergenic levels (14 \u00b1 5 and 11 \u00b1 4 days). The number of days with moderate allergenic levels (50-200 pollen grains/m 3 ) was close to 10 days in all six pollen stations, including those where olive groves are more reduced. Conclusion: There is a clear relationship between a large surface of the olive groves and the high APIn and the days with high risk of allergy. But, the number of days of moderate allergy risk has been similar at all sampling sites regardless of the surface of olive groves. To study the general behavior of Olea pollen in an aerobiological network in central Spain allows to classify different areas in order to optimize the prevention of the pollen allergy. Today, more than 300 million of the population is known to suffer from one or other allergic diseases affecting the socio-economic quality of life. Major causative agents implicated are pollen grains, fungal spores, dust mites, insect debris, animal epithelia, etc. Several aerobiological studies have been conducted in different parts of the world to ascertain air concentration and seasonality of pollen grains and fungi. The flowering time of higher plants are events that come periodically in each season, but the time of blooming may differ from year to year, in different geographic locations. Based on differences recorded in several years of observations in airborne pollen, pollen calendars are drawn as an aid to allergy diagnosis and management. The aim of this study was to create 5-years pollen calendar for the capital of Georgia. Method: The airborne pollen monitoring was performed with a Burkard Seven Day Volumetric Spore-trap (Burkard Manufacturing Co Ltd, UK) during 5 years (2013-2017), following the recommendations of European Aerobiology Society. Pollens concentration was calculated and expressed as the number of pollen grains per cubic meter of air (p/m 3 ). Pollen index was defined as the total number of pollen grains during the pollination period. The main pollen season includes 95% of the seasonal total pollen count, starting on the day on which 2.5% of total pollen was recorded and ending on the day on which 97.5% of total pollen was registered. Results: The pollen calendar includes 34 pollen types. Cupressaceae (43.6% of total annual amount), Platanus (10.3%), Morus (6.5%), Ulmus (5.9%), Artemiasia (4.3%) and Populus (3.9%) are the main pollen produced taxa. The annual Pollen Index is 36 895 grains, 82.6% of pollen is recorded during the February-May. The longest pollination period was observed for Asteraceaeseason duration was 162 days and Poaceae-season duration was 132 days. The obtained results show that Corylus started the pollen season in Tbilisi at the middle of January. The latest flowering taxa was Cedrus, the exposure of pollen started the late of October. Conclusion: This pollen calendar for Tbilisi is the first that has been created based on 5 years pollen count data. It represents a useful tool for clinical guidance intended for local allergy sufferers, either the local or foreign population and can be used to prevent and manage allergic respiratory diseases. Symptoms of pollen allergy are associated with the exposure of an affected individual to airborne pollen allergens, such as birch (Betula verrucosa) which is regarded as the most allergenic form of tree pollen in the majority of Europe. However, routes other than inhalation should also be considered and may be an important factor in sensitisation. Our primary objective was to determine whether Bet v 1 could be detected in settled house dust samples taken during the birch pollination season, and consequently, at what levels the allergen is present. Method: All dust samples were obtained using DUSTREAM \u00ae collectors in homes across Western and Central European countries. From these samples, a final selection was made based on country of origin and the date collected to provide us with a cohort reflective of the flowering season which spans from late March to May. Bet v 1 allergen was measured quantitatively in household dust extracts using multiplex assay technology (MARIA) and a specific Bet v 1 ELISA 2.0 EP kit.",

Street level pollen were monitored once every week (April-June) at three locations in the city of Leiden, during the morning, midday and evening. Statistical analyses were performed using the software package STATA 14.0 (StataCorp, TX). Results: The correlation between the different pollen types collected by the pollensniffer and the Burkard sampler was high (correlation coefficient [CC] >0.8). During the validation experiments the pollensniffer appeared to collect on average 7 times more pollen than the Burkard sampler. Street level (pollensniffer) and roof top level pollen counts (Burkard sampler) showed a very good correlation (CC > 0.85). Local street level measurements in the city of Leiden showed that plane trees in one park produced pollen a week before the plane trees in another park. Grass pollen were observed at street level 4 weeks before the pollen were observed at roof top level.Conclusion: Pollen numbers collected by the pollensniffer and the Burkard correlate well, but the pollensniffer collected on average 7 times more pollen than the Burkard sampler. Street level measurements showed differences in pollen loads between locations. Furthermore, street level grass pollen were detected 4 weeks before they were observed at rooftop level.

The aim of this study was to identify the common allergens seen in atopic patients from Bangalore, India. Method: This was a retrospective analysis of the patients with a clinical history of allergic disorders undergoing the skin prick test (SPT) from May 2015 to April 2017. SPT was performed with standardized allergens marketed by Merck, Allergopharma, Hollister Stier and nonstandardized allergens (for those where standardized allergens are not available) marketed by a local Indian manufacturer. As a clinical practice, allergens for the SPT were selected as per the presenting history of the patients. A wheal diameter of \u22653 mm was taken as a positive reaction. Results: A total of 297 patients underwent the SPT (age: 0.5-74.3 years; males: 56.2%). The maximum number of patients (147; 49.5%) were in the age group of \u22650.5 to\u226412 years old. Of the 297 patients, 235 (79.1%) patients showed positive skin test to \u22651 allergen; with 20 (6.7%) being monosensitized, 35 (11.8%) sensitized to 2 allergens and 180 (60.6%) patients sensitized \u22653 allergens. An age trend towards increase in the number of sensitizations (\u22653) was evident from our data, in the age group of >18 years 71.6% were sensitized to \u22653 allergens compared to 49.7% in the ages\u22650.5 to\u226412 years. The house dust mites-which were tested in 287 patients-were the most common sensitizers in our population (D. pteronyssinus [184; 64.1%] and D. farinae [180; 62.7%]). The other common sensitizers were the cockroach (42.6%), [HM1] Lepidoglyphus destructor (36.4%), mosquito (27.4%), Prosopus juliflora (18.5%), shrimp (17.3%), Plantago lanceolata (16.4%), Acarus siro (16%), and Chenopodium album (12.8%). Along with the house dust mites the above allergens were the top 10 sensitizers in our population. Amongst the moulds and animal dander the most common sensitizers were Alternaria alternata (11%) and Cat dander (12.3%). Conclusion: This data reemphasizes that most patients presenting to a speciality allergy clinic are polysensitized and that there is an increase in the number of sensitization with an increase in age. Additionally, it strengthens the importance of the house dust mites as a major sensitizer in Indian patients (especially the Pediatric patients).

Results: An increase in the level of total IgE, a decrease in T-lymphocyte (CD3), T-helper (CD4), and an increase in IL-4, IL-5, was revealed in both the first and second groups compared to the group of healthy children. At the same time, a significantly increased content of Th2-marker cytokines IL-4, IL-5 was also noted in the group of healthy children. And when carrying out an allergic-specific examination (RIDA qLine \u00ae Allergy, Germany), the presence of sensitization by various allergens at the level of subclinical values was established.Conclusion: The revealed changes in immunological indices with the corresponding anamnestic data give grounds for the development of programs for primary prevention of allergy in persons who are predisposed to the development of this disease. and shellfish indicating cross-reactivity.

Initially, he presented to the emergency department with rectal bleeding. During the same visit, he was diagnosed as having folliculitis. He was started on oral steroids for his newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis, and subsequently the skin eruption became more widespread with more intense pruritus. A skin biopsy showed spongiotic dermatitis with possible allergic contact dermatitis. He was treated with numerous high-potency topical steroids, which made his condition unbearable. During his allergy evaluation, a skin test reaction for house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae) was positive. The negative control containing 0.9% saline showed no reaction. The panel of antigens also included trees, grasses, weeds, and molds, which produced negative reactions.Owing to the positive skin test reaction to the house dust mite, he was referred to a dermatology clinic to rule out scabies. The differential diagnosis included scabies, folliculitis, impetigo, arthropod bites, tinea, eczema, and contact dermatitis.A skin biopsy showed a subcorneal mite in the spongiotic epidermis. A brisk lymphocytic infiltrate with numerous eosinophils was present in the dermis. The characteristic skin biopsy findings were diagnostic of scabies. He was started on oral ivermectin and permethrin 5% cream, which resulted in complete resolution of his symptoms and the eruption within a few days. The scabies mite (Sarcoptes scabiei) and the house dust mite are related phylogenetically. Circulating immunoglobulin E antibodies against scabies mite antigens show cross-reactivity with house dust mite antigens and result in positive skin test reactions in most patients with scabies. The positive skin test reaction to the dust mite antigen and the fact that it was the only positive skin reaction among the panel of antigens being tested were helpful in the diagnosis of scabies in this otherwise non-atopic patient.

However, none of the standardized oak pollen extracts commercially available.Method: For the standardization, bioequivalent allergy unit (BAU) was determined by quantitative intradermal skin test using sawtooth oak pollen extracts. IgE reactivity was compared with oak mix (red, virginia live, and white oak) pollen extract (1:20 w/v, 20 000 PNU/ mL), which is widely used for the diagnosis and immunotherapy even though none of these oaks are native to Korea.Results: Strong IgE reactions to 17 kDa allergens, putative PR-10 family proteins, were observed by IgE immunoblotting in both sawtooth and white oak pollen extracts. Sums of erythema of 50 mm by intradermal skin test were calculated to be 13.05th dilutions. Therefore, the allergy potency of sawtooth oak pollen extract was 35 391.8 BAU/mL. Consequently, it could be calculated that 1:20 w/ v (20 000 PNU/mL) is equivalent to 28 508.1 BAU/mL (i.e. 0.701 BAU/PNU).

The mean (SD) change in the VAS score from baseline to week 9 of treatment with 500U and 1000U C1-INH was 10.4 (19.0) and 21.6 (13.4), respectively, suggesting an overall improvement in QoL, particularly with the higher dose. Conclusion: These data in 12 children aged 6-11 years indicate that treatment with both 500U and 1000U IV C1-INH (but particularly with 1000U C1-INH) for the routine prevention of HAE attacks improved patients' overall health status or QoL as measured by the EQ-5D-Y. Angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) imposes a considerable burden on patients and their families, both during and between angioedema episodes. Clinical manifestations exhibit high intra-and inter-individual variability and angioedema attacks occur with unpredictable frequency and severity. The reasons for the high variability and unpredictability of C1-INH-HAE manifestations are still poorly understood. Physical trauma, stress, anxiety, and low mood are among the trigger factors most frequently reported by patients. Initial results from a qualitative research in pediatric HAE show that, in the attempt to \"avoid HAE triggers\", parents may impose heavy limitations in children's everyday life and even implicitly suggest them to deny unpleasant emotional states and distress. This may paradoxically worsen children's competence to manage the disease and have a negative impact on health outcomes. A multidisciplinary team composed by psychologists and medical doctors developed a tool based on the lay experts' voice that could help parents of children with C1-INH-HAE to foster an effective management of their children's disease and reduce its psychological burden. Method: Information included in the booklet are based on qualitative data collected by semi-structured interviews on the disease experience administered to parents of children with C1-INH-HAE in four Italian HAE referral centers. This project is part of a broader mixed-method research on the relation between emotional processing and HAE in pediatrics which showed impaired emotion regulation and high levels of perceived stress among children with C1-INH-HAE. Results: the Italian booklet addressed to parents contains suggestion for the management of their children disease in daily life. The main areas discussed are: prompt symptoms recognition and selfmanagement of the disease, fostering children's autonomy, dialogical exchanges tailored on children's need for knowledge on the disease. Conclusion: patients and their caregivers are the stakeholders and the direct experts of their disease. More efforts are needed to involve them in research-design and acquisition of knowledge especially in rare diseases. Clinician too can rely on the booklet to promote a wider space for parents' comprehension, elaboration and management of the disease. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) with C1-inhibitor deficiency type I/II often manifests in childhood or adolescence. However, evidence-based treatment guidance for paediatric patients (particularly those aged 2-5 years) is scarce, and safe dosing for these patients is critical. Weight-based dosing of icatibant (0.4 mg/kg) for acute treatment of HAE attacks in children and adolescents was well tolerated and effective in a phase 3 study, but resulted in lower exposure (area under the curve [AUC 0-6 ]) than the recommended adult 30 mg (3 mL) dose. Additionally, calculating weight-based dosage during a HAE attack can be burdensome, particularly in time-sensitive situations. A 5-weight-band (5WB) dosing strategy was evaluated for its ability to achieve comparable icatibant exposure to weight-based dosing in paediatric patients.Method: Modeling and simulation of the relationship between age and weight with exposure and peak concentration of icatibant in paediatric patients was conducted using 6000 virtual patients based on Centers for Disease Control growth charts for age groups 2-5 years, 6-11 years, and 12-17 years.

The research of HAE in China began in the 1980s. Later studies identified clinical characteristics of Chinese patients different from the western population. The Objectives of this study are as follows: (a) to summarize the past research progress of HAE in Chinese population; (b) to evaluate the economic burden and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in China for the first time. Method: Forty-two articles concerning HAE (both in English and in Chinese language) since 1980 were systematically reviewed to describe the characteristics of Chinese patients. A web-based survey focusing on economic burden and HRQoL (using SF-36) was performed recently.Results: Type 1 HAE (98.73%) accounts for the majority of Chinese HAE patients while no type 3 HAE patient has been diagnosed in China to date. Compared with other populations, the onset age (21.25 years) of Chinese HAE patients is later, and the percentage of abdominal attacks (34.18%) is lower. The first mutation spectrum of SERPING1 has been established and a total of 56 mutations have been reported among Chinese patients. Currently, there is no approved drug for acute attacks in Chinese market, and the choices for long-term prophylaxis are limited to Danazol and Tranexamic acid. Danazol has demonstrated good efficacy and was tolerated in most of Chinese patients although it has some side effects, especially at the beginning of the treatment with higher doses. Edematous attacks could be effectively prevented with a dosage at or under 200 mg/d in 80% patients.

This study was designed to assess the economic and humanistic burden associated with HAE in China.Method: This is a cross-sectional study, in which two web-based surveys were conducted in 94 and 89 patients respectively, to assess the economic and humanistic burden before and after confirmed diagnosis. Collected information includes individual's health care resource use, direct and indirect costs, and impacts on work, school and social activities.Results: Seventy-five and eighty-four HAE patients responded to two surveys with complete information, respectively. Patients spent a mean of 152.1(0-553) months, visit 5.5(1-20) hospitals and 11.4(1-100) doctors before confirming diagnosis. Before HAE diagnosis was established, patients on average paid 5.2 (0-30) visits to outpatient clinics, 2.6 (0-20) visits to emergency rooms and 1.1(0-8) visits to inpatient departments each year. Patients reported a direct cost of 13232.0 CNY (1679.6 EUR) and indirect cost (transportation, productivity loss) of 10968.2 CNY (1392.2 EUR) per year before diagnosis. Workers lost a mean of 27.4(0-200) days annually while students lost 11.7(0-60) days per year. Swellings impeded social activities in 96 percent HAE patients, which resulted an annual loss of 21.4(0-200) social-active days. After diagnosis and treatment, patients reported significantly less working day loss (14.3 days/year, P < 0.001), direct costs (1132.1 CNY/year, P = 0.032) as well as indirect costs (3224.4 CNY/year, P = 0.003). Visits to out-patient clinics (2.8 times/year, P = 0.001), emergency rooms (1.3 times/year, P < 0.001), in-patient departments (0.5 times/year, P = 0.007) are also significantly decreased. Patients also suffered from less social-active day loss after diagnosis and treatment (17.7 days/year, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Our study was the first to describe the economic and humanistic burden of HAE in China. The diagnosis of HAE is considerably delayed in China, resulting in inappropriate use of medical resource and negative influence on productivity, education and social activities.

If production of these serum proteins gets excessive due to a strong inflammation, cytokines get into the plasma and can be detected in the serum of patients. The relationship between the concentration of serum proteins in patients with AE and the severity of their disease is extensively discussed in the scientific community.Method: We use measurements of 32 serum proteins from patients with AE and healthy controls to model the severity of AE using different statistical tools.",

The mean keloid volumes significantly reduced in the intervention group after 4 weeks of treatment (7.7% in phase 1 and 12.9% in phase 2), which were significantly greater than in controls. At 8 weeks (after stopping treatment for 4 weeks), the mean volume in the intervention group increased to near baseline. The reduction in keloid volumes significantly correlated with the dosage of triamcinolone loaded. For pain and itch, the intervention group demonstrated lower scores at 4 or 8 weeks compared to baseline. There were no side effects registered. Conclusion: Treatment with triamcinolone-embedded dissolving microneedles resulted in significant reduction in the keloid volumes and is associated with reductions in pain and itch.

IL4 and IL10 are anti-inflammatory cytokines, regulators of the immune response. Aim: To study the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of cytokine genes IL4 (rs 2243250), IL10 (rs1800872) and their association with levels of IL-4 and IL-10 in blood serum in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Method: We formed 3 cohorts: 1-PS (n = 49), 2-PsA (n = 48), 3 -control group healthy blood donors (n = 35). All individuals were Russians from Krasnoyarsk Territory (Siberia). DNA extraction was performed from blood by standard salting-out method. Genotyping of SNPs of IL4 and IL10 genes was performed by PCR and restriction fragment length analysis. Cytokine levels were measured by ELISA. Genotype frequencies were tested for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) by Fisher's exact test also, we used non-parametric test in \u00abStatistica 6.0\u00bb. Results: The frequency of genotype C/C (rs 2243250) gene polymorphism and (rs 1800872) gene polymorphism was predominant between studied groups (P > 0.05). The concentration of IL-4 in serum was not associated with the genotypes of the (rs 2243250) IL4 gene polymorphism in PS and PsA in comparison with the control group (P > 0.05). Data revealed that the rare A-allele (rs 1800872) IL10 is statistically significant associated with lower concentration of IL-10 in serum in PS patients (P = 0.04), as opposed to C-allele (rs 1800872) IL10 associated with lower concentration of IL-10 in blood serum in PsA (P = 0.02). Conclusion: We identified differences in association of lower IL-10 concentration with rare A-allele (rs 1800872) genotype in PS and Callele (rs 1800872) IL10 in PsA. So, potential marker of development PS may be the presence of rare A-allele (rs 1800872) genotype, whereas C-allele IL10-the marker of the psoriatic arthritis. However, it is only the tendency to association as marker of PS and PsA development and type of psoriatic disease progression.

This has been associated to cefoxitin and the patient was charged to avoid 2nd generation cephalosporin. In November 2016, whilst in recovery room 20 minutes after 4th cystoscopy, he developed oropharyngeal tightening, dyspnea, hypotension and loss of consciousness with succeeding cardiorespiratory arrest in asystolia. Cardiac resuscitation was initiated immediately with recovery to sinus rhythm after 2 minutes. Orotracheal intubation was performed and invasive ventilation was initiated with recovery of consciousness. Simultaneously he developed generalized acute urticaria. He was extubated on the same day and transferred to an intensive care unit for clinical stabilization. On follow-up procedures iodopovidone was used as local disinfectant and local anesthesia was performed with lido-caine+chlorhexidine lubricant gel. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy was not performed in all. The allergologic investigation revealed negative specific Ig E for latex and \u03b2-lactams, negative skin prick test (SPT) to iodopovidone and latex and negative skin prick and intradermal test to lidocaine, PPL, MDM, amoxicilin, penicillin, cefoxitin, cefazolin and cefuroxime.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) also play an important role in the pathogenesis of severe chronic airway inflammation. Th17 related cytokines are key cytokines in the host immune response against mucosal infection. However, the post infectious immune response, especially response after viral and bacterial co-infections, are still poorly understood. Method: 7 Inferior turbinate (IT) and 9 chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP) samples were separately inoculated with HRV16 alone or together with S. aureus. The morphology of infectious explants was checked by immunofluorescence staining. Th17 cell related cytokines IL-6, IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22 were measured in supernatants of model by Luminex. Th17 response related pathways were evaluated by western blot. Results: HRV and S. aureus co-infection caused major tissue damage, which HRV and S. aureus invaded into the epithelium through the intercellular spaces and occasionally reached the basement membrane, in comparison with HRV infection alone conditions in both CRSwNP tissue and controls. Obviously, more S. aureus colonization were observed in CRSwNP tissue than controls. HRV infection induced IL-6 and IL-17 release in CRSwNP tissue, and IL-17 in IT tissue. Cytokines IL-6 and IL-17 were down-regulated, when nasal tissues were infected with both HRV and S. aureus. However, IL-21 and IL-22 were up-regulated in CRSwNP mucosal tissue after HRV and S. aureus co-infection in comparison with HRV alone and control. In contrast to HRV alone and control, HRV and S. aureus co-infection resulted in a decreased expressions of STAT3 and pSTAT3 in CRSwNP tissue. Conclusion: Th17 immune response is partially impaired in HRV and S. aureus co-infection in CRSwNP tissue, with a decreased STAT3 and pSTAT3 expressions in JAK-STAT pathway, which might be associated with major tissue damage in coinfection condition. 1498 | The effects of allergen (DP/DF) on mucociliary transport of allergic rhinitis patient In S Konyang university hospital, Daejeon, South Korea",

Measurement of the intensity of respiratory burst of monocytes was carried out through determination of the activity of lucigeninand luminol-dependent spontaneous and induced chemiluminescence. Statistical analysis was performed by the software package Statistica 6.1 (StatSoft Inc., 2007). Results: Determination of the functional activity of monocytes in patients with PRS included the assessment of oxygen-dependent phagocytosis system by measuring the chemiluminescent activity of the cells and oxygen-independent phagocytosis. In the study of luminoland lucigenin-dependent activity of monocytes in response to induction of MRSA, there was registered the decrease of intensity of chemiluminescence of the reaction by 3-fold and increasing activity of monocytes by 1.5-fold related to the spontaneous activity of the cells. Under the study oxygen-independent phagocytosis of monocytes in response to exposure to MRSA relative to MSSA, there was detected a decrease in phagocytic numbers of total monocytes by 2 fold. Evaluation of the activity of the subpopulation composition of monocytes in the presence of MRSA strains showed a decrease in the phagocytic index of the subpopulations CD14 low CD16 +monocytes and the phagocytic number of CD14 + CD16 + cells in 2 fold and the phagocytic number of subpopulations CD14 + CD16 \u2212 monocytes in 2 fold relative to MSSA strains.Conclusion: There is a decrease in phagocytic activity of monocytes relative to MSSA, in patients with PRS in response to exposure to MRSA. It can be assumed that the induction of MRSA functional activity of monocytes is suppressed.",

The degree of OA activity may be associated with synovial fluid (SF) and blood T-cell subsets, indicative of inflammation. Method: Blood and synovial fluid samples from 19 patients with the OA of knee (M17.0) were assessed for SF and blood T-cell subsets by flow cytometry: CD4 + CD45RB + CD45RA + CD62L \u2212 inflammation-related cells (IRC), Na\u00efve T-cells (CCR7 + CD45RA + ), TCM (CCR7 + CD45RA -), TEM (CCR7 \u2212 CD45RA \u2212 ), and TEMRA (CCR7 \u2212 CD45RA + ). Results: The correlation between the activity of the disease and the percent of SF CD4 + TEM cells (R = 0.65, P = 0.002), blood CD4 + TEM (R = 0.61, P = 0.006) and TEMRA (R = 0.70, P = 0.001) cells and IRC (R = 0.57, P = 0.010) was shown. Blood TEMRA cells absolute and relative contents were decreased compared with healthy donors (OA patients-8.0 [1.8-37.3], donors-29.9 [21.0-37.0], P = 0.000001). The TEM subset comprised the majority of CD4 + (68.3 [58.6-73.0]) and CD8 + (76.9 [64.8-82.0]) T-cells in the SF of OA patients. There was a positive correlation between the blood TEM/TEMRA and SF TEMRA counts (R > 0.65, P < 0.003) and negative correlation between SF TCM and blood TEMRA count (R < 0.58, P < 0.001). Conclusion: The associations between the activity of OA and TEM/TEMRA counts in blood and SF as well as blood IRC subsets were established. TEM cells seem to migrate into the affected joints and contribute to immune inflammation. Assessment of these T cell subsets may assist in determination of OA activity.

Method: 32 patients with clinical evidence of arthritis have been examined. Patients have been examined under laboratory, immunological, serological and molecular genetic studies to identify the EBVinfections. Results: All the patients were suffering from the arthritic syndrome. Besides, 8(25%) of patients were diagnosed with prolonged subfebrile condition, 15(46.9%) with the chronic fatigue syndrome, 8 (21.8%) with the respiratory syndrome. According to the findings of the research conducted, 7 (21.8%) of patients were presented with positive rheumofactor, 10 (31.2%) with increase in ERS, 9 (28.4%)with increased level of AS(L)O and 12 (37.5%) with increase in CRP concentration. High titers of specific antibodies of class IgM, IgG to the capsid and nucleic antigens EBV and EBV-DNA were found in saliva, mucus scrap and blood of the patients.

Ig levels (g/dL) were IgG:348, IgA:3, IgM:27. Monthly IVIG was indicated, as well as substitution of phenytoin with carbamazepine. Patient presented a progressive improvement in clinical status and Ig levels (IgG:749, IgA:160, IgM:93) normalized after a 48-month period following phenytoin withdrawal. Patient 2: A 46-year-old woman with left brachial palsy, Horner's syndrome and convulsive seizures requiring the use of carbamazepine. Six months later she developed chronic diarrhea, sinopulmonary infections and herpes zoster infection. Ig levels were IgG:450, IgA:14 and IgM:11. Monthly IVIG replacement was indicated as well as carbamazepine suspension. Three years later, IVIG infusion was suspended due to normalization of Ig levels (IgG: 892, IgA: 218 and IgM: 51.9). Patient 3: A 54-year-old man, alcoholic, evolving with seizures after alcoholic libation, was treated with lamotrigine. Six months after starting treatment he presented severe bronchopneumonia with no therapeutic response. On the occasion, Ig levels were IgG:234, IgA:26, IgM:4 and IVIG replacement was indicated. The patient evolved with absence of infections and progressive normalization of Ig levels (IgG:1094, IgA:75.4 and IgM 81.6) and nine months after, IVIG replacement was suspended. IgA and IgM deficiencies related to anticonvulsant therapy that result in recurrent infections have been described whereas decreased serum IgG levels have been reported in a few studies and isolated clinical cases. The pathophysiological mechanisms of the hypogammaglobulinemia secondary to these type of drugs are not completely understood and several studies show the possibility of reversion after its suspension, mainly in childhood. We conclude that the reported disorders of immunoglobulin production were triggered by the introduction of anticonvulsants, evolving with less common complete remission after drug withdrawn in three adult patients.

Method: This study involved 83 patients with allergic rhinitis and/ or asthma, of which 52 received a 156-week course of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), and 31 received only medications (controls). Symptom and medication scores (SMS), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), airway responsiveness to histamine bronchoprovocation (AHR), Der p sIgG4 levels, Der p sIgE levels and the serum inhibitory capacity against Der p sIgE facilitated allergen binding to B-cells (IgE-FAB) were determined during the updosing (week 0, 4, 12 and 16) and maintenance (week 52, 104, 156) phase of SCIT. Results: SCIT patients had significant improvement in SMS from week 52 to 156 compared to medication-treated control subjects (P < 0.05). Levels of Der p sIgG4 in SCIT patients showed a significant increase from week 12 to 156 (P < 0.05). Serum obtained from SCIT patients significantly inhibited Der p sIgE binding to B-cells (IgE-FAB) after 16 weeks (P < 0.01). Significantly lower levels of Der p sIgE were observed in SCIT patients after 52 weeks (P < 0.05). A significant relationship was demonstrated between SMS and IgE-FAB or Der p sIgG4 during the maintenance phase according to linear regression analysis. IgE-FAB had a significant association with AHR only at week 156. Conclusion: Der p sIgG4 level and serum inhibitory capacity against Der p sIgE binding to B-cells (IgE-FAB) are associated with clinical efficacy in the maintenance phase rather than the updosing phase of SCIT.

Since the two systems give different predictive values, the results may not correspond well. However, we recently reported good agreement in the diagnosis of egg allergy. Method: Residual serum samples that specific IgE to milk, casein, wheat, \u03c95-gliadin, peanut, sesame, shrimp, crab, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p), dog, cat and Japanese cedar pollen (JCP) had been measured by ImmunoCAP were collected. Specific IgE to corresponding allergens with 3gAllergy was then measured. Agreement of logarithmically transformed specific IgE values by the 2 methods were tested with linear regression. The samples that gave discrepant results were examined for clinical symptoms and OFC results.Results: Goodness of fit in linear regression yielded R 2 > 0.9 in milk, casein, peanut, wheat, \u03c95-gliadin, Der p and JCP tests. HighR 2 > 0.95 was found in casein, Der p and JCP. R square for crab, shrimp, cat, dog and sesame was relatively low around 0.8. Discrepant results were found mainly in low value range of sIgE, not in high value range, with no association of allergen-induced symptoms. Conclusion: Good agreement of ImmunoCAP and 3gAllergy specific IgE values to common allergen was found. Discrepant results may arise from allergen source and warrant further clinical validation. 0772 | Common dietetic questions in the food allergy clinic: what do families need to know?

A cross-reaction may be observed between structurally similar drugs. In general, in case of development of a FDE against a drug, it is thought that other structurally similar drugs from the same pharmacological group should be avoided. In this case report, a case that developed FDE due to ornidazole, a drug belonging to the azole group, but could tolerate metronidazole will be discussed.Case report: 47 year-old female patient. She admitted to our clinic with oval rashes healing with dark spots in right thumb, left forearm, left thigh and gluteal regions 4-5 hours after concomitant intake of first doses of drugs containing ornidazole and fluconazole. The patient underwent to skin patch test for metronidazole, ornidazole and fluconazole. A positivity for ornidazole was determined. Skin patch tests for metronidazole and fluconazole were negative. Oral provocation tests performed thereupon for metronidazole and fluconazole were determined to be negative. Usage of ornidazole was restricted.Discussion: It should be remembered that ornidazole, which is used commonly in protozoal and anaerobic bacterial infections, may be a cause of FDE. There may be cases that do not exhibit a crossreactivity with other drugs from azole group.0790 | Enteropathy related to angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan: Case studyMontoro De Francisco AM; Mendoza Parra AM; De Vicente Jimenez TM; Garc\u00eda Luque A; Mateos Galvan JM Hospital Central de la Defensa, IMIDEF, Madrid, Spain Background: On August 2012 Rubio-Tapia et al reported an association of olmesartan therapy with an unexplained enteropathy symptomatically resembling celiac disease or sprue. Olmesartan is an Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonist (ARA II) widely used in high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetics. On July 2013 the Food Drug Administration (FDA) approved label changes to include Losartan was the first ARA II commercialized in 1995 and it seems to produce similar Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) that olmesartan. Method: Design: Case series of enteropathy associated with losartan. Scope: Allergy Service, Hospital Central de la Defensa, Madrid. Period: May 2015-Jan 2018: Main variables assessed: demographic and clinical variables, diagnostic criteria, treatment, evolution, causal relationship between drug and enteropathy according to the modified Karch Lasagna algorithm. The patients have given written informed consent for publication. Results: Two female patients 81/77 years, diagnosed of hypertension, treated for three/ten years with losartan 100 mg/day. After starting treatment they refer chronic diarrhea and two/four years ago worsening diarrhea, abdominal pain and weight loss. The patients were treated at the emergency service for episodes of watery, nonbloody diarrhea associated with abdominal bloating. The patients failed conservative management including gluten-free diet, oral antibiotic and corticosteroid. Additionally to diarrheal syndrome, both patients showed other ADR like hoarseness and cough.Allergologic study: immediate and delayed prick test and specific IgE were negative for food. Colonoscopy with colonic biopsies revealed evidence of microscopic colitis in both cases. Treatment: Losartan withdrawal, achieving complete remission in four/two weeks. Conclusion: The allergist should keep in mind this possible and rare ADR in patients treated with losartan (ARA II) showing enteropathy, as discontinuing losartan may lead to clinical improvement.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) and Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) have a significant impact on quality of life. In some cases, CRS may appear as a complication of atopic rhinitis although frequently regarded as coexisting disease. The authors aimed to investigate a possible correlation between atopic sensitization, evidence of microbe colonization and functional bias among subjects with upper respiratory symptoms implying allergy. Method: A total of 151 subjects, hospitalized for allergic-like symptoms from upper respiratory tract were analyzed. Skin prick tests, spirometry and nasal microbiology were performed. Patient`s diagnoses were classified as: Allergic Rhinitis, Allergic Rhinitis with concomitant Sinusitis (AR+ S) and Chronic Rhinosinusitis. Results: Ninety patients (59.6%) were with AR; 39 of them (25.8%) were defined as: AR and concomitant sinusitis. As CRS were identified 66.2% of all patients (n = 100). Sensitized to pollens were 80% of AR patients, while 67.8% had positive skin prick test for perennial allergens. In AR+ S group 79.5% showed pollen allergens (grass and tree), House Dust Mite (HDM) and fungal sensitization (perennial allergens) (P = 0.04). AR patients had 15.6% positive microbiology test while only 12.8% from AR+ S group showed bacteria colonization. Eighty four from all investigated who were positive to tree had explicit data for nasal bacterial carriage also (P = 0.03). AR subjects presented with obstructive type of spirometry in 1.1%. None of AR+S group showed spirometry disturbances. Fifty eight from studied patients presented with fungal sensitization; 40 of them (69%) were positive to HDM while 18 (31%) were negative (P = 0.03). In HDM positive group (55%) 59 (71.1%) subjects were presented with pollen sensitization (P = 0.02).Conclusion: Compared to AR patients those with concomitant sinusitis are sensitized to more allergens.AR patients showed more colonization with pathogenic microorganisms than AR+S group. Therefore being genetically predisposed to atopy AR patients are prone to higher frequency of sinusitis. Spirometric parameters showed not significant differences in all studied groups.Obtained data leave a number of issues to resolve.0800 | Histopathology of ethmoid mucosa versus nasal polyp on diagnosing eosinophilic rhinosinusitisThaitrakool W; Keelawat S; Sukswai N; Aeumjaturapat S; Chusakul S; Kanjanaumporn J; Snidvongs K Faculty of Medicine Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, ThailandBackground: Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS) is one subtype of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) presenting with tissue eosinophilia, comorbidities, and high rate of relapse.

OSAS patients experience intermittent episodes of partial or complete closure of the upper airway during sleep, which lead to intermittent periods of hypoxia in the patient's tissues. Previous research has shown that OSAS can contribute to hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and even cancer. Intermittent hypoxia can be viewed as prolonged continuous hypoxia interrupted by recovery of the normal oxygen supply. Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a nasal inflammatory disease with an increasing prevalence that is mediated by T-helper type 2 cells together with mast cells and eosinophils, as well as a number of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

Case report: The authors present a case of a 41 years old woman, sent to our consultation due to nasal obstruction. The patient had complaints of frontal headache and bilateral nasal obstruction since April of 2015, with more severe obstruction during the day, accompanied by persistent posterior nasal secretions and anosmia. She denied previous symptoms, personal or family history of allergic disease or use of daily medication. She performed skin prick tests to common airborn allergens, mites and fungus, all negative. The patient was medicated with nasal budesonide 64 ug bid, deflazacort 30 mg (short course) without clinical improvement. Due to chronic, refractory symptoms, further investigation was performed. Perinasal CT-scan showed: normal pharynx, no inflammatory abnormalities of the sinus cavities; osteoma on the right side of the ethmoidal bone with dense matrix, well defined limitations with 10 mm of axial diameter. Left septal deviation with bone spur, compressing the inferior nasal concha, thus reducing nasal permeability. After this incidental finding, the patient was sent to the otorhinolaryngology consult and awaits clinical evaluation.Conclusions: Paranasal sinus osteoma is a benign tumor, with slow growth, occurring most commonly in frontal (71.8%), ethmoid (16.9%), maxillary (6.4%) and sphenoid (4.9%) sinuses. Osteomas are commonly observed in third to fourth decades of life. Small osteoma of paranasal sinuses are often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on neuroimaging (3% of cases). Its' size can range in 2 mm -30 mm diameter, resulting in clinical symptoms (localized headache, sinusitis, frontal mucocele, anosmia, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea). Surgery is indicated in this case due to persistent headache. It is essential to investigate all differential diagnosis in patients with chronic relapsing symptoms, as these cases may need surgical treatment.0810 | Validating an electronic tool for monitoring symptoms and treatments for children with Vernal Kerato-conjunctivitisBackground: Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a severe allergic eye disease predominantly affecting pre-pubescent males. Treatment typically involves supportive management with topical antihistamines, mast cell stabilisers and the suppression of inflammation with steroids and / or calcineurin inhibitors. Recently, omalizumab has been reported to be beneficial. There is no universally accepted method at present to systematically gather temporal data on signs, symptoms and health related quality of life (QoL) following clinicalinterventions. An Italian-language validated QoL score (QUICK) specific for VKC has been previously published. This has not been validated for use in English.Method:The existing Italian-language paper-based for VKC symptom tracker (QUICK) was co-adapted to a digital version of VKC-QUICK-\"eQUICK\" with input from 9 children with VKC and 12 healthy young individuals from our Trust's Youth Forum. Stepsincluded -Phase 1: translation to English of the Italian VKC-Quick questionnaire with symbolic pictures to aid responses from pre literate children or for those who do not use English as their first language. Phase 2: piloted/refined paper based tool with VKC affected children and their parents attending the eye/allergy clinic in the hospital. Phase 3: the feedback helped devise an electronic platform (eQUICK) with images. Our Information and Technology Department assisted in relevant graphic design of images. eQUICK can run on iOS or Android enabled mobile devices and desktops allowing reporting by patients in between clinic visits. Responses from these electronic questionnaires upload to a secure online database and integrated with the hospital's existing patient record system. Clinicians access an internal admin application to view patient responses in conjunction with treatments prescribed and relevant parameters collected at the clinic visit/s. This allows progress monitoring and advice on alteration in management if needed.",

Method: We retrospectively studied the files of 65 patients, 20 males and 45 women, mean age 33.6 year (6 to 74 years) suffering from presumed ocular allergy. Skin prick tests and CPT were performed in all cases, whereas specific seric IgE level assessment was done in selected cases. Results: Systemic tests and CPT were concordant in 68% of cases (44/65) and discordant in 32%. Among the patients with positive extraocular allergy testing, ocular allergy to the candidate antigens was ruled out by the CPT in 42% (16/36) of cases. On the opposite,ocular allergy was proven by CPT in 21% of patients with negative systemic allergy testings. Overall, agreement between extra ocular and ocular tests measured by Cohen's Kappa coefficient was poor (K = 0.36). Medical history of rhinitis was not a factor predicting for a better correlation between general and ocular tests (K = 0.35) : CPT was negative in 42% (9/21) of patients with positive systemic testings and rhinitis.Conclusion: The rate of discordance between extraocular and ocular tests is high, meaning that the eye can often be immunologically isolated.

Method: ISAAC written questionnaire added by specific allergic conjunctivitis questions previously validated (main instrument) was filled by adolescents 13-14y/o from Curitiba, Brazil. A representative group was submitted to skin prick tests (SPT) with a panel of regional aeroallergens and answered a supplementary questionnaire on family history, immunization status, infectious diseases, environmental conditions and diet. Results: Four thousand, five hundred and twenty adolescents fulfilled the main instrument and the prevalence of asthma was 17.5%, medical diagnosis of asthma 13.2%, rhinitis 34.7%, rhinoconjunctivitis 20.1%, medical diagnosis of rhinitis 51.1%, atopic eczema 5.9%, medical diagnosis of eczema 13.2% and allergic conjunctivitis 15.5%. Four hundred seventy two were submitted to SPT, 121 (25.6%) had allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) and 232 (49.1%) had conjunctivitis. Thirty eight (32.2%) of ARC patients had asthma versus 13.1% in the non-ARC group (P = 0.0003) and 17.3% had eczema versus 5.1% in the non-ARC group (P = 0.0001). Male gender was a protection factor for ARC (OR= 0.42 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72). Boys with positive SPT to the mite Blomia tropicalis had OR= 5.1 (95% CI 1.43 to 18.24) for ARC.

This finding is consistent with recent studies showing improvement in NHR in AR with MP-AzeFlu vs PBO and reinforces MP-AzeFlu as preferred therapy for patients with AR and nonallergic triggers.Method: Patients aged between 6-16 years who were admitted to Bagc\u0131lar Training and Research Hospital Pediatric Ophthalmology outpatient clinic and were diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis were included in the study. The children in the same age range who were admitted to the healthy child outpatient clinic of our hospital and had no symptoms of an allergic disease were included in the control group. The complete blood count parameters and osteopontin levels of the patients were studied.Conclusion:We think there is a need for larger scale studies including patients with chronic and severe symptoms in which clinical symptoms and more parameters are evaluated to clarify the pathophysiological role of OPN in allergic conjunctival diseases.Background: Bet v 1a represents the most typical allergen prototype. Its isoform Bet v 1d, however, is a hypoallergen despite of being structurally homologous. We hypothesized that the ligandbinding capacity of these lipocalin-like molecules could discriminate their level of allergenicity. We investigated thus whether the active vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) can bind to both isoforms, and how this affects their allergenicity in vitro.Method: Binding of RA was determined by in silico docking analyses and ANS assay. Sera and PBMCs from BP-allergic donors were Results: In silico calculations predicted a high affinity energy of RA to both isoforms, with an estimated dissociation constant of 0.364 \u03bcM. In vitro RA was able to dose-dependently displace ANS from both isoforms to a similar extent. In ELISA Bet v 1a loaded with RA (holo-Bet v 1a) showed significantly reduced binding of serum IgE compared to \"empty\" apo-Bet v 1a. In agreement, holo-Bet v 1a produced significantly less mediator release from RBL cells.In contrast, both apo-and holo-Bet v 1d displayed much lower IgE binding/crosslinking capacity. PBMCs from birch pollen allergic donors produced significantly less IFN-\u03b3, IL-10 and IL-13 when stimulated with holo-Bet v 1a in comparison to high Th1/Th2 levels induced by apo-Bet v 1a. Conclusion: Loading of RA into the intramolecular pocket of Bet v 1a reduces its IgE-binding and IgE-crosslinking potential together with its Th1/Th2 inducing abilities in vitro. Our data may have impli-Background: CD23 is the low affinity receptor for IgE and belongs to the C-type lectin receptor family. CD23 is mainly expressed on B cells and is known to mediate facilitated antigen presentation (FAP). FAP is initiated by the binding of IgE-antigen complexes to CD23. Those complexes are endocytosed and processed, leading to the display of antigen peptides onto MHC II molecules and subsequent activation of specific T cells. IgE-antigen complexes have been shown to trigger specific T cell activation by CD23-mediated facilitated antigen presentation at 100-10000 lower concentrations than antigen alone. The density of CD23 has been shown to correlate with IgE-antigen uptake and specific T cell activation. Our aim is to study how different IgE-Bet v 1 complexes affect CD23-mediated FAP. Method: Epstein Barr virus transformed human B cells (EBV B cells), expressing high levels of CD23 on their surface, were incubated with different concentrations and ratios of complexes consisting of chimeric Bip 1 IgE, which is specific for Bet v 1, and recombinant Bet v 1 in monomeric or oligomeric form. Primed EBV B cells were co-incubated with human Jurkat T cells expressing a specific TCR for the major peptide of Bet v 1 (142-153) and a luciferase reporter gene under the control of IL2 promotor. The release of luciferase indicated specific T cell activation. Results: Equimolar concentrations of CB1 IgE-oligomer Bet v 1 complexes induced higher specific T cell activation when compared to CB1 IgE-Bet v 1 monomer complexes. Likewise 25 to 125 fold lower concentrations of CB1 IgE-Bet v 1 oligomer complexes were sufficient to induce specific T cell activation in comparison to CB1 IgE-Bet v 1 monomer complexes. Blocking of CD23 using anti-CD23 completely inhibited specific T cell activation triggered by IgE-Bet v 1 complexes, regardless of their composition.Conclusion: IgE-Bet v 1 oligomer complexes trigger specific T cell activation more efficiently than IgE-Bet v 1 monomer complexes.The uptake of IgE-Bet v 1 complexes is solely mediated by CD23.0822 | Sensitisation to cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants obscures true atopy, but shows no evidence of protection against allergy-related disease, in urban and rural Uganda Nkurunungi G 1 ; Versteeg S 2 ; Nampijja M 1 ; Sanya RE 1 ; Mpairwe H 1 ; Webb EL 3 ; Elliott AM 1 ; van Ree R 2 ; Yazdanbakhsh M 4 MRC/UVRI Uganda Research Unit, Entebbe, Uganda; 2 Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands, The; 3 London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom; 4 Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, Netherlands, The",

The aim was to isolate human IgE monoclonal antibodies with natural pairing of heavy and light chain from patients allergic to cat for subsequent antigenic studies.Method: Hybridomas expressing human IgE were obtained from electrical cytofusion of cultured human B cells from peripheral blood of three different allergic patients and a human myeloma cell line.The relative epitope specificity of the IgE mAbs expressed by these hybridomas was assessed by performing two-site ELISA using different combinations of IgE and/or murine IgG currently used to measure Fel d 1 levels (coating mAb 6F9 and detection biotinylated-mAb 3E4).Results: Four hybridomas expressing high affinity Fel d 1-specific IgE were selected by screening with purified natural Fel d 1. The mAb IgE were 6A1 and 1B7-both from the same patient but with different sequences-, mAb 11A12 and mAb 15H7. The four mAb IgE bound to at least three different epitopes on the Fel d 1 surface.One epitope was for mAb 11A12 and the other two seemed to be in close proximity to the binding sites of the murine mAbs. ELISA results suggest that IgE mAb 6A1 overlaps with both IgG mAbs, while IgE mAbs 1B7 and 15H7, and IgG mAb 3E4 seemed to bind to an overlapping site. The area where most antibodies bound could be an immunodominant region of Fel d 1.Conclusion:Four anti-Fel d 1 human IgE monoclonal antibodies with natural pairing of heavy and light chains were isolated by human hybridoma technology.

Research Institute of Medical Problems of the North of the Federal Research Center Krasnoyarsk Scientific Center of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Krasnoyarsk, Russia Background: Mechanical jaundice of malignant genesis (MJ) is a pathological syndrome consisting of a violation of the outflow of hepatic bile through the bile ducts to the duodenum due to mechanical obstructions of malignant genesis. The prognosis of the disease depends on the severity of MJ, the level of bilirubinemia, hypoproteinemia, complications, infectious and tumor factors. An unfavorable factor is the development of local and systemic inflammation. Neutrophils (NG) are nonspecific phagocytes, the first to eliminate the infectious agents in the affected area. The purpose of this research was to study the characteristics of the chemiluminescent activity of neutrophils in MJ of malignant genesis, depending on the level of bilirubin. mined. The statistical significance of the differences was determined using the ranked Mann-Whitney test. The critical level of significance in checking statistical hypotheses was assumed to be Results: In the group of patients with MJ of malignant genesis, regardless of the level of bilirubin, the parameters of the time to the maximum of spontaneous and induced emission, the area under the spontaneous and induced luminescence curves and the activation index were increased, the intensity of spontaneous and induced luminescence was reduced in comparison with the control group. Background: Enhancing the immunogenicity of T cell vaccines without compromising their tolerability and safety is an inherent dilemma for vaccine development. The prolonged presence of antigens for effective T cell activation can be achieved by using depot adjuvants such as aluminium hydroxide. However, it is still unclear adjuvant that has been used in licensed products and subject to further clinical development in allergy immunotherapy. Combining MCT with target antigen facilitates the slow release of the antigens while MCT particles are metabolised and cleared from the body. The current project aims to study the efficacy of MCT when combined with virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccines for effective T cell responses in murine melanoma models and to compare its efficacy to the widely used aluminium hydroxide adjuvants.test their efficacy at inducing specific T cell response in vivo in murine models bearing B16F10 melanoma tumors. The kinetics of drainage of VLPs formulated with MCT adjuvants was also studied using stereomicroscopic imaging.Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IranMethods: A 13-year-old girl with history of Hodgkin lymphoma from 6 months before consultation was consulted to the allergy and clinical immunology department for tachypnea and cough.

Currently, the mechanisms of the pathogenesis of gastric cancer remain insufficiently studied. Cytokines act as regulators of the main stages of the body's vital activity. Regulation provides proliferation, differentiation and functioning of cells, as well as the direction and nature of the immune response to the introduction of pathogens of infectious and non-infectious genesis. Cytokines, interacting with complementary receptors on the cell surface, activate certain genes, the synthesis of specific proteins that regulate the above processes occurs. The role of cytokines in the tumor progression is ambiguous, despite the fact that on the one hand, they activate the immune response aimed at eliminating the tumor, on the other, they themselves contribute to the progression of the malignant process. The purpose of this research was to study the features of cytokine regulation in patients with gastric cancer in the late stages of the disease.",

The aim was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the vaccine. Secondary endpoints were: changes in immunoglobulin levels (specific IgE, IgG and IgG4), changes in cutaneous reactivity and changes in symptoms score. Patients were under study treatment for 17 weeks: five for the induction phase (weekly injections) and 12 for the maintenance phase (monthly injections).Results: 51 patients were included in 4 Spanish sites from May 2015 to March 2016. No patient was withdrawn from the study. 43 patients (84.3%) were diagnosed with persistent moderate/severe rhinitis according to ARIA guidelines and 17.6% had concomitant mild asthma. Previous immunotherapy with Parietaria judaica was reported by 9.8% of patients, in all cases ended at least 5 years before starting the present trial. Adverse reactions occurred in 36 patients and were mostly mild reactions in severity. From a total of 470 administered doses, 27.7% elicited adverse reactions: 22.9% local reactions (17.7% late and not clinically relevant) and 4.7% systemic reactions (2.3% nonspecific and 2.3% grade I systemic reactions, being rhinitis and urticaria the most reported symptoms). Concerning the efficacy parameters: cutaneous reactivity at the final visit versus baseline was significantly decreased with all tested vials; specific titers of IgG and IgG4 increased significantly and the percentage of patients with rhinitis symptoms was lower and showed a significant decrease in the rhinitis symptoms score.

Knowing the type of non-compliance and degree of adherence in our population, allows us to incorporate specific corrective measures to achieve disease control.Method: It is an observational, prospective, transversal, multicentric study in Argentina (Cordoba, Marcos Juarez, La Plata, Rosario, Parana). The TAI was performed on patients between 18 and 80 years old, diagnosed with asthma according to Gina 2016 in inhaler treatment from February to July 2017 at the Allergy Services of these cities. Variables were analysed: age, sex, type of inhaler treatment: single-dose/combined, public and/or private area, and health insurance. Results: A total of 124 patients participated. Average age were 45 years old, 59% female. 56% belong to the private sector. 88% were on combination therapy and 22% on mono drugs. The non-compliant patients were 101 (81.5%), 64 of them had poor adhesion (54.1%), 34 intermediate adhesion (27.4%) and 23 patients had good adhesion (18.5%). The types of defaults found were: Sporadic 89.11%, Deliberate 87% and Unconscious 18.5%. The private sector showed better compliance (83% p.0.05). Conclusion: It is prevalent a high rate of non-compliance (81.5%) with inhaled treatments in patients with asthma. Sporadic and Deliberate types of non-compliance were the most frequent. The private sector presented better compliance (p0.05). This study makes us rethink new strategies to improve therapeutic efficacy, better adherence, education and disease control in our population.

The regular use of OCS in severe asthmatics is a frequent finding (about 61.5% in the Severe Asthma Network Italy-SANI-registry) and it is well known to be the cause of several unwanted adverse events.Method: We aimed to perform a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of OCS-related adverse events in severe asthmatics. The study con-sisted in: 1) evaluation of the existing published literature on the type and frequency of OCS-related adverse events and their direct and undirect costs; 2) attribution of an annual economic value to each individual OCS-related adverse event, according to Italian standards of care for each single diagnosis-related group (DRG).Results: The articles selected for extrapolating type and frequency of OCS-related averse events are reported inTable 1.4860.04 Euros was thee total annual cost of OCS-related adverse events in the asthmatics, corresponding to 193% (2344.32 Euros) more than subjects without asthma.Conclusion:The use of OCS in severe asthmatics has a high impact, both in terms of frequency than under a pharmacoeconomic point of view of its adverse effects. Therefore one of the most relevant unmet need in severe asthma is the reduction (possibly with novel biologic agents) of regular use of oral corticosteroids. References: 1. Lefebvre et al.

Then, all patients were analyzed for specific IgE to the ragweed and Alternaria alternate through ImmunoCap.Results: All patients had sensibilization to ragweed. 36% of the patients had sensibilization to Aletrnaria alternata. Sensibilization to Alternaria alternate in children was higher than in adults: 61% in patients ages 5-10; 44% in patients ages 11-20. There was a trend for decreased sensibilization with age: 43% in patients ages 2130; 9% in patients ages 31-40; no sensibilization in patients ages 41-50.Conclusion:In this study, we demonstrated that a third of patients in Kyiv region with SAR and sensibilization to ragweed had sensitization to Alternaria alternate. Given the overlapping pollination seasons of Alternaria and ragweed, physicians should consider testing for sensibilization to Alternaria in patients with SAR and sensibilization to ragweed. According to our findings, this is especially relevant in younger patients (20 years and under), who showed higher levels of sensibilization to Alternaria.1028 | Role of humic substances in the hygiene hypothesis for autoimmune and allergic diseasesZhernov Y; Durnev S REAVIZ Medical University, Moscow, Russia",

However, there are only few studies evaluating the correlation of skin test responses among indoor allergens in these children. Objective: To evaluate the concordance of skin test response between the pairs of indoor allergens among children with respiratory allergic diseases. Method: This study was a retrospective medical chart review of children aged 2 to 18 years old who presented with symptoms of allergic rhinitis and/or asthma at the Pediatric Allergy Clinic of Thammasat Hospital, Pathumthani, Thailand. The skin prick test results of mites (Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus), cockroaches (Periplaneta Americana, Blatella germanica), cat and dog were collected. The sensitization was defined as\u22653 millimeters in wheal diameter. The kappa coefficient (k) was used to analyze the concordance of sensitization for each pair of allergens. Results: A total chart of 300 children were reviewed, of which 187 (62.3%) were male. The mean age was 7.4 \u00b1 3.3 years. 216 (72%) children were diagnosed as allergic rhinitis alone, 13 (4.3%) children as asthma alone, and 71 (23.7%) as both allergic rhinitis and asthma. There were 183 (61%), 140 (46.7%), 45 (15%), 30 (10%) of 300 children who were sensitized to mites, cockroaches, cat and dog, respectively. 126 children had co-sensitization to mites and cockroaches. The concordance of sensitization between mites and cockroaches was moderate agreement, k = 0.53. There were 18/45 (40%) children with cat sensitization had co-sensitization to dog while 18/ 30 (60%) children with dog sensitization had co-sensitization to cat, k = 0.41. Mite-sensitized children had poor concordance of sensitization to cat and dog, k = 0.1, 0.06, respectively. Also, there were poor concordance between cockroach-sensitized children to both cat and dog sensitization, k = 0.19 and 0.08, respectively.Conclusion: This study showed moderate agreement of skin test response between dust mite and cockroach, dog and cat. This could be due to cross-reactivity or parallel sensitization. Component resolving diagnosis should be considered in children with co-sensitization of these pairs of allergen. 1034 | Metabolomics: A new tool to characterize epithelial barrier damage Rodriguez-Coira J 1 ; Judel I 1 ; Villase\u00f1or A 1 ; L\u00f3pez-Rodr\u00edguez JC 2 ; Bened\u00e9 S 2 ; Barbas C 3 ; Barber D 1 ; Escribese MM 1 ; Batanero E 2 IMMA, Institute of Applied Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, CEU San Pablo University, Madrid, Spain; 2 Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Faculty of Chemistry, Complutense University, Madrid, Spain; 3 CEMBIO, Centre for Metabolomics and Bioanalysis, Faculty of Pharmacy, CEU San Pablo University, Madrid, Spain",

Method: We examined Spanish patients adults and children with food allergy symptoms and/or seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma. Foods triggering allergic symptoms were acquired by questionnaire. Patients included were classified into three groups: mild, severe and no reactors based on clinical history. IgE to Results: We identified different profiles linked to panallergens IgE sensitization: 1-mono-panallergens FA: sensitization to either profilin or nsLTP, or PR-10. 2-cosensitization to two panallergens: profilin and nsLTP, or profilin and PR-10. 3-cosensitization to three panallergens (multipanallergens FA): profilin, nsLTP and PR-10. The most frequent was profilin monopanallergen profile: PH >80%, CoH >70%, CH >60%. The group of patients with severe reactions to foods (oral allergy syndrome plus systemic symptoms, or uvula edema, or life threatening reactions) were most frequent in CoH (40%). Relevant differences were observed in this group, the most important profile was monopanallergens: profilin (>50% CoH, >70%PH and >30% CH), nsLTP was less important, and PR-10 was infrequent. The second profile, cosensitization to two panallergens: pro-filin+nsLTP was observed in CoH and CH (<20%) while the third one, multipanallergen FA only was found in PH.Conclusion: Patients in Caceres province present a phenotype of food allergy profilin mediated.. Monopanallergen FA profile reported severe reactions more frequently, but differences were observed, while profilin was more important in PH and CoH, both located in north of the province, in CH (located in the south) profilin and also LTP were observed.

Sera were tested for specific IgE to 112 molecules of allergens by using microchip (ISAC, Thermo Fisher Scientific).Results: ISAC results showed that patients with respiratory allergy have a wide profile of allergen-specific IgE sensitization, as their reaction to 51 out of 112 components was positive. Clinically significant sensitization to one pollen component was detected in 4.7% of the patients; to two allergens-in 16.6%, to three-in 14.3%. Positive values of polysensitization to 5-10 components were detected in 33% of the patients. More than 28% of the patients had a positive response to 11-17 components. The maximum number of detected allergenic molecules amounted to 17. Conclusion: Molecular diagnostics of allergy is viable both for identifying the genuine sensitization and for the correct selection of SIT (specific immunotherapy) and efficiency forecast thereof. Identifying the cross-reactions to allergens of the same protein family predetermines the launch of development of sensitization to an additional source.

The allergen-specific IgE to feline and Results: 30% of patients were monosensitized to only one canine or feline allergen component. The main feline allergen was Fel d 1, which sensitized as many as 93.9% of patients sensitized to felines. Among 65 patients sensitized to at least one feline component, for 30 patients (46.2%) the only sensitizing feline component was Fel d 1. Only 19 patients in that group (63.3%) were not simultaneously sensitized to dogs.

The underlying cause is not known. Antihistamines are the most effective symptomatic treatment option to control the disease. Symptomatic dermographism may be related to autoimmunity in many cases. Our aims were to assess the clinical characteris-tics and the presence of autoimmunity in patients with dermographic urticaria. Method: This was a retrospective study of electronic medical records of patients with DU, attended at a tertiary hospital. Time of disease, association with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), type of treatment, and frequency of autoimmune disease and/or autoantibodies were assessed. Results: We assessed 97 patients with DU in a follow-up period of more than 6 months. Eighty-one patients (83.5%) were female, with a mean age of 46.8 years and a time of disease of 8.5 years. The association with CSU was observed in 22.7% of the patients, autoantibodies was observed in 36.5% of them, and the autoimmune disease was present in 12 patients (12.4%) of the patients. In regard to the association DU and CSU (22 patients), autoimmunity was observed in 3 patients (13.6%), and autoantibodies, in 8 (36.4%) of them. The majority of the patients had good response to antihistamine (AH): 74.2% of them responded to second generation AH alone, and 51% of the patients needed first generation AH added or not to the second generation AH. Some patients (6%) had used prolonged oral corticosteroids therapy to control their symptoms, previously.Conclusion: DU was associated with CSU in almost a quarter of the patients. The prevalence of autoimmunity and/or autoantibodies was high, regardless of the association between DU and CSU.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) and/or anti-thyroid autoantibodies patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria during a period of 17 years.Method: Retrospective study of the electronic medical record of adults patients with CSU followed up in an Urticaria Outpatient Clinic at a tertiary center in the Clinical Immunology and Allergy Division, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, between 2000 and 2017. Patients were assessed for the presence of ATD or autoantibodies concomitant to CSU and if CSU diagnosis preceded or followed the ATD diagnosis. Results: This study assessed 988 patients with CSU. ATD and/or anti-thyroid autoantibodies were present in 101 patients (10.2%). Of these, 89.1% were female, the mean age was 53 years and the mean time of CSU was 13 years. Of the 101 patients, 48 (47.5%) had ATDs, the most prevalent being hypothyroidism. Anti-thyroid autoantibodies without ATD were present in 53 patients (52.4%). CSU preceded (mean time of 7.3 years) the diagnosis of ATD in 19 patients (39.5%) and CSU developed after ATD diagnosis (mean time of 3.7 years) in 18 patients (37.5%). CSU concomitant to ATD was diagnosed in 11 patients (22.9%).Conclusion: The link between CSU and ATD isn't yet fully understood, however, several studies showed a high prevalence of this association. In this study, the association between CSU and ATD and/or autoantibodies was observed in 10.2% of the patients over a 17-year period.Correction added on 31 October 2018, after first online publication: the author sequence has been changed.

Very rarely, initial signs include skin manifestations. Our purpose is to highlight cutaneous manifestations in the diagnosis and assessment of atypical gastric carcinoid tumor. Case presentation: 66 year old male patient had chronic urticaria and angioedema for 1 year. There was no typical triggering factor. His urticaria activity score (UAS) 7 was calculated as 28. Laboratory findings showed anemia, diminished iron, ferritin, and vitamin B12, with increased serum gastrin and anti-gastric parietal cell antibody (anti-GPC: 1/40 titer positive) levels. Gastric endoscopy showed submucosal lesions with the diameter of 5 mm, and 3 nodular areas similar to neuroendocrine tumor in gastric corpus. Gastric biopsy was positive with synaptophysin, chromogranin and CD56. Ki67 index was found 0% which was confirmed with grade 1 neuroendocrine tumor. Serum gastrin level [575 pg/mL (13-115)] and chromogranin A level [225.9 mg/mL (<94)] were elevated. Serum autoantibodies, total and specific IgE levels were detected in normal ranges. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT), oncologic FDG PET-CT and gallium 68 PET-CT scan did not show any other neuroendocrine tumor (NET) lesions except gastric NET. His urticaria lesions were nonresponsive to maximal doses of antihistaminic tablets and steroiddependant. Therefore, omalizumab therapy was prescribed. After the third dosage of omalizumab, his urticaria has been faded away. His NET has been following by endocrinology department every six months as far as the patient has no other symptoms except urticaria. Conclusion: In literature, limited number of urticaria and angioedema cases have been reported as the only presenting symptom of carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumors with upper gastrointestinal localisations secrete histamines, that is why we expect these cases would respond to oral H1-antagonist tablets. Interestingly, our patient was non-responsive to antihistamines. In conclusion, physicians should consider the possibility of existence of neuroendocrine malignancies, specifically gastric carcinoids when evaluating patients presenting with chronic urticaria, iron deficiency anemia, elevated anti-parietal cell antibody and serum gastrin levels. Consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.

Despite progress, our knowledge regarding the mechanism of action of omalizumab is incomplete. To date only a few patients with csu developing resistance to omalizumab have been reported. We present a patient with severe csu and initial response to omalizumab, who developed resistance to treatment but subsequently showed an excellent response to a trial of re-treatment.Method:A 46 year old patient presented with a 5 year history of csu with angioedema and delayed pressure urticaria. Previous treatments consisted of desloratadine 20 mg/d, fexofenadine 540 mg/d, ebastine 40 mg/d rupatadine 40 mg/d, dapsone 50 mg/d and even high dose desloratadine combined with montelukast 10 mg/d which all had no effect.

It is characteristically recurs in the same locations upon reexposure to the culprit drug. FDE is rare condition of drug related skin eruptions. Acute FDE usually presents with a single or a small number of dark red or violaceous plaques that resolve leaving hyperpigmentation. Diagnosis is made based on patient's history. The medication history should be taken in great detail and include all types of medications and routes of administration, since patients may overlook medication. In this case report we present a pastille related FDE. 41 years old man attended to our outpatient clinic complaint with red-brown skin eruptions.In May 2017 he took ibuprofen+pseudoephedrine pills and ibuprofen pastilles because of cold. One day later red pruritic 3-4 cm diameter round eruptions raised his right dorsal hand and two eruptions on his right side of lumbar area. Desquamation in oral mucosa, hyperemia and pruritus in his eyes accompanied with this symptoms.One month later second and third reactions appeared on the same area and same form, but he said that he didn't take ibuprofen+ pseudoephedrine pills. Then the fourth reaction more generalized and recovered leave scars. In his detailed history he took ibuprofen pastilles for sore throat in all reactions. His routine laboratory blood tests were in normal limit, total IgE level was 504 IU/L.Results: Fixed eruption due to paracetamol.Conclusion: Paracetamol may be the reason of skin lesions.

Systemic infection was ruled out and diagnosis of DRESS syndrome according to RegiSCAR criteria was established.Conclusion: DRESS syndrome is a delayed type of drug hypersensitivity that should be ruled out in patients who present with fever and exanthema, in the context of a recent drug introduction. Itsdiagnosis requires a high level of clinical suspicion and a systematic evaluation to rule out systemic symptoms in patients with cutaneous adverse reactions. We report the 5th case of DRESS syndrome due to therapy with Vemurafenib. This case suggests the possibility of using dabrafenib as an alternative in patients with a previous severe drug reaction induced by vemurafenib.

However, there is controversy as to whether PA reduces the risk of allergic diseases, especially atopic dermatitis (AD). So we investigated the relationship between PA and AD in Korean adolescents. Method: We used data obtained from the 2016 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBWS-VII) of 65 628 adolescents. We defined regular PA according to Guidelines for physical activity for Koreans. Multivariate regression analysis was adjusted by social, physical and behavior variables, using a complex sampling design. After adjusting for factors, regular PA was significantly related to AD in Korean male adolescents (adjusted odd ratio 1.130, 1.003-1.274, P = 0.045). But female adolescents didn't relate to regular PA, aerobic PA and strengthening exercise.Conclusion: This study provided evidence that regular PA is related to development of AD in Korean male adolescents. Further research is needed to identify why sufficient PA could be a risk factor of AD in male adolescents.",

EB simple form is caused by mutations in the genes KRT5 and KRT14. EB dystrophic typeby mutations in the gene COL7A1 coding for type 7 collagen, which is responsible for the stability of the structure of connective tissue fibers of the skin and other organs. Itching is a dramatic symptom of BE lesions. Aim: To study the profile and frequency of IgE sensitization in children suffering from different forms of EB. Method: We studied 67 children with EB, 18 patients with simple EB, 49 patientswith dystrophic EB. We used a panel of more than 170 micro-arrayed allergens and ImmunoCAP (food allergens extracts+mixture of house dust mite) to assess IgE sensitization Results: There was a statistically significant more frequent IgE sensitization in children with dystrophic EB. Among them 28.6% showed IgE reactivity to \u22651 allergen, 40.8% had a positive history indicative of IgE sensitization, 24.5%had both IgE and clinical results. Among patients with simple EB, 16.7% showed IgE reactivity to \u22651 allergen, 27.8%a positive clinical history, 11.1%were double-positive (sIgE+history). According to the chip data the sensitization to ragweed, mugwort, birch, Alternaria, latex, peanuts, walnut, cow's milk, egg white, apple, peach, kiwi, house dust mite, dog, cat, and venom were most frequently encountered in children with dystrophic EB. Patients with a simple EB were sensitized only to house dust mite, cow's milk and egg white allergens. ImmunoCAP technology showed that IgE-reactivities to allergen extracts of soy, meat, fish, cereals, fruits were detected significantly more often in children with dystrophic EB, whereas patients with the simple EB had antibodies only to banana extracts Conclusion: Patients with EB due to mutations in collagen type 7 show markedly higher IgE sensitizations to allergens than EB patients ABSTRACTS | 729with mutations in keratin genes which may be due to a defect in barrier function.1442 | Mapping of disease severity in patients with sclerodermaFrey KM 1 ; Lauffer F 1 ; Garzorz-Stark N 1 ; Eyerich S 2 ; Eyerich K 2 Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; 2 ZAUM-Center of Allergy and Environment, Technical University of Munich and Helmholtz Center Munich, Member of the German Center for Lung Research (DZL), Munich, Germany",

Combinations of immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids and anti-histamines are usually employed to inhibit the activation of lymphocytes and mast cells. However, these agents can induce severe adverse effects and may not show sufficient efficacy. Therefore, new strategies are needed to develop novel effective therapies for allergic disease. From this perspective, intracellular calcium signaling through the ORAI1 ion channel, which plays an important role in both T cell activation and mast cell degranulation, provides a very promising target for future drug development.Spirodela polyrhiza (L.)

After this model and allergist assessment, 37 cases of anaphylaxis deaths (out of 122 total deaths from INTCF) were selected and added to the Hospital series. In the Spanish Hospital System, 115 cases of fatal anaphylaxis were detected. The three most frequent causes were: drugs (46.55%), unknown causes (39.66%) and foods (30.56%);while for the INTCF were: drugs (47.22%), insect bites (30.56%) and foods (11.11%). The incidence of anaphylaxis deaths in Spain using both databases was 0.25 (CI 95%, 0.24-0.26) deaths per million personyears. Risk of death from anaphylaxis increased 1.25-1.30-fold for each 5-year period of age, while risk for food anaphylaxis remained stable. Fatal anaphylaxis was more frequent in males than females both for the total group and for the drug anaphylaxis group.Conclusion: Estimated fatal anaphylaxis percentage in Spain was in the lowest range limit of incidence published up to date. No increase of anaphylaxis deaths was observed in Spain during the studied period.1466 | Growing problem, a case report: Lifethreatening anaphylaxis to gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists in central precocious puberty Igde M 1 ; Kara C 2 Samsun Education and research hospital, Samsun, Turkey; 2 medical park hospital, Istanbul, Turkey",

Department of Internal Medicine. Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain Background: Carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem) are broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, typically used as second-line treatment for severe polymicrobial and resistant bacterial infections in hospitals. Also, it is an alternative treatment for those patients with penicillin or cephalosporin hypersensitivity, as cross-reactivity is very low (<1%). Type I hypersensitivity reactions have been described for imipenem, but until now only delayed non-IgEmediated hypersensitivity reactions have been described for ertapenem and meropenem. Case: A 47-year-old male, with antecedents of Marfan syndrome with aortic mechanic valve, hypertension, hypothyroidism, type A aortic dissection with D3 sensitive-motor spinal cord injury, auricular flutter and urinal tract colonization of multiresistant bacteria, was hospitalized in September 2016 due to fever of a suspected abdominal focus, initiating parenteral treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam. Afterwards, he presented urinal sepsis, subsequently changing the antibiotic therapy to meropenem according to antibiogram. Within minutes after starting the first dose of meropenem, the patient experimented generalized pruritus, wheezing, dyspnea, erythroderma and hypotension. Intramuscular adrenaline, antihistamine, corticosteroids, and even vasoactive support with noradrenaline infusion was necessary to revert the symptoms. Serum tryptase during the reaction reached a peak of 62 \u03bcg/L, being the baseline value of 4.75 \u03bcg/L. Skin prick test (10 mg/mL) was positive to Meropenem. Skin tests were negative for imipenem (prick 50 mg/mL, intradermal 3 mg/mL), ertapenem (prick 100 mg/mL, intradermal 10 mg/mL), amoxicillin (prick 200 mg/mL, intradermal 20 mg/mL), penicillin G (10.000 UM/mL) and cefuroxime (prick 200 mg/mL, intradermal 20 mg/mL). A controlled parenteral challenge was performed with ertapenem (conditioned by the antibiogram results) assessing correct tolerance. The patient was diagnosed as selective IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to meropenem, and strict avoidance was recommended. Discussion: We present the first reported case of IgE-mediated anaphylactic shock to meropenem. Absence of cross-reactivity with ertapenem was confirmed. 1471 | Anaphylaxis during supraventricular tachycardia therapy Almero R; L\u00f3pez-Salgueiro R; Toran Barona C; Hernandez Fernandez De Rojas D Department of Allergy, Hospital Universitari i Polit\u00e8cnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain Background: Amiodarone has been effective in the treatment of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, and atrial fibrillation. Multiple side effects related to amiodarone (approximately 75% of the patients after 5 years of treatment) have been reported, involving gastrointestinal and neurological system, skin, liver and thyroid gland. Anaphylactic reactions during intravenous administration are unfrequent and only few cases are described in the literature. Method: A 66 year-old hypothyroid female patient treated with levothyroxine and without previously known allergies suffered acute chest pain and fatigue. Electrocardiogram performed at the emergency department showed supraventricular tachycardia. Patient was monitored and treated with sublingual nitroglycerin and intravenous amiodarone perfusion. Immediately, the patient presented cutaneous erythema, upper lip edema, desaturation (88%), swallowing difficulty, respiratory distress, hypotension and cyanosis. After intubation, he was treated with adrenaline and intravenous antihistamines and corticosteroids and transferred to the intensive care unit, where he was treated with ABSTRACTS | 741 flecainide, recovering sinus rhythm. Serum tryptase was measured 6 hours after the onset of the episode.Results: Serum tryptase level reached 5.4 \u03bcg/L, anaphylaxis, while baseline tryptase was 2.3\u03bcg/L. Total serum IgE was normal (15.30 kU/L).The patient was submitted for allergy evaluation, but refused any direct test with amiodarone. Basophil activation test (BAT) performed with amiodarone was positive (C 1 16.67%, SI 1 : 5.63 C 2 : 57.14% IE 2 : 19.30). Baseline SI was 2.96%.Skin tests with latex, muscle relaxants and anesthetics used during intubation showed negative results.

It is widely used as excipient in pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations because of their stabilizing properties (NSAIDs, antihistamines, evacuant solution\u2026). Different types of PEG exist according to their molecular weight, ranging from 300 g/mol to 10 000 000 g/mol. Several cases of delayed hypersensitivity reactions induced by PEG have been described, but immediate hypersensitivity reactions are rare. Cross reactivity with polysorbate 80 -a macrogol derivative-has been reported.First case: A 9 years old child presented a generalized urticaria twenty minutes after receiving an evacuant solution containing PEG 4000. He had previously tolerated two doses. The reaction resolved spontaneously.Second case: A 29 years old male began with pruritus, generalized rash, chest tightness and dyspnea without cough or wheezing fifteen minutes after an antacid intake (calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, alginate, parahydroxybenzoate, PEG 20000, acesulfame-K). The patient was treated with adrenaline and hydrocortisone.We performed skin prick test (SPT) with involved drugs and components separately, SPT with polysorbate 80, PEG 4000 and PEG 20000 in atopic and five non atopic controls.

It is a chemotherapeutic agent which has been used in the treatment of a numerous malignant conditions. Intravenous etoposide is generally well tolerated. It is reported to induce hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) in 6% of the patients; however, its incidence of anaphylaxis is 0.7% .We report a 2.5-year-old male patient diagnosed with retinoblastoma in our pediatric oncology clinic and had a hypersensitivity reaction with etoposide. He received his first etoposide infusion without premedication. Twenty-one days after the first dose of the drug, the second etoposide dose was started again without premedication.The patient experienced generalized urticaria, angioedema on the eyelids and lips, cyanosis on the lips and shortness of breath after 10 minutes of etoposide infusion. He was found to be hypotensive (blood pressure=60/30 mm Hg) and desaturated to 80% on pulse oximetry. The infusion was interrupted immediately and 0.01 mg/kg intramuscular adrenaline, 1 mg/kg hydroxyzine and 1 mg/kg prednisolone treatment were given to the patient. Then, the patient was referred to our allergy clinic to be evaluated. The skin tests were performed to demonstrate the hypersensitivity of the patient. Skin prick test (20 mg/mL) and intradermal test (2 mg/mL) results with drug were negative. Etoposide is considered to be a critical component of an effective treatment of retinoblastoma. Thus, in this case continued use of etoposide was warranted. We decided to apply desensitization. The etoposide phosphate preparation without polysorbate 80 could not be used because it was not available.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature to describe a successful desensitization protocol with etoposide in the preschool age group.Coskun R; T\u00fczer \u00d6C; Paksoy N; Ince B; Beyaz S; Gelincik A; \u00c7olakoglu B; B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00f6zt\u00fcrk S Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Division of Immunology and Allergic Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey Background: Albendazole is the only medication used for the treatment of hydatid cysts in combination with surgery or alone.

Here we present the first late anaphylaxis due to albendazole in an adult patient with hepatic hydatid cysts who was successfully desensitized.Case: A 44 year-old man using albendazole because of hepatic hydatid cysts has been referred to us because of a systemic hypersensitivity reaction. On the 10th day of treatment of 800 mg daily albendazole, generalized urticaria developed after 3 hours of oral intake and therefore was stopped. One week later it was started again in the same dosage. Few hours later, shortness of breath, urticaria and abdominal pain occurred. Since there is no effective alternative medication, desensitization was planned. Cetirizine 10 mg 2 \u00d7 1 premedication was given regularly starting from the first day before desensitization.

Treatment is symptomatic using steroids and immunomodulatory agents. Adalimumab is a potentially effective treatment for BD in patients who are refractory to conventional therapies. Injection site reactions are the most common adverse effects associated with adalimumab, but anaphylaxis is rare.Methods: We report a case of a 19-year-old woman, with BD, several aneurysms and personal history of atopic disease (rhinitis and seafood allergy), that was referred to our unit after one episode of anaphylaxis (facial angioedema, generalized urticarial lesions and dyspnea) 1 hour after infusion of adalimumab. She has been treated with adalimumab since 2016, after she had developed tuberculosis with infliximab treatment. Her allergic reaction occurred in August 2017. We evaluated the patient 8 weeks after the initial reaction using the European Network for Drug Allergy (ENDA) questionnaire and skin tests with immediate readings (15 minutes). Skin prick test (SPT) to adalimumab was performed at full-strength concentration (50 mg/mL) with histamine as positive control and normal saline as negative control. Intradermal skin test (IDT) was performed with 1:1000 concentration. Given the initial therapeutic success with adalimumab and the failed response to standard treatments, we suggested restart adalimumab therapy using a desensitization protocol.",

Premedication consisted of montelukast 10 mg, ranitidine 150 mg and hydroxyzine 25 mg 1 hour before administration of adalimumab.Desensitization protocol started with an initial subcutaneous dose of 0.005 mg, which was gradually increased to a cumulative dose of 40.055 mg, with 15-minute intervals between 9 doses. During the procedure, she only experienced hypertension controlled with captopril. She is currently receiving a full-strength, single dose of 40 mg adalimumab every 2 weeks, with no premedication and good tolerance.Conclusion: Desensitization for adalimumab induced anaphylaxisshould be considered in patients with BD when alternative treatments are considered inferior and/or more toxic.1489 | Desensitisation or treating through the reaction? Clinical caseCortellini G; Mascella F; Simoncelli M; Lippolis D; Santucci A; Cortellini F; Ballardini G Rimini Hospital, Rimini, Italy Case report: In clinical practice there is a need for desensitization in drug hypersensitivity. In several patients the allergic clinical picture is mild; therefore a possible alternative in the case of drug hypersensitivity is treating through, helping the tolerance induction to the drug. Clinical case: 87 year woman. The patient has a left femur fracture in 2011, complicated by an osteomielitic inflammation which caused one cutaneous fistula. Afterwards, the surgeon choose not to perform a radical clearing, maintaining the intramedullary prothesis.Colture of the deep tissue: positive for E. Coli and Proteus, sensitive to cephalosporins, quinolones.The first antibiotic therapy with cefepime was suspended for skin rash. It was then established indication to a chronic treatment with quinolones after desensitization, for the presence of allergy to levofloxacin (urticaria). The patient initiated treatment with ciprofloxacin with a slow challenge procedure, with a starting dose of 50 mg which was however hindered by the onset of diffuse prurigo and urticaria. The clinical choice in this mild clinical situation, with a mandatory necessity of therapy, was to treat the symptoms with antihistamine and steroid drugs. The therapy with ciprofloxacin started from 50 milligrams and ended with 750 milligrams. The antihistamine drug was then continued for years in the domicile. The last admission was motivated by: fracture of the atlas. Ciprofloxacin was suspended at the entrance in the hospital. Uncontrolled symptoms of prurigo came back after reassumption of full dose ciprofloxacin. This event suggested a new loss of immunological or metabolical tolerance. The patient was then subjected to a new slow challenge with the drug, from 50 mg to 500 mg in 4 weeks with an antihistamine drug coverage. This case is an induction of immunological or metabolic tolerance given by the two associated mechanisms of drug suppressive therapy and drug increase in scalar doses, even in the presence of symptoms. The tolerance mechanism type is still not clear, nor the possible underlying immunological mechanism. However, the loss of immunological or metabolic tolerance is clearly demonstrated. There are many clinical situations in which this clinical urgency occur: the purpose of the appropriate and non-substitutable therapy in a particular disease is only to arrive at the therapeutic result. Both the pharmacological attempts and the desensitization procedures must work together for this result.

For this reason rituximab and cyclophosphamide therapy was planned. During rituximab infusion she developed urticaria and bronchospasm. Adrenalin, antihistamine and corticosteroid were performed for anaphylaxis. She was consulted to our department for drug allergy.Rituximab was necessary for this patient's therapy so we decided to apply systematic desensitization for rituximab without performing skin prick tests because the reaction was anaphylaxis. Total dose was calculated 230 mg, for the patient with a 14.5 kg weight according to 375 mg/m\u00b2 daily dose of rituximab. A(1/1000 dilution), B(1/100 dilution) and C(1/10) dilution) solutions including 3 dilutions were prepared. Desensitization was applied with a 1/10 000 beginning dose as 13 steps by increasing doses every 20 minutes at the beginning and every 30 minutes afterwards and lasted 7 hours.There wasn't any reactions during desensitization. According to treatment protocol rituximab had to be performed per week for 4 weeks. The second dose was also applied with desensitization because the half life of the drug can be as low as 60 hours. After the second dose half life increased to 5-70 days so 3. and 4. doses were performed at the clinic with monitorization without any reaction.In conclusion, we present a rare case with rituximab allergy and a new protocol of rituximab desensitization.1493 | Aseptic meningitis following intravenous immunoglobulin infusion and subsequent tolerance of an alternative productSmith A 1 ; Pucar P 1 ; Davies N 2 Flinders Medical Centre, Bedford Park, Australia; 2 Australian Red Cross Blood Service, Adelaide, Australia Background: A 56 year old man with SJS induced progressive cicatrising conjunctival inflammation had failed efforts to control it with several immunomodulatory medications. Intravenous immunoglobulin (4 weekly at 2 g/kg) was suggested. Method: Following the first infusion of Flebogamma 10% he developed aseptic meningitis requiring hospital admission.Results: His medical history was revisited and subsequently the patient agreed to receive Intragam 10 at a slower rate. There was no adverse outcome from this. The administration rate has since been aligned with the standard rate.Conclusion: Current literature is limited on how to approach this problem and changing the IVIG product or rate is not thought to be helpful. However, this case demonstrates that exceptions to this advice do exist.",

Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is a DNA receptor of innate immune system which plays a pivotal role in fibrosis and inflammatory response. However, the expression, mechanism of action, and pathogenic role of TLR9 signaling in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) remain uncharacterized. The aim of this study is to explore the expression, activity and potential pathogenic role of TLR9 signaling in the tissue remodeling in Nasal polyp derived fibroblast (NPDF).Method: Expression of TLR9 were evaluated in NPDFs. NPDF were stimulated with different TLR9 agonist (CpG A and B) and assayed for the fibrotic response. Fibrotic and inflammatory responses elicited by type A CpG oligonucleotide were examined in NPDF by a combination of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence staining.Results:The mRNA expression level of TLR9 increased in NPDF compared to negative control. Type A CpG induced the protein level expression of \u03b1-SMA, fibronectin, and MMPs. Type A CpG also promoted the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon. By using specific inhibitors, we found that type A CpG induced expressions of \u03b1-SMA, fibronectin, MMPs and secretion of inflammatory cytokines were regulated by various signaling pathways.Conclusion: Our date indicated that type A CpG triggers immune response via TLR 9 and activates various signaling pathway, which is involved in remodeling of nasal polyps. Disrupting this process with inhibitor targeting TLR9 or its downstream signaling pathways might represented a novel approach to CRSwNP therapy.1507 | Digoxin inhibits nasal inflammation in an animal model of allergic rhinitisLi G 1 ; Zhao H 2 ; Zhu D 1 ; Sun Q 1 Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China; Department of Neurosurgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China",

She had positive prick test for wheat flour and house dust mites, positive omega-5 gliadin specific IgE, negative specific IgE for antibiotics. Provocation test alone for wheat and antibiotics was negative. Only a combination of food, exercise and antibiotics induced anaphylactic episodes. Conclusion: Even the diagnosis is mainly clinical in FDEIA, provocation test is an important tool for diagnosis, avoidance and finding cofactors. Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland Case report: Food dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) is a clinical syndrome characterized by sequential food intake and physical exertion. The pathomechanisms of FDEIA remain largely unknown. A reliable gold standard procedure to diagnose FDEIA has not been established yet. Thus, the diagnosis of FDEIA can be challenging, especially when traditional diagnostic work-up is not concordant with the medical history.",

Background: C1-INH-HAE is a rare, potentially life-threatening disease characterized by episodes of subcutaneous and/or submucosal swelling. APeX-1 was a Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the prevention of attacks with BCX7353, a once daily oral kallikrein inhibitor, in patients with C1-INH-HAE.Method: Patients with C1-INH-HAE with a history of at least 2 HAE attacks per month were randomized to receive four different doses of BCX7353 (350 mg, 250 mg, 125 mg, 62.5 mg) or placebo for 28 days. Blood samples for BCX7353 concentrations and kallikrein inhibition were obtained from patients before dosing and for 24 hours post-dose on Day 14. PK analyses and PK-PD modeling were done in Phoenix WinNonlin v 8.0 and SAS v 9.3.",

There was a greater than dose proportional increase in exposure (AUC tau and C max ) over the 62.5-mg to 350-mg dose range, with an approximate 14-fold increase in exposure with a 5.6-fold increase in dose. At doses \u2265125 mg, which showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in HAE attack rates, geometric mean plasma trough concentrations (C tau ) were maintained at or above the minimum target concentration (4-fold EC 50 ) estimated to be required for adequate plasma kallikrein inhibition.

A 125-mg dose provided a mean C tau of slightly above 4.0fold EC 50 , with a corresponding reduction in HAE attack rate of 69% (P < 0.001) compared with placebo. Consistent with the exposure data, a dose dependent inhibition of kallikrein was observed with BCX7353 treatment over the dose range.

Concentrations of BCX7353 at doses \u2265125 mg were maintained at or above a C tau of 4-fold the kallikrein inhibition EC 50 in most patients, and kallikrein inhibition was highly correlated with BCX7353 plasma concentrations.Background: C1-INH-HAE is a rare, life-threatening disease characterized by recurrent episodes of subcutaneous and/or submucosal swelling that lead to considerable morbidity and a poor quality of life (QoL). APeX-1 was a Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the prevention of attacks with BCX7353, a once daily oral kallikrein inhibitor, in patients with C1-INH-HAE.Method: Patients with C1-INH-HAE with at least 2 HAE attacks per month were randomized to four different BCX7353 doses (350 mg, 250 mg, 125 mg, 62.5 mg) or placebo. Subject-reported QoL assessments were conducted at the start and end of treatment using the disease specific angioedema quality of life (AE-QoL) questionnaire that measures 4 domains (function, fatigue, nutrition, fear/ shame) and has minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 6 points. The changes from baseline in total and domain scores was compared between the treatment and placebo groups. Modified angioedema activity score (AAS) values across 4 domains (daily activities, appearance, physical discomfort, overall severity) were calculated for each attack and a total score was derived for each subject by summing scores from each attack. Total scores were compared to placebo using an ANCOVA model with adjustment for qualifying attack rate. Reduction of attacks was statistically significant for all 3 top doses and there was a dose related increase in adverse events.Results: In the 125 mg dose group, QoL assessed by AE-QoL was significantly improved after 4 weeks of treatment compared to placebo for AE-QoL total score (-26.0, P < 0.001) as well as across all 4 domains (function: -28.2, P = 0.002; fatigue: -12.7, P = 0.05; fears/shame: -36.5, P < 0.001; nutrition: -23.4, P = 0.012). All other treatment groups showed a trend towards improvement. QoL improved the most in the125 mg group, and 92% of subjects in the 125 mg group showed AE-QoL reduction of more than 6 points. Disease activity as assessed by the AAS was significantly reduced in the 350 mg, 250 mg and 125 mg dose groups as compared to placebo, whereas there was no significant reduction in the 62.5 mg dose group. Results: There were no marked differences in the age, sex, total IgE titer, comorbidity of bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis or the starting dose of rush OIT among the groups. All patients in the low-BMFI group achieved \u2265100% of the target dose, whereas 28.6% of the middle-BMFI group and 50% of the high-BMFI group failed to achieve the target dose (P < 0.05). Results: A total of 473 infants were diagnosed with food allergy (IgE-mediated and mixed type) at our center during the study period, 305 of these patients underwent prick test for inhalant sensitivity, and 220 (64.9% male) of these were younger than 2 years of age. Conclusion: Sensitivity to inhaled allergen were found in 14 of 292 (4.9%) patients with food allergy. Therefore, we believe that inhalant sensitivity should be evaluated in these patients. There is also a requirement for further studies to identify the influence of inhaled antigens on the disease activity of patients with allergic conditions. Method: In this study, we aimed to perform the metabolic profiling of severe profilin mediated food allergic patients looking for biomarkers that might both, predict the prognosis of the disease and understand the molecular mechanisms of inflammation underneath.",

All cases had allergic comorbid diseases including atopic dermatitis in all 3 and allergic rhinitis in 2. Skin prick tests were positive to several food allergens (cow's milk, egg protein) in 2, to dust mite in 2 and to pollens in 1. Serum total IgE levels ranged from 490 to 1039 IU/mL. Eosinophils in peripheral blood were elevated in all 3, reaching 10%-13%.

DNA extraction method (Next Generation Sequencing) with commercial kit (Microbiopassport \u00ae ) was performed on stool samples. IBS patients were divided in two groups, according a gluten free diet prescription or a low FODMAPs diet prescription for three months. Similarly, (suspected) SNAS patients (confirmed by 5% Ni sulfate in petrolatum patch test) were prescribed a low Ni diet (100 \u03bcg/kg nickel content during the first four weeks and then up to 200 \u03bcg/kg up to three months). Two LTP (Lipid Transfer Protein) sensitized patients underwent a LTP free diet.Gut dysbiosis was re-assessed after a fixed probiotic supplementation. A sex-age matched group of individuals without history of IBS, SNAS or any gastrointestinal disease was considered as control.Gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated using the visual analogue scale before and after treatment. Conclusion: Our preliminary findings suggest that probiotic implementation could be useful in patients with SNAS on a low-Ni diet to increase population diversity, which could contribute to restore the intestinal homoeostatic conditions.",
