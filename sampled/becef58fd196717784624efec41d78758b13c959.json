In addressing a particular clinical or policy problem, clinicians or policy-makers can base their decisions on the types of clinical reports that have been published, along with an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each study. RCTs are controlled clinical experiments in which patients are randomly allocated by the investigators to receive a treatment under study. If randomization is used, all participants are equally likely to be allocated to either the treatment or the control arm of the study. RCTs should be distinguished from observational studies in which investigators passively observe patients who happen to receive a treatment under study. Because the allocation of subjects to the treatment and control arms of an RCT is random, the play of chance should distribute all confounding factors equally between these two arms. Thus, the treatment and control arms of an RCT should be equivalent with respect to all confounding factors except for the treatment under study. Randomization removes selection bias, because neither the investigator nor the participant knows what the treatment allocation will be before a patient enters a study. Moreover, if an RCT is double-blind, observation bias is also removed, because preconceived notions about benefit from the treatment cannot color the reporting of symptoms by a patient or the assessment of disease activity by an investigator. When the undertaking of RCTs is deemed unlikely, meta-analyses of individual patient data, that is, of the data recorded previously on subjects enrolled in published, small RCTs may allow investigators to address issues of possible biases 2ED-01-01 Standardizing blood components would allow better monitoring of the effectiveness of transfusion D DAVENPORT University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA In routine transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) or platelet concentrates (PC), we have only a very rough idea of the dose we administer. The minimum expected hemoglobin content of RBC should be 50 g (FDA criteria). However, actual measurements have found a mean hemoglobin content of 46.6 \u00b1 11.7 g per unit, with variability between manufacturers. 25 percent of units may contain less than 34.9 g of hemoglobin while 25 percent may contain more than 56.3 g. The effect of storage senescence can magnify these differences. The resulting hematocrit increase, depending on size of recipient and age of a unit, may be 1.5 to 9 percent. Apheresis collection of RBC can help standardized unit contents, but this technology is relatively expensive and time consuming. Knowledge of actual hemoglobin content can be used to optimize red cell transfusion. One trial, using a simple formula incorporating the desired hemoglobin and estimated blood volume, showed that nearly 60 percent of transfusion orders could be met with one unit while achieving a mean target hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL. For PC transfusion, about 66 percent of transfusions achieve the targeted dose of 3-6 \u00a5 10 11 platelets in actual practice, with considerable variability between institutions. Without knowledge of the actual content of PC, determination of refractoriness and response to matched PC is problematic. Standardization and labeling of RBC and PC units for content will permit accurate dosage and quantification of transfusion practice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Are transfusion guidelines evidence-based? JP AUBUCHON Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, USA Application of the results of randomized, controlled clinical trials to similar clinical situations should increase the predictability of the outcomes of transfusions. Unfortunately, too few such trials have been conducted to investigate all the potential situations where transfusion might be applied. However, the ones that have been reported indicate that, in general, transfusion is unlikely to provide substantial benefit in many of the situations where it is routinely used. In the intensive care setting, transfusing red cells at a trigger point of 7 g/dL rather than 10 g/dL not only did not lead to increased anemic morbidity but was actually associated with a reduction in overall mortality. Subgroup analyses indicated transfusion at the higher trigger point did not decrease morbidity in patients with cardiac disease nor decrease the time until weaning from a ventilator. Following cardiac surgery, a transfusion trigger of a hematocrit of 25% yielded the same outcomes as one of 32%. An observational study suggested that patients with peripheral vascular disease and a post-operative hematocrit below 28% were more likely to suffer a morbid cardiac event, but this group of patients had more evidence of anemia and cardiac ischemia preoperatively, illustrating the pitfalls of observational studies. Most would agree that transfusion is necessary below a Hb of 7 g/dL and unlikely to be necessary at a Hb above 10 g/dL, but most patients fall between these limits, and there are insufficient data in the and residual confounding factors, and may permit them to make a judgment of a causal relationship. Sackett proposed that the evidence generated from meta-analyses of individual patient data be regarded as being equivalent in strength to that generated from RCTs. Meta-analysis is the structured and systematic integration of information from different studies of a given problem. When the results of individual studies are discrepant, the purpose of an overview is to investigate reasons for disagreements among studies. When the results are concordant, the goal of meta-analysis is to derive, through application of a number of quantitative techniques, a measure of the effect of the intervention across combined investigations. This measure is referred to as the 'summary' effect of the treatment under study. Meta-analysis differs from the traditional, narrative reviews of the literature, in that: (1) all completed investigations of the efficacy of an intervention that meet specific, eligibility criteria are retrieved and included in the overview; (2) the quality of retrieved studies is assessed systematically; (3) the degree of agreement among studies is evaluated, both conceptually and based on statistical criteria, and the synthesis of the findings proceeds only if the variation in reported results is sufficiently modest to be attributed to chance; and (4) quantitative methods are used to calculate the summary effect of the intervention and to test that effect for statistical significance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 55, "end": 107, "text": "Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, USA", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "2ED-01-02"}, {"text": "2ED-02-04 Biology of stem cell mobilization TH PAPAYANNOPOULOU University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA At baseline hematopoiesis, the majority of developing hematopoietic cells (precursors, progenitors and stem cells) is actively retained in bone marrow (BM), whereas fully mature cells emigrate to peripheral circulation. A small number of stem/progenitor cells are also present in blood, serving presumed physiologic roles for the repopulation of remote damaged areas. However, in several hematopoietic perturbations, i.e. post irradiation, post chemotherapy or by using empiric treatments, a heightened emigration (mobilization) of progenitor/stem cells was noted over 30 years ago. The introduction of G-CSF as an efficient mobilizing agent not only had a major clinical impact, but has triggered a flurry of studies exploring the mechanisms of mobilization. From these studies, significant insight has been gained about the molecular pathways leading to mobilization, especially by studying the altered environment within BM post mobilization, and less so by studying cells mobilized in blood. Several attractive scenarios have been proposed and their importance was further bolstered by studying genetic mouse models. A prominent role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway has been emphasized, either by down regulation of CXCR4, changes in SDF-1 gradients, or by disruption of SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling. Whether this pathway is disrupted by a proteolytic mechanism prevailing within BM post G-CSF or by other protease-independent mechanisms has not yet been settled. In addition to SDF-1/CXCR4, disruption of other pathways responsible for the retention of primitive cells in BM can lead to mobilization. For example, disengagement of the VLA4/VCAM-1 pathway by anti-functional antibodies or its genetic deficiency in mice results in egress of stem/progenitor cells. Mobilization is also seen following the use of other cytokines (i.e. kit-L, Flt-3 L, IL-3) or chemokines (i.e. IL-8, Gro?), complement activation, etc., but the detailed mechanisms or the interdependence of these other pathways with the ones already proposed have not been worked out. Finally, efforts to improve mobilization efficiency in man has led to the use of combination treatments with G-CSF, either by adding another cytokine (i.e. Growth Hormone), agonistic SDF-1 molecules (i.e. CTCE0021), or CXCR4 antagonists (i.e. AMD3100) which have yielded synergistic increments, and these will be discussed. A full understanding of the principles of mobilization, as well as the BM homing characteristics of mobilized cells after their i.v. infusion in transplantation, should lead to targeted, more efficient experimental protocols in the future.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "2ED-01-02"}, {"text": "The possibility of deriving all kinds of mature cell types from embryonic stem (ES) cells for the purpose of cell replacement therapies will probably face a major obstacle; a limited supply of available HLA types for an ever growing population in demand. One possible solution is to use adult sources of stem cells such as the haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that can repopulate the entire haematopoietic system after transplantation in a myeloablated host. However cells with the repopulating ability of HSCs are still elusive for tissues such as muscle, heart, CNS and pancreas. It was therefore exciting news when it was shown that HSCs could repopulate other non-haematopoietic tissues arguing for a general role of BMderived cells in tissue regeneration. The term Plasticity was thus coined to describe the phenomenon whereby cells of one lineage could trans-differentiate into cells of another tissue. This in turn implied that a certain degree of developmental plasticity was still available in the adult HSC, or their derived progeny, that allowed them to present with novel phenotypes. How exactly this was accomplished was a matter of speculation. In order to address the mechanism we used an animal model of liver failure where BMT with normal (wild type, wt) HSC was shown to rescue the liver failure; the repopulating hepatocytes apparently differentiated from the sole source of wt cells, the BM compartment. By studying the genetic composition of the regenerating liver nodules we observed that both wt and mutant DNA was present in the nodules, a finding that was consistent with BM-derived cells fusing with host hepatocytes. The mechanism of plasticity was therefore directly related to the exposure of the donor BM-derived wt nucleus to the transcriptional environment of the hepatocyte and the expression of hepatocyte-specific genes. This fusion mechanism was also shown to underlie perceived cases of haematopoietic cell transdifferentiation to Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and to cardiomyocytes. However, there are carefully executed studies that strongly support the alternative transdifferentiation mechanism in tissues such as epithelia or the epidermis. What these observations may imply is that in tissues with high rates of cell turnover, there may be a potent stem cell niche that can reprogram incoming cells to follow relevant cell lineages. If this hypothesis is correct, then the major research effort should focus on what makes the niche and whether it can be recreated faithfully in vitro so as to educate HSCs to diverse lineages opening the way for realistic cell replacement therapies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "2ED-03-06 Developmental plasticity of the bone marrow derived cells G VASSILOPOULOS Biomedical Research Institute (IIBEAA), Athens, Greece"}, {"text": "Collection and distribution of blood and its products to meet the medical needs of industrialized countries are typically managed through large-scale national or nationally-supported Blood Programs. The development, maintenance, and ultimate success of such Programs are all components of a process that involves the delicate balance of continuously competing pressures, e.g. social, economic, ethical, political, regulatory/legislative. As with all endeavors that directly affect human life, safety is a central, unifying theme of this process. Because transactions of blood inherently involve risks at both donation and reception/transfusion ends, efforts to enhance and maintain an acceptable level of safety generally rely on a focused program of Risk Management (RM). RM involves three equally important elements: identification/evaluation of risk factors in a process, control of exposure to them, and continuous monitoring to assess the effectiveness of countermeasures and the emergence of new risk factors. Specific approaches to RM and quality assurance in transfusion medicine will be presented. Examples from Blood Programs currently in effect in selected countries will be discussed. RM efforts within the corresponding blood program in Greece will then be examined. The lack of data to adequately assess the status of this program suggests that at least one of the elements of RM -monitoring -can still be improved. A preliminary research effort aims to survey blood donors, transfusion recipients, and physicians in order to build an understanding of the specific factors that drive the perception of risk in the Greek population. The findings form important stepping points upon which specific recommendations can be made for the development and maintenance of a comprehensive, effective RM program in Greece.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "2ED-03-07 Risk management in transfusion medicine L LOUKOPOULOS NASA Ames Research Centre, Athens, Greece"}, {"text": "2ED-03-08 The use of haemovigilance data to increase safety in transfusion medicine", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "2ED-03-07 Risk management in transfusion medicine L LOUKOPOULOS NASA Ames Research Centre, Athens, Greece"}, {"text": "Haemovigilance is a surveillance of all the procedures in the transfusion chain. The intension is to collect and assess information on unexpected or undesirable effects in bleeding of donors and transfusion of blood components. In Europe haemovigilance was introduced as a concept in the middle of the nineties. The first national reports on haemovigilance appeared in the late nineties, and were only dealing with complications related to transfusion. Later on other kind of events like 'near miss' events were added. Nowadays national reports are dealing with all steps in the transfusion line, and to some extend also with complications in blood donors. The state of the art is haemovigilance with retrospective registration of unwanted events that has happened, but also a more active prospective part with an early warning in a rapid alert system about new threats in the transfusion world. The aim of the different national haemovigilance systems has been to improve safety in the transfusion line. After the first 10 years with haemovigilance in the European countries, what has been the outcome of this big effort? Data from national reports do not signify major improvements, but safety is suggested to have improved due to many minor changes of procedures and awareness of dangerous situations. However, in most countries nothing really effective has been done to avoid failures, the most important cause of serious complications in transfusion of patients. Systems which can prevent most of the failures are on the market. The cost of these equals the cost of NAT screening for virus introduced in the same period of time. The common perception of transfusion risks is still much more focused on the hypothetical risk of virus transmission than to the demonstrated magnitude of severe complications related to bleeding of donors and transfusion of patients. Therefore, to increase safety in transfusion medicine the nature and occurrence of the risks should be revealed by haemovigilance and not less important the results should be published with the aim to get a realistic common perception of the transfusion risks.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "J JORGENSEN Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark"}, {"text": "The role of diagnostic testing to identify congenital vs acquired disorders of hemostasis and to optimize the management of perioperative bleeding G DESPOTIS Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA Excessive bleeding with trauma or after surgery can result in hypoperfusion and anemia related end-organ dysfunction and mortality as well as transfusion-related complications. Several large studies have demonstrated that if bleeding is excessive after cardiac surgery to the point that reexploration is required, that overall mortality increases by 3-4 fold. Transfusion related complications include the following potentially lethal complications: disease transmission of pathogens, acute hemolytic reactions, allergic reactions, transfusion associated acute lung injury, allo-immunization related disease (e.g. post-transfusion purpura, platelet refractoriness, transfusion-associated graft-vs-host disease) and other potential complications (e.g. increased perioperative infection or multi-organ system failure) related to transfusion associated immune modulation. In addition, blood shortages related to increasing consumption (i.e. expanding geriatric population) and/or a shrinking supply (i.e. related to exclusion of donors related to donor exclusion criteria designed to prevent disease transmission) may limit our ability to adequately manage our anemic and bleeding patients. This highlights the relative importance of accurate diagnosis and optimal management of excessive bleeding to minimize bleeding related complications and conserve our blood supply. Patients at risk for excessive bleeding include those with an established hereditary disorder (e.g. vWD, Hemophilia, connective tissue disorders), end-stage hepatic or renal disease as well as patients with acquired defects of the hemostatic system. In specific, patients with platelet (i.e. platelet refractoriness) or coagulation factor inhibitors at increased risk, extracorporeal circulation related defects or as related to certain pharmacologic agents). Patients who require longer periods of extracorporeal circulation for cardiac surgical procedures (e.g. repeat, combined procedures or use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest) are at a greater risk of developing excessive bleeding (e.g. CPB-related abnormalities). In addition, patients receiving one or more longacting anti-thrombotic medications in the immediate preoperative period (e.g. Plavix, Reopro, low molecular weight heparin etc) are at increased risk for bleeding. Clinicians in the past have resorted to empiric and 'shot gun' approaches when managing excessive bleeding due lack of immediate availability of results from laboratory-based coagulation tests. On this basis, the use of point-of-care (POC) tests of hemostatic function to facilitate the optimal management of excessive bleeding, help differentiate between microvascular vs surgical bleeding and reduce transfusion have been investigated. Five of six recently published studies have demonstrated that implementation of a standardized approach to manage bleeding (e.g. algorithm) which when coupled with either point-ofcare or laboratory tests of hemostatic function can optimize the management of bleeding and reduce total donor exposures by 50%. DDAVP has bee shown to be beneficial with uremia-induced platelet dysfunction and with Type I von Willbrand's disease. Although previous studies have not been able to conclusively show that DDAVP can reduce bleeding and transfusion when administered prophylactically, more recent evidence indicates that this agent may be useful in preventing excessive bleeding when a test (point-of-care) reveals platelet dysfunction. Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is licensed for use in bleeding episodes in hemophiliac patients with inhibitors. Although, only anecdotal reports and results from small clinical studies have shown that this agent can reverse life-threatening bleeding after major surgery, other reports indicate that there is variability in the effectiveness of rFVIIa as well as highlight lifethreatening thrombotic complications in a subset of high risk patients (i.e. patients with congenital or acquired thrombotic disorders or systemic activation of the hemostatic system such as with DIC or after cardiac surgery). Therefore, large clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of rFVIIa are needed before any widespread use can be recommended.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "2ED-05-14"}, {"text": "In recent years, molecular methods of blood grouping have become routine diagnostic procedures in many laboratories throughout the world. They have proved especially valuable for the determination of fetal blood groups. The ability to detect RHD in pregnancies where the fetus is at risk from haemolytic disease of the newborn represents a significant advance in obstetric care. Furthermore, the occurrence of fetal DNA in the mothers' peripheral blood has allowed this diagnostic procedure to be carried out without the risks that accompany amniocentesis (Lo YMD. (1999) Ann Med 31:308-312). Determination of the coding sequence of all the genes giving rise to antigens within the 29 blood group systems currently recognised is virtually complete. By correlating the coding sequence of these genes with the phenotype of red cells from individuals with different blood groups it has been possible to infer the molecular bases of most of the antigens comprising each blood group system (Daniels GL (2002) Human Blood Groups, 2nd ed. Blackwell Science). The polymorphic antigens of most systems other than ABO and Rh, are defined by single nucleotide substitutions (SNPs) which effect a single amino acid sequence change in the gene product. Numerous methods, both manual and automated, are available to determine SNPs and these have been applied to the determination of blood groups. Useful applications of SNPs detection methods include, determination of the blood group phenotype of patients who have been transfused recently and still have donor blood in their circulation (Rozman P, Dove T, Gassner C et al. (2000) Transfusion 40:936-942), and donor screening to find compatible units for patients with multiple blood group antibodies or for the management of patients with diseases like the haemoglobinopathies who are going to be transfusion-dependent over many years (Castilho L, Rios M, Bianco C et al. (2002) Transfusion 42:232-238). Other applications of molecular methods include zygosity determination for RHD, determination of the blood group phenotype of patients with a positive direct antiglobulin test, selection of donors with rare blood group phenotypes, and as aids to the solution of complex blood grouping problems in the reference laboratory. The molecular bases of ABO and Rh antigens are complex and cannot be determined reliably by a single SNP. Nevertheless, methodologies are available that allow the comprehensive sequence analysis of individual genes and could be applied to ABO and Rh typing. Whether or not this will ever be a cost-effective procedure is a moot point. It is clear that molecular methods are a useful addition to the range of diagnostic procedures available to Transfusion Medicine practitioners but it is important to remember that methods based on DNA analysis determine phenotype by inference and not by direct measurement. The results of molecular tests should be interpreted with this caveat in mind.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 556, "end": 571, "text": "(Lo YMD.

Gennimatas', Athens, Greece Since its discovery in the mouse in 1936 the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has become one of the most important region in the vertebrate genome with respect to infection, autoimmunity and transplantation. MHC primary function is to provide protection against pathogens. This is achieved through sophisticated pathways in which MHC class I molecules present endogenous antiges to CD8+ T cells and class II molecules present exogenous antigens to CD4+ T cells. An increasing number of other proteins are being found that support these two pathways; many of these proteins, together with the class III complement proteins, also map to the MHC. The MHC molecules were originally studied for their ability to cxonfer tolerance (histocompatibility) following tissue grafts or later, organ transplants. Nowadays, the success of unrelated hematopoetic cell transplantation is influenced by the degree of MHC compatibility between the donor and patient. Thus, for patients who lack matched donors, the rules that govern permissibility of MHC mismatching still need to be identified. For patients with high risk disease who lack matched donors, use of donors with a single MHC mismatch may permit early treatment before disease progression.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 15, "end": 78, "text": "G STAVROPOULOS General Hospital 'G.

Despite this limitation and the level of uncertainty it generates with regard to treatment options and policies, it is reassuring to note that current prophylactic platelet transfusion protocols -mostly derived from empirical observations collected during the 1960's and 1970's -protect oncology patients from clinically relevant bleeding in more than 95% of thrombocytopenic days spent in hospital or at home, even in aggressive conditions such as leukemia, lymphoma and other severe blood diseases. This evidence seems to justify the prevalent policy of transfusing platelets when the patient's platelet count falls below 10 000 per microliter (or 20 000 in 'unstable' patients). This policy is based on positive outcomes of prospective and retrospective studies performed during the 1990's including some hundred non-surgical patients and on the desire of balancing the will of reducing patient exposure to limited, expensive, potentially infectious and immunogenic blood products with the objective of preventing clinically relevant hemorrhage. Several national and international organizations endorse the above policy. Although the role of platelet support in surgery or in specific clinical situations requiring invasive procedures or in patients affected by multi-organ and system co-morbidity suffers from even more limited evidence, the latter has been carefully collected and summarized in the guidelines for platelet transfusion published in J Clin Oncol 2001;19:1519-1538. Additional data on lumbar puncture are reported in Ann Hematol 2003;82:570-573. Another important topic where there is room for improvement and need for further investigation is platelet refractoriness, a condition developed by a proportion of chronic platelet recipients, which causes high hemorrhage risk if compatible platelets are not provided and in which consensus on the diagnosis and treatment is lacking. With regard to the type of platelet product, it will be necessary to determine the clinical impact of buffy-coat derived platelets, consistently used in Europe and current object of increased interest in Canada, as compared to the platelet-rich plasma method traditionally used in the US, of viral inactivation procedures and of laboratory methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates. In addition, ongoing studies on the clinical impact of high versus low platelet doses will provide novel elements to determine the relative merits of apheresis versus whole-blood derived platelets. As far as the established procedure of white cell reduction by filtration, which shows high technical efficiency and has been implemented as a standard by a number of institutions, debate is still ongoing on its equivalence with serologic screening for the prevention of CMV transmission, whereas general consensus supports its pre-storage use to prevent febrile, non hemolytic transfusion reactions.

Consequently, the requirements of the Directives are readily implemented in the daily work of the blood establishments before (due to legal and technical reasons) the new Blood Safety Law and the revised NBHW and MPA regulations can be promulgated. To a great extent, requirements of the blood directives are covered by existing Swedish legislation. No major problems or obstacles seem to arise when implementing new requirements into law and regulations and into the blood establishments' daily service. A few detailed requirements have been found difficult to follow precisely in the routine work. These minor difficulties, however, will not compromise the high quality and safety of blood components prepared according to the standards set by the blood directives. The landscape for blood collection and distribution includes availability and safety. True international availability of blood has not been reached. The landscape of safety has been mountainous, if viewed by the degree of frustration among the transfusion specialists. The reasons for frustration have varied from serological problems to those of transmissible infections, to which no end is in sight. Mistrust in the safety of blood taken by others is one reason for lack of international landscape in blood collection and distribution. Increasing demands on safety, availability and economy force the health care providers to reorganise blood services. National systems are winning ground. This may make it easier to achieve international collaboration. The Council of Europe has pioneered in creation of international recommendations for blood collection and distribution. In 1958 a European agreement on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin, including human blood, was published. Its purpose was to make blood available to other parties of the agreement in case of urgent need. Many countries ratified the agreement rapidly, some did it first in the nineties. In practice little exchange of blood components has taken place. The Council of Europe recommendations lack legal power. The European Union is different, and it has taken on its agenda activities aiming at improving confidence in the safety of the blood transfusion chain in the Community (Commission Communication 1994) . The agenda is based on an agreement reached at a high level EU meeting in Adare, Ireland in 1994. First in the Commission agenda was a recommendation on donor selection criteria, given in 1998. Then came the European blood directive 2002/98/EC, the aim of which is to improve the safety of blood and blood components within the Union so that enough mutual trust between member countries can be achieved to make the exchange of blood components possible. Being a legally binding document the directive is undoubtedly helpful in reaching a harmonised standard in Europe. Hopefully the European Commission has the resources to follow its implementation. There are concerns, however. The epidemiological differences among the EU member countries and frequent appearance of new infectious agents potentially transmitted by blood make it difficult to foresee that even effective viral inactivation of blood components could totally erase the national differences in donor approval. Blood collection and preparation of components are already the same in EU member countries and the directive helps in their further standardisation. There has not been much distribution of blood components internationally, with the exception of export of red cell concentrates to the US from Switzerland and the Netherlands. The European legislation opens new horizons and widens the European landscape as its purpose is to simplify the crossing of borders between the member states, but before true movement of blood components is achieved more work is needed on the EU Commission blood agenda.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2665, "end": 2696, "text": "(Commission Communication 1994)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SJ STANWORTH, SJ BRUNSKILL and CJ HYDE National Blood Service, Oxford, UK"}, {"text": "The EU directive implemented into the legal act for polish blood transfusion service", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "M-PL1-04"}, {"text": "Blood Transfusion Service (BTS) in Poland is an integral part of the public Polish health service.

However, one must also take the loss of plasma into consideration -and more difficult: calculate the effects of changes in product quality, as reduced content of factor VIII, protein S and other labile proteins. For methods involving pooling, there are also concerns about the risks due to the pool sizes. The major benefit of the methods will be the potential reduction of infectious transmission, but also possible advantages as reduction of allergic transfusion reactions and TRALI must be evaluated. The study types involved in cost-benefit considerations are costeffectiveness analysis where the cost and effects of an intervention and an alternative are presented in a ratio of incremental cost to incremental effect and cost-utility analysis, where quality-adjusted life years (QALY) are used as the effectiveness endpoint. Qualityadjusted life years is a method that assigns a preference weight to each health state and estimates life-expectancy as the sum of these products of each preference weight and time spent for each state. A complete glossary of terms is found at http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/cearegistry. In literature, there are several publications on cost-benefit considerations within the field of transfusion medicine. Concerning plasma products, the costeffectiveness of solvent-detergent plasma has been the major focus. However, the conclusions of different authors have been conflicting. In 1994, AuBuchon and Birkmeyer published a paper (JAMA 1994; 272(15) :1210-1214) where they concluded that the cost was USD 340 000 per QALY, which is far above the 'acceptable limit' of USD 50 000. This estimate was adjusted to USD 9.7 mill. per QALY in a 1999 letter to JAMA (Jackson, JAMA 282). In 2003 , Riedler et al. published (Vox Sang 2003 85:88-95 ) that the discounted cost/life year saved for SD-FFP use in the UK was GBP 22 278 for neonates and GBP 98 465 for patients aged 70. The main reason for the differences between the two papers (and others) was considered to be different calculation of non-infectious complications. The papers cited above underline the difficulties of the cost-benefit considerations. The age of the patient, the outcome of the treatment, the quality of life in an infected patient and the cost of side effects will differ.

Aim of the study: Evaluation of the quality and stability of MB/light-treated plasma (MB plasma) prepared under worst case conditions for routine processing. Methods: Single donor units (n = 12) were treated using the Macopharma Theraflex MB-Plasma system which includes plasma membrane filtration (PLAS4) and addition of MB prior to illumination followed by MB and photoproduct filtration (Blueflex). Samples were taken before treatment and from the final product. Additionally MB-treated plasma was prepared from four different plasma pools and stored for up to 9 months. Treatment was done under worst case conditions for the preservation of coagulation factors: Maximum MB concentration during illumination (1.15 mmol/l), maximum storage time of whole blood before separation (4\u00b0C, 17 h), maximum storage time of MB plasma before freezing (1 h).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1617, "end": 1628, "text": "(JAMA 1994;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1636, "text": "272(15)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1866, "end": 1873, "text": "In 2003", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1874, "end": 1915, "text": ", Riedler et al. published (Vox Sang 2003", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1916, "end": 1924, "text": "85:88-95", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "2: FRESH FROZEN PLASMA"}, {"text": "Several plasma parameters and the concentration of MB and its photoproducts (azure A, azure B, azure C and thionine) were determined.

No significant changes were detected for AT III, VWF : RCo, VWF cleaving protease, plasmin inhibitor and alpha-1-antitrypsin. The entire virus inactivation procedure including the filtration steps for leukocyte depletion and MB and photoproduct depletion had no significant effect on activation markers (prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, thrombin-antithrombin-complex, D-dimers). No further essential loss of coagulation factor activity was observed during storage of the plasma at 30\u00b0C for 9 months.

Conclusion: Photodynamic treatment of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) using the Theraflex MB-Plasma system leads to only moderate decreases in the activities of different coagulation factors even under worst case conditions for routine production. MB and its photoproducts were effectively removed from the plasma by the Blue-Flex-filter integrated in the Theraflex-System. The quality of MB plasma is well preserved during storage. Pulmonary complications, particularly transfusion-related acute lung injury and circulatory overload, are the most common causes of transfusion-associated morbidity and mortality in the developed world.

Death occurs in 6-23%. The profile of the at-risk recipient has not been identified. Recurrent cases have been infrequently described. There are two prevailing theories of pathogenesis: (1) antibody-mediated and (2) 2-hit hypothesis. Evidence supports both concepts and neither is mutually exclusive. More than 60% of reported cases are associated with blood components containing either HLA-specific (Class I or II) or HNAspecific antibodies. In 50% these antibodies correspond to at least one epitope in the recipient. Most implicated components are donated by multiparous women. Five percent of patients have HLA or HNA antibodies in their pre-transfusion serum. Treatment requires prompt, assertive respiratory intervention, frequently necessitating mechanical ventilation. Because TRALI has a much better prognosis than ARDS, it is an important diagnosis. Some blood collectors are diverting plasma from multiparous donors away from FFP production or routinely screening for HLA antibodies. The most effective method for identifying 'high risk' components has not been identified. Introduction: TRALI is a life threatening adverse reaction of blood transfusion. It is characterized by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema developed soon after blood transfusion. In Japan, we built hemovigilance system in 1993 and have been collecting the voluntary reports of severe adverse reactions of blood transfusion including TRALI cases since 1997. Since the diagnostic criteria of TRALI have not been established until recently and no specific diagnostic markers for TRALI have been discovered so far, it is very difficult to make proper diagnosis of TRALI in each reported case. We have been collecting the cases with respiratory distress and pulmonary edema developed after blood transfusion as suspected case of TRALI. We reevaluated each report whether it meet the recommended diagnostic criteria for TRALI published in Transfusion journal in Dec. 2004 . Aim of the study: Purpose of this study is to select TRALI cases which met internationally recognized criteria so that it will reveal the possible causes of TRALI with laboratory testing for anti-leukocyte antibodies in donors and recipients. Methods: The cases with respiratory failure and pulmonary edema are selected for evaluation from the adverse reaction case reports voluntarily reported to Japanese Red Cross. In order to make a proper diagnosis of TRALI, we have been utilizing the respiratory distress questionnaire which has recently revised. This helps us eliminate other adverse reactions such as circulatory overload, cardiac failure, anaphylaxis and bacterial contamination, which results in selecting out the internationally recognized TRALI cases properly. For laboratory testing, FlowPRA and LabScreen for HLA antibodies and GIFT-FCM for HNA antibodies are performed. The cross-matching test is also performed if possible. Results: During past 8 years, 95 cases of TRALI and 29 cases of possible TRALI have been confirmed by critical review of each questionnaire. Of 95 cases of definite TRALI, donor specimens were obtained in 84 cases. Of 84 cases, anti-leukocyte antibodies were detected in 43 cases (51%) of donors' blood, which was significantly higher than the positive rate of anti-leukocyte antibodies in donors' blood of other adverse transfusion reactions (<10%). Of 43 cases of antibody positive donors, anti HLA antibodies were detected in 33 cases, anti HNA antibodies were detected in 18 cases, and both were detected in 8 cases. Of 33 cases of positive anti HLA antibodies, class I antibodies were detected in 22 cases, class II antibodies were detected in 28 cases, and both were detected in 17 cases. On the other hand, the anti-leukocyte antibodies were detected in 38% of TRALI recipients, and this rate is almost the same with that of positive rate of other adverse reactions of blood transfusion (39%).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2035, "end": 2044, "text": "Dec. 2004", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "M-PA-010 Photodynamic inactivation of human hepatitis B virus in plasma as revealed by long-range PCR"}, {"text": "These results indicate anti-leukocyte antibodies in the blood donors are one of the prerequisites for developing TRALI from the antibody-hypothesis-oriented point of view.

A further 40 cases were reported as acute HTRs (AHTRs; i.e. occurring within 24 hours of transfusion) whilst 213 were recognised more than 24 hours after transfusion and reported as delayed HTRs (DHTR). 21/556 (4%) patients died and 58 suffered major morbidity. HTRs associated with IBCT result from clinical or laboratory errors and are all preventable. It has been assumed that other HTRs are unavoidable. Closer scrutiny reveals that this may not always be the case, though review is hampered by incomplete investigations. 9/40 AHTRs occurred in group A (8/9) or group B (1/9) patients given group O platelets. Of the 31 AHTRs related to red cell transfusion, 4 were due to errors, 9 were in patients with auto-antibodies, in only 4 of whom alloantibodies had been adequately excluded/identified. At least 24/213 DHTRs were potentially avoidable; in 18 cases the antibody was detectable retrospectively in the pre-transfusion sample; in 6 cases the presence of a previous antibody was not communicated to the laboratory. Two patient deaths related to DHTR might have been avoided by earlier diagnosis and clinical involvement. 14% HTRs reported to SHOT would have been avoided by compliance with pretransfusion testing guidelines and provision of group A platelets for all group A recipients. HTRs can be clinically overlooked and inadequately investigated.

Aims: The goals of this study were: (a) to obtain an effective apheretic protocol for MNC harvesting, and (b) to compare the hematopoietic reconstitution after HSPC transplantations in different clinical settings. Methods: In this study, PBSC transplantations -60 allogeneic from matched sibling healthy donors and 60 autologous -were performed in the management of patients with severe aplastic anemia, leukemias (ALL, ANLL, CML), multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast and ovarial cancer, and extragonadal non-seminal germ cell tumor. PBSC mobilization was achieved with rhG-CSF (5-16 g/kgbm/day). MNC-apheresis procedures (generally one and occasionally two) were performed using blood cell separator COBE-Spectra. The first MNC-apheresis was accomplished when the leukocyte cont was 5-10 \u00a5 10E9/L (autologous setting) or on the 5th day 4-5 hour after the last rhG-CSF administration (allogeneic setting). The processed blood volume during one MNC-apheresis was 12. 7-22.2 L, and 24 .3 L for one PBSC transplantation in average. Results: Using a minimal target dose of CD34+ cell count (3 \u00a5 10E6/kgbm), performing one MNC-apheresis procedure for 86% recipients sufficient number of PBSCs were obtained. The MNC yield was 10.1 \u00a5 10E8/kgbm in allogeneic and 8.1 \u00a5 10E8/kgbm in autologous setting in average. The mean CD34+ yields for allogeneic and autologous transplantations were 12.1 \u00a5 10E6/kgbm and 6.5 \u00a5 10E6/kgbm, respectively. Hematopoietic reconstitution was achieved on the 9.4th day for leukocytes and the 13.05th day for platelets when PBSC transplantation was applied. Summary/conclusion: Improved MNC and CD34+ cell yield, as well as rapid hematopoietic reconstitution were observed when: (a) The intention of auditing any clinical practice is, ostensibly, to improve patient care. The term 'audit' implies comparison against a standard. Although absolute indications for transfusion have not been defined by clinical trials applicable to most clinical situations, many institutions have established their own transfusion triggers based on their reading of the literature and common practice at that hospital. Assuming these represent prudent guidelines, comparison of actual practice to them may allow physicians to re-assess their pattern of hemotherapy and bring it into conformance with the guideline. There are several common ways of performing transfusion audits. Retrospective analysis of transfusions allows appreciation of the clinical situation (and its ultimate outcome) but reviews the event through a 'retrospectoscope' that assesses clinical information in a different manner than that available to the clinician making the decision to transfuse. Furthermore, the time lapse between the decision to transfusion and feedback about that decision may render the feedback from the reviewing body (e.g., a transfusion committee or blood utilization review committee) of little practical import. To speed the provision of feedback and emphasize educational rather than any punitive outcomes of the audit, some facilities have abolished attempts at determining whether the decision to transfuse was supportable and have used electronic means to feed back to clinicians a non-judgmental informational message summarizing the literature regarding the indications for transfusion. This appears to be at least as effective as the traditional retrospective audit system. Prospective review of requests for blood components have the potential to redirect practice in a manner that immediately helps patients. However, such interactions with clinicians may come at inopportune times, may require considerable (unscheduled) time, and are most likely to be fruitful if a knowledgeable transfusion medicine expert can serve as the intermediary. Both approaches (or a combination) have been shown to be beneficial in altering practice, but efforts must be diligent and sustained. Providing data comparing a physician's practice to colleagues in the same specialty may prompt additional introspection and practice change, particularly if physician leadership of the institution supports the effort as a quality improvement tool. Extending the comparison to a group of physicians and contrasting their transfusion habits with benchmark data from other institutions may also be helpful, but one needs to be ready to counter arguments that differences in patient groups are the reason for the differences in practice (Studies have shown that, in general, practice patterns are primarily related to training and habit rather than large differences in patient acuity). Increased focus on the performance of hospitals as expressed in outcome data may soon extend to transfusion practices as well. The public or governmental institutions may ask to see data illustrating the transfusion practice of an institution and its improvement over time. Carefully conducted, diligent, and ongoing transfusion audits are an integral part of an institution's quality improvement program.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 313, "end": 336, "text": "MNC harvesting, and (b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1236, "text": "7-22.2 L, and 24", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "M-PA-026 Large volume vs. standard mononucrear cell (MNC) harvesting for peripheral blood stem cell transplantation M TRKULJIC, B BALINT, G OSTOJIC and L RISTIC Military Medical Academy, Belgrade, Serbia"}, {"text": "Informed consent: The term informed consent, appeared for the first time in the late 40s but it was only in the 70s that it attracted attention with regard to health care. Numerous discussions and publications have attempted to define the meaning and the justification of informed consent in recent years. Initially it consisted in the obligation of the physician to disclose information to the patient, regarding the procedure he was to undergo, but more recently, ethicists have emphasized the need to ensure the patient's understanding and his autonomous decision to consent. Current institutional rules of ethics demand that the physician must obtain the informed consent of a patient 'prior to any substantial intervention' . What is however the meaning of informed consent? Is it a mutual decision making between physician and patient? In 'Principles of Biomedical Ethics' Beauchamp and Childress claim that' it is critically important to distinguish informational exchanges through which patients elect medical interventions, from acts of approving and authorizing those interventions. The elements of consent include: disclosure, voluntariness, decision and authorization. When applying the concept of informed consent in Transfusion Medicine one can distinguish it into Donors' and Patients' consent. Donor informed consent: Information to blood donors constitutes a sensitive issue. It refers to their protection from side-effects of the donation, as well as to protection of the recipient. With regard to whole blood donors a detailed history and information as to side effects are necessary for first-time donors. For repeat donors one needs mainly an updated history. Because of time-pressure, whole blood donors are usually given written information and are asked to answer written questions. Donors however differ in literacy and even literate ones do not always understand medical terminilogy; so, during the interview one should probe the degree of understanding of each donor. With first time apheresis donors more time is needed in order to explain the procedure and potential side effects. Since granulocyte and stem-cell donors require premedication with growth factors and or corticosteroids, the responsibility for detailed information is even greater. The fact that all donors sign the informed consent does not mean that they are all adequately informed! Interviewers must be familiar with side effects, their frequency and sequelae and must pass on this information.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A MANIATIS Henry Dunant Hospital, Athens, Greece"}, {"text": "Misses and near-misses, (serious) adverse events and failures in medical practice seem to be not preventable. In medical interventions, preparing and prescribing of medication, assistance by doctors and nurses, medical treatment and follow-up, unwanted and unexpected events occur (http://www.mederrors.com.). These events happen also in transfusion medicine and focus on safety is not unique. Haemovigilance which is defined in the EU Blood Directive as 'a set of organised surveillance procedures relating to serious adverse or unexpected events or reactions in donors or recipients, and the epidemiological follow-up of donors' (EU Directive 2002/98/EC Off. J. European Union.8.2.2003:L33/30-L33/40) is established to help in trying to identify and minimise the misses and (serious) adverse events in the chain from donor to recipient of blood components. The causes or reasons should be studied in order to prevent re-occurrence. Adverse event reporting in blood transfusion and transfusion medicine is complex. It depends on the cooperation between blood establishments with clinicians and hospitals. It implies knowledge of blood banking, transfusion medicine and routine clinical care of all gender and ages, of potential hazards of transfusion, of immune-haematology, of microbiology, and of epidemiology. An adverse event may have its cause in every single part of the blood chain and reference may take place to a proven problem, a potential problem, or to a justified doubt. In almost all blood transfusion centres, a single donation will be processed into a number of different products, and these units might be divided or processed into more products. Blood components are produced from whole blood or apheresis donations, and depending of the blood drawing and processing techniques, a high number of products with different specifications is prepared. The products' shelf life is not equal and therefore the moment in time of actual use of each unit prepared from the same donation may differ. In case the unit of platelets harms the recipient, a rapid alert can warn in order not to issue or to transfuse the unit of red cells or the unit of FFP prepared from the same donation because of the potential adverse reaction, which was detected during or after the transfusion of the first unit used. Haemovigilance is not only important to blood establishments and to patients and prescribers, but it is also to clinical scientists, and to the public at large. It should provide a basis for minimising adverse reactions on blood components, and it should enable the therapeutic potential of new or established treatments with components to be maximised, since demonstrations of safety during widespread use may lead to extended usage, and wider availability. It is quite worrisome that underreporting is a general problem in medical care. It might be expected that in transfusion medicine the same rates of underreporting can be found, but also that the same mechanisms for improvement are applicable. Although medical misses occur and do not seem to be preventable, the handling of these misses is often quite poor. Many patients like to hear a detailed explanation, and the majority expects even apologies from the treating physician. It seems desirable to look for new routes in the prevention of unwanted events of transfusion medicine. For problem solving, analysis and improvement of working methods, where needed and possible, are often the most effective methods. Attention should be focused on improvement and not on identification of the person who caused the problem ('bad apple'). Lack of communication and insufficient insight in each other work are often the causes of problems and unwanted events. It should be recognised that advices given by the haemovigilance officer or the blood transfusion committee about prevention without the input and commitment of the direct responsible persons will lead in most cases to advices which are not effective or which will not be accepted. Setting up a haemovigilance system or appointing of haemovigilance officers or installation of blood transfusion committees will not be sufficient. It will be necessary to develop ways of registration, data collection and analysis, but more importantly to support by giving advice and training to prevent reoccurrence of the adverse events or not optimal use of blood components. The confidentiality of the information should be guarded sufficiently.

This will require investment in infrastructure, for which there must be a trade-off in improved transfusion safety. Transfusion-transmitted infections and serious immunological reactions are rare; SHOT has highlighted the need for blood services to implement strategies to minimise bacterial contamination and transfusion related acute lung injury and will monitor their effectiveness. From the inception of SHOT it has been clear that the most frequent transfusion hazard is 'incorrect blood component transfused' i.e. a patient receiving a blood component intended for another person or not meeting appropriate requirements. Only a minority of these events results in patient harm and is reportable under the terms of the Directive. Haemovigilance schemes such as SHOT, that analyse no-harm errors and near-misses, can reveal clues as to the root causes of 'wrong blood', which contributed to 16 deaths and 85 cases of major morbidity in the UK between 1996 and 2003 . Analysis of such events shows that most errors occur in clinical areas, the most frequent being failure of the 'bedside check' . Clinical audit data indicates that 10% of patients are transfused without a wristband or other form of identification, whilst anecdotal reports suggest that urgent clinical situations, massive transfusions and nocturnal transfusions are particularly error-prone. Strategies aimed at reducing errors include structured education and competency testing, and methodologies, both high and low-tech, to ensure accurate patient identification in all circumstances. Onethird of errors occurs in hospital laboratories; denominator data on laboratory workload shows that work done outside of 'core hours' accounts for 20% of all pre-transfusion testing but 40% of errors, suggesting that biomedical scientists 'on-call' or on shift work are working under pressure and beyond their competency. 85% of hospitals reported that they participated in SHOT in 2003, but only 47% of eligible hospitals reported adverse events suggesting that transfusion hazards remain under-recognised and under-reported. However, benchmarking of 'wrong blood' incidents against transfusion activity shows that the number of observed incidents is roughly proportional to blood use. If haemovigilance data is to contribute to improved transfusion safety, clinicians must be encour-aged to report all events, thus contributing to an evidence base that can be used to effect change and facilitate learning. Barriers to reporting include cumbersome systems, lack of time and resource, lack of feedback and fear of blame. Transfusion Practitioners have a vital role in the recognition and reporting of adverse events, education and clinical audit, but must be adequately resourced and supported by senior clinicians and managers through an active Hospital Transfusion Committee. *Provisional.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1039, "end": 1058, "text": "UK between 1996 and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1063, "text": "2003", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A MANIATIS Henry Dunant Hospital, Athens, Greece"}, {"text": "M-PA-033 Passing the borders: when, how and where D PIRC-TILJAK Croatian Institute of Transfusion Med., Zagreb, Croatia", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A MANIATIS Henry Dunant Hospital, Athens, Greece"}, {"text": "There may come that moment in professional life when you have to follow a strong professional and ethical need and confront your evidence-based statements with the leadership, passing the border of your own small society.

Aim: The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of leukocyte-reduced red cells (LR-RBC) processed through this filter and stored for 42 days. Red cell quality was determined by measuring the in vivo red blood cell recovery 24 hours after re-infusion of the 42-day stored red cells. Storage hemolysis and ATP were also determined. Methods: Units of blood (450 ml) were collected from normal volunteers into the Leukotrap WB System containing CP2D/AS-3 anticoagulant/preservative solutions (Pall Medical). Units were either processed to LR-RBC within 8 hours at room temperature (RT units), or after 24 hours at 1-6\u00b0C (cold units). The prion filter set was sterilely connected to the units on day 1, and the units were filtered and stored for 42 days. Samples were taken pre-and post-prion filtration and post-storage for plasma hemoglobin and ATP determinations. Post-storage samples were taken for labeling with 51-Cr radioisotope, re-infusion, and determination of the 24-hour in vivo RBC recovery. A donor sample was also labeled with 99m-Tc to allow for red cell mass determination. Thus, both single-and double-label 24-hour recovery values were calculated. Results: Twelve units were collected. In vitro testing was completed on all units. In vivo testing was completed on 11 units. The mean single-label 24-hour recoveries were 84.4% and 85.7% for the RT and cold units, respectively. The mean double-label recoveries were 81.9% and 84.1% for the RT and cold units, respectively. The overall combined mean in vivo and in vitro results are shown in the Table.

Aims: This study compared the efficacy of bacterial screening using a culture method (BacT/Alert System, Biomerieux) with pathogen inactivation (INTERCEPT Blood System) for prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with bacteria. Methods: Seven strains of bacteria associated with TAS, including Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the anaerobes Propionibacterium acnes and Clostridium perfringens were studied. For each strain, three double-dose platelet concentrates (~6 \u00a5 10E 11 platelets in 600 mL of 35% plasma and 65% InterSol) were collected using the Amicus\u00ae Cell Separator. On day of collection, calibrated stocks of bacteria (20, 200, 2000 cfu) were added to the double units. Each double unit was divided into two identical products containing 10, 100, or 1000 cfu of bacteria and stored overnight under conventional blood bank conditions. The Control platelet concentrate was not treated. The Test platelet concentrate was treated with the INTERCEPT process (150 mM amotosalen + 3 J/sq cm UVA). Both units were cultured using the BacT/Alert System at the time of bacterial inoculation and on days 1, 2 and 5 of storage. Samples (10 mL) were taken for both the aerobic and anaerobic cultures. A platelet sample was considered contaminated with bacteria if a positive signal was registered within 120 hours of culture. Results: For Control platelet concentrates, cultures failed to detect low-dose inocula. The time to positive culture varied with the bacterial strain, contamination level, and time of sampling. At 10 and 100 cfu per product, 4 strains (S. epidermidis, E. coli, C. perfringens, S. agalactiae) and 2 strains (E. coli, C. perfringens) tested negative after 5 days of platelet storage, respectively. K. pneumoniae tested positive after 7-8 hours of culture when sampled on day 2 of platelet storage for both 10 and 100 cfu per product. At 1000 cfu per product, P. acnes tested negative in aerobic culture and C perfringens tested negative in anaerobic culture after 5 days of platelet storage. The anaerobic cultures of P. acnes became positive after 50 hours of culture when sampled on day 5 of platelet storage. Of the 7 strains studied, only S. aureus consistently tested positive after 7-16 hours of culture. In contrast, all Test platelet concentrates treated with INTERCEPT remained negative by BacT/Alert cultures throughout the entire 5-day observation period regardless of the strain and the contamination level. Conclusions: Bacterial detection using cultures may fail to detect low levels of bacteria typically associated with platelet contamination at time of collection and processing. Failure to detect bacteria will result in the release of contaminated platelet products with 'test negative-to-date' status. In contrast, inactivation of bacteria is capable of preventing release of contaminated platelet components. Background: Since NAT implementation for HIV-1 and HCV RNA in France, the residual risk (RR) of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTI) has dramatically decreased. The RR estimates, for a threeyear period from 2001 to 2003 showed a significant decrease from 1/1 700 000 and 1/1 560 000 before NAT implementation to 1/3 150 000 and 1/10 000 000 after NAT implementation for HIV and HCV respectively. As for HBV, the serological screening is only based on both HBsAg and anti-HBc assays. For the same period, the RR estimate for HBV is 1/640 000, five times higher than HIV one and 16 times higher than HCV one. Aims: As the overall RR of TTI is mainly related to HBV, and given the availability of HBV NAT assays, a study was conducted to determine whether HBV NAT has the ability to further reduce the HBV RR and then should be implemented in blood donor screening in France.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 911, "end": 930, "text": "(20, 200, 2000 cfu)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "M-PA-035 New methods and current trends in donor testing (for infection)"}, {"text": "We have estimated the WP reduction by NAT in comparison with one of the most sensitive HBsAg screening assays, on 10 commercial seroconversion panels (Bioclinical Partners, Franklin, MA, USA). The NAT test was the Procleix Ultrio assay (Genprobe/Chiron, San Diego, USA). The HBs Ag test was the Prism HBsAg (Abbott, France). The comparison was performed on both neat samples and diluted samples 1/8, 1/16, and 1/24, in order to simulate minipools of different sizes. Then, we have calculated the yield of HBV-infected donations detected by NAT relative to Prism HBsAg assay. Results: On the basis of a window period (WP) of 56 days, Ultrio Assay is projected to close the WP by an average of 15 days on undiluted samples, 5 days in minipools of 8 samples, 4 days in minipools of 16 samples and only 2 days in minipools of 24 samples. The projected yield calculated on the basis of 2.4 million donations collected per year in France, would be 0.65 unit per Year for minipool-NAT and 2 to 3 units per year for individual donation NAT. Conclusion: Introduction of minipool-NAT will offer only a little added benefit to transfusion safety relative to current serological screening strategies based on both HBsAg and anti-HBc assays. HBV minipool-NAT is then unsuitable for HBV screening in French blood donors. Single-sample NAT or minipool-NAT with smaller pool sizes and/or modified procedures (genome enrichment or test improvement) would be more relevant. Automation when technologically and practically feasible is a prerequisite for single-donation NAT. Therefore, decision has been made not to implement HBV NAT in the French transfusion network until fully automated systems will be available. However, as the prevalence of HBV infections is higher in the overseas territories than in continental France, and as NAT is performed on individual donations in these sites, HBV-NAT has been implemented since December 2004 in these territories.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "Combined detection of hepatitis C virus core antigen and antibody as an alternative to nucleic acid testing in blood screening grating the capillary cytometer with a robotic workstation and a small footprint centrifuge.

Most likely this DNA is derived fom apoptotic syncitiorophoblasts. The human placenta is hemichorial, which means that the syncitiotrophoblast is in direct contact with the maternal blood flow, and apoptotic nuclei are directly released into the maternal circulation. The cell free DNA is very rapidly cleared from the circulation, the T1/2 being only 15 minutes. In 1998 we have shown that this cell free fetal DNA could be used for RHD genotyping. In the last 5 years many groups have shown the successful application of different prenatal genotyping assays such as fetal sexing, thalassemia, achondroplasia, Duchenne's disease, adrenogenital syndrome etc. on this source of DNA. Importantly, no false positive result have been described due to the presence of fetal DNA from previous pregnancies, the main draw back of prenatal diagnostics on circulating fetal cells. At present prenatal RHD genotyping has been introduced in routine diagnostics in the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands. In large scale high throughput studies it has been shown that the diagnostic accuracy of prenatal RHD genotyping is over 99%, and it is to be expected that in the Netherlands this screening will soon be introduced to restrict the antenatal anti-D immunoprophylaxis to women carrying RhD-positive fetuses. In a large European project (SAFE, co-ordinator Maj Hulten, Warwick UK) many researchers collaborate to further explore the possibilities of cell free fetal DNA for future diagnostics. Standard operating procedures for the isolation of plasma DNA have been established. Control PCRs for the presence of fetal DNA have been developed. Recent findings on differences in methylation status of placental genes in fetal DNA opens new possibilities. The main technical problem that hampers wide application of prenatal genotyping is the impurity of the fetal DNA, only 1-5% of the cell free DNA in plasma is from fetal origin. This makes diagnostic assays on numerical chromosomal abnormalities impossible. And also for many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as almost all blood group antigens, assays are hampered by aspecific amplification from maternal DNA. Our own preliminary results indicate that this latter problem can be solved by PNA clamping. The addition of a PNA probe specific for the k-allele Partial D feature D antigen alteration, often identified as distinct 'partial' D epitope loss. The clinical impact of partial Ds is due to the ability of their carriers to form anti-D antibodies upon confrontation with regular D after transfusion, or pregnancy. This leads to the -naively spoken -contradictory finding of an allo anti-D antibody in a D positive individual in connection with a negative autocontrol. The antibodies themselves include the same fatal clinical potential as anti-D antibodies of D negative individuals, but may be even more hazardous since unexpected in D positive individuals a priori. D categories (II to VII) represent a nomenclatorily defined subgroup of partial Ds. The molecular cause of partial D lies within single (caused by point mutation in the respective RHD gene sequence), or multiple amino acid exchanges (caused by gene conversion events leading to RHD-RHCE-RHD hybrid genes) which determines a qualitative D antigen alteration, rendering them distinguishable from regular D by a partial D carriers immune system. Nowadays, transfusion specialists and gynaecologists are more or less aware of these facts and are taking them into consideration in the clinical setting. Most partial D exhibit decreased D antigen density, enabling principal recognition of them. However, routine serological methods may not properly recognise all partial Ds and will identify their carriers after immunisation only, which represents a reactive diagnostic/therapeutic attitude second best to an actively prognostic one. This actively prognostic proceeding with respect to early detection of partial Ds became widely feasible by RHD DNA typing techniques. Currently, routine RHD DNA typing techniques offer an affordable, accurate and fast approach to an unambiguous identification of partial Ds and their reliable discrimination from weak D types, not at risk for allo anti-D immunisation. A reasonable proactive proceeding could e.g. demand for (once in a lifetime) routine RHD DNA typing of all weakly expressed Ds as defined by serology, since most partial Ds also meet this phenotype. RHD allele frequencies and their geographical and regional prevalence will certainly have an important impact on DNA typing strategies and their (mandatory) specificities.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 77, "end": 150, "text": "VAN DER SCHOOT Sanquin Research, Amsterdam, Netherlands In 1997 Lo et al.", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "M-PA-042"}, {"text": "Fluorescence cytometry for completely automated immunohematology testing D ROBACK*, B BARCLAY \u2020 and D HILLYER \u2020 *Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, \u2020 Transfusion & Transplantation Technologi, Decatur, GA, USA", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "M-PA-041"}, {"text": "We previously described a methodology for accurate immunohematology testing by fluorescence cytometry [Roback, J.D. et al.

When authentic clinical samples from hospitalized patients were tested for ABO group, the presence of D antigen, and red cell alloantibodies, the results were well-correlated with those obtained by commerciallyavailable column agglutination technology (CAT). This system determined the correct ABO group and D type for 98.7% of 520 samples, compared to 98.8% for CAT (P > 0.05). When samples were tested for unexpected alloantibodies, FC determined the correct result for 98.6% of 215 samples, as compared to 96.3% for CAT (P > 0.05). This novel method was better than CAT at detecting weak anti-A (P < 0.0001) and alloantibodies. Based on these promising results, we sought to completely automate this method by inte-prevents the aspecific amplification of the k-allele, and makes it possible to detect the fetal K-allele in the presence of excess of maternal k-alleles. Furthermore, it has been shown that fetal DNA is in the plasma present in shorter fragments (<300 bp) than maternal DNA. Size separation of cell free fetal DNA can therefore be used to increase the relative concentration of fetal DNA, which will help the development of new genotyping assays. In conclusion, cell free fetal DNA in maternal plasma is nowadays routinely used for prenatal RHD typing and fetal sexing. New technical developments will make it possible to extend these indications to other blood group antigens in the near future.

But recovered platelets do not express the HPA-15 alloantigens. Aim of the study: Here we describe a method for the successful preservation of platelets by lyophilization. We report the value of this new reagent for the detection of HPA alloantibodies and especially anti HPA-15 alloantibodies. Methods: Rehydrated lyophilised platelets (Lyo P) were tested for their reactivity with monoclonal antibodies against GPIIbIIIa, GPIbIX, GPIaIIa and CD109 by flow cytometry. The levels of reactivity were comparable with the ones obtained with fresh platelets. The rehydrated platelets were used in the MAIPA with a panel of HPA antibodies (anti-HPA-1a, 30; anti-HPA-1b, 3; anti-HPA-3a, 3; anti-HPA-5a, 3; anti-HPA-5b, 50; anti-HPA-15a, 2 and anti-HPA-15b, 4). Results: All HPA antibodies showed the expected pattern of reactivity and in several cases absorbance reading were well above those obtained with fresh platelets. Absorbance values produced by inert sera were comparable with those obtained with fresh platelets (ranges 0.001-0.008). Interestingly, we used lyophilized platelet with a high expression of CD 109 bearing the HPA-15 system and we have detected 24 anti HPA 15 antibodies among 1000 sera previously negative with fresh platelets. Nineteen sera concerned patients suffering from hematological diseases and 5 from pregnancy women.

Transfusion of the infant, especially the premature infant, and sick child, especially those with major organ dysfunction, requires careful consideration of their unique metabolic, hepatic and renal clearance mechanisms. Guidelines that direct the indications for transfusion differ from those in adults. Non-invasive measures of oxygen delivery and oxygen offloading may assist in guidelines for red blood transfusion. Metabolic complications from massive transfusion and/or the manipulation of blood products must also be considered. Evidence from a high quality randomised controlled trial suggests that anaemia is also well tolerated by critically ill patients. A restrictive approach to RBC transfusion that maintained the Hb concentration between 70 and 90 g/L was found to be as effective as and possibly superior to a more liberal strategy of maintaining the Hb concentration between 100 and 120 g/L. There are concerns that some groups of critically ill patients, such as those with cardiovascular disease and patients who are difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation, may benefit from higher Hb levels.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "M-PA-044 Lyophilized platelets (Lyo P) used for the detection of HPA antibodies by MAIPA assay D RIGAL EFS Lyon, Lyon, France"}, {"text": "RBCs also have a role in primary haemostasis and higher triggers may be appropriate in coagulopathic patients. It is important to realise that blood is not a uniform product and the clinical efficacy of RBC transfusion may vary. One factor that may have a considerable effect on the quality of the RBC product is the storage time. RBCs undergo marked changes during refrigerated storage. The implications of these changes on tissue oxygenation are not known but these concerns have led some clinicians to request 'fresh' blood for critically ill patients. There is insufficient evidence to support such practice. It is of great practical importance to determine if, or when, fresh RBCs could be superior to stored RBCs. Background: With a decreasing blood donor base, fully tested, fresh unrefrigerated whole blood (FUWB) has been found to be a more efficient and effective use of a limited resource in place of, or as an adjunct to, traditional blood component therapy in surgical situations associated with massive blood loss. Aims: To outline the use of FUWB in situations where there is potential for intractable bleeding associated with major surgery, and evaluate platelet function in FUWB versus platelet components. Methods: Outcomes of FUWB and traditional blood component use were examined for 20 cases of cardiac bypass surgery. In addition, exclusive use of FUWB for 23 burns debridement cases was analysed.

The impact of consensus guidelines for allogenic blood transfusion during coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) in US attracted great attention 1. The present study is conducted in order to reveal the transfusion practice in Greece on a similar population i.e. patients undergoing CABG operations. Methods: Five participating centers collected data concerning transfusion of allogenic blood and blood products in patients undergoing elective first time CABG procedures, as well as parameters that may influence blood loss, such as duration of the operation, cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPB) etc. The total estimated blood loss was calculated as the sum of red blood cell volume reduction [(Body Weight in kg \u00a5 60 ml/kg) \u00a5 (admission haematocrit-discharge haematocrit)]+(red blood cell volume transfused). Results: Results are shown in Table 1 : Means, standard deviations, and p-values of the Wilcoxon test comparisons between the hospitals. A preliminary analysis of data from 5 centres (268 patients) showed no difference in patient characteristics (age, body weight, male to female ratio). There is a statistically significant difference (P < 0.0001) between the five centers in duration of the operation, CPB, estimated blood loss and volume of transfused plasma. Red cell use showed also a variation which however did not reach statistical significance (P < 0.02). The center with the highest figure for blood loss has the lowest volume of allogeneic red cell transfusion because of the use of cell salvage. Conclusions: Although variations, as those observed in Greek cardiac surgery centers, have been documented in other countries, the variation in the use of plasma is striking and we are in the process of trying to identify the reasons. Our study is in progress and additional data are being collected and will be presented. Introduction: Premature infants and at term newborns have an higher circulating blood volume per Kilogram than the adults (100 mL/kg in premature; 80 mL/kg in at term), for this reason, in case of neonatal thrombocytopenia, a specific hemocomponent, with a very high Platelet concentration, needs for transfusion therapy. The laboratory criteria for Platelet transfusion are the following: (A) a PLT count < 150 \u00a5 10 9 cells/L if bleeding is observed; (B) a PLT count < 20 \u00a5 10 9 cells/L without bleeding; (C) a PLT count < 50 \u00a5 10 9 cells/L in newborns showing critical clinical conditions. Aim of this study: In this study, we have monitored the PLT transfusion therapy in our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in the last four years. Methods: Effects of PLT transfusions have been followed in 37 children (31 premature infants and 6 at term newborns). The weight of premature infants ranged from 600-1800 g and at term newborn from 1800-4000 g. Gestation age of premature infants ranged from 26-36 weeks and of at term ones, of course, from 37-42 weeks. For every Platelet transfusion in these newborns, the volume of Platelet Concentrate has been of 10-20 mL/kg, with a PLT count < 700 \u00a5 10 9 cells/L. Results : In the study period, 77 PLT transfusions have been performed: 23 children have been only transfused one time, while  multiple PLT transfusions (ranged 2-10) needed for 14 children  according to clinical conditions. The observed clinical indications  for transfusions have been the sepsis with haemorrhagic syndrome  (26 cases) , haemorrhagic syndrome without sepsis (7 cases) and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia without haemorrhagic syndrome (4 cases). After 24 hours from transfusion therapy, the absolute PLT count and the Correct Count Increment have increased in all 37 little patients.

Aims: Russian blood service assessment with international comparison. Methods: A study was conducted on the base of the reports from all regions of Russia followed by a computer statistical analysis. Results: Blood and blood components were collected in the Russian Federation in 2003 in 190 stations of blood transfusion and in 1065 blood transfusion departments at big hospitals. Amount of donors in 2003 was equal to 2 202 853, voluntary donors being 87.2% of them. The average number of whole blood donations in relation to the general population is 25 per 1000 inhabitants, and on average 28 percent of the donor base consists of first time donors. The average number of blood collected in relation to the general population and health care system is 11.4 ml per inhabitant and 1240 ml per one bed.

Since last 5 years even the most developed countries started to discuss about the cost of blood. In Turkey Ministry of Health determines the cost of blood annually. Aim: To establish a safe, cost effective and reliable prices for blood components. Methods: Turkish Ministry of Health (MoH) started to determine the cost of blood components as 'all inclusive' principle. This means that cost of a unit of blood component will cover all conventional expenses such as; blood typing, infectious screening, labour, consumables, etc. This system has provided uniformity to blood component costs but if the system is not controlled and followed properly it will cause serious risks. There might be some blood banks which will not respect the safety regulations and may modify the test standards for decreasing the cost of tests. Conclusion: Current blood product pricing system looks generally reasonable and reliable but MoH should establish close follow up systems for avoiding any abuse on the safety of blood. Background: A positive direct antiglobulin test occasionally occurs in normal blood donors, and is often discovered when the donor's red cells are found incompatible in a compatibility test. The incidence of a positive DAT was expected to increase since more sensitive techniques (gel test) were installed. The aim of our study was to examine whether DAT positive otherwise healthy donors presented any clinical or laboratory abnormalities. Methods: In the first 19.000 cross-matches last year (in 10 months) 38 were found incompatible due to DAT positivity of blood donors' red cells (0.02%). DAT positive [(1+)-(3+)] samples were only IgG positive in 32 cases, only C3d positive in 5 and IgM positive and C3d positive in 1 case. All blood donors were notified and thirty two of them responded to a request for a further sample. A complete blood count, a reticulocyte count, bilirubin (total, direct, indirect), transaminases, serologic immunological tests (ANA, anti-DNA, anti-ENA, RF, anticardiolipin antibodies), quantitative assessment of immunoglobulins, APTT and lupus anticoagulant were performed, as well as serologic tests for markers of viral infections. DAT and IAT were performed by gel test (ID-DiaMed) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DAT were performed with polyvalent and monovalent reagents (anti-IgG, -IgM, -IgA, -C3c, -C3d).

The aim of this study is to analyze the number of deferred blood donors and the reasons for their deferral, as well as the total number of blood donors in NITM and their correlation (voluntary/family donors). Materials and methods: This is a retrospective, epidemiological study and data were taken from the Blood Donor's Registry in NITM from 01.01.2000 till 31.12.2004. Statistical mass includes blood donors who came to NITM to donate blood in the mentioned period. Results: There were total 14 229 donors in NITM and 541 (3.8%) deferrals. 71.5% of deferred ones are male, as well as in the group with donated blood (males are predominant). The most common reason for deferral is low Hb level in 232 (42.9%) blood donors, use of drugs -78 (14.4%), low blood pressure -47 (8.7%), high blood pressure -43 (7.9%), infections -30 (5.5%), cardiovascular diseases -21 (3.9%) and others.

Conclusion: First step in planning the blood donation in multiethnic society is creation of special teams of important and devoted volunteers, such as religious leaders, teachers, doctors and businessman. For a successful campaign it is necessary to design special promotional material and address personally to the target population on their mother language. Background: Pursuit of pharmaceutical purity of the blood in the bag has led to a shrinking donor base and a significantly more expensive product. Decisions regarding new infectious marker testing and donor deferrals have typically been made emphasizing decreasing one specific risk without considering the effect the intervention will have on the overall safety of blood transfusion. Regulations have been formulated by governmental agencies with limited input from the medical community. The decision making process has lacked risk benefit analyses and has not had the robustness associated with spirited discussions. Policies made in this manner may result in certain risks being decreased but can also have adverse unintended consequences. Discussion: In the U.S., the FDA's implementation of donor exclusions to prevent possible transfusion transmitted vCJD has reduced the donor base by more than 2%. Given the demographics of the deferred donors, the impact on plateletpheresis donations has been even greater. To compensate for the loss of donors, blood services will have to persuade present donors to donate more frequently, to recruit new donors, or both. One study has indicated that two-thirds of donors have no intention of donating more frequently. New donors have higher rates of infectious disease markers with positivity for HIV and HCV twice as high as repeat donors. Despite sensitive testing techniques, window periods still exist and not all potentially infectious donors will be excluded. Another area of concern is the aggressive use of inducements to attract new donors. Some blood services are offering lavish incentives such as enrolling donors into drawings to win automobiles. Most donors entering the lottery will be low risk; however, it is reasonable to worry that such extreme tactics might also attract persons who should not be donat- Conclusion: (a) Blood donors who were patients' relatives were many more than volunteers as well as more were men than women. Also people of young ages were more than those from older ages. (b) The frequency of the diseases for which the blood units were tested was found to be in low levels in the population of the area. Specifically as concerns HCV, it seems that transmission frequency has been reduced after the obligatory testing of HCV in Blood Transfusion Centres and Stations.

Aims: Considering that, in our region, anti-HCV antibody positivity is variable from 0.87 to 4% of general population, aim of this study has been to evaluate the prevalence of HCV genotypes in blood donors. Methods: In period from May 2003 to December 2004, 83 362 blood units were analyzed by NAT for viral RNA research. NAT has been performed on single sample by TMA technique. On RNA-positive samples, the HCV genotype has been identified by reverse hybridisation with line probe assay.

Analyzing our data, the genotype 1b has resulted the most frequent in blood donors' population, followed by type 2, while the others have showed a very low prevalence. The high frequency of genotype 1 in blood donors is explained by the observation that HCV 1 is usually associated with low ALT levels, for this reason affected subjects may escape to donor's screening only based on dosage of ALT. On the contrary subjects affected by other HCV types, associated with high ALT levels, may be deferred increasing the HCV 1b relative prevalence. At the end, the different distribution of HCV genotypes between men and women and between age's classes probably reflects differences in the pathogenic characteristics of the virus, in the transmission way and in the risk factors. In fact, it has been demonstrated that genotype 1 is principally linked to a not transfusion transmission way; genotype 2 is linked to old age, to female sex and to post-transfusion transmission; genotypes 3 and 4 are associated to young age and to an history of drugs abuse, respectively with high and low viral load; genotypes 5 and 6 are still little known because extremely rare in Europe.

To avoid iron deficiency in blood donors, iron compensation is necessary in most females and males who donate more than 1-2 and 3-4 whole blood units per year, respectively. We present 3 studies dealing with different dose and duration of iron compensation. In the first randomized placebo controlled study iron decreased continuously in males and females at donation intervals of two (males) and three months (females) without iron compensation. 40 mg and 20 mg daily combined with 400 mg ascorbic acid over 2 months (males) or 3 months (females) compensated for iron loss or even overcompensated in females.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods"}, {"text": "In the second open study we reduced iron dose to 20 mg daily over one month for both genders.

A statistical sample was selected using stratified sampling and consisted of 369 women from the district of Limassol (the second largest urban center of Cyprus) between the ages of 19 and 60. Using Linear Logistic Regression, the analysis of the data collected revealed that there is a greater probability for a woman to be a blood donor if she is of a higher educational level, a member of an organized group or association, or if she is acquainted with other blood donors. The percentage of female blood donors is higher in rural areas than in urban centers. 40% of women do not donate blood and attribute their reluctance to do so to health-related problems, while about 25% of those who have never donated blood claim to fear the blood donation procedure. In addition, more than half of the women who have stated they would never donate blood again have attributed their denial to healthrelated problems. The research revealed that there could be an increase of up to 30% of the percentage of female blood donors if they were given time off work for a few hours or one or two days afterwards. Even though very few female blood donors expressed a preference for the blood donation to take place on a particular weekday, half of them prefer the donation to take place on the Discussion: It is about small group of students. The impression is that the altruistic behaviour is present at most of the questioned students. The fact about free school days is not underestimated because it is one of the most important motives of blood donoring of the young population. Families where the blood donoring is a tradition have a great influence for young children because the children in these families are better informed for blood donoring. Conclusion: Including the children in the process of education for young children is of particular importance because the altruistic behaviour as a higher feeling is from an early age of the child and it is under the influence of the environment (family and friends).

Blood donation is surely contraindicated in various pharmacologic therapies, but not in all. In fact a certain degree of discretionarily exists about the assumption, or the period of suspension, relative to a numerous pharmaceutical products, as the antihypertensive agents. According to literature, the deferral of donors taking antihypertensive medication is not indicated when blood pressure is normal, symptoms are absent, and diuretics or similar agents are the only drugs used. On the contrary, it is a common opinion that an antihypertensive therapy by betablockers is not compatible with blood donation for its cardiac effects. Nevertheless, in our daily activity, the observation of a blood donor taking beta-blocking drugs may occur for various causes. A possible error is a superficial pharmacological anamnesis, as it can occur in donations on autohemotheca, for a too fast medical visit (due to a large number of donors), or for the inexperience of the selector (often a not Specialist of Transfusion Medicine young doctor). Another possibility of observation is constitute by patients, undergoing to elective surgery, included in a program of autologous blood donation, suffering hypertension treated with betablockers. In fact, in this last case, the risk/benefit balance justify the blood letting procedure. In the last year we have just observed two severe post-donation reactions in donors suffering hypertension treated with atenolol. The reactions have been similar, in fact both donors showed lypotimia followed by convulsions about past half hour by the end of phlebotomy. No prodromic symptoms have been observer or referred. Cardiac Frequencies (CF) before donation were respectively 60 and 64 beat per minutes and Blood Pressures (BP) were both in the normal range (130/80 and 120/80 mmHg). After donation, during adverse reaction, CF showed no substantial variations, while BP have been decreased respectively to 80/45 and 60/30 mmHg. Immediate treatment has consisted in putting the donors in the Trendeleburg's position and in applying a dolorous stimulation. In the first case this treatment has been sufficient to report the BP to 100/65 mmHg (with disappearing of all symptoms) in only half hour time. In the second one, the marked hypotension showed a very slow remission, for this reason the subministration of a plasma expander needed, with the complete resolution of the symptoms after two hours. These two donors were not deferred from donation because they were periodic donors that had modified their antihypertensive therapy, without referring it neither in the questionnaire nor during anamnesis. Our experience confirms that the blood donation don't must be permitted to subjects taking betablocking antihypertensive drugs. In fact these medications act on cardiac pump decreasing the cardiac rhythm and limiting the postdonation cardiac recover.

Publicity was restricted to a small number of sporadic outbreaks concerted in a limited period of time. Table. Conclusion: Surveillance of adverse reactions and injuries or accidents during or after blood donation is essential for maintaining the well being of active blood donors, as well as for the safety and quality of the donated blood components. Information on other activities and parameters affecting the quality of blood including materials, reagents and equipment should be collected and any serious deviations from standard operating procedures should be notified to the competent authority using haemovigilance infrastructures.

Improvement of existing national haemovigilance systems is expected to follow from the implementation of the EU Directive. Although inevitable, blood donor deferrals lead to losses in donated blood supply and may affect donor-return rates and subsequent blood donations. To estimate the scope of blood donor deferrals and their causes, we analyzed the 2003-2004 data from Regional Blood Centers using standardized criteria for temporary and permanent blood donor deferrals. Within this period (2003) (2004) , 14.6 percent of persons who presented for donation were deferred; 85.9% were temporary deferrals (50% due to laboratory test results, among others low hemoglobin, 6.4% due to risk of acquiring a transfusiontransmissible infection) and 14.1% were permanent (20% due to the infectious diseases markers, 8.7% due to cardiovascular diseases).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1955, "end": 1961, "text": "(2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1962, "end": 1968, "text": "(2004)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 827, "end": 833, "text": "Table.", "ref_id": null}], "section": "P-040"}, {"text": "For Regional Blood Centers the temporary deferral rates varied widely (see the Table below ).

Methods: Many first time Blood donors and especially volunteers think that rejection reasons are permanent and they are completely incapable of donating blood their entire life. This is a 'tragic' misunderstanding since the doctor did not explain that the reason of the rejection is only temporary and in the future this man is capable of donating blood. Those potential donors will never even approach again Blood donation Centre and when in the future they are asked why they do not donate blood, they repeat the cause of the past rejection. Results: One of these rejection reasons is for example low blood pressure (12.54% of total causes of rejection). As we all know blood pressure must be determined according to age, sex, weight and from other factors as sleep, emotional status, food and liquid intake. Therefore blood pressure is very important but should be evaluated with all the above factors and must not be alone the only reason for rejection. Even when one blood donor is rejected it should be made clear to him that this is only temporary and if in the future he is in better physical condition, he could donate blood. In fact 85-90% of those donors rejected for hypotension are readmitted in Blood donation after meeting the above mentioned criteria. Another matter of equal importance is anemia (25.04% of total causes of rejection), especially concerning young women. Since most of those women tend to develop anemia due to depletion of iron stores, they should be advised to donate blood at longer periods than regular, to receive proper medication and diet according to their needs. The doctor must explain the donor the reasons for iron depletion, so Blood donation should not be considered as the only cause for this situation from the donor. There are many factors contributing to anemia, menses, specific diets, overwhelming stress and exercise, not to mention other medical reasons. It is the duty of the doctor to correct those factors that resulted in iron depletion or anemia and readmits those donors in Blood donation in the future (75-80% of those rejected are readmitted in our Centre). Summary/conclusions: At our Blood Centre we have created a program of regular tests (blood tests-physical examination) for all our Blood donors. Our experienced and well taught personnel offers advice and provides useful information in every aspect of Blood donation and more. We have created a friendly environment for all our volunteers with love, understanding and appreciation and believe that this is the only way to keep a constant 'flow' of blood in our region. Introduction: An innovative perception for blood donation in a new and evolving environment must focus on specific matters and ideas and adopt in a certain level lifestyles and concerns of society. Aims: The purpose of this study is to find methods and ideas that can help Blood donation centers throughout our country to create new Blood donors, give a motive and inspiration for Blood donation by adopting new trends of society and finally accomplish national need. Methods: By having a personal interview with many volunteers about their feelings for healthier life, their nutritional habits, daily physical activity, sports, vitamins, smoking, weight, Cholesterol levels. We investigated whether they believe that Blood donation has, if any role towards a more hygienic life. Results: We divided blood donor volunteers according to their age, educational level, and number of blood donations per year. Our results indicated that there is a tendency among young educated people to adopt a personal lifestyle that includes consuming healthier food, keeping their weight low close to the ideal, having some kind of personal activity, not smoking, watching cholesterol levels, following doctors advice and concerning seriously about their health. This dynamic group of blood donor volunteers considers blood donation as a contributing factor to well being and donates blood at specific intervals. Besides the yearly run lab tests that are done by our Blood Centre they also seek advice and discuss any matter concerning their health with the Blood Centre doctor. It appears that they are extremely sensitive in those matters and they seem to appear well informed about issues concerning their health, they also believe that blood donation is part of the plan they have to keep fit and being well. In our blood Centre we encourage this belief and we also provide information concerning this new trend towards healthier habits. Summary/conclusions: This approach has already shown some positive results in our Blood Centre as many people especially young educated women have joined our Blood donorship program and donate blood at scheduled intervals.

Thus, DD should be advised to donate blood regularly as voluntary blood donors. Blood safety depends on a number of factors. The chain of safe blood starts with the donor. One of the procedures for obtaining safe blood for transfusion is the medical selection based on the completed questionnaire and the possibility of self-exclusion from the process of blood donation, the medical history of the potential donor and the medical examination. Donor selection consists of two sets of information necessary for protection of the blood recipient as well as the donor himself. Aim: To present the most frequent reasons for declining volunteer blood donors. Material: The materials used for analysis were the questionnaires completed by all the potential blood donors at the Transfusion Department of the Medical Center in Strumica as well as the record books of the blood donors which contain the results of the analysis we make for the potential donors. These donors donated blood in the period between 2001 and 2003. Results: During this period 4129 people volunteered to donate blood, out of which 3940 were allowed to donate blood, while 189 were declined. Out of the total number of blood donors 3313 were male and 627 female donors. The reasons for declining potential donors were the following: 42.3% had low levels of Hb, 22.36% were taking antibiotics, 9.37% were ill, 7.83% had low blood pressure, 6.75% had high blood pressure, 11.39% for other reasons. Conclusion: Donor selection and their care on one side and obtaining safe blood for transfusion on the other side entails obligatory organized medical control. The obligatory completion of questionnaires, the medical examination of the potential donor and their self-exclusion as a result of the feeling of personal responsibility as well as the obtained information are very important for the selection of quality blood donors and obtaining safe blood for transfusion.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-049"}, {"text": "Questionnaire on 2700 subjects-students, their knowledge and motivation on blood donation F VLADAREANU, A BUGNER and S SIRIAN National Institute of Heamatology Transf, Bucharest, Romania", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-052"}, {"text": "The research theme of this questionnaire is as follows: 'What is the level of knowledge and of motivation in the non-remunerated and voluntary blood donation at students?'

The working profile of the 6 regional blood centers and 22 local blood banks will be changed step by step. Virus screening, blood group serology and processing will be made in the 6 regional centers. One of the regions is the 'North West Transdanubian Region' (NWTR, city Gy\u00f6r as the Center, with about 930 000 inhabitants and 8000 hospital beds). 3 local blood banks (Tatab\u00e1nya, Sopron, and Szombathely) are belonging to NWTR. The regional center and the local blood banks provide the labile blood products and high level clinical-transfusion service (cross-matching, antibody screening, outpatient immunhematology investigations, etc.) for the hospitals. Annually 56 000 donors donate blood in this region. This donation activity covers about the 6% of all inhabitants. The acceptance ratio of the donors is good (6-8% of the donors were deferred). There are 14 hospitals in our region. The regional demand on RBCC is 30-45.000 U/year, on FFP is 5.500-7.000 U/year and on PC is 8-10.000 U/year.

Aims: Our goal was to evaluate the implementation of 2RBC collection in our center in terms of donor recruitment and acceptance, as well as medical staff training and adaptation. Methods: Donors were selected according to the French requirements for 2RBC collection (weight \u2265 65 kg, height \u2265 165 cm, Hb \u2265 13.5 g/dl, ferritin \u2265 20 ng/ml for repeat 2RBC donors). All personnel were trained on adequate communication with donors. Eligible donors were contacted by mail, by phone or during pre-donation interview. Among the 102 recruited donors, all donors were male, 63% were regular whole blood donors, 36% were regular whole blood or apheresis donors and 3% were new donors. The medical staff was trained on 2RBC collection with the SDR protocol and disposable set LN 948PF on the MCS \u00ae +. Most of the medical staff was already used to autologous RBC donation with similar apheresis devices. Blood samples were taken from donors pre-and post-donation, as well as 2 to 4 months later for those returning for a subsequent donation. Donors were asked to fill out a post-donation survey for assessing donor comfort and information. Results: Donor profile and clinical follow-up are summarized in Table 1 . Six percent of the donors had a ferritin level below 20 ng/ml; these donors were regular whole blood donors. The collections were well tolerated and no changes in vital signs were noted. Four reactions were reported: 2 hematomas and 2 citrate reactions. No reaction was observed post-donation and hemoglobin levels measured before next donation were back to normal. The technique was easily implemented by the medical staff and fitted well in the existing blood center processes. The medical staff as well as the donors found collection duration short (average of 35 min). The results of the survey were very favorable as more than 95% of the donors considered their donation and the information they received as satisfying. Most of them agreed to donate again and several actually donated twice during the evaluated period.

There are two reasons for attention to this kind of donors: (1) possible risk of infectious disease in seronegative study; (2) possible risk of donation for person with contraindication. Aim of the study: We investigated role of regional deferred donors registry (RDDR) in by first-time donor selection. Methods: Moscow RDDR includes parts: HIV, viral hepatitis, syphilis, tuberculoses, malaria, drug users, psychiatry, 60 days after blood donation. RDDR was complete and our center began actively work with it since last year. Each donor has to be registered in RDDR and automatically checked for deferral reason. Effectiveness of RDDR was investigated. Results: First-time donors donate less than 10% blood in our center. About a quarter of them are deferred before possible donation. Part of donors deferred by RDDR has been significantly increase in 2003 (c2 = 19.6; P < 0.001) at the expense of seropositive people. Conclusion: RDDR is effective for blood donor selection and decreases necessity in laboratory screening. First-time blood donors have to be examined before blood donation. If they have not contraindications, donation can be performed up to 10 days before examination and screening. The double unite platelet production is important especially if the relatives of patient find the donors. We evaluated the effectiveness two apheresis machine for platelet collection. In our blood bank, one Fenvall Amicus and one CS3000+ apparatus were used for platelet apheresis. 1531 apheresis were performed between 2/12/2002 and 13/2/2005. Including criteria of donors are that estimated process time is smaller than 90 minute and estimated postapheresis platelet count is higher than 100 \u00a5 10 9 /L. Donors firstly was enrolled to amicus. If amicus was busy, then it was enrolled to CS. The properties of our donor populations were given in Blood and plasma cell components are obtained either by traditional manual method from whole blood or by apheresis. Modern medical treatment is based on transfusion of deficient components such as erythrocytes, leukocytes or plasma proteins. This involves new solutions to achieve higher yields and better quality of such components. The aim of our study was to estimate the efficacy of blood cell separator Cobe Trima in obtaining platelet concentrates (PCs) as compared to older-generation Cobe Spectra blood separator. Apheresis procedures were performed on both these blood cell separators. The quality of platelet concentrates was tested during 5 day storage period (see Table below ). We have tested the effect of apheresis procedure on donors and estimated the operating comfort of both separators. The tolerance of both separators was satisfactory except for more frequent hypocalcemia when Trima separator was used. Most donors were more satisfied with Trima procedure because of single venipuncture although it involved special donor selection (good vein access). In general we may say that Trima is undoubtedly a more modern and more friendly separator. However, Cobe Spectra may continue to be used with success especially when a more versatile cell separator is necessary (leukocyte concentrates, peripheral blood stem cells or therapeutic apheresis). Methods and results: TLs (587 procedures on 67 patients) were used successfully in patients with acute or chronic leukemia with hyperleukocytosis (white cell count >100 \u00a5 10E9/L or blast count >50 \u00a5 10E9/L) when high cell count would promote leukostasis with vascular occlusion in the microcirculation.

The aim of our study was the substantiation of plasmapheresis using in complex therapy of purulent inflammatory complications in obstetrics and immunoincompatible pregnancy with hemostasiologic disturbances. 10 patients with hemostasis system disturbances: one woman in childbirth with exacerbation of chronic pyelonephritis, who had in the first 24 hours some signs of hypocoagulation on the background of permissible blood loss (prolonged coagulation time up to 20-30 minutes with episodes of its absence on the background of the normal indexes of general coagulogramm, quantity and function of thrombocytes and the dilute fibrin monomer complex level in 7 times higher than the norm) and nine pregnant women with the perinatal losses in anamnesis severed by the pregnancy (threat of abortion, places of fetal egg detachment). These women were examined, the following was revealed: the high antibody titer to chorionic gonadotropin, parameters of partially activated thrombin time were higher than the norm (47-52 seconds), thrombin time (18-20 seconds), the dilute fibrin monomer complex (8-12 mg%), coagulation time (15-20 min).

Results: There were no significant differences between the groups of donors with respect to age, sex, smoking habits, preapheresis WBC and PLT counts and hemoglobin concentration, as well as in the harvesting time between the two cell separators. Our findings are shown in the following Table. Mildly decreased response to all agonists was observed (mainly to ADP and Arachidonic Acid) in the samples taken right after the initiation of the procedure, in both groups. Platelets from the final component showed a further slight decrease in response to ADP, which was more prominent in the MCS3p device (P = 0.025). On the contrary, an increase in platelet response to the other three agonists was observed in both devices, which, however, was statistically significant upon collagen and ristocetin stimulation. Conclusions: Reduced response to aggregation stimuli is possibly caused immediately with the initiation of the apheresis process. Literature reports regarding further platelet traumatisation due to the procedure, are rather conflicting. In our study, such traumatisation was observed only in the case of ADP in the MCS3p obtained collections and this could be correlated with the technological differences between the two devices. Recovery of platelet aggregability, as it was expressed by the upregulation in platelet response in the other stimuli, could be attributed to the resting period and seems not to be affected by the timing of the leucodepletion procedure.

Plasmapheresis was applied daily in the beginning and continued depending on the condition of the patient ( Table 1) . The eliminated plasma was substituted by fresh frozen plasma. The medium volume was 2.951 mL per apheresis. After day 11 plasmapheresis treatment was suspended to avoid problems with coagulation and was followed by a cycle of 3 immunoabsorptions to eliminate circulating immuncomplexes. Results: Prednisolone therapy alone brought no effect even after changing to high-dose treatment. A significant amelioration of all symptoms could be observed after the first plasmapheresis. Good condition of the patient remained stable over the period of daily plasmapheresis for 4 days. Intermitting apheresis treatment for one day lead to a significant aggravation of symptoms. Apheresis No. 6 again lead to a recovery of the patient which held on until day 11. Conclusions: Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in pregnancy especially in combination with resistance to corticosteroid therapy, is an effective therapy to ease severe symptoms such as polyarthritis, pericarditis and nephritis. Exposure to cytostatic drugs can be avoided and therefore the impairment of the fetus can be reduced.

Despite intensive immunosuppressive therapy some patients are resistant or contraindicated to conventional treatment. In particular circulating antibodies and immune complexes play an important role in the pathogenesis of SLE and MCTD. An extracorporeal removal of these pathological substances may be effective in the treatment of active disease. Methods: Five patients with severe therapy-resistant SLE/MCTD underwent immunoadsorption onto protein A. Blood was drawn from patients by using a jugular catheter or a peripheral intravenous catheter. Anticoagulation was performed with ACD-A and heparine or ACD-A and r-hirudine. Plasma was separated by centrifugation. The 1.5 to 2-fold total plasma volume was treated in every immunoadsorption. The columns were floated with a maximal plasma flow of 20 ml/min. The procedure was carried out every second day. Additionally supplementary intravenous immunglobulin therapy was given only once. Results: Remission of the disease was achieved in four patients. See Table below . Conclusion: PA-IA is highly effective regarding the elimination of autoantibodies and circulating immune complexes, might induce a remission in patients with SLE/MCTD. It is an acceptable alternative treatment option in patients when other therapies are ineffective or contraindicated. Background: Purification of bone marrow from erythrocytes is used to prevent early hemolysis in major ABO incompatible allogeneic hemopoietic cell transplantations. Erythrocyte depletion is strongly recommended to reduce product volume and stem cell purification before storing autologous and even allogeneic bone marrow in order to prevent early hemolysis and DMSO toxicity that might develop after thawing. Centrifugation, sedimentation with HES, and cell separating devices are methods for erythrocytes depletion. Aim: In our center, we prefer to use cell separation device, since it is a reliable method and has a high-yield and risk of contamination with erythrocytes is low. Success of the process is retrospectively analyzed for high and low volumes. Method: Erythrocytes depletion of bone marrow harvest was done in hemapharesis unit with Cobe Spectra device in the last five years in 20 cases with bone marrow volume over 750 ml, and 17 cases with bone marrow volume under 750 ml. Fifteen of these cases were allogeneic, and 22 were autologous procedures; a software uploaded with COBE PBSC coll vers 5.1 and (catalog no: 777-006-000) set was used in the procedure, and at the same time, double bag system with intermediate connectors were used to prevent re-circulation (catalog no: 777-006-300). Results: The mean volume reduction was 90.48% (83.81-93.54) for volumes over 750 ml, and 89.79% (84.03-94.02) for volumes less than 750 ml. Regarding the success of the procedure no statistically significant difference was found between procedures with high and low volumes. No complication developed related to the device or product, and waste bag never had to be re-used. In none of the patients early massive intravascular hemolysis was observed. Conclusion: Erythrocyte depletion and volume reducing with cell separation device is a reliable method.

Therefore, indication for TA often considers interests of patient, hospital and requesting physician. The most respectable guidelines for the implementation of TA were defined by AABB and ASFA, classifying total of 58 diseases into 4 categories (Ctg), ranging from 'standard therapy' to 'lack of efficacy' . The objective of this study was to determine indications for TA performed in 6 Croatian hospitals in the period 2001-2004, respecting AABB/ASFA guidelines. Results: During the observed period in Croatia, TA was performed in 777 patients suffering from 26 various diseases. In 514 (66%) patients TA was performed by membrane filtration, while in 263 (34%) separation by centrifugation was used (Table 1) . According to the 4 Ctg, s of the AABB/ASFA guidelines, TA was performed in 573 (74%) diseases from Ctg I, 126 (17%) Ctg II, 54 (6%) Ctg III, and 25 (3%) Ctg IV of patients. The most frequent indications included in Ctg I were: myasthenia gravis (32%), collection of PBPCs (31%), Sy. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 (17%), and plasmacytoma (6%). In Ctg II frequent indications were: poisonings (35%), systemic lupus erythematodes (30%), and rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis (14%), and in Ctgs III and IV: cytoreduction-polycythaemia (52%), thyroid storm (15%), GVHD (10%), and reumatoid arthritis (8%).

The ATP-Kit were minimized from 3500 ml to a total volume of 200 ml and tests were performed in microtiterplates. Results: 245 samples were analysed in HPLC and modificated commercial testkits, another 20 samples have been examined in all tests. Comparison of the results showed no discrepancies in the above mentioned methods. Standard curves have been performed (range 5-1000 mM ATP) and statistical analysis demonstrated a given linearity (r = 9.97). Variability has been calculated as 1.2% (intraassay; n = 25) and 4.6% (inter-assay; n = 70). The hand-on-time calculated for 96 samples has been decreased from 4.5 hours to 30 minutes. At least the costs of ATP-determination have been reduced from \u20ac3.45 to \u20ac0.22 per sample. Conclusion: Performance of test kits in microtiter format is a fast and rapid method, reliable for high-throughput determination of ATP in packed RBC's. Background: In order to preserve both blood safety and availability it is mandatory that a minimal amount of blood units would be discarded due to defects in the materials and supplies used for blood collection, or to deviations in blood processing or storage. Aims: (1) To monitor the derangements of different materials and disposables used during blood collection and processing, and to study the suppliers' responses and corrective actions taken. (2) To asses the relative contribution of different defective materials (DM) to the need to discard valuable blood components. Materials and methods: About 831 000 whole blood units were collected and processed by MDA National Blood Services in [2002] [2003] [2004] . As part of the routine Quality Control activities, derangements of the DM used were recorded and analyzed. Some 40 different types of DM were defined. Out of 68 reports sent to the corresponding manufacturers for investigation, 45 responses (66%) were received and analyzed. About 70% of DM were detected during blood collection. Manufacturer defects of different materials were the reason for components discard in nearly 25% of cases. Conclusion: Defective Materials are one of the major causes of the infringements of blood collection and blood component preparation processes. Analysis and monitoring of the different defects and of the suppliers' responses and corrective actions are essential to improve products' safety and availability. Establishment of a network for the exchange of information among international blood centers would enable the blood banking community to compare between different suppliers and to use the documented cases for training of personnel of both the blood services and the manufacturers. Such a system may contribute to the improvement in quality of materials used and might lower the discard rate of valuable blood units.

Background: The Vista Information System (Vista TM ) is used in centers in Europe as an apheresis management system. With Vista TM it is possible to increase productivity, donor comfort and loyalty and therefore simultaneously improving the overall process in the center. Aim: A calculation tool (Microsoft Excel) was developed to evaluate the added value of Vista TM . Three Blood Centers in different European countries completed a questionnaire using their local data. Summarizing these figures gives us an idea about the impact of Vista TM on the daily work and budget of a Blood Centre. Method: The Excel calculation tool that was used investigated 3 major areas where Vista TM could show added value: Improvement of regulatory compliance, increase the efficiency in operations and improve productivity. Results: Regulatory Compliance: The number of infringements decreased, causing a considerable direct financial gain because these events are very expensive to deal with. The time spent on regulatory reviews decreased with a mean value of 35%. Operational efficiency: the number of reports is very site dependent: sometimes a report is made for every procedure together with the printout of a blood loss history form. Because Vista TM tracks all procedure related data, some sites decided to stop printing these types of reports and to go completely paperless. The percent time reduction in reporting is therefore very variable. However the % of errors related to these reports decreased considerably with a mean value of 30%. Efficiency in operations was also obtained because of the number of reports that are available in Vista TM . Productivity, management and process reports allow verifying and correcting the daily operations of the blood center. Increased productivity: depending on the center, also an increase in the number of platelet and plasma products collected was detected. The number of product discards caused by infiltration reduced with a mean value of 50%, mainly due to the possibility to have customized and more donor adapted Trima settings. The percentage of whole blood donors targeted for conversion was very site dependent (min 0.5%-max 4%).

Methods: Events in the blood bank were identified by the staff, by internal or external audits and by complaints from the wards. All events were recorded and classified into two categories; quality system and technical. The latter were further classified into preanalytical (sample receipt), analytical (ABO Rh typing, antibody screen and identification, cross matching and phenotyping) and post-analytical (issue of components to wards). All events were graded into 4 levels; 1-most severe, potentially harmful to patient. 2-severe, damage to process and result. 3-moderatly severe, damage to process only. 4-benign, no harm. Events were corrected and effectiveness of corrective actions was assessed by monitoring recurrence of the event.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SM MUDAHI-ORENSTEIN, N MANNY, O ZELIG and Y DAKOSTA Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Cent, Jerusalem, Israel"}, {"text": "Results: During the years 2003-2004, 248 events were detected and recorded in the blood bank, they comprised 0.072% of all tests performed (343 595).

Creating a non-punitive, non-stressing open environment, motivates personnel to identify and document events, which are regarded as opportunities for improvement and serve as important tools for upgrading transfusion safety. The explosive use of information technology and the speed with which it has spread into all life activities has created vulnerabilities for all organizations. Those vulnerabilities are compounded by the complexity of information technology, limited time to market, development constraints, and constantly changing relationships between organizations and suppliers. Growth in the sophistication of security threats makes it imperative that organizations remain equally competent in identifying vulnerabilities and mitigating security risks. Aim: The goal of this document is to explain how ISBT intends to provide guidance to the blood banking community on implementation of effective information security policy. When using information for critical activities, blood banks should consider information security as an important aspect of their management policies. Evaluation of existing standards, such as ISO 17799 and HIPAA, allows us to establish a framework for information security without regard to the type of organization. It remains very difficult however, due to the complexities involved, to establish an information security policy without guidance. Method: The ISBT information task force was created to provide guidelines on information security for blood banking organizations of all sizes. The intent is to help them understand existing standards as well as provide tools for implementing information security policy. These guidelines are based on existing standards that are followed by most worldwide countries: ISO 17999 and HIPAA. Results: Information security can be defined as the 'protection of systems, information and services from accidental and deliberate threats to confidentiality, integrity and availability' .

Red blood cells stored in blood banks, normally undergo a series of chemical alterations, or storage lesions. The ultimate consequence of these lesions is a decrease in the viability of the red cells following transfusion. The chemical alterations are mainly changes in levels of Na+, K+, Cl-concentrations, pH and 2,3 DPG levels and they affect the electrical impedance of blood. The electrical impedance, Cole-Cole parameters, is determined mainly by the resistance of the red cell extracellular fluid (Re), the resistance of the intracellular fluid (Ri) and the capacitance of the cell membranes (Cm).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "In this study we aimed to investigate the relation between blood parameters and electrical impedance changes, and their further clinical implication. All parameters were measured on 51 erythrocyte suspension (ES) samples during 42 days of storage at 4oC on days 0, 10, 21, 35 and 42. For 31 whole blood (WB) samples during 21 days of storage, same parameters were measured on days 0, 10, and 21. The measurement of the complex impedance of blood samples were performed in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 1 MHz. By using the 4284A HP LCR Meter, the impedance Z, and the phase angle a for each sample were read. These values were corrected according to the gain and phase characteristics of the amplifier; and the resistance R and the reactance X were calculated. Each data was first fit to the Cole-Cole model; hence the Cole-Cole parameters, intracellular resistance Ri, extracellular resistance Re, characteristic frequency Fc and phase angle a were obtained by using LMS software. Afterwards, Cm was calculated by using Ri, Re, a and Fc. Whereas Ri and Cm decreased progressively with time on both WB and ES, Re changes showed some differences. The electrical impedance alterations were explained by measurements of Na+, K+, Clconcentrations, pH and 2,3 DPG by indicating days. Storage of red cells resulted in a rise in extracellular K+ and a fall in extracellular Na+, Cl-, pH and 2,3 DPG. ANOVA was used to evaluate differences in blood measures in relation to storage time. The results were presented as the mean \u00b1 SD. According to the regression analysis in SPSS, the intracellular resistance (Ri) on both ES and WB was affected more efficiently from all blood parameters among all other electrical parameters. Although Ri and Re were correlated with Na+, K+, Cl-, pH and 2,3 DPG more significantly, Cm measurements were failed to show correlations with blood parameters because of the intervening parameters, a and Fc. The best relationship between the parameters mentioned above on both ES and WB was Ri and K+. pH changes were the same for Ri and Re both for ES and WB. The correlation between parameters on ES was better than those on WB, because whole blood consists of several particles that may affect our measurements.

During cardiac surgery pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines are released by different mechanisms. We found in a randomized trial in cardiac surgery a significant reduction in infections and mortality due to MODS by transfusion of leukocytedepleted erythrocyte concentrates (LD) compared to leukocyte-containing, buffy-coat depleted erythrocytes (PC). Aim of the study: The effect of LD on the concentration of proinflammatory cytokine Il-12 and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in relation to clinical outcome and complications after cardiac surgery. Methods: In 474 participating patients blood samples were taken before and after surgery. Using ELISA IL-10 and IL-12 were measured in these samples.

Aim: To define the incidence of anemia and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion practice in critically ill patients in the ICU) of our hospital, and to examine the relationship of anemia and RBC transfusion to clinical outcome. Patients and methods: The period study was from July 2003 to December 2004. Patients were enrolled within 48 h of ICU admission. Follow-up time was 30 days, hospital discharge or death, whichever occurred first. Results: A total of 169 patients (116 male, 53 female, mean age 57.6 \u00b1 21.1 years, range 15-96) were included in the study. The mean hemoglobin (Hb) level at baseline was 11.2 \u00b1 2.1, which level was descending during the study. Overall 63.9% (108/169) of the patients received one or more RBC units while in the ICU stay (mean 3.1 \u00b1 3.8 units per patients). The mean pretransfusion Hb was 8.7 \u00b1 1.8 g/dl and the mean time to first ICU transfusion was 2.6 \u00b1 4.1 days. More RBC transfusions were given in the first week of the ICU stay (331 units vs 110, 61, 36 units in the second, third and forth week respectively). The number of RBC units which a patient received during the study was positive associated with longer ICU length of stay and an increase in mortality (r = 0.19, P < 0.05 and r = 0.26, P < 0.05 respectively). Baseline Hb level was significantly related to the number of RBC transfusion (r = 0.55, P < 0.001), but was not an independent predictor risk factor of length of stay or mortality (r = 0.16, P > 0.05 and r = 0.13, P > 0.05 respectively).

Conclusions: Anemia is common in the critically ill patients, it appears early in the ICU course and persists throughout the duration of the ICU stay. RBC transfusion seems to be associated with worse clinical outcome.

The aim of our study was to analyze transfusion practice at UUH with specific focus on trauma. Materials and methods: Blood consumption during this period was recorded. Clinical data of trauma patients were collected from our Trauma Registry and anonymized before analysis. Results: 7012 units of erythrocytes (ER), 914 of thrombocytes (THR) (buffy coat preparations from 4 donors) and 903 of S/D-treated whole plasma (OP) (Octaplas\u00d2) were transfused in UUH during this period. 56.6% of ER were given to surgical, 21.3% to medical and 12.2% to gynaecological and obstetric patients. 62% of ER were given to patients above 45 years. ER units were given to 1475 patients (mean 4.75 units/patient; range 1-63). Mean age of trauma patients was 33 \u00b1 18, median 30, range 1-89 years. For transfusion of this group local guidelines state that haemodynamically unstable patients should receive ER if hgb <9 g/dl, irrespective of age and sex. Eighty-eight patients (27.8%) received ER, 15 of them as massive transfusion ( 3 10 ER units in <24 hours) (17.0%), 6 of these died (40%). Altogether trauma patients received 851 units of ER (12.1% of total UUH consumption), 51.5 THR (6.1% of total) and 150 units of OP (16.5% of total). Massive transfusion consumed 340 ER (40%), 29.5 THR (57.3%) and 110 OP (73.3%) units. Fourteen adult trauma patients (15.9% of those transfused) received 1 or 2 ER units only. Lowest pre-transfusion hgb was 3.3-11.3 g/dl, median 7.6, mean 7.5 \u00b1 1; highest post-transfusion hgb 7.8-14.3 g/dl, median 9.5, mean 9.8 \u00b1 1.

Fifty-five% of issued ER units had been stored for >15 days, while only 10% were issued before 10 days of storage. Discussion: Life-saving effect of transfusion would seem evident in the massively transfused survivors, while in the other transfused patients documentation of clinical effect is inadequate. Transfusion practice in trauma at UUH seems fairly well in accordance with internationally accepted guidelines. The trauma unit consumed a surprisingly small part of total UUH transfusion resources. Trauma patients deviate from the general UUH patient population by sex and age; transfusion is otherwise mainly given to more elderly patients. Further analysis is needed on transfusion indications and results to optimize the total use of blood products in UUH.

Blood transfusion occurred in 125 patients (75.8%), (45-69% in other studies) with a mean of 2.38 units per patient (range 1-10 units), (1.47-2.6 in other studies).

Aims: We have reviewed the FFP transfusion practices followed in our hospital in an attempt to provide a set of guidelines and principles that will assist physicians and health care workers to make the right decisions for appropriate use of FFP transfusions. Methods: Retrospective review of FFP transfusions practices during the entire year of 2004. We classified transfusion practices according to the diagnosis of the patient and also of the Clinical depart-ment that demanded transfusion. Then we analyzed our results by comparing the requests with the internationally approved guidelines for FFP transfusion and counted the percentage of FFP to RBC units. Finally we discussed with our fellow physicians the proper use of FFP and informed them about the accepted guidelines. As we can see from the underneath table, diagnoses and departments with high consumption were: Internal Medicine 22%, Plasmapheresis to patients suffering from Guillain Barre and TTP (Thrombotic Thrombopenic purpura) 21.04% and Trauma/Surgery 20.68%, Cancer 13.60%. Summary/conclusions: The use of FFP corresponds to 27.88% of the RBC units transfused in our hospital. Plasma units should be used properly and according to internationally accepted standards.

Methods: Data of WB and RBC use from 1982 to 2004 in our hospital. Results: Our data are presented in Table 1 . Conclusion: After 1982, WB usage rates systematically decreased from 51% to 1.3%. However, in the period of 1991-2004, the WB usage rates increased slightly, and we arrived at a generally very low rate of WB use, namely only in about 3% of the cases. Education about transfusion medicine and rational use of blood in the medical curriculum was generally insufficient and very poor. Therefore, we started an education program and we established a Hospital Transfusion Committee (HTC) with the task of medical control and monitoring the quality of clinical transfusion practice in our hospital. Members of the HTC are a specialist in transfusion medicine, an internal medicine specialist, an anesthesiologist, surgeon and gynecologist. We have been organizing courses for the medical staff, doctors and medical technicians since 1995. Background: platelet transfusions are given mainly to thrombocytopenic patients with malignant haematological diseases. Currently the decision to give a prophylactic platelet transfusion is based almost exclusively on the number of circulating platelets in the patient although it is known that various clinical factors might influence the bleeding tendency. By free oscillating rheometry (FOR), using a ReoRox\u00ae 4 instrument, it is possible to monitor the coagulation over time in whole blood and obtain information about clotting time and coagulum elasticity. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to find out if FOR using the ReoRox\u00ae 4 instrument could be used to evaluate the hemostatic status of thrombocytopenic patients. Methods: The change in elasticity over time in non-anticoagulated whole blood from leukaemia/lymphoma patients with thrombocytopenia was measured in the ReoRox\u00ae 4 pre and post a platelet transfusion (n = 10) and was compared with healthy controls (n = 40). The effect of platelet concentration on coagulation was studied by diluting platelet rich plasma from healthy subjects with autologous plasma to various platelet counts whereafter the coagulation was monitored with FOR (n = 8). The change in elasticity per minute (G'max slope) and maximum elasticity (G'max) were evaluated from the elasticity curves. Results: The G'max, G'max slope and platelet count increased after transfusion for all patients. The thrombocytopenic patients had significantly lower G'max and G'max slope values both pre and post transfusion compared with healthy control subjects (P < 0.01). The measurement in platelet rich plasma showed that G'max and G'max slope increased with increasing platelet concentration.

Conclusion: During seven years period the use of blood components per patient in cardiosurgery was not diminished. For more rational use it is necessary to apply all methods of autologous blood transfusion because of the increasing number of cardiac operations and decreased number of voluntary blood donors. Background: The presence of leucocytes in blood components is cause for appearance of various adverse posttransfusion reactions such as NHFPTRs, urticary, anaphylactic shock, alloimunization and platelet refractorines, infection with bacteria and leucothropyc viruses (CMV, HTLV). The removal of leucocytes from blood components through filtration is especially important in the treatment of patients with malignant diseases who need frequent transfusions of blood and blood components. This is because of their lowered immunologic status which is a result of the disease and received immunosuppressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Aim: To show the prevention of posttransfusion reactions and the positive effect from transfusion of leucoreduced Er.

Methods: 123 patients with malignant diseases have been treated in our Daily transfusion hospital in the last four years. Most of these patients suffer from Ca pulmonum, Ca collonis, Ca uteri, Ca mammae. Also, because of the secondary anaemia, the same patients were transfunded with at least two doses of leucoreduced Er. concentrates. The blood donored by voluntary repeated blood donors was filtrated the same day after the donation, separation and the control of the same one. The blood was collected in Baxter and Terumo bags, and it was filtrated with Baxter -Sepacell RS -2000 and Pall -purecell RN filters. The analyses of leucoreduction were made for every filtrated and transfunded unit before and after filtration. The analyses samples were taken from the tubing system before and after the filter. Haemathologic parameters were automatically made in the Central Clinic Laboratory. Results: Er. concentrates poor with the leucocytes for about 98-99.9% were produced with the use od these filters, and platelets from 88-100% with which side effects from frequent transfusions at these patients were prevented.

In November 2004 a questionnaire was distributed to determine the criteria used for selecting phenotyped blood for different patient groups, including pre-menopausal women (PMFs). Results were analysed by country to establish any variation in practice relating to the selection of K negative (K-) and Rhc negative (c-) blood, since antibodies to these antigens are now the major cause of HDN. Results: Overall return rate was 84% (UK) and 64% (non-UK), although only centres treating PMFs were included in this analysis. K-blood was selected for PMFs by 81% in Wales (n = 16) and 71% in England (n = 291), but only 6% in Scotland (n = 32), 8% in Northern Ireland (n = 12) and 10% in Eire (n = 31). In mainland Europe, variation was also observed: 12% in Denmark (n = 17), 75% in Portugal (n = 20) and 85% in other countries (n = 27 from 10 countries). Fewer laboratories selected c-blood for PMFs: 8% in England and Northern Ireland, 0% in Scotland and Eire, rising to 81% in Wales. Mainland Europe showed similar variation: 12% in Denmark, 75% in Portugal (all CcEe matched) and 51% in other countries. There are no guidelines requiring selection of K-and c-blood for PMFs, but in the UK D negative blood is required for D negative females aged <60 years. Trend analysis of questionnaire data in the UK, using theoretical clinical scenarios, shows a decrease in the number of laboratories that would select K + blood for a 30 year old female (with pre-existing antibodies other than anti-K), from 58% (1996), 42% (1999) to 26% in 2004. In this survey, K + blood was selected for a female aged 30 (no antibodies) by 31%, whilst 81% selected a K + unit for a female aged 54 (no antibodies), despite this patient being treated as a PMF for provision of D negative blood. A similar distinction was made between the 30 and 54 year old females in Portugal and mainland Europe. Conclusions: Variation in practice may at least in part be due to the availability of blood routinely labelled for Rh and K. In the UK all donations are labelled, except for those from new donors, as are most units in Portugal. UK questionnaire data (1999) suggested that >50% laboratories would change to selecting K-blood for PMFs if all units were labelled. However, labelling alone does not account for the differences seen within the UK, and perhaps the trend towards providing K-(and to a lesser extent c-) blood for PMFs is influenced by advice from transfusion services. It would be of great interest to monitor and compare the incidence of HDN due to anti-K and anti-c in different countries to measure the outcome of differing practices for provision of blood to PMFs and to thereby inform future policy.

Aim: We report here a 'probable' case of TRALI syndrome in an elderly female patient. Case presentation: An eighty-two year old female patient was transferred to the intensive care unit on the third postoperative day (POD) following the abrupt onset of acute pulmonary insufficiency (paO 2 = 49 mmHg, O 2 saturation = 79%), hypotension (BP = 90/50 mmHg) and fever (38\u00b0C). This occurred ten minutes after initiation of an infusion of a unit of packed red blood cells (PRC). The patient had no history of any cardiac or pulmonary disease. She was intubated and placed on mechanical respiration and supported hemodynamically. The CVP (12 cm H 2 O) ruled out fluid overload. The chest X-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary oedema, the ECHO cardiogram and blood cultures ruled out cardiac and infectious aetiology of the episode. After treatment for 48 hours the patient improved significantly, was extubated and returned to the surgical unit on the 6th POD. Reviewing the transfusion history we discovered that the patient did not receive any blood or blood component prior or during the correction of her ileum, but she was transfused a unit of FFP (fresh frozen plasma) five hours prior to the incident. The donor review revealed that the unit of FFP was from a 29-year old female with a history of multiple abortions whereas the PRC unit was from a 52-year old male, a volunteer of several years who had no history of transfusions. There are some prerequisites for the implementation of a haemovigilance network and some of them have been met, so we can present the first results. Methods: Traceability of blood components is possible because there is unique information system in place in the whole country, identifying the donor, donation, each single blood component and identification of the recipient, but feed back information of the performed transfusion is still missing. Cooperation between blood transfusion service and hospitals was established by introduction of hospital transfusion committees; the intensity and quality of their work is very different. Homogeneity of reporting is achieved by the introduction of unique reporting form. A reporting route was defined: patients physician sends notification of ATR to the local blood transfusion service. ATR reporting form is prepared there and sent to the national blood transfusion service, where the data is collected for the Centre for haemovigilance, which is going to be established very soon. Data analysis will be responsibility of the Centre for haemovigilance at the governmental level. Type of adverse transfusion reactions and events is defined. Education and information was passed to the health personnel by inclusion of haemovigilance in under and postgraduate programmes as well as seminars, scientific meetings and some publications. Results: In the years 2002-2004 there were 410.000 blood components issued in Slovenia and 333 ATRs were reported (1 in 1232 blood components issued), in 25 of them the severity grade was 2 (1 in 16.412 blood components issued). In the year 2004 there were considerable differences between the number of ATR reports compared to the number of blood components issued among Slovenian hospitals, ranging from 1 in 3375 to 1 ATR in 490 blood components issued. 9.6% of all ATR were not classified. Conclusions: Although the number of reported ATRs was increased by 24% and 31% a year in 2003 and 2004 respectively, it can be assumed that the collected data is not complete. Feed back reports, much more information and cooperation is needed, especially in some hospitals, which should contribute to a better registration of ATRs and events in the future. The Slovenian haemovigilance system still needs upgrading, but despite this, some important work has been done in building a national haemovigilance system. . Considering the multiplicity groups in cattle and since there was no research on repeated blood transfusions reactions in Iran's native cattle, we decided to consider crossmatching in different processes of repeated blood transfusion from a head of blood donor to five recipients and observe the clinical and hematological alterations. Six healthy Iran's native cow, 2.5 years old, with average weight of 210 kg were used. The animals were dewormed by albendazole (15 my/kg bw) and were kept for two weeks under uniform managemental condition. Three days prior to blood transfusion, vital signs registration (temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate) blood collection via jugular vein was done to indicate the baseline of research parameters. After that, blood transfusions were performed from one donor cow to five recipients three times at one-week intervals. Cross matching was done at each transfusion. After each transfusion the research parameters do determined. Results indicated that one of the recipients cows experienced anaphylactic shock, in the first step of blood transfusion and another cows in the second step and finally in the third steps two other cows showed the serious shock. This is in the contrary of this opinion that the first transfusion can be given safely without crossmatching in cattle practice ( Van der Valt, et al. (1969) Background and objectives: Blood transfusion may lead to the manifestation of anti-HLA and platelet-specific antibodies that may in turn bring about different problems like platelet refractoriness. It appears that the study of antibodies against HLA-Class I and platelet-specific antigens are useful for the selection and success of the appropriate treatment protocol. The aim of this study was to detect anti-HLA and anti-platelet-specific antibodies by flowcytometry in patients with hematologic disorders (including Acute Leukemia, Aplastic Anemia) and patients with ITP.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 5336, "end": 5363, "text": "Van der Valt, et al.

In this condition, the patient's own platelets are destroyed by the alloantibody even though they are not supposed to carry the 'guilty ' antigen. The disease is rare occurring mainly in multiparous women. The majority of reported cases involved antibodies against the platelet specific alloantigen HPA-1a in a homozygous HPA-1b patient. In a minority of cases the offending antibodies were directed against HPA-1b, -3a, -3b, 4a, -5a, -5b. Although self-limiting, the syndrome is characterized by severe bleeding with high morbidity and mortality; therefore prompt diagnosis and appropriate therapy is crucially important. PTP is a challenging diagnosis, because the patients are often critically ill or post-surgery, and have alternative explanations for thrombocytopenia such as infections or drugs. We present three patients with severe thrombocytopenia initially misdiagnosed. The first patient, a 54-year old women, had a past history of systemic lupus erythematosus and Coombs positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia. At the present hospitalization, after antibiotic therapy for endocarditis, a severe hemolytic episode occurred and she need blood transfusion. When severe thrombocytopenia appeared, she was wrongly diagnosed as Evans syndrome. The second patient, a 73-year old man, suffered from sepsis after vascular surgery and revealed clinical and laboratory picture of DIC. The third patient, a 58-year old women, had end-stage renal failure and received heparin during hemodialysis, thus heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was first suspected. History of recent blood transfusion rose the suspicion of PTP in all this cases, and appropriate therapy with high dose IV immunoglobulin was started. Adequate laboratory work-up confirmed the diagnosis. Three different anti HPA-antibodies were identified: anti HPA-3a, anti HPA-1b and anti HPA-3b, respectively. The platelets genotype of the first patient was HPA-3b/3b, of the second HPA-1a/1a and of the third patient, HPA-3a/3a.

This information is important in order to learn about the residual infection risk in blood recipients. Aim: To summarize the data on reported cases of PTH. Methods: Suspected cases of PTH are reported to MDA Blood Services. The investigation procedure includes follow up testing of implicated donors and retesting of an archive sample of the transfused unit, if available. Donors involved in suspected PTH-B are tested for HBsAg and anti-HBc. Anti-HBc+ donors are tested for anti-HBs. HBV-DNA testing is done if anti-HBs is less than 10 mIU/ml. Donors involved in suspected PTH-C, are tested for anti-HCV and ALT. Since 2000 HCV-Ag or HCV-RNA are performed, when appropriate. Investigation is considered complete if all the involved donors are retested >6 months following the implicated unit. Results: Between 1993 Between -2004 suspected PTH cases were reported: 74 (57%) were PTH-B, 54 were PTH-C (42%) and in 1 patient both HBV and HCV infections were reported. Investigation was completed in 53/129 (41%) cases, with 70% of the involved donors (1222/1749) being retested >6 months after the implicated donation. HBsAg was not detected in any of the 773 retested donors. Anti-HBc was detected in 26 donors involved in 7 PTH-B cases of which 21 were also positive for Anti-HBs. PCR for the detection of HBV-DNA was performed on the 5 'anti-HBc+ only' donors, and none was found positive. Only in 1/449 donors suspected to be involved in PT-HCV, Anti-HCV antibodies were subsequently detected. This donation was collected and transfused before the introduction of anti-HCV testing in Israel, which was implemented in 1991. In another PTH-C case, the implicated donor is still negative for anti-HCV, in follow up samples of up to 28 months, but was found positive for HCV-Ag and HCV-RNA. PTH investigation of all the donors involved was completed in 49% (52/105) of the cases where the patient received up to 10 blood components. Conclusion: In the past 12 years an average of 11 cases/year of suspected PTH were reported to the Israeli national blood services. Investigation was completed in 41% of the reported cases. So far, there was no clear evidence of HBV transmission. In 2 cases (out of 2.99 million blood units collected nationwide during 1993-2004) HCV seemed to be associated with blood transfusion: One caseprior to the implementation of anti-HCV testing and the otherprior to the implementation of HCV-Ag testing in a donor that did not develop anti-HCV antibodies.

The cumulative number of HCV infected donors was 68, with 54 cases in males and 14 cases in females. Most infections were found among older persons (32% were aged 22-39, and 68% aged 40-59). The seropositivity was higher in family/replacement donors (63%) than in volunteers (37%). The annual prevalence decreased throughout years. The relative importance of risk factors for Hepatitis C was: Transfusion 10%, hospitalization 8%, immigrants 8%, occupational 5%, Sexual Transmission 6%, injection drug use 3%, household contacts 5%, other 3%, tattooing 2%, unknown 50%. According to the criteria for blood donation, certain donors should have been excluded in the predonation interview but these donors had denied risky behaviour when questioned. The importance of sexual activity in the transmission of HCV has not been well-established as we tested 30 sexual partners and 14 family members and none of them was found positive. Conclusions: Our results suggest that major improvement in the safety and quality of our blood supply has been made in our area. Introduction: Apart from immuno-haematological complications, blood transfusion recipients are exposed to the risk of viral and bacterial contamination of donor blood. The latter infectious risks are generally associated with the number of donations that are needed in the production of blood products: the pooling effect. One measure recently being discussed is the generalisation of the use of trombocytapheresis for the production of trombocyte concentrates. Normally, the trombocyte product is a concentration of trombocyte extractions from a pool of 5 buffy coats: pooled platelet concentrates (PPC). In case of trombocytapheresis sufficient trombocytes for one transfusion can be collected from one single donor. Aim of the study: In this presentation the effect of using 100% trombocytapheresis for the production of single donor platelets (SDP) instead of pooled platelet concentrates (PPC) on contamination risks will be assessed. These risks can be divided in 1) the risk of bacterial contamination, 2) the risk of viral contamination (e.g. HCV, HBV, HIV) resulting from window period donations, and 3) the risk of contamination with TSE or emerging infections for which no screening test exists.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "The contamination probability of SDP versus PPC is assessed on the basis of the production characteristics of both products, e.g. the presumption that the contamination risk per trombocyte product will be reduced by a factor equal to the number of pooled donations (five in our case). Reduction of the bacterial contamination risk was estimated using the results of the bacterial testing of pooled and apheresis platelet products. As patients are likely to obtain multiple blood products during treatment, the contamination risk reduction through SDP is not only dependent on the reduction of risk in trombocyte products, but also will also dependent on the total number of blood products transfused and their associated contamination risks. The platelet recipient risk reduction was calculated on basis of the distribution of blood products received by the patient population of the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU) in the year 2001. Results: In the attached table the estimated risk reduction through 100% trombocytapheresis is shown for the general blood recipient patient and for the trombocyte recipient patients only. Our analysis indicate that in platelet recipients, general application of SDP instead of PPC will reduce the risk for transfusion acquired TSE infections by 49%, the risk of known viral infections by 56%, and transfusion acquired bacterial infections by 59%. The confidence intervals surrounding the results were obtained by bootstrapping. The large confidence intervals surrounding the reduction of bacterial infection risk is caused by the fact that only a limited set of 4300 apheresis trombocyte products were tested. Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that general application of SDP instead of PPC will not reduce the risk of transmitting infections to platelet recipients as linearly (1 : 5) as expected. Whether it is a costeffective precautionary measure will have to be evaluated by a costbenefit analyses consideration clinical benefits and additional costs and risks of apheresis donations. Introduction: Hepatitis B is serious health problem world wide. Its prevention, particularly in the population of blood donors is essential for providing good health care and protection. Aim: The aim of this study is to present the distribution of HbsAg(+) and HBsAg(-) blood donors according to their profession. Methods: Specially designed questionnaires are used for interviewing the blood donors who has previously given signed consent for participation in this study. Results: Table 1 shows the distribution of the blood donors in different professions. Administrative clerks with 43 (34.12%) and the workers with 40 (31.73%) registered in the group of HBsAg(+) blood donors, as well as workers with 50 (50%) and administrative clerks with 30 (30%) from the HBsAg(-) group of blood donors are dominantly more frequent than the other categories of professions. Health care professionals, housewives and farmers in both groups of blood donors are least frequent. Taking in consideration the distribution of blood donors by the given professions in both groups, for U = 21 and P > 0.05 there is no significant difference found. The analysis of the differences among the different frequencies, in distribution of blood donors according the profession, for D = 0.436 and P < 0.05 shows a significant difference, where the workers with 90 (39.82%) are the most dominantly represented. In relation to the issue of whether the type of profession of the blood donors is production or non production the results are presented on Table 2 . In the group of HbsAg(+) blood donors the number of those who work in production profession-92 (73.01%), is dominant over the number of those that has non-production profession-34 (26.98%). In the group of HBsAg(-) blood donors there is no significant difference between the types of professions. Conclusion: Having in consideration the professions of blood donors in both groups, for c 2 = 14.8 and P < 0.01 there is a significant difference in the presented distribution. According to our study, which shows the horizontal transmission of HBV infection in the family in which there is an index case, the biggest number of participants in the study is workers, and the least number of participants are the farmers. Introduction: Blood donors, as part of the healthy population are tested for HBsAg with each blood unit they give. Therefore, they can be an epidemiological model for exploring the appearance of HBV infection in general population.

In the HBsAg(-) group 64 (64%) donors that live in a flat dominate compared to 36 (36%) of those that live in a house. Having in consideration the presented distribution (Table 10) for c 2 = 3.96 and P < 0.05 there is a significant difference, that comes from the bigger number of blood donors (128) that live in flat. As for the distribution of blood donors according the living space they use by member of the family (Table 2) , we can show that 24 (19.04%) of the HBsAg(+) donors have less than 10 m 2 living space, in compared to 5 (5%) from the HBsAg(-) group. The bigger number of HBsAg(+) blood donors with small living space gives bigger possibility for transmission of HBV infection in the family. The differences in the two groups for donors that have between 10 and 30 m 2 , and between 31 and 40 m 2 of living space per person, obviously are not very big. For U = 19 and P > 0.05 there is no significant difference in the number of the donors in the two groups, when the available living space in m 2 is discussed. Introduction: When one of the sexual partners has HBV infection the other is also infected in 1 from 3 cases. Aim: The aim of this study is to outline that the risk from transmission of HBV infection between sexual partners is smaller if they use condom as protection. Methods: Two groups of blood donors-HBsAg(+) and HBsAg(-) have been interviewed whether they are using condoms as protection, or not. Results: Table1 shows the distribution of blood donors concerning the use of condoms. Table1: In the group of HBsAg(+) blood donors those who have not used condoms dominate with number of 81 (64.28%), in compared to those 45 (35.71%) who used condoms. These data are in favor of eventually possible sexual transmission of HBV infection in HBsAg(+) blood donors. In the group of HBsAg(-) blood donors dominate those who have used condom-57 (57%), compared to 43 (43%) who have not. The given distribution of blood donors concerning the use of condoms for c 2 = 10.2 and P < 0.01, shows significant difference, which is due to the prevailing of the number of blood donors (124), who have not used condom. of Er -concentrates are leukodepleted. The choice of bacteriological control of empty bags for blood, bags with Er -concentrates in additive solution, universal and iso group plasma, as well as the systems for taking of blood are taken on free choice. The control of the erytrocyte concentrates is performed on the first day after the preservation and dekanting, and again between the 15th-21st day and 30th-35th day after the preservation. The pulled plasma is controlled on the day of pouring (spreading), and the control of the iso group plasma on the day of deplasming. Three months later the iso group and the universal plasma kept on the temperature of -30\u00b0C is bacteriologically controlled again. Bacteriological control is performed with standard procedures in the Institute for health protection in Stip. The transfusion transmitted infections are potentially dangerous complications of transfusion therapy in immunocompromised patients. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of transmissible infections in blood donor population in Kashan, Iran. A total of 600 consecutive sera were tested for CMV-IgM antibody, HBsAg, Hepatitis B core (HBc) antibody, Hepatitis C (HCV) antibody, and HIV antibody with standard methods. Of the sera tested, 14 specimens (2.3%) were CMV-IgM positive. The frequency of seropositive revealed no significant differences between male and female donors. The frequency rates of CMV-IgM seropositive tests tend to decline with increasing the age. There was no relation between the frequency rates of CMV-IgM seropositive with the educational level, socioeconomic status, marital status, urban dweller and rural resident patients. The prevalence of HBV, HCV, and HIV antibody were 0.5%, 0.5%, and 0%, respectively. These findings implied important clinical applications because detection of CMV positive sera may reduce the risk for transmission of CMV in blood transfusion and thereby decrease the risk on CMV-induced complications. Introduction: The worlds problem, AIDS, steel can't be said that is a problem in these three centers in R. Macedonia, in which blood is collected, controlled, and distributed. found negative and 5 of them were found positive for one of the three viruses (HIV-1, HCV, HBV). With the ELISA/AXSYM assay 29 of the 992 blood units which were negative by the Procleix Ultrio assay were positive for anti-HbcAg and negative for anti-HbsAg and HbsAg. From those 29 blood units 23 units were given for transfusion following our Blood Centre protocol and the remaining 6 units were discarded. The protocol consists of a good medical history, liver enzymes (AST, ALT, gGT). We must take into consideration that from those 5 that were found positive by the Procleix Ultrio assay 1 was positive for anti-HCV and 4 were positive for anti-HbsAg. Summary/conclusions: Despite the fact of the short period of time we perform this method, the ability of the NAT technique for rapid use, reliability and sensitivity in detecting three viruses simultaneously, indicates the need for immediate use in Blood donation as a screening method.

Aim of the study: To assess the prevalence of bacterial contamination of standard platelet units from whole blood, and to provide evidence that with the use of bacterial culturing it is feasible to extend the self life of platelets to 7 days. Materials and methods: Eligible blood donors were bled according to standard operating procedures used in Greece. PLT were prepared from whole blood, solely for the purpose of the present study, by the platelet-rich plasma method. PLTs were stored for up to 7 days at 20 to 24\u00b0C with end-over-end agitation. Other 111 PLTs prepared from blood collected in triple-pack container system also provided with a predonation sampling device were also tested. PLTs were sampled in the bacteriology laboratory. PLTs were sampled on day 2, 5 and 7. Both aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles were inoculated with a 7-mL platelet sample. Culture bottles were incubated at 35\u00b0C in an automated microbe -detection system (BacT/Alert system) until a positive reaction was detected or for 10 days. All samples that were reactive were confirmed by routine culture. Each reactive sample with bacteria growth on the routine culture was sub cultured for identification of the bacteria. Results: A total of 1889 PLT concentrates were cultured and bacterial contamination was assessed in each unit at day 2, 5 and 7 after collection. On of storage day 2 two out of 1889 (0.1%) PLT units were found to be positive for bacterial growth. 7 cases of unconfirmed positive results were noted at the beginning of the study. Out of the other 1887 units which were negative on day 2 and continued to be cultured for the next days, the assessment at day 5 found no other positive. After further storage, at day 7, defined as the end of the prolonged incubation period, 5 out of the 1887 PLT concentrates (0.26%) grew bacteria although testing of the same units on day 2 and 5 gave no signal. From the 111 platelets units that were prepared from blood collected with a predonation sampling device, none of the PLT concentrates gave a positive signal although 3 pouches were found to be positive, and subculture showed bacterial growth of Coagulase -negative staphylococcus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-173 Bacterial monitoring of platelets -is the extension of selflife feasible K STAMOULIS, M PETROULA, A SDRAKA, I DRAKOU, H FAITAKI, G DEGGIANAKI, I KATRAMADOS, S VLACHAKOU and E ECONOMOU-PETERSEN NCPBP E.Politis, Nikea, Greece"}, {"text": "Despite the relative small number of tested platelet concentrate units, our findings discourage specialists in attempting platelet storage time prolongation to 7 days.

In view of the high infectivity of HIV positive blood, it is important not only to screen donated blood but also to exclude donations from high-risk individuals, such as males who have engaged in homosexual activity and intravenous drug users. A careful history should identify those who should not give blood. In Turkey, among blood donors the average HBsAg prevalence in 1985-1998 was 5.1%.

Most commonly, it causes a mild childhood rash, Erythema infectiosum, but in some cases more serious symptoms can be linked to B19, such as acute or persistent arthropathies, critical failures of red cell production, Hydrops fetalis, fetal loss, myocarditis or hepatitis. Inactivation of the non-enveloped virus has proven difficult. As a consequence, manufacturers of blood products have implemented screening measures to reduce the load of parvovirus B19 in manufacturing plasma pools by the use of nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAT). In our institute all blood donations were screened for human parvovirus B19 by NAT since April 2000. Methods: Over the last 5 years 5.5 million donations were screened for B19 by NAT. Samples with a virus load over 105 IU/ml were defined as positive, whereas samples with a virus load between the detection limit (103 IU/ml) and 105 IU/ml were defined as weak positive. Weak positive products were released, whereas positive products were discarded. In addition infection markers of 50 B19 positive donors (case group) were determined over a time period of one year. Virus load and B19 antibody status was compared with 100 B19 negative donors (randomised control group). B19 antibodies (IgG VP2, IgM VP2, NS1) were analysed by two commercial antibody tests. Results: Overall 496 B19 NAT-positive donors were identified with a virus load over 105 IU/ml out of 5.5 million tested. There was a seasonal accumulation during spring and summer, whereas a large epidemic occurred throughout the last year. VP2 IgG was detected in 90.9% and 74% of the case and control group, respectively (P = 0.01). These data demonstrated statistically significance (P = 0.01). All donor samples which were B19 NAT positive for more than three months developed neutralizing VP2 antibodies. In contrast, NS1 antibodies were observed in 83% of the case group and in 15% of the control group (P < 0.01). NS1 antibodies were detected more frequently in samples, which were B19 NAT positive for more than six months. Conclusion: B19 NAT could be implemented in blood donor screening as release criterion without causing a shortage in blood supply. All B19 positive donors of the case group developed neutralizing antibodies within three months and virus load was dropped rapidly below 105 IU/mL.

Aim of the study: Several methods are currently developed to prevent the transfusion of bacterial contaminated platelet concentrates. The study investigates a new rapid bacterial detection method. Material/Methods: Pool platelet concentrates were spiked with seven transfusion relevant bacteria strains under sterile conditions at concentrations of 100 CFU/ml to 106 CFU/ml. Bacterial concentration was verified on blood agar plates immediately after spiking. Five millilitres of spiked platelet concentrates were centrifuged, stained with Thiazole Orange dye and analysed directly by FACS within five minutes after staining. Aliquots of pool platelets spiked with concentration of 102 CFU/mL and 101 CFU/mL of each bacteria strain were incubated for two to eight hours in special bouillon at 37\u00b0C and were analysed by FACS immediately after incubation. Results: Sensitivity of FACS analysis differed between 103 CFU/mL for E. coli and 105 CFU/mL for Klebsiella pneumoniae without preincubation and was enhanced to 101 CFU/ml when a pre-incubation step of two to four hours was included. Conclusion: Bacteria detection by FACS analysis combined with a short pre-incubation (2-4 h) at 37\u00b0C is a quick and simple method with sensitivity comparable to other commercially available detection systems. The advantage of this new method is the rapid analysis, easy handling, high sensitivity and less expensive price.

Methods: A prospective, one-year study has been set up in order to enrol at least 40 000 out of the estimate of 200 000 first-time donors, involving 21 blood transfusion centres from 9 of the 21 Italian regions. Each centre was required to enrol all first-time donors born before December 31st, 1978, and thus not included in the HBV mass vaccination campaign. The selected donors were tested for HBsAg (mandatory by law) and for anti-HBc by commercial assays. All HBsAg and/or anti-HBc positive specimens were stored frozen and sent to a reference laboratory for additional serological testing (anti-HBs, anti-HBe, anti-HBc/IgM and anti-HBc avidity index by an experimental procedure) and for the determination of HBV-DNA (both qualitative and quantitative) by real-time PCR.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 321, "end": 327, "text": "(2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 328, "end": 334, "text": "(2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 335, "end": 341, "text": "(2002)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 342, "end": 348, "text": "(2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 349, "end": 355, "text": "(2004)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-234 Seroepidimiology of transfusion transmitted diseases in the state of Achaia PT TSELIOU, G TALAMPOUKA, A SALTAMAVROS, V KIRIAKOPOULOU, C VERRA, T GOLFINOPOULOU and K ALEXOPOULOS Saint Andrews Hospital, Patras, Greece"}, {"text": "Results: In the first 9 months of the study the 21 sites saw almost 29 000 first-time donors, of whom 70.5% belonged to the required age groups.

Efficient work and close cooperation of blood bank staff and volunteer organisations is the key to success in blood donor recruitment and retention! With such a prospect, it was important to evaluate the practices of blood donor selection in the EU. Material and methods: A questionnaire was designed and sent in 2003 to the relevant institutions of the 15 EU countries plus Switzerland. The questionnaire included questions on the interviewing practices before homologous blood donations, regarding non-specific risks to donors and recipients, identified risks to donors, infectious, bacterial, viral, parasitic and prionic risks to recipients and non-infectious risks to recipients. The questionnaire also inquired about each country's exclusion period for each contraindication (CI) to donation. Results: Predonation interviews were prepared, in all countries, by circulating informative documents to blood donors. They were supported by written questionnaires in nearly all countries. In half of the countries, those interviews had to be led by physicians (nurses or technologists in the others). The 18-65 age limits for blood donation (18-60 for a first donation) were the rule in 11 countries. In other countries the age limit could be brought forward to 17 and extended to 70 years old. The time interval between donations was identical for men and women in 11 countries, and varied from 8 to 16 weeks according to country. The questions of the questionnaires were very similar as regards the identification of risks to donors and recipients, and very close to the requirements that appeared later in the 2004/33/EC directive.

Whole-blood donation comprises a puncture of a venous vessel and letting of blood (usually 450 ml), which may be repeated several times a year. Like other invasive procedures, blood donation has a range of effects on the individual who is subjected to it. Aim: The aim of this paper is to review some aspects of the present state of knowledge on effects and complications of whole-blood donations. Results: Most studies of the effects of whole-blood donations on the donor have focused on negative or unpleasant events and on time in rather close association to the donation. Complications related to percutaneous needle insertion (bruise assessed by inspection 0.66% -bruise assessed using post-donation interview 22.7%, sore arm 0-10.0%, nerve irritation 0.02%, arterial puncture/pseudoaneurysm/arteriovenous fistula 0.003-0.009% etc) are most commonly reported, while negative systemic reactions (vasovagal reactions 2.5-7.8%, syncope 0.08-0.34%) occurring in connection to blood donation are less frequent (Newman BH: Blood donor complications after whole-blood donation. Curr Opin Hematol 2004; 11: 339-345.) Serious complications requiring hospitalization (myocardial infarction, stroke) are extremely rare (0.0005%). Fatigue (7.8%-10.0%) and diminished physical working capacity (7.0%) are reported to occur during days after the donation. A recent study of a consecutive sample of 528 Swedish blood donors (Nilsson Sojka B, Sojka P: The blood-donation experience: perceived physical, psychological and social impact of blood donation on the donor. Vox Sang 2003; 84: 120-128.) (with a selfadministered questionnaire with an open-ended question: How does blood donation affect you? Physically-bodily/psychologicallyspiritually/ethically-morally/socially during or after blood donation?) revealed that perceived negative effects (fatigue, diminished physical working capacity, vertigo/dizziness, susceptibility to infections etc) were less common (25% of the donors) than positive effects (feeling of satisfaction, being more alert, feeling generally better, less migraine, higher physical working capacity, respect from environment, feeling of relaxation etc; 35% of the donors). The duration of positive effects was regularly reported to be weeks, while negative effects lasted only days. Investigations on the long-term effects of blood donation are scarce. Yet, they may indicate that the donation of blood is associated with e.g. lower blood pressure and a reduced risk of myocardial infarction (Nilsson Sojka B, Sojka P: The blood-donation experience: perceived physical, psychological and social impact of blood donation on the donor. Vox Sang 2003; 84: 120-128). Conclusion: Both the panorama and the frequency of occurrence of the different effects and complications of whole-blood donations vary as a function of how the information was gathered (openended questions, observations, interviews etc).

Methods: From summer 2002, a small project team of senior clinical and operational staff took 9 months to agree a detailed policy for capturing and recording all donor adverse events, including precise definitions for grades of vasovagal reactions and bruising. Detailed training material was written in May 2003 and the new protocol was validated in one region. From July to December a formal one day training programme was delivered to over 3000 staff working on 98 mobile collection teams, 19 static sites and 11 Blood Centres. DAER was fully implemented by January 2004. Adverse events are assessed by Health Care Professionals on session and the relevant code entered onto the donor's computer record by clerical staff. Information received after the session is entered by Centre based doctors using the same system. The database is interrogated monthly for statistics. Results: In the first 9 months 1.86 million donors attended sessions throughout England and North Wales.

These miniaturized microsystems allow the detection of hundreds of different targets simultaneously, inducing a dramatic decrease in reagent consumption, in additional confirmation tests and simplify data interpretation. However, the microsystems actually available require additional instrumentation and reagents for sample preparation and target-amplification prior to detection on the DNA array. Future technologies such as 'Lab-on-a-chip' include channels, fluidics and thermal zones allowing extraction, amplification and detection. Another major challenge in the area of DNA detection is the development of methods that do not rely on target-amplification systems. Almost all blood group antigens are bi-allelic and encoded by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "JS COSTE Etablissement Fran\u00e7ais du Sang, Montpellier, France"}, {"text": "To facilitate the direct availability of typed red cells and platelets, we develop a high-throughput technique to genotype by DNA microarray the whole donor cohort for all clinically relevant red cell and platelet antigens.

The method can be further improved to obtain the necessary automated throughput for typing of large donor cohorts. and 15, all other weak D types should be regarded as potential anti-D immunizers. For correct determination of weak D both serological typing (polyclonal and monoclonal), as RHD DNA typing are mandatory. When serology indicates weak D, more anti-D antibodies are tested (9 epitope model) to distinguish partial D from weak D. In addition, an RHD MPX PCR is performed to detect the presence of RHD exons 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9. In all known weak D types, all six RHD specific exons are amplified (except for weak D type 4 which lacks RHD exons 4 and 5), whereas partial D phenotypes usually show aberrant patterns. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic scheme for weak D typing. Methods: Between 2002 and 2004, 24 samples were investigated for weak D characteristics. Four PCR-SSP assays were developed for identification of weak D types 1 (809T > G), 2 (1154G > C), 3 (8C > G) and 5 (446C > A). Weak D type 4 was identified by the combination of serology and absence of exons 4 and 5 by RHD MPX PCR. RHD-specific exon sequencing was performed when serology and molecular typing were inconsistent. Results: All 24 samples were subjected to the RHD MPX PCR and 1 sample showed absence of RHD exons 4 and 5, indicative of a weak D type 4 when combined with serology. The remaining 23 samples were analyzed by the weak D PCR-SSPs, resulting in 12 weak D type 1 samples, 4 weak D type 2 samples, 4 weak D type 3 samples and 1 weak D type 5 sample. Two samples remained undetermined and were sequenced for all 10 RHD exons and the RHD promotor region. One sample showed the mutations corresponding to the DAU 2 partial D phenotype (209G>A, 998G>A and 1136C>T). The other sample had only one, not previously known mutation (1193A>T), which is located intracellularly at the COOHtail. Extensive serology using the 37 epitope model showed a pattern matching weak D. This new weak D variant was registered as weak D type 41. Conclusions: Based on these results it may be concluded that weak D phenotypes should be confirmed on molecular level to avoid misinterpretation of partial D that cannot be detected by RHD MPX PCR analyses. Patients with weak D phenotypes, except for types 1, 2 and 3 should be regarded as being at risk for anti-D immunization after transfusion of RhD-positive blood products and should therefore be treated with RhD-negative bloodproducts. In this evaluation, 4 out of 24 patients carried such alleles. Introduction: Although Kell antigens are expressed very early during erythropoiesis and a 0.1% incidence of anti-KEL1 is found in obstetric patients, this is a relatively rare cause of HDN. Anemia is produced by immune destruction of fetal RBCs and suppression of erythropoiesis. Maternal antibody titers or amniotic/cord blood bilirubin levels are not relevant indicators of the severity of the disease, and the measurement of the fetal haemoglobin by cordocentesis is a procedure with risks of miscarriage and sensitization. PCR techniques for the determination of blood groups using fetal DNA isolated from maternal plasma, allows the application of noninvasive methods. Clinical cases: We describe two cases of pregnancies in women with anti-KEL1 acquired by transfusion/previous pregnancies: 1st case: In July 2000, a 30-year-old woman (gravida 2, para 0), RhDnegative, KEL1-negative was referred at 20 weeks gestation. The father's phenotype was RhD-positive, KEL1-positive. A maternal antibody screen revealed D and KEL1 alloantibodies. DNA was extracted from amniotic liquid. The KEL genotype was determined by PCR-RFLP using the Bsm I. PCR-SSP was used to studied intron 4 and exon 7 of the RHD gene. The results showed that the fetus was positive for RHD sequences and showed KEL2 homozygosity; 2nd case: In August 2004, a 36-year-old woman (gravida 2, para 1) was referred at 28 weeks gestation. She had a history of transfusion with 2 RBCs units in 1996 -one of the donors was KEL1positive. The woman typed RhD-negative and her husband typed RhD-positive. RBCs from both were KEL1-negative. The maternal antibody screen revealed anti-KEL1. Doubts existed about the putative father of this child. DNA was extracted from maternal plasma using the MagNA Pure LC (Roche). Real-time PCR was applied to analyse: sequences of intron 4, exons 4, 6, 7 and pseudogene of the RHD gene and the SRY gene by SYBR Green; and the alleles KEL1/KEL2 by hybridization probes. All RHD sequences were detected (with the exception of the pseudogene) and the KEL genotype gave a KEL2/KEL2 result. In both cases the doctors choose not to use any invasive method to monitoring the fetuses regarding a HDN due to anti-Kell antibodies, and the results of the molecular analysis were confirmed by testing the cord RBCs after birth. Discussion: These cases illustrate the reliability of the molecular biology results, based on the collection of simple peripheral blood samples. A determination that the fetus lacks the relevant antigen obviates the need for expensive and invasive monitoring throughout the pregnancy. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is defined as: 'The conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. The practice of EBM requires the integration of individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research and our patient's unique values and circumstances. ' Otherwise healthy individuals without cardiopulmonary dysfunction (CDF) tolerate acute reduction of haemoglobin concentration to about 5 g/dl, provided that blood volume is kept normal by a volume expander. However, individuals experience physical fatigue, and there is faint reduction of perception as measured by neurophysiological tests. Symptoms are reversed upon retransfusion of fresh, autologous erythrocytes. Acute, normovolemic anemia seems to be progressively less tolerated with increasing age and CDF. Controversy has existed on whether or not to correct hypoalbuminemia in ASB or ICP by infusion of albumin. Recently a large trial showed no outcome differences between ICP patients treated with albumin or saline. Thus in general there is no indication for albumin in ASB or ICP. However, albumin may yet be advantageous in e.g. patients with head injuries. Furthermore, fractionated albumin is not equivalent to native albumin, since fractionation stabilizers remain bound to the albumin molecule. Thus more refined albumin preparations may carry advantages still to be investigated. Erythrocytes are given to increase the total oxygen transportation capacity of the organism. The effect of blood bank stored erythrocytes may differ from that of fresh, autologous erythrocytes, since changes of presumably important erythrocyte properties occur during storage. In the only large trial available, a transfusion trigger of 7.0 g/dl was found to be favourable to one of 10 g/dl in ICP, except possibly in ICP with unstable angina pectoris or heart infarction. However, the erythrocyte concentrates given were not leukocyte filtered, and side effects of infused leukocytes may have hampered the conclusion. On the other hand, a metanalysis showed transfusion as an independent indicator of unfavourable outcome in coronary bypass patients, but again, leukocyte filtered erythrocyte preparations were not applied. The effect on morbidity and mortality of 'top up' transfusions given e.g. to mobilize patients postoperatively has not been studied by trials, although this effect seems evident to many clinicians. Grave anemia may reduce the haemostatic effect of thrombocytes because changes of blood rheology reduces the pressure forcing thrombocytes against the walls of small vessels. The transfusion trigger for thrombocytes in ASB or ICP remains to be established by clinical trials, however. The same applies for fresh frozen plasma, which is infused as a source of coagulation factors. On the other hand, the haemostatic effect of various fibrinolysis inhibitors is well established in ASB and ICP, but many clinicians appear hesitant to use them. Another interesting haemostatic agent is recombinant FVIIa, the use of which to control ASB in blunt trauma is supported by one well controlled clinical trial. Evidence by systematic research is insufficient to decide what is optimal transfusion practice. The procurement of such evidence is one of the greatest current challenges to transfusion medicine research. . Concerns about the transfusion-related complications, such as infections, tumour behaviour and immuno-modulatory effects, and the costs, necessitated a re-evaluation of the transfusion practice. Aims: The goal of this study is to evaluate if a restrictive transfusion policy (Hb transfusion trigger <4.5 mmol/l) reduces the amount of red cell transfusion compared to a liberal transfusion trigger (Hb < 6.0 mmol/l) without a decrease in HRQoL. Because of concerns about the feasibility of this study early results were analysed and are presented in this abstract. Material and methods: After a run in period of 3 months (Hb transfusion trigger of Hb < 6.0 mmol/l) patients are randomised for the restrictive or the liberal transfusion policy. Patients are followed then 12 months. HRQoL is measured after inclusion, after randomisation, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomisation. Also anaemia related complications and red cell antibodies are scored. Hb values were blinded for the patients during the study period.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "Results: From July 2002 till June 2004 15 patients were included (4 RA, 5 RARS, 4 RCMD, 1 RAEB, 1 CMMoL) in 2 general hospitals and 1 university hospital. Two patients died in the run in period. Eight patients were randomised for the restrictive transfusion policy and 5 patients for the liberal transfusion policy. The mean follow up period in the liberal group was 6.2 months (inclusive run in period) and 7.4 months for the restrictive group. Two patients in the liberal group died after randomisation. One patient received growth factors. In the restrictive group 2 patients finished the study, 1 received growth factors and 1 patient withdrew informed consent. The mean Hb level was lower in the restrictive group and after randomisation about 55% reduction in amount of transfused red cells was found (1.8 units per pt per month in the liberal group vs 0.8 in the restrictive group). No anaemia related complications were found, e.g. cardiac failure and cerebro vascular ischemia nor a decrease in activity performance. Conclusion: There were some concerns after introduction of the restrictive transfusion policy. This preliminary results show, however, that a restrictive transfusion policy leads to a diminished use of red cell transfusion without an increase of cardiac complications or a decrease in activity performance. This study will be continued to compare HRQoL scores in both groups. Introduction: Strong evidence supports the efficacy of blood conservation strategies such as autologous blood donation (ABD) and erythropoietin (EPO) for reducing exposure to allogeneic blood. However, use of these interventions is highly variable among institutions and frequently sub-optimal. The Program to Reduce Orthopedic Blood Exposure (PROBE) evaluated a blood conservation program in patients undergoing total hip joint arthroplasty (THJA) at Ontario hospitals. Aim of the study: The objective of PROBE was to determine whether a comprehensive blood conservation algorithm (BCA) was more effective than usual care (UC) for reducing exposure to allogeneic blood in patients undergoing THJA. Methods: We randomized 30 hospitals that perform high volume elective primary THJA to implement either a BCA or to continue with UC. The BCA consisted of three components: physician and patient education, blood conservation interventions (use of ABD or EPO), and transfusion guidelines. T-PA-071 Table) .

It can be managed successfully in the vast majority of cases, so long as public health and other scientific and organizational infrastructures are adequate. Although the progress achieved in the field of bone marrow transplantation and other disciplines promises cure of the genetic defect, regular blood transfusion from early childhood remains the cornerstone of treatment of patients with thalassaemia major. This presents national health authorities with the formidable task of assuring an adequate blood supply of high quality and safety for these patients and ensuring that it is transfused in the appropriate way. The basic principle in the modern management of thalassaemia patients is that of a global approach to care. Within this approach, a standardized protocol for regular blood transfusions is a prerequisite for the patient's long survival and quality of life. If thalassaemia patients are not transfused effectively, the severe anaemia and over-expansion of bone marrow due to ineffective erythropoesis can lead to poor growth, bone deformities, organomegaly and impairment of normal physical activities. In countries or regions with large numbers of thalassaemic patients, the organizational and technical aspects of meeting their blood requirements represents a heavy additional workload for the blood transfusion services responsible for providing blood for this group of multi-transfused patients. The acquisition and preparation of blood, genotyping the patients' blood group (including at least Rh, Kell, Kidd and Duffy systems) preventing the transmission of infectious diseases and other transfusion associated complications, and assessing the patients' blood transfusion indices all have a tremendous impact on blood transfusion and treatment units. Blood transfusion services are thus confronted with major challenges that can only be met if appropriate national transfusion policies are in place, both in the laboratory and the clinical setting of blood transfusion. The availability of safe blood is related to the effectiveness of donation programmes aimed at recruiting and retaining voluntary unpaid blood donors who are at low risk for the transmission of infectious diseases. Sufficiency is further related to resources, organization and management of the blood transfusion service and continuous education of its staff. High technical standards for the transfused product and quality management systems are required to ensure that the product meets these requirements, as well as pre-transfusion, transfusion and haemovigilance systems and other more stringent quality measures in the whole chain of blood donation and transfusion. Additional measures and continuous care are specifically required for the optimal transfusion therapy of the thalassaemic patient. The patients should be transfused with red cell concentrates, (RCCs) preferably not more than one week's old and leucodepleted. Other processes i.e washing of RCCs, use of nutrient additive solutions, irradiation etc may be used to improve the quality and the safety of the transfused product, while other advances in red cell transfusion are expected to improve blood safety by preventing adverse reactions and reducing exposure of the patient to donor blood.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "C Politis G.

What differentiates the two forms of the disease is the severity of the clinical phenotype, which in turn depends on a particularly heterogeneous molecular background and imposes diverse therapeutic strategies. The consequences of the genetic defect as well as the effect of the applied therapy seem to be mainly responsible for the clinical course of the disease. In untreated TM cases, the aforementioned consequences occur fast and patients die early in life mainly due to high output heart failure. Over the past decades, the gradual adoption of the current transfusion and iron chelation strategies and the patients' compliance with this therapy have resulted in a significant improvement of survival, that according to recent statistics reaches 68% at age 35. This rate is even better in well-treated patients, almost 80% of whom survive at age 40. Regular therapy extends survival mainly by preventing early development of cardiac complications. In addition, a multi-organ improvement is accomplished while patients' physical appearance is almost indistinguishable from that of the general population, hence permitting a normal social behavior with a high overall quality of life. Bone marrow expansion and extramedular hematopoiesis are prevented; hepatosplenomegaly is substantially restricted and usually there is no need for splenectomy, while thromboembolic complications are rare and pulmonary hypertension is practically absent. Patients with TI remain as a rule without regular therapy until a number of severe complications arise. The consequences of chronic anemia develop slowly compared to untreated TM cases and dominate patients' clinical picture usually by the third decade of life. At this time, all patients have developed hepatosplenomegaly and most of them have been splenectomized. Bone marrow expansion results to bone deformities and fractures often occur. Extramedular hemaotpoietic masses and bone deformities may lead to various complications depending on their bulk and location, such as neurological symptoms from masses arising in the paraspinal area or dyspnea from lung restriction. Hypercoagulability, resulting from defects of native erythrocyte membrane phospholipids, together with the coexistent thrombocytosis in splenectomized patients lead to a wide spectrum of thromboembolic events. Pulmonary involvement with respiratory dysfunction and hypoxemia as well as pulmonary hypertension leading to congestive heart failure are well documented in TI patients. Nowadays, the beneficial effects of regular transfusion and chelation therapy in TM are beyond any doubt. The occasional application of transfusions in TI has a transient effect and does not seem to inhibit the consequences of chronic hypoxia. Intensive and regular transfusion and chelation therapy in TI has proved effective in ameliorating the established complications such as spinal cord compression, hypercoagulability and pulmonary hypertension, without however reversing them. Given the 30-year experience on intensive therapy in TM and the first encouraging data in TI, the earlier application of such treatment seems to be crucial in TI. The timing however of therapeutic intervention in TI in order to prevent anemia-related complications still remains an open issue that needs to be properly addressed.

Viral safety relies on careful donor selection, viral testing of the source material and viral inactivation and/or elimination during the manufacturing process. MPP manufacturing processes must include viral safety steps capable of inactivating, and/or eliminating, a large range of viruses covering the known blood borne viruses as well as anticipating possible future pathogens. It is recognized that one single step is often not sufficient to satisfy this requirement and manufacturing processes very often include two or even three complementary viral safety steps. Very efficient methods have been implemented by manufacturers, for two decades, for the inactivation of major blood borne enveloped viruses (HIV, HCV and HBV). Additional safety steps have also been introduced to provide a second step for enveloped viruses and to extend the efficacy to nonenveloped viruses (HAV and Parvovirus B19). Pasteurisation (liquid heat treatment at 60\u00b0C) which has been historically used for viral inactivation of albumin solutions has been applied to some other plasma products. Solvent-detergent (SD) treatment which is specific to enveloped viruses is used primarily for coagulation factors. Since the introduction of SD-treated products, no HIV, HCV or HBV transmission has been reported. Viral inactivation of coagulation factors can also be achieved using various conditions of dry-heating. Acidic treatment is also an efficient means of inactivating viruses in IgG products. Nanofiltration using filters of less than 50 nm pore size was introduced in the early 1990s. This technique for viral elimination is based on the size of the agent and is independent of their resistance to other treatments. This property could be helpful in cases of new emerging pathogenic agents. New inactivation tech-niques are currently under development such as UV treatment or gamma irradiation with efficacy reported on enveloped as well as non-enveloped viruses. These new techniques can complement existing methods after careful validation that they do not have harmful effects on proteins in the product. The efficacy of existing techniques is well documented in controlled clinical studies and pharmacovigilance records. Their application to each product is extensively validated at laboratory scale, according to international regulations and then carefully evaluated by health authorities. In this context, a recent European Guideline established a viral risk assessment model to quantitatively estimate the theoretical safety margins of MPPs, by taking into account the different safety measures, such as viral testing of plasma and the efficacy of viral inactivation/elimination steps. Whilst technical limitations and some lack of scientific data lead to very conservative estimates, this model gives an overall assessment of the efficacy of the measures in the manufacture of a given product.

Safety nets rely on carefully done: donor selection to exclude high-risk donors, serological and NAT viral testing of single donations and, pooled plasma testing using sensitive validated methods, and most particularly, efficient viral reduction treatments that must be validated and implemented at a large-scale following good manufacturing practices. Over the last 25 years, successive key breakthrough in plasma product viral safety have included the use of solvent-detergent treatment to inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses, and NAT testing of starting plasma pools and viral nanofiltration of products to reduce the risks associated to small non-enveloped viruses. The excellence of the system currently in place is illustrated by the demonstration that these safety barriers have virtually stopped the transmission of known viruses and avoided that of 'emerging' agents, such as West Nile virus (WNV). However, multiple viral reduction treatments have generally decreased product recovery. In addition, although the implementation of viral reduction treatments have forced fractionators to introduce significant changes to product manufacturing methods, this period has been understandably followed by a period of relative conservatism of the plasma fractionation industry against further process changes. As time evolves and market dynamics changes struggle for improved economic balance of the plasma product industry is putting product recovery and diversified product portfolio at the forefront of R&D objectives. These developments in the plasma fractionation scene of the Western world have been taking place in a context where many patients in the developing world are still treated with sub-standard, non-virally inactivated crude plasma fractions.

In addition, growing concern about the unfavourable cost-effectiveness of most autologous haemotherapy methods requires a refinement of the application of these measures to well defined circumstances. In contrast, newly emerging transfusion-transmissible infections or periods of blood shortage might revive interest in these blood sparing techniques. The first two cases of transfusion transmitted vCJD provide a paradigm for this scenario; not so much with respect to a public fear of infection but rather a waning donor population due to more rigorous recruitment criteria. Preoperative autologous blood donation (PABD) still plays a significant role in settings with high individual benefit for the patient, high transfusion probabilities and when all opportunities of cost minimization can be applied. Adjustment to the individual situation of the patient is the main aim of a medically reasonable and economic use of autologous haemotherapy. This implies consideration of the patient's haematocrit, blood volume, tolerable blood loss, expected blood loss, etc. in order to choose the optimal method in the individual case. In this respect, double red cell apheresis may play a significant role. With this approach, donation schedules assumed to enhance erythropoiesis can be adopted. Moreover, inconveniencies caused by long distances between patient home and donation service can be facilitated by withdrawing two red cell units during one session in selected patients. In conclusion, red cell apheresis can be used to promote the proposed approach towards individualized autologous haemotherapy Preoperative plasmapheresis is considered to be a sensible adjunct if intraoperative retransfusion of salvaged and washed red cells is planned. Acute normovolaemic haemodilution is valuable when the patient's tolerability of the haemodilution and the expected blood loss are carefully examined beforehand. Intraor postoperative salvage of wound blood can also be regarded as useful measures to prevent allogeneic transfusions as long as the specific advantages and disadvantages of the different methods are taken into account. Finally, alternative and supplemental measures such as iron or erythropoietin administration should always be considered in order to optimize the efficacy and effectiveness of autologous haemotherapy methods. The goal of a 'bloodless medicine' might not be reached but is supposed to be approached closely with an integrated concept exploiting all measures available. However, in times of restricted health care resources, regular sound costeffectiveness analyses, taking the availability and the cur-rent safety profile of allogeneic blood products into account, are always warranted and needed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "T-PA-086 Modern concepts of autologous hemotherapy V KRETSCHMER and R KARGER University Hospital, Marburg, Germany"}, {"text": "Compensatory fluid replacement of surgical blood losses: The transfusion of allogeneic blood is expensive and -although safer than ever before -still associated with potential complications.

As a consequence an intraoperative blood loss is initially not replaced by red blood cells, but by erythrocyte-free, i.e. cristalloidal or colloidal solutions. When normovolemia is maintained the resulting dilutional anemia is compensated by an increase of cardiac output and enhanced arterial O2 extraction. However, once the Hb has dropped to values recommended as the lower intraoperative limit, or once compensatory mechanisms of acute anemia become exhausted, as a rule transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) is initiated to increase arterial oxygen content (CaO2) and to preserve a margin of safety for tissue oxygenation and organ function.

This disturbance is related with reduced oxygen delivery, subsequent lactic acidosis and imbalance in oxidative status. The final result will most likely be an increased mortality and morbidity. Aim: The important issue from clinical aspect is to define the optimal volume and type of fluid therapy. The debate for the ideal resuscitation solution lasts a couple of decades due to inconclusive and conflicting results. Method: We searched the literature for clinical trials and major met analyses concerning patients undergoing scheduled surgical procedures, trauma patients and critical ill who received resuscitation fluids. Results: Dextrans reduce blood viscosity and von Willebrand factor levels more, for the same degree of hemodilution, compared to other plasma expanders. In clinical setting they are effective in reducing the incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. After the initiation of Dextran 1 for prophylaxis against anaphylactic reactions, they are considered the safest plasma substitutes, except maybe during pregnancy. Dextran 40 10% is the most like to cause the 'hyperoncotic acute renal failure' syndrome. Gelatins also cause a decrease in circulating levels of vWF : ag, vWF R : Co, thrombin-antithrombin complexes and F1+2. In clinical aspect however, there are contradicted results about the effect of gelatins in bleeding diathesis, although they appear to exert a greater effect on RBCs protection from mechanical stress. In respect to anaphylactoid reactions, they have the greatest relative risk. HES has the same effectiveness in volume expansion with albumin and has the advantage of remaining intravascular even if there is an increased capillary permeability. In addition, it may improve splanchnic blood flow and tissue oxygenation. HES130/0.4 subsides the inflammatory response in patients undergoing major surgery, compared to a crystalloid-based volume therapy, but has conflicting results about it's effects on neutrophil respiration burst. Clinical trials have so far failed to have a unanimous conclusion about the bleeding diathesis after HES administration, especially. Caution must be held when administering HES during renal transplantation. Albumin became the scapegoat of transfusion strategy during the past 20 years. Resent met analysis have contradicted results about the safety of albumin infusion in variouw settings. A positive effect seems to have the early administration of hypertonic solutions in trauma patients, especially in combination with dextrans. Conclusions: Although some minor conclusions can be extracted, there is still a great lack of large scale multicentre randomized prospective clinical trials for extracting evidence based criteria. Instead, we try to extract conclusions through met analysis.

In transfusion medicine, antibodies to antigens in the platelet membrane have traditionally been regarded as less significant compared with antibodies towards red cell antigens. There is an increasing awareness of antibodies towards platelet antigens. Detection of autoantibodies to platelets can be a diagnostic challenge, but is seldom a problem in transfusion medicine because patients with such antibodies rarely are candidates for platelet transfusions. Also, severe foetal thrombocytopenia is seldom present in pregnancies with autoantibodies to platelet antigens. The real challenge in transfusion medicine is related to patients with severe thrombocytopenia who are refractory to platelet transfusion due to alloantibodies towards platelet antigens. In our department, flow cytometry is used for compatibility testing and the choice of compatible blood donor is done without knowledge of antibody specificity. If crossmatch negative random donors cannot be identified, antibody specificity testing is performed and donors are chosen based on the specificity of the antibodies determined by a modified MAIPA procedure and with HLA class I beads (FlowPra from One Lambda, USA) in flow cytometry. In some cases both HLA class I and human platelet antigen (HPA) specific antibodies are detected and HLA class I, HPA matched donors are chosen for crossmatch. If the crossmatch is negative, there is >90% chance of successful transfusions. In some cases drug induced anti-platelet antibodies are suspected and flow cytometry based antibody tests are performed in the presence and absence of the drug. In the case of suspected Heparin induced antibodies, a beads assay is performed (DiaMed, Switzerland). Two percent of Caucasian women have the platelet type HPA 1bb. Ten percent of these women make anti-HPA 1a antibodies in their first HPA 1a incompatible pregnancy. 1 in 1000-2000 new-born has thrombocytopenia due to maternal alloantibodies which have crossed the placenta (neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, NAITP). Results from a screening study covering the outcome of 100 000 pregnancies show that only 2 babies were born with intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and there was no still-born babies in the study. Pregnant women with a-HPA 1a antibodies were diagnosed, received careful clinical follow-up and the delivery was performed by caesarean section in week 38 of the pregnancy with immediate transfusion of HPA compatible platelets if the new-born had platelet count <35 \u00a5 10 E 9 /l. In previous studies, it is reported the ICH appears in 10-30% of the pregnancies where antibodies are present and that 50% of the babies with ICH, die. Our results are different from what is reported from other studies and this may reflect the prospective approach and the clinical interventions. NAITP represent a challenge in transfusion medicine both diagnostically, but also related to compatible blood products for the thrombocytopenic new-born and the mother who may have high level of antibodies towards platelet antigens. Methods: Apheresis platelets (4 \u00a5 10e 11 mean) from donors with same blood group were pooled and divided equally into two bags, PO-80 and control (PL2410, Baxter), which have 2660 and 2024 mL/m 2 *day*atm of oxygen permeability, respectively. On days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 of storage, swirling, mean platelet volume, pO2, pCO2, pH, glucose, lactate, aggregation, and P-selectin expression were evaluated. Six experiments were performed. Results: The swirling pattern was preserved better for up to 9 days in PO-80 (6/6) than in control (3/6) bags. Dropped pH less than 6.2 on day 9 was observed 1/6 in PO-80 whereas 3/6 in the control. Aggressive drop of glucose (0 mmol/L) with prominent lactate accumulation (327 mg/L) was also observed on day 9 in 1 of control bags. The pO2 level in the control dropped more significantly by 45% (46.6 mmHg) on day 3 than in PO-80 (65.8 mmHg) compared with the initial level (84.9 mmHg) (P < 0.001). These results suggest that aerobic metabolism of higher concentration platelets was maintained better in a container with higher oxygen permeability. And less lactate generation with slower glucose consumption is also suggested in PO-80 bags than in control bags. The %HSR and aggregation decreased gradually in a similar manner in both bags until day 7, and became a detrimental defect in 2 of 6 control bags on day 9. P-selectin expression was higher in control bags than in PO-80 on days 7 and 9 with no statistical difference.

Furthermore, studies have also indicated that the presence of glucose in the platelet suspending medium is important for maintenance of platelet quality.

In order to have optimal pH, the currently available PAS such as T-Sol does not contain any glucose. This study describes a novel twostep approach to provide a glucose containing additive solution (PAS-G) by using an acid, glucose containing electrolyte solution (pH 5.5) for resuspension and processing of the pooled buffy coats (BC), followed by transfer of the processed platelet concentrate (PC) into a storage bag containing bicarbonate for pH neutralization and maintenance during extended storage. Aim: Compare the platelet quality of pooled BC PC stored in PAS-G with pooled BC PC stored in T-Sol. Methods: A paired study design was used, where a pool of 8 BCs obtained from standard day 1-old CPD-WB units, was divided into two equal parts: One part was resuspended and processed with a Pall leukoreduction system (ATSBC) using T-Sol, the other part was processed in a similar manner with the acid part of PAS-G.

Today, other risks get into the focus of haemovigilance. Bacterial contamination of blood products can occur via the donor, suffering from a (clinically unapparent) bacterial infection, or via the donation process itself, storage and handling of the blood product. Particularly platelet concentrates (PC) are vulnerable to bacterial growth due to their storage conditions. Patients receiving such products have a potential risk of severe complications or even death. Modern hygiene regimes, e.g. improved disinfection of the donors\u00b4 skin or preparation of blood products in fully closed systems as well as diversion, led to a significant reduction of bacterial contamination risk in the past. However, a small risk remains. Therefore, two possible ways of further reducing the risk of bacterial contamination of blood products are feasible: (a) Testing and/or (b) Inactivation. Testing for bacterial contamination is possible by different methods: Direct detection methods for bacteria (microscopy, flow cytometry) have disadvantages regarding sample size and detection limit. Bacteria might rapidly grow in a contaminated PC, so testing should be performed as close as possible to transfusion to the recipient. Biochemical methods like oxygen consumption might not detect anaerobic germs. Automated culture methods are still the most sensitive technique, but they have their downsides as well (e.g. time and size of aliquot drawn). Novel molecular genetic test methods for detection of bacterial nucleic acid are in different states of development, but still have to proof their suitability for routine use. Three different principles of pathogen inactivation can be distinguished: Photodynamic reactions produce oxygen radicals which in turn inactivate bacterial structures by oxidation processes. Examples for these chemicals are phenothiazines like methylene blue and thionin as well as vitamins like riboflavin (vitamin B2). Photochemical reactants penetrate cell boundaries and irreversibly inhibit nucleic acid, thus blocking replication and proliferation of pathogens. Chemicals of this group are psoralens like amotosalen as well as PEN-110 or S-303. The third method, the solvent detergent (SD) method, is used for pooled plasma only and consists of the combination of both solvents and detergents, which interact with membranes and destroy bacteria. Methods for inactivation of bacterial contaminants have to proof, that they effectively inhibit bacterial growth while maintaining full functionality of the blood product at the same time. These two qualities have to be fulfilled up to the end of the storage period. Toxic or mutagenic compounds must not remain in the final product. The technology must be easily integrated into the existing work cycle of a blood bank. Finally, costs per product must be acceptable. In summary, both testing and inactivation have their advantages and disadvantages, which have to be weighed up against costs and benefits of both procedures. Pros and cons of introduction of inactivation methods in a blood donor service producing 1 600 000 blood components per year will be discussed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Inactivation of bacteria ES SEIFRIED and MM MUELLER German Red Cross Blood Donor Service, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"}, {"text": "Bacterial contamination of blood components, particularly platelets, is now recognized as a serious adverse reaction that is preventable. There are many studies that have documented that these reactions occur from platelets stored at room temperature, most commonly arising from a skin contaminant, but originating from donors with asymptomatic bacteremia in about 1/3 of cases. The problem is intensified for patients receiving pools of platelets compared to single donor platelets collected by apheresis. Reactions are more commonly noted and more severe with platelets stored for greater lengths of time. Previous studies at Johns Hopkins described a series of 23 reactions in 12 years with reactions more common in platelet pools (1 : 1600 transfusions) than with single donor platelets (1 : 15 000 transfusions). These reactions caused fatalities in 4 of 23 cases. Although our data suggests that these reactions are more common than other studies using hemovigilance systems, our case definition requiring culture of all transfusion reactions to platelets led to a more reliable estimate of the incidence of sepsis from platelets, Many potential solutions have been proposed to prevent these reactions. Improved skin antisepsis should always be sought but will never eliminate the 1/3 of reactions due to asymptomatic bacteremia. The same limitation applies to methods that divert potential skin plugs from the collection bag. Antibiotics in the bag would lead to manufacturing concerns or problems for patients with drug allergies. Although cold storage of platelets is currently being revisited, it is not yet a practical solution. Pathogen eradication systems have been developed but they remain unapproved in most of the world and have led to concerns about toxicity of additives, damage to treated cells, and cost. As a result of increasing recognition of the problem, there has been increased interest in bacterial screening to prevent sepsis from platelets. In March 2004, the AABB Standards required testing of platelets for bacterial contamination. Testing programs have been implemented in the US widely as a result of the AABB action. Licensed systems based upon bacterial culture or growth characteristics are available for single donor platelets and have been commonly employed. Although these systems have some difficulty with false positive reactions, the evolving national data suggest an incidence of 1 : 5000 true positive reactions. These data suggest that a number of serious reactions have been averted, although some cases have persisted due to incomplete adoption, problems with slow growing bacteria, or the use of inferior testing methods with inadequate sensitivity. Whole blood derived platelets have become a more difficult issue, since the approved testing methods are limited. The use of pH monitoring, Gram stain, glucose measurements, and inspection for swirling have all been attempted. These methods are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to interdict many contaminated units, so that screening for bacteria in pooled platelets is less effective. It is anticipated that new methods may become available to make screening of whole blood derived platelets easier to perform in a reliable manner. It is also hoped that bacterial screening of platelets may form the basis to permit seven day storage and prestorage pooling in the US. Results: Twenty four HCV RNA (+)/anti-HCV(-) repeat donors were previously tested in routine HCV RNA in mini-pools and were negative. Twenty available look back samples were individually tested for HCV RNA and in one the virus was detected. To make sure that the failure of HCV RNA detection in routine NAT was not due to the pooling procedure, the HCV RNA was tested in undiluted look back sample and dilutions of this sample by HCV negative plasma: 2/2 repeats of 48x dilution and 2/2 repeats of 24x dilution were HCV RNA negative, whereas 1/1 repeat of 8x dilution and 2/2 repeats of undiluted sample were positive.

Bacterial culturing (BC) of platelets as well as pathogen reduction (PR) reduce the likelihood of such contamination.

Therefore, the question arises whether this additional expenditure can be justified in the light of the additional effect achieved. This question we will answer by cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses. Methods: The balance between costs and effects of preventing adverse events due to platelet transfusion is assessed using a mathematical model and assuming optimal effectiveness of PR. Model parameters and valuations of health states were obtained from literature and information from Dutch Sanquin blood banks. . While the estimates in comparison to the situation without BC or PR are surrounded with large uncertainties, the conclusion that PR is not cost-effective in comparison to BC is very robust.

For some children the collection of CB following the birth of a sibling may be the only opportunity for a transplant. Directed CB (DCB) donations from matched siblings have been shown to give better long-term overall results than matched unrelated CB or BM.

Background: A number of adverse immune reactions associated with blood transfusion result from contamination of blood products by donor white blood cells. Among these reactions, transfusionassociated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) has a mortality of greater than 90%. Mirasol \u00ae Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) has been developed for the reduction of viruses, bacteria, parasites and white blood cells loads in blood products. The technology is based on light and riboflavin photochemistry. This study was performed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the Mirasol \u00ae PRT process for inactivation of human PBMNCs. Methods: Human PBMNCs were collected from Trima platelet apheresis disposable sets, purified by Ficoll-Hypaque discontinuous gradient centrifugation and divided into test and control samples. The test cells were treated with Mirasol \u00ae PRT in autologous plasma on day 0. Both test and control samples (n = 3) were tested on day 1 for cellular immunophenotype, T-cell activation using flow cytometry, proliferation in response to mitogen or allogeneic stimulator cells, ability to stimulate the proliferation of allogeneic responder cells and cytokine synthesis in response to LPS stimulation was measured using a CBA assay kit. Results: Although Mirasol \u00ae PRT treatment did not significantly change the distribution of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD19+ and CD16+CD56+ human lymphocyte subpopulations there were significant functional change. The expression of the activation marker, CD69, was observed in 65.4% (SD = 15.6%) of control T cells upon activation with PMA, while only a 1.7% (SD = 1.3%) of the test T cells increased CD69 expression. Proliferation assays showed that 3H-thymidine incorporation did not increase in the test cells in response to either PHA or allogeneic stimulator PBMNC compared to the significant increase in thymidine incorporation levels observed with control cells. The test cells, when compared to the controls cells, demonstrated an inability to stimulate allogeneic responder PBMNC proliferation. The release of IL-10, IL-6, IL-1b and IL-8 cytokines after 24-h incubation in culture media increased significantly to 128 pg/ml (SD = 73), >5000 pg/ml, 404 pg/ml (SD = 301) and >5000 pg/ml for control cells, respectively.

Methods: New Zealand white rabbits were transfused with syngeneic blood (10 mL/kg), across a major antigen (HgD) mismatch. High anti-S-303 Ab titers (\u22651 : 1000) were induced after repeated immunization (days 1, 8, 15, 36, 64) with KLH-(S-303) hapten (KLHhapten) in complete Freund's adjuvant.

For this reason, in pregnant women, a screening for irregular antibodies research is routinely performed. However the indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) may result falsely positive or negative for various causes, as operative mistakes or low specificity/sensitivity of the used techniques. Aim of the study. In this study we have retrospectively evaluated the real incidence of alloimmunizations occurred in women screened by private laboratories. Methods: We have studied 1.560 women, 19-43 years old, resulted IAT positive at the first screening and successively assisted by our two Hospitals. All women were re-tested, using gel-agglutination technique, for both direct antiglobulin test and IAT. Results: A positive IAT was confirmed only in 64 cases; moreover a RBC autoimmunization was found in 7 women.

Results: Out of 50 samples molecular typing results were as follows: in 5 samples Dw were not determined, in 45 samples, 20 weak D type 1; 12 weak D type 2; 8 weak D type 3, 1 weak D type 11; 3 weak D type 14 and 1 weak D type 15 were determined. By all monoclonal reagents 95% weak D type 1, 100% weak D type 2, 10% weak D type 3 and 100% weak D type 15 negative results were given. By all monoclonal reagents weak D type 11 and weak D type 14 positive results were given. Conclusion: According to weak D types, which were known to be at risk for anti-D immunization further advances may be brought by improved patient's monoclonal typing reagents with a low and donor's monoclonal typing reagents with high affinity for weak D type 1, type 2 and type 15. Such improved typing strategies with novel reagents would enhance the transfusion safety.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-267 Affinity of monoclonal RHD reagents for weak D: risk for anti-D immunization Z HUNDRIC HASPL, J BINGULAC POPOVIC, V DRAZIC, I BOSANAC, M TOMICIC, N JURAKOVIC-LONCAR, I JUKIC and M BALIJA Croatian Institute of Transfusion Med., Zagreb, Croatia"}, {"text": "Background: Vel is a high-incidence antigen found in >99% of the population. Anti-Vel can be IgM or IgG and reacts optimally at IAT, although it can also react at immediate spin and 37C. Anti-Vel may or may not cause severe hemolytic transfusion reactions and mild to severe HDN. Autoanti-Vel has also been reported. The AABB Technical Manual 14th edition states that the Vel antigen is unaffected by protease and sulfhydryl treatment. We have reason to believe that sulfhydryl treatment may have an effect on the Vel antigen as evidenced by a recently referred case. Case report: A 67 year-old Caucasian female presented with symptoms of anemia and renal vascular hypotension. Transfusion history indicated multiple red cell transfusions in 1959. According to the patient, previous attempts to locate compatible units were unsuccessful. The case was referred to our laboratory. The patient's red cells (rbcs) typed as group O, D+ with a negative DAT. The serological picture revealed an antibody reacting 2 + -3 + s at 37 C/LISS, as well as at the antiglobulin phase. The antibody reacted with all rbcs tested and the autocontrol was negative. Further characterization of the antibody showed similar reactivity using enzyme-treated rbcs (0.1% ficin) and no reactivity using 0.2 M dithiothreitol-(DTT)treated rbcs. A high incidence negative red cell panel (untreated) was selected that lacked antigens reported to be destroyed by DTT. The antibody reacted with all rbcs tested. Additional rbcs were tested that lacked high-incidence antigens, including Vel. The antibody did not react with four Vel-rbcs tested using LISS and PEG methods. The patient's rbcs typed as Vel-negative. All other clinically significant antibodies were ruled out using Vel-or DTT-treated rbcs. Based on the unusual reactivity demonstrated by the anti-Vel, we tested 12 different examples of anti-Vel (frozen in our rare sera inventory) against two sets of known Vel+ and Vel-rbcs. One rbc set was DTT-treated; the other set was tested neat. LISS enhancement was used to test both sets. One of the 12 antisera failed to react with the positive control and one reacted with the negative control. Both were disqualified from the study. Four of ten remaining antisera demonstrated a decrease in reactivity >1 grade, between the neat and the DTT-treated rbcs. The remaining six antisera showed no change in reactivity. Conclusion: Contrary to the statement in the AABB Technical Manual, we discovered that sulfhydryl treatment (0.2 M DTTtreatment) can have an effect on the Vel antigen. Our experience has demonstrated that in some cases anti-Vel may not react or may show reduced reactivity when tested with DTT-treated rbcs. Therefore, the presence of anti-Vel should not be ruled out if negative reactivity with DTT-treated rbcs is encountered. Additionally, DTT treatment may be a useful tool obtaining rule-outs of other clinically significant antibodies in the presence of anti-Vel. Additional data is needed to confirm these findings. but with no identified specific antibodies were investigated by repeated screening/crossmatch, papainized panel identification, HLA antibody screening by lymphocytotoxicity test (LCT) and ELISA in some cases. Patients' age, sex, department, diagnosis, previous transfusions/pregnancies, techniques, reactions' strength, number of positive cells, urgency, subsequent antibody tests, identification and LCT were noted. Antibody tests were performed: at pretransfusion testing (PT) by LISS-Coombs (DiaMed) and at blood grouping (BG) by BioVue polyspecific (Ortho) microcolumns -manually in urgency and routinely by Sampler IIF (DiaMed) and MITIS (Ortho) systems. Results: Investigated reactivity was recorded in 241 samples from 186 patients; 29 (15.6%) patients had > 1 episode. These findings comprised 15.1% of 1598 unexpected results found at PT and BG. Incidences were 0.18% at routine and 0.21% at urgent BG (37 339 and 16 003 BGs, respectively), and 0.35% both at routine and urgent PT (15 803 and 23 705 PTs, respectively). 56.5% patients were female, 44.6% over 60, but 19.9% < 30 years, coming mostly from surgery (19.4%), internal medicine (15.1%), hematology (10.8%), ginecology (10.2%), cardiac diseases (9.1%) and cardiac surgery (8.6% patients). Frequent diagnosis were solid tumors (16.1%), cardiac diseases (13.4%), hematologic malignancies (8.6%), uraemia (4.8%), orthopedic surgery (4.3%) and hepatic diseases (3.2% patients). 43.0% patients were previously transfused, with only 9.1% patients proved as not transfused or pregnant. Subsequently positive antibody test during the study had 27.6% tested patients. At PT positive crossmatch was found in 38.8%, antibody screening in 43.9% and both tests in 17.3% cases. Majority of reactions were '1+' (50% at PT and 38.6% at BG); reactions '3+' or '4+' were found in only 5.1% cases at PT, compared to 17% at BG. One crossmatch only was positive in 75.2% positive crossmatches, with 38/43 patients having > 1 crossmatched unit. AHG identification was positive in 27.6% tested patients; in 26% of them papainized panel was also positive. Lymphocytotoxic antibodies were found in 45.5% tested patients; 72.6% (8%-100%) of lymphocytes were reactive. Finally, the cause of reactivity in antibody tests was determined as 'laboratory mistake' in 42.5%, HLA lymphocytotoxic antibodies in 9.7%, 'IgG antibodies of unknown specificity' in 7.5% (HLA noncytotoxic antibodies in 2/2 ELISA tested samples!), contaminated sample in 5.9%, anti-Bga in 4.8%, non-specific cold antibodies in 3.8%, subsequently recognized specific antibodies in 3.2% (2 Lua, 2 M, 1 Kpa, 1 Yka), non-specific autoantibodies in 3.2%, carry-over of DAT-positive cells and antibody to reagent in 2.2% cases each, while in 4.3% cases antibody screening and in 4.8% cases crossmatch was repeatedly positive without confirmation in panels. Discussion: After introducing of sensitive microcolumns, positive antibody tests without detectable specific antibodies require significant laboratory activities, particularly in older patients with malignancies or surgery. Such reactivity was frequently caused by laboratory mistake, but often HLA and sometimes specific antibodies were later recognized, or reactivity continued without confirmation in panels. Relationships that may be helpful are further discussed in abstract part II. Results: Significant differences (P < 0.05) and relationships of interest were noted. Sex. In female vs male patients frequent features were: crossmatch as only reactivity at PT (45.8% vs 28.2%), positive LCT (59.4% vs 26.1%), lymphocytotoxic HLA antibodies (LyTxAb) (13.3% vs 4.9%) and reactivity 'positive screening, negative panels' (5.7% vs 2.5%); in males non-specific cold antibodies (7.4% vs 1.0%) and antibodies to reagents (4.9% vs 0) were noted. Age. In patients > 60 vs < 30 reactivity was often found at PT (65.1% vs 35.8%), caused by LyTxAb (21.7% vs 5.4%), anti-Bga (8.4% vs 2.7%) or 'positive crossmatch, negative panels' (9.6% vs 0), but rarely by laboratory mistake (37.3% vs 59.5%) or later recognized antibody (1 of 6 patients). Subsequent antibody tests: Tests were subsequently positive more often if reactivity was found at PT (79.3% vs 20.7% at BG), as positive antibody screening (41.7% vs 29.2% if positive crossmatch), with positive panels (48.3% vs 12.2% if negative). Subsequent tests were positive in only 43.8% patients with LyTxAb, 50% with anti-Bga, 1 of 3 with antibodies to reagent and in no case with 'positive crossmatch, negative panels' . Techniques. LCT was positive in 60% and 45.5% tested samples found at urgent and routine PT (DiaMed), vs 0 at BG. All 18 cases due to LyTxAb, 8 of 9 anti-Bga and 6 of 8 'positive antibody screening, negative panels' were found by DiaMed. At BG (Ortho) 71.4% cold antibodies and 64.6% laboratory mistakes were found. Positive antibody test: Identification was negative in 78.6% screening-only cases; 69% of them were caused by laboratory mistake. LyTxAb were found in 67.9% crossmatch-only cases; 77.8% reactivities caused by LyTxAb were crossmatch-only. Identification. AHG panel was positive in 60% cases with LyTxAb (in 2 with papainized panel) and often due to 'IgG antibodies of unknown specificity' (29.7%), anti-Bga (24.3%), contaminated sample (16.2%), but also to later recognized specific antibody (10.8% cases). Strength of reaction: Laboratory mistake was noted in 61.6% of 'w', 41.3% of '1+', 46.4% of '2+' and 58.8% of '3+ and 4+' antibody screenings (ns). Diagnosis. In patients with solid and hematologic malignancy reactivity was often found at PT (80% and 81.3% of patients, respectively), due to positive crossmatch (40% and 50%; 0 and 4.3% patients with liver and cardiac diseases) and caused by LyTxAb (16.7% and 31.3%) or 'crossmatch/screening positive, panels negative' (16.7% patients with solid tumors). In patients with liver and cardiac diseases reactivity was often found at BG (83.3% and 68.0% of patients), due to laboratory mistake (50% and 60%) or cold antibodies (16.7% and 12%), respectively. Discussion: Features of non-specific reactivity depended on sex, age, positive antibody test, diagnosis and, moreover, used techniques, sometimes in very distinctive manner. This analysis might be of considerable help in planning of laboratory tests, but also in quick analysis of unexpected results and choice of further testing, particularly in urgent situations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1356, "end": 1367, "text": "(untreated)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-268 Reduction or lack of reactivity of anti-Vel with dithiothreitol (DTT)-treated red cells BE ISRAEL, D FIGUEROA-RODRIGUEZ, TB KAUFMAN, JL OSUCH, KD KITCHEN and S CAGLIOTI Blood Systems Laboratories, Tempe, USA"}, {"text": "Background: Worldwide screen and type is a very usual method for pre-transfusional testing. The ultimate objective is to prevent not only the clinically expressed delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions but also the serologically revealed ones. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of red blood cell (RBC) alloantibodies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or cardiac procedure, during the pre-transfusion screening. Materials and methods: Blood samples of 16 291 patients (12 628 male and 3663 female) were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 57 years. Pre-transfusion samples were examined for clinically significant alloantibodies, using antibody screening with gel test (Liss -enzyme). In case of a positive result, identification was performed (panel with autologous control). In addition, the serological testing included cold agglutinins\u00b4 detection (tube test), as well as titration (tube test) and identification (gel test) in case of a positive result. When the result was marginal (1/32) a new test was carried out after a seven days period. In the presence of a positive autologous control or an autoantibody, samples were examined with Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT). Results: Alloantibodies were detected in 580 patients with the incidence of 3.56%. Antibodies were registered more frequently in females (190/3663, 5.18%) than in males (390/12 628, 3.09%). 183 patients (31.49%) developed single antibody with anti-Kell being the most frequent. The incidence and the specificity of the detected antibodies are summarized in the following table (Table 1 ). In 23 patients (3.96%) multiple antibodies were detected, with most frequent the anti-D and anti-C combination. 35 patients (6.03%) were DAT positive.

Before the introduction of prophylactic anti-D, it was reported that 3% of the total Haemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN) cases were due to anti-c. Currently, cases of HDN due to anti-c are half as frequent as anti-D and 14% of the UK population are Rhc negative. We present two unusual cases of pregnant women who are D and c negative and have anti-c and anti-D detected in their serum. Case studies and results: Case 1: A 38-year-old Asian woman had three previous uneventful pregnancies. In her 4th pregnancy she presented with miscarriage at 19 weeks gestation. She was group B, D and c negative. Her serum contained anti-c and anti-D. Anti-D was detected by LISS tube IAT and anti-c was only detected by manual polybrene technique (0.9 iu/ml by quantification using R2R2 cells). In a 5th pregnancy, no antibodies were detected until 34 weeks gestation when this patient presented in early labour. Anti-c was then detected by two-stage papain technique only as well as anti-D. Case 2: A 33-year-old Asian woman had a positive antibody screen post caesarean section in Jan 2005. No antibody had been detected during the pregnancy. Standard prophylactic anti-D was given at 28 and 34 weeks gestation as this patient was D Neg. Anti-c and anti-D were confirmed in her serum. The anti-c level was 0.7 iu/ml using rr cells and the anti-D level was <0.1 iu/ml using R1R1 cells (prophylactic anti-D Ig). She was phenotyped as O r\u00a2r\u00a2. At delivery the baby was found to have a negative DAT and was phenotyped as r\u00a2r. Discussion: Cde/Cde (r\u00a2r\u00a2) is an uncommon phenotype in the UK population with a frequency of 1/10 000. In routine antenatal testing, ABO/D grouping is only performed for pregnant women at booking and 28 weeks gestation according to BCSH guidelines. Full Rh phenotyping is not carried out unless the pregnant women has a positive antibody screen. In routine testing of the above cases, this extremely rare phenotype is missed. Prophylactic anti-D was given to both patients and immunisation due to anti-D was prevented.

The clinically significant allo-antibody Anti-Fya is rarer in our local population. It occurs predominantly in Malays and Indians and usually in combination with other antibodies.

The possible explanation for the failure to detect low frequency antibodies is that Ortho screen cells do not consistently carry the low frequency antigens Cw and Kpa. Positive screen tests detected by AV only, can be explained either by the fact that antibody identification was carried out on DM panels, or these are false positive reactions.

METHODS: AB0 grouping was performed with registered Immucor reagents (Immuclone: anti-A Birma 1, anti-B LB2) by slide and tube tests. Neutralizing effect was quantified by (i) inhibition od anti-B reaction by titrated patient's serum; and (ii) inhibition of titrated anti-A and anti-B reagents by patient's serum, compared to AB serum of a healthy donor. Results: Slide test: unwashed rbcs: group A, washed rbcs: AB. Tube test (washed rbcs): AB. Titrated patient's serum when added in aliquot to anti-B reagent inhibited agglutination up to titre 64.

Conclusion: Pancreas is known as rich source of blood group specific substances. Malignant transformation is known to be associated with either loss or re-expression of cell-bound ABH antigens. Reported excessive increase of B substance in group AB patient could be either due to loss of A-transferase activity in malignant pancreas cells or isolated increase of B-transferase activity.

A new technology is evaluated in comparison to standard methods. Materials and methods: We used column agglutination technology with the Innova AutoVue System, Ortho, Ratrian N.J. According to the manufacturers this system provides priority to the management of the STAT samples while the random access feature of the system enhances the system throughput. It provides an extended test menu as well as automated antibody identification with the red cells panels. The AutoVue Innova system supports the bi-directional communication with the LIS interface for all the tests including the crossmatches and it provides a continuous traceability and notifying of the instrument's status concerning either the required and available resources or the proper function of the system's submodules. In this study we performed 1423 tests including forward and reverse ABO group, Rh type and phenotype and Kell in randomly selected blood donors, as well 895 tests in haematological patients for antibody screening using an untreated three-cell panel and autocontrol in the indirect antiglobulin test (IAT). The results and the time performance (specimen handing, operation of testing and recording of results) were compared with those obtained by the semiautomatic ID-Diamed gel agglutination microtyping system and by standard manual methods. Results: Test results showed 100% agreement between all three methods. 68 samples were tested per 60 min with the AutoVue Innova, compared to 90 min required for the same number of tests performed with manual testing and 70 min with the semi-automated method. The technical execution was easy with the AutoVue Innova procedure and it appears that the consumption of testing reagents is smaller with the automated system comparing with the other methods. Computerization of the test results with the AutoVue Innova provides an important advantage in record keeping in the blood establishment. Conclusion: Standardization of sample collection and tests performance in pre-transfusion testing, as well as computerized records and time saving are advantages offered by the AutoVue Innova, a new automated column agglutination technology, comparing with a semi-automated and the classical manual methods.

The accumulation of autologous IgG on RBC membrane provides a direct mechanism for the removal of Senescent (Se) RBC. An alternative pathway, immunoglobulin-independent, with participation of sialic acid, has been proposed. The physiological elimination of SeRBC might be modified by individual's age. Aim of the study: to investigate in young and old individuals, the interaction between monocytes and different erythrocytes suspensions: SeRBC, RBC stored with or without serum and desialinized RBC. Methods: healthy individuals blood samples (20-40 years old, n = 50 and > 70 years old, n = 49) were studied. Different suspensions from each sample were obtained: (i) Se and Young (Y) RBC by differential centrifugation; (ii) RBC stored with its own serum (RBCS) and without serum (RBCwS); and (iii) RBC desialinized with neuraminidase (Ne) and tripsine (T). The suspensions were subjected to the erythrophagocytosis assay: peripheral blood monocytes were incubated with the different erythrocyte suspensions for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. Two hundred cells were analyzed to determine the percentage of active monocytes (AM) with phagocytosed and adherent red cells. Non sensitized RBC (NRBC) and ex vivo sensitized RBC (SRBC) were used as negative and positive controls respectively. Results: the% of AM obtained with old individuals were: SeRBC: 21.9 + 1.0, YRBC: 2.9 + 1.2, RBCS: 16.2 + 1.4, RBCwS: 3.1 + 0.8, NeRBC: 11.1 + 1.3, TRBC: 3.2 + 1.1, NRBC: 3.0 + 1.2; SRBC: 31.2 + 1.8. The values of AM obtained with young individuals were: SeRBC: 17.1 + 1.5, YRBC: 3.1 + 0.9, RBCS: 11.1 + 1.1, RBCwS: 2.8 + 1.2, NeRBC: 10.8 + 1.4, TRBC: 3.5 + 1.0. NRBC: 2.9 + 1.3; SRBC: 30.5 + 1.7. Conclusions: No differences in the% of AM were found when compared to positive and negative controls, indicating that this assay would not detect variations in the phagocytic activity of monocytes from young and old donors. The values of AM with SeRBC were higher (P < 0.001) than those obtained with YRBC in both populations analysed. The rate of erythrophagocytosis with SeRBC in old individuals was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than that obtained in young donors. The increase observed may be due to agedependent changes of RBC that occur with human ageing. The% of AM with RBCS were higher (P < 0.001) in old individuals. No modifications were observed with RBCwS. The significant increase in the rate of erythrophagocytosis with SeRBC and RBCS show the involvement of autologous IgG in the selective removal of erythrocytes. These values were higher in old individuals indicating that this process would increase in aged donors. The tripsine activity was not enough to modify the% AM. The values of AM obtained with neuraminidase treated RBC were higher than those observed with YRBC (P < 0.001). However these values were similar between young and old individuals, suggesting that the desialylation would not participate in the increased removal of erythrocytes observed in old donors. Cell-cell adhesion is a crucial phenomenon for the relationship between the cell and its environment. Therefore, the development of experimental methods to obtain quantitative parameters of cellular adhesion is important. Erythrocytes are widely available and their membrane properties are well known, so these cells are used as an ideal model for studying the cellular interaction mechanisms. The study of the formation and break-up of receptor-ligand bonds in sheared erythrocyte suspensions is a subject of considerable importance in the blood circulation, where formation and break-up of blood cell aggregates occur in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions. The main two objectives of this work were to study the cellular adhesion phenomenon using erythrocyte adhesion mediated by monoclonal anti-A antibody as a model and to achieve quantitative values of the parameters involved in the intercellular binding and its possible relationship with cellular deformability parameters. Agglutinates of two A erythrocytes (doublets) induced by specific monoclonal antibodies anti-A were used. Adhesion energy was indirectly quantified by the study of doublet dissociation under the effect of a given shear stress using a controlled flow chamber system. The chamber was installed on the stage of an optical inverted microscope (Union Optical, magnification 100\u00a5) in such a way that the cover glass was the floor of the microchannel. A CCD (charge coupled device) camera was placed in the ocular tube of the microscope and connected to a Digital Image Processor (IPPLUS System) to digitize, record and analyze microscopic images.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-279"}, {"text": "The doublets were initially immobilized inside the chamber, and then put under different shear stress values by a controlled laminar flow during a definite time. In this way, a shear stress parallel to the contact surface between both cells was applied, observing that the upper cell detached progressively with time and also with a gradual rise of the shear stress. The sequential microscopical images were registered and digitally processed, measuring the geometrical dimensions that the cells acquire during the deformation process, and the dissociation of the antigen-antibody bond. Digital image processing allows the analysis and the quantification of the red blood cells doublets dissociation phenomenon. These results show that, while the shear stress applied is raised, the contact area between both cells diminishes. The obtained parameters give important information that lead to the estimation of the value of adhesion energy between two red blood cells agglutinated by monoclonal antibodies. As consequence, they will allow the characterization of the antibodies used, since it would evaluate their association capacity with cellular antigens. Glycophorins (GP) A, B and C are abundant transmembrane integral proteins in red blood cell (RBC). Their highly glycosylated nature and high sialic acid content account for the net negative charge of mature RBC membrane, which is physiologically important because it impedes any tendency to stick together in the circulation. In this study, we have tested anti-GP specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) as primary antibody to directly agglutinate RBC. FRET technique has been developed to characterize the hemoagglutination based on the interaction of fluorophores (Alexa488TM, DiO and DiI) located in the RBC membrane or combined to secondary antibody directed against the primary agglutining MoAb. Combined intensity (spectral) and Lifetime (FLIM) Imaging was used to discriminate the FRET signal of molecules on their different lifetimes whereas their emission spectra overlap (Alexa488TM or DIO/DiI) as independent phenomena of the fluorophore concentration and photobleaching. Furthermore, GP-cytoskeleton interactions were analyzed by 3D-fluorescence microscopy after lipid extraction with Triton X-100 in red cell. All the antibody used was found to directly agglutinate the human RBC. In view of the fluorescence properties depicted in RBC for the pair of fluorophore Alexa-488TM (donor) and DiI (acceptor), it may be expected that upon agglutination of RBC, effective FRET should be observed. FLIM in dynamic-state provides a discrimination of molecules in their fluorescence lifetime, which allows to evaluate the underlying mechanism of energy transfer process in the agglutinated erythrocytes. The results demonstrate that's upon excitation at 780 nm the FLIM-FRET from Alexa488TM to DiI for the anti-GPB MoAbs only with a lifetime distribution in the picosecond range. Similarly, effective FRET was not observed for the anti-GPA MoAbs. The contrast in measured lifetime image is a reliable indicator for spatial variations in donor-acceptor association. 3D-fluorescence microscopy images showed interactions between GPC or GPB and cytoskeleton and did not show interactions between GPA and cytoskeleton. All together, these results only revealed by FRET-FLIM and 3D-fluorescence microscopy strongly support the importance of the specific reactivity with Glycophorin A or B of agglutining MoAb.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-280"}, {"text": "Introduction: The frequency of alloimmunization to red blood cell antigens in transfused sickle cell patients can range from 10 to 40%, but the development of autoantibodies is much less recognized and descried.

The use of adequate transfusion regime for these patients not only prolongs their lives but also promotes normal physical development of the children and improves the quality of their lives. However, necessity to do multiple transfusions increases a risk of post-transfusion reactions and complications due to alloimmunization to RBC antigens.

Objective: Examine the distribution of RBC antigens among thalassemic patients and blood donors. Methods: 108 blood samples of homozygous betta-thalassemia patients (who stayed at the daytime inpatient wards of Scientific Research Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology Baku, Azerbaijan) and 1690 blood donors of Azeri nationality were examined. 108 patients' blood samples were typed on RBC Rh (C, c, D, E, e) and Kell (K, k) antigens.

The similar picture was observed in relation to ccDee and ccDEe phenotypes, which occurred more frequently among donors (11.8% and 10.6%) than in thalassemic patients (6.86% and 2.94%). Additionally, the results demonstrated that K antigen of the Kell system was not detected in the thalassemic patients whereas k antigen was detected in all the patients.

The fact of the discovered absence of antigen K in homozygous bthalassemic patients makes it possible to assume, that this group of patients suffer from scarcity along the Kell system, like the scarcity in McLeod syndrome.

Tessa thorp RCI national blood service Manchester UK TM THORP National Blood Service, Manchester, UK Introduction: Sickle haemoglobin is caused by a genetic mutation in codon 6 of the beta globin gene, resulting in the conversion of glutamic acid to valine. When critical amounts of polymer accumulate within the sickled erythrocyte cellular injury results. Clinically sickle cell disease is characterised by chronic haemolysis and intermittent vaso-occlusion. Mold et al. demonstrated that deoxygenation and sickling of erythrocytes is related to membrane phospholipid changes and these changes result in the activation of the alternative complement pathway. Aim: The objective of this study was to measure the amount of C3c and C3d bound in vivo to red cells of homozygous and heterozygous sickle cell patients. These levels were then compared to 'normal' sickle negative blood donors. Haemoglobin levels and red cell morphology were also examined for signs of active haemolysis. The hypothesis was that an increase in red cell bound complement in vivo could provide an indication of hyperhaemolysis syndrome is sickle patients. Method: Flow cytometric analysis using rabbit anti-C3c or anti-C3d and FITC labelled goat anti-rabbit was developed using a Beckman EPICS XLMCL flow cytometer. Control samples were prepared using a fruitstone buffer technique of complement coating. Results: A total of 16 heterozygous sickle patients and 11 homozygous patients were analysed. Of the 11 homozygous patients analysed only one was undergoing a sickle crisis. A positive result was indicated if the mean trait or homozygous sample was coated with complement to a greater degree that the mean normal donor plus two standard deviations. The results obtained in this research project indicate an increase in C3c levels bound to red cells of homozygous sickle patients in vivo. Statistical analysis of results obtained suggest that there was no increase in C3d levels in either sickle trait or homozygous sickle patients. Conclusion: These findings support research carried out by Mold et al. (1995) and are present in more than 90% of Caucasian population. It has been reported that anti-Chido and anti-Rogers don't cause hemolitic reaction but may be responsible for life-threatening anaphylactic reaction during transfusion of plasma proteins. Case report: positive IAT and DAT were detected in a 34 years old Swedish woman, A Rh negative, at 34th week of pregnancy. Previous IAT and DAT determinations were negative. At time of detection DAT wsa weakly positive and IgG subclasses identified. Antibody identification revealed the presence of high titre (1 : 64) anti-Chido and anti-Rogers antibodies. A slight decrease in platelet count (from 210.000/ul to 80.000/ul) was observed. This pattern showed no variation until the end of the pregnancy. At 39th week a healthy baby was delivered, DAT negative. The mother DAT and IAT remained positive for four months after delivery. The platelets count raised again to 200.000/ul. The same laboratory findings were detected in a Previuos pregnancy in Sweden. The patient reported the presence of antibodies at 35th week that disappeared few months after delivery. A healthy baby, DAT negative was delivered in this case too. Conclusions: this is the first report of the presence of Chido and Rogers as autoantibodies during the last months of pregnancy. The association with decrease in platelets count and the lack of evident clinical symptoms need further investigation. P-289 RBC alloantibody frequency and their prevalence within Chinese, Malay and Indian community in Singapore E WIDJAJA, MBC KOH and D TEO Health Science Authority, Singapore, Singapore Background and aim: There is a recognised existence of different alloantibodies in different ethnic groups. While this has been studied in the Caucasian population, their frequencies remain less well documented in the Asian population. The frequency of different alloantibodies and their distribution in terms of age, sex in Singapore population is studied, as were their prevalence within the Chinese, Malay and Indian races in Singapore. Design and method: We conducted a retrospective study for the frequency of 28 alloantibodies on 1856 blood samples over 2004. These blood samples were largely sent by hospitals where preliminary antibody screening had been done and positive result obtained. They were sent to the Centre for Transfusion Medicine for antibody identification. Small number of these samples came from hospitals where preliminary antibody testing was not done. The antibody distribution across different ethnic groups (Chinese, Malays, Indians) age and sex were studied. Results: The most frequent alloantibodies in the population is Mia (40.7%), E (20%), Le a (17.5%), Le b (14.8%), P1 (6.1%), M (5.4%), D (4.5%), c (2.7%), Jka (1.9%) and C (1.4%). Within the Chinese community, the most frequent alloantibodies were similar: Mia (51.9%), E (24.1%), Le a (11%), Le b (8.8%) and P1 (6.1%). In the Malays, the most frequent alloantibodies were Le a (35%), Le b (26.4%), Mia (24.2%), E(13.4%) and P1 (8.2%); while in the Indians, these were Mia (28.9%), Le b (28.9%), Le a (27.8%), D (17.5%), and E (12.4%), with the anti-D reflecting the higher incidence of Rh D negativity in the Indians race. For the lower incidence antibodies, anti-c was more common in the Malays and Indians (4%) compared to Chinese (1.9%). Anti Jka tended to occur mainly in the Malay race and anti-C was rare in all (<2%) reflecting the high prevalence of C in the Singapore population (R1R1 phenotype). The ratio of alloimmunised male to female (M : F) is 1 : 3. Most alloantibodies demonstrated significant skewing towards to the female, although relatively less so for Mia where M : F ratio is almost equal at 1 : 1.9. Alloimmunisation increased with age for Mia, E, K, P1, Jka and Fyb while the frequency of alloimmunisation to Lea, Leb, D, M and C decresed with age. The prevalence of patients with multiple alloantibodies (2 or more) within the alloimmunised subjects is 21.7%.

Conclusion: (i) A normal RhD protein does not exist in a Del individual with RHD 1227A allele since the exon 9 was always spliced out in all isoforms. All 6 transcripts in Del maintain a normal open reading frame and encode 6 proteins with different numbers of amino acid residues and different C-terminals (GenBank AY751491, AY751492, AY751493, AY751494, AY751495, AY751496). Among them, the sequence of Del9 (isoform with exon 9 spliced) transcript was the most similar as normal RhD mRNA. This isoform was first described by Chang et al. in Taiwan in 1998 . It encodes 463 amino acid residues and has 46 amino acids more than normal RhD. It is different from RhD after codon 384. In normal RhD protein, the amino acids after 384 (33 residues) are mainly the trans-membrane and intracellular regions. Therefore a further study on if a Del red cell possesses all epitopes of normal D antigen may be significative. (ii) A normal Rh-positive individual has also the transcript of Del9 that was found in Del. (iii) There is only one polymorphism in the region of 170 bp segment between RHD intron 7 and 2 of the Del transcripts, which indicated that other polymorphisms may exist in intron 7 of RHD 1227A allele compared RHD to explain that this situation was not happened in normal Rh-positive individuals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1506, "end": 1536, "text": "Chang et al. in Taiwan in 1998", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "total WBC were enumerated by flow cytometry and cell counting.

NAITP is a rare clinical syndrome characterized by marked thrombocytopenia shortly after birth. It is caused by maternal immunization against paternally inherited antigens present on foetal platelets. Screening and identification of antibodies in the maternal blood sample is the main support in the diagnosis and management of NAITP.

The infants with HPA 1 immunization suffered from severe (Plt count 5-103/ml) and symptomatic NAITP (bleeding and petechiae were present), therefore they were treated with platelet transfusion and administration of high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin. We confirm that NAITP due to HPA-5 and HLA immunization is clinically less severe: all neonates had mild and self limiting thrombocytopenia at birth; no therapy was administered. It would be advisable to carry out pre-natal screening, at reasonable cost, using maternal serum versus paternal platelets and to proceed to the identification of antibodies only in presence of positive results. Background: Fetal or neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FMAIT) results from a maternal alloimmunization against fetal platelet antigens. It is the commonest cause of severe thrombocytopenia in the neonatal period. The diagnosis of FMAIT is made initially on clinical grounds, depending on exclusion of other causes of neonatal thrombocytopenia. In Caucasians, HPA-1a is the most frequently implicated antigen. Other antigens such as HPA-3a, or HPA-4a are less often implicated. During the past few years FMAIT has been reported associated with rare or private antigens. The diagnosis is straightforward when a maternal alloantibody with a corresponding parental antigen incompatibility is present. However it could be equivocal in the absence of such an antibody or difficult when a private antigen is implicated. If the father is heterozygous for the considered antigen, the infant's platelet typing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Due to the risk of hemorrhage, particularly intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), during the course of severe thrombocytopenia, specific therapy is mandatory. Because subsequent siblings may be more severely affected, accurate diagnosis will allow better management of subsequent pregnancies. Study design and methods: Since the first documented case of feto-maternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FMAIT) due to anti HPA-9bw (Maxa+), no additional cases have been reported. We present here a retrospective analysis of the cases referred to our laboratories in recent years. Since 1999 we have screened for rare or private antigens in suspected cases of FMAIT when there is no incompatibility for the most frequently implicated antigens. The diagnosis was performed by genotyping and identification of the maternal alloantibody by the MAIPA technique. Results: Parental genotyping showed HPA-9bw (Maxa+) mismatch as the sole antigenic incompatibility in 7 out of 8 families. In the last one, incompatibility was found for HPA-3 without anti HPA-3b maternal alloantibody. As the father was found to be HPA-9bw (Maxa+) heterozygous in all the cases, the infant or fetus was genotyped to ascertain the diagnosis. The maternal alloantibody was identified in the MAIPA technique. However, our data strongly suggest that recognition of the HPA-9bw (Maxa+) epitope is not uniform. The neonatal thrombocytopenia was severe in most cases with bleeding. The outcome was good in all the cases but one.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "Conclusion: This analysis confirms that anti HPA-9bw (Maxa+) FMAIT is not uncommon and was found to be around 2% of our confirmed FMAIT cases with parental incompatibilities and presence of maternal alloantibodies. It is a clinically severe syndrome which requires prompt diagnosis, albeit difficult, and maternal platelet transfusion therapy. Laboratory investigation of a suspected FMAIT case should be carried out in a specialist laboratory wellexperienced in optimal testing. Therapy requires strict collaboration between clinicians and blood bank services. Appropriate management and antenatal therapy should be considered for successive pregnancies to prevent fetal bleeding. Introduction: The human platelet (plt) antigen (HPA) system is independent of the HLA system. Therefore, host-or donor derived alloimmune thrombocytopenia can develop after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) even in HLAmatched donor-recipient pairs. We report the first case on a stem cell recipient developing thrombocytopenia due to host-derived HPA-1a antibodies after non-myeloablative allogeneic HSCT. A 52year-old male patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 6/2003. Treatment consisted of 3 cycles vincristin, adriamycin and dexamethason followed by tandem autologous stem cell transplantation. Because of progressive disease he received 4 cycles of bortezomib, and after complete remission a stem cell allograft (7.99 \u00a5 106/kgBW CD34 + cells) from his histocompatible (HLA A,B,C,DR identical) brother after reduced intensity conditioning regimen with fludarabine (3 \u00a5 30 mg/m 2 ) and alkeran (100 mg/m 2 ). He had received only twice packed red blood cell concentrates and one plt concentrate before allogeneic HSCT. Stable bilinear engraftment occurred around d12 but was accompanied with a continuous decrease of plt counts. Between d10 and d19 the patient received seven plt transfusions, containing a median of 2.96 \u00a5 1011 plt/unit (range 2,7-3,21 \u00a5 1011 plt/unit) from random donors. The corrected plt count increments at 12 to 24 h after these transfusions were <2500/ml. Therefore, and because of even a further decline of platelet counts to 1000/ml on d19 we investigated the presence of plt antibodies. Methods: The patient's serum was tested by antigen capture ELISA assays (PAKPLUS\u00ae and PAK1\u00ae, GTI) and a solid phase assay (Capture-P\u00ae, Immucor). The MAIPA assay was used to confirm the results obtained by the above mentioned assays. In addition, we tested the patient's serum by the MASPAT kit (CLB) against plt from the donor and against homozygous HPA-1a plt obtained from our donor pool.

Five years before, she had had a first pregnancy with IUGR of the fetus but no NAIT. The second neonate weighted 1.350 g, was 41.0 cm tall and had a head circumference of 27.5 cm. The APGAR score was 9,10,10,10 at 1, 3, 5 and 10 min respectively after birth. No bleeding, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or infectious signs were noted. Five hours after birth, a respiratory distress syndrome appeared and an oxygenotherapy was performed during 44 h.

Because of the clinical signs and of the decreasing PLT count the mother's serum was tested for PLT-specific Ab by immunocapture and the Ab identified by the monoclonal Ab-specific immobilization of PLT antigen (MAIPA) assay.

Introduction: Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NATP) due to maternal immunization against fetal platelet antigens affects 0.8-1 in 1000 live births. Although it is usually a self-limiting condition, a major complication in cases of severe thrombocytopenia is the occurrence of intracranial haemorrhage leading to death (in up to 10% of reported cases). The commonest antibodies are anti-HPA-1a. Treatment consists of IVIG, compatible donor platelet concentrates or washed maternal platelets. The administration of random donor platelet transfusions is controversial but has been used successfully in some urgent cases when compatible platelets were not available. Case report: A baby born in week 40 of gestation to a healthy mother after first uneventful pregnancy; birth weight 3000 g, Apgar score 8. Immediately after birth, severe thrombocytopenia (7 \u00a5 109/L) and signs of haemorrhagic diathesis (generalized petechiae and ICH gr. II-III) were observed. Coagulation tests were abnormal and K-vitamin, fresh frozen plasma and random donor platelet concentrate (retrospectively genotyped as HPA-1a/a) were given. Twenty-four hours later platelet count rose to 26 \u00a5 109/L and no new petechiae were observed. On third day of life the blood platelet count was 13 \u00a5 109/L and the newborn received IVIG 2 g/kg and corticosteroides. Twenty-four hours later the platelet count rose to 107 \u00a5 109/L and further clinical course was uneventful. NATP due to HPA-1a was serologically confirmed. Conclusion: Optimal therapy for an infant with severe thrombocytopenia during the first 24 h of life is the transfusion of platelets that will not be destroyed by the maternal alloantibody in the infant circulation. Random donor platelet concentrates are controversial in a setting where optimal treatment is not available, however, in this case they led to a significant platelet count improvement in spite of HPA-1a incompatibility. Accordingly, random donor platelets may be considered appropriate in emergency situations. Background: RhD is the most immunogenic blood group antigen, and its correct identification is essential in the blood bank and in the prevention of the haemolytic disease of the newborn. The weak D phenotype is the most common D variant, with a frequency of 0.2% to 1% in Caucasian individuals. There are several weak D types, with different frequencies in European countries, which may pose serologic problems and have the potential for alloimmunization. The objective of the study was to determine the frequency of the principal weak D types in Portugal. Study design and methods: Lisbon Regional Centre of the Portuguese Blood Institute and Oporto S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o University Hospital selected samples from blood donors and patients. RhD was tested by two (Oporto) or three (Lisbon) distinct anti-sera, in direct agglutination tests, at room temperature. When discrepant results were observed, the samples were tested with panels of monoclonal anti-D by LISS-IAT. Samples that reacted weakly with IgM anti-D but positive with IgG anti-D were sent to the Molecular Biology Centre. PCR with sequence-specific primers was performed using two commercially available kits (Inno-Train and BAGene). Real-time PCR, carried out on a Light Cycler, was applied when the interpretation was dubious. Results: 101 samples were referred after being characterized as weak D.

Misinterpretation of test results -e.g. overlooking RHD category -decreases depending on the number of examinated RHD-specific exons. Case report: A 28-year old mother (w.o.g. 23) pregnant with twins was regularly tested for irregular antibodies and was shown to have an Anti-D. After amniocentesis of both foetuses tests for the occurrence of RHD intron 4, exons 7 and 10 were performed in the hospital's lab. The sample of fetus I showed PCR-products for intron 4, exon 7 and exon 10 while sample of fetus II lacked RHD-specific intron 4. Therefore we investigated blood samples from the parents as well as amniocentic fluid of both foetuses. Methods: Total DNA was amplified in a multiplex PCR with fluorogenic primers for RHD exons 2-7, 9 & 10; polymorphisms for Dweak type 1-5, D-VII, D-HMi and RHCE polymorphisms for C, c, Cw, E, e.

Weak D type 1 was identified in 2 CN, weak D type 2 was identified in 1 CN and weak D type 4 was found in 1 CN, 3 BSA, 4 BE, 1 BC and 1 SAA. Conclusions: Although weak D types 1 to 3 represent the majority of all weak D phenotypes in Caucasian populations, none of these weak D alleles were found in Black populations. Since none of the frequent weak D types were identified in non-Caucasians one might not expected to find type 4 in all populations. However, regarding RHD phylogeny, the weak D type 4 mutations (602C > G and 667T > G) form the basis of a cluster of aberrant alleles that are predominantly observed in blacks.

Allelespecific PCR, RFLP, direct sequencing of exon 6 and 7, and allele separation were performed on these samples. Results: ABO*A205 allele was observed in an Aint subgroup. Two new A alleles that showed 784G > A base change and 990C > T of intron 6 and a polymorphism of 532C > T in A(pro) intron 5 were discovered. O04 and O20 alleles were also observed. In B subgroups, a silent substitution 255C > T (Leu85Leu) was observed as a new B allele. Another new B allele which showed 547G > A was also found in 4 B subgroups.

The approach of multiplexgenotyping using PCR-SSP has apparently technical constraints so we are currently analyzing whether a modification using SNaPshot PCR-technique could provide a routine application for such purposes. Compared to SSP-technique, the SNaPshot PCR only requires one single primer (labeling reaction) for the detection of two (or more) alleles instead of one pair of primers for every single allele. Briefly, we perform SNaPshot PCR as follows: In a first step, DNA segments covering the essential polymorphic regions for the ABO, RHD, KEL, JK and FY genes are amplified using a standard PCR step. After purification treatment of the PCR products (Roche High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit or shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP)/Exo1 treatment according to the ABI Prism SNaPshot Multiplex Kit protocol) the labeling reaction is performed using the ABI Prism SNaPshot Multiplex Kit. After a second purification step the products are analyzed on a ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyser in fragment analysis mode. Our preliminary results show the feasibility of this approach as reliable typing results can be obtained for all tested single nucleotide polymorphisms corresponding to alleles. Generally a better signal quality from controls and samples is obtained compared to the SSP-technique with consecutive gel electrophoresis. We also consider the possibility of the automated interpretation of the results as an important improvement, especially when aiming for an application for a large number of samples (donors) or markers (patients). In contrast, the method involves more manual steps and higher costs. We may conclude that the implementation of SNaPshot-PCR techniques for red cell marker genotyping is a promising alternative to PCR-SSP.

They are generally used in the recognition and quantification of very small amounts of biological substances (hormones, enzymes) present in a solution, Ag identification, blood group determination, oncology, organs transplant, etc. MoAb can be characterized by its specificity and affinity. Affinity may be expressed as the equilibrium association constant (K). Several techniques are available to determine the equilibrium constant of the Ag-Ab interaction. In this work, is shown an optical sensor for monoclonal antibody quantification by reflectometry technique. The laser reflectometry technique (null ellipsometry technique) can give information about the kinetic of the interactions, stoichiometry of molecular binding and the concentration of molecules in a solution, and also offers detailed and accurate determinations of real-time adsorption kinetics of protein without labeling. A silicon wafer was chosen as reflectant surface. Once fixed the principal angle of incidence, an amount of anti-AB is added to the sample. The reflected laser intensity is registered in real time as the protein is being adsorbed onto the wafer. The mathematical analysis of the results verifies that the antibodies adsorption follows Langmuir's kinetics. From the curve analysis, the parameters related to the anti-AB concentration are extracted. From them, the calibration curve is constructed.

Material and method: On September 2003, (9/28/2003), we admitted to our hospital through air-carriage, a female of 22 years old, badly injured after a car-accident. The patient was on an olighemic shock (Ht: 16%) due to retroperitoneal, paracolic and procystic hematomas, had multiple fractures on the left feet, the main important of which was an acetabulum one. She had a blood group: O, D-and her phenotype was ccdee with Du-. After her arrival she was urgently admitted to the surgery room and our blood bank was asked for condensed red cells. Initially she was transfused with blood of the same group (O, D-) but when we were short out of Dblood, we were asked for 7 more units. The necessity of blood was imperative, the patient was on a critical condition and the mechanism of blood transport, from another blood bank would take some time to be put in motion, and so it was decided that the patient would be provided with D+ blood. The indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) and papaine were negative, so there would be no problem with the transfusion with D+ blood. The patient received finally 3 units (850 ml) of D+ condensed red cells, out of 7 that were initially asked. Before the 48h from the surgery had passed, it was decided that human anti-D immunoglobulin (Rhesogamma P) should be provided, in order to prevent the sensitization of the patient to Rh0(D). The indicted dose was 500-1250 IU/10 ml of the transfused blood, provided piecemeal during a several days period. analyzed by real-time PCR amplification. Based on a published report, we selected 12 primer pairs targeting insertion/deletion polymorphisms which are located on different chromosomes, unrelated to each other and not associated with immunocompatibility. We optimized the amplification conditions for all 12 primer pairs using our SYBR green real-time quantitative PCR protocols, and investigated analytical sensitivity for each primer pair by performing spiking studies, in which a single copy of positive DNA was added into 100 000 copies of negative DNA followed by allele-specific PCR amplification. We also created a theoretical panel of donor-recipient pairs (n = 73) to evaluate the clinical sensitivity for detection of TA-MC using both HLA-DR and InDel panels. Results: For the short-term samples, 10 additional MC cases was identified in Non-LR group using InDel panel; and one additional MC case was detected in LR group (Table 1) . For the long-term follow-up samples, 4 additional MC cases were found. When evaluating analytical sensitivity, we were able to detect a single copy of positive DNA mixed with 100 000 copies of negative DNA in a single amplification tube for all 12 primer pairs. We were also able to calculated the clinical sensitivity that using 73 donor-recipient pairs. 99.5% of donor-recipient had at least one informative allele for detection of TA-MC if we consider both HLA-DR and InDel panels. Conclusion: Using our new InDel panel, we were able to detect more instances of MC in this cohort of patients. We conclude that the DR assay underestimates the presence of MC.

Introduction: Because of improvements in surgical techniques, preoperative autologous blood donation (PABD) in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy (RP) is contested. Aim of the study: We wanted to develop and validate an algorithm to determine the patients who probably do not benefit from PABD. Methods: We calculated the perioperative Hb-loss of 153 consecutive patients (group 1) who donated two red cell units (RBC) of autologous blood 5 and 4 weeks before undergoing RP: Hb-loss (g) = preop-Hb \u00a5 BV + (n RBC \u00a5 65) -(postop-Hb \u00a5 BV) (BV = blood volume (L) = body weight (kg) \u00a5 0.08; postop-Hb = Hb (12-18 h after RP); n RBC = number of transfused autologous and allogeneic RBC). Hb of RBC was taken as 65 g. RBC requirement is probably if initial-Hb -(Hb-loss: BV) -trigger-Hb (taken as 80 g/L) < 0 (initial-Hb = Hb at the first contact with the PABD-unit). This assumption was validated by the next 125 patients who were also assigned for PABD (group 2). PABD was refused if the probability of RBC requirement (PRR) was <25%. Between 25-50% one RBC was taken after considering the patient's individual risk of PABD. If PRR exceeded 50% two donations were planned. Results: Both groups did not significantly differ in age or initial Hb. Preop-and postop-Hb were significantly lower in group 1 (141 vs 151 and 98 vs 111 g/L). 79% of autologous blood of group 1 were discarded, 3/153 patients needed additional allogeneic RBC. Hb-loss caused by RP was 269 \u00b1 111 g. Mean PRR in group 2 was 8.5%. 5/125 patients donated one RBC, which was later discarded, and no patients donated two RBC. 7/125 of group 2 needed allogeneic RBC. Mean PRR of these patients was 12% (range 0.65-33.3). Conclusion: Postop-Hb were lower in RP-patients with PABD because of the lower preop-Hb and the restrictive indication for transfusion of autologous blood. The individual calculation of PRR, for which only body-weight and initial-Hb of the patient are necessary, shows that PABD in patients undergoing RP is indicated only in rare cases.

Basic concept of the therapeutic use of blood components is the compensation of the lacking or deficient blood component. In that way, a possibility of the infusion of unrequired or deleterious components of whole blood is eliminated. Objective of this presentation is to analyze the reasons of non-utilization of certain blood units, the actual quantity and ratio. Aim of the study: The purpose of our in vitro study is to compare storage of platelet concentrates at 4\u00b0C with platelets stored at 22\u00b0C, and to determine the in vitro-effects of pre-incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1h prior to analysis on the basis of the maintenance of platelet metabolic and cellular integrity. Methods: Platelets concentrates (PCs) were prepared from pooled buffy coats (BC) for paired studies to be stored into different conditions. (i) at 20-24 degree on a flat bed agitator; (ii) at 20-24 degree on a flat bed agitator and pre-incubated for 1 h prior to analysis; (iii) at 4\u00b0C; and (iv) at 4\u00b0C and pre-incubated for 1 h prior to analysis. This paired in vitro study (n = 8) over 21 days include volume, platelet counts, MPV, volume, pH, pO 2 , pCO 2 , bicarbonate, glucose, lactate, swirling, leucocytecount, HSR, ESC, ATP, LDH and release of a-granule content (RANTES, \u00df-thromboglobulin and PF4). Results: Platelet count (day 5 and 21; P < 0.05), MPV (day 5; P < 0.01), pH (day 14 and 21; P < 0.01), pCO 2 (day 14 and 21; P < 0.01), bicarbonate (day 21; P < 0.01), glucose (day 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21; P < 0.01), ATP (day 14 and 21; P < 0.01) was significantly higher in platelets stored at 4\u00b0C and platelets stored at 4\u00b0C with preincubation. LDH (day 21; P < 0.01), bicarbonate (day 5 and 7; P < 0.01), lactate (day 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21; P < 0.01), pH (day 5 and 7; P < 0.01), ESC (day 5, 7, 10, and 14; P < 0.05), HSR (day 5, 7 and 14; P < 0.05) was significantly lower in platelets stored at 4\u00b0C and platelets stored at 4\u00b0C with pre-incubation. The concentration of RANTES, \u00df-thromboglobulin and PF4 was significantly higher in platelets stored at 22\u00b0C than in platelets stored at 4\u00b0C (day 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21; P < 0.01). HSR (day 5 and 10; P < 0.05) and ESC (day 5, 7, 10 and 14; P < 0.01) was significantly higher in preincubated platelets stored at 22\u00b0C compared with platelets stored at 22\u00b0C. Conclusion: Platelets stored at 4\u00b0C maintain metabolic and cellular characteristics to a great extent during 21 days of storage. We confirm the loss of platelet discoid shape and have shown that loss of discoid shape in platelets stored at 4\u00b0C is associated with decreased metabolic rate and decreased release of a-granule content. Aim: As reference centre of the Swiss blood transfusion service for new materials and blood products we evaluated that system for routine use and official registration in Switzerland. Method: 20 whole blood donations were collected in a whole blood filtration set with CPDA-1 and stored at room temperature for 1 h before filtration at room temperature. The leucodepleted whole blood was stored for 42 days. Following parameters were analysed on day 0, 35, 42: free haemoglobin in%, K. In addition leucocyte count was performed on day 0 and a blood culture on day 49 (see table) . Blood cultures on day 49 remained negative and all counts of residual leucocytes were below 1 \u00a5 10 (exponential) 6/unit. Summary and conclusion: As expected there was a clear increase in K and free haemoglobin after day 35. However the results were within the required specifications from the European and Swiss guidelines up to day 42. We conclude that autologous leucodepleted whole blood can be stored in CPDA-1-for 42 days without loss of stability of the red cells. We will introduce the system to the offi-cial material list of the Swiss blood transfusion service and then implement the procedure to our daily routine.

Background: Platelet concentrates (PCs) are currently stored for a maximum of 5 days. Extended storage to 7 days would increase the supply and reduce the waste of PCs. Transfusion-associated graftversus-host-disease (TA-GVHD) is a severe transfusion reaction caused by T-lymphocytes in the transfusion product. The risk of developing TA-GVHD can be prevented by gamma irradiation of the PCs. Various in vitro tests can be used to study the quality of PCs such as inspection of the swirling phenomenon, hypotonic shock response (HSR), detection of platelet surface markers (e.g. CD62P and CD42b), metabolic parameters and blood gases. Free oscillation rheometry (FOR) using the instrument ReoRox\u00ae 4 can be used to monitor the coagulation over time in whole blood, PCs and plasma samples, and to obtain information about clotting time and coagulum elasticity. Aim of the study: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of PCs obtained by apheresis technique during storage for 7 days and to study the effect of gamma irradiation by using several in vitro methods including FOR. Methods: Platelets were collected from healthy donors (n = 12) using apheresis technique. The PC from each donor was divided in 2 units, one served as control and the other was gamma irradiated with 25 Gy. The PCs were stored on a flatbed agitator at 22\u00b0C for 7 days. Samples were taken on day 0 (= day of collection) for analysis of blood gases, metabolic parameters (glucose and lactate), platelet count and swirling. Samples taken on day 1, 5 and 7 were also analysed for HRS, CD62P (P-selectin) and CD42b (GpIb) expression utilising flow cytometry. Evaluation of coagulation by FOR was performed on day 1, 5 and 7. The maximum elasticity (G'max) and the time to G' were evaluated from the FOR elasticity curves. Results: There was no difference between irradiated and nonirradiated PCs regarding any of the tested parameters during the storage period. Swirling, HSR, platelet count and percentage of CD42b expressing cells were well maintained for 7 days of storage. Glucose decreased and lactate increased significantly during the storage period, from 2.5 mmol/L to 16.2 mmol/L for lactate and from 16.5 mmol/L to 8.9 mmol/L for glucose. The percent CD62P expressing cells increased significantly during storage from 15% on day 1 to 32% on day 7. pO 2 was well maintained but pH increased and pCO 2 decreased significantly between day 0 and 1 whereafter pH decreased and pCO 2 continued to decrease.

Platelet derived cytokines released during storage upon activation or lysis, accumulate in the platelet products and have been suggested to be involved in transfusion reactions. RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and presumably Secreted) is a chemokine playing an important role in the inflammatory immune response and causes degranulation of eosinophiles and release of histamines from basophiles, which again can cause allergic reactions. TGF-b1 (Transforming growth factor b1) has been shown to be immunosuppressive, inhibits the proliferation of T-and B-lymphocytes and decreases the secretion of IgG and IgM from B-lymphocytes. Aims: As part of our quality control program, we aimed to quantify the amounts of RANTES and TGF-b1 released during storage in platelet concentrates produced from pooled buffy coats by our manual routine method (M-PCs) and by an automated method using the Orbisac System (Gambro) (A-PCs). Methods: PCs were produced from 5 buffy coats. Following overnight storage at 20-22\u00b0C, buffy coats were pooled with 300 ml T-Sol (Baxter). Forty-two PCs were produced either manually (n = 21) using the Imugard III S-PL set (Terumo) with integrated soft leuko-reduction filter or by the automated procedure (n = 21) using the Orbisac Validation BC Set (Gambro) equipped with the LRP6 leuko-reduction filter (Pall). Swirling was scored visually, platelet count and MPV were measured on a cell counter (Cobas Argos, Roche), and blood gas analyses, glucose as well as lactate were measured on an ABL700 Series Analyser (Radiometer).

Thanks to the large-scale banking of unrelated units and the preliminary encouraging results, UCB employ in adults is quickly growing up. In this context, total nucleated cells (TNC) count of the graft is considered the main predictor for clinical outcome; however, other indicators of the haematopoietic potential, such as CD34+ cell content and short-term culture clonogenic assay, are recommended in accordance to Netcord-FACT stan-dards. In order to guarantee the safety and the prompt availability of a UCB unit assigned to a matched recipient, a pattern of rigorous quality controls should be carried out not only at the time of cryopreservation but also before the release for transplant. We report the results of the quality controls performed on thawed cryovials referring to the 26 units delivered by our UCB Bank compared to the pre-freezing values. Methods: Every UCB unit stored in our Bank is accompanied by 3 satellite cryovials available for subsequent controls. For each unit issued for transplantation, one cryotube was thawed in 37\u00b0C water bath with gentle agitation without washing out DMSO. TNC and mononucleated cells (MNC) were estimated by an automated cell counter; viability and CD34+ cell count were evaluated by flow cytometry with a no-wash, single-platform technique and 7aminoactinomycin D. CFU assay was performed using commercial reagents (Methocult GF H4434, StemCell Technologies) and colonies were counted after 14 days. The same tests were performed before cryopreservation, taking a sample from each fresh unit. Moreover, before the delivery for transplant, a second cryotube was thawed to investigate the bacterial contamination by direct microbial culture, whereas the sterility test before freezing was performed by inoculum into 30 ml media (BacT/ALERT\u00aeFA/FN, Biom\u00e9rieux Inc). Results: The UCB characteristics before freezing and after thawing are detailed in the tables 1, 2 and 3. Post-thawing TNC and MNC, as well as CD34+ cells, showed no significant difference in comparison to the pre-freezing values. Despite of the expected decrease of the overall viability after thawing, we observed a highly satisfactory viability referred to the CD34+ cells. The colony forming units (CFU) growth after thawing was documented and was always lower as respect to the pre-freezing assay. Finally, the results of microbial cultures were negative for all the 26 units on both fresh and thawed specimens. Conclusions: In our experience, well standardized evaluation of UCB content could be obtained with regard to TNC, MNC and CD34+ cell. Concerning the results of short-term cultures, the presence of DMSO as inhibiting factor may be advocated to explain the discrepancies between fresh and thawed samples.

Bone marrow has an organized and structured architecture in which close relationships exist between a regulatory microenvironment and primitive hematopoietic cells. In fact, normal hematopoietic cells depends on critical interactions that occur between stem cells and their microenvironment. This microenvironment is a complex meshwork composed of growth factors, stromal cells, and extracellular matrix. Marrow injury can occur as a consequence of a variety of diseases. Some diseases could be due to a microenvironment that fails to support hematopoiesis. A possibility is that aplasia and leukemia share a common etiology such as drug, chemical, radiation, virus or other environmental hazards. We can say that microenvironmental abnormalities in interactions between stromal cells and hematopoietic progenitors may be important in the pathogenesis and clinical expression of hematopoietic malignancies in humans. Background: Intrauterine growth retardation, with associated low birth weight, represents one of the most important cause of baby mortality and morbidity. Understanding the genetic bases of this adverse event is still an open goal. There is evidence that motherchild HLA compatibility and HLA-DRB1 foetal genotype are associated with a reduced placental growth and a low birth weight. The recent institution of Cord Blood Banks, with their huge amount of HLA types, offers an unique opportunity to look inside the molecular bases of normal birth weight. Aims: We investigated whether the baby-linked immunogenetic profile, i.e. HLA gene frequencies and homozygosity rate, affects the physiological variance of the size at birth. Methods: 1868 cord blood units (961 from males and 907 from females) were HLA typed with PCR-SSP and/or reverse PCR-SSO techniques and recorded in the Cord Blood Bank database of Pavia-Italy. All were defined at low resolution level for HLA-A and B genes and at high resolution for HLA-DRB1. 686 blood units were also randomly typed for HLA-DQA1 and DQB1 at high resolution. Results: Mean birth weight was 3430 g and mean relative birth weight (i.e. corrected for gestational age according to the gender) was 0.19 g. 70 babies were <5th centile (2782 g) and 70 were >95th centile (4068 g). Comparing the HLA allele distribution in these extreme bands we found that HLA DRB1*08 was significantly associated with high relative birth weight: 5.1% in 95th centile vs 0.7% in 5th centile, P = 0.032. On the contrary, HLA-DRB1*14 and DQB1*05 were associated with low relative birth weight: 7.9% and 30.4% respectively in 5th centile vs 2.2% and 9.6% in 95th centile P = 0.035 and P = 0.019. All infants were analysed as to the effect of the above mentioned alleles. We confirmed the positive association of HLA-DRB1*08 and higher relative birth weight (mean 0.17 vs 0.08; P = 0.033) as well as the association of HLA-DRB1*14 with lower relative birth weight (mean 0.03 vs 0.27, P = 0.04). No significant association was found as far as HLA homozygosity was concerned. Conclusions: The present findings confirm the role of foetal HLA-DRB1 gene in the intrauterine growth. About the specific involved alleles, one possible explanation comes from the studies of crystallography and amino acid sequencing of HLA-DR binding groove. It has been demonstrated that HLA-DRB1*08 and HLA-DRB1*14 genes encode for different amino acid sequences in the pocket 4 of the molecule (aa 70, 71, 74). This implies distinct functional restriction patterns. The sequence motif of HLA-DR14 is characteristic of some autoimmune conditions, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and preeclampsia which is associated with intrauterine growth retarda- which provides a high yield and excellent purity without lymphocyte and erythrocyte contamination. In a 3 month period, we studied blood samples from bone marrow transplant patients and from normal subjects. The extraction of leukocyte polymorphonuclear was obtained with a 6%-7% dextran solution in 0.8% saline. After incubation at room temperature with lymphopre solution, the mixture was centrifuged. Two clear and separate rings of mononuclear and PMN leukocytes were obtained. To eliminate any red blood cells, PMNL ring was separated and washed three times with cold ammonium chloride. After a short period of incubation 4\u00b0C, mixture was centrifuged and the PMNLs were isolated. The purity and viability of total leukocyte population was counted and the percentage of PMNL obtained was established. The total blood samples studied were divided in two groups, i.e., bone marrow transplant patients and normal subjects. In both cases the PMNs isolated were of high purity and viability. The overall percentage of PMNLs obtained from both groups under study was 98% to 99% when stained with Gimsa or Wright staining method. The viability of isolated PMNLs was also 98% too, which is excellent for numerous immunological or molecular studies. The PMNLs isolated by this method were highly pure and viable in comparison with standard methods used to isolate human PMNLs. Generation a high amount of PMNLs is another advantage of the suggested method. This method to separate PMNLs is recommended for in vitro studies of different subjects. et al. 1950 .)

The origin and the type of antibodies and also factors that influence their presence are to be studied. Introduction: Diagnosis, management and prevention of red blood cell immunization have improved, so hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) has changed from a common to a rare pathology. Aim of the study. In this study we have retrospectively evaluated the benefits of the immunohematological screening for the management of pregnancies with alloimmunization. Methods: In the last 3 years, we have performed an immunohematological screening on all pregnant women assisted by our Hospitals. AB0 and Rh typing, antibody screening and, eventually, identification and titration were performed on maternal specimens by microcolumn technique. Results: Not considering AB0 incompatibilities, we have discovered 64 alloimmunized women with the following specificities: 10 anti-D, 9 anti-C, 7 anti-c, 9 anti-E, 3 anti-JKa, 1 anti-D + anti-JKa, 1 anti-D + anti-S, 3 anti-D + anti-C, 1 anti-D + anti-C + anti-K, 5 anti-S, 10 anti-K, 2 anti-M, 1 anti-c + anti-E and 2 anti-D + anti-C + anti-G. The most severe HDN were the 2 D + C + G, the c + E and 2 out of 7 c newborns, with mean hemoglobin between 5 and 6 g/L, bilirubin = 20.5 g/L, reticulocyte count = 10%. In these exchange transfusion needed at the delivery. Other newborns were only treated with phototherapy. Conclusion. Thanks to the immunohematological monitoring, the diagnosis of alloimmunization, the correct management of pregnancy and the adequate neonatal therapy were possible. In fact all newborns survived and showed no neurological lesions in the following controls. Conclusion: In order to provide a highly specialized perinatal care, immunohematologist, obstetric and pediatric should provide a good antenatal and perinatal screening. This is an interesting case of RhD immunisation in RhD negative woman despite the application of RhD immunoprophylaxis. Case report: A blood sample of pregnant woman, 30 years of age, in 12th gestation week, was sent to our Laboratory for serological analysis. Her blood group was O, ccddee and she had an anti-D antibody reactive only with enzyme treated panel of test erythrocytes. Her husband was A, CCDee, and two children were both A, Ccddee. On the next visit, she gave the data of one arteficial and one missed abortion before the 12th gestation week covered with 50 mg of RhD immunoprophylaxis, but without the measurement of fetomaternal haemorrhage (FMH). Both of abortions were after the deliveries. Until the end of the pregnancy, detailed serological analysis showed anti-D specificity of antibody in her sera which remained reactive only with enzyme treated red blood cells. The fetus was under permanent ultrasound control. She delivered a mature, RhD positive, CcDee male child, without any sign of haemolytic disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-360"}, {"text": "The proper personal history, measurement of the size of FMH, distinguishing the anti-D and anti-G specificity of the antibody, administration of RhD immunoprophylaxis and cooperation between transfusion medicine specialists, gyneacologists and neonatologists still remain major principles of prenatal and perinatal care concerning haemolytic deisease of the fetus and newborn caused by anti-D antibody. Anti D antibody, reactive only with enzyme treated red blood cells is usually harmless for fetus and the newborn. Introduction: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is widely used in neonatal intensive care units for acute or chronic pathological conditions. Clinical indications for RBC transfusion are shock, sepsis and/or anemia with the following laboratory criteria: A) hematocrit (Hct) < 20% or hemoglobin (Hb) < 7 g/dL and reticulocytes < 4%; B) Hct < 30% or Hb < 10 g/dL in these conditions: O2 required < 35%, recurrent apnoea and bradicardia, cardiac rate > 180 bpm and respiratory rate > 80 bpm for more 24 h; C) Hct < 35% or Hb < 12 g/dL with severe respiratory distress. Aim of the study. Aim of this study has been to evaluate the effectiveness of RBC transfusion therapy in premature and at term newborns independently of initial pathological conditions. Methods: Our therapeutic objective has been to achieve an Hct of 50% after the whole cycle of transfusion therapy. For each little patient, the volume of transfused RBC unit has been calculated, according to international guide lines, using the following criteria: weight (Kg) \u00a5 blood volume (100 mL per Kg if premature or 80 mL per Kg if at term newborn) \u00a5 (Hct desired -Hct observed)/Hct of unit transfused. Particularly we have considered that premature infants (with a gestation age of 26-36 weeks) show a range of weight from 600 to 1.800 g, while at term newborns from 1.800 to 4.000 g. In order to avoid a circulatory overload, the indicated hemocomponent has been always packed RBC with higher possible hematocrit. For the same reason, the rate of infusion has been always 3-10 mL/Kg/hour. Methods: This is a descriptive study. The name of the neonates who received transfusion was obtained from the blood bank of Beheshti Hospital. Information concerning the type of blood product, frequency and indication of transfusion, sex, gestational age and weight of infants was recorded in questionnaire and analyzed. Results: Out of 541 neonates admitted during one year, 118 (68 male, 50 female) received blood components. Fifty four percent received one, 35% two and 11% received three types of blood components. The frequency of transfusions were 311 times. The most common used blood products were fresh frozen plasma (49%), red blood cell (33%), whole blood (14%) and platelets (4%). All the blood products except whole blood were used more common in premature and low birth weight infants. Appropriateness of transfusion of red cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets and whole blood were 92%, 88%, 100% and 91% respectively. (HDN) . In accordance to current regulations, this study is carried out in all pregnant women attending in our Service. According to our protocol, when an alloantibody of any specificity is detected through the LISS-Coombs gel technique, the same determination is made using papain-treated screen cells to detect any association with other antibodies which could be of clinical relevance for a HDN. There are scientific evidences that the use of enzymatic techniques increase the test's sensitivity, though clinical relevance of 'enzyme only antibodies' may be questioned. Aims: Demonstrate the importance of a routine identification of irregular antibodies in pregnant by two methods (Liss-Coombs -Enzymatic) and the prevalence of anti-D associated antibodies, only detected by using enzymatic technique. Analyze the need to carry out a follow up of sensitized patients to determine if the associated antibodies only detected with in an enzymatic medium can be detected with a LISS-Coombs medium during pregnancy, thus acquiring clinical significance for HDN. Materials and methods: Between January 2000 and December 2004 we studied 1970 D-negative pregnant women. The studies performed were: ABO grouping, D and weak D, Rh phenotype, direct antiglobulin test and irregular antibody detection (IAD) against commercial screen cells with LISS-Coombs (DiaMed) \u00ae gel-medium technique, according to the manufacturer's specifications. When IAD were positive, an antibody identification using two commercial cell panels with gel techniques (LISS-Coombs-Enzymatic) was performed. Along the pregnancy, periodic controls were carried out to determine the exact moment when antibodies, previously only identified in an enzymatic medium, could be detected in a LISS-Coombs medium (clinically significant antibodies). Results: Out of 1970 D-negative studied samples, 278 (14.1%) had a positive DAI and it was only showed anti-D specificity in a LISS-Coombs medium. After analyzing this specificity against enzymetreated erythrocytes, it was possible to determine that 79 patients (24.8%) had in their serum other anti-D associated alloantibodies: 5 anti-K (1.8%), 63 anti-C (22.7%), 10 anti-E (3.6%) and 1 anti-C + E (0.3%). During the immunohematologic follow up, it was determined that in 4/79 patients some of the antibodies which were previously only detected in an enzymatic medium, could be identified in a LISS-Coombs medium and later they were identified in the red cell elution of the newborn. Conclusions: These results confirm the relevance of a screening for irregular antibodies of clinical importance by means of a conven-tional technique and one of increased sensitivity in all pregnant women. The detection of an association of antibodies provides information for the undertaking of diagnostic and therapeutic measures, both by the obstetrician, as for any eventual transfusional requirements for HDN. It was also concluded that, although antibodies detected in an enzymatic medium are considered of low clinical significance, its investigation and follow up is suggested in pregnant women to determine the moment in which they can be detected in an antiglobulinic medium, thus revealing their clinical significance. Background: Fibrin glue is one of the most complex human plasma derivatives both in terms of composition and clinical applications. This product mimics the last step of coagulation cascade through activation of fibrinogen by thrombin, leading to the formation of a fibrin clot in the presence of factor XIII. In contrast to synthetic adhesives, the significant advantage of this plasma-derived sealant is its biocompatibility and biodegradability as well as the fact that it does not induce inflammation, foreign body reaction or extensive fibrosis. Readsorption of the fibrin clot is achieved during wound healing within days/weeks following application, depending upon the type of surgery, the amount and type of product used or the proteolytic activity of the treated site. The risk of virus transmission by commercial fibrin glue products is still debated and investigators are looking for alternative fibrinogen sources. Many of these studies rely on autologous on single donor cryoprecipitate as source of fibrinogen. Aims: The aim of this study was to compare single and double methods of cryoprecipitation of fibrin glue. The influence of different plasma preparation methods and plasma storage temperatures (-30\u00b0C and -80\u00b0C) on the quality of fibrinogen concentrate was examined. Methods: Whole blood was collected by standard phlebotomy technique and centrifuged at 4000 \u00a5 g for 5 min within 2 h of collection. Plasma was removed. Four units of plasma were pooled into a 2000 ml bag, mixed, divided into 4 parts (aprox. 219.7 ml) and immediately frozen. Two of these units were stored at -30\u00b0C and 2 units of FFP at -80\u00b0C. After one month the plasma was thawed at 4\u00b0C during 16-18 h. The fibrinogen concentrates (21-25 ml) were received by single and double cryoprecypitation. To compare single and double methods of cryoprecipitation, the levels of fibrinogen, fibronectin, plasminogen and factor XIII were determined. Results and conclusion: The levels of fibrynogen were significantly higher in fibrynogen concentration obtained by double cryoprecypitation from plasma stored at -30\u00b0C. There were no significant differences in the level of plasminogen in both tested groups. Double cryoprecipitation of a single unit of plasma (stored -30\u00b0C) is an efficient, simple and safe method of obtaining fibrin glue. Background: Talking about professional risk we generally consider the risk of acquiring some kind of infective disease through accidental injury. In this article I would like to point out another side of the problem-the risk of making preventable medical error. With all its consequences. Aim: How blood transfusion errors are among the most serious types of medical errors, the final goal is to initiate nationwide, regular, mandatory error reporting. Information obtained, distributed and openly discussed at professional meetings will contribute to improving the patient safety. At the same time it would contribute to avoidance of blaming and shaming of many health care providers. Prevent what preventable could be! Method: Retrospective analyze was conducted at the middle size blood transfusion center (10 000 donations per year and utilization of approximately 25 000 of components).

Mandatory report of fatal or 'only' harmful errors to the referent institution and its periodical announcement is the step ahead in preventing errors. Those reports should be discussed at professional meetings (not at the 'yellow pages') and served as educational tool.

Options include importing finished products and/or procuring products made from locally collected plasma. One approach is to consider local fractionation of plasma by building and operating a plasma fractionation facility, which may produce, finished products, or may produce intermediate products that are further manufactured in another facility. An alternative approach is the implementation of a plasma fractionation program where local plasma is sent to an established fractionator, and the plasma is fractionated following preagreed terms. The end products are returned to the country of the plasma supplier. In 1954 the National Center for the production of blood products was established, under the direction of Elias Politis and 9 years later in 1963 begun the production of dried plasma from Greek donors. By the year 1965 the center started the production of fibrinogen and by the year 1967 the production of antihaemophilc factor. In 1992 all the activities of the center settled down due to administrative aspects. At the beginning of 1990s a contract fractionation program was instituted (under the direction of K. Sofroniadou) concerning the fractionation of liquid plasma and production of albumin, which by the end of year 2000 stopped and was replaced with a new contract for the fractionation of source plasma and the production of albumin. The challenge of adapting to the new and more stringent regulations governing the manufacture of blood products was great and brought a lot of changes in the structure of our center. A new bar-coding system ensuring the traceability of blood donations was instituted together with complex software for packaging and preparation of plasma shipments to the fractionation center together with all necessary paper work. A close collaboration with the medicines regulatory authority in order to be able to fulfill all the requirements that regulate issues associated to the quality and safety of human derived medicinal products. Collaboration with blood collection establishments was promoted in order to increase the amount of plasma produced. There is a continuous effort from all the implicated parts in order to follow defined quality assurance procedures as highlighted by international guidelines for the blood donor selection, collection procedures, testing methods, donation handling, storage and transportation of plasma. The plasma contract fractionation program may serve, as an initial step prior to switching production to a locally built facility.

In 1972, Matras et al. described successful application of fibrin glue for peripheral nerve repair. This encouraging report prompted the use of fibrin glue in wound closure, skin grafting and bone union of osteotomies. The fibrinogen component of fibrin glue is produced from single unit donations of fresh frozen plasma. Such procedure helps to reduce the risk of transfusion transmitted infections encountered by exposure to pools from large numbers of donors or by use of fibrinogen prepared from autologous blood prior to surgery. The second component, a mixture of thrombin and CaCl2, is commercially available. Thrombin is applied to the operation site simultaneously and in equal volume to the fibrinogen but from a separate syringe. There are many methods of fibrinogen concentrate preparation but none of them has been described in detail. Aims: The aim of this study was to choose/select the most effective, simple and safe method of obtaining fibrinogen concentrate (basic component of fibrinogen glue) which would also be easy to prepare in Blood Transfusion Centers. Methods of precipitation of fibrinogen by polyethylene glycol (PEG), ammonium sulphate, ethanol or cryoprecipitation were compared. Methods: Plasma was obtained after centrifugation (4000 \u00a5 g for 5 min) of whole blood. Four units of plasma were pooled into a 2000 ml bag, mixed, divided into 4 parts and immediately frozen. One of them was stored at -30\u00b0C and after one month the plasma was thawed at 4\u00b0C during 16-18 h. Fibrinogen was obtained by cryprecipitation and each of the three remaining units was precipitated with ethanol, PEG and ammonium sulphate. The levels of fibrinogen, fibronectin, plasminogen and factor XIII were determined in each fibrinogen concentrate.

Background: Haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) is the destruction of the red blood cells of the fetus and neonate by antibodies produced by the mother. Although postpartum RhIG prophylaxis reduced the incidence of alloimmunization from pregnancy from 16% to 1-2%, the doubt subsists if it is appropriate to use it as routine antenatal prophylaxis. Material and methods: A total of 1836 samples (918 mothers and 918 newborns), from 01/05/2003 and 30/04/2004, were studied. All ABO, Rh typing, antibody tests and DAT were carried out in column agglutination tests. Results: From the 918 cases studied it was found 778 cases without incompatibility (85%). From the 140 incompatibilities, 88.6% were ABO, 8.6% were RhD, 1.4% were other Rh incompatibilities, and 1.4% were due to auto-antibodies. 80% of the mothers were RhD+ and 20% RhD-. Conclusion: Of the 918 pregnant women studied, only 184 were RhD-. From this group 83 (45%) delivered RhD-newborns, what revealed that the antenatal prophylaxis they were submitted was unnecessary. From the 184 pregnant women RhD-, 13% had incompatibility ABO, which decreases to near 2% the risk of development of RhD immunization. Being anti-D immunoglobulin a product that has the potential risk of infection transmission, is it appropriate to use indiscriminately as a routine antenatal prophylaxis? The introduction of molecular methods to determine the fetal RhD genotype could rationalize the use of antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis. Introduction: The frequency of HLA A201 haplotype expression has been found about 44-46% in Caucasian and in Greek population particularly, 44.3%. Because of the high frequency, it is used widely in anticancer immunization. The immune system plays an important role in the defense against neoplastic disease and immune response show temporal chances related to circadian variation of antibodies and total lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. Aim: The probable difference in the frequency of HLA A201 expression and their lymphocyte phenotype into a group of cancer patients and a group of healthy donors, during screening of immunization with HLA-combined peptides. Materials and methods: 323 healthy donors who proceeded in the Department of Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion Crete were tested for the HLA A201 expression. In 11 of these donors the expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD2, CD19, CD20, HLA DR, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD16-CD56+, CD3+CD16-CD56+, CD3-CD16-CD56+, CD3-CD16-CD56+ was examined.

Also, the lymphocyte phenotype among the two groups has not statistical significant difference, except of the CD20 (total B-cells). The significance of this result has to be investigated. In the course of original documents research I found out that Dr. Kalic, head of the first organized blood transfusion institution in the Balkan region (at Beograd, Serbia, in 1936), set himself a professional goal: Blood should be awaiting all patients and transfusion should not be a privilege of large city inhabitants only. Dr. Kalic's idea was that blood transfusion should be administered according to clearly given instructions and using simple blood sets. Encouraged by the conclusions of the Congress held in Paris in 1937, Dr. Kalic started preparations for the transport of blood to the inland. He concluded bravely that citrated blood could be sent by regular mail, as an ordinary parcel, without particular protection from the outside temperature. He advised his colleagues to use blood as an intravenous injection. Blood was taken from voluntary female donor in Belgrade (capital), March 1938. After keeping it for 10 days at storage, blood was forwarded on a two-day journey to a small town, 150 kilometres away from Belgrade. There it was kept on a room temperature before its final use for a treatment of a patient suffering from secondary anaemia. The patient underwent the procedure without side effects and responded to the transfusion with blood sent in this manner much better in comparison to earlier methods of direct blood transfused. Reminding ourselves of the courage of our ancestors to implement their professional knowledge and personal original ideas in a new way with the desire to help the patient as successfully as possible, we pay them the deserved respect and gratitude for inspiring and encouraging us in this way to try the same. Conclusions: Automation leads to increased standardization, faster specimen processing and reporting, elimination of manual specimen identification, uniform interpretation of serological reaction patterns and objective reading of haemagglutination endpoints.

Aim: The aim of the study was to present the effects of transfusion of erythrocytes with residual number of leukocytes in anemic patients on chronic hemodialysis at Institute of Nephrology in Struga. Matherial and methods: During 1997-2004 period all anemic patients on hemodialysis were divided in 4 groups. The first group 34 pts with febrile non-hemolitic transfusion reaction. The second group-25 pts immunized toward leukocyte and HLA antigen. The third group 57 young candidates for kidney transplantation for prevention of HLA immunization. The fourth group 16 pts with SLE (for immune-complexes and autoantibodies). Total 132 patients (65 males and 67 females) received 319 units of RBC with residual number of leukocytes. Commercial filters of BAXTER\u00d4 (Lekostop 4 LDS) and TERUMO\u00d4 (IMUGARD III RC) of second and third generation with microagregate filter and synthetic polyurethane fibers, with 20-40 microns pores that remove leukocytes, platelets, microagregates and fibrin were used. Erythrocyte concentrates are filtered until 5 days of collection. Result: AABB permits maximum <5 \u00a5 106 WBCs/unit for prevention of febrile non-hemolytic reaction. The filters we used reach residual leukocyte number of 2 \u00a5 10 5 the Le reduction of 99-99.99%. The number of RBC after filtration is minimum 90% -40 g Hb per unit.

Conclusion: The used filters for leucocyte depletion are characterized with superior biocompatibility, excellent elimination of all types of leucocytes and high 'recovery' of erythrocytes. The use of filters for Le depletion reduces and minimizes the side effects of allogenic blood transfusion in patients on chronic hemodialysis who are alloimmunized, in patients with SLE, and particularly in young patients candidates for kidney transplantation. Background: FV Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, MTHFR C677T are three most common and important prothrombotic inherited mutations. Aims: The aim of the case-control study was to assess the prevalence of mutations and their single or combined effects as risk factors for thrombosis. Methods: The study included 103 thrombotic patients (venous thromboembolism, chronical venous diseases, different etiology) and 200 asymptomatic healthy individuals as control group. Extraction of genomic DNA was followed with genotyping of FVL by PCR-SSP, prothrombin and MTHFR mutation by PCR-RFLP. Results: A statistically significantly higher prevalence of FVL mutation was found in thrombotic patients (32.0% heterozygous, 1.9% homozygous) compared to controls (3.0% heterozygous), P < 0.0001. The OR for heterozygous carriers was 15.24 (95% CI 6.13-37.94), confirming the association of FVL mutation with the risk of thrombosis.

A major development occurred in 1987 with the discovery of powerful regulatory elements that could guarantee high level of globin gene expression. These elements when incorporated into viral vectors allow expression of therapeutic levels of the transferred globin genes. A second major progress was achieved with the development of safe lentiviral vectors that can efficiently infect the human pluripotent repopulating hemopoietic stem cells.

Gene therapy for haemophilia today relies upon addition of normal factor VIII or IX genes. With present technology gene therapy can offer the prospect of a true 'cure' for haemophilia in animal models, although this may not be currently realizable in man. More than 30 patients with haemophilia have now been treated in Phase 1 gene therapy protocols. All studies have failed to conclusively show that therapeutic levels of factor VIII and IX can be reliably obtained. The first trial reported used IM injection of a factor IX containing recombinant Adeno Associated Virus (rAAV) in adult patients with severe haemophilia B. Only very modest increases in factor IX level, <2 u/dl rise, in 4/8 patients enrolled were observed, although less factor IX concentrate was needed in 3/6 subjects. A similar study using the same rAAV vector via intrahepatic artery infusion has been conducted. This has been complicated by the observation of AAV vector in the semen of subjects. In six patients enrolled, no durable levels of IX above 1 u/dl were seen. Further development of this rAAV vector is suspended. For haemophilia A, three systems are have been tried. The first study was an ex vivo addition of factor VIII gene to autologous fibroblasts and then laparoscopic reimplantation. Preclinical assessments demonstrated durable expression of factor VIII (>5% of normal) for >1 year in mice following a single treatment. In 4/6 patients treated repeated factor VIII rises (0.5-3.5 u/dl) were seen, but no improvements lasted beyond 10 months.

This patient demonstrated transient liver toxicity and thrombocytopenia at doses lower than those that cause toxicity in primates. Sustained levels of factor VIII of ~1 u/dl have been observed over a number of months. Accrual to the study has been poor. Haemophilia remains a prime target for gene therapy.

The condition affects more frequently infants of small ages while it is rare in adults [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In some patients, diagnosis is established in occasion of a respiratory, urinary or cutaneous infection, but in many cases is simply a finding of cell blood counting performed for unrelated reasons [6] .

Association of the disorder with autoimmune hemolytic anemia or autoimmune thrombocytopenia is rarely seen [8] . Blood biochemistry is normal while serologic tests for bacterial, viral or other pathogens may be positive depending on the underlying infection. Bone marrow is hypercellular without maturation arrest of granulocytic series. Hemopoietic stem cell reserves and function are normal or increased, and stromal cell function is within the range of the normality [9]. Methods for the detection of granulocyte-specific antibodies: Serology for the detection of granulocyte-specific antibodies has been marred, compared to erythrocyte serology, because the target cell here, the granulocyte, is short-lived, fragile and becomes easily activated. The former two of these difficulties require absolutely freshly (<6 h old) isolated neutrophils from a panel of donors to be used every day to run the tests with sera from patients, while the third difficulty is more important since spontaneous cell clumping in vitro is very common and nay mimic the specific aggregation caused by cross-linkage of surface bound antibodies in the granulocyte agglutination test (GAT). In order to overcome these problems, the Second International Granulocyte Serology Workshop [10] recommended a combination of two tests as the best screening procedure for the detection of granulocyte autoantibodies in patient sera, GAT and granulocyte immunofluorescence test (GIFT). GAT is mainly mediated by IgM antibodies and is positive in about 2% of cases. GIFT detects IgG antibodies and is positive in about 98% of cases. It is to be noted that flow-cytometry fluorescence may arise not only from the surface but also from the cytoplasm of neutrophils, necessitating assessment of membrane fuorescence by microscopy. A good direct anti-granulocyte test is not available today. This is due to the fact that too few neutrophils can be obtained from the blood of neutropenic patients, and also to the observation that neutrophils are often activated in vivo because if an underlying infection or other inflammatory process, thus expressing FcgRII and FcgRIIIb to which nonspecific binding of W-PA-113 Practical approach to transfusion in autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) G GARRATTY American Red Cross Blood Services, Pomona, CA, USA A major problem when transfusing patients with AIHA is that often all units are incompatible. This may be due to autoantibodies (autoab) and/or alloantibodies (allo-ab). If the incompatibility is due to only auto-ab, then transfusion of incompatible blood will not usually result in a clinically significant reaction, but if due to alloab, the result may be similar to that seen in any other patient (i.e. a hemolytic transfusion reaction ranging from mild to severe). Thus, it is essential (as in any other patient) to exclude the presence of allo-ab. It is wise to phenotype all patients, for as many antigens as possible, before the patient receives transfusion. There are two popular approaches to determine if allo-abs are present but being masked by 'warm' auto-ab activity. The preferred method is to remove the auto-ab by adsorbing the patient's serum with autologous RBCs treated with enzymes, or preferably, with ZZAP reagent. The latter reagent contains an enzyme leading to optimal adsorption of auto-ab, and DTT. These two chemicals will destroy significant antigens other than Rh and Kidd (e.g. MNS, Duffy, Kell, Lutheran, Dombrock, Cromer, LW, some Yta and Ge, Inb, JMH, Ch, Rg, Pr antigens), thus will not adsorb alloantibodies to these antigens. If autoadsorption is not possible (e.g. patient has been transfused recently or there are too few RBCs), one has to perform adsorption with enzymes or ZZAP-treated allogeneic RBCs. One does not have to be concerned with covering any antigens destroyed by ZZAP (e.g. Kell and Duffy systems). We use a rough guide relating the strength of the indirect antiglobulin test to the number of adsorptions needed to remove auto-ab (1+ = 1 adsorption; 2+ = 2 adsorptions; 3+ = 3 adsorptions; 4+ = 3 or more adsorptions). If there is no activity left after the adsorptions, then one can suspect that the incompatibility was due to auto-ab, but on rare occasions one can be wrong and an allo-ab to a high-frequency antigen has been removed. This is a major disadvantage of using allogeneic adsorptions, and is why adsorptions with autologous RBCs are preferred. If time (2-8 h) does not allow for adsorptions, one can dilute the patient's serum (e.g. 1 in 4, or 1 in 5) and test the dilution against a panel to see if any alloantibody specificity becomes obvious. Another approach is to select units matching the patient's phenotype as closely as possible. When dealing with cold agglutinin syndrome one can usually exclude allo-ab activity by testing strictly at 37C. This can be helped by performing adsorptions with enzyme-treated autologous RBCs at 4C, but it is difficult to adsorb all of the powerful cold autoagglutinin activity. It is reported that 30-40% of AIHA have allo-abs; the incidence is even higher in patients who have received multiple transfusions. Thus, we feel that procedures such as those discussed above must be performed before transfusing incompatible blood if time allows. One should always negotiate with the attending physician regarding the time it will take to perform adsorptions. A decision may be made not to perform adsorptions if the patient has life-threatening hemolysis, and especially if the patient has never been transfused, or pregnant.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 470, "end": 473, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 474, "end": 477, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 478, "end": 481, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 482, "end": 485, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 486, "end": 489, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 490, "end": 493, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 494, "end": 497, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 698, "end": 701, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 963, "end": 966, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "HA PAPADAKI University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion Crete, Greece"}, {"text": "serum IgG may occur (NAIg). The presence of immune-comlexes in the serum, such as in patients with Felty's syndrome, lupus erythematosus and other diseases, as well as the presence of immune aggregates formed in sera stored frozen for long time, may give false-positive tests given that they may bind to FcgRIIIb molecules expressed on the surface of neutrophils. Elimination of immunecomplexes and immune aggregates can be easily obtained by ultracentrifugation [11] . Another cause of false-positive results may be the presence of anti-HLA antibodies because of allo-immunization. These allo-antibodies react with HLA molecules found not only on neutrophils but also on the surface of many other cells including lymphocytes. These allo-antibodies can be eliminated by platelet absorption. It seems that the best method in the search of true antigranulocyte antibodies is the monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of granulocyte antigens (MAIGA) [12] . With this method one can specify anti-granulocyte antibodies using a panel of known granulocyte antigenic specificity. Finally, it is notable that the levels of serum antibodies to neutrophils may vary considerably over the time. One negative test does not exclude AIN. Usually, two to three tests have to be run over a period of months [13] . Antigenic specificity: Human neutrophil antigens (HNA) are classified according to an International Granulocyte Antigen Working Party [14] .

A promising approach is transfection of mammalian cells by cDNA derived from granulocyte antigen specific mRNA.

Haemolytic anaemia caused by warmreacting auto-antibodies solely of the IgA class is exceedingly rare. Those cases of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia can be difficult to diagnose because of the negative polyspecific Coombs' test, which is a standard in investigation of possible causes of haemolysis. We present a case of severe warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia caused by IgA class autoantibodies. A 40-yr old male patient was admitted with anaemia, haemoglobinuria, and other signs of severe haemolytic disease. He received multiple transfusions but haemoglobin level did not rise above 7 g/dL. The initial polyspecific direct antiglobulin test, containing an anti-IgG and anti-C3d antiserum, was negative. Tests for cold agglutinins and other possible causes of haemolysis were negative. Only by using a monospecific, anti-IgA antiserum could we show that the warm IgA auto-antibodies against red blood cells were present on patient's erythrocytes. We have not detected signs of complement activation by IgA autoantibodies in this patient. The patient received corticosteroids with good initial effect. His haemoglobin level stabilized and he did not require more transfusions. Anti-IgA direct antiglobulin test became negative about to weeks after the therapy was initiated. However, in spite for the initial effect of steroid therapy haemolysis continued, and splenectomy was performed 6 months after diagnosis was made. It has been shown that human lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes contain specific Fc receptors for IgA, and both monocyte-mediated phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity due to IgA auto-antibodies has been demonstrated. There is also increasing evidence that IgA auto-antibodies can activate complement, both via the classical and the alternative pathway. A phenomenon of 'reactive haemolysis', which involves C3-independent binding of C5b6 complexes to 'bystander' red blood cells, has also been described.

In both cases, the course of the disease was mild, with bacterial omphalitis on day 15 and 5, respectively. Omphalitis was successfully treated with 7-day antibiotic therapy according to antibiotic sensitivity report.

In spite of prolonged neutropenia (2 and 6 months, respectively), no other infections were recorded. Discussion and conclusion: In our patients, the therapeutic approach to ANN was individualized, based on standard antibiotic therapy, intravenous gammaglobulins, corticosteroids, available literature data, and our own clinical experience. Although in the last few years rh-GCSF is successfully used in patients with neutropenia, we decided to postpone its use in case the neonatal sepsis developed. The reasons for such decision were: (1) the fact that both neonates were in good general clinical status, with a mild course of the disease with only short-term umbilical infection successfully managed with antibiotic therapy; (2) literature reports suggesting the unexpected failure to respond to rh-GCSF therapy in patients with neutropenia induced by anti HNA-2a immunization, and (3) the unknown effect of rh-GCSF on developing tissues of the neonate.

There is no good evidence on which to base transfusion support policy for patients who have experienced TRALI. The hypothesis that there may be patient associated factors that contribute to the risk of TRALI is generally accepted. For this reason it seems reasonable to try to avoid further transfusion during the period of illness. If this is unavoidable the next best solution to reduce the risk of recurrence seems to be the avoidance of using plasma containing blood components (especially FFP) as there is a high chance of positivity for leucocyte antibodies especially for those coming from female donors. As fresh frozen plasma transfusion accounts for up to half of all TRALI cases and as our center is the only in Greece responsible for the testing and processing of blood from blood donors representing military recruits, the last two years we tried to set up a project in order to provide components from male donors on request. Our donor base consists predominantly from males donors (98.7%), aged between 18 and 25 years old, with a small chance of having a positive history for transfusion The difficulty of the project consisted on the fact that these donors are assigned to military camps throughout Greece, which makes difficult the on time arrival of the units to our establishment in order to be processed for the production of FFP conform the European Council quality requirements. This was the main reason why, till now, all plasma produced from these donations was regarded as plasma for fractionation. The first step for implementing the new project was to evaluate the number of donations that, by minor changes on the time of arrival, could be processed for FFP production. The next step was to re-schedule the shifts of the personnel for the on time production of FFP. During 2003, 25% of donations were fulfilling the specifications for the production of FFP and with the flexibility of the schedule the 97% of them were successfully processed to FFP. During 2004, 30% of the donations were fulfilling the specifications and 97.8% of them were processed to FFP.

Increasing awareness of the possibility of blood shortages mainly related to increased precautions associated with the possible transmission of vCJD by transfusion has been the driver for the development of blood shortage contingency plans in the UK. In England and North Wales, hospitals and the National Blood Service (NBS) have worked together to develop an integrated blood shortage plan (IBSP) designed to ensure that hospitals and the NBS work together within a consistent, integrated framework giving patients equal access to available blood on the basis of need. An essential element of the plan is the principle that shortages can, in most cases be avoided by reducing the current usage of blood through appropriate use programmes. The impetus for hospitals to implement these programmes was a government circular (HSC 2002/009). Hospitals have embraced the circular and have recruited specialist hospital transfusion practitioners, introduced lower Hb triggers, cell salvage and hospital transfusion teams and are participating in the Blood Stocks Management Scheme (BSMS). Audits of compliance with the circular have taken place, and a web based tool kit is available. The demand for blood has declined for the last three years, with a decrease of about 5% during 2004-05, suggesting that the drive for improvement has been successful. The shortage plan introduced in England and North Wales has two key aims: that the national pool of blood is available for all essential transfusions for all patients and that overall usage is reduced to ensure the most urgent cases receive blood. The plan is structured to provide actions for the NBS and hospitals in three phases, 'normal' circumstances, reduced availability and severe prolonged shortage. Hospitals should have documented emergency blood management arrangements for each of the phases. The national plan is activated when the NBS red cell stock level falls to pre-defined levels, hospitals are informed by fax that they should reduce their normal stock holding levels according to guidance in the IBSP and comply with the daily hospital usage budget. The BSMS has used its knowledge of hospital inventory levels and demand to provide guidance on appropriate inventory levels for normal and reduced status, it also provides the daily hospital budget.

Blood is rarely needed in excessive quantities at the moment a disaster occurs. The outpouring of blood donors, especially at the site of a disaster, often proves counterproductive. The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, with almost 3000 deaths and more than 4000 injuries, provides an instructive model. More than a million potential donors contacted blood-collection centers. Hundreds of thousands of prospective blood donors crowded collection facilities and many waited for hours, often to be turned away. Qualified staff were in short supply and screening errors occurred as minimally qualified staff were recruited and as collection personnel fatigued. Supplies and storage capabilities were pushed to their limit. Some blood was inadequately processed and stored. Resources were diverted from needed apheresis collections and component preparation to whole blood collection. In the aftermath of the disaster, blood outdated and volunteer donors became disillusioned as their 'gift of life' was refused or unused. Similar responses have occurred numerous times over the 60-year period since blood-donor programs were introduced. In virtually every civilian disaster in the U.S. during the past century, all the blood that was needed was immediately available from blood inventory. In only four cases were more than 100 units of blood used in the first 24 to 30 h. In 2001 in New York, the five hospitals closest to the disaster site admitted only 139 disaster victims. The New York Blood Center, which supplies 80 percent of blood for the city's hospitals, added 600 units to routine inventory at hospitals. The center received 12 000 telephone calls and collected more than 5000 units of blood in the first 12 h. In the area of the Pentagon, the Chesapeake and Potomac Red Cross blood center supplemented hospital blood inventories within h of the disaster. Meanwhile, spurred by well-meaning media and federal officials, lines of blood donors were being processed at local hospitals, makeshift collection centers, the small research hospital at NIH, and at a building next to the White House. In the week after September 11, America's Blood Centers collected 167 000 more units of blood, and the American National Red Cross collected 287 000 more units than in the same period the previous year. More than 475 000 units were collected for the disaster victims, but only 258 units were used. U.S. blood collectors and federal agencies have created a disaster plan that acknowledges the need for altruistic people to volunteer for blood donation in the time of disaster and speaks with a single voice to avoid needless collection activity while harnessing the good will of well-intentioned people to supplement the ongoing need for volunteer blood donation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "JF CHAPMAN Blood Stocks Management Scheme, London, UK"}, {"text": "Rehabilitation of blood transfusion service in Azerbaijan CD ASADOV, GA HUSEYNOV and AB HAGIYEV Institute of Hematology and Transfusiolo, Baku, Azerbaijan", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "W-PA-121"}, {"text": "At the end of 80th years of the last century in Azerbaijan as well as in other Republics of the former USSR began process of progressive deterioration of Blood Service parameters.

The increased iron requirement in pregnancy and the puerperium carry with it an increased susceptibility to iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia and perioperative or peripartal blood transfusion. However, if ever possible administration of blood transfusion should be avoided for several reasons which will be pointed out in the talk. Infections: It is well known that various pathogens such as bacteria and virus can be transmitted by administration of blood. Around 0.03% of are contaminated by bacteria such as Yersinia or Pseudomonas species but are not screened routinely for bacteria. In addition there is no donor screening for Hepatitis A, Herpes species (CMV, EBV, HHV 7, HHV 8), Parvovirus B19, Hepatitis G (3.4%) and TT (transfusion transmitted) virus (1.9%). Numbers for positive testings for 'classic' virus such as HIV, Hep. B and Hep. C vary from country to country and lie around 1 : 30 000 to 1 : 5000 000 depending on quality of donor screening programs, PCR sensitivity etc. Recently there is increasing evidence that even Prions which cause the Jakob Creutzfeld disease variation ('mad cow disease') might be transmitted by transfusions. Therefore the FDA has determined that blood donors from countries with high prevalence of prion positive persons are not permitted to give blood in the US (e.g. donors from UK). Beside infections, other well known effects of transfusion are problems due to incorrect blood or components transfused, post transfusion purpura, acute and delayed lung injury, graft versus host disease and other acute and delayed allergic reactions. Beside these negative effects it was also shown that patients who receive blood transfusion liberally after operations or in ICU show higher morbidity and mortality compared to patients with restrictive transfusion policy. This might be due to negative effects on immune functions and inflammatory reactions and lack of stored blood to efficiently improve organ oxygenation. For example it is known that stored blood has worse capillary perfusion and worse viscosity properties compared to fresh blood. Taken together there is increasing scientific evidence that blood transfusion is not the gold standard for anaemia management and alternatives such as endogenous blood pooling and efficient treatment of any anaemia must be enforced in the clinical settings. Prevention and correction presuppose reliable laboratory parameters and a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of iron therapy. In order to correctly diagnose the type and degree of anaemia, a prerequisite for selection of the proper therapy, one must first of all correctly differentiate between the relative, i.e. the physiological anaemia of pregnancy due to the normal plasma volume increase during pregnancy, and 'real anaemias' with various different pathophysiological causes. When defining the Hb cutoff value for anaemia in pregnancy, the extent of the plasma volume changes with respect to the gestational age must be taken into consideration. It has been found that haemoglobin values <11.0 g/dL in the first and third trimesters, and <10.5 g/dL in the second trimester may point to an anaemic situation which should be further clarified. The first important steps for diagnosing anaemia in a pregnant patient include a thorough check of her medical W-PA-126 Impact of EPO treatment on transfusion requirements in myelodysplasia C GARDIN and P FENAUX Hopital Avicenne, APHP, University of Paris 13, BOBIGNY, France", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "21: ALTERNATIVES TO ALLOGENEIC TRANSFUSION"}, {"text": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal disorders of hematopoeisis, associated with bone marrow failure and an increased risk of evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite an normal or increased bone marrow cellularity in most cases, cytopenias worsen with time due to increased apoptosis and defective differentiation of blood lineage precursors. Incidence of MDS increases with age and reach 15/100 000 above 70 years of age. Bone marrow cytogenetics number of cytopenia and percentage of bone marrow blasts are strong predictors of survival and evolution to AML. A composite international prognosis scoring system (IPSS) is used in everyday practice to guide the management of these diseases. These disorders are heterogeneous and include 'low risk' patients (less than 10% bone marrow blasts) with a prolonged evolution marked by chronic anemia, and 'high-risk' patients (excess of bone marrow blasts >10%) evolving in a short timespan with severe cytopenias, and to AML in approximately 50% of cases. At diagnosis, 80% of MDS patients are anemic, with an hemoglobin level less than 100 g/L, and 80% of them will require chronic blood components transfusion, during the evolution of their disease. Chronic anemia and multiple blood products transfusions are associated with an altered quality of life, clinical iron overload, and important health care costs. Although transfusion practices and patient's transfusion need are variable, elderly MDS patients require a mean of 10-20 units/year of follow-up, in recent surveys. Therapies able to diminish or abolish the need for RBC transfusion have therefore a major role in the management of MDS, as allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the only curative therapy of these diseases, is limited to a small subset of MDS patients. High-doses of recombinant erythropoetin (EPO) (150-300 U/kg tiw, or a 40 000-60 000 U as single weekly dose) are typically used in low-risk MDS. The response rate to EPO is 25-40%, including major responses (suppression of RBC dependency or rise of hemoglobin level of more than 20 g/L). Absent or low RBC transfusion needs and a serum epo level less than 500 U/l are strongly predictive of response to EPO, in patients with low-risk MDS. The duration of response is variable (12-20 months) in most studies, with some long-term responders. The use of higher doses of EPO or its prolonged administration may be associated with higher response rates, although no randomized studies are available Combination of EPO and low-dose granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) increases the response rate to 40-60%, including in patients not responding to several weeks of treatment with Epo alone. Two randomized trials published in 2004, compared G-CSF-EPO to RBC transfusions and confirmed the efficacy of this combination, and a longer survival of EPO-G-CSF responding patients. Studies are ongoing in MDS, including with darbepoetin, a modified erythropoetin with longer half-life, administered once a week. Two such studies have been recently reported, (darbepoetin 150 or 300 ug/week) with response rates varying from 35% to 60% in low-risk MDS. In both studies, a response to darbepoetin was observed in some patients, who failed to respond to previous treatments with alpha or beta epoetin. Further assessment of the optimal dosage, administration schedule of these drugs, and validation of their likely impact on QOL are required, in order to EPO and its derivatives to gain acceptance in MDS, due the high history and a medical examination. This procedure often lays the basis for a correct diagnosis. The current gold standard to detect iron deficiency remains the serum ferritin value. To be reliable, this requires the ruling out of an infection (chronic or acute) as a cause of the anaemia. We recommend a complete laboratory test for the exact haematological status as well as the assessment of specific chemical laboratory parameters. These should The Hb level alone is insufficient to guide management. A complete work-up (ferritin, transferrin saturation) is essential, preferably with haematological indices such as hypochromic and microcytic red cells and reticulocytes, classified by degree of maturity, in particular, before parenteral therapy is given. Since ferritin acts as both an iron-storage and acute-phase protein, it cannot be used to evaluate iron status in the presence of inflammation. A high ferritin level thus requires the presence of an inflammatory process to be eliminated before it can be taken at face value. If the C-reactive protein level is also raised, the soluble TfR concentration can be used, since it is unaffected by inflammation. Inadequate understanding of the complex chemistry of parenteral iron administration was previously responsible for serious side effects, such as toxic and allergic reactions, and even anaphylactic shock, in particular with dextran preparations. However, the current type II iron complexes that release iron to the endogenous iron-binding proteins with a half-life of about 6 h are not only effective but carry a minimal risk of allergic accident and overload, especially after a comprehensive pretreatment work-up. After correct diagnosis, major emphasis should be put on safe and effective treatment of anemia which again depends on severity of anemia, time for restoration and patients characteristics.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "21: ALTERNATIVES TO ALLOGENEIC TRANSFUSION"}, {"text": "Today effective alternatives to oral iron only or blood transfusion such as parenteral iron sucrose complex and in selected cases also recombinant erythropoietin have been investigated and show promising results concerning effective treatment of anemia during pregnancy and postpartum.

Because of the non-negligible residual risk of transmission of infectious agents by transfusion, but mainly because of immunologic complications induced by the administration of foreign proteins and cells, an alternative solution has been actively sought. Studies have clearly shown that in patients undergoing such surgery, transfusion risk correlates inversely with pre-operative hemoglobin level. Correction of even slight preoperative anemia is thus mandatory. In the elderly, iron and vitamin deficiency (B12 and/or folic acid) should be looked for as a matter of routine. We recommend the use of iron + Epo whenever a rapid correction (<4 weeks) of the anemia is desirable in cases with transferrin saturation <30% and ferritin levels <200 mg/L. With this regime it is possible to collect up to 6 autologous blood units in cases of increased perioperative blood loss (e.g. double hip replacement). In the post-operative period, anemia worsens because of the existing inflammatory state. This inhibits iron absorption from the intestine and iron release from the macrophages while it affects Epo function and production. There is increasing evidence that i.v. iron combined with Epo induces a rapid correction of post-operative anemia. It is thus recommended to stimulate erythropoiesis by i.v. iron and Epo starting on the first post-operative day and to avoid transfusions in asymptomatic patients even in cases with Hb as low as 70 g/L. Background: Hereditary hemochromatosis is one of the most common inherited disorders in which an excessive amount of iron is absorbed from the diet and then deposited in organs. The effective treatment is the regular whole blood removal which causes erythropoesis activation and leads to decrease of iron stores. Red cell apheresis is an optional method for removing of higher amount of erytrocytes in one session.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P BERIS Geneva University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland"}, {"text": "We performed 262 red cell apheresis in 15 patients with diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (14 \u00a5 C282Y homozygotes, 1 \u00a5 C282Y + H63D heterozygote) using Haemonetics MCS 3p cell separator (protocol TAE) in which red cells are removed from patients in 2-5 cycles; plasma and buffy-coat are reinfused. Collection time, donor convenience, side effects and red cell yield were recorded and analysed. Samples for hematology and iron studies in patients were drawn, analyzed and compared to baseline levels. Background: The collection of 2 units of red blood cells by apheresis (DRBC) has been reported to be safe and effective in increasing the yield of RBC units from a donor population. However several reports demonstrated the risk of inducing iron depletion when the interval between a DRBC donation and a subsequent RBC donation is shorter than 180 days. Aims: to evaluate the recovery from anaemisation and iron stores depletion after DRBC donation. Methods: donors who underwent DRBC donation between December 01, 2002 and February 28, 2003 have been enrolled in a follow up program to monitor haemoglobin (Hb), Htc, serum iron and ferritin values. These parameters have been assessed on the day of donation and, thereafter 7 and 180 days after DRBC procedure. Donors suitable to DRBC apheresis had to have: age between 18 and 60 years, weight > 70 Kg, Hb > 15.5 g/dL and serum ferritin between 50 and 400 ng/mL. A written informed consent about the collection procedure and the follow-up program has been obtained from all the enrolled donors. DRBC collection procedures have been performed by using a MCS + (Haemonetics) cell separators. Results: Out of 130 donors who donated DRBC during the study period, only 14 males completed the follow up program and have been analysed. Baseline haematological values and iron metabolism parameters were: mean Hb 16.3 \u00b1 0.5 g/dL, ferritin 85 \u00b1 31 ng/mL, serum iron 121 \u00b1 42 microg/dL. On day 7 mean Hb was 14.3 \u00b1 0.5 g/dL (P < 0.001). On day 180 mean Hb was 15.3 \u00b1 0.8 g/dL (P < 0.001), ferritin 53 \u00b1 22 ng/mL (P < 0.05), serum iron 111 \u00b1 27 (p NS).

Similarly, also iron stores have not been restored after 6 months from donation, as shown by a 38% reduction in mean serum ferritin value. According to these data it appear that the amount of iron 'lost' with the donation of 2 units of RBCs (approximately 320-420 mg of elemental iron) could not be completely compensated by iron absorption from the diet intake. Further data are necessary to define the risk of iron depletion after the donation of a DRBC, however, at least in areas where iron intake by diet is not very high, the opportunity to prolong the interval between a DRBC and a subsequent RBCs donation beyond six months or to provide adequate iron supplementation therapy should be carefully considered. Background: Increased transferrin saturation and/or serum ferritin have been observed in Italy in approximatively 5% of subjects at first blood donation and, in these subjects, HFE mutations prevalence was 0.11 for C282Y and 0.26 for H63D (Velati et al., 2003) . Aims: The role of the C282Y mutation is well known in the patho-genesis of iron overload, whereas the role of the H63D mutation remains uncertain. The aims of the present study were first to study the main HFE mutations prevalence in a random group of repeat blood donors and second to evaluate iron parameters and iron depletion in repeat blood donors heterozygous for the H63D mutation in comparison to a population of blood donors wt/wt for the H63D mutation. Methods: A total of 1165 repeat blood donors were examined in 10 Italian Transfusion Centers (6 in Northern Italy and 4 in Southern) for C282Y and H63D mutations. Out of those, 50 blood donors heterozygous for the H63D mutation and 31 wt/wt for the same HFE mutation, both groups wt/wt for the C282Y, were enrolled to evaluate iron parameters and iron depletion. These two groups were similar for number of blood donations (expressed as iron loss) and for sex distribution. Serum ferritin (SF) was the iron index recorded at first and second observation.

Although our observation is preliminary and restricted to a limited number of subjects, it seems worthwhile to extend the follow-up of blood donors H63D heteroxygotes or even homozygotes when available, in order to get further insights on the H63D role in iron metabolism. Background: CD 43 is a sialylated glycoprotein expressed on the surface of most hematopoietic cells and has been implicated in cell adhesion and signaling. Consequently the levels of soluble CD43 as well as the expression on the cell surface is a marker of cell activation. Furthermore, downregulation of this molecule has been correlated with increased susceptibility to infections. The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, refractory cytopenias and an increased risk of leukemic transformation. The MDS patients are often introduced to transfusions for anemia improvement and present increased susceptibility to infections. Aims: We studied CD43 expression in transfusion-dependent and non-transfused MDS patient in an effort to investigate mechanisms of regulation of this molecule. We also studied other activationassociated antigens in the absence of manifest infection. Material and methods: Forty-two patients were included in the study suffering from refractory anaemia (RA). Thirty-one were males and 11 females aged 33 to 85 (median 75). Twenty of them had never been transfused (group A) and 22 were regularly transfused (group B). Nineteen age matched healthy individuals were used as controls (group C). Cell surface antigens were detected by direct immuno-fluorescence evaluated by flow cytometer. The following mouse monoclonal antibodies were tested: anti-CD11b, anti-CD18, anti-CD43, and anti-CD45. Leukocytes were gated according to CD45. We used a sensitive sandwich enzyme linked immunoassay to measure the level of soluble vascular adhesion molecule as an indicator of endothelial cell activation. The R&D ELISA kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results: The CD43 was found down-regulated in the transfusiondependent MDS patients compared with the non-transfused ones (P < 0.001) and controls (P = 0.012). This downregulation concerned the proportion of CD43 + cells, that was lower in the transfused patients than the non-transfused (P < 0.01) and controls (P = 0.006), and the RFI (relative fluorescence intensity) value that was also lower in the group A compared to the group B (P < 0.01) and group C (P = 0.001). Negative correlation was observed between the CD43 expression and CD11b (P = 0.001) and CD18 (P = 0.001). CD11b was found up-regulated in the transfused patients. The RFI value was significantly elevated in the transfused patient compared with the non-transfused and controls (P = 0.001 and 0.001 respectively) while the percentage of CD11b cells did not differ significantly between the various groups. Increased expression of CD 18 was also found in the group A compared to group B (P < 0.01) and C (P = 0.008). The proportion of CD18 + cells did not differ between the various groups. The levels of immuno-reactive sVCAM-1 as determined by ELISA were found 512.02 + 35.56 in group A, 3.42 + 65 in group B and 194.11 + 45.48 in the control group. Conclusions: Activated hemopoietic and endothelial cells are found in MDS that may be associated to the vascular disorders found in these patients.

The small but significant residual risk of post-transfusion HCV infection during the 'windowphase' was the reason to implement HCV RNA testing in our laboratory. Materials and methods: Since 3/2000 a total of 123.346 donor samples were tested for the presence of HCV RNA in 24-samples mini-pools using the Hamilton-AT Plus as a pooling robotic system. Manual RNA extraction and RT-PCR by Cobas Ampliscreen v2.0 (Roche) were further performed. Donor samples were screened for the presence of HCV antibodies with ORTHO HCV 3.0 ELISA on the Ortho Summit Processor. Ortho HCV core Ag was alternatively used to confirm HCV RNA positive results. Results: On the 2/2/2005 the first positive pool was detected, followed by a single PCR which revealed a positive HCV RNA blood donation. The blood donor's liver function test has been found normal. The clinical examination of the blood donor has revealed enlarged lymph nodes of cervical, axillary's and inguinal nodes. The sample tested negative for HCV antibodies, by both Ortho Elisa system (S/CO: 0), and Axsym (S/CO: 0.2). Additional testing for the presence of HCV core Ag revealed a positive reaction (S/CO: 2.35) and confirmed the presence of HCV RNA. The patient is monitored every 7 days for the presence of HCV RNA, HCV cAg and HCV antibodies.Conclusion: HCV preseroconversion early phase of infection remains a problem for insuring transfusion safety. The results reported in this study suggest that the residual risk of HCV transmission might be substantially eliminated by testing mini-pooled donations for HCV RNA. Alternatively serological screening of individual donations for the presence of HCV core Ag might also prevent HCV transmission caused by the window phase donations.

Minority groups (gypsies, immigrants) are believed to carry a higher risk of hepatitis B and possibly hepatitis C infection. Aim: To determine the prevalence of hepatitis B and C infection among blood donors and in a minority group of pregnant women. Methods: We screened 5350 blood donors (BD) and 849 minority group pregnant women (PW) who were admitted without prior prenatal testing, in labor in the obstetrics department during the same period(2004). BD and PW were tested for antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) and surface antigen of HBV (HBsAg) and antibodies to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc). The positive for HbsAg or anti-HBc were further tested for HBV e antigen(HBeAg)and antibodies anti-HBe and anti-HBs. The screening tests were performed by Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA) technology with the AXSYM analyzer (Abbott). The anti-HBc positive without anti-HBs and the borderline HbsAg were further tested for HbsAg with the VIDAS Ultra Assay (Biomerieux) by Enzyme-Linked Fluorescent Assay (ELFA) technology.

Aims: A pilot study was performed in 8 centers to assess the reliability of the reconfigured BacT/ALERT system for sterility testing of platelet concentrates (PC) by systematic evaluation of all positive results using independent microbiological methods. Methods: In each transfusion center, samples from 500 consecutive PC prepared by apheresis or from buffy-coat pools were monitored for one week in both an aerobic and anaerobic culture bottle(BPA or BPN; bioMerieux). For all PC with a positive BacT/ALERT signal, retained samples and, if available, original PC containers and concomitant red blood cell concentrates were analysed independently. BacT/ALERT positive samples were analyzed by Gram staining and subcultured on solid media (columbia blood agar, chocolade agar, McConkey agar, Sabouraud dextrose agar and anaerobically incubated columbia blood agar; bioMerieux). Initially BacT/ALERT positive PC without bacterial identification in any sample were defined as false positive. BacT/ALERT positive PC with bacteria in the first sample only were called potentially positive. PC with bacteria in the first sample and the same strain in at least one additional sample were accepted as positive.Results:The total number of 4000 tested PC included similar numbers of apheresis PC (n = 2067; 51.7% of total) and of buffycoat pool PC. Five PC (0.13%) were positive, 9 PC (0.23%) were potentially positive and 35 PC (0.9%) were false positive. The rate of false positive BacT/ALERT results varied substantially between centers (<0.2-3.2%). Tracings from false positive cultures did not show the exponential increase of the signal during the incubation period. Most of these false positives were due to malfunctioning cells in various BacT/ALERT incubation units. Conclusions: Careful assessment of individual tracings of samples with positive signals helps to identify malfunctioning incubation units after conversion to the reconfigured BacT/ALERT assay. The early shutdown or replacement of such cells in the incubation unit substantially reduces the high rate of product rejects due to false positive alarms.

Methods: The serum of thirty-two patients with common specificities antibodies in Rhesus, Kell, Duffy, Kidd, and MNSs systems tested with commercially prepared 0.8% RBC panel (ID-Diamed). Gel tests were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions on indate RBC and simultaneously on RBC 1 month to 5 months past expiration. Reactivity of the expired antigen positive and antigen cells was compared to in-date cells. Results: Thirty-one antibodies [were tested. Twenty-five of 31 antibodies (D, c, E, K, k, Cw, Jk3) gave acceptable results with all cells tested and the reaction strength with antigens positive cells at 5 months post expiration was the same as in date cells. The remaining antibodies (4 anti-M, 1 anti-S, and 1 ant-Fyb) gave unacceptable results (some antigen-positive cells are non-reactive) even in panels with cells one month post-expiration. The decreased reactivity was due to antigen deterioration. Conclusion: Most RBC antigens studied were detectable 5 months after RBCs expiration date.

According to German guidelines, D-weak phenotypes are considered to be D-positive and should be transfused with Rhesus-D positive blood products. Except for D-weak types 4.2, 15 and 26 where immunization of recipients could be shown, other D-weak phenotypes were so far not found to induce development of allo-antibodies. Here we present a new weak D with an anti-D antibody in an African individual. Methods: Serological testing has been done with mono-and polyclonal anti-D sera (IgMs: BS226, BS 232, P3 \u00a5 61, P3 \u00a5 21 223B10; P3 \u00a5 21 211F1; IgGs: P3 \u00a5 35, P3 \u00a5 290, BS221; Biotest 'blend sera' and Diagast 'totem sera', 20\u00b0& 37\u00b0C). Total DNA was amplified in a multiplex PCR with fluorogenic primers for RHD exons 2-7, 9 & 10; polymorphisms for D-weak type 1-5, D-VII, D-HMi and RHCE polymorphisms for C, c, Cw, E, e. Capillary electrophoresis for size fractionation and fluorigeneic analysis was done in an ABI 310. Sequencing of RHD-sequences, including exons 1 to 10 and the intron/exon border areas, were performed with cycle-sequencing kits using BigDye-terminators v.1.1.Results: A. Serology: BS226 20\u00b0C: 4+; BS232 20\u00b0C: 3+; P3 \u00a5 21 211F1 20\u00b0C: negative; blend sera 20\u00b0C: 2+ and blend sera-IAT 37\u00b0C: negative. B. DNA: Multiplex PCR showed positive signals for eight RHD-specific exons as well as for RHC,RHc and RHe; reactions for weak D type 1-5 and DHMi were negative. After sequencing RHD exons 1-10, three differences to wild type sequence were found at exon 3 [C410T; codon 137:]; exon 4 [T509C; codon 170] and exon 5 [T667G; codon 223]. Conclusion: The substitution of the RHD-specific nucleotides 410, 509, 667 and their RHCE specific counterparts lead to an altered and weakened expression of the RhD antigen. Like other weak D types the amino acid changes lie in transmenbranous regions of the D antigen. Further investigations will be done especially reaction patterns with additional anti-D sera and determination of antigen density.

However, phenotypes have been identified with (type-specific) antigen densities between 70 and 5200 antigens per cell. These phenotypes are called weak D and are caused by amino acid substitutions on the intracellular and transmembraneous segments of the RhD protein. RBCs with weak D phenotypes occur in 0.2% to 1% of Caucasian populations. Until now, 41 different weak D alleles have been identified on molecular level of which weak D types 1 and 2 are most frequent and types 1 to 3 represent the majority of all weak D. A study among individuals from Tyrol and Northern Germany showed that the highest frequency of weak D is type 1 in Northern Germany (65%), and that type 3 has the highest frequency in Tyrol (50%). In Taiwanese population weak D types 1 (n = 1), 6 (n = 1) and 15 (n = 4) were found among 1 new unassigned weak D (codon 10V > M). In a Chinese HAN population of 95 blood donors 1 weak D type 15 and 2 DEL alleles were identified. All three studies indicate a high variability in the prevalence of weak D in Asian and Caucasian populations. Little is known about weak D frequencies in Black populations. Aims: The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of weak D in non-Caucasian populations. Methods: Five populations of different ethnic origin (700 Caucasians from The Netherlands (CN), 310 Blacks from South-Africa (BSA), 176 Blacks from Ethiopia (BE), 197 Blacks from Curacao (BC)and 319 Asians from South-Africa (ASA)) were screened with PCR-SSPs for the presence of weak D types 1 (809T > G), 2 (1154G > C), 3 (8C > G) and 4 (602C > G and 667T > G).

The clinically most important immunogenic glycoprotein of the neutrophil membrane is the FcgReceptor IIIb, where HNA-1a, -1b and -1c antigens are located. HNA genotyping is of high relevance for epidemiologic studies and serologic confirmation of an ANN diagnosis. Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the HNA genotype frequencies in the Croatian population and to compare them to HNA frequencies in Caucasian populations published elsewhere. Material and methods: DNA was isolated by Qiagen Blood Midi kit from 7 mL EDTA blood. HNA-1a, -1b and -1c genotyping was performed by PCR-SSP method modified according to Flesch et al. in 103 unrelated members of the Croatian population. Results: The HNA genotype frequencies were as follows: HNA-1a-, 1b+, 1c-0.427, HNA-1a+, 1b+, 1c-0.349, HNA-1a+, 1b-, 1c-0.155, HNA-1a+, 1b-, 1c+ 0.038, HNA-1a+, 1b+, 1c+ 0.019, HNA-1a-, 1b-, 1c-0.009, HNA-1a-, 1b+, 1c+ and HNA-1a-, 1b-, 1c+ not found.

Aim of the study: The aim of this study was: to determine prevalence of HCV infection among blood donors in north-eastern Poland, to describe trends in HCV prevalence in blood donors in years 1998-2003, to compare anti-HCV prevalence with markers of other blood borne infections (HBsAg, anti-HIV). Methods: We retrospectively analysed the results of screening tests for anti-HCV, HBsAg and anti-HIV of all blood donations collected in north-eastern Poland in years 1998-2004. Seroprevalence rate of seropositive donors was calculated and stratified by age, sex and the type of the donor (first time and repeat donors). Results: The prevalence of anti-HCV among first time donors decreased from 1.0% (2000) to 0.2% (2004). The number of anti-HIV positives among first time donors remained very low with maximum 0.03% in 2000.

With a prize as grand as a new automobile, some donors may be tempted to be economical with the truth in their responses to the donor questionnaire. It may not be just blood donors who are engaging in a game of chance. The proliferation of NAT testing has increased the pharmaceutical safety of blood, while driving up the cost of blood transfusion. The estimated cost of the quality adjusted life year gained (QALY) for HIV and HCV NAT ranges from $4.7 million for minipool NAT to $8.4 million for single-unit NAT. NAT testing has only reduced the risk for HIV transmission from 1.1 to 0.77 per million transfusions. The hospital side of blood transfusion has been neglected and is a fertile area for dealing with the noninfectious hazards of blood transfusion. Hospitals are experiencing continually increasing blood costs, however, and administrators are reluctant to put resources into technology such as barcoding that would help alleviate patient identification problems and reduce the number of mistransfusions. Conclusion: Transfusion safety efforts have focused primarily on the biological purity of blood components. This approach can result in unintended consequences that can make blood transfusion less safe overall. Transfusion specialists need to articulate the need for a broader view of transfusion safety.Background: Selective IgA deficiency (<5 mg/dl) is the most common primary immune deficiency disorders. IgA deficient individuals can form anti-IgA antibodies, which can cause life threatening anaphylactic reactions to transfusion of blood component containing IgA. Aim: The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of selective IgA deficiency in Indian blood donors using an in-house ELISA. Methods: In a cross sectional sero-epidemiological study, 3818 normal healthy voluntary blood donors were screened for IgA deficiency using in-house sandwich ELISA. IgA levels in the tested serum samples were measured after plotting the standard graph, which was prepared with standard containing known levels of IgA. Results: Sensitivity of the ELISA was found to be 0.05 mg/dl. Out of total 3818 blood donors screened for IgA deficiency, none of the donors had mean IgA <5 mg/dl. However, 257 (6.7%) of donors demonstrated partial IgA deficiency with mean IgA levels varying from 5 to 30 mg/dl. Conclusion: ELISA is a good quantitative assay for screened IgA deficiency in blood bank settings. IgA deficiency is not a clinically significant problem in Indian blood donor population.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF15": {"text": "Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) is the most important supplier of blood and blood products in Turkey.

We planned to register the frequency and type of adverse reactions observed in the specific group of volunteer blood donors who attend blood donation sessions organized by community-based associations and to correlate them with different factors (sex, age, number of donations). Material and methods: We analyzed data from 2660 blood donations over 10 months. The donors, 1657 men and 1003 women, belonged to community-based associations of volunteers (municipalities, parishes, army, teachers, employees etc.). Conclusions and comments: Careful selection of blood donors inevitably leads to a high rate of donor deferral (22.58%) especially among young persons. In order to avoid disappointment and loss of blood donors, members of the blood collection team need to be experienced and give all necessary explanations when deferring a blood donor. Persons temporarily deferred should be persuaded to return and those deferred permanently should be recruited as activists in recruiting volunteer blood donors.

Material and method: This was a cross sectional study that was done on all blood donors who referred to Shiraz blood transfusion center for blood donation. In this study we screened all blood after selecting blood by physician then we screen all blood for HIV1, 2 by ELISA then if the result of HIV was positive this sample was confirmed by western blot test. The finding of the study reveals prevalence rate of HIV in shiraz blood donors is low that is may be because of predonation counselling and appropriation donor selection and low rate of HIV in general population.

Conclusion: In this study, the main positive motivation for blood donation was helping others, which is very positive point. The most important negative motivation were fear of dizziness and faint or disease development as a result of donation. Education is an essential part of donor recruitment strategy. For safe blood supply we have to encourage people to donate blood only for helping others and don't donate their blood for health check up. To remove negative motivation is essential to aware general public about the safety of blood donation procedures and sufficient blood donor care.Background: Vasovegal reaction occurs in a small but significant number of blood donors.

Hemovigilance is not only surveillance of the patients bedside but on the contrary implies the all the steps in the transfusion chain, from blood donors to patients. Before the implementation of a national, standardized hemovigilance system, notification of transfusion reactions in Norway has previously been made in a non-systematical and incomplete way. Even more, a register of unexpected reactions to blood donation has never been systematically gathered in Norway. Materials and methods: The Norwegian Hemovigilance system was launched in January 2004 and is mainly based in a voluntary, anonymous model, in which both serious and less serious reactions are reported. Three members of the Norwegian Society of Immunology and Transfusion Medicine (NFIT) have been in charge for the establishment of Hemovigilance (www.hemovigilans.no) as well as the follow up of the reports. Both transfusion reactions and unexpected reactions to blood donation schemes have been elaborated, and approximately 50 Local Hemovigilance Officers were named all around the country. Results: The participation rate during the first year after the implementation of Hemovigilance in Norway was about 80%. By the end of the 2004 a total of 6 ABO incompatible blood transfusions have been reported, one of them ended with the dead of the patient. It was reported 14 IBCT, 9 HTR due to other than ABO antibodies, 3 TTI (all of them bacterial contaminations), 1 TRALI and 1 anaphylactic reaction.Conclusions:The first year experience in Norway with a national Hemovigilance system has been highly satisfactory.

Methods: From 1997-2003 SKAE collected data on adverse reactions and untoward events associated with blood transfusion, using standard forms for individual reports and aggregate hospital data. Type, severity and imputability of reactions and events were analyzed in relation to the degree of morbidity along the lines of the European Haemovigilance Network's standards and the recommendations of the Council of Europe. Results: 58 hospitals (60% of national total) consuming 1 510 924 units of blood components (38% of total blood supply) responded to SKAE. The table shows data on adverse reactions during the study period. The incidence of total and serious adverse reactions associated with blood transfusion was 8.6 : 10 000 units of blood components and 0.75 : 10 000 units, respectively. The figure for wrong blood transfused was 0.033 : 10 000 units of red cells. Only one case of TRALI was reported, in 2003. There was a very high incidence of non-haemolytic transfusion-associated reactions (51%) and allergic reactions (40%). Conclusions: SKAE has provided a reliable database for transfusion-associated reactions. During the period 1997-2003 one serious adverse reaction/event occurred for every 13 371 blood components. The incidence of incorrect blood component transfused was 1 : 305 185 units and one fatality per 1 510 924 blood transfusions. TRALI is recognized as due to transfusion, while TR-GvHD is under-recognized. Better reporting is expected with the implementation of the EU Directives. In this respect the recommendations of the Council of Europe and the contribution of the European Haemovigilance Network are valuable. reactions (Rxns). In addition to removing WBC, it is desirable to eliminate plasma proteins in RBC products. There are few studies on the efficacy of washed RBC for TP. Methods: An automated, closed system cell washing device (ACP\u00ae215; Haemonetics, USA) was used for TP with a history of transfusion dependency (30-35 RBC per year) and transfusion Rxns. Results: 29 patients with thalassemia major (15 males; 24 females; ages 1-40, mean age 24) with a history of severe allergic and/or febrile reactions and who had been transfused 30-35 units per year of leukoreduced RBC were selected for washed RBC. 96 RBC were transfused. None of the 29 recipients receiving washed RBC developed a Rxn. Mean pre-transfusion RBC protein content was 1.29 g/dl and 0.14 g/dl post-wash. The mean post-wash hematocrit of the RBC was 55.62%. Conclusion: Washed RBC can be very effective in preventing protein related and other transfusion Rxns in frequently transfused thalassemia patients.Background:In Slovenia the reporting of all adverse transfusion reactions (ATR) is mandatory, according to the Act on Blood Supply.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF57": {"text": "Blood products consumption MA POPOVSKY* and M MACRI \u2020 *Haemonetics Corporation, Braintree, MA, \u2020 A.O.R.N.

It is often a life-saving measure, but it has the potential of doing much harm. This should not deter the use of transfusion in clinical practice when indicated (Archer, R.K. et al.

They then separated in pyrexic, allergic, from circulation overload and others. Results: In a period of 3 years 15704 blood units had been given and 47 reactions (0.29%) had been noted in 46 patients (23 females and 13 males). Among them 13 were pyrexic, 25 were allergic, 3 were from circulation overload and 5 were others (hypotension, lumbago etc). In no case bacterial super infection had been noted. All the reactions were of a degree of I or II from severity point of view, except of one case which was of degree III and it had been showed up with hypotension and lumbago. Conclusion: The percentage of direct adverse reactions is minimal.

Results of the first year of national hemovigilance reporting in the Netherlands JC WIERSUM-OSSELTON and MR SCHIPPERUS TRIP Dutch National Hemovigilance Office, Den Haag, Netherlands Introduction: TRIP (Transfusion Reactions In Patients) Dutch Foundation for Hemovigilance was created with the objective of collecting reports on side effects and adverse events associated with blood transfusion ('transfusion reactions') in the Netherlands and reporting publicly on transfusion safety. Methods: Hospitals were asked to report transfusion reactions from January 2003. Definitions, a uniform reporting form and users' guide were sent to the hemovigilance officers in the hospitals. Report to TRIP are voluntary and anonymous. The reports were reviewed by an 'Expert Committee' appointed by the TRIP board. This report includes data on transfusion reactions in 2003 which had been received by 15 May 2004. Results: 82 (80%) of the 102 Dutch hospitals participated in 2003. 73 hospitals (72%) submitted reports and nine hospitals (9%) explicitly informed TRIP that no transfusion reactions in the TRIP categories had occurred. Seven hospitals (7%) indicated that they were not (yet) able to participate in 2003. TRIP received a total of 1092 reports of transfusion reactions in 2003 by the closing date. 303 of the 1092 reports (from 57 hospitals) were in the categories for which reporting was optional.

The number of reports submitted by hospitals varies considerably, even when the blood component use per hospital is taken into account. Conclusions: 80% of hospitals participated in the first year of a voluntary national hemovigilance system. Not all the forms are completely filled in although the TRIP (A4) reporting form is meant to sollicit all the data required.

Presently, the preventive measures that are directed against infection's level increasing may be provided by a higher quality of the clinical laboratory diagnostic services. According to the WHO recommendations, the instruments for quality control system are, basically, the standard panels with distinct titer of anti-HIV in serum samples. Therefore, this problem remains unsolved in our country which encouraged us to the present investigation. Aim of study: To create and develop HIV standard panels to improve the quality of laboratory diagnostic services and to decrease the speed of HIV infection distribution in place. Methods: 81 that of HIV positive WB-confirmed serum samples were diluted in the negative serum and checked by WHO recommended ELISA test kits. Finally, 36 specimens were obtained from 9 samples and were included into the Anti-HIV positive panel. All specimens were reanalyzed with 3 WHO recommended test kits and reconfirmed by Western Blot. Results: anti-HIV positive and negative standard panels were created and incorporated for Quality Control System organizing in Uzbekistan. Our study showed the possible methods of developing the standard anti-HIV positive and negative panels for improvement of Efficiency and Effectiveness of diagnostic laboratories, and also for HIV-ELISA test kits evaluation. Besides, there is shown an ability to derive the low-titer anti-HIV positive serum samples which is naturally difficult to obtain from the HIV positive patients. Furthermore, two locally manufactured ELISA anti-HIV test kits were evaluated with newly produced anti HIV positive and negative panels. The results, however, showed that a quality of the local kits is lower then that of WHO recommended criteria for ELISA tests sensitivity which must be higher then 99%. Conclusion: Applying of the created reference panels in Quality Control System gives an opportunity to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity the newly manufactured local ELISA test products that eventually must reduce the speed of HIV infection in population.P-156Anti-HBcore testing in blood donors as surrogate of other transmissible diseases by blood transfusion JL BLEJER, MC SAGUIER and HJ SALAMONE Favaloro Foundation, Buenos Aires, ArgentinaIntroduction: Anti-HBcore (a-HBc) testing in blood donors (BD) is questioned because of its low value as surrogate test and an important percentage of false positive results. In Argentina, most of the BD are fist time BD and the prevalence of markers for diseases transmissible by blood transfusion is about 10 times higher that in repeated voluntary BD.Aim of the study: to evaluate the role of the a-HBc testing as a surrogate marker of other transmissible diseases like retroviruses.

Campania Region has a high incidence of Hepatitis B infection, for this reason we have decided to implement the HBV DNA detection, in addition to HCV and HIV-1 RNA, in blood unit screening. Methods: We are detecting HBV DNA using a multiplex assay, that tests for HVI-1 RNA, HCV RNA and HBV DNA (Chiron Procleix Ultrio Assay). HBV DNA/HBsAg negative. Serological test (by AxSym Abbott) was positive for HBcAb in all samples. Quantitative HBV DNA assay (PCR by Nuclear Laser Medicine method) shows a different level of DNA in each sample. Only one sample was sequenced (by Visible Genetics method), at present. See table for summary results. Conclusions: Data shows the presence of occult Hepatitis B infections in Region Campania donors, with different serological HBV patterns and low level of circulating HBV DNA.

In our study, along with the mandatory hepatitis testing for HBsAg and anti-HCV, we tested the paid-donors for anti-HBc. Paid-donors attend our blood transfusion center several times during a year and are selected for ITT after each episode of blood donation. Aim of the study: Blood testing for anti-HBc was undertaken in order to complete the selection procedures of the donors (self-exclusion). Methods: Blood donors tested for anti-Hbc were asked about their risky behaviors according to a standardized questionnaire. None of the blood donors reported high-risk behaviors. Blood was tested for anti-HBc with ELISA -Gen. III. Results: Of 625 blood donors tested, the marker was found in 5 cases (0.8%). In all positive subjects, the anti-HBc was found 'solitary', i.e. not associated with HBsAg or anti-HVC. Conclusion: Subjects positive for anti-HBc were not detected during the selection procedures for blood donors. Our regulations, questionnaires, and the examination of blood donors are not sufficient to insure safe blood from paid-donors, because it is impossible to have correct data about their risk behavior. Therefore, the presence of anti-HBc positive cases among paid-donors is not surprising. Careful selection of blood donors as well as the improvement of blood testing techniques for infectious agents would enable a reduction of ITT risk. A shift from paid-donors to voluntary donors would be a big step forward.P-169 Anti-HIV antibodies in blood donors in the regions of Tetovo, Ohrid and Veles from 2000-2004th yearBP PETRUSEVSKA*, AM ALEKSIOSKA \u2020 , PL POCKOVA \u2021 and DN DIMOSKA \u00a7 *Medical Center Tetovo, Tetovo, \u2020 Medical Center Ohrid, Ohrid, \u2021", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF69": {"text": "Aim:To present the prevalence of HBV-Ag positive blood donators in these three regions which have different social, cultural and traditional conditions of life.Methods: The virus marcker in the Ohrid region is controlled in 7290, in Tetovo in 6357 and in Veles 10991 units of blood, with EIA of Abbot-tecnic.

Aims: Our goal was to evaluate in routine conditions the collection and preparation of platelets and RBC concentrates using Haemonetics MCS\u00ae+. Methods: 197 donors were recruited among a pool of regular apheresis donors complying to the French requirements for combined platelets and RBC collection (weight \u226550 kg, hemoglobin level \u226513.5 g/dL for men, \u226512.5 g/dL for women). 82% of the donors were male and 18% were female. Platelet and RBC concentrates were collected using the MCS\u00ae+ LDP-RBC protocol, AB16 anticoagulant (1:13 ratio) and LN946PF disposable sets integrating LRF6 and RC1H filters (Pall). The addition of SAGM (RBC preservative solution) and platelet filtration were automatically performed by the apheresis device. RBC filtration was performed by gravity, either at room temperature (RT) between 2 h and 10 h after collection (method 1) or after refrigeration at +4\u00b0C within 24 h after collection (method 2). In vitro quality of the leukoreduced RBC concentrates was evaluated before release for transfusion, by measuring volume, hemoglobin content, hematocrit and residual leukocytes. As they are equivalent to products collected with the current Haemonetics platelet only protocol, platelet concentrates were evaluated for platelet yield only and tested according to the applicable QC procedures. Results: (cf. table). The technique was easily implemented and fitted well in the existing blood centers processes. The collections were well tolerated as only a few mild citrate donor reactions were reported. All RBC results complied with the French regulatory characteristics for apheresis leukoreduced RBC concentrates: volume (without SAGM) of 125 mL, hemoglobin content \u226540 g, hematocrit between 50-70% and leukocyte level <1 \u00a5 10exp6 per unit.

The quality was assessed by measuring the standard indicators during the storage. Methods: 100 whole blood units (450 ml) were collected from healthy volunteer donors and stored at room temperature in insulated boxes for 4-6 h before filtration. After filtration, all units were filtered and centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min in Sorvall RC12BP and separated in LR-plasma, LR-red cell concentrate and LR-buffy coat by an automatic device (Compomat G4, NPBI). Single LR-buffy coats were held approximately 20 h at room temperature before pooling. 6 identical AB0 buffy coats were pooled with 250 ml of fresh plasma or platelet additive solution (Composol\u00ae), centrifuged and then separated. The platelet concentrates were stored for 6 days at 22\u00b0C. Samples were collected aseptically at day 1, 3 and 6 to measure cell count, pH, plt antigens expression such as p-selectin (CD62+) and PAC-1 (Facs Calibur-Becton Dickinson) before and after stimulation by ADP. The residual leukocyte number was counted by flow cytometry. PO 2 , PCO 2 , bicarbonate were measured by bloodgasanalyzer. Glucose, lactate and lactate-deidrogenase values were determined by standard enzymatic and colorimetric methods. Results: 14 PC units were prepared, 7 in plasma and 7 in Com-posol\u00ae, with a mean volume of 314 and 377 ml and a content of 334 and 344 \u00a5 109 platelets/unit, respectively. The mean residual leukocytes (resWBCs) were 0.208 and 0.488 \u00a5 106/unit. The pH values showed only slight variation during the storage and all units tested were between 6.9 and 7.3 at day 6. Platelet viability and responsiveness were well maintained. Platelets showed constantly very low PAC-1 expression, while P-selectin expression was found around 37% at day 1 in Composol and decreased during storage to 19%. The level of activation in plasma didn't show variation during the storage. Stimulation by ADP produced a 15-times increase of Pac-1 expression, which confirms the responsiveness of platelets at the end of storage. The level of blood gasses and metabolites certified a normal metabolic behavior. Conclusion: The present data demonstrate that whole blood filtration through the new CompoYield WBPS filter doesn't affect the platelet quality of the final concentrates.

Aim of the study: To determine of the correlations between cryopreserved and liquid stored platelets, investigating of cell quantity, morphological and functional recovery, surface antigen expression as well as platelet derived cytokine values. Materials and methods: PCs, 27 cryopreserved units vs 24 liquid-stored units were compared with fresh (control) cells. The first group PCs was cryopreserved by our own controlled-rate tech-nique, using 6% DMSO. The quantitative and functional recovery of platelets was compared before/after cryopreservation. The second one was investigated after storage up to five days at 20 \u00b1 2\u00b0C. The platelet count was determinated by Technicon H-3. The platelet morphology was investigated by phasecontrast microscope-Polyvar. Morphological score of platelets (MSP) was calculated on the basis of obtained platelet shapes distribution (discs = 4, spheres = 2, dendrites = 1, balloons = 0). Cell functions were estimated using hypotonic shock response (HSR) and aggregation with adenosin diphosphate (ADP). Surface antigens were investigated by monoclonal antibodies anti-CD41 (Serotec), anti-CD42b, anti-CD62p, anti-CD63 (CLB), and Annexin V-FITC (Roche), using Epics XL. The values of soluble p-selectin (human sP-selectin ELISA, Bender MedSystem) and soluble annexin V (Zymutest Annexin V ELISA, Hyphen Biomed) were also investigated and compared. Results: The recovery of cryopreserved platelets (frozen/thawed vs control) was (91.0%) significantly (P < 0.01) better than in 48 h liquid-stored vs control group (79.9%). Controlled-rate freezing resulted in better MSP-recovery (81.8%) in comparison with 48 h liquid-storage (79.1%) too. In addition, the percentage of discs was same in controlled-rate vs liquid-storage (57.9% vs 58%). Also, similar HSR-answer (68% vs 72%) and aggregation with ADP were obtained in controlled-rate group and liquid-stored platelets. Differences between cryopreserved vs liquid-stored or control for CD42b, CD62p, CD63 and PS were significant (P < 0.05). However, CD62p expression was considerable higher (P < 0.05) in controlled-rate vs liquid-storage setting. The values of soluble p-selectin were similar for frozen/thawed platelets (35.0 ng/mL) and liquid-stored cells (33.3 ng/mL). The values of soluble annexin V were different, but insignificant (2.67 vs 1.67 ng/mL) for these two investigated group. Conclusion: PCs cryopreserved by controlled-rate freezing (with compensation of released fusion heat) demonstrated high-quality, that is no inferior functional and morphological characteristic than 48 h liquid-stored platelets. Bacteremia is the main risk for contamination of stem cellsA KARAKASSOPOULOS* and G WALTHER-WENKE \u2020 *Red Cross Donor Service West, \u2020 Institute for Transfusion Medi, Muenster, GermanyBackground: Autologous stem cell products are at risk of bacterial contamination during collection and preparation procedures. Additional manipulations may increase the incidence of contamination, e.g. bag breakage at the time of thawing. Bacteremia of the patient at the time of harvesting is another risk factor. As bacterial contamination may cause severe complications in immunosuppressed recipients, principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and sterility testing of components are mandatory. Material and methods: From 1996 to 2004 a total of 2241 stem cell units have been processed out of 777 leukaphereses at 452 patients. From every unit samples were taken under sterile conditions for testing of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial growth in an automated blood culture system (BacT/AlertTM, bioM\u00e8rieux, Nuertingen, Germany). Results: 38 (1.7%) stem cell units turned out to be contaminated with coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS). All the corresponding patients showed positive blood cultures with CNS due to a central venous catheter infection. No additional contamination caused by processing and further manipulations of components was found. Conclusions: Stem cell processing following collection performed in a clean area according to the EU Guide to GMP, annex 1, seems to be a safe way to prevent microbial contamination of stem cell products. An inapparent infection of patients at the time of leukapheresis shows to be the main source of microbial contamination.P-353 Search for HLA compatible hematopoietic stem cells donors within the family E MATEJKOVA*, P KOVAROVA*, J VYTISKOVA*, M DOBROVOLNA*, M VRANA*, A VITEK* and P SEDLACEK \u2020 *Inst. of Haematology & Blood Transfusion, Prague, \u2020 University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech RepublicOptimal donors for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (HSCT) are genotypically HLA-identical siblings. If the patient has no siblings, an extended family typing may identify HLA phenotypically matched relatives. Such donors usually share one hap-lotype with the patient and another one is matched or partially matched with the patient. We analyzed HLA haplotype frequencies in our patients to optimize donor search strategy. In the period of 1995 to 2004 we examined a group of 1504 hematological adult and pediatric patients potentially indicated to HSCT. We performed an early search for related stem cell donors in their families (4950 family members). HLA-A, B, and -C typing was carried out by serology (using the standard NIH lymphocytotoxicity assay) in combination with DNA-typing. HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 were carried out by low resolution PCR-SSP. Overall 302 (20.1%) of the patients had HLA-identical sibling donor and for the next 46 (3.1%) patients HLA-acceptable family donors were identified. By using family segregation analysis we could determine HLA class I haplotypes in 690 patients. About 1/3 of patients inherited haplotypes common in Caucasian, circa 1% of patients had both haplotypes rare. 0%). During the last 10 years in our institute 316 allogeneic HSCT was performed. 171 (54.1%) of them were transplanted from matched or mismatched related donors. HLA typing within a patient's family is the first step of a donor selection. Probability of finding HLA-identical family donors decreases with descending number of children in a family, which is prevailing trend in the last decades, whereas rate of allogeneic transplantation from unrelated donors increases expressively. Expertise in HLA haplotypes frequencies and associations in our patients should help to design donor search strategy.

Compatibility in this region between a patient and his donor is an important condition for success of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Determination of acceptable HLA matching/mismatching is still evolving. We examined here a group of haematological patients indicated for HSCT. No suitable related donor was found for these patients. Unrelated donors were searched through bone marrow donor registries worldwide mostly as matched in HLA-A and -B based on serological typing and -DRB1 based on low-resolution DNA typing. The cohort consisted of 124 pairs of patients and their unrelated donors of HSC transplanted in our institute in the last 10 years. HLA class I loci -A, -B and -C and HLA class II -DRB1 and -DQB1 typing at high/medium-resolution level was performed in this cohort. PCR-SSP (polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific primers) or SBT (sequencing-based typing) methods were used. The best match donor for each patient was selected for the HSCT. Complete match in all tested HLA loci was reached in 50 pairs (40.3%) only. 34 patients (27.4%) were transplanted from the donor with one mismatch. Other 40 pairs (32.3%) carried at least two HLA mismatches.

HCMV viremia is a reliable marker of systemic infection.Polymorphonuclear leukocytes represent the major viral carrier among peripheral blood white cells during acute infection. Since no specific protein or viral DNA is detected in PMNL of normal subject, direct detection of viral protein or viral DNA in circulating PMNL by different techniques may defiantly represent active CMV infection or disease. Conversely, HCMV latency occurs in mononuclear leukocytes. Consequently, high purity of PMNL is the most important factor for accurate interpretation of the test results.

Death causes in patients suffering from beta thalassaemia major in Romania F VLADAREANU, I CONSTANTINESCU, D VOICU and L NITU National Institute of Heamatology Transf, Bucharest, Romania Beta thalassaemia major is a genetic blood disease manifested through severe anemia, starting under the age of 1 and dependency on red cells transfusions. The abstract presents the evolution of survivals and the death causes on a lot of 105 beta thalassaemia major patients monitored and treated by the National Institute for Transfusion Hematology in the time span 1994-2004. In Romania there are registered with the National Thalassaemia Registry 305 beta-thalassaemia major patients. More than 90% of the cases are originated in the south side of the country. The age limit is between a few months and 54 years, peaking between 15 and 20 years. The patients are predominantly males, and the medium number of transfusions is 20 per year. The red cells transfusion endows the organism with a surplus of iron which, in the absence of iron chelation therapy, lead to the organism charging up with iron and the occurrence of hemochromatosis. The deposited iron leads to organ insufficiency: cardiac, hepatic, pancreas, gonadic, etc. In Romania the treatment with Desferrioxamine (Desferal) began being administered systematically, regularly in 1996 through a health program. The studies done in a period of 10 years lead to the conclusion that the main death causes in patients with beta thalassaemia major are: arrhythmia and heart failure: 90% of cases; chronic hepatitis: 5% of cases; sudden death: 3% of cases; other causes: 2% of cases. A noteworthy aspect is that the survival age expectancy has increased by 15 years, in the scenarios involving instituting a continuous treatment with desferal.P-370 Genetic polymorphism of the HLA-DP region in Croatian V DRAZIC, J BINGULAC-POPOVIC, I BABIC, R KUNDID, M BALIJA and I JUKIC Croatian Institiute of Transfusion Med., Zagreb, CroatiaBackground: HLA region contains over 120 expressed genes and 40% of which are involved in the immune response.

About 50% of the general population and 90% of people infected with HIV carry CMV. Method and samples: We detected serumic anti-CMV antibodies (IgG, IgM) by ELISA and CD4, CD8 level by Flow Cytometry method. 45 HIV positive patients including 41 male (91%) and 4 female (9%), age between 20-53 years old, all of them were drug addicted. Results: The ratio of CD4+/CD8+ cells was low in 40 (88/8%) patients. CMV IgG antibodies were present in 100% of HIV positive patients but CMV IgM Antibodies in 10 (25%) was positive and 9 (22.5%) was border line. This study showed a significant correlation between Anti-CMV antibodies and CD4+/CD8+ level. Discussion: We observed that those patients who showed low CD4/CD8 level are more susseptible to CMV infection. Sodetection of CMV antibodies (IgM) is necessary with T-Cells level in HIV positive persons.

Cs. Bioqu\u00edmicas y Farmac\u00e9uticas-UNR, \u2020 Lab.de  Inmunohemorreolog\u00eda, Rosario, Argentina    During storage at 4\u00b0C, red blood cells undergo biochemical and physicochemical modifications, which alter their rheological properties, especially deformability. They have a time-dependant echinocytic shape transformation, which also increase the suspension viscosity. Deformability is undoubtedly a function of whole cell elasticity and viscosity. The aim of this work was to study red blood cells morphology under bank conditions storage by two different methods: flow cytometry and light microscopy. Whole blood obtained from 20 healthy adult volunteers (35 \u00b1 8 years olds) was stored in CPD-adenine for study. All units were stored at 4\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C and one aliquot was taken seven days after donation. Red blood cells morphology was first assessed by Zipursky-Forconi method (S. Forconi, M. Guerrini, V. Turchetti, F. Leoncini, C. De Matteis, and L. Trabalzini, 'Evaluation of erythrocyte morphology as deformability index in patients suffering from vascular diseases, with or without diabetes mellitus: correlation with blood viscosity and intra-erythrocytic calcium', Clinical Hemorheology and microcirculation, 18, 141-149 (1998)) which is characterised by the observation of the erythrocytes suspended in a viscous medium with light microscopy after treatment with PBS containing 0.3% glutaraldehyde, which fixes red blood cells. In each aliquot 100 erythrocytes were observed and classified according to Bessis criteria. (M. Bessis, R. I. Weed and P. F. Le Blond, Red Cell Shape, Chapter 1.(Springer- Verlag, New York, 1973)) (normal forms: 'bowl' and discocytes and pathological forms: knizocytes, echinocytes, keratocytes, dacrocytes, acanthocytes). Each sample was analysed in parallel by flow cytometry after same treatment. The results of light microscopy show that the mean percentage of normal morphology (the most deformable class) was significantly decreased in the samples taken on the seventh day, whereas the altered erythrocytes (echinocytes) were significantly greater. Flow cytometry results also showed that there was an important deviation of specific parameters (FS and SS) from normal morphology. Transformation discocyte-echinocyte is influenced by many factors such as depletion of ATP, increase of intracellular calcium, changes in pH, alteration in the composition of the cell membrane). During storage, lyso-phosphatidylcholine is produced from phosphatidylcholine, which accumulates in cell membranes and is a potent echinocytogenic stimulant. Even though the potential reversibility of RBC shapes transformations, these alterations in their geometry and deformability may alter rheological properties and consequently transfusion effectiveness (R. Rasia, J. Valverde, M. Garc\u00eda Rosasco. 'Blood storage. Haemorrheologic, haematologic, inmunohaematologic and bacteriologic studies' . Sangre, 1998; 43 (I): 71-76). The data obtained with flow cytometry are in agreement with that observed by Zipursky-Forconi method. We consider they can be used in a complementary way to evaluate the RBC alterations as the storage time increases.Introduction: Blood is a precious and scarce resource with limited shelf life. Its collection and processing requires resources in term of money, material and manpower. Collected blood/components may be discarded due to various reasons which may differ according to the local factors and the corrective actions required may differ from center to center. This may affect the utilizable blood stock at the center and serve as performance indicators for the center. Therefore blood services should audit their blood discarding routinely. Aim: To review the amount and type of blood/components discarded and reasons for discarding. Methods: Study was conducted at a hospital transfusion service which is part of 650 bedded tertiary care academic Institution. Data was collected retrospectively from 1st January to 31st December 2004. Details of all blood components discarded and reasons were retrieved from blood/component discarding register and computerized hospital information system. Data was analysed component wise and reason wise. Reasons for discarding were categorized into three main categories (i) Transfusion transmissible disease marker reactivity; (ii) Outdating; and (iii) In dated wastage, with detail analysis within these broad categories. Discarding rate, unit expiration rate, wastage rate and miscollection rate was calculated. Results: 14 722 units of allogenic blood was collected from replacement and voluntary blood donors according to local drug and cosmetic act in SAGM containing triple or quadruple blood bags. Policy is to process 100% of collection into components. Components could not be prepared from 44 units and were discarded as whole blood. From the rest 14 678 units of red cell component (SAGM-RBCs), 822 units of random donor platelets (RDP), 11 551 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 2496 units of cryopoor plasma (CPP) and 2380 units of cryoprecipitate (cryo) were prepared. Of these 6.2% of SAGM RBC, 6% of RDP, 7.4% of FFP, 9.2% of CPP and 9.5% of cryo were discarded due to various reasons. Around 4-5% of components were discarded due to TTD marker positivity. Outdating rate was highest for RDP (2%) as compared to 0.82% for SAGM-RBCs18.3: ETHICS IN TRANSFUSION MEDICINE -ERROR REPORTINGand in the permanent surveillance of the system and health care providers.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF169": {"text": "Material and methods: 36 blood donors without history of hepatitis or iron disorders, 95 patients with chronic Hepatitis B (Ag HBs > 6 months) and 100 patients with Hepatitis C were evaluated between October 2003 and June 2004.

In contrast to AABB guidelines, BCSH do not require serological confirmation of the ABO/Rh type of the donor unit. BSCH accepts the guarantee from the blood supplier for the accuracy of unit ABO/Rh group. Because the developing countries do not have regular donors and as many of the donations are from first time donors, they have difficulty to guarantee the accuracy of the ABO/Rh label on these units to be used for E-XM. In this study, we tried to overcome this problem by using a new blood banking software 'Hemosoft' using donors ABO blood group declaration before donation as a tool for E-XM. Materials: Computer needs at least two ABO/Rh results (done manually by using gel card), one from the current sample, on file for different occasions in order to accept it for E-XM. During donor interview, donors either declare their blood group or gave no comment. For the donors' ABO/Rh grouping, we need at least two data, either two results from different donations or only one which is in concordant with the donor ABO/Rh declaration before donation. If there is conflict between donor's declaration and the current typing results, a second typing is performed from the segment of the intended bag. In addition, if the donor gives no declaration, two different technicians perform typing, one from the tube collected during phelobotomy and the other from the segment of the bag.Confirmation of the ABO/Rh typing of the units coming from other centers are also done in order to be used for E-XM. Results: Between January-December 2004, 18 618 donations were performed. 15 913 were for whole blood. 640 (4%) of them were repeated and the rest were first time donations. In 16 327 donations, ABO/Rh was performed once as the blood group declaration and the results we found were the same. In 2291 donations grouping was performed twice as donors gave no declaration or there was a conflict between donor declaration and our typing results. 2102 units received from other institutions were also typed and we found 2 discrepancies. No donor unit labeling or wrong donor unit release errors were detected in units donated, typed and labeled in our center. 26 402 XMs were performed during that time period. 9108 of these XMs were performed as an immediate spin-XM as these were the first samples from that patient. 980 of the XMs were performed at indirect antiglobulin phase as these patients' antibody screening were either positive or had a history of irregular red cell antibody. Rest of the XMs (16 314) (61.2%) were done using E-XM. No major hemolytic transfusion reaction was recorded during this time period. Conclusion: First time donors' ABO/Rh group declaration before donation can be used as a tool for E-XM, instead of the requirement for serological confirmation of the ABO/Rh type or waiting for the second donation to guarantee the ABO/Rh grouping.P-383Routine antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis, is it appropriate?

To meet the demands of the current climate in health care the clinical laboratory have leveraged staffing through automation. The fully automated column agglutination technology (Auto-Vue) was brought into our district General Hospital, with the intent to supplement the technical staff with automation and evaluate its usefulness for corporate wide implementation. Methods: Validation was performed by parallel testing samples comparing the conventional tube test (TT) with the fully automated system, Auto-Vue, during 1997. Ortho BioVue System cassettes were used: 1. Anti-A/Anti-B/Anti-D/Control/Reverse Diluent, 2. Anti-C/Anti-E/Anti-c/Anti-e/Anti-K/Control, 3. Reverse Diluent, 4. Anti-IgG -C3d: Polyspecific. Results: Auto-Vue compared to TT, has given accurate results and was found to be an effective method for blood group typing, for RBC antigen typing, for Rh typing of adult and cord cells, for Kell typing, for Rh Ag typing and realizes a labor savings with no washing required prior to a Du test and for cross match technique. During 1/8/2003 to 28/5/2004 were tested 25.928 samples using Anti-A/Anti-B/Anti-D/Control/Reverse Diluent, Anti-C/Anti-E/Anti-c/Anti-e/Anti-K/Control. (results agreement 98.7%).

Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the serious manifestations of CAD. Complete detection of associated risk factors and triggers is crucial for successful treatment of MI. Previously published data suggest higher frequency of MI in patients with ABO blood group allele B. Aim of the study: The aim of the study was analysis of ABO blood group distribution among patient suffering from (MI) in the region of the Middle Moravia. Methods: We examined 325 patients with (MI) documented on coronary angiography during year 2004. Blood group analyses (standard hemagglutination, DiaMed) were provided in 199 men, mean age 67.9 years (46-91), and 126 women, mean age 73.5 years (51-94). The findings were compared with blood group distribution in population of 7961 people from neighbouring region. Results: ABO blood group phenotype distribution. Patients (n = 325) vs controls (n = 7951): Phenotype O n = 108 (33.2%) vs n = 2569 (32.31%) P = 0.727. Phenotype A n = 133 (40.9%) vs n = 3258 (40.97%) P = 0.986.

Aims of the study: To investigate Bernard Soulier in Iran and evaluate the clinical sign and laboratory findings of patients. Methods: 72 patients with Bernard Soulier who had been submitted by coagulation laboratory of Iranian Blood Transfusion Service since 1980 to 2001 were studied. The tests included platelet count, platelet morphology, bleeding time, clot retraction, specific tests for PF-3 activity, glass adhesion, platelet aggregation by aggregating agents. The information regarding all patients had been used. Results: It was revealed that only 18% of patients were diagnosed before age of 5.The number of male patients were 6% more than females. Only 7% of patients had been diagnosed during one year after episode of mucosal bleeding. Consanguinity has been noted in parents of 77% of patients.

In these cases, there is an increase in the frequency of bleeding, which entail risk of death if an internal organ is affected (e.g. CNS). INH is an antibody with high affinity exhibiting first order kinetics.The treatment of bleeding with exogenous FVIII is not effective in this case. From the various treatments suggested (CCPA, CCPI, porcine FVIII, immunetolerance regimes), rFVIIa obtained by genetic engineering (*NovoSeven\u00a9, Novo Nordisk Pharma Argentina S.A.) is currently considered as the first-line treatment. Aim of study: To demonstrate the decrease of INH titre during treatment with rFVIIa. Methods: INH detection and factors VII and VIII dosages were performed with a BCT Dade Behring autoanalyzer. The INH presence against FVIII was confirmed by means of EIA to detect IgG antibodies reacting with human recombinant FVIII (FVIII Inhibitor Assay; GTI diagnostic, Waukesha, WI 53186-4054, USA).

The BCs are subsequently processed into platelet concentrates (PCs) by soft centrifugation and an additional (manual) expression step. The Atreus 3C system (Gambro BCT) eliminates several of those hand-on steps by combining them into one integrated process. A processing 'circular' bag is placed in the device and filled with the WB. While the bag is centrifuged, the system expresses PL, PC and RCC into separate containers. The RCCs are subsequently leukoreduced (manually) with a filter (LR-RCCs). This study was designed to evaluate the storage characteristics of the RCCs obtained with a prototype of the Atreus system in comparison to RCCs obtained by routine procedure. Methods: Whole blood (500mL) was collected in top-and-bottom bags, and randomly selected to be processed by either (1) current routine or (2) Atreus 3C. RCCs were leukoreduced with the integrated inline filter: Fresenius (routine group) or Pall RC2D (Atreus). LR-RCCs were stored at 4\u00b0C and sampled until day 42. Various in vitro measurements were performed (n = 20 per group).Results: See table (mean \u00b1 SD). The LR-RCCs contained significantly more leukocytes in the Atreus group. Despite the RBC loss in the BC, hemoglobin (Hb) content was 6% lower in the Atreus group, but met the requirements. In vitro storage characteristics for the RCCs were similar in both groups. The Atreus PCs contained 73 \u00b1 28 \u00a5 10 9 platelets in 78 \u00b1 6 mL.

Methods: PC's were manufactured from WBD-PC's using in-line filtration of PRP on day 0. On day 1, either 4, 5, 6, or 8 PC's were pooled into an ELX\u00ae container using a sterile connecting device. Studies were performed on days 1, 5 and 7 for the following measure of platelet quality. pH, morphology score (MS), extent of shape change (ESC), hypotonic shock response (HSR), percent in surface expression of P-selectin (P-Sel), phosphatidyl serine (PS), glycoprotein 1b (GP1b) and by thromboelastography of the PRP (Maximum Aplitude, MA). Results: A total of 20 pools were studied, 5 each of 4, 5, 6 and 8 PC's. The mean platelet yield was 4.3 \u00a5 10E11 with a range of 2.4-7.0 \u00a5 10E11. The five 8 PC's had a mean yield of 6.0 \u00a5 10E11 and all maintained a pH > 7.0 on day 7. All products had less than 1 \u00a5 10E6 residual WBC. Platelet quality data is presented in the Table.

Introduction: The big progress in treatment of critically ill children significantly increases the need for blood and blood products. Loss of blood (lowering of the total erythrocyte mass), as well as decreasing of oxygen capacity of blood that can influence cardiovascular function, is main indication for the erythrocyte transfusion. Aim of the study: To present the number of erythrocyte concentrates (EK) that were issued to the Pediatric Clinic in Skopje, as well as to point out how they were distributed. Material and method: This is a retrospective study performed in NITM-Skopje from January till May 2004. The following criteria were followed: Hemoglobin (Hb), Hematocrit (Htc), as well the clinical evaluation, and then final decision for transfusion was made.Results: There were 254 blood units (EK) issued for the mentioned period to Pediatric Clinic for 73 pediatric patients (~3, 5% units/per child). The biggest consumers are children at intensive care unit and at the hematology-oncology unit. One unit of leukodepleted erythrocytes (Er) was split equally to 3-5 bags. For small and prematurely born children and for some other selected patients Er unit was filtered and irradiated. The dosage was 25-100 ml Er (depends on age and body weigh). 173 EK was issued as washed concentrates, 15 EK were filtered and 25 EK were resuspended in AB plasma. Distribution among ABO system was the following: Conclusion: Gynecologic patients consumed RBC more than 4 times than obstetric ones (159 vs 44) and the number of given transfusions is high. The A blood group is the most needed one. We should insist on using the WHO guidelines for the proper clinical use of blood and try to minimize the percentage of given transfusion. and Z. CERMAKOVA University Hospital, Ostrava, Czech Republic Background: Fully automated system OLYMPUS PK 80 is an immunohaematological analyser for detection of red blood cells antigens of AB0, Rh (D, C, c, E, e) and Kell systems without centrifugation by MAM (Microplate Agglutination Method) on unique terraced microplate Olympus. In the Czech Republic Analyser PK 80 is used only in Blood Center Ostrava. Aim: To evaluate the validity of results, sensitivity of microplate agglutinaton method, cause of abortive tests, requirements for analyst, capacity and reliability. Methods: 95 880 blood samples of donors were tested between July 2002 and January 2005. All samples were analysed for AB0 blood group. 69 052 samples were tested for RhD antigen and 15 220 ones for Rh (C, c, E, e) and K antigen. The validity of the results was evaluated for AB0 with parallel testing antigens and antibodies, while for Rh (D, C, c, E, e) and K using two diagnostic serums. Sensitivity of MAM i.e. occurrence false negative or positive results were found out when results were confronted with previous ones in our data bank acquired testing classical manual tube or microplate methods. Requirements for analyst were evaluated in according to demands for needful knowledge for new analyst, necessity of control PK during testing and maintenance. Capacity were evaluated as a number of samples tested per day. Reliability determine by occurrence disorders. Results: AB0, Rh (D, C, c, E, e) and K were investigated truly by first testing at 99.5% samples. Two diagnostic serums anti-D Olymp IgM and Totem differentiate directly RhD negative and RhD positive donors. False negative or positive results were not founded out due to MAM or quality of diagnostic serums. About 0.5% samples with abortive tests were analysed next time the same testing or manual technique. Causes of abortive tests were microagglutination several samples except for anticoagulative EDTA, weak solution of red blood cells prepared by analyser, damage of microplate, hemolysis due to impurity of microplate. In one case analyser evaluated false AB blood group due to hemolysis. Analyser has friendly software, simple maintenance and sound control during testing, capacity about 400 samples per day and minimal occurrence of weighty disorders. Conclusion: Analyser Olympus PK 80 is an effective alternative full automation for medium serological laboratory and together with MAM easy and truly proves blood groups of majority samples with minimal necessity repetition due to abortive tests.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2919, "end": 2925, "text": "Table.", "ref_id": null}], "section": "P-336"}, {"text": "Introduction and aim of the study: The purpose of this study is to establish Nested-PCR for the detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in blood and blood products.

Since that time till now it has answered to all demands in blood and blood components. Aim: The aim is to present development of the transfusiology department in the last 20 years, so that we could see how much of scientific knowledge we have adopted and in which direction our department goes at the moment. Method: Retrospective analysis of blood/component utilization in period from 1. January 1984 to 31. December 2004. Results: In 1984 whole blood participated in the consumption with 84.18%, packed red blood cells with (RBC) only 5.94%, washed RBC were used in 9.87% of the cases. In 2004 whole blood participated in the consumption with 31.5%, packed RBC with 61.65%, washed RBC with 0.14% and RBC in additive solution with 6.71%. As far as plasma preparations are concerned, there has been, since 1984, a great consumption of plasma -witch was separated from whole blood in period up to five day in 97.1% cases, and small consumption of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) only 2.9%. Since 2003, there has completely been cancelled the production of five day old plasma, only FFP is being used. From 1984 to 2002 for the patients who needed platelets, platelet rich plasma (PRP) was prepared and applied right after preparation. The consumption rate was from 35 units to 103 units per year. In 2002, after the purchase of platelet shaker, began the production of platelet concentrates (PC) and consumption suddenly rose from 58 units in 2002 to 462 units in 2004. Conclusions: It is obvious from the analysis that irrational consumption of whole blood was reduced to more acceptable values and therefore the use of component therapy got increased. Variation in blood consumption and its slight increase is obvious though application red blood cells was conducted according to strict indications. In 2003 the production of plasma old up to five days was cancelled and instead we produced only FFP. PC we prepared for patients only in agreement of treating physician.

The mentioned system has been evaluated using the suitable, Quadruple LEU-COFLEX LCR5 T/T CPD/SAGM (MACOPHARMA). Whole blood 450 ml in CPD was collected from random donors. In both groups the whole system was stored at scaled R.T. 20 \u00b1 2\u00b0C for 2 to 5 h. After component separation (BECKMAN COULTER J6MI-optipress I-BAXTER), the red cell concentrates were filtered immediately at R.T. 20 \u00b1 2\u00b0C. Sampling was done after filtration and WBC measurements were determinated using Nageotte champer (Bright Line-Detection Limit 0.05 WBC/ml) with Leucoplate solution (SOBIODA). The other parameters were measured with (Celldyne 1700 ABBOTT). Conclusion: All products met the accordance of national and European norms for blood components quality. Leucodepletion with Leucoflex LCR5 and ABC Leucoflex LCR5 (5.040 and 5.015) is highly efficient. The use of ABC Leucoflex LCR5 showed better scaled donation in terms of collection (statistical analysis Mann-Whitney, Minitab P-value = 0.0392 < 0.05). Additionally less Hb-loss occurred, due to the filtration process, most probably due to the total absence of clots (analysis Man-Whitney, Minitab, P-value = 0.0382 < 0.05). This new generation of collection gives the ability in blood services to collect well calibrated donations, indoors or outdoors. Smaller quantities of donations theoretically can be valid because of the stable 7 : 1, rate of donation. The ABC system gives the ability of fully traceability during donation. Macopharma's blood collection bags, with or without integrated filters, provided they have this modified system of storing the AC. The device can keep records for many parameters and can transfer them to the data base server of the Blood Center. To evaluate the performance of the ABC, we conducted a comparative study between ABC Leucoflex LST1 system and Leucoflex LST1 system we currently use. The later is a well known Macopharma's system for collection of whole blood with integrated whole blood filter and the final production of one unit of leucodepleted CRCs and one unit of leucodepleted plasma. The ABC was handled with the same system modified with the storage bag for the AC. Issues of comparison were the accuracy in donation volume, the duration of filtration, the loss of blood in the filter and the residual WB Cells after filtration. We performed 24 donations with the LST1 system and 28 donations with the ABC LST1 System. All the donors were random male volunteers and they were meant to donate 450 mls of whole blood. Our results analysed by Mann-Whitney, MINITAB statistical analysis have as follows:1. No significant difference was found between the two systems concerning the whole blood volume, but there was broader distribution of the values in the LST1 system compared to the ABC LST1 system. 2. The duration of filtration has been found without statistically significant differences between the two systems. 3. The loss of volume in the filter of LST1 is higher than in the ABC LST1 (P = 0.007 < 0.05, which is statistically significant). 4. There was very good leucodepletion with the LST1 systems (median reduction of the WB Cells 4.7 log) but there was a superiority of the ABC LST1 over the LST1 concerning the leucodepletion per litter and per unit (P: 0.0368 and P: 0.0398 respectively). 5.

Median time of priming was 90 s (range 40-300) and of filtration was 12 min (range 8-20). 2. The median volume lost in the filter (as calculated) was 23.4 ml (ranging from 22.4 to 28.1). This narrow range is apparently due to the non-flexible cell of the filter. 3. The efficiency of the leucodepletion was counted by flow cytometry. The median WBC counted per lt was 0.9 \u00a5 106 (range 0.3-2.1 \u00a5 106) and per unit was 0.17 \u00a5 106 (range 0.05-0.5 \u00a5 106).

Objective: Standardization of blood banks and establishing quality assurance are important landmarks in the new era of Transfusion Medicine. As the number of blood banks grows and the capacities of them changes, centralization need arises and trends to nationally coordinated blood services eventually appear. Aim: To investigate the types and capacities of blood bank in the country and evaluate the statistics of them. Material and method: Blood Banks and Transfusion Society of Turkey conducted a nation-wide survey of a comprehensive questionnaire. This is a preliminary report of this investigation and illustrates the capacities of the most blood banks in Turkey. It also guides the nationally planned renewing structure of blood banks. Results: There are nearly 340 blood banks and blood stations in whole country. The overall blood collected at those centers is about 1.800.000 units. Nearly one in third is being collected at government hospitals (31.5%), nearly the same is collected at university hospital blood banks (29.6%). The third major group is the Red Crescent Society Blood Centers-RCSBC (23.5%), followed by the social security hospitals (12.9%). Blood collecting capacities are not appearing in the same order. The major blood banks belong to the RCSBCs, whereas the small ones are mostly government hospitals. The only donor recruitment organization is run by the RCSBCs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "L DADIOTIS, C ALEPI, M DIMOU, A KOLOKYTHA, I HALIORI, A LENAKAKI, I IOANNIDIS and S PRODROMIDOU Tzaneion General Hospital, Pireas, Greece"}, {"text": "Yearly blood collecting capacity Blood banks (%) >50.000 0.4 20.000-50.000 4.8 10.000-20.000 8.7 5.000-10.000 13.8 <5.000 72.3Conclusion: There are many steps for improving blood safety in a country, and the prior ones are structuring the blood transfusion system and donor organization on a national basis, and then establishing good manufacturing practices. These are only possible after centralization of all existing blood banks. In our country, we should first arrange all small capacity blood banks and standardize them.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "7GPA19 -"}, {"text": "Controversial clinical questions considered in a medical opinion forum by physicians for the advancement of transfusion medicine (PATM)", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "W-PA-124"}, {"text": "PATM is a newly formed group of close to 300 physicians drawn from pathology and hematology, transfusion services, hospital blood banks and blood centers. Its mission is to address the concern that patient oriented medical opinion and influence has been diminished in transfusion medicine (TM). They believe that a patient oriented voice should be distinct from institutional, commercial or regulatory weight and have a common focus on patients and the therapeutics of transfusion and related therapies. Therefore, their first objective is to create a new medical, patient oriented voice that weighs in on national policy pertaining to treatments related to TM. As such, PATM held its first Medical Opinion Forum where members of the group debated important questions pertaining to TM clinical practice. The forum was held just prior to the AABB annual meeting and attracted 58 physicians. The questions debated were preselected by PATM membership via an email survey. Respondents were asked to select their top four preferences from among 17 topics in five broad categories. The top two topics were selected for the forum from the 80 completed surveys. The subjects selected and debated were (i) what are the medical considerations for reducing the rate of mistransfusion? and (ii) what are the medical considerations for managing a limited blood inventory? The participants were divided into four groups, with each topic assigned to two groups. All the groups were given two h to debate and arrive at consensus on their topic. Each group then presented a summary of their discussions along with specific recommendations for addressing these clinical practice issues. There was remarkable consensus between the groups debating the same issue. The conclusions and recommendations on these two topics will be presented in detail. PATM is a new organization that will add an important medical voice and opinion on current topics in TM. At its first meeting, two topics were successfully discussed and debated with broad consensus achieved on current issues confronting the field.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RL JONES New York Blood Center, New York, NY, USA"}]}
