            "text": "Eight virus families whose members infect vertebrates are currently known to possess single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes: the families Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae and Hepeviridae have nonenveloped capsids, whereas the families Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae are characterized by enveloped capsids. They all have in common the property of using their own genome as messenger RNA (mRNA), from which they synthesize one or several polyproteins that are subsequently cleaved into individual proteins by viral or cellular proteases. These viruses possess the genetic information for the synthesis of an RNAdependent RNA polymerase. This enzyme transcribes the positive RNA strand as well as the complementary negative RNA strands, which arise as intermediate products of genome replication. In the course of this process, the new genomic RNA molecules are generated from the second transcription step. The classification into the different taxonomic families depends on the number, size, position and orientation of viral genes in the RNA molecule, the number of different polyproteins that are synthesized during viral infection and the existence of an envelope as a virion component.",

            "text": "The prototypic member of picornaviruses was discovered in 1898 by Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch, who described the pathogen of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD; also referred to as hoof-and-mouth disease) as a filterable agent, thus demonstrating the existence of animal pathogenic viruses for the first time. Karl Landsteiner and Emil Popper published an article in 1909 which reported the identification of a virus as the pathogen of poliomyelitis, a disease that was described for the first time by Jacob von Heine in 1840 and later also by Oskar Medin. That these viruses are able to cause a cytopathic effect in cultures of human embryonic cells was demonstrated by John F. Enders, Thomas H. Weller and Frederick C. Robbins in 1949;  however, the actual characterization as poliovirus was ascertained by Herdis von Magnus and co-workers only in 1955. Coxsackievirus was discovered by Gilbert Dalldorf in 1947, when he infected newborn mice with virus-containing material and observed paralysis in the treated animals. The virus was named after the town Coxsackie in the federal state of New York, where it was isolated from a patient. Owing to different paralysis characteristics that they cause in newborn mice, coxsackieviruses have been subdivided into two groups, A and B. In addition to these viruses, there are also human pathogenic picornaviruses which in contrast to coxsackieviruses do not cause any signs of paralysis in newborn mice, but are associated with a lethal outcome within a few days: echoviruses and parechoviruses. The eponymous acronym \"echo\" stands for some viral properties: enteric, cytopathogenic, human, orphan; the last term indicates that no disease could be associated with the viral infection at that time. The multifarious symptoms that are caused by these viruses were discovered later and include diarrhoea, eczema and in rare cases also encephalitis and meningitis.",

Feinstone and colleagues in 1973. However, the successful cultivation of this virus was only achieved in 1979; it was assigned to the picornavirus family in 1982.

            "text": "The family Picornaviridae is classified into the order Picornavirales together with the families Dicistroviridae, Iflaviridae, Marnavidirae and Secoviridae. Whereas members of the families Dicistroviridae and Iflavividae infect various species of insects and other invertebrates, those belonging to the families Marnaviridae and Secoviridae are pathogenic in algae and plants. The family Picornaviridae comprises a large number of virus groups and virus types (Table 14 .1) that infect vertebrates. The members of this family can cause completely different disorders in humans, and partially also severe diseases. The name \"picorna\" is an abbreviation that alludes to two molecular properties of the virus family, i.e. small (pico) viruses with an RNA genome. The classification of picornaviruses into 17 genera is based on their respective molecular-biological properties, sequence homologies as well as on the diseases they induce: Enterovirus, Parechovirus, Hepatovirus, Cardiovirus, Sapelovirus, Teschovirus, Kobuvirus, Aphthovirus, Erbovirus, Avihepatovirus, Tremovirus, Senecavirus, Aquamavirus, Cosavirus, Dicipivirus, Megrivirus, and Salivirus. More than 150 known human pathogenic viruses that belong to the genus Enterovirus have been newly classified on the basis of new sequence data of the viral genomes. Until recently, human rhinoviruses were also assigned to the genus Enterovirus, which comprises a large number of different species and types of viruses which can infect both animals and humans. Today, this genus is subdivided into 12 species, namely enteroviruses A-I and rhinoviruses A, B and C. All species differ by certain molecular properties (e.g. human enteroviruses A and B differ from human enteroviruses C and D by distinct sequence elements within the 5 0 untranslated region, UTR) and/or in regard to their infection courses. Owing to its similarity to human enterovirus C, poliovirus has been assigned to this species; however, poliovirus differs from human enteroviruses by its property of causing poliomyelitis. Genome sequencing revealed that many of the different types of coxsackieviruses, enteroviruses and echoviruses have arisen by genetic recombination between various enteroviruses. For example, the animal pathogenic swine vesicular disease virus is a recombinant between the genomes of human coxsackievirus B5 -from which the coding region for the structural proteins is derived -and echovirus 9, from which the sequences encoding the non-structural proteins originated. Aichi virus, a member of the genus Kobuvirus, is widely spread as a pathogen of gastrointestinal infections especially in Asia. Similar manifestations have been observed with Cosa-and Saliviruses. Human rhinoviruses are grouped into three distinct species: rhinoviruses A, B, and C. This subdivision is based on differences in the amino acid sequences of capsid proteins. Nonetheless, many of the currently known virus types have still not been assigned to any of these species. The genera Cardiovirus, Sapelovirus, Teschovirus, Erbovirus, Cadicivirus, Aquamavirus, and Aphthovirus comprise primarily animal pathogenic picornaviruses that partly cause animal epidemic diseases and have considerable importance for animal breeding and food technology; e.g. FMD virus, which has been classified into the genus Aphthovirus. Seven different serotypes can be distinguished worldwide today. The name of this genus alludes to the blisters or cysts (aphthae) that arise in the mucosa of infected animals. The genera Avihepatovirus, Megrivirus and Tremovirus have been created for species that have been isolated from birds. Only one viral species has been assigned to the genus Senecavirus: Seneca valley virus was identified in the cultured cell line PER C6; its natural host has not yet been identified. The 5 0 UTR of this new virus displays some similarities to that of pestiviruses and hepaciviruses (Sect. 14.5).",

The capsids are composed of four viral proteins: VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. Occasionally, a fifth polypeptide is found in inconstant quantities; it is denominated VP0 and is the precursor of components VP2 and VP4, which arise by proteolytic cleavage during viral maturation. Especially in parechoviruses, VP0 is barely cleaved; therefore, their particles contain large quantities of the precursor protein. Inasmuch as the particle structure of several picornaviruses has been elucidated by X-ray diffraction analysis, the arrangement of the different viral structural proteins in the particles is well known. The virions are composed of 60 units of each of the four single proteins VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4, in which VP4 is localized inside the particle and in association with the RNA genome. The hepatovirus VP4 is very small (21-23 amino acid residues), and its presence in the virion has not been definitively resolved. VP1, VP2 and VP3 form the surface of the icosahedron (Fig. 14.1) .",

            "text": "The genome of picornaviruses contains a long single open reading frame that encodes a large precursor protein ( Fig. 14. 2). This experimentally not isolable protein is processed by proteolytic cleavage during its synthesis, thus leading to all the various viral components, i.e. structural and non-structural proteins as well as viral enzymes. A large untranslated sequence region (5 0 UTR) is located between Vpg at the 5 0 terminus of the genome and the start codon of the precursor protein; it has a length of 412 nucleotides in porcine teschovirus, 1,624 nucleotides in rhinoviruses and 1,199 nucleotides in FMD virus. The vast majority of the 5 0 -terminal non-coding nucleotides form intramolecular base pairings, resulting in a pronounced secondary structure (Fig. 14. 3). The first 88 nucleotides immediately adjacent to the 5 0 terminus form a secondary structure resembling a cloverleaf, which is involved in the initiation of genome replication for generating new positive-sense RNA molecules. The further downstream located sequence region possesses an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that facilitates binding of ribosomes independently of the 5 0 -cap structure that is usually present at the 5 0 end of eukaryotic mRNA molecules. Mutations in this region can strongly influence the translatability of the mRNA and virulence. Furthermore, a short untranslated sequence region is located between the stop Fig. 14.2 Genome structure of picornaviruses using the example of poliovirus 1. The viral genome possesses a covalently linked protein (Vpg) at the 5 0 terminus and is polyadenylated at its 3 0 end. Adjacent to the 5 0 -terminal Vpg there are RNA sequences that form a cloverleaf-like secondary structure, which is essential for genome replication. IRES indicates the internal ribosome entry site that is necessary for binding of ribosomes to the viral RNA genome. The single open reading frame encodes a large precursor polyprotein that is processed into the distinct viral components (structural proteins, non-structural proteins and enzymes) by the proteolytic activity of 2A, 3CD and 3C proteins. The regions representing the proteases are illustrated in red; red arrows indicate the cleavage sites of the respective proteases infection process. The arrangement of the proteins on the precursor polypeptide is identical in all picornaviruses ( Fig. 14. 2). The polyprotein is subdivided into three regions and the proteins, which arise by proteolytic cleavage, are designated with capital letters according to the respective regions of the polyprotein. The aminoterminal region contains the precursor sequences of the viral capsid proteins (1A-1D); the non-structural proteins 2A-2C, which play an important role in the adaptation of the virus to the cellular metabolism, are located in the middle of the polyprotein. Moreover, enzymatically active and further non-structural proteins (3A-3D) are generated from the carboxy-terminal regions. Usually, 11 viral proteins are generated from the precursor polyprotein. In aphthoviruses, erboviruses, kobuviruses, teschoviruses and cardioviruses, a short leader protein (L protein) is found at the amino terminus, which in mengovirus comprises 67 amino acids. In FMD virus, the L protein encompasses 205 amino acids and possesses proteolytic activity. In such cases the polyprotein does not begin with the sequences of the structural proteins, but begins with the L protein. In most picornaviruses, an amino acid sequence harbouring proteolytic activity (2A protease) is located immediately downstream of the region for the structural proteins. The 2A protease develops its proteolytic activity cotranslationally. In enteroviruses and rhinoviruses the amino acid chain between the end of the capsid proteins and the beginning of the 2A protease undergoes autocatalytic cleavage. The amino-terminal region of the precursor protein is excised from the nascent, not yet completely translated carboxyterminal moiety, generating the protomer, the precursor of structural proteins. In aphthoviruses, erboviruses and cardioviruses, the autocatalytic cleavage reaction exerted by the 2A protease occurs not upstream but immediately downstream of its own amino acid sequences, thus leading to a polypeptide product that contains both the protomer and the 2A protease. In hepatoviruses and parechoviruses, the 2A protein does not function as a protease during the early steps of the infection cycle; instead, it develops its proteolytic activity in a late phase during the formation of new capsids. In this case, the cleavage of the structural protein moiety is performed by the 3C protease at the transition site between domains 2A and 2B. The properties and functions of all proteins that arise by cleavage of the polyprotein are summarized in Table 14 .3.",

The numbers refer to the corresponding nucleotide positions starting from the 5 0 terminus of the genome. By interaction with various cellular proteins, the secondary structures stabilize a nucleotide sequence located directly upstream of the start codon used for translation of the polyprotein. This sequence can form a partial double-stranded region (indicated by stars) with sequences at the 3 0 end of the 18S ribosomal RNA (marked in red) within the small (49S) ribosomal subunit. The illustrated sequence ends with the start codon (AUG) of the polyprotein The protein succession order in the table corresponds to the real sequence order in the polyprotein NTP nucleoside triphosphate proteins VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1, respectively. Cellular enzymes modify the protomer by attachment of a myristic acid residue to an amino-terminal glycine. For this purpose, the previous autocatalytic removal of the L protein is necessary in aphthoviruses, erboviruses, kobuviruses, teschoviruses, and cardioviruses. In the other picornaviruses, the amino-terminal methionine is removed by cleavage. Myristoylation remains unaffected during the subsequent cleavage reactions and is detectable also in VP4. An exception is observed with hepatitis A virus as no amino-terminal fatty acid modification of the protomer has been found so far. The virus-encoded 3C protease is responsible for processing the capsid precursor protein into the single components VP0, VP3 and VP1. This enzyme is located in the carboxy-terminal region of the polyprotein and develops its activity relatively late. The protomer is already folded into the domains that correspond to the four capsid proteins before cleavage. Nevertheless, these proteins change their conformation once more by folding during processing, thus leading to the mature proteins that are found in infectious virus particles. The final cleavage of the VP0 moiety to form VP4 and VP2 occurs during viral maturation; the proteolytic activity required for this process resides in the carboxy-terminal domain of VP0 within the sequences of the VP2 domain. A serine residue at position 10 of VP2, which is conserved among picornaviruses and is located close to the VP4/VP2 cleavage site, seems to be involved in conferring the serine protease activity that executes the autocatalytic cleavage. However, an additional tight interaction between VP0 and the viral RNA genome in the immature virus particle is essential for the proteolytic activity. It is assumed that for successful proteolytic cleavage of VP0 a base (acting as a proton donor) of the genome must interact with the amino acid sequences. Therefore, this enzyme is activated within the genome-containing but still immature virus particles, but not until they have been released from infected cells. In hepatitis A virus, the proteolytic cleavage of structural proteins is performed by a different mechanism: in this case, a protomer is formed that also contains the 2A domain in addition to the capsid proteins. The protomer is cleaved by the 3C protease at the transition sites between the VP2/VP3 and the VP3/VP1 regions; however, it does not recognize the cleavage site between the VP1 and 2A domains. The resulting protein, VP1/2A (also known as pX), is cleaved by a not yet characterized cellular protease at a later step in the infection cycle during morphogenesis of new virus particles. VP1, VP2 and VP3 shape the faces of the icosahedral infectious virus particle. X-ray structure analyses of different picornaviruses revealed that these proteins exhibit very similar folding patterns among each other as well as among the proteins of different virus types. They consist of eight antiparallel b-sheet structures, which are connected by amino acid loops and are arranged in such a way that a wedge-shaped protein structure can be formed (Fig. 14.1b) . Since this protein structure has proven to be a universally valid folding pattern for capsid proteins of small RNA viruses with particles of icosahedral symmetry, it has been designated the RNA virus capsid (RVC) domain. The eight b-sheets form the lateral sides of the conserved, wedge-shaped protein structure. The joining protein loops exhibit considerable variability concerning length and sequence, however without influencing the basic wedge-shaped structure. The variable loop regions contain epitopes that are recognized by virus-neutralizing antibodies, which are generated during viral infection. In contrast, the amino-terminal regions of capsid proteins are situated on the inner side of the particles. They intertwine with each other forming an interconnected network which is responsible for the stability of the particles. The fact that VP1, VP2 and VP4 possess very similar structures suggests that the genes encoding these proteins have evolved from a common ancestral precursor by duplications.",

They found a ditch-like groove or crevice of approximately 25 \u00c5 in depth on the surface of rhinovirus B (type 14) particles which surrounds the vertices of the icosahedron and arises from the structures and interactions between different amino acid residues of VP1, VP2 and VP3. This structure, which Rossmann denominated \"canyon\", has been found in all picornaviruses, excepting in hepatitis A virus and FMD virus. The amino acids that line the walls of the canyon with their functional side groups facilitate binding of the respective virus particles to their specific cellular receptors (Fig. 14.1a, c) . Owing to their size, neutralizing antibodies are not able to penetrate into the canyon to impede binding of the virus to its specific cellular receptor. However, they can bind to epitopes on the upper surface of the particles located near the entrances to the canyons, thus indirectly impeding attachment of the virus by steric hindrance. Because of antibody binding, surface regions are exposed to a selection pressure that leads to a certain variability of the exposed amino acids, and to the development of differing capsid variants. On the other hand, the actual receptor binding site within the canyon does not underlie such a selection mechanism and remains unaffected, thus preserving the cell specificity of the corresponding virus type.",

Knowledge of the predominantly hydrophobic amino acids that line the cavity facilitated the development of therapeutically active and optimally adapted drugs such as pleconaril (see \u25b6 Chap. 9) that stabilize virus particles and inhibit the release of the RNA genome.

Best known is the indirect degradation of the protein p220: in this case, the 2A protease cleaves a cellular factor, which thereby becomes active as a protease. This enzyme induces the degradation of the cellular translation initiation factor eIF-4G (p220). This is a component of the cap-binding complex, also known as the eIF-4F complex, which comprises the cap-binding protein and translation initiation factor eIF-4A. The capbinding complex is generally involved in the initiation of translation of eukaryotic mRNAs, as it interacts with the cap structure at the 5 0 terminus of the mRNA and mediates binding of the ribosomes. Cleavage of the eIF-4G factor by the viral 2A protease leads to destruction of the functional activity of the complex in translating cellular mRNAs, resulting in a breakdown of cellular metabolism. This process has been denominated virus-host shutoff. In aphthoviruses, cleavage of the eIF-4G factor is mediated not by the 2A protease, but by the proteolytic activity of the L protein (206 amino acids), which resides at the amino terminus of the polyprotein. The L protein is also activated early during the infection cycle, and induces its own cleavage from the polyprotein, leading to the release of the protomer.

For this reason, it is essential for picornaviruses to possess the genetic information encoding their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This enzyme is located at the carboxy terminus of the polyprotein and is represented by the 3D region on the precursor molecule; the intermediate product 3CD pro , which is generated by proteolytic cleavage, possesses protease activity but no polymerase activity.

There are data indicating that mutated 2B proteins can interact with certain murine-cell-specific factors, thereby facilitating RNA replication in cells that are non-permissive for wild-type viruses. The 2B proteins of hepatitis A virus interfere with the antiviral responses mediated by retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG) I by inhibiting phosphorylation, and consequently activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), thus preventing transcription of the interferon-b (IFN-b) gene (see \u25b6 Chap. 8).

The remaining rhinoviruses (minor group) bind to the very low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor; however, for some viruses (human rhinoviruses 54 and 89) heparan sulphate seems to be sufficient for binding to the cell surface. In the case of hepatitis A virus, the proteins TIM-1 and TIM-3 have been identified as cellular interaction partners. The family of T-cell immunoglobulin-and mucine-domain-containing proteins (TIM proteins) represent a group of receptor proteins that also belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and are present in differing quantities on T H 1 and T H 2 cells and seem to regulate both the humoral and the cellular immune response.

This results in a conformational change in the canyon, which leads to a tighter binding to the D1 domain of ICAM-1. VP4, which is located on the inner surface of the virions and is tightly associated with the viral genome, is released from the capsids. Additionally, the sphingosine-like molecule, the pocket factor, is also displaced during this process. The viral genome is translocated into the cytoplasm through a cylindrical orifice which is formed at the contact sites between the vertices of the icosahedron and the cell membrane. Alternatively, there are data suggesting that viral entry can also occur via endocytosis. The vesicles that are formed during this process carry abundant quantities of clathrin, a cell membrane protein that accumulates in high concentrations at viral attachment sites. For the progression of the replication cycle, it is necessary that the viruses are released from the vesicles. An ATP-dependent proton pump located in the endocytic membrane is responsible for acidification of the interior of endocytic vesicles. This process leads to a rearrangement of the capsid in a way similar to that described above. In the next step, VP4 proteins and clathrin are released. As a result, small pores are formed at the junctions between VP1 proteins in the remodelled capsids and the vesicle membrane, through which the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm.",

The RNA does not possess the cap structure usually found at the 5 0 terminus of cellular mRNAs and which is necessary for the correct binding of ribosomes to the translation initiation site. Contrarily, the viral genome contains an, in comparison with cellular mRNA species, unusual long non-coding sequence (IRES) that is located upstream of the start codon and can comprise up to 1,199 nucleotides. It possesses a strongly pronounced, stable secondary structure with intramolecular double-stranded sequence regions ( Fig. 14. 3). The IRES facilitates recognition of the picornavirus genome as mRNA by the ribosomal subunits, facilitating their interaction with the start codon to initiate the first steps of the translation. It is assumed that the secondary structure exerts a stabilizing effect on a nucleotide sequence located immediately upstream from the start of the translation and which is complementary to the 18S ribosomal RNA of the small ribosomal subunit. Therefore, the ribosomal RNA can hybridize with the viral genome, guiding the ribosomes to the correct start site for protein synthesis. Cellular proteins are functionally involved in initiating translation. They also bind to the IRES region, influencing thereby the cell and host specificity of the different picornaviruses. One such protein is the La protein (p52), which usually binds to the 3 0 termini of transcripts, especially to tRNAs that are synthesized by RNA polymerase III, and regulates their termination. Interestingly, the La protein induces an autoimmune reaction in patients with lupus erythematosus and Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. Additional IRES-binding components include polypyrimidine tract binding protein, poly (rC)-binding protein 2, poly(A)-binding protein and the Unr factor (upstream of N-ras). In addition to these proteins, also the translation initiation factor eIF-2 and other not yet characterized proteins have been identified as interaction partner of the IRES.",

This enzyme operates autocatalytically, leading to cleavage of the protomer region at the amino terminus. The 3C and 3CD proteases are involved in processing the other viral components; owing to their carboxy-terminal location within the polyprotein, they are synthesized later. In hepatitis A virus and parechoviruses, the protomer remains linked with the 2A domain.

Mediated by the hydrophobic domain of the 3AB protein, the direct precursor of Vpg, primer synthesis occurs in association with intracellular membrane compartments and is catalysed by 3D pol . The template for the uridylylation reaction is a conserved sequence motif (AAACA), which is located in the loop of a hairpin structure within the cisresponsive element. This cis-responsive element is situated in different regions of the genome among the various members of the picornaviruses: in enteroviruses, it is located within the 2C-encoding region (poliovirus 1: nucleotides 4,444-4,505); in rhinovirus A, it resides within the coding sequences for the 2A domain; in parechoviruses and rhinovirus B (rhinovirus 14), it is situated within the VP1encoding sequences, whereas in rhinovirus C it is found within the sequences encoding VP2. In FMD virus, the cis-responsive element is located within the 5 0 UTR upstream of the IRES sequences, whereas in hepatitis A virus, it is situated within the 3C-encoding region. Mutations in the cis-responsive element lead to a replication failure, which results in an inhibition of negative-strand synthesis owing to the absence of uridylylation. The Vpg-pUpU primer associates with the poly(A) tail at the 3 0 terminus of the viral genome and forms the initiation structure with a free 3 0 -OH end as a recognition site for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D pol ), which synthesizes the complementary strand ( Fig. 14.4) . The initiation of negative-sense RNA synthesis is, however, also dependent on the presence of an intact cloverleaf secondary structure at the 5 0 terminus of positive strands. This suggests that the positive-sense RNA genomes form a circular structure, at which the negative-strand synthesis is initiated. The circularization is mediated by the interaction of the terminal-binding proteins poly(A)-binding protein and poly(rC)binding protein 2 as well as by the viral proteins 2C ATPase , 3CD pro and 3C pol , which bind to the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of the RNA genome. A transitory intermediate doublestranded RNA molecule is formed during the RNA polymerization. The 3 0 end of the newly synthesized negative strand contains two adenosine residues. These constitute a perfect structure for the complementary interaction with Vpg-pUpU primers, and initiate the synthesis of new positive-sense RNAs. The synthesis of a complete RNA molecule takes about 45 s. Besides 3D pol and Vpg-pUpU primers, a cellular protein (67 kDa) is essential for the correct course of this process. Between five and eight positive-sense RNA strands can be synthesized from a single intermediate negative-sense RNA molecule. Only 5-10 % of all viral RNA molecules are negative-sense RNA. New viral polyproteins are translated from the newly synthesized positive-sense RNA strands. In this way, the amount of viral components can rapidly multiply within infected cells. The entire process of polyprotein synthesis and genome replication occurs in the cytoplasm in association with intracellular membrane compartments. The polyproteins become embedded in ",

This is a second mechanism for inhibition of cellular protein synthesis. The poliovirus 2B and 3A proteins influence both the transport and the secretion of cellular glycoproteins. Furthermore, as described above, proteolytic degradation of TFIIIC by 3C pro inhibits RNA polymerase III dependent transcription. Finally, even mRNA synthesis is blocked.

In a first step, the myristoylated protomer, which is attached to membrane compartments, is cleaved by the activity of 3C pro to form VP0, VP1 and VP3. These proteins remain initially bound as a complex and associate with four additional VP0/VP1/VP3 aggregates to form pentamers, the precursor structures of the vertices of the icosahedron. In hepatitis A virus, the 2A protein domain does not possess proteolytic activity and remains linked to the protomer, forming the protein pX. In this case, the 2A domain facilitates the formation of pentamers and induces the process of morphogenesis. In a further step, 12 pentameric complexes assemble and form capsid precursors. These protein shells surround the RNA genome. However, is not completely understood how the RNA genome arrives at the interior of the capsids. Sequences of the IRES region are also important for this process: they enhance the encapsulation of the RNA genome. Furthermore, considerable rearrangements of the capsid protein structure are associated with this process, which is expressed in an altered sedimentation behaviour of the particles. It is conceivable that the RNA genome reaches the interior of the so-called procapsids through an orifice, or by preliminarily binding to the outside of the particle precursors with subsequent translocation into the interior by an ample refolding process. The last step in virion formation involves the activation of the protease within the VP2 domain of VP0, which is induced by interaction between VP0 and the viral RNA. Once activated, this protease performs the maturation cleavage that leads to the mature capsid proteins VP2 and VP4. In hepatitis A virus, a still unknown cellular protease catalyses the cleavage of pX to form VP1 and 2A in this late step. The final release of the virus is triggered by alteration of membrane permeability due to infection-induced cell death. The complete replication cycle, beginning from viral attachment to the release of progeny viruses, takes approximately 8 h in poliovirus.",

Nevertheless, also a cellular gene was found to contain an IRES within the 5 0 UTR of its mRNA: it encodes the binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP; immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein; an alternative designation is 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, GRP-78). This protein is a protein-folding enzyme (chaperone) which is active in the ER and in the Golgi apparatus. It is involved in the interaction between light and heavy chains of immunoglobulins that leads to functional antibodies. In eukaryotic protein translation, the cap-binding complex attaches to the cap region, a methylated guanosine nucleotide that is linked to the 5 0 terminus of the messenger RNA via a 5 0 -5 0 ester bond. The cap-binding complex is composed of the cap-binding protein, which interacts with the 5 0 terminus, factor eIF-3 and proteins eI-4A and eI-4B, which bind to the region located up to 100 nucleotides directly upstream of the start codon, maintaining it in a single-stranded extended configuration. The small ribosomal subunit along with tRNA Met , initiation factor eIF-2 and GTP interact with this 5 0 terminally associated complex to initiate protein translation.

The viruses are released directly into the bloodstream or the intestine through the lymphatic vessels. The virus infects activated monocytes expressing CD155 (the poliovirus receptor), and proliferates within them. The consequence is a mild viraemia, which elicits an initial fever attack (preliminary disease, abortive polio). Subsequently, the viruses spread throughout the organism and proliferate in the reticulohistiocytic system as well as in endothelial cells; this process is associated with a second viraemia, in which neurons can be infected, leading to a retrograde progression of the infection penetrating further into the spinal cord and brain. Especially, the large anterior horn cells and the motor neurons are infected, resulting in damage to and destruction of these cells. Poliomyelitis arises by infection of the cell-rich grey matter of the brain (polios is Greek for \"grey\"). Muscle cells and brain regions that were formerly innervated by the infected nerves are no longer innervated. The consequences are flaccid paralyses. If they are lasting, then the musculature atrophies because of inactivity. Subsequently, destroyed neurons are removed by macrophages (neuronophagy). The motor neurons remain atrophic: even years after the acute disease, generation of new glial cells (gliosis) as well as mild inflammations can be observed. Patients with paralysis symptoms of the intercostal musculature can survive the acute phase only with the aid of an iron lung. Extirpation of the tonsils, which is usually performed at the time of epidemic poliomyelitis, and irritations of the musculature (by movement, injections, etc.) frequently lead to respiratory paralysis; in such cases, the virus reaches the medulla oblongata along the damaged nerve fibres, destroying there the respective motor neurons.",

The viruses are excreted through the throat and the intestine for several weeks. The infections are characterized by a broad spectrum of different clinical manifestations. It is not possible to make unambiguous correlations between individual virus types and a particular clinical manifestation: different virus types can cause the same symptoms, whereas the same virus type can frequently be associated with many different symptoms. Patients are often simultaneously infected with several virus types; therefore, it is difficult to associate individual virus types with specific clinical pictures or symptoms. Human enteroviruses generally cause mild, coldlike illnesses, which can be associated with diarrhoea (\"summer flu\"); many infections are asymptomatic. Severe courses with neurological symptoms, meningitis, gastroenteritis, hand, foot and mouth disease, acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, myalgia, myocarditis, pleurodynia (Bornholm disease) or uveitis are only rarely observed. Patients with inherited or acquired immunological deficiencies frequently develop persistent infections, which can be associated with chronic enteritis, arthritis or meningoencephalitis. Meningitis is the predominant clinical picture in severe infections with human enteroviruses. In addition to herpesviruses, enteroviruses are considered the most frequent viral pathogens for meningitis and encephalitis. Coxsackie B viruses, particularly type B3, are believed to be the pathogen of viral myocarditis (perimyocarditis). Infantile myocarditis is frequently lethal in newborn babies. It occurs predominantly by infections acquired during delivery, when the mother has not produced antibodies against the coxsackievirus. Besides such acute forms, chronic disease types (dilatative cardiomyopathy) are also seen, especially in adults.",

The molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of the different symptoms are largely unknown. Besides hyperaemia, the following have been found in the conjunctiva of patients infected with enterovirus 70: dot-shaped bleedings (petechiae) and haemorrhages as well as infiltrations with mononuclear cells with diffuse distributed lymphocytes, which develop into striking large and swollen lymph follicles. In such cases, the cornea can be affected by epithelial opacity. Flaccid paralysis symptoms, which rarely occur during infections with enterovirus 70, are associated with degeneration of motor neurons, with haemorrhages and with neuroglial proliferation.

After in vitro infection with coxsackievirus B3, monocytes release the cytokines TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6. These are probably involved in the inflammation reaction. The chronic persistent myocarditis associated with coxsackievirus infections is characterized by significant lower quantities of infiltrating cells. Only single muscle cells disintegrate. Coxsackievirus RNA can be detected in heart muscle. Apparently, in this case the ratio between positive-sense and negativesense RNA molecules is shifted to 2:1, whereas usually a larger excess of genomic RNA molecules is present in infected cells. In such cases, only a few viral genomes are synthesized and also the number of infectious coxsackieviruses is clearly lower in chronically infected regions.

The proteins TIM-1 and TIM-3 have been identified as cellular receptors; an alternative entry pathway seems to exist for virus particles complexed with IgA molecules. These immunocomplexed viruses can bind to IgA receptors on the surface of hepatocytes. Replication of hepatitis A virus occurs in the liver 8-10 days before the onset of symptoms. The viruses spread to the intestine through the bile duct, and are excreted in the faeces. During this phase, viruses are also present in the blood, reaching concentrations of up to 10 5 virus particles per millilitre. The peak of virus release has already passed at the onset of the disease. Liver cells are destroyed by infection-induced mechanisms, viral proteins are found in the cytoplasm and even virus particles can be detected by electron microscopy. The very massive damage of liver cells leads to the release of bilirubin and transaminases into the blood. In contrast to other picornaviruses, in hepatitis A virus, functions responsible for the virus-host shutoff effect are not or are only weakly developed. Liver cells are not primarily destroyed by the viral infection. Instead, the cellular immune response is principally responsible for this process, as cytotoxic CD8 + T cells have been detected in the liver of patients with acute hepatitis A. These cells release interferon-g and give rise to the active immigration of other immunologically active cells into the liver. Infiltrating mononuclear cells are mostly located near the liver portal regions. Besides liver cells, also macrophages of the spleen and Kupffer's star cells (also known as stellate cells) contain viral proteins. They are derived from viruses. In a later infection stage, immigration of CD4 + lymphocytes can be observed. In rare cases, a hepatitis A virus infection can cause a transient granulocytopenia and damage of bone marrow cells.",

However, on 2 August 2007, new cases of FMD emerged in southern England, and further cases were also diagnosed in the surrounding cattle farms a little later.

Most probably, a laboratory virus escaped through old and leaky sewage systems into the environment. Owing to the rapid action of the relevant authorities, the setting up of security zones and the culling of all infected livestock, the virus was contained rapidly.",

            "text": "14.1.6.1 FMD Virus Epidemiology and Transmission FMD virus is one of the most important and economically most relevant animal pathogenic viruses. Although it has not played an important role in Europe for a few decades, and the countries of the European Union are considered to be FMD-free owing to systematic disease control, the FMD epidemic in the UK in 2001 has shown that infiltration of the virus is still possible at any time, and that it can induce great epidemics. Although vaccinations against FMD are no longer performed in the countries of the European Union, a reserve vaccine stock is still retained for control of potential epidemics with ring and emergency vaccinations. The measures required to prevent viral infiltration as well as production, checking and storage of the serotype-specific vaccines require huge financial expense. In Europe, FMD is a notifiable disease; veterinarians and animal owners are obliged to notify the relevant veterinary authority about every suspicion of disease. After notification, the official order to kill single animals follows, if necessary, for diagnostic purposes. If FMD is officially ascertained in the animals, killing of all cloven-hoofed animals of the livestock is ordered, and extensive epidemiological examinations are initiated to control possible dissemination of the virus. These measures concern not only FMD, but also diseases induced by viruses that cause FMD-like symptoms and which can be therefore clarified by differential diagnostics. These viruses include swine vesicular disease virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (\u25b6 Sect. 15.1) and the now eradicated vesicular exanthema of swine virus (Sect. 14.6). FMD virus is widespread worldwide and is endemic in vast regions of Africa, South America and Asia, and also in the Asiatic part of Turkey (Anatolia) as serotypes O, A and Asia 1. From such regions, the virus is occasionally imported into the European part of Turkey and rarely also into other European countries, such as Bulgaria and the Balkan countries in 1996 (serotype O) and Greece in 1996 and 2000 (serotype Asia1).",

The European Commission can, in principle, allow protective vaccinations against FMD (ring vaccination) to protect not yet infected livestock, or suppressive vaccinations to reduce dissemination of the virus in already infected animal stocks or regions; in the latter case, the animals are killed later. The main problem that arises as a consequence of vaccination is the identification and distinction of vaccinated from infected animals. The development of ELISA systems that can detect antibodies against non-structural proteins, which are produced during an infection but not by vaccination, has significantly improved the acceptance of vaccination measures. The principle of distinction is as follows. During FMD virus replication, viral structural and non-structural proteins are synthesized in an animal, and are immunologically recognized; consequently, infected animals produce antibodies against both protein groups. Since vaccines are based on purified, inactivated virus particles, they solely consist of structural proteins and do not contain nonstructural proteins. Therefore, vaccinated animals have only antibodies against structural proteins. Commercial ELISA systems which contain antigens of nonstructural proteins 3A, 3B and 3C (also known as \"3ABC ELISA\") and which can detect the presence of antibodies against such proteins have proven to be sensitive and reliable enough to distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals.",

Also, the processes that lead to penetration of virus particles and to the release of the viral genome are not well understood. The infection provokes, by still unknown mechanisms, the activation of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated signal pathway. This mitogen-activated signalling pathway is induced by extracellular stress signals and results in phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Thereby activated, ERK1/2 reach the cell nucleus and induce the expression of various cellular genes involved in regulating cell division and differentiation. The finding that activation of ERK-mediated signalling is important for viral replication provides evidence that astrovirus replication depends on dividing cells. The initial step of the reproduction cycle is the translation of non-structural precursor proteins NSP1a and NSP1ab. How protein synthesis is initiated is unclear. No covalently linked protein has been found at the 5 0 terminus, as observed in picornaviruses and caliciviruses; the UTR does not seem to form an IRES (see Sects. 14.1 and 14.3). Whether the 5 0 end is capped is also not clear. In some translation events, a shift of the reading frame occurs in the carboxy-terminal region of NSP1a, resulting in an in-frame fusion of NSP1a and NSP1b. This process resembles the synthesis of the non-structural proteins of togaviruses (Sect. 14.6). After synthesis, the NSP1a and NSP1ab precursors are both autocatalytically cleaved by 3CL pro , whereby the functions of the diverse non-structural proteins, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, become available. The synthesis of complementary negative-sense RNA molecules is achieved by the activity of RNA polymerase. The negative RNA strands serve as templates for the synthesis of (1) new genomic mRNA molecules and (2) subgenomic mRNA species of about 2,000 nucleotides. The latter contain the ORF2 coding sequences and serve for translation of precursor protein pVP87 ( Fig. 14.6 ). Apoptosis is induced in infected cells during viral replication, resulting in cell death and release of progeny viruses. However, it is unknown which of the viral proteins are responsible for this process. Caspase activities that are induced during apoptosis cleave capsid proteins VP26 and VP29, thus increasing the infectivity of released progeny viruses.",

Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus is most prominent among the genus Lagovirus because it was used to combat the rabbit plague in Australia some decades ago. Human pathogenic viruses that cause diarrhoea are classified into the genera Norovirus and Sapovirus. Their members are characterized by considerable sequence differences in their genomes, and are subdivided into five groups (GI-GV), which in turn contain a large number of different genotypes. They have denominations that commonly are derived from the place where they were isolated. Norovirus types GI, GII and GIV are human pathogenic viruses, whereas genogroups GIII and GV infect cattle and mice. Sapoviruses infect predominantly humans; only members of genogroup III have been isolated from swine. Until now, only one species, Newbury-1 virus, has been assigned to the genus Nebovirus: it infects cattle and causes diarrhoea in calves. Recently, new members of caliciviruses have also been isolated from pigs in Canada. These St-Val\u00e9rien viruses cannot be assigned to any genera today; therefore, the new genus Valovirus has been proposed.

The organization of the open reading frames differs among the different genera: in noroviruses and vesiviruses there are three open reading frames. ORF1 is separated from ORF2 and is responsible for the synthesis of the precursor for the non-structural proteins. It is autocatalytically cleaved by the serine protease 3CL pro into Vpg, an NTPase (helicase), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and two additional nonstructural proteins (p48 and p22 in noroviruses).

Vpg interacts with the cellular translation initiation factor eIF-3, a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit; binding of Vpg to eIF-3 mediates attachment of the small ribosomal subunit to the 5 0 end of the viral genome.

For example, the common feature of all groups of the ABO system is the presence of N-acetylglucosamine as the central sugar molecule of carbohydrate structures on cell surfaces. They are linked to galactose molecules that carry fucose residues. Together they compose the basic structure of all blood groups representing blood group 0. If one or two additional N-galactosamine molecules are linked to the galactose, these carbohydrate structures represent blood groups A and B, respectively. The biosynthesis of blood group antigens depends on a number of enzymes that are subject to genetic variation. If viruses use carbohydrate structures of blood group systems as receptors, the susceptibility of the respective infection is genetically determined. Therefore, people with genetic defects in the enzyme a(1,2)-fucosyltransferase are not able to synthesize the carbohydrate structures that are necessary for binding of noroviruses and sapoviruses to the cell surfaces. Hence, these \"non-secretor\" phenotypes cannot be infected by certain types of noroviruses and sapoviruses: they are resistant. Inasmuch as noroviruses frequently mutate, and as a result also change their receptor preferences, it must be assumed that such resistance does not apply for all virus types. Similar genetically determined resistances are also known from parvovirus B19 infections: this virus binds to blood group antigen P, a glycosphingolipid. People who do not possess the genetic information for the enzymes which are necessary for the synthesis of the corresponding carbohydrate structures cannot be infected by these types of parvoviruses (see \u25b6 Sect. 20.1)",

It is necessary for modification of genomic and subgenomic mRNAs with a cap structure. The other non-structural proteins are a protease, which cleaves the precursor protein into the individual functional components, an NTPase/helicase and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Table 14 .10). The protease resembles cysteine proteases of the papain type. Whether this protease is responsible for all cleavage reactions and at which sites has not been finally elucidated. In hepatitis E viruses, the sequences encoding the capsid protein are located in a separate reading frame (ORF2) that exhibits the highest degree of conservation. The capsid protein generally has a length of 660 amino acids (about 72-76 kDa) and forms homodimers. It is characterized by a signal-peptide-like sequence followed by a signalase cleavage site at the amino terminus. Glycosylated and unglycosylated forms may be found in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Probably the capsid protein is synthesized in association with the ER membrane and translocated into the ER lumen, whereby the signal peptide is excised and the amino acid chain is modified with sugar groups. Subsequently, retransport of the capsid proteins into the cytoplasm seems to occur. ORF3 encodes a small phosphoprotein, pORF3. Its function has not been conclusively resolved. Nevertheless, twohybrid analyses have shown that it interacts with the capsid proteins; phosphorylation of the serine residue at position 80 of pORF3 is necessary for interaction. Moreover, binding to bikunin, a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor of serine proteases, and binding to haemopexin, a glycoprotein present in blood plasma that belongs to the acute phase proteins (see \u25b6 Chap. transport into the compartments of late endosomes, e.g. the transport of the epidermal growth factor receptor.

The non-structural protein precursor is probably autocatalytically cleaved by the protease in analogy with other positive-sense RNA viruses. As a result, the functional activities of the following proteins become available in addition to the viral protease: RNAdependent RNA polymerase, helicase and methyltransferase/guanylyltransferase. They are involved in the production of negative-sense RNA molecules, which are synthesized using the viral genome as a template. This process occurs in association with the ER membrane. The negative-sense RNA molecules are used as a template for the synthesis of new viral genomes. In addition, two subgenomic mRNAs with lengths of 2.0 and 3.7 kb are transcribed from negative-sense RNAs. The bicistronic subgenomic 2.9-kb RNA spans the region of the 3 0 -oriented ORF2 and ORF3. This mRNA is used for translating the capsid proteins and pORF3 (Fig. 14.10) . Whether the 3.7-kb subgenomic RNA has a similar function is uncertain. The capsid proteins interact to form precursor virus particles in which the viral RNA is embedded. New viruses are released from the surface of infected cells. The seroprevalence is about 40 % in India, it ranges from 4 % in southern and eastern coastal states of the USA to 30 % in the Midwest, it is approximately 4 % in Germany and it is around 16 % in southwestern France. The various genotypes are distributed in different geographical regions. Genotype 1 viruses are found in Asia and North Africa. Genotype 2 has been found in hepatitis E epidemics from Central America and Central Africa. Genotype 3 is prevalent in various European countries, in North America, South America and Japan. Genotype 4 viruses have especially been detected in China, Taiwan, Japan and Vietnam. Whereas genotypes 1 and 2 of hepatitis E virus have only been found in humans so far, genotypes 3 and 4 can infect both humans and swine; therefore, their regional distribution is coincident. Hepatitis E virus genotype 3 has been detected in 5 % of all blood samples from wild boars. In the Netherlands, hepatitis E viruses of genotype 3 have also been found in commercially available swine liver. Inoculation of swine with such viruses led to acute infections, strongly suggesting that those liver samples contained infectious hepatitis E viruses. Efficient in vitro cultivation of hepatitis E viruses is not possible today. The virus particles do not display the high particle stability of hepatitis A viruses (Sect. 14.1). Besides the usually observed faecal-oral transmission (via contaminated water) and the suspected zoonotic transmission, hepatitis E viruses are also transmitted directly from person to person by droplet and smear infections.",

The virus is widespread, but contrary to initial speculations, human pegivirus infections do not cause hepatitis. Since the amino acid sequence of its precursor polyprotein exhibits only about 28 % and 20 % homology to the sequences of hepatitis C virus and yellow fever virus, respectively, it has been classified in a separate, new genus in the family Flaviviridae.

Even after the characterization of hepatitis C virus and hepatitis E virus (the latter was characterized and classified into the family Hepeviridae in 1988; see Sect. 14.4), some other, hypothetical viruses are still assigned to this group. For example, there is only indirect evidence for the existence of hepatitis F virus.

Besides the direct interaction of the viral envelope proteins with defined cell surface components, a second way of binding and penetration has been described for dengue virus: it depends on the presence of subneutralizing concentrations of virus-typespecific antibodies or cross-reacting immunoglobulins, which can recognize various types of related viruses. The latter is valid for dengue virus, which comprises four different serotypes. The virus-type-specific antibodies can only bind to epitopes that are specific for the respective serotype. However, there are additional domains especially in the E protein of dengue virus which are commonly shared by all serotypes. These virus-type-overlapping and cross-reacting antibodies are usually not neutralizing. If viruses are mixed in vitro with such cross-reacting antibodies or with low concentrations of type-specific antibodies that can bind to the particle surface, entry of the virus and viral infection can be induced via the Fc portion of immunoglobulins by mediating the interaction with Fc receptors on monocytes and macrophages (Fig. 14.14) . This phenomenon is known as immune enhancement. Fig. 14. 14 Mode of operation of infection-enhancing antibodies. After an infection with a particular subtype of dengue virus, e.g. dengue virus type 1, subtype-specific antibodies are developed in the organism. In the case of reinfections with the same virus subtype, they can bind to the virus particles, neutralizing the virus. However, if a subsequent infection with another dengue virus subtype occurs, e.g. dengue virus type 2, the antibodies will also bind to the surface of dengue virus type 2 capsids since the amino acid sequences of both virus types are similar. Type 1-specific antibodies are not able to neutralize dengue virus type 2, however. Via the Fc region of immunoglobulins, virus-antibody complexes bind to Fc receptors present in the membrane of macrophages. This results in internalization of the complex, leading to infection of macrophages After attachment to the cell surface, the virus enters the cell by endocytosis (Fig. 14.15 ). Afterwards, it is present within the endosome in the cytoplasm and must be released from this membrane vesicle. For this purpose, the interior of the endosomes is acidified via an ATP-dependent proton pump, which is a component of the vesicular membrane. The endosomal membrane fuses with the viral envelope. The E and E1 proteins of flaviviruses and hepaciviruses/pestiviruses, Endosomal acidification induces the fusion of the endosomal membrane with the viral envelope, whereby the capsid is released into the cytoplasm. The viral genome is used as mRNA and is translated into a polyprotein. The polyprotein is embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by signal-peptide-like protein domains. All subsequent steps of the infection cycle occur in close proximity to this cell compartment. The signalase, which is associated with the ER, cleaves the precursor protein in the region of structural proteins C, PrM and E. All other cleavage reactions in the region of non-structural proteins are performed by the NS3 protein, which together with the NS2B protein acts as a protease. These processing reactions give rise to the NS5 protein, which carries the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and transcribes the positive-sense genome into negative-sense RNA molecules. In turn, these serve as templates for the synthesis of new viral genomes. Newly synthesized viral genomes accumulate in regions of the ER membrane that contain high concentrations of viral structural proteins. This leads to budding of virus particles into the ER lumen. In the further course, these are transported via Golgi vesicles to the cell surface and released respectively, are actively involved in this membrane fusion process. During this process, the dimeric E proteins change their structure and form trimeric intermediates, in which the fusogenic domain is exposed, developing its activity. In this way, the viral capsid enters the cytoplasm; the mechanism that leads to the release of the viral nucleic acid is poorly understood.",

In the case of hepatitis C virus and pestiviruses, the IRES sequence, which is located in the UTR at the 5 0 terminus, is responsible for binding of ribosomes. If the C protein is present at the amino-terminal region of the polyprotein after initiation of translation, the elongation of the amino acid chain stops temporarily: the hydrophobic domain in the carboxy-terminal region of the C protein acts as a signal peptide. It interacts with the signal recognition particle, a complex of cellular polypeptides and the 5S RNA, which induces the transport of the translation complex to the ER membrane. There, the nascent amino acid chain is translocated through the ER membrane, whereby the transmembrane domains of PrM and E proteins cotranslationally anchor the polyprotein in the lipid layer ( Fig. 14.15 ). Signalases perform the processing reactions between the C, PrM, E and NS1 moieties. Further cleavage reactions of the polyprotein are performed by NS2B/NS3 (flaviviruses) and NS3/NS4A (hepatitis C and pestiviruses) proteases (Fig. 14.12) . Most of the nonstructural proteins have hydrophobic domains that contribute to their anchorage in the ER membrane.

The membrane invaginates into the ER lumen, thus forming the initial budding complex, which is finally released. In this phase of viral morphogenesis, the virus particles are not yet infectious: E proteins of flaviviruses are present as a heterodimer complex with PrM polypeptides. During the following transport through the Golgi apparatus, the envelope proteins are glycosylated and PrM is processed into the M protein by the protease furin. As a consequence, the complex between E and PrM proteins is resolved and the E proteins form homodimers. Thereby the immature, non-infectious virus particles become mature virus particles. Finally, the Golgi vesicles fuse with the cytoplasmic membrane, releasing the infectious virus particles into the surrounding environment.

Female insects can vertically transmit the virus to their offspring. Monkeys, as intermediate hosts, also maintain the infection chain of jungle or savannah yellow fever.

However, the slave trade between Africa and North America and South America by the Spanish and English conquerors led to the introduction of the mosquito/virus combination during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and thereby to the epidemic dissemination of yellow fever in the tropical regions of America. Yellow fever appeared primarily in coastal cities of Africa, America and southern Europe, and it was one of the major diseases of mankind, claiming thousands of victims. There were more than 100,000 deaths from yellow fever infections during the construction of the Panama Canal. It could only be completed after the mosquitoes had been exterminated as carriers of the infection. As early as 1881, the Cuban physician Carlos Finlay presumed that the disease is transmitted by insects. This assumption was finally proved by Walter Reed in 1900. In 1902, yellow fever virus was identified as the aetiologic agent of the epidemic yellow fever; in 1929, it was transferred to monkeys, thus paving the way for further research.",

In Asian countries, the disease has not emerged so far. It is assumed that Asian Aedes species are less susceptible to the virus, and thus constitute bad carrier vectors. On the other hand, it seems conceivable that cross-immunities with dengue viruses, which are widespread in Asian countries, might prevent the occurrence of apparent yellow fever infections. It also seems possible that people in Africa may have developed a wide cross-reactive immunity owing to numerous viral infections by insects. These conditions may have prevented major epidemics of yellow fever in the population; therefore, only non-immune Europeans were affected. However, because of the advancing urbanization in recent decades, the living conditions in Africa have changed greatly, so yellow fever is now frequently observed. In recent years, epidemic outbreaks of yellow fever with more than 100,000 cases have been reported in Nigeria. The annual number of officially reported infections is approximately 2,000 in South America. Presumably, the number of unreported cases may be very high.",

In 1951, Theiler was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the first development of a live vaccine. The molecular basis of attenuation is unknown. In comparison with the wild-type genome, strain 17D has a total of 68 nucleotide mutations, which lead to 32 amino acid changes in viral proteins. Most mutations are located in the gene encoding the E protein, so it is suspected that the vaccine virus may bind less efficiently to the receptors on liver cells. As a consequence, less virus is produced, which results in slower infection rates, and hence in a mild or attenuated form of infection. Low virus concentrations are found in the blood of vaccinated individuals about 3-5 days after inoculation; viraemia lasts for 1-2 days. The first immune response is detectable in 95 % of vaccinated individuals 10 days after vaccination. To maintain protection, booster vaccinations are needed in 10-year intervals. Back mutations to the wild type have never been observed; thus, the yellow fever vaccine is regarded as very successful and safe worldwide. Millions of people have been vaccinated to date. Hence, significant control and reduction of yellow fever infections has been achieved in tropical countries; large-scale epidemics are reported only very rarely today.

Further outbreaks were subsequently observed periodically in almost all tropical and subtropical regions. In 1903, Harris Graham, working as a physician in Beirut, isolated a filterable pathogen from the blood of patients. Thomas L. Bancroft, an Australian physician and botanist, demonstrated its transferability by Aedes aegypti in 1906. In 1944, Albert Sabin and R. Walter Schlesinger identified dengue viruses as pathogens by transferring blood of infected soldiers into mice. Four different serotypes of dengue virus are known. Similarly to yellow fever, there are urban and rural forms of dengue fever. The latter is spread by A. albopictus and A. scutellaris; their natural hosts are considered to be non-human primates in tropical forests of Southeast Asia and South America. A. aegypti is especially involved in propagation and transmission of the infection in urban centres. Not all strains of A. aegypti mosquitoes are able to transmit dengue viruses. Genetic variants of the mosquitoes which do not produce receptor protein R67/R64 (molecular mass 67 kDa) in their intestinal epithelial cells are responsible for this. These mosquito strains (e.g. IBO-11) are not permissive for dengue virus infections; therefore, they cannot transmit the pathogens.",

In the literature, they are also known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis virus and central European encephalitis virus. Related virus types also exist in India (Kyasanur forest disease virus). TBEV is the only member of the group of central European encephalitis viruses which is widespread in central Europe. Louping Ill virus, which infects sheep in Great Britain and can cause encephalomyelitis, is closely related to TBEV; human disorders caused by louping Ill virus have been described only in individual cases. TBEV is endemic especially in Austria (K\u20ac arnten) and southern Germany (Danube region, Black Forest), in Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Russia. In endemic regions in central Europe the prevalence of TBEV in ticks is between 0.2 % and 0.5 %. TBEV is transmitted by tick bites, especially by Ixodes ricinus, the common wood tick, which is found in forests and alluvial areas. Infected ticks transmit the virus directly during sucking because TBEV accumulates in the salivary glands. Usually, people come into contact with ticks from grass and bushes when walking through infested areas. It is a mere delusion that ticks jump down from trees onto their victims. TBEV can be transmitted to humans and rodents during the period when ticks are active, particularly in the months from April to September/October. Within the tick population, TBEV can be transmitted transovarially to offspring. A rare infection route for humans is the transmission of TBEV by fresh milk and non-pasteurized raw milk products, especially from sheep and goats. These animals can be infected by ticks, and excrete the virus in the milk. However, the reservoirs of TBEV are small rodents. Infection of humans is a deadend road because it interrupts the spread of TBEV.",

The mutations arise during replication with a probability of 2 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 . They are attributed to the fact that the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, unlike cellular DNA polymerases, does not possess an exonucleolytic proofreading mechanism to control and enhance the accuracy of RNA synthesis. The classification of genotypes and subtypes of hepatitis C virus was originally based on the sequence of the NS5 gene. However, variations are found in all regions of the genome. Only the 5 0 -terminal UTR containing the IRES element is highly conserved. Mutations within viral genes are not uniformly distributed. There are variable and hypervariable as well as relatively conserved sequences. Hypervariable regions are located in the aminoterminal region of the E2 protein between amino acids 1-27 and 90-97. They are recognized by antibodies, and thus are exposed to a strong immune selection pressure. The virus changes both epitopes during a chronic infection, with the result that the antibodies are no longer able to recognize them. In a similar way, mutations also alter the epitopes which are recognized by cytotoxic T cells. Presumably, this immunological selection pressure promotes the development of viral variants, which can cause a chronic infection. In addition, it has been found that the non-structural proteins of flaviviruses possess several activities that allow the pathogens -including hepatitis C virus -to avoid the defence strategies of the non-specific immune response (Sect. 14.5.3). In the case of hepatitis C virus, the NS3/4A protease cleaves the cellular factors Cardif (CARD-adapter-inducing IFN-b) and TRIF (Toll/IL-1-receptor-domain-containing adapter), which activate the interferon regulatory factor and initiate the synthesis of IFN-a and IFN-b. In vitro, the NS5A protein inhibits protein kinase R, which is activated by IFN-a and inhibits translation. However, whether this mechanism also occurs in vivo to counteract the effect of interferon has not been demonstrated; the same also applies to the other examples mentioned. It is also not known whether specific mutations are important for the virulence of the different quasispecies.

Because of the infiltration of immunologically active cells and their secretion of cytokines, liver cells are destroyed. This cell-damaging process can be intensified by certain cofactors, such as alcohol consumption.

In 1995, the genome of this virus was sequenced by Scott Muerhoff and coworkers; it was classified into the family Flaviviridae owing to the arrangement of its genes. Since an IRES sequence was identified at the 5 0 end of the RNA genome, and genes are present coding for two glycoproteins (E1 and E2), it is related to hepatitis C virus. Subsequently, infections with this pathogen, which had been designated hepatitis G virus and is named human pegivirus today, were identified in many people who responded to the infection with the formation of specific antibodies. Meanwhile, different subtypes of this virus have been identified. The initial presumption that hepatitis G viruses cause liver inflammation in humans has not been verified. Occasionally, these viruses were also isolated from patients with hepatitis because of the high prevalence rates -up to 4 % of blood donors are viraemic. Both the acute and the persistent infection are apparently asymptomatic.

This attracted much attention at that time, especially because the virus was considered as a classic pathogen of the Old World and it was entirely unknown on the American continent and in the urban area of New York. West Nile virus usually infects birds (songbirds, crows), which constitute the reservoir for the pathogen. They can transport the virus over long distances. The virus can be transmitted to horses and humans by mosquitoes of the genus Culex. The virus spread in just 1 year throughout the eastern USA. Diseases and deaths due to West Nile virus infections were reported especially in the eastern USA in the years after 1999. In 2002, the pathogen had spread into more than 39 states and 4,156 infections were documented in humans, 248 of whom died. The deaths occurred primarily in people of advanced age (the average age of the people who died was 79 years). Furthermore, during this period more than 3,400 confirmed infection cases were recorded in horses, which develop a clinical picture similar to that in humans. The infection wave reached its climax in 2003, when West Nile virus infections were diagnosed in almost 10,000 patients in all states of the USA. Since then, dead birds are extensively examined to determine whether they are infected with West Nile virus, especially the highly susceptible crows. In subsequent years, the number of infections decreased to 3,000-4,000 per year.

Sindbis virus is related to western equine encephalitis virus, which is common on the American continent (Sect. 14.6.6). Both species of virus can be easily reproduced in cell cultures and show a pronounced cytopathic effect. Sindbis virus is widespread in Africa, eastern Europe and Asia. It is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Culex, and only in rare cases causes a febrile illness with rash and joint pain, which is similar in terms of clinical features and pathogenesis to a disease caused by some flaviviruses in terms of the clinical picture and pathogenesis. Neurotropic isolates have previously been described only in individual cases. Semliki Forest virus is endemic in Africa, India and Southeast Asia. It is transmitted by Aedes spp. and is largely non-pathogenic in humans. Therefore, it is now frequently used as a genetic engineering vector for heterologous gene expression in eukaryotic cell cultures. There are about 80 trimers per virion. They form spike-like protrusions of 6-8 nm in length on the surface of the virus (Fig. 14.17) . The trimers mediate attachment to cellular receptors and are binding targets of virus-neutralizing antibodies. In rubella virus, there are also E1 homodimers on the particles. The capsid is composed of 240 dimers of the C protein. It contains the RNA genome, and is associated with amino acids on the inner side of the capsid.",

In Sindbis virus, laminin and the laminin receptor precursor have been identified as receptors on the surface of chicken fibroblasts, but other cellular proteins also bind the virions; in the case of rubella virus, specific phospholipids on the cell surface seem to be involved in binding the virus. The virus particles penetrate into the cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The interior of endocytotic vesicles (endosomes) is acidified in an energy-dependent process through the import of H + ions. This generates conformational changes of the viral envelope proteins which lead to the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane, resulting in the release of the capsid. How the tight interaction of C proteins with the RNA genome is abolished is not known. However, the polarity of the positive-sense RNA allows binding of the cellular cap-binding complex via the cap structure at the 5 0 terminus and the association with ribosomal subunits, which initiate translation of the sequences encoding the non-structural polyprotein. This polypeptide is synthesized on ribosomes in the cytoplasm, it associates with the ER membrane by hydrophobic amino acid sequences and the palmitoylation in the NSP1 moiety, and is cleaved by the cysteine protease present in NSP2 (alphaviruses) or p150 (rubella virus) into the individual components. As soon as the activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is present in the form of functionally active NSP4 protein, the negative-sense RNA is synthesized. In Sindbis virus, the NSP4 protein forms a complex with the uncleaved NSP polyprotein (Fig. 14.18a ). The initiation occurs at the 3 0 end in a highly conserved nucleotide sequence, which is located directly upstream of the poly(A) tail. In addition, nucleotides from the untranslated sequences at the 5 0 terminus seem to be involved. These are partially complementary to sequences at the 3 0 end and can form a partial double-stranded RNA, thus leading to circularization of the genome. Cellular proteins influence the initiation of RNA synthesis at the 3 0 end: phosphorylated forms of the cellular protein calreticulin bind to the 3 0 end of the rubella virus genome. The details of initiation of RNA synthesis are unknown; however, it is clear that in the further course of the replication process an RNA product which is complementary to the whole genome is generated.

During an epidemic in Australia in 1940, the ophthalmologist Sir Norman Gregg discovered that the mothers of children with congenital cataracts, hearing loss and heart malformations (Gregg syndrome) had experienced a rubella infection during pregnancy (Table 14 .15). Therefore, the virus causes not only the harmless rubella, but also severe embryopathies. The virus was cultivated for the first time in 1962. It generates a cytopathic effect in kidney cell lines of rabbits (RK-13) or monkeys (Vero cells). After a major epidemic in the USA in 1964, an attenuated live vaccine was developed in 1967. Its application led to the result that rubella occurs only very rarely today; since 2001, it has been considered as eradicated in the USA. Acute rubella infections are also rare in Europe owing to vaccination; there are estimated to be 150-400 cases per year in Germany, for example.",

If the level is below 10 IU/mL, and there is also no clear reactivity in alternative tests, rubella-virus-specific IgG should be administered within 3 days after exposure because a fresh infection is possible.

A further complication is that IgM reactivity in the ELISA may be unspecific during gestation. If rubella-virus-specific IgM antibodies are present in the umbilical cord blood and viral RNA is detected by PCR, this is an indication for termination of pregnancy because of the high risk of possible harm to the unborn child by the infection.

The virus is transmitted to a number of different Aedes mosquito species, which further spread it to and also between humans. The tiger mosquito (A. albopictus) is considered to be particularly responsible for the chikungunya virus infections that have been observed in Europe in the last few years, as these mosquitoes can also exist in subtropical and cooler regions. Presumably the virus was originally introduced to European countries by tourists or mosquitoes, resulting in local outbreaks.

This phenomenon is based on the fact that the viral infection induces apoptosis in immature neurons, whereas mature neurons can prevent this process by an unknown factor.

Therefore, they are shorter and comprise between 12,704 nucleotides in equine arteritis virus and approximately 15,000 and 15,700 nucleotides in PRRSV and simian haemorrhagic fever virus, respectively. They consist of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA containing a methylated cap structure at the 5 0 terminus and a poly(A) tail the 3 0 end. The coding regions of the genome are flanked by 156-221 and 59-117 untranslated nucleotides at the 5 0 and 3 0 termini, respectively. Two large reading frames (1a and 1b), of which 1a begins at the 5 0 terminus, have overlapping ends and cover approximately two thirds of the genome (Fig. 14.21) . They contain the genetic information for the synthesis of two polyproteins (1a and 1ab), from which the non-structural proteins are generated by proteolytic cleavage. A ribosomal frameshift event during translation leads to skipping the stop codon at the end of reading frame 1a, resulting in the synthesis of the larger protein 1ab. Autocatalytic cleavage leads to the generation of three proteases (NSP1, NSP2, NSP4), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a helicase and several other non-structural proteins of unknown function. Reading frames 2-7 (or 9 in PRRSV) encoding the structural proteins are located downstream of the genes of non-structural proteins. Towards the 3 0 end, they encode the different glycoproteins and the M and N proteins; the E protein is encoded by an internal reading frame located on the second longest mRNA. Fig. 14. 20 Structure of an arterivirus particle represented by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. Inside the particle, the RNA genome is associated with N proteins in a helical nucleocapsid, which is enclosed by a membrane envelope, in which four viral glycoproteins (GP 2 -GP 5 ) and the non-glycosylated M protein are embedded among the different members of arteriviruses, the amino-terminal half of protein 1ab (345-421 kDa) is identical to that of protein 1a. The three proteases (NSP1, NSP2, NSP4) that reside in the amino-terminal region of both proteins cleave the precursor proteins into a total of 12 non-structural proteins (NSP1-NSP12), whose functions are in some cases not resolved.",

NSP4 is a serine protease and is similar to the 3C protease of picornaviruses (Sect. 14.1). Its activity is required for subsequent processing of the precursor proteins 1a and 1ab at up to eight cleavage sites. This proteolytic processing generates, among others, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, metal ion binding protein MP and a helicase (NSP10). The latter has a Zn 2+ ion binding domain, which is needed for the synthesis of viral mRNAs, but is not necessary for genome replication. NSP11 constitutes the endoribonuclease The viral RNA genome functions as mRNA, and is translated in the cytoplasm. The two overlapping reading frames encode nonstructural polyproteins 1a and 1ab. A hairpin structure induces a ribosomal frameshift during translation that leads in approximately 15-20 % of all translation processes to the synthesis of non-structural polyprotein 1ab, which contains the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain in its carboxy-terminal region. Both polyproteins are cleaved by the autocatalytic activity of two cysteine proteases and a serine protease that are located in the amino-terminal regions of the precursor proteins. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase transcribes the positive-sense RNA genome into a negative-sense RNA strand. This serves both as a template for the synthesis of new positive-sense RNA genomes and for transcription of a series of subgenomic mRNA species, which are modified at the 5 0 end with a cap group and contain identical leader sequences in all mRNA molecules. The structural proteins are translated from the different subgenomic mRNAs, whose reading frames are localized in the 3 0 -terminal third of the positive-sense RNA genome. They partially overlap (nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, NendoU) which is present in all members of the order Nidovirales. Its activity seems to be especially necessary for the synthesis of subgenomic RNA molecules. In most cases, the functional assignments have been made by comparative sequence analysis and not by direct purification and biochemical characterization of protein activities.",

It encompasses the entire genome and has a negative polarity. Later, it has two functions in the replication cycle: it serves as a template for the synthesis of new viral genomes and for the production of subgenomic mRNA species, from which the various structural proteins of arteriviruses are translated. All subgenomic mRNAs have the same 5 0 and 3 0 termini, which correspond to those of the viral genome. At the 5 0 ends there is a uniform sequence, the leader RNA. It is capped at the 5 0 terminus and corresponds to the sequences in the 5 0 UTR of the genome. The leader sequence serves as a primer for the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA species. Near its 3 0 end, the leader RNA exhibits a conserved sequence (UCAAC in equine arteritis virus). Sequences complementary to this motif are found in the negative-sense RNA at different regions. They are located upstream of the different initiation sites for the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA species in the region of the genome between the end of the reading frame encoding polyprotein 1ab and the 3 0 end of the genome: they can hybridize with the leader RNA, thus providing a small double-stranded region with a free 3 0 -OH end to continue polymerization. As in coronaviruses, the RNA polymerase can itself probably not initiate the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA species at the different sites.

This process occurs in 20-30 % of all translation events and renders possible the synthesis of pp1ab, the precursor of the non-structural proteins. If this ribosomal frameshifting does not occur, then the translation will end at the stop codon at the end of open reading frame 1a, resulting in polyprotein 1a (pp1a; 450-500 kDa). These polyproteins contain the genetic information for two (in SARS-related coronavirus and avian infectious bronchitis virus) or three (in other coronaviruses) proteases, which autocatalytically cleave the precursor proteins pp1a and pp1ab, as well as a functionally active RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and an RNA helicase. The reading frames for the structural proteins are situated within the last third of the genome. In the 5 0 to 3 0 direction, they encode the envelope proteins S, HE (only in most betacoronaviruses, not in SARS-related coronavirus), E, M and, just Fig. 14. 22 Structure of a coronavirus particle.

In addition, there are various small open reading frames (2a, 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b) in the part of the genome encoding the structural proteins. The coronaviruses of different genera differ significantly in the occurrence of these small open reading frames that predominantly encode very small accessory proteins; most of them are not essential for viral replication.

To synthesize pp1ab, a ribosomal frameshift is necessary to skip the stop codon at the end of open reading frame1a. This occurs because of a defined secondary RNA structure, which forms a stem loop at the end of the first reading frame. The large, experimentally not isolable precursor protein pp1ab is autocatalytically cleaved by the activity of the proteases into 13-16 cleavage products, depending on the various virus types. The function of the resulting non-structural proteins has not been ascertained in all cases. The best investigated activities are those of the nonstructural proteins NSP1-NSP16 in SARS-related coronavirus; here, there is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NSP12) that is required for both replication of the viral RNA genome and synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs. It constitutes part of the large precursor protein pp1ab along with the RNA helicase (NSP13) that probably binds Zn 2+ ions, an exoribonuclease (NSP14), an endoribonuclease (NSP15) and a 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase (NSP16). SARS-related coronavirus includes in precursor protein pp1a (486 kDa), which is cleaved in this virus into 11 proteins (NSP1-NSP11), the sequence of papain-like protease 2 (PL2 pro ; NSP3) and an enzyme that resembles the 3C protease of picornaviruses (3CL pro , NSP5). The enzyme 3CL pro constitutes the most active protease and is responsible for 11 of the cleavage reactions in the precursor polyprotein. These two proteases are present in all coronaviruses. Most of them contain an additional papain-like cysteine protease (PL1 pro ) at the amino terminus of pp1a and pp1ab, which autocatalytically cleaves an amino-terminal domain from these polyproteins. Its function is not completely understood (Table 14. 19). In SARS-related coronavirus, instead of this proteolytic activity of non-structural protein NSP1, there is a function that interferes with the metabolism of the cells and causes the degradation of cellular mRNAs, including the transcripts that are necessary for the synthesis of class I interferons. In addition, the different coronaviruses encode some other nonstructural proteins which are produced during the infectious cycle. The genetic information resides in the gene region encoding the structural proteins, but not regularly in all virus types. The function of these small ancillary proteins is largely unknown.",

An additional glycoprotein (HE) is only present in most betacoronaviruses (Table 14 .19). The S protein (\"S\" for \"surface\" or \"spike\") has a molecular mass of 180-200 kDa. It is glycosylated and anchored in the envelope of the virus, but also in the cytoplasmic membrane by a transmembrane domain at the carboxy terminus, which is modified by an aliphatic acid. The S protein exists as a dimer or trimer and forms The fact that the S protein is also present in the cytoplasmic membrane of infected cells makes them targets for the antibody-mediated cytotoxic cell lysis by killer cells. Furthermore, the viral fusogenic activity resides in the S protein. This refers to the ability of the viral envelope to merge with the cytoplasmic membrane and to induce the fusion of the membranes of infected and uninfected cells to form polykaryocytes. To induce the fusogenic activity, the S protein of some coronaviruses must be cleaved by a cellular trypsin-like protease at a highly basic amino acid sequence in the middle of the protein (mouse hepatitis virus, infectious bronchitis virus of birds and similar viruses). This process probably occurs in the Golgi apparatus during late stages of viral maturation. It results in an amino-terminal moiety S 1 that is non-covalently linked to the carboxy-terminal half S 2 , and can be detached from the surface of the virus. The fusion effect is not mediated as in paramyxoviruses, in which a new hydrophobic amino terminus in the S 2 moiety is generated by cleavage (\u25b6 Sect. 15.3). The molecular mechanism of membrane fusion in coronaviruses has not been conclusively unravelled. Moreover, virus types whose S protein is not proteolytically cleaved can also induce cell fusions in spite of all that. Two hydrophobic segments of the S 2 protein seem to be involved in this process, as shown in the mouse hepatitis virus. If they are altered by mutation, the fusion activity is lost. The HE protein is present only in betacoronaviruses; SARS-related coronavirus does not possess such a gene. HE protein is glycosylated, has a molecular mass of about 65 kDa and forms dimers by disulphide bonds. The viruses that encode and express the HE protein have the capability of haemagglutinating and binding to erythrocytes. In this process, the HE protein interacts with the 9-O-acetylated neuraminic acid (sialic acid), which is a modification of lipid and protein components on cell surfaces. The HE protein has an esterase activity, which enables the virus to remove acetyl groups from sialic acid molecules. The HE protein of coronaviruses has a strong sequence homology to the HEF protein of influenza C viruses (\u25b6 Sect. 16.3).",

It has two functions in the replication cycle: it serves as a template for the synthesis of new viral genomes and several subgenomic mRNA species. Eight subgenomic mRNAs have been found in SARS-related coronavirus infections, from which the various accessory and structural proteins are translated. They are characterized by their discontinuous synthesis: all have the same 3 0 terminus, but their initiation sites are different and are located in the genomic region between the end of the reading frame of pp1ab and the 3 0 end of the genome. Despite their different initiation sites, all subgenomic mRNA molecules possess a standard sequence of approximately 60-90 nucleotides at the 5 0 terminus: the leader RNA. It has a capped 5 0 end and is complementary to the 3 0 terminus of the negative strand. It is believed that the leader sequence serves as a primer for the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA species; whether the activity of NSP8 is required for the synthesis of these short RNA molecules is unclear. The leader RNA has a conserved sequence (UCUAAAC) at the 3 0 terminus. Sequences complementary to this motif are found in the negative-sense RNA at different regions. They are located upstream of the different initiation sites for the synthesis of the subgenomic mRNA species: the leader RNA can hybridize with them, thus providing a small double-stranded region with a free 3 0 -OH end to resume polymerization. Probably, the RNA polymerase is not capable of initiating synthesis of the subgenomic mRNA species at the different start sites. Therefore, it was probably necessary for the virus to develop the transfer mechanism of a leader RNA. The finding that multiple elements of the conserved heptamer sequence are present upstream of some of the transcription start sites, e.g. upstream of the start of the coding sequences for the N protein, suggests that RNA synthesis is preferably initiated at these sites, thus facilitating regulation of the quantity of the various proteins.",

Until January 2003, the infections spread through human-to-human transmissions to Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, where they affected mainly people who were working in public health services. There was talk of an \"infectious atypical pneumonia\", and a number of infectious agents were suspected as possible causes, among others, chlamydia. When the number of patients increased to over 300, including 100 nurses and physicians, and five of them had died, the WHO was informed of this new infection on 11 February 2003. In March 2003, an infected nephrologist from Guangdong province stayed in a hotel in Hong Kong, and verifiably infected at least ten other hotel guests, who in turn carried the infection to various countries, including Singapore, Vietnam, Ireland, the USA and Canada. During a second infection wave in Hong Kong and all the afore-mentioned countries, particularly physicians and nurses were infected, and these in turn passed on the infection in the hospitals and to their families, thus exporting it to other countries. The pathogen arrived in central Europe (Germany) via Singapore. On 10 March 2003, this new disease received the name severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In the following months until 5 July 2003, the SARS disease emerged worldwide in 8,400 patients in 29 countries, and about 800 of them died. As a result of massive countermeasures by the WHO, it was possible to control the infection relatively rapidly. These measures included isolation/quarantine, entry bans/travel restrictions and checks at airports, and an open and timely information policy. In March 2003, Christian Drosten of the Bernhard Nocht Institute in Hamburg and other international research groups independently identified a coronavirus as the aetiologic agent of the disease, and determine its entire genome sequence. This facilitated the development of specific diagnostic test systems. At that time, a peculiarity was that all information was made immediately accessible and divulged, e.g. via the Internet.",

            "text": "Inasmuch as it was assumed that this new human virus had been transmitted to humans by zoonotic means, various animal species which are traded on animal markets in Guangdong were examined for the presence of analogous infections. Coronaviruses were found in nasal swabs and faecal samples from civet cats (Paguma larvata) and raccoons (Nyctereutes procyonoides). Their genomes were almost identical to that of human SARS-related coronavirus. Animal traders frequently exhibited antibodies that reacted with the proteins of SARS-related coronavirus. It was found that the virus can infect a number of other animals, such as cats, mice, ferrets and macaques; however, wild civet cats and raccoons were not infected. This suggested that these animals do not represent the natural hosts. The natural hosts are probably bats of the genus Rhinolophus (greater horseshoe bat), in which the SARS virus was detected in high concentrations. They excrete the pathogens in their faeces. The bats transmitted the virus to civet cats under the limited space conditions at the animal markets, and from these the virus was further transmitted to animal dealers, buyers and exploiters (cooks, furriers). The occurrence of further mutations facilitated the adaptation to human hosts, leading to the rapid transmission from infected patients to other people. The transmission among humans occurs preponderantly by airborne infection, whereby it was primarily assumed that every infected person develops symptoms within 10 days. However, there are clear indications that the virus is also excreted in the stool, and faecal-oral smear infections may contribute to its dissemination. With the exception of a few infections in Guangdong in January 2004 which were associated with animal contacts again, and some cases that could be attributed to laboratory contacts with SARS-related coronavirus, no more SARS infections and illnesses have occurred since the SARS outbreak of 2003.",

The ACE-2 receptor proteins, to which the virus attaches by S proteins, are found on the surface of cells in many tissues; they are an integral part of the renin-angiotensin system and regulate it. The interaction of S proteins with ACE-2 decreases its concentration on the cell surface. This possibly induces a particular susceptibility to inflammations and lung failure in infected patients. In addition to ACE-2, the S proteins have the ability to attach to DC-SIGN. They are receptor proteins that are found on the surface of dendritic cells. However, they do not directly permit the entry of the virus to these cells, but they can transport the virus to the lymph nodes and other tissues containing ACE-2-positive cells, thus mediating infection in trans. The virus seems to spread via the bloodstream throughout the body, and subsequently infects -like animal coronaviruses -endothelial, lung, kidney and intestinal epithelial cells. Many patients have a myocardial infarction during the disease. Possibly, this is associated with binding of viral S proteins to ACE-2 proteins on the surface of myocytes.",

Simultaneously, a rapid decrease in CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes can be observed in patients during the acute phase of infection. The cause of this decline is unclear. SARS-related coronavirus is not able to infect lymphocytes; therefore, destruction of T cells cannot be a direct consequence of infection. Possibly, apoptotic processes induced by the infection may be involved.

An immunoprophylaxis is not available. A globally important disease of poultry is caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus. Apart from an acute disease of the respiratory tract, substantial economic loss can arise from lesions of the fallopian tubes and the associated decline of egg production. Mouse hepatitis virus is widespread in mouse populations. It represents an important model system for studying the biology and pathogenesis of coronavirus infections. Mouse hepatitis virus causes a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, which can range from gastrointestinal, hepatic and respiratory symptoms to central nervous system disorders. Introduction into laboratory animal colonies occurs by inclusion of mice with persistent infections. The diagnosis is performed histopathologically or by cultivation of the virus. The elimination of the virus from infected colonies is almost impossible. Usually, it is necessary to annihilate the colony and to replace the infected livestock with new, virus-free animals.

The protein succession order in the table corresponds to the real order of their reading frames in the viral genome ADCC antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, BiP binding immunoglobulin protein, ERGIC ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, pp1a polyprotein 1a, pp1ab polyprotein 1b, ssRNA single-stranded RNA club-like protuberances on the surface of the virus. Neutralizing antibodies are produced against the S protein in the course of an infection. Three important epitopes have been identified within the amino acid sequence. The virus attaches to cell surface molecules by specific domains of the S protein.",
