However, approximately 20% require hospitalization due to more severe disease. A study of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 published on 7 February 2020 found that 26% of patients admitted to hospital required transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 4.3% died; however, given that a number of patients were still hospitalized at the time of this report, this number may be an underestimate (Wang et al. 2020) . A previous study had found that out of 41 admitted hospital patients, 13 (32%) were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died (Huang et al. 2020) . A more recent study with 1099 patients indicated that 16% of patients developed a severe form of disease, 5% were admitted to an ICU, 2.3% underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% died (Guan et al. 2020) .",

The interim looks will occur after roughly 75, 150, and 225 patients are enrolled, but all interims are subject to change depending on enrollment. If the sample size is increased during the study, the remaining efficacy interims will be performed at similar proportions of information to the original planned efficacy interim analyses. The first efficacy interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 75 patients (50 TCZ and 25 placebo) have reached the 28-day follow-up time point and will be based on the mortality rate at 28 days (secondary endpoint). If the results of one of the interim analyses meets the pre-specified criteria for efficacy, further enrollment in the placebo arm will be discontinued and all enrolled patients will receive open-label TCZ. At this point, efficacy will be declared. Recruitment into the TCZ arm will continue until 220 patients have been enrolled. If there is a potential for further recruitment into the placebo arm to be stopped for positive efficacy because of the interim analysis, the type I error rate will be controlled to ensure statistical validity is maintained. Specifically, the Lan-DeMets \uf061-spending function that approximates the O'Brien-Fleming boundary will be applied to determine the critical value for stopping for positive efficacy at the interim analysis (DeMets and Lan 1994). Interim analyses for efficacy will use the Fisher's exact test for difference in proportions and will utilize an O'Brien-Fleming alpha-spending function. The efficacy boundaries for the z-scores at the four looks (three interim looks and final analysis) are 4.558, 3.126, 2.492 and 1.997.",

Specifically, the Lan-DeMets \uf061-spending function that approximates the O'Brien-Fleming boundary will be applied to determine the critical value for stopping for positive efficacy at the interim analysis (DeMets and Lan 1994). Interim analyses for efficacy will use the Fisher's exact test for difference in proportions and will utilize an O'Brien-Fleming alpha-spending function. The efficacy boundaries for the z-scores at the four looks (three interim looks and final analysis) are 4.364, 2.986, 2.377, and 2.011. The critical value at the final analysis will be adjusted accordingly to maintain the protocolspecified overall type I error rate, per standard Lan-DeMets methodology. The study management team will remain blinded unless the results meet the efficacy criteria. The interim efficacy analyses will be produced by a statistical programmer independent of the study management team and will reviewed by a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Full statistical details of the planned interim analyses, along with the rationale and timing will be documented in an interim statistical analysis plan, which will be made available to the relevant health authorities before the data snapshot for the first interim. A Data Monitoring Committee will also evaluate safety according to policies and procedures detailed in a DMC Charter. Regular safety reviews will begin after approximately 15 patients (10 TCZ, 5 placebo) have been enrolled and reached 14-day follow-up. Early stopping criteria based on compelling efficacy or an imbalance in adverse events will be detailed in the DMC charter. The safety interim analyses will also be conducted by a statistical programmer independent from the study management team and will be reviewed by the DMC. Interactions between the DMC and Sponsor will be carried out as specified in the DMC Charter.

According to the authors, after TCZ treatment, fever returned to normal and all other symptoms improved remarkably. Fifteen of the 20 patients (75.0%) had lowered their oxygen intake and one patient needed no oxygen therapy.
