Cause of death data obtained using various revisions of the International Classification of Diseases and Injuries (ICD) (7) were mapped to the GBD cause list. Many deaths, however, are assigned to causes that cannot be the underlying cause of death (eg, cardiopulmonary failure) or are inadequately specified (eg, injury from undetermined intent). These deaths were reassigned to the most probable underlying causes of death as part of the data processing for GBD. Redistribution algorithms can be divided into three categories: proportionate redistribution, fixed proportion redistribution based on published studies or expert judgment, or statistical algorithms. For GBD 2019, data for 116 million deaths attributed to multiple causes were analysed to produce more empirical redistribution algorithms for sepsis (8) , heart failure, pulmonary embolism, acute kidney injury, hepatic failure, acute respiratory failure, pneumonitis, and five intermediate causes (hydrocephalus, toxic encephalopathy, compression of brain, encephalopathy, and cerebral oedema) in the central nervous system. To redistribute unspecified injuries, we used a method similar to that of intermediate cause redistribution, using the pattern of the nature of injury codes in the causal chain where the ICD codes X59 (\"exposure to unspecified factor\") and Y34 (\"unspecified event, undetermined intent\") and GBD injury causes were the underlying cause of death. These new algorithms led to important changes in the causes to which these intermediate outcomes were redistributed. Additionally, data on deaths from diabetes and stroke lack the detail on subtype in many countries; we ran regressions on vital registration data with at least 50% of deaths coded specifically to type 1 or 2 diabetes and ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or subarachnoid stroke to predict deaths by these subtypes when these were coded to unspecified diabetes or stroke.",

To enhance transparency and to standardise and improve methods in GBD 2019, we estimated correction factors for alternative case definitions or measurement methods using network meta-regression, including only data where two methods were assessed in the same location-time period or in the exact same population.

Previous publications (3, 4, 10) provide more details on these general GBD methods. Briefly, CODEm is a highly systematised tool to analyse cause of death data using an ensemble of different modelling methods for rates or cause fractions with varying choices of covariates that perform best with out-of-sample predictive validity testing. DisMod-MR is a Bayesian meta-regression tool that allows evaluation of all available data on incidence, prevalence, remission, and mortality for a disease, enforcing consistency between epidemiological parameters. ST-GPR is a set of regression methods that borrow strength between locations and over time for single metrics of interest, such as risk factor exposure or mortality rates. In addition, for select diseases, particularly for rarer outcomes, alternative modelling strategies have been developed.",

On the basis of these reviews and meta-regressions, 12 risk-outcome pairs included in GBD 2017 were excluded from GBD 2019: vitamin A deficiency and lower respiratory infections; zinc deficiency and lower respiratory infections; diet low in fruits and four outcomes: lip and oral cavity cancer, nasopharynx cancer, other pharynx cancer, and larynx cancer; diet low in whole grains and two outcomes: intracerebral haemorrhage and subarachnoid haemorrhage; intimate partner violence and maternal abortion and miscarriage; and high FPG and three outcomes: chronic kidney disease due to hypertension, chronic kidney disease due to glomerulonephritis, and chronic kidney disease due to other and unspecified causes. In addition, on the basis of multiple requests to begin capturing important dimensions of climate change into GBD, we evaluated the direct relationship between high and low non-optimal temperatures on all GBD disease and injury outcomes. Rather than rely on a heterogeneous literature with a small number of studies examining relationships with specific diseases and injuries, we analysed individuallevel cause of death data for all locations with available information on daily temperature, location, and International Classification of Diseases-coded cause of death. These data totalled 58.9 million deaths covering eight countries. On the basis of this analysis, 27 GBD cause Level 3 outcomes met the inclusion criteria for each non-optimal risk factor and were included in this analysis. Other climate-related relationships, such as between precipitation or humidity and health outcomes, have not yet been evaluated.",

We did meta-analyses of relative risks from these studies as a function of exposure. For GBD 2019, 81 new systematic reviews were done, including for 44 diet risk-outcome pairs. To allow for risk functions that might not be log-linear, we relaxed the meta-regression assumptions to allow for monotonically increasing or decreasing but potentially non-linear functions for 147 risk-outcome pairs. 218 risk-outcome pairs were estimated assuming log-linear relationships. For 126 risk-outcome pairs, exposure was dichotomous or polytomous. For 37 risk-outcome pairs, the population attributable fractions were assumed by definition to be 100% (eg, 100% of diabetes is assumed to be, by definition, related to elevated FPG). For 32 risk-outcome pairs, other approaches were used that reflected the nature of the evidence that has been collected for those risks. For risks that affect cardiovascular outcomes, we adjusted relative risks by age such that they follow the empirical pattern of attenuation seen in published studies for elevated SBP, FPG, and LDL cholesterol.",

For many risk factors, exposure data were modelled using either spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression or DisMod-MR 2.1 (4, 15) , which are Bayesian statistical models developed over the past 12 years for GBD analyses. For most risk factors, the distribution of exposure across individuals was estimated by modelling a measure of dispersion, usually the SD, and fitting an ensemble of parametric distributions to the predicted mean and SD. Ensemble distributions for each risk were estimated based on individual-level data. Because of the strong dependency between birthweight and gestational age, exposure for these risks was modelled as a joint distribution using the copula method (16) . In many cases, exposure data were available for the reference method of ascertainment and for alternative methods, such as tobacco surveys reporting daily smoking versus total smoking; in these cases, we estimated the statistical relationship between the reference and alternative methods of ascertainment using network meta-regression and corrected the alternative data using this relationship.",

For risk factors with J-shaped or U-shaped risk functions, such as for sodium and ischaemic heart disease or BMI and ischaemic heart disease, the TMREL was determined as the low point of the risk function. When the bottom of the risk function was flat or poorly determined, the TMREL uncertainty interval (UI) captured the range over which risks are indistinguishable. For protective risks with monotonically declining risk functions with exposure, namely risk factors where exposure lowers the risk of an outcome, the challenge is selecting the level of exposure with the lowest level of risk strongly supported by the available data. Projecting beyond the level of exposure supported by the available studies could exaggerate the attributable burden for a risk factor. In these cases, for each riskoutcome pair, we determined the exposure level at the 85th percentile of exposure in the cohorts or trials used in the risk meta-regression. We then generated the TMREL by weighting each risk-outcome pair by the relative global magnitude of each outcome.",

It is also useful to assess the PAF and attributable burden for combinations of risk factors, such as all diet components together or household air and ambient particulate matter pollution. To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, we should take into account how one risk factor might be mediated through another (eg, the effect of fruit intake might be partly mediated through fibre intake).

Estimates of this proportion for all locations were then generated using a DisMod proportion-only model. Due to a high degree of variability in pre-redistribution coding practices by location, we used the global age-, sex-, and year-specific proportions of acute deaths in subsequent calculations. The global proportions were multiplied by post-Fauxcorrect (final GBD 2019 CoD estimates with GBD 2017 scalers) IHD deaths by location to generate CSMR estimates for MI. These data, along with incidence and excess mortality data, informed a DisMod model to estimate the prevalence and incidence of myocardial infarction due to ischaemic heart disease. \uf0b7 These estimates were split into estimates for days 1-2 and days 3-28 post-event. Disability weights were assigned to each of these two groupings. \uf0b7 We set a value prior of one month for remission (11/13) from the MI model. We also set a value prior for the maximum excess mortality rate of 10 for all ages. We included the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index as a fixed-effect country-level covariate on excess mortality, forcing an inverse relationship. Asymptomatic ischaemic heart disease \uf0b7 Excess mortality estimates from the myocardial infarction model were used to generate data of the incidence of surviving 28 days post-event. \uf0b7 We used these data, along with the estimates of CSMR due to chronic IHD (the other part of the proportion described in step 1) and excess mortality data in a DisMod model to estimate the prevalence of persons with IHD following myocardial infarction. This estimate included subjects with angina and heart failure; a proportion of this prevalence was removed in order to avoid doublecounting based on evidence from the literature (2) . The result of this step generates estimates of asymptomatic ischaemic heart disease following myocardial infarction. \uf0b7 We set a value prior of 0 for remission for all ages. \uf0b7 We also included the log-transformed, age-standardised SEV scalar for IHD as a fixed effect, countrylevel covariate on prevalence and LDI (I$ per capita) as a fixed-effect country-level covariate on excess mortality, forcing an inverse relationship for LDI. Angina \uf0b7 We used prevalence data from the literature and USA claims databases, along with data on mortality risk to estimate the prevalence and incidence of angina for all locations.

Random effects on prevalence were limited to +-0.3 in order to limit the random geographic variation in the estimated birth prevalence. No minimum excess mortality rate was set in this model, as VSD/ASD cases are not associated with excess mortality rates as high as the other subtypes of congenital heart defects.

The criteria for mitral regurgitation follow the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology definition of haemodynamically progressive or severe mitral regurgitation and are listed in Table 3 . Mild haemodynamic mitral regurgitation was not included in our case definition because mild mitral valve disease cannot be differentiated from nonpathological regurgitation and is generally not reported in population-based studies.

We then estimated the proportion of those with prevalent disease who were haemodynamically moderate, assuming that this would approximate the proportion who were asymptomatic. We next estimated the proportion of those with symptomatic disease (ie, those with haemodynamically severe disease) who were treated. The remaining proportion -those with untreated symptomatic disease -was split into four proportions: 1) controlled, medically managed; 2) mild; 3) moderate; and 4) severe heart failure. All proportions were calculated and converted to population prevalence at the draw level, thus propagating uncertainty from each step through to all subsequent steps. Population prevalence for each severity level are necessary in order to accurately calculate the burden for these diseases. Figure 1 visualises this framework.

BRFSS is a telephone survey conducted in the United States for all counties. It collects self-reported diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia. These self-reported values of prevalence of raised total cholesterol in each age group, sex, US state, and year were used to predict a mean total cholesterol for the same strata with a regression using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative health examination survey of the US adult population. The regression was: TC l,a,t,s = \u03b2 0 + \u03b2 1 prev l,a,t,s where TC l,a,t,s is the location, age, time, and sex specific mean total cholesterol and prev l,a,t,s is the location, age, time, and sex specific prevalence of raised total cholesterol. The coefficients for both models are reported in Table 1 . Out of sample RMSE was used to quantify the predictive validity of the model. The regression was repeated 10 times for each sex, each time randomly holding out 20% of the data. The RMSEs from each holdout analysis were averaged to get the average out of sample RMSE. The results of this holdout analysis are reported in Table 2 . Total cholesterol estimates were crosswalked to LDL using the lipid crosswalk reported above. Age and sex splitting Prior to modelling, data provided in age groups wider than the GBD five-year age groups were processed using the approach outlined in Ng and colleagues. 2 Briefly, age-sex patterns were identified using person-level microdata (58 sources), and estimate age-sex-specific levels of total cholesterol from aggregated results reported in published literature or survey reports.

The tool enabled us to incorporate random effects across studies and include data with different age ranges. RRs were used universally for all countries and produce RRs with uncertainty and covariance across ages, considering the uncertainty of the data points.",

For LDL and ischaemic stroke, a similar approach was used, except that there was no age intercept at age 110, due to the fact that there was no statistically significant relationship between LDL and stroke after age 70 with a mean RR less than one. We assumed that there is not a protective effect of LDL and therefore did not include an RR for ages 80+.",

The WHO growth reference for children ages 5-19 was derived from United States data, which are less representative than the multinational data used by IOTF. Additionally, the switch between references at age 5 can produce artificial discontinuities. Given that we estimate global childhood overweight and obesity for ages 2-19 (with ages 19 using standard adult cutoffs), the IOTF cutoffs were preferable.

This was recognised to represent a tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency when utilising all the available data sources. In particular, the GBD 2013 exposure estimates were known to underestimate ground measurements in specific locations (see discussion in Brauer and colleagues, 2015) . 5 This underestimation was largely due to the use of a single, global calibration function, whereas in reality the relationship between ground measurements and other variables will vary spatially.",

Individual country-level estimates were therefore based on a combination of information from the country, its region, and its super-region. This was implemented within a Bayesian hierarchical modelling (BHM) framework. BHMs provide an extremely useful and flexible framework in which to model complex relationships and dependencies in data. Uncertainty can also be propagated through the model, allowing uncertainty arising from different components, both data sources and models, to be incorporated within estimates of uncertainty associated with the final estimates. The results of the modelling comprise a posterior distribution for each grid cell, rather than just a single point estimate, allowing a variety of summaries to be calculated. The primary outputs here are the median and 95% credible intervals for each grid cell. Based on the availability of ground measurement data, modelling and evaluation were focused on the year 2016.",

In DIMAQ, ground measurements from different years were all assumed to have been made in the primary year of interest and then regressed against values from other inputs (eg, satellites, etc.) made in that year. In the presence of changes over time, therefore, and particularly in areas where no recent measurements were available, there was the possibility of mismatches between the ground measurements and other variables. In DIMAQ2, ground measurements were matched with other inputs (over time), and the (global-level) coefficients were allowed to vary over time, subject to smoothing that is induced by a first-order random walk process. In addition, the manner in which spatial variation can be incorporated within the model has developed: where there are sufficient data, the calibration equations can now vary (smoothly) both within and between countries, achieved by allowing the coefficients to follow (smooth) Gaussian processes. Where there are insufficient data within a country, to produce accurate equations, as before, information is borrowed from lower down the hierarchy and it is supplemented with information from the wider region.",

The TMREL was defined as a uniform distribution rather than a fixed value in order to represent the uncertainty regarding the level at which the scientific evidence was consistent with adverse effects of exposure. The specific outdoor air pollution cohort studies selected for this averaging were based on the criteria that their fifth percentiles were less than that of the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention II (CPSII) cohort's fifth percentile of 8.2 based on Turner and colleagues (2016). 10 This criterion was selected since GBD 2010 used the minimum, 5.8, and fifth percentile solely from the CPS II cohort. The resulting lower/upper bounds of the distribution for GBD 2019 were 2.4 and 5.9. This has not changed since GBD 2015.",

            "text": "For GBD 2019, we made several important changes to the risk functions. Previously, we have used relative risk estimates for active smoking, converting cigarettes-per-day to PM2.5 exposure in order to estimate the PM2.5 relative risk at the highest end of the PM2.5 exposure-response curve. We took this approach because the vast majority of the air pollution epidemiological studies have been performed in low-pollution settings in high-income countries, preventing us from extrapolating the steep relationship at the beginning of the exposure range to locations with high exposure but no relative risk estimates, such as India and China. However, with the recent publication of studies in China and other higherexposure settings and additional studies of HAP, we have been able to include more estimates at high PM2.5 levels in the model. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Furthermore, in contrast to previous cycles of the GBD where the power function used to develop the IER required the inclusion of active smoking data to anchor the risk function, with the current use of splines and their flexibility, it is easier to fit functions to the (ambient, household, and SHS) data without active smoking data. Beginning in GBD 2019, we excluded active smoking studies from the risk curves. Removal of active smoking information removes an important source of uncertainty in our earlier estimates related to differences in dose rates and other aspects of exposure between active smoking and the other PM2.5 sources, including differences in voluntary (active smoking) and involuntary (ambient and household PM2.5, secondhand smoke) exposure. 16, 17 Additionally, in the past, we have built the curves for ischaemic heart disease and stroke based on studies of mortality and used evidence from three studies of both mortality and incidence to scale down the mortality curves to generate estimates of incidence risk. This year we extracted incidence and mortality from all available studies and included this as a covariate in the model. There was no significant difference between estimates of incidence risk and mortality risk, so we included both types of risk estimates in the curve fitting and used the same curve for both incidence and mortality. This is what was done for all other outcomes in the past and in GBD 2019.",

However, in the absence of consistent and robust evidence of differential toxicity by source and sufficient estimates of source or composition-specific exposure-response relationships, integrating across OAP, SHS, and HAP studies is the approach most consistent with the current evidence, as reviewed by US EPA and WHO. 20, 21 Use of a common risk function may affect the magnitude of risk estimates for HAP and OAP compared to separate risk functions. As more data from higher OAP concentration locations and from HAP studies for non-respiratory outcomes becomes available it may be possible to evaluate the strength of evidence for each and to develop separate risk functions.",

The data went through three rounds of outliering. First, they were age-sex split using daily smoking prevalence to generate number of cigarettes per smoker per day for a given location-age-sex-year. If more than 12 points for a particular source-location-year (equal to over 1/3 of the split points) were above the given thresholds, that source-location-year was outliered. A point would not be outliered if it was (in cigarettes per smoker): under five (10-14 year olds); under 20 (males, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] year olds); under 18 (females, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] year olds); under 38/35 and over three (males/females, 20+ year olds). These thresholds were chosen by visualising histograms of the data for each age-sex, as well as with expert knowledge about reasonable consumption levels. In the second round of outliering, the mean tobacco per capita value over a 10-year window was calculated. If a point was over 70% of that mean value away from the mean value, it was outliered. The 70% limit was chosen using histograms of these distances. Additionally, some manual outliering was performed to account for edge cases.

Since the data from our main sources covered different time periods, by imputing a complete time series for each data series, we reduced the probability that compositional bias of the sources was leading to biased final estimates. To impute the missing years for each series, we modelled the log ratio of each pair of sources as a function of an intercept and nested random effects on super-region, region, and location. The appropriate predicted ratio was multiplied by each source that we did have, and then the predictions were averaged to get the final imputed value. For example, if source A was missing for a particular location-year, but sources B and C were present, then we predicted A twice: once from the modelled ratio of A to B, and again from the modelled ratio of A to C. These two predictions were then averaged. For some locations where there was limited overlap between series, the predicted ratio did not make sense, and a regional ratio was used.",

Second, we analysed surveys with both household composition data and tobacco use questions and determined that the distribution of household size, mean age of the household members, and the age distribution were not significantly different between households with and without a self-reported smoker. Since we did not find that household composition varied between smokers and non-smokers, we then used the GBD 2019 primary daily smoking prevalence model to calculate the probability that each household member is a daily smoker. Next, we used the probability of the union of sets on each individual household member to calculate the overall probability that at least one of the other household members was a daily smoker. As in GBD 2017, we incorporated occupational exposure by modelling prevalence of current exposure to secondhand smoke at work, by age, sex, location, and year, using ST-GPR. In order to avoid double counting we calculated the probability that an individual is exposed through either non-occupational exposure or occupational exposure, given their age, sex, and household composition. Finally, we multiplied this probability of exposure by the probability that the individual is not a smoker themselves (ie, 1 minus primary daily smoking prevalence for that person's location, year, age, and sex).

The random-effects method allows for more variation between the studies, and incorporates this variance into the estimation process.

To incorporate this age trend in the relative risks, we first identified the median age-at-event across all cohorts and considered that as the reference age-group.

The algorithm uses aerosol optical depth (AOD) from several updated satellite products (MAIAC, MODIS C6.1, and MISR v23), including finer resolution, increased global coverage, and improved long-term stability. Ground-based observations from a global sunphotometer network (AERONET version 3) are used to combine different AOD information sources. This is the first time that data from MAIAC at 1 km resolution was used to estimate PM2.5 at the global scale. The GEOS-Chem chemical transport model with updated algorithms was used for geophysical relationships between surface PM2.5 and AOD.Updates to the GEOS-Chem simulation included improved representation of mineral dust and secondary organic aerosol, as well as updated emission inventories. The resultant geophysical PM2.5 estimates are highly consistent with ground monitors worldwide (R 2 =0.81, slope = 1.03, n = 2541).Population dataA comprehensive set of population data, adjusted to match UN2015 Population Prospectus, on a highresolution grid was obtained from the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) database. Estimates for 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were available from GPW version 4, with estimates for 1990 and 1995 obtained from the GPW version 3. These data are provided on a 0.0083 o \u00d7 0.0083 o resolution. Aggregation to each 0.1 o \u00d70.1 o grid cell was accomplished by summing the central 12 \u00d7 12 population cells. Populations estimates for 2001-2004, 2006-2009, 2011-2014 and 2016-2019 were obtained by interpolation using natural splines with knots placed at 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. This was performed for each grid cell.Chemical transport model simulationsEstimates of the sum of particulate sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and organic carbon and the compositional concentrations of mineral dust simulated using the GEOS Chem chemical transport model, and a measure combining elevation and the distance to the nearest urban land surface (as described in van Donkelaar and colleagues 2016 2 and Hammer and colleagues (submitted)) 1 were available for 2000-2017 for each 0.1 o \u00d70.1 o grid cell.",

GBD 2019 also makes use of an innovation in the way that samples from the (Bayesian) model are used to represent distributions of estimated concentrations in each grid-cell. Here estimates, and distributions representing uncertainty, of concentrations for each grid are obtained by taking repeated (joint) samples from the posterior distributions of the parameters and calculating estimates based on a linear combination of those samples and the input variables. 8 DIMAQ2 was used to produce estimates of ambient PM2.5 for 1990, 1995, and 2010-2019 by matching the gridded estimates with the corresponding coefficients from the calibration. As there is a lag in reporting ambient air pollution based quantities, the input variables were extrapolated (as in GBD 2017), allowing estimates for 2018 and 2019 to be produced in the same way as other years and, crucially, allowing measures of uncertainty to be produced within the BHM framework rather than by using posthoc approximations.Estimates from the satellites and the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model in 2018 and 2019 were produced by extrapolating estimates from 2000-2017 using generalised additive models, 9 on a cell-bycell basis, except in those grid cells that saw a >100% increase between 2016 and 2017, in which case only the 2000-2016 estimates were used for extrapolating, in order to avoid unrealistic and/or unjustified extrapolation of trends.

We use frequency, duration and intensity of activity to calculate total metabolic equivalent-minutes per week. MET (Metabolic Equivalent) is the ratio of the working metabolic rate to the resting metabolic rate. One MET is equivalent to 1 kcal/kg/hour and is equal to the energy cost of sitting quietly. A MET is also defined as the oxygen uptake in ml/kg/min with one MET equal to the oxygen cost of sitting quietly, around 3.5 ml/kg/min.",
