We had originally intended for our review to involve more nanoscience, and conceptual bridging between small molecules and nanomaterials; we have made some in-roads and connections. In this review, we focus on selenium as a constituent of small molecule sensors. At the outset, aside from our general awareness, we started from a list of articles generated by an ISI search (Indexes: SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&HCI, CPCI-S, CPCI-SSH, ESCI) with topical key words as follows: TOPIC: (selenide or selenium or selane) AND TOPIC: (probe or sensor) AND TOPIC: (fluoresc* or lumin*).",

But it seems that the Se-S bond is receiving more research attention now. In the course of reviewing, we found it important to discuss different types of reports because of a \"chain link\" relationship that free selenium might have with bound selenium; also the relationship that reduced selenium has with oxidized selenium are important to characterize. There are therefore closely related reports from chemists, physicists, medicinal chemists, and biologists. We also discuss selenium in physics surfaces, and nanoscience with regard to sensing and fluorescence. Quantum dots and nanoparticles for sensing, coatings and catalyst poisons are discussed. Thin films and aspects of solar conversions related to probing are included. We could not possibly go into detail regarding all 150+ papers. We focused on selected articles and show literature developments regarding selenium and molecular sensing research that is moving fast to help spread interest in the research area of organoselenium chemistry.",

If the selenium is an analyte, it can range in identify from reduced organic selenium (selenocysteine and H 2 Se) to oxidized inorganic selenium (SeO) n . Reports relevant to biomolecules such as DNA and BSA are briefly mentioned as well. An introduction involves some important papers dealing with biology, disease and the environment.

The disorder in question is vitiligo disease, a hereditary/acquired progressive pigmentation disorder characterized by discoloration of skin as a result of melanocyte dysfunction. MnSOD Ala-9Val is an antioxidant responsible for conversion of the superoxide radical into hydrogen peroxide; GPx1 Pro198Leu is an antioxidant responsible for conversion of hydrogen peroxide into water. Polymorphisms of these enzymes are much less catalytically active.

[15] explored the well-known Zinc pyr probe; it was used for determinations of free Zinc (labile Zinc). The measurements were found to be on the nanomolar level (0.09-0.42 nM); importantly, the correlations with Se concentration were also monitored. An important paper by Chen et al. [16] considers Se in the context of neurodegenerative disease; they attempt to gauge the selenium content, and use fluorescence. Mice were studied and treated with, and without, sodium selenate (Na2SeO4). 2D images (2D-DIE) were acquired and involved depleted serum proteins. Triply transgenic mice (3xTg-AD mice) were used in determinations. Selenium in biology sometimes involves discussion of specific biomolecules and organisms. Selenium is also important for animal reproduction. Piagentini et al. [17] investigated the effect of selenium in Brazilian ram sperm. From these studies, it is known from 350 days of investigation that the ram without selenium supplementation possessed a major defect in sperm morphology. The sperm has a defect in its head and the folding action of its tail due to the defect in its chromosome.",

            "text": "Redox signaling and antioxidant aspects of selenium appears in the literature from time to time. Some of this work accents the importance of the Se-S bond. Reports by Hamsath et al. dealing with this heteronuclear bond in particular is important for our review and timely for the community [18] . Nuthanakanti et al. designed fluorescence probes for studying the structure and conformation of the RNA decoding site (A-Site, A stands for aminoacyl) in bacteria and its interaction with certain antibiotics (aminoglycosides). The authors used modified fluorescence bases and selenium as an X-ray crystallography phasing agent ( Se U) ( Figure 1 ). While people usually use an atom such as a halogen or heavy element as a phasing agent [19] , the usage of selenium has advantages. These include high intensity scattering peaks and resistance to decomposition, unlike halogens that can undergo dehalogenation if/when they are exposed to ionizing radiation such as X-rays. Because of the stacking structure, the non-bonded A-site that contains Se U has low fluorescence intensity. However, upon titration of antibiotics (e.g., paromonycin, neomycin B and tobramycin), the fluorescence intensity in solution increases progressively. Moreover, authors succeeded to observe the conformation binding of A-site with neomycin; 2-AP, which is a well-known conformation sensitive nucleoside, cannot achieve that however [20] . There have been many important and pertinent Se-related review articles produced. One of these articles is the paper entitled, \"A review of bioselenol-specific fluorescent probes: Synthesis, properties, and imaging applications.\" As the title states, the main stance in this article is how bioselenol action can proceed in screening of anticancer compounds.

This report is a literature review which contains 91 references, and authored by 6 authors. The RSeH bonds are prevalent in thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), selenocysteine (Sec) and also the simple H2Se molecule There have been many important and pertinent Se-related review articles produced. One of these articles is the paper entitled, \"A review of bioselenol-specific fluorescent probes: Synthesis, properties, and imaging applications.\" As the title states, the main stance in this article is how bioselenol action can proceed in screening of anticancer compounds. The contents involve fluorescent probes that are analyte-specific; aryl cleavable groups (2,4-dinitrophenyl-) , the S-S motif as a reactive site for detection, benzoselenadiazole as a recognition group, and the Michael-type reactive receptors and groups that involve the Au-S bond as a motif are all target moeities. This report is a literature review which contains 91 references, and authored by 6 authors. The RSeH bonds are prevalent in thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), selenocysteine (Sec) and also the simple H 2 Se molecule itself. Therefore, a mixture of protein, small organic molecules and, literally, inorganic selenium itself are discussed in this article [21] .",

The probe posted a 138-fold enhancement (10 mM PBS buffer, pH 7.4 and 37 \u2022 C) ( Figure 2 ). The quantum yield, upon addition of 10 equiv of Sec, was reported to be 0.46. Fsec-1 shows saturation in 20 min. Fsec possesses a LOD as low as 1.0 nM and can be used optimally within an acid-base window of pH 5.0-9.0. Fsec-1 is also photostable when irradiated with UV-Vis light for 120 min, and photostable when scanning was continued for 30 min. Fsec-1 has good selectivity in the presence of biothiols, amino acids, cations, anions, selected ROS, some reducing agents, and even other selenium-containing compounds. From the MTT assay, it is known that Fsec-1 has low cell toxicity in the concentration range of \u226420 mM. Fsec-1 performance is evaluated in vitro by MCF-7 cells and in vivo by animal models. Kunming mice and nude mice that contain tumor cells were used in this study. Is it known that Fsec-1 can be used to help detect and image Sec concentration in a time-dependent manner. This was determined, either endogenously, or exogenously from a triggering agent such as Na 2 SeO 3 , dibenzyl diselenide and SeO 2 [24] . Sec has cytoprotective effects and intracellular redox homeostasis in mitochondria and is present in important active sites (residues) in the enzyme oxidoreductase. Han et al. developed a novel fluorescent probe, Mito-diNO2, for the detection of Sec. The molecular structure of Mito-diNO2 is based on heptamethine cyanine and bears two moieties ( Figure 3 ); 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonamide is introduced as the responsive receptor unit. The lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation can function as a mitochondrial targeting unit. In living cells, the probe can become accumulated in mitochondria and can selectively detect endogenous Sec concentration. The cell test of injecting carbon disulfide (CS2) with the probe indicated that CS2 exposure can induce decreased levels of Sec and lead to triphenylphosphonium cation can function as a mitochondrial targeting unit. In living cells, the probe can become accumulated in mitochondria and can selectively detect endogenous Sec concentration. The cell test of injecting carbon disulfide (CS 2 ) with the probe indicated that CS 2 exposure can induce decreased levels of Sec and lead to acute inflammation.

It is not convenient to have RSeH pre-prepared and sitting for long times [28] . The so-called isosteric change from O to S to Se and also carbon in the form of [CMe2] makes for a chemically meaningful derivatization and discussion regarding the heavy atom effect ( Figure 5 ). It is interesting work based on the extension to the molecular curvature that may be present in the excited state structure. One observes an increase in the emission maxima at 534, 642, and 687 nm for the O, S, and Secontaining systems, respectively. The fluorescent quantum yields (\u03a6F) too, were found to decrease in values, respectively: 0.35, 0.17, 0.02. The authors had a chance to analyze the bending angle. Also, there was an important solvent viscosity determination [29] . Regarding the synthesis of new selenium derivatives, Da Silva et al. successfully designed and synthesized a series of novel benzimidazo[1,2-a]quinoline derivatives introducing organochalcogens (S, Se) with reasonable yield involving short reaction times. The synthetic method involved transition-metal-free cascade reactions; this includes an intermolecular aromatic nucleophilic substitution (SNAr). Finally, an intramolecular Knoevenagel condensation leads to various organochalcogen-containing planar organic derivatives ( Figure 6 ). Photophysical properties of both the sulfur and selenium derivatives show similar patterns; absorption maxima were positioned in the UV region (~355 nm), whereas the fluorescence emission was positioned in the violet-blue region (~440 nm); a relatively large Stokes shift was observed (~90 nm). The experimental fluorescence of sulfur analogues shows higher values than that of the selenium derivatives; this is commonly encountered and attributed to the intersystem crossing permitted by the selenium atom. In either the ground or excited state, this new organochalcogen derivatives did not display remarkable solvatochromism. In addition, absorption or emission maxima positions were not altered by the changing of the chalcogen. Owing to the quenching property of selenium, the fluorescence quantum yields are lower in value, in comparison to those The so-called isosteric change from O to S to Se and also carbon in the form of [CMe 2 ] makes for a chemically meaningful derivatization and discussion regarding the heavy atom effect ( Figure 5 ). It is interesting work based on the extension to the molecular curvature that may be present in the excited state structure. One observes an increase in the emission maxima at 534, 642, and 687 nm for the O, S, and Se-containing systems, respectively. The fluorescent quantum yields (\u03a6 F ) too, were found to decrease in values, respectively: 0.35, 0.17, 0.02. The authors had a chance to analyze the bending angle. Also, there was an important solvent viscosity determination [29] . portant regarding the chemical derivatization. It also addresses lipophilic aspects important in derivatization studies. The ability to use RSe-SeR and then incorporate electrochemical techniques, also, was a novel and important dimension to this synthetic paper. While the novel systems were not overtly tested as fluorescent probes, they could certainly be assayed by redox trials and assessed in detail at a later time. It is not convenient to have RSeH pre-prepared and sitting for long times [28] .

Regarding the synthesis of new selenium derivatives, Da Silva et al. successfully designed and synthesized a series of novel benzimidazo[1,2-a]quinoline derivatives introducing organochalcogens (S, Se) with reasonable yield involving short reaction times. The synthetic method involved transition-metal-free cascade reactions; this includes an intermolecular aromatic nucleophilic substitution (SNAr).

The report by Mafireyi et al. discusses a probe in which the analyte is, in fact, a full protein. A diselenide portion of the molecule is known as the active site; the action of the probe is given in the presence of thioredoxin reductase TrxR1 (e.g., overexpressed in melanoma cancers (skin cancers). This probe is the first of its kind regarding this sensing target. The Se-nucleophile is designed to initiate attack at the carbonyl carbon ( Figure 12 ). In this case, of importance for medicinal studies is that the binding affinity was measured as 15.9 \u00b5M. Imaging using in vitro biological results supported the superiority in analyte detection of the Se-Se-linked derivative over that of the S-S-linked derivative [49] . A report from Madibone et al. involves a BODIPY-based probe. It is functionalized at the meso position with a naphthyl group bearing two selenium groups in the peri positions and joined together with a single Se-Se bond ( Figure 13 ). The design is clever in its simplicity; because of its compactness and the allowance that the two different Se atoms lie naturally asymmetrically, there is more to learn regarding which selenium is contributing how much electronically/sterically in the chemical system, and how many oxygen atoms are found to be possibly connected to the Se-Se unit when redox conditions are altered to different degrees. There is much more to explore with this fascinating system [50] . The report by Mafireyi et al. discusses a probe in which the analyte is, in fact, a full protein.

The by-product of GSH is likely to be the oxidized form GS-SG or GS-E. The probe has a Ph-Se containing motif. The structure is the 1,8-naphthalimide framework.

The molecules were tested with zebra fish larvae. The SNARF-SeSPy was noted for its anti-interfering properties and low cellular toxicity. The SNARF-SeSPy, in particular, was shown to detect SH2 rapidly; the limit of detection was determined as 34 nM [51] . The report by Huang et al. describes nanodots known as Se-CDs; these molecules are selenium-doped by a certain percentage of carbon nanodots. The optical system was studied as a two-photon species. Free radicals such as OH . and O2 . \u2212 were studied under observation of addition of probe and cellular models ( Figure 15 ). Mitochondria were involved; images of Se were obtained, and changes in fluorescence were observed and discussed. Oxidative stress goes to reduced ROS levels based on the implementation of fluorescence detection. The TPP-Se-CDs labelled Hela cells were also treated with an additional probe: MitoTracker Green. This involved a single (1-photon) monitoring MitoSox Red probe (10 \u00b5M); stimulation was enabled with PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate). This probe bears the fluorescence pattern of 540-610 nm, and an excitation at 488 nm [52] . In a paper from Zang et al. endoplasmic reticula were targeted for a chemosensing study. Reversible detection was studied. First, with a \"turn-off\" fluorescence with ClO \u2212 , then a reversible reduction of selenium with GSH was observed ( Figure 16 ). The by-product of GSH is likely to be the oxidized form GS-SG or GS-E. The probe has a Ph-Se containing motif. The structure is the 1,8-naphthalimide framework. The name of the probe is ER-Se and the resulting green fluorescence was quantified. ER red tracker (ER-Tracker Red) was also used. This study also reported the use of HeLa cells [53] .

Due to the so-called \"heavy atom effect\" and photoinduced electron transfer of Se, the probe has a smaller quantum yield than the 1pyrenecarboxylic acid, either in water or acetonitrile ( Figure 17 ). The difference of solvent polarity allows the fluorescence probe to aggregate together in water. Intermolecular \u03c0\u03c0 stacking molecular forces becomes dominant. Therefore, the UV-Vis spectrum becomes red-shifted. From the DLS study that they undertook to better understand the observed aggregation, its existence and dimension was investigated to ascertain that aggregation does occur and that the average size of an aggregate particle is 210 nm. The emission wavelength and fluorescence quantum yield (1-pyrene carboxylic acid as a standard, \u03a6F = 0.11) in water and acetonitrile are 486 nm (\u03a6F = 0.036), and 379 nm (\u03a6F = 0.024), respectively (wavelength of excitation = 340 nm). The mechanism for sensing of Hg 2+ is primarily by chelation-enhanced fluorescence quenching (CHEQ) in which the heavy atom, such as Hg, quenches the fluorescence of the ligand; this is present either in water and acetonitrile in a 1:1 complex form. However, in water, the chelation of Hg 2+ to the fluorescence probe is preceded by the breaking up (dispersion) of the aggregate. Upon interference with other soluble metal ions, the fluorescence probe has a remarkable selectivity towards Hg 2+ as indicated by a very low fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence probe is also sensitive. The LOD and LOQ in acetonitrile are as low as 2 \u00b5mol L \u22121 and 4 \u00b5mol L \u22121 ; while in water, the LOD and LOQ are 0.1 \u00b5mol L \u22121 and 0.17 \u00b5mol L \u22121 , respectively.

When S 2\u2212 and CN \u2212 are added, the 281 nm and 324 nm absorption wavelengths are lost; a new absorption wavelength at 353 nm is formed. Although it is not soluble in water, alternatively, they formed L by loading modified mesoporous nanosilica with trimethylsilyl as a hydrophobic outer side and PEG as a hydrophobic inner side.

Gao et al. designed a near-infrared (NIR) chemosensor based on an azo-BODIPY and diphenylselenol (BD-di-SeH) system for the detection of sulfane sulfur under hypoxic conditions. Sulfane sulfur is one of the members of the class of reactive sulfur species (RSS) ( Figure 19 ); this class is receiving more research attention and publicity nowadays due to continued (and revitalized) research into any/all reactive and radical type species in biology. Sulfane sulfur (R-S-S-) is thought to be able to guard against cell apoptosis by reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced when the cell is under hypoxic conditions. Sulfane sulfur (R-S-S-) is suspected as the possible \"true signaler\" as compared to molecular H2S because of its propensity for reactivity. The mechanism of detection is \"turn-on\" fluorescence. Due to the heavy-atom effect by selenium, the fluorescence of the probe is quenched. But, when there is sulfane sulfur, the reactive intermediate BD-DiSeSH is formed; then, intramolecular cyclization occurs, thus allowing for the formation of azo-BODIPY. The quantum yield of BD-DiSeH in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and 20% fetal bovine serum was found to be 0.002 in which the absorption peak changes from 702 to 707 nm upon addition of Na2S4; fluorescence emission was found to be centered at 737 nm. BD-DiSeH works optimally at pH 7.4 and has an extraordinary selectivity towards sulfane sulfur in the existence of even high concentrations of other RSS. BD-DiSeH also has good photostability. In terms of toxicity, the MTT assay shows that BD-DiSeH can maintain 85% cell viability of A549 cells after they were incubated with 10 \u00b5M BD-DiSeH and 90% viability after they were incubated for 24 h with 5 \u00b5M BD-DiSeH. Therefore, the BD-DiSeH has low toxicity. BD-DiSeH can help detect various forms of sulfane sulfur, both exogenously and endogenously, in various cells such as A549, SH-SY5Y, RAW 254.7, Hela, HEK 293, HepG2, and SMMC7721. BD-DiSeH can also be used to observe the dynamics of sulfane sulfur concentration in hypoxic stress. Moreover, the fluorescence that BD-DiSeH demonstrated is also in line with the degree of hypoxic stress from the cell.

The iso-absorption at 450 nm was chosen as the excitation wavelength for further study. With 5.0 equiv of HClO, the fluorescence increase was found to be 241-fold; the LOD for Coum-Se is 4.6 nM. Coum-Se reacts with HClO rapidly and obtained saturation in 5 s. Also, it is selective in the presence of common ROS, RNS and metal ions. The working pH range of Coum-Se for detecting HClO is 7-10. Furthermore, it is known that Coum-NIR also has stable fluorescence after it is incubated with other ROS and nucleophiles. From the use of an MTT assay, it is known that Coum-Se has low toxicity; the IC50 value was determined to be 155 \u00b5M. The in vitro study of Coum-Se is also evaluated in RAW264.7 cells at various concentrations; an HClO stimulator such as lipopolysaccharide and phorbol myristate acetate, and an inhibitor such as 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide were used. An in vivo study was conducted on mouse liver with the condition of acute hepatitis. All of the outputted fluorescence results are in line with the fluorescence characteristics of Coum-Se and Coum-NIR.

Kim et al. synthesized a novel Se-containing probe; the authors observed a notable \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction on 5-bromo-p-2-(phenylselanyl)-thiophene-substituted BOD-IPY upon oxidation of Se to Se=O in the solid state; the oxidation is thought to enforce \u03c0\u03c0 stacking; therefore, a hindered rotation results (clamshell form) (see papers by J. Kuret laboratory, Ohio State University [58] ) and afford a change in the spectroscopic signals owing to the strongly-enforced symmetry (diamagnetic shifting) ( Figure 21 ). The \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction changes the geometrical symmetry from CS to C1 with the -Se(O)-Ph plane and the BODIPY dihedral angle are nearly parallel with one another (dihedral angle 7.9\u00b0) [59] .

The interesting silsesquioxane-based compound was prepared and studied by Liu et al.; the probe is termed POSS-Se. It is oligomeric and polyhedral. It gives it a roughly spherical symmetry with arms extending out, evenly and equally, from all corners of the cluster. Symmetry and \"roundness\" aside, its goal is to allow for optical detection of the mercuric ion (Hg 2+ ) ( Figure 24 ). The conversion of each imidazole to its selenone derivatives is an interesting aspect of this research. Regarding characterization, a peak at 1678 cm \u22121 is present and assigned as a new C=S group. The limit of detection was found to be 8.5 ppb [62] . Another impactful paper by Ishii et al. involving the topic of selenium as analyte involves H2S detection. The partitioning between R2Se(O) and R2Se is also addressed.

Experimental outcomes show, DbbSeO and MbbSeO were swiftly chemically reduced to their corresponding divalent selenium version (CH 3 CN/PBS at pH 7.4) to help produce the strongly fluorescent selenide derivatives DbbSe and MbbSe, which are indirect response to analyte concentration. In comparison with other interfering biothiols such as L-cysteine (Cys) and reduced glutathione (GSH), these selenoxide analogs exhibited extreme selectivity towards H 2 S. In contrast, NaOCl quenches DbbSe's strong fluorescence quickly and selectively by oxidation to afford the corresponding DbbSeO. The results obtained were subject to comparison to other oxidant interferents studied such as H 2 O 2 , t-BuOOH, and ONOO \u2212 ; HOCl reveals excellent selectivity. In conclusion, DbbSe and DbbSeO are able to detect H 2 S and HOCl in a single system reversibly [64] .",

In comparison with other interfering biothiols such as L-cysteine (Cys) and reduced glutathione (GSH), these selenoxide analogs exhibited extreme selectivity towards H2S. In contrast, NaOCl quenches DbbSe's strong fluorescence quickly and selectively by oxidation to afford the corresponding DbbSeO. The results obtained were subject to comparison to other oxidant interferents studied such as H2O2, t-BuOOH, and ONOO \u2212 ; HOCl reveals excellent selectivity.

In this study, step by step, the investigation reveals that reduction of cyclic disulfides/diselenides by the enzyme of the ultrafast TRFS probe shows specificity along with fast responses to thioredoxin reductase ( Figure 26 ).

A tellurium containing probe was studied and reported by Soares-Paulino et al.; this molecule is emissive; while perhaps not surprising, based on previous literature, the Hg 2+ involvement is important from a health and environmental perspective. The changes in fluorescence represents chemical changes in the probe relating to the chalcogenide nature and heteroatom position ( Figure 29 ). When in the presence of Hg 2+ , there is a distinct interaction signaled by a strong color change. The emission exists at 582 nm. It is proposed that the Te center is directly chemically oxidized by Hg 2+ (as opposed to electrochemical oxidation). The presence of potential interference in the form of oxidant species such as H 2 O 2 , \u2212 OCl, \u2212 ONOO, KO 2 , as well as NO 2 \u2212 were tested, reported, and discussed [68] . A report by Tian et al. involved the preparation of a novel selenadiazole derivative by a one-pot reaction. This molecule was not only able to produce three new kinds of fluorescent compounds (wavelength of emission for Hcy, Cys and GSH are 596 nm, 605 nm and 585 respectively), but also exhibit different fluorescence emissions for discriminating each biothiol ( Figure 30 ). The cleavage of the Se-N bond in the probe is a common mechanism of reaction with biothiols; however, only Cys can produce a final product, DAAQ, through Se-N double bond cleavage. The probe goes through a one-step Se-N bond cleavage when Hcy or GSH undergoes reaction with the probe; the intermediates are more favorable for formation than DAAQ. Also, they obtained fluorescence imaging of the probe for the detection of GSH in living cells, which indicates that the probe can be used as a potential tool for distinguishing biothiols [69] . The report by Mulay et al. involved synthesis of a fluorescent probe including a selenium-containing unit used to distinguish GSH or Cys/Hcy in living systems. The -SePh group was incorporated as the responsive, reactive unit; the ester group was introduced to increase water solubility. If the probe reacts with Cys or Hcy, the amine group of the A report by Tian et al. involved the preparation of a novel selenadiazole derivative by a one-pot reaction.

The -SePh group was incorporated as the responsive, reactive unit; the ester group was introduced to increase water solubility. If the probe reacts with Cys or Hcy, the amine group of the biothiols would replace the position of -SePh ( Figure 31 ). Additionally, biothiols can undergo a secondary connection to the proximal -CHO group through intramolecular cyclization; the probe shows green fluorescence. In the case of detecting GSH, a proximal -CHO group in the system helped harvest the pendant amino group of the selfsame bound glutathione in which the -S terminus is found to displace the SePh group from the coumarin system; imine formation is confirmed by NMR data. The probe exhibited red fluorescence [70] .",

The wavelength of the absorption, wavelength of emission, and quantum yield are 396 nm, 512 nm, and \u03a6F = 0.032, respectively; after addition of 10 equiv of \u2212 OCl, these values are 416 nm, 523 nm and \u03a6F = 0.37 (10 mM PBS, pH 7.4).

Kim et al. in developed a fluorescent probe for the selective imaging of HOCl, BDPP-DSe, based on dipyrazolopyridine (DPP) that has been utilized as a material for blue light-emitting diodes. The probe has a molecular design in which two fluorophores are linked by a diselenide bridge ( Figure 33 ). This strategy achieved high selectivity and sensitivity for HOCl because, as discussed elsewhere, herein electron-rich Se centers are oxidizable by HOCl. This can thus lead to dramatic fluorescence changes. BDPP-DSe exhibited strong blue emission responses for NaOCl at 436 nm (\u03bb ex = 331 nm); the other ROS tested did not show any fluorescence changes to the probe. The oxidation of diselenide in the reaction of the probe with NaOCl was confirmed by 1 H and 77 Se NMR spectroscopy. Therefore, the \"turn-on\" response can be attributed to the quenching of the photoinduced electron transfer mechanism (PET) that existed between a phenyl selenide and BDPP group. Moreover, they demonstrated that the probe can detect hypochlorite in living cells and exhibits cell membrane permeability; cytotoxicity was also assessed [72] .

Two moieties were introduced to the probe with a different purpose; bis(2-hydroxyethyl) diselenide can be readily reduced by Cys-SSH due to its stronger nucleophilicity than that of other biothiols ( Figure 34 ); this moiety, therefore, promotes the selectivity of the probe towards Cys-SSH; the terminal galactose residue can allow the probe to target the liver. Cy-DiSe exhibited a ratio fluorescence response to Cys-SSH. After the reaction of the probe with Cys-SSH, the maximum absorption wavelength changed from 790 nm to 614 nm. Cys-SSH triggered the ICT process; the probe showed a spectral blue shift. The maximum emission wavelength underwent a distinct shift from 797 nm (\u03a6 = 0.05) to 749 nm (\u03a6 = 0.11). The fluorescence intensity ratio (F749 nm/F797 nm) has a linear relationship with Cys-SSH under those concentrations measured; this indicates that the probe can be used for both quantitative and qualitative ratiometric detection of Cys-SSH. In the analyte selectivity test, the Cy-DiSe showed selective fluorescence responses to Cys-SSH when tested against other species. The probe signaling could elude interference from other species because the reactive site in the probe has weaker reactivity towards the diselenide bond, compared to the Cys-SSH system. The concentrations of endogenous Cys-SSH in living cells (HL-7702 cells, HepG2 cells, primary hepatocyte cells) was quantitatively analyzed by the fluorescence intensity ratio. The calculated concentrations of Cys-SSH were close to the results from the flow cytometry analysis and LC-MS/MS; the probe can therefore be effectively utilized in quantification of Cys-SSH in living cells. Moreover, Cy-DiSe could target the liver in vivo because the galactose residue of the probe was selectively accepted by asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) (asialoglycoproteins are glycoproteins in which sialic residues are removed).

Probes SC1 and SC2 have good analyte binding reversibility when they undergo reaction with Na2S and can be used to detect Ag + in naturally obtained water samples [74] . The mechanism of the fluorescence occurs through ICT. When DNA is added, electrostatic interactions between cationic PA5 and anionic phosphate moieties of DNA occurs, hindering the intramolecular rotation in the excited state. Therefore, ICT occurs and the fluorescence of PA5 increases. This is confirmed by DFT and circular dichroism experiments carried out using Herring sperm DNA. Nevertheless, this interaction does not change the conformation of DNA. Viscosity, pH, and ionic strength also affect fluorescence of PA5. In high viscosity, the molecules of PA5 become more rigid; therefore, the fluorescence increases due to limitations in intramolecular rotation. pH and ionic strength can interfere with electrostatic interactions. In high pH and ionic strength, electrostatic interactions become weak due to electronic neutralization. The association constant of PA5 is 7.4 \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 , whereas its LOD is 0.48 \u00b5M. PA5 is also more selective towards DNA than to RNA or proteins. Moreover, PA5 has the least spillage from nucleus to cytoplasm, the least cytotoxicity (96% cell viability) and phototoxicity (>94% cell viability after 6 h exposure), and has the highest photostability either in fixed or live cells (t1/2 in solution = 77 min, 30% in fixed cells and 52% in live cell samples; optical loss within 20 min and 10 min irradiation, respectively) [75] .

With fluorescein as an external standard, the quantum yield for Probes 1 and 2 are 0.05 and 0.01. When NaOCl is added, the quantum yield increases for both products; they were reported as \u03a6F = 0.41 and 0.57, respectively, for Probes 1 and 2 ( Figure 37 ). From these results, we can observe the heavy atom effect of Cl and start to determine how Cl helps \"suppress\" the fluorescence of probe 2. From a titration with \u2212 OCl, it is known that Probe 1 and Probe 2 possesses an LOD of 30.9 nM and 4.5 nM, respectively. Both Probe 1 and 2 work optimally under acidic and physiological pH when they are used to detect \u2212 OCl. The photomechanism at play for both Probe 1 and 2 is photoinduced electron transfers. Cell viability is tested using Probe 2 and WST-1 cells. Probe 2 has low cytotoxicity. The performance of both Probes 1 and 2 are evaluated using both MCF-7 and RAW264.7 cells. The incubated cells with \u2212 OCl and H2O2 to induce other ROS show stronger fluorescence.

Also, a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation moiety is introduced to the probe as a mitochondrion-targeting unit. Since the selenol group (-SeH) holds good electrophilicity, it can play a role as a strong sulfur-acceptor. If the sulfur atom in the sulfane sulfur reacts with -SeH, it would form a -Se-SH adduct and then go through a spontaneous intramolecular cyclization to free the cleavable group from the fluorophore. The probe was demonstrated to detect sulfane sulfur in mitochondria of smooth-muscle cells. It is used for evaluating the biological effects of sulfane sulfur on helping removing excess ROS concentration under hypoxic stress (hypoxia).

Gao et al. reported a novel fluorescent probe, Mito-SeH, to help detect sulfane sulfur in mitochondria [78] . The probe is based on the NIR fluorophore azo-BODIPY, including a 2-hydroselenobenzoate moiety, to allow for responses with sulfane sulfur (Figure 40 ). Also, a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation moiety is introduced to the probe as a mitochondrion-targeting unit. Since the selenol group (-SeH) holds good electrophilicity, it can play a role as a strong sulfur-acceptor. If the sulfur atom in the sulfane sulfur reacts with -SeH, it would form a -Se-SH adduct and then go through a spontaneous intramolecular cyclization to free the cleavable group from the fluorophore. The probe was demonstrated to detect sulfane sulfur in mitochondria of smooth-muscle cells. It is used for evaluating the biological effects of sulfane sulfur on helping removing excess ROS concentration under hypoxic stress (hypoxia). Finally, the authors could reveal that the sulfane sulfur can protect cells from oxidative stress by inhibiting caspase-dependent apoptosis through scavenging ROS in mitochondria [78] .

However, naturally there are also many reports which we do not describe, but to which we simply refer. See for example references [80] , [81] , [82] , [83] , [84] , [85] , [86] , [87] , [88] . Devi et al. designed carbon quantum dots (CQDs) (Figure 42 ) from pyrolysis of citric acid with a nitrogen-rich supramolecular ligand (SL) to detect the extremely toxic selenite species (SeO3 2\u2212 ) reference. CQDs are esterified with methyl ester, followed by reaction with a Schiff base synthesized from 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde and hydrazine hydrate to form CQDs-SL. The size of CQDs is around 4-5 nm whereas the quantum yield for CQDs is around 32% (standard = quinine sulfate). The maximum fluorescence intensity emission is around 500 nm (excitation wavelength = 420 nm). When reacting with SeO3 2\u2212 , CQDs-SL fluorescence is quenched due to vibrational states that caused non-radiative recombination. With addition of 1000 ppb of SeO3 2\u2212 , an 85-fold fluorescence decrease is observed. Also, the formation of a strong Se-N bond enhances the selectivity of CQDs-SL toward reaction with SeO3 \u2212 when compared to the other ions. The LOD and LOQ, respectively, are 0.10 and 0.003 ppb. CQDs-SL works optimally at pH \u2265 7.00 and can be applied to analyze SeO3 2\u2212 in real water samples with a recovery percentage of 64-116% [89] . (Figure 43 ) by undergoing reaction with rhodamine 6G with diethylenetriamine for detecting SeO3 2\u2212 in Hela cells. Green fluorescence (around 550 nm) was gradually observed in incubated HeLa cells with SeO3 2\u2212 and 2 \u00b5M ABDO for 210 min; this indicates that the ABDO can be used to detect SeO3 2\u2212 in cells. With addition of SeO3 2\u2212 , the spirolactam structure changed to a conjugated ABDO-Se form. Furthermore, they also compare ABDO-Se with mitochondrial dye, Janus Green B and found that the ABDSO-Se can also be used to image the analyte in the mitochondria as well [81] .

Xin et al. reported a practical ESIPT-based probe with a special covalently attached group of the form 2-(iodomethyl)benzoate. The probe HBT-Se was tested; the leaving group was designed to be selenolactone. The fluorescence emission maximum is at approximately 470 nm ( Figure 44 ). It has a leaving group that allows for a simple ESIPT mechanism regarding the molecule that remains. The trials were used from a 0-120 \u00b5M titration. A reasonably clean isosbestic point was obtained at 317 nm. Importantly, from a practical purpose, filter papers loaded with the probe were tested and the change in color when irradiated with 365 nm irradiation was reported [81] . group was designed to be selenolactone.

Gold nanoparticles were used; the size of the nanoparticles was 10 nm; the emission wavelength was 692 nm. Importantly, the selenocysteine detected was both endogenous as well as exogenous in nature. The LOD was determined to be 9.5 nM. The matrixes that the authors discuss refer to wider commercial purposes of foodstuffs and materials; the authors made and reported initial determinations in tea and rice [90] . Hu et al. designed a NIR fluorescence probe based on a 13 nm diameter gold nanoparticle for detecting selenol; most importantly, selenocysteine was determined in HepG2 cells. They utilize the more stable Au-Se bond to release the thiol-peptide-Cy5.5 in which gold quenches the fluorescence of Cy5.5 through a FRET mechanism ( Figure 46 ). The excitation maximum and emission maximum of the probe are 660 and 690 nm, respectively. One nanoparticle brings about 162 \u00b1 1 thiol-peptide-Cy5.5. In PBS buffer (0.01 M, pH 7.4, 37 \u00b0C), the fluorescence probe undergoes reaction with selenocysteine in 10 min. Moreover, the probe works optimally in a pH of 6.3-8.0. The LOD of the probe for selenocysteine is as low as 0.38 nM. The probe also exhibits selectivity towards selenocysteine in the presence of amino acids (see reference), vitamin C, thiols, and ROS; even other selenocompounds such as (CysSe)2, Na2SeO3 and TrxR were tested and determined to not give significant fluorescence intensity enhancement.

Through the MTT assay, the incubation of HepG 2 with a 1.0 nM probe for 24 h still affords high cell viability of the cell; this means that the probe has low cellular toxicity under the conditions tested. In the application of the probe towards HepG 2 , probes are resistant to photobleaching. The fluorescence intensity reaches a saturation point within 2 h. Also, the lower temperature allows the intracellular fluorescence intensity to decrease. This indicates that the cellular uptake involves an active process. Study with various endocytic inhibitors shows that the mechanism of cellular uptake is via endocytosis with the help from clathrin and caveolae. The probe can be used well to monitor selenol exogenously and endogenously in HepG 2 under hypoxic conditions. The observation with the probe shows a relationship of high selenol concentration to cell apoptosis on tumor-bearing mice [91] .",

The material involves BPST and a chain molecule DSPE-PEG. Two absorption bands centered at 347 and 711 nm were identified. From their experiments, only the 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl derivative ( NO2 L) gives satisfying results for the detection of free selenocysteine. Interestingly, the 2, 4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl ( 2NO2 L) and the pentafluorobenzenesulfonyl derivative ( 5F L) shows selective detection for Cys and CN \u2212 , respectively. In PBS buffer (pH = 7.4), NO2 L shows emission enhancement at 550 nm (wavelength of excitation = 360 nm) upon the addition of selenocysteine (up to 210-fold with 10 equiv Selenocysteine). Its fluorescence is stable at a pH of 7-10. Probe NO2 L was found to be selective towards selenocysteine in the presence of cysteine and 20 other amino acids. It is also selective in the presence of other thio and seleno containing compounds, except for benzylselenol that gives a 195-fold fluorescence enhancement. The LOD in PBS buffer (pH = 7.4) is obtained as low as (1.5 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 \u22127 M or 25 \u00b1 2 ppb. The selectivity of NO2 L towards selenocysteine over Cys is also evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry. The \u2206H value for selenocysteine and Cys are -382 kcal mol \u22121 and -45 kcal mol \u22121 . This indicates that the reaction of NO2 L and selenocysteine is thermodynamically more favorable rather than NO2 L and Cys. In fetal serum bovine and coated silica gel strips, NO2 L has also good sensitivity with the LOD and fluorescence enhancement: 5.0 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 10 \u22127 M or 80 \u00b1 5 ppb and 175 \u00b1 15 fold; 10 \u00b1 1 \u00b5M or 168 \u00b1 16 ppb and 75 \u00b1 5 fold (540 nm), respectively. With these results in hand, it is demonstrated that NO2 L is suitable for the biological environment and can be used practically in the form of silica gel strips for selenocysteine sampling. Furthermore, NO2 L performance has also evaluated in HepG2 cells. NO2 L can be endogenously imaged (induced by Na 2 SeO 3 ) and exogenously selenocysteine with good permeability and cell viability [92] .

Selenocysteine is a bioselenium compound found in the human body. Although it is found in small concentrations [~70 \u00b5g/L], its role is extremely important, especially when it is related with diseases and pathological conditions. Therefore, it is demanded of scientists for them to develop appropriate biosensors for selenocysteine. Unfortunately, the diminutive concentrations of selenocysteine and the presence of other biothiols that exist in higher concentrations, and their eager reactivity, makes this molecular detection task a challenging one. Li et al. [93] synthesized probe 1, a fluorescence probe based on dicyanomethylene-benzopyran and 2,4-dinitrophenyl-ether that bears a near-infrared (NIR) emission and large Stokes' shift ( Figure 49 ). Thus, it is more biocompatible and has lower background fluorescence. When 10 \u00b5M of probe 1 is incubated with 100 \u00b5M selenocysteine in DMS-PBS buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4 1:1 (v/v), the emission band is found to become recentered from 430 nm to 560 nm; the 25-fold increase of fluorescence emission at 706 nm is observed after testing at 5 min. Kinetically, probe 1 is undergoing reaction rapidly with selenocysteine with a kobs = 0.58 min \u22121 .

In addition, the probe is also stable at various pH values from 4-9; the fluorescence can be observed well at pH 6-9. Based on the experiment, the limit of detection from the probe is 62 nM. The selectivity of the probe is also evaluated with other biothiols, several potassium and sodium salts, metal ions and various amino acids. Probe 1 shows good selectivity and can differentiate selenocysteine despite the presence of these possible interferents. For biological environments, probe 1 is also tested in fetal bovine serum (FBS) model solution and also in HeLa cells. Over several measured times, probe 1 does not show fluorescence, whether beginning in either fetal bovine serum (FBS) or HeLa cells. But, after FBS is (i) spiked with 100 \u00b5M selenocysteine, and (ii) the HeLa cells are incubated with 5 \u00b5M (Sec) 2 , fluorescence can be observed. In addition, fluorescence is also observed when a selenocysteine-inducer like Na 2 SeO 3 , Se 2 O or dibenzyl diselenide is added to the HeLa cell. These results show that the probe is inert to the other biothiols and can be used to detect exogenous and endogenous selenocysteine. For comparison with other probes, Rhodamine B and naphthofluorescein were selected and used. While Rhodamine B possesses similar emission wavelength, and naphthofluorescein has an emission in the NIR, in terms of background fluorescence, probe 1 shows better performance than both of them [93] .",

The two probes are constructed via incorporating 2,4-dinitrobenzoxy, a fluorescence quenching moiety, into the B-BODIPY system. Accordingly, the probes show a broad absorption range from red to NIR while they exhibit no fluorescence for Sel-p1 with two 2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNB) groups and weak fluorescence for Sel-p2 with one DNB. However, the probes emitted strong fluorescence at 663 nm (\u03bb ex = 650 nm) for Sel-p1 and 655 nm (\u03bb ex = 650 nm) for Sel-p2 when (Sec) 2 and dithiothreitol (DTT) were added to the phosphate buffer-DMSO (v/v, 1:1) solution mixture (pH 7.4) in which the probe is present. In the selectivity test of Sel-p2 toward selenocysteine, the probe exhibited a bright red fluorescence for selenocysteine and benzylselenol; for thiophenol, a weak fluorescence was observed. The proposed detection mechanism of Sel-p2 toward selenocysteine was further confirmed as S N Ar reaction by means of 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Since the pKa value of the selenol group in selenocysteine is lower than that of biothiols, selenols exist in their selenolate forms (RSe\u2212) under physiological conditions; thiols however exist in their neutral form (RSH). Selenolate is a stronger nucleophile than the thiolate or thiol, and therefore acts to release fluorescent BODIPY-OH via a S N Ar mediated reaction; therefore, such a probe has a naturally higher selectivity for selenols over thiols. Moreover, they achieved imaging of selenocysteine with Sel-p2 in living cells and mouse model studies.

The high selectivity of the probe may be achieved by the specific cleavage of Se-N bond in the BS group by H 2 Se through nucleophilic addition. In the kinetics experiment, the rapid response of the probe for H 2 Se was identified. Also, the probe showed low cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells via the MTT assay. Moreover, they observed that for Na 2 SeO 3 , the H 2 Se precursor, induced the increase of endogenous H 2 Se in the hypoxic environment, whereas H 2 O 2 did not increase under the same conditions. This can indicate that sodium selenite induces apoptosis of tumor cells via H 2 Se metabolism, not via oxidative-stress. Subsequently, they successfully obtained in vivo fluorescence images of H22 tumor-bearing mice injected with Na 2 SeO 3 and the fluorescent molecular probe under study. These findings imply that the probe can provide a powerful tool for investigating the biological functions of H 2 Se and the anticancer mechanisms of Se [98] .",

They found that using acetonitrile as a solvent decreases fluorescence emission intensity the most (among other common organic solvents studied herein). Therefore, using the probe as a solvent would be beneficial to Se(IV) determinations. They used acetonitrile in water and found that a 70% acetonitrile ratio gives the highest fluorescence intensity for GAT ( Figure 56 ); but the fluorescence characteristics of the GAT-Se(IV) solution do not obviously change from changing the volume ratio. Accordingly, the authors chose an acetonitrile volume ratio of 70%. Regarding the presence of [H + ] and the situation with obtaining measurements at variable pH, GAT and GAT-Se(IV) solutions display a small change in fluorescence over a pH range of 2.3-10.3; but, fluorescence intensity reaches a maximum at pH 7.3. Accordingly, they used a 0.05 mol L \u22121 Tris-HCl solution with pH = 7.3 for convenience in measurement. After analyzing the effect of the reaction time and interference of common ions, they concluded that GAT is highly sensitive towards Se(IV); it could instantaneously give a response as it undergoes reaction with Se(IV) rapidly.

The research group of Zhang developed a fluorescent probe, O-hNRSel, for selenocysteine detection (Figure 57 ). The probe is based on a tetralin-xanthene fused dye; 2,4dinitrobenzenesulfonate (DNP) is exploited to quench the fluorescence and detect selenocysteine. Due to quenching of the fluorescence by DNP, O-hNRSel showed almost no fluorescence; however, the intensity of fluorescence of the probe dramatically increased with the selective detection of selenocysteine. Furthermore, authors successfully used the probe for fluorescent imaging of selenocysteine in living cells with excellent biocompatibility [100] . Luan et al. reported BPP, a simple organic system based on biphenyl in which a S=N bond can be formed and cleaved. The so-called sulfilimine bond known in biology is invoked, discussed and tested ( Figure 58 ). H2Se is able to regulate the \"status\" of this bond, as well as HOBr; the system is observed having a fast response to H2Se. SBPP was used as a model system to help examine the effects seen on stressors imposed on this S=N bond for better understanding of its existence, reactivity and targetability in biological systems. The interest in selectively breaking the reversible covalent (double) bond specifically is important and has an analogy to that of the imine bond. This is a simple yet impressive advance in redox probing in the chemosensing field. An optical change of 480 \u2192 525 nm was determined [101] .

            "text": "Due to the high nitrogen content and rich potential host-guest chemistry and derivatization chemistry of melamine, it is used frequently in industry. There are many cases of the misuse of melamine, however, as a dietary additive such as in milk, to help increase the apparent level of \"protein\" content. Singh et al. designed a mercapto-propionic acid-capped cadmium selenide quantum dot (m-CdSe) to help detect melamine in analytical samples (of milk, for example). From TEM analysis, the particle size of m-CdSe is around 3-5 nm, whereas the crystal is around 0.5 nm in diameter as determined by XRD ( Figure 66 ). The band gap of m-CdSe is 2.7 eV; its absorption peak is at 400 nm. m-CdSe shows a fluorescence emission at 532 nm when it is irradiated at 360 nm (\u03bb exci ). Through a zeta potential study, it is known that the charge of m-CdSe is \u221227.2 mV, whereas that for melamine is 14.9 mV. When the two species physically interact, the zeta potential of m-CdSe decreases to \u221210.10 mV. The decreasing in zeta potential shows that m-CdSe and melamine which possesses opposite charge forms a complex. Hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions are quenching m-CdSe fluorescence due to the change in its surface state. m-CdSe reacts rapidly with melamine. This binding is indicated by the fact that the incubation time is not affecting the fluorescence emission of the m-CdSe fluorophore. Through a pH study, it is known that m-CdSe optimally works at pH 7.0. For selectivity, m-CdSe fluorescence is also evaluated with the presence of interference with cysteine, glycine, sucrose, tyrosine, BSA, Na 3 AsO 4 and Pb(NO 3 ) 2 . The fluorescence does not undergo a significant change when these possible interferents are present. Evaluation in real milk samples was also conducted and m-CdSe can detect melamine satisfactorily [110] . Figure 67 ). Selenium was selected because it can induce fluorescence emission. The fluorescence appears because of the presence of interstitial oxygens and crystal lattice defects. The quantum yield for the ZnO nanorod doped with selenium is (\u03a6F) 0.15, as calibrated with DAPI as standard (\u03a6F = 0.043) as. The ZnO nanorod doped with selenium that has been functionalized with 3-MPA was studied at various values of pH, temperature, and storage time; its sensitivity and selectivity also are applied to determine Hg 2+ in real water samples. The result is that it works optimally at pH 7.0; this is due to the fact that, under acidic pH, the MPA ligand becomes protonated and released from the ZnO nanorod doped with selenium at its surface. Conversely, in the basic pH region, ZnO nanorods will enable the formation of metal hydroxide groups and Figure 67 ). Selenium was selected because it can induce fluorescence emission.

Conversely, in the basic pH region, ZnO nanorods will enable the formation of metal hydroxide groups and it loses its functionality to detect Hg 2+ . Higher temperatures can also make 3-MPA ligands separate from ZnO nanorods doped with selenium because of the administration of large thermal energy. In storage time, even after 6 months the fluorescence emitting from this probe remains the same; this is telling of the integrity of such materials. Within the addition of Hg 2+ , the 3-MPA that quenches the fluorescence is separated from the surface of the ZnO nanorod doped with selenium. The resulting increase in fluorescence for at least 30 s was followed by the decrease of fluorescence due to the aggregation and instability of a ZnO nanorod doped with selenium. The probe has a noted extraordinary sensitivity involving a LOD of 1 pm; the selectivity for Hg 2+ in the presence of heavy metal ion interferents, even when they are at a high concentration was noteworthy. The probe can also be used to detect Hg 2+ in real samples in which the recovery rate was measured to be between 93-99% [111] . Figure 68 ). They used FAM-labeled \"24 mer\" DNA oligonucleotide as the fluorescence moiety. The fluorescence becomes quenched when this moiety becomes adsorbed to the metal oxide through the phosphate backbone. However, after selenite and selenate are added, displace the fluorescent DNA on the surface of the metal oxides is affected. Therefore, the fluorescence can be observed. From this investigation, a strong recovery of fluorescence is formed when selenite is added, except for the case of ZnO, NiO, CoO and TiO2. While, there is no significant recovery of fluorescence of/by the fluorophore when in the presence of selenite for all of the metal oxides. From an inspection of the zeta potential, it is observed that the surfaces of all metal oxides become more negative when either selenite or selenate are added. Either in media that is too much acidic (pH = 3.0) or much basic (pH =9.0), Fe3O4 can become too positively or too negatively charged. Due to excessively strong and excessively weak interactions with DNA initially present, the fluorescence recovery becomes low in both cases. With the same analogue, the Fe3O4-DNA probe also works optimally at low ionic strength (0.20 M NaCl). For analyte chemosensor applications, Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 Figure 68 ).

With the same analogue, the Fe 3 O 4 -DNA probe also works optimally at low ionic strength (0.20 M NaCl). For analyte chemosensor applications, Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 2 O 3 are chosen due to their magnetic properties, whereas CeO 2 is chosen due to its heightened fluorescence enhancement, compared to other metal oxides. The FAM-labeled C 15 is used. In the case of Fe 3 O 4 , when selenite is added, fluorescence enhancement is observed as much as 10-fold until it becomes saturated at about a concentration of 200 \u00b5M. From the study, it is known that the K d is 143 \u00b5M; the LOD was measured as 2.0 \u00b5M. The same inclination was also observed in Fe 2 O 3, whereas the LOD is 3.0 \u00b5M. CeO 2 shows a stronger fluorescence intensity, up to 40.8 fluorescence units (\u00b5M \u22121 ), compared to 5.5 and 3.3 fluorescence units (\u00b5M \u22121 ) found for Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 2 O 3 . In the case of selenite, the response is not significant in Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ; even for CeO 2 , the response has a value of zero. Although the selectivity for selenium salts is competing with arsenic salts and phosphates, arsenite interestingly shows lower fluorescence than selenite does when all conditions are kept the same. Therefore, to overcome this problem, arsenate interference can be reduced first to arsenite to allow the sensor to have less interference from arsenate and to enable more selectivity for selenite. The selectivity can, therefore, be resolved by using this clever strategy [12] . arsenite to allow the sensor to have less interference from arsenate and to enable more selectivity for selenite.

In this case, the resorufin production from amplex red was determined. The perspective was to consider which atomic centers, in terms of the formal oxidation state were effective in displacing the buffer: N(III), P(I), P(V), As(V), S(VI), Se(IV) Se(VI); As(III) however, was slightly active in catalyst poisoning [141] .",

Experimentally, it is observed that there were no negative side effects of CdSe/ZnS-QDs on cell viability. In comparison with non-treated cells, however, CdSe/ZnS-QDs (conc = 10 g mL \u22121 ) exhibited more sensitivity in cell wall-compromised cell study.

Even though they are widely employed for PA imaging and phototherapy, their systematic release of copper ions and its relative effects e.g., in biological systems are still not articulated well, either by in vivo or in vitro studies. Han et al. rationally designed and introduced a Cu 2+ responsive near-infrared (NIR) probe named NCM. In this material, ultrasmall copper selenide nanoparticles served as a platform for this NCM probe in making the detection of the released copper ions efficiency. This released copper ion is able to undergo reaction with non-fluorescent NCM, in particular, and converts into NCM-1; signaling involves a very strong NIR fluorescence band at 735 nm. Considering the advantages of analyte specificity. They obtained in hand, further studies were carried out to count the release of copper ions from poly-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-functionalized ultrasmall Cu 2\u2212x Se NPs in cells and living animal models; experimental outcomes reveal its features as being biodegradable and biocompatible with no major side effects found on the living tissue (mouse organs) used for confirmation when copper ion is released. RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell studies demonstrated that copper ions from Cu 2\u2212x Se NPs are released quickly. Interestingly, further investigations reveal that ultrasmall Cu 2\u2212x Se NPs were allowed to be easily removed within 72 h after intravenous injection through feces and urine of animal body; no other harmful side effects were identified after the release of copper ion. These investigations give additional support to efficient applications of copper-based chalcogenide nanoparticles in medicine and nanomedicine [148] .",

The breakthrough of hydrogen selenide occurred the fastest when Pd/Al 2 O 3 was implemented; determined at around 40 min and in the Pd/B/Al 2 O 3 material at around 120 min, that while no \"breakthrough\" appeared for Pd/Al 2 O 3 . It has been reported that no \"breakthrough\" appears within 3 h without the presence of H 2 S. Therefore, as the results suggest, H 2 S causes sulfur poisoning and reduces the sorbent's ability to, in turn, capture hydrogen selenide. Furthermore, SEM backscattered-electron imaging displayed that the Pd particles on Pd/Al 2 O 3 happened to be the smallest and most well-distributed. Because sulfur tolerance has an inverse relationship to the size of the particles, Pd/Al 2 O 3 is expected to have the best resistance to H 2 S poisoning. Such results confirm no \"breakthrough\" of hydrogen selenide within this experimental time-frame [150] .",

It was prepared by microwaving cellulose mounted on tissue paper which was passivated with ethylenediamine (EDA or en). The average size of the CD was 4.2 nm, whereas the absorption and emission are located at 335 and 490 nm respectively (excitation wavelength = 400 nm). From this investigation, it was found that the addition of GSH quenches the CD fluorescence through the chemical action of the amine as a Lewis base which is replaced with thiol as a Lewis acid on the surface of CDs. This replacement has to do with the electron density of CDs surface and affects its fluorescence. Furthermore, the zeta potential and hydrodynamic volume of GSH-CDs are larger than EDA-CDs indicating that GSH-CDs tend to aggregate. The quantum yield of EDA-CDs compared to fluorescein as a standard is 24%; the intensity of fluorescence is stable, starting from 5 to 18 min with the addition of GSH. The LOD and LOQ of GSH, respectively, are determined to be 1.74 \u00d7 10 \u22129 M and 5.83 \u00d7 10 \u22128 M [153] .",

The materials were irradiated with an 18 kGy dose involving a dose rate of 4.5 kGy h -1 . The optimal ratio of Zn and Se is from 0.5-3.0.

The crystalline core structure of QDs allows us to generate a wide range of fluorescence emission peaks based on particle size. Furthermore, the atomic weight is sufficient to yield electron density detectable by electron microscopy. They conducted correlative lightand electron microscopy (CLEM) analysis of immunolabeled ultrathin epoxy sections of human somatostatinoma tumor. Widefield fluorescence light microscopy revealed QD labeling as bright orange fluorescence forming a granular pattern within the tumor cell cytoplasm.

Response within seconds of the analytes was determined; it was designed for long luminescence lifetimes. Additional virtues of such an Ir based are time-resolved and time-resolved phospholuminescence [171] . Figure 75 ). There was a reported 76 times increase in fluorescence at 480 nm; hydrazine-based detection of peroxynitrite was enabled. The reactive group is dimethyl hydrazine group -ONOO-The retention time was observed to move from 7.5 to 6.5 *min in the chromatogram [172] . ",

The literature yielded nearly 200 papers solely from the last 5 years of scientific literature (not patent literature). We had a chance to \"discuss\" examples in which the Se is present in the receptor. The selenium was also shown to be part of the analyte such as H 2 Se. We covered many systems that included in a detachable (cleavable) group in which the Se atom fully bonds, or can be a case in which the RSe detaches from or adds to an SR group in the receptor of the probe, or RSe as an exterior analyte. Various fluorophores and nanosystems were covered. Additionally, we covered recent ROS probes and glutathione probes, to evoke a broader range of ideas and create a broader perspective of recent research work. We hope this can serve as a catalyst for expediting future research. ",

Chinnathambi et al. investigated the biocompatability of magnetic CdSe/ZnS quantum dot micelles with the commonest blood protein (55%) human serum albumin (HSA) (3.5-5.0 g/dL). The researchers synthesized it from DSPE-PEG (2000)-biotin, CdSe/ZnS core quantum dot, Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticle, and phospholipid solution. The biotin is used as the directing agent to the cancer cells due to such cells usually overexpressing biotin receptors such as avidin and streptavidin. CdSe/ZnS is used as the imaging agent. Thus, the cell imaging was facilitated. Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles are used to add magnetic properties to the micelle. The strategy is to destroy the cancer cells with the help of a magnetic field. Phospholipids are used as the structural foundation of the micelle. According to the TEM analysis, it is shown that the size of coencapsulated CdSe/ZnS and Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles are around 50 nm-70 nm. While the diameter of the micelle itself is around 117-265 nm with a variation ratio of CdSe/ZnS and Fe 3 O 4 . The fluorescence emission wavelength of CdSe/ZnS in the micelle is 630 nm.",

Through further studies, no noteworthy changes in superoxide were noticed, with or without CdSe/ZnS-QDs treatment. Overall, results through transcriptome analysis indicated the exposure of CdSe/ZnS-QDs within yeast remarkably affected genes associated in multiple cellular processes[143].Selenium as a photothermal therapy was covered in the scientific literature by the report byZhang  et al.
