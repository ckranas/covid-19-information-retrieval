At the time of this communication, the number of confirmed cases continues to rise globally. There are currently no vaccines or effective antiviral drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections or the disease it causes, A prophylactic, RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine provides one of the most flexible and fastest approaches available to immunize against the emerging virus. 4, 5 The development of an RNA-based vaccine encoding a viral antigen, which is then expressed by the vaccine recipient as a protein capable of eliciting protective immune responses, provides significant advantages over more traditional vaccine approaches. Unlike live attenuated vaccines, RNA vaccines do not carry the risks associated with infection and may be given to people who cannot be administered live virus (eg, pregnant women and immunocompromised persons). RNA-based vaccines are manufactured via a cell-free in vitro transcription process, which allows an easy and rapid production and the prospect of producing high numbers of vaccination doses within a shorter time period than achieved with 090177e193424de3\\Approved\\Approved On: 17-Apr-2020 12:10 (GMT) PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Final Protocol, 15 traditional vaccine approaches.

At the time of this communication, the number of confirmed cases continues to rise globally. There are currently no vaccines or effective antiviral drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections or the disease it causes, COVID-19. 3 A prophylactic, RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine provides one of the most flexible and fastest approaches available to immunize against the emerging virus. 4, 5 The development of an RNA-based vaccine encoding a viral antigen, which is then expressed by the vaccine recipient as a protein capable of eliciting protective immune responses, provides significant advantages over more traditional vaccine approaches. Unlike live attenuated vaccines, RNA vaccines do not carry the risks associated with infection and may be given to people who cannot be administered live virus (eg, pregnant women and immunocompromised persons). RNA-based vaccines are manufactured via a cell-free in vitro transcription process, which allows an easy and rapid production and the prospect of producing high numbers of vaccination doses within a shorter time period than achieved with PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001",
