The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The lack of a free-lunch theorem implies the need for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle an array of applications. This unique article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We offer a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts, including operations, economics, finance, energy, environment, and social good. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. The list was compiled based on the expertise and interests of the authors. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of the forecasting theory and practice.",

Other methods, including statistical methods such as Bayesian forecasting and complex regression models, have also benefited from advances in computing.

Many models have been developed to forecast the number of deaths that will be caused by , and combining the forecasts makes sense because it is hard to know which one will be the most accurate.

In that sense, they are useful not only on their own merits, but as part of an ensemble that also includes more sophisticated methods. Combined forecasts are more valuable if the forecasts come from methods that are diverse so that their forecast errors are not highly correlated.",

Frequent exposure to probabilities helps the general public better understand, appreciate, and feel more comfortable with them. And the current situation in the world with COVID-19, increases in huge fires, big storms, political polarisation, international conflicts, etc., should help them realise that we are living in an age with huge uncertainties, and forecasts that quantify these uncertainties can be important. Where possible, visualisation can help, as indicated by the saying that a picture is worth a thousand words.

Instead, among the many options for a forecast of a single time series at a future time period are an expected value (known as a point forecast), a prediction interval, a percentile and an entire prediction distribution. This set of results collectively could be considered to be \"the forecast\". There are numerous other potential outcomes of a forecasting process. The objective may be to forecast an event, such as equipment failure, and time series may play only a small role in the forecasting process. Forecasting procedures are best when they relate to a problem to be solved in practice. The theory can then be developed by understanding the essential features of the problem. In turn, the theoretical results can lead to improved practice.",

A forecasting method is defined here to be a predetermined sequence of steps that produces forecasts at future time periods. Many forecasting methods, but definitely not all, have corresponding stochastic models that produce the same point forecasts and can also be used to generate prediction intervals and prediction distributions. A stochastic model makes assumptions about the process and the associated probability distributions. Even when a forecasting method has an underlying stochastic model, the model is not necessarily unique. For example, the simple exponential smoothing method has multiple stochastic models, including state space models that may or may not be homoscedastic (i.e., possess constant variance). The combining of forecasts from different methods has been shown to be a very successful forecasting method. The combination of the corresponding stochastic models, if they exist, is itself a model. Forecasts can be produced by a process that incorporates new and/or existing forecasting methods/models. Of course, these more complex processes would also be forecasting methods/models.",

Another way of phrasing it is that one needs to decide if the data have a stochastic trend (if yes, then convert to growth rates) or a deterministic trend (stick to levels). Under the null hypothesis of a stochastic trend, the data are non-stationary, meaning that they have no fixed mean nor variance, and hence the test involves non-standard statistical theory (Phillips, 1987) . There is also the possibility to swap the hypotheses and take the levels as the null model (Kwiatkowski et al., 1992; Hobijn et al., 2004) . Non-stationary properties may also follow from structural breaks (Perron, 1989) , so it is reasonable to allow for potential breaks in the tests. The power of unit root tests is not large, and in practice one often finds signals to consider growth rates (Nelson and Plosser, 1982) .

            "text": "The anomaly detection methods in forecasting applications can be categorised into two groups: (i) model-based approaches and (ii) feature-based approaches. Model-based approaches compare the predicted values with the original data. If the deviations are beyond a certain threshold, the corresponding observations are treated as anomalies (Luo et al., 2018b,a; Sobhani et al., 2020) . Contextual anomalies and anomalous sub-sequences are vastly covered by model-based approaches. Limitations in the detectability of anomalous events depend on the input effects of external time series. Examples of such effects are included in SARIMAX models for polynomial approaches. In nonlinear contexts an example is the generalised Bass model (Bass et al., 1994) for special life cycle time series with external control processes. SARMAX with nonlinear perturbed mean trajectory as input variable may help separating the mean process under control effects from anomalies in the residual process. Feature-based approaches, on the other hand, do not rely on predictive models. Instead, they are based on the time series features measured using different statistical operations that differentiate anomalous instances from typical behaviours (Fulcher and Jones, 2014) . Feature-based approaches are commonly used for detecting anomalous time series within a large collection of time series. Under this approach, it first forecasts an anomalous threshold for the systems typical behaviour and new observations are identified as anomalies when they fall outside the bounds of the established anomalous threshold (Talagala et al., , 2020b . Most of the existing algorithms involve a manual anomalous threshold. In contrast, Burridge and Robert Taylor (2006) and Talagala et al. (2020b) use extreme value theory based data-driven anomalous thresholds. Approaches to the problem of anomaly detection for temporal data can also be divided into two main scenarios: (i) batch processing and (ii) data streams. The data stream scenario poses many additional challenges, due to nonstationarity, large volume, high velocity, noisy signals, incomplete events and online support (Luo et al., 2018b; Talagala et al., 2020b) .",

The weights on this linear combination, the number of trend functions and their nature and other aspects on expanding the method have been recently researched extensively.",

Then comes the job of identifying a model to represent the pattern, i.e., fitting the model to the data. The procedure has been the staple of forecasters in many of the methods they used. Sometimes when the pattern is not conspicuous, it becomes a challenge. A wise next step would be exploring the data for any hidden patterns. Box et al. (1976) did one such exploration with regards to time series data. They realised that although there may not be any visible patterns in some data series, a pattern could emerge if they correlated the series with itself, i.e., by finding autocorrelations. As an exemplar for finding an autocorrelation, one can offset the data by one period (i.e., making the series to lag by one period) to get a different series and then find the correlation between these -which results in an autocorrelation of lag 1. If the second series is obtained by offsetting the original series by two periods, then one gets an autocorrelation of lag 2. This process continues for other lags. 10 This subsection was written by Sheik Meeran. Box et al. (1976) made use of this 'autocorrelation phenomenon' and incorporated the same into a self-regressing model, i.e., an autoregressive model, represented by the AR part of ARIMA. They further expanded the idea of extracting hidden patterns by finding a relationship between a data in one period and the error in the previous period, and thus came the Moving Average model, i.e., the MA portion of ARIMA. Curiosity about the name 'Moving Average' is palpable among forecasting enthusiasts. Some think the name is arbitrary while others think the history behind this name is lost. Yet another view is \"each value of y t can be thought of as a weighted moving average of the past few forecasts\" , where y is the forecast variable.",

Estimating future volatility for measuring the uncertainty of forecasts is imperative for probabilistic forecasting. Yet, the right period in which to estimate future volatility has been controversial as volatility based on too long a period will make irrelevant the forecast horizon of our interests, whereas too short a period results in too much noise (Engle, 2004 ). An alternative to this issue is the dynamic volatility estimated through the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) proposed by Engle (1982) , and the generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model proposed by Bollerslev (1987) . The ARCH model uses the weighted average of the past squared forecast error whereas the GARCH model generalises the ARCH model by further adopting past squared conditional volatilities. The GARCH model is the combination of (i) a constant volatility, which estimates the long-run average, (ii) the volatility forecast(s) in the last steps, and (iii) the new information collected in the last steps. The weightings on these components are typically estimated with maximum likelihood. The models assume a residual distribution allowing for producing density forecasts. One of the benefits of the GARCH model is that it can model heteroscedasticity, the volatility clustering characteristics of time series (Mandelbrot, 1963) , a phenomenon common to many time series where uncertainties are predominant. Volatility clustering comes about as new information tends to arrive time clustered and a certain time interval is required for the time series to be stabilised as the new information is initially recognised as a shock.",

A small piece of information can have more impact when the time series is under stress than under a stable time series (Engle, 2004) . Another pattern often observed in the volatility time series is slowly decaying autocorrelation, also known as a long memory pattern, which Baillie et al. (1996) capture using a slow hyperbolic rate of decay for the ARCH terms in the fractionally integrated GARCH (FIGARCH) model. Separately, in a further approach to directly estimating long term volatility, the GARCH-MIDAS (Mixed Data Sampling) model proposed by Engle et al. (2013) decomposes the conditional volatility into the short-term volatility, as captured by the traditional GARCH, and the long-term volatility represented by the realised volatilities.",

While MLR is fast, flexible, and uses exogenous regressors, it does not allow to decompose components and change them over time. Building on the foundation of the regression, Facebook introduced Prophet (Taylor and Letham, 2018) , an automated approach that utilises the Generalised Additive Model (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990 (Taylor, 2003b) . MSARIMA allows for exogenous regressors and terms can evolve over time, however, it is not flexible, and the computational time is high. Svetunkov and Boylan (2020) introduced the Several Seasonalities ARIMA (SSARIMA) model which constructs ARIMA in a state-space form with several seasonalities. While SSARIMA is flexible and allows for exogenous regressors, it is computationally expensive, especially for high frequency series. Taylor (2003b) introduced Double Seasonal Holt-Winters (DSHW) to extend ETS for modelling daily and weekly seasonal cycles. Following that, Taylor (2010) proposed a triple seasonal model to consider the intraday, intraweek and intrayear seasonalities. Gould et al. (2008) and Taylor and Snyder (2012) instead proposed an approach that combines a parsimonious representation of the seasonal states up to a weekly period in an innovation state space model. With these models, components can change, and decomposition is possible. However, the implementation is not flexible, the use of exogenous regressors is not supported, and the computational time could be high.",

Popular choices for G are the logistic function (which gives rise to the LSTAR model) and the exponential function (ESTAR), although additional cumulative distribution functions are also possible.

Functional time series can be classified into two categories depending on if the continuum is also a time variable.

We refer to such data structure as sliced functional time series, examples of which include daily precipitation data (Gromenko et al., 2017) .

ARMA-like and GARCHlike dependences in the tail can be considered as special cases of Li and Kang (2018) . In multivariate time series forecasting, unequal length of data is a common issue. One possible approach is to partition the copula parameters into elements relating only to the marginal distributions and elements only relating to the copula (Patton, 2006b) . For mixed frequency data, it is possible to decompose the copula dependence structure into linear and nonlinear components. Then the high and low frequency data is used to model the linear and nonlinear dependencies, respectively (Oh and Patton, 2016) .

Usually, point predictions are compared using the Diebold and Mariano (1995) and the Clark and West (2006) tests that compare predictions from two competing models The accuracy of the static analysis is based mainly on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). MAE and RMSE are used to provide a relative forecasting evaluation compared to other competitors. Following Clements and Hendry (1998) , Kolasa et al. (2012) apply the standard forecast unbiased test to assess if DSGEs are good forecasters in the absolute sense. The accuracy of the dynamic analysis is based on the Fluctuation Test (for some DSGE applications, see: Giacomini and Rossi, 2016; Cardani et al., 2019; Boneva et al., 2019) . This test is based on the calculation of RMSEs that are assessed to investigate if the forecasting performance can be influenced by instabilities in the model parameters.",

The first one includes models, used traditionally to describe returns or prices, but they are based on the price range or RB variance estimators. They comprise such models like multivariate EWMA, VAR, HVAR, and vector error correction (VEC). It is a simple approach, however most models omit modelling the covariance of returns. The second group is formed by the multivariate RB volatility models like RB-DCC , DSTCC-CARR (Chou and Cai, 2009 ), RR-HGADCC (Asai, 2013) , RB-MS-DCC (Su and Wu, 2014) , DCC-RGARCH (Fiszeder et al., 2019) , RB-copula (Chiang and Wang, 2011; Wu and Liang, 2011) .

If their presence is neglected, coefficients could be biasedly estimated. Biased estimates of ARIMA processes will decrease the efficiency of predictions (Bianco et al., 2001) . Moreover, as the optimal predictor of ARIMA models is a linear combination of observed units, the largest coefficients correspond to observations near the forecast origin and the presence of outliers among these units can severely affect the forecasts. The issue was first raised in the seminal paper by Fox (1972) , who suggests a classification of outliers in time series, separating additive outliers (AO) from innovation outliers (IO). The influence of different types of outliers on the prediction errors in conditional mean models (ARIMA models) is studied by Chen and Liu (1993a,b) and Ledolter (1989 Ledolter ( , 1991 , while the GARCH context is explored by Franses and Ghijsels (1999) and Catal\u00e1n and Tr\u00edvez (2007) . Abraham and George E. P. Box (1979) propose a Bayesian model which reflects the presence of outliers in time series and allows to mitigate their effects on estimated parameters and, consequently, improve the prediction ability. The main idea is to use a probabilistic framework allowing for the presence of a small group of discrepant units.",

A procedure for the correct specification of models is introduced by Tsay (1986) relying on iterative identification-detection-removal of cycles in the observed time series contaminated by outliers. The same issue is tackled by Abraham and Chuang (1989) ; in this work non-influential outliers are separated from influential outliers which are observations with high residuals affecting parameter estimation. Tsay's procedure has been later modified (Balke, 1993 ) to effectively detect time series level shifts. The impulse-and step-indicator saturation approach is used by Marczak and Proietti (2016) for detecting additive outliers and level shifts estimating structural models in the framework of nonstationary seasonal series. They find that timely detection of level shifts located towards the end of the series can improve the prediction accuracy. 22 This subsection was written by Luigi Grossi. All these works are important because outlier and influential observations detection are crucial for improving the forecasting performance of models. Alternatively, the presence of extreme values can be included in the process specification and, once parameters are estimated, the model can be used to obtain bootstrap forecast intervals reflecting the possibility of large stochastic events in the future (Phillips, 1996) .",

            "text": "In general, the forecasts from equilibrium-correction models can be robustified by estimating all model parameters over smaller or more flexible sub-samples. Several studies have proposed general procedures that allow for time-variation in the parameters; see, for example, Pesaran et al. (2013) , Giraitis et al. (2013) , and Inoue et al. (2017) . This allows for an optimal or more adaptive selection of model estimation windows in order generate forecasts after structural breaks have occured. An alternative approach for robustifying forecasts from equilibrium-correction models is to focus on the formulation and estimation of the equilibrium. Hendry (2006) shows that differencing the equilibriumcorrection mechanism can improve the forecasts by removing aspects which are susceptible to shifts. However, differencing the equilibrium also induces additional forecast-error variance. Castle et al. (2010) show that it is beneficial to update the equilibrium or to incorporate the underlying structural break process. Alternatively, Castle et al. (2015b) show that there can be large forecast gains from smoothing over estimates of the transformed equilibrium. Building on this, Martinez et al. (2019) show that there are many possible transformations of the equilibrium that can improve the forecasts. Several of these transformations imply that the equilibrium-correction model collapses to different naive forecast devices whose forecasts are often difficult to beat. By replacing the equilibrium with smooth estimates of these transformations, it is possible to outperform the naive forecasts at both short and long forecast horizons while retaining the underlying economic theory embedded within the equilibrium-correction model. Thus, it is possible to dramatically improve forecasts from equilibrium-correction models using targeted transformations of the estimated equilibrium so that it is less susceptible to the shifts which are so damaging to the model forecasts.",

The forecasting ability of a model can be evaluated by mimicking this setup -generating forecasts over some past period (so outcomes known) only using data known at each forecast origin. As noted by Clements and Hendry (2005) , out-ofsample forecast performance is the gold standard. Sometimes the analysis is pseudo real time. At a given forecast origin t, forecasts are constructed only using data up to the period t, but the data are taken from the latest-available vintage at the time the study is undertaken. The improved availability of real-time databases has facilitated proper real-time studies. 25 At time t the data are taken from the vintage available at time t. Data revisions are often important, and occur because statistical agencies strive to provide timely estimates which are based on incomplete source data (see, for example, Grimm, 2005, 2008; Zwijnenburg, 2015) .",

Suppose the vintage-t contains data for time periods up to t \u2212 1, denoted . . . , y t t\u22123 , y t t\u22122 , y t t\u22121 . The observation for time t \u2212 1 is a first estimate, for t \u2212 2 a second estimate, and so on, such that data for earlier periods will have been revised many times. Hence the model will be estimated on data of different maturities, much of which will have been revised many times. But the forecast will typically be generated by feeding into the model 'lightly-revised' data for the most recent time periods. The accuracy of the resulting forecasts can be improved upon (in principle) by taking into account data revisions (see, for example, Koenig et al., 2003; Kishor and Koenig, 2012; Clements and Galv\u00e3o, 2013b) . Koenig et al. (2003) suggest using real-time-vintage (RTV) data to estimate the model. The idea is to use early estimates of the data to estimate the model, so that the model is estimated on 'lightly-revised' data that matches the maturity of the forecast-origin data that the forecast is conditioned on.",

The simplest example is represented by the (cumulative) logistic equation that describes a pure epidemic process in a homogeneously mixing population (Verhulst, 1838) . The most famous and employed evolution of the logistic equation is the Bass model (Bass, 1969) developed in the field of quantitative marketing and soon become a major reference, due to its simple and powerful structure. The Bass model (BM) describes the life-cycle of an innovation, depicting its characterising phases of launch, growth/maturity, and decline, as result of the purchase decisions of a given cohort of potential adopters. Mathematically, the model is represented by a first order differential equation, describing a diffusion process by means of three parameters: the maximum market potential, m, assumed to be constant along the whole diffusion process, and parameters p and q, referring respectively to two distinct categories of consumers, the innovators, identified with parameter p, adopting for first, and the imitators, adopting at a later stage by imitating others' behaviour and thus responsible for word-of-mouth dynamics.",

The GBM enlarges the BM by multiplying its hazard rate by a very general intervention function x(t), assumed to be non-negative, which may account for exogenous shocks able to change the temporal dynamics of the diffusion process, like marketing strategies, incentive mechanisms, change in prices and policy measures.",

The value of their music is in its architecture and as a consequence it can be interpreted by any instrument, even by simple whistling. But two hundred years later composers such as Debussy wrote music that depends crucially on the interpretation, the how. Classical music was still \"young\" in Bach's time but was getting \"old\" by Debussy's time. No wonder Chopin is more popular than Bart\u00f3k. Chopin composed during the \"summer\" of music's S curve when public preoccupation with music grew fastest. Around that time composers were rewarded more handsomely than today. The innovations they made in music were assimilated by the public within a short period of time because the curve rose steeply and would rapidly catch up with each innovation. But today the curve has flattened and composers are given limited space. If they make even small innovations they find themselves above the curve and there would not be any time in the future when the public will appreciate their work. On the other hand, if they do not innovate, they will not be saying anything new. In either case today's composers will not be credited with an achievement.

Since for a specific lead-time the forecast interval only encompasses information from a marginal distribution, it can also be named marginal forecast interval (MFI). A MFI can be obtained from: parametric distribution, such as a Gaussian distribution with conditional mean and variance estimated with a Generalised ARCH model (Baillie and Bollerslev, 1992) ; non-parametric distribution, e.g., obtained with conditional kernel density estimation ; directly estimated with statistical learning methods, such as quantile regression (Taylor and Bunn, 1999) or bootstrapping (Masarotto, 1990) , or with machine learning algorithms like quantile random forests (Meinshausen, 2006) .",

SFI differ from MFI since take into account the temporal interdependency of forecast errors and are constructed to have the observed temporal trajectory of the response variable fully contained inside the forecast intervals during all lead-times of the time horizon. The number of works that cover SFI is lower when compared to the MFI, but some examples are: methods based on Bonferroni-and product-type inequalities applied time series forecasting models likes ARIMA and Holt-Winters (Ravishanker et al., 1991) ; combination of bootstrap replications and an heuristic optimisation procedure to find an envelope of the temporal trajectories closest to the deterministic forecast (Staszewska-Bystrova, 2011); sampling forecast errors at different horizons and estimate the SFI with the empirical Mahalanobis distance (Jord\u00e1 et al., 2013) .",

Some strategies reduce a subset of these coefficients to zero, removing some variables from the model entirely and these can hence be described as variable selection procedures.",

However, taxonomies of all possible sources of forecast errors from estimated models that are not the DGP show only a couple of mistakes determine forecast failures (systematic departures between forecasts and later outcomes), namely mismeasured forecast origins and unanticipated location shifts (Clements and Hendry, 1999; Hendry and Mizon, 2012) . Failure to capture these can distort estimation and forecasts. When facing an unknown number of in-sample contaminating outliers and multiple breaks at unknown times, selection must be jointly over both observations and variables, requiring computer learning methods (Hendry and Doornik, 2014; . Autometrics, a multiple-path block-search algorithm (see Doornik, 2018) , uses impulse (IIS: Hendry et al., 2008 and Nielsen, 2009b) and step (SIS: Castle et al., 2015c) indicator saturation for discovering outliers and breaks, as well as selecting over other variables. Although knowing the in-sample DGP need not suffice for successful forecasting after out-of-sample shifts like financial crises and pandemics, 'robust variants' of selected models can then avoid systematic mis-forecasts (see, for example, Martinez et al., 2019; Doornik et al., 2020a) .",

This procedure is implemented in the forecast package in R (R Core Team, 2020), in the function CVar. Given N forecasts of the same event, forecast combination involves estimation of so called combination weights assigned to each forecast, such that the accuracy of the combined forecast generally outperforms the accuracy of the forecasts included. Early statistical approaches adopted a range of strategies to estimate combination weights including (i) minimizing in-sample forecast error variance among forecast candidates (Bates and Granger, 1969; Newbold and Granger, 1974; Min and Zellner, 1993) , (ii) formulation and estimation via ordinary least squares regression (Granger and Ramanathan, 1984; MacDonald and Marsh, 1994) , (iii) use of approaches based on Bayesian probability theory (Bunn, 1975; Bordley, 1982; Clemen and Winkler, 1986; Diebold and Pauly, 1990; Raftery, 1993) , (iv) and the use of regime switching and time varying weights recognising that weights can change over time (Diebold and Pauly, 1987; Elliott et al., 2005; L\u00fctkepohl, 2011; Tian and Anderson, 2014) .

            "text": "Still, researchers have tried to understand why and when combinations improve forecast accuracy (Palm and Zellner, 1992; Petropoulos et al., 2018a; Timmermann, 2006) , and the popularity of the simple average (Chan and Pauwels, 2018; Smith and Wallis, 2009a; Claeskens et al., 2016) . Others have investigated properties of the distribution of the forecast error beyond accuracy considering issues such as normality, variance, and in out-of-sample performance of relevance to decision making (Makridakis and Winkler, 1989; Chan et al., 1999; Barrow and Kourentzes, 2016) . 36 This subsection was written by Devon K. Barrow. Looking forward, evidence suggests that the future lies in the combination of statistical and machine learning generated forecasts (Makridakis et al., 2020c) , and in the inclusion of human judgement (Gupta, 1994; Wang and Petropoulos, 2016; Petropoulos et al., 2018b) . Additionally, there is need to investigate such issues as decomposing combination accuracy gains, constructing prediction intervals (Koenker, 2005;  Grushka-Cockayne and Jose, 2020), and generating combined probability forecasts (Raftery et al., 1997; Ranjan and Gneiting, 2010; Hall and Mitchell, 2007; Clements and Harvey, 2011) . Finally, there is need for the results of combined forecasts to be more interpretable and suitable for decision making (Bordignon et al., 2013; Graefe et al., 2014; Barrow and Kourentzes, 2016; Todini, 2018 Tay and Wallis, 2000; Berkowitz, 2001; Guidolin and Timmermann, 2006; Shackleton et al., 2010, inter alia) .",

This literature goes back to Bates and Granger (1969) and a summary of more recent work is provided in (Timmermann, 2006) , while the ability of such methods to improve prediction accuracy is extensively documented (see, for example, Stock and Watson, 2004; Hansen, 2008; Guidolin and Timmermann, 2009, inter alia) . In recent years attention has shifted towards evaluation, comparison and combination of density forecasts with empirical applications that are mostly encountered in the areas of macroeconomics and finance. The improved performance of combined density forecasts stems from the fact that pooling of forecasts allows to mitigate potential misspecifications of the individual densities when the true population density is nonnormal. Combining normal densities yields a flexible mixture of normals density which can accommodate heavier tails (and hence skewness and kurtosis), as well as approximate non-linear specifications (Hall and Mitchell, 2007; Jore et al., 2010) .",

A popular approach is to combine density forecasts using a convex combination of experts' predictions, so called 'linear opinion pools' (see, for example, Hall and Mitchell, 2007; Kascha and Ravazzolo, 2010; Geweke and Amisano, 2011) . In order to determine the optimal combination weights this method relies on minimising Kullback-Leibler divergence of the true density from the combined density forecast. These linear approaches have been extended by Gneiting and Ranjan (2013) to allow non-linear transformations of the aggregation scheme and by Kapetanios et al. (2015) , whose 'generalised pools' allow the combination weights to depend on the (forecast) value of the variable of interest. 37 This subsection was written by Alisa Yusupova. Billio et al. (2013) developed a combination scheme that allows the weights associated with each predictive density to be time-varying, and propose a general state space representation of predictive densities and combination schemes. The constraint that the combination weights must be non-negative and sum to unity implies that linear and Gaussian state-space models cannot be used for inference and instead Sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle filters) are required. More recently, McAlinn and West (2019) developed a general Bayesian formulation for estimating time-varying linear (instead of convex) combinations of predictive densities. The method implemented in this work uses a pool of dynamic linear models to generate individual predictive densities, and then combines these through another dynamic linear model.",

When several forecasts are available to a decision maker, the problem of deciding on which of them one should rely upon becomes significant. It is generally hard to choose among several forecasts because one model could be best under certain circumstances but rather poor under others. Accordingly, to improve the available knowledge on a future unknown event, predictive densities are extended to multiple forecasts to provide decision makers with a single predictive probability, conditional upon several model's forecasts (Raftery et al., 1997; Coccia and Todini, 2011) .",

The average forecast is more accurate than choosing a forecast from the crowd at random and is sometimes even more accurate than nearly all individuals (Mannes et al., 2012) . The average point forecast also often outperforms more complicated point aggregation schemes, such as weighted combinations (Smith and Wallis, 2009b; Soule et al., 2020) . Mannes et al.

Of the two: \"The benefits of diversity are so strong that one can combine the judgments from individuals who differ a great deal in their individual accuracy and still gain from averaging\" (Mannes et al., 2012, page 234) . Larrick and Soll (2006) define the idea of 'bracketing': In the case of averaging, two experts can either bracket the realisation (the truth) or not. When their estimates bracket, the forecast generated by taking their average performs better than choosing one of the two experts at random; when the estimates do not bracket, averaging performs equally as well as the average expert. Thus, averaging can do no worse than the average expert, and with some bracketing, it can do much better. Modern machine learning algorithms such as the random forest exploit this property by averaging forecasts from hundreds of diverse experts (here, each \"expert\" is a regression tree; Grushka-Cockayne et al., 2017a).",

Castle. in improving forecasts using big data, as they allow for more flexible models that nest wider information sets, more general dynamics and many forms of non-linearity, the statistical problems facing 'small' data forecasting models do not disappear (Harford, 2014; Doornik and Hendry, 2015) . do not find improvements in forecasting from big data sets over small models. It is essential to keep in mind the classical statistical problems of mistaking correlation for causation, ignoring sampling biases, finding excess numbers of false positives and not handling structural breaks and non-constancies both in-and out-of-sample, in order to guard against these issues in a data abundant environment.",

One way to forecast an extensive collection of time series is to select the most appropriate method per series according to its features. Pioneer studies focus on rule-based methods (for example, Arinze, 1994; Wang et al., 2009b) to recommend the \"best\" forecasting model per series based on its features. Another line of approaches apply regression to study how useful features are in predicting which forecasting method performs best (for example, Meade, 2000; . With the advancement of machine learning, more recent literature uses \"meta-learning\" to describe the process of automatically acquiring knowledge for forecast model selection. The first such study is by Prud\u00eancio and Ludermir (2004) , who apply decision trees for forecast model selection. Lemke and Gabrys (2010) compare different meta-learning approaches to investigate which model works best in which situation. Kang et al. (2017) propose using feature spaces to visualise the strengths and weaknesses of different forecasting methods. Other algorithms such as neural networks and random forecasts are also applied to forecast model selection (K\u00fcck et al., 2016; Talagala et al., 2018) .",

In a recent work (Bergmeir et al., 2016) a similar approach was also consider, the residuals were extracted and resampled using moving block bootstrap. Bickel and Freedman (1981) and later in Angus (1992) showed that in extreme value theory, the bootstrap version for the maximum (or minimum) does not converge to the extremal limit laws. Zelterman (1993) pointed out that \"to resample the data for approximating the distribution of the k largest observations would not work because the 'pseudo-samples' would never have values greater than X n:n \" 49 .

The resampling stage uses moving block bootstrap (MBB: Lahiri and Lahiri, 2003) , applied to the remainder. There are several discussions in the literature about this procedure, mainly regarding the size of the blocks. MBB resampling the collection of overlapping (consecutive) blocks of observations. The idea is to keep the structure still present in the remainder. The forecasts are obtained via ETS methods and, for the final aggregation, the authors adopted the median. Their method is evaluated on the M3 data set and outperformed the original benchmarks. The work of Bergmeir et al. (2016) inspired many others: Dantas et al. (2017) applied the idea for air transport demand data and de Oliveira and Cyrino Oliveira (2018) for energy consumption, proposing the so-called remainder sieve bootstrap (RSB). Dantas and Cyrino Oliveira (2018) proposed an extension to the Bagged ETS where bagging and exponential smoothing are combined with clustering methods. The approach aims to consider and reduce the covariance effects among the ensemble time series, creating clusters of similar forecasts -since it could impact the variance of the group. A variety of forecasts are selected from each cluster, producing groups with reduced variance.",

This process is repeated until the information reaches the output layer as forecasts. NNs are trained by adjusting the weights that connect the nodes in a way that the network maps the input value of the training data to the corresponding output value.

Analogously to linear regression and Generalised Linear Models, obtaining probabilistic forecasts can be achieved by the neural network outputting not the forecasted value itself but rather parameters of probability distribution or density (Bishop, 2006) . In forecasting, a prominent example is the DeepAR model (Salinas et al., 2019b) , which uses a recurrent neural network architecture and assumes the probability distribution to be from a standard probability density function (e.g., negative binomial or Student's t). Variations are possible, with either non-standard output distributions in forecasting such as the multinomial distribution (Rabanser et al., 2020) or via representing the probability density as cumulative distribution function (Salinas et al., 2019a) or the quantile function .",

Standard negative log-likelihood based approaches are easily expressible in code as are approaches based on non-standard losses such as the continuous ranked probability score .

In recent years, a number of multivariate probabilistic forecasting models have been proposed (Salinas et al., 2019a; Rangapuram et al., 2020) , but much work remains to obtain a better understanding. Another counter-intuitive challenge for neural networks is to scale them down. Neural networks are highly parametrised, so in order to estimate parameters correctly, panels with lots of time series are needed.

First, conventional ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation is highly susceptible to overfitting in the presence of a large number of regressors (or features). OLS maximises the fit of the model over the estimation (or training) sample, which can lead to poor out-of-sample performance; in essence, OLS over-responds to noise in the data, and the problem becomes magnified as the number of features grows. A class of machine-learning techniques, which includes the popular least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO, Tibshirani, 1996) and elastic net (ENet, Zou and Hastie, 2005) , employs penalised regression to improve out-of-sample performance with large numbers of features. The LASSO and ENet guard against overfitting by shrinking the parameter estimates toward zero.",

In such an environment, it is vital to induce adequate shrinkage to guard against overfitting and more reliably uncover the predictive signal amidst all the noise. For LASSO and ENet estimation, a promising strategy is to employ a stringent information criterion, such as the Bayesian information criterion (BIC, Schwarz, 1978) , to select (or tune) the regularisation parameter governing the degree of shrinkage (often denoted by \u03bb). Wang et al. (2009a) and Fan and Tang (2013) A second reason for the popularity of machine learning in the era of big data is the existence of powerful tools for accommodating complex predictive relationships. In many contexts, a linear specification appears overly restrictive, as it may neglect important nonlinearities in the data that can potentially be exploited to improve forecasting performance. Neural networks (NNs) are perhaps the most popular machine-learning device for modelling nonlinear predictive relationships with a large number of features. Under a reasonable set of assumptions, a sufficiently complex NN can approximate any smooth function (for example, Cybenko, 1989; Funahashi, 1989; Hornik et al., 1989; Barron, 1994) .",

In the sole clustering applications, either the centroids of the clusters can be utilised or the labels. Pattern sequence-based forecasting is an approach that employs the cluster labels. In this approach, a clustering of all days prior to the test day is held and this results in sequences of labels of a certain length. Next, the similarity of the predicted day sequence with the historical data sequences is examined. The load curve of the predicted day is the average of the curves of the days following the same sequences (Martinez Alvarez et al., 2011) .",

(2004) and Zhou and Viswanathan (2011) to deal with intermittent demand items (Babai et al., 2020) . Willemain et al. (2004) have proposed a method that resamples demand data by using a Markov chain to switch between no demand and demand periods. The empirical outperformance of this method has been shown when Porras and Dekker (2008) were the first to consider aggregation with overlapping and non-overlapping blocks (OB and NOB) approach in forecasting the demand of spare parts. In the NOB approach, a demand series is divided into consecutive non-overlapping blocks of time, whereas in OB, at each period the oldest observation is dropped and the newest is included (Rostami-Tabar et al., 2013) . Boylan and Babai (2016) have compared the statistical and inventory performance of the OB and NOB methods. They found that, unless the demand history is short, there is a clear advantage of using OB instead of NOB. More recently, based on extreme value theory (EVT), Zhu et al. (2017) have proposed an improvement of the OB method that models better the tail of lead-time demand. They have shown that the empirical-EVT method leads to higher achieved target cycle service levels when compared to the original method proposed by Porras and Dekker (2008) .",

In this situation, it is convenient to introduce classification rules that allow subsets of time series to be forecasted using the same approaches and methods. Categorisation rules, such as the ABC inventory classification, serve the forecasting function only coincidentally. They do not necessarily align to the selection of the best forecasting method. Bartezzaghi et al. (1999) identified five factors that contribute towards intermittence and 'lumpiness' (intermittence with highly variable demand sizes): number of potential customers, frequency of customers' requests, heterogeneity of customers, variety of individual customer's requests, and correlations between customers' requests. These may contribute towards useful classifications, for example by the number of customers for an item. When this number is low and some of the customers are large, then direct 61 This subsection was written by John E. Boylan. communication with the customers can inform judgemental forecasts. Similarly, if a customer's requests are highly variable, then 'advance demand information' from customers can help to improve judgemental estimates. These strategies can be very useful in a business-to-business environment, where such strategies are feasible.",

It is more challenging to classify series according to their recommended forecasting method if some of the candidate methods, such as Croston's method, lack a fully satisfactory model base. In the field of intermittent demand forecasting, proposed the SBC classification scheme, enabling time series to be classified according to their length of average demand interval and coefficient of variation of demand sizes (when demand occurs). These rules were based on assumptions of independent and identically distributed (iid) demand, and a comparison of expected mean square error between methods. The scheme has been extended by Kostenko and Hyndman (2006) and by Petropoulos and Kourentzes (2015) . In an empirical case-study, Boylan et al. (2008) examined series not necessarily conforming to iid assumptions and found the rules to be robust to inexact specification of cut-off values. Moon et al. (2013) used logistic regression to classify time series of demand for spare parts in the South Korean Navy. The classification was designed to identify superior performance (accuracy and inventory costs) of direct and hierarchical forecasting methods, based on the serial correlation of demands, the coefficient of variation of demand volume of spare parts, and the functionality of the naval equipment.",

For example, in a system implemented to forecast the daily pollutant concentration in atmosphere, one of the inputs could relate to the weather conditions, such as the wind speed. In the classical approach, the system must have as an input the value of the wind speed at a certain day. In the fuzzy approach, the input of the system could be the membership grade of the input variable to three different fuzzy sets: (i) \"Not windy\", (ii) \"average windy\", and (iii) \"strong windy\". On the other hand, the user of the forecasting system may be only interested in a classification of the output variable instead of the crisp value. In this case, the fuzzy approach is applied to the pollutant concentration which could belong with a certain degree to the fuzzy sets (i) \"not polluted day\", (ii) \"medium polluted day\", (iii) \"high polluted day\", and (iv) \"critical polluted day\".",

The association of a crisp value to its membership for a set is called fuzzyfication, while the inverse operation (from a membership value to a crisp value) is called defuzzification. As with the logic theory, the inference system assumes a key role in the fuzzy theory. A Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) allows the interpretation of the membership grades of the input variable(s) and, given some sets of fuzzy rules, assigns the corresponding values to the output variable(s). In the literature, two main fuzzy inference systems are presented: 1. Mamdani system (Mamdani and Assilian, 1975) , where both the input and output of the inference system are membership functions. 2. Sugeno system (Sugeno, 1985) , where the output of the inference system is a crisp value, usually obtained by applying a linear function to the defuzzified value of the input.",

The first step of preparing the data is to filter out stop words -the words that do not add much meaning to a sentence, e.g., \"a\", \"is\", and \"me\". For grammatical reasons, it is necessary for documents to use different forms of words. Stemming and lemmatisation can be applied to reduce inflectional forms or relate different forms of a word to a common base form. Stemming often chops off the end of a word, while lemmatisation uses vocabularies and morphological analysis to return the base form (or the lemma) of a word (Lovins, JB, 1968; Manning et al., 2008) . For example, the word \"industries\" will be turned into \"industri\" or \"industry\" if stemming or lemmatisation is applied.",

Forecasts for the series at all levels of the hierarchy are first obtained independently without considering any aggregation constrains (we refer to these as base forecasts). Then, base forecasts are adjusted so that they become coherent (we refer to these as reconciled forecasts). This adjustment is achieved by a matrix that maps the base forecasts into new bottom-level forecasts which are then added up . Wickramasuriya et al. (2019) found the optimal solution for this matrix, which minimises the trace of the covariance matrix of the reconciled forecast errors (hence MinT reconciliation). This optimal solution is based on the covariance matrix of the base forecast errors which incorporates the correlation structure of the hierarchy. Wickramasuriya et al. (2019) presented several alternative estimators for this covariance matrix: (i) proportional to the identity which is optimal only when base forecast errors are uncorrelated and equivariant (referred to as OLS), (ii) proportional to the sample covariance estimator of the in-sample one-step-ahead base forecast errors with off-diagonal elements null accounts for the differences in scale between the levels of the hierarchy (referred to as WLS), (iii) proportional to the previous estimator unrestricted also accounts for the relationships between the series (referred to as MinT-Sample), and (iv) proportional to a shrinkage estimator based on the two previous estimators, parameterising the shrinkage in terms of variances and correlations, accounts for the correlation across levels (referred as MinT-Shrink).",

This not only tackles the need to select a single aggregation level, but also partly addresses the issue of model uncertainty, instead of relying on model selection and parametrisation at a single aggregation level. Using this property, Kourentzes et al. (2017) showed that MTA will typically lead to more accurate forecasts, even if in theory suboptimal. Different frequencies allow for better identification of different series patterns, so it is intuitive to consider multiple temporal levels and benefit from the subsequent forecast combination across frequencies. Kourentzes and Petropoulos (2016) showed how multiple temporal aggregation can be extended to incorporate exogenous variables.

(2009) , and work that followed from these (particularly Wickramasuriya et al., 2019) , they address different forecasting problems. Crosssectional hierarchies change the unit of analysis but are fixed in the period of analysis. For example, a manufacturer may operate using a hierarchy across products. The different nodes in the hierarchy will correspond to different products, product groups, super-groups, and so on, but will all refer to the same period, for example, a specific week. Temporal hierarchies do the opposite, where the unit of analysis is fixed, but the period is not. For example, we may look at the sales of a specific Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) at a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual levels. However, one can argue that having annual forecasts at the SKU level may not be useful. Similarly, having aggregate sales across an organisation at a weekly frequency is also of little value.",

The literature remains sparse on how to construct cross-temporal forecasts, as the size of the hierarchy can easily become problematic. Kourentzes and Athanasopoulos (2019) propose a heuristic approach to overcome the ensuing estimation issues. The approach works by compartmentalising the estimation. First, they obtain estimates of the cross-sectional reconciliation weights for each temporal level of the hierarchy. Then, these are combined across temporal levels, to a unique set that satisfies all coherency constraints. Using these combined weights, they obtain the reconciled bottom level forecasts, which can be aggregated as needed. Although they recognise that their approach can result in suboptimal results in terms of reconciliation errors, it guarantees coherent forecasts. Cross-temporal forecasts are more accurate than either temporal or cross-sectional hierarchical forecasts and provide a holistic view of the future across all planning levels and demarcations. Spiliotis et al. (2020c) also identify the problem, however, they do not focus on the coherency of forecasts and propose a sequential reconciliation across the two dimensions. This is shown to again be beneficial, but it does not achieve coherency. Arguably one can adapt the iterative correction algorithm by Kourentzes and Athanasopoulos (2020) to enforce coherency in this approach as well.",

It defines a fundamental problem in disciplines such as political science, sociology and epidemiology (Salway and Wakefield, 2004) . Cleave et al. (1995) , Greiner (2007) and Pavia et al. (2009) describe other areas of application. The fundamental difficulty of EIF lies in the fact that this is a problem with more unknowns than observations, giving rise to concerns over identifiability and indeterminacy: many sets of substantively different internal cell counts are consistent with a given marginal table. To overcome this issue, a similarity hypothesis (and, sometimes, the use of covariates) is routinely assumed. The basic hypothesis considers that either conditional row (underlying) probabilities or fractions are similar (related) among contingency tables (Greiner and Quinn, 2010) . The covariations among row and column margins of the different tables are then used to learn about the internal cells.",

EIF is exposed to the socalled ecological fallacy (Robinson, 1950) : the presence of inconsistencies in correlations and association measures across different levels of aggregation.

In this setting, the ecological fallacy is manifested through aggregation bias (Wakefield, 2004) due to contextual effects and/or spatial autocorrelation (Achen and Phillips Shively, 1995) . This has led many authors to disqualify ecological inference forecasts (see, for example, Freedman et al., 1998; Tam Cho, 1998; Anselin and Tam Cho, 2002; Herron and Shotts, 2004 ) and many others to study under which circumstances ecological inference predictions would be reliable (Firebaugh, 1978; Gelman et al., 2001; Forcina and Pellegrino, 2019) . Despite the criticisms, many algorithms for solving the EIF problem can be found in the literature, mainly from the ecological regression and mathematical programming frameworks (some of them available in functions of the R statistical software).",

See King et al. (2004) for a wide survey and Klima et al. (2016) and Plescia and De Sio (2018) for an extensive evaluation of procedures. In mathematical programming exact and inequality constraints for the inner-cell values are incorporated in a natural way. Hence, this approach has shown itself to be a proper framework for generating ecological inference forecasts. The proposals from this approach can be traced back to Hawkes (1969) and Irwin and Meeter (1969) . After them, some key references include McCarthy and Ryan (1977), Tziafetas (1986) , Corominas et al. (2015) , and Romero et al. (2020) . Solutions based on other strategies, for instance, entropy maximization, have been also suggested (see, for example, Johnston and Pattie, 2000;  Bernardini Papalia and Fernandez Vazquez, 2020). People may use judgment alone to make forecasts or they may use it in combination with statistical methods. Here the focus is on pure judgmental forecasting. Different types of judgment heuristic (mental 'rules of thumb') can be used to make forecasts. The heuristic used depends on the nature of the information available to the forecaster (Harvey, 2007) .",

For example, someone might be asked whether Manchester United or Burnley will win next week's match. Here one memory-based heuristic that might be applicable is the recognition heuristic: if one recognises one object but not the other, then one should infer that the recognised object has higher value (Goldstein and Gigerenzer, 2002 ). In the above example, most people who recognise just one of the teams would be likely to make a correct forecast that Manchester United will win (Ayton et al., 2011) . The availability heuristic is another memory-based heuristic that may be applicable: objects that are most easily brought to mind are those which are more likely. Thus, if we are asked which team is likely to come top of the premier league, we would say Manchester United if that is the one that most easily comes to mind. The availability heuristic is often effective because more likely events are encountered more often and more recently and are hence better remembered. However, it can be disrupted by, for example, greater media coverage of more unlikely (and hence more interesting) events. Tversky (1973) suggested that people use the representativeness heuristic to deal with this type of situation. Forecasters first select a variable that they think is able to represent the one that must be predicted.",

There is some evidence that, when forecasting from time series, people use anchor-and-adjustment heuristics (Hogarth and Makridakis, 1981; Lawrence and O'Connor, 1992) . For example, (i) when forecasting from an upward trended series, they anchor on the last data point and then make an upward adjustment to take the trend into account and (ii) when forecasting from an untrended series containing autocorrelation, they anchor on the last data point and make an adjustment towards the mean to take the autocorrelation into account. Kahneman (2011) and others have divided cognitive processes into those which are intuitive (System 1) and those which are deliberative (System 2). We have discussed only intuitive processes underlying judgmental forecasting (Gigerenzer, 2007) . However, they can be supplemented by deliberative (System 2) processes (Theocharis and Harvey, 2019) in some circumstances.",

Recent random movements, and events, are particularly likely to attract undue attention, so long-run patterns identified by the computer are given insufficient weight (Bolger and Harvey, 1993) .

(2002) found that participants were not very adept at selecting good forecasting algorithms from a range offered to them by an FSS and had higher error than those who were presented with the optimal algorithm by an FSS. Petropoulos et al. (2018b) compared judgmental selection of forecasting algorithms with automatic selection based on predetermined information criteria. They found that judgmental selection was better than automatic selection at avoiding the 'worst' models, but that automatic selection was superior at choosing the 'best' ones. In the end, overall accuracy of judgmental selection was better than that of algorithmic selection. If their experiment had included more variation of the data (trends, fractals, different autoregressive factors) and variation of proposed models, this could possibly have led to better algorithmic than judgmental performance (Harvey, 2019) . Time series that are more complex will place a higher cognitive load on judgmental selection. This was confirmed in a study by Han et al. (2019) , who used an electroencephalogram (EEG) for the comparison of judgmental forecast selection versus (judgmental) pattern identification. They found that pattern identification outperformed forecast selection, as the latter required a higher cognitive load, which in turn led to a lower forecasting accuracy. It is likely that, in practice, judgmental selection is much more common than automatic selection.",

            "text": "Panels of experts are often used in practice to produce judgmental forecasts. This is especially true in cases with limited available quantitative data and with the level of uncertainty being very high. In this section, three methods for eliciting judgmental forecasts from panels of experts are presented: the Delphi method, interaction groups (IG), and structured analogies (SA). The Delphi method is centred around organising and structuring group communication , which aims to achieve a convergence of opinion on a specific real-world issue. It is a multipleround survey in which experts participate anonymously to provide their forecasts and feedback (Rowe and Wright, 2001) . At the end of each round, the facilitator collects and prepares statistical summaries of the panel of experts' forecasts. These summaries are presented as feedback to the group, and may be used towards revising their forecasts. This loop continues until a consensus is reached, or the experts in the panel are not willing to revise their forecasts further. In some implementations of the Delphi method, justification of extreme positions (forecasts) is also part of the (anonymous) feedback process. The Delphi method results in a more accurate outcome in the decision-making process (Dalkey, 1969; Steurer, 2011) . Rowe and Wright (2001) mentioned that, by adopting the Delphi method, groups of individuals can produce more accurate forecasts than simply using unstructured methods. A drawback of the Delphi method is the additional cost associated with the need to run multiple rounds, extending the forecasting process as well as increasing the potential drop-out rates. On the other hand, the anonymity in the Delphi method eliminates issues such as groupthink and the 'dominant personalities' effects ( Van de Ven and Delbeco, 1971 ).",

In the SA method, the facilitator assembles a panel of experts. The experts are asked to recall and provide descriptions, forecasts, and similarities/differences for cases analogous to the target situation, as well as a similarity ranking for each of these analogous cases. The facilitator gathers the lists of the analogies provided by the experts, and prepares summaries, usually using weighted averages of the recalled cases based on their similarity to the target situation. Semi-structured analogies (sSA) have also been proposed in the literature, where the experts are asked to provide a final forecasts based on the analogous cases they recalled, which essentially reduces the load for the facilitator . Nikolopoulos et al. (2015) supported that the use of SA and IG could result to forecasts that are 50% more accurate compared to unstructured methods (such as unaided judgment). One common caveat of using panels of experts is the difficulty to identify who a real expert is. Engaging experts with high level of experience, and encouraging the interaction of experts are also supported by Armstrong and Green (2018) .",

The researchers investigated whether assimilation or contrast effects will occur when decision makers see optimistic (pessimistic) forecasts followed by pessimistic (optimistic) ones compared against receiving a single scenario in solitude. In case of assimilation, a scenario presenting an opposing world view with the initial one would cause adjustments in the opposite direction creating an offset effect.",

We live in an era where we are bombarded with news about how algorithms get it wrong, ranging from COVID-19 forecasts affecting lockdown decisions to algorithmic grade predictions affecting university admissions. Individuals appear to prefer forecasts from humans over those from statistical algorithms even when those forecasts are identical (\u00d6nkal et al., 2009) . Furthermore, they lose trust in algorithms quicker when they see forecast errors (Dietvorst et al., 2015; Prahl and Van Swol, 2017 ). Such 'algorithm aversion' and error intolerance is reduced when users have opportunity to adjust the forecasting outcome, irrespective of the extent of modification allowed (Dietvorst et al., 2018) . Feedback appears to improve trust, with individuals placing higher trust in algorithms if they can understand them (Seong and Bisantz, 2008) . Overuse of technical language may reduce understanding of the forecast/advice, in turn affecting perceptions of expertise and trustworthiness (Joiner et al., 2002) . Explanations can be helpful (Goodwin et al., 2013b) , with their packaging affecting judgments of trustworthiness (Elsbach and Elofson, 2000) . Algorithmic appreciation appears to easily fade with forecasting expertise (Logg et al., 2019) , emphasising the importance of debiasing against overconfidence and anchoring on one's own predictions.",

Finally, a less common type of forecast would be a predictive Highest Density Region (pHDR), i.e., an HDR (Hyndman, 1996) for the conditional density of the future observable. pHDRs would be interesting for multimodal (possibly implicit) predictive densities, e.g., in scenario planning.

It is nevertheless imperative to think about which functional of the implicit density we want to elicit (Gneiting, 2011a) , and tailor our error measure -and forecasting algorithm! -to it. It usually makes no sense to evaluate a point forecast with multiple PFEMs (Kolassa, 2020b) . 75 This subsection was written by Stephan Kolassa. Interval forecasts can be specified in multiple ways. We can start with a probability coverage and require two appropriate quantiles -e.g., we could require a 2.5% and a 97.5% quantile forecast, yielding a symmetric or equal-tailed 95% interval forecast. Interval forecasts of this form can be evaluated by the interval score (Winkler, 1972; Brehmer and Gneiting, 2020) , a proper scoring rule (section 6.2 in . We can also use the hinge loss to evaluate the quantile forecasts separately. Alternatively, we can require a shortest interval subject to a specified coverage. This interval is not elicitable relative to practically relevant classes of distributions (Brehmer and Gneiting, 2020 ). Yet another possibility is to maximise the interval forecast's probability coverage, subject to a maximum length 2 . This modal interval is elicitable by an appropriate -zero-one-loss (Brehmer and Gneiting, 2020) .",

From the theoretical point of view, we should always report the predicted cumulative distribution function F of our prediction target F.

For univariate prediction problems a common alternative is to report quantile forecast on a dense grid of probabilities, as it approximates the full distribution . For multivariate forecasts, it seems to become standard to report a large ensemble (a set of simulated trajectories/paths) of the full predictive distribution. The reason is that the reporting of a multivariate distribution (or an equivalent characterisation) of sophisticated prediction models is often not feasible or practicable, especially for non-parametric or copula-based forecasting methods.",

The CRPS can be well approximated by averaging across quantile forecasts on an equidistant grid of probabilities (Nowotarski and Weron, 2018) . 76 This subsection was written by Florian Ziel. For multivariate forecast evaluation the situation is more complicated and many questions remain open . The multivariate version of the log-score is a strictly proper scoring rule, but it requires the availability of a multivariate density forecast. This makes it impracticable for many applications. discuss the energy score, a multivariate generalisation of the CRPS, that is strictly proper. Still, it took the energy score more than a decade to increase its popularity in forecasting. A potential reason is the limited simulation study of Pinson and Tastu (2013) that concludes that the energy score can not discriminate well differences in the dependency structure.",

It shows the distribution of the ranks of the observations within the corresponding ensembles and has the same interpretation as the PIT histogram. 77 This subsection was written by Thordis Thorarinsdottir. For small test sets, the bin number of a PIT/rank histogram must be chosen with care. With very few bins, the plot may obscure miscalibration while with many bins, even perfectly calibrated forecasts can yield non-uniformly appearing histograms (Thorarinsdottir and Schuhen, 2018; Heinrich, 2020) . The bin number should be chosen based on the size of the test set, with the bin number increasing linearly with the size of the test set (Heinrich, 2020) . More specifically, the uniformity of PIT/rank values can be assessed with statistical tests (Delle Monache et al., 2006; Taillardat et al., 2016; Wilks, 2019) , where the test statistics can be interpreted as a distance between the observed and a flat histogram (Wilks, 2019; Heinrich, 2020) . Testing predictive performance is further discussed in section 2.11.4.",

In this section, many aspects of the theory of forecasting were covered, with aspects related to data, modelling and reasoning, forecast verification.

            "text": "First of all, it is of utmost importance to remember that forecasting is a process that involves both quantitative aspects (based on data and models) and humans, at various levels, i.e., from the generation of forecasts to their use in decision-making. A first consequence is that we always need to find, depending on the problem at hand, an optimal trade-off between data-driven approaches and the use of expert judgement. In parallel, forecasting is to be thought of in a probabilistic framework in a systematic manner (Gneiting and Katzfuss, 2014) . This allows us to naturally convey uncertainty about the future, while providing the right basis to make optimal decisions in view of the characteristics of the decision problem, as well as the loss (or utility) function and risk aversion of the decision maker. Another consequence is that using forecasts as input to decision-making often affects the outcome to be predicted itself -a problem known as self-negating forecasts (possibly also self-fulfilling) or the prophet dilemma. With advances in the science of dynamic systems and game theory, we should invest in modelling those systems as a whole (i.e., forecasting and decision-making) in order to predict the full range of possible outcomes, based on the decisions that could be made. 79 This subsection was written by Pierre Pinson. In parallel, it is clear that today, the amount of data being collected and possibly available for forecasting is growing at an astounding pace. This requires re-thinking our approaches to forecasting towards high-dimensional models, online learning, etc. Importantly, the data being collected is distributed in terms of ownership. And, due to privacy concerns and competitive interests, some may not be ready to share their data. Novel frameworks to learning and forecasting ought to be developed with that context in mind, for instance focusing on distributed and privacy-preserving learning -an example among many others is that of Google pushing forward federated learning (Abadi et al., 2016) , an approach to deep learning where the learning process is distributed and with a privacy layer. Eventually the access and use of data, as well as the contribution to distributed learning (and collaborative analytics, more generally), may be monetised, bringing a mechanism design component to the future theory of forecasting. A simple and pragmatic example is that of forecast reconciliation: if asking various agents to modify their forecasts to make them coherent within a hierarchy, such modifications could be monetised to compensate for accuracy loss.",

Different approaches have been proposed to maximise the generalisation ability of those models, to somewhat maximise chances to do well out-of-sample. At the root of this problem is the effort to go beyond correlation only, and to identify causality (see, e.g., Pearl (2009) for a recent extensive coverage). While causality has been a key topic of interest to forecasters for a long time already, new approaches and concepts are being pushed forward for identification of and inference in causal models , which may have a significant impact on the theory of forecasting.",

The nature of goodness of forecasts (seen from the meteorological application angle) was theorised a few decades ago already (Murphy, 1993) , based on consistency, quality and value. We still see the need to work further on that question -possibly considering these 3 pillars, but possibly also finding other ways to define desirable properties of forecasts. This will, in all cases, translates to further developing frameworks for forecast verification, focusing on the interplay between forecast quality and value, but also better linking to psychology and behavioural economics. In terms of forecast verification, some of the most pressing areas most likely relate to (multivariate) probabilistic forecasting and to the forecasting of extreme events. When it comes to forecast quality and value, we need to go beyond the simple plugging of forecasts into decision problems to assess whether this yields better decisions, or not. Instead, we ought to propose suitable theoretical frameworks that allow assessing whether certain forecasts are fundamentally better (than others) for given classes of decision problems. Finally, the link to psychology and behavioural economics should ensure a better appraisal of how forecasts are to be communicated, how they are perceived and acted upon.",

The solution, perhaps, is what Morlidge (2014a, page 39) suggests that \"users should focus less on trying to optimise their forecasting process than on detecting where their process is severely suboptimal and taking measures to redress the problem\". This is where FVA can help. For now, the challenge for researchers remains: To prompt practitioners to adopt sound methods based on the objective assessment of available information, and avoid the \"worst practices\" that squander resources and fail to improve the forecast.",

Accurate demand estimate of the present and future is a first vital step for almost all aspects of supply chain optimisation, such as inventory management, vehicle scheduling, workforce planning, and distribution and marketing strategies (Kolassa and Siemsen, 2016) . Simply speaking, better demand forecasts can yield significantly better supply chain management, including improved inventory management and increased service levels. Classic demand forecasts mainly rely on qualitative techniques, based on expert judgement and past experience (e.g., Weaver, 1971) , and quantitative techniques, based on statistical and machine learning modelling (e.g., Taylor, 2003b; Bacha and Meyer, 1992) .

Recently, to deal with these new challenges, numerous empirical studies have identified the potentials of deep learning based global models, in both point and probabilistic demand forecasting (e.g., Wen et al., 2017; Rangapuram et al., 2018; Salinas et al., 2019a; Bandara et al., 2020b) . With the merits of cross-learning, global models have been shown to be able to learn long memory patterns and related effects (Montero-Manso and Hyndman, 2020), latent correlation across multiple series (Smyl, 2020) , handle complex real-world forecasting situations such as data sparsity and cold-starts , include exogenous covariates such as promotional information and keyword search indices (Law et al., 2019) , and allow for different choices of distributional assumptions (Salinas et al., 2019a) .",

The purposes of S&OP are to balance supply and demand and to link an organisation's operational and strategic plans. This requires collaboration between individuals and functional areas at different levels because it involves data sharing and achieving a consensus on forecasts and common objectives (Mello, 2010) . Successful implementations of S&OP are therefore associated with forecasts that are both aligned with an organisation's needs and able to draw on information from across the organisation. This can be contrasted with the 'silo culture' identified in a survey of companies by Moon et al. (2003) where separate forecasts were prepared by different departments in 'islands of analysis'. Methods for reconciling forecasts at different levels in both crosssectional hierarchies (e.g., national, regional and local forecasts) and temporal hierarchies (e.g., annual, monthly and daily forecasts) are also emerging as an approach to break through information silos in organisations. Cross-temporal reconciliation provides a data-driven approach that allows information to be drawn from different sources and levels of the hierarchy and enables this to be blended into coherent forecasts (Kourentzes and Athanasopoulos, 2019) . 82 This subsection was written by Paul Goodwin. In some supply chains, companies have agreed to share data and jointly manage planning processes in an initiative known as Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR) (Seifert, 2003) .",

A more direct approach is to smooth the mean square errors over the lead time . Strijbosch and Moors (2005) showed that unbiased forecasts will not necessarily lead to achievement, on average, of target cycle service levels or fill rates. Wallstr\u00f6m and Segerstedt (2010) proposed a 'Periods in Stock' measure, which may be interpreted, based on a 'fictitious stock', as the number of periods a unit of the forecasted item has been in stock or out of stock. Such measures may be complemented by a detailed examination of error-implication metrics . For inventory management, these metrics will typically include inventory holdings and service level implications (e.g., cycle service level, fill rate). Comparisons may be based on total costs or via 'exchange curves', showing the trade-offs between service and inventory holding costs. Comparisons such as these are now regarded as standard in the literature on forecasting for inventories and align well with practice in industry.",

Data often exhibit multiple seasonal patterns namely weekly and annual cycles which can be modelled by Fourier terms or dummies (Huang et al., 2019) . Demand increases substantially during holidays, festivals, and other special events such as Christmas and Easter which can be captured by dummies. Weather conditions may also affect sales namely high temperature. In contrast to calendar events whose dates are known weather variables need to be forecasted. Price reductions and feature advertisement can boost sales considerably.

Third, the objective of promotional models does not end with providing accurate predictions. We are also interested in the effect of the various predictors: their elasticity. This can in turn provide the users with valuable information about the customers, but also be an input for constructing optimal promotional and pricing strategies .

Especially at that level, limited sales history and potentially non-existing examples of past promotions can be a challenge. (Trapero et al., 2015) consider this problem and propose using a promotional model that has two parts that are jointly estimated. The first part focuses on the time series dynamics and is modelled locally for each SKU. The second part tackles the promotional part, which pools examples of promotions across SKUs to enable providing reasonable estimates of uplifts even for new SKUs. To ensure the expected heterogeneity in the promotional effects, the model is provided with product group information. Another recent innovation is looking at modelling promotional effects both at the aggregate brand or total sales level, and disaggregate SKU level, relying on temporal aggregation (Kourentzes and Petropoulos, 2016) . Ma et al. (2016) concern themselves with the intra-and inter-category promotional information. The challenge now is the number of variables to be considered for the promotional model, which they address by using sequential LASSO. Although the aforementioned models have shown very promising results, one has to recognise that in practice promotions are often forecasted using judgemental adjustments, with inconsistent performance (Trapero et al., 2013) .",

Such product in forecasting parlance is called as 'an analogous product'. In modelling terms, the product will have a growth curve defined by the same parameters as that of the new product. Much work has been done in identifying the analogous products and finding the parameter ranges for different products in different industry sectors. Identifying a truly 'analogous product' has proven to be challenging. Many growth curve implementations have shown that forecasting error could easily be more than 50% (Kahn, 2002; Goodwin et al., 2013a) . Hence the continued research in this area.",

The demand for spare parts originates from the replacement of parts in the installed base of machines (i.e., the location and number of products in use), either preventively or upon breakdown of the part (Kim et al., 2017). Fortuin (1984) claims that using installed base information to forecast the spare part demand can lead to stock reductions of up to 25%. An overview of the literature that deals with spare parts forecasting with installed base information is given by Van der Auweraer and Boute (2019). Spare parts demand can be driven by the result of maintenance inspections and, in this case, a maintenance-based forecasting model should then be considered to deal with this issue. Such forecasting models include the Delay Time (DT) model analysed in Wang and Syntetos (2011) . Using the fitted values of the distribution parameters of a data set related to a hospital pumps, Wang and Syntetos (2011) have shown that when the failure and fault arriving characteristics of the items can be captured, it is recommended to use the DT model to forecast the spare part demand with a higher forecast accuracy.",

The seminal work by Kelle and Silver (1989) offers a useful framework to forecasting that is based on the degree of available information about the relationship between demand and returns. Product level (PL) information consists of the time series of sales and returns, alongside information on the time each product spends with a customer. The question then is how to derive this time to return distribution. This can be done through managerial experience, by investigating the correlation of the demand and the returns time series, or by serialising and tracking a subset (sample) of items. Past sales can then be used in conjunction with this distribution to create forecasts of returns. Serial number level (SL) information, is more detailed and consists of the time matching of an individual unit item's issues and returns and thus exactly the time each individual unit, on a serial number basis, spent with the customer.",

(2019) offered empirical evidence in the area of returns forecasting by analysing a serialised data set from a remanufacturing company in North Wales. They found the Beta probability distribution to best fit times-to-return. Their research suggests that serialisation is something worthwhile pursuing for low volume products, especially if they are expensive. This makes a lot of sense from an investment perspective, since the relevant serial numbers are very few. However, they also provided evidence that such benefits expand in the case of high volume items. Importantly, the benefits of serialisation not only enable the implementation of the more complex SL method, but also the accurate characterisation of the returns process, thus also benefiting the PL method (which has been shown to be very robust).",

Survey expectations have been used to test theories of expectations formation for the last 50 years. Initially the Livingston survey data on inflationary expectations was used to test extrapolative or adaptive hypothesis, but the focus soon turned to testing whether expectations are formed rationally (see Turnovsky and Wachter, 1972 , for an early contribution). According to (Muth, 1961, p.316) , rational expectations is the hypothesis that: 'expectations, since they are informed predictions of future events, are essentially the same as the predictions of the relevant economic theory.' This assumes all agents have access to all relevant information. Instead, one can test whether agents make efficient use of the information they possess. This is the notion of forecast efficiency (Mincer and Zarnowitz, 1969) , and can be tested by regressing the outturns on a constant and the forecasts of those outturns. Under forecast efficiency, the constant should be zero and the coefficient on the forecasts should be one. When the slope coefficient is not equal to one, the forecast errors will be systematically related to information available at the forecast origin, namely, the forecasts, and cannot be optimal. The exchange between Figlewski and Wachtel (1981, 1983) and Dietrich and Joines (1983) clarifies the role of partial information in testing forecast efficiency (that is, full information is not necessary), and shows that the use of the aggregate or consensus forecast in the individual realisation-forecast regression outlined above will give rise to a slope parameter less than one when forecasters are efficient but possess partial information. Zarnowitz (1985) , Keane and Runkle (1990) and Bonham and Cohen (2001) consider pooling across individuals in the realisation-forecast regression, and the role of correlated shocks across individuals.",

The data show many different 'regimes', both in levels and volatility. Forecasting unemployment is challenging when the data are highly non-stationary with abrupt distributional shifts, but persistence within regimes. There is a huge literature forecasting the US unemployment rate, which is characterised by more regular business cycle patterns of expansion and contraction compared to the UK. Non-linear statistical models tend to outperform within contractions or expansions, but perform worse across business cycles, see, e.g., Montgomery et al. (1998) , Rothman (1998) , and Koop and Potter (1999) , whereas Proietti (2003) finds that linear models characterised by higher persistence perform significantly better. For the UK, evidence of non-linearities is found by Peel and Speight (2000) , Milas and Rothman (2008) , and Johnes (1999) , and Gil-Alana (2001) finds evidence of long-memory. Barnichon and Garda (2016) applies a flow approach to unemployment forecasting and finds improvements, as does Smith (2011) .

Profitability is proxied by the gap between the real interest rate (reflecting costs) and the real growth rate (reflecting the demand side), such that the unemployment rate rises when the real interest rate exceeds the real growth rate, and vice versa. A dynamic equilibrium correction model, using impulse indicator saturation Given the inconclusive state of the literature, how can we make progress in forecasting aggregate UK unemployment? Forecasting models could be improved with either (i) better economic theories of aggregate unemployment, 96 or (ii) more general empirical models that tackle stochastic trends, breaks, dynamics, non-linearities and interdependence, 97 or better still, both. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown policies highlight just how important forecasts of unemployment are, see . 96 There are many relevant theories based on microfoundations, including search and matching, loss of skills, efficiency wages, and insider-outsider models, see Layard et al. (1991) for a summary. However, our focus is on aggregate unemployment. 97 See Hendry and Doornik (2014) for an approach to jointly tackling all of these issues. Figure 6 shows forecasts from a model of unemployment which would have predicted a 1% rise in the unemployment rate in April and May 2020 given a 30% decline in real GDP, based on the scenario of no furlough scheme. Also included are extrapolative forecasts (Cardt: Doornik et al., 2020a) which show no such rise, reflecting the success of the furlough scheme in maintaining employment during lockdown. As these policies come to an end forecasting models are needed that can handle sudden shifts and changes in policy. ",

The data show that productivity growth is very volatile and has undergone large historical shifts with productivity growth averaging around 1% between 1800-1950 followed by an increase in the average annual growth to 3% between 1950-1975. Since the mid-1970's productivity growth has fluctuated around 2%; see panel B of figure 7. However, over the last decade since 2009, 2% annual growth has proved to be an upper bound rather than the average. The most common approach for forecasting productivity, both in the UK and elsewhere, is to estimate the trend growth in productivity using aggregate data. For example, Gordon (2003) considers three separate approaches for calculating trend labour productivity in the United States based on (i) average historical growth rates outside of the business cycle, (ii) filtering the data using the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter (Hodrick and Prescott, 1997) , and (iii) filtering the data using the Kalman filter (Kalman, 1960) . In the UK, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) follows a similar approach for generating its forecasts of productivity based on the average historical growth rate as well as judgements about factors that may 98 This subsection was written by Andrew B. Martinez. In the last few decades there have been several attempts to test and allow for time-varying trends in productivity. However, the focus of these approaches has been primarily on the United States (Hansen, 2001; Roberts, 2001) , which saw a sharp rise in productivity growth in the 1990's that was not mirrored in the UK (Basu et al., 2003) . Tests for shifts in productivity growth rates in advanced economies did not find evidence of a change in productivity growth in the UK until well after the financial crisis in 2007 (Benati, 2007; Turner and Boulhol, 2011; Glocker and Wegm\u00fcller, 2018) . ing for the long-term trend forecast to adjust based on more recent historical patterns. By taking a local average of the last four years of growth rates, Martinez et al. (2019) generate productivity forecasts whose RMSE is on average 75% smaller than OBR's forecasts extending five-years-ahead and is 84% smaller at the longest forecast horizon.",

Subsequently, a literature has emerged that has documented that MSMs are required to successfully forecast the yield curve, with emphasis on short rates. Lanne and Saikkonen (2003) show that a mixture of autoregressions with two regimes improves the predictions of US T-bill rates. Ang and Bekaert (2002a) investigate the MS dynamics of short-term rates for the US, the UK, and Germany. Bekaert et al. (2001) show that while single-state VARs cannot generate distributions consistent with the expectations hypothesis (EH), Markov regimes weaken the evidence against the EH. In fact, because the EH and rational expectations imply that forward rates represent the optimal forecast of spot rates (apart from a risk premium), Guidolin and Timmermann (2009) find that the optimal combinations of lagged short and forward rates depend on regimes so that the EH holds only in such states. A number of papers have also investigated the presence of regimes in the typical factors (level, slope, and convexity) that characterise the no-arbitrage dynamics of the term structure, showing the predictive benefits of incorporating MS (see, for example, Guidolin and Pedio, 2019; Hevia et al., 2015) . As widely documented (Guidolin and Thornton, 2018) , the predictable component in the mean rates is hardly significant. As a result, the random walk tends to predict well. However, density forecasts reflect all moments and the models that capture the dynamics of higher-order moments tend to perform best. MSMs appear at the forefront of a class of non-linear models that produce accurate density predictions (Hong et al., 2004; Maheu and Yang, 2016) .",

In most of the applications to interest rates, the regimes are determined by the lagged level of the short rate itself, in a self-exciting fashion. For instance, Pfann et al. (1996) explored nonlinear dynamics of the US short-term interest rate using a (selfexciting) threshold autoregressive model augmented by conditional heteroscedasticity (namely, a TAR-GARCH model) and found strong evidence of the presence of two regimes. More recently, also Gospodinov (2005) has used a TAR-GARCH to predict the short-term rate and has shown that this model can capture some well-documented features of the empirical data, such as high persistence and strong conditional heteroscedasticity. Lemke and Archontakis (2008) have derived the analytical solution for arbitrage-free bond yields when the short-term riskless rate follows a threshold autoregressive model and have found that self-exciting autoregressive models are especially suitable to capture the near unit-root behaviour typically observed in the evolution of short rates.",

The initial studies explored the role of monetary fundamentals to find that these models deliver inaccurate short-term and not so bad long-term predictions in comparison to the random walk (Meese and Rogoff, 1983; Mark, 1995) . In a comprehensive study from mid-2000s, Cheung et al. (2005 showed that neither monetary, uncovered interest parity (UIP) nor behavioural equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) model are able to outperform the no-change forecast. A step forward was made by Molodtsova and Papell (2009) , who proposed a model combining the UIP and Taylor rule equations and showed that it delivers competitive exchange rate forecasts. This result, however, has not been confirmed by more recent studies (Cheung et al., 2019; Engel et al., 2019) . In turn, Ca' Zorzi and Rubaszek (2020) argue that a simple method assuming gradual adjustment of the exchange rate towards the level implied forecasting. Overall, at the current juncture it might be claimed that \"exchange rate disconnect puzzle\" is still puzzling, with some evidence that methods based on PPP and controlling the estimation forecast error can deliver more accurate forecast than the random walk benchmark.",

From practical point of view, it is important that low and high prices are almost always available with daily closing prices for financial series. The price range (or its logarithm) is a significantly more efficient estimator of volatility than the estimator based on closing prices (Alizadeh et al., 2002) . Similarly the co-range (the covariance based on price ranges) is a significantly more efficient estimator of the covariance of returns than the estimator based on closing prices (Brunetti and Lildholdt, 2002) . For these reasons models based on the price range and the co-range better describe variances and covariances of financial returns than the ones based on closing prices.",

In the copula framework, because marginal models and copula models are separable, point forecasts are straightforward with marginal models, but dependence information is ignored. A joint probabilistic forecast with copulas involves both estimations of the copula distribution and marginal models. In financial time series, an emerging interest is to model and forecast the asymmetric dependence. A typical asymmetric dependence phenomenon is that two stock returns exhibit greater correlation during market downturns than market upturns. Patton (2006a) employs the asymmetric dependence between exchange rates with a time-varying copula construction with AR and GARCH margins. A similar study for measuring financial contagion with copulas allows the parameters of the copula to change with the states of the variance to identify shifts in the dependence structure in times of crisis (Rodriguez, 2007) .",

            "text": "Investment style or factor portfolios are constructed from constituent securities on the basis of a variety of a-priori observable characteristics, thought to affect future returns. For example a 'Momentum' portfolio might be constructed with positive ('long') exposures to stocks with positive trailing 12-month returns, and negative ('short') exposure to stocks with negative trailing 12-month returns (for full background and context, see, for example Bernstein, 1995; Haugen, 2010) . 112 Explanations as to why such characteristics seem to predict returns fall in to two main camps: firstly that the returns represent a risk premium, earned by the investor in return for taking on some kind of (undiversifiable) risk, and secondly that such returns are the result of behavioural biases on the part of investors. In practice, both explanations are likely to drive style returns to a greater or lesser extent. Several such strategies have generated reasonably consistent positive risk-adjusted returns over many decades, but as with many financial return series, return volatility is large relative to the mean, and there can be periods of months or even years when returns deviate significantly from their long-run averages. The idea of timing exposure to styles is therefore at least superficially attractive, although the feasibility of doing so is a matter of some debate (Arnott et al., 2016; Asness, 2016; Bender et al., 2018) . Overconfidence in timing ability has a direct cost in terms of trading frictions and opportunity cost in terms of potential expected returns and diversification forgone. Linnainmaa (2020) explore the relationship between momentum in factor portfolios and momentum in underlying stock returns. As with valuation spreads mentioned below, there is a risk that using momentum signals to time exposure to momentum factor portfolios risks unwittingly compounding exposure. A related strand of research relates (own) factor volatility to future returns, in particular for momentum factors (Barroso, 2015; Daniel and Moskowitz, 2016 Bernstein (1995) and references therein).",

On a univariate basis, most styles display returns which are highly negatively skewed and demonstrate significant kurtosis. The long-run low correlation between investment styles is often put forward as a benefit of style-based strategies, but more careful analysis reveals that non-normality extends to the co-movements of investment style returns; factors exhibit significant tail dependence. Christoffersen and Langlois (2013) explores this issue, also giving details of the skew and kurtosis of weekly style returns. These features of the data mean that focusing solely on forecasting the mean may not be sufficient, and building distributional forecasts becomes important for proper risk management.

Given the herding behaviour, any model to use for prediction should include some self-exciting behaviour. For that purpose, A\u00eft-Sahalia et al.

An example for a typical application in this space is optimisation of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The goal is to minimise its energy use under the constraints of maintaining certain comfort levels in the building. Though this is predominantly an optimisation exercise, forecasting comes in at different points of the system as input into the optimisation, and many problems in this space involve forecasting as a sub-problem, for example: energy consumption forecasting, room occupancy forecasting, inside temperature forecasting, (hyper-local) forecasts of outside temperature, air pressure forecasting for ventilation, and others. For example, Kr\u00fcger and Givoni (2004) use a linear regression approach to predict inside temperatures in 3 houses in Brazil and optimally select the thermal systems that should be used based on their particularities, and Ruano et al. (2006) (2018b) predict building energy consumption of residential and commercial buildings to improve energy efficiency and achieve energy savings. They use decision tree-based algorithms (random forests, gradient boosted trees), and neural networks for their predictions. Also, recent trends in forecasting such as global forecasting models built across a set of time series , especially using (recurrent) neural networks (Bandara et al., 2020a; Hewamalage et al., 2020) are particularly suitable for this type of processing due to their capabilities to deal with external inputs and cold-start problems. Such capabilities are necessary if there are different regimes in the simulations under which to predict, an example of such a system for HVAC optimisation is presented by Godahewa et al. (2020) .",

Several stylised facts of prices, which are crucial for predictive purposes, have been identified: seasonality, mean reversion, volatility, and spikes (or jumps). Very high prices on electricity markets are usually observed in connection to a sudden increase in demand during extreme weather events or as a consequence of drops in the supply in case of plant failures. The presence of spikes is explored in several papers which can be divided into two main streams: spike forecasting and prediction of prices under normal regime through robust estimators.",

(2005) tries to explain the origins of price spikes employing a new composite index and develops a model based on data mining to forecast price spikes taking advantage of the links with a set of explanatory variables. Spikes are often modelled as one regime of nonlinear models for time series. This approach is followed by Mount et al. (2006) and Becker et al. (2008) . The first paper focuses on regime-switching models with parameters driven by time-varying variables. These models prove very effective in predicting price spikes thanks to the strict connection of transition probabilities with current market conditions. The second paper adopts Markov switching models for spikes prediction including demand and weather variables for the estimation of time-varying transition probabilities. Christensen et al. (2009 Christensen et al. ( , 2012 suggest treating and forecasting price spikes through Poisson autoregressive and discrete-time processes, respectively. In the first paper, spikes are modelled to account for their persistence, while in the second a non-linear variant of the autoregressive conditional hazard model is used to exploit the information of previous spikes. Herrera and Gonz\u00e1lez (2014) The focus of the paper is not on the prediction of spikes, but on the forecast of ordinary prices using estimators which are slightly affected by the presence of abnormal observations. A similar approach has been followed by Wang et al. (2020a) using an outlier-robust machine learning algorithm.",

Among the approaches employed to predict the spread of RETs, the innovation diffusion framework appears a suitable choice, for its ability to capture in a simple and efficient way the nonlinear, evolutionary nature of these processes. From the seminal work by Marchetti and Nakicenovic (1979) , theorising that innovation dynamics in energy systems are similar to those of other commercial sectors or technologies, a growing body of literature has treated energy technologies with innovation diffusion models, as if they were new products needing to be accepted in a market on the basis of final decisions of individuals and market mechanisms like incentive measures, tariffs and price changes. Examples of these applications are provided in the papers by Guseo et al. (2007) , Guidolin and Mortarino (2010) , Dalla Valle and Furlan (2014) , Guidolin and Guseo (2012) , and Furlan et al.

On the other hand, the adoption of RETs is characterised by several technological, financial and administrative complexities with high initial costs, that may act as barriers to individual adoption. In a review on the application of diffusion models to renewables by Rao and Kishore (2010) , it has been noticed that renewables' typical characteristics such as low load factor, need for energy storage, small size, high upfront costs create a competitive disadvantage, while Meade and Islam (2015b) suggested that renewable technologies are different from other industrial technological innovations because, in the absence of focused support, they are not convenient from a financial point of view. In this sense, policy measures and incentive mechanisms, such as feed-in tariffs, have been used to stimulate the market. In order to capture the real effect of these measures, the Generalised Bass model (GMB) by Bass et al. (1994) has proven to be an essential modelling tool, allowing to explain a substantial lack of pioneering consumers in RETs adoption and the positive effect exerted by incentives in driving the market (see, in particular, Bunea et al., 2020) . The use of the GBM also allows a more accurate forecasting procedure through an efficient description of the nonlinear trajectory, which, in the case of renewables is often far from being smooth.",

Power production is proportion to the cube of the wind speed at low-to-moderate speeds, and above this is constant at the turbine's rated power. At very high or low wind speeds no power is generated.

More accurate forecasts can be produced by learning the NWP-to-energy relationship from historic data when it is available.

In general, the quantitative comparison among different forecast techniques is challenging, as the factors influencing the performance are numerous: the historical data, the weather forecast, the temporal horizon and resolution, and the installation conditions. A recent review no significant difference between the two deterministic models, with the three-parameter approach being slightly more accurate. Figure 11 shows the daily value of normalised mean absolute error (NMAE%) for 216 days evaluated by using PHANN and three parameters electric circuit. The PHANN hybrid method achieves the best forecasting results, and only a few days of training can provide accurate forecasts. Dolara et al. (2018) analysed the effect of different approaches in the composition of a training data-set for the day-ahead forecasting of PV power production based on NN. In particular, the influence of different data-set compositions on the forecast outcome has been investigated by increasing the size of the training set size and by varying the lengths of the training and validation sets, in order to assess the most effective training method of this machine learning approach. As a general comment on the reported results, it can be stated that a method that employs the same chronologically consecutive samples for training is best suited when the availability of historical data is limited (for example, in newly deployed PV plant), while training based on randomly mixed samples method, appears to be most effective in the case of a greater data availability. Generally speaking, ensembles composed of independent trials are most effective. ",

            "text": "In electrical power systems with renewable energy dependence, the power generators need to be scheduled to supply the system demand (de Queiroz, 2016) . In general, for modeling renewables future behaviour, such as hydro, wind and solar photovoltaics (PV), stochastic scenarios should be included in the scheduling, usually in a dispatch optimisation problem. Due to the complexity and uncertainly associated, this problem is, in general, modeled with time series scenarios and multi-stage stochastic approaches. This subsection aims to emphasise the importance of forecasting with simulation in renewable energy planning, especially in hydroelectric systems. In this context, due to the data spatial and temporal dependence structure, time series models are useful for future scenarios generation. Although the proposal could be forecasting for short-term planning and scheduling, simulation strategies are explored for considering and estimating uncertainty in medium and/or long-term horizons. According to Hipel and McLeod (1994) , stochastic processes of natural phenomena, such as the renewables ones, are, in general, stationary. One of the main features of hydroelectric generation systems is the strong dependence on hydrological regimes. To deal with this task, the literature focuses on two main classes for forecasting/simulation streamflow data: physical and data-driven models . Water resources management for hydropower generation and energy planning is one of the main challenges for decision-makers. At large, the hydrological data are transformed into the so-called affluent natural energy, that is used for scenarios simulation and serve as input for the optimisation algorithms (Oliveira et al., 2015) . The current state-of-the-art models for this proposal are the periodic ones. Hipel and McLeod (1994) (2018) proposed, for wind energy forecasting with spatia-temporal data, a combination of ridge linear quantile regression and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) that enables each data owner to autonomously solve its forecasting problem, while collaborating with the others to improve forecasting accuracy. However, as demonstrated by Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2020a) , the mathematical properties of these algorithms should be carefully analysed in order to avoid privacy breaches (i.e., when a third party recovers the original data without consent).",

The basic concept consists in pricing data as a function of privacy loss, but it can be also pricing data as a function of tangible benefits such as electricity market profit maximization. Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2020b) adapted for renewable energy forecasting the model described in Agarwal et al. (2019) , by considering the temporal nature of the data and relating data price with the extra revenue obtained in the electricity market due to forecasting accuracy improvement. The results showed a benefit in terms of higher revenue resulting from the combination of electricity and data markets. With the advent of peer-to-peer energy markets at the domestic consumer level (Parag and Sovacool, 2016) , smart meter data exchange between peers is also expected to increase and enable collaborative forecasting schemes. For this scenario, Yassine et al.

Since Bjerknes (1904) introduced hydrodynamics and thermodynamics into meteorology, weather prediction has been based on merging physical principles and observational information. Modern weather forecasting is based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) models that rely on accurate estimates of the current state of the climate system, including ocean, atmosphere and land surface. Uncertainty in these estimates is propagated through the NWP model by running the model for an ensemble of perturbed initial states, creating a weather forecast ensemble (Buizza, 2018; Toth and Buizza, 2019) .",

Current NWP model development aims at improving both the grid resolution and the observational information that enters the models (Bannister et al., 2020; Leuenberger et al., 2020) . However, for fixed computational resources, there is a trade-off between grid resolution and ensemble size, with a larger ensemble generally providing a better estimate of the prediction uncertainty. Recent advances furthermore include machine learning approaches to directly model the small-scale processes, in particular cloud processes (see, for example, Gentine et al., 2018; Rasp et al., 2018) .",

A fundamental challenge here is to preserve physical consistency across space, time and variables (see, for example, M\u00f6ller et al., 2013; Schefzik et al., 2013; Heinrich et al., 2020) .

It is expected that, if a forecasting system is capable of reproducing these slowly evolving components, they may also be able to forecast them (Van Schaeybroeck and Vannitsem, 2018) .

Therefore, systems have been designed in order to produce forecasts for up to three days in advance using as input the measured value of concentration and meteorological conditions. These systems can be classified in (i) data-driven models (Carnevale et al., 2016; Stadlober et al., 2018; Corani, 2005) , and (ii) deterministic chemical and transport models (Honor\u00e9 et al., 2007; Manders et al., 2009) . In this section, a brief overview of the application of these systems to the high polluted area of Lombardy region, in Italy, will be presented. Carnevale et al. (2018) compared the results of three different forecasting systems based on neural networks, lazy learning models, and regression trees respectively. A single model has been identified for each monitoring station. In the initial configuration, only the last three PM measurements available were used to produce the forecast. In this configuration, the systems offered reasonable performance, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.6 (lazy learning method) to 0.75 (neural network). The work also demonstrated that the performance of the ensemble of the three systems was better than the best model for each monitoring station.",

To support their decision-making under uncertainty, decision theory (Berger, 1985; Bernardo, 1994; DeGroot, 2004) invokes Bayesian informed decision approaches, which find the most appropriate decision by maximising (or minimising) the expected value of a \"utility function\", thus requiring its definition, together with the estimation of a \"predictive probability\" density (Berger, 1985) due to the fact that utility functions are rarely linear or continuous. Consequently, their expected value does not coincide with the value assumed on the predicted \"deterministic\" expected value. Accordingly, overcoming the classical 18 th century \"mechanistic\" view by resorting into probabilistic forecasting approaches becomes essential.",

At a river section, the future water level provided by a forecast is uncertain and can be described by a Normal distribution with mean 10 meters and standard deviation of 5 meters. Given a dike elevation of 10.5 meters, damages may be expected as zero if water level falls below the dike elevation and linearly growing when level exceeds it with a factor of 10 6 dollars. If one assumes the expect value of forecast as the deterministic prediction to compute the damage the latter will result equal to zero, while if one correctly integrates the damage function times the predictive density the estimated expected damage will results into 6.59 millions of dollars and educated decisions on alerting or not the population or evacuating or not a flood-prone area can be appropriately taken.",

Dengue incidence data show complex nonlinear dynamics with strong seasonality, nonstationarity (changes in dominant periodic components over time) and, sometimes, intermittent dynamics.

Amongst the three forecasting approaches (expectation, extrapolation, and explanation), the majority of the developments were in the field of extrapolative methods. These are considered more objective, easy to use and more likely to obtain better forecast accuracy than the other two approaches (Janssen, 2018). The Lee-Carter mortality methodology (Lee and Carter, 1992 ) and its variants have been one of the most widely used extrapolative methods. Lee-Carter methodology has several advantages: it comprises a simple stochastic model with only one time-varying parameter, it performs relatively well when past trends are linear, and it can forecast a changing age pattern of mortality (Booth and Tickle, 2008) . Extrapolative time series models are also commonly used, such as univariate and multivariate ARIMA modelling. The introduction of stochastic time series models has the advantage of obtaining a forecast probability distribution rather than a deterministic point forecast and, also, enable the determination of forecast intervals (Booth and Tickle, 2008) . Janssen (2018) presents a review of the advances in mortality forecasting and possible challenges for future research. 135 An important use of mortality forecasts for those individuals at age over 60 is in the pension and insurance industries, whose profitability and solvency crucially rely on accurate mortality forecasts to adequately hedge longevity risks (see, e.g., Shang and Haberman, 2020a,b) . Longevity risk is a potential systematic risk attached to the increasing life expectancy of annuitants, which can eventually result in a higher payout ratio than expected (Crawford et al., 2008) . When a person retires, an optimal way of guaranteeing one individual's financial income in retirement is to purchase an annuity (Yaari, 1965 ).",

Scholars like Mueller (2009a,b) and Pinker (2011 Pinker ( , 2018 claim that sociological arguments and all statistics suggest we live in better times, while others like Gray (2015a,b) and Mann (2018) maintain that those statistics are often partial and misused, the derived theories weak, and that war and violence are not declining but only being transformed.

Armed conflicts show long inter-arrival times, therefore a relative peace of a few decades means nothing statistically (Cirillo and Taleb, 2016b) . Moreover, the distribution of war casualties is extremely fat-tailed (Clauset, 2018; Clauset and Gleditsch, 2018) , often with a tail exponent \u03be > 1 (Cirillo and Taleb, 2016b) , indicating a possibly infinite mean, i.e., a tremendously erratic and unforeseeable phenomenon. An only apparently infinitemean phenomenon though (Cirillo and Taleb, 2019) , because no single war can kill more than the entire world population, therefore a finite upper bound exists, and all moments are necessarily finite, even if difficult to estimate. Extreme value theory (Embrechts et al., 2013) can thus be used to correctly model tail risk and make prudential forecasts (with many caveats like in Scharpf et al., 2014) , while avoiding naive extrapolations (Taleb et al., 2020) .",

To that end, FSSs must (i) elaborate accurate, efficient, and automatic statistical forecasting methods, (ii) enable users to effectively incorporate their judgment, (iii) allow the users to track and interact with the whole forecasting procedure, and (iv) be easily customised based on the context of the company.",

As an example for a strategic forecasting problems: where should data centres be placed? In what region of a country and in what geographic region? As an example for tactical forecasting problems, these must take into account energy prices (see Section 3.4.3) and also, classic supply chain problems (Larson et al., 2001) . After all, physical servers and data centres are what enables the cloud and these must be ordered and have a lead-time. The careful incorporation of life cycles of compute types is important (e.g., both the popularity of certain machine types and the duration of a hard disk). Analogous to the retail sector, cloud resource providers have tactical cold-start forecasting problems. For example, while GPU or TPU instances are still relatively recent but already well estabilished, the demand for quantum computing is still to be decided. In the class of operational forecasting problems, cloud provider can choose to address short-term resource forecasting problems for applications such as adding resources to applications predictively and make this available to customers (Barr, 2018) . The forecasting of the customer's spend for cloud computing is another example. For serverless infrastructure, a number of servers is often maintained in a ready state (Gias and Casale, 2020) and the forecasting of the size of this 'warmpool' is another example.",

Cold start problems exist elsewhere for example. What potentially stands out in cloud computing forecasting problems may be the scale (e.g., there are a lot of physical servers available), the demands on the response time and granularity of a forecast and the degree of automation. Consider the operational forecasting problem of predictive scaling. Unlike in retail demand forecasting, no human operator will be able to control this and response times to forecasts are in seconds. It will be interesting to see whether approaches based on reinforcement learning (Gamble and Gao, 2018) can partially replace the need to have forecasting models (Januschowski et al., 2018b) .",

For example, they over-forecast time series labelled as 'profits' but under-forecast the same series labelled as 'losses' (Harvey and Reimers, 2013) . Second, they add noise to their forecasts so that a sequence of forecasts looks similar to ('represents') the data series (Harvey, 1995) . Third, they damp trends in the data (Eggleton, 1982; Harvey and Reimers, 2013; Lawrence and Makridakis, 1989) . Fourth, forecasts from un-trended independent series do not lie on the series mean but between the last data point and the mean; this is what we would expect if people perceived a positive autocorrelation in the series (Reimers and Harvey, 2011) . These last two effects can be explained in terms of the under-adjustment that characterises use of anchor-and-adjust heuristics: forecasters anchor on the last data point and adjust towards the trend line or mean -but do so insufficiently. However, in practice, this under-adjustment may be appropriate because real linear trends do become damped and real series are more likely to contain a modest autocorrelation than be independent .

The first change was to set 'no adjusting' as default in the program. This would make 'no change' the default and 'change' the more effortful option. The second change is programming the FSS so that it would ask for the adjustment size, if the forecaster indicated a willingness to adjust. A third implementation was the addition of an 'explanation' feature: when the forecaster wanted to adjust the forecast, they were explicitly asked to document the reason for the change. The default option and the explanation feature were successful in heightening the acceptance of the statistical forecast and thus improving the forecast accuracy. Asking for the size of the adjustment was not. Other ways of influencing forecaster's behaviour with the FSS is to provide guidance or restriction (Goodwin et al., 2011) . They set up an experiment such that one group received 'guidance' in the form of information, and the other group was 'restricted' in what they could do. The latter group could, for instance, not make small adjustments, which have previously been found to be more damaging than they are helpful (Fildes et al., 2009) . However, the researchers found that neither restrictiveness nor guidance was successful in improving accuracy, and both were met with resistance by the forecasters.",

A way of automatically combining judgment and statistics was investigated by Baecke et al. (2017) , who compared normal judgmental adjustment with what they term \"integrative judgment\". In brief, integrative judgment takes the judgmental information into account as a predictive variable in the forecasting model and generates a new forecast.

When forecasting a discrete uncertainty with only two possible outcomes (e.g., a loan with be defaulted on or not, a customer will click on an ad or not), the Brier score assigns a score of \u2212(1 \u2212 p) 2 , where p is the probability forecast reported that the event will occurs. The greater the probability reported for an event that occurs, the higher the score the forecast receives. Over multiple forecasts, better forecasters will tend to have higher average Brier scores.

            "text": "With respect to the forecaster and her audience, issues such as competence, trust, respect, and optimism have been recently examined as a means to improve uncertainty communication. Fiske and Dupree (2014) discusses how forecast recipients often infer apparent intent and competence from the uncertainty provided and use these to judge trust and respect. This suggests that the amount of uncertainty information provided should be audience dependent (Politi et al., 2007; Han et al., 2009 When dealing with the public, experts assert that communicating uncertainty helps users understand forecasts better and avoid a false sense of certainty (Morss et al., 2008) . Research however shows that hesitation to include forecast uncertainty exists among experts because it provides an opening for criticism and the possibility of misinterpration by the public (Fischhoff, 2012) . This is more challenging when the public has prior beliefs on a topic or trust has not been established. Uncertainty can be used by individuals to reinforce a motivated-reasoning bias that allows them to \"see what they want to see\" (Dieckmann et al., 2017 As seen throughout 2020, (leisure) tourism demand is very sensitive to external shocks such as natural and human-made disasters, making tourism products and services extremely perishable (Frechtling, 2001) .",

A forecaster should include this information in their own set of relevant information at the forecast origin (L\u00fctkepohl, 2005) , if taking it into account results in an improved forecast accuracy, with web-based leading indicators thus effectively Granger-causing (Granger, 1969) actual tourism demand.",

In addition, arrival data may also exhibit interday and intraday dependencies, with different time periods within the same day, or across days within the same week, showing strong levels of autocorrelation (Tanir and Booth, 1999; Brown et al., 2005b; Shen and Huang, 2005) . Call arrivals may also be heteroscedastic with variance at least proportional to arrival counts (Taylor, 2008) , and overdispersed under a Poisson assumption having variance per time period typically much larger than its expected value (Jongbloed and Koole, 2001; Avramidis et al., 2004; Steckley et al., 2005) . These properties have implications for various approaches to modelling and forecasting call arrivals. The first family of methods are time series methods requiring no distributional assumptions. Early studies employed auto regressive moving average (ARMA) models (Andrews and Cunningham, 1995; Tandberg et al., 1995; Xu, 1999; Antipov and Meade, 2002) , exponential smoothing (Bianchi et al., 1993 (Bianchi et al., , 1998 , fast Fourier transforms (Lewis et al., 2003) , and regression (Tych et al., 2002) . The first meth- ods capable of capturing multiple seasonality were evaluated by Taylor (2008) and included double seasonal exponential smoothing (Taylor, 2003b) and multiplicative double seasonal ARMA (SARMA). Since then several advanced time series methods have been developed and evaluated (Taylor, 2010; De Livera et al., 2011; Taylor and Snyder, 2012) , including artificial neural networks (Mill\u00e1n-Ruiz and Hidalgo, 2013; Pacheco et al., 2009; and models for density forecasting (Taylor, 2012) .",

Shen and Huang (2005) and Shen and Huang (2008a) use the same technique to achieve dimensionality reduction of arrival data, and to create a forecasting model that provides both interday forecasts of call volume, and an intraday updating mechanism. Several further studies have extended the basic SVD approach to realise further modelling innovations, for example, to forecast call arrival rate profiles and generate smooth arrival rate curves (Shen et al., 2007; Shen and Huang, 2008b; Shen, 2009) . A more comprehensive coverage of different forecasting approaches for call arrival rate and volume can be found in a recent review paper by Ibrahim et al. (2016) .",

They can also be sorted by when they are performed; and new methods, such as social media surveillance, are also emerging (Huberty, 2015; Ceron et al., 2016) . Probabilistic (representative) polls are the most commonly used instrument to gauge public opinions. The progressive higher impact of non-sampling errors (coverage issues, non-response bias, measurement error: Biemer, 2010) is, however, severely testing this approach. Despite this, as Kennedy et al. (2017) show in a recent study covering 86 countries and more than 500 elections, polls are still powerful and robust predictors of election outcomes after adjustments (see, also, Jennings et al., 2020) . The increasing need of post-sampling adjustments of probabilistic samples has led to a resurgence of interest in non-probabilistic polls (Pav\u00eda and Larraz, 2012; Wang et al., 2015b; Elliott and Valliant, 2017) , abandoned in favour of probabilistic sampling in 1936, when Gallup forecasted Roosevelt's triumph over Landon using a small representative sample despite Literacy Digest failing to do so with a sample of near 2.5 million responses (Squire, 1988) .",

Hundreds of millions of people globally watch events like the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup -but such interest is conditioned on anticipation, a forecast that something interesting will happen.

However, there are a few themes that have emerged in the extant literature as characteristics of megaprojects that should be skilfully managed to provide a guideline for the successful planning and construction of megaprojects (Fiori and Kovaka, 2005; Flyvbjerg, 2007; Sanderson, 2012) . Turner and Zolin (2012) even claim that we cannot even properly define what success is. They argue that we need to reliable scales in order to predict multiple perspectives by multiple stakeholders over multiple time frames -so definitely a very difficult long term problem. This could be done via a set of leading performance indicators that will enable managers of Megaprojects to forecast during project execution how various stakeholders will perceive success months or even years into the operation. At the very early stages of a project's lifecycle, a number of decisions must been taken and are of a great importance for the performance and successful deliverables/outcomes. Flyvbjerg (2007) stress the importance of the front-end considerations particularly for Megaprojects Failure to account for unforeseen events frequently lead to cost overruns. Litsiou et al. (2019) suggest that forecasting the success of megaprojects is particularly a challenging and critical task due to the characteristics of such projects. Megaproject stakeholders typically implement impact assessments and/or cost benefit Analysis tools (Litsiou et al., 2019) . As Makridakis et al. (2010) suggested, judgemental forecasting is suitable where quantitative data is limited, and the level of uncertainty is very high; elements that we find in megaprojects. By comparing the performance of three judgemental methods, unaided judgement, semi-structured analogies (sSA), and interaction groups (IG), used by a group of 69 semi-experts, Litsiou et al. (2019) found that, the use of sSA outperforms unaided judgment in forecasting performance. The difference is amplified further when pooling of analogies through IG is introduced.",

Ranitidine is an alternative active principle introduced by Glaxo in 1981 and was found to have far-improved tolerability and a longer-lasting action. The main effect in delayed competition is that the first compound spread fast but was suddenly outperformed by the new one principle that modified its stand-alone regime. Guseo and Mortarino (2012) give some statistical comparisons with the restricted model Krishnan-Bass-Kummar Diachronic model (KBKD) by Krishnan et al. (2000) . Previous results were improved with the UCRCD model in Guseo and Mortarino (2014) by considering a decomposition of word-of-mouth (WOM) effects in two parts: within-brand and cross-brand contributions. The new active compound exploited a large cross-brand WOM and a positive within-brand effect. After the start of competition, cimetidine experienced a negative WOM effect from its own adopters and benefited from the increase of the category's market potential driven by the antagonist. Forecasting is more realistic with the UCRCD approach.",

Furthermore, a significant number of papers is fairly recent which indicates that there are many open avenues of future research on these topics, and in particular for applied forecasting. The literature on the latter connection can consider many different aspects in modelling as we illustrate below.

The ground-truth quality evaluation has been performed for each shot of coffee based on three well-known quality variables selected by domain experts and measured by specific sensors: the extraction time, the average flow rate, and the espresso volume. An exhaustive set of more than a thousand coffees has been produced to train a model able to forecast the effect of non-optimal values on the espresso quality.

If the amount of coffee ground is low, the ground is coarse, and the pressure is high, then we can forecast a low-quality coffee due to excessive flow rate.

But if we are dealing with something that is going to stay with us for a long time (e.g., the Internet or a smoking habit), then one should not fit cumulative numbers. At times this distinction may not be so obvious. For example at the appearance of COVID-19 many people (often amateurs) began fitting S curves to the cumulative number of infections. Some of them were rewarded because indeed the diffusion of the virus in some countries behaved accordingly (Debecker and Modis, 2020) .

To compensate for this bias the user must explore several fits with different weights on the data points during the calculation of the \u03c7 2 . He or she should then keep the answer that gives the highest ceiling for the S curve (most often obtained by weighting more heavily the recent historical data points).

Moreover, the early Makridakis competitions showed the importance of forecast combinations in increasing predictive accuracy.

Machine learning approaches that focused on each series independently performed poorly against statistical benchmarks, such as Theta, Damped exponential smoothing or simple averages of exponential smoothing models. However, the best two performing submissions in the M4 competition (Smyl, 2020; Montero-Manso et al., 2020) used neural network and machine learning algorithms towards utilising cross-learning. So, the main learning outcome from the M4 competition is that, if utilised properly, machine learning can increase the forecasting performance.

Determining what to study is another decision requiring elaborate predictions about the demand for future jobs decades away. In the business world, firms must decide/forecast how many products to manufacture, the price they should be sold, how much money to spend on advertising and promotion, how much and in what type of new technologies to invests and a plethora of other future-oriented decisions requiring both predictions and assessing their inevitable uncertainty. Whether we like it or not, we have no choice but making these forecasts to benefit as much as possible from their value, knowing perfectly well that all predictions are uncertain and many turn out to be wrong. The Pervasiveness of Uncertainty: Apart from some areas of hard sciences, all other forecasts are uncertain and must be accompanied with a measure of its magnitude, expressed as a prediction interval, or as a probability distribution around the most likely forecast. Although the value and usage of forecasts is clear, that of uncertainty is not. Worse, it becomes an unwelcome source of anxiety whose usefulness is misunderstood. Executives want to know the exact sales of their firm for next month to set up their production schedule. Instead, they are given prediction intervals (PIs) around such forecast and told that most of the time, sales will be within this interval, assuming that the fluctuations follow some distributional assumptions. They argue that forecasting must decrease, not amplify, uncertainty and that the PIs are too wide and 'uninformative' to be used for making practical business decisions. The trouble is that these PIs are based on past fluctuations and present the best estimation of future uncertainty, even if they seem too wide. Worse, empirical research has shown that they are actually too narrow, underestimating uncertainty often considerably.",

            "text": "Assessing Uncertainty and Dealing with its Implied Risks: Uncertainty entails risks, requiring action to minimise their negative consequences. There are two kinds of uncertainty that can be illustrated by the commuting example. The first relates to fluctuations in the commuting time under normal driving conditions when there are no serious accidents, road works or major snowstorms. Such fluctuations are small and can be captured by a normal curve that allows to balance the risk of arriving earlier or later than the desired time. In the opposite case, uncertainty is fat-tailed and hard to estimate, as delays can be substantial depending upon the seriousness of the accident or that of the snowstorm while the risk of being early to work is smaller than being late. Moreover, such risk is substantially different when going to the airport to catch a flight, requiring starting much earlier than the average time it takes to go to the airport to minimise the risk of missing the flight. More Accurate Ways of Forecasting and Assessing Uncertainty: Extensive empirical research, including forecasting competitions, has shown that systematic approaches improve the accuracy of forecasting and the correct assessment of uncertainty resulting in substantial benefits when compared to ad-hoc judgmental alternatives . The biggest advantage of such approaches is their ability to identify and estimate, in a mathematically optimal manner, past patterns and relationships that are subsequently extrapolated to predict their continuation, avoiding the over optimism and wishful thinking associated with judgmental approaches. At the same time, it must be clear that the accuracy of the forecasts and the correctness of uncertainty will depend on the established patterns/relationship not changing much during the forecasting horizon. Using Benchmarks to Evaluate the Value of Forecasting: The accuracy of the forecasts and the correct assessment of uncertainty must be judged not on their own but in comparison to some simple, readily available benchmarks. In stock market forecasts, for instance, the accuracy of predictions is compared to that of today's price used as the forecast for future periods. Empirical comparisons have shown that such a benchmark beats the great majority of professional forecasters, hence Buffet's advice in the epigram for his wife to invest in a low-cost index fund that selects stocks randomly. In weather forecasting, meteorologists are judged by the improvement of their forecasts over the naive prediction that tomorrow's weather will be the same as today.",

Such methods do not possess any prophetic powers, they simply extrapolate established patterns and relationships to predict the future and assess its uncertainty. Their biggest advantage is their objectivity and ability for optimal extrapolation. Their biggest disadvantages are: (i) the patterns and the relationships must remain fairly constant during the forecasting phase for the forecasts to be accurate, and (ii) uncertainty must not be fat-tailed so it can be measured quantitatively.",

However, none of these databases supports advanced analysis, such as modelling, machine learning algorithms and forecasting. Additional considerations are therefore required in further processing time series on distributed systems. Mirko and Kantelhardt (2013) developed the Hadoop.TS library for processing large-scale time series by creating a time series bucket. Li et al. (2014) designed an index pool serving as a data structure for assigning index keys to time series entries, allowing time series data to be sequentially stored on HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System: Shvachko et al., 2010)for MapReduce(Dean and Ghemawat, 2008) jobs.Chen et al. (2019a) proposed a data compression and abstraction method for large-scale time series to facilitate the periodicity-based time series prediction in a parallel manner.The evolution of the algorithms for efficiently forecasting big data time series on distributed systems is largely motivated by a wide range of applications including meteorology, energy, finance, transportation and farming(Galicia et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2019a;Hong and Pinson, 2019;Sommer et al., 2020).",

(2013) explored the 'content' effects of scenarios where through the narration either a bleak/negative future (a pessimistic scenario) or a bright/positive future (an optimistic scenario) was portrayed. On a demand forecasting context for mobile phones, the participants first received time-series data, model-based forecasts and then asked to generate point and interval forecasts as well as provide a confidence measure. With respect to the existence of scenarios, there were four conditions where the participants may receive: (i) no scenarios, (ii) optimistic scenarios, (iii) pessimistic scenarios, and (iv) both scenarios. Findings indicate that decision makers respond differently to optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. Receiving optimistic scenarios resulted in making larger adjustments to the model-based forecasts. At the same time, led to an increased confidence of the participants in their predictions. On the other hand, participants who received negative scenarios tend to lower their predictions the most among the four groups. An intriguing finding was the balancing effect of scenarios on the interval forecast symmetry. The lower interval bounds were adjusted upwards the most towards the centre-point of the interval (i.e., model-based predictions) when optimistic scenarios were received. Similarly, the upper bounds were adjusted downwards the most towards the centre-point of the interval in the presence of pessimistic scenarios. 73 This subsection was written by M.

Preventive maintenance consists of maintenance actions that are triggered after a scheduled number of units as cycles, kilometers, flights, etc. To schedule the fixed time between two preventive maintenance actions, the Weibull distribution is commonly used(Baptista et al., 2018). The drawbacks of preventive maintenance are related to the replacement of components that still have a remaining useful life; therefore, early interventions imply a waste of resources and too late actions could imply catastrophic failures.Additionally, the preventive intervention itself could be a source of failures too. Finally, predictive maintenance (PdM) complements the previous ones and, essentially, uses predictive tools to determine when actions are necessary(Carvalho et al., 2019).

The approach fits a model to each period of the historical data and the residuals are simulated to generate new future versions of the time series, considered stationary. Among many others, important variations and alternative proposals to PAR with bootstrap procedures, Bayesian dynamic linear models, spatial information and copulas versions are detailed in Souza et al. (2012), Marangon Lima et al. (2014), Lohmann et al. (2016) and de Almeida Pereira and Veiga (2019), respectively. It is worth considering the need for renewables portfolio simulation. This led Pinheiro Neto et al. (2017) to propose a model to integrate hydro, wind and solar power scenarios for Brazilian data. For the Eastern United States, Shahriari and Blumsack (2018) add to the literature on the wind, solar and blended portfolios over several spatial and temporal scales. For China, Liu et al. (2020) proposed a multivariable model, with a unified framework, to simulate wind and PV scenarios to compensate hydropower generation. The key challenges and trends for forecasting with simulation in a portfolio of renewable energy planning are still related to the inclusion of exogenous variables, such as climate, meteorological, calendar and economic ones. 3.4.12. Collaborative forecasting in the energy sector 126 As mentioned in section 3.4.8, the combination of geographically distributed time series data, in a collaborative forecasting (or data sharing) framework, can deliver significant improvements in the forecasting accuracy of each individual renewable energy power plant. The same is valid for hierarchical load forecasting (Hong et al., 2019) and energy price forecasting (see section 3.4.3). However, this data might have different owners, which are unwilling to share their data due to the following reasons: (i) personal or business sensitive information, (ii) lack of understanding about which data can and cannot be shared, and (iii) lack of information about economic (and technical) benefits from data sharing. In order to tackle these limitations, recent research in energy time series forecasting is exploring two alternative (and potentially complementary) pathways: (i) privacy-preserving analytics, and (ii) data markets. The role of privacy-preserving techniques applied collaborative forecasting is to combine time series data from multiple data owners in order to improve forecasting accuracy and keep data private at the same time. For solar energy forecasting, Berdugo et al. (2011) described a method based on local and global analog-search that uses solar power time series from neighbouring sites, where only the timestamps and normalised weights (based on similarity) are exchanged and not the time series data.

Proper scoring rules for quantiles are developed in Jose and Winkler (2009). When forecasts are used for decision-making, it is beneficial if the scoring rule used relates in some manner to the decision problem itself. In certain settings, the connection of the scoring rule to the decision context is straight forward. For example, Jose et al.

Each equation casts each variable as a function of lagged values of all the variables in the system. Contemporaneous values of system variables are not included in VAR models for identification purposes; some set of identifying restrictions are required, usually based on economic theory, and when imposed the resulting model is known as a structural VAR model.VAR models introduce significantly greater levels of parameterisation of relationships, which increases the level of estimation uncertainty. At the same time VAR models afford the forecaster a straightforward way to generate forecasts of a range of variables, a problem when forecasting with many variables.As with autoregressive methods, VAR models can capture a significant amount of variation in data series that are autocorrelated, and hence VAR methods can be useful as baseline forecasting devices.

The VaR gives the percentile of the conditional distribution, and the corresponding ES is the expected value of response variable conditional on it lying below its VaR.Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models are the workhorse of modern macroeconomics in both academia and policy-making institutions (for details, see: Paccagnini, 2017;Christiano et al., 2018).For example, the European Central Bank uses the New Area-Wide Model introduced by Warne et al. (2010) and the Federal Reserve Board has created the Estimated, Dynamic, Optimisation-based model (FRB/EDO) as discussed in Chung et al. (2010). Developed as a response to Lucas (1976) critique of structural macroeconometrics models, DSGEs introduced microfundations to describe business cycle fluctuations. Initially calibrated, estimated DSGEs have been employed in shocks identification and forecasting horseraces for the last 15 years. Estimation became possible thanks to computational progress and adoption of Bayesian techniques (for technical details, see:An and Schorfheide, 2007;Herbst and Schorfheide, 2016; Fern\u00e1ndez-  Villaverde and Guerr\u00f3n-Quintana, 2020). Bayesian estimation allows for attributing prior distributions, instead of calibrating, and computing the posterior distribution for selected model parameters as well as drawing from predictive density.

As a result, there are thousands of forecasting papers in the field of NNs in financial forecasting. However, caution is needed in interpretation of their results. NNs are sensitive to the choice of their hyperparameters. For a simple MLP, a practitioner needs to set (among others) the number and type of inputs, the number of hidden nodes, the momentum, the learning rate, the number of epochs and the batch size. This complexity in NN modelling leads inadvertently to the data snooping bias. In other words, a researcher that experiments long enough with the parameters of a NN topology can have excellent in-sample and out-of-sample results for a series. However, this does not mean that the results of his NN can be generalised. This issue has led the related literature to be stained by studies cannot be extended in different samples.",

If trust translates into accepting guidance for the future while acknowledging and tolerating potential forecast errors, then both the providers and users of forecasts need to work as partners towards shared goals and expectations. Important pathways to accomplish this include (i) honest communication of forecaster's track record and relevant accuracy targets (\u00d6nkal et al., 2019), (ii) knowledge sharing (\u00d6zer et al., 2011; Renzl, 2008) and transparency of forecasting methods, assumptions and data (\u00d6nkal et al., 2019), (iii) communicating forecasts in the correct tone and jargonfree language to appeal to the user audience",

For instance,Rebollo and Balakrishnan (2014) apply random forests to predict air traffic delays of the National Airspace System using both temporal and network delay states as covariates.Manna et al. (2017) develop a statistical model based on a gradient boosting decision tree to predict arrival and departure delays, using the data taken from the United States Department of Transportation (Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2020). Rodr\u00edguez-Sanz et al. (2019) develop a Bayesian Network model to predict flight arrivals and delays using the radar data, aircraft historical performance and local environmental data. There are also a few studies that have focused on generating probabilistic forecasts of arrivals and departures, moving beyond point estimates. For example, Tu et al. (2008) develop a predictive system for estimating flight departure delay distributions using flight data from Denver International Airport. The system employs the smoothing spline method to model seasonal trends and daily propagation patterns.
