            "text": "Introduction Nowadays, congenital tumours can be successfully diagnosed antenatally by means of ultrasound. Some of them may be an ultrasonic marker of foetal chromosomopathy. Depending upon their morphology and volume, some can be treated surgically immediately after birth, but in many cases the outcome is poor. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and types of congenital tumours at autopsy of aborted foetuses, stillbirths and neonates that died within 28 days after birth.

The aim of this study was to estimate the role of villous tree immaturity in the development of intrauterine hypoxia. Materials and methods 337 placentas from singleton pregnancies were investigated. According to ultrasound and doppler velocime-try data, Apgar score, placentas were divided into groups with chronic hypoxia (132), IUGR (70), acute intrauterine hypoxia (64), from normal pregnancies (71). Estimation of the degree of maturity according to gestational age was made on routine histological slides. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF) concentration in placental tissue homogenates were investigated by ELISA method in 40 placentas. Results The frequency of placental immaturity was 2-fold higher in placentas with hypoxia in compare with control group. Preterm maturation of placental tree accompany with severe foetal hypoxia, a very high mortality and morbidity. Concentration of VEGF in placental tissue was elevated in placentas with terminal villi deficiency, and concentration of PlGF was elevated in placentas with synchronous immaturity. Conclusion Due to importance of the placental maldevelopment it is necessary to devise methods of its early diagnostics and investigate mechanisms of villous tree development. Determining of VEGF and PlGF may be useful for this purpose.",

HH is characterized by increased iron absorption and iron deposits in various organs. HH patients may develop liver and pancreas cirrhosis, primary liver cancer, diabetes mellitus, and cardiomyopathy. In the majority of cases, HH is caused by mutations of the HFE-gene on chromosome 6p. HFE encodes an MHC class-I gene, a putative negative regulator of iron uptake. Three HFE mutation are common, C282Y, H63D and S65C. Patients with a homozygous C282Y genotype most often endure a severe clinical course, whereas homozygotes for H63D may develop mild forms of the disease. Heterozygotes are usually symptom-free, but show elevated serum ferritin levels. It has been speculated that secondary iron overload (heavy alcohol, chronic hepatitis, ?-thalassemia) may be a critical co-factor in those heterozygotes that develop symptoms of HH. HH not associated with HFE mutations is much less common. Within this heterogeneous group of non-HFE HH, three subtypes have been attributed to genetic alterations. Juvenile hemochromatosis (HFE2) is a rare but severe disorder mapped to chromosome 1q. HFE3 has recently been mapped to the transferring receptor 2 gene (TfR2) on chromosome 7q22. HFE4 follows an autosomal dominant trait and is associated with mutations of the ferroportin 1 gene (SLC11A3) on chromosome 2. Except for juvenile hemochromatosis, HFE, HFE3 and HFE4 are amenable to mutation analysis. The advent of modern high throughput technologies such as denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) has sparked clinical mutation screening programs, which also include screening of patients suspected to be affected by HH. In addition, DHPLC-based mutation screening can also be performed using archival formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissues (FFPE). We present here results from HFE-analyses of FFPE from autopsy cases using DHPLC and direct sequencing.",

During further development, NCAM can still be detected on epithelial cells of comma and Sshaped bodies as well as on interstitial mesenchymal cells. During maturation of the fetal kidney NCAM gradually disappears from all epithelial structures and is confined to small areas of interstitial medullary cells. In the adult murine kidney NCAM expression is virtually absent. Materials and methods In the present study NCAM expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blots in adult human kidneys, including healthy kidneys and kidneys with different glomerular diseases associated with incipient interstitial fibrosis (IF). NCAM positive cells were characterized by triple immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against human NCAM combined with a panel of antibodies against neurofilaments, a smooth muscle actin (aSMA), HLA class II, CD133 and CD34, and DAPI for nuclei staining. Digital pictures from every fluorescence channel were taken and superimposed for the specific staining using the Analysis DOKUTM software from Soft Imaging Systems. Results In adult human kidneys, NCAM expression was restricted to rare interstitial cells with a dendritic morphology, long cytoplasmatic extensions and elongated nuclei, which were localized predominantly in the outer medulla. In comparison to healthy kidneys, the number of NCAM-positive interstitial cells increased in the initial phases of IF in different forms of glomerulonephritis. Western blot analysis of renal tissues with incipient IF showed the exclusive expression of the 140 kDa isoform of NCAM; other isoforms were not detectable. Staining with antibodies against neurofilaments clearly differentiated nerve cells from NCAM-positive interstitial cells, which are neurofilament negative. They are also aSMA negative, though the number of the aSMA+ cells increased at the early stages of IF. However, some of the NCAM-positive cells clearly express the stem cell markers CD133 and CD34. Conclusion These data indicate that a subpopulation of NCAMpositive interstitial cells may be renal progenitor cells, which can participate in the initial phases of IF.",

Transfusion 2001; 41:419 Introduction The aim of our demonstration is to call attention to a unique pediatric case with as yet unknown ultrastructural changes in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Case report The full-term female patient -3100 g/49 cm -has been developing well with the exception of early (intrauterine?) unilateral intraocular hemorrhage, which necessitated the enucleation of the bulbus at the age of 1 month. Nine months later, varicose enlargement of the left saphena vein was observed, and microscopic hematuria was detected. Later selective proteinuria and mild hypertension was found. At the age of 1 year an open renal biopsy was performed. Light microscopy showed thick-walled and dilated capillaries of glomerular tufts. Collagen IV staining demonstrated corrugated positivity in the GBM, also seen in COL IV alpha 1 chain. Chains alpha 3 and 5 appeared normal. Immunofluorescence gave only strong global IgM positivity. Electron microscopy showed peculiar mostly circular splitting of the GBM lamina densa with inclusions of small amorphous densities as well as of some remnants of cellular organelles. Analogous changes were observed in adjacent arterioles. At present, the 6 year-old child with signs of somatic underdevelopment is being treated for mild hyperazotemia, anemia and renal hypertension. Her body shows some asymmetry, the skin is thin, pink, but no areas of hyperextensibility are seen as well as any hypermobility of joints. NMR investigation of the brain disclosed a slowly growing mass in the left thalamus. Conclusion The classification of the case among connective tissue disorders is difficult, type IV of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome seems to be the closest.",

Mature podocytes, highly specialized cells with a complex cellular structure (interdigitating foot processes) leave cell cycle and may undergo nuclear division, but not cytokinesis, because this would involve the breakdown of the actin cytoskeleton. It has been recognized that mesangial cells proliferate and accumulate matrix in re-sponse to certain forms of injury. The aim of the current study was to elucidate the role of CDKI expression in human glomerular diseases. Material and methods The analysis was performed on 4 groups of renal biopsies (every consisting of 10 cases): minimal change disease (MCD), membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), mesangioproliferative proliferative glomerulonephritis: IgA (IgAN) and IgM nephropathy (IgMN). We examined the expression of p27, p21, Ki 67 and PCNA by immunohistochemistry. Adult nephrectomy specimens (N=5) without evidence of glomerular disease served as controls. Morphometric analysis was additionally done in MCD, IgAN and IgMN cases. Color sampling was performed to extract \"brown\" nuclei stained for p27 and all nuclei of glomerular cells. Then the number of segmented \"brown\" nuclei was calculated per area of glomerular profiles and related to the number of all nuclei. Results Immunostaining for p27 was abundant in normal podocytes and some mesangial cells. There was no evidence of p21 and proliferation markers Ki 67 and PCNA in normal glomeruli. In MCD and MGN expression did not change. In contrast there was a marked decrease in staining intensity for p27 in mesangial cells in patients with IgAN and IgMN. The ratio of stained for p27 nuclei was 56.1% and 39.1% for MCD and IgAN, IgMN group, respectively (p=0.03). Interestingly also podocytes focally -in sclerotic portions of glomeruli -revealed a marked decrease of p27. This loss of immunostaining occurred predominantly in mesangial cells and podocytes expressing Ki 67 and PCNA. This was accompanied by the de novo nuclear immunostaining for p21. Conclusion The decrease in p27 level is required to induce podocyte and mesangial cell proliferation. Also the increase of p21 was observed. Thus changes in cell cycle regulatory molecules play central role in determining the renal response to injury and may underlie the development of progressive glomerulosclerosis. Understanding mechanisms regulating cell proliferation may target future therapies on these molecules. comprised 9 microhaematuric patients. The thinning was global in 5 patients, and segmental in 4. The third cohort contained 2 nonhaematuric patients who had a globally thinned GBM and focal proliferative lupus GN or minimal change NP, respectively. In summary, 19 cases of global TBMNP (234 + 19 nm; controls: 334 + 43 nm; p<.0000), and 12 cases of segmental TBMNP (299 + 21 nm; p=0.02) were verified. Conclusion TBMNP manifests with either a globally or a segmentally thinned GBM. TBMNP is not infrequently associated with other glomerular diseases. The clinical and morphologic data should be considered simultaneously when the diagnosis of TBMNP is made. Supported by OTKA T-038271(Budapest, Hungary) grant to I.B.",

These are associated with increased expression of genes previously studied by semi-quantitative immunohistologic detection of an individual gene product. The aim of this study was to perform a simultaneous quantitative comparison of expression of genes tentatively relevant to pathogenesis of LGN. Material and methods Renal tissue samples, fresh frozen (18) and formalin-fixed (8), obtained by percutaneous biopsy of 18 patients with LGN (WHO class II, III and IV) were used. Formalinfixed zero transplant biopsies served as controls. From 5 \u00b5m thick sections, 25 glomeruli were laser-microdissected, RNA was extracted and transcribed. A real-time, quantitative PCR analysis was performed using VCAM-1, fractalkine as markers of inflammation, IL-6, PDGF-\u00dfR as markers of proliferation, Bax, Fas ligand and TNF-R1 as regulators of apoptosis and \u00df-actin as housekeeping gene. Results Frozen biopsies allowed detection of all genes; formalinfixed only of some. There was no correlation between levels of gene expression and age, sex, proteinuria or activity/chronicity indexes. WHO class II cases showed increased levels of VCAM-1, PDGF-\u00dfR and Bax but not fractalkine as compared to controls. WHO class III and IV cases showed higher expression of fractalkine, IL-6 and PDGF-\u00dfR than WHO class II cases. In WHO class III cases, IL-6, and fractalkine levels were clearly, while Bax levels were slightly higher than in WHO class IV cases. Conclusions 1. Real-time quantitative PCR is useful for a simultaneous analysis of gene expression in frozen samples of human renal biopsies. 2. In this limited study, class II lesions, as expected, showed lower expression of genes in comparison with classes III and IV. However, class III lesions seemed to exhibit higher expression levels of genes involved in proliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration and apoptosis regulation compared to class IV, possibly relating to a different pathogenesis of those two classes.",

They were studied by immunohistochemistry for the presence of ret/PTC and p53 mutant protein. Normal tissues from 74 cases served as controls. Results 5.4% normal thyroid tissue, 18% follicular adenomas, 22.7% nodular hyperplasia cases and 71.7% papillary carcinomas expressed ret/PTC mutation. Ret/PTC expression in papillary carcinoma was not associated with coexistence of nodular hyperplasia lesion. P53 is expressed by 17% of papillary carcinoma. No association was found between p53 expression of nodular hyperplasia with or without coexisting papillary carcinoma. p53, not ret/PTC was an excellent predictor of tumour lymph node metastasis and capsular invasion. It is also a significant prognosticator of survival outcome. Conclusion Ret/PTC mutation is highly prevalent in local papillary carcinoma, indicating a significant role in the pathogenesis of this tumour; with no apparent role in tumour behaviour and survival outcome. P53 on the other hand appear to be a significant factor in the latter events. The two genes appear to act in two different pathways; the former being the initiator, and the later perpetuator of papillary carcinoma.",

In none of the reported cases has it been associated with subsequent development of metastases. It may cause a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma in salivary glands, which appears otherwise benign. No explanation of the etiopathogenesis has been offered in previously reported cases. Aim: We suggest that pre-operative procedures undertaken such as fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the salivary gland may cause iatrogenic seeding of tumour cells. Materials and methods Two cases of PA of the parotid gland showed vascular invasion. Both presented with a palpable nodule in the parotid gland. One patient had two FNAs the other one prior to surgery. Both underwent superficial parotidectomy. Results Histologically both tumours were PAS positive with little chondromyxoid component but both were rich in myoepithelial cells. Clusters of myoepithelial and epithelial cells were seen within muscular and thin walled blood vessels, both outside the capsule and within the tumour. In spite of genuine vascular invasion there was no cytological evidence of atypia or malignancy. Our speculation is that the previous FNAs may have caused spillage of PA cells within vessels giving an impression of a potentially malignant tumour. Conclusion We recorded two cases of PA with associated vascular invasion. We speculate that preceding operative procedures such as FNA may be relevant to the pathogenesis.",

Activation of extracellular signalregulated kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2 is strongly correlated to cancer. Using an antibody specific for phosphorylated (active) ERK-1/ERK-2, we examined human salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma samples by immunohistochemistry. The comparison in paired tumor and normal tissue samples showed that phosphorylated ERK-1/ERK-2 expression was higher in tumor cells as compared to surrounding normal salivary parenchyma. Using a threshold below which > 95% of normal samples expressed phosphorylated ERK-1/ERK-2, we showed that ~39 % of mucoepidermoid carcinomas expressed high levels of phosphorylated ERK-1/ERK-2. Those tumours where ERK-1/ERK-2 pathway was activated had a more aggressive tumor behaviour as compared to the group where this pathway was inactive. The association of ERK-1/ERK-2 phosphorylation to a worse prognosis was independent of histological grade. ERK-1/ERK-2 phosphorylation was associated with an increased tumor cell proliferative index. There was no relationship between ERK-1/ERK-2 phosphorylation and HER-2/neu expression. In conclusion, ERK-1/ERK-2 pathway is active in salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma and this activation is associated to a more aggressive tumor behaviour and a higher proliferative activity. These data suggest that deregulation of ERK-1/ERK-2 pathway contributes to mucoepidermoid carcinoma phenotype and, possibly, represent a target for new anticancer drugs.",

Histologically the tumours resemble adenocarcinoma of the GI tract and show the same spectrum of histological types and differentiation. Therefore tumours at this site may present a diagnostic problem in distinguishing between primary and metastatic disease. Immunostaining has shown colonic adenocarcinomas to express cytokeratin CK20 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) but not cytokeratin CK7. Lung and squamous carcinomas of the head and neck are usually CK7 positive and CK20 negative. This prompted assessment of the immunohistochemical expression of CK7, CK20 and CEA in a retrospective series of primary nasal adenocarcinomas. The aims of the study were to establish the pattern of expression of CK7 CK20 and CEA in primary sinonasal adenocarcinoma and to compare it with that seen in colonic adenocarcinoma. Materials and methods 22 cases of primary sinonasal adenocarcinoma were available from archival files. These were reviewed and classified into 4 histological subtypes including papillary, tubular, mucinous and signet ring. Representative paraffin sections were immunostained for CK7, CK20 and CEA. Results Normal respiratory epithelium included in the sections was positive for CK7 and negative for CK20 and CEA. 13/22 (59%)of tumours expressed CK7. All of the tumours expressed CK20 and all but one of the tumours expressed CEA, with 3 showing only focal positivity. There were 7 tumours designated mucinous or signet ring type only one of which expressed CK7. Conclusion Primary sinonasal adenocarcinomas express CK20 and CEA. There is variable expression of CK7, which may help to distinguish between primary sinonasal adenocarcinoma, which are positive, and metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma of papillary and tubular subtype, which are negative. Poorly differentiated mucinous tumours are indistinguishable by immunohistochemistry alone.",

Histomorphologic features and peculiarly tumour capsule play a major role in recurrences of parotid pleomorphic adenomas. Cytogenetically, pleomorphic adenomas are characterized by recurrent chromosome rearrangements. The aim of this study was to correlate cytogenetics and histopathology features in pleomorphic adenomas in order to define cytogenetical characteristics of tumours with high risk of recurrence. Material and methods Histological and cytogenetical studies were performed in 61 patients with pleomorphic adenomas of the parotid gland treated in our institution during the period may 1992 -November 2002. Structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities were: rearrangement of chromosome 12 (breakpoint at 12q13-15), rearrangement of chromosome 8 (breakpoint at 8q12), translocation between chromosome 3 and 8: t(3;8)(q21;q12), hyperdiploidy. Results The studied population was distributed into 3 histological subtypes according to Seifert classification. Hypocellular (stroma rich) pleomorphic adenoma was reported in 61%, hypercellular pleomorphic adenoma was reported in 26% and \"classic\" in 13%. Thirty patients (49%) had normal karyotype while 31 (51%) had clonal chromosomal abnormalities. Chromosome 12 rearrangement tumours and hyperdiploid ones tend to be hypocellular. Tumours showing chromosome 8 abnormality tend to be hypercellular. Conclusions As recurrences most likely appear in hypocellular tumours, patients with hyperdiploidy and chromosome 12 abnormalities could have a greater risk of recurrence because of their histomorphological characteristics. Because of the lack of patients, not sufficient statistical significance was demonstrated.",

Thinness of capsule was significantly related to hypocellularity. Pseudopodias and satellite nodules were reported in 72% of this series. Conclusions Due to capsular characteristics, surgical exerecise should avoid dissection in the vicinity of the tumour to minimize the risk of surgical induced recurrence.

As most stromal types, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) harbour deregulation in the expression levels of many proteins that participate in critical biological pathways leading to cancer development. The aim of the study was to evaluate the correlation between several molecules implicated in cell cycle and apoptosis in an attempt to define their importance as prognostic indicators in HNSCC. Material and methods 110 HNSCC specimens from stage III-IV patients were collected prior to chemotherapy. We constructed a tissue-microarray with paraffin-embedded tumours to analyse, by inmunohistochemistry, the expression levels of 18 proteins implicated in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (P53, cyclin-D1, cyclin-A, RB, HDM2, topoisomerase, chk2, cdc2, Survivin, BCL-2, CDK-2, CDK-6, cyclin D3, cyclin E, cyclin B1, P21, P27 and P16). Results Alterations in the expression levels of proteins that participate in the G1/S checkpoint were frequent. RB and P16 proteins were absent in 15% and 15% of the tumours, respectively, whereas high expression of cyclin D1, CDK-4 and CDK-2 was observed in 42%, 8% and 13% of the cases, respectively. On the other hand, des-regulation of markers implicated in the apoptosis were also evident as shown by over-expression of BCL-2 protein in 23% of the tumours. This last observation seems to be related to bad prognosis.

Chronically impaired renal function was found in 60 cases. The removed parathyroid glands showed histologically hyperplasia in 62, adenoma in 60 and carcinoma in 3 cases. The oxyphil/chief cell ratio and occasional mitotic and apoptotic figures were determined. The oxyphil component predominated both the hyperplastic and tumorous lesions. Apoptosis and mitosis were rarely seen in hyperplasias (0-2%) more frequently in adenomas (2-5%) whereas in carcinomas 3-5% of the tumor cells showed signs of mitosis and 3-5% were apoptotic. Immunohistochemical detection of p53, bcl2 and bax revealed diversity between the various lesions. Cytoplasmic p53 positivity could be observed in the majority of adenomas and in some of the oxyphil cells of the hyperplasias. The carcinomas and about one sixth of the adenomas showed nuclear p53 positivity. Bcl2 was detected in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells of adenomas and in lower extent in the oxyphil cells of hyperplasias. Colocalistion of bcl2 and bax was found randomly in all types of lesions. No significant differences in the p53, bcl2 and bax spectrum were found regarding the primary and secondary (i.e. renal failure) parathyroid alterations. The very low incidence of carcinomas, the low mitotic and apoptotic ratio in adenomas and hyperplasias point to the potent antiproliferative defense mechanism in the parathyroid cell-population.

We examined 1539 lymph nodes by three deeper H&E levels and one section stained with immunohistochemistry for keratin. Results We detected OM in 21/96 patients. All 21 had micrometastases (<2.0 mm). OM was identified in 16 patients (34%) in the M group and in 5 (11%) in the NM group (P=0.007). Micrometastases larger than 0.2 mm were 10x more common in the M group (10/48 vs. 1/48, P=0.004) . Tumors in the M group were significantly more often of higher grade, had a higher mitotic index (MI) and showed lymphovascular invasion. The two groups did not differ in size, histologic type, estrogen receptor status or type of treatment. In multiple logistic regression, only high MI and presence of micrometastases larger than 0.2 mm showed an independent significant correlation with the occurrence of distant metastases.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of monoclonal antibodies: alpha-actin (smooth muscle actin) and S-100 protein, which are known as good markers of ME cells in breast tissue. Material and methods The distribution of ME cells in formalinfixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 15 intraductal papillomas and 10 papillary carcinomas were immunohistochemicaly stained by ABC method. Results Alpha-actin reacted strongly and consistently with the ME cells in all papillomas. In papillary carcinomas there were no alpha-actin reactive ME cells. Rare isolated ME cells were present in two cases, but they were inconspicuous and these reactions were also considered negative. The ME cells failed to express S-100 protein in four papillomas, while majority were weak positive. All the papillary carcinomas were S-100 protein negative. Conclusions Consistency and uniformity of ME cells reaction is important because benign and malignant papillary lesions often coexist in the same tissue section. Although vascular smooth muscle in the papillary fronds and stromal myofibroblasts may mimic ME cells, the number of alpha-actin immunoreactive cells is much smaller and their distribution more irregular. S-100 protein has broad spectrum reactivity and it is of little value in the differential diagnosis of papillary breast lesions. Alpha-actin is more specific marker than S-100 protein for recognition of ME cells in breast tissue.",

The aim of our study was to evaluate the accuracy of intraoperative SLN examination by imprint cytology (IC). Material and methods 459 SLNs from 225 women were examined. For intraoperative cytological examination, touch imprints from bisected SLNs were prepared, air dried and stained with quick staining method (Hemacolor-Merck). SLNs were than formalinfixed and embedded in paraffin. Histological sections were evaluated with 5 H&E stained levels and cytokeratin immunohistochemistry (CK-IHC). Results Histological examination of the SLN revealed 84 (37,3%) cases with metastatic deposits: 41 (18.2%) macrometastases, 32 (14.2%) micrometastases and 11 (4.9%) cases with isolated tumor cells or clusters (ITC) detected by immunohistochemistry. Sensitivity and specificity of intraoperative IC was 41% and 99%, respectively. IC was significantly more sensitive for detection of macrometastasis: they were detected in 34 out of 41 cases (83%). IC generally failed to detect micrometastases or ITC: only one case of micrometatasis was cytologically suspicious for malignancy. Out of 141 histologically negative SLNs, one IC diagnosis was false positive. Conclusions IC is a simple and quick method of intraoperative screening for the presence of SLN macrometastases in patients with breast cancer. If SLN micrometastases and ITC are used to determine the need for further lymphadenectomy, more sensitive intraoperative methods, such as rapid CK-IHC on touch preparations, will be needed to avoid second operation.",

However, in recent years there has been increased use of core biopsy (CB) as a diagnostic alternative. This study aimed at comparing the value of FNA and CB in palpable and non palpable breast lesions. Materials and methods The material consisted of 4367 FNA samples performed in our institution between 1999 and 2001. Correspoding histology results from 1275 lesions including 463 CB were available for comparison. Quality assessment parameters were calculated using metodology detailed in the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme guidelines. Results High specificity (100%) and sensitivity (92%) and low inadequacy rates were found for CB. FNA showed high sensitivity (87%). Low specificity (49%) for FNA due to inclusion of many cell-poor lesions was particularly seen in the submitted material sampled by physicians lacking experience with FNA procedures. Conclusion CB may be an alternative method for preoperative diagnosis when experienced cytopathologists are not available. CB is superior to FNA in fibrotic and collagenous lesions such as lobular carcinoma and radial scar. FNA is most accurate when immediate assessment by cytopathologist is performed for evaluation of material adequacy so that additional aspirations can be performed if necessary.",

ADH can be distinguished from non-high grade DCIS (among other criteria) by its size. Therefore, a question that is asked quite frequently is whether such small findings can be removed with sufficient security by minimal invasive biopsy (MIB). We prospectively investigated: 1. relative frequency of ADH without associated intraductal or invasive carcinoma 2. relevance of such small findings in MIB specimens. Materials and methods Between 1998 Between and 2002 Between , 2825 breastlesions could be clarified by means of MIB in the interdisciplinary team. Excisions were carried out in all invasive carcinomas and all DCIS as well as in all cases with minimal parts of intraductal nonhigh grade neoplasias (with the differential diagnosis ADH vs. DCIS). Additional ADHs were diagnosed in excision specimens as incidental findings associated with other targets (except for DCIS and invasive carcinomas). The MIB-and operation specimens have been examined prospectively by two team pathologists according to the criteria of Page and Tavassoli. Results We diagnosed altogether 25 ADHs and 138 DCIS. The proportion of ADH in all operated intraductal neoplasias (ADH+DCIS) was 1.56% (25/163). Findings with the differential diagnosis of ADH vs. DCIS could be found in 25 cases of 2825 MIBs (0,88%).The following excision specimens showed in 16 of 25 cases (64%) non-high grade DCIS and in 9 of 25 cases ADH (36%). The other 16 ADH were coincidental findings in excision specimen of benign lesions. Conclusions ADH is a very rare finding. In ADH-like findings in MIB specimens even specialised breast-pathologists cannot exclude a non-high grade DCIS with sufficient security when applying strictly the most common morphological definitions. The high rate of 64% of DCIS in the specimen of the following operation highlights the indication for clarifying by excision (according to the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Mammography Screening).",

Type I shows plump and coherent infiltration of the cervical stroma at different sites in one ore more step-serial sections. They originate from the squamous epithelium outside the transformation zone or from metaplastic cervical gland epithelium. All foci are contiguous with the epithelium. In this case, the largest lateral spread of each individual invasive focus should be measured. These measurements are added up to determine the total of horizontal spread. The normal tissue separating the different early invasive foci is not measured. In type II the origin of invasion cannot be seen in all early invasive foci but the greatest lateral extension can be seen in one of the step-serial sections. Lateral extension is defined as the maximum distance from one most lateral point of the border between the invasion and the adjacent tissue to the other. The lateral extension of type II includes the normal tissue separating the early invasive foci. Type III shows the same pattern as type II, but the maximum horizontal spread cannot be measured in a single step-serial section. In such lesions the width needs to be measured across all the step-serial sections involved and the second dimension must be calculated by knowing the distances between the sections. Conclusions These growth pattern of stromal invasion should be considered when measuring the width of early invasive squamous cell carcinomas with multiple invasive foci. Lesions with multiple invasive foci taken together measuring more than 7 mm in lateral extension should be classified as stage IB.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic impact of expression of the cyclooxygenase isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2 in 221 primary breast carcinomas as well as in 86 primary ovarian carcinomas. Materials and methods COX isoform expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. Results Expression of COX-2 was detected in 42% of 86 ovarian carcinomas and was associated with reduced overall survival in univariate analysis (p=0.04) as well as multivariate analysis (0.004). There was no correlation with other tumor parameters such as grade, stage or type. In contrast, COX-1 was no prognostic parameter in ovarian carcinoma. Expression of COX-2 was detected in 36% of breast carcinomas and was significantly associated with several clinicopathological parameters, such as positive nodal status (p<0.0005), larger tumor size (p<0.0005), poor differentiation (p<0.0005), vascular invasion (p=0.003) and negative estrogen receptor status (p=0.04). In univariate survival analysis a significant association between elevated COX-2 expression and decreased disease-free survival (p=0.0007) as well as decreased overall survival (p=0.02) was observed. In multivariate analysis expression of COX-2 was of borderline significance for disease-free survival (RR(95%CI) 1.90 (1.00-3.59) ). Conclusions Our data suggest that increased expression of COX-2 may play a role in progression of primary breast carcinomas as well as ovarian carcinoma.

The main feature of \"spontaneous endometrial hyperplasia\" is complete normalization after total curettage (Lindahl B., Willen R. 1994) ; there is also proof of recurring hyperplasia. The purpose of present research was to carry out clinical and morphological correlations between various types of endometrial hyperplasia and expression of pro-(HLDF) and antiapoptotic (BCL-2) proteins. Human leukemia cell differentiation factor (HLDF) with molecular mass 8.2 kd, having DNA/RNA hydrolyzing activity, was originally allocated from HL-60 cell line of promyelocyte leukemia medium, processed by retinoid acid or C2-ceramid (Kostanyan I.A. et al., 1994) . Previously we have shown that HLDF is a useful tool for apoptosis visualization in prostate (Babichenko I.I. et al., 2001) . We performed analysis of 139 patients with histologically documented simple endometrial hyperplasia without atypia: 74 women (53 %) had spontaneous recovery after total curettage, in 42 (30 %) patients endometrium recovered after gestagen treatment and in 23 (17 %) cases persistent recurring hyperplasic process was observed during 2-5 years. Immunohistochemical research showed that in samples of recurring hyperplasia HLDF was expressed in cytoplasm of glandular epithelium, while in sections with spontaneous or aftertreatment recovery, HLDF was revealed as a thin line on the surface of glandular cells. BCL-2 protein was found only in the cytoplasm of glandular cells in all investigated groups. Thus expression of the HLDF factor in cytoplasm of glandular cells in endometrium allows revealing the disturbance of apoptotic processes in cells and predicting the subsequent recurrence of simple hyperplasia.",

These changes are relatively common and can be misdiagnosed as benign surface changes on curettings, including endometrial metaplasias (EM), papillary syncytial change (PSC), or microglandular hyperplasia (MGH) . The aim of this study was to investigate surface epithelial changes in EAC. Material and methods 122 cases with EAC (96 endometrioid, 10 serous, 4 clear cell and 12 mixed types) were studied. Results 48 (39%) of the EAC showed surface epithelial changes: four with microglandular pattern simulating MGH; 16 with syncytial aggregates of eosinophilic cell, frequently with papillary or squamoid appearance, simulating EM or PSC; and 28 with mixed patterns. Surface epithelial change often demonstrated focal conjunction with a frankly malignant gland or a fibrovascular core and ranged from rare foci to diffuse surface involvement. Cytologic atypia was less pronounced than that of the underlying EAC and varied from mild to moderate. Mitoses were very rare. In some scanty curetting specimens, distinguishing these surface epithelial changes from benign changes was difficult, as was a diagnosis of EAC. Conclusion In postmenopausal women with curettings showing features of EM, MGH, or PSC, caution should be exercised in making that diagnosis, particularly PSC, in the absence of evidence of benign shedding, and any associated cytologic atypicality should raise the possibility of the underlying EAC.",

This showed that the only determinant was HPV infection. When the regression analysis was conducted without HPV as one of independent vari-ables, history of treatment from schistosomiasis was found to have OR of 2.4 (95%CI 1.1-5.5) but the model was not statistically significant. Conclusion In the Egyptian population, the prevalence of the precursor lesions of the invasive carcinoma is 3% while invasive lesions account for 0.8% of the population. The prevalence of HPV histologically is 2.2% and by ISH 2.6%. However, detection of HPVs by ISH in this study cannot be precise due to technical limitations and limited number of probes used. Evaluation of HPVs using PCR technology will be subject to another study. possible role of IRF-1 in the genesis of endometrial adenocarcinoma. A series of 86 such tumours was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques. Relatioships were sought with thymidine phosphorylase (TP), conventional histological features and prognosis. Malignant endometria were, by and large, deprived of IRF-1, as 81 of the 86 cases (94.2%) were negative for this antigen. Only 5 of the 86 cases were expressing IRF-1 in inner tumour areas. At the invading tumor front, however, IRF-1 was depressed in tumour cells in 35% of cases. This phenomenon was independent of the extent of lymphocytic response, but it was a strongly associated with TP expression. TP up-regulation and host's lymphocytic response in the area were directly associated. IRF-1 derepression by invading tumor cells was associated with poor prognosis. This prognostic parameter was independent of stage. It is concluded that down-regulation of IRF-1 is a constant finding in endometrial tumorigenesis. However, derepression of IRF-1 may occur in a subset of tumours, and this event is associated with TP up-regulation and aggressive tumor behaviour.",

Quantitative and qualitative studies on endometrial epithelium were performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and morphometry and the results were statistically compared between the two groups. Results Qualitative results revealed presence of nuclear channel system (NCS), sub vacuole of glycogen and giant mitochondria (GM) in both groups. Similarly, in quantitative analyses, the volume fractions (Vv) of glycogen, mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum to cell and the also the Vv of euchromatin to nucleus were statistically not different between two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion These results suggest that ovulation induction by long protocol is not associated with retarded or advanced endometrial epithelial development.",

Currently accurate diagnosis requires a multidisciplinary approach but the usefulness of electron microscopy has been questioned. The aim of this study was to define the diagnostic role of electron microscopy in comparison to histology and histochemistry. Patients and methods Thirty-five patients who fulfilled a clinical phenotype for mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, were separated into two groups. The paediatric group, which included 21 cases, with an age range of 6 days to 18 years old and the adult group which included 14 cases, with an age range of 19 to 75 years old. All patients underwent a muscle biopsy which was examined by histology, histochemistry and electron microscopy. Results In the paediatric group, 4 cases exhibited RRFs, 8 cases showed RRFe and 16 cases had COX abnormalities. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of mitochondrial abnormalities in 10 cases and mitochondrial aggregates in 7 others. In 4 cases light microscopy was normal, but in 2 of these electron microscopy was abnormal. In the adult group all 14 patients, showed COX abnormalities, 12 cases had RRFe and 7 others had RRFs. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of mitochondrial aggregates in 12 cases and structural abnormalities in 7 cases. Conclusions Electron microscopy examination is a useful independent diagnostic tool in the investigation of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. It is particularly helpful, in the paediatric cases, where the classic light microscopical findings are often not well developed.",

Aims: Electron microscopy is an essential technique in evaluating sublethal and lethal cellular injuries. Therefore, gastric carcinomas were studied by light and electron microscopy, focusing on the relationship between eosinophils and tumour cells and on the nature of tumour cell death. Material and methods Fresh tumour tissue was obtained in the operating room for immediate fixation and processed for both light and electron microscopy examination from 1992 until 2002. Results A light microscopy review of 107 cases of resected gastric carcinomas identified 5 cases (3 of intestinal-type and 2 of diffusetype) with a massive TATE. In 3 cases of intestinal-type adenocarcinomas, eosinophils formed varied-sized aggregates in the tumour stroma. Some were seen passing through the neoplastic epithelium, and others were found lying within neoplastic tubules. In 2 cases of diffuse-type carcinoma, eosinophil clusters were seen to surround single tumour cells. With electron microscopy, performed in these 5 cases, tumour cells in intimate contact with eosinophils revealed sublethal and lethal cellular injuries. In particular, sublethal injuries, such as cytoplasmic vacuoles and indiscernible cell membrane, occurred at the contact region. Eosinophil \"satellitosis\" was associated with lethal damage of tumour cells including brush border disorganization, dilation of nuclear envelope, rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus forming empty spaces or vacuoles, small condensed chromatin particles, irregular distribution of nuclear pores. These lethal injuries were compatible with non-apoptotic (non-lysosomal vesiculate) cell death. The adenocarcinoma cells, not contacted by eosinophils remained morphologically well preserved. Conclusions These morphological data suggest the hypothesis of a direct relationship between eosinophil infiltration and induction of non-apoptotic tumour cell death in some cases of gastric adenocarcinoma. A deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms acting as cytokines that stimulate specific eosinophil functions may assist in the development of novel therapies to better treat human malignancies",

Tissue exepression of P53 (tumor suppressor gene) and c-erbB-2 (oncogene) was assesed immunohistochemically in bladder urothelial specimens of a well characterized cohort of 55 male Egyptian patients (25 Ch.Sch.C; 20 Sch.TCC and 10 normal urothelial specimens as controls). Both P53 and c-erbB-2 oncoproteins were not expressed neither in morphologically normal nor in the hyperplastic epithelium. Overexpression of nuclear P53 and membranous c-erbB-2 was detected in 20% of Ch.Sch.C cases in whom premalignant changes (metaplasia and dysplasia) were displayed. While, in the Sch.TCC cases they were detected in 80% and 70% of cases respectively. On stratifying these patients according to the well recognized prognostic parameters (histopathological grade, stage, tumor size, multifocality and growth pattern) P53 was positively correlated with all the forementioned parameters. In contrast c-erbB-2 was only correlated with tumor size and growth pattern. In conclusion, the results of the current study may suggest the early involvement of both P53 and c-erbB-2 in the initiation of the premalignant changes occuring with Ch.Sch.C and the progression of these changes to malignancy. Moreover, the high incidence of P53 and c-erbB-2 expression among Sch.TCC cases with poor prognostic parameters (higher grade, stage; bigger tumor size; tumor multifocality and nonpapillary growth pattern) may point out to the possibility of using these biomarkers as early predictive markers in Ch.Sch.Cyst. cases displaying premalignant lesions and as poor prognostic indicators for Sch.TCC.",

Its immunohistochemical detection has been considered useful in the differential diagnosis of renal carcinomas because of its expression in 93-100% of clear cell renal and papillary renal cell carcinomas and its absence in chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC), a histotype positive for parvalbumin, a protein of the distal nephron. Material and methods We studied immunohistochemically 26 ChRCCs including four with aggressive features (two with sarcomatoid transformation, one with renal vein involvement and one with pancreatic metastasis), for CD10 and parvalbumin developing the reactions with different methods (ABC, Envision peroxidase detection and labeled polymer-AP Dako Envision systems) to prevent false-positive staining due to endogeneous biotin. Western blotting was done to confirm the results. As control we stained 75 clear renal cell carcinomas with both antibodies. Results CD10 immunoreactivity was observed in 5 (20%) primary ChRCCs, three with aggressive features, using all the developing systems. All ChRCCs were positive for parvalbumin, but not the sarcomatoid areas. Western blotting confirmed the specificity of the immunoreactivities. Conclusions 1) About 20 % of ChRCC express CD10 2) CD10 is not specific for clear cell and papillary carcinomas of the kidney; 3) A panel including both CD10 and parvalbumin is useful in the differential diagnosis between ChRCC and clear renal cell carcinoma; 3) Three out of four tumors with aggressive features stained for CD10, but further studies are needed to highligh the prognostic significance of CD10 in ChRCC.",

In CIS positive cells were present in all cell layers or distributed in a pagetoid pattern while adjacent normal urothelium showed staining of superficial cells. In WHO grade I papillary tumors TN staining was located in superficial cells, in grade II tumors scattered positive intermediate cells were present, while in grade III tumors TN was expressed focally in all cell layers.

Material and methods Of 447 patients who underwent surgery for renal malignancies at Department of Urology, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital during the period from 1992 to 2000, data of 310 were available in Croatian National Cancer Registry. There were 297 patients with PRCC (193 males and 104 female patients) ranging in age from 24-91 years (median 59.9 years). Results and conclusion In our series there were 24 (8.1%) patients with SPM. Secondary malignancies in descending order of frequency were cancer of prostate (2.1%), colon (1.0%), lungs (1.0%), bladder (1,0%) and skin (0.7%). There were 42.3% antecedent, 26.9% synchronous and 30,8% subsequent SPM. Only one patient had more than one synchronous second malignancy (urinary bladder, prostate and colon). SPM in patients with PRCC are of great importance for both the clinician and pathologist. Therefore, the clinician should maintain lifetime high-technique follow-up of the patients with PRCC.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of thin layer techniques applied to UC diagnosis associated with multicolour interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for early identification of initial BC and recurrences. Methods A total of 50 voided urine specimens were collected, 20 before resection of bladder cancer, 20 from patient with previous BC and 10 flogistic control patient.

Introduction Few large series comparing conventional, papillary and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (RCC) have been published. Most have been heterogeneous, including RCC subgroups of different stage and/or grade. The purpose of this study was to examine the clinico-pathologic features of a series of chromophobe RCCs comparing their outcome with that of conventional and papillary RCCs in a grade and stage matched fashion. Materials and methods The clinico-pathologic features of 41 chromophobe RCCs, 40 papillary and 153 conventional RCCs were examined, focussing on the following parameters: patient age and sex, tumor size, stage (1997 pTNM), Fuhrman grade, and histology. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan Meier method. The most important prognostic factors were identified using the Cox model. Results For patients with localized disease at diagnosis; median, 5-year, and 10-year Disease Specific Survivals (DSS) were similar for chromophobe (120 mths, 5 and 10-yr DSS: 80%) and papillary (120 mths, 5 and 10-yr DSS: 79.5%) tumors. Conventional RCC patients had a significantly worse outcome (84 mths, 5-yr DSS: 55.8%; 10-yr DSS: 46.5%). The best outcome in low grade (G1+G2), low stage (pT1+pT2) tumors was observed in chromophobe RCCs. In multivariate analysis, conventional (nonpapillary) RCC histology was the major independent adverse prognostic factor whether or not stage and grade were included in the Cox models. Conclusion Chromophobe RCC is a rare RCC variant of good prognosis. This favorable prognosis is maintained when low grade (G1+G2) / low stage (pT1+pT2) tumors are specifically examined.",

Recently, it has been shown that for certain tumors (especially gastrointestinal stromal tumors and mast cell diseases) c-kit mutation or activation is a major pathogenetic event. Only one previous study has been published regarding c-kit expression in normal renal tissue, and none regarding renal neoplasms. In this preliminary report of an ongoing study, we investigated the expression of c-kit protein via immunohistochemistry in various normal and neoplastic renal tissues. Material and methods Our material included eight fetal kidneys (16-28 weeks of gestation), seven normal adult kidneys, two cases of renal dysplasia, and 20 renal tumors: 13 renal cell carcinomas, two nephroblastomas, three oncocytomas, one mesoblastic nephroma and one angiomyolipoma. Staining intensity was recorded in a three-grade scale. Results All fetal kidneys showed cytoplasmic staining of proximal tubules (++). Henle loops were also positive (++), especially in older embryos. Cytoplasmic and membrane staining (++) of renal tubules was also observed in all normal adult kidneys. The two cases of renal dysplasia studied, had c-kit expression in their normal but not in their aberrant tubules. Of the renal cell carcinomas, all conventional type cases (n=9), one sarcomatoid and one papillary type case were negative, while one chromophobe and one granular type were positive (++ and + respectively). All oncocytomas were positive (+++ to ++), and quite interestingly the mesoblastic nephroma was also positive. The angiomyolipoma and the two nephroblastomas were negative. Conclusion We conclude that c-kit is expressed in normal fetal and adult renal tubules, as well as in a subset of renal tumors. The expression of c-kit in the latter group may prove to have diagnostic significance and therapeutic implications.",

Biological mechanisms responsible for resistance remain unclear, since consistent molecular characteristics of AML at relapse and refractory disease have not yet been reported. Methods We explored paired bone marrow biopsy specimens of 18 patients (at diagnosis and relapsed/refractory AML after high dose chemotherapy) in an immunohistochemical study using Anti Human Ki-67 Antigen (MIB-1) antibody to determine the proliferation fraction of leukemic blasts. Gene expression was analyzed in a different sample set (15 at diagnosis and 11 relapsed/ refractory AML) using a \"relapse specific\" cDNA microarray covering 4128 genes, selected by literature and suppression subtractive hybridization. Microarray results were validated using quantitative real time PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Results Recurrent and refractory AML blasts demonstrate a highly significantly increased (P<0.0001) proliferation fraction compared to primary diagnosis. mRNA levels of proliferation markers CD71 and PCNA were elevated 4.3-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, in relapsed and refractory AML compared to diagnosis. Enhanced activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade was indicated by increased mRNAs of B-RAF (1.7-fold), cyclin D1 (2.7-fold), MKP-1 (2.8-fold), c-fos (4-fold) , and Egr-1 (5.6-fold). Additional immunohistochemical and immunoblotting analyses demonstrated an elevation of biphosphorylated ERK1/2 protein in recurrent AML, confirming enhanced activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Conclusion Our results provide for the first time evidence that high dose chemotherapy selects or induces leukemic blasts with increased proliferative potential via enhanced activation of RAF/ MEK/ERK cascade.",

In order to define the role of angiogenesis in DLBCL, mRNA and protein expression of the two most important angiogenic growth factors, VEGF and bFGF, and two VEGF receptors, VEGFR-1/flt-1 and VEGFR-2/KDR were evaluated by real time quantitative PCR (RTQ-PCR) and immunohistochemistry in DLBCL. Methods We analyzed 27 DLBCL cases, 3 low-grade follicle center lymphomas (FLS) and 2 cases with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) for expression of VEGF-A, bFGF, VEGFR-1/flt-1 and VEGFR-2/KDR. We used a real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) method to quantify mRNA levels of these angiogenic markers using an ABI 7000 qRT-PCR system.

Histological staining of both VEGF receptors in DLBCL sections showed strong staining of both receptors on the microvessel endothelial cells but not on the tumor cells. Our data suggest that VEGF plays a role in the pathophysiology of DLBCL however autocrine/paracrine stimulation by VEGF does not seem to be relevant in DLBCL. The expression of VEGF and its receptors raises the possibility of using angiogenesis inhibitors as a novel therapeutic strategy.",

The aim of this study was to examine whether Mann and Berard's grading has prognostic significance in patients with follicular lymphoma who were not uniformly treated. Samples from 73 patients with follicular lymphoma with follow up ranging from 7-223 months (median 59 months) were included in the study. Forty-three patients (59%) achieved a complete response (CR), 19 (26%) partial response (PR), while 11 (15%) were considered non-responders during the follow up period of 223 months. Twenty-seven (37%) patients died, 11 patients (15 %) from dissemination, 11 from transformation to other lymphoma type and 5 (6, 8%) patients died from non-lymphoma related causes. OS rate was significantly worse in patients with Ann Arbor stage IV than patients Ann Arbor stage I-III (p=0.07). Patients with lower IPI score did significantly better than those with a higher IPI score for OS (p<0.0001) and TTF (p<0.0001). Grade 1 FL patients had longer OS (p=0.02) than grade 2 and 3 patients. A trend for longer TTF was also found (p=0.05). Cox regression analysis showed that these results were independent of stage, but were not independent of IPI score.

Results and conclusions PCR analysis of whole-tissue DNA documented TCR-gamma monoclonal rearrangement in 2/6 cases (2/2 borderline, 0/4 LyP); TCR analysis on DNA extracted from microdissected CD30+ cells showed monoclonal rearrangement in 5/6 cases (2/2 borderline, 3/4 LyP). We confirm that PCR analyses on DNA extracted by microdissected CD30+ cells enhance the rate of monoclonality detection mainly in LyP lesions, in which the limited number of atypical CD30+ cells and predominant reactive cellular background may be responsible for negative or ambiguous signalling when DNA extracted by the whole lesion is tested.",

The patient completed his anamnesis by imparting that his right testicle was slightly enlarged and periodically painful. Semicastration was indicated and the removed tissue was prepared for pathohistologic analysis. The testicle had only peripherally preserved normal tissue, whereas the tumor was clearly demarcated, 4.5 cm in diameter. Five-micrometre-thick tissue sections from the paraffin-embedded tissue were stained with H&E. The cells were quite variable in their morpholoric features and size. The nuclei were generally hypochromatic, with irregular chromatin distribution. The nuclear morphologic properties varied and included pleomorphic mono-and multinucleated giant tumour cells with multiple nuclear lobulations. Nucleoli were conspicuous. Also, numerous benignappearing lymphocytes and plasmacytoid elements were scattered throughout the background. This histologic picture could correspond either to spermatocytic seminoma or lymphoma. Since the patient needed an urgent therapy, histochemically (PAS-) and immunohistochemically (LCA +, CD3 +, CD20 +), the diagnosis of lymphoma was confirmed. The patient received CT (CHOP protocol), which resulted in a satisfactory clinical response. In this case, it is interesting to point to the most probable infiltration of the myocardium by the diagnosed lymphoma which elicited the cardiologic symptoms and from which the diagnosing of the patient's disease was to start.",

The tumors were subclassified according to the criteria of the WHO classification and evaluated by immunohistochemistry for expression of antigens associated with germinal center (GC) and non-GC stages of B-cell differentiation (bcl-6, CD10, MUM-1, VS38c, CD138, bcl-2 and CD44). The presence of a BCL-2/IgH gene rearrangement was investigated by PCR. All cases were characterized by similar clinicopathologic and morphologic features, and had similarly good overall outcome. The patients (23 M, 6F, median 44 y) had tumors in long bones (14), axial skeleton (8), and limb girdles (3) and multiple sites (4) . Most tumors (24) were centroblastic, with multilobated cells in 12 cases. Almost half of the tumors (14/29, 48%) were bcl-6+CD10+ (\u00abGClike\u00bb), 9/29 cases (31%) were bcl-6+CD10-(\u00abindeterminate\u00bb phenotype) and 6/29 cases (21%) were CD10-bcl-6-(\u00abpost-GC like\u00bb). The \u00abindeterminate\u00bb phenotype was seen only in primary bone lymphoma. MUM-1 was frequently expressed in GC-like and non-GC-like categories. We found no evidence of plasmacytic differentiation by CD138 and VS38c immunoreactivity was distinctly rare (2/29 cases). CD44 was detected in 6 tumors, all CD10-. Bcl-2 was expressed by 70% of the tumors but only 1/23 cases tested had a Bcl-2/JH rearrangement by PCR. A survival analysis showed that GC-like tumors had a longer overall survival duration compared to non-GC-like tumors (p=0.0046). In conclusion, a \"GC-like\" immunophenotype, characterizes roughly half of large B-cell lymphomas of bone and is associated with an improved survival.",

Some of them were large granular lymphocytes and could be natural killer cells. Some of LAL could correspond to a T lymphocyte. In electron microscopic study of LAL we also observed presence of plasma cells and the pattern of intracellular membrane systems common to cells that secrete protein: well developed granular endoplasmic reticulum, large juxtanuclear Golgi complex. A centriole occupies a position just marginal to the Golgi. The chromatin in the nucleus of these cells is characteristically condensed into large masses just within the envelope.

The aim of our study was to assess variability in serum apolipoproteins in relation to hepatic steatosis in HCV patients of genotype 4 with or without HCC. Material included 73 Egyptian subjects; 25 (HCV), 25 (HCV-associated HCC), and 23 controls. Clinical examination for stigmata of chronic hepatic affection and ultrasonography for assessment of liver size, surface, echogenicity and the presence or absence of a focal lesion were done. Histopathological examination of liver biopsies was done for assessment of hepatitis activity index (HAI) and stage as well as the grade of hepatocytic steatosis (HS). Biochemical study included liver function tests, lipid profile and assessment of apolipoproteins. Results showed a significant decline in apo-A, apo-B, apo-CII, apo-CIII and apo-E lipoprotein in HCV and HCV-associated HCC groups compared to the control group. Analysis of HAI in HCV patients showed significant association of HS with periportal necrosis, but not portal inflammation or lobular degeneration. In patients with HCV associated HCC, HS was significantly associated with portal inflammation and lobular degeneration, suggesting a correlation between virus activity and hepatocytic neoplastic changes. We concluded that steatosis should be searched for in patients with chronic HCV, being an important cofactor in accelerating the development of hepatic fibrosis and in increasing necroinflammatory activity. A correct therapeutic approach to steatosis would slow down the evolution of chronic hepatitis.",

The BRAF gene, one of the human isoforms of RAF, is activated by oncogenic Ras, leading to cooperative effects in cells responding to growth factor signals. This study was performed to elucidate a possible function of BRAF in liver tumours. Methods Mutations of BRAF and KRAS were evaluated in 25 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and in 69 cholangiocarcinomas (CC) by direct DNA sequencing analyses after microdissection. The presence of active intermediates of the MAPK pathway was assessed immunohistochemically. The results obtained were correlated with histopathological variables and patient survival. Results Activating BRAF missense mutations were identified in 15/69 CC (22%) and in one case of tumour surrounding liver. KRAS mutations were found in 31 out of 69 (45%) CC examined and in two cases of tumour-surrounding non-neoplastic liver tissue. In HCC, neither BRAF nor KRAS mutations were detected. All 31 CC with KRAS mutations had an intact BRAF gene. We failed to observe a correlation between BRAF or KRAS mutations and histopathological factors or prognosis of the patients. Conclusions Our data indicate, that BRAF gene mutations are a relatively common event in CC, but not in HCC. Disruption of the Raf/MEK/ERK (MAPK) kinase pathway -either by RAS or BRAF mutation -was detected in about 65% of all CC and is therefore one of the most frequent defects in cholangiocellular carcinogenesis.",

Materials and methods For 10 years 134 patients with so called \"Postcholecystectomic Syndrome\" (PCES) were treated, 39 (29%) had a clinical picture of acute cholangitis (AC), which was shown by pains in the right hypochondrium, yellowness of skin and scleras, shivering, high hyperthermia and leukocytosis. Patients (25 women and 14 men) were 42-76 years old, 12 of them more than 60 years. Initial operation (CE) was made in various hospitals in terms from 4 months to 2 years ago. The diagnosis was verified by: clinical, laboratory and immunological researches, peroxidation of lipids (POL), ultrasonic research, computerized tomography, fibrogastroduodenoscopy, endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiography, transdermic and transhepatic cholangiography, fibrocholangiograpgy, bacteriological researches of bile and blood. Results According to investigations, in 21 patients the reason of infringement of bile flow was choledocholithiasis (in a combination with stenosis of big duodenal papilla (BDP) or without it, in 10-stenosis of BDP, in 6-cicatricial stricture of hepatocholedochus, in 2 extended stenosis of BDP and a terminal part of the common bile duct (CBD). Laboratory prognostic tests (risk factor) AC concern: hyperbilirubinemia, increase of activity of alanine transpeptidase, aspartate transpeptidase, hypoproteinemia, dysproteinemia, decrease of a level of protrombin lower than 70%, leukocytosis, anemia, increase of the contents of urea in blood, bacteriocholia, concentration of molecule of average weight were higher than 0.6 unit, decrease of level of vitamin E, high contents of immunoglobulin M on a background of a low parameter immunoglobulin G. Conclusions At the presence of 4 risk factors prognosis was frequently in contrary to expectations and mortality reached to 50-80%. All patients with acute cholangitis after cholecystectomy represented a complicated problem and demanded a complex approach. Revealed prognostic tests of the development of acute cholangitis are necessary for taking into account for its prophylaxis and optimum treatment. Structural alterations in c-myc oncogene, copy number and expression have been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of several human neoplastic diseases. However, the biologic significance of c-myc gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unconfirmed. In the present study we correlated c-myc gene amplification and protein expression with the clinicopathologic features. In 20 HCC cases c-myc amplification in tumour tissue was determined using a differential PCR, a procedure for evaluation of gene amplification in comparison with a dopamine D2 receptor gene. The c-myc gene was amplified in 6 out of 20 tumor specimens (30%). Amplification of c-myc was more frequent in younger male patients with HBV infection and in less differentiated tumors. All cases demonstrated positive staining using anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody with increasing percentage of immunoreactive cells in less differentiated tumors. However, the high protein expression was not statistically correlated with c-myc amplification.",

Biomedical Science And Human Oncology, Turin, Italy Brushing of thin ducts such as those of the biliary tract, pancreas and bronchial tree is often used by endoscopists in order to obtain diagnostic material proving the nature of related lesion. The material is spread on slides. Cytological examination folows. Preservation of the material so obtained is often sub-obtimal, partly because of the presence of fluids such as bile affecting cell preservation, partly because spreading of delicate cells may result in crushing artifacts. To circumvent such problems, we devised an original procedure, where brushes were not smeared, but instead immediately embedded in immersed Methanol. Then the tube with alcool and brush was sent to the laboratory. In order to induce formation of a glue surrounding the brush, this was immersed while wet into egg albumen (a mixture 1:1 of egg albumen and glycerol), then returned to methanol. For paraffin embedding, the metal handling was cut away and the brush was introduced as such into a cassette. Sections parallel to the long axis were cut until the metal wire was almost reached, then the block was rotated and new section was obtained from the opposite side. Sections were stained in Haematoxilin-Eosin and with the Papanicolau procedure. Small fragments of the mucosa, of inflammatory cell aggregates or of related carcinomas were observed. These resulted optimally fixed and allowed a definite histological diagnosis which proved mandatory for proper therapy. Advantages and prospects of this novel procedure will be illustrated and discussed.",

At least 200 nuclei were quantified per slide and the number of positive signals per nucleus was expressed as a hTERT index. Results The mean hTERT index increased progressively with the degree of gallbladder epithelial abnormalities: from 0.03 (standard deviation=0.05) in normal epithelia, 0.04 (SD=0.05) in hyperplastic epithelia, 0.25 (SD=0.14) in low grade dysplasia, 0.82 (SD=0.20) in high grade dysplasia to 0.93 (SD=0.27) in adenocarcinoma. According to the hTERT expression, three groups of gallbladder epithelial changes were found: 1.) normal and hyperplastic gallbladder mucosa, 2. low grade dysplasia, and 3.) high grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder. The differences between the groups were statistically significant (p<0.001). Conclusions We believe that occasional presence of hTERT in normal and reactively hyperplastic gallbladder mucosa merely reflects its regenerative capacity. Nevertheless, significantly higher hTERT indices in low grade as well as high grade dysplastic epithelium and gallbladder adenocarcinoma are most probably the consequence of hTERT re-expression -an early event in the multistep process of gallbladder carcinogenesis.",

However, during recent years an increasing number of laparotomies has been performed for spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) in premature infants. The aims of this study were to compare the clinical and pathological features of SIP and NEC and to identify parameters useful to make the differential diagnosis. Materials and methods We reviewed the clinical files and biopsies from 40 infants indexed as \"necrotizing enterocolitis\" or \"intestinal perforation\" between 1991 and 2002. Results Twenty-six patients had SIP and 14 had NEC. Patients with SIP had lower gestational age and birth weight. They presented early with abdominal distension. Frequent radiological signs were dilatation of bowel loops and pneumoperitoneum. Perforation was in the small bowel in all cases. 77 % survived. Patients with NEC presented later with more systemic symptoms. Pneumatosis intestinalis was present in more than half. The colon was involved more frequently than the small bowel. 50 % survived. Cases of NEC were characterized by necrosis, inflammation and reparative tissue changes with or without pneumatosis intestinalis. In contrast, the bowel in cases of SIP was not necrotic and showed little inflammation. Its most distinguishing characteristic was the presence of one or more defects in the internal layer of the muscularis propia. The myenteric nerve plexus and interstitial cells of Cajal had developed normally. Conclusions Spontaneous intestinal perforation and necrotizing enterocolitis differ in their clinical and histopathological characteristics. In our cases, SIP was always associated with segmental absence of the intestinal musculature.",

The recent introduction of Gleevec/Glivec, an effective inhibitor of the activated c-kit and PDGF-R has stimulated interest in standardizing the immunohistochemical detection of c-kit in GIST-tissues, assuring an appropriate selection of patients for therapy with Gleevec. Aims: The DakoCytomation anti-Human c-kit antibody, code A 4502, was investigated in four different set-ups: 1) without heat-induced epitope-retrieval (HIER), 2) with HIER, 3) preabsorbing the primary antibody with the synthetic peptide used for generation of the primary antibody and 4) testing on fresh versus archival tissue sections. Materials and methods Tissue sections were obtained from 35 different cases of GIST, confirmed by morphology and IHCcharacterisation (c-kit, CD34, S100, SMA, desmin). The IHC was performed manually as well as on automated platforms including the TechMate\u2122 and the Autostainer instruments. Results The use of HIER consistently displayed a stronger and more uniform staining pattern as compared to an IHC protocol without HIER. In few cases the expression of CD117 was found faintly positive in IHC without HIER. Automated and manual IHC methods displayed similar staining patterns. The specificity of detecting CD117 in a protocol using HIER was confirmed by preabsorption of the primary antibody with immunogen. Storing of fresh cut sections for more than 10 months demonstrated a decrease in IHC CD117 staining intensity. Conclusion Epitope retrieval enhances the CD117 staining intensity in GIST-tissue. The specificity of the CD117 detection in GIST's can be confirmed by complete blocking of the positive staining in a parallel set-up, using preabsorption of the antibody by a synthetic c-kit peptide.",

Here we characterise some of the genetic changes in 40 cases of early onset gastric cancer (EOGC). Methods Using DNA isolated from microdissected material, a panel of 19 polymorphic microsatellite markers near known or presumed tumour suppresser genes was used to evaluate loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Microsatellite instability (MSI) status was ascertained using 3 polymorphic microsatellite markers in 40 cases of EOGC and in an additional 24 biopsy cases. Corresponding immunohistochemistry was performed for p53, SMAD4, Ecadherin, MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6. EBV status of the carcinomas was determined using EBER1-mRNA in-situ hybridisation. Results The most common losses were at loci adjacent to CDH1(17%), TP53(15-23%), RUNX3(22-29%) and SMAD4/ DPC4(14-17%). Less frequently, losses were detected at 3p21, 14q24, and loci adjacent to APC, p16INK4a, PTEN, and TFF. No MSI was detected in the 64 cases examined. Immunohistochemistry revealed abnormalities for E-Cadherin in 55% and p53 in 34%. All tumours examined were EBV negative. Conclusion Common events in EOCG are genetic alterations in CDH1, TP53 and RUNX3 whereas other LOH findings were infrequent. Protein abnormalities of E-Cadherin and p53 were commoner than losses near the corresponding gene. In contrast to gastric cancer in older patients, MSI does not appear to occur in young patients. These findings confirm that unique genetic alterations lead to gastric cancer in the young and highlight the need for further investigation to elucidate the mechanisms by which they occur.",

Materials and methods 135 BEGP from 110 patients were selected to perform Ki-67 immunohistochemical analysis. There were 40 FH, 72 HP (including 21 HP-NOS and 51 HP-IM, HP-D and/or HP-Ca) and 23 A. As controls 16 cases of normal mucosa (N), 9 cases of regenerative FH (FH-R) and 7 cases of Ca were used. Paraffin sections were studied immunohistochemically for Ki-67 LI with application of MIB-1 antibody. The data were analysed using one-way ANOVA models. Results It has been found that the means of Ki-67 LI between all the groups studied differed significantly (p<0.001). Ki-67 LI for FH was high (38.8) and did not differ significantly from FH-R (47.6), A (43.3), and areas of low grade dysplasia in HP-D (42.5), but was significantly higher from N (24.4) and HP (22.8).

Immunohistochemical studies were performed using vimentin and cytokeratin antibodies for detection of rhabdoid features. Results and conclusions The highest incidence of GC was in 60-69-year-old aged patients (34%). Using Lauren classification, 279 cases were categorised as diffuse type (62%), 167 intestinal type (37%) and 5 (1%) mixed type GC. Each of these three types were also histologically analyzed according to WHO classification: intestinal type GC (formed by recognizable well/moderately differentiated glands) and diffuse type GC (consisting in poorly cohesive cells diffusely infiltrating the gastric wall with little or no gland formation). In diffuse type GC with rhabdoid features we evidentiated vimentin and cytokeratin in cells with an eccentric nucleus and a paranuclear inclusion. Finally, we pointed out that is very easy to diagnose GC by Lauren and WHO classifications, but is difficult to evidence the mixed type GC due to reduced size of endobiopsies. Recognition of the rhabdoid phenotype in diffuse type GC is important because this feature is associated with poor prognosis and unresponsiveness to conventional therapy. gastrointestinal tract.

The study was focused on submesothelial fibroblasts from normal controls and PD patients. Materials and methods Parietal peritoneal biopsies were collected from three patient groups: normal controls (n=15), non-PD uremic patients (n=17) and uremic patients on PD (n=27). In order to study myofibroblastic differentiation and mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, cytokeratins, and Ecadherin were analyzed. We also evaluated CD34 expression by submesothelial fibroblasts. Results Fibroblasts from normal controls and non-PD, uremic patients showed no myofibroblastic nor mesothelial markers, but an intense expression of CD34. The opposite immunophenotypic pattern was present during PD-related fibrosis. Expression of mesothelial markers (cytokeratins and E-cadherin) by fibroblastlike cells and alpha-smooth muscle actin by mesothelial and modified mesothelial cells are evidence that mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition occurs during PD. Loss of CD34 expression was another helpful indicator of fibrosis. Conclusion The immunophenotype of submesothelial fibroblasts varies depending on the existence of a fibrogenic condition.

During tumor progression a downregulation of the transcription factor AP-2a and the receptor thyrosine kinase c-kit was observed. However, mechanisms leading to a loss of both proteins are unknown. Besides genetic changes post-transcriptional downregulation by caspase-6 and -3 is recently discussed. Aims were: i) to investigate malignant melanoma for AP-2a and c-kit genetically and by protein expression, ii) to study the implication of activated caspases. Methods 10 SSMs, 10 NMs and 30 metastases were analyzed by direct sequencing analysis for all exons of AP-2a and c-kit genes and by immunohistochemistry for the respective proteins and cleaved (activated) caspase-6 and -3. Results Four tumors showed point mutations in the activation motif of AP-2a (exon 2). No genetic alterations were detected in the c-kit sequence. Immunohistochemistry revealed a progressive loss of dermal AP-2a and c-kit expression when comparing SSMs with NMs and Ms which was paralleled by a strong expression of caspase-6 in the primary melanomas and Ms, the later were also characterized by caspase-3 expression. Conclusion Tumor progression in melanoma is characterized by a loss of AP-2a and c-kit. Caspase-6 probably contributes to this down-regulation, as it was recently shown in vitro. The activation of caspases in melanoma might not only induce apoptosis but could be substantial for tumor growth.",

            "text": "Introduction In cancer patients, tumor-expression of the angiogenic factor Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A) correlates with high tumor vascularity and increased metastatis, but how these latter two relate is unclear. We investigated the mechanisms of VEGF-A -enhanced metastasis of the human melanoma cell line Mel57. Methods Stably transfected Mel57 cells, expressing VEGF-A or EGFP, were injected into the internal carotid artery or tail vein of nude mice to establish brain or lung metastases (colonization models). Subcutaneous tumors were grown to examine spontaneous metastasis to lung. Tumors and metastases were examined by (immuno)-histochemistry. Results In colonization models, VEGF-A expression did not give tumor cells a colonization advantage. Metastases originated predominantly by clonal expansion of single cells. In contrast, spontaneous metastasis from subcutaneous tumors was enhanced in tumors with VEGF-A expression, this enhanced metastatic potential was induced by a distinct architectural transformation of the s.c. tumors: while Mel57-EGFP and parental Mel57 tumors showed extensive necrosis, Mel57-VEGF-A tumors presented a micronodular growth pattern, with nodules protruding into sinusoidal dilated vasculature. These micronodules proved to be polyclonal, had tissue characteristics and caused metastatic embolism in the pulmonary artery with subsequent metastatic outgrowth. Conclusion VEGF-A may enhance spontaneous metastasis not simply by increased single cell shedding into the circulation by an increased tumor vascularity but by induction of a micronodular transformation of a tumor resulting in enhanced shedding of (polyclonal)tissue fragments into the circulation. This step of tumorintravasation is probably a rate limiting factor in development of metastasis.",

Lebedinskya, 2001) . Correction of the given infringements is the important problem of practical public health service. The aim of our research was development of a complex method of correction of cytogenetic infringements in patients with GH. Materials and methods We had investigated and treated 45 patients (complex treatment) with GH in the age of 18-50 years, with frequency of relapses of one time in 1.5-2 months. The control group was made by 30 healthy persons, same age group. Cytogenetic disturbances in T-lymphocytes of peripheral blood surveyed determined by metaphase method. Complex method of treatment of patients with GH included acyclovir 200 mg 5 times per day before clinical recovery and Phytopreparation \"Bacplan\", received by an original way from Quercus cortex. Phytopreparation \"Bacplan\" shows immunomodulation, anti-inflammatory and antimutagen properties. Preparation \"Bacplan\" appointed per Os 1.0 g per day within 20 days. External -2% solution of Bacplan in the form of lotion on affected body parts 5 time in day. Results Average frequency of cells with aberrations of chromosomes (AC) in T-lymphocytes of peripheral blood of patients with GH before treatment were much higher in comparison with parameters of control group (accordingly 2.3\u00b10.13 and 1.47\u00b10.14% P<0.05). In patients were marked disturbance of chromosomal and chrmotoid types. In 51.8% cases aberration of chromosomes were registered in 1-5 chromosome pairs. After complex treatment of average frequency of cells with AC in patients has decreases to 20 days to1.6\u00b10.11% (P<0.05) and practically come nearer to control parameter (1.47\u00b10.14%). Conclusions Thus, use of viral specific preparation acyclovir in combination with phytopreparation \"Bacplan\" reduces frequency of structural infringements of chromosomes in T-lymphocytes of patients with GH.",

The S-100 family of Ca-binding proteins comprises the A (1-6) and B isoforms. Recent microarray analysis identified S-100B as the melanocyte lineage marker. In this work we have compared the expression patterns of S-100 proteins using antibody recognizing both isoforms versus that which is specific for S-100B in 68 human skin primary melanoma samples. There were 3 expression patterns observed: focal, herogenous and diffuse for both antibodies. The most frequent expression pattern was the diffuse one (36-45%) while the least frequent was the focal pattern (10-14%) in case of both antibodies. When the individual cases have been analysed for the expression patterns for the two antibody we found 49% discrepancy. In about half of these cases (22%) the discrepancy was minor (heterogenous versus diffuse staining pattern), but in almost a third of the cases (27%) it was found to be considerable (focal pattern versus heterogenous or diffuse). We have concluded that the expression patterns of S-100 and S-100B proteins in human melanoma are frequently different. Since gene expression studies identified S-100B as linage marker, it is highly recommended to use monospecific antibody for routine diagnosis. Furthermore, S-100B is validated as sensitive serum marker for melanoma progression accordingly it is another indication for the use of anti-S-100B antibody in the routine diagnosis.",

They account for approximately 25% of primary cutaneous lymphomas. The most common forms include follicle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, immunocytoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We report 2 cases of primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, one in the left gluteal region (4/5 cm in diameter), and the other in the left leg (5/3 cm in diameter), both appearing clinically ulcerated. Materials and methods Routine paraffin embedding and usual stainings, followed by immunohistochemistry were used. Results Microscopy evidentiated in the papillary and reticular dermis a diffuse pattern of growth of cells with a moderate degree of morphologic variation, with moderate, slightly basophilic cytoplasm and round-ovalar nuclei, with vesicular aspect owing to margination of chromatin at the nuclear membrane, 1-2 nucleoli, and frequent mitoses. Gomory staining revealed a network of reticulin with reduced intervening spaces. Immunohistochemistry evidentiated a diffuse positivity of vimentin and CD20 (L26), S100 positivity in few cells, desmin negativity, MIC 2 negativity, CD30 (BERH2/Ki-1) negativity, actin negativity in tumor, but positivity in vessels, EMA negativity and PCNA positivity in almost 50% of the cells. Conclusion Final diagnoses of primary cutaneous diffuse large Bcell lymphomas were considered correlating the clinical, morphologic, and immunophenotyping features. Although prognosis of most primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas is favorable, with 5-year survival rates over 90%, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is more aggressive. We appreciated an unfavorable prognosis of both cases, but especially in the patient where the lymphoma occurred in the lower leg, as this location is associated with a more aggressive behaviour.",

A 72-year-old man had a polypoid lesion of the scalp measuring 3.5 cm in diameter. The lesion was surgically removed and, at histology, it was composed of a nodular basal cell carcinoma. Below the basal cell carcinoma, there was a well circumscribed but not encapsulated lesion constituted by small, packed glands separated by cellular stroma, reminiscent of sclerosing adenosis of the breast. Some glands showed open lumina bordered by cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm while other glands were arranged in solid clusters or elongated cords. Two distinct layers of cells were seen bordering the glands: a luminal layer of cuboidal cells and an outer layer of basal cells with scanty cytoplasm and spindle nuclei. At immunohistochemistry the outer cell layer was positive for actin, calponin, caldesmon and keratin 14 antibodies showing therefore myoepithelial cell differentiation. The luminal layer was positive with low weight keratin; moreover luminal cells were decorated by GCDFP-15 antibody, a marker of apocrine differentiation. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case of sclerosing adenosis of the skin showing apocrine metaplasia of luminal cells.

The effectiveness of these antigens as target for active specific immunotherapy has been largely demonstrated. Recently a new human C\\T, called sperm protein 17 (HSp17) has been investigated in multiple myeloma and ovarian cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of HSp17 in healthy skin and melanocytic skin lesions, in order to evaluate the usefulness of this antigen to develop effective specific immunotherapeutic procedures. Methods The authors assessed the immunolocalization of HSp17 in paraffin embedded formalin fixed specimens of healthy skin (n=3) and tissues representing cutaneous melanocytic lesions [common nevi (n=15), Spitz nevi (n=5), blue nevi (n=7), atypical nevi (n=5) and melanomas (n=19)]. Results HSp17 was not detected in healthy skin. It was recognized with a high frequency in cutaneous melanocytic lesions in some cells of the dermal stroma, often containing melanin, compatible with melanophages. A higher expression of HSp17 was observed in hyperpigmented nevi. Conclusion The emergent complex function of HSp17 suggests the necessity of further studies to investigate the relation between melanophages and HSp17. Although HSp17 was not detected in healthy skin, its limited detection in resident melanophages recognized in cutaneous lesions, and not in tumoral cells precludes its applicability as target in skin cancer immunotherapy.",

The virus, which causes CCHF, is a Nirovirus from the Bunyaviridae family. Although primarily a zoonosis, sporadic cases and outbraces of CCHF affect humans. Case report A 43-year-old female patient was hospitalized due to sudden onset of fever, headache, vomiting and abdominal pain. During the next days, her condition became worse, she was unconscious, anuric, cyanotic with multiple edema on extremities, large vaginal coagulums and with appearance of haemorrhagic secretion in aspired fluid from the respiratory tract. Three days after admission, due to sudden onset of cardiac arrest, patient died. Pathologic findings: severe bleeding from the mucous membranes and internal organs were found, particularly emphasized in the liver, kidneys, heart, brain and other organs. Widespread hepatocellular necrosis with focal microvesicular steatosis and multiple intracytoplasmatic microvesicular inclusions were the most striking morphological findings. Diffuse necrosis of renal tissue was also found. Recent haemorrhages in lungs, cardiac muscle, suprarenal gland, spleen, and gastric mucosa were found. Lymphoid depletion was detected in lymph nodes. The RT-PCR method for detection CCHF virus has been applied in analysing serum and tissue samples. Serological testing and testing from paraffin embedded tissue were positive. Conclusion Autopsy pathologic findings of CCHF include widespread haemorrhages of the skin, mucous membranes, pleura, peritoneum.

The majority of cases among health care workers have occurred in doctors and nurses who have cared for SARS patients. Pathologists and laboratory personnel are regarded as low risk for infection because they are infrequently in direct contact with patients. However, they receive specimens, including sputa, bronchiolo-alveolar lavage samples, excised tissues, blood and body fluids from infectious cases. Two further possible sources of infection are during autopsies and the onsite processing of fine needle aspiration specimens for immediate diagnosis. Not uncommonly, few clinical details are attached with a specimen to alert the laboratory so universal precaution must be in place and all specimens regarded as infectious. But with a new infection such as SARS where information on its natural history, infectiousness and mode of transmission are still evolving, greater vigilance and a pro-active approach are needed.

Methods We studied four cases of ALCL with dominant neurologic symptoms in the form of vasculitis, dementia and cauda equina syndrome. The diagnosis was made by autopsy in three cases and by brain biopsy in one case. In one autopsy case, the ALCL was associated with AIDS in a 12-years old hemophilic boy. Results Microscopically, in all cases, small blood vessels of the CNS were distended by collections of large atypical lymphoid cells which obstructed the vascular lumina. Tumor cells cytoplasm was amphophilic, the nuclei were large, irregular with prominent nucleoli. Mitoses were numerous. In the vicinity, there were small zones of spongy edema, reactive gliosis and foci of total or selective necrosis. In an autopsy case with diagnosis 'vasculitis' (female 52-years) there was dissemination into multiple organs. Immunohistochemistry shows strong positivity for CD45 and CD20, and the negative reaction for CD3, CD45RO and Factor VIII-related antigen. Based on the above findings the diagnosis of angiotropic large B-cell lymphoma was made. Conclusion The antemortem diagnosis of ALCL of the CNS may be established by brain biopsy with application of immunohistochemistry.",

One group of animals afterwards was placed in closed chamber and exposed to mild hypoxemia, simulating posttraumatic hypoxemia. Both groups of animals (hypoxia-exposed and non-exposed) were treated by HBOT. Brains were cut through produced lesion and paraffin sections were stained by TUNEL method and for active caspase-3. Apoptotic cells (AC) were counted in five successive perilesional layers of 0.5 mm each. It was shown that in the group of rats that were exposed to hypoxia, the width of perilesional area and the number of AC were significantly higher than in non-hypoxic animals, raising from 12.2% to 31.8% at 0.5 mm (p<0.001).One treatment by HBOT induced significant decrease both in the radius of perilesional area and the number of AC in both groups of animals (in hypoxia-exposed animals this effect was even more pronounced).The results of our study prove the role of perilesional area in the 'growth' of CC. Hypoxemia caused profound increase in cell death extension. HBOT shows marked positive effect in both hypoxic and nonhypoxic animals. We used quantative pathologic monitoring of number of AC to develop the optimal regimen of HBOT in animal model of CC.",

Aims: We review the cases diagnosed between the years 1997 and 2003 in our hospital. Materials and methods The surgycal specimens were stained with hematoxilin-eosin and neural or glial immunostains after paraffin embeding. Results The most frequent lesion is Mesial Temporal Sclerosis (47-70% of the cases). Other causes are tumors; Dysembrioplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor (DNT), neuronal tumors and glial tumors. Less frequent lesions are phacomatosis, malformative lesions like cortical dysplasias or vascular malformations, vascular or trauma lesions and inflammatory or unspecified lesions. Mesial Temporal Sclerosis consists of neuronal loss and gliosis in sectors CA1, CA3, CA4 and dentate gyrus. Between 1997 and 2003 we diagnosed 43 cases; 24 were women and 19 were males. DNT is a very infrequent, intracortical tumor composed of glia and neurons, usually associated with cortical dysplasia. In our experience we diagnosed 6 cases; 4 women and 2 men. We have found other tumors associated with epilepsy; 7 cases of ganglioglioma (3 women and 4 men), 3 cases of gangliocytoma (1women and 2 men), and astrocytic tumors (6 Protoplasmic Astrocytomas, 1 Mixed Astrocytoma and 2 Fibrillary Astrocytomas). We also diagnosed other processes associated with epilepsy: 2 cases of cortical dysplasia, 9 of glial scar, 7 of gliosis or unspecified changes and 2 cases of vascular malformation.

Recently, HSp17 has been included in the cancer/testis antigens (CT) family and showed to be expressed in multiple myeloma and ovarian cancer. The aim of the study was to investigate the immunolocalization of HSp17 in specimens of nervous system malignancies, in order to establish the usefulness of this antigen as target for tumour-vaccine strategies for nervous system tumours. Methods The authors assessed the expression pattern of HSp17 in formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded surgical specimens of nervous system malignancies, including 25 neuroectodermal primary tumors (8 astrocytomas, 13 glioblastomas multiforme, 3 oligodendrogliomas, and 1 ependymoma); 19 meningeal tumours; and 5 peripheral nerve sheath tumours (4 schwannoma, and 1 neurofibroma), using a standardized immunohistochemical procedure. Results HSp17 was found to be expressed in a low number of tumoral cases (nearly 14%), with a major expression in astrocytomas histological group (25%). No case among peripheral nerve sheath tumours was found to be immunopositive for HSp17. The expression pattern was found heterogeneous in all of the positive samples and it does not correlate with the degree of malignancy. Conclusions The low frequency and the heterogeneous distribution of HSp17 suggest the useless of this antigen as unique target for immunotherapeutic strategies. However, the present study shows firstly the immunolocalization of HSp17 in some cells of nervous system tumors tissues. The emergent complex function of HSp17 renders necessary further studies to understand the link between positive-cells and this protein.",

The aims of this study were to evaluate in vitro FDDNP labeling of protein aggregates in selected \"conformational diseases\" of the brain and to determine if they fulfill the tinctorial and polarizing optics criteria for amyloid. Material and methods Brain sections of patients with confirmed AD, variant AD (vAD), amyloid angiopathy (AA), sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant CJD (vCJD), Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), Pick disease (PiD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) were labeled with FDDNP, Congo red (CR) and PAS. Analysis was performed using fluorescent microscope (FDDNP), and light microscope (CR and PAS) with polarizing optics (CR). Results In addition to senile plaques and NFT in AD and vAD FDDNP reliably labeled: prion plaques in CJD, vCJD and GSS, Lewy bodies in vAD and vascular amyloid in AA. It did not label Pick bodies in PiD, and globoid NFT in PSP. With the exception of FDDNP positive Hirano bodies in AD and Lewy bodies in vAD, CR and PAS stained all the FDDNP positive deposits. All CR positive aggregates also showed birefringence. Conclusion In our study, FDDNP labeled all protein aggregates that were shown to posses tinctorial and birefringent characteristics of amyloid, but also some that cannot be classified as amyloid. Aside from its potential for in vivo diagnostics of some neurodegenerative diseases, FDDNP may prove useful in labeling certain pathological protein aggregates in vitro.

Material and methods Histological slides obtained from 70 patients with AAH, and from 190 patients with potentially curatively operated lung adenocarcinomas including normal lung parenchyma are immunohistochemically stained with an anti CD34 antibody, and subject to quantitative image analysis. Syntactic structure analysis measures the absolute and relative features of vessels including the vessel-associated cellular densities. These data are compared in between and associated with tumor volume, post surgical TNM stage, and the patients' survival. Results AAH displays an increased level of vascularization characterized by regular size and increased number of newly formed vessels. Spatial agglutination (clusters formation) of vessels is common in AAH. The tumor vascularization (volume fraction Vv) amounts to 3% in AAH and to 7% in lung carcinomas, and increases in advanced tumor stages (pT4, pN3). AAH displays the lowest, advanced tumor stages the highest numerical vascular density. Minimum diameter and circumference of vessels maintain. The density of epithelial cells decreases with increasing distance from the vascular surface in both AAH and adenocarcinomas. It is the highest in advanced tumor stages. According to multivariate statistical analysis the patients' survival is closely associated with the pN-stage, tumor volume, cell type and the numerical density of tumor cells within a distance < 20m to the nearest neighboring vessel. Conclusion AAH is characterized by probably non-reversible changes in vascular density and spatial vessel clustering. Vascularization of pulmonary adenocarcinomas becomes altered in advanced tumor stages. Of prognostic significance is the distribution of tumor cells in relation to the nearest neighboring vessel only. Changes in vascularization probably play an important role in genesis and development of pulmonary adenocarcinomas.",

Material The study included the bronchobiopsy samples obtained from 31 sarcoid patients. The control group (CG) included 25 young healthy subjects who lost their lives in an accident, having the bronchus sampled at autopsy. The quantity of inflammatory and connective cells was measured by the stereometric numerical density method and the quantity of the connective fibres by the volume density method. Results In the examined group the total quantity of all cellular elements between the bronchial glands in S was estimated to range from 11.231/mm 3 to 101.739/mm 3 or 37.129/mm 3 on the average. In the CG, the quantity ranged from 10.653/mm 3 to 39.020/mm 3 , or 24.205/mm 3 on the mean. Besides cellular elements, connective fibres were also registered between the bronchial glands. In S, the connective fibres made 10% of the interstitium volume and only 5% of it in the CG. This difference is statistically significant. Conclusion In sarcoidosis, the total quantity of all cellular elements between the bronchial glands exceeds their quantity in the CG for 1.5 times. The most numerous are lymphocytes in both groups, but in S their quantity is 1.7 times as high as their quantity in the CG.

Material and methods Cryostat sections of both groups from infarction/rupture and controls were stained with Oil red O, Sudan black B (BDH Chemicals) and were reacted to anti-C-reactive protein (CRP), to complement C5a and C5b-9 (Dakopatts). Clinico-pathological findings Myocardial rupture occured in elder women with relative smaller weight of heart, thrombosis of one main coronary artery, location in the anterior wall at the first infarction within the first week. Microscopically the main observation is the large amount of granular lipid deposition in the area of myocardial rupture even in the cytoplasm of the necrotic myocardial fibers using Oil red O and Sudan black B staining. Immunohistochemistry: The anti-CRP and C5b-9 antibodies showed intense staining around the area of the rupture. The inflammatory cells were neutrophils in high numbers in both group. Eosinophils were represented in low percentage (below 10%). Conclusion The postulation is, that the granular myocardial lipids in the area of infarction/rupture are phospholipids (mainly mitochondrial cardiolipin), which through binding CRP induce pathologic complement activation. In experimental heart infarctions complement target (recombinant etc.) molecules could reduce the neutrophil chemotaxis to the area of necrosis and the size of the infarction.",

Methods Endomyocardial biopsy was performed during openheart surgery in 56 pts with end-stage DCM.

Material and methods Tissues of recipient mice were pretreated by fixation in 4% formalin followed by 20% sucrose, before embedding in OCT and freezing on dry ice. In addition tissues were also fresh frozen and exposed to formaldehyde vapor as cryostate sections. The GFP signals were validated using an anti GFP antibody. Additional markers investigated were CD11c, CD4, CD8, H-2Kb and H-2Kd. Results Vapor fixation of slides showed equal properties in containing GFP in comparison with the immersion method. GFP+ DCs were detected in small bowel, lymph nodes, thymus and spleen for up to 42 days after i.v. injection. Many of these GFP+ cells were positive for CD11c. The GFP signals could be validated on fluorescence and light microscopic level using anti GFP antibodies. Conclusions Allogeneic DCs survive in BMT recipients for up to 42 days.

The immunohistochemical panel included: estrogen and progesterone receptors, Her 2-neu protein, P-53, Ki-67, CKMNF116, vimentin, alpha-SMA. Results The patients ranged in age between 16 and 69 years. All patients presented with a palpable unilateral mass. The aspirates contained sheets of both bland ductal cells and lobular units. Adipose tissue was present in varying amounts. Typical macroscopical and microscopical features were noted. Immunohistochemical studies showed estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity in epithelial cells as well as in the stromal cells, in all 36 hamartomas.

This study was undertaken to identify whether assessment of excisional biopsy margins accurately predicts the presence or absence of residual tumor in the lumpectomy bed. Material and method The margin status of 166 consecutive lumpectomy specimens followed by re-excision, taken from an equal number of patients with primary breast carcinomas (148 infiltrating,18 in situ), were evaluated microscopically and classified as 'positive' if the tumor was found at the inked margin, 'negative' if the entire tumor was found in >0.1cm from the inked margins, 'close' if it was within 0.1cm of the inked margins, but did not transected them and 'indeterminate' if biopsy specimen was not inked or the tissue was fragmented. The tumor size and grade of the initial biopsy were also analyzed, as potential predictors for residual disease. Results Residual tumor was found in 42% of the patients (69/166): in 16%(10/61) of the cases with negative, in 64%(41/64) with positive, in 32% (8/25) with close and in 62.5%(10/16) with indeterminate margin status. In 36%(23/64) of the 'positive margins' and in 68%(17/25) of the 'close margins' cases no tumor was found in re-excised specimens. In 23%(16/69) of the cases the residual disease was composed entirely of an in situ component of the same histologic type as the initial biopsy. No relationship was found between tumor size or grade and residual disease. Conclusions For breast tumors histologically negative margins in biopsy specimens do not guarantee complete excision. 'Close' margins may be considered almost equal to 'positive' ones. Residual in situ carcinoma in the immediate vicinity of the previous biopsy site seems to represent the advanced edges of the tumor, apparently difficult to be excised completely and most likely responsible for the locally recurrent disease.",

Immunohistochemical markers for myoepithelial cells, such as smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC), have been shown to stain basal myoepithelial cells in normal mammary glands and fibrocystic changes. Absence of myoepithelial cells is associated with invasive carcinoma; however, we have observed occasional attenuation of SMMHC staining in SA. Studies evaluating the role of SMMHC in sclerosing adenosis have not been performed. The intent of this study is to further evaluate the staining pattern of SMMHC in SA with an infiltrative pattern. Materials and methods Twenty cases of SA with an infiltrative pattern were identified, H&E stained, and immunohistochemistry performed for SMMHC (M3558, Dako Corp), 4\u00b5g/ml, as primary antibody, using a polymer based Envision+ detection system (Dako Corp). Normal-breast tissue positive controls and negative isotype matched IgG1 controls were used. Cases were then classified into one of three categories: positive (staining >95% of myoepithelial cells), intermediate (51% -94%), or attenuated (<50%). Results Three of the first ten cases (30%) showed attenuated staining with SMMHC. The remaining seven cases demonstrated positive staining of myoepithelial cells. All cases exhibited positive staining within normal lobules, serving as an internal control for each case. Ten additional cases of SA have been identified and are being stained with SMMHC for evaluation. Conclusions Preliminary findings show that SMMHC yields inconsistent results when applied to SA with an infiltrative pattern. Such lesions can have features similar to invasive carcinoma on H&E, and application of SMMHC could produce misleading results.",

In order to initiate signal transduction, ErbB receptor monomers need to form homo-or hetero-dimers. The composition of these dimers is thought to greatly influence both quality and quantity of downstream signalling pathways, and to ultimately determine the elicited biological response. Material and methods The protein expression pattern of all four ErbB receptors EGF-R, Her-2/neu, Her-3 and Her-4, and expression of their putative ligands EGF, TGF-a and HRG was investigated in 74 women with invasive breast cancer by membrane isolation and Western blot analysis. Results The co-expression of all four ErbB family members was detected in 79,7% of cases, and of all of the three investigated ligands in 82,4%. While we did not observe a correlation between EGFR and Her-2/neu or Her-4 protein expression, EGFR and Her-3 (p=0.005), and Her-3 and Her-4 (p=0.05) were clearly coexpressed. The strongest overall correlation, however, was found between Her-2/neu and Her-3 (p=0.001) and between Her-2/neu and Her-4 (p=0.001).

In a prior study on mammary carcinomas, we found that high Fra-1 and reduced FosB expression are associated with indicators of poor prognosis. As most of the proteases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix and basal membrane (matrix-metalloproteinases, members of the uPA/PAIsystem) are regulated by AP-1 complexes, we assumed that the expression of single AP-1 proteins might also be important for the process of invasion of breast cancer cells. Method In order to analyze the influence of the single Fos family members (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1 and Fra-2) on the invasive behavior of mammary cancer, we performed Western Blot analysis of MMP1 and MMP9 and of the members of the plasminogen activator system PAI-1, uPAR, and PAI-1-uPA-complexes in 75 breast cancer samples, and correlated the expression of these proteins with that of the AP-1 proteins. Results Interestingly, c-Fos, Fra-1 (phosphorylated form), and Fra-2 correlated with MMP9 expression levels. High expression of Fra-2 was also significantly associated with that of PAI-1 and the SDS-insoluble uPA/PAI-1 complex. On the other hand, the expression of FosB was significantly associated with high levels of MMP1. Conclusion Our results indicate that a shift in AP-1 protein expression, especially high expression of Fra-1 and Fra-2, might be involved in invasion of breast cancer cells.

The data were also compared with the tumour size, histologic type, grade and age. Immunohistochemistry with the ER (DAKO-1D5-N1575) and PR (DAKO-PgR 636-N1630) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue was used. The ER status in primary tumours and lymph node metastases was concordant in 45 patients (78,9%) and discordant in 12 (21,1%). Six of these eleven patients had ER-positive primary tumours and ER-negative lymph node metastases. The PR status in primary and lymph node metastases was concordant in 43 patients (75,4%) and discordant in 14 patients (24,5%). Ten of these twenty-four patients had PRnegative primary tumours and PR-positive lymph node metastases. We observed higher PR positivity in axillary lymph node metastases. The parameters, tumour histology, grade and age showed no statistically significant relation with receptor status. There was a significant correlation between the tumour size and the number of axillary lymh node metastases. The discordance of hormone receptors status between the primary tumour and lymph node metastases might be due to the heterogenity of tumour cells or loss of the phenotypic features of metastatic cells.",

The material concerned mastectomies with ispilateral lymph nodes dissection specimens. The patients were classified according the TNM staging system, based upon the primary tumor size (T), the presence of regional axillary nodal involvement (N) and distant metastases (M). This categorization revealed a preponderance of patients with T2 tumors. The overall decade rate for T1, T2 and T3 tumors was 51, 0,1%\u00b12,77%, 31,86%\u00b12,58% and 17,13%\u00b1 1,9%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the three groups (p<0,0001). The annual distribution of these groups revealed that since 1992 the mean group rate had a tendency to approach the corresponding decade rate, a finding suggesting some degree of stabilization of these proportions. On the other hand, the lymph node metastases were more common in the T3 tumors. The mean rate for T3N+, T2N+ and T1N+ was 76,53%\u00b15,9%, 66,01%\u00b13,01% and 42,09%\u00b1-4,88%, respectively; the difference is statistically significant for the T3N+ and T2N+ (p<0,004) as well as for T2N+ and T1N+ (p<0,0001). The annual overall rate of patients with lymph nodes metastases, independently of T (TN+) was 60,09%\u00b1 2,73%.

In the present study, we assessed the numerical status of chromosomes 16 and X in 114 primary invasive breast carcinomas in relation to clinicopathological parameters, patients' overall survival, and indices of cell growth (c-erbB-2, topoisomerase IIa) and survival (caspase-3, bcl-2). Material and methods The number of copies of both chromosomes was detected by interphase chromogenic in situ hybridization with pericentromeric probes on paraffin embedded sections. ER, PR, cerbB-2, topoIIa, caspase-3 and bcl-2 expression was immunohistochemically detected (ABC/HRP). The results were statistically assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results Polysomy of chromosomes 16 and X was detected as the predominant aberration (73.7% and 57.9% respectively). Gain of chromosome 16 copies was associated with high nuclear grade (p=0.009), increased tumor size (p=0.041), advanced stage (p=0.002), the expression of topoIIa proliferation index (p=0.005), and worse overall survival by multivariate analysis (p=0.0317). The levels of chromosome X polysomy were elevated in ductal carcinomas of high histological grade (p=0.008), in high nuclear grade tumors (p=0.001), and were associated with the expression of topoIIa (p=0.005) and loss of caspase-3 protein (p=0.036). In addition, gain of chromosome X copies was an independent predictor of impaired prognosis of ductal carcinomas (p=0.0414). Conclusion Polysomy of chromosomes 16 and X was observed as the predominant alteration in phenotypically aggressive breast tumors, characterized by poor differentiation, increased growth potential and impaired prognosis, whereas gain of chromosome X in particular, is probably implicated in cell survival.",

Material and methods In a retrospective review of 2,052 imaging guided LNCBs (1993-2001), we found: 19 (0.9%) BPL -9 with surgical correlation (SC) and 10 with mammographic follow-up (MF); 21 RS (1%) with SC in 6 and MF in 15; 15 (0.7%) FLSH all with SC; 54 (2.6%) ADH -with SC in 40, and 174 (8.5%) DCISwith SC in 118. Results 1) BPL: 10 patients without changes in MF. At surgery: 5 BPL -1 with ADH and 4 invasive carcinomas (3 with mammographic histologic discordance and 1 diagnosed 4 years post LNCB). 2) RS: 15 without mammographical changes and 6 RS (3 with ADH). 3) FLSH: at surgery, 3 fibroadenomas, 11 benign and 1 malignant phyllodes tumours. 4) ADH: at surgery, 19 (47.5%) ADH, 12 (30%) DCIS, 9 (22.5%) invasive carcinomas -2 of which microinvasive. 5) DCIS: at surgery, 64 (54.2%) DCIS; 12 (10.1%) microinvasive, and 42 (35.6%) invasive carcinomas. Conclusions 1) Diagnosis of BPL at LNCB seems accurate when correlating with image findings. 2) RS at LNCB can be followed mammographically. 3) FLSH at LNCB always requires surgical excision. 4) ADH and DCIS diagnosed at LNCB need complete removal of lesion, due to frequent underdiagnosis.",

The aim of this study was to investigate ERb protein expression in a well documented series of 181 invasive breast carcinomas. Materials and methods Standard immunohistochemistry with a specific monoclonal antibody (clone PPG5/10, Serotec) was performed on paraffin sections; 10% of strongly immunostained carcinoma cells was used as a cutoff point to classify tumors as ERb-positive. Statistical correlations were sought with clinicopathological variables (including hormone receptor status) and patients' disease-free and overall survival. Cell proliferation was immunohistochemically assessed by topoisomerase IIa (topoIIa) index. Statistical analysis was univariate and multivariate. Results ERb immunoreactivity was detected in the majority of specimens (71.2%)and was positively linked with ERa immunoreactivity (p<0.001) and increased topoIIa index (p=0.045). A significant favorable impact of ERb immunopositivity emerged with regard to disease-free and overall survival in both univariate (p=0.0002, p=0.0002, respectively) and multivariate (p=0.001 and p=0.011 respectively) statistical analysis; progesterone receptor expression was also found to exert an independent favorable influence on patient's survival with less statistical significance though (p=0.045 and p=0.041). On the contrary, patients' survival was not significantly impacted by ERa status. Conclusions Because of the positive association between ERb immunoreactivity and topoIIa expression, the presence of ERb in breast cancer cells may be considered an indication of increased proliferation. Nevertheless, ERb immunoreactivity emerges as a valuable, independent indicator of favorable prognosis. Aims To determine diagnostic value of LNCB in patients with ILC using EC and CK34ssE12.",

Immunohistochemical (IHQ) study with EC and CK34ssE12 was performed at both LNCB and SB. Three immunoprofiles were established: EC-CK34ssE12 + (IHQ of ILC); EC + CK34ssE12 -(IHQ of ductal carcinoma -IDC) and EC + CK34ssE12 + (IHQ of mixed ILC-IDC). Initial diagnosis at LNCB was correlated with final diagnosis (morphologically and immunoprofile). Discordant cases were analysed in order to determine usefulness of IHQ at LNCB. Results In LNCBs initially diagnosed as: 1) ILC (19 patients), final diagnosis was ILC in 18 cases (EC-CK34ssE12+) and IDC in 1 case (EC+ CK34ssE12 -); 2) Invasive carcinoma probably lobular type (ILCp) (26 patients), final diagnosis was ILC in 20 cases (EC-CK34ssE12+), IDC in 4 (EC+ CK34ssE12 -) and mixed ILC-IDC in 2 (EC+ CK34ssE12+); 3) IDC (5 patients), final diagnosis was ILC in all cases (EC-CK34ssE12+), 3 of them ILC pleomorphic-type. In all discordant cases, immunoprofile at LNCB was concordant with final diagnosis Conclusion 23% of patients diagnosed as ILCp at LNCB corresponded finally to IDC or mixed IDC-ILC. 11.6% of patients finally diagnosed as ILC were initially interpreted as IDC at LNCB. Our findings suggest that EC and CK34ssE12 are of great value to help characterise breast carcinomas at LNCB, and improve management of patients. Background HER-2 status became an important prognostic and predictive factor in breast carcinoma. There are two main techniques of evaluation HER2 status: immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the protein expression and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) for amplification of HER2 gene. The aim of the study was to compare the results obtained by IHC and FISH methods in determination of HER2 status in breast cancer. Materials and methods Two hundred breast cancer specimens were examined. IHC and FISH were performed in every case. IHC was performed with DAKO HercepTest, FISH with Oncor-QBiogene reagents. IHC results were classed into 4 groups, accordingly to the intensity of membrane staining (0,1+, 2+, 3+). FISH results were divided into three main categories: NA -no amplification, LA -low amplification and HA -high amplification. The number of copies of chromosome 17 was also assessed. Results Over 87% of cases described by IHC as 3+ exhibited also amplification of HER2/neu gene. Remaining cases were positive with IHC, but presented no gene amplification. This might be due to the subjective assessment of the membrane staining or to the procedure of material fixation. Another possibility is that overexpression of the protein was caused by mRNA stability or disorders in receptor circulation. The majority of cases classed by IHC as 2+ were also negative by FISH (over 75%). Nearly one fifth of IHC 2+ were found to exhibit gene amplification. Remaining cases showed no amplification of HER2/neu gene, combined with aneuploidy of chromosome 17. All cases described by IHC as 0/1+ showed no amplification. Conclusions IHC is well-established method of assessing HER2 status in breast cancer. Nonetheless, group of cases described as 2+ should be additionally examined using FISH method because the results are more reliable. In order to improve accuracy and gain the highest quality of HER2 status evaluation, in those cases both methods should be applied.",

It seems that breast cancer first detected by the age of 20-40 years follows more aggressive clinical course than tumors developing later. Young females with breast cancer more frequently present with axillary lymph nodes metastases. Expression of the estrogene receptors is less frequent, and the histological grade is usually higher among this group. The main purpose of our study was the evaluation, quantification, and comparison of the angiogenesis in breast cancer among young women, below the age of 35 years and older patients, above 60 years. Material and methods Tissue samples of breast cancer from patients aged 35 years and less (50 cases), and from patients older than 60 (20 cases) were studied. Ten specimens of non-neoplastic breast tissue from the normal breast in the tumor vicinity (younger patients) served as a control. Microvessels were visualized immunohistochemically with use of CD-34 antibody and counted within the areas of the highest density (\"hot spots\"). Six separate high power fields (HPF), 0.216 mm2 each, were studied in each case. Results and conclusion The average microvessels count per HPF in the breast cancer tissue in younger group was higher than in the older age group and non-neoplastic tissue.

Pigmented mammary Paget disease is a rare clinicopathologic variant of mammary Paget disease. It may mimic malignant melanoma clinically and histophatologically. It seems that involvement of the dermo-epidermal junction by neoplastic cells of the mammary Paget carcinoma seems to be a prerequisite for the development of the clinical pigmentation. We report a case of pigmented mammary Paget disease. The patient was a 65-year-old male who complained of an erythematous, pigmented scaly plaque around his right nipple measuring 8x6 cm with mild fissuring of two year duration. The histopathology revealed pagetoid spread of large cells in the epidermis with pigmentation of basal cells and melanocytes. The IHC confirmed the mammary Paget disease and excluded malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma.",

            "text": "Frozen section evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer Introduction The use of Sentinel Concept as the newest approach in surgical treatment of breast cancer, apart from tumorectomy, means the extirpation and analysis of one or more regional lymph nodes which receives lymph drainage from primary tumor (guardian lymph nodes -sentinel nodes). The presence or the absence of secondary deposit in them is considered the most important predictor of the positive secondary deposit status of the other axillary lymph nodes. Depending on histological analysis of sentinel node, the operation is finished with or without the axillary lymph node dissection. Materials and methods Sentinel concept in surgical treatment of the breast cancer is applied only in the cases where the largest dimension of the tumor is not more than 2cm (pT1). Marking of the sentinel node is conducted before the operation by a combined method, the usage of Patent Blau color and Technetium 99m as a radio marker. Sentinel lymph nodes identity, before sending to a pathohistological analysis, is checked by gamma detection probe. Two groups of prospective tests (A and B) were formed with 50 cases each. Sentinel lymph nodes from group A in the first stage of the testing were treated by pathohistological method (one hematoxylin and eosin preparation) and then microscoped. The cases in which secondary deposit was not noted, were subjected to a serial cutting and immunohistochemical staining by the EMA markers, specific for intraductal epithelium of a breast. Sentinel nodes from group B were submitted fresh for frozen section investigation, where they were approached with a series of cuttings and immunohistochemical analysis by the EMA markers. The nodes without secondary deposits were fixed in formalin, paraffin embedded and, with the application immunohistochemistry (EMA), submitted to serial cutting (similar to the second phase in group A) as a precaution. Results In the first stage 50 paraffin samples (group A) were first examined by H&E method, and additionally with immunohistochemistry (using EMA). With this additional examination secondary deposits were found in 6 cases (12 %). This can only prove already known fact about statistically significant higher sensitivity and specifity of immunohistochemistry compared to H&E. In the second stage (group B) 50 new samples of SN, first investigated by frozen section investigation, were examined by immunohistochemichal method (using EMA). In addition, these samples were serially cut and treated like paraffin samples by immunohistochemistry method. The results of these two analysis were identical. Facts mentioned above show that sensitivity and specifity of the frozen section analysis using immunohistochemical method (EMA) is 100% (high percentage is probably the consequence of a relatively small number of samples). Discussion Acquired data suggested that implementation of one of the used methods (serial frozen section analysis with immunohistochemistry) from the Sentinel Concept is an efficient histo-morphological method in the evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes that make valid intraoperative staging of breast carcinoma possible. The authors came to significant data in both groups of tests and determined sensitivity, particularity and the efficiency of the applied methods. Conclusion Application of the suggested method would spare a considerable number of patients with pT1 breast cancer of subsequent axillary lymph node dissection and thus reduce the number of postoperative complications and long term morbidity.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate methods accuracy and to emphasize the main detectable prognostic factors. Materials and methods 809 core biopsies (398 NCBs and 411 SMBs) were performed between January 2000 and December 2002. In 483/510 cases, the correlation between biopsy results and subsequent surgical excision was available. Results The lesion diameter was < 1 cm (in 45 % of the NCBs and 72 % of the SMBs). With SMB, the average number of tissue core obtained per lesion was 12. At histology, in 67 % of NCB and in 48% of SMB diagnosis of malignancy was given. The DCIS/IDC ratio was 46/219 for NCB and 93/78 for SMB, respectively. Grade and type of the invasive and in situ carcinoma were determined in both biopsy and definitive excision, and the results compared. The agreement for overall grade was in 82 % with SMB and in 66 % with NCB. At surgical excision, 26/139 DCIS showed foci of IDC. In 15 % of SMB cases no residual neoplastic tissue was found. Conclusions The accuracy of both methods is very high. SMB shows highest reliability and accuracy, because of the increased quantity of tissue obtained. The possibility to assess tumour size is limited. The preoperative assessment of the other prognostic factors (type and grade, tumour markers) are key determinants in planning the optimal breast lesions management.",

The aim of this study was to determine the possible correlation between tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and the number of MCP-1 mRNA in the invasive breast carcinoma. Material and methods Tissues obtained from 27 surgical specimens of invasive breast carcinomas and 8 cases of normal breast tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 o C until they were used for quantification of MCP-1 mRNA by RT-PCR. The expression was calculated as a number of MCP-1 cDNA copies per 100 copies of G-6-PHD mRNA. Paraffin embedded sections from breast carcinomas were immunohistochemically processed for CD68 staining. Positively stained tumor associated macrophages (TAM) were counted on three \"hot spots\" (x 400) and mean value was calculated. Results The result of RT-PCR showed that in all cases of breast carcinomas (27/27) and the majority of normal breast tissues (7/8) the number of detected MCP-1 cDNA copies was above the detection limit. Furthermore, carcinomas showed higher levels of MCP-1 mRNA (229.5 \u00b1 275.6) then normal breast tissue (48.06 \u00b1 69.5). The value of TAM within a single carcinoma was very inconsistent (48.3 \u00b1 23.8). Statistical analysis did not find a significant correlation between MCP-1 expression and macrophage infiltrations (r= -0,19592) . Conclusion MCP-1 is an important factor in the recruitment of macrophages. However, the results indicate that MCP-1 is probably not the only and/or crucial factor involved in macrophage attraction to tumor locus in breast carcinomas.",

Therefore, the metastatic tumor should be composed of more aggressive tumor cell clones than the primary one. We analyzed mitotic index, proliferation antigen Ki-67, estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), cathepsin D activity, protein p53, and Bcl-2 oncoprotein status in order to explore the assumed differences in the clonal composition between the primary breast cancer and axillary metastasis. Materials and methods ER, PR, p53, Bcl-2, Ki-67, and cathepsin D statuses in 60 patients with the primary ductal invasive carcinoma of the breast and at least one axillary metastatic lesion were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC -DAKO LSAB2 System). Mitotic index was assessed by counting the number of mitoses in primary and metastatic lesions. Statistical analysis included t-test for dependent samples, linear correlation analysis, and ROC-curve based contingency table analysis.

The terms lipid-rich and lipid-secreting breast carcinomas encompass breast tumours in which neoplastic cells accumulate or secret lipid; however, lipoblasts are not usually seen. Recently, we have observed a distinctive type of breast carcinoma in which pleomorphic lipoblast-like cells were seen admixed with the carcinomatous component. An 82-year-old female presented with a 5cm hard lump in the right breast with palpable nodes in the right axilla. Mammography and ultrasound disclosed two irregular dense central masses in the right breast, measuring 5cm in aggregate, and an enlarged axillary node measuring approximately 3cm. A diagnosis of breast carcinoma was made and the patient received neoadjuvant tamoxifen despite the lack of estrogen receptor (ER) in the primary tumour. Four months later, her disease had progressed and she underwent right mastectomy with axillary dissection.. Histologically, both the primary tumour and the 3/24 lymph node metastases were characterised by a high-grade carcinomatous component which imperceptibly merged with pleomorphic lipoblast-like cells. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated epithelial differentiation in the carcinomatous and liposarcomatouslike components (epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratins 5/6, 8/18, 14, 19 and MNF116) . Both components were also positive for vimentin, S-100 protein, and focally for chromogranin, GCDFP-15, and E-cadherin. Hormone receptors (estrogen, progesterone and androgen receptors), Her2/neu, p63, smooth muscle actin, desmin, synaptophysin were negative. Based on the histological and immunohistochemical profile, we believe that this case represents a breast carcinoma with basaloid phenotype and showing divergent differentiation (liposarcomatous and neuroendocrine), features that have to our knowledge not been documented to date.",

CS is an incidental finding that usually occurs in association with benign proliferative and pre-invasive lesions. Adenomyoepithelioma is a biphasic neoplasm of the breast, composed of both luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Despite the shared histogenesis, CS has never been described in association with adenomyoepithelioma. We report a case of a 48year-old female who presented with CS of the breast arising in an adenomyoepithelioma. The differential diagnosis included adenoid cystic carcinoma.

Myoepithelial cells of the adenomyoepithelioma and the cells surrounding the collagen spherules of CS showed a similar profile (CKs 14 and 5/6, SMA, calponin, SMMHC, p63, and S100 reactivity), luminal cells of both lesions also showed overlapping immunophenotypes (Ck19, ER and PgR positivity). Collagen IV highlighted the spherules in CS. Ki67 labelling indices were similar in both lesions. C-kit expression was restricted to the adenomyoepithelioma and no expression was observed in the CS.

The nuclear DNA-content has been measured by CAS-200 (Beckton Dickinson, Image analysis) on intraoperative cytologic samples of the tumour (imprints). The tumours have been divided into diploid, tetraploid, aneuploid and hyperdiploid. Results 37 of all patients had aneuploid and multiploid histogram, whereas 75% of them had developed distant metastases. Lymph metastases have been registered in 15% of the cases with diploid histogram. S-phase has been considerably higher in patients with aneuploid than those with diploid histogram. The survival of 57 of all 68 patients has been analyzed as to the type of their histogram and as to the presence of metastases in lymph nodes and distant organs. The results showed that 9 breast cancer patients (15.7%) with aneuploid histogram and metastases in lymph nodes had a survival of less than 5 years, compared to the better survival rate of those patients with diploid histogram and no metastases in lymph nodes.

Our aim was to investigate the effect of HCH on angiogenesis induced by breast carcinoma and to elucidate the possible mechanisms by which it inhibits the progression of the cancer. Material and method Fifty-one patients with invasive ductal carcinoma were included in the study. Of 51 cases 28 had HCH and 23 had no HCH. All patients were followed for a mean of 48 months after radical mastectomy. The intratumoral microvessel density (MVD) was evaluated immunohistochemically using anti-CD31 antibody and correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. Also the expression of bFGF and VEGF were examined immunohistochemically and graded semiquantitatively. Results MVD was significantly correlated with tumor grade, VEGF and bFGF expression, recurrence, lymph node metastases (LNM), distant metastases (DM) and survival (p<0.01). Patients without HCH had significantly higher MVD (77.4 8.2) than those with HCH (54 5) (p<0.05). In addition the risk of LNM and DM were found higher in cases without HCH when compared to cases with HCH (p<0.05). Both bFGF and VEGF expression showed significant negative correlation with HCH (p<0.05).

We think that the use of CD10 combined with SMA is helpful in the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant lesions (epitheliosis vs intraductal carcinoma, tubular carcinoma vs atrophy, adenosis vs invasive ductal carcinoma, papilloma vs intracystic papillary carcinoma). Introduction The identification of myoepithelial cells in breast lesions remains of diagnostic value for the discrimination between benign and malignant lesions. P63 is a p53 homologue, which is expressed in epithelial basal cells of different organs. The aim of the present study has been to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of p63 in breast lesions. Materials and methods We examined immunohistochemically 266 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, archival breast samples, which consisted of 140 benign lesions and 126 malignancies (30 in situ carcinomas, 62 invasive ductal carcinomas, NST and 34 invasive carcinomas special type). The monoclonal antibodies anti-p63 (Biocare Medical/Menarini), anti-a-smooth muscle actin (Biogenex) and anti-S-100 protein (Biogenex) were used. Results In all cases, p63 expression was nuclear. In all benign lesions, there was an almost continuous basal rim surrounding the epithelial structures, whereas it was present but discontinuous in the in situ carcinomas. All invasive ductal carcinomas, NST, were devoided of p63 staining. P63 immunoreactivity was noted in a minor fraction of neoplastic cells in 15/24 (62.5%) in situ papillary carcinomas and in 9/27 (33.3%) invasive papillary carcinomas. The stromal cells were negative to p63. There were S-100 positive luminal epithelial cells in almost all cases, whereas many fibroblasts of the stroma were positive to smooth muscle actin. Conclusion It appears that p63 is a more sensitive and specific myoepithelial marker than those currently used, with no staining of stromal myofibroblasts. The observed staining in scattered cells, only in papillary neoplasms, might be a clue to the speculated different histogenesis of this specific type of breast tumors.",

A comparative study Introduction The prognostic and predictive implications of oncogene HER2/neu activation are very controversial, due to the extensive variation of results, mainly due to the different methods applied. Activation of HER2 in node positive patients as an independent prognostic factor has been established and correlated with tumour sensitivity to different therapeutic agents. The overexpression of this membrane receptor has converted it into a new therapeutic aim, requiring the application of a more suitable methodology for each case. Objectives To evaluate the most suitable method (immunohistochemical vs. FISH) to determine HER2 activation and its correlation with other prognostic factors. Material and methods A study of 42 cases of invasive breast carcinoma. Histological type: 90% infiltrating ductal carcinoma; age: 30-77, hormonal receptors: 61.9% (RH+), 23.8% (RH-); histological grade (Bloom-Richardson mod): 14.2% (G1), 28.5% (G2), and 47.6% (G3).

One of the reason is that starting sites of invasion from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) might be extremely diminutive that routine histopathological examination should hardly reveal them usually. Thus, we examined a large number of complete serial sections from breast carcinomas so as to find out destroyed sites of duct wall from which carcinoma cells have started on invasion. Also we reconstructed 3D images from the sections so as to visualize the sites and to measure the size of those. Materials and methods Used were three surgical specimens of breast cancer having extensive intraductal components with multiple invasive foci. After formalin fixed and paraffin embedded, six blocks from three cases were selected and sectioned serially in 3\u00b5m thickness. Total amount of the serial sections reached 724 sheets (mean 121/1block) indicating 2.172\u00b5m in actual thickness. After HE stained, invasive lesions connected with DCIS were searched and the lesions were reconstructed as 3D images with a computer-assisted-3D-reconstruction system. Results Although numerous sections containing multiple invasive foci were examined, areas which connected with DCIS to invasive lesion through the destroyed site of duct wall were only three. The site were approximately 100\u00b5m, 150um and 50\u00b5m in diameter respectively, should be called as 'hole' of the duct wall. Invasive lesions were extended along the ducts with the holes.

Immunohistochemical staining was performed on formalin fixed, paraffin sections, using an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique. A rabbit polyclonal antibody for human VEGF was used at a 1:100 dilution. Immunoreactivity was scored from 0 to 3+. Results 44 (61,3%) of all invasive carcinomas showed VEGF expression (ductal: 61%, mucinous: 100%). All but 2 lobular carcinomas were negative or weakly positive. Both papillary carcinomas showed strong positivity. Staining in DCIS was generally absent or weak. VEGF positivity correlated inversely with nodal involvement (p=0.001) and RE status (p=0.05). There were no correlation of VEGF staining with tumor size, histological grade, p53 and c-erbB-2. Conclusion Expression of VEGF is characteristically weak or absent in lobular carcinomas and them no relevant as a prognostic factor in this type of carcinomas. As VEGF staining correlate with absence of nodal involvement, its prognostic value may be mainly due to facilitate invasion of blood vessels, more than to lymphatic spread. Introduction Squamous carcinoma accounts for approximately 90% of all primary vulvar carcinomas. Although the anatomic localization of this tumor allows early diagnosis and considerably easy surgical accessibility, the prognosis for these patients remains relatively grim. The explanation for this finding should be sought in the fact that most of the patients are diagnosed in the advanced clinical stage of the disease. Since radical vulvectomy (a complex and debilitating procedure) is often a therapy of choice, the recent studies have been focused on determining reliable prognostic parameters that would allow individualized, and hopefully simpler therapeutic modalities to be applied in a certain group of patients with the same effectiveness. The aim of this study was to determine the most important clinical and histopathological parameters that influence the prognosis and outcome of patients with invasive squamous carcinoma of the vulva in order to offer them the most suitable form of therapy. Moreover, it was designed to assess the clinical significance of DNA content analysis by flow cytometry. Patients and methods 43 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, diagnosed between 1978. and 1996. were selected. In order to assess the influence of the various prognostic factors on survival, the study included clinical and pathohistological parameters as well as the results of flow cytometric DNA analysis of paraffinembedded tumor samples from all cases. Clinicopathological parameters focused on the age of patients, clinical stage of the disease, menstrual status, diameter and localization of the tumor, histological grade, nuclear grade, combined histological and nuclear grade, depth of tumor invasion, tumor growth pattern, presence of giant cells in the tumor and the form of therapy, while the flow cytometric DNA analysis comprised DNA ploidy, proliferative activity and DNA index.",

Areas of hyaline or myxoid degeneration of the stroma were found. Mitoses were not found although the tumor was examined by three independent pathologists from different countries. The tumor margin looked infiltrative. The tumor was immunohistochemically positive for vimentin, smooth actin and desmin. Cytokeratin MNF 116, EMA, S-100, CD-34, and CD-117 were negative. Conclusion We describe a vulvar smooth muscle tumor with marked polymorphism, without mitoses, with myxoid changes in the stroma and with infiltrative margins. Because of all these characteristics the tumor was considered biologically aggressive and additional surgery with resection of the tumor site and regional lymphadenectomy was performed. Three years after the last surgery the patient is alive and well.",

It is associated with shallow invasion of the placental cytotrophoblast within uterus developing decidual vasculopathy and results in dereased blood flow. The aim of the present report is to determine whether hypoxia influences the rates of apoptosis and proliferation and to compare them with those of normal controls. Materials and methods Samples were taken from 20 liveborn, singleton preeclamptic pregnancies and 20 normal controls. We used routine light microscopy, immunohistochemical and quantitative studies for Bcl-2, and Bax (to assess apoptosis) and PCNA (to assess cellular proliferation). Bcl-2-and PCNA-positive trophoblast cells were counted in a minimum of 10 high-powered fields, of 3 consecutive sections free from any infarction of at least 3 paraffin blocks.

The aim of this study was to clarify the relation between versican and hyaluronan in epithelial ovarian cancer and to find out if versican expression affects prognosis in these patients. Materials and methods Localization of versican was studied immunohistochemically in 299 primary epithelial ovarian cancers and their 43 metastases, as well as in 6 normal ovary specimens. The staining was scored according to the percentage area of strong versican signal of total peri-and intratumoural stroma as low or high. Epithelial staining of the tumours was scored as positive or negative. Results Low and high levels of strong stromal versican staining were observed in 133 and 166 carcinomas, respectively. A low level of strong stromal versican was found to be a significant marker for early FIGO stage and mucinous histology. Stromal versican staining correlated significantly with stromal hyaluronan staining. Cancer cell-associated versican positivity was seen in 151 tumours and correlated with clear cell histology and early FIGO stage. The 5-year prognosis of patients decreased with increasing stromal versican levels for overall survival. The 5-year prognosis for recurrence-free survival was slightly better when cancer cells were positive for versican. In Cox's multivariate analysis neither stromal nor cancer cell-associated versican had any prognostic value. Conclusion Enhanced stromal versican expression correlates with hyaluronan accumulation and is associated with unfavourable disease outcome, but it is not an independent prognostic marker in epithelial ovarian cancer.",

Therefore, differentially expressed genes in normal and malignant cervical epithelial cells and the feasibility of gene expression profiling on cervical cells obtained by regular cervical swabs were investigated. Material and methods Cervical epithelial cells obtained by regular cytobrushes from 3 women with high-risk HPV positive invasive cervical cancer and from 3 HPV negative women without suspicious PAP smears were pooled and subjected to cDNA array analysis. Dot blotting was then performed to detect the proteins which corresponded to the most highly up-regulated genes in the cDNA array analysis. Results mRNA expression of c-erbB-2, C-kit, VEGFR-1, N-myc, K-ras, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 4 (p16INK4A), cyclin D1, NM23-H1, NM23-H2, c-MET, KGF, KGFR, and STAT 1 was increased in malignant samples. Several genes associated with antiapoptosis, such as bcl-2 like protein, cell structuring and/or cell attachment were also upregulated in tumoral cells. Conversely, decreased gene expression was observed for members of the transforming growth factor receptor superfamily (TGF-beta), interleukin 1 (IL-1), insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) and for members of the integrin family. Conclusions We identified a mRNA and protein expression pattern that might have an important role in the pathogenesis of invasive cervical carcinoma and appears to be specific for malignant cervical epithelium. We hypothesize that the presence of a cancer-specific gene-expression signature assessed by cDNA array analysis or immunohistochemical techniques could eventually turn out to become an additional tool to evaluate the dignity of routinely obtained cervical swabs.",

Borderline ovarian serous tumors (BSOT) affect women of childbearig age and their prognosis is outstanding. The aims of this study were to characterize the group of patients with BSOT and evaluate the significance of various molecular markers expression versus serous papillary ovarian carcinomas (SPOC) Material and methods We analyzed a total of 102 cases including: 64 cystadenoma, 10 borderline and 28 cystadenocarcinoma. For the BSOT the median age was 40 years. Eight women with BSOT underwent radical surgery and two fertility sparing surgery. The recurrence of disease appeared in one case with fertility sparing surgery. All the cases were analyzed on haematoxilin-eosin stained and immunohistochemistry (the indirect tristadial Streptavidin-Biotin method) for estrogen receptor (ER), progesteron receptor (PR), p53 protein (p53), proliferative activity (Ki67) and carcinoembrionic antigen (CEA). Results The immunostaining demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of ER (90%) and a decrease for p53 (10%) and Ki67 (6%) in BSOT vs SPOC (ER-60%, p53-50% and Ki67-40%). Conclusions The main differences between BSOT and SPOC was regarding the expression of p53 and Ki67. There was no significant correlation between Ki67 and the known histologic parameters of prognostic significance. Transvaginal ultrasound and CA 125 serum levels are the most effective diagnostic techniques for the follow up of patients treated conservatively for BSOT.",

The aim of this study was to review biopsy examinations of the tumours, stage, treatment strategy, follow up and outcome of five girls with gonadoblastoma and germ cell tumours. Material and methods Retrospective review of 5 patients with gonadoblastoma and germ cell tumours was performed. The patients were 13,14, 14, 15 and 17 years old. The first 14-year-old girl (karyotype, 46 XX, normal ovary bilateral) with gonadoblastoma, dysgerminoma and choriocarcinoma had IIIc stage disease. She was treated by chemotherapy with cisplatinum and radiotherapy. Four patients had gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma. The second 14-year-old girl (mixed gonadal dysgenesis, karyotype, 46, XY) had stage Ib and was treated by chemotherapy with cisplatinum. Two patients were treated with surgery only: 17year-old girl (streak gonads, karyotype, 46, XY) -stage Ib and 15year-old girl (karyotype 46, XX, der 22/ 45, XX, -22) -stage Ia. The 13-year-old patient (karyotype, 46, XX, normal ovary bilateral) -stage Ia disease, had adnexotomy only, but because of recurrence (stage IIIc) 13 months after the original diagnosis, she was treated by chemotherapy. Results Our review confirmed the original diagnosis of gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma and in one case gonadoblastoma, dysgerminoma and choriocarcinoma. All patients were followed up for 42 to 170 months. Only one patient, who was initially treated with surgery only (stage Ia), had disease recurrence, but achieved durable remission with chemotherapy and further surgery. The latest examinations revealed that all patients were in good health. Conclusions Because the gonads are often replaced by a tumour, a diagnosis of the underlying abnormality may be impossible. Gonadoblastoma is regarded as in situ malignancy, and there is a high possibility for development of invasive germ cell tumour such as dysgerminoma. Young girls with unilateral encapsulated gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma can be treated only by unilateral oophorectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy and subsequent careful follow up to prevent damage of contralateral ovary and preserve the fertility. The patients with gonadoblastoma and mixed germ cell tumor are treated in accordance with other tumour structures.

Material and method Immunohistochemical method was used in formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded representative tissue sections of 25 L-SIL (CIN I), 25 H-SIL (CIN II-III) and 30 invasive squamous cell carcinomas. The presence of immunostaining and the pattern of distribution of E-cadherin, P-cadherin, \u03b1-catenin and \u03b2-catenin were analyzed. Results E-cadherin was detected in 91.7 %, 41.7 %, 6.9 % of L-SIL, H-SIL and invasive squamous cell carcinomas respectively. The difference was statistically significant (p=0.0001). The expression of P-cadherin and \u03b1-catenin was reduced significantly from L-SIL through invasive carcinoma (p=0.009 for P-cadherin, p= 0.0001 for \u03b1-catenin). \u03b2-catenin expression was revealed in all lesions with nearly the same frequency, 75.9 % L-SIL, 83.3 % H-SIL and 79.2 % invasive carcinomas. Conclusion Loss of adhesion proteins, E-cadherin, P-cadherin and \u03b1-catenin is observed in cervical squamous cell carcinoma progression.

Beta catenin is also involved in Wnt signaling cascade which regulates cell proliferation. We investigated the altered pattern of cadherin/catenin complex in cervical squamous cell carcinomas. We also tried to find out if there was a correlation between adhesion proteins and clinicopathologic variables (stage, depth of invasion, lymph node metastases) and HPV status. Material and methods E-cadherin, P-cadherin, alpha catenin and beta catenin expression in 15 squamous cell carcinomas were investigated by immunohistochemical method. The presence of HPV 16/18 infection was detected by in situ hybridization. Results There were 11 large cell keratinizing, 3 nonkeratinizing and 1 small cell subtypes of squamous cell carcinoma. Lymph node metastases were found in 6 carcinomas. HPV 16/18 infection was detected in 8 of 15 carcinomas, all were large cell keratinizing except one. No correlation was found between the HPV status and cadherin and catenin expression of the tumors. E-cadherin was negative in 12 carcinomas, P-cadherin was positive in only 4 carcinomas. Strong cytoplasmic beta catenin positivity was revealed in 11 carcinomas. Alpha catenin reactivity was seen in 5 of 15 carcinomas. Neither cadherins nor catenins expressions were correlated with other clinicopathologic variables. Conclusion Our results reveal that E-cadherin and P-cadherin expressions are lost in squamous cell carcinomas. However alpha and beta catenin immunopositivity in cervical squamous cell carcinomas might suggest catenins' role in tumor progression in a different way other than their activity in cell adhesion.",

Our experience in Ljubljana is based on the management of 400 stage IA squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), accumulated in the past 30 years and 33 early invasive adenocarcinomas (AC) collected in 5 years. Results In the reported 4.311 SCC MIC cases, lymphatic space involvement was recorded in 342 (8%) cases, and in 53 of those, the disease recurred, and progressed to death in 15 patients. In 14 series, MICs were associated with 72 (1.7%) recurrences. In seven series, 20 (0.5%) cases of death due to cancer were reported. Lymph node metastases were found in 30 (0.7%) cases. Even when stage IA1 and IA2 carcinomas were treated with conservative surgical approach, very low risk of recurrence (1.7%), lymph node disease (0.7%), or death caused by cancer (0.5%) was reported by these studies. Most authors conclude that MIC with the depth of invasion <3 mm, without confluent growth or lymphatic invasion can be safely treated with conization. During 1966-1972 lymphadenectomy was included in 290 operations of MIC in Ljubljana. The pelvic LNs were invariably free of cancer. The 5-year survival was 97%, while 6 patients were lost to follow-up. In Medline search 1.170 cases of stage IA ACs were analysed in a 35-year period. Lymph node metastasis were found in 15 (1.3%) of 531 cases with lymphadenectomy, complicated with recurrent disease in 11 (2.1%) cases Compared to the SCC MIC, the risk of recurrence in AC was considerably higher, 3.4% and progression to death 1.4% (436 cases analysed by \u00d6st\u00f6r, 2000). In our 33 AC patients diagnosed in stage IA there was no recurrence or death of disease. Conclusions According to the world literature and our own experience, the prognosis of MIC of both squamous and glandular type is very favourable. This suggests that conservative management of stage IA cervical cancer is indicated and safe when strict evaluation of tumour extension and surgical margins of the cone are assured.",

Further we examined the expression of gelsolin in human benign and malignant ovarian tissues by immunohistochemistry, observing a diminished expression of gelsolin in borderline tumors and ovarian serous carcinomas compared to epithelium of normal ovaries and benign adenomas. In addition, low levels of gelsolin protein were observed in four of six ovarian carcinoma cell lines in contrast to immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells. Re-expression of gelsolin in the ovarian carcinoma cell lines OAW42 and ES-2 resulted in a suppression of tumor cell survival in vitro. Finally, we showed an up-regulation of gelsolin in ovarian cancer cell lines after inhibition of both DNA methylation and histone deacetylation using 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine and Trichostatin A, respectively. Conclusion Our results suggest that the gelsolin gene has a potential function as a class II tumor suppressor gene in human ovarian epithelium.",

Steroid cell tumors, previously classified as lipid or lipoid cell tumors are rare neoplasms of sex-cord-stromal origin derived in almost all cases from ovarian stromal lutein cells or from Leydig cells and rarely from adrenal rest cells. They have been subclassified as steroid cell tumors not otherwise specified (NOS), stromal luteomas and Leydig cell tumors. In our report we present two cases of the NOS subtype: one occurred in a 24-yearold woman and the other in a 72-year-old postmenopausal woman. Both patients presented with a pelvic mass and signs of virilization (resulting effect of elevated serum testosterone). Both tumors were composed of characteristic eosinophilic-granular or vacuolated (lipid rich) neoplastic cells lacking crystals of Reinke and expressing the appropriate immunohistochemical phenotype. Based on thorough pathological examination and evaluation of several findings such as tumor size, necrosis, haemorrhage, cellular atypia, mitotic activity, we classified the first case as a malignant and the second as a benign one. Various aspects of the clinical and pathological presentation, differential diagnosis and treatment of these tumors are discussed.",

The aim of this study was to stress the importance of a correct and rapid diagnosis which will allow a high rate of success in therapy for this neoplasm. Material and methods Histopathologic and immunohistochemical studies were performed to an endometrial curettage and a hysterectomy specimen. Case report A 33-year-old female presented with uterine bleeding three months after a normal delivery from a term gestation in which placenta was not submitted for study. Endometrial curettage was performed, and it showed a dimorphic population of atypical cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells. Cytotrophoblast cells had pale cytoplasm with single nucleus, eosinophilic nucleoli and prominent mitotic figures. Syncytiotrophoblast appeared as large multinucleated cells with polygonal basophilic cytoplasm. Extensive necrotic and hemorrhagic areas were found. There was no presence of placental villi. Neoplastic cells expressed strongly \u00df-hCG and cytokeratin. With a diagnosis of choriocarcinoma, hysterectomy was performed and showed areas of normal proliferative endometrium, and hemorrhagic areas with nests of trophoblastic neoplastic cells infiltrating among myometrial muscle. There was no involvement of cervix or adnexa. Treatment was completed with chemotherapy, and one year after diagnosis the patient has not evidence of disease. Conclusions The modern treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs is highly effective in complete cure of choriocarcinoma. Therefore a quick histological diagnosis has a very important role to reduce the risk of metastasis disease, even avoiding surgery to preserve reproductive function.",

At the same time, incidence of squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix decreased, due to early detection of their well documented precursors lesions. The aim of this study was to determine if dysplastic endocervical cells (EC) have neoplastic potential as a precursor lesions of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) of the cervix. The malignant potential was determined by assessing the ploidy status, proliferative activity and c-myc expression in normal, dysplastic and malignant EC separately. Patients and methods Serial sections from 49 patients with diagnosed AIS or primary invasive ACA were analyzed. One representative slide of cervix which showed normal, dysplastic and malignant endocervical glands simultaneously was chosen from each patient. Determination of ploidy status and S-phase by flow cytometry and expression of c-myc oncoprotein by immunohistochemistry in normal, dysplastic and malignant EC was done. Results The morphologicaly normal EC were diploid, with normal proliferative activity and no expression of c-myc oncoprotein. The dysplastic and malignant EC had a significant proportion of cells with aneuploidy, higher proliferative activity and c-myc oncogene overexpression. The \u03c7 2 test showed significant association of malignant EC with aneuploidy (p=0.008) and high proliferative activity (p=0.042). As one third of dysplastic EC are aneuploid, with high mitotic activity, they probably have malignant potential. Dysplastic endocervical cells had statistically significant association with c-myc oncogene expression (p=0.028).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the patterns of c-erbB-2 OPE in early stage cervical carcinoma and to assess its prognostic value by exploring its relationships to various clinicopathological characteristics, HPV status and recurrence rate. Materials and methods Radical hysterectomy specimens from 71 cervical carcinoma patients (pT1b1/1b2) were investigated immunohistochemically for c-erbB-2 presence. The c-erbB-2 score (range: 0-400) was determined in the surface area, center and invasion front of each carcinoma. CARD in situ hybridization was used for HPV detection. Results and conclusion Strong c-erbB-2 OPE was detected in 21, 20, and 32 cases in the invasion front, center and surface area of the tumor, respectively. There was a significant difference in positive staining rate of c-erbB-2 between squamous cell, mixed carcinomas and adenocarcinomas (23%, 50% vs 83%, p=0.005). C-erbB-2 OPE was significantly higher in carcinomas with abundant than in tumors with less abundant peri-tumoral lymphocytic infiltration (36.5% vs 10.5%, p=0.032). In HPV positive carcinomas (41), c-erbB-2 was detected more frequently in type 31/33 versus type 16/18 lesions (75% vs 18.8%, p=0.002). No association was found between c-erbB-2 expression and recurrence rate, lymph node metastasis or any other clinicopathological variable investigated (age, tumor diameter, depth of invasion, grade, vascular invasion). Therefore, immunostaining for c-erbB-2 is unlikely to be of use as a prognostic indicator in early stage cervical carcinomas, while further study is warranted to examine relationships between HPV infection and c-erbB-2 OPE.",

Overexpression of hsp70 protects cells from stress-induced apoptosis. The aim of this study was to determine the distrubition pattern of hsp70-expression in ovarian carcinomas by immunohistochemistry and to evaluate its relationship with the prognostic parameters and over-expression of bcl-2 and p53 proteins. Materials and methods Thirty-five patients with ovarian carcinoma were included in the present study. Expression of hsp70 was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between expression of these proteins and other prognostic markers such as stage was evaluated. Results Hsp70 was expressed in all of ovarian cancer cells with different intensity. The staining was localized in the cytoplasm and/or nuclei. There was a negative correlation between stage and both intensity of hsp70 positivity and bcl-2 positivity (respectively: r= -0,478; p<0.01; r= -0.386, p<0.05). Intensity of hsp70 positivity was statistically associated with bcl-2 positivity (r=0.435, p<0.01). There were no significant associations between p53 positivity and bcl-2 positivity, intensity of hsp70 or stage of ovarian carcinoma. Conclusions These data show that the intensity of hsp70 positivity was significantly stronger in early stage than in advanced stage ovarian carcinomas. Hsp70 expression detected by immunohistochemistry was correlated with bcl-2 expression but not with p53 protein expression. Background avb3 integrin and pinopodes have been proposed as new markers of endometrial receptivity. There is also a very limited experience on the responses of these markers to hormonal therapies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect different hormone replacement treatment on these markers. Design We studied 12 fertile controls and 16 women with ovarian failure receiving hormone replacement therapy (estradiol valerate (EV) and vaginal progesterone (VP), group E+EP). Those women were divided randomly into two subgroups of 8 patients. Group E+P received EV for 14 days and VP alone for 14 days. Group E+P+EP was given E+EP therapy but including episodic VP on days 8 and 11. All women underwent two endometrial biopsies during a single menstrual cycle (days +7 to +8 and four days later). avb3 integrin was detected in frozen tissue using the EnVision system. Pinopode formation was evaluated in tissue fixed in glutaraldehide using a Zeiss DSM940A scanning electron microscopy. Both avb3 integrin and pinopode formation were semiquantitatively evaluated. Results Patients in group E+P+EP showed markedly decidualized endometria in the midluteal biopsy and a significant increase of avb3 integrin expression (p=0.01 for both parameters). No significant changes in pinopode formation were observed in midluteal biopsies. No differences were observed in late luteal biopsies. Conclusions avb3 integrin expression and pinopode formation are signs of endometrial maturation related to progesterone action but their significance in terms of endometrial receptivity in the clinical setting remains to be shown.

The first patient, age 29 underwent salpingectomy for clinical suspicion of tubal pregnancy, whereas in the second, age 49 hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophprectomy (HSOP) was performed for a clinical diagnosis of ovarian endometriosis. The third patient, age 42 underwent HSOP for malignant ovarian tumour which metastasised to lungs. Pathological findings: Chorionic villi were found in the tubal lumen of the first patient, showing marked hydropic degeneration, reduced/absent vascularisation and excessive trophoblastic cell growth. Diagnosis of partial hydatiform mole was established, and the patient remained under surveillance for the HCG level. Atypical trophoblastic cells, which penetrated the full thickness of the tubal wall and invaded the ovarian blood vessels of the second patient, led to the diagnosis of an invasive mole. The third patient was diagnosed with choriocarcinoma due to the presence of a tumour consisting of malignant trophoblastic cells that infiltrated the right ovary, tube and uterine cornu. The last two patients received chemotherapy and have been well for 15 and 118 months, respectively.

Aims: A unilateral ovarian stage Ic SLCT with heterologous mesenchymal elements is presented. Materials and methods A 29-year-old woman, para 1, was admitted to hospital with severe abdominal pain. At laparotomy, resection of a large right ovarian cyst was carried out. Histological examination revealed a SLCT, and subsequently surgical staging was performed. No adjuvant therapy was given. At 2 years followup she was well and without signs of recurrence. Routine staining of slides from 34 paraffin blocks and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were available. Results Gross examination revealed a 18 x 14 x 11 cm large multilocular ovarian cyst with smooth interlocular septa and outer surface. Microscopy disclosed a SLCT of intermediate differentiation with a very few Leydig cells. Major areas consisted of a hypocellular stroma with edema, hemorrhage and necrosis. In a few sections small foci of cartilage were seen. In a number of sections groups of small cells with indistinct cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei were present. Mitotic and apoptotic figures were common. IHC revealed a positive reaction for desmin, myf4 and myogenin, indicating rhabdomyosarcoma of embryonal type. Conclusion The most important prognostic factors of SLCT are stage and grade of differentiation. Variants of SLCT with immature skeletal muscle are often fatal. IHC with myf4 or myogenin with a high sensitivity and specificity for rhabdomyosarcoma, combined with inhibin is very important in differing immature Sertoli cells from rhabdomyoblasts, in order to diagnose the rhabdomyosarcoma and to grade the SLCT correctly.",

However, recent studies have additionally highlighted the role of NGF and its receptors TrkA (inducer of proliferation) and p75 (inducer of apoptosis) in the development and progression of malignant tumors, including those of non-neural origin. We studied protein expression of p75 and activated phosphorylated TrkA (p-TrkA) in 145 serous ovarian carcinomas (80 effusions, 65 solid tumors), 107 breast carcinomas (42 effusions, 65 solid tumors) and 81 malignant mesotheliomas (MM) (24 effusions, 57 biopsies) using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. p-TrkA was expressed in ovarian carcinoma cells in effusions in only 15/80 (19%) specimens, compared to 52/65 (80%) solid tumors, while the opposite was true for p75. In contrast, p-TrkA membrane expression was higher in effusions (p=0.058) of MM patients, while the opposite was true for p75 (p=0.008). In addition, p-TrkA (but not p75) expression was significantly higher in peritoneal MM compared to their pleural counterparts (20/20 vs. 46/61 positive tumors; p=0.014).

Material and method Twenty-cases of ordinary leiomyoma, 6 cases of atypical leiomyoma, 6 cases of leiomyosarcoma, 8 cases of mitotically active leiomyoma and 38 cases of cellular leiomyoma were included in the study. The morphological features and clinical presentation was evaluated retrospectively. Toludine Blue stain was used to highlight the mast cells in the endometrium, myometrium and smooth muscle tumors. At least 40 high power fields were counted. Results Considerable variation in mast cell numbers was found among smooth muscle tumors (p<0.01). The intratumoral mean mast cell count was found significantly higher in ordinary leiomyomas (82.7 14), when compared with other tumors, including atypical leiomyoma (68.4 18.4), mitotically active leiomyoma (45 10.3), cellular leiomyoma (34.2 5.9) and leiomyosarcoma (23.8 8.3) (p<0.01). No significant differences were found between these tumor groups in regards of the mean mast cell count of endometrium and myometrium adjacent to the tumor. In the endometrium, a drop in the number of mast cells has been demonstrated with advancing age, particularly after menopause (p<0.05). In addition 2 cases showed eosinophilia, 4 cases showed basophilia and 5 cases showed allergic reactions to different causes. A significant positive relationship was found between the intratumoral, myometrial mast cell number and basophilia. Conclusion These data suggest that intratumoral mast cell quantitation may allow the differential diagnosis in uterine smooth muscle tumors. Ovarian carcinoma is the most frequent cause of death in the world among gynaecologic malignancies. Diagnosis is usually late, and the biological behaviour is highly variable, depending on several factors such as the histopathological grading, the local and/or peritoneal spread and the proliferation rate. We choose a list of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation (IGF2, IGFBP3, CTNNBETA1, CDK-1C, FGFR4). Among these, so far, we analyzed IGFBP3 gene and studied loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumour tissue in order to identify potential relevant genes in ovarian cancer homeostasis. Twenty cases of formalin fixed, paraffin embedded ovarian carcinomas from the archives of the Department of Pathology of Padova University and five effusions (from peritoneal or pleural recurrences) of ovarian carcinomas, were selected for this study. Genomic DNA and tumour DNA for each case were extracted from blood cell, tumour or not-cancer surgery biopsy. LOH was searched using 2 published single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in IGFBP3 gene. PCR product covering the SNPs from genomic and tumour DNA were DHPLC separated. Three of the twenty patients whose tumour DNA was obtained from paraffin material, were heterozygous at nucleotide 323 C/A (dbSNP ref. n. 2132570) and 1704 A/C (dbSNP ref. n. 2854744) of the IGFBP3 gene in genomic DNA. Analysis of tumour DNA failed to reveal LOH (preserved heterozygosity). In effusion cases, one of five patients showed heterozygosity at the same nucleotides. In these patients, LOH was also not identified. Our preliminary results suggest that DHPLC analysis for LOH is feasible, rapid and maybe of potential interest in the identification of genes involved in ovarian cancerogenesis.",

There are no morphologic changes to predict this progression. Aims: To study whether the Ki 67 immunostaining pattern and labeling present upon diagnosis of L-SIL is able to predict the regression or persistence/progression of the lesion to H-SIL of the cervix over a two year period following diagnosis. Materials and methods 113 cervical biopsies from 113 patients diagnosed cytologically as cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) were used. Biopsies were performed immediately after the cytological diagnosis resulting in 89 L-SIL and 24 H-SIL. Ki 67 immunostaining was performed on all cases and was classified as suprabasal immunostaining pattern (SBIP) for cases without Ki-67 immunoreactive cells in the upper two thirds of the epithelium thickness, or dispersed immunostaining pattern (DIP) for cases with Ki-67 immunoreactive cells in the upper two thirds of the epithelium thickness. 200 nuclei in 25 HPF including the total thickness of the epithelial layer of each sample were counted to determine the mean number of cells which reacted against Ki-67 antibody. In situ hybridization was used to demonstrate the presence of HPV and its typing. Chi Square Test, Fisher's Exact Test and Student T Test were used for statistical analysis with significance set at p<0.05. Results Of the 113 biopsies performed 89 cases resulted in L-SIL (54 S-BIP and 34 DIP patterns) and 24 in H-SIL. 14% of the L-SIL cases that resulted in a S-BIP pattern showed persistence/ progression of the lesions while 65% of the cases that resulted in a DIP pattern showed persistence/progression of the lesions. The difference between these values where statistically significative (p<0.001). Regarding Ki-67 labeling index (LI) in L-SIL cases, we found that 25% of the cases (15 out of 58) with a Ki-67 LI less than 28% persisted/progressed, while 51% of cases (16 out of 31) with Ki-67 LI over 28% persisted/progressed. In this case there was also a statistically significative difference (p=0.015). We found no statistical differences (p=0.64) regarding HPV \"in situ\" hybridization. 48% of the cases (14 out of 29) where HPV was detected by in situ hybridization persisted/progressed while 28% of the cases did not show HPV by hybridization. Conclusions The L-SIL cases which showed DIP and high Ki-67 LI were significantly related with persistence or progression to H-SIL of these lesions, while L-SIL cases which showed SBIP and low Ki-67 were significantly related to regression of the lesions. Therefore, we conclude that Ki-67 immunostaining pattern may be of prognostic value to predict regression or persistence/progression of L-SIL.",

It was first described by Chalvardjan and Scully in 1973 as a distinct subtype in the thecoma-fibroma group. Most SSTs occur in young patients below the age of 30 years. The most common clinical symptom in patients is menstrual irregularity. In differential diagnosis, thecoma, fibroma, and hemangiopericytoma must be considered. Aim: In this report, 2 cases of SST of the ovary were described and compared with other ovarian tumors. Material and methods Two cases of ovarian SST were examined. The first case occurred in a 28-year-old female. At operation, the patient was found to have the ovary replaced by a tumor mass measuring 5x4x2 cm. The second case occurred in a 24-year-old woman and the tumor mass measured 9x5x5 cm. The surgical material was fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution and prepared for paraffin sections. In addition to H&E staining, immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Results The clinical features, gross features, light microscopic findings and immunohistochemical results were described and compared with literature. The findings were consistent with SST, which is a very rare tumor of the ovary. The tumor cells showed positive staining for vimentin and desmin. We discuss the results and differential diagnosis.",

It is not clear whether CA are hyperplasias, hamartomas, or true neoplasms. Depending on their size and location, they may be devoid of symptoms or may cause difficulties for the infant and the mother. We describe a case of manual removal of the placenta in association with CA. On gross examination the tumor had a nodule-in-nodule appearance and was histologically composed of two well defined nodules. The larger, outer one had the appearance of an usual chorangioma; the inner nodule showed highly cellular vascular proliferation. This architecture might represent a morphological variant of the same disease. In the present case, the placenta had to be removed manually. It remains unclear if this was due to impaired contractility of the uterine wall or due to a lack of decidualisation, following a worse vascular support in the surrounding area of the CA. It can\u00b4t be excluded that placenta accreta was caused by strictures after Cesarian section which had been performed at the first delivery two years ago. On the other hand a placenta with a nodule form of CA could be less elastic than a placenta with regular architecture. However manual removal of the placenta may be regarded as a further complication of CA's larger than 4 cm in diameter.",

However, there is limited information regarding the expression of these mucin proteins in primary and metastatic ovarian carcinomas. The aim of this study was to examine immunohistochemical expression of MUC 2 and MUC 5AC mucin proteins in primary and metastatic carcinomas of the ovary in order to assess their value in the differential diagnosis. Materials and methods Forty eight ovarian tumours comprising 37 surface epithelial carcinomas (8 endometrioid, 5 clear cell, 11 serous papillary and 13 mucinous type) and 11 metastatic carcinomas of gastrointestinal primaries were included in the study. The age of the patients, the histological type and grade of the tumours were evaluated in relation to the expression (percentage distribution and staining intensity) of MUC 2 and MUC 5AC studied immunohistochemically. Results MUC 2 was expressed in 28 (75.7%) primary ovarian tumours while MUC 5AC was expressed in 27 (73%) primary tumours in comparison to 100% expression of MUC 2 and 82.3% expression of MUC 5AC in metastatic ovarian tumours. The differences in MUC 2 expression between non-mucinous (46.04 \u00b1 38.11) and metastatic tumours (56.36 \u00b1 41.72) and metastatic and mucinous tumours (28.46 \u00b1 39.97) were statistically significant (p< 0.01). The difference in MUC 5AC expression was statistically significant (p< 0.05) between non-mucinous (27.92 \u00b1 33.49) and mucinous tumours (51.54 \u00b1 38.91).

Whereas histology and immunohistochemistry of this tumour are well documented, little is known about molecular mechanisms involved. To characterize ESS-altered genes, we generated a genome-wide library by SSH-hybridisation and used it to produce cDNA arrays. Particular emphasis was also placed on data obtained from QRT-PCR analyses. Materials and methods Using SSH-library a gene-bank with app. 4000 different clones was established. Total RNA was extracted from frozen tumour tissue and used for cDNA hybridisation. QRT-PCR analyses were performed both on frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Results After cDNA-array analysis more than 300 genes were selected, sequenced and rearranged to different functional groups. Among the most strongly deregulated genes were secreted frizzledrelated protein-1 (sFRP1) and sFRP4. These are putative genes that regulate wnt-signalling pathway and can influence different cell events including cell proliferation. Compared to post-menopausal endometrium the expression of sFRP1 and sFRP4 was increased in low-grade ESS, but decreased in aggressive ESS form. These results were additionally verified on paraffin embedded tissue probes by QRT-PCR analysis. Conclusion Deregulation of sFRP1 and sFRP4 expression appears to be one of the crucial features of ESS. Whereas in low-grade ESS these two genes are up-regulated, their down-regulation could be associated with high-grade form of ESS. Therefore a sFRP1 and sFRP4 may not only represent useful markers for early ESS diagnosis but may also have prognostic impact and help to distinguish between low-and high-grade ESS.

In mammals so far studied ER-\u03b2 predominates in the ovary. High expression of ER-\u03b2 was observed by in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry in granulosa cells of the ovarian follicles. The aim of the present study was to examine immunohistochemically the expression of ER-\u03b2 in ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors. Materials and methods Ten cases of ovarian granulosa-stromal cell tumors (five adult granulosa cell tumors, two juvenile granulosa cell tumors, and 3 sclerosing stromal tumors) and two cases of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor were immunostained for ER-\u03b2 (polyclonal ERb88, Biogenex). Representative sections from ten cases of ovarian carcinomas were immunostained for comparison. Results Positivity for ER-\u03b2 was observed in 50% to 80% of the nuclei in adult granulosa cell tumors and 40% to 75% of the nuclei in sclerosing stromal tumors. Only 10-15% of the nuclei from juvenile granulosa cell tumors were positive for ER-\u03b2. In Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors positivity was more extensive in areas of diffuse growth. Four cases of ovarian carcinomas exhibited positivity. Conclusion Positivity for ER-\u03b2 is a common finding in ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors.

Materials and methods 59 cases of mucinous tumour of the ovary, including 28 benign cystadenomas, 15 borderline mucinous tumours and 16 mucinous adenocarcinomas, were tested for CDX2 immunoreactivity. 25 cases of serous and endometrioid lesions as well as 5 cases of ovarian metastases from colonic adenocarcinoma were also evaluated. Results CDX2 immunoreactivity was detected in 45/59 (76%) cases of primary ovarian mucinous tumour.

An impaired checkpoint has been linked to genomic instability, and, in higher eukaryots has been associated to risk of cancer. The genes to be studied are involved in the mitotic checkpoint and DNA damage checkpoint (like p53, the tumour supressor gene frecuently mutated in human cancers). These proteins are also involved in the checkpoint responding to incomplete DNA replication (replication checkpoint) termed the Rad/Hus group of proteins. Failure of this checkpoint progress can result in genomic instability, and, in higher eukaryotes may lead to tumorigenesis or certain degenerative disease states. Material and methods We have obtained antisera against recombinant hHus1 and hRad9. For this we will clone and overexpress in bacteria and immunize animals to obtain antisera. We will carry out extensive analysis of the expression levels of several proteins by Western blot analysis. We looked for possibles associations among Hus-1 and Rad-9 immunohistochemical expression and prognosis in ovarian carcinomas prior to chemotherapy. We studied, in addition to the levels of expression of the mentioned proteins, the localization and modifications of these proteins in 130 epithelial ovarian tumours (benign, borderline and carcinomas) in order to establish the probable relationship between these proteins and ovarian carcinogenesis. Results Increased levels of checkpoint hus-1 protein was related to malignant transformation across all types of ovarian carcinomas (p<0,05). Similar results were observed with the expression of rad-9 protein, however was not statistically significant (p>0,05). In univariate survival analysis, the expression of hus-1 and rad-9 protein were not significantly correlated with shorter survival and shorter free period of illness (p>0,05). There were positive correlation between the apoptotic index, p53 and bax and the expression of checkpoint protein hus-1 (p<0,05), but none relation was detected with rad-9 expression (p>0,05). Conclusions 1-The expression of hus-1 is higher in ovarian carcinomas and low in benign and borderline tumours. 2-The expression of hus-1 shows a positive correlation with the apoptotic index and with the pro-apoptotic factors (p53 and bax). 3-There was not statistical significant differences in the expression of Hus-1 and Rad-9 among the different histological types of ovarian tumours. 4-There was a positive correlation between the expression of Hus-1 protein with other prognostic factors such as the FIGO stages, and the histological grade.",

After use of orthopaedic implants, particles produced by wear are commonly recognizable and identifiable in tissue by the surgical pathologist. Foreign body related tissue re actions may contribute to aseptic loosening of implants, which is regarded as one of the most significant complications in orthopaedic surgery. In the present study we report on very uncommon particles in periprosthetic tissue after aseptic loosening of metallic implants. Our study was performed to identify particles in periprosthetic tissue and to clarify whether they may contribute to the loss of implants. Materials and methods Periprosthetic tissue including joint capsule, acetabular and femoral interface membranes of 62 cases of aseptic loosened cementless total hip replacements was histologically investigated. Four cases with present uncommon particles were selected for electron microscope investigation and dispersive x-ray analysis. Results In four cases the histological investigation revealed uncommon green to yellow coloured foreign bodies. By the use of electron scanning microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis, these particles were identified as deposits rich in chromium, phosphorus and oxygen. This detection indicates the presence of solid corrosion products derived from implant surfaces. Conclusion Particles produced by wear and/or corrosion are associated with an alteration of the environment and the development of periprosthetic osteolysis which may result into the loss of the implant. The surgical pathologist should be aware that corrosion products may occur. Their identification is helpful to determine implant failures.",

Material and methods We have studied a paratesticular lipoleiomyosarcoma in a man 63 years old. Gross examination revealed 4 tumor nodules dispersed between identifiable testis and epididymis, the largest of which measured 13x7x4 cm. The specimen cut surface revealed smooth yellow tissue with distinct areas of gray myxomatous change. Microscopically the specimen consisted of a well differentiated lipoma-like, sclerosing liposarcoma with mature adipocytes and fibrous septa containing spindled and floret-like cells. The smooth muscle accounted for about 40% of the total tumor mass and consisted of fascicles and bundles of spindle cells with very little atypia or pleomorphism. Mitotic activity was moderate at most and focal in distribution. The cells colored well with immunohistochemical stain against SMA. Results and conclusions An extraordinary rare combination-type tumor is presented. Only two previous examples of paratesticular lipoleiomyosarcoma have been published. The nature of combination-type tumors and dedifferentiated liposarcoma is addressed. The existence of two lines of tissue differentiation in the same tumor suggests the possibility of two separate tumors arising together or two lines of differentiation appearing from one pluripotent precursor cell. The differential diagnosis includes angiomyolipoma, which should be HMB45 positive.",

They are more common in female. Possibly estrogen and progesterone influence on tumours growth. We investigated the expression of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in renal angiomyolipomas. Materials and methods 28 renal angiomyolipomas from 24 patients were tested. The expression of ER and PR was studied immunohistochemically. The expression of HMB-45, alpha-smoothmuscle actin and vimentin was also studied in all cases. Results Most angiomyolipomas were of classic morphology with one exception. In that case, classical angiomyolipoma was combined with cystic hamartomatous lesions and involvement of regional lymph nodes. The vast majority of cells in the cases with typical morphology expressed alpha-smooth-muscle actin. Expression of HMB-45 was diffuse or focal. In the case with cystic hamartomatous lesions, an inverse correlation of expression of HMB-45 and alpha-smooth-muscle actin was observed in both renal and extrarenal components. Of the 28 tumours, two tumours were only ER positive and three tumours were ER and PR positive. In four cases, focal immunoreactivity for ER was mainly observed in the spindle shaped cells. In two cases, the immunoreactivity for PR was diffuse, but less than 5 percent of cells were positive. ER and PR positivity was diffuse, strong and widespread only in the case with cystic hamartomatous lesions. Conclusion To our knowledge, estrogen and progesterone are not critical players in all angiomyolipoma growth, but only in the specific cases.",

Recently, CD10, a cell surface metalloprotease, was shown to be present in myofibroblasts within the stroma of infiltrating cancers. To clarify the specificity of CD10 expression in myofibroblasts, we performed immunohistochemical studies on myofibroblastic and smooth muscle tumors. Methods and materials consisted of 25 myofibroblastic and 22 smooth muscle lesions, ranging from reactive to benign and malignant tumors. All myofibroblastic lesions arose in soft tissue and smooth muscle tumors in soft tissue and organs. Using paraffin sections, immunohistochemical staining for CD10 (clone: 56C6, Serotec) was carried out by an automated stainer (BENCHMARK, Ventana). Results Significant CD10-expression was demonstrated only in malignant or borderline lesions, including malignant fibrous histiocytoma (3 of 3 cases), low grade myofibroblastic sarcoma (4 of 7), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (3 of 3), and leiomyosarcoma (3 of 6). However, no positive reaction was seen in reactive lesions and benign tumors, such as scar (1 case), nodular fasciitis (4), su-perficial fibromatosis (3), desmoid (4), leiomyoma (7), vascular leiomyoma (3), angiomyolipoma (2), and glomus tumor (4) . Furthermore, the intensity of staining was almost parallel to the microscopic anaplasia. Conclusion The present study demonstrated that CD10 expression is not specific to myofibroblasts, but seems to be related to the biologic aggressiveness of myofibroblastic and smooth muscle tumors. Therefore, CD10 expression may be a potential predictor of malignancy in these tumors.",

Case report and literature review Introduction Ependymomas are glial tumors that on rare occasions occur in subcutaneous locations dorsal to the sacrum and coccyx. Case report A 35-year-old woman presented with a soft tissues tumor in the intergluteal region. MRI revealed a 7cm large mass, with solid and cystic areas, located below the coccyx, without bone alteration. Surgical excision was performed. Pathological features Grossly, the tumor was encapsulated and showed solid, spongy and myxoid areas with a peripheral hemorrhagic focus. Histologically it consisted of medium-sized cuboidalcolumnar cells, with round-oval nuclei, granular cromatin and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Tumor cells showed myxopapillary and cystic-papillary growth pattern or were arranged on fibrovascular stalks, with a central hyalinized wall vessel, surrounded by a single layer of cuboidal cells. Tumoral necrosis and hemorrhage were observed. The peritumoral stroma was highly hyalinized. The immunohistochemical stains showed vimentin(+), S-100(+), GFAP(+) and keratins(-). Discussion and conclusion Extraspinal ependymoma (EE) is a rare tumor usually localized subcutaneously in sacrococcygeal region of young adults; most are of myxopapillary type. EE may arise from normal remnants of the neural tube or from abnormal remnants resulting from embryologic malformations. EE has a greater propensity to metastasize than its intraspinal counterpart, because of easier accessibility to lymph channels. In a study of 32 cases, Elson found a metastases incidence of 20% and no clinical or histologic data was found to predict the biological behavior of the tumor. The differential diagnosis must be done with choroid plexus papilloma, myxoid chondrosarcoma, chordoma, meningioma, adenoid cystic carcinoma and paraganglioma.",

We compared the results of histologic evaluations performed according to modified Mirra's classification: semi quantitative assessment of neutrophils, mononuclear histiocytes, chronic inflammatory cells, giant-cells, metal particles, polymethacrylate globules, necrobiosis, bone chips, necrosis and necrotic debris. But, we also included the assessment of the intensity of hemosiderin deposition. Results Comparison of granulation tissues of short duration THP to that of 51-year duration revealed a surprising difference in the amount of hemosiderin particles with intensive intracellular hemosiderin deposition in mononuclear macrophages and giant cells in the first group. In the 51-year-old THP there was predominantly hypocellular tissue with very little amount of mononuclear macrophages containing slight amount of intracellular hemosiderin deposition and no multinucleated giant cells at all. Conclusions We don't know why hemosiderin deposition is more evident in early loosening of THP. Hemosiderin deposition may give rise to accumulation of macrophages, perhaps increasing the process of osteolysis and granulation tissue formation. But more 'aggressive' forms of loosening may also cause recurrent bleeding. Whether the higher level of hemosiderin is the cause or the result of the loosening of THP is to be determined.",

Its association with prognosis in bone sarcomas has been subject to less extensive research. The aim of our study was to investigate clinical significance of neoangiogenesis in osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Patients and methods A retrospective immunohistochemical study was performed. 39 patients with osteosarcoma and 27 patients with Ewing sarcoma were included. Sections from diagnostic biopsies were immunostained using factor VIII and CD 34 (DAKO) antibody and microvessels were counted at 400x magnification on three microscopic fields showing highest MVD per patient. MVD was correlated with overall and event-free survival by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analysis. The difference between the mean microvessel counts in patients with or without metastasis and alive or dead was assessed by Mann-Whitney test. Results In patients with osteosarcoma significant statistical difference was found as regards the death risk and risk of development of metastasis between patients with high (>31 vessels/field) and low (<31 vessels/field) microvessel counts (log-rank test p=0.0027 and p=0.0209, respectively). In patients with Ewing sarcoma a trend was noted for the patients with lower (<31.5 vessels/field) microvessel counts to have better outcomes than patients with higher vessel counts, however, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion These findings strongly suggest that neoangiogenesis quantified by microvessel density is predictive of metastasis and poor prognosis in osteosarcoma. Valorization of its role in patients with Ewing sarcoma awaits further studies.",

We present the histomorphological and immunohistochemical data of a hemangioma in a 20-year-old man who presented with an enlarging painful soft tissue mass of his right upper leg. Methods The complete local excision of tumor arising in the quadriceps muscle was done. Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue material were stained with HE, Van Gieson, PAS, PTAH, Gomori's reticulin and trichrome, and immunohistochemically for detection of factor VIII-related antigen. Results Grossly, the lesion (1x2,5 cm) was poorly circumscribed, reddish brown and partially haemorrhagic. Microscopically, it was composed both of small, capillary-sized and large, cavernous vessels lined by endothelial cells and surrounded by connective and mature adipose tissue. The adipocytic component wasn't prominent. Many cavernous spaces were separated by dense fibrous tissue and some of them were thrombosed. Foci of hemosiderin deposits and moderate lymphocytic infiltration were also noted. The small vessels in some areas hadn't discernible lumina so that areas appeared solid. Mitotic figures and intraluminal papillary tufting were not seen, but infiltration of skeletal muscle bundles and rarely perineural spaces were present. The muscle fibres showed atrophy, degenerative changes and signs of regeneration. The cells lining both cavernous and capillary-sized vessels showed expression of factor VIII-related antigen.

Material and methods A 56-year-old woman presented with a palpable tumor located in the supraclavicular region. The lesion was partially resected. Grossly, the tumor was firm, gray to whitish and slighty nodular. Standard histological procedure and inmunohistochemical study was performed. Results Microscopic examination revealed a solid proliferation of moderately large, rounded epithelioid cells, with pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli and atypical mitoses. In peripheral areas the tumor showed smaller cells with nuclei arranged in palisades and central necrosis. Immunohistochemical studies showed vimentine, S-100 protein, and cytokeratine positivity and HMB-45 negativity. The histopathology and the immunohistochemical results were consistent with MPNST, but a SSX2/SYT gene fusion was detected by molecular analysis, a characteristic chromosomal change of synovial sarcoma (SS). Conclusions Spindle cell tumors with epithelioid areas can be difficult to diferentiate by histologic pattern alone. Cytogenetic analysis and molecular studies may reveal the diagnosis by demonstrating a characteristic chromosomal abnormality or molecular rearrangement. SSX/SYT gene fusion results from the t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2). The translocation fuses the SYT gene from the chromosome 18 long arm to either of 2 highly homologous genes on the chromosome X short arm, SSX1 or SSX2. The translocation t(X;18) is currently regarded as a specific molecular marker of SS. Our case shows, that we might consider that SS may have a larger histologic spectrum than previously thought.",

Case report We describe a 46-year-old female patient who underwent a gynecologic operation for left ovarian cyst in October 2001. A periaortic mass alongside with peritoneal nodules were biopsied which revealed endometriosis, necrotic xantomatous nodules and Ormond's disease. The last diagnosis was rejected and tumor misinterpreted as malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The course of the disease progressed and on computed tomography a left renal supracapsular tumor measuring 20/10/8cm together with a diffuse retroperitoneal fibrosis was demonstrated. In November 2002, a tumor localized in the adipose capsule of the left kidney was removed together with the kidney weighing 7,5kg. The kidney was markedly atrophic. A parallel excision of ten retroperitoneal tissue masses with a size up to 10/6/4cm was performed. Our final histological diagnosis was highly differentiated liposarcoma. Four months later the abdominal CT and the tumor markers were normal. Conclusion The symptoms in our case were not specific for renoureteral obstruction and included abdominal pain and mass, weight loss and ascites during the year prior to second operation and finally urinary symptoms. We interpret our case as a slowly growing perirenal lipomatous tumor gradually compressing the kidney and causing slowly progressing retroperitoneal fibrosis.",

Background Chronic inflammation with remodelling of the airway wall structures is an essential characteristic in asthma patients. Lysosomal proteinases are involved in extracellular proteolysis, which leads to matrix changes of subepithelial connective tissue in the airway wall. The aim of the study was to localise the expression of different cysteine proteinases and their endogenous inhibitors in lung tissue of asthma patients. Material and methods We included ten specimens of bronchial biopsies of asthma patients and lung tissue specimens of fatal asthma case. Tissue specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. H&E slides were used for morphological examination. Immunohistochemistry was performed on an automated stainer (Benchmark, Ventana, Tuscon, AZ, USA). We used monoclonal antibodies to visualize cysteine proteinases (cathepsin B, H, L and S) and their inhibitors (stefin A and B, cystatin C) (Krka, Ljubljana, Slovenia). Results Cathepsin B showed the most intense and wide distributed positive reaction. It was localized in the respiratory epithelium, macrophages, lymphocytes, mucous glands and smooth muscle cells. Cathepsin H showed intense reaction localized in the respiratory epithelium, macrophages, lymphocytes, mucous glands, but not in the smooth muscle cells. Cathepsins L and S showed positive reaction only in macrophages. The positive reaction of all three inhibitors was weaker compared to cysteine proteinases; it was observed in the respiratory epithelium, macrophages and mucous glands. Conclusion These results suggest involvement of cysteine proteinases and their endogenous inhibitors in asthma, showing distinct immunoreactivity and different distributions in the lung tissue of asthma patients. Since the inhibitor expression is less intense we can speculate that remodelling of the extracellular matrix may be also a consequence of imbalance between cysteine proteinases and their inhibitors.",

Although aberrant Cx43 gene expression was linked with lung tumorigenesis, our understanding to the mechanism was still limited. We hypothesized that the evidence of aberrant Cx43 gene expression was gradually intensified from adjacent normal lung tissues surrounding tumors towards to tumor tissues. Materials and methods In this study, 90 lung tumors and adjacent normal tissues were collected to examine Cx43 mRNA expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results Our data showed that Cx43 mRNA expression in adjacent normal lung tissue was significantly correlated with nodal involvement (P = 0.03), but the similar trend was not observed in tumor tissues. To verify whether lack of Cx43 mRNA expression was resulted from promoter methylation, PCR-based methylation assay was performed for Cx43 promoter methylation analysis. High frequency of promoter methylation was observed in Cx43 mRNA negative patients (21 of 33, 63.7%) compared with Cx43 mRNA positive patients (3 of 57, 5.3%, P < 0.0001). To elucidate whether aberrant Cx43 gene expression is originated from adjacent normal lung tissues, 25 lung tumors and each of five adjacent normal tissues with various distances from tumor tissues were collected to examine Cx43 mRNA and protein expression by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. As the results shown, Cx43 mRNA and protein expressions were gradually decreased from adjacent normal lung tissues to tumor tissues with a positive correlation to the distance from tumor tissues. Gel shift assay data also revealed that shifted band binding with AP1 was only observed in adjacent normal tissues which were far from the tumor tissues. Conclusion These results indicate that promoter methylation may interfere with AP1 binding to promoter to cause aberrant Cx43 gene expression. Thus, Cx43 mRNA in adjacent normal tissue surrounding lung tumor simply detected by RT-PCR may be act as a molecular marker of nodal micrometastasis in NSCLC.",

Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) are the pre-invasive precursors of invasive adenocarcinoma, which frequently has a 'residual' peripheral BAC component. The biology of this neoplastic progression is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of the tumour suppressor gene FHIT, CD44v6, E-cadherin, beta-catenin, MMP-2, TIMP-2, and the cell cycle marker MCM2 at different stages in the proposed sequence. Materials and methods Sections from formalin-fixed, waxembedded tissue blocks of 118 AAH, 18 BAC and 133 invasive adenocarcinomas, stained immunohistochemically for the above molecules, were scored semiquantitatively. In invasive tumours, any BAC component was scored separately. For MCM2 a labelling index was determined as the ratio of immunopositive to total cells counted. Results Fhit protein is abundant until the disease becomes stromally invasive (P<0.0001). CD44v6 levels are high in AAH and BAC, but fall in invasive disease (P=0.007). E-cadherin and beta-catenin levels rise between AAH and BAC (P<0.001), and remain well expressed thereafter. MMP-2 and TIMP-2 expression is relatively low in AAH, rises in BAC but falls when tumour becomes stromally invasive (P <0.01). The BAC component of invasive tumours expresses some molecules in a manner similar to pure BAC but mirrors expression in invasive tumour for others. MCM2 counts increase from 0.87%(low grade AAH) to 65.5% in invasive adenocarcinoma (P=0.01 or less) Conclusion In peripheral adenocarcinogenesis, loss of Fhit is a relatively late event, while CD44v6 loss occurs earlier. Fhit loss has potential as a surrogate marker of invasion. E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression probably reflects changes in lesion architecture. MMP-2/TIMP-2 may be implicated in BAC but down-regulated as stromal invasion develops. Increasing cell cycle entry is consistent with neoplastic progression.",

MPM mortality continues to rise steeply (5% to 10% per year) with no known curative modality. Approximately 70% of MPMs have high levels of expression of EGFR. Two recent studies have reported expression of Her-2/neu in MPM but there was no analysis of overexpression or amplification. In this study, the amplification/overexpression of Her-2/neu gene has been evaluated in a series of 35 consecutive MPM biopsy specimens. Materials and methods The tumour specimens had been formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Her-2/neu overexpression was performed using the Dako HercepTest kit. Only membrane staining intensity and pattern were evaluated using a 0 to 3+ scale with 2+ being the lower limit for a positive test. Amplification of the Her-2/neu gene was tested with the fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) method (Ventana INFORM Her-2/neu Probe) in 10 out of the 35 cases. Cases were considered as amplified by FISH when the mean number of fluorescent signals per nucleus was greater than four. Results Of the 35 MPMs evaluated for the overexpression of the Her-2/neu receptor, all 35 scored 0 on the IHC test and all 10 cases additionally assayed by FISH were negative. Conclusions Although the sample size was limited, these findings suggest that MPM do not overexpress or amplify Her-2/neu, which therefore should not be considered a prognostic and predictive marker in MPM.

Overexpression of HER-2/neu has been observed in many human cancer, including lung cancer. There are different reports about the expression of this protein in different lung cancer. The aim of the study is to determine the expression of HER-2 protein in the spectrum of lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma). The study population consisted of two groups: 19 patients that have undergone to surgical treatment and 10 patients that have undergone to fiber-optic bronchoscopy and biopsy for primary diagnosis.Tissue specimens were neutral formaline fixed and paraffin embedded. Standard histochemical and immunohistochemical staining were used for diagnosis. Expression of Her-2/neu protein was determined by immunohistochemical staining with Hercep TestTM (DAKO). The results were graded 0-1 as negative and 2-3 as positive. Overall incidence of HER-2/neu overexpression was 34,4% (10 of 29). Higher incidence was found in patients with adenocarcinoma 45,4% (5of 11); squamous cell carcinoma 30,7% (4of 13) and small cell carcinoma 20% (1 of 5). No statistical significant difference was seen with age and gender. HER-2/neu overexpression was more relevant for patients with advanced tumor: all patients with squamous cell carcinoma were in stage 3b and 4, and 80% with adenocarcinoma were in stage 3a and 3b. These results are satisfactory and encourage us to continue this work in the follow-up study to evaluate HER-2/neu role as predictive and prognostic factor for patients with lung cancer.",

Methods twenty-four rabbits were randomized to control (CRL) or induced BD (increasing intracraneal pressure above systolic pressure for 30 minutes) groups and were ventilated in volume controlled mode (tidal volume 10 ml/kg, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 0 cmH2O and respiratory rate (RR) to obtain normocapnia) for 120 minutes.

Pulmonary edema and lung injury were assessed by weight gain, change in ultrafiltration coefficient before and after ventilation; and extent of hemorrhage (scored by histology: intensity of alveolar hemorrhage, percentage of alveoli with hemorrhage and number of vessels with perivascular hemorrhage) Mean values (3 samples per lung) of the 3 indices of hemorrhage showed above were scored (0 to 5) and added to obtain a score of overall lung hemorrhage (range 0 to 15) for each lunch.

Background Lung cancer represents 15% of all cancers, but is responsible for nearly 30% of cancer related deaths due to the fact that it is most often detected in a very late stage. It has been proposed that selected nuclear features could be used to assist lung cancer detection in an early, operable stage. It was shown that both DNA amount (DNA ploidy) and nuclear size are key features for positive diagnosis in oral, laryngeal, bronchial, and gastric epithelial tumors. We used image cytometry to assess the potential of this approach using nuclei of epithelial lung cells from sputum samples. Experimental design Sputum samples were obtained by induction method, using hyperosmolar salinic solution, from 139 lung cancer patients and 148 high risk individuals. The cells were fixed and after breaking mucosa with mechanical and chemical treatment, they were cyto-centrifuged onto the microscopy slides. Cell nuclei were stained by a DNA specific and stoichiometric (Feulgen-Thionin) stain and DNA amount (ploidy) and nuclear size of 6000 (on average) cell nuclei from each sample were measured by a high resolution image cytometer.",

Two female patients with pleuropulmonary blastoma were 6 and 22 years, and cystic PB patients were 3 and 4 years old female and male children, respectively. Results One of our most striking histomorphological findings was that four of the biphasic PBs accommodate mature epithelium, not fetal epithelium.

CT examination revealed a well demarcated mass in the anterior-superior mediastinum as well as pleural and pericardial effusions. There was no clinical/radiographic evidence of tumor elsewhere. A surgical excision of the mass was performed. Grossly, the mass was round, well demarcated, measured 10x8.5x3 cm. The cut surface showed solid whitish or reddish with yellowish foci areas and cystic areas filled with mucinous fluid. Histologically, the tumor consisted of sheets and nests of atypical squamoid cells intermingled with gland-like lumens. Areas of clear cells were also present. In the tumor stroma, abundant amounts of mucin, foci of necrosis, lymphatic invasion, intense inflammation and cholesterol granulomas were observed.

In fact, only few patients survive more than two years. The identification of prognostic factors is critical to evaluate life-expectancy and crucial to approach novel therapeutical strategies. The study was performed to evaluate the use of MIB-1 and p27kip1 antigens as prognostic indicators of survival in malignant mesotheliomas. Materials and methods A series of 122 surgical biopsies of patients with known follow-up were immunohistochemically examined. The results were compared with survival data and correlated with clinical and histological parameters. For immuno-histochemistry, sections were stained for MIB-1 and p27kip1 antigens using ABC method. Number of positively stained nuclei was evaluated in consecutive high magnification fields (500 neoplastic cells were considered the minimum number to include the case in the study).",

A genetic study Introduction Very few papers dealt with clustering of familial malignant mesothelioma (MM). Most of these, who developed mesotheliomas, presented work or domestic history of exposure to asbestos, but only in very few of them asbestos did not demonstrated any association. The aim of this study was to contribute to the hypothesis of a genetic predisposition in the pathogenesis of the mesothelioma. Methods We report two cases of pleural malignant mesothelioma that affected two young sisters as part of a nine-member family with enviromental exposure to asbestos. They were affected by Marfan's syndrome and both developed pleural malignant deciduoid mesothelioma with long survival. We have performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses of tumor samples to identify critical chromosomal regions involved in the onset of MM.",

Examination of the nasopharynx showed us entirely normal features, or fullness, surface granularity, or obvious carcinoma. But, all our patients had cervical lymph nodes metastases, two of them bilateral. Involved lymph nodes were typically posterior of the sternocleidomastoid at the level of the angle of the jaw. Results Histologically, lesions show cytologically uniform cells with ovoid vesicular nuclei prominent nucleoli and indistinct cell borders resulting in a syncytial pattern. An inflammatory infiltrate rich in lymphocytes and occasionally containing prominent eosinophils is usually a component of lymphoepithelioma, but diagnosis is based solely on the nature of the neoplastic epithelial component. Neoplastic cells are negative for LCA, but positive for cytokeratin and EMA. Conclusion Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (lymphoepithelioma) is very rare. About 50% to 80% of patients are initially seen with cervical lymph node metastases from an occult primary. Such lesions may be different or impossible to distinguish from lymphoma on haematoxylin and eosin stained sections, particularly when the lesion appears as a lymph node metastasis from an occult primary.

Seventy-five genes were found to be more than 2.5 times overexpressed and 87 less than 0.4 times underexpressed than in samples of normal parotid gland. Five genes, namely fibronectin 1 (FN1), tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1), biglycan (BGN), tenascin-C (HXB), and insulin-like growth-factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) were overexpressed in all of the types of carcinoma studied. Sixteen genes, including mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (MADH4/SMAD4) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSM/PSA) were underexpressed in all types of carcinoma studied. Average-linkage hierarchical clustering undertaken in relation to selected genes showed that high-and low-grade MECs formed one group of tumours, ACC/SDC another. Significance analysis of microarray findings identified 33 genes related to the MEC group, 10 associated with the ACC/SDC group. Our results indicate genes that may be involved in carcinogenesis in the salivary glands.

They occur more frequently in women, usually between the third and sixth decades of life. Case report We report the case of a 44 year-old woman with gradual loss of vision in her right eye. Slit-lamp examination and binocular ophthalmoscopy showed a large and pigmented ciliary body mass located in the inferior quadrants. A and B ultrasound examination revealed a multicavitary tumor with low internal reflectivity measuring 19x13.8x10.9mm. Enucleation of the affected eye was decided. Histopathological examination showed a solid neoplasm composed of interlacing and tightly packet of spindleshaped cells with little intervening collagen. Nuclei were oval with blunted ends with no significant atypia. Mitotic activity was negligible. Immunohistochemical stains for smooth muscle actin, HHF-35, vimentin and desmin were positive. No stain was noted for S-100 protein, AE1-AE3 cytokeratin, CAM 5.2 cytokeratin, HMB-45, glial fibrillary acid protein, neurofilaments, neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin.

Results Twenty-six of cases were male and 10 were female. Follow-up was available for 26 cases and ranged between 2 to 66 months. Eight cases died and 3 had recurrences.

The mean age at presentation is 43 years. Sinonasal tumours are extremely rare and whilst they share the morphology of MPNST'S at other locations, they tend to be of low grade at this site. We describe a unique case of a high grade MPNST clinically simulating an allergic nasal polyp in an otherwise healthy child without identifiable risk factors. Methods A 13 year old Black boy presented with an obstructive nasal mass, which was first felt 6 months earlier. The clinical diagnosis was an \"allergic polyp\" and the mass was excised without antecedent roentgenographic investigations. Results The 7x4x3cm tumor was unencapsulated but circumscribed, lobulated and friable. Histologically, predominantly highgrade sarcomatoid and epithelioid areas were seen. However, differentiating features of peripheral nerve sheath tumor were also found. These included alternating hypercellular and hypocellular areas, palisading nuclei, perithelial accentuation of cells and serpentine, buckled nuclei. In low-grade areas, axons were demonstrated by silver staining. Of the broad panel of immunohistochemical stains done, only S100 protein positivity was observed. The latter was uncharacteristically prominent. Conclusion The young age of the patient, the tumor location and clinical presentation as an allergic polyp, the predominantly high grade microscopic appearance and the strong S100 protein positivity of this MPNST are unusual and hence worthy of documentation.",

The origin of the osteoclastoma like element has been a source of controversy, with conflicting theories emerging from the literature, some supportive of an epithelial origin with others favouring macrophage/ histiocytic lineage. Ret/PTC is a fusion transcript associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma but not previously described in a tumour of this type. Our aim was to examine more closely the osteoclastoma like component and assess the histogenesis of this tumour. Materials and methods Electron microscopy, histochemistry and a broad immunohistochemical panel were performed. In addition pure populations of each constituent cell type comprising the tumour were isolated using laser capture microdissection. After RNA extraction, each of these was examined by RTPCR for chimeric transcripts of ret/PTC-1 and ret/PTC-3. At this stage of our study, due to small differences in each epulis type, no far-reaching conclusions can be drawn. Further studies of CD68 and MDM-2 protein in the same group of patients seem to be justified since in the authors' opinion, they will explain biological behaviour of that type of tumours.",

There is just a few papers concerning on how many different concomitant tumours can appear in the human body. This is a case of 78 years old male with several tumours of different malignancy degree and morphologically benign or semimalignant cutaneous lesions. Case report During previous 27 years three times he underwent surgical excision of epitheliomas of the scalp, body and limbs. The third one has been removal of the epithelioma of the right frontoparietal region. At his age of 78 because of the stromal sized 4 cm in the right parotid salivary gland, followed by paralysis of the frontal and paresis of buccal branches, along with laboratory finding of 22.48 leukocytes, right-sided radical parotidectomy and suprahyoid dissection of the neck has been performed. Pathohistologic analysis confirmed malignant mixed stromal of the parotid salivary gland. Postoperative irradiation therapy has been applied in 21 fraction and total dose of 45 Gy. Nine months later the patient has been operated again because of an exulcerated, 5 cm diameter cutaneous lesion of interscapular region, which has proved to be the infiltrative squamous carcinoma G-2 grade. At the same time the chronic lymphoproliferative disease in the form of chronic lymphocytic leucosis A grade has been diagnosed (although the reactivity following the neoplastic process could not be excluded), but specific haematological treatment has not been indicated. Nine months later nine cutaneous facial lesions have been removed: malignant mixed stromal of the left auricle, senile keratosis from the left temporoparietal region, chronic dermatitis from the forehead, squamous carcinoma G-2 and seborrhoic keratosis one inch inferiorly, two lesions, sebaceous adenomas from the right zygomatic region, corneal squamous carcinoma G-1 from the right parietal region, baseocellular carcinoma from the left one and adenoid type of baseocellular carcinoma from the right supraclavicular region. The patient has been operated without complications and came five times for monthly control in a good general condition, without relapse, regional or distant metastases. Later on we ascertained that the patient suddenly died during a sleep seven months after surgery. Conclusion Pathohistologic examination of removed tissues and revision of the former specimens undoubtedly excluded the spreading of the one and same stromal in different regions, but proved multifocal appearance of tumours of the same embryologic -ectodermal origin in very different structures.",

Although cyclin D1 is believed to perform an important role in cell cycle progression, this G870A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) seems to be a critical modulator of its functions. It has been reported that the prognostic significance and mRNA splicing regulatory effect of G870A varies with tumor type and ethnic diversity. To explore the association between the CCND1 G870A polymorphism and the breast cancer susceptibility as well as other prognostic parameters, we employed 103 infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) cases and 215 native controls in this study. There is obviously correlation between the genotype distribution of these two groups (p=0.038), and the AA genotype reveals a higher association and risk than the AG+GG genotypes (p=0.011 with c2 test and OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.16-3.21, p=0.012). Moreover, there is no statistical significance found between genotype or allele frequencies and tumor stage, grade, nodal involvement, or patient'\u00a6s age. However, the trend tests of CCND1 G870A genotype distribution or allele frequencies to the increasing of tumor grade or tumor stage are significantly different when comparing the A vs. G allele (p=0.01 in both tumor grade and stage) or AA vs. AG+GG genotype groups (p=0.04 and 0.05 in tumor grade and stage, respectively) but no significance when comparing GG vs. AG+AA or AG vs. AA+GG genotypes. These results suggest that CCND1 G870A polymorphism correlates with IDC susceptibility, and 870A allele reveals an increased risk in carcinogenesis of IDC and worse prognosis.",

Quantitative Real-Time PCR for viral load determination of HPV in archival cervical cancer specimens could be of clinical and prognostic relevance. The aim: We investigate the prognostic value of HPV status and viral load. Furthermore, we compared the applicability and sensitivity of three molecular HPV-detection methods. Materials and methods All examinations were carried out from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of 164 cervical carcinomas. HPV status was detected by signal amplified chromogenic in situ hybridization (SA-CISH), conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and detection and additional quantitation was performed using Real-Time PCR. Results Patients with low viral load of HPV 16 in stage I carcinoma had a significantly better prognosis than HPV 16-negative patients (p=0.037). Additionally, high viral load of HPV 16 in patients indicating a higher stage carcinoma strongly tended to benefit prognosis compared to HPV-negative patients. Our evaluation of the molecular HPV-detection methods showed a higher sensitivity of Real-Time PCR and conventional PCR compared to SA-CISH. Conclusion It appears that cervical cancer patients can be distinguished in a HPV 16-negative subgroup revealing a worse prognosis, and a lower-stage subgroup with low viral load, respectively a higher-stage subgroup with high viral load, both indicating a better survival, maybe due to an altered immune status caused by HPVinfection. These findings are crucial to accord each patient the individual therapy, and point out the importance of quantifying viral load and the necessity of Real Time-PCR in HPV-diagnosis.",

In vitro, these interactions can be studied in coculture models. In conventional coculture systems, the different cell types are grown together in glass-slide based chambers with medium. In situ analysis can be easily performed, however, for mutational or gene expression analyses the cell compartments have to be dissociated and sorted. We present a novel technique for co-culturing fibroblasts and carcinoma cells and separating them without cross-contamination. Methods Our method is based on cell cocultivation on a 1.35 \u00b5m thin membrane followed by laser microdissection of tumor and stroma cells. For identifying the tumor cell compartment, immunolabeling for the laminin gamma 2 chain was performed, a marker that is expressed only in epithelial tumor cells. DNA and RNA was isolated from the microdissected cells. RNA quality was tested by RT-PCR for a housekeeping gene transcript and for the laminin gamma 2 chain gene transcript. Results Co-cultivation on the membrane did not influence growth behaviour and cell morphology. The RNA quality from the microdissected co-cultured and immunostained cells could be successfully proved by RT-PCR. Laminin cDNA was amplificable only in tumor cells and not in the co-cultivated fibroblasts indicating no cell-cross-contamination during microdissection.

Conclusion p53 overexpression is observed due to either mutations or protein stabilization.

They are classified into \"typical\" carcinoids (TC), \"atypical\" carcinoids (AC), large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNEC) and small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC), in order of increasing malignancy The aim of this study was to investigate X chromosome LOH and its association with malignancy in a series of endocrine tumors of the lung. Materials and methods DNA extracted from 9 TCs, 17 ACs and 4 LCNECs from 30 female patients was PCR-amplified using fluorescently-labeled primers for 18 microsatellite markers spanning the whole X chromosome. For LOH evaluation, amplimers were analysed in an automatic DNA sequencer (CEQ2000, Beckman Coulter). All samples were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and DNA from tumoral and non-tumoral adjacent tissue was available Results allelic losses were absent in TCs, while LOH on X chromosome was found in 6 of 17 ACs (35%) and in 3 of 4 LCNECs (75%). Allelic losses were generally wide, involving all or most informative markers investigated Conclusions allelic losses on X chromosome, absent in benign \"typical\" carcinoids, progressively increased their frequency from intermediate-grade \"atypical\" carcinoids to high-grade LCNECs. Therefore the observation that X chromosome LOH is associated with malignancy, already demonstrated in gastro-pancreatic endocrine tumors, is extended to another group of foregut-derived endocrine neoplasms, the lung endocrine tumors ",

A short-term study with microarray analysis in female rat liver Introduction Tamoxifen and toremifene are triphynylethyle antiestrogens used in the treatment of breast cancer. Tamoxifen is genotoxic hepatocarcinogen in the rat, whereas toremifene is not. In humans, long-term tamoxifen treatment causes an increased risk of endometrial cancer. The major difference between the genotoxicity of the two drugs is the formation of liver DNA-adducts in tamoxifen-treated rats. Differential gene expression in rat liver after administration of antiestrogens was studied by microarray analysis. Materials and methods Equimolar doses of antiestrogens were given p.o. to six week old female Sprague-Dawley rats for 10 days. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent. Equal amounts of total RNA from four animals in the same group was pooled and then purified from 1 mg total RNA using 35 mg oligo(dT)cellulose. Our cDNA array contained approximately 4000 cDNA clones selected from the TIGR Rat Gene Index. The samples were hybridized to rat cDNA array scanned with a GMS 418 scanner (Afflymetrix).

            "text": "Telomerase activity in chronic B-lymphocytic leukemia R Telomerase, the enzyme that elongates telomeres, contains an RNA template complementary to TTAGGG repeats that permits de novo synthesis of telomeric DNA onto chromosomal telomeric ends. Recent findings have suggested that activation of telomerase is one of the most common and fundamental steps in cancer genesis, although reactivation or telomerase up-regulation alone might be insufficient for cells to proliferate indefinitely. Telomerase expression seems to be concomitant with the attainment of immortality of cancer cells, but there are contradictory reports about telomerase activity in early and late B-CLL stages. In order to investigate the telomerase activity in patients with CLL and its correlation with the clinical stage, 47 frozen blood lymphocytes samples from patients with CLL (32 males, 15 females), and 47 age matched controls (32 males, 15 females) were investigated for telomerase activity using the 'Telomerase PCR ELISA-plus kit' from Roche, based on the Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol. Binet and Rai stages were evaluated at the time of sample collection, and re-evaluated after 14-16 months. Results were analyzed with a commercial statistic software package. The study showed that peripheral lymphocytes telomerase activity from B-CLL patients is significantly higher (3,9 times; p<0,01) compared to normal lymphocytes. The age and sex of patients does not influence the telomerase activity, while it is age dependent in healthy controls (Pearson Correlation -0,543; p<0,01). The study also showed that telomerase activity is increased more significantly in advanced stages of the disease, and correlates with the disease course. Introduction DeltaN-p63 isoforms may act as oncogenes, owing to their ability to bind to p53-reporter genes without inciting their transcription, thus blocking the p53-driven cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. A novel mechanism, linking p63 and Wnt pathways has recently been proposed. Briefly, in vitro studies have suggested that deltaN-p63 may block the phosphorylation of beta-catenin, leading to its nuclear accumulation and triggering beta-catenin-responsive transcription of genes related with proliferation and oncogenic biological behaviour. To test this new mechanism, the authors evaluated the co-expression of deltaN-p63 and beta-catenin in a large cohort of human neoplasms. Methods Two sections of TARP-4 multi-tumour tissue microarray, composed of 51 normal tissue cores and 400 human neoplasms (breast (n=75), colon (n=75), lung (n=75), prostate (n=75) and ovary (n=50) neoplasms, melanoma (n=25), and glioblastoma (n=25)) were subjected to immunohistochemistry with deltaN-p63 and beta-catenin monoclonal antibodies. p63 nuclear expression and b-catenin membranous, cytoplasmic, membranous+ cytoplasmic, and nuclear localisation were independently evaluated by three of the authors. Results p63 expression and beta-catenin nuclear localisation were found in 92.6% and 0% of squamous cell carcinomas, 8.9% and 0% of breast carcinomas, 13.8% and 0% of lung adenocarcinomas, 1.4% and 23.2% colon adenocarcinomas, 0% and 4.8% of prostate adenocarcinomas, 11.1% and 5% of ovary carcinomas, 9.0% and 9.1% of malignant melanomas, and 12.5% and 40.0% of glioblastomas, respectively. No statistically significant association between p63 and nuclear beta-catenin expression was found for all tumours. Conclusions At variance with squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, p63-driven nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin is an unusual phenomenon in human neoplasms. Caution should be exercised when translating the results of studies performed on cell lines to human neoplasms. Four GIST had no identificable KIT sequence alteration in exon 11. Mutations in c-kit seemed to be associated with favorable response to STI-571 (p= 0,078). Conclusion Kit mutations in exon 11 are common in diseminated gastrointestinal stromal tumors and appear to be associated with response to STI-571.",

Akt (protein-kinase B, PKB) is a serine-threonine kinase that is activated mainly by insulin, IGF-1 receptor and erbB family receptor signaling in a PI3-kinase dependent manner, and is implicated in tumor proliferation in breast, ovarian, pancreatic and gastrointestinal cancers. The phosphorylation of its substrate proteins result in increased growth and decreased susceptibility to apoptosis. The activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway is downregulated by PTEN phosphatase, and mutations or a loss of PTEN activity results in a high constitutive activation of the kinase. The aim of the present study is to investigate the levels of the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway in a series of colorectal carcinomas and to evaluate its role on tumor resistance to chemotherapy. We achieved 46 surgical colorectal carcinoma specimens at pT3 stage. All patients received at least two chemotherapy lines based on platinum and CPT-11 after surgery. Levels of activation of Akt were tested by immunohistochemistry in primary tumors using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated Akt at Ser473. In the series, 33 (71.74%) showed staining for phosphoAkt in tumor cells. Phos-phoAkt was detected in tumor as clusters of cells related to necrotic foci and differentiated areas and correlated with less response to chemotherapy. These results point out that 1. Activated Akt is often overexpressed in human colorectal carcinomas and 2.Activated Akt can be a parameter of chemotherapy resistance in colorectal cancer.",

Results 'Initial precipitating injuries' that are thought to cause the development of HS (febrile seizures in early childhood, head injury or meningoencephalitis) were present in the history of 12 patients. In the remaining 3 cases, no predisposing factors were found. Defects of NMD were observed in 7 cases; in three of these, no predisposing factors were identified in the patients\u00b4 histories. We suggest that in these cases, HS arises due to previously undetected disorders of cortical development.

It is believed to result from disrupted neuronal migration during cortical development. We report an unusual case of neonatal diffuse and bilateral cortical dysplasia revealed by refractory epilepsy. A male infant, born at 40 weeks' gestational age (GA) without familial history of neurologic disease, presented at birth a convulsive encephalopathy, associated with severe hypoxia with pulmonary hypertension and iterative hypoglycemia. A foetal goitre was attributed to hyperdose therapy for maternal Graves' disease between 20 and 30 GA. The patient died at 3 weeks of life from respiratory failure after intensive care. All the iso-and allocortical areas examined were normal at gross examination, but microscopically dysplastic. There was disorganization of the laminar architecture and presence of large multipolar neurones diffusely distributed over the cortex. They showed positive immunoreactivity with neurofilaments and synaptophysin, and were negative with GFAP and vimentin. Numerous ectopic neurons were found in the white matter. In addition, C shaped thickened inferior olive was noted. The cerebellum, including dentate nuclei, and other brain stem nuclei were normal. Focal cortical dysplasia lesions are localized malformation of the isocortex with positive GFAP and vimentin in dysplastic neurons. In this case, the dysplastic lesions were diffuse and astrocytes were normal. No genetic investigation was available, but the negative immunostaining of large cells by GFAP does not favour the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis. The pathogenesis of this exceptional disease remains obscure but the responsibility of the foetal thyroid disorder cannot be excluded.",

Material and method 10 selected cases were analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining was applied as polyclonal antibody for Ki-67 (DAKO-A-0047) and monoclonal antibody for bcl-2 (bcl-2/ 100/D5 Novo Castra) on paraffin blocks.Fisher's qhisquare, correlation and Mann-Whitney-U tests were used for the statistical analyses. Results The ages of these patients were ranged between 1-29 (mean 8.6).The size of the tumoral mass varied between 3 to 6 centimeter. 6 patients were alive without illness.4 patients were lost due to tumor. We could not found a statistical revelance between neither immunohistochemical staining (bcl-2, Ki-67) nor tumor size on survival rates. Conclusion Due to radiotherapy and chemotherapy following surgery, the survival rates of medulloblastoma has increased despite the agresiveness of the tumor.

Case report The 49-year-old female patient was referred to our hospital with progressive right-sided hemiparesis, motor dysphasia and frontal lobe syndrome. Symptoms started 14 days earlier with acute headache and no febrile state was reported. MRI of the head revealed two oval lesions with hyperintensity in T2 weighted images of left frontal and parietal lobe. The first diagnostic impression was of glioblastoma multiforme. Results from standard blood and urine tests, tumor markers and cytological analysis of bone marrow were normal. Analysis of CSF and culturing CSF and serum for bacterial, viral, protozoan and fungal infections were negative. Analysis of CSF revealed increased immunoglobulins, 3OCB and increased intratecal synthesis of IgG. A stereotactic biopsy was performed one month after first symptoms. Neuropathology findings. The biopsy after neurosurgical treatment yielded five needle cores of grayish cerebral tissue. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of paraffin embedded tissue showed demyelinating white cerebral tissue with relatively sharply defined margins.

Conclusion To improve the diagnostic accuracy of the SGBB, the following items should be taken into consideration: The quality of the ICP with giemsa staining is very important. In the biopsies from the lesions, which are suspected as neoplasia having, microscopic features such as gliosis, edema, hemorrhage must be interpreted as non-diagnostic. The number of the biopsies must be increased in the presence of necrosis. Epitheloid and pleomorphic cellular groups can mimic benign and malignant pathologies.

The patient, a 53 year old male, presented with a 1-year history of severe intermittent low back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging detected an intradural, extramedullar, space occupying mass at the level of L2-L3, causing displacement of cauda equina roots. Laminectomy and complete removal of the lesion were performed without neurological problems. On gross examination the resected specimen was a redbrown, well demarcated, lobular mass, measuring 1.8 cm in greatest diameter. Remnants of a nerve root were recognized at the periphery. Histological examination showed that the lesion was located within the endoneurium. It consisted of multiple small dilated capillaries, often showing incomplete lobular pattern, dispersed within normal nerve fascicles. The endothelial lining showed neither nuclear atypia nor mitotic activity. In the substrate mild edema and focal inflammatory lympocytic infiltrations were found. Haemangiomas of the spinal nerve roots often pose a challenging diagnostic problem, and knowledge of their existence is relevant since they can mimic other more frequent tumors of the region.",

In this study, the value of ezrin immunoreactivity (IR) was invastigated as a grading and prognostic parameter in astrocytomas. Material and method Ezrin IR was studied in 13 low grade and 17 high grade astrocytomas. The mean age of the patients was 37.83 . Monoclonal ezrin antibody (MS-661-R7 Neomarkers) was applied on the sections of the paraffin-embedded tissues. Immunostaining intensity of ezrin was estimated as semiquantitatively. When no staining was visible the score of 0, mild staining scored as 1, moderate 2, and severe staining scored as 3. Also positive stained areas were evaluated as percantage (25%, 25-50%, above 50% staining areas). Statistically Man-Whitney U, Kruskal Wallis and Spearman tests were used. Results There was no correlation between prognosis and neither the grade nor the staining intensity of ezrin IR. Conclusion There are controversial reports especially about the prognostic value of ezrin IR in different types of tumors. There is one report about the association of ezrin IR with the increasing malignancy of astrocytic tumors.

Histopathological characteristics are cystatin C amyloid deposits in meningocerebral blood vessels, narrowing, splitting of media, segmental fibrinoid necrosis and microaneurysms of small arteries and arterioles. Associated changes: hemorrhages, infarctions and reparative reactions depending on length of the disease course. This study is a part of an investigation mapping the distribution of cystatin C immunopositive deposits outside the CNS in HCCAA. Material and methods Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded autopsy material from 16 patients, 10 females and 6 males, was studied by conventional light microscopy (HE, Congo red; Thioflavin S) and immunohistochemistry (Avidin-Biotin-Peroxidase) with cystatin C antibodies (ABC-complex kit from Vector).

White resin and immunogold labelled (colloidal gold labelled protein A. Sigma). Results and conclusion Cystatin C immunoreactive deposits were found in most organ systems outside CNS. The deposits were primarily located in the adventitia and perivascular tissue of small blood and lymphatic vessels and vascular smooth muscle; in subepithelial connective tissue of intestinal surface epithelium and glandular epithelium; in peripheral nerves. Cystatin C immunoreactive blood vessels were not obviously damaged as those in the CNS possibly reflecting environmental factors different in these two separate locations not yet identified and characterized.

In fact, several studies performed on animals demonstrated the possible role of serotonin and the involvement of its receptors 5-HT(2C) and 5-HT(1A) in the modulation of this process even if is not clear how it is realized. The aim of our study is to verify the presence of serotonin transporter (SERT) in the pinealocytes, a molecule involved in the reuptake of 5-HT from synaptic space, and to represent the action site of I.R.S. antidepressant drugs. We tested with immunoautoradiographic method (IARG) frozen slices conserved at -80 C o , derived from twenty cadaveric epiphysis (11 men, 9 women) by utilizing a mouse monoclonal anti-SERT antibody followed by a secondary biotinilated anti-mouse IgG antibody, consecutively linked with an avidine/[ 3H]-biotine complex for a precise localization of the researched molecule. The tritium sensitive films were exposited to treated slices in special cassetes. After thirty days of exposure at -80 C o , the films have been developed and fixed to obtain auto radiographic images in which the radioactivity distribution followed a continuum pattern in sequential slices of each subject. It was the expression of SERT presence in epiphysis. This is the first study that demonstrate the presence of SERT in human epiphysis. We suppose that serotonin in human is not only a melatonin precursor synthesized in the pinealocytes but it is involved in the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism of the gland. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies allow to identify sites harbouring tumor suppressor genes involved in tumor initiation and progression. This study was performed to establish the frequency of LOH on chromosome 10q in glioblastoma. 30 cases of glioblastoma were examined (13 women,17 men; age: 33-75 years). Two cases were secondary glioblastoma. In all cases the representative neoplastic tissue and normal brain tissue were cut out with lancet from respective paraffin blocks. DNA was isolated with proteinase K with phenol/ chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. Polymorphic markers were localized close to three supressor genes PTEN (D10S1765, D10S215), LGI1 (D10S1680), DMBT1 (D10S587) which are known to be lost or mutated in glioblastoma. The fith marker was D10S607 10q22.2. Fragments were PCR-amplified and analysed using automated sequencer ABI1310. Signals from neoplastic and normal tissue were calculated. Result under 0,6 was scored as LOH. In 14 cases at least one marker from chromosome 10q was lost. 11 cases with LOH were men, both secondary glioblastomas showed deletion in 10q. The mean patients' age with and without 10qLOH was similar. 5 cases showed LOH only in PTEN locus. In 9 cases deletions were stated in two or more loci, what might suggest loss of longer part of chromosome 10. Cases with LOH in 10q revealed additional changes in different chromosomes: LOH in 1p (2 cases), 2p (2), 2q (1), 3p (2), 7q (1), 13q (1), 15q (2), 17p (1). Our results are similar to the other studies, showing changes in 10q in about 50% of glioblastoma.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate histopathologic changes in skin biopsies of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Material and methods Skin biopsies of 30 patients (22 women and 8 men; age range from 15 to 55 years) with preliminary diagnosis of SLE, based on clinical data and laboratory analyses, were studied with the purpose to specify the differential diagnosis. Biosy tissue specimens were fixed in 4% neutral formalin, embedded in paraffin, and serial sections were stained with haematoxilin-eosin, picrofuxin, and the combined Rhitter-Olesson staining. After treatment of the specimens with 0.1 % trypsin, direct immunofluorescence technique was carried out for detection of immunoglobulins G and M at the dermo-epidermal junction (lupus band-test). Results Our study established the presence of hyperceratosis with formation of keratic clogs, epidermal atrophy with vacuolization of basal cells, vasculitis, eosinophilic degeneration of collagen and an atrophy of appendages. Specific immunostaining for immunoglobulins G and M at the dermo-epidermal junction was observed in all except in 7 cases. We did not observe inflammatory cell infiltrates in dermis in any case. Conclusion The pathogenesis of skin histologic lesions in SLE is most likely associated with immunological reactions and therapy carried out earlier.",

Development of skin melanoma was related to preceding pigment formations in 18% to 85% of patients. Among a variety of investigation methods histologic one is basic to establish the final diagnostic. Complex morphologic study was carried out on 343 skin biopsies with different types of pigment nevuses and melanomas. Of them 106 biopsies were selected for the thorough pathomorphologic investigation. Light microscopy, electron microscopy and morphometric method were used. Serial sections for light microscopy were stained with hemotoxylin and eosine, picrofuchsin-fuchselin by Van-Gizon, combined staining by Riter and Oleson. The findings have shown that the rate of pigment skin neoplasms of all the biopsy material of a specialized institution came to 1,12% among neoplastic and 11,9% among non-neoplastic skin lesions. Pigment nevuses more frequently occurred in females aged 21 to 50 years applied for medical aid, while melanoma in ones above 60 years. Intradermal nevus was diagnosed in 86,9% of cases, its proliferative activity was expressed in 55% of patients. In 66,3% of patients skin melanona was assigned to 3-4th grade of invasion according Clark's classification. Each form of pigment nevus had morphometric peculiarities, significantly differing in dimensions of the cell, nucleus and their ratio. The most reliable parameter of malignization was the length of the nucleus and cell axial section circle.

The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of the p53 tumorsuppressor protein in the pathogenesis of different hyperproliferative, non-malignant and malignant skin diseases, and association between p53 overexpression and cell proliferation. We also investigated the influence of ageing on p53 and Ki-67 protein expression. Material and methods Hundred and fifty skin specimens, consisting 30 cases of each, normal skin (NS), psoriatic skin (PS), keratoacanthomas (KA), basal cell carcinomas (BCC), squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) were examined immunohistochemicaly to assess p53 and Ki-67 protein expression. Results p53 immunostaining of NS, PS, KA, BCC and SCC was positive in 39.0%, 46.7%, 66.7%, 80% and 86.7% cases, respectively. p53 and Ki-67 positive cells were present in basal (NS) and suprabasal layers (PS), and not only in cancer nests of KA, BCC and SCC, but also in dysplastic and even morphologically normal epidermis adjoining cancers. The positivity of p53 and Ki-67 protein differed significantly among the groups, with no differences in p53 expression between NS and PS, and in Ki-67 expression between PS and KA. Within all groups, there was a significant correlation between p53 and Ki-67 protein expression. Localisation and age were significantly related to p53 and Ki-67 expression in all groups, except for localisation in PS, and age in BCC. Conclusions Our findings suggest that p53 overexpression occurs widely in neoplastic and non-neoplastic skin lesions. It is associated with the cell proliferation in normal, as well as, in changed epithelium. P53 accumulation is an age related process and significantly related to sun exposure, especially in NS and PS, as well as in KA and SCC. We also suggest that p53 overexpression begins in the early stage of carcinogenesis, before the appearance of malignancies in skin, and may be a useful predictor for the detection of nonmelanocytic skin cancer.

The aim of this study is to detect in 30 cases of malignant melanomas. Materials and methods Analysis were performed in 30 paraffinembedded cases of cutaneous malignant melanomas (10 cases in situ and 20 cases invasive melanomas). Apoptotic index (AI) was determined using the in situ end-labeling technique(TUNEL), who quantify apoptotic cell death at single cell level and tissues. Discussion and conclusion AI was high in the cases of in situ melanomas, but in invasive melanomas (nodular melanomas, superficial spreading melanomas with vertical growth phases, acral lentiginous melanomas etc) AI was decreased in tumor cells. We considered that usually apoptotic cells represent ~ 10% of tumor cells. At cases of cutaneous malignant melanomas in which AI was high (27%), frequently at in situ melanomas, the prognostic is good, when in the others cases in which apoptosis is missing or is very rare in cells (34%), the prognostic is reserved. This nonmorphologic technique to evaluate the prognosis of melanoma must be regarded as investigational and cannot yet be recommended for routine application.

We retrospectively reviewed the nephropathologic features to elucidate its value. Materials and methods One hundred students, 43 boys and 57 girls, who were found to have hematuria and/or proteinuria by this urine screen program and received renal biopsy, formed the basis of this study. The glomerular pathology was divided according to disease severity into two groups. Results Group I diseases (58%) showed minor histologic alterations, including minimal glomerular change in 40 cases and mesangial cell proliferation in 18. Among them, 42 children had electron microscopic examination, 24 (57%) had thin glomerular basement membrane (TGBM) disease. Group II diseases (42%) had more severe glomerular changes, including IgA nephropathy in 19 cases, membranous nephropathy (MN) in 12, lupus nephritis in 4, focal sclerosis in 2, chronic glomerulonephritis in 3, and type I and type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in one case each. These findings confirm that glomerular diseases often progress silently. We found a high frequency (74%) of IgA nephropathy and MN in group II diseases and a close association of MN with hepatitis B virus infection. Conclusion We conclude that mass urine screen in school children and renal biopsy are very useful for the early detection of the progressing glomerular diseases and provide great opportunity for early therapeutic intervention and long-term follow-up to better understand the natural courses of glomerular diseases, including TGBM disease. Introduction The purpose of the study was to establish a correlation between morphometric kidney biopsy parameters and routine laboratory findings in patients with nephrotic syndrome. Material and methods 104 kidney biopsies of 58 patients with nephrotic syndrome were studied using standard techniques of paraffin sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin, picrofuxin van Gieson and PAS reaction. Direct immunofluorescence on snap frozen sections was performed using commercially available antibodies against IgA, IgM and IgG.",

Therefore additional prognostic factors are needed. In this study we investigated the role of proliferation, growth arrest and apoptosis in the carcinogenesis and prognosis of RCC using Ki67, Cyclin A, Bax, P53 and Bcl-2. Material and methods Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks from 30 patients were studied. Cases were divided into low/high grade and low/high stage. Apoptotic index (AI) was evaluated as morphologically in H&E stained sections. Proliferation index (PI) was detected by using Ki67 and Cyclin A immunostaining. AI, PI, P53, Bcl-2 and Bax expressions in tumor tissue (TT) and in adjacent non-tumoral tissue (ANT) and associations with clinical and histopathological parameters were analysed statistically. Results The mean indices for apoptosis, Ki67 and Cyclin A were: 5.10\u00b13.86 (0-16), 15.47\u00b117.78 (0-63) and 19.50\u00b126.21 (0-108) in TT as well as 4.93\u00b13.74 (0-15), 0 and 4.13\u00b13.28 (0-12) in ANT, respectively. The number of cases in which the expression of P53, Bax and Bcl-2 were detected was: 14 (46.7%), 19 (63.3%), 13 (43,3%) in TT, and 0 (0%), 16 (53,3%), 18 (60%) in ANT, respectively. Statistically, there was a significant relationship between the values of TT and ANT for AI but not for the PI and the other parameters. Only AI and PI significantly correlated with the grade. Conclusion In this study the role of PI as a prognostic indicator in RCC was again confirmed. Our observations suggest that apoptosis, Cyclin A, Bcl-2 and Bax may have roles in the carcinogenesis of RCC and that AI may be used as a prognostic indicator.",

Many authors consider IMH as minor abnormality where glomerular changes are not expected, but general agreement has not yet been achieved. The aim of this study was to evaluate contribution of renal biopsy to diagnosis of glomerular disease in IMH. Material and methods Biopsy was performed in 54 children with IMH of proven glomerular origin. Mean duration of IMH prior to biopsy was 2.8 years. Biopsy specimens were examined by light (LM), immunofluorescence (IF) and electron microscopy (EM). Results 43 patients (79.6%) were found to have glomerular abnormalities. On LM 18 patients had normal glomeruli (NG), 22 mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MEPGN), 9 focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FGS) 3 focal glomerulonephritis (FGN) and 2 membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). IF revealed 10 cases as IgA nephropathy. EM discovered GBM changes consistent with Alport syndrome in 21 patients and diffuse thinning of GBM in 10. In 5 children, subepithelial hump-like deposits were found and considered as the sign of acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis in resolution. One of 2 cases of MPGN showed to be type II (DDD). On follow-up, 6 of 21 children with Alport-like GBM changes developed full clinical picture of the syndrome. Further surveillance is needed to confirm the significance of EM findings in others. Conclusion In children with IMH renal biopsy is justified and should always be analyzed by light, immunofluorescence and especially electron microscopy, because EM was decisive for final diagnosis in about 66% of all cases.",

Case report A 69-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency services for acute abdominal pain in September 1995. She was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. In CAT (without urologic symptoms) a solid mass in the upper pole of the right kidney was founded. With a clinical diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma a radical nefrectomy was performed. Follow-up was without event and had no recurrence 8 years afterwards. The right kidney weighed 228 grs. and was unremarkable except for a 3 cms-diameter circumscribed, yellow-tan, solid tumor in the upper pole. Microscopic ex-amination revealed a tumor composed of spindle cells, mostly smooth-muscle cells and fibroblast, with numerous vascular structures and some areas of renal tubules with clear cytoplasm. In some places there was atrophic tubules. No mitotic figures were identified. Immunohistochemistry findings: The majority of spindle cells were positive for actin, desmin and smooth-muscle actin, and vimentin. And the tubular epithelium stain for EMA and keratins.

Clonal analysis has suggested that in renal hyperparathyroidism glands initially grow diffusely and polyclonally. Mechanism of monoclonal proliferation observed with appearance of nodular hyperplasia is not well understood. It might be induced by certain genetic disorders such as overexpression of PRAD/cyclin D1 induced by DNA rearrangement of the parathyroid hormone gene. The aim of this study was to analyse the expression of cyclin D1 in normal and hyperplastic, diffuse and nodular parathyroid glands in order to ascertain the possible difference. Materials and methods 140 hyperplastic parathyroid glands, from 46 uremic patients who underwent surgery during the period 1977-2003, were analysed. Immunohistochemistry for cyclin D1 protein was performed on 10 normal parathyroid glands and 47 selected hyperplastic, 14 of diffuse and 33 of nodular type. Overexpression of cyclin D1 was considered to be present if 40 % or more of the sample showed positive nuclear staining. Results In normal glands, the mean value of nuclear positivity was 19.94%. Overexpression for cyclin D1 was present in 11/15 (78%) diffuse and 27/33 (82%) nodular hyperplastic glands. No significant difference was found. Conclusion In comparison to normal, hyperplastic glands (nodular as well as diffuse) overexpress cyclin D1 protein. These results indicate that overexpression of cyclin D1 is not limited only to neoplastic proliferation, as the most studies showed, respectively this genetic abnormality is not the only responsible mechanism for the monoclonal proliferation.",

Aim of the study was to compare the composition of interstitial ECM proteins with clinical data in various forms of primary glomerulonephritis (GN). Material and methods We examined renal biopsies from 55 GN patients, while normal renal tissue was obtained from nephrectomy due to small renal tumour. Specimens fixed in B5 and/or Dubosque fixative were analysed by immunohistochemistry (APPAP-method) using a monoclonal antibodies against tenascin (TN), fibronectin (FN), collagen I, III and IV (COI, COIII, COIV) (DAKO). The same fixatives were used for control renal tissue. Evaluation of fibrin was performed on frozen sections by immunofluorescence. Clinical data were: proteinuria and serum creatinine level, obtained by standard laboratory methods, immunotherapy and ACE-genotype. Results Fifty patients had proteinuria at time of biopsy and 33 of them continued to have it during the follow-up period. Patients with persistent proteinuria had more often interstitial fibrosis with elevated content of COI and COIV. Only 10% of patients who responded well to immunotherapy had deposits of fibrin. There were 12 patients with elevated creatinine at biopsy with similar composition of ECM as patients with proteinuria. Majority of patients with interstitial fibrosis had ACE-genotype II although this genotype wasn't the most common in the cohort. Conclusion Our study showed that persistent proteinuria could be linked to interstitial fibrosis and fibrin deposits. Patients with II ACE-genotype are more prone to develop interstitial fibrosis.",

Kidney biopsy specimens of 18 patients were analysed by light microscopy, immunofluorescence and electron microscopic techniques. A semiquantitative scale for gradation of cumulative tubulointerstitial lesions and interstitial haemorrhagic lesions was applied (scores 0-4). Results Seventeen patients (41.5%) had Puumala and 24 (58.5%) Dobrava virus infection. All patients were febrile and had proteinuria, and other clinical features were: nausea and vomiting (85% of patients), oliguria (73%), abdominal pain (61%), headache (61%), haemorrhages (54%), myalgias (44%), diarrhea (41%), neurological and ophthalmological abnormalities (34%), hypotension (12%). Pancreatitis (12%) and elevated transaminases (7%) were observed only in patients with the Dobrava serotype.

Biopsies were immunostained for Von Willebrand factor (vWF), fibronectin (FN) and CD68. Glomerular staining for vWF and FN was graded in a semiquantitative manner using the 1-3+ scale. Results In the CR group there was markedly increased expression of vWF and FN in the glomeruli, whereas only 8 of 40 AR cases showed intense (grade 3) glomerular vWF (GvWF). A significant difference was found between patients with AR and CR with regard to GvWF (p<0.01). A positive correlation between the degree of GvWF and early interstitial fibrosis was found in cases with AR in follow-up biopsies (p<0.05). The presence of transplant glomerulopathy was found significantly earlier in cases with grade 3 GvWF in AR group (p<0.01). We found strong correlation of both intraglomerular FN expression and macrophage infiltration with the degree of GvWF both in AR and CR groups (p<0.05). The outcome of grafts that showed intense (grade 3) GvWF was significantly worse than the outcome of those grafts with grade 1 and 2 glomerular vWF during the follow-up (p<0.001). Conclusion Increased GvWF deposition in cases with AR is in risk of early transplant glomerulopathy, early interstitial fibrosis and early graft loss.

Introduction BK polyomavirus causes a variety of infections in the urinary tract, involving transitional and renal tubular epithelium in immune suppressed patients, including transplant recipients. It can cause irreversible loss of graft function. We report a case of polyomavirus infection in a transplant recipient diagnosed by renal biopsy, urinary cytology and electron microscopy of the urine. Patient and results A 19-year-old female patient underwent renal transplantation, and received immunosuppressive treatment with tacrolimus, MMF and prednisolone. Serum creatinine level increased and hydronephrosis was observed in ultrasonography in the 3rd month. A renal biopsy was taken. No glomerular or vascular changes were observed. Some tubular epithelial cells displayed pleomorphism, hyperchromatism with chromatin irregularities and clumping, and intranuclear inclusion bodies. No immunostaining was detected with anti-CMV, HSV and EBV antibodies. Cytopathic tubular lesions in biopsy, many decoy cells in urinary cytology and intranuclear viral particles in electron microscopy of the urinary sediment proved the BK-polyomavirus infection. As the high serum creatinine levels persisted, despite alternative immunosupressive therapies, two more renal biopsies were taken, and acute rejection Banff grade Ib and IIa was diagnosed respectively. The patient is still under a novel antiviral treatment as the focal tubular cytopathic changes were present in the latter biopsy. Serum creatinine levels were still high, even though urinary cytology is normal. Conclusion As we have seen in this case, the differential diagnosis between rejection and infection in renal transplant biopsies is critical and complicated for both clinicians and pathologists, as well as patients.",

The antigens for MPR-ELISA techniques derived from recombinated genetic technology, unlike those produced from extraction showed better correlation with indirect IF microscopy. The own antigens originating from the domestic animals and human cadavers, used for indirect IF microscopy in bullous diseases, had the same value as the commercial ones. Conclusion In order to emphasize the importance of this paper, we can conclude that, undeservingly, very few papers from this area are being presented in the pathological congresses and are left to other specialities. The gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are rare tumors. There have been few factors identified that predict survival and biological behavior. This study analizes the experience in two university hospitals. Forty nine patients with GIST were identified from the tumor registry of both institutions. A retrospective review of patient clinic data, tumor and treatment variable was done. Expression of p53 and cellular proliferation antigens (ki67/PCNA) was also analyzed with overall survival as the main outcome variable. Statistical analysis was performed by log rank test and Cox regression model. Significance was defined: P<0.05. As results we found that median age was 53 years (range 16-82 years). Twentyfive patients were women (51%) and 24 were men (49%). Hispanics were predominant race with 22 patients (45%) followed by Caucasians with 18 patients (38%) and 9 African American patients (1%). The stomach was the most common site of presentation (47%) followed by small bowel (37%). Mean tumor size was 8 cm (range 2-46 cm). Complete resection was performed in 38 patients (77.6%). Actuarial 3-year survival was 65.5% with a median follow-up of 35 months . Univariable analysis identified overexpresion of p53 (P=0.00001), cellular progression antigens (Ki67/PCNA) (P=0.0065), high grade (P=0.00001), tumor size bigger than 10 cm (P=0.0045), and incomplete resection (P=0.00001), as significant negative factors, Hispanic race (P=0.013) and good performance status (P=0.0002) were significantly associated with prolonged survival. On multivariable analysis, overexpression of p53 was the only independent negative factor. In conclusion, p53 is the most significant negative prognostic factor for survival in GIST.",

A precise definition of granulomas has rarely been given, in particular mg, well-described in intestinal disorders, have not been focused on in gastric lesions. Aims: We summarize our experience with gg, including mg, and record prevalence as well as associated background morphology. Materials and methods Among gastric biopsies from 6.677 patients (7.837 gastroscopies), gg was diagnosed in 20 patients. Groups of histiocytes producing conspicuous alteration of gastric architecture were classified as well-defined granuloma (wdg); subtle collections of histiocytes failing to distort surrounding glands were labelled mg. The background morphology and presence of microorganisms were recorded. Results The distribution of types of granulomas were as follows: mg only 7 patients, mg and wdg 4 patients, wdg only 9 patients. The background morphology of cases with only mg/wdg with/ without mg included chronic gastritis (n=2/5); chronic active gastritis (n=2/7); ulcus (n=2/2); lymphocytic gastritis (n=1/1); carcinoma (n=0/1); otherwise normal morphology (n=1/1); H. pylori (n=1/4). Conclusion In concert with previous reports, we identified gg in less than 1% of all gastric biopsies. Since the identification of mg requires assiduous histologic examination, such subtle features may be overlooked; hence our calculated prevalence of gg is a minimun value. The functional relation between mg and wdg is uncertain. However, their coexistence in a proportion of gg could support a precursor function of mg in the development of wdg. Additionally, the background pathology of biopsies with mg and wdg were comparable.",

A panendoscopic study was performed and an ulcer localized at the large curvature of the stomach was disclosed. The microscopic examination of the endoscopic biopsy reveled invasive intravascular and stromal neoplastic signet-ring cells. Because of the subsequent poorly differentiated carcinoma diagnosis, a gastrectomy was performed. In the specimen the ulcer showed necrosis, edema, fibrosis, chronic inflammatory infiltrate with lymphocytes and plasma cells. Additionally atypical cells with irregular and hyperchromatic nuclei or vacuolated cytoplasm were seen in the lamina propia and infiltrating the muscular layers; isolated signet-ring-like cells were also seen. There was no involvement in regional lymph nodes. Histochemical study with periodic acid-Schiff, mucicarmin, and colloidal stains revealed mucosubstances in these cells. A poorly differentiated carcinoma was initially diagnosed. However the immunohistochemical studies were positive for histiocytic markers (CD-68, S-100 protein and lysozyme) and negative for epithelial markers (cytokeratin, and EMA). The positivity mucus stains in the histiocytes could be explained in this case by phagocytosis of mucous substances released from broken hyperplastic glands in the vicinity of the ulcer. To our knowledge, atypical histiocytic infiltration in gastric ulcers has not been previously described; thus, it should be included in the group of gastric carcinoma mimickers; with this basis, the pathologist must to be careful in the assessment of vascular permeation or stromal infiltration by neoplastic cells overall in endoscopic specimens.",

Paraffin sections were stained with H&E, van Gieson, periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and Gomori's aldehyde fuchsin -Alcian-blue (GAF-AB) stains. Six biopsies were subjected to electron microscopy analysis. Results On histological examination ileal mucosa revealed focal shortening of villi and lengthened crypts. The villi were lined by increased number of goblet cells. Mucin histochemical studies demonstrated partial conversion of the epithelium to a colonic sulfomucin mucin profile by positive GAF-AB staining in cytoplasm of goblet cells.

Case report A 39-year-old female patient was admitted to the clinic due to slight cough, right side pleural outflow and ascites, without other symptoms. Gynaecological ultrasound, ultrasound of the upper abdomen, CT refer to ascites besides normal findings of abdominal and pelvic organs. Laboratory examinations were normal except peripheral blood eosinophilia and increased values of Ca 125. Cytological findings of pleural outflow and ascites revealed a great number of eosinophilic granulocytes but without malignant cells. Patohistological findings During explorative laparotomy resected parts of both ovaries, a lymph node, a hyperplastic part of pylorus, a knot from a small bowel designated as a tumor, and an appendix were taken out for a patohistological examimation. Both ovaries reveal normal ovarial parenhima. A regional lymph node showed reactive changes with hyperplastic follicles and prominent germinative centers. The main histological finding reveals pyloric stromal edema and a dense infiltrate of eosinophilic granulocytes throughout the muscle layer as well as eosinophils situated in perivascular spaces which is accompanied with swelling of endothelium of capillary blood vessels. Eosinophilic granulocytes were found in the smooth muscle layer of intestine as well as in the subserosal tissue. Lumen of the appendix was obliterated and the muscle layer and the subserosal tissue contained eosinophils. Conclusion From our review it is visible that eosinophilic gastroenteritis can represent a great diagnostic problem especially when it is accompanied with pleural outflow and ascites and increasing values of tumor markers. That can possibly mislead a diagnostic procedure to the neoplastic rather than the immunological or allergic disease. Three years after surgery the patient is well.",

Approximately 15% of carcinoid tumors in the small intestine are associated with non-carcinoid neoplasms, most frequently adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract. The concurrent occurrence of carcinoid and other tumors in various organs is extremely rare. Here, we present a case of a 74-year-old male who was admitted to our Hospital with a 3-month history of haematuria. On cystoscopy a large tumor of the urinary bladder has found. A total cystectomy was performed. During the operation, while exploring the abdomen, a tumor with maximum diameter 2 cm was found in the terminal ileum, from which a biopsy was taken. Microscopically, the bladder tumor was a papillary transitional cell carcinoma grade II and the tumor of the ileum fulfilled the criteria for a composite carcinoid adenocarcinoma. The carcinoid component was positive for chromogranin and NSE and negative for EMA, CEA and CA 19-9 whereas the adenocarcinoma component was positive for EMA, CEA and CA 19-9 and negative for chromogranine and NSE. 18-months after the operation there is no metastasis radiologically and the patient is in a good condition. Due to the small number of tumors reported as composite carcinoid-adenocarcinoma there is need for larger number of similar cases as well as long term follow-up to determine their natural history and prognostic significance. We describe the first reported case of composite carcinoid-adenocarcinoma of the ileum associated with carcinoma of the urinary bladder.",

It plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Experimental evidences suggest that it could have a pro-oncogenic effect since Cdx1 overexpression up-regulates Bcl-2 and reduces p21; it is up-regulated by ras activation and its ectopic expression has been reported in intestinal metaplasia, in carcinomas of the stomach and in Barrett's esophagus. Despite these observations the role of CDX1 in colorectal carcinogenesis is not yet fully understood. In fact it has been shown to be down-expressed in colon cancers at mRNA and protein level. The aim of the study was to investigate the presence of CDX1 gene mutations. Materials and methods Twenty cases of sporadic colon carcinomas were collected. Total RNA and DNA from neoplastic and normal tissues were extracted. cDNA was synthesized and used as template in RT-PCR using oligonucleotide for CDX1 and \u00e2-actin. CDX1 three exons were PCR amplified and directly sequenced. Results We found lower expression of CDX1 in tumour samples in four out of ten cases. Sequencing showed a transversion G>C (10/20 cases) of exon 1 and a T>C transition in exon 2 (4/20 cases) that, being present in the corresponding normal tissue, were regarded as polymorphisms. No base substitution was observed in exon three. Conclusions Our results showed that CDX1 expression is reduced in colon carcinoma. However CDX1 was not found to be mutated suggesting that alterations, other than base substitution, may affect CDX1 gene in colon cancer. We are now looking at CpG islands methylation in the same cases since methylation could be a likely explanation of the low expression of CDX1. Aim This study investigates TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2 and TGFbeta3 proteins expression in patients with colorectal carcinoma and evaluates their correlation with classic prognostic markers and patients' survival. Design The study comprised 124 patients with colorectal carcinoma. According to Astler-Coller system, 42 tumors were of stage A, 42-B, 48-C and 20-D, whereas 106 tumors were low-grade and 18 high-grade of malignancy. On paraffin sections the streptavidin-biotin technique, using antibodies to TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2 and TGFbeta3 (SantaCruz, USA) was employed. Staining results followed morphometric analysis and were correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. Results TGFbeta1 protein was expressed in 88/124 (71%) carcinomas whereas TGFbeta2 and TGFbeta3 proteins were detected in all tumors examined. Normal colonic mucosal epithelial cells expressed less TGFbeta2 (p<0.01 compared to neoplastic cells) and less TGFbeta3 (p>0.05 compared to neoplastic cells), but not at all TGFbeta1. Statistical analysis revealed higher expression of TGFbeta1 in low grade carcinomas (p=0.009) and higher TGFbeta2 presence in advanced stage tumors (p=0.008). TGFbeta1 expression was related with higher disease free survival and higher total survival (p<0.05 respectively). TGFbeta2 presence was correlated with worse prognosis (p<0.05). Cox analysis revealed that besides tumor grade and stage, TGFbeta1 expression constituted independent prognostic factor. Conclusions This study shows that in cases of colon adenocarcinoma there is different expression of TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2 and TGFbeta3. TGFbeta1 may be implicated in the pathogenesis of these tumors since it is expressed only within neoplastic and not normal cells. TGFbeta1 is related with higher disease free survival, higher total survival and constitutes an independent prognostic factor. In the late stages, TGFbeta2 seems to be involved in tumor progression and it is related with worse prognosis.",

Colorectal cancer is a malignancy characterised by marked desmoplastic reaction both in primary tumour and in its secondary foci (metastases). Presented report was aimed to describe quantitatively microvessel density in primary tumour and lymph node metastases from this neoplasm. Materials and methods Study material included 36 cases of colorectal cancer with metastases to the regional lymph nodes. Investigated group comprised 20 women and 16 men (aged 33-85 yrs); 32 tumours were T3 and four were T4 according to TNM classification. Microvessels were highlighted using monoclonal anti-CD34 antibodies. Vessel counts were performed in five fields of each primary and metastatic focus (x200; 0.747 mm2). Numbers of blood vessels in colorectal tumour were counted in areas free from prominent necrotic foci and non-specific granulation tissue due to process of reparation. Vessel density in nodal metastases was determined in fields occupied by neoplastic cells forming their own connective tissue stroma. Results In the primary tumour group mean vessel density was 74.5 vessel/mm2 (median value 73.3; range 44-152). In metastatic foci the same parameter was 78.1 vessel/mm2 (median value 77.5; range 41-117); no statistically significant difference was detected. Only slight correlation was found between the microvessel densities in primary and metastatic tumours (R=0.39; p=0.1). Conclusion Presented results seem to prove the similar pattern of neovascularisation in both groups, whereas marked differences in this process can be observed between subsequent analysed cases. Early diffuse-type gastric carcinoma, especially signet ring cell carcinoma, often shows the superficially spreading growth pattern, and one of the unsolved questions concerning the histogenesis of this type of carcinoma is whether it is monoclonal or multiclonal in origin. We have performed Human Androgen Receptor Gene Assay (HUMARA assay) based on the random inactivation phenomenon of X chromosomes in female and reported that most of this type of carcinomas were of monoclonal origin (8/9 cases). However, this method demonstrated only probability of monoclonality in each lesion. Recently, 50% of diffuse-type gastric carcinomas have revealed mutations of the E-cadherin gene at the early stage of their progression, and in-frame skipping of exon 9 has been seen frequently. Thus, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of early signet ring cell carcinomas using E-cad delta 9-1, which is a specific antibody against a peptide spanning the fusion junction region between exons 8 and 10 of mutant Ecadherin. E-cad delta 9-1 specifically reacts with tumor cells expressing E-cadherin mRNA lacking exon 9. Seven of 44 cases were positive for this antibody. In each positive case, the paraffin blocks of the tissue slices that included the whole tumor were analyzed using E-cad delta 9-1. Although some signet ring cells with abundant mucin in the upper and/or lower layers of a layered structure did not react with this antibody, tumor cells were confirmed to express E-cadherin mRNA lacking exon-9 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tissues. These findings suggest that they are of monoclonal origin (7/7 cases) and support our previous data using HUMARA assay.",

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the value of current methodology for diagnosing GIMLs by presenting four unusual cases. Materials Case 1. A 33 years old male with common variable immunodeficiency. An obstructive ileal tumor 3cms was resected and multiple biopsies were taken along the GI tract from nodular areas. Case 2. Female 50 years old with generalised lymphadenopathy, lung shadows, dyspepsia and duodenal nodularity. Case 3. Female age 74 underwent gastrectomy with initial diagnosis of high grade B lymphoma. Case 4. Female age 74, had gastrectomy/ splenectomy for relapsed gastric Lymhpoma which had been diagnosed as MALT type. Methods Immunophenotypical analysis for detection of CD20, CD79a, CD10, bcl-6pr, bcl-2pr, CD5, Cyclin D1, CD23, CD43, CD45RO, CD3, Ki-67 and genotypic analysis for the clonal IgH, TCva genes (case 3) and the IgH/bcl-1 rearrangement (case 4). Results per case: 1. Atypical Burkitt Lymphoma with diffuse lymphoid hyperplasia of the GI tract (CD10/20/79a+, bcl-6+/2-, Ki67 100%). 2. Generalised follicular B Lymphoma, Grade 1 according to the WHO classification with involvement of the Duodenum. 3. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma with aberrant CD45 RO expression. Rearrangement of the IgH genes and not of the TCva gene. 4. CD5-Mantle cell lymphoma with anaplastic foci in the spleen. Clonal rearrangements of the IgH and concomitant IgH/bcl-1 gene rearrangements involving tonsils, stomach, spleen and abdominal lymph nodes. Conclusion All cases represent unusual types of GIMLs easily misclassified or graded without thorough immunophenotypic and molecular analysis.",

Gaining insight in the pathogenesis of this lesion is hampered by the limited knowledge of the origin and histology of cardiac mucosa (CM). Currently, the location, extent and even the existence of CM are controversial. Aims: We studied the development of the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) in embryos, fetuses and infants to clarify whether CM is a normal structure at birth and where it is located. Materials and methods Twenty-one autopsy cases were evaluated. Age range: 13 weeks gestational age (GA) -7 months. The distal oesophagus and proximal part of the stomach were embedded entirely. Serial sections were stained with haematoxylineosin and alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff. The following parameters were measured: length of abdominal oesophagus; length of columnar-lined oesophagus; length of CM; distance from CM to angle of His. Results CM was present in all evaluated sections. Its mean length varied throughout gestation. A maximum value was reached at a GA of 16 weeks (1,2 mm). After term delivery, it was very short (0,3 -0,6mm). CM was proximal to, or straddled the angle of His in all cases. During gestation, the mucin staining pattern of the CM was to a high degree similar to that of the developing pyloric mucosa. Conclusions CM develops during pregnancy and is present at birth as a normal structure. If the angle of His is taken as a landmark for the GOJ, CM is located in the distal oesophagus.",

DNA microsatellite instability (MSI) is more common in serrated adenocarcinomas than in conventional adenocarcinomas, but the frequency of MSI-low and MSI-high in these tumours is unknown. Materials and methods An unselected series of 23 serrated adenocarcinomas were included. MSI status was evaluated using panel of five markers D2S123, D5S346 and D17S250) . A tumour was considered to present MSI-high if two or more markers showed MSI, MSI-low with one marker, and MSS when none of the markers showed MSI. Results DNA MSI was observed in 47.8 % (11/23) of serrated adenocarcinomas, 13.0 % (3/23) being MSI-high and 34.8 % (8/23) MSI-low. MSI status showed no association with gender, age, location, size, Dukes stage, grade or mucinocity. MSI-positive serrated adenocarcinomas tended to have better prognosis (5-year survival 74.1 %) than MSS cancers (5-year survival 41.1 %), but this was not statistically significant (P=0.272, Log-Rank). Conclusions Serrated adenocarcinomas show prevalence of MSIlow higher than that reported for colorectal cancers (7 to 15%), supporting idea that serrated carcinomas are formed through a pathway differing from other carcinonomas. Absence of any association of MSI and clinicopathological features could be due to homogeneity of these neoplasms although a more extensive material is necessary to show more conlusively absence of any association. A trend for better prognosis in MSI -positive serrated adenocarcinomas probably reflects the biological behaviour of MSI observed earlier in colorectal carcinomas in general.",

TRb1 expression is abnormal in cancer cells in vitro and in some malignant neoplasms, but the role TRb1 in colorectal carcinogenesis is unknown. Materials and methods TRb1 expression pattern was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 115 operated colorectal cancers and correlated with K-RAS mutations and clinicopathological features. Results In normal mucosa, cytoplasmic TRb1 immunoreactivity was seen mainly in the superficial parts, while nuclear reactivity was most prominent in the cryptal epithelium. In tumours, nuclear expression was observed in 67% of cases and cytoplasmic staining in 68%, both mostly co-existing. Cytoplasmic staining for TRb1 was more common in polypoid (88%; 21/24) than in flat carcinomas (41%; 9/17; p=0.029). K-RAS mutations were more common in tumours with cytoplasmic expression of TRb1 (27.5 %; 11/40) than in those without (0%; 0/14). In lymph node metastases, occurrence of nuclear staining of TRb1 was more pronounced than in the primary lesion (P=0.003, Wilcoxon). Conclusions Expression of TRb1 is present in normal colorectal mucosa and is mostly retained in carcinomas, suggesting that thyroid hormones and their receptors may be involved in the physiological regulation of normal colorectal epithelium and in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Association of expression with K-RAS mutations indicate occurrence of functional linkage between TRb1 and ras signaling. Observations of a high expression in lymph node metastases and in polypoid cancers offer new clues to factors affecting metastatic cascade and growth pattern of colorectal cancer.",

For each subject we recorded the number and sites of biopsies, and reassessed for inflammatory activity, mucosal atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, lymphoid aggregates, Helicobacter pylori, amyloid deposition, and gastritis type. Age, sex, cause of renal failure, time from renal failure diagnosis to biopsy, type of dialysis, indications for endoscopy, SACA use, and serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, calciumXphosphorus product and parathyroid hormone were also recorded. The GMC cases were classified according to pattern of deposition (nodular, granular, mixed) and disease severity (mild, moderate, severe). Results The incidence of GMC was 13.8%. In GMC group there was male preponderance (73%). Compared to the control group, the GMC group had a significantly higher number of corpus biopsies; a significantly lower number of antral biopsies; a significantly lower frequency of mucosal atrophy; and a significantly lower parathyroid hormone level (p<0.05 for all). None of the GMC patients had used SACA. Conclusion Unlike previous reports, these results show that GMC is not linked with SACA use or female gender in CRF patients.

However the histological features in biopsy specimens are not always sufficient for a definitive diagnosis and there is need to establish more sensitive and specific criteria for the distinction between UC and CD. A retrospective blind evaluation of biopsy specimens from 102 patients with the endoscopical diagnosis of colitis was undertaken in order to assess the value of histology in the diagnosis of IBD and the degree of inter-observer agreement. Twelve experienced pathologists participated in the study. Twenty histopathological features according to a modified version of the British Society of Pathology guidelines for the evaluation of colorectal biopsies in suspected IBD were studied and the results were statistically analysed. The clinical diagnosis after follow up was UC in 57 cases, probably UC in 3 cases, IBD 2 cases, CD 3 cases and nonspecific colitis 37 cases. Higher than 90% agreement (by all 12 or 11 participating pathologists) on the diagnosis of UC based only on histologic parameters was reached in 28 of the 57 cases for which clinical follow up proved the diagnosis of UC. Unanimous agreement on the diagnosis of non-specific colitis was reached in 22 of the 37 cases.

The present study describes the findings in three cases of gastric parietal cell carcinoma consisting of parietal cells. We have used light and electron microscopy, and histochemical stains. We have studied three cases, two men and one woman, aged between 57 and 86 years. The tumour size ranged from 2,5 to 6,5 cm. The surgical specimens were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, alcian blue and PTAH. Small pieces of formalin fixed tumor tissue were collected in one case, and fresh tissue fixed in glutaraldehyde in another both for electron microscopy. Involvement of the gastric wall was observed in all tumours. The tumour pattern was characterised by an arrangement of tumour cells in sheets, elongated cords or in diffuse poorly cohesive sheets interspersed with a lymphocytic infiltrate. Tubular differentiation was only focally present in one of the cases. All the cases were composed by a large number of parietal-like cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, with a mixture of signet ring cells population in one of the cases. Alcian blue stain was negative throughout the tumour, whilst PTAH stained many tumour cells. Ultrastructurally the tumour cells were characterised by abundant mitochondria, tubulovesicles, intracellular canaliculi and intercellular lumina filled with microvilli. The three tumours presented are primary gastric carcinoma with cytological and ultraestructural patterns of parietal cell differentiation. They represent a morphologically distinct type of carcinoma, which has been said to have a favourable prognosis. Aim The aim of study is to investigate do really CD8+ cells have cytotoxic or suppressor influence upon gastric epithelium. Material and methods We have examined biopsies from 23 patients with peptic ulcer and 22 -with gastritis only. Samples were formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded, stained with H/E, toluidineblue, Gimsa stain, PAS reaction. Comparative immunohistochemical analysis of CD 8+ lymphocytes, proliferative markers: MIB-1 and PCNA were performed. We evaluated the amount of CD8+ cells in 1 mm 2 and the proliferative activity of epithelium per 1000 nuclei. 8 biopsies were examined electronmicroscopically for the detection of cell-to-cell interactions and subcellular alterations of gastric epithelium. Results Distribution, amount and characteristics of CD8+ cells are different in mucosa around ulcer and in gastritis (G.) cases without ulcer. In active G. around ulcer CD8+ cell are 12, 4; without ulcer -7, 7, but in inactive G.-4, 2. In Helicobacter pylori-infected subjects CD8+ are located in addition at the lymphatic follicles. We have not proved any rise of apoptosis, exfoliation or ultrastructural injuries of epithelial cells in the areas of collections of Tlymphocytes of this subtype. In sites of increased amount of CD 8+ cells there is high proliferation activity of epithelium (19,7-29,4%) due to the broadening of labeled nuclei zone with MIB-1 antibody. Conclusions The amount of CD 8+cells correlates with activity of gastritis as this 34 kD glycoprotein realize molecular reactions between mediators or against H.pylori, food and other antigens in lamina propria, but it has no external direct domain upon gastric epithelium, capillaries or glandulocytes.",

Despite declining (due to intestinal type), incidence still remains the second cause of death amongst all malignancies worldwide. Diffuse type of gastric cancer shows constant incidence. Therapy and prognosis directly correlate with extent of the disease and reliable prognostic factor is still lacking. The aim of the study is to establish a value of two morphometric methods -nuclear area and microvessel density and their influence to the survival of the patients with advanced gastric cancer. 113 patients who had undergone gastric resections for gastric cancer were analysed in this study. We estimate size of the tumor, histologic type (according to Lauren's classification), stage, nuclear area (median value of nuclear areas in 100 cancer cells measured with computerised nuclear morphometry) and microvessel density (median value of F VIII-positive microvessels in five X 200 power field) for each case. Statistical analysis was performed and p-values lower than 0,05 were considered significant. Nuclear area shows statistical significant correlation with size of the tumor, tumor stage, TNM classification and metastases in regional lymph nodes, microvessel density does not. In univariate analysis to survival, size of the tumor, tumor stage and TNM classification have p<0,05. Nuclear area only in intestinal type of gastric cancer correlates with survival (p<0,05). In multivariate analysis, size of the tumor, tumor stage and TNM classification have an influence on survival. Reliable prognostic factors in patients with gastric cancer are still stage and size of the tumor. Diffuse type of gastric cancer is still an enygma. Spreading and metastazing of intestinal type of gastric cancer could be predicted using a nuclear-area method as a support in therapy planning and prognosis.

Results PCNA was positive in 96% of carcinomas and localized in the nuclei of malignant cells.Immnunoreaction for Ki-67 was demonstrated in all carcinomas and mainly and strongly expressed in the nucleoli.Positive staining for PCNA and Ki-67 correlated positively with increasing grade. The labelling index was significantly higher in the poorly differentiated carcinomas than in the well differentiated tumors.

Here we present three cases of gastroesophageal junction tumours that could fill these criteria. We employ molecular and genetic techniques to ascertain the clonality of these tumours in order to determine whether they represent true collision tumours. Methods P53 immunohistochemistry was performed, and p53 sequence analysis was carried out on RT-PCR material derived from fresh frozen tissue. Mutations were subsequently confirmed in paraffin embedded material. Standard and laser microdissection techniques provided tumour-enriched samples from which DNA was isolated. Analysis of loss of heterozygosity was performed using the microsatellite markers D3S1478, D5S346, D9S171, D10S2491, D14S68, D16D2624, D18S64, TP53, P53Alu and Bat26. Results p53 immunohistochemistry was positive for both tumours in each case. All three tumours possessed a p53 point mutation that was identical in both components. Polymorphic microsatellite analysis confirmed shared losses of heterozygosity with an identical pattern of retention and loss at six loci in each component. Genetic differences were also observed between tumour components. Conclusion A comparison of immunohistochemistry, p53 sequence and the pattern of LOH for a spectrum of polymorphic microsatellite markers for three possible collision tumours suggests that both components are derived from a single precursor cell that undergoes divergent differentiation in the evolution of the tumour. The evidence presented here refutes the \"collision hypothesis\" and introduces a new histopathological entity of a cardia tumour with distinct diffuse signet ring cell and squamous components.",

Fifty three pts. had peritoneal and liver dissemination. The histopathological diagnosis based on the type of cells, mitotic activity and tumor size. The immunohistochemical expression of CD117 (DAKO), CD34 (DAKO), SMA (DAKO) and S100P (DAKO) were performed in each of the case. Results 1. Microscopic spectrum. Majority (70%) of cases had heterogenous pattern-spindle and epithelioid cells with high mitotic activity-more than 5 mitoses per 50 HPF. The intestinal and disseminated tumors had generally spindle cell histology with variable myxoid matrix or extracellular collagen globules reffered to as skeinoid fibers. The majority of gastric GISTs were composed of epithelioid, polygonal cells with perinuclear vacuolization. 2.The immunohistochemical analysis revealed strong and diffuse CD117 expression in 99 of cases, whereas CD34 was expressed in 65 cases. Four cases were negative for CD117 and positive for CD34. A minority of the tumors expressed smooth muscle actin which was focal.

Aims: We investigated the prognostic influence of p21WAF1/CIP1 reactivity in gastric carcinomas in relation to the p53 expression. Materials and methods The expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p53 protein was revealed immunohistochemically in 50 gastric carcinomas. Staining patterns were assessed semiquantitatively and correlated with clinicopathologic variables and survival times. Median follow-up time was 33 months (range 2-113 months). Chisquare and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were performed as statistical analysis. Results The p21WAF1/CIP1 protein was detected in 21 (42%) and p53 protein in 34 (68%) of 50 cases. p21WAF1/CIP1 expression was significantly higher in stages I and II carcinomas than in stages III and IV carcinomas (p=0.01). In tumors without lymph node metastasis, p21WAF1/CIP1 expression was significantly more frequent in tumors with lymph node metastasis (p=0.007). Low p21WAF1/CIP1 expression significantly associated with p53 protein expression (p=0.002).

The aim of this study was to correlate the results of immunohistochemical detection of hMLH1 and hMSH2 protein with results of mutational and MSI analyses. Patients and methods There were included: 21 CC samples from hMLH1/hMSH2 germline mutation carriers, 36 CC samples from non-carriers, and 16 CC samples from patients not subjected to mutational analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed using mouse monoclonal antibodies (anti-hMLH1, clone G168-15; anti-hMSH2, clone G219-1129, Pharmingen, USA). MSI was analyzed at ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer, mutational analysis by DNA sequencing. Results Loss of nuclear protein expression was detected in all 21 tumours from mutation carriers, all of these exhibiting a high grade of MSI (MSI-H), and in 8 of 11 MSI-H tumours from the other patients.

Aims: Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mucin changes in hyperplastic polyps (HP), adenomatous polyps (AP) with different degrees of dysplasia and adenocarcinomas (AC) of colon. Material and methods We selected 137 colorectal endobiopsies (22 HP, 42 AP and 67 AC). Thin serial sections were stained with hematoxylin-eozin, van Gieson and Alcian blue (AB) pH1 (for strongly sulphured mucins) and pH2.5 (for acid mucins: weakly sulphured mucins, hyaluronic acid and sialomucins). Observations were made only on intracellular mucins. Intensity of the stain was analyzed and compared with non-tumoral (normal) adjacent mucosa. Results and discussions Normal mucosa and HP showed a preponderance of sulphomucins (AB pH1) comparing with sialic acid (AB pH2.5). In AP (especially in those harboring high-grade dysplasia) we detected sialomucins in 72.96% cases and the depletion of sulphomucins (56.22%). In AC sialomucins were identified in 61.34% cases, while sulphomucins only in 36.84% cases. Significant depletion of sulphomucins occurs in AP with moderate and severe dysplasia and in AC, but it was also observed in AP with mild dysplasia. This suggests the possibility that without a proper mucin secretion consisting mainly in strongly sulphured mucins, colorectal epithelium is more vulnerable to environmental carcinogens.",

Material and methods Epithelial and stromal immunohistochemical expression of CB and CL was studied in 97 and 57 samples respectively. CB was analysed in 15 adenomas. Global and local infiltrating edge data were recorded. Clinico-pathological parameters were correlated with the immunohistochemistry. Results CB/L expression in normal epithelium was apical, with scarce macrophages in the lamina propria. An increase of both CB/L was observed in tumoral stroma, with higher CB at the infiltrating edge. The both global and deep stromal CB increased according to the T (p<0,005). Neoplastic epithelial CB revealed a basal stain whereas CL was occasional. Epithelial CB tended to show high expression in T1 (like high grade dysplasia) and low expression in T2 that increased progressively in T3-4 (p=0,058) . No differences were evidenced either as a function of N state, gender, site, differentiation or histological type. Conclusions CB/L immunoexpression in colon have a distinctive pattern which is altered in carcinoma.

Results Endoscopically, enlarged gastric folds, erosions or ulcerations, hyperaemia or intragastric nodularity, with preferential localization in the antrum, were described. Histologically, the neoplastic cells infiltrated between pre-existing lymphoid follicles, then colonized the lymphoid follicles. The resemblance of these cells to the centrocyte has led to the term \"centrocyte-like (CCL)\" cell-neoplastic component of MALT lymphoma. In some cases the cells had monocytoid appearance, but plasma cell differentiation also was prominent. Typical lesion for MALT lymphoma -\"lymphoepithelial lesion\", was frequent, representing infiltration of the glandular epithelium by clusters of neoplastic lymphoid cells with associated destruction of gland architecture and morphological changes within the epithelial cells, including increased eosinophilia. After the eradication of H.pylori, the patients were regularly followed-up with endoscopic and histological assessment. 18 patients achieved complete remission within 8 weeks, one had partial gastrectomy induced by ulcer with severe dysplasia, but with regression of MALT lymphoma (within 16 weeks), but the remission of the patient with Stage II 1e was achieved within 12 months. Lamina propria appeared \"empty\" with gland loss. Scattered lymphocytes and plasma cells were seen within the lamina propria and there were nodular collections of small lymphocytes. Lymphoepithelial lesions were scanty or absent. Conclusions The time taken for achieve remission of gastric MALT lymphoma in these patients varied from 2 to 12 months. The only significant prognostic variables were stage and tumorgrade.",

MUC1 belongs to the group of membrane bound mucins. It is assumed to play various roles in tumor immunology. MUC2 is marker of goblet cell or mucinous differentation of adenocarcinoma. The significance of MUC1 and MUC2 as prognostic markers in colorectal adenocarcinoma with mucinous differentation and mucinous adenocarcinomas was studied because previous investigations revealed inconsistent results. Materials and methods Tissues from 20 operated patients with mucinous or mucinous differentiation of colorectal adenocarcinomas were investigated. All specimens were classified according to WHO and TNM classification, including lymph node status and distant metastases at the time of the surgical intervention. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded colorectal cancer tissues were cut (5\u00b5m) and deparaffinized acording to standard histological techniques. Classical HE, histochemical PAS and HID-AB pH=2,5 and immunohistochemical BSP techniques were applied. The obtained results were evaluated by the x 2 test. Results The MUC1 immunoreactivity showed a strong correlation with tumours progression (as suggested by advancing TNM stages) and also de-differentiation (as reflected by tumorous grading). Localization and histological grading were also statistically signifficant. On the other hand, MUC2 did not show any association with the data concerning prognosis. Conclusions According to our data, only MUC1 presents as an independent prognostic factor of colorectal adenocarcinoma. MUC1 should therefore be considered as a potential target of immunotherapeutic strategies.",

Case report We describe the case of a 12-year-old boy who had the agressive sporadic coecal cancer, surrounded by nodular lymphoid hyperplasia.The boy underwent to partial colectomy cum omentectomy during the night with clinical diagnosis \"acute abdomen\". The surgical-pathological stage was: Stage III (T3NlMo). The patient received postoperative therapy, but he died with liver metastases eight months from surgery. Materials and methods Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded coecal cancer and surrounding nodular tissue were cut and deparaffinized according to standard histological techniques. HE, PAS, HID-AB pH 2,5 and immunohistochemical LAB techniques were applied. Results Fungous advanced carcinoma, 28 mm in diameter, induced stenosis and clinical symptoms of occlusion. Histologically, it was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with high mitotic index(high activity of Ki-67) and neuroendocrine differentiation; cancer cells were diffusely positive for p53 protein. Immunological reaction to MUC2, MUC5AB and MUC6, as well as to B lymphocytes, was negative. Microscopic examination of surrounding MALT showed large, confluent lymphoid follicles without germinal centres within lamina propria, causing nodular appearance of the overlying mucosa. B lymphocytes were markedly depressed in this nonhereditary form of colon cancer. Conclusions The authors have suggested that antibody deficiency, environmental, endocrine and genetic factors cooperated in the development of this nonhereditary coecal carcinoma.",

Methods, results and conclusion The development of the esophageal and gastric mucosa in the gastroesophageal junction was studied in 61 fetuses of 13 -41 weeks of the gestational age. During the 13th -15th week, the esophageal multilayered epithelium was covered by a continuous layer of columnar mucous ciliated cells which were present only focally till the 25th week and disappeared later. Before the 15th week, the gastric mucosa was formed by pits only. The glands started as proliferating tubules in the basal parts of the pits in the 15th week. Further, they differentiated into oxyntic glands. The mucosa of the corpus was fully developed in the 27th week. The cardiac mucosa was absent in all the 10 fetuses examined between the 27th and 41st week of gestation. This supports the view that the gastric cardiac mucosa is not a physiological structure but that it results from glandular metaplasia of the distal esophageal mucosa due to gastroesophageal reflux.",

Therefore in this study we will examine ABO and Rh blood groups distribution and correlation of them with pathologic stage of colon adenocarcinoma. Methods Data on age, sex, ABO and Rh blood types and pathologic stage (wall thickness involvement and involvement of lymph nodes) of the 232 patients with colon adenocarcinoma; were under surgical operation, were collected from three Tehran hospitals. And also data on ABO and Rh blood groups from 1500 healthy persons from above hospitals collected by randomized selecting as control group. Results The distribution of ABO blood groups in patients was different from control group; However, blood group A in patients was 5.3% higher than the corresponding control. There was no significant association between ABO blood groups and pathologic stage of colon adenocarcinoma. The distribution of Rh in patients was likely equal with control group; Although, there was a significant relationship between Rh (+) and wall thickness involvement (P<0.001) and involvement of lymph nodes (P<0.021).

Compelling data implicate that deregulation of p53 protein function may be associated with increased neovascularization and aggressive tumor growth. The aim was to investigate the prognostic significance of VEGF overexpression and microvessel count (MVC) at the deepest invasive site in colorectal carcinoma tissue as well as their relationship with p53 protein expression in tumor tissue. Material and methods Surgical specimens of 81 operated colorectal carcinomas were studied by immunohistochemical methods for detection of VEGF and p53 protein in tumor tissue and CD31 positive microvessels. Median folow up was 31.4 month (range, 2-66 months). Results VEGF expression and nuclear p53 protein overexpression were found in 66,7% and 58% of colorectal carcinoma. VEGF and p53 protein positive status was identical in 75.9% of tumors. The Dukes stage C and high MVC were significantly more frequent in VEGF positive tumors (53.7% and 64.8% respectively) comparing with VEGF negative tumors (25.9% for both Dukes stage C and high MVC). Hypervascularity significantly correlated with advanced Dukes stages, but not with the p53 protein expression. Survival analysis showed that VEGF and p53 protein expression as well as hypervascularity of colorectal carcinomas correlated with poor survival (p= 0.01). Conclusion VEGF is an important angiogenic factor in colorectal carcinoma, and its expression being dependent on p53 protein expression.

Material and methods Total of 24 patients with advanced proximal gastric carcinoma and up to 6 positive perigastric lymph nodes (T2/T3 N1 category) have been studied in the period between 1996 and 1998. Histopathological features (tumor size, macroscopic and histologic type, grade of differentiation, depth of penetration, invasion of intramural lymphatics and veins) as well as lymph node involvement have been routinely examined according to TNM and JRSGC systems. Detection of microcarcinosis (occult lymph node involvement) in lymph nodes groups 10 and 11 has been performed by multiple serial sectioning and using immunohistochemistry (monoclonal antibodies against cytokeratins 8 and 18, LSAB+ technique) and classified according to modified Kikuchi criteria. Results Occult lymph node involvement in lymph node group 10 has been observed in 7 patients (29,2%). Three of them (12,5%) had only single cell micrometastases (G1 type of microcarcinosis) and 4 patients (16,7%) had micrometastatic deposits greater than 200 microns (G3 type of microcarcinosis). Occult lymph node involvement in lymph node group 11 has been observed in 2 patients (8,4%) expressing single cell micrometastases in one case and micrometastatic cell clustering (up to 200 microns in diameter) in another case. Conclusion Occult involvement of lymph node groups 10 and 11 could be expected in lymph node positive patients with more than three positive perigastric lymph nodes.

The results were correlated to tumoral histological type, growth pattern, depth of penetration and vascular invasion. Results The overall detection rate of micrometastases showed their occurence in more than half of examined patients (15/27 or 55,55%) and in 10,87% of examined lymph nodes (96/883). Most of them were so-called single cell micrometastases (6,34%), followed by cluster-type of micrometastases up to 200 microns (4,07%) and few greater than 200 microns (0,45%). The incidence of micrometastases was 59,09% (13/22) in Lauren`s diffuse type of carcinoma contrary to 40% (2/5) in Lauren`s intestinal type of carcinoma. In addition, there was no significant difference in occurence of micrometastases in cases with and without penetration of muscular layer, contrary to cases with serosal tumoral involvement and obvious vascular invasion. Conclusion Detection of micrometastases might influence tumour stage migration to TNM stage III in further 10% of examined patients with primarily stage II determined diseases. The frequency of micrometastases seems to be closely correlated to poorly differentiated carcinomas, especially Lauren`s diffuse type of carcinoma and higher pT stages, including serosal involvement.

The term 'GIST' is preferentially used for the tumors that express CD34 and CD117/c-KIT and the latter has been suggested as a specific marker for GISTs. As GISTs constitute a group of phenotypically heterogenous mesenchymal neoplasms with uncertain biological behaviour, we reevaluated their histogenetic differentiation and proliferative status. Material and methods We reexamined clinically, histologically and immunohistochemically 33 cases of paraffin-embedded GISTs noted in the Tumor Registry of Clinical Centre of Serbia between 1997 and 2001, and especially in regard to their proliferation, measured by mitotic index and immunohistochemically by Ki-67 and PCNA expression scores. In addition, evaluation of malignancy of GISTs was based on mitotic count greater than 5/50 HPF and/or tumor size greater than 10 cm and extra-gastrointestinal spread. Results Most of gastric GISTs were composed of spindle cells (73%), epithelioid cells (20%) or both cell types (7%), and nearly 30% showed obvious clinical malignant behavior. Immunohistochemical examination showed strong CD117 expression in 93%, CD34 in 66,7% (two of cases exlusively CD34 positive) in nonmyogenic and non-neurogenic tumors. In addition, in GISTs with CD117 expression, focal expression of S-100 was found in 26,6%, focal SMA in 33% and desmin in 6,7% of cases. Ki-67 and PCNA indices were correlated to mitotic index and other criteria of malignancy. Conclusion Phenotypic differentiation of GISTs toward smooth muscle were found to be correlated with proliferative indicators of poor prognosis more consistently than those toward partial/focal neurogenic differentitation or uncommited type.",

Many isolated histological features, such as site, size, extent of bowel-wall involvement, necrosis, cellularity, mitotic counts, atypia, etc., had to be evaluated and integrated into a single and reproducible result that had also to be as accurately predictive as possible. Therefore numerous studies have been performed in order to reach the ideal combination of factors that may predict these tumors correctly. 55 GISTs were diagnosed either originally or retrospectively after reviewing diagnoses of GIT spindle cell tumors, examined in our Pathology Department between the years 1988-2002. All tumors were defined as GISTs only when displaying c-KIT (CD117) immunopositivity. Additional immunohistochemistry was performed to corroborate the diagnosis. We reclassified the tumors according to different proposed classifications and correlated the results with the clinical followup available for these patients. The followup periods ranged between 2-100 months for gastric GISTs (mean-32.2 months, median-24.5 months) and 6-62 months for patients with small-bowel GISTs (mean-32.3 months, median-30 months). While the median disease-free survival was 27.6 months for patients with malignant gastric GISTs, it was only 5 months for patients with small-bowel malignant GISTs. The results of the study show that all classifications stratified the patients in a very similar manner although some were more accurate than the others and more user-friendly and therefore probably also more reproducible. The relative high rate of deaths occuring in the smallbowel GIST group (45%) as compared to the 15.4% death rate in the gastric GIST patients, strengthens the supporters of different criteria to be applied to the GISTs arising in these different sites.",

The REG proteins, which all belong to the family of C-type lectins, have been implicated in cell proliferation, migration and differentiation in the gastro-intestinal tissues. The RELP gene spans 17.5 kilobases and maps to chromosome 1p12-13.1, whereas the genes of the previously known REG proteins cluster on chromosome 2. Dot-blot hybridisation revealed expression of RELP mRNA mainly in the gastrointestinal tract, but also in prostate, and testes. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated expression of RELP in mucosal neuroendocrine cells of in the small intestine and in the parietal cells of normal gastric mucosa. Regenerating borders of gastric ulcera, the goblet cells of inflammatory mucosa in ulcerative colitis and Crohns disesase, showed a strongly upregulated expression of RELP. Areas of intestinal metaplasia in the stomach and esophagus also displayed a robust content of RELP. More-over, RELP was strongly expressed in mucocellular and mucinous tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. The orthologous gene for mouse RELP was also cloned.",

Although according to accepted criteria none of them are 'benign', their metastatic risk depends on the tumor size (TS) and mitotic count (MC). Aim: Reclassification of a series of GISTs using morphological and immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded material and evaluation of the relevant clinical data. Material and methods 32 patients with GISTs fulfilled the criteria of Fletcher et al. (2002) . In addition to histological stainings, primary antibodies against vimentin, desmin, actins, S-100 protein and CD117 (all DakoCytomation) and CD 34 (Immunotech) were used for the immunoanalysis. Results Majority of the tumors was localized in the stomach (n=18) and small intestine (n=11), one in the colon and two were extragastrointestinal. In relation to the accepted MC and TS criterias, 16 of 32 cases were of low and one of very low risk category. 8 tumors belonged to intermediate risk category, mostly due to TS in contrast to low MC. The inclusion of 7 cases into high risk category was based predominantly on the MC (>5/50HPF and TS 5-10 cm /n=5/ and >10 cm /n=1/; in the last one it was >6-10/50HPF in contrast to TS <5 cm).

The amount, the activity (Western blot) and the localization (confocal microscopy) of the signal elements (Smads, phoshpo-Smad2, Erk1/2, JNK, p38MAPK) and other proapoptotic and survival proteins (Bcl-2, Blc-xL, Bid, Bax, Bad, NFkB, phospho-IkB) were also studied. The role of PP2A phosphatase, MEK1 kinase and caspase activity was estimated by different inhibitors (endhothal, okadaic acid, PD980559, Z-VAD-fmk, Z-IETD-fmk, Z-LEHD-fmk) in vitro. Results HT58 B cell lymphoma cells lost their sensitivity to the antiproliferative action of exogenous TGFb1, but the cells were killed by apoptosis. Smad2 phosphorylation, nuclear localization and the increased expression of TGFb1 induced early gene (TIEG) proved the rapid activation of Smad signal. The role of PP2A phosphatase activation followed by decreased expression of active phospho-JNK and phospho-Erk1/2 was supported by the antiapo-ptotic effect of PP2A inhibitors and the proapoptotic effect of specific MEK1 inhibitor. The Apoptosis was induced primarily through the mitochondrial pathway. It seems that both main iniciator caspases (caspase 8 and 9) took part in the apoptotic response. Conclusion These data suggest that exogenous TGFb1 had double but interrelated actions on HT58 cells: a) suppression the survival signals produced by protein kinases, which b) allowed the Smads to induce apoptosis. Therefore, it is possible that the lost sensitivity of malignant lymphoid cells to proapoptotic regulators (such as TGFb1) could be reactivated especially by lowering the survival threshold.

The stage of these tumors were stage I, 16%; stage II, 8%; stage III 18%; stage IV, 22%. The results show a higher intensity expression of the topo II alpha, and topo I indices, in the higher grade NHL. There appears to be a similar expression between the intermedium and indolent NHL. The survival indicates that the large cell NHL's show a higher response rate and better survival than the mixed or small cell type.

Numerical chromosomal changes and proliferative activity may be of importance to improve the prediction. Aims: Risk of the tumor progression with the assessment of Ki-67 antigen-positive cell count and ploidy status of chromosome 12. Materials and methods 44 patients with MCL characterized by t(11;14)(q13;q32) and by overexpression of cyclin D1.

Moreover, follicular lymphomas are the most common type of the low grade lymphomas. In Hungary they comprise about 15-20% of all the lymphomas but its occurrence shows increasing tendency. Our aim was to survey and revise FLs diagnosed in the last 10 years in the National Institute of Oncology. We studied the diagnostic relevance of histology, immunohistochemistry and the detection of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and bcl-2 gene rearrangements. Materials and methods We surveyed 52 cases which were diagnosed as follicular or centrocytic, centroblastic lymphoma before. After the histological re-examination immunohistochemistry (CD20, CD3, bcl-2, CD10, bcl-6, CD5, p53, cyclin D1 and Ki-67) was performed on each case. We studied the IgH and bcl-2 (MBR) gene rearrangement both with conventional and real-time PCR methods from the paraffin embedded blocks. The classification was made according to the new WHO classification. Results After the revision of the 52 cases we found 36 follicular, 11 diffuse large B-cell, 1 mantle cell and 1 marginal zone lymphoma, 2 paragranulomas and 2 follicular hyperplasias. The grade of the FLs showed relation to the expression of different antigens. CD10 and bcl-2 expression decreased with the grade. p53 expression was very rare and occurred only in grade 3 cases. The proliferation index with Ki-67 showed good correlation with the grade of FLs. The IgH showed 3 types of pattern: monoclonal, polyclonal and a sharp line in a polyclonal background. Grade 3 and grade 1-2 FLs were monoclonal almost in the same ratio. We could detect bcl-2 gene rearrangement in 55% of the FLs (72% grade1-2, 30% grade3). All the grade 3 cases which showed bcl-2 gene rearrangement belonged to grade 3a group while all the grade 3b cases were negative. Conclusion In agreement with others we found that grade 1, 2 and 3a FLs showed similar morphological, immunohistochemical and genetical features while gr3b FLs are more similar to diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Considering the diagnostic relevance of the different methods we can conclude that histology alone is not sufficient. 84% of our cases were solvable with the help of immunohistochemistry and in 10% of the cases the diagnosis based on the molecular pathological results. In the remaining 6 % even with the help of all diagnostic tools no unambiguous diagnosis could be reached.",

Case presentation We present a patient with diagnosed diffuse large B cell lymphoma of the maxillary sinus as well as involvement of the infraorbital region, who suffered from infective complications. 39-years old male was admitted at the Clinic of hematology because of tumor mass in nasal cavity. CT-scan showed tumor mass filling right maxillary sinus. Surgical biopsy was done. Histochemical and immunohisto-chemical findings suggested a diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Other clinical investigations showed I-E clinical stage. Treatment with four cycles of CHOP and Mab-Thera followed. After that adjuvant radiotherapy was delivered. Because of increased body temperature and meningeal symptoms, this therapy was interrupted. Microbiological investigations showed positive hemoculture for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and positive finding of Blastomyces in cerebrospinal fluid, while serological analyses revealed positivity for CMV and EBV. Beside severe antibiotic, antimycotic and antiviral treatment, the patient suffered from sepsis with main features of suppurative leptomeningitis and acute hepatitis. Conclusion This case implies the conclusion that the clinicians should have in mind the possible presence of immune disregulation in patients with NHL, that could complicate the administered chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Aberrant expression of genes regulating apoptosis/survival seems to be essential in the development of multiple myeloma. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunohistochemical expression apoptosisregulating proteins in bone marrow of patients with initially presented multiple myeloma. Methods The expression of bcl-2, mcl-1, bak, bax, CPP32 and PARP was examined on paraffin sections of 36 bone marrow biopsies obtained from equal number of patients with newly diagnosed MM, using commercially available monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and LSAB technique. Specimens containing >10% immunostained tumor cells were considered positive. Results Bcl-2, bak and bax positive immunostaining was detected in 94%, 100% and 94% of cases respectively. Most positive tumors showed high percentage of tumor cells immunoreactive for the above proteins: >50% for bcl-2, >80% for bak and >60% for bax. The mean value for bcl-2/bax ratio was 1.66, and the mean bcl-2/bak ratio was 0.95. Mcl-1 expression was detected in a small percentage of tumors (17%). Cytoplasmic expression of CPP32 was observed in 8,3% of cases and the number of positive cells was low. Nuclear expression of PARP was seen in 44,5% of cases and no association was found with the other apoptosis-related antigens, bcl-2/bax or bcl-2/bak ratio.

A higher immunoexpression of bcl-2 (78.5% vs 63.3%), mcl-1 (92.8% vs 80%), bax (92.8% vs 80%), p53 (92.8% vs 70%) and CPP32 (69.2% vs 60%) was observed in chemoresistant cases. PARR expression was higher in chemosensitive cases (93.3% vs 84.6%). In the p53-negative group of cases (14 cases) those with a strong (3+) PARP expression showed a significant better response to treatment (p = 0.0016). A significant chemosensitivity was also detected in the group (8 cases) with strong (3+) bax and weak (+) or negative (-) p53 immunostaining (p = 0.028). Conclusion Apoptosis-related proteins, though overexpressed in DLBCL, were not associated with response to treatment. A p53(-)/PARP(3+) or p53(+ or -)/bax(3+) tumor status may reflect sensitivity to chemotherapy.",

However, the progression of these diseases may be influenced by various others factors such as apoptosis, proliferation and angiogenesis. Aim: A possible correlation between Bcl-2 expression, apoptosis, disease outcome and overall survival in patients with NHL was analysed. Material and methods 72 NHL devided in low-(N=29) and highgrade (N=43) were immunohistochemicaly analysed for Bcl-2 expression, while 12 low-and 12 high-grade NHL were procesed for terminate TdT mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method in order to determine the apoptotic index of tumor cells. Results were obtained by image analyser and statistically processed. Results The expression of Bcl-2 protein, as an antiapoptotic marker was significantly higher in low-compared to high-grade NHL, p=0.024, whereas the apoptotic index obtained with the TUNEL method demonstrated inverse results, p<0.001. In highgrade NHL, partial remission was observed in patients whose tumors expressed significantly higher values of Bcl-2, (p=0.03), while complete remission was observed in a group with a lower expression of Bcl-2. Furthermore, patients with lower Bcl-2 expression showed longer overall survival p=0.02, whereas patients with a higher apoptotic index showed shorter survival, p<0.001. In both low and high-grade groups of NHL, Bcl-2 has been found as an independent predictor of patients disease relaps, p< 0.05. Conclusion The expression of Bcl-2 is a strong independent predictor of disease progression in NHL patients.",

ALCL was composed of large cells that grow in a diffuse pattern and involve the lymph node sinuses. The tumor cells have an abundant eosinophilic or pale cytoplasm. The nuclei were irregular with indentation, multilobated, round to oval. Multinucleated cells with wreath-like configurated nuclei were commonly seen. ALCL cells may closely resemble cells of malignant histiocytosis. Additional features include Reed-Sternberg-like cells, reactive infiltrate, partial lymph node involvement with localization of tumor cells in the paracortical region resembling Hodgkin's diseases. Tumor cells are CD30 +. The regular expression of CD30 antigen in both carcinoma and ALCL (both are anaplastic large cell tumors) has important implication for the differential diagnosis of these tumors. Leukocyte common antigen (CD45) positivity excludes an embryonal or any other non-hematopoietic tumor, but its absence does not rule out ALCL (a significant portion of ALCL are CD45 negative). Antibodies to cytokeratin label embryonal carcinoma but not ALCL. Thus, if cytokeratin is expressed in an anaplastic large cell tumor simultaneously with CD30 antigen, it is most likely to be an embryonal carcinoma Conclusion This study confirms the view that ALCL are heterogeneous group of lymphomas and the CD30 is a useful marker for the diagnosis.",

Aim of this study is immunohistochemical determination of lymph node cellular response in granulomatous sarcoidosis, pregranulomatous phase of sarcoidosis and reactive sinus histiocytosis using panel of antibodies. Materials and methods Patient groups under study, each contained 25 patients include those with clinical and histopathological picture of sarcoidosis; the group of patients with clinical picture of sarcoidosis and histologically detectable sinus histiocytosis without granuloma formation and finally, the group free of clinical suspicion of sarcoidosis with 'reactive' sinus histiocytois in lymph nodes.

It occurs mainly in adults associated either with an acute viral infection, or with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The latter are usually T-or NK-cell lymphomas. The present case concerns a patient with HPS followed by a large B-cell lymphoma showing only bone marrow involvement. This constellation is extremely rare in Western countries and has been reported mainly in Asia. The patient was a 60 year old male admitted for persistent fever. Peripheral blood examination showed pancytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy showed haemophagocytosis by proliferating macrophages often situated into dilated marrow sinusoids. No viral infection was detected. The patient was treated with haemopoietic growth factors and showed improvement. After 6 months his blood cell count began to fall again and a second bone marrow biopsy showed, apart from haemophagocytosis, a focal, mainly intrasinusoidal, infiltration by large B-cell lymphoma cells immunopositive for CD20 and CD45RA. Epstein-Barr virus RNA was not detected. Dissemination of lymphoma to other sites was not apparent. The patient was treated with 6 cycles of CHOP and Mab-Thera and showed remission. Some authors believe that these rare cases represent a peculiar \"Asian\" variant of intravascular lymphoma characterized by HPS and early involvement of bone marrow without dissemination to other organs. This variant has a poor prognosis and might constitute a distinct biological and clinical disease entity which merits separate consideration because of the problems posed in the initial diagnosis and therapeutic approaches. Introduction Mycosis fungoides is a mature T-cell lymphoma presenting in the skin and characterised by epidermal and dermal infiltration of small to medium size T-cell with cerebriform nuclei. It is a rare disease wich accounts for no more than 0,5% of all non Hodgkin lymphomas. Case report A 82 year-old man was refered to the Clinic of hematology because of the nodular red dermal tumours on the trunk. These lesions persisted for one year. The blood and bone marrow had not been involved. Lymph nodes were normal. The patient had the so called d' emblee lesions, presenting with skin tumours to 2 cm of diameter. The initial diagnostic lesions were rare limited patches and plaques. Extracutaneous dissemination did not occur. Formaldehyde fixed and paraffin embedded histological sections, taken from 4 surgically resected skin tumours, were stained with HE, Giemsa, trichrome and immunohistochemical stains. Morphology: Epidermotropic infiltrates consisted of medium size cells with cerebriform nuclei. A minority of larger cells with similar nuceli and with many mitotic figures also were present. So called Pautrier microabscesses consisted of aggregates of cerebriform cells in the epidermis (highly caracteristic for Mycosis fungoides) were numerous. In the dermis, infiltrates were band like and diffuse, associated with inflammatory infiltrate consisting of small lymphocytes and eosinophils. Conclusions In spite of the presence of bad prognostic factors (very old patients, extent of disease and tumorous form) he had a very indolent course of the disease. The role of the observed inflammatory small lymphocytes and eosinophils is probably very important for the excellent prognosis of mycosis fungoides in this patient.",

Results Overexpression of cyclins D3, E was found in 35/79 (43%) and 18/79 (22%) cases, respectively, whereas cyclin D1 was not detected. In 39/46 cases, overexpression of cyclins D3 and E was mutually exclusive, proposing different underlying pathways that induce deregulated expression of these cyclins. In 29/35 cases, cyclin D3 overexpression was equally exclusive with Rb/p16 aberrant expression status, supporting an oncogenic role for cyclin D3 and suggesting that pathogenetic effect of cyclin D3 overexpression occurs through perturbation of Rb1 pathway. Combined alterations of P53 and Rb/p16/cyclin D3 expression profile were significantly correlated to higher mean values of cyclins A (p=0.023) and B1 (p=0.033) indicating that concurrent impairment of p53 and Rb1 pathways induces increased tumor cell proliferation.

Results and conclusions Expression of bcl6, CD10 and bcl2 was detected in 54/79 (68%), 28/79 (35%) and 47/79 (63%) cases, respectively. The bcl6/CD10 patterns were as follows: bcl6+/ CD10+ (26 cases, 32%), bcl6+/CD10-(28 cases, 33%), bcl6-/CD10-(23 cases, 31%) and bcl6-/CD10+ (2 cases, 4%). Significantly positive correlations were found between bcl6/Ki67 (r=0.328, p=0.003), bcl6/cyclin A (r=0.265, p=0.018), bcl6/AI (r=0.327, p=0.010), CD10/Ki67 (r=0.296, p=0.008) and CD10/AI (r=0.397, p=0.001). High expression of bcl6 was correlated with null/low bcl2 expression (Hi-square-test, p=0.002). These findings indicate that increased expression of bcl6 and CD10 is associated with increased apoptosis and proliferation in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Association between increased bcl6 expression and enhanced apoptosis might be due to null/low bcl2 immunoreactivity, since previous in vitro data revealed that bcl6 overexpression induces apoptosis accompanied by bcl2 and bcl-xl downregulation. Significant correlation was found between increased AI and bcl6+/CD10+ pattern (T-test: p=0.014, Mann-Whitney test: p=0.046).

All 8 cases were classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) according to morphology and immunophenotype. Patohistological analyses showed markedly polymorphous cellular infiltrate with large cells with complex nuclear contours and multilobated nuclei, together with centroblasts-like cells and immunoblasts. All tumors were associated with some degree of fibrosis. Immunologic studies showed strong expression of pan-B markers and HLA-DR, weak expression of CD10 and cIg (mostly IgM) in half of tumors. BCL2 was positive in all cases as well as BCL6. The plasmacytic differentiation was observed in 1/3 of cases. The proliferative fraction was high, >50% cells in all patients. Conclusion Our analysis revealed that all PLB were of DLBCL type with characteristic morphology and immunophenotype. Further study will show the outcome of patients with PLB, as well as the validity of various prognostic parameters.",

Only 18 cases have been reported in the literature. We report an unusual case of PTCL showing perifollicular growth pattern with expression of CD10 and bcl-6. The patient was a 46-year-old male who presented with a generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, and weight loss. Hepatosplenomegaly and polyclonal gammopathy were not identified. Cervical lymph node biopsy was performed. The histology showed nodular effacement of nodal architecture with proliferation of atypical lymphoid cells which mainly infiltrate perifollicular area. Interfollicular area also showed proliferation of atypical lymphoid cells and high endothelial venules with a few immunoblasts and eosinophils. Neoplastic cells were medium-sized, with irregular nuclei and clear cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were CD3+CD4+CD5+CD8-CD10+CD30-CD57-bcl-2+bcl-6+, demonstrating helper/inducer T-cell origin. The CD10 was strongly expressed mainly in the perifollicular tumor cells, whereas the normal germinal center (GC) cells showed down-regulation of CD10. The distribution of CD10+ perifollicular tumor cells was closely related with CD21+ follicular dentritic cells (FDCs), suggesting CD10 up-regulation might be induced by the proliferating FDCs. TCR-gamma gene rearrangement using PCR-SSCP was monoclonal. This case could be classified as PTCL, unspecified, and should be discriminated from other lymphomas, including marginal zone B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Further studies are necessary to clarify the distinction of this tumor from angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma.",

Materials and methods all the patients (M:F 3:2, median age 17 years, range: 6-50), but 1 (with 2 simultaneous occurring skin lesions) presented with bone confined lymphoma (osteolytic lesions of jaw, rib, sternum, iliac and pelvic bones). Biopsies from all cases were analysed. Results and conclusion according to the WHO lymphoma classification, all cases were CD30+ ALCLs (4/5 common type, 1/5 small cell predominant variant). Lymphoma population showed a T (2/5) or \"null\" (3/5) phenotype, expressed cytotoxic associated molecules (TIA1, granzyme B and/or perforin); CD246/ALK was positive in 4/5 cases, whereas 1/5 expressed CD56. TCR-gamma clonal rearrangement was detected in 3/5 cases. All patients received polychemotherapy; at last follow up they all are alive, in complete remission (mean: 35 months, range: 5-132). In our cases, the morphofunctional features of the lymphoma population were similar to their nodal counterparts, including CD246 expression in the younger patients. On such bases, the hypothesis must be considered that primary bone CD30+ ALCLs represent the first extranodal site of presentation of a systemic disease. In contrast with similar reported series, our patients run a favourable prognosis and in the single positive case, CD56 expression does not negatively influence outcome. However, larger series of similar cases must be analysed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.",

FDC also interact with the neoplastic lymphoid proliferations. In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (B-CLL/SLL), FDC structures are reduced. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence and patterns of follicular dendritic cells B-CLL/SLL using several anti-FDC antibodies. Materials and methods 50 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lymph nodes diagnosed as B-CLL/SLL according to the WHO criteria were studied using CD21, CD23, and CNA.42 antibodies after microwave oven antigen retrieval Results In 17 cases (34%) FDC meshworks were identified in none of the reactions. In 15 specimens (30%), FDC meshworks were exceptionally rare as follicle remnants at the lymph node periphery or as small irregular clusters not reminding of the normal follicle meshwork. In 18 cases (36%) FDC formed either frequent small irregular clusters, or rings at the follicle periphery, or regular follicular meshworks. Reticular structures in a given case were most frequent in CNA.42 stain, scarcer in anti-CD21, and anti-CD23 stains. The majority of cases showing FDC was obtained by CNA.42 (33 cases), CD21 (22 cases) and CD23 (16 cases). Conclusion FDC structures were absent or scarce in up to 64% of B-CLL/SLL cases which can be used as an auxilliary diagnostic criterion. The positive cases showed small irregular clusters, rings at the follicle periphery, or normal follicular meshworks. Best results were obtained with CNA.42 antibody.

            "text": "Inroduction Bone marrow angiogenesis has been recently implicated in the pathophysiology and course of various haematological malignancies. Little is known, however, about the significance of this phenomenon in hairy cell leukaemia (HCL). Methods We evaluated various morphometric characteristics of microvessels, highlighted by means of anti-CD34 immunohistochemistry, in the bone marrow of 44 patients with typical HCL, before and after treatment with interferon-\u03b1. Overall 104 bone marrows from HCL patients and twenty control bone marrows were examined. Microvessel density (MVD) and several size-and shape-related parameters were quantitated in the region of most intense vascularization using image analysis. Results MVD, size-related parameters and the percentage of branching microvessels were higher in HCL than in controls and in partial/non-responders in comparison to complete responders. Acvievement of complete response was accompanied by smaller calibre microvessels. Interferon-\u03b1 induced a decrease in MVD and branching values in cases with diffuse marrow involvement. In univariate analysis, progression-free survival was adversely affected by MVD and branching. Multivariate analysis indicated that factors related to the size of the microvessels and MVD/ branching independently affected progression-free survival. MVD/ branching was also related to the likelihood of complete response. Conclusions Our data suggest that the generation of bone marrow microvessels connotes an increased risk for progression and interferon-\u03b1 treatment failure in HCL. Furthermore the prognostic significance of angiogenesis requires the concomitant assessment of MVD, the size of microvessels and the complexity of the microvascular network. Key words: Hairy cell leukaemia, bone marrow, angiogenesis, morphometry Introduction Inflammatory pseudotumors are uncommon and enigmatic benign lesions which may develop at several anatomical sites and recent studies demonstrated the frequent presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in them. The occurence of inflammatory pseudotumor in the spleen is rare. A case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen is presented and its relationship to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is examined. Material and method The case was a 62-year-old woman in whom a solitary splenic mass was discovered as part of the workup of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Splenectomy was performed. Results Grossly, the removed spleen, weighing 140 g, contained a tan-white, circumscribed mass, measuring 4.5X4X4 cm. Microscopically, the mass was composed of a heterogeneous cellular population of acute and chronic inflammatory cells. Plasma cells predominated, but lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, interlacing fibroblast-like spindle cells and rare multinuclear giant cells were found. Amorphous, acidophilic material was present focally with the plasma cell proliferation. Plasma cells presented light chains polyclonality. Lymphoid cells were mature and mainly of T-lineage. Spindle cells exhibited histiocyte phenotype (CD68+++). Immunohistochemical stain for EBV was negative. Conclusions Inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen is a benign tumorous lesion that has been described in only a few cases in the world literature (<75 cases). Its etiology and pathogenesis is unknown and association EBV is not always present. Recognition of this rare entity is important, as the clinical manifestations and imaging features could be indistinguishable from a lymphoproliferative disorder or another malignancy of the spleen. Introduction The diagnosis of nodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in Montenegro has been done only in Clinical Center of Montenegro -incidence of diagnosed NHL can be considered as the incidence in epidemiological sense.The use of monoclonal antibodies since 1997, has improved our ability to diagnose and to treat NHL. Aims: By revision of immunohistologically diagnosed cases of NHL between 1997-2003, we wanted to estimate (a) the frequency of particular clinico-pathological types of NHL, (b) hypothesis about geo-socio-economic influences on patterns of NHL, and (c) the influence of immunophenotypisation of NHL on speciffic chemo-and immunotherapy. Materials and methods NHLs were diagnosed with the use of HE, Giemsa, MGP, PAS, Gomori, LCA, bcl2, TdT, CD3, CD43, CD20, CD79a, CD15, CD30, and EMA stained slides and classified according to the Working Formulation criteria. Results Between '97 and '03 we diagnosed 116 NHL. Low, intermediate and high grade malignancy comprised 33,6 %, 50,9 % and 15,5 % respectively. The highest incidence was estimated in 1999:1,5/100000. The NHLs of FCC origin constitute 60,3% of all our NHLs. In 80% of patients (25) low grade malignant NHLs were highly CD20+. Nine patients recieved Mabthera+CHOP/or +COP therapy during the last three years.All patients have been in remision. Conclusion The estimated pattern of NHL -the most frequent NHL derivated from FCC-is comparable with geographic and socio-economic description of Montenegro as ''underdeveloped, ecological, farming European country''.The high frequency of CD20+ and initial therapeutical results indicate future prospective patho-clinical studies of this issue. I Oehri, M Baumann, G Cathomas Kantonales Institute for Pathology, Liestal, Switzerland Background The multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) is a lymphoproliferative disease with increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In AIDS patients, MCD is usually associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), the infectious agent of Kaposi's sarcoma but in contrast to Kaposi's sarcoma, HHV8 infected cells in MCD show evidence of lytic viral infection. Similar to other immunosuppression-associated lymphoproliferative diseases it has been suggested that anti-CD20 antibodies may be useful in the therapy of these lesions. Aim of the present study was the analysis of CD 20 expression in HHV8 associated MCD and their association with lytic viral infection. Material and methods Formalin fixed, paraffin embeded lymph nodes were analyzed by a double immunofluorescence assay using antibodies against viral proteins and CD20. HHV8 proteins which were analyzed include the latent viral protein LANA (ORF 73) and the viral interleukin 6 (vIL-6) and the ORF74, both associated with lytic HHV8 infection. Results Eleven lymph nodes of seven HIV-infected patients with MCD were analyzed. In the mantle zone of the lymphoid follicle, 8,4%, 2,8% and 1% of cells show positivity for LANA, vIL-6 and ORF74, respectively (p < 0,02). By double immunofluorescence, 91% of HHV8 infected cells showed co-expression of LANA/vIL-6 and LANA/vORF74 and 96% showed co-expression of LANA/vIL-6, respectively. In addition, there was statistical significant correlation between vIL-6 and LANA as well as vIL-6 and vORF74 (p < 0,01). Of the HHV8 infected cells, 6,5% showed CD20 expression and no difference between the three viral proteins analyzed were observed (5,5%, 7,4%, 6,6% of LANA, vIL-6 and vORF 74, respectively). Conclusion The present data support the concept that HHV8 runs, in contrast to Kaposi's sarcoma, through a lytic viral infection in lymph nodes of patients with MCD. However, only a small subset of infected cells show co-expression of CD20, independent of the state of viral replication. This small number of infected cells expressing CD20 indicate little effect of anti-CD20 therapy. Based on the evidence of lytic HHV8 infection, however, anti-viral drugs inhibiting HHV8 replication may be more efficient.",

ALCL is a very rare NHL (about 5%), with the systemic-aggressive variant, and the cutaneous variant. The presence of the t(2;5) and the formation of ALK protein identified one subgroup of ALCL with a good prognosis. The aim of our study is to analyze the histopathological and immunohistochemical characters of the ALCL diagnosed in our department in the last 2 years. 15 cases of T and null ALCL (M/F=12/3, more half of them younger of 30 years) were clinical and immunohistochemical analyzed (by ABC indirect methods, with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies). The pattern of lymph node infiltration was diffuse (9 cases), parafollicular (5 cases) and only with sinus infiltration -1 case. The pathological subtypes were common (7 cases), lymphohistiocytic (4 cases), small cell variant (1 case), sarcomatous (1 case), eosinophils-rich (1 case) and neutrophil-rich (1 case). Immunohistochemically, the malignant cells presented with T-fenotype (7 cases) and null (7 cases); 1 case (M, 17 y) presents histiocyte markers (CD68+CD30+EMA+ALK+). All cases of ALCL were CD30+, but only 13 cases were EMA+ (2 cases were CD45RO+CD30+ALK-EMA-). 2/3 of cases were ALK+ (5-T and 5-null), with a nuclear and a membranous pattern. 5 cases were BNH9+ (4 cases ALK+). Only 1 case presented CD15 expression(CD30+EMA+ALK+BNH9+). 2 of the cases with T fenotype expressed CD4 markers (both were CD4+CD8-). The PCNA and Ki67 proliferation markers were positive in a very large percent of the malignant cells (between 30 and 80%). Numerous reactive T-lymphocytes presented a helper fenotype (CD4>CD8), and Leu-7+ cells were very rare. The null and T-cell ALCL pose numerous problems of differential diagnosis and immunohistochemicals methods are very useful for diagnosis and prognosis of these NHL.",

Rarely, MS may represent the first sign of blastic transformation of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD). The aim of this study is to present our experience in the diagnosis of MS. In the last 7 years, we diagnosed 9 cases of MS (M/F=4/5, between 18 and 66 year-old, with 50,2 years median). A large panel of monoclonal antibodies (lymphoid and myeloid cell markers) was used for the diagnosis of MS and for the differential diagnosis with NonHodgkin Lymphomas (NHL). The tumor localizations were: lymph nodes (5 cases, including a bulky inguinal tumor), lymph node and skin (1 case), paravertebral (2 cases), testis (1 case). In our cases, 2 patients presented with MS before the AML diagnosis (F, 26y, paravertebral MS, 10 months before AML-M3, and M, 57y, 15 years after NHL diagnosis, presented with an inguinal lymph node MS, 6 months before AML-M4). In 3 cases, MS was diagnosed simultaneously with AML (AML-M2; AML-M3; AML-M4), and in 2 cases after AML (m, 34y, MS with testis localization, 3 years after AML-M3; F, 66y, lymph node and skin MS, 6 years afterAML-M4). In one case (F, 66y), 6 years after successful treatment of an acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the patient presented with a lymph node MS, considered as a blastic transformation of a chronic myelo-monocytic leukaemia (CMML). The diagnosis of MS may be very difficult if this tumor precedes the myeloid proliferative disorders, and the differential diagnosis with NHL may pose a lot of problems. Introduction B-PLL is an infrequent disease, considered by the WHO lymphoma classification as an aggressive condition and characterized by the presence of B symptoms, massive splenomegaly without significant lymphadenopaty and peripheral lymphocytosis with more than 55% prolymphocytes. Herein we report 2 cases of B-PLL to show the wide clinical and genotypic spectrum of this disease. Case reports Patient 1. A 51-year old male with a history of petechiae and ecchymoses of 1 year evolution. A CBC showed significant lymphocytosis with >55% prolymphocytes. Physical examination revealed an enlarged cervical lymph node and splenomegaly. Lymph node biopsy was diagnosed as infiltration by B-PLL (CD20+, CD79a+, IgM+, CD5-, CD23-, CD43-and cyclin D1-). A bone marrow biopsy showed infiltration by B-PLL. Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow showed a Burkitt's variant translocation t(2;8) (p12;q24) Molecular analysis of the lymph node showed IgH rearrangement and germline bcl-2 and bcl-1 by PCR. He was treated with four cycles of fludarabine (25 mg/m2) and rituximab (500 mg/m2) and is in clinical and cytogenetic remission at 1 year of follow-up. Patient 2. A 54-year old female with a 2 month history of multiple cervical lymph node enlargement and fever. Physical examination was normal and she had no lymphocytosis on the CBC. Lymph node biopsy showed infiltration by a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with a prolymphocytic morphology (CD20+, CD79a+, IgM+, CD5-, CD23-, CD43-and cyclin D1-). Bone marrow biopsy showed focal infiltration by B-PLL. Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow revealed a normal female cariotype and normal FISH patterns were found for the following probes: chormosome 8 centromere, 8q24 (c-myc), chromosome 12 centromere, 13q14 (D13S319), 14q32.33 (IgH) and 17p13.1 (p53). She was initially treated with CHOP and then switched to fludarabine having achieved a good clinical response after one cycle each. Discussion. The association between B-PLL and translocation t(2;8) (p12;q24) has been reported in very few cases, however direct involvement of c-myc alterations affecting specifically 8q24 has been proposed as an important factor in the pathogenesis of B-PLL. In patient 1, the observed genetic alterations could be of significance to define the genetic spectrum of B-PLL. Case 2 corresponds to a B-cell prolymphocytic lymphoproliferation with isolated lymph node involvement and no leukemic component. To our knowledge this presentation has not been reported previously and it is not considered in WHO classification. Morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of this case are fully compatible with a B-PLL. Even though it has been considered that some cases of B-PLL could in fact represent a morphological variant of mantle cell lymphoma, in this case the negativity for CD5 and cyclin D1 partially rule out this possibility. Bcell prolymphocytic lymphoproliferations constitute an heterogeneous group of disorders in which c-myc rearrengement can be present. In this group of neoplasia therefore, the nodal involvement can be either predominant or the only clinical manifestation, thus we propose to consider the term B-cell prolymphocytic lymphoma/ leukemia instead of B-PLL to denote these disorders. Background ALCL is a particular type of T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma originally characterized by a peculiar morphology and the consistent expression of CD30. This entity is frequently associated with the translocation t(2;5) (p23;q35) or some of its variants resulting in the overexpression of the chimeric protein NPM/ALK (ALK+), even though in the current classification ALK-negative cases are also considered within this group. EBV is classically and constantly associated with certain specific types of lymphoma but its association with ALCL is not considered a characteristic feature of this disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of the ALCL-EBV association in a population of adult mexican patients. Results Eighteen patients with a morphological and immunohistochemical diagnosis of ALCL with nodal involvement were included. Immunohistochemical and ISH analysis was performed for CD3, CD43, CD45RO, CD45RB, CD20, CD30, CD15, EMA, LMP-1, ALK.and EBER1. Mean age was 45 years and the male-tofemale ratio was 1.2:1. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization results are summarized in the next table. All the so considered EBV positive cases expressed LMP-1 and EBER 1.",

The high incidence of ALK-/EBV+ cases 9/18 (50%), with morphological and immunophenotypical characteristics of ALCL gives rise to the possibility that this is a different subset of T-cell lymphomas with anaplastic morphology in which EBV plays a pivotal roll in the oncogenesis and evolution. These disorders have been considered so far to be ALCL /ALKlymphomas. The high incidence of EBV infection in Mexico leads to the development of peculiar lymphoid proliferations as well as associations (EBV/ALCL) different from those considered to be frequent in world literature.",

Its cyclin partners are members of the family of Cyclin T (T1, T2a and T2b) and cyclin K. CDK9/Cyclin T1 complex is very important in the differentiation program of several cell types, controlling specific differentiative pathways. Limited data are available regarding the expression of CDK9/Cyclin T1 in haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. The aim of this paper is to analyze the expression of CDK9/Cyclin T1 complex in lymphoid tissue, in order to assess its role in B and T cell differentiation and lymphomagenesis. In reactive lymph nodes CDK9/Cyclin T1 expression was found by immunohistochemistry in germinal center and in B and T cell blasts in interfollicular areas, suggesting a role for CDK9 in the activation and differentiation of B and T cells. The staining of CDK9 and cy-clinT1 complex in malignant lymphomas seems to reflect their normal counterpart, as it is highly expressed in lymphomas derived from germinal center cells, such as follicular lymphomas and classical Hodgkin's lymphomas and from activated T cells, (i.e. anaplastic large cell lymphomas). Diffuse large B-cell and Burkitt's lymphomas showed a wide range of values. No expression of CDK9 and Cyclin T1 was detected in marginal zone and mantle cells lymphomas. However, at RNA level we found an imbalance in CDK9/Cyclin T1 ratio in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphomas with germinal center phenotype, and in the cell lines of classical Hodgkin's lymphomas, Burkitt's lymphomas and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, in comparison with reactive lymph nodes.",

            "text": "Introduction Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is a chronic lymphoproliferative disease characterized by the presence of neoplastic B cells with hairy cytoplasmic projections in spleen, bone marrow and peripheral blood. Complete or near-complete remission can be achieved by recent chemotherapy protocols. These treatment methods are quite different from the chemotherapy protocols used for the treatment of other lymphoproliferative diseases. An absolute and correct diagnosis, i.e. detection of HCL cells by specific methods, is necessary for the achievement of complete or near-complete remission by special chemotherapy programs. Detecting intracytoplasmic tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) enzyme activity in the peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirates is a classical, simple, sensitive and quite specific method for the detection of HCL cells and in the diagnosis of HCL. However, this method is insufficient in some cases. For example, the most of the HCL patients are leukopenic and there are a few number of neoplastic cells in their peripheric blood. An adequate number of neoplastic cells cannot be obtained by bone marrow aspiration because of the increase in reticulin fibbers of the bone marrow. In such cases, bone marrow trephine biopsy is almost the only and the most important method in diagnosis and follow-up of this disease. Specific detection of TRAP enzyme activity in bone marrow trephine biopsy materials is not possible because of the effect of tissue fixation and processing on these materials. In conclusion, a new method for detecting TRAP enzyme activity in bone marrow trephine biopsy materials and for conforming the diagnosis of HCL is needed. A recently developed anti-TRAP antibody has been started to be used as an immunohistechemical marker in the diagnosis of HCL. The aim of this study was to investigate the specificity and the sensitivity of anti-TRAP antibody immunoreactivity in bone marrow trephine biopsy materials in the diagnosis of HCL. Material and methods We divided the cases into two groups; a study and control group. The study group included the cases diagnosed as HCL by clinical, haematological and histopathological investigations. The cases in the control group were the cases characterised by non-HCL neoplastic or reactive lymphoid infiltrations, which raised the suspicion of HCL in the differentia l diagnosis. Immunohistochemical staining techniques were applied to paraffin block sections of biopsy materials with anti-TRAP antibody. Results and conclusion We found that there is a statistically highly significant difference between TRAP immunoreactivities of the study and the control groups, and HCL can be diagnosed by TRAP immunoreactivity in the bone marrow trephine biopsy materials with the specificity of 98,27 % and with the sensitivity of 100 %.",

The enzyme is capable to degrade the main components of the intercellular matrix. Aims: 1. To determine the participation of cathepsin L in collagen degradation in liver and to reveal the intracellular and/or extracellular localization of the enzyme activity. 2. To determine which cells of fibrotic liver are sources of cathepsin L. Methods Biochemically cathepsin L activity and hidroxyproline level was determined in normal, CCl4-induced fibrotic rat liver and at 7, 14, 21, 30, 60 days after discontinuation of treatment. The activity of cathepsin L in fibrotic rat liver at the 7th and 21st days was investigated electron-histochemically. CBZ-Phe-Arg-4MBNA (Bachem) served as the substratum. Results Biochemically in fibrotic liver an increase of cathepsin L activity as compared with normal liver was revealed. During fibrosis regression the maximums of enzymatic activity at the 7th day (170%) and at the 21st day (155%) after cessation of CCl4-treatment were fixed. At the 14th day of recovery some diminution of cathepsin L activity was noted. At the 60th day after toxin abolition enzyme activity was close to control. A close correlation between cathepsin L activity and liver hidroxyproline level was found. Electron-histochemically reaction product was revealed in the Kupffer cells and fibroblast phagolysosomes containing fragments of collagen fibrils. We also found extracellular localization of cathepsin L in both terms of investigation. The reaction product was noted on the hepatocyte, Kupffer cell and fibroblast plasmalemma and on adjacent collagen fibrils. Conclusions Cathepsin L is directly implicated in collagen resorbtion during liver fibrosis regression. Detected extracellular activity of cathepsin L suggests that in addition to the intracellular proteolysis, cathepsin L is secreted by hepatocytes, macrophages and fibroblasts in intercellular space and can take part in extracel-lular collagen degradation. Ryvnyak Victor Laboratory of Morphology \"Nicolae Testemitanu\" State University of Medicine and Pharmacy Bd. Stefan cel Mare, 165 Kishinev, MD-2004 Moldova victorrivneac@yahoo.com Introduction The solitary necrotic nodule (NNS) of the liver is an uncommon lesion with a round appearance near the surface of the liver, with a dense collar of hyalinised collagen surrounding a necrotic core. Case reports We present three cases of NNS. Two patients underwent surgery to remove liver metastasis. We suggest a relationship with the previous hepatic surgery and with the microwave tissue coagulator. The other case have an history of abdominal traumatism by a seizure. The radiological image of NNS was misinterpreted as a tumor and the diagnosis by FNAC or frozen section could not exclude a metastasis. The potential risk of a malignant secondary tumour existed, and that was why limited liver resection was recommended. Several pathogenetic mechanisms have been avocated (infection, parasitic, traumatic, ischaemic, post chirurgical, iatrogenic, etc.) , all of them having an identical morfological appearance. Conclusion NNS is a rare non-tumorous lesion that might be misinterpreted as a tumor. The correct diagnosis can only be histological. It is important to differentiate the NNS from metastases due to the great influence on the treatment.",

Semi quantitative methods are currently regarded as a routine diagnostic procedure. But it is obvious that these methods are subjective. Morphometrical analysis with calculation of fibrosis index (FI) is an alternative method of evaluation. The aim of the study was to compare data obtained after morphometrical analysis of collagen formation to semi quantitative methods results and find out accordance with fibrosis stage. Materials and methods Liver biopsies from 42 CHC patients were used. We applied V.J.Desmet (1994) semi quantitative method and software SigmaScan Pro 5.0 for morphometrical analysis of sections. All sections were stained by Masson Trichrome method for the detection of collagen. Fibrosis index (FI) was calculated as collagen area divided all section area. Results 54,5% of patients had clinically significant level of liver fibrosis (Desmet F2, F3, F4). F1 Desmet stage was corresponding FI 0,01-0,02, F2 Desmet (moderate fibrosis) -FI 0,03-0,06 and high level of fibrosis (F2 and F3) -IF 0,07-0, 3. 15/42 cases (35,7%) showed differences between semi quantitative and morphometrical results. Four patients (9,5%) without fibrosis by semi quantitative methods showed IF corresponding moderate fibrosis (F2). Conclusion Our results suggest that morphometrical analysis is beneficial in the evaluation of fibrosis stage and should be used for prognosis and monitoring the course of chronic viral hepatitis.",

This type of liver injury can be mimicked in a mouse model by feeding 3, . After 2 months of DDC intoxication mouse livers revealed ballooned hepatocytes containing numerous Mallory bodies. Within four weeks of recovery from intoxication most Mallory bodies disappear but rapidly reappear within three days of reintoxication indicating the existence of a toxic memory effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular basis of the toxic memory effect. Materials and methods cDNA-libraries were generated from normal and DDC-intoxicated mouse livers by subtractive suppressive hybridization. These gene libraries were used to produce cDNA-arrays for expression profiling. RNA was isolated from mouse livers at different stages of intoxication, recovery and reintoxication and hybridized to the cDNA-arrays. Expression profiles were analysed by Genesight-and Imagene software. Results and conclusion Results obtained demonstrated several groups of genes differently expressed in short-term intoxicated naive and reintoxicated mice. These genes comprised Cyp2A5 as well as genes involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress and methionine metabolism. The sustained elevated level of Cyp2A5 during recovery and the enhanced induction upon reintoxication could explain why certain drugs lead to enhanced liver toxicity upon repeated administration even after long drug-free intervals.",

Histological activity in paired liver specimens was assessed by Knodell modified score. Fibrosis was evaluated according to Ishak staging system. In addition, fibrosis was quantified in Masson trichrome stained sections using morphometric image analysis. Interferon-alpha (mean dose 495 ME) and Ribavirin were administered for 6 to 18 months. Patients were classified as complete sustained responders (n=8), relapsed after therapy cessation (n=3) and \"non-responders\" (n=11).

They cause difficulties in distinguishing between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocellularcarcinoma (CC). Meanwhile, recent progression of study on hepatocyte-diffrentiation has revealed that both mature hepatocyte and biliary epithelial cell should originate from the common cell lineage called as hepatic-progenitor-cell (HPC), bipolar-cell (BC) and/or intermediate-hepatocyte-like-cells. Thus, we performed immunohistochemical analysis for HCC and CC using markers supposed to indicate respective levels of differentiation of the hepatic cell lineage, in order to identify the origin of the tumors particular in the diagnostically problematic cases. Materials and method Surgical specimens of 21 cases of HCC and 7 cases of CC were used. Ordinary immunohistochemical staining was performed with following antibodies; hepatocyte monoclonal antigen (Hep), c-kit, CK7, CK19 and CK20. The results were compared from the view of the histopathological findings and immunohistochemical reactions. Results Rate of positive (>50%) and focal positive (>5%) were Hep; HCC 76%, CC 29%, c-kit; HCC 17%, CC 44% and CK19; HCC 23%, CC; 100%. CK7 and CK20 were similar as previously reported. In addition noteworthily, double positive for Hep and ckit was observed on two cases of CC having apparent glandular formation. Conclusions 1) HCC had a lower positive rate for Hep compared with previous reports. 2) CC with positivity for Hep might exist. 3) According to the c-kit staining pattern, we considered that there might be a peculiar variant of tumor cells in CC differentiating both hepatocyte and biliary epithelial cell.",

The aim of this study was to establish morphological changes in the liver during starvation with particular emphasis on mobilization of the liver energy reserves. Material and methods The liver was examined after food deprivation periods of one, four and eighteen months, respectively using light and transmission electron microscopy. Glycogen and proteins concentrations were determined spectrofotometrically. Total fat in the liver was estimated by Folch method. Results Intense depletion of glycogen was present during first month of starvation. The glycogen wasn't formed in clumps typical for normal liver tissue. After eighteen months of fasting glycogen was re-synthesized, dense glycogen deposits appeared. Lipid droplets were less condensed. Numerous peroxisomes formed clusters with small and round mitochondria. Particular mitochondria increased in size and lost cristae. Lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles were numerous, too. Dilated intercellular space included electron dense granular material. Conclusions Carbohydrate and lipid reserves in the liver of Proteus serve for metabolic needs during food deprivation.

Results In PB, 80% of patients have T lymphocyte CD8+ decreased and 65% of them have augmented values of T lymphocytes CD4+. In liver biopsy the prevalent subpopulation were CD4+ cell, being approximately twice higher than CD8+ cells. The observed histological lesions were quantified by Ishak score as moder-ate\\severe chronic hepatitis.

Aims: The percentage of proliferative (PI) and apoptotic cells (AI) in HCC compared to non-tumor liver was investigated. The role of unprocessed as well as active form of caspase-3, which is an important apoptotic protein was of great interest for this study. Expression of survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis was investigated, too. Material and methods Twenty patients with HCC were included in the study. Two samples were obtained from each patient, one of HCC and one of the surrounding non-tumor liver. MIB-1 antibody was used to determine the proliferative activity. Immunohistochemical staining for the detection of active form of caspase-3 was used to determine the percentage of apoptotic cells and for detection of procaspase-3 and survivin expression, as well. Results AI was higher in HCC (1,532 \u00b1 1,05) compared to nontumor liver (0,426 \u00b1 0,62), but the proliferative activity in HCC was much higher than apoptotic activity. 75% of HCC showed positive staining for pro-caspase 3. Positive correlation between expression of pro-caspase 3 and active form of caspase 3 proved to be statistically significant. 70% of HCCs were survivin positive. Stronger expression of survivin was detected in HCC compared to non-tumor liver. Positive correlation between survivin expression and the grade of tumor diferentiatiation as well as a significant association between survivin expression and both AI and PI was also detected. Conclusion Our results indicate that survivin promoting cell proliferation in HCC has an important role in HCC progression.",

Since there is little information about ofloxacin side effect on liver of rat embryo. This preliminary study was planed to see what kind of changes occurs in development of liver in Rat embryo. The aim of present study was to determine the histopathological effects of offloading on liver of rat embryo. Material and methods Fourty nine Wistar rats were selected and randomly divided into two groups; control (n=21) and test (n=28). The test group has been received 14mg/kg (PO) Ofloxacin daily during pregnancy. However, the control group just received plate. After delivery, liver tissue of neonatal in both groups were taken and prepared for light microscopy. Staining method was H&E. Results Microscopic study of liver tissue specimens showed that in the test group hepatocytes were vesiculated. Degeneration and vacuolated pycnotic nuclei were seen when compared to control group. Weight of neonatal in test group was reduced when it was compared with the control group (P<0.05). Conclusion Since Ofloxacin had side effects on liver of rat embryo, it is not suggested to be used during pregnancy in human.",

The extremely poor prognosis of HCC and the limited value of the current standard clinical markers underscore the need for improvent of diagnosis and treatment of this deadly disease. Aims: We performed gene expression profiling using cDNA microarrays in order to identify novel molecular markers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of HCC. Material and methods We used the method of subtractive suppressive hybridization (SSH) to generate cDNA libraries that are highly enriched with clones representing genes both up-and downregulated in the diseased liver tissue. The expression pattern of 4600 clones representing ~ 4000 genes was analyzed in 26 surgically resected hepatocellular carcinomas, 4 focal nodular hyperplasias, one adenoma, and 6 cirrhotic livers by competetive hybridization on custom made cDNA microarrays using a pool of non-neoplastic human liver as reference. The expression data were verified independently by quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan). Results We found 500 genes which were consistently deregulated in more than one third of the HCCs under investigation. Of these, 250 genes had been previously implicated in HCC, whereas 210 known genes as well as 40 novel genes (with unknown function) had not yet been linked with liver cancer. Conclusions The present study revealed a number of genes specifically deregulated in hepatocelluar carcinoma. Future work will aim to evaluate the medical relevance of the encoded proteins which will ultimately help to identify potential new markers for better diagnosis/ prognosis of HCC and new targets for therapeutic intervention.",

Aim: To study the clinical characteristics of patients with actinomycosis, with regard to clinical history, presentation, method of diagnosis and comparing to the literature. Patients and methods From January 2000 to July 2002, a retrospective review was performed on all cases of histologically proven actinomycosis. Results Ten patients were studied, 5 men and 5 women, 5-65 years old. Two patients had a history of surgical procedures and/or dental manipulations. Two patients had a long history of diabetes mellitus. Locations were the liver (patient n 1), the feet articulation (patient n 2), the lung (patient n 3), the jugular lymph node (patient n 4), the skin (patients n 5 and 6), mandibular (patient n 7), the psoas muscle (patient n 8), the appendix (patient n 9) and the large bowel (patient n 10). Three patients showed a tumoral presentation (patients n 3, 8 and 10) and two patients had a tuberculosis disease presentation (patients n 2 and n 4). The patient n 9 had a clinical presentation of an inflammatory large bowel disease. One patient was diagnosed by cultures positive to A. israelii on microbiologic study and the others patients by surgical biopsy and detection of an actinomycosic granuloma. Special stains were used in all cases. Three patients received the classic initial regimen of iv. Conclusion Actinomycosis is an uncommon disease in our country. In these cases gastrointestinal locations were predominant. Two uncommon locations were present. There was no IUD associated infection.

The risk of encountering tuber-culosis at autopsy has fallen with the decreased incidence of the disease and greater emphasis has been placed recently on the hazards of viral diseases. However, tuberculosis may still be found at autopsy. The aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis at autopsy in a large general hospital setting. Methods Retrospective search of the autopsy records from 1991-2000. The patient record and histological slides were reviewed. The quantity of mycobacteria was assessed from the Ziehl-Neelson stains as scanty, moderate or abundant. Results 13 cases of active Mycobacterium tuberculosis were identified in the 10-year period in which 3740 autopsies were performed (1 per 374 autopsies) of which 10 cases were unsuspected (77%). These included 7 cases of miliary tuberculosis and 2 with pulmonary infection. 3 cases contained abundant organisms.

The definite causes of these tumors are not known. Aims: Based on tumor material from Africa, we search for possible cancerogenic agents and its pathogenetical interaction in conjunctival carcinoma. Materials and methods Conjunctival specimens of 68 patients from three African centers with the following histological lesions were examined: papilloma (1 case), pinguecula (5), conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (8 CIN I, 12 CIN II, 18 CIN III), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, 24 cases). Immunohistological reactions for p53 and p16 were done. 23 of 38 tested patients were HIV positive. Results and conclusion 39 of the 44 benign and precancerous lesions were associated with histological signs of a solar damage. 62 of the 68 cases showed immunohistologically an overexpression of p53, among them all SCC. This finding might indicate a p53 mutation as mostly seen in solar induced skin cancer too. 50% of the cases with CIN III and SCC had an overexpression of p16. Corresponding findings are known from transformed or neoplastic cervical epithelium in strong correlation with an active HPV (type 16,18) oncogene expression. No significant differences occurred between HIV positive and HIV negative cases in comparison to the frequency of different histological lesions as well as the p53 and p16 expression. The average manifestation age for CIN III and SCC in HIV positive cases (30 resp. 38 years) was 20 years lower than that of HIV negative cases (51 resp. 58 years).

While the exact pathogenesis remains elusive, it is acknowledged that the interrelationship of host and agent factors is fundamental. We describe the clinicopathological features of a rare and particularly mutilating case of delayed onset post traumatic craniofacial botryomycosis. Methods An immunocompetent 57-year-old Black male presented with multiple sinuses draining granules involving the frontal, parietal, orbital and maxillary areas. Nodulo-fibrous thickening was also present. This had evolved over a three-year period. Apart from the history of a head injury requiring cranioplasty 27 years earlier, no other predisposing factors were found. Results The diagnostic features of clumped bacteria (cloxacillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus), Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon, granulomata and intense fibrosis were confirmed histologically. There was no response to intravenous cloxacillin and the patient died before surgical debridement could be done. Conclusion This case report serves to highlight several points. Firstly, it illustrates that when considering the diagnosis of post traumatic botryomycosis, the time interval between the traumatic event and the onset of clinical features may span decades. We submit that this is due either to the small size of the bacterial load or their low virulence. Secondly, it is our contention that the poor response to antibiotics is due to the severe, impenetrable fibrosis.

All but one of the patients had disseminated disease (lung, lymph nodes, liver, spleen and kidneys). None of the patients presented subependymal tubercles. One patient had dual mycobacterial infection -miliary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in all the extracranial affected organs and tuberculous meningitis with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAC). Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed high cellularity and high albumin concentration in all cases; glucose levels were low, except in one case with normal glucose content -the MAC infected patient. One patient had associated systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and low CD4+ cells count. The histopathologic appearance consisted of a granulomatous meningitis with giant cells and epithelioids in three cases and polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate including numerous positive bacilli in Ziehl-Neelsen stain in MAC infected patient.

Rapid and accurate specific diagnosis is mandatory since appropriate therapy can be chosen only on the basis of the precise identification of the causative agent. One of the most promising tools for rapid and sensitive identification of MB species is represented by amplification of specific sequences of the 16S rRNA MB specific gene on the fragmented DNA (max 200 bp) obtained from fixed tissues. Methods DNA was extracted from 15 cases selected from the archives of the Department of Pathology, University of Padova, with histopathologic features of granulomas, caseous necrosis, and Langhans-type giant cells. Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli and PCR/direct sequencing of a 155 bp variable region of the MB 16S rRNA gene were performed. H37Rv genome was employed as positive control. Results MB specific sequences have been identified in 12 of 15 samples analyzed (80%). In two DNA samples (13%) an inserted DNA product was detected and it is currently under sequencing, while in one sample (7%) no evidence of MB infection has been gained. Agreement with Ziehl-Neelsen was present in 8 cases (53%).

All patients belonged to the second to fourth decade and had presented with symptoms of space occupying lesion. Radiological investigations revealed well circumscribed lesions with ring enhancement. The smallest lesion measured 0.1x0.1cm and largest measured 3x1.5x1 cm. Only two of the six cases had detectable predisposing debilitating illness. One 48 yr. old male had past history of Liver Tuberculosis and had taken anti-Tuberculosis treatment and a 26 yr. old female had systemic lupus erythematosus and was on immunosuppressants. We received four surgically excised specimens and two autopsy specimens of the entire brain. Histopathology revealed necrotic areas, micro-abscesses and mainly foreign body type of giant cells. Lying within the giant cells as well as freely within the tissue were numerous golden brown to deep brown spherical forms of Cladosporium bantianum measuring 8-10 microns in diameter and their hyphal forms measuring 4-5 microns in diameter, 10-12 microns in length with septae and occasional branching.

Report of a case with immunohistochemical and electron microscopic studies KW Min 1 , IS Seo 2 1 Deaciness Hospital, Oklahoma City, USA 2 Wishard Memorial Hospital, Oklahoma City, USA Background Skeletal muscles are known to undergo bizarre reactive changes in response to traumatic injuries and may produce pseudosarcomatous lesions which may give diagnostic challenges to pathologists. Such lesions usually produce proliferative myositis in which atypical spindle cells of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic nature predominate and may simulate the appearance of fibrosarcomas and myofibrosarcomas. However with proper setting of previous trauma history, their true nature can be easily appreciated. We are reporting an unusual case of myxoid cellular lesion found in the abdominal rectus muscle involved in a post hysterectomy abdominal hernia which simulated the appearance of an extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC). Its true reactive nature was recognized by electron microscopic (EM) study. Design Light brownish gelatinous material aggregating 2.5x 2.5x1.0CM was found around the sheath of rectus abdominis muscle of a 48 year old female during a repair surgery of posthyterectomy ventral hernia. The tissue was fixed in buffered formalin and a representative portion of the tissue was fixed in phosphate buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde and post fixed in osmium with en bloc staining with uranyl acetate. Epon embedded thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. For immunochemistry, paraffin sections were stained for S100 protein, myosin, and actin by routine ABC-peroxidase techniques. Results On routine examination, the lesion was characterized by loosely arranged spindly to epithelioid cells in bundles with abundant myxoid stroma. The lesional cells varied in size with frequent bizarre hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitosis was rare. The cells showed weakly positive diffuse cytoplasmic stain for all of above antibodies. With the initial impression of EMC, an expert opinion confirmed the diagnosis of grade II EMC. However, EM revealed the lesional cells to be consistent with skeletal muscle cells having of varying stages of degeneration and regeneration. No ultrastructural characteristics seen in the tumor cells in EMC were present. The attending physician was advised of careful follow-up and close observation without any additional treatment. The patient remains with no evidence of disease by 7 year follow-up in spite of incomplete excision of the lesion. Discussion and conclusion The myxoid gelatinous material found in the abdominal rectus muscle presented herein showed histopathologic characteristics of EMC, however, electron microscopic studies revealed the lesion to be necrobiotic process of the rectus muscle. Evidence of no disease in 7 years of follow-up with incomplete excision supports the conclusion the lesion was not malignant as EM study indicated. This case exemplifies another variety of pseudosarcomatous reaction of skeletal muscles important in the differential diagnosis in the pathologic evaluation of cellular myxoid lesions.",

A case report with ultrastructural study IS Seo 1 Background Psammocarcinoma (PC) is a very rare variant of low grade serous tumors that appears to arise from the peritoneum and ovaries. This tumor has been defined as a serous neoplasm displaying 1) destructive invasion, 2) no more than moderate nuclear atypia, 3) no areas of solid epithelial proliferation except for occasional nests no more than 15 cells in diameter, and 4) at least 75 % of papillae or nests are associated with or completely obscured by psammoma bodies. PC shares some clinicopathologic features with serous tumor of low grade malignant potential (LMP), but may have been under-recognized at surgery and gross examination. The present case was incidentally found during a routine hysterectomy procedure for leiomyomas. The PC involved the omentum, peritoneum and diaphragm. We report, to our best knowledge, the first electon microscopic (EM) findings of PC. Design Tumor tissue was fixed in buffered formalin for routine examination. In addition, a representative tissue was fixed in phosphate buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde and post fixed in osmium with en bloc staining with uranyl acetate for EM study. Results This tumor met the diagnostic criteria of psammocarcinoma. There were numerous psammoma bodies with or without nests of epithelial proliferation with minimal nuclear atypia. More than 75% of papillae were either associated with or completely replaced by psammoma bodies. Multifocal involvement was noted on the surfaces of both ovaries and fallopian tubes. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells showed markedly villous surfaces with abundant long slender villi. Their length/diameter ratio (LDR) was 4 with some variation of their diameter. The cytoplasm contained abundant cytoplasmic organelles and intermediate filaments. Intracytoplasmic lumens were absent. Decalcified psammoma bodies resembled cut surfaces of geode. Discussion and conclusion Our case met the proposed criteria for this tumor that arose de novo in peritoneum. Ultrastructurally, this tumor shared some findings with serous tumors (junctional complexes, irregular microvilli), but differed by the lack of prominent desmosomes and frequent intercellular lumens. PC differed from mesothelioma in that significantly greater microvillus LDR, prominent desmosomes, tomofilaments, intracytoplasmic lumens, external lamina and glycogen were rountine findings in the latter. Our findings justify classification of PC in the group of serous epithelial tumors arising from the coelomic mesothelium.",

            "text": "Apoptosis, sarcomere disruption and myofibrilar degeneration in skeletal muscles of stable COPD patients: an ultrastructural study MD Ferrer 1 Introduction In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the diaphragm muscle shows signs of injury, even during clinical stability. In addition, these patients have a markedly increased susceptibility to additional diaphragm injury following inspiratory loading. We have hypothesized that, if sytemic factors play a role in diaphragm injury, limb muscles may also be affected. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether apoptosis occurs in the diaphragm and quadriceps of COPD patients, and to evaluate fiber injury in non-respiratory muscles. Methods Samples from both diaphragm and quadriceps muscles were obtained in 22 patients undergoing thoracotomy for a lowstage lung neoplasm (LN) and stratified into two cohorts according to pulmonary function: LN+COPD (n=11) and non-COPD patients (LN+non-COPD, n=11). In addition, samples form quadriceps muscle in 7 healthy age-matched volunteers were also included (control group). All samples were processed for ultrastructural analysis. The proportion (%) of normal nuclei (NN) and those showing early (EAN) and advanced (AAN) signs of apoptosis were determined in all samples. Digital images of longitudinal fiber sections (1950x) were used to determine the area fraction (%) of abnormal myofibrilar structures (AAb). Results The level of apoptotic signs in the diaphragm of both COPD and non-COPD groups was minimal and very similar to that of control limb muscle. In contrast, quadriceps muscle of both COPD and non-COPD groups showed a two-and three-fold increase respectively in the apoptotic nuclei when compared to controls, mainly due to EAN. Apoptotic bodies were not found. In control quadriceps AAb was 1,7\u00b10,3%, mostly due to sarcomere disruption, while quadriceps in COPD patients was associated with an increased AAb (21\u00b17%, p<0,005) including myofibrilar disorganization and degeneration. Conclusions In patients with COPD, the diaphragm is not altered by apoptotic phenomena. Muscle remodeling through apoptotic mechanisms as well as through structural changes, such as sarcomere disruption and myofibrilar degeneration, seem to be enhanced in the quadriceps muscle of these patients, regardless of the severity of pulmonary function impairment, suggesting that additional factors such as the degree of physical inactivity either related to the disease or to the preoperative status could also be involved. Background Renal chromophylic (papillary) carcinoma (CPRC) has a propensity for storing hemosiderin in tumor cells. By transmission electron microscopy (TEM), some tumors show a prominent lysosomal component, while in other cases, cells contain mostly isometric lipid vacuoles. It has been proposed that the latter would merely represent a papillary variety of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRC). The aim of this study has been to analyze the lysosomal content in chromophylic (papillary) renal cell carcinoma by both immunohistochemical study of CD68 expression and TEM, and to compare these results with those of conventional CCRC. Design Cases of CPRC (n=21) and CCRC (n=12) are the subject of the study. The presence and relative amount of lysosomes and isometric fat vacuoles was investigated by TEM (n=11). Immunostaining with CD68 antibody (PG-M1, Dako, Denmark) was performed in representative sections. The presence, distribution and percentage of CD68 staining in tumor cells was compared with TEM data. Results Expression of CD68 was observed in all cases of CPRC. The mean percentage of positive cells was 63% (1-95%). Distribution of positive cells was diffuse in 67% of cases. Of the 11 TEM cases, 9 contained abundant fat vacuoles, but only 4 had extensive isometric vacuolation by light microscopy. Electrondense lysosomes were less abundant than fat in 7 cases, 4 of which had massive CD68 expression. Detailed examination of fat vacuoles in these cases suggested they were membrane-bound and of probable lysosomal origin. CD68 expression was also observed in 11 cases of CCRC, all of them with focal distribution, involving a mean of 14% tumor cells (1-50%). These differences were statistically significant (p<0.001). Conclusions Diffuse CD68 expression is typical of CPRC and may be a useful auxiliary diagnostic criterion. The isometric fat vacuoles in CPRC are often membrane-bound and of probable lysosomal origin. These findings support the notion that the lipidcontaining, vacuolated variety of CPRC is different from CCRC.",

This study was performed to assess VEGF levels of expression in both serum and tissue in benign, premalignant and malignant urinary bladder lesions with or without schistosomal infestation in a trail to study the angiogenic phenotype of these lesions and to address any possible role of VEGF as a prognostic biologic marker of bladder cancer. Also the impact of schistosomal infestation on the VEGF level of expression was assessed.The study included 62 patients: 27 chronic cystitis cases (17 schistosomal and 10 non-schistosomal), 5 cases with schistosomal premalignant lesions (metaplasia, dysplasia and leukoplakia) and 30 cases with bladder carcinoma (5 schistosomal SqCC, 14 schistosomal TCC and 11 non-schistosomal TCC). Eight cases with normal urothelium served as controls. VEGF serum concentration was measured by the enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) while, its tissue expression was detected by immunohistochemical staining.. Significantly higher levels of VEGF where detected in the premalignant and malignant cases in tissue (p< 0.01 & p< 0.001 respectively) and in serum (p< 0.01) compared to controls. Also an aberrant increase in VEGF serum and tissue levels was recorded in malignant cases compared to those with chronic cystitis (p< 0.001 & 0.01 respectively). Schistosomal infestation was found to have a positive impact on VEGF tissue and serum levels. Tissue VEGF positive rates was 100% in all the premalignant and malignant schistosomal associated cases. On stratifying malignant cases according to their histopathological grade and stage, an evident stepladder increase in VEGF serum and tissue levels was recorded. VEGF serum levels were well correlated with their corresponding tissue level which may indicate that VEGF serum levels are reflecting intratumoral angiogenic status. Although both VEGF serum and tissue levels were positively correlated with tumor histopathological grade and stage, yet this correlation was more evident with the tissue expression (r= 0.7, r= 0.6, p< 0.001 in tissue, while r= 0.5, r= 0.4, p<0.01, p=0.05 in serum with grade and stage respectively). In conclusion, our data indicate that VEGF expression level in both serum and tissue may be used as a valuable angiogenic marker for prediction of prognosis. This may help in selecting patients for more intensive surgical or chemotherapeutic approaches. Serum VEGF concentration may be used as a non-invasive prognostic parameter especially in high risk patients who need continuous follow up.",

Few data are available about microvessel density (MVD) in urothelial tumors of the upper urinary tract (UUT). Our purpose was to investigate the MVD in patients with urothelial tumors of the UUT and to check for its relationships with stage, grade, and survival. Patients, material, and methods There were investigated 32 patients with urothelial carcinoma of the UUT. Routine-stained slides were reviewed by two independent pathologists for the final diagnosis, T stage, and grade. Only cases with invasive and mixed papillary-invasive tumors were included. Two cases had lymph node metastasis. Additional slides were stained for FVIII, CD31, and CD34. MVD was estimated using the hot-spot method and mean value, calculated on 10 consecutive fields from the tumor area and 10 from the deeper connective tissue (x200). All cases had a follow-up of minimum 5 years. Results Best results were obtained with CD34 and CD31. In the tumor area, mean values of MVD were 9.7 for T1, 23.78 for T2, and 37 for T3. The hot-spot method consists of choosing the field with maximum density of blood vessels, and results showed 16 for T1, 34.16 for T2, and 49.66 for T3. The comparison between MVD and G showed a significant increase from G1 to G3 in the mean values and maximal density as well: 6.1/10 for G1, 23.76/36.5 for G2, and 33.07/41.75 for G3. No relationship was found between MVD and N positive cases. Nine patients with high MVD died within 5 years. The extra-tumor MVD had no prognostic significance. Conclusions Our results show a strong correlation between tumor areas MVD, T, G, and survival. MVD had no value as a predictor of lymph node metastasis.",

This tumor was interpreted as adenocarcinoma. The second pattern was different, it consisted of small tubules some with mild cystic changes lying in an edematous stroma. The tubules were lined by a single layer of flattened cells with faintly eosinophilic cytoplasm and bland nuclei, mitotic figures were not identified.

This is accompanied by elevated levels of oestrogen receptor alpha (ER), predominantly in the stroma. Recently, we described a simple, in vitro model to create moderate upregulation of ER in human, prostatic stromal cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that in BPH upregulated ER and the action of androgens differentially regulate expression of several stromal growth factors. Materials and methods Eight human, prostatic stromal cell strains were subjected to a procedure to upregulate ER alpha by exposing them to 1 micro mol beta-estradiol for 10 days, followed by passage and growth in the absence of steroids. Four cell strains received instead 100 n mol of dihydrotestosterone for 48 hr. Immunoexpressions of ER alpha, AR, and six growth factors (FGF-2, FGF-7, IGF-1, TGF-beta1, NGF and eNOS) were quantified by flow cytometry. Results Expression of ER was significantly increased above control (6 out of 8 cell strains). Expressions of all six growth factors were elevated but not significantly so. However, there was a significant positive correlation between the change in ER (expressed as percentage of control) and the change in FGF-2 and FGF-7. Exposure of four cell strains to dihydrotestosterone reduced the expression of ER and all six growth factors in comparison with oestrogen-treated cells. This reduction was significant for ER and FGF-7. Conclusion Upregulated ER in prostatic stroma have a greater modulating effect on synthesis of certain growth factors than the direct action of androgens and hence may play a major role in the development of BPH.",

One of the supportive criteria is the presence of retraction clefting around neoplastic glands. The aim of our study was to analyze needle core prostatic biopsies in order to determine the frequency of periacinar clefting spaces in tumors and non-tumorous prostatic tissue. Materials and methods We analyzed a consecutive series of 137 prostatic cancer cases diagnosed by needle core biopsy to determine the frequency and extent of periacinar clefting. All tumors consisted of at least 30 neoplastic glands. Specimens were fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, cut at 5\u00b5m thickness and routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Clefting was analyzed on 10 neoplastic and 10 normal glands in three different high power fields. Results One third or more of 30 analyzed glands with clefts affecting more than 50% of circumference were significantly more common in tumors (51.8%) than in benign glands (8%). More strict criterion that designated as positive cases with at least 50% of neoplastic glands (fifteen out of thirty) with clefts that affected more than 50% of circumference revealed clefts in the malignant cases only (15.3%) but not in benign cases (0%). Fifteen or more glands with clefts regardless of their extension were also more prominent in malignant cases (86.9%) than in benign cases (20.4%).

For three of the selected cases we performed additional histochemical (Alcian-Blue-PAS) and immunohistochemical study (anti-CK, anti-PSA, anti-vimentin, anti-smooth muscle actin, ABC and LSAB system, visualization with DAB). Results We identified 8 cases of ureteral obstruction due to unusual pathological lesions. They occurred in 5 men and 3 women. The mean age of the study group was 50 years (range 34 and 58 years). There were 3 malignant and 5 benign lesions that produced ureteral obstruction. In 5 cases, the compression was extrinsic and only in 3 cases the obstruction was intrinsec. The site of ureteral obstruction was in the lower ureter in 2 cases, in the lower and the middle ureter in 3 patients and in the upper ureter in 3 cases. The pathological lesions were: ureteritis cystica -2 cases, nephrogenic adenoma of the ureter -1 case, retroperitoneal fibrosis -1 case, reproperitoneal sarcoma -1 case, pelvic endometriosis -1 case, prostate cancer metastasis -1 case, signet ring cell carcinoma of the colon invading the ureter -1 case. Conclusions After discarding the more common causes of extrinsic or intrinsic ureteral obstruction, the proliferativemetaplastic lesions of the urothelium, the retroperitoneal fibrosis and sarcoma, the endometriosis and metastatic/invasive carcinoma should be considered in the diagnosis.",

Methods AR and TGF alpha were studied in paraffin sections from 50 men (35 treated for prostate cancer and 15 for BPH by open, transurethral prostatectomy or prostate biopsy) No patient had undergone previous treatment for the prostate disease. The sections were stained with HE to establish morphological characteristics (Gleason Score) and then were studied with indirect immunoperoxidase method applying monoclonal antibodies to AR(F 39.4.1 Biogenex) and antiTGF alpha (clone 88, Biogenex). Results were semiquantified using Histoscore.Nuclei were graded for intensity of AR staining (0-absent,1-weak,2-moderate or3strong) and the percentage of these intensity levels and a total intensity score were determined. We compared the AR and TGF alpha characteristics of prostate cancer (PCa) with BPH. Results Increasing Gleason grade was correlated with decreasing intensity score and greater heterogeneity of AR staining and increased (+++) TGF alpha immunoreactivity. Conclusions Our data indicate that AR and TGF alpha content could be useful predictors of endocrine response and biologocal behaviour of prostate cancer. and 8 ductus deferens samples), patients in group B were orchiectomised for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, teratocarcinoma of the testis and/or epididymal cyst (normal 22 epididymal and 7 ductus deferens samples) and subjects in group C were treated by radical prostatectomy or cystectomy for prostate or urinary bladder cancer (44 samples of seminal vesicles without inflammatory changes). Results HPV DNA was detected in 7(31%) of patients in group A (HPV types 6, 16, 33, 35, 55, 73) , in 1 (0.5%) patient in group B(at present unclassified type) and in 5 (11.4%) patients in group C(HPV types 16, 18 and 52).Neither koilocytes nor dysplastic changes were observed. Conclusion Our data confirmed the presence of HPV, both lowand high-risk types, in the male genital tract. They support the idea of a male reservoir of HPV infection.",

Surgical repair may improve sperm quality. The aim of this study is to investigate a grading system of varicocele and its correlation with the histological appearance using a multiple biopsy method. Materials and methods Bilateral double testicular biopsies of 53 young infertile grade 2-4 varicocele patients were examined histologically. Spermatozoa numbers counted in ten round shaped tubules, severity of atrophy and presence of maturation arrest was recorded. Distribution pattern of observed spermatozoa numbers was evaluated. Results Grade 2 and 3 cases showed normal distribution. In grade 4 cases five peaks were found indicating group inhomogenity. Lower grade varicoceles presented with milder histological changes (mild atrophy or normal spermatogenesis) while in higher grade varicoceles more marked alterations (moderate-marked atrophy and/or maturation arrest) were seen. Conclusion Grade 4 varicocele cases represent an inhomogeneous group, which should be divided into more categories. Modification of the grading system is required. Spermatogenetic activity of varicocelic patients cannot be predicted from clinico-radiological examinations so before ART a diagnostic testicular biopsy is recommended.",

Cystoprostatectomy was performed in a 68-year-old male patient with previous cytological diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder and no evidence of prostatic malignancy on preoperative clinical investigations. Gross analysis of the urinary bladder revealed a cauliflower tumor mass filling the entire lumen and infiltrating the wall of the bladder. The size of the prostate was slightly increased. Histological analysis of the urinary bladder specimens showed poorly differentiated transitional cell carcinoma, with only a few foci of preserved papillary architecture, infiltrating deeply into the muscle layer of the bladder wall. The specimens taken from the prostate gland for the purpose of staging of the neoplasm excluded the existence of infiltration of the prostatic urethra with the previously described neoplasm, but foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (Gleason score 6) of the prostate were discovered in its vicinity. The subsequent extensive sampling of the prostate showed organ confined adenocarcinoma. The review of the literature showed that the reported prevalence of synchronous existence of double primary malignant neoplasms of the urinary tract (transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and prostatic adenocarcinoma) varies between 27% and 33%. The prevalence is noted to rise with increasing age. This leads to a conclusion that during standard cystoprostatectomy analysis, extensive sampling of the prostate is needed, even in the absence of macroscopic changes and preoperative clinical data suggesting prostatic neoplasm.",

Materials We performed a retrospective analysis of nephrectomies and autopsies performed in our clinic. Results Of 120 renal cell tumors 26 (21, 7%) were multifocal. Most of the patients were men. Twelve cases were present where the histological subtype of the largest tumor was clear cell. Satellite tumors were clear cell carcinoma (7), papillary adenoma (5), angiomyolipoma (3), renomedullary fibroma (2), Bellini duct carcinoma (1) . Six multiple renal cell tumors were found in T1, two in T2, four in T3A stage of the primary tumors. Four patients had bilateral neoplasms. In thirteen cases only multiple papillary adenomas and carcinomas were found. Usually tumors were no more than 3 cm in diameter. In six cases multiple tumors originated on a background of nephrosclerosis of various genesis (chronic pyelonephritis, gouty nephropathy, amyloidosis). Conclusion When conservative surgery of kidney cancer is performed, it should be remembered that 20% of patients with renal cell tumor have multiple neoplasms, which may cause local recurrence.

The heterogeneity of prostate cancer defines the current clinical challenges. One challenge is to identify in early, still potentially curable, stages of prostate cancer, molecular markers that predict aggressive or metastatic behavior. Prostate cancer is characterized, like many other cancers, by molecular and genetics aberrations involving chromosome 6. Parkin, mapped at the long arm of chromosome 6, is a 465 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 52 kDa, an ubiquitin-like domain at its amino terminus and two RING finger motifs flanking a cysteine-rich region. Our aim was to investigated whether Parkin alterations play a role in development and progression of prostate carcinoma Materials and methods We examined Parkin expression, by Western blot analysis in eight prostatic carcinomas derived cell lines as well as in normal prostate, and in three prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PIN) and in twenty primary prostatic carcinomas by immunohistochemistry. Results Parkin protein was undetectable in six out of eight prostate cancer cell lines tested and barely detectable in the remaining two whereas normal prostate showed a substantial expression. Preliminary results using immunohistochemistry showed that Parkin expression was absent in PIN lesions, and in the prostatic carcinomas analyzed. Conclusion Our findings suggest that Parkin might be a useful tool to detect early alteration in prostate cancer.",

KDR/flk-1 is a receptor-tyrosine kinase that binds specifically vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on vascular endothelium, mediating its full biologic spectrum. Although KDR/flk-1 expression was at first reported to be restricted to the classic endothelium there is increasing evidence that KDR/flk-1 is also expressed by normal and tumor cells other than endothelial. Aims: As data about KDR/flk-1 protein in urothelial bladder cancer is very limited, we investigated its expression in a series of 114 urothelial carcinomas in relation with clinicopathologic parameters and patients' survival. Moreover, prompted by studies suggesting that KDR/flk-1 may have broader functions apart from angiogenesis we evaluated KDR/flk-1 expression in relation with markers of cellular proliferation and apoptosis (Ki-67, p53, bcl-2). Materials and methods Immunohistochemistry (ABC-HRP) was performed for the detection of KDR/flk-1 (mouse/A-3, SC-6251, Santa Cruz), Ki-67, p53 and bcl-2 using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.

The aim of the study was to establish characteristic immunohistochemical patterns in benign and malignant prostatic lesions so they can be used to classify foci of AAH as benign or malignant. Materials and methods Using immunohistochemistry, prostatic needle biopsies from forty-five patients were evaluated for cytokeratin 903, p63 and alpha-methylacyl-CoA Racemase (P504S). Twenty-five of these biopsies were benign and twenty contained prostatic adenocarcinoma. Results 96% of the benign prostatic biopsies were positive for cytokeratin 903 and p63 and 96% were negative for P504S. Only one case of benign prostatic tissue was focally positive for P504S. When evaluating cases with adenocarcinoma 95% were positive for P504S and 100% were negative for cytokeratin 903 and p63. P504S immunostain showed consistently positive staining in areas of low and intermediate grade adenocarcinoma and areas with high grade PIN. High-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma was frequently negative for P504S. Sensitivity and specificity for cytokeratin 903/p63 were 96% and 100% while sensitivity and specificity for P504S were 95% and 96%. Conclusion Cytokeratin 903 was as sensitive and as specific as p63 and can be used interchangeably in cases of AAH. The combination of the two antibodies did not improve sensitivity or specificity. A combination of negative cytokeratin 903 or p63 with positive P504S may be helpful in positively identifying prostatic carcinoma in cases of AAH.",

Results were expressed as negative (-) for no staining, (+) for positive staining in up to 10% of stromal cells, (++) in 10-25% of cells and (+++) for more than 25% of positive cells. Stromal blood vessels were counted in ten HPF. The degree of desmoplasia was also analyzed by Mallory staining and expressed semiquantitatively as weak, moderate and strong. Results and conclusions Highly increased number of myofibroblast was observed around neoplastic acini in 16 (34.1%) cancer cases, moderate in 10 (21.2%) and sparse in 21 (44.7%) cases while there were occasional myofibroblastic cells adjacent to normal acini. There was a positive correlation between the degree of stromal desmoplasia and the proportion of SMA and vimentin positive cells in adjacent stroma. The number of vessels in the adjacent stroma was also significantly increased in comparison with normal glands (p<0.05). It seems that myofibroblasts are present in the stroma and may play a significant role in the desmoplastic stromal reaction in prostatic adenocarcinoma. Results Among the 20 SRCC, 2 (10%) showed no epithelial differentiation, and in the other cases the epithelial component was conventional RCC in 10 cases (50%), papillary CCR in 5 (25%), and chromophobe RCC in 3 (15%). There was no sex predominance and the average patient age at the time of diagnose was 61 years. Sixteen cases (80%) presented an advanced stage at the time of diagnose, and 13 (65%) died of disease. The immunohistochemical study showed that 17 cases were positive for c-Kit (89.5%), 7 diffusely (>50% of the sarcomatoid cells positive), 6 moderately (10-50% of the cells), and 4 focally (<10% of the cells). Conclusion The high expression of c-Kit in SRCC in our series and the existence of target therapy against cells expressing this marker (Imatinib (STI-571, Gleevec, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) suggests its potential use in the clinical management of these patients in order to improve their prognosis, especially in disseminated cases.",

A comparison of PCR and immunohistochemical detection methods The role of human papilloma virus (HPV) in the development of bladder carcinomas remains controversial. Varying techniques have been used to identify this virus in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). Here we used two different methods to detect the presence of mucosal HPV in 78 TCC samples. The first, immunohistochemistry, involved using a polyclonal antibody that reacts with the L1 capsid protein of most known papilloma viruses. The second method is used on a general primer-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. This involves using type-specific oligonucleotide probes to identify 22 different mucosal HPV genotypes from a 150bp PCR product from the L1 region of the HPV genome. The two methods produced contrasting results, 78% of the samples were positive for HPV antigen and 2% were positive for HPV DNA. The reason for such conflicting results is that polyclonal antibodies are not specific and are likely to cross react with other antigens. PCR is specific, more sensitive, and it is widely used to detect HPV in a variety of clinical samples. The results obtained in our study implies that HPV does not play a role in the development of bladder carcinoma, and PCR remains to be the best method to detect HPV in TCC.",

O Gladskikh 1 Introduction Most human carcinomas including prostate cancer are associated with stromal reaction typified by changes in growth factor expression and over-accumulation of extracellular matrix. Our study deals with the differential TGF-\u03b11 production in neoplastic focuses and in adjacent paraneoplastic stroma in prostate. Materials and methods Tissue samples from radical prostatectomies were examined. To verify malignant material or benign the immunohistochemical staining against high molecular weight cytokeratin was performed on sections and in heterogeneous primary cultures of the same specimens. The immunohistochemical identification of TGF-\u03b11 was also performed. The ELISA technique for quantitative analysis of TGF-\u03b11 soluble form in culture supernatants was applied. Results Majority of selected cancer cases were histologically estimated as small-sized glands with large desmoplastic fibromuscular stroma. The immunohistochemical staining for TGF-\u03b11 in malignant focuses was much more significant than in neighbouring benign areas on sections in contrast to, the cultures obtained from neoplastic or paraneoplastic portions of prostate tissue which stained positively for TGF-\u03b11 without any difference. Considering that immunohistochemistry shows only latent TGF-\u03b11 we evaluated its bioactive form in culture supernatans. We found dramatically high supernatant levels of active TGF-\u03b11 in benign cultures compared to the cultures from the malignant areas. Conclusion Our data demonstrate that desmoplastic alterations in benign areas adjacent to malignant glands was associated with elevated expression of TGF-\u03b11 active form. So significant alteration in factor production and accompanied tissue remodeling can be considered as a protective reaction of surrounding stroma against tumor invasion.",

In this study relationship between two proliferative cell markers:1-Mitotic Index(MI)& 2-AgNOR and tumor grade were studied. Methods and materials In a cross sectional descriptive study 75 paraffin blocks of patients with TCC of the urinary bladder in the period from 2000 to 2002 from pathology department of shahid Mostafa Khomeini hospital, were obtained and from each one 3 micron sections were provided. Tumor grade on basis of WHO/ISUP grading system, was determined and number of mitosis on 100 tumor cells were counted. In the other section, after one-step silver nitrate staining, the number of NOR also on 100 tumoral cells were counted and the mean of it in each cell were determined. Results The high grade tumors possessed more AgNOR per nucleus than did the low grade ones. Significant relationship between tumor grade and MI (P=0.000, rs=0.801) and AgNOR (P=0.000, rs=0.731), and also between MI and AgNOR (P=0.000, rs=0.638) were found. Introduction The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed not only in breast, but in a range of other tumor types including, ovarian, salivary gland, endometrial, pancreatic, non-small cell lung (NSCLC) and bladder cancer. However, non-standardisation in HER2 status evaluation or population selection has generated conflicting results among the incidences of HER2 expression in individual tumor types and bladder cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate HER2 overexpression and gene amplification with standardized routinely performed assays (DAKO HercepTest, FISH-Vysis, CISH) on a selected population of poorly differentiated urothelial carcinomas of the bladder. Materials and methods We analyzed 55 formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue samples of urothelial carcinomas of the bladder at G3/pT3-4 as well as 22 cases at G1/2 pTis (2)and pTa-1 (20) using HercepTest to verify the HER2-status. Staining and scoring was performed according to the manufacturers instructions. According to diagnosis of HER2, all HercepTest positive (2+) tissue samples were used for further evaluation with fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH; Vysis) and chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) to approve the expected gene amplification. This procedure is in agreement with the standardized guidelines for breast cancer. Results 30 (60%) cases were considered as HER2 positive (3+ and 2+) in the primary tumor and therefrom 16 cases (32%) 2+ positive and 14 cases (28%) 3 + positive. Out of the 16 cases with 2+ positivity, only two cases showed a FISH/CISH positivity. No polysomy for chromosome 17 was detected.",

Material and method Fifty-one radical prostatectomies were whole mounted, serially sectioned and examined for TV, NTV, TV/NTV, capsular invasion, vascular invasion, seminal vesicle invasion and Gleason score. The FN distribution, \u03b2-hCG and PSA expression were examined immunohistochemically. A FN-positive staining was defined as a constant diffuse, or pericellular demarcation of FN-positive fibers surrounding tumor cells at the invasive border. In lack of such staining pattern, FN-negative staining was recorded. Results Both TV and TV/NTV showed very strong positive correlation with grade, capsular invasion, vascular invasion, seminal vesicle invasion, \u03b2-hCG and PSA expression (p<0.01). \u03b2-hCG was detected only in 16 cases (31.4%). A significant relationship was found between \u03b2-hCG expression and grade, capsular invasion, vascular invasion, seminal vesicle invasion, PSA expression (p<0.01). The FN-positive staining reaction was significantly associated with lower incidence of capsular, and seminal vesicle invasion (p<0.05). TV and grade was found higher in tumors with negative FN staining (p<0.05). PSA expression showed significant relationship with grade, vascular and capsular invasion (p<0.01). NTV statistically showed no relationship with all parameters. Conclusion These data suggest that, TV, TV/NTV, FN distribution, \u03b2-hCG and PSA expression in prostatic adenocarcinoma have strong prognostic importance irrespective of Gleason score. The FN distribution could be important for the invasion of the tumor cells during cancer progression. These may allow stratification of patients to type of treatment and may allow selection of expectant management for men with localized prostatic adenocarcinoma.",

Published results of the evaluation of NED as a prognostic factor in PC after radical prostatectomy (RP) have been contradictory. The aim of this study was to correlate NED in PC in relation to biochemical failure after RP. Materials and methods Radical prostatectomy specimens from 36 PC patients without preoperative hormonal or radiation therapy were followed for 13 to 73 months. Neuroendocrine (NE) cells were identified using a panel of immunohistochemical NE markers: chromogranin A, serotonin, and neuron-specific enolase. NED was scored as NE-negative (0 to 1+) or NE-positive (2 to 3+) per 10HPF. Biochemical progression (BP) was defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level greater than 0.2 ng/ml in two consecutive measurements. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate BP-free survival time for each risk group. The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was the model for BP time using pathological and clinical variables. Results The total of 23(64%) patients developed BP after RP. The average time for BP was 16 months. The preoperative PSA serum level range <10 ng/ml in 52% of the patients. Postoperative staging confirmed that 23 (64%) of patients had pT2 stage and 13 (36%) of patients had pT3 stage. NED demonstrated in the 14(61%) PC patient with BP. The average time for BP was 10 months. Tumor volume (p<0.05), pathological stage (p <0.05), tertiary Gleason grade (p= 0.01) and NEDF (p<0.01) significantly affect the level of postoperative PSA progression.

The majority of urinary bladder tumors are transitional cell carcinomas. Different factors are effective in the prognosis of these patients. One of these factors is the histologic grade. Another factor is to determine the ABO blood groups and the relationship of it with the histologic grade. Thus, this study is conducted to shed some lights on this issue. Materials and methods A cross sectional study was conducted in 198 patients with urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma during 1996 -2000. Results Of 198 patients, 43 were female (21.7%) and 155 were male(78.3%). The mean age of patients was 63.7+/-12. There was no significant statistical relationship between of histologic grade and ABO blood groups. There was no significant differences between the ABO blood groups frequency in patients with urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma and general population. Conclusion Although the existing differences between Asian, European and American studies might be due to racial effects, it is better to carry out more studies in this respect in order to comment in this area with more confidence and certainty.",

Prostatic mucinous carcinoma (PMC) is a variant of high-grade adenocarcinoma, with a 77.8% rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) elevation and a similar rate of response to endocrine therapy. The aim of this study was to report on a case of PMC with signet ring cells treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). Materials and methods A 70-year-old man presented with acute urinary retention and long history of difficult voiding. The serum PSA was 8.9 ng/ml. The transperineal biopsy of the prostate gland was done and the histology showed a poorly differentiated PC with large lakes of extracellular mucins. Isotope bone scan was normal and a CT-scan did not show evidence of extracapsular spread of the tumour. Radical prostatectomy was performed. Patient died seven month after RP. Results Histopathologically, over 70% of the prostate samples were infiltrated by a poorly differentiated PC with mucinous and signet ring patterns. Mucin secretion is evident as large pools of mucin and periodic-acid-Schiff-positive diastase-resistant intraluminal and citoplasmic globules. Immunohistochemical staining for PSA and prostate-specific-acid phosphatase was positive, and negative for carcinoembryonic antigen and cytokeratin 20. Conclusion The diagnosis of PMC with signet ring cells requires exclusion of an extra-prostatic origin, mainly within digestive tract. Since only small number of MPC cases treated with RP have been reported, treatment and prognosis of this tumour remain unclear. Introduction CD10 is a well-known marker for hematolymphoid neoplasms and is expressed as well in various nonhematopoietic tissues and solid tumors. A systematic study of CD10 expression in TGCTs, however, is lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunoreactivity for CD10 in the different patterns of TGCTs. Material and methods Immunostaining with Mab against CD10 (clone 56C6) in 59 unselected cases of primary (46 cases: 18 classical seminoma (CS); 9 pure embryonal carcinoma (EC); 18 mixed-non-seminomas; 1 spermatocytic seminoma (SS) and metastatic (13 cases) TGCTs. In mixed tumors, the different histological patterns were evaluated separately. Results CD10 was expressed in 18 (78%) out of 23 cases in the CS component, in 15 (100%) of 15 teratomas, in 13 (93%) of 14 endodermal sinus tumors (EST), in 11 (100%) of 11 cases of choriocarcinoma (ChC) or syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells (STGC) and in 1 (4%) of 23 EC. CD10 was focally positive in 28 (80%) of 35 cases of intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN) and was negative in one SS. Conclusions Except for EC and SS, CD10 is expressed in the majority of histological types of primary and metastatic TGCTs. CD10 is useful to highlight minute foci of EST, ChC or STGC in EC. A TGCT is to be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of a CD10 positive metastatic tumor of unknown origin. Further studies are needed to evaluate the eventual significance of CD10 as a prognostic factor or as a potential therapeutic target in TGCTs.",

However, in many cases of conventional renal cell carcinomas (CRCC), these parameters are insufficient to predict the clinical behaviour of these tumors. Therefore, several studies have focused on the evaluation of new markers. The CD44 proteins form a broadly distributed family of cell surface adhesion molecules involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. De novo expression of CD44s and its variant isoforms has been associated with aggressive behaviour in various tumours. The aim of this study was to analyse the prognostic value of CD44s and CD44v6 in renal cell carcinoma. Materials and methods The expression of CD44s and CD44v6 was immunohistochemically evaluated on 75 RCC: 62 were CRCC, 9 papillary, 3 cromophobe and 1 collecting duct carcinoma. The expression was compared to usual clinicopathological parameters. Results In normal renal tissue no staining was observed. The CD44s molecule was upregulated in 18 CRCC (29%), 4 papillary, one cromophobe and collecting duct carcinoma. Only 5 tumors were focally CD44v6 positive. The statistical analysis showed the correlation between CD44s expression and Fuhrman nuclear grade (p<0,0025) as well as Ki67 proliferative index (p<0,0003).

Consequently, it has been suggested that Trastuzumab, an antibody targeting the extracellular domain of Her-2, could be used in this setting. The possibility of assessing Her-2 expression by immunohistochemistry could be used as a rationale for the treatment of advanced cases with this drug. The aim of this study was to assess whether Her-2 expression is increased in bone metastases of prostatic cancer compared to the respective primitive tumors, and to determine whether this overexpression could be related to gene amplification. Materials and methods In this pilot study, primary tumor needle biopsies and bone metastases from 7 patients diagnosed with prostatic cancer were immunostained wit C-erb-B2 antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and the results scored using a threetiered system. In addition, in a bone marrow sample from one of the cases, HER2 gene amplification was investigated using FISH. Results There was a significant increase in Her-2 expression in four cases, with the same level of expression in primary and metastatic tumors in the remaining three patients. In addition, FISH showed no amplification of HER2 gene. Conclusion HER-2 overexpression is not a constant event in prostate cancer metastatic to bone. Preliminary evidence suggests that in cases with overexpression, it is not related to gene amplification. A larger study will be required, however, to definitively determine the real therapeutic meaning of these findings.",

Design Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 18 low-grade and 17 high-grade transitional tumors was immunostained with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against the Retinoblastoma Family of Proteins, and with monoclonal antibody against p53 protein. The avidin-biotin-peroxidase (ABC) method was utilized with every antibody (Dako, clone Rb1 for p105; Santa Cruz, clone sc-318 for p107; Santa Cruz, clone sc-317 for p130 and Dako, clone DO-7 for p53). Immunostaining was scored quantitatively by 3 pathologists, following previously described criteria, to study p105, p107 and p53. Nuclear and/or cytoplasmic location was determined by 3 pathologists to study p130. Results p130 expression: among 18 low-grade tumors, 12 (66.67%) showed nuclear positivity and 4 (22.22%) showed a granular cytoplasmic pattern of staining. Among 17 high-grade tumors, 1 (5.88%) showed nuclear expression and 13 (76.47%) showed a granular pattern of staining. p53 expression: among 18 low-grade tumors, 1 (5.55%) showed positivity and among 17 high-grade tumors, 14 (82.35%) stained positively. We found no stadistically significative differences regarding p107 and p105 immunohistochemical stainings. Conclusion Due to granular cytoplasmic pattern of staining for p130 is more frequent among high-grade transitional neoplasms, we propose that p130 granular cytoplasmic immunohistochemical pattern of staining may be considered a marker of tumor progression in transitional cell tumors. The prognostic value of p130 cytoplasmic positivity among low grade cases, as well as the prognosis of tumors with p53 overexpression and p130 granular cytoplasmic pattern will be discussed.",

Aim: Use the ploidometry research for studying the epithelial cell clones in the prostate, forming the different stages of cancerogenesis. Methods Computer ploidometry test was carried out for nuclei of epithelial cells in biopsy specimen of the prostate, taken from 80 patients in different stages of cancerogenesis. Histological preparations of 8 micron thickness, stained by Feulgen's technique, were subject of the research. Nuclei's ploidy was defined by means of the computer image analyzer \"Imager-CH\" (\"Avtan-San\" software version). The integral brightness of nuclei of 396 small lymphocytes, found in histological sections, was tested to define the \"tissue ploidy standard\" (2c), which, in its turn, was used for obtaining the data on ploidy of 1332 epithelial cell nuclei of the prostate gland. Inter-phase cell nuclei of clones with normal and hyperplastic prostate gland, areas of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN-I-low grade -and PIN-II-high grade) and adenocarcinoma in different stages of dedifferentiation (well, moderate, poorly) were the subjects of investigation. The research determined that while the cancerogenesis progressed, the proliferative activity (indirect type information) of prostate gland cells and the ploidy of nuclei naturally increased. Introduction Calcitriol and its analogues affect function of several normal and neoplastic cells, including cells of medullary thyroid carcinoma originating from parafollicular cells. In the cells expression of calcitonin gene takes place, yielding due to alternative splicing calcitonin (CT) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP). The aim of this study was examination of effects of calcitriol and of its two analogues, PRI-1906 and PRI-2191 on proliferation of two cell lines in vitro and on expression of calcitonin gene.",

The estimated variables included: cell number, proliferation-associated antigens (Ki-67, PCNA), CT and CGRP levels in medium (RIA), amounts of the two hormones and of their mRNAs in the cells (immunocytochemistry or hydridocytochemistry accompanied by image analysis). Results Calcitriol and its analogues exerted low antiproliferative effect, more evident in MTC than in TT cells. PRI-2191 affected production and secretion of the two hormones. Evident correlation was noted in TT cells, positive for CT and negative one for CGRP. In MTC cells, the effect was slightly less intense. PRI-1906 exerted a similar effect in the two cell lines but only at higher concentrations of the analogue. On the other hand, calcitriol manifested its activity only in MTC cells. Effects of studied substances were also examined on CGRP/CT ratio of secreted hormones, which reflected corresponding ratio of alternative splicing of CT gene transcript.

Their malignancy is extremely difficult to estimate on the basis of histopathological features. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) is a marker for lymphatic endothelium. Its ligands VEGF-C and VEGF-D are expressed in many neuroendocrine tissues. Our aim was to investigate the expression and the potential role of VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGFR-3 in various pheochromocytomas. Materials and methods Thirty-three pheochromocytomas, six of them metastasized, were studied using immunohistochemistry. Thirteen tumors exhibited histologically suspicious features, such as necrosis, mitosis count over 5/10 HPF, vascular or capsular invasion, but they not metastasized, and were thus called borderline tumors. Results and conclusions VEGF-C immunohistochemical positivity was found in most pheochromocytomas. The expression of VEGF-C was heterogenous and varied also within different tumor groups (benign, borderline, and malignant tumors). However, it tended to be stronger in extraadrenally located tumors. VEGF-D positivity was also found in most tumors studied (10/18). Interestingly, all malignant tumors (n = 3) were totally negative for VEGF-D. VEGFR-3 expression was found in 15 out of 33 tumors, but the staining was mostly weak. The expression of VEGFR-3 did not seem to correlate with the expression of VEGF-C or VEGF-D.",

The tumor was composed of cords and nodules of adrenal cortical cells intimately admixed with pheochromocytes. Immunohistochemical investigations highlighted these two cellular components. The adrenal cortical cells revealed inhibin and melan A immunopositivity, whereas the pheochromocytes were strongly reactive with chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and ACTH, and the sustentacular cells with S-100 protein.

Results Intensity of immunostaining for BCL-2 antigen in patients with chronic thyroiditis was stronger than in patients without lymphocytic infiltration. An increase in the intensity of lymphocytic infiltration did not affect BCL-2 mRNA levels. FAS antigen got stained in subjects with mixed inflammation; a presence of oxyphilic cells enhanced the stain reaction.

Results The staining intensity of either antibody was evaluated as positive or negative using different thresholds (0, 25 and 50% of positive cells). Generally, the intensity of staining of Gal was much higher than that of CK19. Using 0% threshold, 8/10 FA showed positivity of Gal and none was positive in CK19. In FC, 8/9 tumors were Gal positive, 4/9 were also CK19 positive. Among FVPC, all 12 cases were Gal positive and 11/12 were also CK19 positive. Using 50% threshold, only 1/10 FA was Gal positive, none was CK 19 positive. Among FC, however, all tumors were both Gal and CK19 negative. On the other hand, 9/12 of FVPC were Gal positive and 4/12 were CK19 positive.

Design We selected 69 FT neoplasms (22 adenomas, 14 minimally invasive carcinomas, 22 widely invasive carcinomas, and 11 anaplastic carcinomas), classified using standard criteria. Histological variables including anisokaryosis, chromatin pattern, nucleolus, nuclear pleomorphism, nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, necrosis, stromal changes, and tumor interstitial lymphocytes (TIL) were studied by histological diagnosis (significant if P<0.05). Oligo(dT)-primed double strand cDNA was produced from total RNA, and libraries were produced from 3 normal thyroids and 8 FTC. Sequential analysis of gene expression (SAGE) was performed (FTC/control expression factor\u22652, significance\u22640.01). Results TIL were absent in 64/69 neoplasms. Minimally invasive carcinomas were distinguished from adenomas by conspicuous nucleolus, increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, and coexistence of apoptosis and myxoid changes in adenomas. The most specific variables of high-grade carcinoma were coagulative necrosis, and nuclear hyperchromatism and pleomorphism. FTC SAGE showed ubiquitin C and sequestosome 1 down-regulation, and tumor protein translationally controlled 1 and malate dehydrogenase 1 up-regulation. This SAGE profile correlated negatively with proinflammatory molecules expression (Interleukin-1beta, chemokine XC-receptor 1, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2, protein tyrosine phosphatase C), BRCA2, and protein phosphatase 4. The correlation was positive with proliferation markers (myb, mitogenactivated protein kinase 12, cyclin-dependent kinase 8, BRCA2/CDKN1A interacting protein, and RAS oncogene family). Conclusions Proliferation up-regulation and apoptosis downregulation results in prominent nucleolus and high nuclear/ cytoplasmic ratio for low-grade carcinomas and hyperchromatism and nuclear pleomorphism for high-grade carcinomas. Tumor down-regulation of proinflammatory molecules explains TIL absence.",

However, ossification in papillary carcinoma is very rare. A case of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid metastatic to cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes with associated bone formation and extensive calcification is presented. Case report A 67 year-old male with a history of gastric carcinoma was admitted to hospital presenting with lumbal pain. A computed tomography scan revealed a calcified nodule, measuring in 33 mm diameter in the thyroid. Total thyroidectomy and modified neck dissection were performed. The thyroidectomy specimen showed a well circumscribed, calcified, rock-hard nodule measuring 4x3x2 cm. Histologic examination of the hard nodule after decalcification showed spicules of bone formation and papillary carcinoma. Foci of metastatic papillary carcinoma with bone formation were also seen in the cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes. There was also bone marrow formation both in the thyroid nodule and in the metastatic lymph nodes. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells were positive for thyroglobulin. Conclusion Ossification in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid is an unusual finding. The mechanism of bone formation is not clear. The presence of ossification both in primary and metastatic tumoral masses suggests that ossification is not a dystrophic process in the preexisting benign thyroid tissue but somehow related to the papillary carcinoma in the present case.",

Biomedical Science and Human Oncology University of Turin, Turin, Italy 2 Dept. Thoracic Surgery University of Turin, Turin, Italy Introduction The occurrence of well differentiated endocrine tumors (carcinoid) in the thyroid gland is unfrequent and may represent both a differential diagnostic problem with medullary carcinoma, and a potential pitfall in the searching for its primary or metastatic origin. Our aim was to determine the differential morphological and immunohistochemical profile of two cases of carcinoid tumors localized in the thyroid -one metastatic from the lung, and the other of unknown origin. Materials and methods The first collected case had a clinical history of an atypical lung carcinoid diagnosed two years before, while the other lacked a clinical, instrumental and laboratory history suggestive of a possible primary carcinoid elsewhere. Paraffin embedded material was histologically reviewed and analyzed by immunohistochemistry for thyroglobulin, calcitonin, CEA, chromogranin A, S-100, TTF1, and Ki-67. Results The first case (F/55) presented as multiple nodules in both lobes, composed of poligonal eosinophilic cells arranged in the typical organoid pattern. Foci of necrosis were present. The morphological features overlapped with those of the primary lung tumor. The second case (M/52) presented as a single nodule in the left lobe, morphologically resembling typical carcinoid without necrosis. Both cases were negative for thyroglobulin, calcitonin, S-100 and CEA, positive for chromogranin A and TTF1, and low proliferating (Ki-67 <10% in both). Conclusion Our data suggest that, even in the absence of a clinically detected primary tumor, the occurrence of a carcinoid tumor in the thyroid gland should be firstly considered metastatic in origin, the lung being the major candidate for the primary localization (as determined by TTF1 immunostaining).",

Material and methods In 414 cases diagnosed as goiter we analyzed: 1) sex distribution, 2) age distribution, 3) correlation between clinical and cytological diagnoses and 4) goiter classification in accordance with cytological characteristics. Results Goiter was five times more frequent in females than males (348 women, 66 men). The majority of the patients were between 41 and 50. The youngest was 13, and the oldest 78 years old. Almost 84% of cytologically diagnosed goiters had the same clinical diagnosis, in only 1.5% of all patients tumor was suspected clinically. We confirmed high correlation between clinical and cytological diagnosis. According to the cytological characteristics all goiters were classified in 2 categories: goiters with and without degenerative changes. Hi-square test confirmed statistically significant difference in the presentation of such goiters (Hi-square test=10.4; p<0.01).",

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the value of a universal short-term storage cell medium in processing FNAB samples for different ancillary methods. Materials and methods After diagnostic smear preparation, the needle and syringe were washed out with the short-term storage cell medium in 6535 FNAB samples, obtained from 1998 to 2002. Microscopic smear analysis determined the choice of ancillary method used. Cell suspensions were then processed as required for each individual ancillary method. Results We used 3200 (49%) FNAB samples stored in the medium for ancillary methods, while 3335 samples (51%) were discarded due to the clear morphology-based diagnosis or sample inadequacy. Immunocytochemistry was performed on 2057 samples. For various membrane, cytoplasmic and nuclear antigens, adequate immunoreaction without background was obtained in samples stored in the medium overnight (1797) or over the weekend (260). Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry was performed in 1088 FNAB samples where up to 8 lymphoma antigens per sample were successfully determined when the samples were stored in the medium overnight. High quality flow cytometric DNA histograms were obtained from all 55 FNAB samples suspended in the short-term storage cell medium. Conclusion The short-term storage cell medium that we have been using, allows effective and easy processing of FNAB samples for several ancillary diagnostic methods. It preserves cell morphology, various membrane, cytoplasmic and nuclear antigens as well as DNA content.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate high risk HPV-DNA test systems in cervical cytological material and the correlation with Pap smear cytology. Materials and methods We analysed 40 routinely processed cytological cervical specimen. Material was taken consecutively for Pap smear cytology and for Hybrid Capture (HC) hybridisation assay (Digene). The cytological report showed mild to severe dysplasia (7 cases were scored as PAP I/II). After performing the HC-assay, DNA was extracted from the same sample.

The other patient was a seventy two year-old female who had an FNA from an intrathoracic mass. Branching fascicles of spindle cells with indistinct cytoplasmic borders in a necrotic background were observed in the cytologic examination. Mesenchymal origin was verified by vimentin immunopositivity. By detailed computerized tomographic evaluation, it was revealed that the mass originated from the gastroesophageal junction.

Materials and methods From thirthy three surgical specimens of bone tumor imprints were made, air-dried and stained by May-Grunwald-Giemsa method. The cytologist gave detailed description of the smears, concluded whether the lesion was malignant and suggested a final diagnosis if it was possible. Results were compared with the corresponding histopathologic diagnoses. Results Out of 19 cases with primary malignant bone tumors (chondrosarcoma 9, Ewing sarcoma 2, ameloblastoma 2, synoviosarcoma 2, malignant osteoclastoma 1, malignant fibrous histiocytoma 1, malignant schwannoma 1, leiomyosarcoma 1) the cytologist recognized malignancy in 18 of them and in 10 suggested the final diagnosis. In 14 patients with metastases (squamous cell carcinoma 11, anaplastic carcinoma 1, malignant melanoma 2), the cytologic and histopathologic diagnoses correlated in all cases. Conclusion Cytologic analysis of the imprints of bone tumors is valuable as early orientation for the clinicians since the final histopathologic diagnosis needs time because of the decalcination procedure. The correlation of cytologic and histopathologic diagnoses was better for the secondary bone tumors because cytologist was more familiar with their morphology.",

Aims of the study were to evaluate a) the usefulness of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in differentiation between pure and mixed mucinous carcinomas, and b) to correlate key cytological features with survival. Material and methods We reviewed FNAB of 98 women with mucinous breast carcinoma treated at the Institute of Oncology from 1983 to 1999. Key cytological features analysed were cellularity, amount of mucin, presence of capillaries, cell pattern, cytoplasmic characteristics and nuclear pleomorphism. Type of mucinous carcinoma was determined histologically after resection of the tumour. Association of cytological features with cancer specific survival was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results Histological analysis revealed 64 cases (65%) of pure and 34 cases of mixed mucinous carcinoma. Nuclear pleomorphism and amount of mucin in FNAB differed significantly between the two subtypes of mucinous carcinoma. Whereas cellularity of cytological samples, presence of capillaries, cell pattern and cytoplasmic characteristics were not related to prognosis, nuclear pleomorphism and absence of mucin in cytological samples were associated with poorer cancer specific survival. Furthermore, the absence of mucin in FNAB samples retained independent prognostic significance also in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Higher grade of nuclear pleomorphism and small amount or even absence of mucin in FNAB favor the diagnosis of mixed mucinous cell carcinoma and are features associated with poorer prognosis.",

However, contours of erythrocytes could be recognized upon 48 hours after sacrifice in I experimental group. Conclusion Autolysis of myocardial vessels is influenced by two factors: time interval from the death and micro environmental temperature. The temperature exerted more profound influence on autolysis than time interval. The observed autolytic changes could be used in the expertise of the time of death occurrence.",

The aim of this study was to determine the presence of viral genome in native heart and the frequency of viral recurrence after heart transplant in pts with myocarditis. Material and methods From March 1987 to November 2000, 36 heart transplants were performed in children (1 month to 18 years 24M/12F) at our Institution. Histology/immunohistochemistry was carried out in all native hearts; among inflammatory cardiomyopathy,4 cases were active myocarditis and 16 dilated cardiomyopathy/ chronic myocarditis. Foci of active myocarditis were also found in one case of hypertrophic/restrictive cardiomyopathy and one case of congenital heart disease respectively. Retrospective PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and sequencing analysis for detection of cardiotropic viral genomes was performed in 20 native hearts (55%) and in all serial post-transplant biopsies from viral PCR positive cases. Results PCR amplified a viral product in 10 native hearts (50%). PCR analysis on postransplant serial biopsies disclosed the same viral infection in 5 of 10 (50%). Early enteroviral recurrent myocarditis with identical genotype was demonstrated in 2 cases at 1 month after transplant. Fatal outcome occurred in 4/5 pts with viral recurrent myocarditis when prompt molecular diagnosis was not available; misdiagnosis of acute rejection in histological monitoring may have concurred in the fatal outcome. Conclusion Viral myocarditis frequently relapses after heart transplantation in children and is a risk of fatal outcome. Molecular study in native hearts is mandatory to improve diagnostic accuracy allowing to a more strict surveillance after transplantation.",

Data suggested that SCD is a multifactorial catastrophe involving in most instances myocardial lesions that we confirm by this report. Materials and methods Five cases were autopsied in Institute for Forensic Medicine because they have died from SCD. The mean age was 29,4 years, including one boy (13 years) and one girl (14 years). All specimens were fixed in 10 % formalin. Paraffin sections were cut and stained by: HE, Van Gieson and AB-PAS, pH=2,5. Results Clinical symptoms lasted short time: fatigue, dyspnea, palpitations and precordial discomfort, accompanied by fever. Macroscopically, the hearts were normal or enlarged, with dilatation of chambers. The ventricular myocardium was typically flabby and mottled by either pale foci or minute hemorrhagic lesions. Histological finding: myocarditis was characterized by an interstitial mononuclear predominantly lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate and by injury of focal necrosis to myocytes adjacent to the inflammatory cells; focal aggregates of macrophages and microhaemorrhages, often surrounding the conduction system, were also observed. Scattered incipient fibrosis inside the areas with disappeared myocytes was one of the features of myocarditis. Conclusions The ultimate mechanism of death in viral myocarditis was fatal arrhythmia induced by inflammatory mononuclear infiltrates of the conduction system.",

Besides gross and histologic examination, tumour histotype was defined by immunohistochemistry using a large panel of antibodies and by transmission electron microscopy. Primary malignant CPT comprised 6 extracardiac (3 pericardial mesothelioma and 3 pulmonary artery sarcoma) and 10 intracardiac masses. The latter group consisted of angiosarcoma of the right atrium +/-right ventricle (3), undifferentiated sarcoma of the left atrium (3), fibrosarcoma of the right atrium (1), malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the left atrium (1), B cell lymphoma of the right atrium (1) and leiomyosarcoma of the right ventricle (1) .

The tumours are classified into intimal and mural types according to their location and clinical behaviour. We describe a case of intimal sarcoma arisen in the thoracic aorta of a 62-years-old woman with multiple embolic abdominal metastases (spleen, kidney, adrenal). Case report In november 2002 the patient was hospitalized for the embolic occlusion of the left popliteal artery. The recent clinical history revealed irritative cough, dispnea and fever. The laboratory tests reported anemia (hemoglobin: 8.3mg/dl) and the VES was 119. Electrolities, liver function tests and fibrinogen were within normal limits. The antiphospholipid antibody and lupus anticoagulant were negative. A CT-scan showed an intraluminal thrombus-like mass in the thoracic aorta and multiple geographic infarctions of the spleen suggestive for a primary aortic tumor. She died before undergoing to surgery, for left ventricular failure. Results Post-mortem examination showed mild atherosclerosis and a mass with grayish-yellow, solid, rubbery and mixoid aspects, attached to the wall of the aorta, just after the origin of the left subclavian artery. Histologic sections disclosed a spindle-shaped sarcoma cells with pleomorphic nuclei in a myxoid stroma; necrosis was abundant.

Material and methods Small arteries, less than 3mm in diameters were implanted in pigs. Three groups were done: Group1(n=5): fresh autograft (AU) and fresh allograft (AL) one in each side; group 2 (n=5): Cryopreservated AU and cryopreservated AL; group 3 (n=5): fresh AL and cryopreservated AL.

The implanted grafts were embedded in paraffin and microscopically studied with hematoxilin/eosin and elastic stains for morphology and morphometrics. A basic immunohistochemical study with CD3 and MAC387 was also performed. Results The patency rate of cryopreservated AL and AU was 100%, as it was in the fresh AU. The inflammatory reaction, evaluated by CD3 and MAC387 was present in all AL arteries, and absent in AU cases. In group 3, the infiltration was lower in cryopreservated, than in the fresh ones. Conclusions In our series of pig's arteries, cryopreservation increases vascular patency and the inflammatory response is lower than in fresh arteries. This fact is independent of the immunosupressive therapy.",

Origin of glands has been attributed to epithelial differentiation of a cardiomyogenic precursor cell or to entrapped embryonal rests. We studied four cases of glandular myxomas (3 sporadic and one familial) to define the immunophenotypic profile of the glandular elements. Materials and methods Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed on serial sections. Broad spectrum cytokeratin, cytokeratin 7 (CK7), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), CEA, EMA, chromogranin A, calretinin, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), Ki-67 and p53 were investigated. Results Three patients were males, aged 55, 23, 57, respectively and the fourth a 45 y.o. woman. The glands were either scattered within myxomatous stroma (3 cases) or in groups. In the latter case the glands featured villous projections, irregular profile, active inflammation or focal low grade dysplasia, and showed expression of acidic and neutral mucins (mostly sialomucins). Cytokeratin 7 and 20 co-expression was found, similarly to foregut derivatives. There were scattered chromogranin-positive neuroendocrine cells in one case and Ki-67 immunostaining showed a very low proliferative activity. There was no reactivity for TTF-1, calretinin or p53. None of the patients had adenocarcinoma or other neoplasm, either at diagnosis or at 1-19 years follow-up. Conclusions Our findings indicate that glandular component of cardiac myxoma is morphologically heterogenous. The isolated glands suggest a possible divergent (epithelial) differentiation of myxoma cells, but other findings point to the possibility of entrapped foregut rests with mature neuroendocrine and mucous cell populations.

Material and methods This study has been carried out on the human aorta, coronary heart vessels collected from 59 early performed autopsies and on the carotid arteries gathered during surgical vessels remodeling of 18 persons. The patients with cardiovascular insufficiency on atherosclerosis background from 31 to 59 years were taken into study group. Chlamydia Pneumoniae was detected by routine microscopy on Shtive fixed material, and by immunohistochemical reaction performed on cryophilic specimens marked with Fits antibodies. HSP-60 and TNF-\u03b1 implication have been studied trough immunohistochemical reaction using monoclonal antibodies. This material was fixed in 4% formaldechyde solution. Results Chlamydia Pneumoniae has been detected in endothelial cells, macrophages, smooth muscle cells of fatty streaks and fibrous plaques. Its detection incidence decreases in advanced arterial lesions. We also determined that Chlamydia Pneumoniae infection is capable to induce immune reaction against HSP-60 which can be considered like a target in autoimmune reaction. They produce an cytotoxic effect on the endothelial cells followed by permeability disturbances, faciliting the atherosclerotic lesions progress. Among the inflammation mediators in increased quantity TNF-\u03b1 have been detected being localized on the surface and in depth of atherosclerotic plaque around the foam cells. Conclusions Our outcomes demonstrate the toxic and infectious factors existence which can be considerated decisive in atherosclerosis pathogenesis.

Case report Transthoracic echocardiogram of a 46-year-old man with arterial hypertension, otherwise healthy, with normal ECG and chest X-ray, revealed a wide based isoechogenic tumour, measuring 3.1 x 2.2 cm, located in the moderately enlarged left atrium, attached to interatrial septum and anterior wall, adjacent to mitral valve annulus, sparing oval fossa. It showed minimal mobility but did not cause any obstruction of the blood flow or mitral regurgitation. Macroscopically, surgically removed tissue was spongy, partly haemorrhagic. Microscopically, there were cavernous venous structures, filled with blood and focally thrombosed. Focally, a few smaller capillary channels were found. There was no endothelial atypia and no papillary hyperplasia. Discussion and conclusion Histologically, hemangioma of the heart has two major differential diagnostic possibilities. In case of a myxoid background, it is possible to be misdiagnosed as myxoma, but in hemangioma there are no myxoma cells and no ring structures. Grossly, opposite to myxomas, hemangiomas are rarely attached to the oval fossa. Papillary hyperplasia, which is reactive endothelial proliferation in hemangioma, may lead to misdiagnosis of angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma can be excluded only when the whole tumour is examined and no marked endothelial atypia, cellular areas of spindle cells with poorly formed vascular channels, and necrosis are found. Compression, obstruction, effusion and bleeding are responsible for clinical picture. Symptoms depend also on the location, size and invasiveness.

Some authors believe that the limb-body wall disruption is separate from amniotic band syndrome. Others suggest that both belong to a wider spectrum, with a possible overlap between these two categories. In the present study, we describe a case of LBWC and based on our findings we suggest a new pathogenic mechanism. Case report A 32 years-old Cap-Verdean female gave birth at 33 weeks to a pair of twins. One foetus showed multiple malformations incompatible with life. Physical examination showed partial lower extremity amputations. A large omphalocele was also noted. There was a large lumbosacral meningocele and the head showed micrognathia and high-arched palate. There was right hydronephrosis secondary to right ureteral obstruction and cloacal anomaly. The lungs were hypoplastic. The histology of the internal organs was characteristic for the developmental stage and cytogenetic testing revealed a normal male karyotype. Discussion and conclusion We believe, that early amniotic bands may lead to vascular insults, proximally and distally by altered haemodynamics. The lower limbs were partly amputated as a result of the continued growth associated with altered vascular supply. The same mechanism may explain the other findings as well. Vascular disruption by virtue of altered haemodynamic state may give rise to thromboemboli, which may affect the growth of external/internal structures, distant from the site of disruption. However, this vascular lesion was masked by continued growth of the foetus. Therefore, the ABS may precede and may cause the LBWC.",

The most common clinical sign is respiratory difficulty. PPB appears as a pulmonary and/or pleural-based mass and is characterized histologically by a primitive, variably mixed, blastematous and sarcomatous appearance. No metastases have been reported in neonatal cases. We describe two cases that presented PPB. The first was a term male infant of a G8P7 mother. The pregnancy was uneventful. After normal delivery, a male infant with severe respiratory distress was born. By ultrasound examination, a thoracic mass were identified. There was no response to the intensive care. The infant died at the age of 3.5 hours. At autopsy, a tumour of 212 g, measuring 10x8 cm was found in the left lung. In addition, there was a smaller mass, of 3 cm diameter in the mediastinum. Micro-scopically, the tumour masses consisted of PPB. The second case was a 3-year-old female with persistent fever and respiratory difficulties. In CT scan, the lower lobe of the left lung was replaced with a tumour mass. During operation, the tumour was seen to be infiltrating to the mediastinum and was partially resected, followed by intense chemotherapy. Histologically, the diagnosis of PPB was given.

The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between placental lesions and stillbirth. Materials and methods We analysed the causes of intrauterine foetal death after the 26th week of pregnancy during the years 1991-2002 at the Departments of obstetrics and gynaecology of the Clinical Hospital Osijek and General Hospital Karlovac. A complete autopsy was made on each stillborn, including investigation of the placenta, cord and foetal membranes. Histological specimens were studied from all internal organs of the foetus and from the placenta, cord and membranes. Haematoxylin and eosin stain is used in routine causes, PAS staining to assess thickening of the basement membrane and trichrome staining to assess stromal fibrosis of the villi when it was necessary. Results There were 201 stillbirths who died before labour -174 placentas of them were examined and 27 weren't. Abnormalities were found in 142 (81.61%) placentas and 'normal' placentas were 32 (18.39%).

Our study allowed to compare two classifications used in the evaluation of the atrophic and proliferous processes and to select from the Shiner/Shmerling degree I a group of cases (type 1 and 2 according to Marsh), which had no equivalents in the so far used scale. Moreover, it was shown that the sub-groups of the type 3 of destructive changes did not correspond fully with the so far used Shiner's degrees II-IV. It enables fast comparison of the atrophy degree with the results received before the introduction of the new modified classification. Moreover, a routine application of precise descriptions of histopathologic results of small intestine mucosa in syndromes of absorption disorders facilitates retrospective selection, from the so far used Shiner's degree I, of the cases corresponding with Marshal types 1 and 2. Conclusions Application of the modified Marshal classification for an evaluation of the small intestine mucosa in celiac disease enables accurate presentation of atrophic and proliferous changes including selection of type 1 and 2, which have no equivalents in the so far used Shiner/Shmerling classification.",

The head and neck region is the most common site for this tumour in children. Neonatal presentation of this tumour is rare. We present an autopsy case of a female newborn having a large tumour mass (11x9x7 cm) in the frontal region, covering the entire upper half of the face. Similar subcutaneous noduli with diameter 3,5 cm, 3 cm and 2 cm were found on the left cheek, and another 4 with diameter 3,5 cm, 2,5 cm, 2 cm and 2 cm on the right cheek. The histological examination showed a tumour composed of large spindle cells with myoblastic features and small round to elongated undifferentiated cells. Associated with the spindle cells is various numbers of large round or globular cells with hyperchromatic nuclei surrounded by acidophilic granular or homogeneous cytoplasm. Cross-striations were found in the spindle cells. Imunohistochemically tumour cells were positive for desmin and vimentin. The final diagnosis was embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemical staining helped to make a proper diagnosis.",

Various apoptosis-associated regulatory proteins may contribute to the rate of apoptosis in neoplasia. The present study analyses the inter-relationship between the expression of the pro-apoptotic Bclx (S/L) protein and histological type and stage of Wilms tumour. Materials and methods Bcl-x (S/L) expression was investigated using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique, applying antibodies to Bcl-x (S/L) protein. Correlation of semi quantitatively scored Bcl-x (S/L) levels with histological type and tumour stage was performed for 28 cases of Wilms tumours (23 classical and 5 anaplastic). Results The expression of Bcl-x (S/L) protein was present in most cases of Wilms tumour (71%). Generally, Bcl-x (S/L) was expressed in the blastemal and epithelial components of Wilms tumour. In most cases, the expression of Bcl-x (S/L) was moderate. Blastemal Bcl-x (S/L) expression decreased with tumour stage. There was no correlation between histological type and expression of Bcl-x (S/L) protein. Diffuse expression of Bcl-x (S/L) protein was observed in 2 cases of anaplastic Wilms tumour. These two cases were stage I and of unfavourable histology. In 3 cases of Wilms tumour, no immunohistochemical staining was observed. So, these results cannot indicate whether absence of Bcl-x (S/L) could play a role in the development of anaplasia. Conclusion According to clinical follow-up, the results of our morphologic and immunohistochemical analysis suggest that decrease of the blastemal Bcl-x (S/L) protein could be associated with the capacity of Wilms tumour for local and distant spread.",

The aim of this study was to determine the expression of catenins in Wilms tumour and their relationship with histological type and stage of Wilms tumour. Materials and methods Catenins expression was investigated using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique, applying antibodies to alpha, beta and gama catenins. Correlation of semiquantitatively scored adhesion molecule levels with histological type and tumour stage was performed on 28 cases of Wilms tumours (23 classical and 5 anaplastic). Results Beta and gama catenins were present in most cases (89% and 75% respectively) and were usually coexpressed. Anaplastic type of Wilms tumour displayed higher beta catenin and lower gama catenin level in comparison with other types. Nuclear positivity, in each case, was found to be very strong, but was usually present only in 5 % of tumour cells. Beta and gama catenin expression was not correlated with stage of Wilms tumour. Alpha catenin was present in 35% cases of Wilms tumour. Stage III displayed higher alpha-catenin levels than stage I/II, suggesting that impairment of their function might exist without actual loss from tumour cells. Conclusion Our results suggest that the level of catenin expression is associated with histological type of Wilms tumour, regardless of tumour stage. Observed nuclear expression of beta catenin indicates that the activation of wnt-signaling pathway is crucial step in Wilms tumour genesis.",

Department of Pathology, Barcelona, Spain Case 1 A 3 year-old girl presented with seizures and weakness in the left part of de body of 1-year duration. CT scan showed a mass that filled the right ventricle, with a strong mass effect, peritumoural oedema, midline shifting and slight ventricular enlargement. A partial excision was carried out and the pathological diagnosis was that of choroid plexus carcinoma. The patient died six months later due to adjuvant therapy side effects. In the last WHO classififcation of brain tumours, grade III choroid plexus carcinoma is defined as a choroid plexus tumour showing features of malignancy: nuclear pleomorphism, frequent mitosis, high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, increased cellular, density, blurring of the papillary pattern, poorly structured sheets of tumour cells, necrotic areas, and often diffuse brain invasion. All those tumours classically displaying a papillary pattern must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Case 2 A 5 month-old child presented with respiratory distress since 3 months old. On RX and CT scan, a tumour in the left hemithorax was seen, with right shifting of the mediastinum. The tumour was partially removed. Pathological diagnosis was that of spinal canal invasion by a soft tissue lipoblastoma. Eight months after surgery the tumour relapsed, infiltrating the epidural spinal canal from C5 to D8. The tumour was fully excised by means of microsurgery techniques, without neurological deficits. This case is an example of invasion of the vertebral canal by a soft tissue tumour previously removed. Lipoblastoma is a rare fatty tumour occurring in children in the extremities or less commonly in the trunk or retroperitoneum. The tumour is benign but may recur. Grossly, lipoblastoma showed a distinct lobulated pattern of yellow-grey myxoid tissue, histologically composed of highly vascular fat in a myxoid stroma resembling embryonic white fat. Differential diagnosis, based on clinical-pathological grounds, include fibrolipoma and myxoid liposarcoma. Case 3 A 8 year-old boy presented with partial complex seizures for 1 year duration. NMR showed a discrete hypodense corticalsubcortical lesion in the left frontal lobe. Neither oedema nor mass affect was detected on CT scan. The tumour was completely removed by surgery and the pathological diagnosis was that of dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor. This is an intracortical grade I tumour composed of oligodendrocyte-like cells. Macroscopically, is a nodular outward expansion of the superficial cortex. Histologically, a low-power view of a perpendicular section of the cortical surface shows the characteristic pattern of multiple intracortical nodules and internodular tissue, both containing mucin. Also seen, is a specific glioneuronal component of vertical columns of neu-rites transversing the cortex, sheathed by oligodendrocyte-like cells accompanied by mucin and with 'floating neurons' (cortical ganglion cells seen in individual small pools of mucin). Case 4 A 14 year-old boy presented with diplopia and proptosis. The NMR showed a hypodense, diffuse lesion in the left temporal and parietal lobes that produced a slight collapse of the left lateral ventricle. Two weeks later the patient developed symptoms of time and space cognitive disturbances, language difficulty and seizures. A biopsy was done and the pathological diagnosis was that of gliomatosis cerebri. This is a rare primary brain tumour characterized by a diffuse proliferation of neoplastic glial cells that typically involve multiple brain areas with preservation of brain structures. The diagnosis depends on both histologic and radiologic features. On NMR there is a uni or bilateral diffuse involvement of the white matter extending to the cortex with poor mass effect. Microscopically, there is a proliferation of monomorphous astrocytes, grade II or III, infiltrating the brain parenchyma freely. Some undifferentiated cells show 'naked' nuclei while others look like 'rod' structures. In cases of low cellularity and cytologically bland astrocytes, it may be extremely difficult to make the differential diagnosis with reactive gliosis. GC is associated with a poor prognosis.",

            "text": "Introduction Production of materials for dental implants is of great social importance and is related to the progress in material technology. Main directions of development in this discipline concern an accurate choice of implant material in order to fix an implant in a bone tissue firmly and to decrease tissue reactions. New direction of research on implant materials is powder metallurgy. In comparison with the so far used technologies, it has many advantages, such as homogenous fine grained material structure, possibility to make composites including biologically active implants, and also ability to overgrow the implant with bone tissue. Aim of the study was morphological analysis of healing of dental alveolus canals filled with metal implants. Evaluation of tissue reactions in bones and surrounding soft tissue from several types of metal implants. Material and method The experimental study was performed on 56 mixed breed rabbits of 2600-3200g weight. After premedication with atropine with relanium, surgical procedure was performed in each animal. One of the incisors was extracted and after the canal was formed, metal implant was inserted. The first group (D1) consisted of animals whose dental alveolus canals were filled with cylinder of 6x3 mm made of pressed Co-Cr-Mo alloy covered with calcium triphosphate. The second group (D2) consisted of animals whose dental alveolus was filled with implants of cylindrical shape of a size 6x3 mm made of pressed Co-Cr-Mo alloy. The third group (D3) consisted of animals whose dental alveolus canal were filled with a titanium screw of a size 3x1 mm. The control group (K) consisted of animals whose dental alveolus canal was left only with blood clot. The postoperative wounds were sutured with dexon thread. The clinical and observations and histopathological Introduction Correct reconstruction of bone defects is a serious problem in orthopedics and in maxillo-facial surgery. Hence, numerous experiments and clinical studies on a usage of natural and artificial materials being a scaffold enhancing a reconstruction of bone tissue (i.e. carbon fibre, hydroxyapatyte granulate). Deproteinized bovine bone is a new material. It was elaborated in at the Mineralogy Faculty, Mining and Steel Academy in Krak\u00f3w. The technology of natural animal bone tissue enables its use in filling bone defects, accelerates reconstruction of bone tissue and minimizes unfavorable tissue reactions through total immersion into the reconstructed bone. It gives no incorrect immunological response of the body to the implanted xenogenic tissue. The aim of the study is to evaluate healing processes of the defects made in rat femoral bones and filled with deproteinized bovine bone and to compared it with spontaneous healing. Material and method The experiment was conducted on 84 Wistar rats divided into 2 groups (42 rats per group). The surgically made bone defects were filled with the study material. The animals, whose defects filled with blood clots spontaneously, made up a control group. The healing process in bone tissue was examined clinically and morphologically after 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days after the experiment. Results In histopathological estimation, the healing speed of the defect in femoral bone filled with blood clot (control group) was compared to the healing of the defect filled with deproteinized bovine bone (study group). No inflammatory reaction to the implant was observed. Moreover, acceleration of the healing of the defect filled with deproteinized bovine tissue was observed. Bovine bone was, in the study group, totally immersed in the body's bone tissue, i.e. was surrounded by the arisen on its surface sponge bone. In the last periods of the observation, on the borders of the observed synostoses no osteoblast cell activity was observed and normal bone marrow was found between osseous trabeculae. Conclusions Osseous wounds filled with deproteinized bovine bone heal without any inflammatory complications. No negative systemic reactions proves that the applied material was properly prepared for implantation. Histopathologic studies showed that deproteinized bovine bone accelerates regeneration process of a damaged bone tissue.",

The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the effects of inhibitors of caspases (50 mMol/L) on apoptosis of rat thymocytes induced by paclitaxel (10 mMol/L) and colchicine (2 mMol/L). The effect of z VAD and specific inhibitors of caspases (caspase 1, 3 and 9) after 4, 8 and 12 hours of incubation of thymocytes with paclitaxel and colchicine were analyzed. After incubation cells were fixed, processed for LM and EM, and the percentage of apoptotic cells (apoptotic index) was determined. General inhibitor of caspases zVAD and inhibitor of caspase 9 led to a significant decrease of apoptotic index after 8 hours of incubation with paclitaxel (from 29.03% to 19.76% and 14.23%). Inhibitor of caspase 3 and caspase 1 lowered the apoptotic index after 12 hours incubation with paclitaxel from 64.54% to 26.36% and 44.23% respectively. Inhibitor of caspase 1 did not affect the apoptotic index in controls, while the other used inhibitors reduced it. Inhibitors of caspase 1, 3 and 9 and zVAD had similar effects on apoptosis of thymocytes induced by colchicine. These results show that apoptosis induced by paclitaxel is caspase dependent, and that it, due to the effect of inhibitor of caspase 9, probably involves mitochondria. Caspase 1 activity might also be involved in mechanisms of induction of apoptosis of thymocytes by paclitaxel.",

Three distinct regions were analysed: transformation zone, invasive tumour margin and tumour center. Immunoreactivity in tumour and stromal cells was accessed by scoring (0 -4) in at least 200 cells respectively. Tumour and stromal cell positivity was accessed in the most positive area of tumour staining of the respective tumour region. Results and conclusion Significant difference of immunostaining was observed between tumour invasive margin and the other regions. In most cases the invasive margin was the most prominently stained region for tumour as well as for stromal cells. Most patients showed stronger staining of stromal than tumoral cells. Only patients with survival less than 30 months showed stronger tumour than stromal cell staining in invasive margin. From this we can conclude that the basis for cathepsin D prognostic value in laryngeal SCC lies in the stromal/stromal cell correlation of cathepsin D immunoreactivity of the invasive stromal margin.Literature Seiwerth at al.: Immunohistochemical analysis and prognostic value of cathepsin D determination in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

P-174 Relationship between clinical and immunohistological properties of the middle ear cholesteatoma N Milanovic, J Dimitrijevic, M Colic, M Jovic, M Djukic, V Jacimovic Military Medical Academy, Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro Introduction Middle ear cholesteatoma is characterized by proliferation of the keratinised squamous epithelium and accumulation of keratin debris into the middle ear cleft and mastoid. By aggressive growth it leads to the destruction of the mucous membrane, middle ear ossicles and nearby bony structures. Various inflammatory and immunocompetent cells as well as cytokines are involved in activation of epidermis and subepithelial tissue and accumulation of keratin debris in cholesteatoma. In the matrix of cholesteatoma as well as in the epidermis of the skin, Langerhans and Merkel cells are identified. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of Langerhans and Merkel cells in mechanisms of cholesteatoma growth. Material and methods Pathohistological and immunohistochemical studies were performed in 26 cholesteatoma specimens compared to the ear canal and retroauricular skin. Mononuclear antibodies against cytokeratin 20, which label Merkel cells and CD1 molecule with expression on Langerhans cells, were studied immunohistochemically.",

However, chimeric transcripts of ret/PTC were detected in the microdissected bland mononuclear cells of the osteoclastoma component. Ret/PTC could not be detected in the microdissected multinucleated giant cell component. Conclusion We present a case of osteoclastoma-like anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid and we demonstrate, for the first time, ret/PTC chimeric transcripts (ret/PTC-1) within the mononuclear cells of the osteoclastoma component thus shedding further light on the controversy regarding the histogenesis of this tumour.Introduction Aim of the study was to define a correlation between the index value of p53, PCNA and Ki-67 in several types of oral mucous epulides and to evaluate their proliferative activity. Methods Histopathologic studies were performed in a group of 56 patients. Monoclonal antibodies p53 (DAKO) -clone DO-7, subclass Ig-2b Kappa, method ABC (code NPO 10) were applied in the immunohistologic analysis. Nuclear antigen of proliferating cells, PCNA, was marked thanked to monoclonal antibody PC10 (DAKO), subclass IgG2a Kappa. Nuclear antigen Ki-67 was marked with the use of mouse monoclonal antibody MIB-1 (DAKO), class Igg-1 Kappa, code N1633. The p53, PCNA and Ki-67 indices were defined as a percentage of positive reactions to 1000 cells in high power fields. Results No expression of the protein coding gene, p53, which is present in a great number of neoplasms was observed. It can be a proof of their non-neoplastic origin. Analysing preparations with PCNA, one can observe great proliferative activity in the epulides of the studied types. In case of Ki-67, a small proliferative activity is observed. The average indices for women are: IEg 4.4, IEf 2.6, IEi 3.2. For men IEg 1.8, IEi 2.1.",

Results Bcl-2 protein was expressed in LNCaP cells but not in DU-145 cells. Bax protein was present at similar levels in both cell lines. Bicalutamide induced decrease of Bcl-2 in LNCaP and slight increase of Bcl-2 in DU-145 cells, but the level of Bax decreased only in DU-145 cells. These changes were not accompanied by changes in levels of mRNA. Bcl-2 alpha mRNA and Bax mRNA were not detectable in both untreated cell lines. Following bicalutamide treatment, LNCaP cells showed increased transcription of Bax, Bcl-W, BNIP3, BNIP3L and BAG2, and a decreased transcription of Bik, Mcl-1 and Bid. DU-145 cells responded only by a decrease in BNIP3, BNIP3L and BAG4 mRNA levels. In addition, we have found induction of mt p53 transcription in DU-145 cells and transciptional activation of genes upregulated by p53 in both cell lines. Conclusion Bicalutamide induces different levels of pro-and antiapoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 family in these two cell lines. The effect of bicalutamide can be mediated by p53-driven pathway independently of hormone receptor status. This work was supported in part by MSM151100001, NC/6200-3 and NC/7497-3.",

MUC expression was defined as \"markedly reduced expression (MRE)\", \"reduced expression (RE)\" and \"strong expression (SE)\". Results MUC1 expression significantly increased in P-IMC when compared with adenomas with mild (MRE: 75% vs 100%; RE: 25% vs no adenoma) and moderate dysplasia (MRE: 75% vs 96.7%; RE: 25% vs 3.3%).

The aim of our study was to analyze morphology, cytogenesis and malignant potential of these lesions in accordance with clinical, functional, high resolution CT data in UIP and DIP patients at early and late stages of the disease. Materials and methods Histopathologic slides of lungs from 1984 consecutive autopsies of South African miners registered at National Centre for Occupational Health were reviewed to describe the pathology of IPLN. Special attention was paid to compare lung parenchyma and IPLN regarding dust-related lesions. Results IPLN were seen in 73 of 1984 cases (3.7%). 9 cases (12.3%) had multiple IPLN. Silicotic nodules were seen in 28 cases (38.4%), of which only 2 (7.1%) cases showed co-existing parenchymal silicosis. In case of advanced IPLN silicosis, lymphoid tissue was almost totally replaced by confluent silicotic nodules, which contrasted with surrounding lung with no silicosis. Tuberculosis was not found in IPLN in 5 cases which had evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis. Metastatic deposits were seen in IPLN in 2 out of 4 cases which had both primary lung cancer and IPLN. Discussion and conclusions Intrapulmonary lymph nodes (IPLN) are not rare. IPLN shares the general pathology of lymph nodes including metastatic malignancy. Silicotic nodules are commonly seen in IPLN in the absence of parenchymal silicosis in occupationally exposed individuals. IPLN that are completely replaced by silicotic fibrosis may mimick parenchymal disease, leading to an erroneous diagnosis of a pulmonary silicosis.

Pulmonary hamartoma (PH) is a bening mesenchymal tumor, usually described as a solitary pulmonary nodule, composed of fat, smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium. The diagnosis is based on clinical data, imaging methods (radiography, computed tomography), fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and histomorphological study. Because of the tumor rarity we find just a few reports, concerning the cytologic characteristics. The aim of the present study is to describe the cytological features of PH and to compare them with the histological findings.Materials and methodsWe have examined four cases of PH, who have undergone surgery, and we have used routine histological stains on paraffin sections for the diagnosis. FNAC is performed prior surgery in one patient, and in the other three offprints of the resected tumor are prepared. Results The cytomorphological study show predominance of spindle cells, admixed with many stellate cells, and fibromyxoid material on a serosanquinous background as well. Postoperative histopathological study reveals spindle shaped smooth muscle cells, goblet cells, cystic spaces, covered with bronchiolar epithelium, cartilaginous or myxomatous tissue, thus confirming the diagnosis pulmonary hamartoma.

MVD was assessed by visual quantification of microvessels stained with anti-CD34 antibody. Results A strong expression of VEGF (>25% of neoplastic cells) was observed in 77.27% of carcinomas (36/48 squamous cell carcinomas, 22/30 adenocarcinomas and 10/10 large cell carcinomas). VEGF expression was correlated with MVD and tumor cell differentiation (p<0.001). Absent or reduced E-cadherin expression (<50% of neoplastic cells) was noted in 61.36% of tumors. A higher percentage of undifferentiated carcinomas was observed in the reduced E-cadherin group than in the E-cadherin positive group (p<0.0001). The simultaneous strong expression of VEGF and reduced expression of E-cadherin was correlated with tumor dedifferentiation (p<0.001). Conclusions The intratumoral VEGF expression correlates with tumor angiogenesis and histologic differentiation. E-cadherin expression is associated with tumor cell differentiation. Combined evaluation of VEGF and E-cadherin may provide evidence for a better understanding of the biological characteristics of NSCLC tumors, and it may appear useful in defining groups of patients with a poor prognosis.",

The aim of this study was to investigate expression of oncoproteins, prognostic markers, steroid receptors, antimesothelial markers, extracellular matrix proteins and a variety of other markers in LFTs by tissue array using immunohistochemistry. Materials and methods Two core tissue biopsies (4 mm in diameter) were taken from the paraffin blocks of eight CD34 positive pleural tumors to represent both hypercellular and hypocellular areas. A tissue array block of 16 tissues were prepared and examined for 21 markers.ResultsThere were five female and three male patients (age range: 30-75). Six intrathoracic extrapulmonary pedinculated, two intrapulmonary non-pedinculated lesions measured 3 to19 cm. The tumor cells showed variable immunoreactivity with SMA, desmin, ER, PR, CD99, CD57, CD10, CD117, bcl-1, Ki-67 and laminin. Expression of bcl-2 and collagen type III was detected in all cases. None of the LFTs showed immunoreactivity for calretinin, mesothelin, S-100, CD5, CD31, c-erbB2 and p53. The diagnosis was changed as desmoid tumor in one case. Conclusion No difference was detected between hypercellular and hypocellular areas of LFTs with respect to immunohistochemical profile. Collagen type III and bcl-2 could be used together with CD34 in the diagnosis of LFTs. Extracellular matrix proteins, CD10, CD57 and bcl-1 could be detected in LFTs. Overlapping immunoprofile of LFTs and gastrointestinal stromal tumors for CD117, CD34, bcl-2 and CD99 deserves further study.

This evaluation can be done either by frozen section FS or imprint cytology IC. In this prospective study we compared the diagnostic accuracy of IC of mediastinal lymph nodes performed during the operation and permanent section. Materials and methods One thousand and fifty mediastinal lymph nodes from two hundred and fiftyfive patients were evaluated. To obtain lymph node samples from various stations cervical medistinoscopy was performed in twohundred and thirtytwo patients. Twenty percent of the patients had anterior mediastinotomy and the rest videothoracoscopy. The average time for preparing an imprint slide was approximately two or two and a half minutes. For the final pathological diagnosis both imprint and permanent section slides were reviewed and the results compared. Results There were five false positive and eight false negative results. The sensitivity of IC was ninetythree point one percent and the predictive value of a negative result was ninetynine percent. Conclusion Reviewing the literature and comparing the diagnostic accuracy of FS in other studies we concluded that IC for the evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes in lung cancer is an accurate reliable simple and less time consuming method.",

Besides cytological examination of the pleural fluid, second most frequently used method is biopsy. This study was planned to investigate if video assisted thoracoscopy is mandatory where the case is diagnosed as inflammation and fibrosis with biopsy or the biopsy is non diagnostic. Materials and methods In a four year period needle biopsies and video assisted thoracoscopic VATS biopsies were performed at the same session on thirtythree patients with pleural effusion. The biopsy material was processed for routine haematoxilyn eosin stain. Histochemical stains PAS, Alcian blue mucicarmin and immunhistochemical methods cytokeratin, carcinoembryonic antigen, vimentin were performed on all material and the results compared.ResultsThe pathological diagnosis of needle biopsies Group I were chronic inflammation and fibrosis in twentythree, malignant mesothelioma in six and granulomatous inflamation in four patients. When compared with VATS biopsy results Group II in group I with chronic inflammation one patient was diagnosed as having malignant mesothelioma, one patient had a metastatic carcinoma, nine patients had granulomatous inflammation. Conclusion In patients suspected to have malignancy who are diagnosed as having chronic inflammation and fibrosis with needle biopsy VATS biopsy should be performed.Solitary fibrous tumor of the pleuraA Orki, \u0162 \u00dcrek, K Timurtekin, C \u0162enol, A Ersev Heybeliada Chest Disease and Thoracic Surgery Center, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction Solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura is a rare tumour and frequently arises from visceral pleura with a pedincule. In this study three cases with histopathological diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor is discussed in respect to clinical radiological and pathological aspects of differential diagnosis. Materials and methods Three patients who had symptoms related to a thoracic pathology were investigated through chest x ray, computerized tomogrophy and magnetic resonance imaging. Cytologic examination of sputum bronchoscopy, fine nedle aspiration of the mass lesion and finally resection through thoracoscopy or thoracotomy were performed. Routine haematoksilyn eosin stains, histochemical stains such as PAS and Van Gieson and immunohistochemically CK, EMA, Vimentin, Actin, S 100 and CD 34 were done. Results All three resection material were diagnosed as Solitary fibrous tumor of pleura. CK, EMA, Actin, S 100 were negative. Vimentin and CD 34 were strongly positive. Van Gieson showed the collagenous nature of the tumor.

However, although the inhaled smoke is passing through laryngo-tracheo-bronchial tree, cancers of trachea are extremely rare. The role of p-53 in cell growth regulation and its frequent overexpresion in tumors has lead to studies investigating its involvement in cancer. Mutation of the p53 gene occurs in approximately 45% of human cancers. p-53 expression increased consistently during the formation of squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx, trachea, bronchi and lungs. Materials and methods Samples of tracheal mucosa from patients with laryngeal carcinoma (No =91) or non-malignant diseases (controls, No =20) were embedded in paraffin and stained with HE. p-53 was immunohistochemical performed on 6 sections in the tissue samples. The immunohistochemical staining was carried out using monoclonal mouse anti-human p-53 protein (Clone Do-7). Scores were determined microscopically by independent pathologist. At least 200 cells at the tracheal mucosa front in at least five regions were counted. The final results was expressed as the percentage of positive nuclei per 200 cells.",

UC had radical nephrectomy for uncontrolled acute pyelonephritis. Results All were male. Mean age was 67 years.All had atypical cells in nearby collecting ducts. UC had carcinoma in situ in adjacent urothelium. Median survival was 5.6 months. Discussion Aggressiveness of our 3 lesions and ambiguous immunohistochemistry results on case 3, made us consider that CDC and UC of the renal papilla may share biological features. Normal collecting duct and the urinary tract have the same mesonephric origin. LOH 1q characteristic of all distal nephron tumors, have been described in UC. Immunophenotype of CDC includes positivity to CK903 which is also positive in UC. This overlappings shows us that these tumors are difficult to categorize and we may be in front of a spectrum of lesions. This may explain that some CDC may behave like UC and share some aspects, incuding their response to therapy. Conclusions CDC are aggressive tumors, and general pathologists should be able to recognize them. Immunohistochemistry is needed for diagnosis. Possible relationship between UC and CDC may have therapeutical implications.Serous papillary cystic tumor of borderline malignancy arising in testis -Case report Taksim State Hospital Pathology Lab, Istanbul, Turkey 2 Taksim State Hospital Urology Department, Istanbul, Turkey Primary adenocarcinoma is one of the rarest types of malignant testicular tumors.

Primary nonepithelial tumors of the thyroid gland are rare. Case report We present the case of a neurilemoma of the right lobe of the thyroid gland in a 16-year-old female patient. The tumor was asymptomatic and measured 6.5x2.5 cm in size. Histologic examination was consistent with an Antoni A-type neurilemoma. The tumor cells were strongly positive for S-100 protein. A loboisthmectomy was done. Conclusion Only 12 other cases of neurilemomas of the thyroid gland have been reported in the literature. The tumor can be sporadic or associated with type 1 neurofibromatosis. The diagnosis can be made cytologically and a large exision can be avoided.

Numerous investigations have been carried to prepare a normal medium for cultivation of embryonic cells. The cultured embryos with supportive and protective cells, such as granulosa cells are usually called co-culture, show many beneficial effects such as better cleavage and nutritional status. These techniques have obviated the existing developmental barrier in this respect. Some authors have suggested that the use of natural media which contain follicular fluid have shows a better and faster clavage of zygot and nutrition status. Therefore to obtain a better culture media we have investigated 5 media preparation: 1) follicular fluid, 2) Follicular fluid and granulosa cells, 3) Ham's F10 with 10% human albumine, 4) Ham's F10 with 10% human albumine and granulosa cells, and 5) synthetic serum substitute (3S). The secondary metaphasic oocytes of 27 patient were evaluated and fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection technique (ICSI) (n= 117). The injected oocytes have been transfered to one of the above media. The oocytes developmental process were evaluated approximately 21 and 43 hours after ICSI steps for two pronuclei formation and cell cleavage episodes respectively. The results showed that harvested fertilized oocytes were more abundant in 3S and follicular fluid media than in the other. After 43 hours of ICSI 18% of embryos were in 2-cell stages (n=21), 41.9% were in 4-cell stages (n=49), 11.1% were in 8 -cell stages (n=13) and 29.1% of them (n= 34) did not undergo cell devision at all. The maximum and minimum of uncleaved oocytes have been observed in Ham's F10 and 3S media respectively. The Co-culture media revealed the highest 8 -Cell stage embryos. The number of embryos have been significantly higher in 3S media than in Ham's F10 (P=0.0088). The best quality of embryos was only observed in Hsm's F10 alone and together with granulosa cells co-cultured media. The above results suggest that co-culture of embryos with granulosa cells made higher cleavage of embryo with the best grade of embryo quality and growth in Ham's F10 media decreased cleavage meanwhile increased cell fragmentation of embryos.Effect of calcitriol and of its analogues on expression of calcitonin gene in cultured cells of medullary thyroid carcinomaM Zabel 1,2  , K Flig 1 , E Gebarowska 1 1 Chair of Histology and Embryology, Wroclaw, Poland 2 Chair of Histology and Embryology, Poznan, Poland",

The purpose of this work was to identify specific chromosome regions or putative tumor suppressor loci that may be involved in the malignant evolution of these tumors. Results Regardless of the primary site, a significantly higher percentage of allelic imbalances (AI) was observed in PDECs than in WDETs (p= 0.012) with the only exception for 3 out of 8 nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors exhibiting multiple AI on chromosomes 11, 6q and 3p. A strong positive correlation between AI percentage and the Ki-67 proliferation index was detected considering both all tumors and WDETs alone (p=0.002 and p=0.001, respectively). Moreover, AI at 17p was the most frequent alteration observed in PDECs (92% of PDECs versus 4.8% of WDETs; p<0.01) together with 6q and 3p AI in gastric and 5q AI in colorectal PDECs, respectively. Conclusion These findings suggest the existence of two different molecular profiles associated with PDECs and WDETs. Since no specific molecular markers of malignancy can be defined with certainty, the ploidy status and the evaluation of the global level of chromosomal instability of the tumors appear to be the most informative genetic factors with prognostic significance.

Materials and methods Forty-six cases of ductal carcinoma of the breast were included in the current study. All biopsies were processed for electron microscopy and electron micrographs were taken at x3,600 magnification. Nucleolar area measurements were done using SigmaScanPro software and statistical analyses were performed. Nucleolar area measures were categorized in terciles. A Kaplan-Meier estimation was performed to assess those measures related with disease-free interval. Measures that reached statistical significance were dichotomized at the cut point with maximum likehood in a Cox Regression model and then were included in a multivariate analysis. Results Statistically significant differences were found in terciles per area (p=0.019) and per variation coefficient (p=0.012). In terms of nucleolar area measurements, any given nucleolar area with a standard deviation 3 1.5, showed a relative risk for recurrence of 4.05 (1.23-13.36 ) (p=0.02).Conclusions Ultrastructural morphometry shows that nucleolar features, particularly those related to size heterogeneity, have a significant impact on prognosis.",

Introduction Human papillomaviruses (HPV) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The male urogenital tract is considered to be a reservoir of HPV infection. Our previous finding of HPV in the squamous metaplastic epithelium with dysplasia in the epididymis prompted us to start a study focused on the presence of HPV in the male genital tract. Aims: Verifying the presence of HPV in the epididymis, ductus deferens and seminal vesicles. Materials and methods Samples from three groups (A, B, C) of patients were analysed by means of nested PCR for the presence of HPV DNA extracted from a paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Types of HPV were determined by DNA nucleotide sequencing of the PCR products. Group A consisted of 22 patients (mean age 61, age range 39-87, except for one patients 19 years old), group B consisted of 22 patients (mean age 73, age range 43-87, except for two patients 23 and 24 years old) and group C consisted of 44 patients (mean age 65, age range 50-82). Patients in group A were surgically treated for non-tuberculous epididymitis (41 epididymal Introduction Glucagonoma is an alpha-cell pancreatic neoplasm with incidence of one in 20 million; the malignancy rate is unknown. The clinical, pathologic, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy characteristics are described in a Mexican cohort of patients. Material and methods We reviewed the pathology archives of INCMyNSZ and HOCMNSXXI for pancreatic tumors with neuroendrocrine morphology and expression of immunohistochemistry markers for neuroendocrine and glucagon-related peptides. Complete clinical history and follow-up were achieved. Results Six cases of glucagonoma were obtained. Electron microscopy was available in two cases. Three man and three women with median age of 61.16 years, were admitted with glucagonoma syndrome complaints. The tumor localization was: head of pancreas (3/6) and tail (2/6), with average size of 6.4 cm. Two cases showed hepatic metastasis. The histopathologic study was constant with contrasting architectural, cytologic and mitotic count in all the cases. Expression of neuroendocrine markers was observed in all 6 cases, with positive glucagon stain, and negative for secretion markers (insulin, PP, serotonin, calcitonin). In electron microscopy, dense core granules were identified in two cases. Discussion There are 200 cases of glucagonoma described in English literature; no one is originated from Latin American population. In this series, the neoplasms have equal prevalence for female and male patients, all from elderly group. The morphologic feature extremely varies in each tumor, the malignancy criteria were correlated in two cases with vascular invasion and this coincides with metastasis. A peculiar finding are the only expression of glucagon in tumoral cells, and two malignant cases with liver metastasis. Estrogens regulate the development, maturation, and function of various organs, including the thymus. Therefore it is suggested that estrogens play important roles in the development of human thymoma. However there is no study about influences of sex steroids to human thymoma. In this study, we examined the immunohistochemical localization of sex steroid receptors for estrogen (ER)\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, progesterone (PR)-A and PR-B, and androgen (AR) in human thymoma (n=132), and correlated these findings with various clinicopathological parameters. We used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and realtime PCR to further study the expression of these receptors in 20 thymoma cases. Results Immunoreactivity for all sex steroid receptors was detected in the nuclei of thymoma epithelial cells. The percentage of immuno-positive cases and H-score values for each receptor (mean\u00b1SD) were: ER\u03b1, 65.9% and 85.8\u00b180.2; ER\u03b2, 6.8% and 7.2\u00b18.7; PR-A, 3.8% and 2.7\u00b14.9; PR-B, 49.2% and 55.8\u00b168.3, and AR, 15.2% and 14.1\u00b111.7, respectively. Results of real-time PCR were consistent with those of immunohistochemistry especially results for ER\u03b1, PR-B, and AR. A significant positive correlation was detected between immunoreactivity for ER\u03b1 and PR-B. ER\u03b1 immunoreactivity was inversely correlated with tumor size, clinical stage, WHO classification and Ki-67 labeling index. In addition, the status of ER\u03b1 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with a better clinical outcome in thymoma patients. Conclusions Sex hormones receptors express in human thymoma, and especially ER\u03b1 may be related to sex, clinical stage and pathological cell type.",

Biomedical Science and Human Oncology University of Turin, Turin, Italy 2 S. Andrea Hospital, University of Rome, Rome, Italy Introduction Galectin-3 was reported to distinguish follicular and papillary carcinomas of the thyroid from adenomas, but controversial results were obtained in oxyphilic cell tumors, possibly related to endogenous biotin reactivity. The aim of this study was to assess the role of galectin-3 immunodetection in a large series of benign and malignant oxyphilic tumors. Materials and methods Galectin-3 expression was retrospectively analysed in 137 thyroid oxyphilic (Hurthle) cell tumors, including 42 adenomas [OA], 66 carcinomas [OC], 29 oxyphilic variant of papillary carcinoma [OPTC] and in 28 control cases of goiter with oxyphilic changes and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. A purified Galectin-3 monoclonal antibody and a biotin-free immunoperoxidase procedure were used in paraffin embedded specimens. Results 60 of 66 OCs were focally (11 cases) or diffusely (49 cases) positive. 28/29 OPTC were focally (7 cases) or diffusely (21 cases) reactive. Overall, malignant oxyphilic tumors were positive in 93% (88/95). OA had a focal reactivity in 24% (10/42) of cases, with a preferential subcapsular immunostaining. Sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 76%, respectively. Control oxyphilic goiters were negative (0/13), as opposed to Hashimoto's thyroiditis (oxyphilic cells positive in 14/15 cases). Conclusion The role of Galectin-3 immunoreactivity in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant follicular lesions is confirmed also in oxyphilic cell tumors. The focal immunoreactivity observed in adenomas may be probably related to a true expression of Galectin-3, as confirmed by mRNA expression by means of in situ hybridisation, and could be related to early malignant changes in tumors still lacking the currently accepted morphological signs of malignancy. Introduction Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a very useful method for diagnosing various lesion in the thyroid gland, among them Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). Although many methods may be used, FNA is a necessary diagnostic procedure nowadays in order to confirm the diagnoisis of HT. Material and methods Durind a period of 2 years citologically 600 aspirates were citologically analyzed, stained with HE and MGG. The main cytological guidelines in the diagnostic procedure were: 1. lymphocytic cellularity of smears, 2. oncocytic follicular cells, 3. a lot of cellular debris. Results From 600 aspirates analyzed 35 (3,5%) were diagnosed as HT. There was a high statistical significance in sex and ages for the genesis of HT (\u03c7 2 =24,02; p=0,005). We analyzed correlation between clinical and cytological diagnosis: in 82 cases initial clinical diagnosis was \"Thyroiditis\", and among them 46 (56%) were cytologically confirmed. From 35 patients with an FNA diagnosis of HT the same diagnosis was susspected clinically in 23 cases (66%). Several authors noted a high incidence of thyroid carcinoma in patients with HT. We researched association of HT and thyroid tumors, and we did not confirm that HT is a premalignant lesion (\u03c7 2 =1,22, p<0,05). Conclusion HT and its association with other lesions could be clearly diagnosed with FNA, and we recommend FNA as a first line investigation in HT.",

HPV infection, especialy types 16, and 18 oncogene is directly associated with occurrence of preinvasive and invasive changes in the uterine cervix ranging from 36 -79%. Cyto-pathologic effect of this virus presence in a cell is called koilocytosis and occurs by the effect of fragment E4 on cytokeratin building protein.Koss observed these changes back in 1956, describing them as irregular cavities in cell protoplasm, but only later these cytologic findings were related to HPV infection. In our retrospective study we analyzed colposcopic and cytologic findings of 34 examinees in which the diagnose of HPV infection was established by biopsy. Material and methods The mean age of examinees was 30,8, and in regards to parity and menarche there was no statistically significant difference between experimental and control group, since coefficient t was lower than 1,90 p<00,5. Therefore we concluded that the sample was representative. Results Sensitivity of cytology in detection of HPV infection of the uterine cervix was 53,1% and the specificity was 64%. Positive predictive value was 85% and negative 65%. The most frequent colposcopic findings in the uterine cervix in case of HPV infection were aceto-white epithel in 34% and mosaic in 37%. Other colposcopic findings were significantly lower (punctate 19%, leucoplakia 7,3%). In examinees with colposcopically diagnosed HPV infection in external genitalia, the infection was also present in the uterine cervix in 82,6% which was statistically significant for X2 =29,7597>(X2 (1;0,16)=6,635). Conclusion Based on the results presented above, we concluded that sensitivity of cytology in the detection of HPV infection of the uterine cervix was low and that it was necessary to combine that method with colposcopy and directed biopsy. In case of colposcopically diagnosed condylomas of the external genitalia and presence of pathologic colposcopic findings of the uterine cervix (aceto-white epithel, mosaic), the presence of HPV infection in the uterine cervix can be expected with high probability.",

We investigated the expression, localization, rate of synthesis and composition of type I and III collagens in AS. Methods Type I and III collagen mRNA expression and the immunohistochemical localization of the collagen antigens were studied from 36 AS and 2 normal aortic valves. The concentrations of various type I (PINP, PICP, ICTP and synthetic peptide SP4) and III (PIIINP and IIINTP) collagen antigens were measured by radioimmnoassays in soluble tissue extracts and trypsin solubilized calcified and noncalcified matrices of 11 AS samples, and 24 healthy aortic valves of different ages. Results The synthesis of type I collagen, localized in the myofibro-blasts adjacent to calcified nodules, was 2-3 -fold higher in AS compared to controls. The proportion of collagen in total protein fraction was 90 % in the healthy valves, 50 % in the noncalcified matrix and 10 % in the calcified matrix of AS valves. In calcified valves the ICTP content was 6-fold higher than in the age matched controls and 2-fold higher than the young control group. In the controls, ICTP (r=-0.908, p<0.001) and IIINTP (r=-0.753, p<0.001) decreased with age, whereas SP4/ICTP ratio increased (r=0.538, p<0.01). Conclusions Type I collagen synthesis was increased in AS. Localization of this collagen adjacent to calcified nodules and the profile of the C-telopeptide cross-linking indicate that the ectopic aortic valve calcification may have similarities to bone matrix mineralization.Introduction The objective of this study was to determine the potential value of digital thermography (DT) for the assessment of micro-and macroangiopathies of lower limbs in diabetes mellitus (DM).",

Among TNFalpha positive cases, TNF-alpha mRNAs were greater in pts with more impaired cardiac function. Conclusion Our findings indicate that the expression of TNFalpha plays an important role in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis of any etiology and may influence severity of cardiac dysfunction. Cytokine effects are more strictly linked to overexpression of TNFRI.",

However, it occurs mostly in adults, it can also occur in children. The cutaneous form is one of the types of polyarteritis nodosa. It occurs in children very rarely. Polyarteritis nodosa is diagnosed on the basis of histopathologic results and clinical criteria established by the America College of Rheumatology. The aim of the study was to present 3 cases of polyarteritis nodosa in children. Case reports Three cases of cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa in 16year old girls and 1 case of general form of p.n. in a 14-year old boy At the beginning a tumour of pancreas head was suggested in the latter case. The final diagnoses in all cases were defined on the basis of histopathologic Results The morphologic studies showed: skin and subcutaneous tissue specimens of 10mm diameter and 15mm thick were evaluated. Epidermis and corium were of normal structure. Abundant inflammatory infiltration consisting of neutral and acidophilic granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasmatic cells were observed on the boarder of corium and subcutaneous tissue. The infiltration was situated mainly in arterial walls and surrounding fibrous and fatty connective tissue. Different degrees of change advancement were observed in the walls of the vessels. Some changes were characteristic for an early stage of a disease and were demonstrated as swelling of the vessel wall and surrounding tissues (degeneration stage). In the oedematous wall fibrin concrement and only a few inflammatory cells were present. Other cells included abundant transmural inflammatory infiltrations (inflammatory stage). Vessel endothelium underwent desquamation and thrombi begun to appear in the arterial lumen. Only in few vessels, the process of considerable advancement of changes was observed -a repair process with consecutive fibrosis and thickening of arterial wall with considerable narrowing of its lumen. The described children were treated successfully with corticosteroid therapy and antistreptococcal prophylaxis with long-term remission.",

Testicular torsion evokes infertility as a result of ischemia. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of a vasodilatator agent Sildenafile on the testicular damage following testicular torsion. Materials and methods Forty-two rats included to the study were divided into 7 groups: group 1; control, group 2; Sham, group 3: torsion (detorsion is performed 2 hours after torsion and orchiectomy is done at the 4th hour), group 4; torsion, detorsion and Sildenafile (1 mg/kg), group 5; torsion and Sildenafile (2 mg/kg), group 6; Sildenafile (1 mg/kg) without torsion, group 7; Sildenafile (2 mg/kg) without torsion. Testicular specimens were examined histopathologically for Johnsen tubular score and tubular diameter. The differences of these parameters between groups were evaluated statistically. Results Johnsen tubular score and tubular diameters were fond to be significantly different in control and torsion groups (p<0.05). Johnsen tubular score and tubular diameter were significantly higher in the torsion groups which were given Sildenafile, and these parameters were again higher in the group which have taken Sildenafile at a higher dose (p<0.05). Conclusion It is concluded that, by inhibiting cyclic guanosin monophosphate specific phosphodiesterase and resulting in vasodialatation, Sildenafile reduces the testicular damage caused by torsion (ischemia). Introduction autopsy studies in adult patients who had died of sepsis revealed a profound, progressive, apoptosis-induced loss of cells of the adaptive immune system (Hotchkiss et al, New Engl J Med, 2003; 348:138-150) . In neonatal sepsis and chorioamnionitis, thymus modifications and shrinkage have been exhaustively described (Toti et al, Hum Pathology 2000; 31:1121-1128), while morphology of the spleen has not. The aim of this study was to describe the morphology of the spleen in neonates with early onset sepsis and with chorioamnionitis. Material and methods the study population has been described previously (Toti et al, Hum Pathology 2000; 31:1121 -1128 . Ten preterm or full-term neonates who died because of proven sepsis within 48 hours after birth (mean gestational age\u00b1SD, 29.2\u00b16.2 weeks); 20 foetuses spontaneously aborted (22\u00b17.4 weeks) because of extensive ascending chorioamnionitis. Controls included 10 foetuses with induced termination of pregnancy (20\u00b12.4 weeks) and 10 babies who died suddenly in the perinatal period, without evidence of chorioamnionitis. Spleen cell populations were studied by means of immunohistochemistry. Results Early onset sepsis in the neonates occurred with severe spleen depletion, involving both B and T lymphocytes. In particular, CD20+, CD45R0+ and CD4+ cells were dramatically diminished in the spleen of neonates with sepsis, in comparison to controls. Foetuses with chorioamnionitis also showed spleen cell depletion. Conclusion These results indicate that preterm and term neonates show an inflammatory reaction similar to that of adult patients, and that chorioamnionitis is associated with an unspecific inflammatory response comparable to that of sepsis. Introduction Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a disorder of an immunological disturbance with proliferation of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, with the histiocyte as a central cell. It includes two different conditions: primary or familial HLH, an autosomal recessive disorder in which most patients develop the disease very early in life, and secondary HLH associated with neoplastic, autoimmune and a variety of infectious diseases, occurring as sporadic cases throughout life period. Clinically the disease is characterised by the occurrence of a hemophagocytic syndrome of prolonged fever and splenomegaly with laboratory signs of cytopenias, lipid, coagulation and liver abnormalities. Hemophagocytosis is readily identified in bone marrow, spleen or involved lymph nodes. Central nervous system spread of the disease may be present early, but is frequently seen later during the course of the disease. The aim of this study was to presentat an autopsy case of a 13 months old boy. Case report Signs of HLH were present right after birth. He was treated by the treatment protocol HLH-94. The disease later progressed with CNS involvement. A complementary bone marrow donor was not found in time.",

The patients were diagnosed and treated in paediatric university hospitals in Zabrze and Bytom in the years 2001-2002. Specimens were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H.E.) and alcian blue-PAS (AB-PAS). Villous atrophy was evaluated according to the modified Marshal scale. Results The following types were defined: type 0 -33 cases, type 1 -8 cases, type 2 -6 cases, type 3a -9 cases, type 3b -21 cases, type 3c -3 cases. Then, a number of goblet cells per 100 enterocytes of small intestine epithelium of each oligobioptate were calculated. The received results were evaluated statistically with U Mann-Whitney test.

Conclusions Significant relation between a number of goblet cells in epithelium and a degree of small intestine mucous atrophy in celiac disease. It allows an introduction of a new objective quantitive parameter in the evaluation of atrophic lesions. Introduction Microscopic evaluation plays an important role in diagnosing small intestine inflammatory diseases. Defining a degree of villous and brush border atrophy, enterocytes changes, elongation of glandular crypts allows a correct evaluation of treatment clinical effects and child's body response to the applied selective diet. Development of immunomorphological studies contributed to confirmation of the autoimmunological basis of several diseases and of the influence of exogenous factors on their development. Due to the new approach, evaluation of the changeable character of inflammatory infiltrations including mast cells and marking activity of enteroendocrinal cells have become very important diagnostic elements. The aim of the study is to examine a changeable intensity of infiltrations from mast cells of small intestine mucosa in children in the course of celiac disease. Material and method Oligobioptates of small intestine mucosa taken in endoscopy from 500 patients (age 0-18 years) at the Department of Pathomorphology in Zabrze in the years 1998-2002. The patients were diagnosed and/or hospitalised in paediatric university hospitals in Zabrze and Bytom. A degree of villus atrophy was evaluated according to the modified Marsh classification. Tissue material in paraffin cubes from the routine oligobiopsy of the patients with celiac disease was qualified for immunohistochemical study. Immunohistochemical reactions revealed a presence of brown dyed mass cells in intestine mucosa. The cells were evaluated by counting their number in 5 high power fields (magnification 400x) in each oligobioptate. The received results were calculated statistically with Mann-Whitney U test. Results Mean number of mass cells in intestine mucosa was calculated in relation to the degree of villus atrophy according to the modified Marsh classification: type 0 (status normalis) -7.55 (+/-2.23), type 1 -13.59 (+/-5.20), type 2 -17.62 (+/-1.94), type 3a -20.82 (+/-6.10), type 3b -27.94 (+/-4.59), type 3c -34.31 (+/-3.61). The analysis showed significant relation between a number of mass cells and a degree of mucosa atrophy in a course of celiac disease. Moreover, a correlation after the Rang Spearman test showed a coefficient R=0.8151 for p<0.000001. Conclusions Significant relation between a number of mass cells and a degree of small intestine mucosa atrophy in a course of celiac disease was shown. Defining (marking) a number of mass cells in small intestine mucosa in a course of celiac disease allows an introduction of quantitive method of atrophic changes evaluation as a new objective parameter, especially in cases difficult to diagnose.",

These mediators have a pronounced role in mediation and modulation of inflammation. Most non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) act mainly by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, thereby diverting it towards the lipoxygenase pathway. These leukotrienes are important in maintenance of acute and chronic inflammatory condition. Methods In present study, we used mofebutazone (cylcooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor) and tenoxicam (cylcooxygenase inhibitor) either alone or in combination with praziquantel (antibilharzial drug) in mice infected with Schistosomiasis mansoni. We study their effects on liver pathology as PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), granuloma diameters, percent of degenerated ova and type of granuloma after 10&14 weeks after infection. Results shown that infection increased the percent of positive nuclei in granuloma and in hepatocytes to be about 72% & 82% at 10 weeks and these percentages were reduced to be about 37% & 43% at 14 weeks after infection respectively. Treatment with mofebutazone and tenoxicam produced a reduction in PCNA to be about 33% & 40% in granuloma and 36% & 44% in hepatocytes at 8 weeks and more reduction occurred after 14 weeks after infection. Also, mofebutazone tended to produce more protection to isolated hepatocytes (% viability of hepatocyte) than tenoxicam in Schistosomiasis mansoni infected mice. Combined therapy with praziquantel produced more reduction in PCNA and more protection to hepatocytes. It is evident from the present study that, mofebutazone when combined with praziquantel has shown good tolerability more than tenoxicam which was associated with an improvement in PCNA, granuloma diameter, % viability of isolated hepatocytes, liver function tests, a fact that would seen to advocate the use of mofebutazone in bilharzial patient.",

The main objective of this work is to study the different patterns of injuries in car and motorcycle fatalities. Material and methods We have studied the autopsy reports of 34 deaths related to road traffic accidents (25 involving cars and 9 motorcycles). A complete autopsy was performed in every case including toxicological investigation. Results The most common cause of death was head injury, responsible for 52% and 66.6% of deaths in car and motorcycle accidents, respectively. Cranial base fractures were more commonly found in passengers rather than in drivers, both for cars and motorcycles (40% vs. 30% and 33.3% vs. 50%, respectively). The distribution of cranial vault fractures was similar with percentages of 15 and 12.6 for car and motorcycle drivers, versus 40 and 50 per cent for the respective passengers. Nevertheless, brain injury was even more frequent in car accidents, accounting for 60% of the cases, and in motorcycle fatalities, where every single case showed some degree of brain injury. Conclusion Our results confirm the importance of head injury in road-traffic accidents, especially when motorcycles are involved, being the most common cause of death. Although all motorcycle victims wore a helmet at the time of the accident, it did not seem to provide an effective protection, probably because of the high speeds involved. The incidence of cranial fractures and brain injury is higher for passengers than for drivers, probably due to the lack of attention to the traffic of these latter, and the fact that drivers are usually holding the handlebar or wheel at the moment of the accident.",

HIER has increased the number of primary antibodies useful on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material and in general improved the histochemical staining. The aim of this study was to compare various buffers for HIER on a broad range of primary antibodies. Materials and methods HIER using four different buffers (citrate pH6; Tris/EDTA pH9; DakoCytomation Target Retrieval Solution, High pH, code No. S 3307 and DakoCytomation Target Retrieval Solution pH6, code No S 1700) for pre-treatment of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material has been compared using more than 120 different primary antibodies and the EnVision+TM visualisation system.Results HIER with citrate buffer retrieve epitopes recognised by the majority of the tested antibodies. However, in several cases the epitopes could not be detected using this method but were retrieved using Tris/EDTA and/or Target Retrieval Solution, code No. S 1700. Also retrieval by means of the Target Retrieval Solution, High pH can be used however, the morphology quite often was partly destroyed. Furthermore, some antibodies could only be used after enzymatic pre-treatment whereas HIER abolished the histochemical staining. Conclusion Although HIER using citrate pH6 buffer is a standardised and widely used technique, it is in numerous cases sub-optimal or even obliterate the immunohistochemical staining.

The first post mortem was done in Vilnius by a priest, Stefan Bisio only in 1770 year. At the end of the 18th century, Jakub Briotet, a surgeon and anatomist, created a modest anatomical surgery (study). In 1804, Jan Piotr Frank and his son J\u00f3zef arrived to Vilnius and became professors of the University. Jan Piotr Frank became the Head of the Teaching Hospital and J\u00f3zef Frank the Head of the Chair of Pathology. In November 1804, he started lecturing for students, which he recalled in his \"Memoirs\": Several days after my father, I also started a course with a dissertation \"De meliori pathologiam tradendi modo\" In this speech I put the main stress on a significance of the explanations at the patient's bed-side and of a good knowledge of pathological anatomy\u2026 When in 1805, J\u00f3zef Frank became the Head of the Teaching Hospital, he founded the first anatomo-pathological study (surgery).

In 1808, the Emperor Alexander I destined the ruins of the Spaska's Orthodox Church for an anatomical theater. After seven-year redecorations, the building was opened in 1815. Besides the theatre itself, dissection room and Veterinary Institute, it also included a zoological, veterinary and anatomical museum. The growing anatomical museum had, in 1841, 2881 preparations including 1239 anatomopathological preparations. After closing down the Vilnius University and foundation of the Academy of Medicine and Surgery, pathological anatomy was made an individual subject of study. The first lecturer of pathological anatomy in Vilnius was Ludwik Siewruk. He held the classes till 1840 and then he took charge of the Chair of Anatomy at the Moscow University. His successor was Jan Leonow who continued his work until the tsar's authorities closed down the Academy of Medicine and Surgery in 1842. After the Academy had been closed down, all the exhibits of the Vilnius anatomical museum, including anatomopathological preparations were moved to the anatomical museum of Kiev University. Few of them remained in the Vilnius Medical Society. Introduction T-2 toxin, a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium fungi, is a well-known cardiotoxin that cause myocardial injury, capillary damage, haemorrhage and focal polymorphonuclear cell infiltration. Mast cell (MC) is one of the the earliest multifunctional effector cells of the immune system and important constituent of microvasulature in the heart. Aim: We wanted to investigate appearance and localisation of mast cells in the heart of T-2 toxin-poisoned rats. Materials and methods Adult female Wistar rats were poisoned with a single injection of 1 LD-50 of T-2 toxin (0.18 mg/kg sc). Rats were divided into two groups: (1) control group and (2) T-2 toxin group. T-2 toxin was produced in laboratory conditions from Fusarium sporotrichoides fungi. Animals were sacrificed after the end of the day 1, 3, 5 and 7 of the study. Cardiac MCs were counted in whole visual fields, magnified by 40-fold on paraffin section stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Giemsa methods. Results In the heart of rats treated with T-2 toxin, blood vessels were congested with thickned walls, and a large number of mononuclear cells was present nearby. 24 hours after administration of Introduction Bromadiolone is one of the most commonly used rodenticides. This coumarin anticoagulant blocks multiple steps in the coagulation cascade. It is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and accumulated in the liver, mainly. The aim of this study was to investigate pathohistological alterations in the liver after oral application of bromadiolone in rodents. Materials and methods Adult Wistar rats and Swiss mice, of both sexes, were fed with a ready-to-use baits of low bromadiolone concentration (0.005%), for first three consecutive days. Animals were sacrificed every day during the one week period, starting with 24h after the beginning of the experiment. Liver paraffin sections were stained by haematoxillin and eosin (HE) method. Results The pathological alterations detected in all animals ranged from diffuse degeneration to a focal necrosis of hepatocytes and massive circulatory changes. Parenchymal degeneration, diffuse oedema and hyperemia were predominant in the liver of animals sacrificed on the first three days of experiment. Dissolution of cytoplasm with nuclear pleomorphism in round or ovoid hepatocytes were seen. Thickening of the blood vessels with necrosis of endothelial cells were particularly prominent from the fourth to seventh day of experiment. The most interesting finding is the presence of massive hemorrhages with a focal mononuclear cell infiltrations. The majority of hepatocytes were irregular, with macronodular fat transformation of cytoplasm. These changes were the most intensive in male mice on the day 7 of the study. Conclusion Multiple oral ingestion of bromadiolone induced prominent pathohistological alterations in rodent liver, especially mice.",

Mostly two areas of diagnostic work are so far covered by telepathology service -second opinion/expert consultation and frozen section diagnosis. Frozen section diagnosis, is still a very important issue. Smaller hospitals, with no sufficient material for a resident pathologist often could benefit by introduction of telepathology. As in many of these hospitals surgery requiring frozen section diagnosis is not performed on a daily basis the telepathology system is not in full use, producing an unfavorable cost-benefit ratio. Also establishing a fully equipped frozen-sections lab yields additional costs and personnel cutting frozen sections only occasionally often produce suboptimal. In this the introduction of a mobile telepathology unit could solve some very important problems. The unit should include a fully equipped mobile frozen sections lab including a macro stand and a microscope with CCD TV color camera and a notebook (laptop) computer. The telepathology software used must be stabile and versatile like the Pharos/ISSA system (VAMSTECH, Croatia) used by us. By such a system and synchronization of operation schedules hospitals in a radius of up to 200 km around the referral center could be covered without exceeding standard working hours. The ISSA-server based system option alerting the consultant and referring pathologist by SMS that a consultation case is in his mailbox at the server ads additional time effectiveness.",

Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada High throughput genetic and expression screening is generating many possible diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for wide variety of clinical conditions. The rapid validation of these markers is a challenging process. Tissue microarrays can be used for the evaluation of many of these markers. However, they have drawbacks and unresolved issues, which are result of the sampling and sectioning problems. We introduce a novel microarray technique based on cell suspensions. Multiple slides can be made, all of which are equally representative of the initial samples. A manually operated mechanical device was designed that can deposit 60 distinct spots on the glass slide. Each spot of cells deposited in this manner may correspond to unique source. Controlling the number of cells per spot their uniformity and size can be achieved by modifying the viscosity of the cell solution or precisely regulating amount of fluid deposited. A fully automated analysis of quantitatively stained microarray samples has been performed to quantify the number of cells per spot, the size of spots, and how reproducible these parameters are. Cellular material used in the experimental arrays constructed to date has been acquired from cell lines and liquid prepared lung and cervical specimens. A variety of molecular markers can be evaluated, with minimal cost. FISH probes have been tested on cytology microarrays constructed from 20 different lung cell lines. Using cell suspensions generated by the dissociation of tissue would enable the creation of more representative samples for clinical marker/target validation or evaluation.",
