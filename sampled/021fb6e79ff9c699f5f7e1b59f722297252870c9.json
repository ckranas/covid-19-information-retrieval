Its inhibitor, bortezomib, is a plasma cell-targeted therapy used in AMR. However, to limit its off-target effects, it is dosed suboptimally. Here, we show that an inducible subset of the proteasomes, immunoproteasomes (IP or i-20S), is enriched in immunocytes such as T and B cells and replace c-20S upon activation. C-20S and i-20S differ only in 3 proteolytic subunits. We hypothesized that i-20S inhibition would target B cell activation, memory B cells, and antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and limit systemic toxicity. We developed specifi c, non-covalent, small-molecule b5i inhibitors with improved pharmacokinetic properties, asparagine ethylenediamines (AsnEDAs), which are highly potent and kinetically noncompetitive. We also present a highresolution cryo-EM structure of the human immunoproteasome with an AsnEDA PKS21004 with a resolution of 3.8\u00c5. We differentiated human B cells into CD19 + CD38 + CD27 + ASCs in the presence of IL-2 and TLR-7/8 agonist R848 for fi ve days. These were then exposed to IP inhibition (IPI). The percentage of viable ASCs decreased with IPI treatment in a dose and time-dependent manner, while the PBMCs overall were not affectedexplained by enhanced apoptosis of the ASCs. Apoptosis of CD19 + non-ASCs was slightly enhanced, but not that of CD19cells. Similarly, IPI did not affect the viability of CD19or CD19 + non-ASCs (5 separate experiments, *P<0.05). C57BL/6 recipients of BALB/c hearts treated with sCTLA4-Ig (250 \u03bcg on day 2) and 2-week IPI injections (25 mg/kg/day) showed indefi nite heart survival compared to the control (sCTLA4-Ig + vehicle) (MST>100 vs. 30 days, n=6/group, *P<0.05). Activated andmemory B cells, and plasma cells were signifi cantly reduced in the spleen and bone marrow of IPI-treated mice compared to the vehicle (*P<0.05, n=6-8/group). Subsequently, IPI-treatment signifi cantly decreased DSAs measured in the serum of heart allograft recipients (*P<0.05, n=6-8/group). In all, we designed a novel plasma-cell targeted inhibitor that will have a signifi cant impact on the treatment of AMR.",

We have tested new therapies in marginal sized (3, (0) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) ,000IEQ/kg) allogeneic islet transplants in NHPs. We transplanted allogeneic islets, into recipients treated with anti-CD40mAb (2C10R4) D- 0, 14, 28, 60, 90, 120 , RPM D-0-120) +/-alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) D- 1, 3, 7, 10) . In the second set of experiments we cultured islets in AAT overnight and transplanted marginally sized islets (2,000-5,000IEQ/ kg) into MHC mismatched recipients treated with anti-CD40mAb+RPM+IL-2 (at day 160 post-Tx). Using state-of-the-art techniques for CyTOF and SOMAscan we are now able to individualize treatment for each animal. Results: AAT given as an adjunct to anti-CD40mAb+RPM is effective and safe in NHP recipients of islet transplants. Results in terms of transplant function are far superior to that obtained anti-CD40mAb+RPM alone. In 5 NHPs transplanted without AAT, graft survival was 169-217 days despite cessation of treatment at day 120 posttransplant. In 5 NHP recipients of marginally sized islet transplants receiving AAT as an adjunct, the graft functioned without need for insulin treatment 193-310 days post-transplant. In the second set of experiments, 3 NHPs were transplanted with exceptionally small islet allografts. The islets cultured with AAT and transplanted into recipients treated with anti-CD40mAb+RPM+ IL-2. In the absence of insulin treatment, the recipients quickly became and remained normoglycemic for 200-360 days post-transplant. Using CytOF we were able to individualize the IL-2 doses needed for Treg expansion without expending other immune cells like Teff and NK. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that adjunctive AAT given with an anti-CD40mAb based regimen is effi cacious in the NHP islet allograft model: (1) by blocking infl ammation with a brief dose of AAT marginally sized islets functioned well for almost a year without the need of insulin despite cessation of treatment at day 120 (2) substitution of in vivo AAT treated islets promoted immediate and long-term function of tiny islet allografts. Transplantation of only 2,000 IEQ/kg can be used to achieve immunosuppressive drug-free insulin independence in NHPs for prolonged period (3) ",

Naziruddin. 3 1 Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan; 2 Baylor Scott and White Research Institute, Dallas; 3 Baylor Simmons Transplant Institute, Dallas. Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) is an effective treatment for refractory chronic pancreatitis. Repeated or continuous pancreatitis attack leads islet damage beyond infl amed exocrine tissue. A preventive treatment approach during pancreatitis is important to improve success of islet autotransplantation. NFkB is a major transcriptional factor that regulates proinfl ammatory cytokine production. We studied the effect of Withaferin A, a plant-derived NFkB inhibitor on the suppression cytokine production in islets using a cerulein-induced pancreatitis mouse model and the outcome of syngeneic transplantation. Cerulein (CE) was administered intra-peritoneal into C57BL/6J mice by seven hourly injections for one day per week for 4 weeks to establish chronic pancreatitis. In the treatment group, Withaferin A (WA) was administered intraperitoneal in the same day of CE injection. Islets were isolated from pancreas after 1month of CE injection with/without WA, and they were transplanted into STZ-induced diabetic syngeneic mice. Islets isolated from the CE group showed signifi cant increase in mRNAs of major proinfl ammatory cytokines / chemokines, IL-6, TNFa, HMGB1, IFN\u03b3, and IP-10 and WA treatment suppressed them. Moreover apoptosis-related genes, Bak, Bax, and XBP1 were upregulated in the islets of the CE-treated mice, while WA reduced their expression. Islets isolated WA-treated pancreatitis mice were more effi cient in restoring normoglycemia when compared to CE-treated mice.",

Tissue-specifi c ECM, attained through decellularization (decel), has been proposed in many regenerative strategies for tissue and organ replacement. Decel of animal pancreata has been reported, but similar methods applied to human pancreas are less effective due to high lipid content. ECM-derived hydrogel can be made from many tissues, but human pancreas-derived hydrogel has not been reported. Our objective is to produce an acellular biological scaffold from human pancreas ECM (hP-ECM) for use in tissue culture and transplantation platforms. Human pancreata (Fig.1a) were decelled with spin and homogenization techniques, using physical and chemical treatments to isolate hP-ECM (1b). hP-ECM was pepsin digested (1c), neutralized and warmed to 37\u00b0C to form hP-ECM hydrogel (hP-HG)(1d). hP-ECM and hP-HG were examined for lipid and DNA removal, and retention of ECM protein and glycosaminoglycan (GAG). Cytocompatibility of hP-HG was tested in vitro (1e) and immune response to hP-HG was assessed in vivo (1f). Lipid content is signifi cantly reduced following homogenize-decel compared to spin-decel; lipid removal signifi cantly enhanced gelation of hP-HG. DNA content is signifi cantly reduced in the hP-ECM (4.2%) and hP-HG (0.44%) compared to the native pancreas (100%) while GAG content is moderately retained in the hP-ECM (20.8%) and hP-HG (4.0%). hP-ECM and hP-HG stain positively for Col1, Col4 and Laminin, but negatively for immunogenic proteins such as HLA Class I and II. hP-HG is cytocompatible with the beta cell line hINS-1, which grows on hP-HG with equal profi ciency as on Col1 or uncoated surfaces. When hPSC-derived pancreatic progenitor cells were embedded in hP-HG the cells retained their Pdx1 + fate, were proliferative (Ki67) and had a low apoptosis phenotype (Casp3). hP-HG transplanted into humanized mice had minimal cellular infi ltrate, whereas antigenic tissue was acutely infi ltrated by human T cells (CD3) and B cells (CD20). Conclusion: We developed a novel protocol for the decel of human pancreas and the production of hP-ECM and hP-HG scaffolds suitable for cell culture and transplantation applications. ",

Darden, 1 B. Naziruddin, 2 M. Lawrence. 1 1 Islet Cell Lab, Baylor Scott & White Research Institute, Dallas, TX; 2 Transplantation, Baylor Simmons Transplant Institute, Dallas, TX. Purpose: To identify isletokines released by exosomes from human islets that have been exposed to hypoxic or infl ammatory conditions and defi ne stress signaling pathways that can be targeted to suppress their expression and improve islet graft survival during transplantation. Methods: Human islets were subjected to hypoxic and infl ammatory conditions. Exosomes were recovered and isolated from the medium and characterized by TEM and surface marker expression. Luminex multiplex assays were performed to identify isletokines recovered from islet exosomes. Western blot analysis was performed to identify activation of signaling components in islets exposed to hypoxia and cytokines. The phytochemical Withaferin A (WA) was used to block isletokine induction in islets, and effects of WA on stress-signaling components in islets were defi ned. Results: Human islets exposed to hypoxia and proinfl ammatory cytokines showed activation of mTOR/AKT/GSK3\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB stress signaling pathways resulting in release of exosomes containing IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and CXCL10. Exosomal isletokines were suppressed by pretreatment with WA. Suppression of isletokines by WA correlated with inhibition of AKT and mTOR signaling, but was independent of GSK3\u03b2 activation. WA also blocked induction of canonical NF-\u03baB RelA/p65 signaling indicating its requirement for exosomal isletokine expression. Conclusion: The study identifi es exosomal isletokines produced by stressed islets that are known to induce islet infl ammation upon transplantation. These fi ndings indicate that AKT-mTOR and NF-\u03baB stress-induced signaling can be targeted to suppress exosomal expression of isletokines to prevent early innate immune destruction of islets during transplantation to improve transplant outcomes.",

            "text": "Introduction: Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) contributes to delayed graft function (DGF). IRI/DGF in HLA-sensitized (HS) patients likely activates innate and memory injury pathways that may contribute to poor outcomes. C1INH is a serpin (serine protease inhibitor) that inhibits the classic and mannose binding lectin/mannose associated serine protease pathways (MBL/MASP). Here we report outcomes of a Phase I/II placebo-controlled study investigating the safety & effi cacy of C1INH to reduce DGF in a cohort of HS patients receiving DD kidney transplants after desensitization. Conclusions: C1INH appeared to offer a benefi t in HS patients in protecting patients from early ABMR associated graft loss. Though not signifi cant, need for dialysis @3-4 weeks as well as renal function @12M & 24M post transplant were numerically superior in C1INH treated group. Therefore, prevention strategies with emphasis on therapeutic targets could improve longterm outcomes in patients w. IRI/DGF. (AMR 3.04%\u00b12.12% vs Control 0.63%\u00b10.18%, P<0.05; AMR 1.72%\u00b11.41% vs Control 0.63%\u00b10.18%, P<0.05; ANOVA P<0.01). The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) was 0.97 (95% confi dence interval [95%CI], 0.96 to 1.00) and 0.84 (95%CI, 0.65 to 1.00) respectively for the discrimination of AMR or dnDSA from the control group. Positive and negative predictive values for AMR at a cutoff of 1.0% dd-cfDNA were 94.1% and 84.6%, respectively. Positive and negative likelihood ratios for AMR at a cutoff of 1.0% dd-cfDNA were 10.7 and 0.12, respectively. Conclusions: Donor-derived cfDNA may be used to assess allograft injury in AMR and recipients with dnDSA but no histological lesions. Donor-derived cfDNA levels <1% refl ect the absence of AMR and levels >1% indicate a probability of injury in dnDSA (+) recipients. KDRI is an estimate of post-transplant kidney graft failure. It is based on ten donor factors that independently affect transplant outcomes, including HCV status from serologic or NAT testing. With NAT now reported, further evaluation of these donors is now possible. Methods: We conducted a retrospective matched case-control analysis of adult deceased donor kidney transplants performed between 12/5/2014 to 12/31/2016 obtained from UNOS databse. We identifi ed kidney transplants that had both KDRI score and HCV Ab and NAT testing status. We compared 205 aviremic Hep C Ab+ NAT -kidney transplants to KDRI matched control kidneys that were Hep C Ab-NAT-. Results: The aviremic HCV kidneys were recovered from donors that were signifi cantly younger 34.1\u00b18.6 vs 42.6\u00b110.4 years old, more likely to be white 183(89.3%) vs 1554(68.9%), less likely to have hypertension and diabetes. They were less likely to be DCD 13 vs 518 (P<0.0001). The majority of the recipients of the aviremic HCV kidneys when compared to match controls were Hepatitis C positive 90.2% vs 4.3%. The recipients were signifi cantly older 59.5\u00b17.4 vs 53.2\u00b113.1 years old (P< 0.0001) and more likely to be male 162 (79%) vs 1378(61.1%) (P <0.0001). They were less likely to be white. They were more likely to be diabetic 105 (51.2%) vs 882(39.1%) (P=0.001).They were on dialysis for a shorter period of time 1175 \u00b1 886 days vs 1949 \u00b1 1311 days (P <0.0001) and were transplanted sooner 432 \u00b1 556 vs 938.6 \u00b1884 days (P <0.0001). The graft survival of aviremic HCV kidneys when compared to non-Hep C kidneys trended to be superior ( Figure 1 ). If the HCV status of the aviremic kidneys were assumed to be negative, 122 more kidneys could have been allocated to patients with EPTS <20. Seven kidneys would no longer have KDPI>85%. Conclusion: Further policies might consider these fi ndings to appropriately allocate these kidneys to potentially extend graft survival and limit the organ discard rate. Figure 1 : HCV Ab+NAT-kidney allograft survival compared non-Hepatitis C kidneys Ab-NAT-Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in kidney transplant (KTx) donors or recipients has correlated with adverse outcomes, partly due to limited treatment options. Development of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) revolutionized management of HCV, offering safe and effective therapies that may be used after KTx. We integrated SRTR data with records from a national pharmaceutical claims warehouse (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) to identify HCV treatments after KTx. Pharmacy fi lls for of HCV treatments were assessed before and after 1/2014, representing pre-DAA (N=100,497) and post-DAA (N=57,367) eras. Treatment patterns were stratifi ed by donor (D) and recipient (R) HCV serostatus. Pharmacy fi lls for HCV treatments after KTx increased sharply in the post-DAA era, driven by sofosbuvir regimens, along with newer agents approved in 2016 (Fig 1) . Among HCV D+/R+ recipients, the cumulative incidence of HCV treatment by 1yr post-KTx increased >10-fold in the post-DAA era, from 0.6% to 10.8% (Fig  2) . HCV treatment also increased 10-fold in HCV D-/R+ recipients, from 0.3% to 3.0% at 1yr post-KTx. HCV D+/R-KTx was uncommon (0.2% and 0.5% of KTx in the pre-and post-DAA eras, respectively), but HCV treatments also increased in this group in the post-DAA era (from 0.3% to 5.3% by 1yr). In parallel with expanded HCV treatment options, HCV D+ KTx rose from 1.6% to 2.4% after 1/2014. There were not signifi cant differences in the nature of relationships between",

Background We distinguish an altruistic donor from the traditional living donor when a living person's offer to donate an organ is to \"anyone\" and not attached to a specifi c individual recipient. Altruistic kidney donation from living donors is an uncommon but growing practice with paucity of data in the recent literature regarding trends in altruistic donation.

Results There were 245 altruistic donor inquires during this 4 year period with a 1.5 fold increase from 2014 to 2015 (Figure) . Mean age at inquiry was 38 years and 64% were women, 81% self-identifi ed as white race/ethnicity (Table) . Thirty nine percent failed the initial screening process (n=95) while another 45% (n=111) were lost to follow up after passing the initial screen. Those lost to follow-up had the highest BMI (35.6kg/m 2 ). Thirty two out of the original 245 or 13% completed the full donor evaluation and at last follow up 66% of these were approved and went on to donate. Altruistic donors who completed evaluation and donated had a mean age of 42 years, were more likely to be white (81%) and female (52%)( Table) . Conclusions Evaluation of the potential altruistic donor is labor intensive with only 9% of donor inquires resulting into living kidney donation. Obesity appears to be a signifi cant reason for the loss to follow up. However donors who pass the initial screen and remain highly motivated to undergo a full evaluation have a high conversion rate for approval and donation at 66%. It will be important to compare the conversion rate to non-altruistic donors to determine if specifi c policies for evaluating altruistic donors and identifi cation of dedicated personal to follow this potential living organ donor pool are warranted. Little is known if a kidney from a hypertensive donor performs equally compared to a kidney from a non-hypertensive donor. The present study examines the effect of a kidney transplant from hypertensive donors regarding blood pressure, kidney function and histologic changes in recipients. Retrospective single center analysis of 189 (age>18, transplantation date 2008-2015) living donor kidney recipients. Recipients were followed up for one year after transplantation. Hypertension in donors was defi ned as being on one or more antihypertensive drugs or having a blood pressure >135/85 on ABPM. GFR was estimated using the CKD-Epi equation. Implantation biopsy data was available in 168 patients and one year protocol data was available in 161 patients. Biopsies were regarded as representative if they included four or more glomeruli. All biopsies were reviewed by the same experienced nephropathologist blinded to donor hypertension status.",

However, the degree of this compensatory hypertrophy varies from donor to donor and the factors related to the degree of this mechanism are little known. Materials and Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 103 living donors of whom completed one-year follow up after the laparoscopic donor nephrectomy from 2011 to 2016 in our institution. Of these, 39 cases were defi ned as suboptimal compensatory hypertrophy group. The defi nition of this group was as follows: If 1) 1-year eGFR was less than 60% of baseline eGFR, and if 2) 1-year eGFR was less than predicted one calculated by the correlation coeffi cient method. The rest of the donors were defi ned as a control (compensatory hypertrophy group, n=64). We investigated the factors related to the suboptimal recovery of the renal function after living donor nephrectomy. Result:Although baseline eGFRs were the same in the two groups (control: 82.4\u00b113.5mL/min/1.73m2 vs suboptimal compensatory hypertrophy group: 82.9\u00b114.4mL/min/1.73m2, p=0.88), donor age (control: 55.8\u00b110.4 years old vs suboptimal compensatory hypertrophy group: 61.1\u00b18.5 years old, p=0.009), hemoglobin A1c (control: 5.3\u00b10.38mg/dl vs suboptimal compensatory hypertrophy group: 5.5\u00b10.42mg/dl, p=0.002) and uric acid (control: 4.8\u00b11.1mg/ dl vs suboptimal compensatory hypertrophy group: 5.5\u00b11.3mg/dl, p=0.005) were signifi cantly higher in the suboptimal compensatory hypertrophy group compared to the control. Pathological chronicity fi nding on one-hour biopsy (ah\u22651 + ct+ci\u22651) were much higher in the suboptimal compensatory hypertrophy group than the control (control: 6.5% vs suboptimal compensatory hypertrophy group: 26.3%, p=0.008). After the multivariate logistic regression analysis, pathological chronicity fi nding (odds ratio 4.3, 95% confi dence interval 1. 1-15.9, p=0 .031) and higher hemoglobin A1c level (per 0.1%: odd ratio 1.2, 95% confi dence interval 1. 0-1.3, p=0 .014) were found to be independent risk factors for suboptimal compensatory hypertrophy. Conclusion:Pathological chronicity fi nding on one-hour biopsy and higher hemoglobin A1c level were associated with suboptimal recovery of the one-year renal function after living donor nephrectomy.

Factors Related to Suboptimal Recovery of Renal Function after Living Donor Nephrectomy Am J Transplant. 2018; 18 (suppl 4 Background: De novo donor surface antibody (dnDSA) development is arguably the fi rst step in the natural history of allograft injury secondary to humoral alloimmunity. This project aims to investigate the association between eplet mismatches (MM) and the development of dnDSA in a pediatric population. Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of pediatric renal transplant recipients from 2008 to 2014 who underwent surveillance dnDSA testing with at least three years of follow up. We used the National Marrow Donor Program's Haplostats platform to impute high resolution HLA alleles (A, B, C, DR, and DQ\u03b2) from recipient and donor low resolution HLA alleles selecting the most commonly matched high resolution typing. We then generated eplet mismatches using HLA matchmaker version 2.0. We used multivariable Cox modeling to estimate associations between dichotomized MM counts (Class I & Class II total MM >10 vs. \u226410, DR & DQ\u03b2 >5 vs. \u22645) and dnDSA development. Covariates included age at transplant, gender and donor type. Results: A total of 126 subjects (median age 13 years, 64% male) met inclusion criteria. Of the 126 subjects, 50% developed any dnDSA (surveillance or for cause) during follow-up with a median time from transplant of 19.3 months. In models including both dichotomized Class I and Class II variables, Class II MM count >10 was independently associated with increased risk of dnDSA development (HR 3.39, p<0 .01) while the association with Class I MM count >10 failed to reach statistical signifi cance (HR 1.70, p=0.14) . DR >5 MM alone was associated with increased risk of dnDSA development (HR 1.70, 95% CI: 1.00-2.88, p=0.048) while DQ\u03b2 >5 alone was not (HR 1.45, p=0.17) .",

            "text": "Conclusions: Class II eplet mismatches are a strong independent predictor of dnDSA development in pediatric renal transplant recipients. Under the current kidney allocation system (KAS), pediatric (PED) renal transplant (RTx) candidates have a priority to kidneys from KDPI <35% donors. However, that excludes very highly sensitized (HS, CPRA 98-100%) adult RTx candidates among other exclusions. We hypothesized that graft survival (GS) and patient survival (PS) in PED RTx recipients is superior to those of adult HS RTx recipients. We analyzed OPTN data for RTx from 2005 to 2016. We analyzed 3-year PS and GS for PED RTx compared to HS adult RTx and adult RTx recipients with different degrees of sensitization using log-rank tests. We found that for KDPI <35% donors, PED RTx recipients had a better 3-year PS compared to both fi rst time and repeat adult HS RTx recipients (p <0.0001), while 3-year GS was only superior when compared to HS adult RTx recipients with a prior Tx (p=0.0038, multiple comparisons adjusted 0.0784). For donors with KDPI 35-85%, again 3-year PS was superior in PED RTx recipients compared to HS adult RTx recipients (p<0.0001), but 3-year GS was not different. The lack of GS benefi t in PED RTx recipients is an interesting fi nding that warrants further study. We speculate that potential causes include non-adherence in adolescent patients, recurrent disease, and technical factors in the youngest patients. Many in the pediatric RTx community have considered prioritizing HS adult candidates over PED candidates unfair. Based on this data showing poorer outcomes using similar donors, and other data showing a decline in the % of kidneys going to PED recipients after KAS, prioritizing HS adult RTx candidates with a prior RTx over PED candidates should be reconsidered. Background: De-novo donor specifi c antibody (DSA) is one of the strongest independent predictors of graft loss with HLA mismatching being a major risk factor for development of de-novo DSA. Recent conceptual and technical advances permit examination of HLA mismatching at the epitope/eplet level. Given the observation that certain HLA allele mismatches appear to be more antigenic than others, this retrospective study followed the development of DSA in pediatric transplant recipients as a consequence of donor-recipient epitope/ eplet mismatches. Method: Fifty-two pediatric renal transplant recipients (31 deceased donors, 21 living donors) transplanted between 2011-2015 were reviewed for their development of DSA. HLA matchmaker software was used to identify and enumerate HLA epitope/eplet mismatches. Result: Twenty six of the 52 patients, developed DSA, the majority (21/26 or 81%) being Class II DSA. Within the DSA positive group there were more DQ epitope/eplet mismatches than DR epitope/eplet mismatches (p= 0.006). There were signifi cantly more DQ epitope mismatches in the DSA positive patients than in the DSA negative patients (p=0.008). Specifi c epitopes/eplets within the HLA-DQ locus of the donor (55PP, 70RT, 52PL and 140T) were more frequently mismatched in the DSA positive group compared to the DSA negative group (p<0.0001), suggesting that these may be the immunodominant epitopes/eplets associated with development of de-novo DSA. Here we report our experience with TCZ (anti-IL6R) in pediatric renal transplant recipients with biopsy-proven cABMR, refractory to treatment with IVIg and Rituximab. Methods: From Jan 2013 to June 2016, we identifi ed 6 pts who developed strong (MFI>10,000) de novo DSAs on annual DSA monitoring, had ABMR on biopsy and despite treatment with IVIg and Rituximab, continued to have cABMR. These patients were treated with TCZ, 4-8mg/kg monthly for 4-12 doses. Pts were monitored for iDSA (immunodominant DSA -DSA with highest MFI)), renal function, patient and graft survival and adverse effects of TCZ. Results: Mean age at TCZ: 14.2 years (6. 3-17.9yrs ) Mean time to ABMR from transplant: 2177 days (1159-4036 days) . Mean time to TCZ from diagnosis of ABMR: 457 days (185-814 days). At diagnosis of cABMR, iDSA was class 2 in all pts (5 with DQ, 1 with DR) and all iDSAs were >10,000MFI, with C1Q binding. At time of TCZ use, the iDSA were the same since time of diagnosis. 4-12 doses of TCZ was used. TCZ was well tolerated in 4/6 pts -2 pts developed fatigue and therefore discontinued TCZ infusion after the 4 th dose. At median follow up of 15 months (7-48 months) post TCZ, there was no change/decline in the renal function (mean delta change in serum creatinine: 0.01mg/dl), and no change in the iDSA. WBC counts and liver function tests were stable. 4 pts underwent a renal biopsy 3 months post TCZ, which showed mild to moderate reduction in C4d staining with no worsening of cABMR. Patient and graft survival was 100%. Viral PCRs were negative at and post TCZ. Conclusion: Development of strong de novo DSA post renal transplantation is associated with cABMR. TCZ was fairly well tolerated in all pts. The administration of TCZ in severe ABMR, refractory to B cell immunotherapy, stabilized the progression of ABMR, resulting in no graft loss and no decline in renal function. iDSA was not affected. The utility of TCZ in the treatment of cABMR should be further explored. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is a major concern for allograft failure, which could be mitigated by allocation of Class II matched donors. Since children have priority, we used national data to model access to zero-mismatched donors for pediatric kidney recipients. Deceased donors registered in the Canadian Transplant Registry (CTR) since 2008 with high-resolution HLA typing (n=1661) and data from the Canadian Organ Transplant Register were used for modelling of ABO:DRB1:DQA:DQB (0MM) allele combination frequencies in the population. A prospective national pediatric cohort (n=43) and the CTR were used to model wait time for an ideally matched donor (Age 12-35, 0MM), not accounting for sensitization. 460 distinct ABO:DRB1:DQA:DQB allelic combinations were identifi ed and 214 (12.9%) were unique to a single donor. The most common (1 st quintile) had a median frequency of 1.02% (IQR 0.90-1.26%) and the least common (5 th quintile) 0.06% (IQR 0.06-0.06%). Using each donor type to simulate potential recipients, common ABO:HLA types (1 st quintile) had 0MM to 3.9% of the donor pool and access decreased by quintile (1.9, 1.3, 0.9, 0.2% Background: We have recently shown that the non-HLA antibody, AT1R-Ab, is prevalent and associated with poor outcomes in pediatric kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). The prevalence and signifi cance of other G-protein coupled receptor non-HLA antibodies in pediatric KTRs remains unclear. We aimed to determine the clinical impact of endothelin-1 type A receptor antibody (ETAR-Ab) in pediatric KTRs. Methods: 65 pediatric patients were monitored for 2 years after transplantation from August 2005 to November 2014. ETAR-Ab (ELISA), AT 1 R-Ab (ELISA), HLA DSA (Luminex), and TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, were measured at 6 months (m), 12m, and 24m post-transplant and during episodes of rejection. Based on a receiver operating curve analysis, > 10 and >17 units/ml was considered positive for ETAR-Ab and AT 1 R-Ab and >1000 MFI was considered positive for HLA DSA. Biopsies were performed at 6m, 12m, and 24m post-transplant per protocol and for clinical suspicion of rejection and evaluated by 2013 Banff criteria. Clinical outcomes and renal function was serially assessed (MDRD for >18 and updated Schwartz Equation for <18 years old). Results: The prevalence of patients positive for ETAR-Ab at any time point was 32% (21/65). ETAR-Ab was associated with AT 1 R-Ab (p<0.001), but not HLA DSA. AT 1 R-Ab was present in all patients who had ETAR-Ab. ETAR-Ab was associated with decrease in eGFR by 50% (p=0.045) and arteritis on biopsy (p=0.011), but not allograft loss, rejection, or hypertension ( Figure 1a ). Furthermore, patients positive for ETAR-Ab had higher median levels of IL-8 (p=0.003, Figure 1b ). Conclusions: In pediatric KTRs, ETAR-Ab in combination with AT 1 R-Ab may promote vascular infl ammation, leading to allograft dysfunction. Treatment with dual blockade may mitigate vascular injury and improve clinical outcomes.",

Antibody production in cell culture supernatant investigated by fl owcytometry against donor blood group antigens by cells from ABOi LDLT patients was lower than in the control groups. Previous studies have suggested that with the use of with (DAA) agents to treat post transplant (HCV), there has been an increased incidence of liver graft rejection. This increase may be due to an improvement in liver function resulting in better metabolizing of immunosuppressive drugs resulting in a decrease in blood levels or immunomodulating effects of the HCV virus. We looked to see what the effects of treating HCV post liver transplant with (DAA) agents on immunosuppressive drug levels. Patients treated with interferon were excluded from the study. Through a retrospective chart review, patients' demographics, date of transplant, date of HCV recurrence, pre and post treatment viral loads were recorded. Immunosuppressive regimens and treatment regimens were noted. Tacrolimus (TAC), cyclosporine(CYA), or sirolimus(SIR) levels were measured pretreatment, 6 weeks into treatment, and post-treatment. Post-treatment viral load as well as biopsy proven rejections was recorded as well. Following data collection, statistical analysis was done using a paired t-test. Results: 54 patients were treated with post transplant for HCV with DAA regimens. All 54 patients achieved SVR. The majority of patients were treated with TAC (41), while 9 received CYA and 4 SIR the main immunosuppression, CYA and SIR levels dropped but were not statistically signifi cant.

While our incidence of rejection (0.07%) was low, immunosuppressive dosages and TAC levels should be monitored closely to prevent this occurrence.

Despite LT recipients being older and sicker compared to 2002, post-LT survival has signifi cantly improved. The impact of transplanting sicker, diabetic, obese, but less functional patients will need to be carefully examined beyond the 1 and 3-year outcomes scrutinized by the SRTR to truly assess our current listing practices. Background: While rare, combined Thoracic/Liver transplants are employed with increasing frequency. Consistent data regarding the technical conduct, patient selection and outcomes in this highly complex group is lacking. Methods: Patients with end stage cardiac/pulmonary and liver disease who underwent heart-liver (HL) or lung-liver (LL) transplantation were evaluated. Transplants were performed sequentially (thoracic-fi rst approach.) Liver preoperative pathology were reviewed. (12 consecutive patients, 3 LL and 9 HL tx , 2010-2017, retrospective death by performing multivariate competing risk analyses of 121,198 candidates listed in the United Network for Organ Sharing database. We incorporated the factors into an index to identify disenfranchised waitlist candidates, the transplant-death index (TDI). Signifi cant predictors of 90-day waitlist activity (either liver transplantation or death) for listed candidates included: age, lab MELD score at listing, blood type, BMI, diabetes mellitus, re-transplantation, hemodialysis, low albumin levels, life support, hepatitis C status, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hospital admission. Approximately half of the patients on the waitlist had low probabilities of both death and transplantation within 90 days (TDI-inactive). The remaining 50% of patients were stratifi ed into 10 groups within a predictive index, the TDI. As the TDI increases, the likelihood of transplantation increases and the likelihood of death decreases. The low-TDI groups (TDI 10, 20) represent candidates with low probabilities of transplantation and high probabilities of death within 90 days. It is this disenfranchised subgroup that would benefi t most from considering a marginal allograft. Purpose: On 2/19/2015 major revisions to the Lung Allocation Score (LAS) calculation were made to more appropriately refl ect candidates' waiting list urgency and post-transplant survival. Many of the revisions focused on reassessing the scores for lung candidates with pulmonary vascular disease (PVD). Pre-post-implementation analyses were constructed to evaluate the revisions. Methods: OPTN data on adult lung-alone candidates and recipients were analyzed for a pre-and post-cohort between 2/19/14-2/18/16 split at the date of implementation. Waiting list data were used to determine the changes across diagnosis group pre-vs. post-implementation in LAS using a two-way ANOVA, and relative ranking on the waiting list relative to other diagnosis groups using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. Transplant data were used to analyze changes in the number of transplants within each diagnosis group as well as Kaplan-Meier 1-yr recipient survival estimates overall and by diagnosis group. Results: For adult lung-alone candidates in the pre-era (N=2,559) and the post-era (N=2,541) there were signifi cant increases in the match LAS for PVD (p<0.001) and signifi cant decreases for restrictive lung disease candidates (p<0.001). Similarly, a signifi cant change was found in the relative ranking of candidates pre-vs. post-implementation for those with PVD (p<0.001), restrictive lung disease (p=0.012), and obstructive lung disease (p<0.001). There was a signifi cant improvement in the 1-yr recipient survival estimate for the pre-(85.96%) vs. post-(89.41%) era (log rank test p<0.001). Recipients with a diagnosis of cystic fi brosis and immunodefi ciency disorder and obstructive lung disease maintain the highest 1-yr survival estimates within both eras.",

The OPTN Thoracic Organ Transplantation Committee will continue to monitor the revisions and assess whether any further modifi cations should be made to the LAS calculation. Purpose: Histologic assessment of lung transplant transbronchial biopsies (TBB) is not reproducible and cannot assess antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). Molecular diagnostics (MMDx) successfully identifi ed rejection in heart and kidney transplants, and we adapted MMDx to TBB using 453 rejection-associated transcripts (RAT) derived in kidneys and validated in hearts. Methods: 242 single TBB bites from 211 recipients at 7 centers were processed using microarrays. Of those, 152 samples with high surfactant expression (refl ecting alveoli) were analyzed. Molecular rejection scores (non-rejection, TCMR, ABMR) were assigned to each TBB using 3-phenotype archetypal analysis (AA) trained on RAT expression (JHLT 36:1192) . To explore possible injury-related phenotypes in TBB we performed an independent 4-phenotype AA using RAT expression. Results: 3-phenotype AA of TBB identifi ed ABMR, TCMR, and non-rejection phenotypes ( Figure 1A) . Non-rejection scores correlated with absence of rejection transcripts (\u03c1 S =-0.94), especially effector T cell and NK cell transcripts (NKG7, KLRD1, PRF1). TCMR scores correlated with TCMR transcripts (ANKRD22, CTLA4, ADAMDEC1; \u03c1 S =0.91). ABMR scores correlated with ABMR transcripts (\u03c1 S =0.80), particularly endothelial transcripts (CAV1, TEK, ROBO4).",

Scores >0.4 in this fourth dimension were described as injury ( Figure 1B) and were reported independently of the rejection phenotypes from the 3-phenotype AA. The injury score correlated weakly with all-rejection transcripts (\u03c1 S =0.2) and represents macrophage-rich infl ammation that may arise either from rejection or other disease processes. Conclusion: MMDx describes TBB as a composite of rejection (TCMR and ABMR) and a macrophage-rich injury state. We believe that clinical phenotyping with two TBB bites to mitigate heterogeneity in alveolar content (compared to up to 10 for histology) will provide a new, safer approach that will change care by offering the fi rst accurate assessments of TCMR and ABMR. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02812290. Purpose: The OPTN/UNOS added fi elds to the deceased donor registration form on 3/31/2015 to capture the intent to utilize ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) on a donor lung prior to transplantation (Tx). The aim is to examine the utilization of EVLP geographically in the US, and to compare early transplant outcomes between perfused (or intended to be) lungs to those lungs where perfusion was not considered. Methods: All adult deceased donors with at least one lung recovered for Tx from 4/1/15-6/30/17 were analyzed. The prevalence of the intended use of EVLP was examined by OPO. Post-transplant primary graft dysfunction (PGD) and 1-year recipient survival (Tx between 4/1/15-7/31/16) were compared between donors with lungs intended for EVLP vs. not intended for EVLP. Results: For adult deceased donors (N=5,038), 9,514 lungs were recovered for the purpose of Tx in the US. EVLP was intended in 137 donors for a total of 254 lungs (20 donors of a single lung, 117 donors of double lungs) and 139 (54.7%) of EVLP donor lungs were Tx. The discard rate in the EVLP group was higher than the non-EVLP group (45.3% vs 4.2%, p<0.001). The use of EVLP varied across OPO with 20 OPOs not performing EVLP, 32 with EVLP intent for 1-10 lungs, 2 with EVLP intent for 12 lungs, and 4 with EVLP intent for >20 lungs ( Figure 1 ). There was no signifi cant difference in the odds of a lung with EVLP intended developing PGD grade greater than 1 compared to a lung without EVLP intended (OR 1.01, 95% CI (0.56, 1.84) ). 1-yr patient survival between groups (EVLP, n=47; non-EVLP, n=2,801) was not signifi cantly different (p= 0.686).",

PURPOSE: To determine whether increased pre-transplant rejection-risk measured by CD154+TcM predicts increased immunosuppression with tacrolimus and steroids in 60-month follow-up in children with ITx who were enrolled in in pivotal studies of this test system (National Clinical Trial 1163578). METHODS: The clinical course of 22 children, in whom rejection-risk was measured with the immunoreactivity index (IR) of CD154+TcM before ITx was evaluated for 60 months after ITx. An immunoreactivity index of 1.23 or greater implies increased rejection-risk, as described previously. Tacrolimus whole blood concentrations and prednisone doses were recorded at 12-monthly intervals until month 60, and compared between children at increased and decreased rejectionrisk. Immunosuppression management was based on clinical protocols. RESULTS: Median age was 2 years (range 0.7-15). The distribution of male: female gender was 13: 9, and Caucasian: non-caucasian race was 11: 11. Ten children demonstrated increased rejection-risk and 12 children demonstrated decreased rejection-risk before ITx. In between-group comparisons over a 60-month follow-up period, children with increased rejection-risk demonstrated 1) signifi cantly shorter median time to the fi rst biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection event (22 vs 281 days, p=0.033, K-M test), 2) signifi cantly lower 5-year rejection-free survival (8% vs 40%, p=0.033, K-M test) and 3) higher mean (+/-SEM) tacrolimus whole blood, which achieved signifi cance at 12 (9.3+/-0.9 vs 4.5+/-0.7 ng/ml, p-value=0.001) 48 (6.5+/-0.9 vs 3.3+/-0.4 ng/ml, p-value=0.01) and 60 months (6.0+/-0.8 vs 3.2+/-0.3 ng/ml, p-value=0.02) after ITx. No differences were seen in steroid use or steroid doses between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Increased rejection-risk measured with allospecifi c CD154+Tcytotoxic memory cells before intestine transplantation predicts delayed minimization of tacrolimus in children. Therefore, pre-transplant rejection-risk assessment may be a useful adjunct to immunosuppression management after pediatric ITx. Objective Graft rejection remains the crux of intestinal transplantation. Although liver-inclusive grafts appear to be protective, the mechanism remains unknown. We hypothesize that T-cell macrochimerism more commonly develops following multivisceral transplant (MVTx) and correlates with decreased graft rejection.",

The number of HV centers has increased throughout the years but not in the West. There was a 373% increase in the number of IT from period 1 to 2. This decreased in period 3. During periods 1 and 2, UNOS regions 2, 3, 8 accounted for 69.7% of all IT. During period 3, regions 2, 8, 10 accounted for 65.3% The number of centers doing at least 1 IT at any given year remained consistent during the 3 periods. Transplant patterns differ by region with fewer HV centers in the West. The number of IT grew in adults between periods 1 and 2 and then remained consistent in period 3 while the number of pediatric cases initially grew but then fell dramatically between periods 2 and 3. This likely refl ects widespread implementation and improvement in intestinal rehabilitation. These numbers show there has been an evolution in IT from being experimental before 1990 to the standard of care for patients with specifi c indications nowadays performed in centers with signifi cant expertise. A. As the pathophysiologic role of Tissue Resident Memory T Cells (T RM ) in intestinal transplantation (ITx) is unknown, this study aims to test the hypothesis that T RM play a critical effector role in graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in ITx patients. B. A cohort of 16 recent ITx patients was prospectively immunomonitored via serial blood and allograft polychromatic fl ow cytometry (PFC) starting one day before ITx. Five patients with clinically and pathologically confi rmed GvHD were identifi ed with onsets between (40-59, mean=46) days after ITx. CD3 + T RM cells were phenotypically defi ned as CD62L -CD45RO +/-CD69 + CD103 +/-, effector memory T cells (T EM ) as CD45RO + CD62Lor CCR7 -CD45RA -. C. Importantly, immunomonitoring results revealed signifi cantly higher frequencies of allograft CD8 + T RM (68.2%) with an effector memory phenotype in the GvHD group versus the stable ITx cohort (23.9%)(p=0.0065) at the time of GvHD diagnosis. This was accompanied by a trend towards lower mean frequencies of allograft CD4 + T RM in GvHD versus stable ITx patients (12.7% vs. 31.0%, p>0.05). Moreover, immunophenotyping of pre-reperfusion backtable samples confi rmed the predominance of donor effector memory type CD8 + T RM (81.3%) in the allografts of GvHD patients prior to ITx. Thus, allograftderived CD8 + T RM may be critical effector cells which, after engraftment and recirculation, initiate the process of GvHD. This hypothesis was corroborated by serial blood immunomonitoring which demonstrated an increase in CD8 + T EM immediately prior to presentation of GvHD (56%) versus pre-GvHD baseline (26%). D. Prospective immunomonitoring indicates that donor allograft derived effector memory type CD8 + T RM may re-circulate after ITx and operate as effectors of GvHD, which may have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. In intestinal transplantation, the intestinal allograft (IA) presents a formidable challenge for control of alloimmune responses due to constitutive MHC class II expression by intestinal epithelial cells (IE), abundant mobile hematopoietic cells (mHC), and continuous exposure to gut microbiota. Mechanisms and regulation of donor-specifi c T cell-mediated allograft rejection responses (DSTR) within IA are unclear due to the lack of a clinically relevant model. We developed a novel ex vivo assay system for DSTR using 3D intestinal organoid (IO) culture. Donor-specifi c CD4 and CD8 T cell lines (DST) were derived by co-culturing recipient peripheral blood mononuclear cells with irradiated donor-derived B cell lines (BL) and specifi city confi rmed by cytolysis of donor not recipient BL. Donor IOs from pre-transplant IA expressed both HLA-class I and II and were co-cultured with DST. Numbers of viable IOs were counted; a \"viable organoid\" defi ned as a translucent organoid with sharp border and without DST infi ltration. The Caspase-3/7 activity of IOs were also measured. When donor IO were co-cultured with DST without extracellular matrix (ECM) for 2-16 hours, caspase-3/7 activation increased as a function of E:T after 4-and 16-hours. When the IOs were co-cultured with DST on ECM for 5 days with or without a cytokine cocktail (CC; IL-2, IL7, and IL-15), IO numbers in medium with CC decreased in an E:T-dependent manner (R 2 =0.8449, p < 0.0001), but not those without CC (R 2 = 0.04196, p = 0.5231) (Fig. 1) . Addition of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) regulated DST inhibition of donor IO formation. These results suggest that: i) DST directly induces Caspase 3/7-dependent apoptosis of IE; ii) T-cell growth factors are needed to sustain DSTR to IOs embedded in the matrix; and, iii) MDSCs suppress the DSTR. Our novel ex vivo DSTR assay system will be a useful tool for analysis of immunoregulation among IE, mHC, and DST within IA. Introduction: CMV infection remains an important cause of morbidity, allograft enteritis, and allograft loss in small intestinal (SIT) and multivisceral transplant (MVT) recipients. As the highest risk for CMV infection is associated donor positive (D+) and recipient negative (R-) serostatus we have attempted to limit D+/R-SIT and MVT at our center. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis to determine whether a more restrictive donor selection criteria (i.e. limited D+/R-transplants) would affect the incidence of CMV infection in SIT and MVT recipients at our institution.

Donor specifi c antibody negatively infl uences allograft outcomes and similarly, contributes to antibody mediated rejection in xenotransplantation. Clinically signifi cant antibodies, binding blood group antigens and HLA, can provide insight to understanding antibody subsets in xenotransplantation, binding species specifi c glycosylation and swine leukocyte antigen (SLA). It is therefore critical to accurately test for antibody to guide patient selection and future porcine genetic modifi cations. Methods: Highly sensitized patient sera, with known single HLA antigen reactivity, were selected and grouped as anti-HLA-A only, -B only, both (n= 20, 24, 12) . Flow cytometric crossmatch was completed on GGTA1/CMAH/ B4GalNT2 peripheral blood mononuclear cells and red blood cells to assess IgG and IgM antibody binding. Cross-reactive group patterns in human sera compared to antigens found on tested SLA. Results: IgG antibody binding among anti-HLA-B achieved 60% of samples with minimal antibody binding (MFI<5,000) compared to only 16% of those with HLA-A only antibodies. Anti-HLA-A antibodies are found to react to porcine SLA in predicted epitope patterns. Red blood cell reactivity identify some patients have anti porcine mixed isotype IgG and IgM antibodies. Conclusion: Flow cytometric crossmatch of PBMC is a useful tool for screening and identifying anti-SLA antibodies for the sensentized. Those patients with HLA-B antibodies have a lower frequency of binding porcine cells, with many having a negative crossmatch. Antibody binding to PBMC and red cells identify need for careful patient screening and porcine genetic engineering. Introduction: Metabolic plasticity and mitochondrial bioenergetic homeostasis are altered due to a organ ischemia. However, the impact of the alloimmune response on the allograft is not known. The goal of our studies is to establish if bioenergetic dysfunction is linked to metabolic reprogramming of kidney during rejection. Methods: Kidneys from C57BL/6 were transplanted into MHC-incompatible Balb/c mice (allograft). Kidneys from C57BL/6 were transplanted into their litter-mates as isograft controls. No immunosuppression was given as these grafts have prolonged survival and ongoing cellular rejection. Major mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes and metabolic regulators, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1), were determined in whole kidney lysates. Western blot analysis also includes regulatory components of mitochondrial biogenesis and tissue remodeling. Results: Signifi cant loss of mitochondrial ETC complexes was observed in kidney allografts, compared to isografts in the fi rst week post-transplant. Such loss of mitochondrial complexes was accompanied by activation of several metabolic switches involved in reprogramming toward glycolytic metabolism, as evidenced by increased activity of mTOR and HIF-1\u03b1 in allografts versus isografts.",

Methods: BALB/c to C57BL/6 renal transplants were performed with cyclosporine immunosuppression. 12 weeks pre-transplant, donors were infected with MCMV \u2206m157 at 10 4 plaque-forming units [pfu] ; recipients with MCMV\u2206m157 at low dose [10 2 pfu] or high dose [10 4 pfu], or with MCMV wildtype (MCMVwt) at 10 4 pfu. Allografts were analyzed by cytokine fl ow cytometry (CFC), cytokine array (Legendplex), and histopathology (24-point scale). Allograft-derived T cells were stimulated with peptides for either infl ationary (M38) or noninfl ationary (M45) epitopes for CFC. Groups were compared using the Student's t-test and ANOVA, accepting signifi cance at p<0.05. Results: Low-dose recipients had greater interferon-gamma+ (IFN-\u0263+) NK cells compared to high-dose recipients (2174\u00b1609 cells/g vs. 484\u00b1132 cells/g, p=0.03), greater intragraft CD4+ Th17 cells (18569\u00b12263 cells/g vs. 6569\u00b12555 cells/g, p<0.01), and higher Th17-associated cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-23, IL-17A, and GM-CSF.

            "text": "Conclusions: In this model, recipient virus dose and strain infl uenced characteristics of immune-mediated renal allograft injury, with signifi cant differences in Th17 and NK cells, but no differences in antiviral CD8+ CTL responses. These results suggest that mechanisms of R+ CMV-induced allograft injury may differ according to conditions of the recipient's primary infection. Hepatocyte transplantation (HcTx) is a potential therapeutic modality for patients with liver disease. Despite examples of antigen acceptance in the liver, allogeneic HcTx into patients exhibits signifi cant, but short-lived, benefi ts with immunogenicity remaining a barrier to allograft survival. In our well-characterized animal model, Hc allografts are highly immunogenic and stimulate multiple rejection mechanisms including: antibody-mediated rejection, CD4-dependent CD8-mediated rejection, and CD4-independent CD8-mediated rejection. Our published reports and new data suggest that type I NKT cells (iNKTs) are critical to the development of each rejection pathway. We fi rst reported that alloantibody titer following HcTx is critically inhibited (~10-100 fold) in the absence of iNKTs (Ja18 KO recipients). To further investigate the effects of iNKTs on humoral as well as cellular alloimmunity, we utilized immunohistochemistry (IHC), fl ow cytometry, in vivo cytotoxicity assays, and analysis of allograft survival following HcTx. Ja18 KO recipients exhibited signifi cantly reduced germinal center size (GL-7 staining by IHC; day 14 postTx) and number of splenic IL-4 + and IL-21 + CD4 + T FH cells [day 7; wildtype (WT): IL-4=100\u00b14x10 3 , IL-21=145\u00b15x10 3 vs. Ja18 KO: IL-4=25\u00b13x10 3 , IL-21=75\u00b114x10 3 cells/spleen; p<0.04] by fl ow cytometry compared to WT recipients. Additionally, CD4-dependent CD8 + T cell-mediated cytotoxicity to allogeneic targets (day 7; 89.8\u00b12.6%) was reduced by ~70% in Ja18 KO recipients (26.9\u00b13.3%, p<0.001). When iNKT cells are adoptively transferred (AT) into Ja18 KO recipients (same day as Tx), CD4-dependent CD8 + T cell-mediated cytotoxicity was signifi cantly enhanced (35.3\u00b14.6%; p=0.01). Interestingly, CD4-independent, CD8 + T cell-mediated cytotoxicity (26.9\u00b15.1%) was abrogated in CD4-depleted Ja18 KO recipients (2.0\u00b1.0.9%; p=0.009) and allogeneic HcTx exhibited prolonged survival in CD4-depleted Ja18 KO recipients (MST>day 30 vs. day 14 rejection in CD4-depleted WT recipients; p=0.03). When iNKT cells are AT into CD4-depleted Ja18 KO recipients, CD4-independent CD8 + T cell-mediated cytotoxicity was signifi cantly enhanced (6.0\u00b10.8; p=0.001) and kinetics of allograft rejection were accelerated (MST=day 14; p=0.03). These data support the hypothesis that iNKTs are central to the humoral-and cellular-mediated response following HcTx and targeting iNKTs for immunosuppression may lead to enhanced graft survival. Introduction: Solid organ transplantation has seen a increase in the utilization of older organs. Here, we investigate how aging-associated kinetics of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including mtDNA are driving the augmented susceptibility of older organs to IRI through dendritic cells (DCs) with subsequent inferior graft survival. Methods: Old and young mice underwent bilateral clamping of the renal pedicles (22 min ischemic time). mtDNA, cytokine and senescence marker levels were tested by qPCR; DC and T cell activation were characterized by FACS. Old and young DCs were adoptively transferred into young recipients that subsequently received young or old cardiac allografts. Results: DCs of old na\u00efve mice showed higher frequencies and levels of maturation in parallel to increased baseline levels of mtDNA. Importantly, renal IRI induced a prominent release of mtDNA into the circulation of old animals (after 48h; p=0.019) and an increased IFN-\u0263 expression in splenic CD8 + T cells (p=0.0001). Isolated DCs showed a dose-dependent up-regulation of CD40 with augmented amounts of IL-6 in the presence of mtDNA; the addition of a TLR9 antagonist attenuated this pro-infl ammatory response of old DCs. In addition, old DCs promoted IFN-\u0263 and IL-17 responses of allogeneic T cells in vitro.",

            "text": "Here, we have investigated mechanisms provokingthe increased endogenous memory CD8 T cell numbers and activation withinallografts subjected to 0.5 vs. 8 hrs CIS. Using BrdU labeling, graft-infi ltrating memory CD4 and CD8 T cellssignifi cantly proliferated and accumulated within allografts subjected to 8 vs. 0.5 hr CIS. In contrast to the resistance following CTLA-4Ig treatment, peri-transplant recipient treatment with anti-CD40L mAb inhibited early graft infi ltrating memory CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation and markedly prolonged survival of allografts subjected to 8 hr CIS beyond day 40 post-transplant. The increased proliferation of endogenous memory CD8 T cells within the higher risk allografts required recipient CD4 T cells, graft dendritic cells and graft expression of class II MHC, CD40 and IL-12p40,but not p35.qPCR analysis showed that expression of IL-12p40but not IL-12 p35 or IL-23p19 mRNA was elevated at 48 hr post-transplant in allografts subjected to 8 hr vs. 0.5 hr CIS and the increase in p40 mRNA was reduced to the levels seen in 0.5 CIS allografts by depletion of recipient CD4 T cells, but was restored by treating CD4 T cell depleted recipients with agonist anti-CD40 mAb. Consistent with this, p40 homodimers, but not p70 heterodimers, were increased in allografts subjected to 8 hr CIS as well as in recipient serum and these increases were dependent on recipient CD4 T cells. Peri-transplant anti-p40 mAb reversed CTLA-4Ig-resistant rejection of higher risk allografts and peri-transplant p40 homodimers induced the proliferation of endogenous memory CD8 T cells within allografts subjected to 0.5 hr CIS to the levels observed in allografts subjected to 8 hr CIS. These data indicate that the activation of endogenous memory CD8 T cells within higher risk cardiac allografts requires CD4 T cell help via CD40-CD154 interactions with graft dendritic cells to induce their production of p40 homodimers. Endogenous memory CD8 T cells infi ltrate MHC-mismatched cardiac allografts within 24 hrs after graft reperfusion in mice. Our recent studies indicate that prolonged cold ischemic graft storage provokes intense infl ammation within hours after allograft reperfusion and promotes endogenous memory CD8 T cell rejection of the allograft. The current studies tested anti-VLA-4 mAb inhibition of this early CD8 T cell infi ltration and activation in such higher risk allografts. Syngeneic or A/J (H-2 a ) hearts were subjected to 8 hrs of cold ischemic storage in University of Wisconsin solution and then transplanted to C57BL/6 (H-2 b ) mice. Anti-VLA-4 mAb (250 ug) was given on days -1 and 0. Grafts were harvested on day 2 and T cell, macrophage, and neutrophil infi ltration into allografts was assessed by fl ow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. mRNA encoding infl ammatory cytokines was measured by qRT-PCR from total graft homogenates. Peritransplant anti-VLA-4 mAb markedly decreased day 2 post-transplant infi ltration of CD4 and CD8 T cell and macrophage, but not neutrophil, into the higher risk allografts to the levels observed in isografts and was accompanied by signifi cant decreases in expression of genes encoding macrophage and T cell chemoattractant cytokines, but had little/no effect on expression of neutrophil chemokines. Anti-VLA-4 mAb also signifi cantly reduced intragraft expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, CXCL9, CXCL10, and IFN-\u0263 on day 2 post-transplant. Background: In 2016, 800 kidneys from HCV+ deceased donors were discarded. Short-term (6-month) data from the fi rst 10 subjects in the THINKER-1 trial (NCT02743897; funder: Merck) suggested that kidneys from HCV-infected donors could be safely transplanted into HCV-negative patients. We report 12-month data on the 10 THINKER-1 recipients and 6-month data on 10 recipients from an expanded cohort (THINKER-2). ",

Transplanting Kidneys from HCV-Infected Donors into HCV- Background: RCC is the most common renal tumor reported to the OPTN and reviewed by DTAC for assessment of potential donor transmission. Organs with concern for RCC are frequently discarded. Methods: All reported cases of suspected RCC between 1/1/08 through 12/31/16 were evaluated by DTAC for organ and recipient outcomes. In addition to recipient outcome data provided through the report, standard OPTN Post-Transplant Malignancy forms were reviewed to identify subsequent recipient malignancies. An event was defi ned as all potential malignancy transmissions from a donor to > 1 recipient(s). Results: 179 reports of suspected donor RCC transmissions were submitted to the DTAC; 170 were deceased donors (DD) and 9 were live donors (LD). From the 170 DD, 321 kidneys were recovered. 160 of those kidneys were transplanted into 154 different recipients. 161 kidneys were recovered and then discarded. From the 9 live donors, all kidneys were transplanted. 147 donors had suspicious lesion noted at procurement",

RCC was not suspected at procurement in any of these cases. Finally, 9 patients were identifi ed with donor-derived RCC. The interval between transplant and RCC diagnosis ranged from 34 to 160 months. These tumors were felt not to have been identifi able at transplant and were deemed donor-derived but not transmitted. Conclusions: These data suggest that excision of small well-differentiated renal cell carcinomas prior to transplant provides outcomes similar to those in patients who receive kidneys from donors without RCC. Additionally, the use of contralateral kidneys and non-renal organs from these patients is not associated with an increased risk of RCC development. ",

Future research is needed to defi ne mechanisms of these associations and the impact of reducing co-prescription on improving outcomes after KTx. The aim of this study is to assess the associations between traditional proxies of medication non-adherence and graft outcomes in contemporary kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Methods: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study of KTRs between 1/2014 and 7/2017. We assessed 7 potential predictors for non-adherence: percentage of days covered (PDCs) of medications (refi ll adherence), high tacrolimus concentration variability (FK CV), age \u226430 years, race, insurance, pharmacist's assessment of patient's understanding of medication regimen at fi rst clinic visit and medicationrelated problems resulting in readmission during the fi rst year. PDC <80% was defi ned as low adherence and FK CV >40% was defi ned as high variability. These were validated using the outcomes of death-censored graft survival and rejection free survival. Results: 513 KTRs were included. Four of the 7 potential predictors of nonadherence demonstrated association with outcomes, including high tacrolimus trough variability, younger age, Medicaid insurance and readmission for medication related problems. Immunosuppression refi ll adherence (PDC), AA race, and pharmacist's assessment of the patient's understanding of medication regimen were not associated with outcomes (Table 1) . Based on this, patients were categorized as high risk if they had 2 or more of the 4 predictors of non-adherence. These patients were at a substantially higher risk of both acute rejection ( Figure 1 , aHR 3.63 (1.69-7.81 ); p=0.001) and death-censored graft loss ( Figure 1 , aHR 2.23 (0.88-5.61 ); p=0.088). Conclusion: Traditional risk-factors for non-adherence, including immunosuppression refi ll adherence and AA race may not be predictive of graft outcomes in contemporary KTRs. However, tacrolimus variability, Medicaid insurance, younger age and medication related readmissions continue to be strongly associated with acute rejection and graft loss. ). Viral co-detection occurred in 15 (6.4%) cases. The most common co-pathogens were HRV, CoV and PIV. Prolonged viral detection (>4 weeks) was seen with hMPV, CoV and HRV. The incidence of individual CRVs varied year-to-year, but seasonal patterns were similar between KTRs and the general population, with a trend towards higher rates of HRV and CoV, and lower rates of infl uenza B in KTRs ( Figure 1 ). CRVs had temporal patterns in KTRs, with seasonal peaks of RSV, CoV and infl uenza A ( Figure 2 ).",

HRV and CoV were more frequent in KTRs. The impact of CRVs on allograft function and patient outcomes will be explored. These fi ndings can be used to inform recommendations for PCR-based respiratory testing in KTRs. Preventability was assessed using modifi ed AHRQ criteria. Rates were estimated in 100 patient-years (100 pt-yrs) and multivariable generalized linear modeling was used to assess adjusted trends in rates over time; Cox regression was used to assess the adjusted impact of readmission etiology on graft survival. Results: 1,840 KTX were included, encompassing 12-years of transplants and 1,485 readmissions during the 13 years of follow-up (80.7 per 100 pt-yrs). Infections (23.0 per 100 pt-yrs), surgical complications (10.8 per 100 pt-yrs), GI (6.6 per 100 pt-yrs) and rejection (5.5 per 100 pt-yrs) were the most common etiologies. Over time, rates for infections, surgical complications, diabetes, electrolytes and preventable readmissions all signifi cantly increased (p<0.05), while rejection readmission rates substantially decreased (p<0.01, Figure 1 ). There was considerable heterogeneity in the readmission etiology and the impact on graft loss; this also changed over time ( Figure 2 (Fig. 1) . This was driven mainly by a lower risk of death (HR=0.41, CI 0.24-0.71, p=0.002) (Fig. 2) in the older kidney transplant recipients. ACEI/ARB use was also associated with lower risk of AKI events after 1 year (HR 0.70, CI 0.52-0.95, p=0.02) (Fig. 3) . Moreover, ACEI/ARB was not associated with increased risk of acute rejection or hospitalization. Statin or ASA use did not signifi cantly impact graft outcomes. . The treatment strategy \"not accepting a DCD\" was favoured 70% of the time for a MELD score of 15-20, whereas it was only favoured 29% of the time for MELD >30. In 2-way sensitivity analysis, accepting a DCD-SLKT was the preferred treatment strategy irrespective of waitlist mortality and transplant rate for MELD >30, fi gure 1.",

Thus, the use of DCD-SLKT should be encouraged in patients with advanced liver-kidney disease to improve overall QALYs (patient perspective) and organ supply (societal perspective). Transplant professionals have struggled to formulate defensible standards for combined heart-kidney and liver-kidney transplantation (HKTs and LKTs). In these recipients, recovery of native renal function can occur. They require high-quality organ donors, but kidney survival may be shorter than in kidneyalone recipients, who have no chance of recovery of native renal function, more waiting time, and a clear survival benefi t with transplantation. It has been left to specialists at individual centers to determine the necessity for the combined procedures. We profi led selection practices using UNOS data from 2012 to 2016. Among the 20 programs doing 40 or more heart-alone transplants per year, 8 did < 3% and 4 did > 10% more of them as HKTs. Among the 19 liver programs doing over 100 liver-alone transplants/year, 4 centers did < 5% and 5 did > 15% more of them as LKTs. In summary, [1] in 2016, HKTs and LKTs utilized almost 18% of all available kidneys with KDPI <35. These combined transplants respectively used kidneys with KDPI >35 about 30% and 45% of the time.",

[3] The newly reformulated LKT selection guidelines may also be variably interpreted, and {4} may actually increase kidney use by conservative centers, as every liver recipient with a low post-transplant GFR at 3 months will be prioritized. However, because donor Oral Abstracts requirements will not be as stringent, fewer low KDPI kidneys may be used. [4] Combined transplants will likely continue to utilize many desirable low KDPI kidneys. With the ongoing organ shortage, there has been an increased interest in using moderately steatotic liver allografts. The impact of such allografts on recipients' post-liver transplant (LT) kidney function remains poorly studied. In order to investigate this in detail, we examined the correlation of moderate allograft steatosis and post-transplant acute kidney injury (AKI) in a large cohort of LT recipients with protocol biopsies. Methods: 786 LT recipients from January 2009 to December 2016 were identifi ed, and their data collected. All allografts were biopsied before implantation, and the degree of steatosis (macro-, micro-or both) was assessed by designated liver pathologists at our institution. Moderate steatosis was defi ned as macrosteatosis of 30-60%. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defi ned per the KDIGO criteria. LT recipients with pre-LT AKI were excluded. Chi-square and unequal variance t-test were used to compare variables, and Kaplan Meier plots for survival. ",

Future analysis includes seeking engagement from centers in each of the four quadrants to identify awareness, successful outreach strategies, barriers to success, etc., and disseminating best practices with educational initiatives. Geographic disparity in access to deceased-donor liver transplantation is well described. The available liver supply in a DSA may affect patient and provider decisions on organ offers METHODS: Using SRTR offer data 2010-2014, we identifi ed 12,529 deceaseddonor livers and estimated the association between DSA-level offer acceptance and DSA supply-demand ratio using modifi ed Poisson regression adjusting for donor factors. Supply-demand ratio (recovered livers to incident waitlist candidates) was stratifi ed into quartiles, highest quartile indicating greatest supply of livers per candidate. The models were further stratifi ed into national, regional, and local offers. RESULTS: DSAs within the lowest supply quartile accepted 88.3% of local offers, while DSAs within each increasing quartile accepted 86.9%, 84.5%, and 75.5% of local offers, respectively. This trend persisted among regional and national offers (Figure) . The association between supply and acceptance varied by offer type (p-value interaction<0.001). Compared to DSAs with the lowest liver supply, DSAs with the highest liver supply were 15% (aRR: 0.82 0.85 0.88 ), 39% (aRR: 0.54 0.61 0.69 ), and 75% (aRR: 0.13 0.25 0.47 ) less likely to accept local, regional, and national offers, respectively (Table) . DSAs within the two uppermost quartiles of supply had similarly low acceptance of regional and national offers, however, they differed in acceptance of local offers. CONCLUSIONS: Higher availability of livers per candidate within a DSA was strongly associated with lower liver offer acceptance within that DSA. Allocation schemes that provide greater equity in deceased-donor availability might minimize geographic disparity and also reduce liver discard driven by high refusal rates. Transplant evaluation requires an assessment of socioeconomic challenges patients face that may derail them from obtaining a kidney transplant (KT). We developed and validated a new, single score Kidney Transplant Derailers Index (KTDI). Data were obtained from dialysis patients in Missouri (n=561) and patients presenting for KT evaluation in California (n=724). These patients were White (45%), Black (32%), and Hispanic (22%). Eight potential KT derailers were measured: fi nancial insecurity, educational attainment, type of employment, type of health insurance, perception of neighborhood safety, access to a vehicle, having a washer/dryer at home and social support. Item response theory models were used to estimate KTDI scores (T-score, mean = 50 and SD = 10) and determine which derailers best discriminated between underlying levels of socioeconomic status. Construct validity was examined with associations between the KTDI and zip-code level socioeconomic indicators from the US census, including % in poverty and % without health insurance. For patients who presented for KT (n=724), we also determined whether the KTDI score was predictive of time to transplant access. Greater fi nancial insecurity, low educational attainment, not having full-time employment, having Medicaid, not having private insurance, and no access to a vehicle were the most discriminating indicators. KTDI scores ranged from 34.2 to 63.1 (Mean: 50; higher scores indicate more derailers). Black patients and those with worse health had higher scores.",

Time to transplant access was signifi cantly lower for patients with higher KTDI scores ( Figure 1 ). Background: Ongoing organ shortage and regional differences in organ availability have encouraged patients in need of liver transplantation (LT) to travel in order to increase the probability of LT. The aim of this study was to identify patterns and predictors of patient migration for LT in the US. Methods: Data for all adult primary deceased donor LT recipients between January 2004 and June 2017 were obtained from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database. We extracted ZIP codes for the patient's residency at registration and for the hospital in which LT took place. These ZIP code data were used to calculate the distance of travel. Patients were considered to have migrated for LT if they traveled greater than 500 miles to undergo LT outside their home region. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors for patient migration. Results: There were 73,006 eligible LT with valid zip code data during the study period. 3,918 (5.4%) recipients traveled \u2265 500 miles from the time of listing to LT, the majority being to a different state (97.4%) and region (83.9%). Patients who migrated to a distant region for LT were older, more likely to be male, white, and educated, compared to those who did not migrate (p<0.01 for all).They had lower median allocation MELD at LT and were more likely to live in a zip code with higher income quartile, have private insurance, and be multiply listed. Background: Induction of T cell immune response c-DNA (TIRC7) is restricted to activated lymphocytes. Modulation of TIRC7 signalling prevents immune activation specifi cally at the site of infl ammation while preserving immune competency of peripheral lymphocytes. The effi cacy of a novel high affi nity, chimeric antibody against human TIRC7 was investigated to prevent allograft rejection after transplantation in combination and comparison to a calcineurin inhibitor, FK506. Method: Rat splenocytes were stimulated with either mitogen or IL2 in presence or absence of anti-TIRC7 antibody (anti-TIRC7 mAb) or control mAb to analyze cross-reactivity. Synergistic effects of anti-TIRC7 mAb with Tacrolimus (Tac) were tested in a strong histoincompatible donor/recipient combination (DA to Lewis). Kidney transplant recipients were treated either with Tac 0.2mg/kg or 0.5mg/kg or anti-TIRC7 mAb 2mg/day in combination with Tac (0.2mg/kg, days 0-7). Low dose FK506 was combined with the anti-TIRC7 mAb to prevent immunogenecity. Serum and spleens were procured by day 7 and for FACS to analyze lymphocyte subsets. Free anti-TIRC7 mAb concentration and allograft reaction was assessed in serum collected at days 1, 4 and 7 after transplantation. Anti-TIRC7 mAb kinetics was analyzed after a single dose administration to rats in serum collected on days 1,2,6,9,14 and 30. Results: Anti-TIRC7 antibody in combination with low dose FK506 prolonged graft survival up to 80 days (mean 46d). Graft survival was inferior with Tac treatment only (max. 55d; mean 24d). Immunogenicity was absent after antibody application. Free antibody concentrations were 200 and 50ug/ml on days 1 and 30, respectively. No clinical side-effects was observed in anti-TIRC7 treated animals with unchanged periphereal lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood. Elevated intragraft TIRC7 expression was observed in biopsies of allografts undergoing rejection. Conclusion: The results suggest a pharmacodynamic synergism between the anti-TIRC7 mAb and FK506. No anti-drug antibody reaction was observed indicating no immunogenecity relevant epitops are presented to induce immune activation. Targeting of TIRC7 may provide a highly specifi c, novel approach for modulation of immune response restricted solely to tissue infi ltrating lymphocytes in transplantation. ",

            "text": "Here, we assessed the impact of immunosuppressive treatment with CTLA4-Ig, a fusion protein blocking costimulatory signaling between APCs and T cells through CD28, on alloimmune responses in old and young recipients (2-3 months vs. 16 months) in a fully MHC-mismatched murine transplantation models. While treatment with CTLA4-Ig prolonged skin graft survival in young recipients, the same treatment was unable to prolong graft survival in old recipients. Conversely, cardiac allografts in young mice treated with CTLA4-Ig survived indefi nitely, while 80% of old recipients treated with CTLA4-Ig had lost their graft after 100 days (log-rank test, p<0.001; n=5/group). CTLA4-Ig reduced the in-vivo proliferation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (as assessed by BrdU incorporation) uniformly in both young and old recipients; in contrast, CTLA4-Ig reduced CD4 + central-memory and effector-memory T cells only in young but not old recipients. Moreover, systemic frequencies of CD4 + IFN-\u0263 + T cells and systemic levels of IFN-\u0263 cytokine production were reduced in young recipients, but remained unchanged in old. CTLA4-Ig caused signifi cant perturbation in the Treg compartments with reduced frequencies and compromised proliferation of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + cells. These differences correlated with a signifi cant reduction in expression of CD28 on T cells in old mice, while levels of CTLA4 remained stable. Immunosuppressive effects of costimulatory blockade with CTLA4-Ig showed distinct age-dependent effects in both skin and cardiac transplantation. Reduced expression of CD28 with aging may represent an escape mechanism for old alloreactive T cells, with unique clinical consequences for immunosuppression in the growing population of elderly transplant recipients. The backbone of current immunosuppression regimens remains calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) in association with steroids, mycophenolate mofetil or mTOR inhibitors. However, their long-term administration is associated with signifi cant side effects. Costimulation blockade-based therapy with CTLA4Ig has been shown to be an effective alternative to current immunosuppressive protocols with a minimal side-effect profi le. However, many studies have shown higher incidence of acute rejection, especially during the early phase post-transplantation. Recently, it has been clear that metabolic reprogramming is an integral aspect of T cell activation, differentiation and function.Previous studies have demonstrated that inhibiting T-cell metabolism at the time of T-cell activation inhibits both proliferation and cytokine production and it has been shown to effectively control T-cell responses in preclinical models of autoimmunity and transplantation.In this study, we examined the effect of combining CTLA4Ig with metabolic inhibitors (MI) 2-deoxyglucose, metformin and 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine in improving allograft survival using murine models of skin, heart and hind-limb transplantation (BALB/c to C57BL/6). Simultaneous inhibition of T-cell glycolysis, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glutamine metabolism with MI enhanced the effi cacy of CTLA4Ig. Skin allograft survival was signifi cantly prolonged in the double-treated animals compared to animals that received only CTLA4Ig or MI. Moreover, combining CTLA4Ig with only short-term MI (30 days) could achieved long term cardiac and hind-limb allograft survival. Addition of MI to CTLA4Ig further suppressed the initial alloreactive immune response and allowed for limited immunomodulation to achieve allograft tolerance. Our results indicate that targeting T cell metabolism provides a novel approach for enhancing CNI-sparing regimens with CTLA4Ig. Objectives. Chronic rejection of transplanted organs is a major obstacle in human organ transplantation. Although the mechanisms of chronic rejection are poorly understood it is known that chronic rejection is caused by the immune cells, such as T cells and macrophages, accumulating within the graft. The immune cell movement is regulated by actin cytoskeleton and small GTPase RhoA pathway. We showed recently that the blockade of early T cell response in conjunction with the genetic or pharmacologic interference with the small GTPase RhoA pathway, by RhoA-deletion or Y27632 inhibition of RhoA/ROCK kinase, inhibits macrophage movement into the graft and abrogates chronic rejection of cardiac allografts in rodent model. Although besides the Y27632 inhibitor, there are other RhoA/ROCK inhibitors available commercially, their effi cacy in inhibition of chronic rejection remains unknown. Methods. Heart allografts from BALB/c (H-2d) donors were heterotopically transplanted into C57BL/6 (H-2b) recipients (each experimental group consisted of 3-5 animals), which received CTLA4-Ig (0.25 mg i.p. day 2 and day 4 post-transplantation) alone or in conjunction with RhoA/ROCK inhibitors. We screened six RhoA/ROCK inhibitors: Azaindole-1, Fasudil (HA-1077) HCl, GSK 269962A, SAR-407899, SB 772077B dihydrochloride and SLX-2119 for their ability to inhibit chronic rejection of heterotopically transplanted mouse cardiac allografts. We also tested macrophage infi ltration using macrophage markers and immunostaining.",

Introduction: There is no published data on the risks and benefi ts of Induction immunosuppression in simultaneous heart/kidney transplant (SHKT) patients. Methods: We analyzed all SHKT performed between 1987-2015 using the national OPTN registry. Patients were stratifi ed in to three groups based upon their induction regimen: anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG); IL2 receptor blockers (IL2RB) and no-induction (NI).

            "text": "Hazard Ratio (95%CI) p-value Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) occurs in 10%-20% of cardiac transplant patients and is associated with increased mortality. The endomyocardial biopsy, used to identify microvascular injury with intravascular macrophages, activated endothelial cells, immunohistochemical (IHC) evidence of complement deposition, and/or > 10% intravascular macrophages within capillaries, remains the primary diagnostic tool for AMR. However, as recently addressed at the XIIIth Banff Allograft Pathology Conference, identifying the intravascular location of macrophages by routine histology can present diagnostic challenges. This prompted us to perform a screen of cardiac transplant cases to determine if double labeling with an endothelial and histiocytic marker could improve diagnostic accuracy. Twenty-two cardiac transplant endomyocardial biopsies previously diagnosed at a high-volume transplant center as pAMR-2 based on histologic evidence of endothelial activation, endothelial deposition with C3d or C4d or >10% intravascular macrophages were screened using a CD68/CD31 IHC double stain. To determine whether the diagnosis of pAMR-2 would be altered using the double stain, CD68 positive intravascular macrophage percentages were calculated and retrospectively compared in the same cases previously diagnosed using CD68 IHC alone. The CD68/CD31 double stain showed 13 of 22 (57%) cases which had been previously been diagnosed as >10% using a CD68 IHC stain alone, had <10% CD68 positive intravascular macrophages. Use of the double stain altered the diagnosis of pAMR-2 in 33% of cases. The double stain showed a discrepancy of overcalling intravascular macrophages by >30%, >20% and >10% in 26%, 12% and 23% of cases, respectively. The mean C4d positivity by immunofl uorescence was 75% (N=12), 37% for C3d by IHC (N=8), and 30% for >10% CD68 by IHC (N=22). The patients (mean age 51 years, 27% female) had 45 months posttransplant follow up, and a third previously had left ventricular assist devices. Based on our institution's experience at a high cardiac transplant volume center, over a third of patients were over-diagnosed as pAMR-2 using CD68 by IHC alone. We demonstrate here the value of using a CD68/CD31 double stain to accurately determine the percent of intravascular macrophages to diagnose the \"I\" component of pAMR-2. ",

HLA serological antigen mismatch between the recipient and donor at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DRB3/4/5 and -DQ was assessed. HLA antibodies were tested quarterly for the fi rst year and yearly thereafter using single antigen bead based assay. Results: More HLA antigen mismatch was present at the HLA-B locus as compared to the other loci (p< 0.05, Fig 1A) . We identifi ed 76 recipients that developed 95 de novo DSA. 69 (73%) of these de novo DSA were against HLA-DQ. In contrast, only 4 DSA were against HLA-A, 4 were against HLA-B, 3 were against HLA-C, 3 were against HLA-DRB1, and 12 were against DR51/52/53. The ratio of HLA-DQ de novo DSA to HLA-DQ mismatches was 10%, which was much higher than other HLA loci (Fig1B). Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that the high frequency of HLA-DQ de novo DSA is not dependent on the number of mismatches. HLA-DQ mismatches have higher immunogenicity than the other HLA antigens. Via fl uorescent labeled secondary antibodies, we evaluated augmented (positive both pre-and post-transplantation) or de novo (negative pre-transplantation) antibody response in these patients. Results: 6 out of 7 patients displayed an elevated general IgG immune response towards the array proteins during a rejection episode compared to the pre-transplant state. 14 antibodies (8 skin specifi c and 6 nuclear antibodies) showed to be up-regulated during a rejection episode in at least 50% of the patients.",

Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) would likely be more widely performed if maintenance immunosuppression was not essential for graft acceptance. Accordingly, we used murine models of heterotopic and orthotopic limb transplantation (BALB/c->C57BL/6) to assess the potential for peritransplant therapy to promote long-term VCA survival. Injection of CD40L mAb (MR-1) and donor splenocyte transfusion (5x10 6 cells), plus 30 days of rapamycin (RPM, 2 mg/kg/d, Alzet pumps) induced long-term VCA survival (>100 days, p<0.01). Likewise, CTLA4Ig (500 \u03bcg, i.p., on days 0, 2 and 4) plus RPM also induced long-term orthotopic VCA survival (>100 days, p<0.01). The success of either protocol required the presence of a bone-associated, radiation-sensitive component since removal of the long-bone or pre-transplant donor irradiation (800 cGy) prevented long-term allograft survival. Effi cacy also required a T or B cell component since allograft rejection occurred when using Rag1-/-donors; and long-term allograft acceptance could not be restored by infusion of donor bone marrow cells peripherally at the time of engraftment (p<0.05). Analysis of donor bone marrow showed ~40% of CD4+ T cells were Foxp3+ Treg cells, constituting the largest population of Tregs within the immune system. Use of a CXCR4 inhibitor (AMD3100) to mobilize donor bone marrow cells pre-transplant abrogated the effi cacy of either protocol (p<0.01), as did use of limbs from mice with conditional deletion of CXCR4 within Foxp3+ Tregs. Lastly, donor Foxp3+ T-regulatory (Treg) depletion, by diphtheria toxin administration to DEREG donor mice whose Foxp3+ Treg cells expressed the diphtheria toxin receptor, restored rejection with either protocol, whereas without Treg depletion long-term survival was associated with an active tri-lineage bone marrow. Long-term VCA survival is possible across a full MHC disparity using costimulation blockade-based approaches. Surprisingly, the effi cacy of costimulation blockade in these models depends on the presence of a population of radiation-sensitive, CXCR4+ Foxp3+ Tregs resident within donor bone marrow. The mechanisms by which these cells promote VCA survival posttransplant, including migration of donor Tregs to recipient lymphoid tissues, and the interactions of recipient lymphoid cells with donor bone marrow cells resident within long-bones, are under investigation. Background: Sensitized recipients have lower rates of transplantation and poorer outcomes. We and others have reported that the delayed administration of CTLA4-Ig can disrupt fully-established B cell germinal center (GC) responses and prevent the production of post-GC plasma cells, while Bortezomib has been reported to deplete plasma cells. When used individually, these drugs often lead to an incomplete reversal of established alloantibody responses, especially in sensitized recipients with high titers of circulating donor-specifi c antibodies (DSA). Here we tested the ability of Bortezomib in combination with CTLA4-Ig to reverse established alloantibody responses in skin-allograft sensitized recipients and their impact on bone marrow resident plasma cells.",

Background: The diversity of the B cell immune repertoire may drive humoral injury and rejection in organ transplantation (tx). Methods: We utilized advances in next-generation sequencing of B cells and custom computational pipelines to study functionally correlated variations in the VDJ and CDR3 regions, examining 124 DNA and RNA samples from the same tx patient over serial times before tx, and at 6 and 24 mo post-tx. Each blood sample was paired with a kidney tx bx scored by progressive changes in the chronic allograft damage index (CADI) over time. Three patient groups sorted into non-progressors (NP), progressors/ no rejection (PNR) and progressors/ with rejection (PR). The immune repertorie was studied by (1) analyzing diversity measures (richness and entropy) longitudinally using linear-mixed effect model and (2) performing network analysis to characterize clonal expansion. We have defi ned a network for each sample where each vertex in the network represents a B-cell sequence where the size is defi ned by all the identical sequences. Edges are calculated using the clone defi nition (same V and J segments, same CDR3 length and 90% nucleotide identity between CDR3s) and clusters represents each clone in the repertoire. Gini index is calculated for vertex size and cluster size distribution. Results: Pre-tx immune repertoire diversity was signifi cantly greater in patients that went on to reject their tx (PR vs NP, p = 0.008). Post-tx, there was a strong interaction between clinical outcome (CADI score, AR) and time, with a signifi cant reduction in clonal diversity (p = 0.05) in PR, and an increase in NP, combined with relevant changes in the Gini index applied to vertex size and cluster size from the network analysis at 24 mo post tx (PR vs. NP, p=0.003 and p=0.001).

            "text": "Conclusions: The diversity of recipient B cell immune repertoire plays a major role in driving AR and progressive chronic tissue injury, and this effect can be observed even prior to engraftment of the tx organ. Selected dominant clones expand in patients who reject allografts, and the preservation of these dominant clones results in a reduction in of their overall repertoire diversity. Pre-tx prediction of recipient risk of rejection, irrespective of the donor organ, provides a powerful approach for precision medicine in organ tx. Despite the use of immunosuppressive drugs, allograft rejection remains a major hurdle for the long-term success of organ transplants. Burgeoning evidence implicates memory B cells (MBCs) in allograft rejection. MBCs are long-lived, quiescent lymphocytes that form during an initial antigen encounter, and persist to mount a more rapid, potent response to rechallenge with the same antigen. MBCs form the basis of the long-term protective immunity induced by vaccination, but can mediate allograft rejection in the context of transplantation. In order to target MBCs responsible for transplant rejection, it is important to understand the mechanisms of MBC survival. Autophagy, a process for lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic cargo, has been shown to be vital for MBC survival. We hypothesize that autophagy maintains MBC survival by regulating mitochondrial homeostasis. The Bcl-2 family proteins Bnip3 and Nix mediate mitophagy, the selective clearance of mitochondria by autophagy. To study the role of mitophagy in MBC survival, we generated mice with B cell-specifi c deletion of Bnip3 and Nix (B/ Nix -/-Bnip3 -/-). We immunized WT and B/Nix -/-Bnip3 -/mice with the model antigen NP-KLH to induce MBC formation. By ELISA and fl ow cytometry, we fi nd that B/Nix -/-Bnip3 -/mice have normal primary antibody responses and form MBCs normally. However, B/Nix -/-Bnip3 -/mice lose MBCs over time (Fig. 1a) . Microscopy shows that Nix -/-Bnip3 -/-MBCs have impaired mitophagy and increased mitochondrial mass (Fig. 1b-c) . Moreover, transcriptional and extracellular fl ux analyses indicate that Nix -/-Bnip3 -/-MBCs have altered mitochondrial metabolism, which may inhibit their survival. Overall, our results reveal a key role for mitophagy in MBC maintenance. Mitophagy may thus present a therapeutic target to attenuate MBC-mediated allograft rejection. ",

Background: Towards the goal of utilizing more livers for transplantation, transplant centers are looking to increase the use of organs from marginal donors. Livers from these donors, have been shown to be more susceptible to preservation and reperfusion injury. CD47 regulates NO signaling. At the time of reperfusion, a paradoxical up-regulation of its ligand thrombospondin-1 has been found to inhibit CD47 signaling, leading to decrease NO signaling and tissue perfusion. Methods: Using a porcine model of donation after cardiac death (DCD), we studied the use of antibody-mediated CD47 blockade to improve liver graft function undergoing normothermic machine perfusion. Livers from 20 pigs (5 per group) were brought under either 30 or 60 minutes of warm ischemia time (WIT) followed by the administration of treatment (antiCD47) or control (IgG) and 6 hours of normothermic liver perfusion (NELP). Results: ALT, AST, and bile production were determined at the end of NELP (6 hours) to assess liver function in all groups (A). The 60WIT control group had the highest ALT and AST levels after 6 hours of NELP compared to the rest of groups (p=0.0014 and p=0.0220, respectively).

The control group showed higher expression of Caspase-3 after 6 hours of NELP (p=0.0428). pERK levels were analyzed by Western Blot in 60WIT livers as a marker of liver regeneration.

The goal of this study was to test how increased CIS time infl uences humoral alloimmunity using a mouse model of renal transplantation. B6 (H-2 b ) mice received BALB/c (H-2 d ) renal allografts subjected to 0.5 h or 6 h CIS in University of Wisconsin solution (0.5 h CIS and 6 h CIS groups). Second recipient kidney was removed at the time of transplantation. Compared to 0.5h CIS, recipients from 6 h CIS group had increased titers of donor-MHC class II but not class I reactive IgG DSA, elevated frequencies of both class I and class II-reactive antibody secreting cells and higher frequencies of donor-reactive IFN\u0263-secreting T cells on d.14 posttransplant. Renal allografts from this group had signifi cantly higher proportion of glomeruli infi ltrated with macrophages compared to 0.5 h CIS controls. B cell depletion with anti-mouse CD20 mAb inhibited DSA generation and reduced intragraft C4d deposition and macrophage glomerular infi ltration on d.14. In addition, B cell depletion resulted in decreased priming of donor-reactive IFN\u0263-secreting T cells and reduced T cell infi ltration into the graft. Regardless of CIS duration, serum creatinine levels were <0.6 mg/dl in all recipients at d. 60 posttransplant (<0.4 mg/dl in non-transplanted mice). By d. 60, the grafts from 0.5 h CIS group had moderate segmental sclerosis in a limited number of glomeruli. In contrast, 6 h CIS grafts had extensive glomerular injury including thickened capillary loops, segmental or global sclerosis and thrombotic microangiopathy with red cell congestion, intracapillary fi brin thrombi, mesangiolysis and elevated intragraft levels of acute kidney injury markers NGAL and osteopontin.

Background: Circulating exosomes isolated from lung transplant recipients (LTxRs) with acute or chronic rejection contains lung self-antigens (SAgs), K alpha 1 tubulin (K\u03b11T) and collagen V (Col-V), and have been proposed to play a role in inducing immune responses leading to rejection. The goal of this study is to determine whether primary graft dysfunction (PGD), a known risk factor for rejection, will lead to exosome induction from the transplanted lungs and to determine the role of persistence of the exosomes in the clinical course. Methods: Ten LTxRs with grade 3 PGD and 5 without PGD (ISHLT criteria) were included in this study. Sera were collected 48hrs following LTx and at 30 days, exosomes were isolated using the ultracentrifugation method. Purity of the exosomes was assessed by western blot using CD9 and electron microscopy. Exosomes isolated from sera at 48hrs were characterized for SAgs (K\u03b11T, Col-V), MHC class II molecule and CIITA, transcription factors (NF-kB, HIF-1\u03b1), Adhesion molecules (ICAM, VCAM), co-stimulatory molecules (CD80-86), and alpha subunit of 20S-proteasome using western blot. We also isolated exosomes from all PGD 3 LTxRs on day 30. Results: Exosomes isolated from sera of PGD 3 LTxRs demonstrated increased levels of SAgs in comparison to PGD grade 0 LTxR (1.4 fold increase in Col-V (p=0.06) and 1.7 fold increase in K\u03b11T (p=0.04)). The exosomes also contained increased levels of MHC class II (6.6 fold increase p<0.001), CIITA (4.3 fold increase p<0.001) along with adhesion molecules (6.9 and 4 fold increase in ICAM and VCAM p<0.001), transcription factors (0.8 and 6.9 fold increase HIF-1\u03b1 and NFkB (p<0.001)) and co-stimulatory molecules (6.6fold increase in CD80 and 7 fold increase in CD86 (p<0.001)) and 20S proteasome ( Although pre-clinical studies have reported the effi cacy of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) to protect livers from ischemia-reperfusion injury, its clinical relevance in liver transplantation (LT) has not been defi ned. In addition, cell-specifi c SIRT1 function and underling mechanisms to regulate innate immune response remains to be elucidated. Ikaros, a tumor suppressor of lymphoid lineage, is expressed in all hematopoietic cells, while its role in macrophage is unknown. We aimed to determine the clinical relevance of SIRT1 as well as to identify the signifi cance of novel macrophage SIRT1-Ikaros axis in LT. Liver biopsies were collected at 2h post-reperfusion from 60 human adult primary LT recipients recruited under IRB protocol. SIRT1 levels were analyzed by Western blots and patients were divided into low-SIRT1 (n=30) and high-SIRT1 (n=30) groups. The high-SIRT1 group had depressed cleaved caspase-3 (0.54\u00b10.06 vs. 1.00\u00b10.14, p<0.05); lower sALT (238\u00b128 vs. 488\u00b165 IU/L, p<0.05) and sAST (281\u00b141 vs. 766\u00b1325 IU/L) at POD1; and superior post-LT survival (2-year, 94.9% vs. 83.7%) with median follow-up of 940 days. Next, to determine the cell-specifi c SIRT1 function, groups of myeloid-specifi c SIRT1 (mSIRT1) knockout and WT mice (n=7-9/gr) were subjected to partial hepatic warm ischemia (90min) followed by reperfusion (6h Many preclinical studies on protective functions of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; hsp32) in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) have encouraged application of HO-1 inducing regimens in clinical OLT as well as increase the necessity of criteria to quest for putative clinical responders. Human HO-1 gene expression is modulated by polymorphism genotype, while previous clinical studies showed donor HO-1 genotype to correlate with clinical outcomes. However, the signifi cance of recipient HO-1 inducibility remains unknown. We aimed to determine whether recipient HO-1 status may affect graft HO-1 levels and outcomes. Fifty-one liver transplant patients were recruited under IRB protocol. Liver biopsies sampled pre-transplant (prior to put-in) and 2h post-reperfusion (prior to abdominal closure) were analyzed by Western blots. Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) represents a major risk factor of early graft dysfunction and acute/chronic rejection as well as a key obstacle to expanding the donor pool in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Although glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling may enhance graft cytoprotective programs, clinical use of glucocorticoid is limited due to its adverse effects, while clinical relevance of GR-facilitated cytoprotection in OLT recipients remains unknown. We aimed to evaluate the signifi cance of hepatic GR in clinical OLT and verify the impact of recombinant human relaxin (rhRLX), which may function as a GR agonist in tissue/disease-specifi c manner. Fifty-one liver transplant patients were recruited under IRB protocol. Liver biopsies were collected after cold storage (prior to put-in) and 2h post-reperfusion (prior to abdominal closure), followed by Western blot-assisted analyses. Forty-three percent of OLTs failed to increase GR peri-operatively under the surgical stress.

Livers were perfused through portal vein and hepatic artery in physiologic fl ows and pressures with perfusate based on human red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma.

These results indicated the safety and feasibility of our NMP preservation and potential benefi ts to protect and predict liver viability. Introduction: Steatosis is the leading reason for donor livers discarding and contributes signifi cantly to the worsening shortage of organs for transplantation. Steatotic livers commonly fail to recover function during ex-vivo normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). Whether extra-corporeal delivery of therapeutic agents could rescue more steatotic organs is not yet known. We aimed to assess the effect of a defatting cocktail tested in-vitro, using primary human hepatocytes, on lipid metabolism and viability recovery of steatotic donor livers during NMP. Methods: Six human livers designated histologically macrosteatotic were perfused using NMP for up to 24 hours after cold storage. They were randomly allocated to an intervention group in which the perfusate was supplemented with the combination of drugs and a control group that received only the vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]<0.1%). Viability based on lactate clearance criteria was assessed at 4 hours. Tissue biopsies, perfusate and bile were sampled and measurements compared using non-parametric tests. Results: Donor baseline donor demographics were comparable between the groups. The median cold ischemia time was 11:51 (interquartile range 10:10-12:53) hours that was similar in both groups (p>0.99). Treatment with the cocktail resulted in a 3-fold increase in the total cholesterol in the perfusate (p=0.043) and 2.5-fold increase in triglycerides (p=0.044) compared with control livers over 12 hours. Histology showed a reduction of 18% in large droplet macrovesicular steatosis (p=0.020) over 12 hours in the treated group. Bile production was also improved in the treated group at 12-hour ( ",

            "text": "Abstract# 201 Introduction:Physiologic fl ows and pressures need to be provided by the ex vivo liver perfusion device. We hypothesized that the 1-pump designed machines would provide the same hemodynamic output provided by the 2-pump designed perfusion machines. Methods: 11 human livers that were declined for transplantation were ex vivoperfused for 8 h at 37\u00b0C with an oxygenated solution based on red blood cells and plasma, using either two pump design (n=6) or one pump design (n=5) to provide a pressure controlled continuous perfusion to the hepatic artery and portal vein.Both groups were tested during the perfusion for Hemodynamic feasibility and safety including markers of hemolysis. Results: During perfusion, the hepatic artery and portal vein hemodynamic parameters were within physiologic values in both groups with no signifi cant difference between the two groups. We observed no signifi cant drop in the hemoglobin or hematocrit in the two groups during the entire perfusion. Similarly no signifi cant increase in the potassium levels was reported in the two groups to suggest hemolysis. Background: Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a multifactorial process that impact liver graft function. Donor quality plays a critical role during IRI and early graft outcomes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) provide a novel source of valuable biomarkers. We propose that EV-miRNAs are leaking from the liver donor into the perfusate and that these markers refl ect organ quality and relate to allograft function-post-transplant. Samples and Methods: We evaluated perfusate (10 cc) from 31 liver grafts obtained at pre implantation at the end of cold ischemia time (CIT) Our studies include determination of EV size(Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensing (TRPS) and Cryo-Electron Microscopy (CEM)), quantifi cation (using TRPS and Imaging Flow Cytometry (IFC)) and phenotyping (using IFC).Deceased donor (DD) livers included standard, extended criteria donor as well as partial (living donor (LD)) grafts. EV-miRNAs were evaluated using miScript miRNA PCR Array Human Liver miFinder 384H. For identifi cation of differentially expressed EV-miRNAs the \u2206\u2206C t method was used. CIT, donor age, and transaminase levels at day 1 and 2 post-transplant were included as part of the analyses. Results: Using a volume of 200 cc of perfusate, we were able to quantify ~ 1.5E+08 EVs. The effect of CIT on perfusate EV-miRNA profi les from DD (CIT > 4 hours) and LD organs (CIT < 1 hour) showed increase of miR-5701 and a decrease of miR-122-5p, miR-260a. miR-19a-3p, miR-3183, miR-4301, and miR-92a-3p. Older donors livers (> 65 years old) showed a signifi cant up regulation of miR 122-3p, miR-122-5p, miR-1260 and miR-192-5p in their perfusates compared to young donor livers. Furthermore, a signifi cant increase of AST/ALT on recipient at 24 hrs post-transplantation relates to increased expression of miR-101-3p, miR-106b-5p, miiR-142-3p, miR-199b-3p, miR-22-3p, miR-29a-3p, miR-29b-3p, and miR-29c-3p. Conclusions: Perfusate EV-miRs are excellent candidates as markers of donor quality and tissue injury, they provide information about parent affected liver cells and the profi les relates to early graft outcomes. Further evaluation of cellular origin affected pathways may lead to discovery of target for therapeutic interventions. While end-ischemic dual hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (DHOPE) resuscitates mitochondria and reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury, normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) allows for ex-situ functional testing of donor livers. We established a combined protocol of one hour DHOPE, followed by controlled oxygenated rewarming (COR), and NMP for resuscitation and functional testing of high risk donor livers that were initially declined for transplantation nationwide, with the purpose to expand the donor pool. From July until October 2017, three livers were included. To facilitate machine perfusion at different temperatures an acellular perfusion fl uid containing an hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC) was developed. Livers were deemed transplantable if bile production was \u2265 10 g, biliary pH >7.45, and perfusate pH and lactate levels normalized within the fi rst 150 min of NMP. Median cumulative bile production was 57 g at 150 min of NMP. Liver 1 reached normal perfusate pH and lactate levels, as well as a biliary pH of 7.55 within 150 min of NMP. Perfusate peak ALT was 540 IU/L. This liver was transplanted, with the recipient in excellent condition at 3 months of follow-up. Liver 2 reached normal perfusate pH and lactate levels within 150 min of NMP, but biliary pH was 7.39. Perfusate peak ALT was 4215 IU/L. Liver 3 did not reach normal perfusate pH and lactate levels within 150 min of NMP. Moreover, biliary pH was 7.32 and perfusate Peak ALT 8460 IU/L. Livers 2 and 3 did not meet the viability criteria and were therefore discarded. Sequential DHOPE, COR and NMP, using an acellular fl uid containing an HBOC, is feasible and enables both resuscitation and viability testing of high risk donor livers prior to transplantation. This protocol provides a tool to expand the donor pool by selecting initially declined donor livers that can be transplanted. INTRO: CAAMR after kidney transplantation (KTx) is associated with rates of allograft failure approaching 50% at 2 years from injury involving T cells, B cells, and donor specifi c antibodies (DSA). Tocilizumab(TOC) is a monoclonal antibody that inhibitis IL-6, a regulator of T-and B-cell activation, and has been used to desensitize waitlisted patients. We report our experience using TOC in patients(pts) with CAAMR. METHODS/RESULTS: Since 2015, 20 pts received TOC 8 mg/kg with >3 months follow up added to tacrolimus/mycophenolate/pred for CAAMR refractory to treatment. Mean age at KTx was 37\u00b111.5 years, most were female (16), and received live donor KTx(14). All patients had prior AMR with DSA-Class I=4, Class II=9, Class I&II= 7 -that persisted despite plasmapheresis (9) , IVIG at 2 gm/kg(11), rituximab (5) . 16 patients also had prior ACR (borderline=9, 1A=3,1B=3, 2A=1). TOC was started an average 1648\u00b11420 days after transplant, with a starting creatinine-=2.35\u00b10.95, and given an average 323\u00b1281 days. In the 3 months prior to initiation of TOC, eGFR declined by 3.9 cc/min each month, compared to 0.05 cc/min each month on TOC(p= 0.008). Proteinuria also stabilized on TOC-initial urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPC) of 1.01(\u00b11.1) vs 0.80 (\u00b11.1) at f/u. Stabilization was not dependent on level or type of DSA, and nor did DSA change signifi cantly during follow up. There were 3 ACRs (2borderline & 1B=1) and one patient with recurrent AMR after stopping TOC that responded to re-initiation. There were 2 cases of BK viremia (0 nephropathy), 1 EBV viremia, and 1 hospitalization for pneumonia. Only one patient stopped due to infusion related reactions. There was 1 patient with primary nonfunction due to unresolving ATN+AMR and 2 graft failures (1 non-compliance and 1 progressive rejection). CONCLUSION: CAAMR is diffi cult to treat and associated with high rates of graft failure. In a group of patients with CAAMR refractory to other treatments, addition of TOC to a regimen of tac/mycophenolate/prednisone stabilized eGFR the majority despite persistent DSA with few infectious complications. KTR with multi-organ transplants, primary graft non-function or without allele-level HLA types were excluded. All and antibody-verifi ed eplets (www.Epregistry.com.br) were ascertained from allele-level donor-recipient HLA types imputed from serologic types by the National Marrow Donor Program algorithm. We fi t multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to determine the independent association between class I (HLA-A and -B) and II (-DR) eplet mismatches and death-censored graft loss. All-cause graft loss was a secondary endpoint.",

Some researchers believe that i-IFTA represents chronic active T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR). The alternative view is that i-IFTA represents a response to wounding caused by continuing nephron injury. We analyzed our indication biopsies that had been scored for i-IFTA to determine the frequency of histologic or molecular TCMR and its role in i-IFTA. One pathologist scored i-IFTA in 234 biopsies, blinded to molecular results. Using our Molecular Microscope\u00ae diagnostic system (MMDx), based on the gene expression, we conducted the archetypal analysis (a meta-classifi er based on seven molecular classifi ers) and assigned biopsies to three molecular diagnoses: antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), TCMR and no rejection. We also assigned molecular scores of kidney injury (AKI) and T cell burden (QCAT). We compared biopsies with iIFTA to those with no i-IFTA. The i-IFTA biopsies had a higher frequency of histologic ABMR (31%) and by MMDx (37%) but not TCMR (histology 8%; MMDx 6%).

I-IFTA biopsies also had higher molecular classifi er scores for ABMR but not TCMR. TCMR classifi er scores in i-IFTA>0 biopsies were below 0.10 cut off for positivity. We conclude that i-IFTA is a refl ection of infl ammation triggered by the response to wounding and is seldom associated with TCMR (confi rming the Banff criteria). The injury triggering i-IFTA should be identifi ed if possible, e.g. ongoing ABMR, recurrent disease, recent successfully treated TCMR. Prognosis is worse for kidneys with i-IFTA because they are experiencing some process inducing parenchymal injury, and the infl ammation in scarred areas refl ects the response to wounding and not active TCMR. Introduction: Basiliximab, alemtuzumab, and thymoglobulin are the most commonly used induction agents in the US. While many centers use depleting antibody induction therapy in patients with DSA, the optimal induction for patients without pre-transplant DSA is not completely understood. The goal of this study is to compare the incidence of de novo DSA (dnDSA) and outcomes between induction therapies in patients with no pre-transplant DSA. Methods: 1,147 adult patients undergoing kidney transplantation at a single high-volume institution between January 2013 and May 2017 were identifi ed. Patients receiving multiple or no induction agents were excluded. 782 patients were identifi ed as having a negative virtual cross match (VXM) (absence of DSA) and were included in this study. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the incidence of dnDSA and allograft survival between induction therapies in this group. DnDSA is defi ned as the development of new post-transplant DSA, at any MFI level. Results: Of 782 included patients, the majority received basiliximab at 66.8%; 11.1% received alemtuzumab and 22.1% received thymoglobulin. Patients receiving alemtuzumab were less sensitized, more likely to be white, and younger (p<0.01). The overall incidence of dnDSA at 1 year in patients with a negative VXM was 7.2%. Patients who received alemtuzumab had the highest rate of dnDSA at 14.5% compared to 5.4% and 8.9% in the basiliximab and thymoglobulin groups, respectively (p=0.009).",

There was no difference in graft survival for patients that developed dnDSA within 1 year after transplant compared to those that did not develop dnDSA. Conclusion: Alemtuzumab is associated with signifi cantly higher rates of dnDSA in patients with no pre-transplant DSA when compared to basiliximab and thymoglobulin but had no impact on kidney allograft outcomes. Additional controlled analyses and long-term follow up are needed to more completely understand this fi nding. The feasibility, complications and outcomes of solid organ transplantation in the HIV positive population are well documented and have had excellent outcomes with a slight increased risk of rejection but no signifi cant increase in the risk of opportunistic infections compared to non-HIV population. Basiliximab has been typically used for induction therapy in HIV positive organ recipients, but there is a paucity of data regarding the use of lymphocyte-depleting agents, in particular Alemtuzumab, and the effect on rates of recovery of CD4 counts, rates of rejection and opportunistic infection. We present data from a single center gathered from 14 HIV renal transplant recipients from 2012 to 2017. Induction therapy was chosen based upon perceived immunologic risk of rejection using the same determinants (level DSA, age, cancer history) as for the non-HIV population at our institution. Six patients received Alemtuzumab (average risk), 3 Basiliximab (low risk) and 4 Thymoglobulin (high risk Conclusions: Based on this small cohort, we conclude that lymphocyte depleting agents, including Alemtuzumab, are valid options for induction in HIV positive recipients undergoing renal transplantation. Regarding opportunistic infections, a case of disseminated nocardia occurred in the Alemtuzumab group only following treatment of rejection with ATG, with a downstream effect on CD4 count recovery by 12 months post transplantation. The case of shingles at 4 months when CD4 count was <100 prompted us to consider basing duration of anti-viral prophylaxis on CD4 count rather than standard duration as applied to the non-HIV positive transplant population. Overall, rates of recovery in CD4 counts were acceptable. Apart from a case of TMA that resulted in allograft loss, rejections were mild and overall graft function was acceptable.

Results: Urinary biomarkers revealed the kidney injury and complement activation were common among deceased donors. 90% of the recipients received Thymo at a median dose of 5.8 mg/kg. When analyzed above or below median Thymo dose, higher Thymo dose was associated with DCD donor status, longer cold ischemia time, high cPRA. Thymo dose was not associated with a) recipient DGF, b) posttransplant renal function on day 7 and 12-months, or c) graft failure rate at 1 year. Thymo dose was also not associated with reduced DGF rate in organs with deceased donor acute injury (defi ned by AKIN). We noted signifi cant interaction between the 2nd tertile of urinary C5a (and a trend for the 3rd tertile) and Thymo dose on the outcome of DGF. Compared to kidneys with lower C5a levels (1st tertile) the odds of DGF were higher with elevated C5a and the use of lower Opioid exposure is a concern after live donation (LD) for transplant. We theorized that a protocol using pregablin pre-operation to desensitize nerves followed by ketorolac after surgery can control pain thus requiring less perioperative narcotics. The aim was to determine a non-opioid analgesics protocol for LD nephrectomies could decrease the use of narcotics without an increase in complications compared to standard of care (SOC There was a bimodal pattern to recipient age with biggest peak at age 65 and a second lower peak at age 37.

            "text": "Mean HLA mismatch level 3.55+/- Purpose: Living kidney donor outcomes are tremendously important, especially given expanding donor eligibility. Relative to other predictors, the relationship between remaining kidney volume and post-donation renal function is poorly understood. Methods: We determined associations between remaining kidney volume (via pre-donation CT angiography) indexed to body surface area (BSA) and 1-year post-donation renal function in 152 living kidney donors at an academic center using multivariable linear and logistic regression for continuous eGFR and chronic kidney disease (CKD, eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m 2 ), respectively. Results: Mean\u00b1SD age, body mass index and baseline eGFR were 38\u00b111 y, 26\u00b14 kg/m 2 and 97\u00b116 ml/min/1.73m 2 . 50% were male and 94% were white. Median (range) remaining kidney volume/BSA was 79.6 (47. 1-114. 2) ml/m 2 . Mean baseline (pre-donation) eGFR was greater with increasing tertiles (T1-T3) of remaining kidney volume/BSA (92\u00b114, 97\u00b116 and 107\u00b116 ml/min/1.73m 2 for T1, T2 and T3, respectively; p<0.001). There were no other signifi cant differences in baseline characteristics by remaining kidney volume/BSA tertiles. As shown in the Figure (panel A) , post-donation renal function declined and then remained separated throughout the fi rst year for T1-T3. Panel B shows that the probability for CKD at 1-year increased abruptly for lower remaining kidney volume/BSA in donors with baseline eGFR <90 ml/min/1.73m 2 , remained stable at around 30% regardless of remaining kidney volume/BSA in donors with baseline eGFR 90-100 ml/min/1.73m 2 , and did not increase above 30% unless remaining kidney volume/BSA was <55 ml/m 2 in donors with baseline eGFR >100 ml/min/1.73m 2 . As shown in panel C, each SD increase in remaining kidney volume/BSA was associated with 2.4 (95% CI: 0.7-4.1) ml/min/1.73m 2 higher adjusted 1-year eGFR. Conclusions: In this living donor cohort, remaining kidney volume/BSA was a major determinant for CKD 1 year after nephrectomy in those with baseline eGFR <90 ml/min/1.73m 2 . More studies are needed to evaluate the predictive utility of this clinical measure and its potential role in donor evaluations and informed consent. Cohorts were compared before (cohort 1, n = 55) and after (cohort 2, n = 23) the introduction of a multimodal pain control protocol. The protocol consisted of a preoperative dose of gabapentin, intra-operative local injection of lidocaine, bupivacaine, and epinephrine, intra-operative dose of IV acetaminophen and ketorolac post nephrectomy then scheduled post-operative acetaminophen, and ketorolac. Opioids and benzodiazepines were given on an as needed basis. Patients were excluded if they had history of narcotic use or had other procedures during nephrectomy. The primary endpoint was LOS. Secondary endpoints included opioid consumption, average daily pain scores, and rates of opioid-and NSAID-related adverse effects Results : Patient demographics were comparable between cohorts. Cohort 1 had signifi cantly higher rates of PCA use (p = < 0.001) and trended towards higher rates of epidural use (p = 0.1). Cohort 2 consumed signifi cantly more acetaminophen on POD2 (p = <0.001) and ketorolac (<0.0001). In living kidney transplantation, it is reasonable to believe a donated kidney's function would be associated with the function of the donor's remaining kidney. Indeed, recipients of kidney transplants from living donors who themselves develop ESRD have higher mortality and graft loss. We hypothesized that there would be an association along the full range of follow-up donor kidney function with recipient outcomes. Methods: We studied SRTR data from 2008-2016 to determine the association between early donor follow-up eGFR and recipient graft loss and mortality, using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: We found that donors with a six month follow-up eGFR<60 were older, more likely male, more likely to be white, and had lower pre-donation eGFR than those with higher follow-up eGFR (Table 1) . Their recipients were also older and more likely to be white (Table 1 ). There was an association between six month post-donation eGFR and recipient graft loss and mortality ( Figure 1 ). After controlling for multiple donor and recipient factors including donor preoperative eGFR, higher post-donation follow-up eGFR was associated with lower deathcensored graft loss (per 10mL/min, adjusted hazard ratio 0.96, p=0.02, Figure 1 ). Conclusion: Recipients of kidneys donors who develop post-donation kidney dysfunction have higher risk of graft loss after controlling for multiple donor and recipient factors. A better understanding of donor response to nephrectomy can inform recipient management. Limited health literacy (LHL) is known to adversely affect health outcomes in patients managing chronic illness. We aimed to examine the association between LHL, listing, and waitlist mortality among KT candidates, as well between LHL and postoperative length of stay among KT recipients. Methods: In a prospective cohort study of 1,544 KT adult candidates and 379 KT recipients, health literacy was assessed at the time of KT evaluation and at admission for KT, respectively (5/2014-8/2017 ). LHL was identifi ed using the Brief Health Literacy Screen (BHLS; scores range from 0-12, with higher scores indicating worse health literacy). Based on the distribution of scores in each cohort, a BHLS score>7 in KT Candidates and a BHLS score>5 in KT Recipients were used to defi ne LHL. Using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics, we quantifi ed the association between LHL with time to listing and waitlist mortality among KT candidates and between LHL and length of KT hospital stay among KT recipients. The aim of this study is to determine if transplant quiz scores given prior to discharge were predictive of known patient risk factors and if the scores were associated with clinical outcomes. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of 198 adult kidney recipients transplanted between 2014-16. All patients who completed a discharge quiz were included. The quiz included questions related to medications, lab draws, rejection, and infection. Pediatric and multi-organ transplant recipients were excluded. Univariate and multivariable statistics were utilized for analyses. Results: 198 patients were included. Quiz scores of \u226475% were more common in African-Americans (AAs), Medicaid insured, deceased donor (DD) recipients and those deemed cognitively impaired during the social worker assessment (Table 1 and 2); validating that the quiz identifi es traditionally high-risk patients.",

Our results also indicate that the VA National Transplant System does not exhibit the same pattern of racial disparities in receipt of KT as has been found in other non-VA transplant centers. We also identifi ed important risk factors for receipt of KT among Veterans. VA transplant centers can use these risk factors to identify patients who may be in need of more support to ensure they receive a transplant.

Of these, 369 (71% Black) were included in the per-protocol analysis (n=101 ET-EG, n=108 ET-PG, n=160 SOC). Exploratory analyses examined whether the effect of ET-EG or ET-PG differed by educational background (e.g., pro-transplant attitudes and self-effi cacy, previous transplant education received, health literacy and education levels) and potential transplant derailers (fi nancial stability, social support, medical mistrust).",

            "text": "In the primary analyses, ETH education conditions increased knowledge, steps taken toward KT, and self-effi cacy in comparison to SOC. ET-EG more effectively increased the number of steps taken toward KT compared to SOC among patients with more than a high school education (1.1 steps, 95% CI: 0.3 -1.9), while patients with a high school education or less had a reduced number of steps taken compared to SOC (-0.9, 95% CI: -1.6 --0.2). ET-EG more effectively increased living donor KT (LDKT) self-effi cacy for patients with insuffi cient social support (6.6 pts, 95% CI: 2.6 -10.6) than for those with suffi cient social support ( Unemployment after kidney transplant is common and creates a heavy reliance on public aid. While the exact reason for low employment rates is unknown, patients often experience deceased energy levels, increased pain, and increased depression after transplant. Greater levels of physical fi tness have been shown to improve these issues in several populations. However little is known about this association in kidney transplant patients and its effect on employment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of an original exercise rehabilitation program on the ability to fi nd employment or return to school, post kidney transplant. Thirty fi ve transplant recipients that were unemployed and not in school, at the time of the transplant, were enrolled in a 12 month randomized control trial. Randomization was set at 2:1 ratio. 22 participants were randomized to a 2 day per week resistance exercise rehabilitation program (each 1 hour sessions) and 13 patients were randomized to a control group with no exercise intervention. Both groups underwent testing at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Two markers that were assessed at each time point were employment and school status. The exercise group had a greater increase in employment compared to the control group after 12 months (41% exercise vs 15% control). The exercise group had 4 patient begin school while the control group had zero patients begin school throughout the 12 months. In aggregate, the total percentage of patients in the exercise group who found a job or returned to school was 59%. The usefulness of physical activity as a therapeutic tool to increase ability and desire for employment and education in these patients is a promising, yet an understudied concept. These data suggest exercise rehabilitation programs should be proposed post-transplant to prepare recipients to recommence work and school life. . We compared these measures with a direct measurement of TAC ingestion, the % coeffi cient of variation (CV%) of TAC trough levels assessed over the fi rst year post Tx. We examined the relationship between these measures of MNA and immunological outcomes including biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR) and de novo (dn) donor specifi c antibodies (DSA).",

However, pts with a PMBS score of \u2265 2 elements at 12 months had a higher risk of a combination of either BPAR and/or dn DSA (60%), compared to pts with < 2 PMBS elements (35%) (p < 0.001). Moreover, we found that patients with a TAC CV > 41% at 12 months had a higher rate of BPAR (38%) in the fi rst year compared to patients with CV <41% (14%) (p = 0.04). There was no correlation between TAC CV% and self-reported BMQ or any of the barrier analyses. CONCLUSION: In pediatric kidney Tx pts, self-assessment measures are poor predictors of BPAR or dn DSA. Yet, parental insight using PMBS at 1 year may be predictive of poor immunological outcomes. TAC CV% with a value of >41% is a more useful indicator of potential BPAR and can be utilized on an ongoing basis to determine high-risk of BPAR. After kidney transplantation (KTx) immunosuppressive therapy causes an impaired cellular immune defense resulting in an increased risk of BKPyV-nephropathy (BKPyVAN). Prognostic markers for the outcome of BKPyVinfections are missing. BKPyV-specifi c T cells (BKPyV-Tvis)may serve as a diagnostic parameter for the risk of BKPyV-associated complications. After KTx follow-up of BKPyV-Tvis were analysed in 42 children with current or previous detection of BKPyV-DNA in blood. Leukocytes were stimulated in vitro with BKPyV-antigens (VP1; large T) and immunostained by fl uorescent antibodies.

The outcomes after retransplantation (reLT) with a DCD liver are not known. Therefore, we aimed to assess the results of patients undergoing retransplantation using a DCD liver graft. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, all DCD reLTs in the Netherlands between 2003 and 2017 were included. For each DCD reLT, two DBD reLTs were selected as a matched control group. Matching was performed based on number of successive reLT, BAR-score, early (<3months) or late(\u22653months) reLT and year of reLT, respectively. Baseline characteristics of both donor and recipient and outcomes parameters were collected and analyzed. EAD was defi ned according to the Olthoff criteria, NAS as bile duct strictures within two years after LT at any location in the biliary tree other than the anastomosis. Continuous data are shown as median (IQR There was a two-fold increase in reporting of fertility issues (22%) compared to the general population (11%). 41% of pregnancies were unplanned. The majority of recipients were on calcineurin inhibitor therapy for immunosuppression, 37% on cyclosporine and 59% on tacrolimus; 6% of pregnancies were exposed to a mycophenolic acid product (MPA) during the fi rst trimester. There were a total of 580 pregnancy outcomes (including multiples) resulting in 397 live births (71%), 132 miscarriages (24%), 18 terminations (3%), 8 stillbirths (1%) and 5 (1%) ectopic pregnancies. There were 34 1st trimester exposures to MPA resulting in 1 termination, 2 stillbirths, 21 miscarriages, 10 live births (3 with birth defects). Comorbid conditions during pregnancy included: hypertension 23%, preeclampsia 22%, cholestasis of pregnancy 18% (general population 1%), and rejection 3%. Graft loss within 2 yrs of delivery occurred in 3%. Mean gestational age of the live births was 36.6\u00b13.4 wks and mean birthweight was 2744\u00b1785 g; 39% were preterm (<37 wks) and 31% were low birthweight (<2500 g). The birth defect rate was 5%, similar to the general population which ranges from 3-5%. The TPR has been following the children with a mean age of 9.3 yrs (age range, 0.01-30 yrs) and there are also 10 grandchildren. Conclusions: Female liver transplant recipients have reported successful pregnancies, with an increased risk of premature and low birthweight infants. Cholestasis of pregnancy is much more common in this population. The risk of miscarriage and birth defects when pregnancies are exposed to MPA in utero underscores the need for pre-conception counseling.

From start of DAA therapy to 12 weeks post therapy, the mean change in dose-normalized TAC levels was -2.5 (+ 5) ng/mL, p=0.01. (see Figure 1 ). The steepest drop in dose-normalized TAC levels occurred in the fi rst 4 weeks of treatment, after which levels stabilized. The overall mean TAC level was 4.8 ng/mL (+2.5) with a mean of 1 dose change per patient. 70 patients (99%) achieved SVR, 2 patients (3%) had ACR, 2 patients (3%) had graft loss and 2 patients (3%) died. Conclusions: From start of treatment to 12 weeks post-DAA, LT recipients on DAAs experienced a decrease in dose-normalized TAC levels. Close monitoring of TAC levels, is warranted and TAC dose increases may be indicated. Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have been used for the treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) in liver transplant patients since early on after their approval, however data in real-life settings is limited. Treating HCV after liver transplant may precipitate an immune restoration response, freeing the T-cells that were targeting HCV to recognize and attack the graft. Previous studies have shown treatment of HCV with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir appears to increase the incidence of acute cellular rejection to up to 25% shortly after the achievement of sustained virologic response (SVR). The primary objective of this study was to determine the incidence of acute cellular rejection in liver transplant patients in a singlecenter who received a DAA for HCV treatment after transplant for at least four weeks. All adult liver transplant patients who received a DAA for treatment of HCV for at least four weeks from November 5, 2014 to March 1, 2016 were identifi ed. Patients were excluded if they had a multi-organ transplant, HIV coinfection, or previous history of rejection. Charts were reviewed to identify the incidence of acute cellular rejection, SVR at 12 weeks (SVR12), graft loss, and death. The charts of 130 patients were reviewed. Of the 99 patients eligible for inclusion, the majority were male (73%), Caucasian (75%), and HCV genotype 1 (83%). Eighty-two percent were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. Less common DAA regimens studied included ledipasvir/sofosbuvir/ribavirin, daclatasvir/ sofosbuvir, daclatasvir/sofosbuvir/ribavirin, and sofosbuvir monotherapy in one patient. Seventy-fi ve percent of patients were greater than 12 months posttransplant when they were initiated on DAA therapy. Four of the 99 patients experienced biopsy-proven rejection, which is a rate of 4% and is less than the national average of 15-25%. All four patients who experienced acute cellular rejection were HCV genotype 1a and had been on ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with the addition of ribavirin in one patient. Ninety-four percent of patients achieved SVR12, no patients experienced graft loss, and one patient died of sepsis. This study did not fi nd an increased incidence of acute cellular rejection in liver transplant patients treated with DAAs for HCV. ",

Purpose: Patients (pts) bridged with mechanical circulatory support (MCS) may require more optimal donors for best outcome compared to non-bridged transplant recipients. MCS pts have more bleeding due to scar tissue and administration of blood products can potentially overwhelm the RV of the donor heart causing right heart failure. Physicians may prefer a pristine, potentially larger donor, to accommodate excess bleeding and other complications. Prior to MCS, physicians would take donor hearts even with high risk factors for their very ill pts. In the present era, we place these very ill patients on MCS thus making them stable and better candidates for HTx. However, as a result, high risk donors are no longer being taken for these pts, and they may wait for a more lowrisk donor heart. We assessed whether MCS pts did require a low-risk type donor compared to non-MCS pts. Methods: We assessed 5,826 status 1A pts awaiting HTx using the UNOS STAR fi le. Pts were divided into those with MCS (n=3121) and those without MCS (n=2705). Donor hearts were characterized by donor age, gender and BMI between both groups.

Days to HTx was signifi cantly longer in MCS pts. Donors for the MCS pts were signifi cantly taller than the non-MCS pts. Post tx outcomes were similar. Conclusion: MCS pts awaiting HTx had signifi cantly longer time in days to transplant and appeared to require a higher percentage of (larger) male donors into male recipients. This suggests that HTx physicians are more selective to obtain a more optimal donor for their MCS pts. In 2016, 47 DDHs that were recovered by our OPO were transplanted, almost a 50% increase in the past 2 years. Our SRTR ratio of observed to expected DDH placement increased in parallel to well above the national average (O:E ratio, fi gure 1).The O:E ratios are determined from national OPO performance data, adjusted for donor age, cause of death, and other quality measures. This increase in DDH transplantation to well above expectation was spread evenly among multiple donor hospitals and the centers that accepted the organs. Our conversion rate remained unchanged at 75-80%. What did we do differently? Because specialists may differ in their interpretations of donor echocardiograms, early in 2015 we began using a web-based telecardiology service to make these images available to transplant centers as part of the organ offer, together with an independent expert interpretation. At times this information confl icted with the in-hospital reading. Several centers commented that viewing the images increased their confi dence in accepting donor hearts.The increase in O:E placement ratio that occurred in 2015 was accompanied by a trend to a lower mean age for accepted donor hearts (44.6, 40.5, 26.5, and 33.8 respectively from 2013-6), suggesting that hearts from younger donors were accepted with relatively more confi dence. Graft survival from 2016 is currently 96%. Use of this strategy to increase center confi dence in organ quality could signifi cantly decrease discards of transplantable organs and increase the rate of cardiac transplantation. Figure 1 : Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical mediators of immune tolerance and are absolutely required for allograft tolerance in animal models. In addition, clinical trials for ex vivo-expanded Tregs are underway, using either bulk, nonspecifi c Tregs or alloantigen-expanded Tregs. However, the fate of endogenous, naturally occurring allospecifi c Treg populations remains to be determined. Here, we take advantage of a recently developed peptide:MHC tetramer (2W:I-A b )-based system to study an endogenous allospecifi c Treg population in a mouse transplantation model in which donor cells transgenically express the model antigen 2W. 2W + BALB/c x C57BL/6 F1 donor hearts were transplanted into C57BL/6 recipients either with no treatment or in combination with anti-CD154 and donor splenocytes to induce tolerance. Compared to na\u00efve controls, tolerant animals had a signifi cantly higher percentage (~30% vs 10%) and total number of splenic donor (2W:I-A b )-specifi c Tregs at day 7 and 30 after transplantation. The enrichment of 2W:I-A b -reactive Tregs among 2W:I-A b CD4 + cells was even more dramatic in the tolerant graft and was signifi cantly increased relative to the percentage of bulk Tregs (~70% vs 25%). We determined that the increased Treg percentages was due to the inhibition of donor-specifi c Tconv expansion and a modest increase in Treg numbers. We next tested if the accumulation of endogenous donor-specifi c Tregs in the spleen and graft was due to the expansion of preexisting Tregs by quantifying the expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 at 7-30 days after transplantation. Increased percentages of 2W:I-A b -specifi c Foxp3 + Tregs expressed Ki67 in tolerant recipients, compared to na\u00efve or acutely rejecting recipients. To test whether conversion of 2W:I-A b Tconvs into induced iTregs also contributed to increased 2W:I-A b Treg percentages, we transferred Foxp3 -CD44 -CD4 + T cells from Foxp3-GFP transgenic mice into transplant recipients at the time of tolerance induction. A small but detectable percentage of these transferred cells differentiated into Foxp3 + Tregs in the spleen and graft. Taken together, we show for the fi rst time that the increased percentages of endogenous donor-specifi c Tregs observed in tolerance is achieved through the inhibition of donor-specifi c Tconv expansion and a modest increase in Treg numbers that is dependent on proliferation of Tregs and conversion of Tconvs into iTregs. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a promising therapeutic tool for inducing transplantation tolerance. Tregs can be divided into those of thymic origin (tTreg) and those which arise in the periphery or induced in vitro (pTregs and iTregs, respectively). tTreg and iTreg share many key features such as their reliance on Foxp3 expression, but they differ in the repertoire of their TCRs and the epigenetic regulation in Foxp3 locus. Exciting new studies in the fi eld of immunometabolism have shown that cellular metabolism of different types of immune cells including T cells can affect their fate and function. Although growing insights in this fi eld suggest the manipulation of Treg metabolic traits as a therapeutic strategy, there is actually a surprising paucity of information regarding the metabolism of distinct Treg subsets and human Tregs. Here, we performed a detailed comparative analyses of human tTregs and iTregs subsets to understand their metabolic signatures. We activated ex vivo Tregs (tTregs) from healthy donor PBMCs in the presence of polyclonal stimulation and IL-2, and generated iTregs by na\u00efve CD4+ T conventional cells in iTreg skewing conditions that include IL-2, TGFb and ATRA. Using seahorse analyses, we found that by day 3 post activation both human Treg subsets similarly engage glycolysis. By day 7, iTregs showed increased propensity to favor glycolytic metabolism unlike tTregs. This correlated with a decrease in FOXP3 expression in iTregs, a feature associated with their instability. In contrast, tTregs maintain FOXP3 expression exhibiting reduced glycolysis. These suggested that each of Treg subsets have distinct requirements for glycolysis in temporally manner. To understand this further, we inhibited glycolysis by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) at the onset as well as at day 3 post activation. Notably, addition of 2DG at the onset dramatically diminished FOXP3 expression in iTregs. In contrast, inhibiting glycolysis showed at best a modest effect on FOXP3 expression on tTregs. Furthermore, once FOXP3 expression was upregulated, 2DG treatment did not affect the maintenance of FOXP3 expression for either Treg subset.

            "text": "In mice, tolerance of kidney allografts can occur spontaneously in certain strain combinations, such as DBA/2 to C57/BL6. We have previously identifi ed novel lymphoid structures in all accepted kidney grafts that may be important in tolerance induction and named them Treg-rich lymphoid structures (TOLS). Depletion of Tregs results in the dissolution of these structures, resulting in renal allograft rejection. Ectopic immune cell aggregates referred to as tertiary lymphoid organs (TLO) have been found in various chronic infl ammatory conditions. Here we further investigated the time-course by which various immune cell types infi ltrate in accepted mouse kidney allografts, the lymphoid characteristics and the functional properties of TOLS and how they differ from classical TLOs, as well as the mechanism of TOLS formation.Methods: DBA/2 kidneys were transplanted into C57/BL6 recipients. Transplanted animals were sacrifi ced at week 1, 3, 6 and 32 post-transplant. Immunohistochemical, pathologic, and fl ow cytometric analyses were performed to characterize the phenotype of graft cell infi ltrates, including structural and functional properties. CCR7 knockout mice were also used as recipients to study possible underlining mechanism of TOLS formation. The folk-hero \"Zorro\" left his mark on by a sword-slashed \"Z\". In transplant recipients, rare Tregs also leave a mark on their conventional T & B LC targets. This mark is caused by Ag-specifi c CD4 Tregs that release IL35-coated exosomes, \"cross-dressing\" (xD) their targets with IL35. Hypotheses: 1) IL35 suppression by passenger Tregs is greatly amplifi ed by xD of host T cells; 2) monitoring CD4+ T cells displaying IL35/xD-phenotype after heterotopic heart transplantation will correlate with biD regulation(HvG and GvH), and 3) that IL-35-induced \"exhaustion\" is a direct result of the IL35/xD-phenotype. Approach: We tolerized B6 \"donor\" mice with CBA DST + 125 ug (x3) MR1(anti-CD40L). We sub-optimally tolerized recipient CBA mice with B6 DST + 62.5 ug(x3) injections of MR1. On d.35, the CBA mice received either a normal B6 heart allograft(uni-D regulation) or one from a CBA-tolerized B6 donor(biD regulation).Results: While the uni-D CBA showed prolonged allograft survival, by 4 weeks all grafts were rejected.",

            "text": "When the heart from a tolerized B6 mouse was transplanted in the same recipient, all grafts survived long term. There was an initial slight increase in % surface Ebi3+ T-CD4 cells in the uni-D mice, then the % began to drop at 2 wks and was even lower at the time of graft rejection (4 wk). In contrast, the PBMC-CD4 T cell % of IL35-xD cells continued to climb at 2 & 4 wks in the biD group, after which the level stabilized, suggesting an amplifi ed impact of IL35 exosome production from the donor side. Population microscopy, depicting IL35-xD cells showed punctate surface staining of Ebi3 that was similar in CD4 T, CD8 T, and B cell subsets. A similar, but non-identical, pattern of p35 expression was seen in Ebi3-xD cells. Exhaustion was confi ned to the IL35-xD cells and was absent from non-IL35 xD cells. Conclusion: Tregs produce IL35-coated exosomes. These exosomes left a \"mark\", punctate surface IL35 expression, while also promoting exhaustion in T and B cells. Pancreatic islet allografts are effective for restoring euglycemia in type 1 diabetics (T1D) but are vulnerable to rejection by autoreactive (islet-specifi c) and/or conventional alloreactive T cells. Since T1D recipients have a memory autoimmune response, autoreactive T cells are presumed to be responsible tolerance resistance found in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D. To test this concept, diabetic NOD mice with grafted with syngeneic (NOD. Rag -/-) islets to model autoimmune disease recurrence or MHC mismatched (C57BL/6) islets to model islet allograft destruction. We determined whether CD4 or CD8 T cells were responsible for allograft tolerance resistance in NOD mice. Islet allograft recipients were treated with co-stimulation blockade therapy (anti-CD154 antibody) and / or LFA-1 blockade (anti-CD1a antibody) that individually promote tolerance in most non-autoimmune mouse strains. While one may expect that autoreactive CD4 T cells would be resistance to tolerance, analyzing islet graft-infi ltrating T cells indicated that autoreactive (autoantigen tetramer expressing) T cells in NOD mice were markedly inhibited by CD154 blockade (but not by LFA-1 blockade). In contrast, presumptively alloreactive CD4 + T cells in NOD mice readily infi ltrated islet allografts and this response was resistant to both therapies. To determine whether CD4 + T cell responses to MHC-derived or non-MHC-derived antigens drive allograft rejection, we transplanted diabetic NOD recipients with MHC-matched (B6.H-2 g7 ), minor antigen-matched (NOD. B10), or MHC class I and class II-defi cient (B6.MHC-'bald') islets. Results demonstrated marked resistance to tolerance to all types of islet allografts relative to control NOD isografts following anti-CD154/anti-LFA-1 therapy (p < .05 for all groups relative to NOD islets). Moreover, this tolerance resistance was CD4 T cell dependent and CD8 T cell independent based on T cell depletion studies. Taken together, results indicate that despite the pre-existing host immunity to autoantigens, the allograft response that was actually more diffi cult to control than the autoimmune response alone. Thus, attempts to promote islet transplant tolerance in autoimmune recipients should take into account the strength of both autoreactive and especially alloreactive CD4 + T cell responses to major and/or minor histocompatibility antigens. Purpose: The inherent challenges of selecting an acceptable donor for each of the increasing numbers and acuity of recipients has led programs to take increased risks. The outcomes of organ transplantation using organs from DWCH remained to be clarifi ed. We aimed to make an assessment of transplant outcomes of recipients using organs from DWCH. Objective: HIV-infected women and men and transplant recipients are two populations at increased risk of HPV-associated anal cancer but there is little published data. We determined anal cancer incidence and high-grade anal cytologic abnormalities (HSIL), and assessed factors associated with HSIL following organ transplantation in HIV-infected patients.",

            "text": "Conclusions: There is a high incidence of anal cancer and AIN among HIVinfected patients following transplantation. This is especially true since anal cytology underestimates the occurrence of AIN. Further studies will determine the optimal periodicity and timing of anal cancer screening among transplant recipients. Oral Abstracts subjects enrolled and 687 (53% male; 47% female) have received a transplant (50% liver, 22% heart, 22% kidney, 6% intestine or multivisceral). The mean age at transplant was 6.4 years (range 0-21 years) and 57% were EBV+, 35% were EBV-and 8% had unknown EBV status. Of the EBV-subjects, 23% seroconverted during the study period. To date, 17 subjects (6 male, 11 female) have been diagnosed with EBV+ PTLD for an overall incidence of 2.5% (heart n=5; kidney n=5; liver n=5; multivisceral n=2). The incidence of EBV+ PTLD by organ transplanted was 3.3% in heart, 3.3% in kidney, 1.5% in liver and 10% in multivisceral. The overall mean time post-transplant of EBV+ PTLD diagnosis was 18.9 months (range 1.7-43.9 months). The mean time post-transplant of EBV+ PTLD diagnosis by organ was 25.9 months in heart recipients, 17.8 months in kidney recipients, 19.6 months in liver recipients and 2.8 months in multivisceral recipients. Eight of the 17 patients diagnosed with EBV+ PTLD received induction medication and 10 were EBV-seronegative at transplant. The anatomic location of disease was nodal (n=8), tonsillar (n=1) and extranodal (n=8). In summary, we report on the fi rst large prospective US-based multi-center study on EBV+ PTLD in the era of modern immunosuppression and heightened surveillance for EBV, and observe a continued incidence of EBV+ PTLD in pediatric transplant recipients. Background: EBV infection and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are life-threatening complications of pediatric solid organ transplantation (Tx). The risk for PTLD varies by transplanted organ, with pediatric heart chronic high EBV load (HVL) carriers displaying a higher incidence of PTLD than pediatric liver HVL carriers (45% vs 3%). Previously we reported the presence of exhausted EBV-specifi c CD8 + T cell phenotypes, the increase in effector memory CD8 + T cells paralleled by the loss of the na\u00efve subset in the heart HVL carriers and not in liver HVL carriers, suggestive of different cellular mechanisms of viral control in the two settings. Therefore, we pursued transcriptomics on circulating CD8 + T cells to elucidate the pathways involved in EBV viral control after pediatric heart and liver Tx. Methods: We defi ned HVL as detection of > 16,000 EBV genomic copies/ mL blood with the qPCR assay at our institution. Previously banked 20 PBMC samples from EBV-load matched heart and liver Tx recipients were FACSsorted to obtain CD8 + T cell. RNA expression was performed with Affymetrix\u00ae gene array kit and signals were processed with transcriptome analysis console.

These may explain, in part, the failure of EBV protective memory development due to STAT3 impairment, leading to chronic memory phenotypic changes and subsequent CD8 + T cell exhaustion in the heart HVL carriers. Our laboratory has shown that LMP1 isolated from EBV-associated B cell lymphoma lines of PTLD patients contains gain-of-function mutations at AA212 (G-S) and AA366 (S-T) that result in sustained ERK signaling, c-Fos activation, and AP-1 activity. In this study, we asked whether these mutations, or other genetic alterations, are present in primary EBV+ PTLD tumors themselves. DNA was isolated from formalin-fi xed paraffi n-embedded tissue sections of EBV+ PTLD tumors (n=8). Nested PCR was used to amplify LMP1, and the PCR products generated were cloned and sequenced. The presence or absence of gain-of-function mutations were assessed. 7 of 8 tumors demonstrated both gain-of-function mutations. Furthermore, 6 of 8 tumors contained an extra repeat of 8 amino acids within the LMP1 signaling tail corresponding to a putative JAK3 binding motif. We have previously identifi ed this repeat in 3 of 6 EBV+ B cell lymphoma lines from PTLD patients. LMP1 was also cloned from the blood of a pediatric small bowel PTLD patient. In addition to these two mutations, this repeat was also present but in triplicate, suggesting this motif may be crucial to the oncogenic activity of LMP1. In order to assess host cell mutations in EBV+ PTLD tumors, a qBiomarker Mutation PCR array was performed for the PI3K/ AKT/mTOR pathway, known to be important in human malignancies. There were signifi cantly more mutations in the primary tumors, with 25 distinct mutations found within the PTEN, PI3K, and STK11 molecules. 3 distinct mutations were identifi ed in more than 1 tumor, and 4 distinct mutations were shared between a cell line and tumor.",

Our laboratory developed a murine model to study mechanisms of vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) rejection.

Analysis of transcription factors expressed by this cell type may identify potential therapeutic targets to dampen infl ammatory responses of endothelial cells in other organs. Background: Ischemia Reperfusion injury (IRI) mediated cellular senescence in kidney allografts has been linked to a loss in regenerative potential and delayed graft function. Injured renal vasculature plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of IRI where upregulation of p16 INK4a induces endothelial dysfunction in the vascular endothelium limiting its capacity to form new vessels. This loss of microvascular reserve may exacerbate renal hypoxia further augmenting tubular injury and interstitial fi brosis. Further, the potential cross talk between senescent endothelium and renal epithelium in long term repair, tubular regeneration and development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not well investigated and constituted our main aim. Methods: Mice with Tamoxifen inducible INK4a gene deletion in vascular endothelium (p16 endo\u2206fl ox/\u2206fl ox ) were generated to examine the effect of endothelial p16 INK4a on renal regeneration post 30 days IRI. Kidneys were analysed for capillary rarefaction, tubular atrophy, fi brosis and immune infi ltration by histology, immunostaining and RT-PCR. Results: The p16 endo\u2206fl ox/\u2206fl ox kidneys displayed signifi cantly reduced expression of pro-senescent cell cycle regulators p16 INK4a and p19 ARF . These kidneys also presented with signifi cantly reduced chronic tubular damage, reduced expression of renal injury markers and diminished immune infi ltration (Fig. 1) .

These observations are pivotal not only in better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying acute kidney injury but designing targeted therapies to prevent its progression towards CKD. The immunogenicity of graft microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) has immense biological signifi cance in the modulation of the local intragraft microenvironment. EC may either support Teffector activity and rejection or local immunoregulation. Studies have shown that endothelial Tie2 and its ligands, Angpts (1/2), are crucial in the maintenance of vascular stability and endothelial quiescence. The treatment of graft recipients with agonistic ligand mimetics (e.g. Angpt1) or inhibitors of pathological Angpt2 improves graft survival. However, the mechanisms whereby the Tie2-receptor prolongs survival is not known. We hypothesize that Tie2 expression on intragraft EC modulates the local environment to support immunoregulation. We screened an FDA drug library of 650 drugs, and identifi ed simvastatin (Simva) as a potent regulator of Angpt2, and we observed that it induces Tie2 expression. The Simva-mediated (0.1-30micM) increase in Tie2 expression was validated at the mRNA and protein level in human ECs (2.4 fold, n=5) and in primary mouse heart (MHEC) and kidney (MKEC) ECs (5.8 fold, n=6, p<0.01). We employed a proteomic screen using SWATH-MS, and identifi ed a Tie2-regulated protein-protein network that promotes endothelial cell as well as lymphocyte activation. Furthermore, we observed a dramatic increase in the expression of the co-inhibitory molecules PD-L1 (2.6 fold; n=6, p<0.01) and LGALS9 (~2.8 fold; n=6, p<0.001) in Simva treated EC. To test the interplay among Tie2 signals and PD-L1 expression, by using si-RNA (25nM) we silenced Tie2 (~75%) in murine ECs and fi nd that the silencing of cells is associated with a signifi cant (n=6, p<0.01) reduction in PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression. Furthermore, Tie2 siRNA transfected MHECs failed to respond to Simva with the induction of PD-L1 and LGALS9 (p<0.001). To understand the functional consequences of Simva treatment of ECs, we performed transcostimulation assays where human EC (+/-10 micM Simva) were co-cultured with human CD4+ T cells and observed Simva treatment of EC reduced ~50% (n=3, p<0.001) proliferation as compared to control ECs. Collectively, these data suggest that intragraft endothelial Tie2 may function to regulate the expression of immunoregulatory molecules on EC, which in turn supports a pro-tolerogenic microenvironment. Our fi ndings also suggest that simvastatin may be therapeutic to augment local intragraft immunoregulation and pro-tolerogenic immunosuppressive regimens to prolong graft survival. Objectives: Thrombomodulin (TM) extensively expresses on the endothelial cells in the steady state and is known to prevent hypercoagulation via combining with thrombin and inactivating its procoagulant activity. TM also has antiinfl ammatory effects. In infl ammatory situation including ischemia reperfusion injury TM is known to come off the endothelial cells. Rapamycin prevents costimulation blockade (CoB)-resistant rejection in mice and primates, and early human data suggests a similar salutary effect. We have hypothesized that one mechanism by which rapamycin synergizes with CoB may be through its direct effects on allograft endothelial cells (ECs) in addition to its known effect on allospecifi c T cells. To study this, na\u00efve or rapamycinconditioned human ECs stimulated with PMA were analyzed using fl ow cytometry (FACS) to detect the phosphorylation level of mTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) and the downstream molecule S6. The phenotype of ECs including adhesion, costimulation, inhibitory and HLA molecules was also studied by FACS, and EC production of IL-8 was analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICCS). EC-stimulated allospecifi c T cell responses were evaluated by ICCS and VPD-450 based T cell proliferation with or without a PD1 blocking antibody. Cytokine-treated ECs upregulated adhesion, costimulatory, inhibitory, and HLA class I/II molecules. Rapamycin treated ECs demonstrated reduction of phosphorylation of mTORC1 and S6 without changes in IL-8 production after stimulation. Rapamycin/IFN\u0263 treated ECs showed signifi cant reduction in CD40, HLA-DR/DQ expression (p<0.05) when compared with IFN\u0263 treated-ECs. Rapamycin/TNFa treated ECs showed higher OX40L, CD58, and HLA-ABC expression when compared to TNFa treated-ECs (p<0.05). Rapamycin treated ECs showed higher levels of PD-1L expression when compared with untreated ECs (p<0.05), while CD4 + and CD8 + cells undergoing proliferation following EC stimulation expressed PD-1. Interestingly, although rapamycin treated ECs signifi cantly inhibited T cell proliferation when compared with untreated ECs (p<0.05), PD-1 blockade did not restore the T cell proliferation to rapamycin-treated ECs, suggesting that the effect was independent of PD-1/ PD-1L interactions. Though na\u00efve T cell responses were decreased in rapamycintreated ECs, the activation of polyfunctional allospecifi c memory CD8 + cells was not suppressed by rapamycin EC treatment. In summary, rapamycin inhibits phosphorylation of mTORC1 and S6 in ECs, and alters the EC surface phenotype. Rapamycin treatment reduces the capacity of ECs to stimulate na\u00efve allospecifi c T cell proliferation, but does not impair memory CD8 cell activation, and these effects are not altered by PD-1 blockade. Our fi ndings suggest that some of rapamycin's salutary effects may be attributable to direct effects on EC alloimmunogenicity.

We hypothesized that BD donor pretreatment with recombinant human C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) would prevent progression to DGF and ABMR in a translatable non-human primate (NHP) model of renal allotransplantation. Methods: BD was induced and maintained for 20 hours and recovered kidneys were cold-stored for a 44-hour period. These were then transplanted into ABOcompatible, MHC fully mismatched recipients. Donor animals were divided into three groups: G1) Vehicle (n=3 donors, 6 recipients), G2) C1INH 500 U/kg/ dose + heparin (n=3 donors, 6 recipients) and G3) Heparin only (n=2 donors, 3 recipients). Animals were followed for a 90-day period and underwent interval biopsies. The main end-points of the study were: 1) Incidence of DGF and 2) development of ABMR within 90 days of transplant. Results: Donor pretreatment with C1-INH prevented progression to DGF in 6/6 (100%) recipients of G2 donor kidneys. In contrast, 4/6 (66.6%) animals receiving kidneys from G1 donors and 3/3 (100%) from G3 donors developed DGF (p= 0.008). In addition, recipients of G2 kidneys showed a statistically signifi cant decrease in creatinine levels in the fi rst post-operative week (p <0.01) along with a signifi cant reduction in the activation of the donor classical pathway of complement and effectors of the contact system. Furthermore, recipients of G2 kidneys expressed markedly reduced urinary NGAL levels. In tissue, macrophage and neutrophil infi ltration was limited in renal grafts from G2 C1-INH treated donors. All recipients of G1 (4/4) and G2 (6/6) donor grafts surviving beyond one week post-transplant progressed to ABMR as evidenced by deteriorating renal function, positive C4d staining, peritubular capillaritis and glomerulitis and sustained DSA levels. Conclusion: Our data supports the use of C1-INH as an innovative approach for the prevention of DGF in grafts from BD donors with prolonged coldischemia time. We did not identify a role for donor complement blockade in the progression to ABMR in this study. Introduction: MERTK is one of the TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that mediate homeostatic phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, and transmit regulatory signals that modulate immune response. Donor splenocytes (SP) treated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (ECDI) is a potent negative vaccine for induction of donor-specifi c transplantation tolerance. Previous studies have shown that donor ECDI-SP require the apoptotic cell receptor MERTK to mediate their tolerogenic effects. However, the underlying mechanism of this requirement is unclear. Methods: In this study, we address the mechanism of MERTK-mediated transplantation tolerance by donor ECDI-SP in BALB/c to C57BL6 heart as well as islet transplantation models. Results: MERTK -/recipients exhibited markedly impaired transplant tolerance induction by donor ECDI-SP treatment in both allogeneic heart and islet transplant models. Mechanistically, MERTK -/macrophages produced a markedly elevated level of IFN-a upon co-culturing with allogeneic ECDI-SPs. The high level of IFN-a subsequently impaired the differentiation and function of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Specifi cally, IFN-a compromised MDSC suppression of antigen presenting cell-stimulated T cell proliferation. IFN-a receptor (IFN-aR) was found to be expressed on monocytic MDSCs, suggesting IFN-a may be able to directly affect MDSC function via IFN-aR signaling. Supporting this possibility, monocytic MDSCs treated with IFN-a were found to readily acquire robust antigen presenting capacity, while losing their immunosuppressive function. Furthermore, IFN-a led to a complete reversal of MDSCs-induced expansion of Tregs. In vivo, treatment of MERTK -/recipients with anti-IFNaR resulted in restoration of tolerance effi cacy by donor ECDI-SP in both heart and islet transplantation models. Reciprocally, treatment of MERTK +/+ recipients with IFN-a resulted in tolerance abrogation by donor ECDI-SP similar to that observed in MERTK -/recipients. These results underscore the critical role of recipient MERTK signaling in the suppression of IFN-a production upon donor ECDI-SP and the subsequent induction of a graft protective environment. C5aR2 (C5L2/gp77) is a transmembrane receptor that binds C5a but lacks motifs needed to induce G-protein coupled signal transduction. C5aR2 modulates various infl ammatory diseases in mice and has been shown to facilitate in vitro regulatory T cell (iT REG ) induction. We tested the hypothesis that C5aR2 modulates in vivo T REG generation and T cell-dependent allograft rejection. Flow cytometric image analyses showed that murine T cells express and upregulate C5aR2 during iT REG generation. After adoptive transfer of na\u00efve WT-Foxp3RFP or C5aR2 -/-Foxp3RFP CD4 + T cells into rag1 -/recipients we observed fewer Foxp3 + iT REG in the C5aR2 -/cells (1.9 v 4 per 1x10 6 splenocytes. C5aR2 -/ vs WT, p<0.05, n=4-5/grp). Using newly generated C5aR2 transgenic mice (C5aR2-tg) we conversely fi nd that overexpression of C5aR2 in CD4 + T cells augmented in vivo iT REG generation after analogous transfer of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells into rag1 -/recipients (204.6 v 32.16 per 1x10 6 splenocytes. C5aR2-tg vs WT, p<0.05, n=4-5/grp). In a transplant model, MR1-treated B6 C5aR2 -/mice rejected MHCdisparate BALB/c hearts faster than MR1-treated WT recipients (MST 30d v 50d, p<0.05, n=7-9/grp). At 20d posttransplant this was associated with a higher frequency of donor reactive T cells (90.1 v 6.1 IFNg producers/1x10 6 splenocytes, C5aR2 -/vs WT, p<0.05) and diminished splenic T REG /T EFF ratios (0.15x10 5 v 2.2x10 5 C5aR2 -/vs WT, p<0.05). Conversely, MR1-treated C5aR2-tg recipients rejected BALB/c hearts with delayed kinetics (MST >100 days, p<0.05 vs WT) and at 28d posttransplant had fewer donor-reactive T cells (309 v 128 per 1x10 6 splenocytes. WT vs C5aR2-tg, p<0.05, n=4-5/grp) and higher Treg/Teff ratios (273.2 v 126.9 C5aR2 -/ vs WT, p<0.05). Mechanistic studies showed that Tcellexpressed C5aR2 limits C5aR1-initiated signals (pAKT and p-pS6) known to inhibit T REG induction. Our fi ndings add to the increasingly recognized function of the complement system as a modulator of adaptive T cell immunity and provide the foundation for designing therapeutics that upregulate T cell C5aR2 to increase T REG generation and suppress pathogenic T cell immunity, including those induced by transplantation. Innate allorecognition is a process by which myeloid cells, such as monocytes, distinguish syngeneic from allogeneic cells. Monocytes that recognize donor cells as non-self differentiate into monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) and contribute to allograft rejection. Initiation of this recognition process is mediated through binding of signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPa) on graft cells to its receptor, CD47, on recipient monocytes. SIRPa is an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) membrane protein with a highly polymorphic IgV domain that binds monomorphic CD47. SIRPa polymorphism modulates the SIRPa-CD47 binding affi nity such that SIRPa mismatch between the donor and recipient is suffi cient to trigger allorecognition. We have determined the degree of amino acid variability within each domain of mouse SIRPa derived from the sequences of 19 mouse strains available through Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI). Furthermore, we developed a phylogram representation of the polymorphism in SIRPa IgV domain, which shows a correlation between IgV polymorphism and the degree of innate alloresponse. These fi ndings raised the possibility that SIRPa polymorphism infl uence transplant outcomes in humans. As a prelude to testing this hypothesis, we have used the 1000 Genomes Project to identify polymorphism in human SIRPa from the compilation of multiple data sets. From this data, we have derived 13 haplotypes that occur with >1% frequency across fi ve different ethnic backgrounds, with 7 common haplotypes accounting for 88-90% of tested individuals depending on ethnicity, 2 of which account for 58-74% of individuals. We are currently using 3-D rendering to overlay each haplotype on the crystal structure of the SIRPa IgV domain bound to CD47 (from PDB) to predict if and which haplotypes could have effects on CD47 binding by altering polarity, hydrophobicity, or causing steric hindrance. Future studies will investigate associations between donor and recipient SIRPa polymorphism and graft outcomes. ",

In this multicentric extensively phenotyped population of kidney transplant recipients, we identify the contemporary picture of specifi c causes of kidney graft loss.

Our results provide the basis for using eGFR trajectory-based categorization of patients for improving patients risk stratifi cation. These results also suggest the potential for a) early identifi cation of adverse patient trajectories and the value of tailored therapeutic intervention, and b) the use of trajectory phenotypes in future clinical trials. Drug development in transplantation has diminished due to the lack of suitable endpoints for predicting graft failure. We sought to validate the performance of an integrative scoring system to predict long-term kidney allograft loss in the setting of therapeutic interventions. We used an integrative risk-scoring system, previously derived and validated in 5,125 KTR and based on readily-accessible parameters measured after transplant. We included patients who underwent standardized protocols for antibodymediated rejection (ABMR), T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR) and CNI toxicity. ABMR patients received SOC treatment by PP, IVIg and anti-CD-20 (n=224). Patients with TCMR received steroid pulses (n=143). The last group included patients with CNI toxicity converted to belatacept (n=117). All patients underwent risk score measurement at the time of treatment and 3 months after. The outcome measure was the performance of the score to predict allograft failure as compared with the actual events observed. 484 patients were included. The mean time follow-up was 4.0\u00b13.1 years. The risk score was signifi cantly modifi ed by the therapeutic interventions (mean risk score of 3.0\u00b10.8 at the time of treatment vs 2.7\u00b10.8 after treatment, p<0.001). 2 groups of patients were identifi ed by the risk score: i) Group 1 showing decreasing predicted probability of graft loss after treatment (blue lines, responders, 68%); ii) Group 2 showing stable or increased predicted probability of graft loss after treatment (red lines, non-responders, 32%). The risk score prediction capability of individual patient long-term allograft loss was highly accurate (C-index 0.84). The calibration plot showed an optimal agreement between the risk score prediction model after therapeutic intervention and the actual allograft loss. This integrative risk scoring system showed high performance in the setting of therapeutic interventions after kidney transplant, correlated well with the true clinical outcome and captured the net effect of treatment on the clinical outcome. The risk score could be used as a valid surrogate endpoint for next-generation trials and in the approval of drugs. After renal graft failure, retransplantation(ReTx) becomes more diffi cult due to sensitization to alloantigens. In 2013, our center opened a specialty clinic to maintain immunosuppression(IS) after graft failure in an attempt to minimize sensitization in ReTx candidates. We present our 1-year post graft failure cohort data. Methods: We retrospectively examined patients at a single center with renal graft failure 7/2011-10/2016 who were referred to our specialty clinic. Maintenance IS usually consisted of FK506(trough 3-6ng/mL), mycophenolate 250-500mg BID, prednisone 5mg/day. Outcomes were CPRA at graft failure and 1-year later. Also, we compared our cohort with a historical cohort of relisted patients prior to the advent of our specialty clinic. Results: Our cohort had 56 ReTx candidates. 5 patients were excluded due to noncompliance/lost to followup. 11 patients had IS withdrawn<365 days after graft failure due to complications(median 165 days, IQR 118-211).

METHODS: Patients who underwent antibody-incompatible kidney transplantation were enrolled in this retrospective study. We used Plasmafl o\u00ae OP-08W in cDFPP and Cascadefl o\u00ae EC-50W, whose pore size is smaller than OP-08W to fi ltrate Fib back to patient's plasma, in mDFPP as a primary plasma separator, respectively. Cascadefl o\u00ae EC-20W was used as a secondary separator in both DFPP. Removal rates (RR) of IgG antibodies and Fib after each DFPP per session were compared between cDFPP and mDFPP. Incidence of adverse events during and after each DFPP was compared between the groups. RESULTS: cDFPP and mDFPP were performed in 23 and 10 cases, respectively. The patient's clinical backgrounds were similar between the groups. RR of IgG was signifi cantly lower in mDFPP group than cDFPP group (62.1\u00b16.7% vs 74.6\u00b19.6%, p<0.001). Loss rate of Fib was signifi cantly lower in mDFPP than in cDFPP (38.1\u00b111.5% vs 75.5\u00b15.3%, p<0.001). Regarding adverse events, there was no hypotension event observed during or immediately after either DFPP treatment, however, incidence of hemostasis prolongation of arteriovenous fi stula was signifi cantly higher in cDFPP group (81.8%) than in mDFPP group (12.5%). This result suggested that mDFPP preserve more Fib than cDFPP, resulting in better hemostasis. CONCLUSIONS: mDFPP can remove IgG more selectively with removal rate of 60% while preserving Fib with loss rate of 40%. mDFPP is effi cacious and safe apheresis to remove donor-reactive antibody before transplant. Background ABO blood group-incompatible (ABOi) kidney transplantation is considered a safe procedure, with non-inferior outcomes in large cohort studies. Its contribution to living kidney transplantation programs is substantial and growing. The objective of this meta-analysis was to systematically investigate outcomes in ABO-incompatible kidney transplant recipients compared to centermatched ABO blood group-compatible (ABOc) control patients. Donor-reactive T-cells have been suggested to impact allograft outcome due to a higher incidence of acute celluar rejection. These donor-reactive memory T-cells rapidly acquire effector functions and have been shown to be relatively resistant to standard immunosuppressive regimens. We analyzed 150 living-donor kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) from 2008 to 2016. KTRs were grouped into 92 ABO-compatible (ABOc) KTRs and 58 ABO-incompatible (ABOi) KTRs. Samples were collected at 6 timepoints, before rituximab and maintenance immunosuppression, before immunoadsorption, before transplantation, at +1, +2, and +3 months posttransplantation, and donorreactive T-cells were measured by interferon-\u0263 Elispot assay.

We obtained renal complications including ESRD and mortality data by reviewing medical record, ESRD registry supported by the Korean Society of Nephrology, and Statistics Korea using a unique identifi er. As a potentially eligible donors, we included a total of 42,403 HCs who underwent health examination from 1995 to 2006. Before comparisons, we excluded HCs with hypertension, diabetes, malignancies, lower eGFR less than 80 ml/min/1.73m 2 , and advanced age older than 70 years. Mortality rate of both LKDs and HCs was compared with general population using standardized mortality ratio (SMR). Finally we evaluated impact of LKD on mortality using cox regression analysis. The relationship between predonation eGFR and long-term risk of postdonation ESRD has not been characterized. Moreover, while transplant centers are required to collect postdonation serum creatinine (SCr) in donors, the clinical utility of measuring early post-donation renal function is unknown. METHODS: Using SRTR data, we studied ESRD risk in 66,052 LKDs 1999-2015 who were ESRD-free 9 months post-donation and had at least one SCr reported to the registry between 3 and 9 months post-donation (6m-post eGFR), using Cox regression and adjusting for donor age, sex, race (black vs all other), 1st-degree biological relationship to recipient, and BMI. Predonation eGFR and 6m-post eGFR were calculated using the CKD-EPI equation. RESULTS: Donor eGFR declined from median (IQR) 98 (84-110) mL/min/1.73 m2 predonation to 63 (54-74) mL/min/1.73 m2 6m-post ( Figure 1) .

In a combined model, the association between predonation eGFR and ESRD risk disappeared (aHR per 10u= 0.79 0.98 1.21 , p=0.9) while the association between 6m-post eGFR and ESRD risk remained the same (aHR per 10u= Hypertension is common among kidney transplant (KTx) recipients, but the impact of antihypertensive medication (AHM) choice on patient and graft outcomes is not well defi ned.

[Results] VUR was diagnosed in 55 cases (15.5%), at a median post-KT duration of 50.0 months (range: 0 to 172). Among VUR cases, 20 were observed, 17 underwent transurethral collagen injection, and 28 received UCS. Collagen injection failed in 13 of 17, leading to need for UCS. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate risk factors for VUR. Age under 60 years, hemodialysis period >10 years, deceased donor, and atrophic bladder (capacity \u226450 ml) were signifi cantly associated with a higher risk of VUR on univariate analysis (risk ratio 3.24, 4.72, 3.30, 7.43; p=0.049, p<0.001, p=0.004, p<0.001, respectively) .

All patients underwent CT-angiography for operative planning. Most patients received a prosthetic conduit (aortobiiliac or aortobifemoral) at the time of (n=5) or prior to transplant (n=2). One patient underwent patch angioplasty and iliac artery stenting at transplant. Two patients were transplanted with donor arterial conduits arising from the common hepatic artery (n=1) and the superior mesenteric artery (n=1 Only ~50% of liver candidates undergo deceased donor transplant; 17% die on the waiting list and 20% are removed from the list as too sick for transplant within 3 years of listing. Despite high rates of waitlist mortality and dropout, 30% of recovered donation after circulatory death (DCD) livers were discarded in 2015. DCD livers provide an opportunity for donor pool expansion but are associated with lower posttransplant survival. Thus, they may not confer a survival benefi t to all candidates. Using SRTR data, we developed a liver offer acceptance decision tool and evaluated the potential survival benefi t of DCD livers across the spectrum of candidate allocation priority, i.e., model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores. Probability of patient survival (PS) for declining an offer was estimated by considering waitlist experience of similar candidates who declined offers and the probability that such experiences would lead to patient survival 1 year after the declined offer. We used offers from deceased donors recovered January 1-December 31, 2013. Posttransplant survival models used recipients who underwent transplant May 1, 2007 -June 30, 2016 . The difference in patient survival for accepting versus declining a DCD donor offer was estimated with 5000 randomly selected declined offers, 407 of which were from DCD donors. Acceptance of DCD offers was predicted to confer a 3% survival benefi t after 1 year compared with declining, although the benefi t strongly depended on MELD score (Figure 1 ). Declining a DCD donor offer and restricting the donor pool to DBD donors did not improve the probability of patient survival. Thus, DCD donors are an opportunity to expand the donor pool while conferring a survival benefi t for candidates. Background: Short wait time to LT for HCC patients may result in transplanting aggressive tumors at high risk for HCC recurrence who otherwise would have experienced dropout with longer wait time. We aimed to create a dropout risk score among HCC patients listed in long wait regions (LWR) and to apply this score in short wait regions (SWR) to evaluate post-LT outcomes. We hypothesized that receiving LT in SWR with a dropout risk score beyond a certain threshold would result in poor post-LT outcome. Methods: Using the UNOS database, we identifi ed 2,092 adult HCC patients in LWR ( Regions 1, 5, 9) and 1,735 in SWR (3, 10, 11) who received priority listing from 2010-2014. The dropout risk score was created in LWR patients using the multivariable competing risk regression coeffi cients of listing variables that predicted waitlist dropout. Results: Cumulative incidence of dropout in LWR within 1 year of priority listing was 18.6% (95% CI 16.9-20.3). On multivariable analysis of LWR patients, 1 tumor 3.1-5 cm or 2-3 tumors, AFP >20 ng/ml and increasing Child-Pugh and MELD-Na scores signifi cantly predicted waitlist dropout. These 4 variables were used in the dropout risk score (C-statistic 0.74).",

            "text": "The median dropout risk score was 14 (IQR 7-23) in LWR and 16 in SWR (p<0.001). In LWR, the dropout risk score stratifi ed 1-year cumulative incidence of dropout ranging from 7.1% with a score <7 (lowest dropout risk quartile) to 40% with a score >23 (highest risk quartile). Cumulative incidence of LT within 1 year of priority listing in SWR was 89% at a median of 2.2 months from listing. When applying the dropout risk score to patients receiving LT in SWR, 5-year Kaplan-Meier post-LT survival with a dropout risk score <30 (n=1259) was 72% compared with 60% for a score >30 (n=191) Results: There were 477,595 ESLD and 31,487 waitlist deaths. Higher CHS, higher rates of poverty and uninsurance, rural residence and lower median income were all correlated with increased ESLD mortality and lower waitlist access (p < 0.001 for each trend.) Donor Service Areas (DSAs) with higher proportions of candidates living remotely or in high-CHS counties had lower waitlist rates ( Figure 1 ). Aggregate modeled change to DSA-level transplant volume across all publicly available UNOS proposals in the last two years showed stronger association with waitlist access than donor productivity (Figure 2 , dotted line indicates national mean for access). Conclusions: Adverse local health and economic conditions are associated with reduced access to the transplant waitlist. Sociodemographic disparities impacting candidate waitlist mortality are concentrated in the same DSAs with the lowest levels of waitlist access. Proposals for broader liver sharing that use MELD disparity as an equity measure predominantly shift organs away from areas with more vulnerable patients and reduced waitlist access. (1) whether MELD and MELDNa perform well in a contemporary cohort and (2) whether incorporation of eGFR instead of creatinine improves performance of predictive models. Methods: Using data submitted to the SRTR, we examined 2 cohorts (2000-2004, n=23,852 and 2011-2012, n=13,912) of adult candidates awaiting LT. Primary outcome was mortality w/n 90 days of listing. Cox proportionalhazards analyzed the association between MELD, MELDNa, GRAIL-MELD (br,inr,grail), GRAIL-MELDNa (br,inr,na,grail) and WL mortality. Discrimination (Harrel's concordance statistic) and calibration (difference in observed vs. predicted mortality) was assessed. Results: MELD (c=0.82) and MELDNa (c=0.79) were excellent predictors of WL mortality in 2000-2004. However, the performance was worse in 2011-2012 (c statistic=0.72).

Split liver transplantation (SLT) increases organ utilization where a donor provides segmental grafts to 2 recipients. Based on OPTN data supplied by UNOS, we sought to ascertain the number of whole-organ LT (WLT) between 2007-2017 that could have been safely split to 2 recipients, and the pediatric waitlist consequences. Methods: Deceased donor (DD) suitability to split: \u226512y,<40y, donation after brain death, admitted for\u22645d, last serum sodium (Na)\u2264150 mmol/L, maximum ALT/AST\u2264120 IU/L, BMI\u226428, macrovesicular steatosis<15%, low dopamine/ dobutamine rate, no nor/epinephrine use, no extracranial cancer, donor-recipient distance<1000 miles.

Results: Of 194,695 DD, 1818 DD were suitable to split, and 588 WLT recipients could have accepted SLT; 513 had a suitable PedR who could have accepted a segment graft. A total of 274 PedR who were next on the match run, but did not undergo SLT due to lack of sharing, had longer average wait-time to transplant compared to 1644 pediatric SLT recipients during this time frame (mean 615d vs 115d, P<0.001). These children waited an additional 199d on average following the fi rst DD match run that was transplanted as a WLT instead of SLT.

Causes and preventability of readmissions should be further explored. Background: The development of direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) could allow for safe and effective treatment following renal transplantation (RT). Early pilot studies have shown that transplanting HCV D+ organs into HCV -recipients (R-), thus reducing wait list and time on dialysis (HD), then treating HCV with DAA results in high sustained virologic response. However, the cost effectiveness of such a strategy is unknown. Methods: A decision tree model was developed to analyze costs and effectiveness of a 5-year time frame between two choices: RT using a D+/R-strategy compared to continuing HD and waiting for a HCV-donor (D-/R-). We assessed the payers perspective using data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) 2016 Annual Report. Effectiveness was measured by expected years of life (YOL). Costs included direct expenditure for RT and immediate care post-RT, immunosuppressive therapy, HD and costs while awaiting RT, and HCV with 12 weeks of DAA for D+/R-patients. Medicaid national average drug acquisition cost was used to estimate HCV treatment costs. A total of 13 chance paths were modeled with an endpoint of two possible outcomes: death or alive. Patients on dialysis waiting for RT were examined at years 1, 2, 3, and 4 during the 5 year time frame. Results: The strategy of accepting a HCV+ organ then treating HCV (D+/R-) resulted in an expected 4.6 YOL with an expected cost of $154k US dollars compared to an expected 3.6 YOL with a total cost of $257k for the D-/Rstrategy. The D+/R-strategy remained dominant after one-way sensitivity analyses including adjustment for RT survival probability, DAA therapy cure rate (90-95%), waiting time on dialysis in the D+/R-strategy (0-12 months), cost of DAA treatment ($37,538-$73,618), probability of dialysis patients getting a RT in the D-/R-strategy by year (25% @ Y1, 50% @ Y2, 75% @ Y3, and 100% @ Y4 vs. base case of 0% @ Y1, 25% @ Y2, 50% @ Y3, 75% @ Y4, and 100% @ Y5), and HD survival probability while awaiting RT in the D-/R-strategy (\u00b1 20% of base value).",

By multivariate analysis, the most infl uential factors for this decrease were older recipient age and better immunosuppression. Donor factors (age, preserv. time, HLA matching) did not show any impact which may be due to an excellent donor selection process. The different duct management and venous drainage techniques did not impact outcome. Due to better donor and recipient selection, refi nements in immunosuppression and improvement in graft outcome the rate of a subsequent kidney transplant declined signifi cantly. This was primarily contingent on native graft function at the time of transplant. If the GFR was <40ml/min, 38% of patients received a kidney graft 4-years after the pancreas transplant; if the GFR was >60ml/min only 2% of patients required a kidney graft.

Over time, the recipients got signifi cantly older, the donors younger, and the preservation time shorter. Signifi cantly more patients in era 2 received induction therapy and combined tacrolimus/ MMF maintenance therapy. The time between kidney and pancreas transplant changed also. In era1 the time between kidney and pancreas was signifi cantly shorter especially after a LD kidney transplant. Conclusion: Outcome after PAK has signifi cantly improved due to refi nements in immunosuppressive protocols and better donor and recipient selection. If a living kidney donor is available, a PAK is an alternative to a SPK due to similar outcome. Introduction: While kidney transplantation in the elderly diabetic patient is an accepted treatment of the secondary complication, pancreas transplants are controversial. Many centers have an age limit of 60 years or lower for this kind of transplantation. The aim of this study was to analyze outcomes and risk factors for patients 60 years of age or older.

The oldest recipient survived after a SPK for over 11 years and died with functioning grafts after a cardiac event. Especially critical were the fi rst month posttransplant -cardio-cerebro complications and infections were the major causes of death. In all 3 categories, patient age and diabetes type were not risk factors for patient survival. Only a failed kidney graft in SPK could be clearly identifi ed as a risk factor for patient survival. Over the analyzed time, patient survival increased in all 3 categories. One and 5-year pancreas graft function was 85.7% and 70.9% for SPK, 93.0% and 71.7% for PAK, and 75.9% and 56.3% for PTA. No difference in outcome between SPK and PAK recipients was noticed. The major reason for pancreas graft loss was 'Dying with a functioning graft' in 54% of all deaths followed by pancreas graft thrombosis in 17% of all cases. All recipient received relatively good donors so that no statistical signifi cant risk factors could be determined. Conclusion: After a careful work up, pancreas transplants in elderly patients can be successfully performed and will not only improve the quality of life of the patient but also can be life extending.

The most common causes of death with functioning graft were cardiovascular complications (25%), infections (12%) and malignancies (11%). Conclusions: >10 year pancreas graft function can be achieved specifi cally in older recipients and young donors with short preservation times. Improvements in immunosuppression over time have also increased the number of grafts with long-term function. The effect of improved immunosuppressive protocols will be even more expressed in future years. Cognitive impairment in the liver transplant (LT) population could negatively affect one's ability to self-manage. This study examined cognition and its relationship with self-management in the LT population. We hypothesized that global cognition and specifi c cognitive domains would be related to selfmanagement. This cross-sectional study included adult LT recipients who had a functioning transplant for at least six months. The 30-item Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) assessed cognition. Scores range from 0 to 30, higher scores indicate higher levels of global cognition. The MoCA test was then differentiated into domains (Visuospatial/Executive functioning, Memory, Attention, and Language), based on work by Vogel et al. (2015) . The 40-item Health Education Impact Questionnaire and Basel Assessment of Adherence with Immunosuppressive Medication Scale were used to assess self-management. Self-management was classifi ed as low, medium, and high using latent profi le analysis. Logistic analysis was used to examine the relationships between cognition and three levels of self-management. A total of 113 LT recipients (mean age 61.2 \u00b1 11.1, 7.8 \u00b1 6.4 years posttransplant, 62% male, and 94% White) participated in this study. MoCA scores were 24.4 \u00b1 3.1, indicating mild cognitive impairment. Mean scores of four cognitive domains are presented in Figure 1 .",

Among the four cognitive domains, memory was signifi cantly related to high level of self-management (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.52-3.53, p<.001). This study found that LT recipients have a mild cognitive impairment and those who demonstrate better memory function are more likely to have a high level of self-management. Clinicians should regularly assess cognition of recipients and caregiver's participation in self-management for those with impaired cognition, especially memory defi cits. Future studies should explore potential mechanisms of cognitive impairment to design interventions to ameliorate or compensate for the cognitive impairment. Limitations of this study include small sample size recruited at a single center, use of single measure of cognition. Opioid use is associated with increased readmissions and mortality in the liver transplant (OLTx) population. The aim of our study was to identify risk factors for chronic opioid use in OLTx. METHODS: Single-center, retrospective cohort study of OLTx between 1/10-12/16. Data was collected via manual chart abstraction and use of a pharmaceutical claims database. Patients that fi lled an opioid prescription in more than 3 months in the year after transplant (excluding the month of transplant) were identifi ed as chronic opioid users (COU). Multivariable logistic regression with backward elimination was performed to identify risk factors for COU in the overall OLTx population, as well as the opioid na\u00efve and experienced subpopulations. RESULTS: 446 patients were included in the analysis, 101 (23%) of whom were COU after transplant. Signifi cantly more opioid experienced patients were COU after OLTx compared to opioid na\u00efve patients (69 (37.3% vs 32 (12.3%), p<0.001) (fi gure 1). In the overall OLTx cohort, risk factors for COU included lower functional status and opioid use prior to transplant (table 1). In the opioid na\u00efve cohort, the only risk factor for COU was muscle relaxant use (table 2). In the opioid experienced cohort, risk factors for COU included lower functional status and benzodiazepine use at the time of transplant (Table 3) . CONCLUSIONS: The strongest risk factor for COU after OLTx is pre-transplant opioid use. Within the opioid experienced subpopulation, lower functional status and concomitant benzodiazepine use independently impact the risk of COU. Muscle relaxant use was the only independent risk factor for opioid na\u00efve patients. Background & Objectives: Medication non-adherence remains problematic in pediatric liver transplant (LT)-estimates suggest that up to 53% of adolescents are non-adherent. We leveraged data from subjects who were enrolled in the MALT clinical trial (NCT01154075) to learn if community deprivation predicted non-adherence in pediatric LT recipients. Methods: This was a single-center pilot study. The primary outcome was Medication Level Variability Index (MLVI); an objective, validated biomarker of non-adherence. Primary exposure, derived from participant addresses, was a validated index of community deprivation using data from the US Census Bureau. The index has a range of [0, 1] ",

            "text": "Conclusion: The results indicate that adherent patients live across the spectrum of deprivation-suggesting that living in a deprived community does not necessarily equate to non-adherence. However, of the non-adherent patients, the data suggest that patients from more deprived communities have a more persistent and severe form of non-adherence. Further work is needed to better characterize this association. Purpose: Impact of nonadherence among transplant recipients has been well documented as a signifi cant contributor of allograft failure. The objective of this study was to compare medication adherence among transplant recipients who fi ll their tacrolimus prescriptions through the internet or on a mobile app versus those who fi ll through traditional methods over a one-year period. Methods:This retrospective,observational cohort study used administrative claims data from a large, U.S.pharmacy chain.Medication adherence was measured by proportion of days covered(PDC). The study sample included transplant recipients aged18+ with at least two pharmacy claims for tacrolimus at least 150 days apart between 2013 and 2016; each patient was followed for 12-months from their fi rst fi ll in the study period.The intervention group was matched 1:1 to the control group based on the following baseline characteristics: age group, gender, payor, number of comorbid conditions, annual copay, use of brand medications and use of a transplant specialized pharmacy [TSP] . Logistic regression was used to estimate the difference in medication adherence between the intervention group, patients who use digital methods for refi lls, and control group. The independent variable, digital use, was measured as patients who use digital methods for over 50% of their fi lls. The dependent variable, medication adherence, was measured as PDC \u226580% over a 12-month period. Results: Propensity score matching resulted in 1,166 patients in each group. After adjusting for covariables, transplant recipients who refi lled their medications through the internet or by scan were 1.70 times more likely to be adherent than those who fi lled their prescriptions through other methods (95% CI [1.40, 2 .00]; p<.001). A sensitivity analysis using logistic regression and adjusting for covariables without matching showed those refi lling through the internet or by scan were 1.45 times more likely to be adherent (95% CI [1.40, 2 .00]; p<.001).",

Background: Inadequate knowledge hinders informed decision making in kidney transplant candidates. We conducted qualitative interviews and focus groups with patients and providers to inform development of an online shared decision aid that provides education about options and individualized estimates of likely outcomes on the kidney transplant waitlist. Methods: In-depth interviews, focus groups, and one-on-one usability testing were conducted with 37 adult kidney transplant candidates in Minneapolis, in addition to 2 national focus groups of 13 transplant physicians and 4 national focus groups of 19 recipients between March 2016 and November 2017. Systematic inductive and deductive analyses of data were performed. Results: 16 (43.2%) candidates were female and 14 (37.8%) were Black. 24 (64.9%) had at least some college education while 3 (8.1%) did not graduate from high school. Analyses of candidate and recipient interviews revealed desire for individualized information and honest discussions with physicians about outcomes. Patients had limited understanding of options and likely outcomes, demonstrating knowledge gaps about mortality on the waitlist, likelihood of transplant, differences between deceased and living donor organs, and deceased donor organ quality. Physicians represented 7 of the 11 OPTN regions. 7, or 53.8%, reported only sometimes discussing waitlist mortality with patients. Physicians described extensive transplant center approaches to educate patients, but still felt that patients do not understand outcomes on the waitlist. Discussion: Data from stakeholders resulted in the iterative development of an online shared decision aid to guide provider-patient discussions about transplant vs. dialysis, living vs deceased donation, kidney quality, increased infectious risk organs, and individualized predictions of likely outcomes on the waiting list. Additional research is needed on whether the tool changes decisions, and how to implement decision aids into clinical practice. Although incompatibility is usually viewed as affecting potential recipients of live donors, it is also encountered in instances of directed donation of deceased donors. In these cases, the family or guardian of a deceased donor requests that an organ be assigned to a recipient in the deceased donor wait list. It has been reported (2) that \"at least 100 deceased donor transplants each year have occurred through directed donation.\" Although most chains involve only live donors, current proposals (1) consider the initiation of chains with deceased donors. Such approach could maximize the potential of chains, with the eventual return of a live donor kidney to the deceased donor wait list. Ethical and organizational concerns have been raised with respect to the initiation of chains with deceased donors. Furthermore, selecting blood type O donors to initiate chains could disadvantage blood type O wait list recipients. We believe it would be particularly interesting to develop exchanges (as diagrammed below) initiated with deceased donor kidneys from incompatible directed donations. Rather than denying the donor family and the designated recipient the possibility of a transplant, the organ would be allocated to initiate an exchange. As part of the exchange, the previously incompatible recipient would receive a compatible live donor kidney. A. Imminent Death Donation (IDD) is a term to describe organ procurement from a live donor before withdrawal of ventilator support and/or from a patient with a terminal illness with capacity for medical-decision making, who wishes to donate and not accept further life support. This study aims to serve as a literature review of the ethical issues involved in imminent death donation, specifi cally as it pertains to the key points brought forth by the OPTN/UNOS Public Comment Proposal \"Ethical Considerations of Imminent Death Donation\". B. A review of published papers was performed based on a Medline search using the term \"Imminent Death Donation\" and 7 articles were identifi ed broaching the topic of the ethics of IDD. These were reviewed and arguments for and against IDD were juxtaposed, highlighting the salient obstacles to implementing a procurement protocol that could allow for more organ recoveries with better allograft outcomes. C. Consistently, the benefi ts of IDD are summarized as follows: 1) Honoring the preferences of the donor/donor family, allowing for the goal of organ donation to be achieved more often, 2) reliable organ recovery as opposed to failure to progress to asystole 3) less ischemic damage to organs 4) more compassionate end of life care and 5) arguably, increasing the number of organs for transplantation and/or the pool of eligible donors. However, as best summarized in the OPTN/UNOS Public Comment Proposal, the concerns over IDD thus far making it impractical for implementation include: 1) the lack of defi nitions and boundaries 2) no defi nitive data to prove that IDD would increase the number of organs and/or donors 3) with the potential to decrease the number of organs recovered 4) importantly, the potential to compromise public trust and opinion on organ donation, while increasing confusion on appropriate end-of-life care and 5) lack of stakeholder buy-in or assignment of roles and responsibilities. D. Despite an agreement amongst multiple ethics committees, including that of the UNOS/OPTN Ethics committee, that IDD is a viable and ethical option for organ procurement, the Dead Donor Rule (DDR) remains a bedrock in the public and transplant psyche, that is, organ donation cannot lead to the death of the donor. In understanding the dueling arguments and biases of convention, perhaps it is time to address the need to expand our defi nitions of organ donors and the value, if any, of the DDR in our ever-evolving fi eld. OPTN/UNOS began requiring 1-year living donor follow-up (LDF) for living liver donors (LLDs) in 2014. Compliance with a similar policy for living kidney donors was low. Using national registry data, we evaluated the changes in LDF associated with the 2014 policy and identifi ed risk factor for non-compliance. METHODS: Using SRTR data on 1624 LLDs who donated 09/2010-09/2016, we compared complete/timely LDF form submissions before and after policy implementation. Hierarchal logistic regression was used to assess region-, center-, and donor-level characteristics associated with complete/timely form submissions within a difference-in-differences framework. Compliance was defi ned as both timely and complete if clinical and laboratory data submitted 60 days before or after the expected visit date as defi ned by OPTN/UNOS. RESULTS: LDF form compliance increased between 9/2010-9/2016 ( Figure  1 ). However, out of 43 transplant centers performing living liver donation 9/14-9/15, we found that only 13 (30%) centers had provided complete/timely data for 6-and 12-month LDF (Figure 2 ). Among non-compliant centers 9/14-9/15 (N=26), the median (range) number of visits that were missed but necessary to meet compliance thresholds was 4 (1-19) LDF visits. Policy implementation was not associated with change in 6-month LDF (p=0.3) or 12-month LDF (p=0.2). Characteristics associated with non-compliant 1-year LDF include younger donor age (p=0.03), lack of health insurance (p=0.03), and international donor status (p<0.001).",

Novel practices to engage living liver donors may be needed to improve LDF compliance. Background: Psychosocial criteria constitute absolute and relative contraindications to listing, which can bar patients from access to organ transplantation at a program. Refusing to list patients for psychosocial factors is ethically permissible as long as these factors distinguish those who will benefi t most from receiving an organ. Empiric evidence must demonstrate poorer outcomes in patients meeting these criteria before they can be considered contraindications. We conducted a survey study to identify variation in listing practices among transplant programs nationwide. Methods: We distributed an online Qualtrics survey to 650 active adult and pediatric transplant programs in heart, kidney, liver, and lung from August 2016 to March 2017. The full survey listed 38 psychosocial characteristics, and participants were asked 1) if each characteristic functioned as an absolute, relative, or irrelevant contraindication to listing, 2) whether their program retained formal, informal, or no guidelines regarding the characteristic, and 3) whether their program had encountered the characteristic. This study examines a subset of the 38 characteristics including legal status, criminal status, and substance use. Results: A majority of programs completed the survey (response rate = 52.8%).",

More programs considered recreational marijuana an AC (24-77%) than medical marijuana (12-59%). Compared to heart and lung programs, kidney and liver programs are less likely to consider current substance use an AC (p = <2.2e-16 ~ 0.006). Although more adult than pediatrics programs encountered patients with a criminal history (p << 0.001), 19-47% of pediatrics programs have still encountered these patients. Discussion: Transplant programs vary in how they consider psychosocial criteria in making listing decisions. Variation in practice violates the principle of equality and invites prejudice into listing process. Further research is needed on posttransplant outcomes of patients with psychosocial criteria so that programs can make evidence-based judgments. ",

            "text": "We found that T cell-specifi c conditional knockout (cKO) of the transcription factor IRF4 in B6 mice induced long-term Balb/c heart allograft survival (all > 100 days; n=6) without any immunosuppressive therapies. IRF4 repressed PD-1, Helios and other molecules associated with T cell dysfunction; in its absence, chromatin accessibility and binding of Helios at PD-1 cis-regulatory elements were markedly increased, resulting in persistent PD-1 expression and T cell dysfunction. To further defi ne the dysfunctional state of Irf4-defi cient T cells, Irf4 cKO mice were transplanted with Balb/c hearts and treated with checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-L1 plus anti-CTLA-4) on days 0, 3, and 5. All heart allografts were rejected on days 7-8 due to checkpoint blockade-mediated reinvigoration of Irf4-defi cient T cells. At 30 days after heart grafting, recipients were transplanted again with Balb/c skins. Strikingly, those Irf4 cKO recipients with rejected Balb/c heart allografts still permanently accepted the subsequent Balb/c skins (all >100 days; n=6). These results indicate that checkpoint blockade-reinvigorated alloreactive Irf4-defi cient T cells become re-dysfunction within 30 days. We used microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profi les between the adoptively transferred CD45.2 + WT and Irf4 -/alloreactive TCR transgenic TEa cells in CD45.1 + mice following heart transplantation and checkpoint blockade. On day 6 post-heart grafting, checkpoint blockade restored the expression levels of the majority of WT TEa cell-expressed genes in Irf4 -/-TEa cells, which explains why checkpoint blockade robustly reverse the initial dysfunction of Irf4defi cient T cells. However, the remaining un-restored genes (Wnt10a, snn, Lmo4) following checkpoint blockade, though minimal in number, may be responsible for the reinvigorated Irf4-defi cient T cells to become re-dysfunction. Taken together, IRF4 deletion drives intrinsic T cell dysfunction, and targeting IRF4 represents a potential therapeutic strategy for achieving transplant tolerance. Donor-specifi c transplantation tolerance has long been an aspiration of clinical transplantation. Recently, we have reported that multiple mechanisms are required to reinforce profound hyporesponsiveness of alloreactive T cells and to mediate robust tolerance. In contrast, little is known about the fate of alloreactive B cells. Clinical observations suggest that donor-specifi c antibodies (DSA) are a major cause of graft rejection despite ongoing immunosuppression, leading us to hypothesize that stable tolerance will require the donor-specifi c B cell response to also be profoundly suppressed. We used a mouse model of tolerance, where C57BL/6 recipients treated with anti-CD154 (D0, 7,14) and DST (D0) accepted BALB/c hearts for >60 days and where minimal DSA is produced. Firstly, we showed that the lack of an alloantibody response was not due to B cell deletion. Donor-MHC class I and class II reactive B cells were identifi ed using H-2K d and I-E d tetramers, and their total numbers in tolerant recipient was comparable to that of na\u00efve controls. Second, there was no enrichment for donor-specifi c B cells with Breg phenotype or function; with comparable numbers of CD93 + T1, T2 and T3 B cells, folicullar zone B cells, and in percentage of donor-specifi c B cells expressing expression of CD5, CD1d, TIM-1 and IL-10. Third, B cell unresponsiveness is not due to the absence of T cell help, and is B cell intrinsic. Adoptive transfer of B cells from tolerant recipients into naive MD4 hosts did not produce DSA upon challenge with BALB/c splenocytes, even when additional alloreactive T cells were included in the transfer. In contrast, na\u00efve B cells recipients counterparts showed strong DSA responses. Finally, we show that the donor-specifi c B cells intrinsic hyporesponsive signal is not reversed even when challenged with DST in the presence of CpG and agonistic anti-CD40. Taken together, we demonstrate the acquisition of a robust cell-intrinsic state of B cell hyporesponsiveness during the maintenance phase of transplant tolerance, that is maintained even in the absence of T cell regulation, and in the presence of T cell help and CpG plus anti-CD40. The mechanistic basis for this profound B cell hyporesponsive state is under investigation, but preliminary studies indicate defective proliferation and differentiation into germinal center B cells. Introduction: Clinical data suggest allogeneic pregnancy is a sensitizing event; yet, recent data from mouse models indicates it induces fetal-specifi c regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion that mediates systemic, fetal-specifi c immune regulation post-partum (PP). In this study, we aimed to defi ne the mechanism for acquired resistance to allograft tolerance after allogeneic pregnancy. Methods: Virgin female wild-type (WT) B/6, \u03bcKO, or anti-HEL BCR-tg (MD4) mice were mated with male B/c-2W-OVA transgenic mice. Fetus-specifi c IgG were monitored by fl ow cytometry, while donor-specifi c cellular responses were tracked using K d +IE d +L d tetramers for B cells, and 2W:I-A b and OVA:K b tetramers for CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, respectively. At PP day 30-45, F1 (B/6 x B/c)-2W-OVA heart transplants (HTx) were performed and anti-CD154 (POD 0, 7, 14) and donor splenocytes (DST, POD 0) were used to induce tolerance. Results: Fetus-specifi c IgG increased during and post-pregnancy to a 9-fold peak by PP day 21. Prior donor-matched pregnancy, but not syngeneic pregnancy, prevented the induction of tolerance in 60% of PP-WT B/6 recipients, despite a signifi cant increase in percentage of fetal-specifi c FOXP3 + cells and a modest reduction in number of fetal-specifi c conventional CD4 + T cells (Tconvs) examined at POD 21-189, compared to PP-WT B/6 untransplanted controls. In contrast, ongoing donor-specifi c germinal center B cell responses were detected suggesting a B cell-mediated resistance to transplant tolerance. Strikingly, anti-CD154/DST successfully achieved long-term graft acceptance in PP-\u03bcKO B/6 and PP-MD4 (normal B cell numbers but \u22645% donor-specifi c B cells compared to WT) recipients. Introduction: The gut microbiota induce and train the host immune system. Whether microbiota from contrasting environments of colitic or pregnant mice are pro-or anti-infl ammatory is unknown. We hypothesized that gut microbiotas from different sources could infl uence the survival of murine cardiac allografts. Methods: C57BL/6 mice received BALB/c vascularized cardiac allografts and fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) by oral gavage. FMT samples were from normal or pregnant C57BL/6, spontaneously colitic mice, or cultured Bifi dobacterium pseudolongum (Bifi do) (a dominant member of the pregnant gut microbiota). Tacrolimus was administered daily. Fecal pellets were collected weekly posttransplant and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Grafts were harvested at days 40-60 or rejection, and assessed for infl ammation by H&E and fi brosis by Masson's trichrome. Macrophage (MF) and dendritic cell (DC) lines were stimulated with purifi ed Bifi do cells and cytokine responses measured. Results: Pregnant FMT enhanced cardiac allograft survival, resulting in reduced infl ammation and fi brosis. Normal or colitic FMT resulted in inferior survival, along with increased fi brosis and infl ammation. 16S rRNA analyses demonstrated abundant Bifi do in the pregnant and normal but not the colitic FMT samples. Transfer of Bifi do alone also resulted in enhanced allograft survival and reduced infl ammation and fi brosis. Serial 16S rRNA analyses of gut microbiota from normal, colitic, pregnant FMT, or Bifi do groups, revealed signifi cant differences in bacterial community structure (alpha-and beta-diversity). Bifi do remained abundant in pregnant FMT recipient samples for at least 40 days. In contrast, Desulfovibrio and Deferribacteraceae were more abundant in colitic samples. Microbiota community structures of the various groups became less different over time, but remained distinct. DC and MF lines stimulated with Bifi do expressed higher levels of the anti-infl ammatory cytokine IL-10 and homeostatic chemokine CCL19, but less pro-infl ammatory cytokines TNFa and IL-6 compared to LPS stimulated cells.",

Background: Immune responses to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection may precipitate acute/chronic graft rejection in immunocompromised transplant recipients. CMV infection can be primary or its reactivation from the latentlyinfected graft. Achieving tolerance could eliminate both the transplant-induced infl ammation and need for immunosuppression that are thought to promote CMV reactivation. Currently, studies regarding CMV reactivation in tolerized recipients are lacking. We thus investigated the impact of transplantation tolerance on CMV reactivation and graft-function. Methods: Balb/c mice were infected with the murine CMV strain \u2206m157 to develop latency over 3 months. The kidneys from latently infected mice (D+) were transplanted in na\u00efve C57BL/6J recipients (R-). The transplant groups included: 1) Control group (CT; untreated); 2) Immunosuppression group (IS; received antilymphocyte serum on days -1, 1, 3, & 5, tacrolimus, and dexamethasone on days 0-7, then thrice weekly until day 28); 3) Tolerized group (tolerance was induced by infusing donor apoptotic splenocytes pre-treated with the chemical cross-linker ethyl carbodiimide (ECDI-SP) on days -7 & +1). Results: The kidney allografts from CT group showed distorted architecture with an aggressive infi ltration of myeloid and T cells by histology and FACS analysis on day 28 post transplantation which correlated with a high level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Inversely, kidney allografts from both IS and ECDI-SP groups showed a much less aggressive intragraft cellular infi ltration and a better graftfunction (low BUN). However, despite preserved graft function in both groups, only the IS group showed detected levels of MCMV DNA in kidney allografts and in other organs (lung, liver and spleen) suggesting viral dissemination. We further observed that viral dissemination in the IS group correlated with a higher number of intragraft Ly6C Low F4/80 + myeloid cells at an early time point (day 2). This population has been previously shown to be associated MCMV dissemination.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Tolerance induction seems to eliminate MCMV reactivation while preserving kidney allograft function. While this may be mediated by inhibiting intragraft Ly6C Low F4/80 + cells, ongoing studies will further elucidate the preventative mechanisms of MCMV reactivation. Background: Successful induction of mixed chimerism (MC) and renal allograft tolerance has been achieved in both nonhuman primate (NHP) and man following conditioning that included 3.0 Gy total body irradiation (TBI). The signifi cant myelosuppression resulting from this treatment has led to the search for alternative strategies for wide clinical application. We have, therefore evaluated the novel approach of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) inhibition for specifi c enhancement of lymphocyte apoptosis. Methods: In Group 1 (G1), four NHP recipients received combined kidney and bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT) following reduced dose (1.5 Gy) TBI, thymic irradiation (TI, 7.0 Gy), ATG and the Bcl-2 inhibitor (ABT-199: 10 mg/ kg x 11 on days -4 to 6). After CKBMT, anti-CD154 mAb (20 mg/kg x 4) and cyclosporine for 28 days were administered. Two recipients received the same regimen without TBI (G2) and three without TI (G3). The results were compared with recipients treated with the standard 3.0 Gy TBI (G4: n=8) or with 1.5 Gy TBI (G5: n=2) but without ABT-199. Results: 4/4 G1 recipients developed markedly higher and more prolonged MC (Fig. 1A) with excellent lymphocyte depletion but without neutropenia (Fig. 1B) in contrast to G4 recipients (3.0 Gy TBI without . Recipients in G2 (no TBI) failed to develop MC, indicating that minimal TBI is necessary even with ABT-199 for induction of MC. G1 recipients achieved long-term allograft survival (313, >177, >100, and >65 days) without rejection, while all recipients in G2 (no TBI), G3 (no TI) or G5 (1.5 Gy without ABT-199) developed rejection. Conclusion: An FDA approved Bcl-2 inhibitor, ABT-199 with low-dose TBI and essential TI induced robust MC and long-term renal allograft acceptance without myelosuppression in NHP CKBMT. Enhancement of intrinsic apoptosis with Bcl-2 inhibition is a promising strategy to achieve robust MC and renal allograft tolerance without causing myelosuppressive complications. ",

            "text": "Robust Hematopoietic Mixed Chimerism and Donor-Specifi c Skin Allograft Tolerance after Non-Genotoxic Anti-CD117 Immunotoxin Conditioning and Donor Bone Marrow Allotransplantation. Z. Li, 1 A. Czechowicz, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 A. Scheck, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 D. Rossi, 3, 4, 5, 6 Establishing hematopoietic chimerism enables donor-specifi c allograft tolerance; however, chimerism protocols typically require either genotoxic conditioning or mega-doses of donor bone marrow cells (BMC), impeding clinical translation. Previously, we developed anti-CD117-saporin for non-genotoxic conditioning in syngeneic BM transplantation (BMT) acting through recipient HSC depletion (Czechowicz, Science 2007 and ASH Abstract, 2016). Here we test the safety and effi cacy of this immunotoxin in fully MHC-mismatched sequential BM and skin transplantation. C57Bl/6 mice received one dose of anti-CD117-saporin 6 days before BALB/c BMT plus 3 doses of anti-T cell antibody cocktail and 2 doses of rapamycin. Mice then received dual BALB/c and CBA/Ca skin grafts twice, ~150 and 240 days after BMT. Donor chimerism in peripheral blood ranged from 0.44 to 2.15% in mice receiving 5\u00d710 7 BMC without immunotoxin, and 0 to 0.24%in mice receiving 2\u00d710 7 BMC with a nonspecifi c immunotoxin. In contrast, durable donor chimerism up to 45.6% for up to 624 days after BMT was observed in mice receiving 2\u00d710 7 BMC after anti-CD117 immunotoxin. Multi-lineage chimerism was also observed in lymphoid organs, ranging from 13.8 to 28.0%; donor B cell chimerism was the most prominent. In addition, chimeric mice accepted BALB/c skin grafts without further immunosuppression but rejected third party CBA/ Ca skin allografts. Our results provide proof-of-principle for a safe and effective method for establishing persistent high-level mixed hematopoietic chimerism and donor-specifi c organ allograft tolerance that obviates both genotoxic conditioning and long-term immunosuppression by selectively depleting host HSCs in BM with an anti-CD117 immunotoxin. Since anti-CD117 antibodies are currently in development and in clinical trials, anti-CD117 immunotoxin may be rapidly translatable as a general method of allo-transplantation. Purpose: We engineered activity nanosensors that sense anti-allograft T cell activity in vivo to noninvasively detect the onset of acute cellular rejection from urine. Methods: Granzyme (GzmB) substrate peptides labelled with FITC was synthesized (TUCF) and conjugated to iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs). Donor BALB/c skin was grafted onto recipient B6 mice. On day 7, splenocytes and lymphocytes are harvested and stained for GzmB for fl ow cytometry analysis. Surface-labelled nanoparticles were administered to skin graft mice and imaged by IVIS Imaging System. Nanosensors were administered prior to, and 7 days after transplant, and urine samples were collected and analyzed by fl uorimetry. All animal works were approved by IACUC.",

CFZ was well tolerated with no infusion related nor thromboembolic events, and prospective Month 6 interim results demonstrated comparable effi cacy on the composite endpoint of treated biopsy proven acute rejection, graft loss, or death (21.2 vs. 22.2%) and better renal function (55.8 vs. 45.5 mL/min) [Fig 1] , less serious adverse events (SAE) (47.1 vs. 61.1%) and fewer infection complications (50.0 vs. 77.8%) with no increase of opportunistic infections (viral overall: 26.5 vs. 50.0%; SAE CMV: 2.9 vs. 11.1%; BKV: 15.2 vs. 22.2%), and a lower rate of new-onset diabetes mellitus (14.7 vs. 38.9%) with CFZ vs. TAC, respectively. Conclusion: CFZ533 may have potential to become an effective CNI-free alternative treatment improving transplant outcomes by preventing graft rejection without nephrotoxic (and other) CNI adverse effects. 12-month fi nal study data will become available in Q1/2018 and will be presented at the 2018 ATC.

Unlike the rest of the Western world, where use of NRP has been anecdotal, 25% of all cDCD donors that have been performed in Spain since 2012 have included post-mortem NRP. AIM Analyze the fi rst years of the Spanish experience with cDCD liver transplantation, in particular regarding the impact post-mortem NRP has had on organ utilization rates and transplant outcomes. METHODS Data was collected regarding potential cDCD liver donors and transplants that resulted between 2012 and 2016. All transplants had at least 6 mos of follow-up. Each donor hospital determined the process by which organs were recovered: NRP with pre-mortem cannulation, NRP with post-mortem cannulation, or super rapid recovery. RESULTS From 2012 to 2016, 370 potential cDCD liver donors were evaluated: 152 with NRP and 218 with SRR. Ultimately, rates of liver transplantation were 64% NRP and 57% SRR (P=0.102). Among livers that were transplanted, median donor age was 57 (46-65 IQR). While there were no differences in terms of relevant donor or recipient characteristics when analyzed according to recovery method, functional warm ischemia (fWIT) was shorter when NRP was applied -12 (10-16) NRP vs. 15 (11-20) SRR -given that in most cases femoral cannulae were placed prior to withdrawal of care. While rates of early allograft dysfunction (22% NRP vs. 29% SRR) and PNF (2% NRP vs. 4% SRR) did not vary, rates of overall biliary complications (9% NRP vs. 24% SRR, P=0.006) and ITBL (2% NRP vs. 12% SRR, P=0.01) were signifi cantly improved among recipients of livers recovered with NRP. One-year graft survival was 87% NRP vs. 78% SRR (P=0.110). On multivariate analysis analyzing risk factors for ITBL (including fWIT), the only signifi cant factor was the organ recovery method used. CONCLUSIONS This is the fi rst large series describing the application of NRP in cDCD liver transplantation. While results with SRR were acceptable, results using NRP were superior and comparable to those achieved using standardquality livers, even in spite of advanced donor age.

Superior Outcomes Using Normothermic Regional Perfusion in CDCD Liver Transplantation Am J Transplant. 2018;18 (suppl 4). Background: T cell exhaustion is a dysfunctional state that arises during chronic infection and cancer in response to persistence of high antigenic load. Whether chronic exposure to graft alloantigens leads to the formation of exhausted T cells (Tex) and, if so, whether Tex is related to graft outcome in human kidney transplant recipients is unknown. Methods: We used mass cytometry (CyTOF) to analyze exhaustion phenotypes of serially collected PBMC from 26 kidney transplant recipients enrolled in the prospective, observational, CTOT-01 cohort (samples were obtained at month 0, 3, and 6 after transplant). Using a panel of 36 markers and unbiased clustering algorithms (Phenograph) we extracted the frequencies of 5 CD4+ and 2 CD8+ T cell subsets expressing different combination of exhaustion markers ( Figure 1A) . Results: We observed signifi cant increases in the percentages of circulating CD4+ Tex and CD8+ Tex from month 0 to month 6 in patients given induction therapy with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) compared to those given basiliximab or no induction (Figure 1B-C) .",

In a simultaneous reaction, the individual TCRs are sequenced. Data are analyzed using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). A total of 5 cases are being examined. Results: We have already phenotyped and sequenced 204 T-cells (123 PBMCs and 81 circumfl ex coronary; LCx) from one case. Using t-SNE analysis the PBMC and LCx T-cells clustered discretely (Figure 1 ). Coronary T-cells mainly expressed T-bet and IFN\u0263 consistent with a Th1 phenotype. In contrast to the CD45RA + predominance in peripheral blood, most coronary T-cells were CD45RO + . FOXP3 + Tregs and ROR\u0263C + Th17 cells were virtually absent. Conclusions: Using a unique strategy combining functional phenotype with TCR sequencing and t-SNE analysis, we identifi ed a discrete Th1 memory T-cell population amongst graft infi ltrating T-cells in CAV. These results are being combined with next generation sequencing to characterize expanded T-cell clones in different locations (coronary and endomyocardium), and over time (from archived biopsies). We will expand this analysis to a larger cohort of specimens obtained during re-transplant for end-stage CAV. Introduction Memory T cell responses play a critical role in the outcome of allotransplantation. While the role of the T-box transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes) in the maintenance of antigen-specifi c Tmem is well studied, little is known about Eomes+CD8+T cell responses after transplantation. We evaluated allo-reactive Eomes+CD8+T cells in healthy volunteers and kidney transplant patients and their relation to transplant (tx) outcome. Methods Three groups of patients were analyzed: patients with no rejection within the fi rst year post-tx (n=11), patients with subclinical rejection (n=5), and patients with acute cellular rejection (n=5). All patients received Thymoglobulin induction and immunosuppression based on Tacrolimus, Mofetilmicophenolate and Prednisone.",

            "text": "Background: Human CD4 + T cell allo-immunity plays pivotal roles during cellular and humoral allograft rejection. Our previous analysis showed that allo-reactive precursors were present in both na\u00efve and memory CD4 + T cells. It is unclear their distribution within T follicular (T FH :CD45RO + CXCR5 + ) and T conventional (T CONV :CD45RO + CXCR5 -) subsets. To address this question, we measured their allo-specifi c polarization, proliferation, and TCR clonal repertoire. Methods: FACS-sorted T CONV or T FH cells from 6 healthy control (HC) were used to set up CFSE-MLR assays with autologous monocytes pulsed with allogeneic PBMC lysates. Proliferation and cytokine production (IFN-\u0263, IL-10, IL-17a, IL-21) were assessed by multi-parameter fl ow cytometry. In addition, DNA from selected in vitro co-cultures was isolated and the TCR-CDR3 regions were profi led by PCR amplifi cation followed by high throughput sequencing using the immunoSEQ platform (Adaptive Biotechnologies). Results: Indirect allo-stimulation induced low proliferation, low effector cytokines (IFN-\u0263/IL-17a/IL-21) and signifi cant high IL-10 responses within T FH and T CONV cells (considered na\u00efve response) in all subjects but one, who displayed low IL-10 secretion paralleled by high IFN-\u0263/IL-21 in T FH and high IFN-\u0263/IL-17a in T CONV cells, indicating a memory allogeneic response. ImmunoSEQ was performed on one na\u00efve and one who displayed functional memory. Although resting T FH cells from both subjects displayed a more diverse (polyclonal) TCR repertoire compared to T CONV , allo-stimulation triggered signifi cant TCR clonotype expansion in both T FH and T CONV only in the HC who showed allo-reactive memory responses. Moreover, resting T CONV cells contained most alloreactive TCR clonotypes that correlated positively with expanded alloreactive TCR clonotypes after allo-stimulation. Two out of 38 TCR expanded clones were shared between T FH and T CONV after in vitro allo-specifi c stimulation, suggesting potential intraclonal diversity. Conclusion: These comprehensive analyses of human circulating T FH and T CONV cells refl ect the heterogeneity of allo-reactivity among humans. In addition, monitoring of circulating allo-reactive T FH and T CONV cells may be important for identifying patients with pre-formed donor-reactive memory responses (effector cytokines and high TCR clonotype expansion) that may be deleterious posttransplant. The clinical signifi cance of minimal tubulointerstitial infl ammation (MTI:'t'+'i'scores 0.5-1.5) and Banff Borderline changes (BBC:'t'+'i'scores 2-3) in early renal allograft biopsies is unclear. The rate and signifi cance of progression of these lesions to late acute rejection (AR) also remains unknown. Our center performs 2 protocol Bxs (3&12mo) along with for-cause Bxs. This allows us to assess the clinical impact of early(0-4mo)MTI and BBC on graft outcomes. 208/372 patients had either no infl ammation(NI, 36%), MTI(34%) or BBC(30%) on early Bxs(0-4mo). Patients with NI(17%), MTI(24%) and BBC(34%) at 3mo exhibited increasing rates (in parentheses) of progression to AR (\u2265Banff 1A) by 12mo. Further, patients with MTI or BBC(3mo) had increased graft loss or impending graft loss (eGFR<30ml/min+ >30% fall from baseline) by 50mo when compared to those with NI (Fig 1A) .While graft outcome in the NI group was not affected by progression to late AR(p=0.85), patients with early MTI (Fig 1B) or BBC (Fig 1C) had signifi cantly worse outcomes if they developed late AR. Thus, early allograft infl ammation (MIT or BBC) was not only associated with increased progression to late AR, but those who progressed had worse outcomes. Thus, MTI and BBC, particularly in patients who will progress, are a cohort with poor outcomes. However, clinical factors, including 3mo histology, could not predict progression. Based on previous results, we asked whether peripheral blood B cell cytokines could predict progression to AR. 72 patients with either MTI(n=26) or BBC(n=46) had their B cells analyzed at 3mos. IL10:TNF\u03b1 expression ratio within T1 transitional B cells was signifi cantly lower in both the MTI(6.3X\u2193) and BBC(4.6X\u2193) patients who progressed vs. stable (p<0.0004). Finally,a low T1B cytokine ratio strongly predicted late progression to AR (ROC AUC 0.94 p<0.0001 Sen 92% Spec 88%) in patients with early allograft infl ammation(MIT or BBC). Thus, patients with early minimal allograft infl ammation that progress to AR at 1yr represent a high-risk cohort for graft dysfunction. This group could be identifi ed by 2-4 mo, using the T1B IL10:TNF\u03b1 ratio-allowing early intervention. Background: Deceased-donor (DD) kidneys are at higher risk for ischemia/ reperfusion injury leading to increased infl ammatory mediators and innate immune response. We aimed to investigate the effects of prolonged cold ischemia (CIT) on intragraft molecular gene expression profi les of DD kidneys comparing to living-donor (LD) pre-implantation biopsies and to investigate the molecular features of DD biopsies that develop delayed graft function (DGF).",

Though most of the genes were common when biopsies with CIT > 16 hrs compared to biopsies with CIT < 16 hrs there were unique genes that were differentially expressed (Figure) . The top canonical pathways involved in DDs were exacerbated with increased CIT. There were a few pathways that were activated in CIT>16 hrs group (iNOS signaling and actin cytoskeleton signaling). There were no differentially expressed probe sets when DD biopsies of patients that develop DGF compared to biopsies without DGF. Conclusions: Pre-implantation DD biopsies showed increased expression of transcripts associated with infl ammatory mediators, cytokines, macrophages, and innate immune response compared to LD kidneys. However, increased CIT had slight effect on intragraft gene expression profi les. Molecular analysis of preimplantation biopsies was similar whether they develop DGF or not. Respiratory viral infection (RVI) following human lung transplantation (LTx) increases the risk for chronic rejection. We demonstrated that lung transplant recipients (LTxR) with acute and chronic rejection induce exosomes containing HLA and self-antigens (SAg), K\u03b11Tubulin (K\u03b11T) and Collagen V (Col-V). We determined whether RVI can induce exosomes containing SAg leading to immune response resulting in rejection and their immunogenicity in mice. Sera from RVI (n=35) and stable LTxR (n=32) were used for exosomes isolation and Abs to SAg. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation, validated by sucrose cushion and tested for CD-9. SAg, viral antigens for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), corona virus (CV) and rhino virus (RV) were detected by immunoblot. Exosomes from RVI and stable LTxR were injected subcutaneously (10\u03bcg/100\u03bcl) into C57BL/6 mice. Sera were analyzed for Abs to SAg by ELISA. Since studies have shown that a primary insult to lung is needed for Abs to SAg to induce Obliterative Airway Disease (OAD) we administered 0.1% HCL into the native lungs on day 1. Lungs from immunized mice were analyzed for histopathology with H&E and trichrome. Background: Obliterative bronchiolitis is the major obstacle limiting long-term allograft survival of lung transplantation. Airway epithelium is the primary target in obliterative airway diseases.

Anti-IL-17 treatment or RORgt defi ciency completely restored normal epithelial morphology in trachea allografts. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that IL-17 is crucial to post-transplant airway infl ammation and epithelial damage, and further indicate that, in addition to blockade of IL-6/STAT3 Th17 development pathways, suppression of IL-17 from other sources is necessary for airway epithelial protection and allograft survival after transplantation. Purpose: Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an \"alarmin\", or a self-derived molecule that triggers pleotropic immune responses after release from damaged tissue. Yet, how IL-33 shapes alloresponses or outcome after solid organ transplantation is poorly understood. Using a pre-clinical mouse model, we demonstrate that IL-33 in heart transplants is critical to restrain infi ltrating myeloid cells from differentiating into pro-infl ammatory cells after transplantation and thus limit the subsequent development of chronic rejection. Methods: Wild type BALB/c, il33+/+ Bm12, il33-/-Bm12 hearts were heterotopically transplanted into WT or il33-/-B6 mice. In some groups, IL-33 was restored locally using extracellular matrix-based hydrogel at the time of transplantation. At days 3 to 7, or 100 to 120 post heart transplant (HTx) isolated grafts were stained with H+E or Trichrome. In addition to qRT-PCR and Western blot, IHC staining was used to defi ne differences in cytokine expression and leukocyte infi ltration. Leukocytes isolated from the HTx and recipient spleen were compared at various time points through fl ow cytometry. Results: Surgery, acute, and chronic rejection increased IL-33 in HTx fi broblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. HTx defi cient in IL-33 displayed dramatically increased chronic rejection-associated fi brosis (% fi brotic: 58\u00b16. vs. 42\u00b11; P=0.002) and vasculopathy (% occlusion: 98\u00b13 vs. 87\u00b13; P=0.02). HTx defi cient in IL-33 had increased CD3+ (281\u00b135 cell/mm 2 vs. 529\u00b125; P=0.0004) areas of vascular cuffi ng. Characterization of the myeloid compartment in the HTx at day 3 post surgery revealed that transplants lacking IL-33 had signifi cantly increased frequency of pro-infl ammatory macrophages (CD11b+ Ly6Chi F4-80+) and cDC (CD11b+ CD11c+ CD80 hi ). Local delivery of IL-33 reduced these pro-infl ammatory immune cells in the graft. Conclusions: Our fi ndings demonstrate that IL-33 is a regulatory alarmin after HTx and functions to control the generation of local infl ammatory myeloid cells. Local IL-33 was critical to limit chronic rejection. We thus establish an unappreciated, yet fundamental role for upregulated IL-33 in heart allograft protection. Background: We explored the role of CD40 signaling in kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells on renal interstitial fi brosis (IF) in two models: hypertension; and chronic renal allograft rejection. To this end, we used spontaneously hypertensive salt-sensitive Dahl (Dahl-S) and CD40 mutant (Dahl-S CD40mut ) rats (both displaying hypertension ~180 mm Hg at 6 weeks old). These Dahl-S and Dahl-S CD40mut rats were examined for IF at 64 days of age or at 90 days post renal transplantation to normotensive Brown Norway (BN) allogeneic recipients. We hypothesize that CD40 signaling regulates IF in both hypertension and chronic allograft rejection. Methods/Results: As previously reported, Dahl-S CD40mut rats showed signifi cantly less fi brosis and improved kidney function parameters over Dahl-S rats including urinary protein excretion; plasma creatinine; and creatinine clearance on both low (0.3%) and high (2%) salt diets. However, there was no difference in the systolic blood pressure between Dahl-S and Dahl-S CD40mut rats (181 \u00b1 3.8 vs. 183 \u00b1 4.8 mmHg, NS), suggesting that CD40 regulates IF in hypertension. Signaling experiments in the hypertensive model showed that proximal tubules from Dahl-S CD40mut rats had a signifi cant reduction in phospholyn kinase activity (p=0.05) and expression of PAI-1 (p=0.01) compared to tubules from Dahl-S rats (not shown). Likewise, normotensive BN recipients treated for 30 days with tacrolimus 1.5 mg/kg (to block acute rejection) displayed signifi cantly reduced IF in kidneys from Dahl-S CD40mut rats in comparison to Dahl-S rats (Fig. 1A) . Dahl-S CD40mut kidney transplants also had reduced collagen 1A1 (COL1A1) and COL3A1 (Fig. 1B) as well as MCP-1 and PI-1 (Fig. 1C ) compared to Dahl-S kidney grafts, suggesting inhibition of CD40/PI1/lyn signaling for fi brosis. Purpose Latent donor rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV) infection accelerates chronic rejection (CR) in a heterotopic rat heart transplant model. RCMV latency is associated with an infl ux of macrophages (macs) and T cells into cardiac tissue providing a potential site of alloantigen presentation. We sought to determine whether depletion of macs from RCMV+ donor allografts using clodronate-laden liposomes would slow the rate of CR. Methods F344 rats were infected with RCMV 6-9 months prior to organ procurement to establish latent infection. Donor rats were treated with PBS or clodronate laden liposomes. Mac depletion from donor hearts was confi rmed by fl ow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Donor hearts were heterotopically transplanted into CMV-na\u00efve Lewis recipients. We evaluated the time to rejection, cytokine levels, immune infi ltrates and the extent of transplant vascular sclerosis (TVS), which is refl ective of CR.",

Background Liver discards are poorly investigated. Among these discarded livers are potentially useable grafts that could save the lives of many of the 2500-3000 who are removed annually from waiting lists (WL) due to death or medical deterioration. We aimed to investigate the patterns of liver discards in US in the MELD era. Methods Analysis of a UNOS STAR fi le of all deceased donor organs from Jan 2002 to June 2015. Due to high discard rates, DCD donors were excluded. Results A total of 92,967 deceased donor livers were considered for transplantation, of these 75,582 (81.3%) were transplanted, and the remaining 17,385 (19.7%) were discarded at various points in the donation process. Over the same time period, 22,845 patients died on the list, and a further 13,722 were removed due becoming too sick. 7,678 (44.2%) were discarded pre-recovery (Pre-D). The most common reasons for Pre-D were pre-recovery biopsy (Bx) fi ndings (17.2%) or poor organ function (15.7%). 9,707 (55.8%) livers were discarded intraoperatively (Intra-D). Bx fi ndings accounted for 39% of these discards (n=3,751). Interestingly, of the livers discarded with available Bx, 70% had \u226430% macrosteatosis; steatosis being the only Bx data available from UNOS. Surprisingly, 30.5% of all liver discards were in donors \u226440 years of age, and 80% in donors \u226460. <10% of Pre-D and Intra-D livers were HCV/HBV positive. There was signifi cant regional variation in discard rates, with regions 2 & 6 having the highest rates (23.2% and 23%.1 respectively), and regions 8 & 3 the lowest (15.1% & 15.5%), p<0.001. Discard rates were not associated with overall donor volume explored. Figure-1 demonstrates that despite a rise in WL removals due to death/deterioration, liver discard rates have been steady at 6-8% annually.",

            "text": "Conclusion Substantial numbers of livers are discarded. Discards occur frequently in donors who are relatively young, and in livers that do not demonstrate signifi cant macrosteatosis. Regional variation in liver discards suggests that policy improvements can be made to minimize discard rates, and maximize the use of potentially useable to alleviate the rising WL mortality/ removal rate. As the US population ages, older liver donors (OLDs) represent a potential expansion of the donor pool. Historically, grafts from OLDs have been associated with poor outcomes and higher rates of discard, but recent studies reported equivalent outcomes to grafts from younger donors. We sought to identify trends in demographics, discard, and outcomes of OLDs. METHODS: We identifi ed 4127 OLDs (aged\u226570) and 3350 liver-only OLD graft recipients using SRTR data (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) Currently the United States kidney allocation system gives priority to candidates with a CPRA of 100% by giving them additional allocation points and providing national sharing of matched kidneys. CPRA is calculated based on allele frequencies in the donor population and includes HLA A, B, C, DR and DQB antigens. In reality CPRA is not an integer value and is calculated to multiple decimal points. CPRA of 100% includes any CPRA calculation greater than or equal to 99.5%. This study sought to understand the relationship between the actually CPRA by decile groups in candidates whose maximum CPRA qualifi es them for the 100% CPRA designation and the likelihood of receiving a deceased donor transplant. All kidney alone candidates on the waiting list as of December 4, 2014 onward, the date of implementation of the new allocation system, and whose maximum CPRA qualifi ed them for the 100% designation were selected and included in the analysis (9228 candidates). Following local decline of a recovered kidney, making regional and national offers in larger simultaneous batches might decrease discards. We simulated varying batch sizes for offers stratifi ed by KDPI, and described likelihood of discard and delay. METHODS: Using 2010 KPSAM-SRTR data, we simulated allocation of 3090 organs, comparing current practice to one of making (one-hour) expiring simultaneous offers to batches of transplant centers. Kidneys not matched after 10 rounds of offers were classifi ed as discarded for excessive delay. We excluded locally allocated and 0-MM kidneys. We assumed each hour's delay increases discard probability by 5%. RESULTS: Discard and delay decreased with increasing batch size (Table 1) . Among regionally accepted offers with KDPI>85%, batch size of 2/5/10 centers resulted in 23%/81%/100% placed within 3 hours of delay. Among nationally accepted offers, batch size of 5/10/20 centers resulted in 23%/28%/56% placed within 3 hours of delay ( Figure 1 ). For KDPI>85%, making national offers in batches of 10 centers rather than 5 decreased discard to 34% from 71%. The probability of accepting but not receiving an organ (because a higher-priority candidate received the kidney) with regional offer batch size of 10 was 38% for KDPI<0.25 and 7% for KDPI>0.85. CONCLUSION: Making expiring simultaneous kidneys offers at regional and national levels might decrease delays and discard without over-burdening providers. For high KDPI kidneys, increasing the batch size might decrease delay of placement. The revised Kidney Allocation System (KAS) has been operational for 3 years. The bolus effects seen early following the introduction have abated and a steady state has been achieved. Previous reports have shown an increase in regional and national sharing and no change in 1 year death censored overall graft survival. KAS implemented 4 allocation sequences based on KDPI, a calculated risk index used as a predictor of long term outcome. KAS prioritized the top 20% most optimal donor organs (Sequence (S) A) to candidates with the greatest estimated post-transplant (tx) survival (EPTS) ) and S-A plus S-B (KDPI 21-35%) organs to pediatric candidates. Since KAS, data review shows a decrease in the rate of pediatric transplants and a failure to maximally allocate the S-A kidneys to the best EPTS candidates. Current UNOS policy requires the kidney be allocated to a M-O candidate before passing into the kidney alone KAS prioritization. Of the 14084 total kidneys available for tx in KAS Year 2, 11.7% were never allocated according to the KAS algorithm. Based on the previously reported M-O distribution in 2015, 87.2% of SPK, 53.4% of SLK and 70.6% of K+O candidates received the most optimal (and pediatric prioritized) S-A + S-B donor organs and never allocated to pediatric recipients. Also bypassed for these optimal kidneys were the KAS stratifi ed highly sensitized, prior living donor and greatest EPTS candidates. Additionally, with the exception of the SLK recipients, there are no outcomes reporting required for the other 855 kidneys.",

We hypothesize this may refl ect attitudes of less aggressive local centers. Since many of these kidneys have better function than their terminal Cr indicates recovery represents an easy way to expand our supply. (Table) . After adjusting for clinical characteristics and center-level variation, ESW was associated with a lower risk of graft failure among those without DGF (aHR= 0.88 0.94 0.99 ) but not among those with DGF (aHR= 0.97 1.05 1.13 ; p-for-interaction=0.008; Figure) . ESW was also associated with a lower risk of death among those without DGF (aHR= 0.86 0.90 0.94 ) but not among those with DGF (aHR= 0.90 0.96 1.03 ; p-for-interaction=0.08; Figure) . CONCLUSION: While ESW appears to be safe and effective for recipients without DGF, it might not confer the same benefi ts on those with DGF. Background: Immunologic risk monitoring of recipients of kidney transplant(Tx) using donor specifi c antibodies (DSA) has become a standard practice in most Tx centers in the USA. There is however paucity of data on the incidence and clinical complications associated with recurrence (R'DSA) of preformed or Denovo DSA (DnDSA) in kidney Tx patient receiving early steroid withdrawal Immunosuppression(IS) regimen. Methods: A prospective monitoring of DSA after kidney Tx was done on patient who consented to study protocol between 2009 and 2011 at Indiana University Tx Program. Patient were evaluated for DSA at 3 rd , 6 th , 9th and 12 th month respectively and then yearly for a total of 3 years. Patient with history of positive fl ow cytometry crossmatch were excluded. Patients received anti-thymocyte globulins with pulse steroid induction (Early fi ve days withdraw) except zero mismatches living donor recipients who received basiliximab. Patients were placed on steroid free two drugs IS regimen. DSA were checked using single antigen beads (One Lambda Inc Introduction: Kidney transplantation in African American (AA) recipients continues to demonstrate inferior outcomes when compared with other race/ ethnicities. Contributing factors encompass differences in pharmacogenomics, and variances in PK/PD of immunosuppressant therapy. The concept of genotyping patients in solid organ transplantation is gaining interest as little is known about the impact of CYP3A5 polymorphisms on transplantation outcomes among AA kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Methods: A single center retrospective cohort study of all 162 adult KTRs over a 24 month period who received oral tacrolimus (TAC) as part of maintenance immunosuppression were analyzed for prevalence of CYP3A genomic variances with a subanalysis of clinical outcomes in the AA cohort. Results: 85 patients expressed a CYP3A5*1 variant and 77 patients expressed non-*1 variants. The CYP3A5*1 group was predominantly AA (93%, p\u22640.0005). Among the 106 strictly AA subgroup, in CYP3A5*1 expressers compared to nonexpressers, the incidence of BPAR was signifi cantly higher in the fi rst 6 months (13% vs 0%; P = .016) compared to 24 months (13% vs 7%; P = .521). TAC total daily dose at fi rst therapeutic level was signifi cantly higher in CYP3A5*1 expressers (12 mg/day) compared to nonexpressers (8 mg/day; P < .001). Compared to CYP3A5*1 nonexpressers, DGF incidence was signifi cantly higher among CYP3A5*1 expressers (27.6% vs 6.7%; P = .006). By contrast, median GFR was signifi cantly higher in CYP3A5*1 expressers compared to nonexpressers (54.5 mL/min vs 50.0 mL/min; P = .003) at 24 months. Conclusion: We confi rm that AA are the predominant expressers of the *1 variant and suggest that AAs with CYP3A5*1 expression require 50% more TAC and have an increased incidence of DGF and acute rejection. High tacrolimus trough coeffi cient of variation (TAC CV) has been associated with an increased risk of de novo donor-specifi c antibody (dnDSA) and acute rejection (AR). We have previously shown lower tacrolimus time in therapeutic range (TAC TTR) also predicts dnDSA and AR. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of dnDSA and AR in patients with a high TAC CV stratifi ed by TAC TTR. From 2007 to 2013, kidney transplant recipients who were initiated and maintained on tacrolimus in the fi rst year of transplant were screened for dnDSA at months 1, 6, 12 and when clinically indicated. Tacrolimus troughs from 1 week to 12 months were used and troughs after dnDSA or acute rejection were excluded. TAC CV was calculated as (SD/mean)x100%. The Rosendaal method was applied to calculate TAC TTR using a therapeutic range of 5 -10 ng/ml. AR included clinical cellular and/or antibody-mediated rejection. INTRODUCTION. We examined the utility of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing of urine supernatants in kidney transplant recipients for diagnosing rare and common urinary tract infections (UTI), estimating bacterial growth rates, and antibiotic resistant genes. METHODS. We collected 28 urine specimens from 18 kidney transplant recipients with bacterial UTI, 6 urine specimens from 2 kidney transplant recipients with parvovirus infection, and 2 urine specimens from 1 kidney transplant recipient with adenovirus infection. Single-stranded library preparation and shotgun sequencing on the 36 urine supernatants was performed using Illumina Next Seq, 75 bp by 75 bp. Microbial identifi cation was performed using the Grammy pipeline. RESULTS. In 27 of the 28 bacterial UTIs, urinary cfDNA identifi ed the pathogen confi rmed by bacterial culture. Urinary cfDNA was able to detect H. infl uenza in a urine culture that was negative by conventional urine culture but was positive for H. infl uenza after the clinician requested advanced culturing techniques. In the cases of parovovirus and adenovirus infections, urinary cfDNA detected the pathogens in all cases at least 1 week prior to the clinical diagnosis made by the clinicians. Antibiotic resistomes were constructed based on urinary cfDNA in the bacterial UTI associated samples and correlated with antimicrobial susceptibility testing.",

Background: Frailty is predictive of postoperative morbidity, including infections in older surgical patients. It is not known if frailty is associated with postoperative infections in patients undergoing renal transplantation. This study attempts to answer this question. Methods: We performed a retrospective, observational cohort study of older patients (age \u226565) who underwent primary renal transplant (RT) in a single transplant center from January 1, 2013 to April 1, 2017. The modifi ed frailty index (mFI) was calculated based on 11 risk factors. The mFI scores were categorized as follows: 0-1 (fi t), 2 (mildly frail) and \u2265 3 (moderately-severely frail). Outcomes measured were: 30-day mortality, 30-day post-transplant infection (PTI), 30-day readmission, and 200-day PTI. The association of frailty with RT outcomes was determined using multivariate logistic regression adjusting for confounders. Results: Eighty-three RT recipients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 60 (72%) were men and mean age was 70 years (\u00b1 3.93). The mean time on dialysis was 4.5 years (\u00b1 2.9). The distribution of mFI scores was as follows: 0-1 (37%), 2 (25%), and \u2265 3 (37% In order to utilize a willing but incompatible living donor, candidates must either proceed with incompatible transplantation or fi nd a more compatible match using kidney paired donation (KPD). A criticism of KPD is that the \"easy-tomatch\" candidates leave the registry quickly, and thus concentrate the pool with sensitized candidates, making future matches challenging. -79, 17.7% 80-97, and 22 .9% had PRA 98% or higher. There were no changes in the prevalent pool of candidates awaiting KPD (Figure 1 ), except an initial increase in candidates with PRA\u226580% (28.0% in 2011 to 41.1% in 2012, Figure 2 ). Importantly there were also no changes in the rate of deceased donor kidney transplant over this time period. Conclusion: In this large, national KPD clearinghouse, there is no evidence that candidates have become more \"hard-to-match.\" Providers should continue to counsel candidates who are not sensitized and their potential donors to consider KPD. Figure 1 . Acute cellular rejection and BK virus nephropathy both cause deteriorating graft function that can lead to graft loss. Distinguishing the two conditions rapidly and accurately is vital for immunosuppression management. Currently, repeated biopsies are required for differential diagnosis and disease monitoring. Using the Nanostring platform to measure gene expression in urine sediment RNA as a noninvasive means to assess the status of renal allografts, we investigated the hypothesis that gene expression patterns in urine sediment will distinguish acute rejection from BK virus nephropathy without the need for a biopsy.",

We previously described a microarray diagnostic system (MMDx) for rejection in 1208 kidney transplant biopsies (J. Reeve et al. JCI Insight 2 (12), 2017). The system assigns molecular phenotype using binary classifi ers, and estimates rejection classes using archetypal clustering. The present study validated the system in a set of 537 new biopsies and studied the relationship to histology (available in 227 of the 537). Histology diagnoses in validation set 537 were similar to set 1208. Biopsies distributed in PCA by rejection molecular phenotype: PC1=rejection; PC2 =ABMR vs. TCMR; PC3=ABMR stage (early-stage; fully-developed; late-stage) ( Fig.1 : PC2 vs 1, left panels; PC2 vs 3, right panels). Set 1208 is at the top (ABCD), and set 537 at the bottom (fi gure 1EFGH). Biopsies are colored by histology class (AB and EF) and molecular class (CD and GH).

More patients in the TCZ group than the control group had a decline in the ti-score (7/11 vs. 2/11, p=0.08). Mean circulating CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Treg frequency (n=20) was similar at baseline (4.3% vs 5.1%, p=0.58); it increased in the TCZ group (+50%) & declined in the control group (-22.5%) over 6 months (p=0.012). PMA/ionomycin stimulated production of IL-17 by CD4+ T cells decreased in the TCZ group and increased in the control group at 6 months. There were no cases of death or graft loss. Conclusions: TCZ treatment for 6 months was well tolerated in kidney transplant recipients. It was associated with a signifi cant increase in circulating Tregs, a signifi cant decrease in CD4 + T cell cytokine production & a trend towards decreased graft infl ammation.

In era II, there were fewer biliary complications and none of the patients developed IC, compared to 18% in era I (p<0.05) ( Table 1) . One year DCD LT graft survival for recipients in era II was signifi cantly higher than that of recipients in era I (93% vs. 79%, p=0.01) which was comparable to deceased donor (DBD) LT recipients (89%, p=0.22). The use of ECD DCD livers was comparable in the two eras (30% in era I vs. 23% in era II, p=0.35), and graft loss was signifi cantly higher (53% vs. 0%, p=0.004) in era I for ECD DCD livers. Number of DCD LT performed at our center gradually increased after institution of the optimization protocol to account for 12% of center's LT volume. Conclusions: Shorter ischemic times along with thrombolytic donor fl ush prevented IC, and improved survival outcomes after DCD LT. The improvement in clinical outcomes was associated regrowth of DCD LT program. In Y1, overall costs varied from $82K for kidney recipients to $366K for intestine recipients. For recipients of all organs, functioning grafts were less costly than death or graft failure. For kidney recipients, DCGF was 4.3 times more costly than functioning grafts, likely due to the high cost of dialysis. Death was 4.7 times more costly than functioning grafts. For liver recipients, Medicare paid 2.5 times more for DCG and re-transplants, and 4.8 times more for death than for functioning grafts. For heart and lung recipients, the cost of dying in the fi rst year was 4.5 and 3.9 times more than for functioning grafts. In Y2, overall costs varied from $26K for kidney recipients to $105K for intestine recipients. The cost difference between functioning and failed grafts was more extreme for most organs.

(Figure 1b ) Morbidity after LT was variable: median LOS (7-27 days), 4 +readmissions (0-6%), CKD rates ( Transplant program performance assessment has traditionally focused on posttransplant outcomes. However, the survival benefi t conferred by transplant offers a compelling reason to broaden program assessment to include pretransplant outcomes such as risk-adjusted transplant rate and waitlist mortality. Pretransplant metrics in isolation do not capture the entire range of possible patient experiences because a high transplant rate may lead to worse posttransplant outcomes due to use of high-risk donors. Survival from listing may balance these issues by incorporating aspects of pretransplant and posttransplant care. Using SRTR data, we estimated program-specifi c survival from listing hazard ratios for candidates listed at kidney, liver, lung, and heart programs between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2016. The hazard ratios were estimated with a log-normal frailty term and were adjusted for candidate characteristics at the time of listing. A time-varying covariate for transplant was not included because higher transplant rates should improve survival from listing due to better access to transplant. Variability in program-specifi c hazard ratios for survival from listing was relatively low compared to transplant rate ratios, waitlist mortality rate ratios, and hazard ratios for 1-year graft survival (Table 1 ). In kidney and liver transplantation, survival from listing was strongly associated with each metric. In contrast, for heart and lung programs, survival from listing had a relatively attenuated association with the transplant rate ratio. In conclusion, survival from listing captures the effect of both pretransplant and posttransplant care and deserves further investigation as an intent-to-treat analysis of patient experience at a program. (Figure) . In timevarying Cox model adjusting for donor and recipient factors, enteric conversion did not affect the risk of graft loss (HR 1.54, P = 0.09). The most common complications after conversion were bowel obstruction and enteric leaks, most of which occurred in the fi rst year after conversion.",

Introduction: Ten-year outcomes from a cohort of fi ve pre-uremic islet transplant (txp) recipients treated with anti-leukocyte functional antigen-1 (LFA-1) antibody Efalizumab (EFA) revealed two patients that remain insulin independent with either minimal or complete withdrawal of immunosuppression (IS), prompting investigation of underlying immunologic mechanisms. Methods: Patients remained on EFA following islet infusion until drug discontinuation on May 1, 2009 (avg treatment 570 days), with transition to CNI-sparing IS. Blood samples were monitored pre-and post-txp for CD4+, CD8+, and regulatory T (Treg) cells. Recipient alloreactivity was evaluated by mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) in vitro against donor-specifi c and third-party stimulated B cells (sBc) for proliferation and cytokine production. Results/Discussion: Insulin independence at 10 years post-txp was 40% (2/5 patients; Fig 1) . Two patients, EFA-2 and EFA-4, remain insulin-independent on minimal to no IS, while a third patient, EFA-1, maintained insulin independence for 3287 days. All fi ve pts showed signifi cant enrichment of peripheral Tregs; notably EFA-4, who remains insulin independent off all IS for 5.4 years, had the highest peak levels of Treg-predominance, reaching 67% of all CD4+ T cells in circulation. Further investigation by proliferation and interferon gamma production after MLR revealed that EFA-2 and EFA-4 had an extended period of non-reactivity to donor and third-party antigen on EFA. Although EFA-4 regained in vitro reactivity to both donor and third party antigen after discontinuation of EFA, the patient remains operationally tolerant and insulin independent off all IS.",

Selective enrichment of Tregs and sustained early donor non-reactivity while on EFA correlate with these outcomes. In contrast to other solid organ transplants, the characteristics of long term surviving pancreas transplants have not been well described. Our objective was to measure graft half-lives through three transplant immunosuppression eras and characterize the demographic factors in transplants with > 10-year graft survival. A retrospective review of 2,022 pancreas transplants performed in 3 standard immunosuppression eras, pre-CsA (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) , CsA/Aza (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) , and Tac/MMF (1997-2016) at a single institution was studied. Anti-T cell induction was used in Csa/Aza and Tac/MMF eras, but not in the fi rst era. A subset of transplants with alemtuzumab induction was not included. Transplants were further divided by those with failure in less 10 years and those surviving more than 10 years. Standard bivariate and multivariable models were applied and survival and graft half-lives for each category were determined from Kaplan Meier estimates. RESULTS. Graft survival at all time intervals increased markedly from the pre-CsA era to the CsA era and then incrementally in the modern Tac era. As expected, SPK transplants had the longest graft survival with a half life of more than 22 years for death censored and 1 yr contingent grafts. PAK and PTA had shorter half life. In the latter eras, there are many transplants that survived more than 10 years. Long term survivors tended to have the following characteristics: SPK transplants, older recipients, male recipients, primary transplants, bladder drained, leaner recipient, locally recovered allografts, and lower pDRI. Pancreas graft survival continues to improve with graft half-lives more than 20 years in optimal circumstances. Such half-life determinations may help in weighing the risk/benefi ts in comparison to alternative therapies, especially as islet transplantation and closed-loop insulin pumps. Allogeneic memory T cell response precludes the induction of transplant acceptance; how this process is regulated at the molecular level remains unclear. Both mTOR and STAT3 are important \"drivers\" for T cell differentiation and function, but they have been shown to play opposing roles in memory T cell development. STAT3 promotes the functional maturation of memory T cells, whereas mTOR activity negatively regulates the magnitude and qualities of memory T cell differentiation. Herein, to determine the role of mTOR and STAT3 in regulating allogenic memory T cell response, we generated Mtor fl /fl CD4-Cre, Stat3 fl /fl CD4-Cre, and Mtor fl /fl Stat3 fl /fl CD4-Cre mice, in which mTOR, STAT3, or both mTOR and STAT3 was conditionally knocked out (cKO) in T cells. We then transplanted Balb/c ear skins onto wild type (WT) B6 and those cKO mice (n = 5 or 6 per group Introduction: Sphingosine 1-phospate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1PR1) drives T cell migration from thymus into blood, and lymph nodes (LN) into efferent lymphatics. Whether S1PR1 and S1PR4 expressed by T cells, regulate migration from tissues into draining LN (dLN) is unknown. We hypothesized that T cells use different S1PRs to traffi c from tissues into draining LN through afferent lymphatics. Methods: CD4 T cells were adoptively transferred into mice, and migration to afferent lymphatics and dLN measured. Mouse and human primary lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC), blood endothelial cell (BEC), and LEC line were used to assess migration, chemokine signals, adhesion molecules and S1PR function in vitro. Specifi c pharmacologic and genetic S1PR blockade was employed in vitro and in vivo. Results:LEC, but not BEC, selectively promoted human and murine CD4 T cell migration toward S1P, but not other chemokines. An S1P gradient was formed around the afferent lymphatics; anti-S1P treatment inhibited CD4 T cell migration in vitro and in vivo; and CD4 T cells failed to home to LN of Sphk1 -/and Sphk2 -/recipients, which lacked lymphatic S1P expression. CD4 T cell migration toward S1P not CCL19 was blocked by treatment of T cells with S1PR1 or S1PR4 antagonists. Similarly, S1PR1 -/or S1PR4 -/-CD4 T cells failed to migrate toward S1P not CCL19 in vitro, and into afferent lymphatics and LN in vivo. Pharmacologic and genetic receptor blockade inhibited migration both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, overexpression of S1PR1 in S1PR1-Tg or S5A transgenic T cells promoted CD4 T cell migration toward S1P in vitro and enhanced homing into dLN through afferent lymphatics in vivo. Compared to CCL19 driven migration, S1P driven transendothelial migration was more dependent on transcellular rather than paracellular traffi cking. S1PR1 and S1PR4 regulated CD4 T cell migration to, but did not change CD4 T cell localization within, LNs. Conclusions: S1P engages T cells and LEC to promote migration. CD4 T cells use S1PR1 and S1PR4 to regulate migration into afferent lymphatics and LNs. These results demonstrate unique roles for S1P and S1PRs in regulating T cell migration from tissues into LN, and that distinct receptors and mechanisms are used compared to thymic or efferent lymphatic migration. These fi ndings suggest new and specifi c drug targets for regulating lymphatic migration in immunity and tolerance.

            "text": "reperfusion injury (IRI) have been well documented, underlying mechanisms remain ambiguous. Moreover, whether Gsk3\u03b2 also regulates infl ammation resolution and restoration of tissue homeostasis after IRI remains unknown. Methods: Myeloid-specifi c Gsk3\u03b2 KO strain was used to study its function in macrophages at both early and late stages of tissue infl ammation in a murine liver partial warm ischemia model. Results: Compared with controls, myeloid Gsk3\u00df KO mice were not only protected from liver IRI, but also recovered more quickly. Peak hepatocellular injury after 90min ischemia was signifi cantly lower (at 6h post reperfusion); and liver homeostasis was restored much earlier after reperfusion (7d in WT vs. 3d in KO at both histological and cellular levels). In bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), Gsk3\u03b2 defi ciency resulted in an early reduction of TNF-a, but sustained increase of IL-10 gene expression upon TLR4 stimulation. Additionally, expression of efferocytosis receptor MerTK and TIM-4, two key molecules for macrophage functions in infl ammation resolution, were selectively upregulated in activated KO, but not WT, cells. Intracellular signaling pathway analysis revealed that TLR4 stimulation inhibited AMPK activity early in WT BMMs. Gsk3\u03b2 defi ciency reversed this inhibition, leading to early and higher levels of AMPK activation in stimulated KO cells. This resulted in the induction of the novel innate immune negative regulator small heterodimer partner (SHP). The Gsk3\u03b2 regulation of AMPK/SHP was confi rmed in WT BMMs using Gsk3 chemical inhibitor, and found to be independent of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Introduction: Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors 1 (S1PR1) and S1PR2 are highly expressed by lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC), while T cells express S1PR1 and S1PR4. S1P is produced by LEC and regulates T cell migration. The mechanisms of how S1P regulate CD4 T cell migration across LEC are not fully understood. We hypothesized that S1PRs are utilized by LEC to regulate CD4 T traffi cking from tissues through afferent lymphatics and into draining lymph nodes (LN). Methods: CD4 T cells were adoptively transferred into mice to measure T cell migration into afferent lymphatics and draining LN (dLN). Specifi c pharmacologic and genetic S1PR blockade was employed in vitro and in vivo. Mouse and human primary LEC, blood endothelial cell (BEC), and LEC line were used to assess migration, chemokine signals, adhesion molecules and S1PR function in vitro. Results:S1P selectively promoted human and murine CD4 T cell migration across LEC, but not BEC. Selective inhibition of S1PR1 or S1PR2 indicated that migration was mediated by S1PR2, but not S1PR1, in LEC. S1PR2 antagonists inhibited T cell transendothelial migration in vitro and decreased T cell migration into lymphatic vessels and dLN in vivo. CD4 T cells also migrated less into the lymphatic vessels and dLN of S1PR2 -/recipients. Treatment with neutralizing antibodies against adhesion molecules demonstrated that S1P driven migration was dependent on VLA4-VCAM-1 interactions. S1PR2 antagonists decreased VCAM-1 expression by LEC, which resulted in decreased interaction of T cells with VCAM-1 + domains of the LEC surface membrane. The S1PR2 antagonist inhibited S1P-induced phosphorylation of ERK to control VCAM-1 expression. The S1PR2 antagonist also increased cell-cell junction integrity of LEC by enhancing VE-cadherin expression, thus further impairing T cell movement across endothelial layers. Conclusions: While both S1PR1 and S1PR2 are expressed by LEC, only S1PR2 is used to regulate T cell migration across afferent lymphatics into draining LN. S1PR2 downstream ERK signaling regulates VCAM-1 expression, which is required for CD4 T cell transendothelial migration. S1PR2 also regulates VEcadherin expression as well as LEC junctional integrity. These fi ndings implicate S1PR2 as a novel and specifi c drug target for regulating the lymphatic migration of CD4 T cells in immunity and tolerance. Background: Our prior studies demonstrated that tolerance and immunity are associated with differential expression of lymph node (LN) stromal laminins \u03b14\u03b21\u03b31 (411) and \u03b15b1g1 (511), respectively, which determine how alloreactive T cells enter high endothelial venules and traffi c within LN. Here we tested whether laminins directly regulate CD4+ T cell receptor stimulation and migration, thereby determining immune responses and allograft survival. Methods: CD4+ T cells isolated from C57BL/6 mice were activated with anti-CD3 +/-anti-CD28, cultured with laminins for 3 days, and evaluated for activation and proliferation. Migration of CD4 T cells on laminin coated surfaces was measured with real-time live imaging. C57BL/6 mice and laminin \u03b15 fl oxed x Pdgfrb-Cre mice lacking laminin \u03b15 expression in LN, received cardiac transplants from BALB/c donors. Recipients were treated with mAbs against the laminin 511 receptor \u03b16 integrin.",

            "text": "The proliferation and activation of anti-CD3 stimulated T cells were enhanced by laminin 511, but were inhibited by laminin 411. These effects were observed for a large range of dose and kinetic variables, demonstrating robust laminin effects. Laminin signals and T cell receptor and costimulatory signals must be presented together on the same surface for regulatory interactions to occur. Laminin 421 and laminin 521 displayed analogous effects, showing specifi city for the \u03b1-chains. Laminin 411 enhanced while laminin 511 inhibited T cell migration. Blocking the laminin 511 receptor \u03b16 integrin with specifi c mAb abrogated the stimulatory effect of laminin 511, as well as its infl uence on migration, indicating \u03b16 integrin is the main receptor for laminin \u03b15. Adding anti-\u03b16 integrin to anti-CD40L mAb prolonged allograft survival (mean survival time 53 to 167 days (P=0.0018)). Laminin \u03b15 defi cient mice treated with anti-CD40L mAb also had a marked increase in allograft survival compared to wild type controls (109 vs 87 days). Conclusions: Serving as co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory ligands, respectively, the laminin \u03b14 and \u03b15 chains regulate T cell receptor stimulation and migration. T cells recognize laminin \u03b15 through \u03b16 integrin, which acts as co-stimulatory receptors. mAbs targeting this receptor inhibited T cell responses and prolonged allograft survival. Laminins are not only structural scaffold molecules, but act as molecular switches for tolerance and immunity by directly regulating CD4+ T cell responses. Kidney transplant rejection leads to short and long-term adverse clinical outcomes. Serum creatinine is a suboptimal late biomarker for rejection. Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles released by cells to mediate cell-tocell communication by delivering genetic materials including mRNAs and microRNAs. In the transplanted kidney, exosomes originate from different cells including the immune cells during rejection. These cells release exosomes into the urine carrying parent cells' surface proteins and nucleic acids. The nucleic acid profi le may carry disease signatures becoming potential biomarkers of disease activity and therapeutic targets. We show that urinary exosomes, and their contents including RNA, are very stable and can be stored in the urine for 2 weeks at 4\u00b0C, reinforcing exosomes as a potential source to identify disease signatures. We isolated urinary exosomes, extracted mRNA, and performed differential gene expression analysis in 28 urine samples collected from 23 patients who underwent a kidney transplant biopsy for evaluation of acute rejection. In renal transplantation, non-invasive biomarkers are needed to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes and guide pre-emptive therapy. Here, we assessed B cell cytokines as a predictive biomarker. 165 patients with serial Bxs (3&12mo protocol+for-cause) and blood draws served as the training set. IS was Thymo\u2192MPA+TAC. Based on prior data, we tested the ratio of IL10:TNF\u03b1 expression (Cpg+CD40L, by FACs) in peripheral blood T1 transitional B cells (T1B) 3mo post-transplant, as a biomarker. A low T1B IL10:TNF\u03b1 ratio at 3mo predicted acute rejection (AR) within the 1 st yr (Fig1A) . Notably, in patients with a normal Bx at 3mo, a low T1B cytokine ratio strongly predicted late AR (6-12mo;AUC 0.9, p<0.0001). These data were validated in an independent internal cohort (n=74). Further, a low T1B cytokine ratio was associated with IFTA (12 mo) and graft loss/impending graft loss (eGFR<30ml/min & >30% fall from baseline) at 4yrs (Fig1B) . The predictive value of this biomarker was not infl uenced by opportunistic infection or by nonadherence. Next, T1B cytokine ratio was validated in an external UK cohort (n=100). IS was Simulect\u2192TAC+MMF). All AR in this group was clinical (no protocol Bxs). Again, the T1B cytokine ratio at 3mo strongly predicted AR within the 1 st yr (Fig1C), and was associated with poor graft outcomes (Fig1D) ",

            "text": "We included 639 RTRs (age 53\u00b113 years; 58% males at 5. Fig 1B) . At a cutoff value of 1.26, the T1B cytokine ratio predicted DSA+TCMR with a PPV of 81% and a NPV of 94%. Reanalysis of the data after removing the 5/43 patients whose DSA was detected after TCMR showed that the T1 B cytokine ratio strongly predicted concomitant or ensuing TCMR in patients with DSA (ROC AUC 0.94, p<0.0001). Thus, patients with DSA+TCMR represents a high-risk population for adverse graft outcomes, and this outcome can be predicted in DSA+ patients using the T1B cytokine ratio as a biomarker. Liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) represents a major risk factor for early graft dysfunction and a key obstacle to expanding the donor pool in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Although graft autophagy is essential for resistance against hepatic IRI, its signifi cance in clinical OLT remains unknown. Despite recent data identifying heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) as a putative autophagy inducer, its role in OLT settings and putative interactions with Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a key autophagy regulator, have not been studied. We aimed to examine HO-1 mediated autophagy induction in human OLT and in a murine OLT model with extended cold storage, as well as to analyze the requirement for SIRT1 in autophagy regulation by HO-1. Fifty-one hepatic human biopsies from OLT patients were collected under an IRB protocol at 2h post-reperfusion, followed by Western blot analyses. Clinical trials of adoptively transferred regulatory T cells (T Regs ) have been hindered by the short lifespan of these transferred T Regs . Systemic injection of low-dose interleukin (IL)-2 preferentially stimulates the high-affi nity trimeric IL-2 receptor, abundantly expressed on T Regs , leading to greater cellular expansion. However, cytotoxic CD8 T cells and NK cells are also signifi cantly expanded by this strategy. Here, we describe novel engineered T Regs conjugated with IL-2 nanogel (NG) particles before adoptive transfer. The NG's gradual secretion of IL-2 in vivo selectively promotes T Reg viability, and is engineered by reversibly crosslinking carrier-free protein using a bis-N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS) crosslinker. Incorporation of monoclonal antibodies against the highlyexpressed cell surface phosphatase CD45 acts as an anchor to retain the NG on T Regs . Upon T Reg activation, increased reduction activities lead to the progressive degradation of the crosslinker and sustained IL-2 release. We show that the coupling effi ciency of NG to magnetically-isolated murine T Regs is above 80% (n=5 experiments; ****P<0.0001), and that NG-conjugated T Regs maintain their FoxP3 expression after coupling compared to the control (CT) T Regs (99% vs. 92%, CT vs. NG; n=5 experiments; P=n.s.). To test T Reg homeostasis in vivo, Immunodefi cient RAG1 -/mice received BALB/c skin transplants and were injected with 1:1 T Regs :CD8 T cells from mismatched C57BL/6 donors to induce alloimmunity. Seven days post adoptive transfer, a two-fold increase in T Regs was observed in the spleens of mice that received NG T Regs compared to CT T Regs (n=11/group; **P<0.01). Furthermore, contrary to when IL-2 is systemically injected, we saw a more than three-fold increase in T Regs :CD8 and T Regs :NK ratios in the NG-treated mice (n=11/group; *P<0.05). In a GvHD model, the adoptive transfer of NG T Regs reduced disease progression compared to CT T Regs . In summary, we show that the IL-2 NG T-cell conjugation strategy can effi ciently and specifi cally improve the in vivo expansion of transferred T Regs while sparing CD8 and NK T cells, thus improving the therapeutic effi cacy of T Regs and IL-2. reduced M1 macrophage iNOS yet strongly augmented arginase-1, an M2 macrophage phenotype, with increased expression of IL-10/TGF-\u03b2. Transfection of p-Cox2 KO in MSCs decreased PGE2 secretion, \u03b2-catenin, XIAP expression, and IL-10/TGF-\u03b2 production. Induction of \u03b2-catenin enhanced XIAP and Akt phosphorylation whereas knockout of \u03b2-catenin resulted in reduced XIAP and increased TNF\u03b1/IL-6. Moreover, XIAP knockout augmented JNK yet diminished Akt phosphorylation and arginase-1 expression. Unlike in controls, adoptive transfer of MSCs in mice ameliorated IR-induced liver damage, as evidenced by reduced sALT levels and liver Suzuki's scores, which was accompanied by increased Cox2, PGE2, \u03b2-catenin, XIAP, p-Akt, and arginase-1 expression, with reduced proinfl ammatory mediators in ischemic livers. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that MSC-mediated immune regulation through activation of PGE2/\u03b2-catenin/XBP1 signaling, which in turn reprograms host macrophage differentiation towards an anti-infl ammatory M2 phenotype in IR-triggered liver infl ammation. This might imply a novel therapeutic potential for the management of liver IRI in transplant recipients. [Background] Reconstructive transplantation represents a valid therapeutic option after devastating tissue loss. Routine clinical application, however, is hampered by the toxicity of long-term maintenance immunosuppression. The current study investigated a novel approach using ex vivo expanded regulatory T cells combined with a short-term immunomodulatory strategy in a murine hind limb transplantation model.",

Moreover, regulatory T cells added in the early post transplant period further optimize immune regulation by inducing sustained mixed chimerism. Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) defi cient pigs have been proposed as surrogate hosts for large scale in vivo expansion of normal FAH+ hepatocytes. However, immunologic rejection prevents expansion of non-autologous donor cells. To overcome this barrier, we have developed a novel method of morula complementation to produce chimeric FAH (-/-) pigs with FAH (+/+) liver grafts. FAH (-/-) recipient morulae were derived via somatic cell nuclear transfer with fi broblasts harvested from FAH knock-out pigs. The blastomeres of the recipient morulae were complemented with blastomeres from normal FAH (+/+) donor embryos also transfected with enhanced green fl uorescent protein (EGFP) label. The chimeric embryos were transferred to a surrogate sow who received no NTBC during pregnancy. A single gestation was confi rmed and the chimeric pig was born without deformity. His birth weight was 0.75 kg. Liver function tests were normal. Tyrosine and succinylacetone levels were also normal. He received no NTBC. Peripheral blood leukocytes were comprised of 33.8% donor-derived (GFP+) cells as measured via fl ow cytometry. Liver biopsies at 1 and 2 months after birth showed diffuse staining of donor (FAH+, GFP+) cells in liver parenchyma (Fig. 1) . The pig was euthanized electively and in good health without NTBC administration for data collection at day 60 after birth. These are proof of concept studies that FAH defi ciency can be successfully corrected by stem cell transplantation in early gestation through the production of chimeric embryos. Therefore, production and robust expansion of non-autologous normal hepatocytes can be achieved in FAH defi cient pigs. Our novel method avoids the need for protective drugs (i.e., NTBC), immunosuppressive drugs, or immunodefi cient modifi cations of host pigs. Background Chronic rejection is the main cause of renal transplant loss after the fi rst year and has mostly been attributed to alloimmune responses against human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Epidemiological data, however, suggests a contribution of non-HLA related alloimmune responses. Candidate antigen approaches relying on predefi ned minor histocompatibility antigens did not provide convincing evidence for the importance of non-HLA related alloimmune responses. The contribution of non-HLA donor recipient mismatches in protein coding genes on a genome wide basis has not yet been assessed. Methods",

The cohort included 296 non-sensitized patients, who underwent a fi rst kidney transplant between 2008 and 2014 in our center. For patients developing dnDSA (44 individuals),we analyzed immunodominant DSA sialylation on the fi rst DSA detection sera and one year after using affi nity chromatography with lectin. Primary endpoint was allograft failure according to immunodominant DSA sialylation status. Secondary endpoints were ABMR incidence and Banff classifi cation scores. Results. Eleven patients (25%) had sialylated iDSA and 33 patients had nonsialylated iDSA (75%). Patients with non-sialylated iDSA had signifi cantly higher scores for microvascular infl ammation (p = 0.02) than patients with sialylated iDSA. There was a trend for higher IF/TA score in non-sialylated group (p = 0.13). Five-year allograft survival was signifi cantly lower in patients with non-sialylated iDSA (80.0%) compared to patients with sialylated iDSA, with non-DSA anti-HLA antibodies and without any anti-HLA immunization (90.0%, 92.2% and 95.2%, respectively; p = 0.007). In multivariate analysis, nonsialylated iDSA was independently associated with allograft failure compared with no anti-HLA antibodies (HR 4.0; IC95% [1.24; 12.90] ; p = 0.02). Conclusion. DSA sialylation status seems to be associated with allograft failure in non-sensitized kidney transplant recipients. DSA sialylation analyze may be helpful for ABMR risk assessment. ",

Rather, combining high resolution typing with vXM successfully predicts donor/recipient compatibility.

With the aging donor population, accurate assessment of tissue quality of deceased donor kidneys is required to determine the intermediate and long term graft performance, and is the major unmet need.We have previously shown that the expression of acute kidney injury transcripts (IRRAT) in implant biopsies is predictive of immediate function/delayed graft function in the fi rst week posttransplant. In the present study we asked whether post-transplant intermediate (3 months) and late (12 month) graft function i.e. high serum creatinine could be predicted by p16/INK4a (CDKN2A) transcript, the classic somatic cell senescence marker whose expression represents the biological age/quality of an organ, compared to IRRAT expression. We analyzed 64 implantation (1-hour) biopsies from brain dead donors. p16/ INK4a expression was measured by qPCR (p16/INK4a is not assessable by microarrays) and compared to IRRAT expression measured by microarrays. Clinical risk evaluation of kidney function included KDRI, Irish and Schold scores. The intermediate/late graft function (3 and 12 months) was defi ned as poor with serum creatinine>132 um/L. We compared molecular, demographic, and clinical scores in implant biopsies for their association with serum creatinine at 3 and 12 months post-transplant. Only expression of p16/INK4a was signifi cantly associated (by p-value) with the elevated serum creatinine at 3 and 12 months (AUC of 0.71 and 0.70 for 3 and 12 months, Figure 1A ).",

LCPT (Envarsus XR\u00ae) is a once-daily, extended-release formulation of tacrolimus which has demonstrated greater bioavailability and a smoother PK profi le compared to TacBID. This post-hoc analysis of previous conversion studies summarizes the PK profi le of LCPT and TacBID when targeted at low, medium, and high trough levels in kidney transplant recipients. Methods: Data from 3 PK studies on conversion from TacBID to LCPT (Gaber 2013, Tremblay 2016, Trofe-Clark 2017) were pooled and patients were grouped according to trough (Cmin) concentrations of \u22645ng/mL, >5 and \u22648ng/mL, or >8 ng/mL. Daily dose conversion rates from TacBID to LCPT ranged from 1:0.7 to 1:0.85. PK parameters between drugs were compared at each trough range. Results: Fifty-three, 115, and 68 patients had trough levels in the low, medium, and high ranges, respectively. Patients treated with LCPT consistently showed lower peaks, less fl uctuation, and comparable trough levels in each concentration range (Table 1) . Correlation between Cmin and AUC was signifi cant for LCPT in all ranges, but was highest (0.83, p<0 .001) in the high trough patients. Conclusion: Pooled analysis of 3 PK studies show that conversion from TacBID to LCPT results in consistently reduced peak concentrations, less fl uctuation and similar trough levels at reduced daily doses, regardless of trough level range. Data here demonstrate that LCPT maintains its smoother PK profi le with once-daily dosing at a variety of clinically applicable trough targets in kidney transplant recipients.",

We longitudinally investigated kinetics of repopulating B cell subsets and donor-specifi c allo-reactive antibody (DSA) in patients undergoing a novel calcineurin inhibitor-free ABR regimen within 36-month post-transplantation. 40 patients received a kidney allograft from either living (n=30) and deceased (n=10) donors. All patients were DSA free at transplant. Absolute peripheral blood B cell counts were analyzed by TruCount analysis, and the CD27-IgD and Bm1-Bm5 (IgD/CD38) classifi cations were utilized to defi ne the B cell differentiation. Serum samples were screened for DSA by a microparticle-based FACS analysis, and the specifi cities of DSA to HLA class I and II was determined by a Luminex-based assay. Profound B cell depletion post-alemtuzumab induction was followed by rapid repopulation. The reconstituting B cells were predominantly na\u00efve B cells (CD27 -IgG + , Bm1/Bm2 subsets) after 6 months post-transplantation. In contrast, the frequency of memory B cell subsets including switched (CD27 + IgD -), un-switched (CD27 + IgD + ), and exhausted (CD27 -IgD -) memory cells, and early (Bm5-early)/later (Bm5-late) memory B cells was signifi cantly lower than baseline levels between 6 and 36 months post-depletional induction (p=0.0001). Additionally, regulatory B cells defi ned as CD38 hi CD24 hi IgM hi CD20 hi subset was signifi cantly higher than baseline 6 months post-transplantation (p=0.0001). DSA was not detectable in 35 patients with 36 months post-transplantation. No patients developed ABMR, though 5 patients developed DSA: 2 class II (DQ), 2 class I, and one associated with multiple failed pregnancies (class I and class II). The repopulating B cells in patients undergoing novel ABR immunosuppression demonstrate increased na\u00efve and regulatory B populations, and the reconstitution of memory B cells is signifi cantly inhibited without detectable allo-reactive antibody in most patients after transplantation. These fi ndings suggest that lymphocyte depletion and belatacept-based maintenance regimen achieves anti-rejection effects by promoting na\u00efve and regulatory B cells while suppressing memory B cells after transplantation. This regimen warrants formal, prospective, comparative study. ",

Alemtuzumab induction produced profound lymphopenia, evoking substantial homeostatic T cell proliferation characterized by increased intracellular Ki67 expression (p<0.05). Depleted patients were enriched signifi cantly with na\u00efve (CCR7 + CD45RA + , CD57 -PD1 -, CD28 + ) CD4 + and CD8 + T cells compared to baseline (p<0.05). Alemtuzumab induction signifi cantly reduced T cell subsets associated with belatacept resistance including CD8 + CD2 hi CD28 -, CD4 + CD28 + CCR7 -CD45RA -, and CD4 + CD57 + PD1cells when compared with baseline (p<0.05). The CD8 + CD2 hi CD28 + and CD4 + CD2 hi CD28 + subsets were also signifi cantly decreased (p<0.05), and a reduced effector memory compartment (CCR7 -CD45RA -) in CD8 + CD2 hi CD28 + subset was observed post-depletion when compared with baseline (p<0.05). Control patients had no signifi cant changes in their repertoire over the follow-up period. In summary, ABR regimen effectively prevents the repopulation of belatacept-resistant T cell subsets, and the de novo priming of reconstituted T cells results in proliferation of predominantly CD28 + na\u00efve cells that are susceptible to belatacept.

This regimen warrants formal, prospective, comparative study. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) requires programs to submit complete, accurate and timely clinical information for 80% and laboratory data for 70% of living kidney donors (LKDs) at 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up. A program is noncompliant with policy for a time-point if any required clinical/laboratory element is missing or not collected \u00b160 days of the time-point. We retrospectively analyzed data collected in the NIH-funded Kidney Donor Outcomes Cohort (KDOC) study to ascertain whether policy requirements were met. Complete and timely clinical information was collected for 61% (6 months), 52% (12 months), and 48% (24 months) of LKDs; complete and timely laboratory data were collected for 44% (6 months), 45% (12 months), and 35% (24 months) of LKDs. Higher rates of data collection were observed when removing the \u00b160 day timing requirement. None of the six KDOC programs met policy requirements at any of the follow-up periods for clinical information, while two programs met requirements at both the 6-and 12-month follow-up periods for laboratory data. Despite substantial resources and efforts, we were unable to meet policy requirements and this experience is generally consistent with what others have reported and what has been reported by the OPTN. Purpose: There is limited research that describes living donor (LD) program processes and protocols. This study aimed to describe LD program protocols, processes, and resources within U.S. transplant centers. Method: A survey was sent to the living donor coordinator (LDC) at every U.S. LD program (n=211; response rate=70%, total respondents=148). Descriptive statistics summarized survey responses. Results: 22% of centers required LD to have personal health insurance and 28% required LD to have a PCP (Table 1) . Median time to respond to initial LD inquiry was 1 day (IQR 1-2) ( Table 1 ). Median number of days LD required at the center for evaluation was 2 days (IQR 1.5-3) with 24% completing in center evaluation in 1 day and 40% of programs required > 3 days at the center. Median number of days to complete entire LD evaluation was 45 days (IQR 30-83) with 42% completing LD evaluation in < 30 days and 27% requiring > 60 days. 63% of centers had KPD software or registry. 83% of centers paid for the cost of post donation labs, 75% centers paid for post donation offi ce visits, and 64% of centers covered the cost of post donation complications if insurance did not cover (Table 2) . 94% offered the potential donor a medical opt out. 81% of centers accepted donors with controlled HTN. All centers reported a BMI restriction. 18% had BMI restriction < 30 and 61% had BMI restriction > 35. 43% reported upper age limits with 46% reporting upper age limit > 70 years. Conclusions: Signifi cant variability exists among centers in regards to program protocols and processes. This study is an important fi rst step to identifi cation of best practices among programs and program characteristics that are associated with higher numbers of living donor transplants. Introduction: While post-donation follow-up in the United States has improved since implementation of minimum center compliance standards, it is still suboptimal and brief (only 2 years total required). Despite being at greater risk for developing post-donation kidney failure, living kidney donors with obesity at the time of donation are more likely to have incomplete post-donation follow-up. We sought to examine whether center-level variation exists in follow-up at 6 months post-donation among a cohort of obese living donors. Methods: Using data from the Scientifi c Registry for Transplant Recipients and the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network from January 2005-July 2015, we included all adult kidney donors with obesity (body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 ) at time of donation (n=13,831). We used a multilevel logistic regression model with a random intercept for recovery center and empirical Bayes estimates, to explore the presence of center variation in recording of 6-month post-donation serum creatinine. Results: After adjusting for various donor and center-level characteristics, 24% of the variation in recording of 6-month serum creatinine was accounted for by center (intraclass correlation coeffi cient: 0.237, p < 0.001). When examining the predicted probability of 6-month creatinine by center, the adjusted probability ranged from 10% to 91.5%, with an average of 49.5% and 91 of 192 centers had less than 50% predicted probability of complete 6-month creatinine. Conversion to open was required in 5 cases (for major bleeding and malfunctioning staplers). All the conversions occurred early in the experience (the last one 11 years ago). Perioperative complications occurred in 10.2% of the cases and the majority were minor (Grade I-II) with the exception of 1 death, non-related to technical issues. There were no statistical differences in the 4 groups on surgical outcomes and postoperative complications. Purpose: Impact of transplant center program size, staffi ng, and organization on LKD outcomes is unknown. This study describes the labor inputs, organization, and resources available within U.S. living donor (LD) programs and their associations with LD outcomes. Method: A survey was sent to the living donor coordinator (LDC) at every U.S. LD program (n=211; RR=70%, total respondents=148). Respondent surveys were linked to AHA and SRTR databases to describe hospital characteristics and volumes. Descriptive statistics summarized responses; multiple linear regressions assessed associations of center characteristics with outcome variables. Results: 74% of programs reported dedicated LDCs (Table 1) . Median LDC FTEs per center was 1.0 (IQR 1-2); 37% of programs reported that the LDC devoted < 40 hours per week to the LD program. >1 LDC FTE was associated with higher numbers of LD inquires, evaluations, and transplants, as was having a dedicated LDC (p<0.004) ( Table 2 ). Dedicated LD clerical staff was associated with higher numbers of evaluations and transplants (p<0.003). Centers that accept donors with controlled HTN and centers that have a KPD program reported higher LD inquires, evaluations, and transplants (p<0.021). The overall national conversion rate from initial contact to LD transplant was 8% and from evaluation to LD transplant was 32%. Conclusion: Findings suggest an association of labor, organizational and resource inputs with LD outcomes suggesting that centers invest in nursing and non-nursing staffi ng, evaluate donor management structure, review acceptance criteria/protocols, and devote specifi c resources to the LD program. This is the fi rst known study in the transplant literature that describes an association between nurse labor and LD outcomes. Results: In all sub-periods, female donors made up the majority (55-62%), except for sibling donors (45%) and child to-parent donors (40%). No signifi cant gender differences were seen in perceived information given before donation. For males, it was more common that the recipient took the initiative to donate. For females, the motivation for donating was more frequently to help the recipient and because others wanted them to donate. For males, it was more common to feel a moral obligation. Post-operatively, females more frequently felt sad and experienced nausea, and more frequently felt that the donation had a positive impact on their lifes. With the introduction of minimally invasive surgical techniques, donors experienced fewer problems from the operation, with no gender difference.",

            "text": "Females donate more frequently than males, a difference that did not change over time. Only a few gender differences were seen in donor motives and the donation experience; however, these differences may be relevant to address the gender imbalance in kidney donations. Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) is the optimal treatment for adults with renal failure. However, living kidney donation has declined in the past decade, particularly among men, younger adults, blacks, and low-income adults. There is evidence that donation-related costs may deter both transplant candidates and potential donors from considering LDKT. Lost wages is a major source of fi nancial loss for some living donors and, unlike travel and lodging expenses, is not reimbursed by fi nancial assistance programs. In this presentation, we will describe the rationale and design -and provide an update -of an NIH-funded, single-center study in which 350 kidney transplant candidates are randomly assigned to one of two parallel arms: (1) possible reimbursement of donor lost wages up to $1,500 or (2) possible reimbursement of donor lost wages up to $3,000, with LDKT occurrence within 12 months of initial transplant evaluation as the primary outcome. The study is testing the impact of offering reimbursement for donor lost wages on the LDKT rate in kidney transplant candidates, examining whether offering reimbursement for donor lost wages reduces racial disparity in LDKT rates, and determining whether higher reimbursement amounts lead to higher LDKT rates. Our central hypotheses are that offering reimbursement for donor lost wages will yield higher LDKT rates overall relative to historical controls, and reduce the disparity between LDKT rates in white and minority patients. In addition, enrolled patients and prospective donors are completing questionnaires to assess fi nancial concerns about transplantation and donation, their relative importance on decision-making, donation ambivalence, and feelings of pressure to donate. We will highlight similarities and differences between our study and the donor lost wages recently funded by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation. Our study is the fi rst such one to be initiated (enrollment underway) and it addresses the transplant community's call to reduce the fi nancial burden of living donation and examine its impact on LDKT rates. Findings have the potential to infl uence policy, clinical practice, LDKT access, and income and racial disparities in LDKT. Infl ammation is associated with poor physical performance, frailty, disability and death in community-dwelling older adults. Given the elevated infl ammation levels among ESRD patients, it is likely that infl ammatory markers are associated with adverse outcomes such as frailty or physical limitation among kidney transplantation (KT) candidates, although the strength of these associations is unclear.",

Elevated infl ammation markers were defi ned as >1SD higher level of IL-6, sTNFR1, CRP or an infl ammation index in log scale. Results: Dialysis groups had higher infl ammation; HD patients were most likely to be SPPB impaired and frail (Table 1) . Overall, the odds of being frail or SPPB impaired at the time of KT evaluation were higher with increasing IL-6, CRP, and infl ammation index, while the odds of being SPPB impaired were also higher with increasing sTNFR1 (Table 2) . Among HD patients, the odds of being frail at the time of KT evaluation were higher with increasing IL-6 and CRP and the odds of being SPPB impaired were higher with increasing IL-6, CRP, and infl ammation index (Table 2) . Conclusion: Among KT candidates, those undergoing HD have higher odds of being frail and SPPB impaired with elevated levels of infl ammatory markers. HD patients with elevated infl ammatory markers, especially IL-6, CRP, and infl ammation index, may need special care such as closer follow up or prehabilitation to improve lower extremity function and reduce frailty burden while they are on the waitlist.",

Background: Rituximab is commonly prescribed in ABO-or HLA-incompatible kidney transplantation. When used before transplant it interferes with B lymphocyte complement-dependent crossmatch (CDC CM) or FACS crossmatch (FACS CM) results thus rendering their interpretation impossible. This effect has been described up to 9 months following rituximab infusion. We describe here a new method to abolish rituximab interference in both CDC CM and FACS CM.",

Normally this antibody is employed to dose rituximab by ELISA technique. We tested different antibody concentrations in different settings (rituximab infusions 0 days to 270 days before CM; patients with and without class 1 and 2 HLA antibodies) and evaluated whether the interference of rituximab was abolished in FACS CM and CDC CM. Results: A concentration of 0.17\u03bcg/\u03bcl of the 10C5 clone abolished completely false positive results in both CDC and FACS CM. 1\u03bcl of 10C5 was thus added to 5\u03bcl of serum for 15 minutes at room temperature, the CM was then performed. While these concentrations dilute the serum they did not nullify expected positive results. CDC and FACS CM stayed positive when donor specifi c HLA antibodies had a Luminex mean fl uorescence intensity respectively >8000 and >4000. Conclusion: We describe an easy, effi cient and relatively inexpensive method to eliminate rituximab interference on CDC and FACS CM results. Objective: OPTN has recently approved MELD prioritization for HCC patients beyond Milan Criteria (MC) who are downstaged (DS) with locoregional therapy (LRT) prior to liver transplant (LT). We sought to evaluate post-LT outcomes, identify predictors of downstaging, and evaluate the impact of LRT in HCC patients presenting beyond MC. Methods: Clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes were compared among beyond MC patients (n=789) who were downstaged (DS, n=465), treated and not downstaged (LRT-NoDS, n=242), or untreated and not downstaged (NoLRT-NoDS, n=82) from 20 US centers (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) . Logistic regression identifi ed predictors of downstaging. Among non-downstaged patients, multivariate Cox regression and propensity matching with inverse probability of treatment weighted analysis determined the effect of LRT on HCC recurrence. Results: Compared to NoDS, recurrence-free survival was superior and post-LT recurrence lower in DS, with further stratifi cation of risk by tumor > 5cm. Multivariate predictors of downstaging included pre-LT AFP response, and pathologic tumor number and size. Surprisingly, LRT-NoDS had higher recurrence rates compared to NoLRT-NoDS, even after controlling for clinicopathologic variables (HR 2.43 [1.47-4 .00], p=0.001) and propensity matching (HR 2.60 [1.58-4.28 ],p<0.001).",

            "text": "HCC recurrence after OLT. There was no signifi cant difference in the tacrolimus concentrations between the patients without HCC recurrence and with HCC recurrence. The HCC recurrence proportion of D(+)R(+) was 0%, D(+)R(-) was 3.4%, D(-)R(+) was 29.7%, and D(-)R(-) was 8.1%. Log-rank test in KM analysis demonstrated a remarkable difference in tumor recurrence rate among different HLA-DR4 matching status (p=0.008). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the HLA-DR4 matching status was associated with different HCC recurrence risk and that the graft immune system could play a role in the response to the tumor cells after liver transplantation. Further clinical and basic studies are required to confi rm the fi ndings in this study and explore possible mechanisms. Background and aims: De novo malignancies are one of the major late complications and cause of death after liver transplantation (LT). Using extensive data from the \"French National Agence de la Biom\u00e9decine Cristal database\", the present study aimed to quantify the risk of solid organ de novo malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) after LT. Methods: The incidence of de novo malignancies among all LT patients between 1993 and 2012 was compared to that of the French population, standardized on age, gender, and calendar period (standardized incidence ratio, SIR). Patients with history of malignancy before LT were not included. Results: Among the 11226 liver transplant patients included in the study, 1200 de novo malignancies were diagnosed (11.6%) after a median delay of 5.0 years after LT. In October 2015, OPTN implemented a new policy for liver allocation, under which hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receive exception points only after a 6-month delay. This delay may lead to undetected HCC disease progression and recurrence after transplantation that may result in poor posttransplant outcomes. We sought to investigate the association between this policy change with all-cause graft failure (death or re-transplant) in HCC liver transplant recipients.",

To address this, we compiled billable events as a proxy for receivables, from diagnosis of HCC through resection or transplant, to death or last reported encounter of patients with HCC between 01/2011 and 12/2012. On average, patients with HCC who underwent resection had a MELD of 12, survival of 652 days, and billable encounters of $316,873 or $2,904/day. In contrast, patients that received a liver transplant had a MELD of 19, survival of 1579 days, and billable encounters of $704,291 or $2,622 per day. Surgery represents the largest category of treatment of patients with HCC ($88,020 or 28% & $175,457 or 26% resection & transplant respectively). Moreover, the cost effectiveness of treatment was directly proportional to length of survival. The longer overall survival in patients transplanted with HCC ultimate diminishes the fi nancial burden long term compared to resection. This endpoint measure occurs after 2 years survival.

In a health care climate aiming to contain costs and evaluate value based treatment paradigms, fi nancial burden should be included in the decision analysis. A balance needs to be drawn between survival and fi nancial burdens. Objective:Split/reduced graft liver transplantation(SRLT), while widely accepted in pediatrics, remains underutilized in adults. SRLT is considered a negative factor for graft quality(HR;1.52) in liver donor risk index reported by Feng et al. in 2006. This study aimed to investigate whether improved donor-recipient matching and accumulated technical advancements had improved SRLT outcomes Methods:This study used 82,554 adult patients in the scientifi c registry of transplant recipients(SRTR) from 1998-2015, evaluating characteristics and outcomes of 1,221(1.5%) SRLT patients according to time periods(Era1; 1998 -2003 2004 -2009 2010 -2015 . Cox proportional hazards models for overall graft survival and the Kaplan-Meier method were used to assess prognostic outcomes. P<0.05 was defi ned as statistical signifi cance Results:The case number of SRLT remained 60 cases/year over the study period and each time period(Era1;408, Era2;402, and Era3;411 cases). 102 centers performed at least one case. More than half the cases were performed by 12 high volume centers; each performed at least 30 cases (53.4%, 652/1221). Over the study period, the median donor age was less in Era2(20, IQR16-28) and Era3(21, IQR16-29) than Era1(22, IQR17-33)(P<0.001). On the other hand, recipient age was greater in Era2(54.5, IQR48-61) and Era3(58, IQR51-63) than Era1(51, IQR45-57)(P<0.001). The cold ischemic time in Era3 was shorter than the other two groups(7.3 hours vs 8 hours and 8 hours; P<0.001). The length of stay has signifi cantly improved over time(from 13days to 10day, P<0.001). 1 and 5-year graft survival also improved over time; 68.6 and 58.3%, 84.8 and 71.9%, and 87.3 and 79.8% in Era1, Era2 and Era3, respectively(P<0.001). The adjusted HR of SRLT was signifi cantly more hazardous than whole grafts in Era1(HR;1.39, P<0.001); however, no signifi cant difference remained in Era2 and Era3(HR;1.04 and 0.94, respectively) Results: In total, 67 living donors responded to the SF-36 and DQLS, with a mean follow up of 6.5\u00b10.3 years. The mean age at donation was 44.5\u00b11.3 years, and 53.7% of respondents were male. SF-36 mental and physical component summary scale scores were higher compared to the normal US population data (p<0.05). DQLS data was grouped into four areas: physical activity, employment status, insurance status, and emotional status. 76.1% of respondents were able to resume the same level of physical activity as prior to surgery, while 73.1% remain physically active with strength that is equal to or greater than pre-operatively. 91% of respondents returned to school or work after donation, and 80.6% reported that LD had no impact on their performance. 95.5% of respondents reported that their health insurance had not been impacted by LD. Only 10.4% of respondents indicated that they had applied for life insurance post-LD; however, 28.6% of these patients reported that LD had impacted their ability to obtain coverage. Overall, 85.1% of respondents felt positive about their surgery, and 97.0% indicated that they did not regret LD. Data from the 2017 surveys is currently being analyzed and will represent a mean follow up of 13 years postdonation. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that most patients report above average HRQOL post-LD when compared to the general population. To our knowledge, this study will represent the longest follow up of HRQOL in LD and represents unique data related to physical, fi nancial, and psychosocial factors in HRQOL after LD. ",

The effect of IFNb on alloimmunity and transplant rejection are unknown. Methods: We used mathematical modeling to predict signaling effects of IFNb in T cells, and validated the model through experimental testing of type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) expression and phosphorylated STAT activation in IFNb treated murine and human na\u00efve CD4+T cells by fl ow cytometry. We perfomed Treg induction assays +/-IFNb and measured frequencies and function of induced CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg. We also treated B6 recipients of BALB/c allografts with IFNb, evaluating graft survival and effects on Treg. Results: As predicted by the computational model, murine and human na\u00efve CD4+ T cells express IFNAR and IFNb activates STAT1,4 and 5 (Fig. 1A) .",

IFNb treatment prolonged survival of BALB/c hearts transplanted into CTLA-4 Ig-treated B6 recipients (Fig. 1C) . Discussion: Our translational fi ndings identify a previously unrecognized direct effect of IFNb on human and mouse Treg induction that has the potential to be used to improve allograft survival in humans. The instability of the regulatory T (Treg) cell lineage precludes their therapeutic potential in transplantation and autoimmune diseases. Herein, we invented a novel approach to stabilize the Foxp3 expression and suppressor function of TGF-\u03b2/IL-2 induced Treg (iTreg) cells using 3 compounds (3C), including a pan HDAC inhibitor NaB, a Histone methyltransferase G9a inhibitor UC46, and vitamin C. We found that during iTreg cell polarization NaB and UC46 synergistically enhanced the chromatin accessibility and the recruitment of DNA demethylase TETs at the Foxp3 CNS2 locus, while vitamin C enhanced TET enzyme activity to enforce active DNA demethylation. The 3C treatment further prevented the subsequent re-methylation at the Foxp3 CNS2 locus by inhibiting the IRF4 and p-STAT6 mediated DNMT recruitment. Hence, 3C conditioned iTreg (3C-iTreg) cells persistently expressed high levels of Foxp3 and exerted potent suppressive function, associated with the complete demethylation of the Foxp3 CNS2 locus. Upon in vivo adoptive transfer, virtually all 3C-iTreg cells maintained high Foxp3 expression within the 6-month study period. Next, we determined the therapeutic function of 3C-iTreg cells using three distinct models. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, iTreg and 3C-iTreg cells were derived from the MOG-specifi c 2D2 TCR transgenic CD4 + T cells. Adoptive transfer of 2.5 million 3C-iTreg but not iTreg cells almost completely prevented the EAE development in mice immunized with the MOG 35-55 peptide. In a colitis model, iTreg and 3C-iTreg cells were derived from polyclonal CD4 + T cells. Adoptive transfer of 0.5 million 3C-iTreg but not iTreg cells completely abrogated 1 million transferred CD4 + CD45RB high cell-mediated weight loss and colon infl ammation in Rag1 -/mice. In a Balb/c-to-Rag1 -/-.B6 skin transplantation model, polyclonal alloreactive iTreg and 3C-iTreg cells were derived from B6 CD4 + T cells upon stimulation with Balb/c splenocytes. Adoptive transfer of 0.1 million 3C-iTreg but not iTreg cells completely prevented 0.2 million transferred CD4 + Foxp -B6 T cell-mediated skin graft rejection.

The study aimed to examine the LT outcomes in NASH recipients particularly in recipients with a biological MELD score of 35 or higher after the implementation of Share 35 policy. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed in 4,380 adult patients from the UNOS database who received deceased donor LT between 2009 and 2017 due to primary diagnosis of NASH or cryptogenic cirrhosis with body mass index \u2265 30. Cox regressions were used to model the effect of the share 35 policy on post-LT graft and patient survivals comparing the fi rst 3 years of Share 35 to an equivalent time period before. Stratifi cation on MELD score of 35 or higher was performed. Results: The number of NASH patients received LT increased from 232 (14.1%) in 2009 to 266 (20.5%) in 2017. Compared to pre-Share 35 era, average MELD score was higher (26.5 vs 24.7) with a higher proportion of recipients having MELD \u2265 35 (22.9% vs 15.5%), mean waitlist time decreased from 219.3 days to 137.5 days, and average cold ischemic time decreased from 6.4 hours to 6 hours. However, no signifi cant differences was found in the average length of hospitalization after LT. Three-year graft and patient survivals were comparable either in the entire cohort or within recipients having MELD \u2265 35. 30% of kidney transplant recipients are readmitted in the fi rst month posttransplant. ABO-incompatible (ABO-I) recipients constitute a unique subpopulation that might be at higher readmission risk. Drawing on a national cohort of ABO-I recipients across ten years, 230 patients with Medicare primary insurance were matched to ABO-compatible (ABO-C) transplant matched controls and to waitlist-only matched controls on age, sex, race, prior transplant, PRA, diabetes, years of renal replacement time, percent of renal replacement time with a functioning graft, and transplant date/waitlisting date. Readmission risk was determined using multilevel, mixed-effects Poisson regression. In the fi rst month, ABO-Is had the same readmission risk as ABO-Cs;",

The purpose of this effort is to provide transplant administrative and clinical directors with reliable predictions of Scientifi c Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) risk-adjusted 1-year expected number of events -to be published in forthcoming Program Specifi c Reports (PSRs). Using data provided by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), statistical software is programmed to emulate, for a specifi c cohort of transplant patients, the applicable SRTR Risk Adjustment model. The program calculates each patient's unique set of risk-adjustors, and renders them into spreadsheet form. With all of the risk-adjustors at hand, a simple editing of the most recent SRTR Expected Survival Worksheet (ESW) allows patients to be added (e.g. a new 6 months' worth of transplants), and to be omitted (the oldest 6 months), thus enabling the formation of cohorts that will be reported on in future PSRs. The estimation method described was implemented fairly recently, and consequently only a few PSR's worth of longitudinal information on its predictive effectiveness exists at this time. What data has been generated, however, indicates a reasonably close estimation of the actual, SRTR-reported expected number of events is being obtained (see Figure 1 ). We have used it for heart, kidney, liver, and lung.",

The sheet also enables transplant center leadership to engage in hypothetical modeling, adding events likely to happen, or changing high value donor and recipient covariates that impact risk adjustment. Accuracy is also increased, as much of the data employed by the sheet is exactly that used by the SRTR. Using this method to predict expected events comes reasonably close to those actually reported by the SRTR. Introduction: Time from referral to appointment for kidney transplant evaluation is an important metric. Demands of dialysis schedules and transportation logistics typically lead to high no-show rates, cancelled appointments and long appointment waiting times. We sought to meaningfully decrease our time to kidney transplant evaluation. Methods: Sequential interventions are described: Intervention 1: We scheduled all Medicare patients with next available appointments immediately after receiving referrals. Commercial patients were scheduled 2 weeks after receiving referrals to allow for fi nancial authorizations. Simultaneously, we increased the number of available appointments on Tuesdays and Thursdays due to the large volume of candidates who dialyze M/W/F. Intervention 2: We noted that no-",

Following intervention 2 (reminder letters, phone calls), the referral to evaluation time decreased to 40 days with a concomitant drop in No-show rate from 22% to 16%. While these interventions were helpful, intervention 3, back-fi lling cancelled appointments, showed the most dramatic effect on time to evaluation, with a decrease to 19 days.",

Review of the waitlist demonstrated that our strategies were ineffective based on the high % of pts inactive for extended periods of time (>1 yr). In anticipation of the need for a robust waitlist policy we leveraged our in house donor call group to facilitate evaluation of our active waitlist & our waitlist coordinator focused solely on the inactive list. Diversifying efforts was used to target pts that required on-site re-evaluation, additional testing or other multidisciplinary team resources. The aim of this study was to apply LEAN principles & aggressively manage the entire inactive waitlist over the course of 4 mos. Methods: We employed the DMAIC Lean Six-Sigma process improvement strategy to our waitlist. We defi ned our inactive waitlist starting as of May 24, 2017 and we designated this as our baseline cohort. Our measurement was evaluation of our waitlist and conversion to active, require re-evaluation or removal. The strategy to target individual pts was defi ned by our multidisciplinary team to identify pts at highest risk for mortality and those who would benefi t most from activation based on age. Analysis of our interventions was evaluated weekly through team communication via email and collated monthly during our quality meetings. Improvement in the process was determined based on status on the inactive waitlist. Control included continual reprioritization of the inactive waitlist based on weekly data and overall assessment of the inactive list. Results: All the inactive pts on the waitlist were reviewed during a 4 month period. Due to transplant volume equaling waitlist additions the distribution of the waitlist was not dramatically altered as shown in Table 1 . However, the inactive list focus allowed the activation of pts <35 years of age and re-activation or delisting of those >65 yrs. Our total inactive waitlist was altered by 44% (149/340).",

We also plan to evaluate patient satisfaction with Txp Rx services in the clinic as well as evaluate the impact of Txp Rx services on tacrolimus variability and non-adherence. Medication adherence post transplantation is vital. Upon discharge, abdominal transplant patients receive a medication list from the electronic medical record (EMR) and obtain a medication teaching tool that includes pictures of medications (Medication Action Plan (MAP)). Patients typically rely on the MAP for their medication schedule post-transplant. This MAP does not communicate with the EMR and there are often discrepancies between these lists. Multiple providers are involved in medication education and documentation which can create additional variation in medication lists. Medication reconciliation discrepancies on discharge may lead to medication errors and patient harm. In 2016, an average of 4.9 medication discrepancies per patient were identifi ed between the MAP and electronic medication list in 51 patients. A quality improvement project was undertaken to decrease the discrepancy rate. Overall, we analyzed the medication records from 103 post abdominal transplant patients that were discharged between March of 2016 and July of 2017. The tests of change (TOC) included: 1. More providers given access to MAP. 2. PharmD provided MAP to discharge provider. 3. Discharge RN role created 4. Inpatient coordinator position was created and an additional discharge RN position was created. The outcome measured was the percent of patients with no discrepancies between medications lists. On average, patients were taking 17 medications daily. The most common types of discrepancies found before implementing the test of change were: omission (27%), dose (23%), schedule (15%), and strength(11%). After implementation of the tests of change, the most common discrepancies included dose (50%), omission (18%), and commission (16%). Prior to implementation of the quality initiative, there were 3% of medication profi les with no discrepancies between the medication list. The tests of change did increase the rate of medication lists without discrepancies. The TOC #1 yielded a 3.7% rate, TOC #2 yielded a 22% rate, TOC #3 yielded a 27% rate, and TOC #4 yielded a 47% of medication lists without discrepancies. Assigning specifi c roles has helped decrease medication discrepancies. Process change is sustainable. Exploration of the optimal role and process continues. ",

Transient mixed chimerism (MC) for up to 3 weeks was induced in all recipients. IS was successfully discontinued in 7/10 recipients for more than 5 years. Four of them remain off IS and continue with normal kidney function after more than 8 to 14 years. Wider clinical application has been hampered by acute kidney injury (AKI) shortly after transplantation in 9/10 recipients. We therefore conducted a pilot study, in which cyclophosphamide was replaced with low-dose (1.5 Gy X 2) TBI. The fi rst two recipients did well without development of AKI. One recipient successfully discontinued his IS at one year and remains well without ongoing IS for 3 years. Because suffi cient chimerism was not detected, low dose IS has been continued in the second recipient. A third TBI recipient received belatacept/ATG in place of anti-CD2 mAb. Transient MC without AKI was observed and he is currently doing well with low dose MMF only to control IgA recurrence. Conclusion: MC and longterm IS free renal allograft survival were achieved without AKI with low dose TBI-based regimens. which were then correlated with the pathological and biochemical parameters of transplanted organs. Subsequently, an 8 gene expression panel, consisting of the increased expression of 6 immunoregulatory genes and the decreased expression of 2 pro-infl ammatory genes, was found to be predictive of tolerance. Methods:In this Phase 2A single center study (LITMUS), we examined whether an 8 target and 5 housekeeping gene expression panel in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and liver allograft could identify operationally tolerant liver transplant recipients. We fi rst measured the panel in PBMC from 54 adult liver transplant recipients who were a minimum of 3 months post-transplant and who had no biochemical evidence of rejection. Patients with a putative tolerant gene profi le in PBMC had a liver biopsy and were then weaned off immunosuppression to confi rm that the gene profi le identifi ed a tolerant state. Results: Of the 54 patients studied, 16 had the putative tolerance gene profi le in their PBMC. Age, gender, indication for transplant, and CNI choice did not correlate with having the tolerant profi le. Twelve patients agreed to enter the withdrawal phase of the study. Prior to withdrawal, a liver biopsy was performed, and 2 patients were excluded as their biopsies showed recurrent autoimmune disease and rejection. Of the 10 remaining patients 5 have now been weaned off of immunosuppresion (IS), 2 are undergoing withdrawal and 3 developed acute cellular rejection, which was easily reversed. Five of eight patients who had the gene expression profi le both in liver and PBMC were successfully weaned off IS. ",

Results: A total of 52 patients were included in the analysis. Two latent classes were identifi ed (Figure): patients with stable eGFR post-DSA (n=28) and patients with rapidly declining eGFR post-DSA (n=24). Patients in the declining trajectory (compared to the stable eGFR cohort) were more likely to have had a living donor (33% vs 7%), have experienced an acute rejection episode (71% vs 25%), have IgG3+ DSA (65% vs 9%), died during follow-up (38% vs 14%), or experience graft failure (58% vs 25%). There were not substantial differences between the classes in age at transplant, race, gender, or delayed graft function. Conclusion: Our fi ndings support the idea that patients may take clear clinical courses after the onset of DSA. Those who develop or have a history of acute rejection and those who have IgG3 positive DSA are more likely to have a fast decline in eGFR and proceed to allograft failure and possibly death",

Discussion: Within the limitations of the study, there is no evidence that machine perfusion improves outcomes for recipients of DCD donor kidneys",

Whereas adoption of the binary Milan Criteria (MC) generalized the practice of LT for HCC and improved outcomes, its predictive character has degraded with increasing candidate and tumor heterogeneity. We sought to validate and recalibrate a previously developed, preoperatively calculated risk score, the hazard associated with liver transplantation in HCC (HALTHCC) in an international cohort. Methods: This cohort from 2002-14 consisted of 4085 patients (both MC in and out [25.2%]) across 16 centers in North America, Europe, and Asia. A continuous risk score using pre-LT levels of alpha feto-protein, model for end stage liver disease sodium score, and tumor burden score was recalibrated amongst a randomly selected cohort (n=1016) and validated in the remainder (n=3079). Results: This international study was used to adjust the coeffi cients in the HALTHCC score. Before recalibration, HALTHCC had the greatest discriminatory ability for overall survival (C-index=0.61) compared to all previously reported",

Using RNA-seq, CD4-DEPKO cells show a defi ciency in cytokine signaling. To validate this possibility, we performed in vitro T helper cell differentiation assays and fi nd that CD4-DEPKO cells produce more IL-4 and IL-17A vs. controls. We also generated Foxp3-DEPKO mice to evaluate DEP function in immunoregulation; KO mice develop patchy skin lesions with hyperkeratosis and local infl ammatory infi ltrates over a 9-12 month period. Phenotyping of T cell subsets from Foxp3-DEPKOs was normal at times preceding dermatitis. In contrast, over time Foxp3-DEPKOs had increased numbers of activated splenic CD4 + T cells (CD69 + : 27% vs. 13%, P<0.05) and expanded populations of memory subsets (CD44 high CD62L low : 93.1% vs. 32.4%; P<0.05). Notably, there was also a dramatic increase in the number of CD4 + Foxp3 + T cells in Foxp3-DEPKO mice (27% vs. 15%; P<0.05), suggesting that there is a high turnover and/or high dedifferentiation of Tregs in the absence of DEP.

These GrB-expressing Tregs showed a Th1 and Th17 like phenotype with increased expression of chemokine receptors that mediate traffi cking to sites of infl ammation (n=20, P< 0.05). However, those GrB-expressing Tregs were signifi cantly more apoptotic than non-GrB expressing Tregs (n=20, P<0.05). This potentially novel fi nding improves our understanding of Treg survival and suggests that manipulating Gr expression or activity might be useful for designing more effective Treg therapies",

However, many aspects of Breg biology remain unclear, including how and where Bregs regulate immune responses within lymphoid tissues. Unfortunately, Bregs lack a specifi c marker and IL-10 protein can generally only be detected after ex vivo stimulation. Thus, the actual B cell subsets that express IL-10 in vivo remain unknown. Moreover, Breg localization and cellular interactions required for their suppressive function in vivo have never been examined. Using IL-10eGFP reporter mice we could detect GFP+ B cells without ex vivo stimulation. B cell IL-10 increased 2",

Recipients were given a 10-day post-transplant conditioning regimen of total lymphoid irradiation and ATG. Of 29 HLA-matched pts, 24 developed MXC for \u22651 yr and were withdrawn from ISD without subsequent rejection in 23 of the 24, up to 12 yrs of follow-up. MXC persisted after drug withdrawal in 10. However, 14 lost MXC during the 2nd yr while graft acceptance was maintained except in 1 pt with mild rejection 3 yrs off ISD. Pts with graft tolerance had specifi c unresponsiveness to donor cells in MLR even in the absence of MXC. There were 2 graft losses out of 29 during the 12-yr observation period, from disease recurrence. Biopsy obtained from mixed chimeric pts before discontinuation of ISD showed no rejection. Of 22 HLA haplotype-mismatched pts, 18 have been followed for \u22651 yr, and 9 developed MXC that persisted at least 1 yr. MMF was withdrawn from the chimeric pts and they were maintained on tacrolimus (TAC) monotherapy at the end of the 1st yr. Biopsy showed no rejection. However, withdrawal of TAC in 6 during the 2nd yr resulted in loss of MXC with evidence of mild rejection in 3; they returned to ISD. MXC in these HLA-mismatched pts did not follow the \"classical\" paradigm -it was dependent on ISD. The remaining persistent chimeras have been maintained on TAC monotherapy. There has been no graft loss or chronic rejection in the 22 pts, with up to 7 yrs of follow-up. Neither severe or chronic infection, nor graft versus host disease, has been observed in the HLA-matched and -mismatched pts. In conclusion, persistent MXC was associated with lack of rejection in both HLA-matched and -mismatched pts. Lack of rejection off ISD was observed even after loss of chimerism in HLA-matched pts, but not in HLA-mismatched pts. Persistent MXC in HLA-mismatched pts maintained on low-dose TAC monotherapy is a desirable outcome",

Pts ranged in age from 18-65 yrs. Enrollment was agnostic to degree of HLA match; chimeric pts retained chimerism after removal of IS, remain rejection-free w.o DSA, and show immune competence. Transiently chimeric subjects resumed endogenous hematopoiesis and are maintained on low-Oral Abstracts dose IS with stable renal fcn. There have been two cases of GVHD: one grade 1-2 acute GI GVHD that responded to steroids; this pt has developed chronic GVHD. The second presented late following development of symptoms and manifested treatment resistant GI GVHD with associated CMV that proved fatal at 11 months post-Tx. There have been two additional graft losses, both previously reported and related to infections. A second subject death occurred in a heavy (>100 pack yr) smoker who developed advanced stage lung cancer 4.5 years after Tx. Overall patient survival is 94.4% and death censored graft survival 94.1%. In summary, high levels of durable chimerism and tolerance with a low (5.5%) incidence of GVHD has been achieved in recipients of FCRx + LDKTx",

The primary objective of this study is to determine biomarkers predictive of chimerism and tolerance. mRNA from PBMC from 9 stable donor chimeric (SDC) patients and 4 TDC patients at pretransplant, 9 months, and 18 months post-transplant were analyzed by microarray. Select immunomodulatory markers were then analyzed by qPCR and fl ow cytometry. The microarray revealed 681 and 129 differentially expressed genes after transplant in SDC patients and TCD patients, respectively, indicating that SDC patients had more profound and lasting biological changes. We found 311 genes differentially expressed before transplant between the two groups. PD-L1 was one of the most differentially expressed genes before transplant in patients who became durably chimeric vs. ones that were only transiently chimeric (1.33 fold change; P<0.001). The PD-L1/CD86 ratio gives an integrated snapshot of the strength of regulatory events relative to infl ammatory events and has been used to predict outcomes in liver transplant. qPCR analysis showed that SDC patients experienced a 13.2 fold increase in PD-L1 expression after transplant while TDC patients experienced only a 0.9 fold increase. The PD-L1/CD86 ratio became higher overall in SDC patients. In addition, SDC patients showed an increase in PD-L1/CD86 ratio 18 months after transplant while TCD chimeric patients showed no change. In conclusion, the PD-L1/CD86 ratio might serve as a biomarker to predict success in clinical FCRx tolerance trials",

Moreover, in HEK293T cells that overexpress the PIR-A3 receptor, they bind the H-2Dd pentamer with much higher affi nity, thus defi nitively demonstrating the allospecifi city of PIR-A3 to allogeneic MHC class I molecules. We also showed in a reporter system consisting of PIR-A3 extracellular domain fused to CD3e intracellular domain that binding of allogeneic MHC class I molecules to PIR-A3 triggers signaling activities in reporter cells. In our model PIR-A3 expression on macrophages requires CD40 stimulation, primarily due to chromatin remodeling at Pira and Pirb loci. Further in vivo studies showed that treatment of Rag1 -/-\u03b3c -/-mice with PIR-A3/Fc fusion protein inhibited the induction of allospecifi c macrophages and rejection of allogeneic BALB/c cells, and in the BALB/c-to-B6 heart transplantation model, the PIR-A3/Fc fusion protein inhibited macrophage activation, and signifi cantly prolonged allograft survival. In conclusion, we identifi ed PIR-A3 as the innate allorecognition receptor that confers macrophages the ability to directly recognize allogeneic non-self in transplant settings, and this fi ndings are signifi cant in developing new antirejection therapies",

NLRP3 defi ciency (CD45.2+) was restricted to B cells (98\u00b10.5%) and limited in non-B cells (15\u00b15%). 12 weeks later, chimeras received OT1 (1 x 10 6 ) and OT2 (3 x 10 6 ) Thy1.1+ T cells followed by H2b/d-Ova heart transplants. Extent of chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV) was assessed by morphometric quantitation of luminal occlusion of vessels at 70days. We examined endogenous (Thy1.1-) and transferred T cell (Thy1.1+) functions after restimulation with donor cells by FACS. B cell cytokines were analyzed after CpG DNA and donor cell stimulation",

Redfi eld. 1 1 Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI; 2 Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI.Introduction: Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) remains a signifi cant problem in highly sensitized individuals undergoing kidney transplantation. APRIL (A Proliferation Inducing Ligand) and BLyS (B Lymphocyte Stimulator) are critical survival factors for B lymphocytes and plasma cells, which are the primary source of alloantibody. We examined the effect of blocking APRIL/BLyS together and BLyS alone in a sensitized kidney transplant model. Methods: c57/B6 mice were sensitized with intraperitoneal injections of BALB/c splenocytes. Following four weeks of sensitization, animals then received control Ig, BAFF-R Ig (to block BLyS alone) or TACI-Ig (to block APRIL and BLyS) for 7-10 days prior to transplantation with BALB/c kidneys. All animals were continued on treatment and received cyclosporine (10mg/kg) post-transplant. Animals were harvested on post-operative day 7. Spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes were analyzed using fl ow cytometry and ELISPOT. Transplanted kidneys were analyzed via immunohistochemistry. Results: APRIL/BLyS blockade demonstrated a signifi cant reduction in antibody secreting B cell production of IgM and IgG in spleen and bone marrow compared to BLyS blockade alone or control Ig treatment (p<0.05). Additionally, APRIL/ BLyS blockade resulted in a signifi cant depletion of follicular B lymphocytes (CD138+IgD+) in splenocytes when compared to control Ig (p < 0.05). No signifi cant change was noted in marginal zone B lymphocytes (CD138-IgD+). Newly formed B lymphocytes (CD138-IgD-) were decreased in animals with APRIL/BLyS blockade but was not statistically signifi cant.Conclusion: APRIL/BLyS blockade signifi cantly depleted IgM and IgG production in antibody secreting B cells and decreased populations of mature B lymphocytes as seen in the follicular B lymphocytes. These fi ndings support further studies of APRIL/BLyS blockade as a method to target alloantibody.

PD-L1 has been detected in cases of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), though data is limited and clinical correlation is lacking. In this study, we examine PD-L1 expression in PTLD and evaluate for clinical correlation. Methods: We identifi ed 21 PTLD cases in kidney transplant recipients diagnosed at our institution from 2/1996 to 4/2017. Using paraffi n-embedded tissue biopsies, we examined 21 primary tumors for expression of PD-L1 using PD-L1 monoclonal antibody performed with PAX5 as a double stain. We scored expression of PDL-1 on lesional B-cells (identifi ed with PAX5) as a percentage of positive cells. Clinical course and outcome were obtained from retrospective chart review. Results: Patient ages at diagnosis ranged from 2.4 to 20.8 years with median follow up time of 3.5 years (range 0.1-13.6). 2 patients transferred care shortly after diagnosis. Of those treated at our institution, 5 received chemotherapy and 3 died from PTLD. One fatality developed graft failure during therapy. Applying revised 2017 WHO classifi cation showed 6 non-destructive PTLDs (4 infectious mononucleosis and 2 fl orid follicular hyperplasia), 9 Polymorphic PTLD cases and 8 monomorphic PTLD cases (6 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 2 Burkitt lymphomas). The median number of B-cells expressing PDL1 in all cases is 30% (range 5-90). The average PD-L1 expression by subtypes of PTLD is as follows: Non-destructive PTLD 11%, polymorphic PTLD 43% and monomorphic PTLD 73% (p=0.01). EBV positive PTLD cases(17/21, 81%)  also showed higher PD-L1 expression (49% vs 21%, p=0.023) as compared with EBV negative PTLD cases.Conclusion: Signifi cant differences in PD-L1 expression are seen among different subtypes of PTLDs with monomorphic PTLDs showing highest expression. Among 3 patients who died of their disease, 90% of lesional B-cells expressed PD-L1. This study suggests use of PD-L1 directed therapies should be considered in select cases of monomorphic PTLDs, particularly in those whose transplant is not life-sustaining.

We sought to characterize individual T-cells and identify the functional phenotype of clones expanded in situ through T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. Methods: Graft infi ltrating T-cells are being examined from coronary arteries and endomyocardium isolated during retransplant for CAV and compared to the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). After enzymatic digestion, T-cells are i) index sorted ii) analyzed using 13-colour fl ow for surface markers (eg.CD4, CD8, CD45RA/RO, CTLA4)",

The aim of current study was to test NK cell infi ltration and activation within allograft and the consequence of high DSA titers on graft outcomes in the absence of NK cell inactivation. C57BL/6 and B6.CCR5 -/mice transplanted with complete MHC mismatched A/J or semi allogeneic (A/J x B6) F1 kidney grafts responded with equivalent DSA titers that reached peak by day 14 post-transplant and were maintained thereafter. B6.CCR5 -/recipients rejected A/J allografts between days 15-30 whereas B6 isografts and (A/J x B6)F1 semi allogeneic grafts survived past day 65. NK cell infi ltration into A/J allografts was composed of distinct CD49b + cell populations expressing low and high levels of NK1.1 that were fi rst detected on day 7 post-transplant at numbers equivalent to those observed in (A/J x B6)F1 grafts. NK cell numbers of both populations continued to increase with time post-transplant within A/J allografts but decreased to background/isograft levels in (A/J x B6)F1 grafts. On day 7 post-transplant NK1.1 high cells were the predominant proliferating NK cells in A/J allografts, but NK1.1 low cells became the dominant proliferating NK cells on day 14. Histopathology of functioning (A/J x B6)F1 grafts at day 65 post-transplant indicated severe chronic injury with severe interstitial fi brosis, glomerulopathy and arteriopathy. Expression of genes encoding profi brogenic factors, including MMP7, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), P-selectin, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin in A/J allografts continued to increase until the time of rejection. These increases were also observed with time post-transplant in (A/J x B6)F1 grafts with the exception of MMP7. These results indicate that NK cells synergize",

The prevalence of recurrence varies widely and large-scale studies on a UK population have never been performed. The NIHR Health Informatics Collaborative (HIC) was set up to collect and standardise patient data across the Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centres for the purposes of enabling translational research. Proof of concept was by delivery of an exemplar project. The exemplar project for the Transplantation theme is focusing on recurrent disease within renal allografts and epidemiological factors infl uencing recurrence. Methods: Data is being collected on renal transplant recipients transplanted between 2005-16 at four UK transplant centres, namely Cambridge, Guy's, Imperial and Oxford. A total of 6001 recipients have been identifi ed. Episodes of recurrent disease are being identifi ed from histology reports using the development of text-mining software. The software output is being validated against manual clinical interpretation of 10% of reports. Using the software we have calculated the prevalence of disease for each GN and are analysing demographic infl uences focusing on age, gender, ethnicity, type of transplant (live donation, DBD or DCD) and immunosuppression. We also studied the time to recurrence in each GN and the incidence of allograft failure. Results: Preliminary results on 11.605 biopsy reports have demonstrated that FSGS and IgA nephropathy are the two most common recurrent diseases posttransplantation. We are now in the process of analysing the infl uence of various demographics on recurrence. Discussion: This exemplar study demonstrates the ability of four large UK renal transplant centres to collaborate and produce large-scale data to support translational research in the future. Standardisation of data, especially unstructured data such as biopsy reports provides a major challenge for automated collection but can be overcome using modern computing. Such collaboration allows research into areas such as recurrent disease where numbers in individual centres are too small for meaningful analysis.CITATION INFORMATION: Aguiar R. Multicentre Epidemiological Study on Prevalence of Recurrent Glomerular Disease Post-Transplantation in the United Kingdom Am J Transplant. 2018;18 (suppl 4).The 10-year recurrence rates for IgAN adjusted with estimated glomerular fi ltration rate in related and unrelated donors were 43.5% and 19.0%, respectively. There were no statistically signifi cant differences observed in terms of graft failure, biopsy-proven rejection, and kidney function. However, KTRs who demonstrated recurrence showed a higher incidence of tonsillectomy and steroid use.ConclusionsOur results suggest that signs and symptoms of recurrent IgAN should be evaluated aggressively in KTRs undergoing related-donor transplantation. There is a need for further studies related to genetic and/or familial interactions in KTRs with IgAN and related donors.CITATION INFORMATION: Okumi M., Okada D., Unagami K., Kakuta Y., Shirakawa H., Shimizu T., Omoto K., Ishida H., Tanabe K.

There is no established therapeutic intervention to prevent or treat recurrent primary FSGS. We studied the outcomes and the complications of the different treatments used in our renal department for recurrent FSGS post-transplantation. Methods: We retrospectively collected data on renal transplant recipients transplanted in our hospital from 2005 to 2016 who were diagnosed with primary FSGS and transplant biopsy proven recurrent primary FSGS. year of follow up, there was no difference regarding the graft survival among the groups. There were two deaths in the Necker group and one death in the other groups. However, this did not reach statistical signifi cance and the patient survival was comparable among treatments. Compared with the other treatments, patients treated with the Necker protocol were at a higher risk of infection (p< 0.01). Discussion: Renal transplant patients diagnosed with recurrent FSGS and treated with the Necker protocol were at a higher risk for infection compared to other therapeutic options. There was no difference in terms of allograft survival and patient survival among the treatment groups.Background. Due to high recurrence rate, poor kidney transplant (KTx) survival has been reported for recipients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). More recently, prophylaxis with eculizumab has shown encouraging results. Methods.

A three-step process of education and consent was used pre-enrollment. Donor HCV genotyping during allocation allowed us to restrict transplant only to kidneys from GT 1a or 1b donors, with Grazoprevir/Elbasvir treatment on day 3 post-transplant when recipient HCV was detected. In this ongoing trial, we demonstrate safety and effi cacy of transplanting kidneys from HCV-infected donors into HCV-patients, with durable HCV cure data as long as 12 months post-transplant. 6-and 12-month renal function remains excellent, which suggest that HCV-infected kidneys can be transplanted with good intermediate-term function. Future work is needed in a larger sample, but these results suggest that expanded use of HCV-infected kidneys could drive hundreds more transplants in the US.

J. Furuzawa-Carballeda, 1 N.Previously, we found greater amounts of FoxP3 cells and lower amounts of CD4+/IL-17A+ and senescent cells in belatacept (Bela) patients compared to patients under cyclosporine (CsA) treatment in 12 mo graft biopsy from patients participating in the BENEFIT study. The BENEFIT have demonstrated that seven years after kidney transplantation (KT), patient and graft survival and the mean eGFR were signifi cantly higher with Bela than with CsA. Whether the immunophenotype of infl ammatory vs regulatory cell subsets infi ltrating the graft participates in BENEFIT\u00b4s clinical fi ndings a decade after KT, constitutes the aim of this study. Patients and Methods: Thirty-two adults, functionally stable KTR, accepted and signed informed consent for graft biopsy (Bxs) performance: n=22 continue on Bela, n=7 continue on CsA, and n=3 were switched from Bela to Tacrolimus during the fi rst 6 months post-KT.

Prevalence of Frailty among Kidney Transplant Recipients in the United States Am J Transplant. 2018;18 (suppl 4).BackgroundThe incidence of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) among older adults (65+) is increasing. Living Donor Kidney Transplant (LDKT) may provide improved outcome even for this patient population, since surgery can be better planned and complications and graft outcomes are better with LDKT versus deceased donor transplant. Older individuals, however, may be hesitant to consider this option. We are not aware of recent studies that would systematically assess the association between recipient's age and the readiness of pursuing LDKT. In this cross-sectional study we wanted to determine whether older age is associated with less readiness to pursue LDKT.

UTI had no negative impact on short-term graft survival.Conclusion: Advanced age is an independent risk factor for UTIs and these patients should be followed-up carefully regarding UTI. Prevention of prolonged hospitalization and limitation of unnecessary antibiotic use in transplant patients should be considered. Since there is a high incidence of UTI in male transplant patients more frequently caused by resistant microorganisms in our cohort, infection control methods should be applied more vigorously especially in male transplant patients.

There was no signifi cant difference in the incidence of graft failure, but graft failure was caused by BKVAN in ABOiKT with high viremia and by acute rejection in ABOcKT with high viremia. However, there was no signifi cant difference in graft survival between ABOiKT and ABOcKT. Conclusions: ABOiKT recipients have a greater risk for BK viremia and BK allograft nephropathy compared to ABOcKT. In ABOiKT, high BK viremia was associated with worse graft function although it did not affect graft survival.CITATION INFORMATION: Yoon J., Baek C., Park S-.K., Kim H.

Conclusions: ESRD due to PKD is associated with a decreased risk of posttransplant BK infection. BK infection primarily establishes itself in proximal renal tubular epithelial cells. The renal tubular epithelial cells in PKD are unique; they are in a proliferative but nondifferentiated state. Whether this characteristic of renal tubular epithelial cells alters the BK viral reservoir or replication in PKD patients warrants further study.

We describe the signifi cance of dn HLA IgG DSAs and their subclasses in cAMR.Discussion:We show that the presence of class II IgG DSAs in cAMR is particularly detrimental to graft survival and also highlights the signifi cance of IgG2, IgG3 and cumulative subclasses in predicting poor outcomes. Characterisation of IgG DSAs in cAMR may help to predict outcome and target patients for particular therapeutic strategies.

Patients were randomized by the University of Utah Investigational pharmacy(Table 1) SOC included intra/post-operative narcotics that were controlled. Patients were followed during the hospital stay. Outcomes were bleeding, 30 day mortality, renal function, narcotic use, length of hospital stay (LOS), and urinary retention. The Washington State Agency Medical Director's Group Opioid dose calculator was used to provide a total morphine dose equivalent (MDE). Data were analyzed using R 3.4.1 using a t, exact Wilcoxon rank sum, chi-squared, or Fisher's exact test. The hospital cost of this protocol was <$10/patient. Results(Table 1)LOS was signifi cantly reduced by 10% in the study group versus the SOC+placebo group. MDE were signifi cantly reduced by 40% the study group versus the SOC+placebo group.There were no patient deaths, blood transfusions or renal dysfunction in either study Arm. Conclusion Opioid addiction and cost of care are important concerns in surgery. The use of this non-opioid analgesics protocol for LD nephrectomies decreased the use of narcotics without an increase in complications compared to SOC. There was signifi cantly reduced LOS and less narcotic use in the study group versus the SOC+placebo group. The protocol was <$10/patient and LOS was signifi cantly decreased. This protocol may decrease cost for LD nephrectomies.CITATION INFORMATION: Campsen J., Call T., Rosales A., Allen C., Presson A., Kim R.

Bowers. 1 1 Transplant Surgery, Tampa General Medical Group, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, FL; Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology, University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine, Tampa, FL; 3 Transplant Research, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, FL. : The effect of donor hypothermia is known to signifi cantly reduce the rate of delayed graft function (DGF) in cadaveric donor kidney transplantation. The effect of hypothermia in living kidney transplants (LKT)has not been well explored. We hypothesized donor hypothermia affects living kidney transplantation results. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study from January 2014 -December 2016 on all consecutive LKTs performed at our transplant center. We examined the correlation of donor (D) and recipient (R) temperatures in LKT based upon four groupings of temperature combinations of donors (prior to cross clamp) and recipients (prior to reperfusion) with temperature \u2265 36 0 C and or <36 0 C . The difference in continuous variables across compared groups was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test and were reported as a mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Binary variables were compared using chi-square test. Statistical signifi cance was set at 5% for all comparisons. Results: We performed 117 LKT. P=.02. Conclusions: Donor and recipient hypothermia in living kidney transplantation correlates with less DGF and greater decline in creatinine compared with hypothermic donors and warm recipients.

Conclusion: KT Candidates with LHL are less likely to be listed for KT and those who are listed are at increased waitlist mortality risk. Those with LHL at the time of KT experience longer lengths of hospital stay.

Yet, the causes of this disparity are not understood.In this study, 714 patients presenting for transplant evaluation at UCLA between May 2014 and March 2017 were followed for a median of 24 months to determine if they had received a LDKT. We used a sequential series of Cox regression models, starting with the unadjusted impact of race (Model 1), to determine the extent to which socioeconomic status (SES) (Model 2), psychosocial variables (Model 3), and LDKT decision-making variables (Model 4) reduced the disparity. Finally, we fi t a parsimonious model (Model 5) using backward selection to determine the best predictors of time to LDKT. In total, 184 (26%) Black, 275 (39%) Hispanic, and 255 (36%) White patients participated. Since only 5 Black patients received LDKT, we dichotomized race as White vs. non-White.

Little is known about the association between social support and access to KT. We surveyed 596 kidney patients (38% Female, 26% Black, 38% Hispanic, 35% White) presenting for KT evaluation about their needed vs. received social support. We also reviewed medical records to identify the number and relationship of caregivers attending transplant evaluation. Then, we determined whether patients were waitlisted for transplant or received a LDKT. A majority (90%) of patients reported receiving as much or more social support than they needed. Only 13% of patients attended transplant evaluation alone. Black patients were more likely to attend evaluation alone (20%) compared to Hispanic or White patients (7% and 13%, respectively, p<0.001). The majority of patients (71%) brought one caregiver to evaluation with 16% bringing two people or more. Of the 636 caregivers, 66% were female; 40% were spouses, 14% parents, 14% children, 11% friends, 12% siblings, and other relatives of the patient (7%). With a median follow-up time of 14 months, 60% of these patients were waitlisted, and 69 (12%) received a LDKT. Patient-reported adequacy of social support was not associated with either time to waitlist or LDKT but patients with a greater number of caregivers were placed on the waitlist or transplanted faster (Figure 1).Patients who present with a larger support network during evaluation have greater access to KT.

However, identifi cation of MNA is challenging and tools to predict pts at risk for MNA are inexact. While several tools have been suggested to identify pts at high risk for MNA, few studies have examined such tools prospectively to identify pts at risk for adverse immunological outcomes of MNA. METHOD: The IMPACT study evaluated the 1 year natural history of a low-risk, unselected longitudinal cohort of 106 pediatric kidney Tx pts on tacrolimus (TAC) maintenance immunosuppression. Protocol biopsies were obtained at 6 and 12 months. Self-report MNA was assessed by Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ), while barriers to adherence were measured by the Parent Medication Barrier Scale (PMBS) and Adolescent Medication Barrier Scale (AMBS)",

Assessment and Outcomes of Medication Nonadherence in Pediatric Kidney Transplant Recipients: Results from the IMPACT Study Am J Transplant. 2018;18 (suppl 4).Introduction: Despite the fact that the number of pediatric patients listed for kidney transplantation far exceeds the supply of deceased donor kidneys, there is a reluctance to use DCD kidneys for a multiple of reasons, including the risk of delayed graft function. We investigated allograft survival in pediatric kidney transplant recipients who received a DCD allograft. Methods: The United Network for Organ Sharing database was queried to examine outcomes in all kidney transplant recipients from 1996 to 2017. Patients were divided into adult vs. pediatric (<18 years) status and donation after brainstem death (DBD) vs. DCD allograft status. Donor and recipient demographic data were examined, and allograft survival was calculated. Kaplan Meier survival curves were generated. Categorical differences were compared using the unpaired Student's t-test and nominal variables using either the Chi Square or Fisher's exact test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered signifi cant. Results: 272 pediatric kidney transplant recipients received a DCD allograft. The donors in the DBD group were older than those in the DCD group (28.2 vs. 21.6 years) with a lower KDPI (23% vs. 26%). In the DBD group, the average age at transplant was younger (10.6 vs. 12.9 years); PRA was lower (9% vs. 12%); cold storage time was shorter (9.7 vs. 15.2 hours); mean length of stay was longer (13.2 vs. 10.6 days); and the rate of rejection was higher (18.8% vs. 17.3%). There was no signifi cant difference in allograft survival between the two groups.Group 2 represents pediatric DBD recipients, while Group 4 pediatric DCD recipients. Conclusion: There is no difference in allograft survival in pediatric kidney transplant recipients who receive a DCD kidney allograft. DCD kidney allograft use should be considered in pediatric patients to expand the donor pool.CITATION INFORMATION: MacConmara M., Levea S., Hwang C.

We hypothesized that PED REN Tx rates (TR) vary by donor service area (DSA) based on the presence of a multi-organ Tx center (MOTx) and supply to demand ratio (SDR) (# of KDPI<35% kidney donors recovered divided by PED candidates in the DSA. For MOTx we included kidneys recovered in the DSA but used either locally or non-locally. We analyzed UNOS data (Pre-KAS: 12/4/2012-12/3/2014 vs. post-KAS: 12/4/2014 to 12/3/2016). TR is the number of kidney alone Tx per active patient-year. Tx relative ratio (TRR) is post-KAS TR divided by pre-KAS TR. Although national PED REN TR remained unchanged; pre-KAS {(1.033) vs. post-KAS (1.030) (CI 0.916, 1.085)}, 4 DSAs had a signifi cant increase, and 3 had a signifi cant decrease in PED REN TRR. Similarly, 11 Tx centers had a signifi cant increase, and 4 had a signifi cant decrease in their PED REN TRR. However, the DSA and center level differences did not persist after correcting for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni method). Scatter plots showed a signifi cant positive correlation between SDR and post-KAS PED REN TR p=.02, and signifi cant negative correlation between PED REN TR and MOTx p=.01. This study shows several fi ndings. First, the proportion of kidneys used for MOTx by DSA, was negatively associated with PED REN TRs. Second, PED REN TRs are lower for candidates listed in DSAs with fewer kidney donors with KDPI<35%. Additional KAS studies are needed to determine other factors that may contribute to inequities, limited access, and decreases in PED REN TR.

K. Sgambat, S. Clauss, A. Moudgil. Children's National, Washington DC. : Children with kidney disease have altered body composition and short stature that may not be accurately assessed by standard methods. The measure of obesity that best predicts cardiovascular (CV) risk in pediatric kidney transplant (tx) recipients has not been established. Objective: A prospective cohort study was conducted to investigate ability of BMI, waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-height ratio (WHr) to identify CV risk in pediatric kidney tx recipients. Methods: Tx recipients, age 3-20 years, had echo, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), BMI, WC, WHr, blood pressure, lipids and leptin measured at 1, 18, and 30 months post-tx. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare ability of BMI, WC, and WHr to detect a composite adverse CV outcome. Presence of the composite outcome was defi ned by \u22653 of the following:1) left ventricular hypertrophy 2) high CIMT 3) impaired myocardial strain 4) dyslipidemia 5) hypertension. Results: Analysis of 116 visits of 42 children over 1 to 30 months post-tx was conducted. Prevalence of obesity by WHr (43.5%) was higher vs. BMI (24.1%) and WC (12.0%), p<0.03. Children obese by WHr had twice the composite adverse CV outcomes (62.2%) vs. BMI (34.6%) and WC (33.3%) obese. Leptin of obese was greater than lean (Table 1).

The aim of this study was to investigate whether being on dialysis at the time of renal transplantation affected renal allograft survival in paediatric renal transplant recipients (pRTR). METHODS Data were obtained from the UK Transplant Registry (NHS Blood and Transplant) on all children (aged <18 years) who received a kidney only transplant between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2015.Baseline demographic data were collected, including dialysis modality at the time of renal transplantation (none vs peritoneal dialysis vs haemodialysis). Kaplan-Meier estimates of 5-year renal allograft survival were calculated, as well as Cox regression modelling accounting for donor type. The relationship between time on dialysis and renal allograft survival was also examined. 32%) were on peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis, respectively at the time of transplantation. 5-year renal allograft survival was signifi cantly better in the pre-emptively transplanted group (90.6%) compared to those on peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis (86.4% and 85.7% respectively; p = 0.02).",

There was no signifi cant difference in 5-year renal allograft survival between children who were on dialysis for <6 months and children transplanted pre-emptively (87.5% vs. 90.5%, p = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS Children who are pre-emptively transplanted have improved 5-year renal allograft survival, compared to children on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis at the time of transplantation. Although increased time spent on dialysis was correlated with poorer renal allograft survival, we found no evidence that short periods of dialysis (<6 months) pre-transplant affected renal allograft survival in children.CITATION INFORMATION: Marlais M., Martin K., Marks S.

Isolated Pre-Transplant Angiotensin II Type I Receptor Antibodies (AT1R Ab) Are Not Associated with Reduced Graft Function or Hypertension (HTN) in Pediatric Kidney Transplant (Ped KTx) Patients (pts). H. Pizzo, J. Choi, M. Haas, X. Zhang, E. Kamil, I. Kim, S. Jordan, D. Puliyanda. Comprehensive Transplant Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA. : Pre-tx donor-specifi c antibodies (DSA) raises the risk for antibodymediated rejection (ABMR) and graft dysfunction. The role of AT1R Ab is unclear.In adults, post-tx AT1R Ab can lead to malignant HTN, ABMR, graft thrombosis and failure. We previously showed ped pts with post-tx AT1R Ab and DSA developed ABMR +/-acute cellular rejection and pts with isolated post-tx AT1R Ab did not. Here we examined pre-tx AT1R Ab levels in ped KTx pts, compared their estimated GFR (eGFR) at 1-year (yr), 2-yr, at most recent followup (f/u), and evaluated the incidence of HTN and ABMR. Methods: 15 non-sensitized (PRA <30 and negative crossmatch) ped KTx pts, 2-17 yrs old, with pre-tx AT1R Ab testing by ELISA were included. Pts were divided into two groups (Grp): Grp A did not have strong pre-tx AT1R Ab (\u226416 units/mL) and Grp B had strong pre-tx AT1R Ab (\u226517 units/mL). Pts received induction immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte globulin or anti IL-2R and maintained on mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and +/-steroids. Post-tx eGFR at 1-yr, 2-yr, and at most recent f/u were determined by the Schwartz equation. Presence of HTN needing anti-HTN medication(s) was also evaluated. Kidney biopsy (KBx) was done in the setting of strong DSA (MFI >10,000) or elevated creatinine and scored by Banff criteria. Results: Of 15 pts, 7 were in Grp A and 8 were in Grp B. At 1-yr f/u, median 57%) pts in Grp A and in 2 of 8 (25%) pts in Grp B (p=0.31). Pts in Grp A did not undergo a KBx. Two of 8 pts in Grp B had a KBx for strong de novo DSA and strong post-tx AT1R Ab: both pts showed ABMR. Conclusion: In non-sensitized ped KTx recipients, isolated strong pre-tx AT1R Ab is not associated with reduced graft function at 1-yr, 2-yr, up to 6-yr post-tx and does not increase the risk for developing HTN. However, the presence of post-tx strong DSA plus strong AT1R Ab is associated with ABMR.CITATION INFORMATION: Pizzo H., Choi J., Haas M., Zhang X., Kamil E., Kim I., Jordan S., Puliyanda D.

Recipients in the A2ALL cohort who underwent LDLT between April 1998 and January 2014 were included. We compared LDLT followed by reLT to LDLT alone.

Vascular thrombosis and primary graft failure are the most common indications for reLT following LDLT. ReLT after LDLT is associated with signifi cantly worse patient survival at 5 and 10 years post-transplant. ReLT poses a complex ethical and emotional dilemma for the transplant team.

The study included all adult candidates listed between 2000 and 2016 (N=5580) with special focus on HCV patients. We compared kinetics over time of transplant indications, outcome on WL and 1-year post-transplant survival. Results: The number of candidates listed for HCV liver diseases increased by 104% from 2000 (n=194) to 2013 (n=395). We observed a switch in LT indications, HCC becoming predominant and representing 54% of HCVcandidates in 2016 and decompensated HCV-cirrhosis representing 38% of LT indications. Listing for retransplantation decreased by 35% since 2013. We also observed i) a signifi cant decrease in WL mortality from 7.4 % in 2013 to 3.3% in 2016, ii) a decrease by 30% of delisting for worsening condition from 2014 to 2016, iii) a 82% increase of delisting for improving condition, iiii) a sharp increase of inactive patients on WL from 23% in 2013 to 60% in 2016.The 1y-graft survival rate has signifi cantly improved between before and after extent use of DAAs.Our study strongly suggests that HCV candidates have been benefi ting from access to DAAs.

Administration of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) after HCV+ LTx results in improved allograft and patient survival. SRTR data were integrated with pharmaceutical claims to identify post LTx HCV treatment (HCV-Rx), insurer, and cost. HCV txp prior to 1/2014, the pre-DAA era (N=21,909), was compared with the post-DAA (N=15,412) era. HCV-Rx patterns were stratifi ed by donor (D) and recipient (R) HCV serostatus and payer: private vs. public. In the pre-DAA era, 18% of LTx recipients received HCV-Rx within three 3 yrs, with minimal differences by serostatus or payer. In the post-DAA era, D-/R+ LTx, publicly insured patients were 23% more likely to be treated at 2 yrs (private 5.2%, public 6.4%, p<.002). Among D+/R+ LTxs, publicly insured patients were 75% more likely to be treated (private 19.8% public vs. 11.3% private). (P<.0001) Post-DAA, the cost of HCV-Rx increased markedly. Pre-DAA cost differed minimally by serostatus ($7,748-$9,825). Post-DAA, HCV-Rx treatment of D+/ R+ LTx ($120,224) was more costly than D-/R+($114,101).This study is limited as viral load could not be determined for R+ patients and the cost of DAA has declined since 2014. Post LTx HCV-Rx was reduced in the DAA era among D-LTx, as these patients may have been previously treated. Treatment of HCV D+ LTx (likely viremic) was reduced in recipients with private insurance as these companies have preauthorization processes which limit access. Further study is needed to assess access to HCV-Rx in viremic LTx recipients.CITATION INFORMATION: Axelrod D., Schnitzler M., Kasiske B., Hess G., Bloom R., Gordon F., Randall H., Lentine K.

The occurrence of and risk factors for IGD during or after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy have not been reported.Methods:We conducted a multicenter study of LT recipients with recurrent HCV who did or did not develop DAA-IGD (1 case: 2 controls; total of 33 cases vs 66 controls, matched by transplant year). We performed a multivariate analysis of factors during and after treatment predictive of DAA-IGD and reported relevant outcomes.Results:The incidence of DAA-IGD in patients treated between 2014 and 2016 was 3.4% (33/978). IGD occurred only after treatment (113 \u00b1 84 days post-therapy). IGD was diagnosed by liver biopsy: 48% of cases had plasma cell hepatitis, 36% acute cellular rejection, 9% chronic rejection, and 6% had a combination of fi ndings. Mean time to liver test resolution was 103 \u00b1 121 days; 25% had persistent abnormalities. Complications: 33% hospitalized, 20% steroid-induced hyperglycemia, 9% infection, one death; no retransplantation. A multivariate regression analysis found signifi cant associations between abnormal liver tests during and soon after DAA therapy and the later diagnosis of IGD. No other risk factors were identifi ed, including type or degree of immunosuppression.Conclusions:Liver tests not signifi cantly improving on DAA therapy and/or worsening soon after completion may be a sign of impending IGD. These indicators should guide clinicians to consider augmentation of immunosuppression and/or liver biopsy to diagnose and treat IGD early on before the more deleterious later clinical presentation.

Protocols vary by transplant center and consensus recommendations are based solely on expert opinion. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of HBV reactivation in anti-HBc Ab positive OLT recipients. Methods: A single center, retrospective, observational study was conducted in anti-HBc Ab positive, HBsAg negative OLT recipients betweenMay 1, 2011 and  October 31, 2017  at an academic medical center. Donor HBsAg or anti-HBc Ab positive grafts were excluded from the analysis. Five months after OLT, one patient in the monitoring cohort had evidence of viral reactivation by HBV DNA PCR analysis (viral load = 2092 copies/mL) without detectable HBsAg. This was not associated with abnormal liver function tests. Treatment was not initiated, and viral load was undetectable one week later. The cumulative rate of viremia was 5.3% for this cohort. There were no HBVrelated complications including graft loss, retransplantation, or death. Conclusions: In this small, low risk cohort of anti-HBc positive/HBsAg negative OLT recipients there were no HBV-related complications. Given the isolated case of transient viremia, further study is required to defi ne optimal screening for these patients.CITATION INFORMATION: Leistman S., Melaragno J., Dokus M., Al-Judaibi B., Babu T.

S. Akkina, A. Desai, J. Yoo, S. Hou, R. Parasuraman. Medicine, Loyola University, Maywood, IL. is well known that chronic kidney disease has signifi cant negative impact on post-transplant survival in heart transplant (HTx) recipients. Here we wanted to evaluate the impact of pre-transplant dialysis on HTx patient and ESRD-free survival. Methods: We identifi ed 1301 HTx recipients who were more than 18 years of age and required pre-transplant dialysis from the United Network for Organ Sharing database between 1/2000-12/2015. The data was analyzed using non-competing risk Cox proportional hazards model for patient and ESRD-free survival. The adjusted models included age, gender, ethnicity, body mass index, cause of heart failure, diabetes, LVAD usage, and pre-transplant ECMO. Results: Of 1301 individuals on dialysis prior to transplant, 822 (63%) that received a HTx alone (HTA) while 479 (37%) received a simultaneous heart/kidney transplant (SHK). In this cohort, 423 died during the study period while 220 developed ESRD or received a kidney transplant. SHK recipients were older, more likely to be African-American and male.

Analyzing Geographic Disparity in the US Heart Allocation System. F. Karami, 1 M. Nayebpour, 2 M. Gentili, 1 N. Koizumi, 2 A. Rivard. 3 1 Industrial Engineering, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY; 2 Schar School of Policy and Government, George Mason University, Arlington; 3 Department of Radiology, Cleveland Clinic, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.Introduction: In the United States, the system to allocate solid organs for transplantation is regulated and maintained by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). The UNOS/OPTN recently approved a major change of the system used to allocate hearts for adult transplant candidates nationwide. The newly approved heart policy alters the categorization of patients into severity status and the sequence of allocation for the most urgent candidate. While the new policy is expected to improve transplant rates and waiting time for the most severe patients, the transplant community has voiced a number of concerns regarding geographic disparity in access to heart transplant in the current system. The main goal of this study is to measure geographic disparities in access to heart transplant across OPOs and regions in the US.Methods:We use a simulation model to measure geographic disparities in access to heart transplant. Several metrics are considered including transplant rate, waiting time and pre-transplant mortality rate. We defi ne a new measure of access which accounts simultaneously for the distance between donor hospitals and transplant centers, and the supply/demand ratio at each transplant center. Results: At the OPO level the minimum, maximum and median transplant rate are, respectively: 0.21, 0.73 and 0.47. At the regional level the minimum, maximum and median transplant rate are, respectively: 0.38, 0.77 and 0.46. Waiting time across OPO varies from a minimum of 17.62 days to a maximum of 605.9 days with a standard deviation equal to 78.39 days; across regions, it varies from 112 to 187 days (st. dev. = 23.1). Pre-transplant mortality rate ranges between 0.4 and 0.56 at the OPO level, and between 0.21 and 0.32 at the regional level. Our access measure reveals a 55% gap between the minimum and the maximum value at the OPO level and 77% at the region level.Conclusion:The results show the need for a change in the heart allocation system to overcome geographic disparity.CITATION INFORMATION: Karami F., Nayebpour M., Gentili M., Koizumi N., Rivard A.

Gibbons, 1 M. Churpek, 1 A. Anderson. 2 Purpose: Heart transplant candidate selection and treatment practices vary substantially across the US. We aimed to determine if transplant center practices modify the survival benefi t conferred by heart transplantation. Methods: SRTR data on all adult heart transplant candidates listed from 2006-2015 were collected. A mixed-effects discrete-time survival model was used to estimate variation in heart transplant survival benefi t between centers. For each recipient, survival with transplant was compared to predicted survival without transplant to estimate the \"life-years gained\" projected over 40 years posttransplant, accounting for pre-transplant waiting time (example displayed inFig 1). The model adjusted for candidate mix by including covariates associated with wait-list and post-transplant survival (age, diagnosis, renal function, ICD, and life support).Results: From 2006-2015, 110 centers listed 30,018 adult candidates and 20,166 were transplanted. The average waiting-time and candidate-adjusted benefi t of heart transplant was 11.2 years, with center rates ranging from 5.4-16.6 years. Top quintile centers saved an additional 4.9 life-years per heart compared to bottom quintile (13.7 years vs. 7.5 years, p<0.01). Fig 2 displays the geographic variation in survival benefi t aggregated at the OPO level. Patients supported with continuous fl ow left ventricular assist devices had a signifi cantly smaller benefi t from transplant than average (8.6 years). Status 1A candidates supported with high dose inotropes or intra-aortic balloon pumps had larger than average survival benefi ts (17 years and 15.6 years). Conclusions: In the current US heart allocation system, there is wide inter-center variation in the benefi t from heart transplant. Center practices have a signifi cant impact on the number of life years gained from heart transplant. CITATION INFORMATION: Parker W., Gibbons R., Churpek M., Anderson A.

Do Recent Heart Transplant Patients Need to Reside Close to the Transplanting Center? A Look at the Impact of Commuting Times on Clinical Outcomes. A. Velleca, E. Kransdorf, J. Patel, M. Kittleson, S. Dimbil, R. Levine, D. Geft, D. Chang, L. Czer, J. Kobashigawa. Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles.Purpose: Compliance after heart transplantation (HTx) is crucial to ensure adequate drug dosing and avoidance of complications especially within the fi rst six months. To ensure care access and compliance, we have required all HTx patients (pts) within 2 months of surgery to reside within 120 min commuting time (CT) from our hospital. In a large metropolitan area, CT to the transplant center is highly dependent upon traffi c. We used Google Maps to assess CT during clinic hours. We evaluated whether increased CT led to missed clinic visits, protocol biopsies(bx) or blood draws. Methods: Between 2008-16 we assessed CT to our clinic for 655 HTx pts. Pts were divided by CT <30 min (n=76), 30-60 min (n=150), 60-90 min (n=155), 90-120 min (n=142), and >120 min (n=132) from the clinic. CT were correlated to non-compliance, defi ned as an unexcused missed scheduled visit, bx, or regular blood draw. In addition, CT were correlated to development of fi rst-year rejection, infection and survival after HTx. CT were calculated individually and as an aggregate in the fi rst 6 months after HTx. Results: There was no difference in the mean number of unexcused missed visits between groups. Survival, rejection rates and freedom from infection were similar between all groups. Conclusion: Policies to have recent HTx pts reside within 90-120 minutes CT to our transplant clinic may not be necessary. Longer CT to the transplant center does not appear to result in greater non-compliance rates.CITATION INFORMATION: Velleca A., Kransdorf E., Patel J., Kittleson M., Dimbil S., Levine R., Geft D., Chang D., Czer L., Kobashigawa J.

Robinson, 1 W. Mahle, 2 R. Davies. 3 1 United Network for Organ Sharing, Richmond, VA; 2 Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA; 3 Children's Medical Center of Dallas, Dallas, TX. : Pediatric heart allocation in the United States was changed in 2016. The primary goal was to better align candidate status with waitlist mortality. Whether the implemented changes have accomplished that goal has not been evaluated. Methods: We reviewed OPTN data as of 8/2017. Waitlist candidates were divided into two groups based on listing date: Pre-Policy 1/31/2015-3/21/2016; Post-Policy 3/22/2016-5/31/2017. Subgroups divided by age (<1 yr vs. \u22651 yr)and etiology of heart failure. Candidate criteria for listing were compared across groups, including the use of exceptions. Waitlist death and transplant rates were also evaluated. Results: The percentage of listings at Status 1A declined after the policy changes (72% vs. 54%, p<0.0001) with a corresponding increase in 1B listings (12% vs. 24%). There was a signifi cant increase is number of children listed as 1A by exception (5% to 9%, p=0.0093). Most of the increase in exceptions occurred among patients \u22651 yr of age (3% vs. 16%, p<0.0001) (Figure 1). There was signifi cant regional variation in exception use (range 0% to 20%, p=0.0403). Death rates were lowest among candidates listed by exception(16 deaths/100 pt yrs, 95%CI 2-58) and highest among candidates on a ventilator (110, 95%CI 62-182). Transplant rates increased for 1A candidates with cardiomyopathy, but not for those with other diagnoses (297[95%CI: 260-339] to 387[95%CI: 331-450] transplants/100 pt yrs). This change was more pronounced for children \u22651yr old at listing (293[95%CI: 250-341] to 482[95%CI: 404-571] transplants/100 pt yrs).Conclusions: Following recent allocation changes, the use of exceptions has increased. Death rates among 1A exception patients are lower than other candidates. These exceptions, predominantly for candidates \u22651 yr old with cardiomyopathy have likely contributed to limiting improvement in transplant rates among other 1A candidates. Modifi cation of behavior regarding exception requests and approvals, and policy changes including a national review board may be necessary to reach the goals of the policy modifi cation.",

Method: HLA-II expression inhuman aortic EC was induced by adenoviral vector expression of CIITA or by pretreatment with TNFa/IFNg and confi rmed by fl ow cytometry.

Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of Rictor caused over-activation of ERK while abolishing phosphorylation of Akt Ser473. Combined treatment of EC with MEK inhibitor UO126 and rapamycin abrogated HLA-II Ab-stimulated activation of Akt and ERK, and further blocked EC proliferation. Conclusions: Treatment with dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors suppresses a novel negative feedback loop mediated by mTORC2, leading to enhanced MEK/ ERK pathway activity in HLA-II Ab-activated signal networks in EC. This data suggests that combined ERK and mTORC2 inhibitors will be required to achieve optimal effi cacy in controlling HLA II Ab-mediated AMR.",

Together our results provide new insights by uniquely demonstrating that IR injury initiates recipient complement activation that in turn drives intragraft necroptosis to cause costimulatory blockade-resistant, T cell-mediated, allograft rejection. The fi ndings provide a foundation for testing whether peritransplant inhibition of necroptosis positively impacts transplant outcomes in humans.MERTK Mediates Transplant Tolerance via IFN-a Regulationof MDSCs and Tregs.

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on the whole spectrum of Banff elementary lesions at 1year post-transplant showed that i-IF/TA aggregated in the TCMR cluster (i, t, ti, t-IF/TA and i-IF/TA) and not in the ABMR (g, ptc, C4d, cg) or chronicity clusters(cv, ci, ct, ah). We observed a positive gradient between increasing level of i-IF/TA and t-IF/TA Banff scores and the risk of allograft loss (p<0.001). i-IFTA may refl ect a TCMR subcomponent of IF/TA related to underimmunosuppression and is associated with poor kidney transplant outcome compared to non-infl ammatory IF/TA. ART m/s and AH m/s develop progressively and relate to reduced graft survival. DSAII relate to earlier and more rapid ART m/s and AH m/s .

Pathway Analysis reveals that B-Cell development, NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response & superoxide radical degredation comprise the top canonical pathways associated with the perturbed genes in our dataset. Pivotal upstream regulators are associated with lymphoid cell development (SPI1), proteasomal degradation (BACH1,LONP1) & regulation of antioxidant proteins (NFE2L2). In silico cell-type enrichment analysis reveals enhanced transcriptional signatures from CD19+ B-Cells, Dendritic cells & CD4+ T-cells in the expression profi les of patients with severe IF/TA. DE genes were used to generate a gene-protein interaction network for further analysis. Zero & fi rst order interactions were examined. Signifi cant gene modules detected in the networks are enriched for B-Cell signalling, ECM-Receptor interaction & chemokine signalling pathways. These data underscore the prominent role of infl ammation in the development of IF/TA and reveal novel potential mediators of this process.Five Factor scores were obtained for each Bx by multiplication of the variables by the Factor loadings.

Park.1 1 Department of Internal  Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Asan Medical Center, Seoul,  Republic of Korea; 2 Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center,  Seoul, Republic of Korea.    : BK nephropathy (BKN) affects graft function and increases the risk of graft failure. The reduction of immunosuppression is the main treatment for BKN. However, acute rejection may develop following immunosuppression reduction, and data regarding the risk factors of acute rejection during the postreduction period are insuffi cient. Methods: Of 758 patients who received a kidney transplantation (KT) between 2008 and 2011, 79 who underwent immunosuppression reduction as BKN treatment were enrolled. The risk factors of acute rejection after immunosuppression reduction were identifi ed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: During the median follow-up period (75 months), acute rejection developed in 21.5% of study group patients and in 22.5% of KT recipients without BKN. The rejection group showed a trend of higher body mass index (24.13\u00b13.92 vs. 22.40\u00b13.31kg/m 2 , P=0.070) and lower FK506 levels than the no rejection group, although mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) doses were not lower in the rejection group. A greater number of patients in the rejection group exhibited reduced calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) level by>20% at 1 month after initial BKV detection(34.2% vs. 7.9%, P=0.008). Multivariate analysis indicated that the peak BKV PCR level (odds ratio [OR], 0.136; 95% confi dence interval [CI], 0.025-0.732; P=0.020), MMF discontinuation (vs. MMF reduction; OR, 0.112; 95% CI, 0.020-0.618; P=0.012) and CNI level reduction>20% (OR, 33.752; 95% CI, 4.263-267.251; P=0.001) were signifi cantly associated with acute rejection.Conclusions: Immunosuppression reduction for BKN does not seem to increase the incidence of acute rejection. However, a CNI dose reduction>20% at 1 month after the initial BKV detection can increase the risk of acute rejection.CITATION INFORMATION: Baek C., Kim H., Yang W., Han D., Park S-.K.

D. Abdelwahab, 1 H. Khamash, 1 S. Kriegshauser, 3 R. Heilman, 1 M. Smith.2 1 Nephrology  and Transplant, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix; 2 Pathology and Laboratory  Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix; 3 Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix.    Post-transplant polyoma virus nephropathy (PVN) prevalence is 1-10%. Defi nitive PVN diagnosis requires polyoma virus presence in infected cells, done with immunohistochemical staining for SV40 antigen. The cortical tangential approach (CTA) is a recent technique that has been adopted by many centers. CTA has been reported to increase the yield of cortical tissue for allograft pathologic assessment with fewer complications compared with traditional perpendicular biopsy approach. Its effi cacy in the diagnosis of PVN has not been investigated. Methods 134 renal allograft recipients from 1/2012 to 12/2016 with a total of 195 biopsies via CTA were included in the study. All patients had serum BK DNA PCR and histologic staining for SV40. Biopsies were reviewed for length of cortex, medulla and SV40 positive cells. SV40 density was calculated for each case. Statistics were obtained using chi-square and unpaired t test. Results All 195 biopsies contained renal cortex (100%) while only 59/195 (30%) contained medullary tissue . The average length of tissue sampled was 16.7mm in the cortex and 6.6 mm in the medulla. The likelihood of a positive SV40 if cortex was sampled was 30% and 51% if medulla was sampled p<0.0001. The SV40 density was much higher in the medulla (19.8 positive cells/mm) compared to the cortex (5.9 positive cells/mm) ( p=0.0003).Was Medulla Sampled?Conclusion Renal allograft biopsies using CTA rarely sample medulla. The presence of medullary tissue dramatically increases the likelihood of a positive SV40 stain and PVN diagnosis. Because of the limited medulla sampled, the CTA may decrease the ability to make a pathologic diagnosis of PVN. CITATION INFORMATION: Abdelwahab D., Khamash H., Kriegshauser S., Heilman R., Smith M.

Recent data suggests that reduced dose tacrolimus + everolimus (tac+ev) may increase Viral-Tc responses, limiting risk for viral infections. Here, we report on the posttransplant viral infection status and Viral-Tc in 19 HS patients treated with tac+ev compared to 372 HS patients maintained on (tac+mmf). Methods: Viremia was monitored by real time-PCR in 19 tac+ev and 372 tac+mmf patients. Viral-Tc levels for CMV and EBV were monitored in all 19 tac+ev and 30 tac+mmf using intracellular IFN\u0263 fl ow cytometry analysis. Results: CMV (5%[1/19]  vs 14% [50/372], p=0.3) and EBV (5% [1/19] vs. 6% [21/372], p=0.9) viremia were similar in tac+ev and tac+mmf patients. However, BK viremia was signifi cantly higher in tac+ev patients (32% [6/19] vs. 14% [51/372], p=0.03). No patients developed PTLD. Viral-Tc for CMV & EBV were eliminated by induction, but rebounded 1-3M post-transplant in both tac+ev and tac+mmf patients, and the results were similar. Data are shown below.Here, pre-transplant Viral-Tc levels (CMV & EBV) are + before transplant and decrease after induction therapy. Viral-Tc activity returns to acceptable levels within 1-3M. Conclusions. Desensitization with alemtuzumab eliminates Viral-Tc responses but recovery is seen in 1-3M post-transplant. Everolimus + reduced dose tac showed similar Viral-Tc responses to standard dose tac+mmf in HS patients and was associated with an increase in BK viremia compared to the tac+mmf group.CITATION INFORMATION: Ge S., Chu M., Karasyov A., Lovato D., Kahwaji J., Vo A., Choi J., Louie S., Jordan S., Toyoda M.

Liver Transplant Survival Index for Recipients with High MELD Score: A Model for Post-Transplant Survival in Severely Ill Patients. J. Steggerda, 1 M. Bloom, 1 C. Bresee, 2 D. Malinoski, 3 A. Klein, 1 K. Kim. 1 1 Surgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA; 2 Biostatistics, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA; Surgery, Oregon Health Science University, Portland, OR. Background: SHARE-35 prioritizes patients with MELD scores \u226535 for regional sharing of liver allografts. Because this policy incentivizes transplantation of sicker patients, this study examines graft survival in the MELD \u226535 population. Methods: Analysis of UNOS STAR database identifi ed 7,397 adult liver transplant (LT) recipients with MELD \u226535 between January 2006 and June 2016. Factors affecting graft survival were evaluated by Cox proportional hazards analysis. Regression coeffi cients were used to generate Liver Transplant Survival Index (LTSI-35). Results: Four risk groups were identifi ed by LTSI-35 quartiles, correlating with Low, Moderate, High, and Severe Risk. Donors' age, graft macrosteatosis \u226530%, donation after cardiac death, cold ischemic time; and recipients' age, liver disease etiology, prior transplant, mechanical ventilation dependence, and dialysis at transplant were signifi cant factors affecting graft survival. Risk groups predicted 25% graft failures at 2693, 1416, 763, and 277 days (p<0.001). One-year graft survival was 89.0% in Low-Risk group vs 68.7% in Severe-Risk group (p<0.001); 3-year graft survival ranged from 81.3% to 52.1% in Low-and Severe-Risk groups, respectively (p<0.001). No signifi cant differences existed between test and validate groups for graft survival at any time point within risk groups. Conclusion: LTSI-35 refl ects the risk of transplantation in high-MELD recipients and supports the use of high-risk donor-recipient pairs. Clinically, LTSI-35 may better inform expected outcomes and aid in graft selection for severely ill recipients to maximize outcomes.

P. Martins, B. Movahedi, A. Ahearn, A. Bozorgzadeh. Dept. of Surgery, Univ of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA. : The current disparity between supply and demand of liver grafts has dramatically increased the waiting time and mortality on the waiting list. The recent approval of direct-acting-antivirals dramatically changed the landscape of hepatitis C treatment with pangenotypic effi ciency superior to 95%. This success opened an opportunity to use hep C positive livers into hep C negative recipients. Methods: We reviewed the electronic records of all patients that received a liver from a hep C + donor (either HCV ab positive or hepatitis C NAT positive). We recorded donor and recipients demographics, complications and response to treatment at 12 weeks. Results: Between 04/29/2016 and 11/21/2017 we transplanted 7 recipients with HCV positive livers. In two of these transplants the initial HCV Ab and NAT tests were negative (non intentional transmission), and in fi ve cases this allocation was intentional (two of these donors were viremic,RNA+). The mean MELD score of recipients was 23 (range 18-42). The mean follow-up was 430.5 days (range 30-570 days). All patients are doing well. There was no transmission in the patients that received HCV+ NAT negative livers. On the other hand, there was transmission in all four patients that received NAT positive livers (genotypes 1A, 1A, 4A/4B/4C, 1A). SVR at 12 weeks occurred in two patients (the other two are still under early treatment). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, we report the fi rst case-series of Intr Low MELD patients have less access to liver transplantation (LT) and increasingly receive 'marginal' organs with risk of graft failure (GF). Despite increased utilization of marginal organs, there is a national trend towards improved graft/patient survival. Thus, previous estimates of donor characteristics associated with GF may no longer apply. Methds: We identifi ed donor characteristics associated with GF at 1-year from 8721 patients who received a LT at MELD score\u226425 using national data. Characteristics were compared between 2 eras; pre-Share35 (6/1/2010-5/31/2013) and post-Share35 (6/1/2013-6/2/2015) to assess for changes in donor characteristics over time. Results: pre-Share35 n=5463.Post-Share35 n= 3258. 1-year graft failure 5.0% pre-Share35 vs 5.3% post-Share35 (p=NS). Signifi cant donor characteristics associated with graft failure pre-Share35/post-Share35.Donor age 60-69 (pre-Share35 HR 1.65 vs post-Share35 HR 0.72 p=0.04), COD: anoxia (pre-Share35 HR 1.24 vs post-Share35 HR 0.61 p=0.03), and donor diabetes (pre-Share35 HR 1.03 vs post-Share35 HR 2.92 p=0.0008) were signifi cantly different by era. Conclusion: Recent changes in the donor pool e.g. increased drug abuse deaths and willingness to use more marginal grafts is driving a change in donor characteristics associated with GF. This is supported by a trend towards decreasing recipient risk with donor COD:anoxia and donor age. Centers declining these grafts on the basis of previous risk factors should be cognizant of changes. However, centers should also be aware of the risk posed by donor diabetes.CITATION INFORMATION: Atiemo K., Skaro A., Craig-Schapiro R., Montag S., VanWagner L., Abecassis M., Levitsky J., Zhao L., Ladner D.

Chen. Organ Transplant Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. and Aim: The reported outcomes of adult liver transplantation using pediatric allografts are largely controversial based on single center studies. We aimed to compare outcomes of adult transplantation using pediatric versus adult donor liver grafts by analyzing a nationwide database. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the Scientifi c Registry of Transplant Recipients data from March, 2002 to December, 2014 identifi ed 1148 liver transplants with pediatric donor livers (PD group, donor age \u226413 years), and 60362 transplants with adult donor livers (AD group, donor age\u226518 years). The graft and patient survival were compared using Kaplan-meier analysis. Results: The adjusted 10-years graft survival rates were signifi cantly higher in PD recipients than in AD recipients (P<0.001). Donor aged 0-6 years, cold ischemia time \u226512 hours, BSAi < 0.78, recipients with serum creatinine \u22651.5mg/dL pretransplant, and ventilator use pretransplant were the independent risk factors of graft loss in adult liver transplant recipients using pediatric donor organs. Based on multivariate analysis of risk factors of graft loss, we established a risk scoring model with excellent stratifi cation of prognostic subgroups (AUC, 0.785; 95% CI, 0.731-0.839).Table 1. Multivariate analysis of 1-year graft failure for pediatric donor group and assigned risk score points The 3-month and 1-year graft survival rates were signifi cantly higher in low risk (91%, 88%) and medium risk (84%, 79%) group than those in high risk (78%, 70%) group (P<0.001). Conclusions: The use of pediatric donors in adult patients yields a better outcome compared with adult-to-adult liver transplantation. A risk-stratifi cation model has been established to allow for better utilization of the scarce resource of pediatric donor liver.

A Calculator for Kidney Transplant Waitlist Outcomes under the New Kidney Allocation System. A. Hart, 1,2 N. Salkowski, 2 A. Matas, 3 B. Kasiske, 2 J. Snyder, 2 A. Israni. 2 1 HCMC, Minneapolis; 2 SRTR, Minneapolis; 3 Univ of Minnesota, Minneapolis.BACKGROUND: Outcomes on the kidney transplant waiting list vary markedly by region and patient characteristics, and the new kidney allocation system (KAS) changed the probability of transplant for many groups. We created a calculator to predict candidates' likely outcomes on the waiting list under the new KAS. METHODS: Data were obtained from the US Scientifi c Registry of Transplant Recipients. The retrospective cohort included 87,795 fi rst-time adult candidates on the deceased donor kidney transplant waiting list between June 1, 2016, and February 28, 2017, censored at transfer to another program, living donor transplant, or 15 years from listing. Predictors included transplant program or donation service area (DSA), age, sex, race / ethnicity, calculated panel-reactive antibodies, dialysis time, blood type, body mass index, and comorbid conditions, with a parsimonious model favored for clinical utility. Outcomes were deceased donor transplant, death or removal from the waiting list, or continuing to wait. To account for competing risks, the modeled cause-specifi c hazards were used to predict the cumulative incidence of each outcome. RESULTS: C-statistics ranged from 0.67 to 0.75 and good calibration was demonstrated with calibration plots. The probabilities of transplant, death or removal from the list, or continuing to wait are shown at 3, 5, and 7 years of follow-up, and include an option to show program-specifi c or DSA-level predictions (Figure 1). CONCLUSION: Since the new KAS, the probability of deceased donor transplant changed for many groups. The updated kidney waitlist calculator provides an individualized prediction of likely outcomes for transplant candidates, helping candidates make informed decisions about treatment options.

We computed Y1 costs for recipients in 2008-2013, for whom Medicare was the primary payer at transplant. The Y2 cohort was similar, with transplant dates 2008-2012.

            "text": "While there is no Medicare time limit for dialysis patients, kidney transplant recipients lose their Medicare coverage 36 months after they receive their transplant. The loss of immunosuppressant drug coverage is associated with an increased risk of allograft failure. Using a Markov model, we compared lifelong immunosuppressant drug coverage for adult kidney transplant recipients with the status quo from the perspective of the Medicare payer over a 20 year time horizon. A multivariable survival analysis of n=110269 adult kidney only transplant recipients under the age of 65 with allograft survival \u2265 36 months between January 2003 and October 2015 in United States Renal Data System was used to estimate incremental graft survival, for those with and without Medicare coverage. Costs were from the SRTR 2016 Annual Data Report and health utility estimates were acquired from the literature. The allograft survival at 10 years after cessation of Medicare coverage was 60.4% compared to 52.5% in patients who continued to receive immunosuppressant drug coverage (p = <0.001). The predicted additional quality adjusted life years (QALYs) with life-long Medicare drug coverage was 0.63, and incremental costs of $58724; the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $93313 per QALY gained. This model was robust in a variety of one-way sensitivity analyses except for the cost of immunosuppression (ICER range: 30864-246845). In a threshold analysis, Medicare drug coverage was cost neutral if the annual immunosuppression payment was $1951 / patient / year for immunosuppression. The ICER was $50,000 per QALY gained if the cost of immunosuppression was $5192 dollars / year. From a comprehensive health payer perspective, the incremental health care cost savings were $11539/person, and annual health care savings were $36 million if a policy of life long immunosuppressant drug was implemented for transplant recipients.We conclude that Medicare provision of lifelong immunosuppression for kidney transplant recipients is cost-effective. Furthermore, this approach leads to greater health and lower net total health care costs.CITATION INFORMATION: Kadatz M., Gill J., Gill J., Scott K.

W. Tsuang, M. Budev. Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland. : Donor lungs are preferentially offered to patients within a local geographic area before being offered to a broader region. This algorithm may prevent patients from accessing appropriately matched donors due to their geographic location. Leveraging simulation software, we hypothesize broader geographic sharing of donor lungs could decrease waitlist time and increase the Lung Allocation Score (LAS) at the time of transplant. The LAS is a clinical acuity score used to prioritize patients; higher scores refl ect a higher priority for transplant. Methods: Our study population included all US lung transplant candidates and donors fromJuly 1, 2009, through June 30, 2011. The thoracic simulated allocation model, a computer allocation simulation program, was developed by the Scientifi c Registry of Transplant Recipients. Each simulation was repeated 10 times using actual donors in random order. Since the same donors and candidates were used in each simulation and were not independent samples, statistical tests of comparisons were not possible. Instead, the average and the minimummaximum range of results for the 10 iterations were described. Simulation 1 used current allocation rules which prioritizes local allocation; simulation 2 removed local allocation and fi rst offered donor lungs to transplant centers within a 500 nautical mile (nm) radius; simulation 3 removed local allocation and fi rst offered donor lungs to transplant centers within a 1,000 nm radius. Results: The simulations showed: average waitlist time was 5.32 months(5.16- 5.47), 4.61 months (4.49-4.70), and 4.73 months (4.69-4.79)  for simulations1,  2,and 3,) for simulations 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Conclusions: Broader geographic sharing can lower waitlist time and increase the LAS at the time of transplant. Our fi ndings may be explained by broader geographic sharing increasing access to appropriately matched donors for waitlisted patients, therefore shortening wait times. The rise in LAS could be attributed to more high acuity patients accessing transplant. Implementing broader sharing at 500 nm (simulation 2) had more impact than extending broader sharing from 500 nm to 1,000 nm (simulation 3). Further study is needed to assess the role of broader geographic sharing in increasing access to lung transplant, and the impact of transplanting more patients at a higher LAS.CITATION INFORMATION: Tsuang W., Budev M.

Findings indicate that 1-year outcomes are not a good proxy for even intermediate post-transplant follow up and suggest performance based on one-year outcomes does not reliably translate to longer-term outcomes for patients.

We aimed to evaluate kidney transplant survival benefi t in previous pancreatic transplant recipients(KAP)   compared to primary isolated (KA1) or repeat isolated kidney (KA2) transplant. Methods: All elective kidney transplants performed for the period 1995-2013 recorded in the Scientifi c Registry of Transplant Recipients database were evaluated. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare patient and graft survival among KAP, KA1 and KA2 groups and multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess the adjusted effect of donor and recipient covariates. Results: Candidates with previous PTA remaining on the kidney transplant wait list have a signifi cantly lower adjusted 3-year patient survival than receiving kidney transplantation (HR = 6.456, 95% CI = 2.646-9.749, P<0.001).The adjusted 10-year kidney graft survival in KA2 patients was the worst (HR=1.197, 95% CI: 1.144-1.252, P<0.001), however, there was no difference between KAP and KA1 (P=0.764). KAP from deceased kidney donors had a signifi cantly inferior 10-year patient survival comparing to those from living kidney donors ( P<0.001) Conclusion: PTA recipients with ESRD obtained a signifi cant survival benefi t after KT compared to those who remain on the waiting list. KAP recipients can achieve similar post kidney transplant survival as a KA1 recipients. CITATION INFORMATION: Tang Y., Zhu Z., Huang S., Zhang Z., Ju W., Guo Z., He X., Chen G.

R. Parsons, J. Wolosyn, R. Lynch. Surgery, Emory University, Atlanta, GA. : Prediction of survival and health resource utilization in the pancreas transplant population requires novel approaches to risk stratifi cation. We studied whether sarcopenia and osteopenia, as correlates of frailty, would predict adverse outcomes, including rehospitalization, graft loss, and death. Methods: We reviewed records for the last 100 consecutive pancreas transplants, including simultaneous kidney pancreas (SPK) and pancreas after kidney (PAK) operations, at our center. Demographic, comorbidities and diabetic complications were studied for patterns with regard to graft and patient survival and hospital readmissions. Post-transplant DEXA bone demineralization results and psoas muscle area (PMA) relative to body surface area were studied for correlation with clinical outcome by logistic regression. Results: Among the study sample, 46% were female and 35% were African American. The mean age at transplant was 38.5 +/-7.3 years. At time of transplant, the mean Karnofsky Performance Score was 76.5 +/-9.6, 18% of patients had known coronary artery disease, 59% had peripheral arterial disease, 59% had retinopathy, and 6% carried a diagnosis of gastroparesis. 79 patients had DEXA scores within 3 months of transplant, with 67% of those showing osteopenia, and 19% osteoporosis (mean t-score -1.91 +/-0.92). Patient survival was 98% at one year, but 10% of patients were admitted for >14 days for their transplant admission and 19% spent >14 days inpatient during readmissions over the fi rst transplant year. Sarcopenia on peri-transplant cross-sectional imaging correlated with burden of readmissions but not index length of stay (fi gure 2). Conclusions: Among pancreas recipients, sarcopenia predicts resource utilization in the fi rst year after transplant better than comorbidities or standard measures such as performance status. Gastroparesis diagnosis is uncommon preoperatively, but is a frequent reason for readmission post-transplant. Sarcopenia, in conjunction with higher-fi delity clinical assessments of frailty, may be useful in preoperative identifi cation and intervention on high-risk transplant candidates.CITATIONINFORMATION: Parsons R., Wolosyn J., Lynch R.

University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI. : Development of de novo donor-specifi c antibodies (dnDSA) has detrimental effects on kidney graft survival. But, there is limited information about the relationship of dnDSA to pancreas graft survival.Methods: We report our experience among pancreas transplant recipients with or without a kidney who were transplanted between 01/01/2005 and 08/31/2017 who had post-transplant DSA monitored. We compared outcomes between the dnDSA+ and dnDSA-groups. dnDSA was defi ned as any detection of DSA which was not present before transplant. Results: We identifi ed 541 pancreas transplant recipients during the study period, of which 121 (22%) developed dnDSA and 421 (78%) did not. Males and Caucasians were signifi cantly more common in the dnDSA-group. Other baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. Mean post-transplant follow up was 4.6\u00b13.6 years in the dnDSA+ and 5.1\u00b13.7 years in the dnDSA-group. Mean interval from transplant to the detection of dnDSA was 2.1\u00b13.1 years, ranging from 15 days to 11.4 years. 39 (32%) developed dnDSA against class I HLA antigen, 68(56%) developed against class II HLA antigen and 14(12%) developed against both class I and II. Out of 121 patients in the dnDSA+ group, 77 had persistent dnDSA on follow up, while in 43 dnDSA was transient and disappeared on last follow up and one did not have DSA rechecked. 63 (52%) of the patients in dnDSA+ and 100(24%) in dnDSA-group underwent pancreas biopsy at some point in time. In some cases enzyme elevation and rejection preceded or was simultaneous to dnDSA appearance, while in others dnDSA was observed without elevation of enzymes but nonetheless stimulated a biopsy. Rejection was found in 51 (42%) patients in the dnDSA+ group, the majority of whom underwent biopsy for increased enzymes not dnDSA, and 84(20%) in the dnDSA-group had rejection (p<0.001). There was a total of 44(36%) graft failures in the dnDSA+ group and 72 (17%) in the dnDSA-group(p<0.001), and a similar trend was seen in death-censored graft survival between the groups. Graft survival did not differ between patients with persistent dnDSA and those with transient dnDSA. Conclusion: Our fi ndings suggest that dnDSA in pancreas transplant recipients are associated with increased rates of rejection and graft failure. Timely detection of dnDSA through regular screening and early treatment of pancreas rejection may ultimately improve graft outcomes.CITATION INFORMATION: Parajuli S., Alagusundaramoorthy S., Aziz F., Garg N., Redfi eld R., Sollinger H., Kaufman D., Djamali A., Odorico J., Mandelbrot D.

J. Adler, R. Redfi eld, D. Kaufman, J. Odorico, H. Sollinger. Surgery, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.INTRODUCTION:In the early experience of pancreas transplantation, bladder drainage was favored. However, this often caused metabolic and infectious complications that necessitated conversion to enteric drainage. Long-term graft survival and complications after enteric conversion of bladder drained pancreases is poorly understood. METHODS: The University of Wisconsin allograft database was queried for all pancreas transplants performed from 1994 to 2015. Time to conversion was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier technique, while risk factors associated with conversion were estimated via a time-varying Cox proportional hazards model to account for the time that the pancreas was bladder drained. RESULTS: Of 117 bladder drained pancreata, 63 (53.8%) eventually required enteric conversion. 29 (46.0%) occurred within the fi rst year after transplantation. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed relatively similar graft survival",

C. Ward, G. Faleo, G. Nair, Q. Duh, M. Hebrok, W. Chang, P. Stock, Q. Tang. UCSF, San Francisco, CA. : Islet transplantation can cure type 1 diabetes; however, multiple donors are needed due to extensive perioperative loss of islets away from their native blood supply. In comparison, parathyroid gland (PTG) autotransplantation in the subcutaneous (SQ) and intra-muscular (IM) sites is an established surgical procedure. In this study, we aim to exploit the neoangiogenic and paracrine hormonal factors made by PTG for preservation of mature islet and stem cell grafts. Methods: Luciferase-expressing mouse islets (B6.MIP-Luc), Stem-Cell-derived Insulin-Producing Cell (SCIPC.Luc) and enhanced Beta Cell (eBC.Luc) grafts were co-transplanted with PTG in SQ and IM. PTG derived CD34+ cells were FACS purifi ed. Mice were made diabetic with STZ. Results: Co-transplantation of PTG with mouse islets, SCIPC's and eBC's in the SQ and IM resulted in preservation of graft mass in comparison to signifi cant graft loss when transplanted alone (",

Skin allograft survival (mean \u00b1 SD) was 9.5 \u00b1 0.55 days on WT mice, 14.2 \u00b1 1.17 days on mTOR cKO mice, 15.5 \u00b1 0.55 days on STAT3 cKO mice, and 17.0 \u00b1 0.89 days on mTOR/STAT3 cKO mice.

Strikingly, all donor skin-sensitized mTOR/STAT3 cKO recipients permanently accepted the heart allografts (all > 100 days). Therefore, ablation of either mTOR or STAT3 in T cells prolongs the heart allograft survival in donor skin-sensitized mice, whereas ablation of both mTOR and STAT3 in T cells induces heart transplant acceptance in donor skin-sensitized mice. Taken together, mTOR should not be simply considered as a negative regulator for memory T cell differentiation. Targeting both mTOR and STAT3 pathways may have a great therapeutic potential to eliminate allogeneic memory T cell response.CITATION INFORMATION: Xie A., Chen W.

Department of Surgery, Emory University, Atlanta, GA. blockade (CoB) is a promising strategy for more targeted/less toxic transplant immunosuppression which has led to the fi rst improvement in long-term outcomes for transplant patients in over 30 years. Increased rates of acute rejection have tempered enthusiasm for wider adoption of CoB. Type 1 interferons (IFN) induce an antiviral state in host tissues and augment the adaptive immune response. We investigated the role of Type 1 IFN in costimulation independent rejection. In a stringent model of fully MHCmismatched skin transplantation from Balb/C (H2 d ) donors to C57BL/6 (H2 b ) recipients, untreated mice rejected rapidly (MST=11 days). CoB treatment (250 ug CTLA4-Ig [BMS, Princeton NJ) + 250 ug Anti-CD40L (MR1, BioXCell, Lebanon NH) given by IP injection day 0, 2, 4, 6) improved survival but resulted in CoB-inedependent rejection (MST=23 d). Independent rejection and signifi cantly prolonged survival (MST>60d). We next asked if this survival benefi t was dependent on intragraft activity of IFNAR utilizing IFNAR -/mice as recipients of Balb/C (IFNAR +/+ ) grafts. IFNAR1-/mice treated with CoB and WT mice treated with CoB+aIFNAR1 demonstrated similar graft survival benefi t (MST>60d). At day 10 post-transplant, both adjuvant aIFNAR1 blockade, and genetic deletion of IFNAR in recipient mice resulted in a signifi cant reduction in the frequency of activated CD8+CD44+ and CD4+CD44+ T cells.These data suggest that IFNAR1 signaling augments the alloimmune response and supports costimulation independent rejection.CITATION INFORMATION: Mathews D., Ghosh A., Dong Y., Polireddy K., Stephenson A., Breeden C., Liu Y., Adams A.

Immunosuppressed individuals are at risk for multiple virus infections simultaneously. Current clinical practice is to use separate urine/blood samples for detection of each virus individually. A single assay that detects the entire urine virome as well as allograft damage would be of value.Methods: cfDND was extracted from 1ml urine supernatants collected at time of BKVN biopsy (n=24) and in a control cohort, 10 stable KTx with normal histology + 27 with UTI (no biopsy), and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq platform using single-stranded library preparation. Sequences reads were aligned with the human reference genome UCSC hg19 and the unaligned reads were extracted and mapped to viral reference genomes. cfDNA donor fraction (DF) was used in gender-mismatched recipients to assess graft damage. Results: Urine cfDNA detected viral copies in 100% of BKVN patients, in 50% with stable function and 22% with UTIs (Fig1).Multiple viral genomes were more frequent in BKVN (33%) vs. non-BKVN (7.4%) cohort. Presence of BKV sequences correlated with BKVN (P<0.001) & relative genomic abundance of BKV correlated with absolute copies of BKV VP1 mRNA levels (r s =0.72;P<0.001). DF was higher in BKVN compared to control cohort (Fig2). DF positively correlated with same day creatinine levels (r s =0.37;P=0.04).Conclusion: Our data demonstrate the feasibility & utility of cfDNA to measure urine virome comprehensively. Our novel assay offers a noninvasive measure of viral burden and allograft damage. Future studies will apply this novel technology to monitor KTx recipients & personalize management.

In this prospective study we aimed to risk-stratify patients with early post-transplant DSA to allow timely identifi cation of individuals at risk for poor clinical outcomes. Patients were screened for DSA at0,1,3,6,9 &12mo  and analyzed in relation to protocol biopsies at 3 and 12mos and any for-cause biopsies within the fi rst year. IS was with Thymo and MPA+TAC. 67/294 (22.8%) of patients transplanted(1/2013-11/2014) developed DSA. DSA was detected early (<3mo) in 76% of the patients. DSA was associated with signifi cantly increased rates of subclinical and clinical TCMR (58%) compared to patients lacking DSA (33%, %; p<0.0001). Importantly, patients with DSA+TCMR had signifi cantly worse chronic allograft changes (1yr protocol Bx) and increased graft loss or impending graft loss (eGRF<30ml/min and >30% fall from baseline) at 4yrs compared to those with DSA or TCMR alone(Fig1A). Thus, DSA+TCMR identifi es high-risk patients, in whom early identifi cation would allow pre-emptive intervention. Based on prior fi ndings, we asked whether cytokine expression by peripheral blood B cell subsets could predict TCMR in patients with DSA. 43/67 DSA+ patients had their B cell cytokines analyzed at 3mo. Of markers analyzed, the ratio of IL-10/TNF\u03b1 expression by T1 transitional B cells was signifi cantly lower in patients with DSA+TCMR compared to those with DSA alone (ratio: 0.94 vs. 4.9, p<0.0001).

Recipients with high HO-1 expression (n=25) were associated with decreased serum ALT levels at POD1 (255\u00b134 vs 809\u00b1367 IU/L, p=0.0373), superior post-transplant survival (2-year: 92.6% vs 80.7%), lower frequency of early graft dysfunction (3.8% vs 8.0%) and post-OLT rejection episodes (3.8% vs 16.0%) as compared to those with low HO-1 levels (n=26). In a mouse OLT model, bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs, 5\u00d710 6 ) transfected with Ad-HO-1 or Ad-\u03b2-gal (2.5\u00d710 9 pfu) were infused directly into liver grafts via portal vein immediately prior to reperfusion. Adoptive transfer of HO-1 overexpressing BMM was accompanied by attenuated OLT damage as evidenced by serum ALT levels and Suzuki's histological grading of IRI (p<0.05). HO-1 overexpressed macrophage treatment decreased Ly6G+ cell traffi cking and frequency of TUNEL+ cells (p<0.05) in OLT, while increased hepatic SIRT1/ LC3B expression, Moreover, adjunctive pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 in HO-1 overexpressing OLT diminished hepatoprotection and autophagy induction.In conclusion, our translational study confi rms the clinical relevance of HO-1 cytoprotection and identifi es SIRT1-mediated autophagy pathway as a new and essential regulator of HO-1 function in IR-stressed OLT.

Wood.1 1 Nuffi eld Department of Surgical  Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; 2 Garvan  Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia; 3 Toronto General  Hospital Research Institute, Toronto, Canada.   importance of B regulatory cells (Breg)  in both health and disease has rapidly become evident over the last decade. Breg are able to control immune responses in animal models of transplantation, and human Breg have been identifi ed in tolerant, kidney transplant recipients. Excessive regulation by Breg may contribute to the development of carcinoma and severe infection. Despite the successful expansion of mouse Breg, the rarity of human Breg in peripheral blood and diffi culties with characterisation mean that in vivo investigation and the potential for human Breg as a clinical therapy in transplantation remain elusive. We report, for the fi rst time, ex vivo expansion of human B cells with in vivo regulatory function (expBreg). expBreg were able to signifi cantly prolong human allograft survival in a humanized mouse model of skin transplantation, and were associated with an increase in percentage of human CD4 + CD25 + CD127 lo Treg within the allograft. expBreg expressed a phenotype associated with endogenous human Breg in peripheral blood, CD19 + CD73 -CD25 + CD71 + , and were TIM-1 + . We characterize a novel mechanism by which TIM-1 regulates downstream STAT3 signaling within expBreg cells, thus modulating suppressive function. In vitro, expBreg could also induce and expand potently suppressive CD4 + CD25 + CD127 lo Treg in a TIM-1-dependent manner. Furthermore, a signifi cant increase in CD19 + CD73 -CD25 + CD71 + TIM-1 + B cells was identifi ed in peripheral blood of human subjects with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, unlike other human Breg subsets, when compared to healthy controls. Human CD19 + CD73 -CD25 + CD71 + TIM-1 + B cells with regulatory function can be generated ex vivo and can prolong graft survival in a complex, biological environment. This potent suppressor population may represent a novel cellular therapy that could be used alone or as an adjunct to other immunosuppressive regimens to prolong allograft survival in transplantation. Moreover, targeting human Breg may offer new opportunities for reactivating the immune response in patients with cancer.CITATION INFORMATION: Shankar S., Stolp J., Juvet S., Hester J., Wood K.

J. Cwykiel, G. Rafi di, M. Siemionow. Orthopaedics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL. :Various stem cell-based therapies have been proposed as supportive treatments for patients following solid organ and vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) to achieve donor-specifi c tolerance and eliminate the toxic, systemic, life-long, multi-drug immunosuppression. We introduce a novel cellular therapy of ex vivo created umbilical cord blood derived multi-chimeric cells (mCC) as an alternative approach to bone marrow based therapies in support of VCA. The aim of this study was to establish the ex vivo fusion protocol and characterize in vitro the phenotype, genotype, viability and proliferative potential of fused human mCC. Methods: Twenty-two ex vivo fusions of human umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells were performed. Mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated from UCB originating from three unrelated donors. Next, MNC were stained separately by PKH26, PKH67 and eFluor670 proliferation dye and fused using polyethylene glycol (PEG). Triple PKH26/PKH67/eFluor670 stained mCC were sorted and assessed by confocal microscopy and fl ow cytometry for the effi cacy of the cell fusion procedure. The viability of mCC (Trypan blue and LIVE/DEAD cell viability assay) and distribution of hematopoietic surface markers (CD4, CD8, CD19, CD45 and CD90) were performed by fl ow cytometry. PCR-rSSOP (Antigens: A, B, C, Bw, DRB1, DQB1, DR51, DR52 and DR53), and STR-PCR (Loci: TH01, D21S11, D5S818, D13S317, D7S820, D16S539, vWA, TPOX) characterized the genotype of mCC. Proliferative potential of mCC was assessed by colony forming unit (CFU) assay. Results: Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analysis confi rmed UCB fusion and creation of human mCC. Using PCR-rSSOP and STR-PCR assays, we determined that human mCC are sharing HLA class I and class II antigens, as well as selected loci specifi c for all three UCB donors used for fusion. After fusion 90-95% of cells were viable. Phenotype characterization showed similar percentage and pattern of hematopoietic markers distribution on the surface of mCC and UCB donors. Maintenance of proliferative properties of mCC was confi rmed by CFU assay. Conclusions: We have successfully confi rmed the feasibility of ex vivo fusion procedure and creation of human mCC. We characterized the phenotype, genotype, viability and proliferative potential of mCC. This unique concept of mCC introduces a novel universal therapy for tolerance induction in solid organ and VCA transplantation.CITATION INFORMATION: Cwykiel J., Rafi di G., Siemionow M.

Wiggins.University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; University of Kansas, Kansas City. : Both indication and 10-yr surveillance biopsy data point to the important role of progressive glomerular disease in intermediate and longterm allograft outcomes. As all kidney transplants have podocyte detachment rates above native kidney controls (PMID:25388223) we looked for potential superimposed accelerators of this process. Given the association of DSA's with transplant glomerulopathy (TG) we fi rst investigated the impact of circulating DSA's on allograft function and podocyte loss. Methods: Urine pellet podocyte mRNA markers were analyzed in 57 kidney allograft recipients who had >1 urine sample collected (mean 4.7\u00b12.6 years post transplant, range 2-15 urine samples per allograft) at greater than 1-year posttransplant. Clinical data was collected from patient charts. A tertile analysis was done by allograft loss of function. Results: Urinary podocyte detachment rate (Urine Podocin mRNA to Creatininine ratio, UPodCR) was signifi cantly elevated with a trend towards increased DSA+ve among allografts that were losing function (upper table). In a separate analysis, the rate of podocyte detachment was signifi cantly elevated among patients with circulating DSA's (lower table). 3 patients had missing eGFR data. of GFR decline analyzed by tertiles for urine samples collected >1 year post TP Conclusion: Recipients with circulating DSA's were more likely to have accelerated podocyte detachment and allograft loss of function.

Role of C1q-Binding Donor-Specifi c Anti-HLA Antibodies in Premature and Accelerated Kidney Allograft Interstitial Fibrosis. K. Louis, D. Viglietti, O. Aubert, A. Loupy, C. Lefaucheur. Paris Translational Research Center for Organ Transplantation, Paris, France. 2017 Banff meeting has focused on the importance of a precise diagnosis of IF/TA in kidney recipients by addressing specifi c etiological factors. Recent studies showed a signifi cant contribution of alloimmune factors (both T cell-and antibody-mediated process) to the development of IF/TA. This study investigated the role of anti-HLA DSAs and their characteristics in the progression of IF/TA. We prospectively included 1004 kidney recipients transplanted between 2004 and 2010, with systematic assessment of injury phenotype and IF/TA Banff score on allograft biopsies performed at 1 year after transplantation. All patients were assessed for DSAs and their characteristics (HLA class, de novo status, MFI, C1q binding) at 6 months post-transplant. Patients were followed up to 8 years and we integrated all for cause biopsies performed beyond 1 year (N=539) to assess IF/ TA progression. We identifi ed 416 (41%) patients with IF/TA0 score, 278 (28%) patients with IF/ TA1 score, 165 (16%) patients with IF/TA2 score and 145 (15%) patients with IF/TA3 score. The prevalence of DSAs increased with IF/TA severity: 79/416 (19%) in IF/TA0 patients, 67/278 (24%) in IF/TA1 patients, 47/165 (28%) in IF/ TA2 patients and 52/145 (36%) in IF/TA3 patients. DSA MFI was positively correlated with IF/TA severity (rho=0.21, p=0.001), with MFI of 3543\u00b13167 in IF/TA0 patients, 4093\u00b14779 in IF/TA1 patients, 5071\u00b15391 in IF/TA2 patients and 7816\u00b16222 in IF/TA3 patients. C1q-binding DSA prevalence also increased with IF/TA severity: 14/416 (3%) in IF/TA0 patients, 13/278 (5%) in IF/TA1 patients, 17/165 (10%) in IF/TA2 patients and 24/145 (17%) in IF/TA3 patients (p<0.001). Among all DSA characteristics, C1q binding was the most important one to predict the severity of IF/TA in random forest analysis (mean decrease in accuracy: 22%). Patients with C1q-binding DSA had a higher IF/TA score at 1 year post-transplant compared to patients with non-C1q-binding DSA (1.8\u00b11.2 vs. 1.1\u00b11.1, p<0.001), increased microvascular infl ammation (p<0.001) and C4d deposition in peritubular capillaries (p<0.001), and they exhibited accelerated progression of IF/TA (p=0.02) beyond 1 year post-transplant. C1q-binding anti-HLA DSAs are associated with premature and accelerated kidney allograft fi brosis, with a biological gradient between DSA C1q-binding ability and fi brosis severity, suggesting a causal effect of DSA in an alloimmune subtype of fi brosis.

K. Phonphok, T. Duong, S. Panombualert, S. Bunnapradist. Medicine-Nephrology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA. : With the prioritization of age \u2264 18 years old at the time of registration on the kidney transplant waiting list in the United States, deceased donor rates have increased. Majority of these patients require subsequent transplantation at a later time. Previous transplant has shown an impact on posttransplant outcomes. We hypothesized that recipients of those previous pediatric deceased donor kidney transplant (DDKT) would have worse posttransplant outcomes after the second KT than those after living donor KT (LDKT). Materials and Methods: We used data from the Organ Procurement Transplant Network (OPTN/UNOS) as of December 8, 2016. A retrospective cohort analysis was created to examine the outcome of 1,930 recipients being second-time kidney transplanted at age 18-30 from January 1, 2000, to September 30, 2015, with previous KT at age less than 18. Those with more than two kidney transplant episodes or multiorgan transplant were excluded. Patients were divided into two groups according to donor type of the fi rst pediatric KT; 1) those with failed DDKT and 2) those with failed LDKT. Results: Recipients of the fi rst LDKT group were more likely to be Caucasian and have subsequent LDKT compared to the fi rst DDKT group. (Table1) We found an increase in median time to second KT since fi rst graft failure and second registration in recipients with previous pediatric DDKT. The median PRA was higher in those with failed DDKT as well as higher number of patients with high PRA (>80%) and very high PRA (\u226598%).(Table2) Looking at the outcome after the second KT, rejection rate, graft survival of the fi rst DDKT group were similar to the fi rst LDKT group, however, recipients of previous LDKT were more likely to have better GFR at 3 years after the second KT. (Table3) Conclusions: Recipients with previously failed pediatric DDKT had higher PRA and longer waiting time before re-transplantation. However, kidney allograft outcomes after the second KT were comparable. It would be preferable to perform LDKT as the fi rst kidney transplant in childhood and adolescence to minimize their waiting times in the future.CITATION INFORMATION: Phonphok K., Duong T., Panombualert S., Bunnapradist S.

Since 2000, we have introduced robotic living donor nephrectomy (RLDN) in our clinical practice which is characterized by high prevalence of obesity. 1038 RLDNs were reviewed retrospectively, from 2000 to 2016 in our Center.Donors were divided into 4 groups according to their BMI: <25 (group1-23.5%); 25-29.9 (group2-35.6%); 30-34.9 (group3-26.2%) and \u226535 (group4-14.6%). Mean donor BMI was 29.32\u00b15.98 with a predominance of male living related donors. 40.8% were morbidly obese(BMI>30). The majority underwent left nephrectomy (95%); multiple arteries were present in 24 cases (2%). Mean surgical time was 164\u00b140 min with a warm ischemia time of 172\u00b192 sec. On average the hospitalization was 2.8 days.",

While hyperacute rejections are not an issue, antibody effects on longterm outcomes are not well characterized. In this study, we evaluated the impact of HLA antibodies and positive crossmatches (XM) in a cohort of adult live donor liver transplant (LDLT) recipients. Methods: All LDLT recipients transplanted between 8/2002 and 10/2017 were included. HLA antibody screens and donor-recipient cytotoxic XMs were performed on all recipients. Positive XMs were diluted; patients with titers >1:8 were treated with plasmapheresis (PP) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg); those with lower titers received IVIg alone. XMs were repeated after treatment and if still positive, PP and IVIg were repeated. Results: A total of 232 LDLT recipients were evaluated. Males predominated (m=161, f=71) and mean age at transplant = 52.1 (range 19-73 years). 51 patients had positive 41.2%, p=0.021). 42.2% of total female cohort demonstrated antibodies versus 13.1% of males (p<0.001).

Horslen. 4 1 Duke Univ, Durham; 2 Mt Sinai Hosp, NY; 3 Henry Ford Hosp, Detroit; 4 Seattle Children's Hosp, Seattle; 5 Temple Univ, Philadelphia. Intestinal transplantation (IT) is uncommon compared to other organ transplants. We examined the temporal and geographical trends of centers that perform IT in the USA We obtained information about IT centers from the OPTN and analyzed it by era and age of recipients. The analysis was divided into 3 periods: 1)1990-1999, 2)2000-2009, 3)2010-September 2017. The country was divided into census (West, Midwest, Northeast, South) and UNOS regions. High volume(HV) centers were those performing an average of 10 or more IT per year. Pediatric patients were those <18 years old In 1990, 2 UNOS regions had active IT centers: 2 and 8. HV centers were: 1 during period 1 (UNOS region 3), 6 during period 2 (regions 2, 3, 8, 10), 5 during period 3 (regions 2, 3, 8, 9, 10). Pediatric patients accounted for 65.3% of 398 IT performed during period 1, 56.3% of 1485 IT in period 2 and 40.7% of 1013 IT in period 3. Centers doing at least 1 IT in any given year remained relatively constant in number during the 3 periods. The Midwest had the greater stability in number of centers doing an IT in any given year, as have UNOS regions 1, 3, 7, 9. The number of centers doing IT every year almost doubled from period 1 to 2 and since then has remained relatively stable. The location of these centers has remained stable with UNOS regions 2 and 10 currently accounting for 53.8% of BACKGROUND: Although HLA matching improves graft survival in kidney transplant recipients (KTx), eplet mismatches provide higher resolution information, and could better predict the development of donor specifi c antibodies (DSA). Currently, limited prospective data exist on the association between eplet mismatch and DSA. AIM: To assess the relationship between eplet mismatch and DSA.",

Where possible, high resolution (4-digit) donor and recipient typing was entered into HLA Matchmaker to calculate the number of eplet mismatches. Where high resolution typing was not available, the HLA Matchmaker Converter program was used to convert 2-digit typing to 4-digit typing prior to calculation of mismatches. All patients were prospectively screened for DSA pretransplant and at 3 and 12 months post-transplant. The association between eplet mismatch, DSA and clinical outcomes was assessed using multivariable analysis. RESULTS: Of 313 patients transplanted during the study period, high resolution typing or conversion was completed for 202 recipients, 253 donors and 166 donor-recipient pairs. Conversion of low to high resolution typing was limited by the absence of ethnicity (n=83) or haplotype (n=64) data in the Converter database for 147 patients (47%). Of the 166 pairs with eplet mismatch data, DSA screening was complete for 150 patients. There was a mean of 14 (SD 7.7) Class I and 17 (SD 11.8) Class II eplet mismatches per patient (Table 1) . 64 patients (43%) had pretransplant DSA (preDSA), 30 (20%) had de novo DSA (dnDSA) and 17 (11%) had both pre-and dnDSA. The number of HLA-A, B, C and DR eplet mismatches was associated with detection of preDSA (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.07; P=0.007), however there was no association between HLA-DQ eplet mismatches and preDSA. There was no association between eplet mismatches and dnDSA. CONCLUSION: Calculated HLA-A, B, C and DR eplet mismatches were associated with pretransplant DSA but not dnDSA. Backround: Kidney transplantation confers a signifi cant survival benefi t to its recipients. Our objective was to reassess this survival benefi t in light of improving outcomes on dialysis and the stagnant long-term survival after kidney transplantation. Methods: We studied a cohort of 768,214 candidates listed in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network for kidney transplantation between 1987 and 2016; 372,876 of the candidates (49%) were transplanted. We divided the study period in to approximately four year cohorts. Kaplan-Meier and Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used. We also used competing risk analysis to confi rm our waitlist analysis. Results: Waitlist survival for kidney transplantation has improved steadily over the study period. 5-year survival on the waiting list was 53. 8% in 1988, 50.3% in 2000, and 78.3% in 2012 (p<0.001 ",

We aimed to explore the differences between early and lateonset PVN with regard to histological fi ndings and graft survival. Methods: Indications and follow-up biopsies of 71 patients with PVN were reevaluated and examined for development of interstitial fi brosis (IF). Interstitial plasma cells, neutrophils, CD3, CD4, CD8, HLA-DR positive cells, and macrophages were graded. Patients were separated into 4 groups based on time of development of PVN after RT [Group A: <12mo (n=35), Group B: 12-24mo (n=13), Group C: 24-48mo (n=15), Group D: >48mo (n=8)]. Also, they were correlated in 2 groups: Group 1 (n=48) early PVN (\u226412mo) and Group 2 (n=23) late PVN (>12mo) Results: The mean interval between the diagnosis of PVN and RT was 17\u00b122 months. Group 1 had higher mean hemodialysis (HD) time before RT (p<.05). CMV viremia was also found in 27 patients. The mean viral load in urine and plasma at diagnosis was higher in Group 1 (p<.01).Group 1 showed lower stages and higher degrees of polyoma viral load (Pvl) in biopsy (p<.05). Viral load in urine, plasma, and biopsy increased from Group A to D. Group 1 showed higher degrees of interstitial neutrophil, plasma, macrophage, lymphocyte, DR-positive cell infi ltration and lower degrees of the CD4/CD8 ratio (p<.01). All infl ammatory cell types increased from Group A to D. Interstitial CD4/CD8 ratio showed a signifi cant negative correlation with Pvl (r=-0.320, p=.01), viremia (r=-0.602, p<.001) and viruria (r=-0.748, p<.001) . 43 patients (60.6%) developed IF during follow-up, and 31 (43.7%) lost their graft 18\u00b114mo after PVN. The risk of development of IF increased from Group A to D (p<.01).Compared to Group 2 (28.7\u00b116mo), mean time of graft loss after PVN was earlier in Group 1 (13.3\u00b19mo ). The mean time of graft loss also decreased from group A to D (p<.05). Positive correlation was found between graft loss and CD4/CD8 ratio (r=0.391, p<.05).",

Ferraresso. 1 1 Kidney Transplantation, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Milan, Italy; 2 Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy; 3 Nephrology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Milan, Italy. Background. Human Polyomaviruses (HPyVs) are able to establish latent infection in the kidney of the host. Immunosuppression is recognized risk factor for HPyVs reactivation. Besides the well studied BK virus (BKPyV), JC virus (JCPyV), Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV), and HPyV9 have been also detected in kidney transplant (KTx) recipients. Origin and natural history of these HPyVs remain unclear. Methods. Urine, blood, and kidney samples from 39 donor-recipient pairs were collected immediately before and periodically (from 1 to 180 days) after KTx. Samples were tested for BKPyV, JCPyV, MCPyV, HPyV7, and HPyV9 genome using Real Time PCR and automatic sequencing to defi ne viral genotypes and rearrangements. Results. No HPyVs viremia was observed whereas HPyVs viruria was detected in 21/39 (54%) donors and 24/39 (61.5%) recipients. Overall, 14/39 (36%) donor-recipient pairs were positive for HPyVs. JCPyV DNA was detected in 13/39 (33%) donor-recipient pairs with both donors and recipients positive for identical JCPyV strains. JCPyV was consistently positive in the urine of the recipients at any time point of the study. BKPyV was detected in 2 donors and sporadically in 5 recipients (1 donor-recipient pair). MCPyV was detected in 2 donors and sporadically in 10 recipients (1 donor-recipient pair) . Median time from KTx to fi rst viruria for JCPyV, BKPyV, and MCPyV was 1 (range 1-301), 76 (range 24-180), and 14 (range 1-267) days post KTx, respectively. Two cases of concomitant JCPyV and BKPyV, and 1 case of concomitant JCPyV and MCPyV infections were observed. No relationships between HPyVs replication and KTx outcomes were identifi ed during the follow up. Conclusions. Our data confi rm that JCPyV replication is frequently observed in organ donors. They also show that JCPyV replication in KTx recipients generally occurs very early. Moreover, post transplant JCPyV infections are due to viral strains transmitted by the donor. Post KTx BKPyV and MCPyV replication is less frequent, mostly occurs at a later stage, and it is likely due to viral reactivation of recipient's strains or new infections. Extended follow up is needed to rule out clinical impact of early JCPyV infection after KTx.

Methods: 57 consecutive DCD LTs were performed using this protocol (Era II).Outcomes were compared with 61 historic controls (Era I) and 1619 donation after brain death (DBD) donor LT. Expanded criteria donor (ECD) DCD livers were defi ned as those with one of the following factors: 1) donor age > 55 years, 2) donor BMI > 35, 4) donor functional warm ischemia time (fWIT) > 30 minutes, and 5) donor liver macrosteatosis >30%.Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients. CMV establishes latency for the host's lifetime and frequently reactivates. Immunosuppression, while protecting the graft from rejection, impairs immune responses to CMV. We previously found that the frequency of CD8 T cells producing cytokine in response to CMV increased over the fi rst year after transplantation in CMV seropositive (CMV+) heart and kidney recipients in the absence of detected viremia, likely as a result of subclinical reactivation. These T cells may not be protective, as CMV is known to induce expansion of dysfunctional T cells with age in non-immunosuppressed populations.Methods: Blood was obtained from healthy volunteers and from heart and kidney transplant recipients pre and up to a year post transplant. Patients received standard of care treatment, including anti-viral prophylaxis and immunosuppression (steroid, calcineurin inhibitor, and anti-metabolite). Kidney recipients also received T cell depleting induction therapy with rabbit ATG. Blood mononuclear cells were cryopreserved for analysis. Here we analyze T cell receptors (TCR) and functions in T cells that secrete IFN\u0263 in response to CMV peptide antigen using a novel approach coupling paired single cell TCR sequencing to gene expression analysis. Background: Deceased-donor kidney discard rates remain high. Ineffi ciencies in the allocation of hard-to-place kidneys may be contributing to discard suggesting that system-level factors represent opportunities to improve placement. Methods:We analyzed DonorNet\u00ae data of consecutive deceased-donor non-mandatory share primary kidney-only offers to adult candidates at our center and beyond between July 1, 2015 and March 31, 2016 to identify system-level risk factors of discard independent of donor quality. Discard was defi ned as non-transplantation at our or subsequent transplant centers. Exclusions were HCV/HBV (n=14), blood type AB (n=20), and donor< 1 year (n=25) based on low candidate waitlist size. Results: Of 456 individual kidney offers, from 296 donors, 73% were discarded. Most were national (93%) offers from KDPI 35-85% (n=233) or > 85% (n=208). Each system-level factor was separately entered into the multivariate model containing donor-level factors and those that remained signifi cant independent factors associated with discard were increasing offer cold ischemia time ( Objectives: Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is underutilized in high MELD patients. Our aim was to assess the impact of high MELD score on shortterm post-transplant outcomes in LDLT recipients at our center. Methods: A total of 352 adult LDLT's were performed from 1999 to present and review of outcomes was analyzed retrospectively. Patients were grouped into low MELD<25 and high MELD \u226525 score to compare short-term outcomes.",

There were no signifi cant differences between the 2 groups with regards to demographics including age, gender, etiology of liver disease, BMI or incidence of HCC. The right lobe was the most commonly used graft in both groups, but the middle hepatic vein was included more commonly in the graft when it was utilized in high MELD patients. To study Treg-LT\u03b2R engagement, we developed and characterized an in vivo conditional, regulatable knockout of the LT\u03b2R. Methods:LT\u03b2R fl /fl mice were crossed with Prox1-Cre-ER T2 transgenic mice to generate Prox1-Cre-ER T2+/-LT\u03b2R fl /fl mice, in which LT\u03b2R is depleted in LEC by tamoxifen treatment. The effects of LT\u03b2R depletion on Treg lymphatic migration and migration related molecules were analyzed by fl ow cytometry and histology. Results: In Cre-Lox mice, LT\u03b2R expression by LEC was markedly reduced by 10 days after tamoxifen treatment, while blood vessel endothelial cells and fi broblastic reticular cells (FRC) maintained expression. LT\u03b2R depletion did not affect stromal cell or leukocyte cell counts or percentages in primary or secondary lymphoid organs, suggesting normal immune system homeostasis. Histologic analysis of LN did not show signifi cant differences in the overall architecture, cortical or medullary organization, B and T cell zone segregation, dendritic or plasmacytoid dendritic cell distribution, or the structure of the FRC network. Depletion of LT\u03b2R did lead, however, to a marked reduction in the accumulation of Foxp3+ Treg and the expression of CCL21 in the LN. CCL21 is a ligand for CCR7, and the major chemokine important for T cell migration to LV and LN. In vitro stimulation assays showed that both LT\u03b2R and Treg directly regulated CCL21 expression and secretion by LEC, confi rming that Treg-LT\u03b2R-LEC interactions are specifi c and physiologically important. LT\u03b2R depletion also reduced LEC expression of non-canonical NF\u03baB kinase (NIK) and the infl ammatory and chemotactic lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P Indeed, the suppressive effects of OX40 in iTreg induction can be completely abrogated by targeting the Batf3/Batf and the Akt-mTOR pathway. We also examined whether OX40 costimulation inhibits allogeneic iTreg generation in vivo through Batf proteins and the mTOR pathway in a donor-specifi c cell transfer model, we adoptively transferred CD45.2 + Wt and Batf -/-Batf3 -/na\u00efve CD4 T cells into CD45.1 + OX40L-Tg mice; some host mice were also injected with allogeneic Balb/c splenocyes and treated with rapamycin for 4 days, and then examined the induction of Foxp3+ T cells within the CD45.2+ fraction. The frequency of induced Foxp3+ T cells from Batf3 -/-Batf -/-CD4+ T cells following rapamycin treatment in the lymph nodes and the lungs in the OX40L-Tg hosts was signifi cantly higher than those of other groups. Thus, our data uncover new mechanistic insights into OX40-mediated suppression of allogeneic Foxp3 + iTregs, and these fi ndings may have important clinical implications in tolerance induction.

At the time of organ procurement, 9 of 10 donors tested positive for HCV by nucleic acid testing (NAT); one donor was HCV antibody-positive but NAT-negative. All recipients acquired HCV infection from the infected donor and were treated post-transplant with DAA-based regimens, with a median time from transplant to treatment of 47 days (IQR 32-63). Five (50%) patients have completed antiviral therapy and have achieved sustained virologic response at 4 weeks (SVR-4). There have been no adverse events related to treatment. Conclusion: Transplantation of HCV-viremic organs into non-viremic recipients is well-tolerated and results in acceptable short-term outcomes. All patients initiated DAA-based antiviral therapy within 3 months of transplantation, and all who have completed therapy have achieved SVR-4. In the face of ongoing organ shortage, such strategies may be used to expand the donor pool across organs. BACKGROUND: An increasing number of patients and families are utilizing online crowdfunding to support their medical expenses related to organ transplantation. The factors that infl uence the success of medical crowdfunding campaigns are poorly understood. We analyzed campaign variables to identify those that correlate with fundraising success. METHODS: Medical crowdfunding campaigns were abstracted from a popular crowdfunding website. Campaigns were included if they were actively accepting donations to fund medical expenses related to transplant surgeries of interest (kidney, lung, liver, heart). The primary outcome measures were receipt of any donation and total amount raised among campaigns receiving at least one donation. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed on various campaign characteristics. Text analysis of campaign descriptions for emotional content was also performed.",

            "text": "In total, 850 campaigns were analyzed. Kidney transplant campaigns were the most common type (40.5%), followed by liver (33.3%), lung (12.2%), heart (11.3%), and multi-organ transplants (2.7%). Longer description length (OR 1.15 per 100 characters, p<0.0001) was signifi cantly associated with receipt of any donation. More positive overall sentiment (+2.6% greater amount raised, p=0.0002), longer description length (+2.4% per 100 characters, p=0.0006), and higher goal amount (+0.6%, p=0.0038) were associated with greater amount raised. Campaigns written in fi rst-person perspective (-56.8% lower amount raised vs. third-person, p<0.0001) were associated with lower amount raised. The words \"family,\" \"life,\" and \"time\" were among the most common across all campaign narratives. The most commonly used emotive words included \"support,\" \"care,\" \"failure,\" and \"love.\" CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest quantitative analysis of medical crowdfunding campaigns to date. Campaign success was signifi cantly associated with longer description length, higher goal amount, more positive overall sentiment, and third-person writing perspective. These fi ndings will inform patient and provider discussions around the growing practice of medical crowdfunding. Given ongoing waitlist mortality and the high rates of liver discard in the US we wanted to investigate late declines (LD), and very late declines (VLD) of liver allografts in our OPO to look for correlation with center transplant activity.",

Transplant center activity was obtained from the Scientifi c Registry of Transplant Recipients. We quantifi ed 1) the total # of liver transplants per center, 2) LD per center, 3) VLD per center, and 4) the number of livers each center utilized after a LD by another center. For statistical analysis, Pearson correlations were performed. Results: The number of LD and VLD varied dramatically in our OPO, as did the number of liver allografts utilized after another center's LD (fi gure 1). Some of the centers with the highest number of VLD were not local centers, and only 2 of the VLD were by local centers. Importantly, there is a positive correlation between a center transplant volumes and willingness to utilize a liver after a LD (fi gure 2). High volume centers had a very low rate of LD or VLD per organ transplanted.",

            "text": "LD and VLD result in challenging livers to reallocate, and risk organ discard. Centers with higher volume utilized more liver allografts after LD by another center. Many late LD and VLDs are from non-local centers. In the share 35 era we must be mindful of these challenges to ensure effective sharing and organ discard is minimized. A larger study comparing centers in over performing to centers in underperforming OPOs would be valuable. Background: Quality metrics are used to regulate transplant centers, inform patients, and improve quality of care. Currently graft and patient survival are used to regulate transplant programs. However, it is unclear that these metrics contain optimal incentives for transplant quality and volume. Methods: We surveyed members of the ASTS and AST (n=270) to characterize perceptions about transplant quality metrics. Participants rated alternative metrics on effectiveness for measuring quality of care, amenability to risk adjustment, and predicted effects on volume, 1-year transplant mortality, and waitlist mortality.Results: Respondents rated 1-year patient survival as both the most effective at measuring quality of care (mean score=7.44 on a 10-point scale) and most amenable to risk adjustment (mean score=6.26, Figure 1 ). Patient satisfaction was rated least effective at measuring quality of care (mean score=3.38) and evaluated patient mortality rate was rated least amenable to risk adjustment (mean score=4.45). Over half of respondents (52.5%) believed using 1-year waitlist mortality would decrease 1-year waitlist mortality; however 24.3% of respondents also believed this metric would decrease center volume (Figure 2) . A quarter of respondents (25.5%) believed using 3-year post-transplant graft survival would decrease 1-year transplant mortality, while 24.3% believed this metric would decrease center volume. About one third of respondents (32.4%) believed using organ refusal rate would increase center volume, while 21.2% of respondents believed this metric would increase 1-year transplant mortality. Discussion: Choice of transplant regulatory metrics involve tradeoffs between incentivizing waitlist and post-transplant outcomes. However, many members of the transplant community believe that alternative metrics will not impact quality or volume. (Table) . A two month blinded study with 1 hospital site was conducted. Actual referrals were still made by the on-site team while the Tele-ICU staff also practiced making referrals. Tele-ICU staff successfully identifi ed all patients for whom actual referrals were made. The Tele-ICU team identifi ed potential referrals which were not made by their on-site colleagues.Implementation of the new referral process at 4 hospitals has led to an increase in the number of referrals, an increase in timeliness and an increase in donation. Interviews with hospital staff and OPO coordinators reveal markedly improved satisfaction. Additionally, bedside staff report signifi cant time savings. These encouraging results are embraced by leaders at these hospitals and the OPO. Continued expansion of this strategy is planned. Monocytes distinguish between self and allogeneic non-self and contribute to allograft rejection by generating mature, IL-12+, DCs. The initial trigger of monocyte differentiation to DCs is the binding of SIRPa, a polymorphic marker of non-self on donor cells, to CD47 on recipient monocytes. Here, we show that monocytes primed in vivo with allogeneic cells via the SIRPa-CD47 pathway acquire allospecifi c memory. First, they mount an anamnestic recall response (measured by enhanced DC generation) to grafts from the same but not thirdparty donors. Second, removal of the MHC-disparity between the donor and recipient at the time of recall abrogates the response, indicating that memory specifi city is to the allogeneic MHC. Third, the recall response can be elicited up to 4-7 weeks after initial priming -a duration that is signifi cantly longer than the very short lifespan of a monocyte (1-3 days) . Fourth, acquisition and recall of memory occurs in the complete absence lymphoid cells, indicating the innate nature of monocyte memory. We provide direct evidence that memory is preceded by monocyte proliferation (measured by EdU uptake) and is associated with transcriptional changes in monocytes (measured by RNAseq analysis). Using blocking antibodies to paired immunoglobulin receptor (PIR) molecules present on monocytes, we show that MHC specifi city of memory is mediated by PIR-A receptors that preferentially bind allogeneic MHC molecules. Therefore, the innate alloresponse triggered in monocytes by non-self SIRPa rapidly evolves into an enhanced memory response specifi c to non-self MHC. This novel form of innate memory could have profound effects on allogeneic transplantation by continually generating mature DCs that promote rejection and prevent tolerance. 36) . Initial recipient HCV levels varied from 25 IU/mL to 40 million IU/mL, but all patients' HCV NAT levels declined rapidly after elbasvir/ grazoprevir treatment (Figure) . Two patients were cured (SVR-12); 7 have ontreatment undetectable HCV but have not reached SVR timepoint; SVR data will be available June 2018. Five of 9 recipients had ALT elevations post-transplant that resolved in follow-up. All recipients have good allograft function. Serious adverse events included 1) acute kidney injury from early poor cardiac output and pericardial tamponade; the patient requires dialysis at week 12; 2) another had antibody mediated rejection, required ECMO, had acute kidney injury, but has since had good allograft recovery; and 3) another had cellular rejection responsive to oral steroids. None of these were related to HCV or treatment. ",

Sarwal. 2 1 Sahlgrenska University Hospital, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden; 2 UCSF, San Francisco. Background : In a randomized multicenter trial of 222 renal tx recipients treated with steroid minimization and a tacrolimus, MMF based regimen, a novel gene expression assay, kSORT was evaluated for its accuracy in diagnosing and predicting biopsy confi rmed AR. Methods: Blood samples were drawn at day 0, 10, months 3, 6, 12 and at graft dysfunction, to perform kSORT assay, a customized 17 gene assay, that provides a high risk (HR) or low risk (LR) immune score for acute rejection (AR). Biopsies (bx) were done on all study patients by protocol at engraftment and 12 months post-transplantation and central histology was read by Banff scores. The kSORT assay was run on 633 blood samples obtained from the fi rst 111 enrolled patients who cp,pelted 1 yr followup. 214 blood samples were matched with protocol or indicated biopsies. 31 patients had clinically suspected AR, of which 18 were BPAR and an additional 6 were borderline (BL-AR). RNA was extracted and QPCR for all 17 genes was normalized to 18S; data was profi led using a customized algorithm kSAS. Results: Of the 25 biopsy confi rmed AR episodes, 21 had defi nite kSORT scores and 4 were indeterminate; 18/21 AR had high-risk KSORT scores. 11 AR episodes had prior blood samples collected per protocol in the previous 4 months; 8/11 of the pre-AR samples had high kSORT scores. Of the 163 biopsy matched blood samples without histological AR, 139 had defi nite kSORT scores, and 24 had intedeterminate calls. 132/139 blood samples matched with biopsies without AR, had low-risk kSORT scores. A diagnostic odds ratio was calculated to examine the odds of a (+)kSORT compared to the odds of a (-)kSORT in the confi rmed AR group (dOR=39.3, p=4e-15). To evaluate prediction accuracy, there were 107 patients with samples either before on day 0 of the transplant. kSAS called 8/17 with confi rmed AR high-risk. Of the 63 stable transplants, 61 were predicted to be low-risk. Conclusion: Interim results of the diagnostic accuracy of the kSORT assay in a randomized prospective multicenter trial in renal transplantation, confi rms that the assay has 85.7% sensitivity, 95.0% specifi city, and 97.8% NPV for the noninvasive diagnosis of AR. 73% of AR could have been diagnosed by the kSORT assay days-months prior their current time-line for diagnosis based on the serum creatinine alone, supporting the use of this assay for serial monitoring of rejection risk and proactive immunosuppression customization to alloimmune risk. Figure 1A ), lower CD4 effector memory cells ( Figure 1B ) and lower CD4 PD-CD57+ T cells ( Figure 1C ) were seen in patients with impaired protective immunity prior to and persisting after the infection compared to no event or alloimmune failure.",
