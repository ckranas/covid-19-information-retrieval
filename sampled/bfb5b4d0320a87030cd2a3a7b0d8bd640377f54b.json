However, all dogs were passing larvae and have thus passed at least one prepatent period, hence the infection must be chronic in time at the time of diagnosis. The APP pattern detected in this study is more likely a result of differences in the APP response to a moderate inflammatory stimulus, which is supported by the finding that only 18% (2/11) dogs have more than only moderately increased CRP levels (\u03fe30 mg/L). Further, eosinophilia is a more consistent finding than neutrophilia in experimental studies. Hence, dogs naturally infected with A. vasorum develop a systemic inflammatory response which at the time of diagnosis seem to be a moderate response and the results indicate that the inflammatory response seen after experimental point-inoculations may not fully resemble that seen after naturally-occurring continuous inoculations. The reported prevalence of syndromes or diseases in veterinary medicine is often based on small numbers and highly selected animal populations, e.g. referral hospitals or humane shelters. The predictive value of diagnostic tests used in primary care settings however, is greatly influenced by the prevalence of those diseases they are intended to detect. In addition, determining the prevalence of selected zoonotic diseases among primary care patients is important for public health. Most medical record keeping systems used today in primary care practices are inadequate for disease surveillance. The growth of large corporate primary care veterinary practices with multiple geographic locations and a standardized computerized medical record system provides the data needed to initiate companion animal surveillance programs on a national level, with applicability to both animal and human health.",

These fully computerized medical records contain information on patient demographics, physical examination, laboratory tests, diagnoses, and treatments, all linked by a unique pet ID number and hospital visit code. Patient records of 21,201 dogs and 6,704 cats from 6 hospitals in a southeastern urban center for an 18-month period were studied. Of tests routinely recommended to screen healthy pets, 177 (2.8%) of 6203 heartworm adult antigen tests in dogs were positive. In cats, 23 (1.3%) of 1763 FeLV ELISA tests and 15 (0.9%) of 1757 FIV ELISA tests were positive, and were lower than published seroprevalence rates of 5.3% for FELV and 2.3% for FIV in unowned free-roaming cats in the same geographic area. For diagnostic tests usually administered to sick pets, 85 (35.6%) of 239 canine parvovirus fecal antigen tests were positive while 0 (0%) of 6 heartworm adult antigen tests were positive in cats. The concordance between a positive parvovirus antigen test in dogs and a diagnosis of parvovirus in the medical record was 82.8% (kappa \u03ed 0.63).

Clinical signs were nonspecific and most commonly included fever (5/6 dogs), lethargy (5/6 dogs), and anorexia (5/6 dogs). The most common hematologic and biochemical abnormalities were lymphopenia (6/6 dogs), thrombocytopenia (5/6 dogs), and high serum alkaline phosphatase activity (5/6 dogs). Antibody titers to Ehrlichia canis and Ehrlichia equi were obtained from 4 and 5 dogs, respectively, for which stored sera were available for indirect fluorescent antibody testing. No dog seroreacted to E. canis antigens. All dogs were seropositive for E. equi.

Kittens readily absorb colostral antibodies from FIV-vaccinated queens, and these antibodies interfere with FIV diagnosis past the age of weaning in a majority of kittens. Positive FIV antibody test results may indicate that a cat is infected with FIV, is vaccinated against FIV, and/or has nursed from a vaccinated or infected cat. Currently available antibody-based FIV diagnostic tests cannot distinguish between antibodies induced by infection or vaccination and should be interpreted with caution. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) utilizes the detection of specific nucleic acid sequences for diagnosis of infectious diseases. PCR has been proposed as an alternative to antibody testing to avoid the interference of vaccination with FIV diagnostic testing. The purpose of this study was to determine diagnostic performance of several commercially available FIV PCR tests.",

FIV PCR tests are an alternative to serological tests, but results should be interpreted with caution. Urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by Escherichia coli are common in cats with stable chronic renal failure (CRF), particularly in females. These infections may be clinically inapparent and recur frequently after treatment. Recurrent UTI may contribute to the progression of feline CRF, or cause other health problems, so these infections merit study.

Heparins are naturally occurring glycosaminoglycans, with variations in molecular weight and numbers of sulphur bonds between molecules affecting their activity. Heparin acts by binding with antithrombin III (ATIII) and causing accelerated neutralization of serine proteases XIIa, XIa, and thrombin by ATIII. Heparin can also act on heparin cofactor II (HCII), directly on thrombin, or bind to platelets. Heparin has been utilized in treatment protocols for disseminated intravascular coagulation and its use may be warranted in other diseases associated with thrombosis such as cardiomyopathies, renal disease, immune mediated disease, and peripheral vein thrombosis. Alternate administration routes that have been explored include oral, nebulization, intrapulmonary, and topical. Rat thrombosis models have demonstrated that oral heparins are quickly routed to the endothelium resulting in minimal alterations in coagulation parameters yet detectable reductions in thrombus formation.

The small number of subjects limited the power of this study but oral heparin therapy may have applicability in therapy for animals prone to thromboembolic disease. Further studies involving more subjects are warranted prior to clinical use of oral heparin. Studies are also warranted to investigate the effects of oral heparin at the level of the endothelium in the dog. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are derived from standard heparin (MW 15 000 Daltons) and possess an average molecular weight of 5000 Daltons. In dogs, LMWHs have been shown to have a higher bioavailability, a longer half-life and are less protein-bound as compared to standard heparin. LMWHs exert their anticoagulant activity by binding to antithrombin III and preferentially inhibiting factor X. This preferential inhibition results in inhibition of hemostasis with minimal prolongation of PT and PTT.

The defect occurs in mixed breed and purebred dogs, apparently arising through frequent de novo mutations in the coagulation Factor VIII (FVIII) gene. Affected dogs are readily diagnosed by measuring FVIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C), however these assays do not accurately identify carrier females. Direct mutation detection is difficult, due to FVIII's large size (186 kb) and hemophilia's molecular heterogeneity. Our study tested the feasibility of linkage analyses, using a single intragenic FVIII marker, to enhance the accuracy of carrier detection in different breed-variants of canine Hemophilia A.",

Prospective studies looking at survival time and recurrence of neoplasia will be required to determine if expression of p27 and Ki-67 have a prognostic value in canine mammary tumors. Mycobacterial cell wall-DNA complex (MCC 1 ), a mycobacterial cell wall composition prepared from the non-pathogenic microorganism Mycobacterium phlei, is a bifunctional anticancer agent that induces apoptosis of cancer cells and stimulates cytokine synthesis by immune cells. MCC is currently being evaluated for the treatment of bladder cancer in humans. MCC also induces the synthesis of IFN-\u2425 by canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in a concentration-dependent manner. In the present study, we have determined whether MCC has anticancer activity against two canine osteosarcoma cancer cell lines: D17 cells, isolated from a poodle, and D22 cells, isolated from a collie. MCC, in the concentration range 0.01-100 g/ml, directly inhibited the division of both osteosarcoma cell lines. The IC 50 for D17 cells was 3.9 g/ml and for D22 cells 44.4 g/ml. Inhibition of division was associated with the presence of activated caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), both detected by flow cytometry, and condensed nuclear DNA, determined by Hoescht 33258 staining, all of which are characteristics of cells undergoing apoptosis. MCC was also found to potentiate the antiproliferative activity of the bisphosphonates alendronate and pamidronate against these osteosarcoma cell lines. In conclusion, our results show that MCC exerts growth inhibition and apoptosis-inducing activity against two osteosarcoma cell lines in vitro. MCC may have potential in the treatment of canine osteosarcoma. 1 Isoprostanes are a by-product of the action of reactive oxygen species on arachidonic acid, and are considered to be an accurate marker for oxidative stress in vivo. In the presence of oxidative stress, human B lymphoma cells are unable to undergo apoptosis and instead, die by a form of necrosis. Unlike apoptotic cells which are removed by phagocytosis and thus do not induce an inflammatory reaction, necrotic cells lyse, release their cellular contents into the extracellular space, and induce inflammation. The purpose of this study was to compare the concentrations of 15F 2 -isoprostane, in the urine of clinically healthy control dogs and dogs with newly diagnosed, untreated lymphoma.",

Evidence for the presence of Helicobacter in the equine gastric antrum has recently been shown by PCR amplification of the 16s rRNA, immunohistochemistry of the UreI channel and the UreA subunit of Helicobacter urease, serology, and histology of antral mucosa. Gastric Helicobacter species regulate internal pH via the cytoplasmic enzyme urease. Detection of gastric urease activity is used by several methods to diagnose Helicobacter infection. In humans the 13 C urea blood test (UBdT) provides for simple, accurate assessment of gastric urease activity. In the presence of urease, 13 C-urea is hydrolyzed to ammonia and 13 CO 2 , which is rapidly absorbed across the gastric epithelium. A blood sample is analyzed for 13 C-bicarbonate by gas isotope mass ratio spectrometry and compared to a 13 C international standard. The result is reported as \u232c 13 C over the t 0 baseline (\u232cCOB). Increased \u232cCOB indicates urease activity, and in human beings this is highly correlated with Helicobacter infection. The purpose of this study was to identify equine gastric urease activity using the 13 C-urea blood test (UBdT).",

Peak increases were at t 120 (D\u03e9) and t 60 (D\u03ea). The timing of peak activity and the increased \u232cCOB at t 90 and t 120 suggested that cecal urease activity may affect results. The D\u03e9 protocol was repeated with the 13 C-urea administered directly into the cecum under laparoscopic guidance. RMANOVA showed significantly increased \u232cCOB at all time points, reflecting cecal urease activity. Because the T 50% for fluid phase gastric emptying in the horse is 30-35 minutes, we interpret the significant increase in \u232cCOB in both groups at t 30 and t 60 as demonstrating gastric urease activity. Interference by cecal ureolytic bacteria is likely to be present after 60 minutes. Upon confirmation of Helicobacter as an etiology for equine gastric glandular ulceration, refinement of the 13 C-urea blood test may provide for a useful diagnostic tool in the horse. Endotoxemia is a leading cause of death in the horse and results in major losses to the equine industry annually. Despite its significance, limited therapeutic options are available. Current treatment is largely reliant on supportive care and inhibition of metabolites of the arachidonic acid cascade. Interest in the evaluation of immunomodulator agents as alternative therapeutic options has increased lately with recognition of the importance of various mediators in the inflammatory response. PGG-Glucan, a soluble \u2424-glucan, derived from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is one such agent. It has been evaluated in experimental animals and humans, and shown to decrease the severity of infection in a variety of studies. In vivo pretreatment of mice with PGG-Glucan has been shown to decrease the release of tumor necrosis factor \u2423 (TNF\u2423), and to enhance the release of interferon \u2425 (IFN\u2425), from isolated lymphocytes and monocytes subsequently exposed to endotoxin (LPS), staphylococcal enterotoxin B or toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 ex vivo.",

Twelve horses were divided into treatment and control groups. Treatment horses received PGG-Glucan (1 mg/kg, IV) 24 hours prior to PMBC isolation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by ficoll-hypaque separation and incubated in the presence of LPS. Cell cultures were resuspended and mRNA extracted using a commercial isolation kit at 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed and cytokine mRNA expression for TNF\u2423, interleukin 1\u2424 (IL-1\u2424), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IFN\u2425 determined using real time PCR. Determination of TNF\u2423, IL-1\u2424 and IL-10 expression was performed at 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours while IFN\u2425 expression was determined at 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours. Results were expressed relative to glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase. A significant effect of LPS stimulation over time was seen on TNF\u2423, IL-1\u2424, IL-10 and IFN\u2425 production. No significant difference was observed between the PGG-Glucan treatment group and control group at any time point although a large amount of variance was present and may have masked some potentially beneficial effects. Based on this study, pretreatment with PGG-Glucan at 1 mg/ kg, 24 hours prior to exposure to LPS is unlikely to have a significant effect on equine endotoxemia. Neutrophils have an important role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases. Thus, the mechanism of neutrophil migration into inflamed tissues is a target for anti-inflammatory drug development. Neutrophils are recruited to sites of inflammation by chemoattractant molecules such as leukotriene (LT) B 4 and platelet activating factor (PAF). Chemoattractants induce a polarized phenotype with a leading edge where actin-based membrane protrusions and new substrate attachments are formed and a trailing edge where de-adhesion occurs. However, the signaling mechanism regulating neutrophil polarity is poorly understood. The MAP kinase family member p38 is involved in chemoattractants receptor signaling and neutrophil migration. Our hypothesis is that p38 is an essential regulator of neutrophil polarity during equine neutrophil migration. We first determined whether p38 is activated in chemoattractant-stimulated equine neutrophils. The p38 enzyme is activated by dual phosphorylation on Thr180 and Tyr182. Western blot analyses using a specific antibody that recognized activation-associated phosphorylation demonstrated that LTB 4 and PAF stimulation activated p38 in equine neutrophils within minutes. Treatment of equine neutrophils with the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 abolished LTB 4 -and PAF-induced migration. The IC 50 for inhibition of migration was 2-3 M, comparable to published IC 50 values for inhibition of p38 dependent functions in neutrophils from other species. To begin to determine the role for p38 in the mechanism regulating neutrophil migration, we examined whether p38 was required for polarization and integrin-mediated adhesion. SB203580 treatment abolished LTB 4 -induced equine neutrophil polarization. However, SB203580 had no effect on LTB 4 -or PAF-induced adhesion or CD18 integrin adhesion receptor expression. In contrast, SB203580 inhibited TNF\u2423-induced adhesion in a dose dependent manner. Our data demonstrate that p38 activation is essential for equine neutrophil migration. Moreover, p38 has a role in establishing neutrophil polarity, but does not regulate adhesion activation by chemoattractants. Further studies will determine whether p38 regulates polarity via a mechanism involving the actin cytoskeleton. Infection with Streptococcus equi equi has up to a 20% complication rate. One complication, equine purpura hemorragica (EPH), is a hypersensitivity reaction where antigen-antibody deposition leads to cutaneous vasculitis presenting as cutaneous edema, and petechial or ecchymotic mucosal hemorrhages. The purpose of this report is to characterize an unusually severe presentation of EPH that involved infarctive lesions of skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal and pulmonary tissues. This presentation closely resembles anaphylactoid purpura or Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein disease that is well described in human literature but not in veterinary medicine.",

Of these, 4 Quarter Horses and one Morgan horse, 5 to 13 years of age, were identified with infarctive lesions of skeletal muscle and/or the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. Four horses presented with signs of colic and muscle stiffness and 1 with muscle swelling and stiffness alone. Pitting limb edema was present in 3 and ventral abdominal swellings in 2 horses. Four horses were diagnosed with Strangles within three weeks of presentation. The fifth horse had an upper respiratory infection of unknown etiology 1 month prior to pre-sentation whereupon a markedly elevated S equi M protein titer (1:25,600) was identified. Common clinical pathologic changes included neutrophilia with a left shift and toxic change, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia and elevations in CK (47,360-280,000U/L) and AST (964-6,960U/L). Three horses were euthanized within 24 hours of admission due to unrelenting pain. One horse, treated with penicillin, phenylbutazone and dexamethasone (40 mg/day three times), improved for 3 days, then developed colic and was euthanized after celiotomy revealed inoperable intestinal infarcts. The fifth horse was treated for 2 weeks with penicillin, 3 weeks with dexamethasone (\u03fe40 mg for 7 days) and then a 10 week tapering course of oral prednisolone. Monitoring serum CK activity was necessary before tapering the dose of corticosteroids. At necropsy, 4 horses had infarcts of the skeletal musculature, gastrointestinal tract and lungs; S equi, was isolated from all of the horses. Histopathologic lesions included leukocytoclastic vasculitis and vascular fibrinoid necrosis with acute coagulative necrosis resembling infarcts. Infarctive EHP appears to be a highly fatal complication of S equi infection presenting with signs of focal muscle swelling, stiffness and colic. Successful treatment of one case required early recognition, antibiotic therapy and, of critical importance, prolonged high doses of corticosteroids to reduce the immune-mediated inflammatory response.

A radiograph was taken to ensure proper placement of the contrast material/needle, after which the horses were recovered.

Temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and gait were monitored Q 6 hrs. The spinal cords with corresponding meninges were examined by a blinded pathologist at the level of each exiting spinal nerve. Fresh tissue samples of the dura and pia mater were taken at the level of the 1st through the 5th spinal nerve. Analyses performed on pre-and post-treatment CSF included: cytology, Il-6, TNF-\u2423 and PGI-2 levels. m-RNA expression of Il-1\u2423, Il-1\u2424, Il-6 and TNF-\u2423 was measured in both dura and pia mater at the level of the 1st, 2nd and 5th spinal nerve using real time qPCR (Taqman).",

None of the experimental horses developed a fever; one horse showed mild tetraataxia/paresis at 24 hrs. Although no statistically significant differences were found, individual treated horses showed a minimal-to-mild non-suppurative meningitis centering around blood vessels and spinal nerves, an Il-6 and PGI-2 response in the CSF peaking at 24 hrs, and Il-1 \u2423 and \u2424, Il-6 and TNF \u2423 mRNAexpression at 24 hrs peaking at the 2nd spinal nerve. In conclusion, fever is a common complication of myelography in horses and iohexol induces a minimalto-mild non-suppurative pachymeningitis and epineuritis, possibly mediated by Il-1 \u2423 and \u2424, Il-6 and PGI-2.

Physical examination findings included tachycardia (4), fever (2) and depression (2) . Hematologic and serum biochemical analyses revealed anemia (4), hyperfibrinogenemia (2), hypofibrinogenemia (3), thrombocytopenia (1) and neutrophilic leukocytosis (1) . Ultrasonographic (6) and radiographic (7) evaluation was used to assess lesion characteristics, involvement of surrounding tissues or evidence of metastasis, but was not diagnostic in any case. Ante-mortem histopathologic diagnosis was obtained in all cases in which it was attempted (8). Multiple biopsy samples were necessary in one horse before definitive diagnosis was made. Fine needle aspirates, arthrocentesis (1) and abdominocentesis (1) were not diagnostic. Six of 9 horses were euthanized. Euthanasia without treatment was performed in 3 cases. Medical management (antimicrobial, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug, and intravenous fluid therapy, in addition to whole blood transfusion) was attempted in one case before definitive diagnosis. Surgical resection of masses was performed in 3 horses, 2 of which were later euthanized due to tumor re-occurrence. Diagnosis was confirmed histologically at post mortem in all euthanized cases. Disseminated hemangiosarcoma was diagnosed in 2 cases, and the musculoskeletal system was most commonly involved.",

However, 2 cases resolved spontaneously without specific therapy and returned to racing (1) or produced normal healthy foals (1) . Early histopathological diagnosis may be beneficial if the mass is localized and amenable to surgical resection, which may potentially be curative. In cases where the horse is medically stable, and identified masses are not substantially interfering with quality of life or use, a period of observation may be warranted. The purpose of the investigation was to determine the safety and efficacy of human albumin use as a potential colloidal therapy in the hypoalbuminemic or hypoproteinemic equine patient. Human albumin has been successfully utilized in human, canine and feline patients as a colloidal therapy. Historically, Hetastarch or plasma have been the most commonly used colloidal products in the equine patient. However, their effect is minimal and short lived as they contain little or no protein and the colloid oncotic pressure (COP) is low in comparison to 25% human albumin solution. The data obtained from patients in which albumin was utilized was then compared to Hetastarch. This investigation also included a review of the medical records to identify other patients who fit the criteria of inclusion. In order to be included, horses had to have a serum albumin concentration of less than 1.8 g/dl, a COP less than 10 mm Hg or in imminent danger of developing severe complications from hypoproteinemia. Patients also needed to have a COP, serum biochemistry and packed cell volume/total solids performed before and after transfusion. Plasma and albumin were administered slowly, and during transfusion, patient's vital signs were monitored regularly. Hetastarch was administered as a bolus.",

Intravenous lidocaine infusion has become an increasingly utilized therapy in horses for a variety of clinical conditions. This study was designed to determine the influence of anesthesia on serum lidocaine concentration in two groups of clinically normal, fasted, healthy horses, and then to further determine the influence of gastrointestinal disease on serum lidocaine concentration in anesthetized horses. Eight horses (10 \u03ee 4.0 yrs [X \u03ee SD], 546 \u03ee 63 kg) in the standing (ST) drug-free group, 8 horses (2.3 \u03ee 0.4 yrs, 424 \u03ee 31.5 kg) in the anesthetized healthy (AN-healthy) group, and 10 horses (10 \u03ee 8 yrs, 536 \u03ee 38 kg) in the anesthetized diseased (AN-colic) group were studied. AN-healthy horses were anesthetized for elective arthroscopic surgery. AN-colic horses were equine patients anesthetized for emergency exploratory abdominal surgery for colic. The AN horses received xylazine, guaifenesin (\u03ee benzodiazepine), and ketamine for anesthetic induction and were maintained with sevoflurane. Horses in all groups received a clinically utilized infusion of 2% lidocaine; loading dose (1.3 mg/kg IV over 15 mins), followed by a continuous infusion (0.05 mg/kg/min for an additional 90 mins). Arterial blood was collected prior to lidocaine administration (pre-drug), at 15 min intervals during administration, and at fixed time points for 6 hrs post-infusion. Serum was frozen and stored at \u03ea40\u040aC for analysis using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Selected cardiopulmonary parameters (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, PaO 2 , PaCO 2 ) and temperature were recorded at fixed intervals during lidocaine infusion. All horses were observed for signs of lidocaine toxicity (e.g., muscle fasciculations). Drug concentration data for ST and AN-healthy groups were analyzed using likelihood-based-mixed-effect model to assess period and treatment differences (p \u03fd 0.05). Significantly higher serum lidocaine concentrations were reached in AN-healthy (3672 \u03ee 568 ng/ mL) compared with ST horses (1849 \u03ee 384 ng/mL) during loading dose and continuous infusion. Serum lidocaine concentrations in AN-colic horses (1923 \u03ee 425 ng/mL) were lower than AN-healthy horses and were comparable to ST horses. Serum lidocaine concentrations paralleled the amount administered and returned to pre-drug levels within 4 hrs of discontinuation of the infusion in all groups. Cardiopulmonary values differed between groups but were within normal limits for study and clinical conditions. No signs of lidocaine toxicity were observed. Serum lidocaine concentrations were influenced by general anesthesia in healthy horses, suggesting a dose modification may be appropriate in anesthetized horses. Serum lidocaine concentrations were further influenced by gastrointestinal disease in anesthetized horses, suggesting a likely multi-factorial effect of systemic status, amount of anesthetic agents administered, and cardiovascular support employed. Further studies directed at determining the effect of specific drugs and cardiac output on serum lidocaine concentrations in horses will ultimately allow for appropriate dosing of intravenous lidocaine in a variety of clinical circumstances. Recently, Sosa Leon et al (Equine Vet. J. Suppl. 34: 425-429, 2002) reported that hyperhydration of horses prior to an exercise test simulating the second day of a 3-day equestrian event induced arterial hypoxemia which could be detrimental to performance. It was suggested that the likely cause of hypoxemia in the hyperhydrated horses was some degree of pulmonary edema. To further investigate this phenomenon, we examined the effects of pre-exercise hypervolemia on arterial oxygenation in horses performing the same exercise protocol as Sosa Leon et al during which work in phases B and D elicited 81% and 69% of the maximal heart rate, respectively.",

Among the best-ranked LAB isolates, Lactobacillus plantarum was the species most commonly identified (5/10). One isolate of L. plantarum (LPB80) was subjectively assessed to be superior and was chosen for the in vivo study, Animals received daily either placebo (n \u03ed 3), 10 7 -10 8 colony-forming units (cfu) of LPB80 (n \u03ed 5), or 10 10 -10 11 cfu of LPB80 (n \u03ed 4) for five days. Fecal samples were collected and physical examinations were performed daily for 15 days. Intestinal samples were collected from euthanized calves at the conclusion of the study. No adverse clinical signs were observed in any of the calves that received LPB80. Administration of LPB80 did not affect the counts of fecal coliforms (F value, P \u03fe 0.05). LPB80like colonies were recovered from samples of both treated and placebo animals. Alignment of the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed 99.8-100% similarity with the administered strain.",

OF INTRANASAL VACCINATION AGAINST BOVINE   ENTERIC CORONAVIRUS ON THE OCCURRENCE OF RE-SPIRATORY DISEASE IN A COMMERCIAL BACKGROUND-ING FEEDLOT. Paul Plummer, College of Veterinary Medicine,  University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN. A randomized single-blind clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of intranasal instillation of a modified live oral vaccine against bovine enteric coronavirus on the number of calves treated for bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in a commercial backgrounding feedlot. Four-hundred fourteen heifer calves weighing 350-750 pounds were purchased from various auction barns in the southeastern United States over a period from September 2001 to November 2002. On entering the feedlot, a swab of each naris was taken and a blood sample was obtained on entry and at the end of the observation period. Routine processing included vaccinations, deworming and growth implants. Calves were randomized to receive intranasal administration of 3.0 mL of a commercially available modified live oral vaccine against bovine enteric coronavirus and rotavirus or 3.0 mL of saline. After processing vaccinated and control calves were assigned to separate pens and observed for periods of 17-99 days. Pen assignments were reversed after each group of 150 calves was enrolled in the study. Diagnosis of respiratory disease and severity of disease scores were made by one of two authors blind to the treatment status of calves. Treatment for BRD was standardized. Nasal swabs were examined by ELISA test for the presence of BCV antigen and blood samples were tested by IFA test for antibody titer against BCV. BCV antigen was identified in (125/407) 31% and serum antibody titers \u054620 against BCV in (246/396) 62% of calves entering the feedlot. Seroconversion from \u03fd20 to \u054640 against BCV antigen occurred in 99% and 95% of vaccinated and control calves, respectively during the period of observation. In a multivariable analysis, vaccination was associated with a decrease (P \u03fd 0.01) and the presence of intranasal BCV on entry to the feedlot was associated with an increased risk (P \u03fd 0.01) of treatment for BRD. Among control calves, those with intranasal BCV on entry to the feedlot, RR \u03ed 1.6, and those with antibody titer \u03fd20, RR \u03ed 1.6, were significantly more likely to be treated for BRD. These data provide further evidence of an association between BCV and respiratory disease in feedlot calves. An intranasal vaccine appears to reduce risk of treatment for BRD. The cost effectiveness of vaccination, and effect of vaccine to reduce the number of calves treated for BRD, is likely to be influenced by the prevalence of intranasal BCV and antibody titers \u03fd20 against BCV among calves entering the feedlot. The purpose of this study was to determine the threshold of detection of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts inoculated into bovine colostrum using direct immunofluorescence preceded by a concentration in water and ethyl acetate.",

Sediments containing the oocysts were suspended in 500 L of sterile water. Direct immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies specific to C. parvum (Merifluor, Meridian Bioscience, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio) was used to detect concentrated oocysts in the samples. C. parvum oocysts were detected at every concentration (100, 1 000 and 10 000 oocysts/ml). No oocysts were detected in negative controls.

Deterioration of the digital laminae may occur as a complication of numerous systemic disease processes. We have previously shown increased cytokine and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in digital laminae during developmental laminitis, and are interested in determining whether these local digital inflammatory changes are a result of a systemic inflammatory response. Hepatic Kupffer cells are an important source of inflammatory mediators in states of systemic inflammatory response in rodent sepsis models. Due to reported portal endotoxemia in a bovine model of grain overload, we hypothesized that digital inflammation and degeneration may be secondary to inflammatory mediator production originating from the portal reticuloendothelial system. Our objectives were to determine hepatic cytokine expression in the developmental stages of experimental laminitis in the bovine grain overload (GO) model and the equine black walnut extract (BWE) model. Liver samples were collected and frozen from 31 steers: 6 hrs [developmental stage/onset of decreased central venous pressure, n \u03ed 12; 6 hr GO] and 12 hrs [onset of clinical signs of laminitis, n \u03ed 12; 12 hr GO] after administering grain at 3.5% of BW, and 6 hrs after water [n \u03ed 7, controls]. Samples were collected in horses 2-4 hrs after either BWE administration (onset of leukopenia, n \u03ed 5, BWE), or 2-hrs after water administration (n \u03ed 5, control).

Pulmonary intravascular macrophages may replace Kupffer cell reticuloendothelial function in horses and ruminants, or circulating leukocytes may be the source of systemic inflammation.

Polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM) is a glycogen storage disorder in Quarter Horses (QHs) associated with abnormal polysaccharide accumulation in skeletal muscle. Horses with PSSM have increased insulin-stimulated glucose excursion from the blood compared to controls indicating enhanced insulin sensitivity. The mechanism by which enhanced glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis induces muscle necrosis with exercise in PSSM horses is unknown. Feeding a low starch/fat supplemented diet decreases postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations and reduces rhabdomyolysis in regularly exercised PSSM horses. We hypothesized that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake could be reduced and rhabdomyolysis minimized by administering dexamethasone (DEX) to PSSM horses since DEX inhibits GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. The specific aims were 1) to determine if DEX decreases insulin sensitivity in PSSM horses compared to placebo and 2) to determine if DEX decreases 4-hour post exercise serum creatine kinase (CK) activity compared to placebo.",

Mean serum CK activity (3,920 \u03ee 1,110 U/L) on placebo was not significantly different from DEX treatment (3,900 \u03ee 743 U/L). The results of this study indicate that although DEX treatment can significantly reduce insulin sensitivity in PSSM horses over a 3-week period it has no impact on reducing exercise induced rhabdomyolysis or decreasing muscle glycogen concentrations in PSSM horses. Thus, for the duration of this study, enhanced insulin stimulated glucose uptake did not appear to be the primary factor responsible for increased glycogen synthesis and exertional rhabdomyolysis in PSSM horses. Glycogen branching enzyme deficiency (GBED) has recently been reported in the American Quarter Horse. Varied clinical signs included late term abortion, weakness at birth, ventilatory failure, hypoglycemic seizures, contracted tendons, inability to rise, and/or sudden death by 18 weeks of age. Abnormal globular and crystalline polysaccharide is found in multiple tissues and isolated polysaccharide from liver and muscle has an unbranched structure in GBED. GBE1 enzyme assays from blood, muscle or liver tissue show virtually no activity in affected foals and GBE1 protein in liver determined by Western immunoblot is markedly absent in affected foals. Dams of affected foals have approximately half of the control levels of GBE1 activity and approximately half the amount of GBE1 protein. Biochemical and pedigree analyses are consistent with an autosomal recessive trait, however the mutation causing GBED in foals is not known. The purpose of this study was to determine the sequence of the GBE1 cDNA in horses and to determine if a mutation is present in foals with clinical and biochemical evidence of GBED Over 90% of the coding sequence of the equine GBE1 gene was obtained by RT-PCR. The remaining 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 sequence was obtained from BAC clones screened to ensure they contained GBE1 exon 2 and 15. PCR primers were designed to amplify a 266 bp segment of the equine GBE1 gene containing the 5\u0408 UTR and almost all of exon 1. These primers were used to screen 16 controls, 11 GBED foals and at least one of their parents for a GBE1 mutation. A single base pair substitution resulting in conversion of tyrosine (Y) to a premature stop codon was identified in exon 1. All affected foals were homozygous for the mutation, all available dams and/or sires were heterozygous, and all control horses were homozygous for the Y allele. The previous findings of poorly branched glycogen, abnormal polysaccharide accumulation, lack of measurable GBE1 enzyme activity and lack of immuno-detectable GBE1 protein in foals with GBED can all be explained by this premature stop codon in the GBE1 mRNA. The pedigree contains prolific stallions with many thousands of offspring that are possible carriers of the recessive mutation. A DNA based test will allow easy identification of GBED foals and the ability to identify carriers will help prevent occurrence of this devastating disease in Quarter Horse related breeds. Exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) occurs in 5-10% of Thoroughbred racehorses. Pedigree evaluation as well as biochemical and physiological analysis suggest that a form of ER known as recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis (RER) is due to an inherited disorder of intracellular calcium regulation. Horses with RER have a lower contracture threshold to halothane and caffeine in intact intercostal muscle biopsies compared to controls. Thus, RER bears clinical and physiological resemblance to a heritable disorder in other species known as malignant hyperthermia caused primarily by mutations in the RYR1 gene. Specific Aim 1 in the present study was to determine the pattern of inheritance of RER. Specific Aim 2 was to test the RYR1 gene for linkage to RER. A well-defined family of horses was constructed by breeding Thoroughbred and crossbred horses with known clinical RER status and known phenotypes according to muscle contracture testing. The 22 resultant foals were tested for RER susceptibility with an in vitro muscle contracture test. Additional multigenerational families were provided through a collaborative effort with stables around the country. Thoroughbreds were diagnosed with ER based on history, clinical signs and whenever possible serum CK activity. Visual inspection and Chi Square analysis of the combined families indicated that the RER trait appeared to segregate in an autosomal dominant fashion (p-value for exclusion of dominance \u03fe0.25). A recessive mode of inheritance was excluded due to the presence of an unaffected offspring from two affected parents. In the resource herd 5 foals tested positive for RER (3 males, 2 females); 12 foals tested negative (6 females, 6 males). In the additional families 13 offspring were assigned positive phenotypes (3 male, 10 female) and 10 offspring were described as normal (7 male, 3 female). Simulated linkage analysis was used to identify 96 individuals (36 affected) from the resource family and 3 additional families for a molecular genetic linkage analysis of RER to the RYR1. RYR1 was excluded as causative for RER in combined pedigrees by genetic linkage analysis with eight microsatellite markers from ECA10p, which all showed LOD scores below \u03ea1.00 for linkage to RER. Thus, RER appears to be a novel heritable disorder affecting muscle contractility and a future whole genome scan on these pedigrees should enable the mapping of the chromosomal locus of the RER gene. Exercise depletes muscle glycogen content. Replenishment of muscle glycogen is critical for optimal performance during subsequent high-intensity exercise. Availability of the substrate, plasma glucose, and translocation of the main glucose transporter from storage vesicles inside the muscle cell to the cellular membranes, are key factors for muscle glycogen replenishment in other species. The purpose of the present study was to clone and sequence the glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) in horses, and determine the effect of glycogen depleting exercise and of meal type after exercise on GLUT4 gene expression in equine skeletal muscle by quantification of GLUT4 mRNA by real-time RT-PCR normalized to expression of equine beta Actin.",

Loading treatment with mitotane did not reduce serum gastrin concentrations in affected dogs, and serum cortisol concentration did not correlate with the severity of hypergastrinemia. Therefore, hypergastrinemia in dogs with PDH may not be mediated by hypercortisolemia. However, since gastrin was measured just after mitotane loading, it is possible that hypergastrinemia would resolve following chronic treatment. The cause of this hypergastrinemia and possible clinical affects in canine PDH including increased gastric acid secretion or contribution to hepatomegaly as a trophic factor require additional studies. Hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) is a common endocrinopathy of older dogs. A variety of complications have been noted with this disease including hypertension, proteinuria and a hypercoagulable state. Proteinuria in HAC may lead to urinary antithrombin III (AT III) loss, decreased levels of which have been suspected to contribute to the hypercoagulable state seen with HAC. Work in a variety of species has shown that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) can decrease systemic blood pressure and reduce proteinuria with glomerulonephritis. Recently a microalbuminuria assay has become available which may be able to document lower levels of glomerular protein loss than is possible with the standard urine protein to urine creatinine ratio (UP:UC).",

When combined with a high protein-low carbohydrate diet, it resulted in a very high remission rate in newly diagnosed diabetic cats. The relative euglycemia achieved with glargine was assumed responsible for rapid reversal of beta cell glucose toxicity and early diabetic remission. Obesity of companion animals contributes to respiratory, orthopedic and other disorders. Diets to support healthy weight loss utilize caloric restriction at the sacrifice of palatability. Metabolic approaches to increase adipose tissue mobilization or prevent adipose accumulation have the potential to become important alternatives to weight management. To address this concept, a new vegetable oil has been developed containing 80% diacylglylcerol (DAG) which is a naturally occurring yet minor component of traditional dietary oils containing triacylglycerol (TAG). DAG has been studied in rodents and human trials and is generally regarded as safe. Primary digestion products of DAG are 1-(or 3-) monoacylglycerol and fatty acids the latter of which appear to be favorably beta-oxidized in the intestinal mucosa and liver rather than re-esterified as TAG in the adipocyte. Under this condition, less secretion of TAG-rich chylomicra and less adipose tissue accumulation would occur. This study was designed to confirm the observed post-prandial effects of DAG in normal dogs and extend the work to include the determination of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities. Normal adult Beagles were fed meals enriched in dietary DAG compared with TAG. Four different meals were fed containing cooked chicken breast combined with either DAG or TAG in the presence of either high or low glycemic index carbohydrate sources. High amylose corn-starch (low glycemic index) and waxy corn-starch (high glycemic index) were used as carbohydrate sources. The meals were randomly fed to each of 12 dogs and post-prandial blood samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 hours. Post-heparin plasma was also obtained following the 6hour blood sample. Serum triglyceride, non-esterified (NEFA) fatty acids, and glucose were evaluated using standard methods. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) of post-heparin plasma were assayed by differential substrate techniques. Significant differences were found for both the peak and extent of post-prandial hypertriglyceridemia when DAG was consumed independent of high or low glycemic-index starch. When low glycemic carbohydrate was fed a peak serum NEFA response was seen after 2-3 hours. High glycemic carbohydrate plus TAG showed a more precipitous decrease of NEFA during the first 30 minutes after feeding. Serum NEFA also varied more widely in both TAG groups compared to DAG. Greater post-prandial peak elevations of glucose were seen with high glycemic carbohydrate. Preliminary analysis of the lipase data found higher LPL activity when DAG was fed but similar HL activities among the groups. We conclude that meals containing DAG decreased post-prandial hypertriglyceridemia compared to TAG while maintaining a more consistent NEFA and serum glucose response. DAG may also be involved in modulating LPL activity, and assisting fatty acid uptake and its utilization. Recently, measurement of 17OHP has been advocated as a means for diagnosis of occult canine hyperadrenocorticism. However, the sensitivity and spec-ificity of this test has not been defined. Our objectives were to assess serum 17OHP concentration pre-and post-injection of ACTH in tumor-bearing dogs and in dogs being screened for hyperadrenocorticism (HAC).",

Accurate prediction of parturition is important for optimizing neonatal survival, especially in high risk pregnancy and those for which a Cesarean section is planned. As determined by breeding dates, average canine gestation length is 63 days from the first breeding (range 57-70 days). This 14-day range is too broad for accurate monitoring of high risk pregnancies. Because initial changes in progesterone correlate with the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, and thus with ovulation, serum concentrations of progesterone are related to gestation length. Parturition normally occurs 65 \u03ee 1 day from the LH surge. Quantitative progesterone assays are readily available and do not require daily sampling as does LH. Previous reports compared gestation lengths with progesterone concentrations of 1.0-10.0 ng/ml (3.18-31.8 nmol/L) at breeding. In our colony, pregnancy rates are highest when breeding occurs at progesterone concentrations of 30-64 nmol/L. Therefore, further study was needed.",

There was no statistically significant difference in the prediction error between the 2 breeding dates. There was a statistically significant relationship (p \u03ed .01) between progesterone concentration at the time of first breeding and subsequent gestation length. For every 10 nmol/L increase in progesterone, gestation length declined by a half day, such that average gestation length was 61 days when breeding occurred at progesterone concentrations of 20 nmol/L, 60 days when progesterone was 40 nmol/L, and 59.2 days when progesterone was 60 nmol/L.

There is evidence for beta cell autoimmunity in a proportion of affected dogs, and also for an association between pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus. The association between diabetes mellitus and pancreatitis in dogs warrants particular attention, because pancreatic inflammation may play a role in initiation of beta cell autoimmunity in susceptible dogs, and lead to destruction of beta cells. Concurrent pancreatitis also has important implications for the clinical and nutritional management of diabetic dogs.

Chronic hyperglycemia causes insulin resistance in human beings and dogs. This has clinical relevance in the treatment of diabetic patients. Because sensitivity to insulin is improved once chronic hyperglycemia is reduced with insulin therapy, the insulin dose may need to be decreased to avoid life-threatening hypoglycemia. Insulin resistance caused by hyperglycemia occurs in dogs with experimental diabetes mellitus, but has not been studied in dogs with spontaneous diabetes that are receiving insulin therapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between degree of glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in dogs with spontaneous diabetes.

Low adiponectin concentrations could contribute to insulin resistance in feline obesity and diabetes mellitus. Measurement of circulating ionised calcium (iCa) concentration is a more accurate indicator of calcium status than either total calcium or albumin adjusted calcium values. Ideally iCa should be measured immediately after anaerobic blood collection to minimise alterations induced by changes in sample pH. Unfortunately this is not always practical in the clinical setting. In humans when sample analysis is delayed the iCa concentration is adjusted to pH 7.4 using a specific regression equation appropriate to the analyser being used. The purpose of this study was to investigate iCa and pH in canine blood under three storage conditions to determine the change in both over time and whether the iCa mea-surement adjusted for pH accurately reflects the actual iCa value. The storage conditions were chosen to mimic sample handling in the practice situation Blood was collected from 18 dogs referred to the University Veterinary Hospital. A commercial pre-heparinised syringe was used as recommended by the manufacturer, and iCa measured within 10 minutes (WB10) on the Bayer Rapidpoint 400 blood gas analyser. A sample of blood was also placed in a commercially available heparinised tube and analysed within 10 minutes (HT).

Inclusion criteria were coughing, tachypnea, or increased respiratory effort severe enough to limit exercise capacity and adversely impact quality of life. Dogs with obvious trauma or metabolic disease, such as renal failure, were excluded from study. NT-proANP and BNP were measured by RIA, and ET-1 and cTn-I were measured by a sandwich ELISA. Final diagnosis was based on information derived from a minimum of physical exam, thoracic radiographs and echocardiography. Congestive heart failure (CHF) was diagnosed in 21 dogs (CHF Group \u03ed 10 dilated cardiomyopathies, 10 acquired degenerative valvular diseases, patent ductus arteriosus, subaortic stenosis) and dyspnea of non-cardiac origin was diagnosed in 27 dogs (noHD Group \u03ed 12 with pneumonia, 8 with pulmonary neoplasia, 3 with pleural neoplasia/effusion, 2 with laryngeal paralysis, 2 with chronic bronchitis).",

Noninvasive quantification of left ventricular (LV) mass is one variable that can be used to assess severity of LV diseases and response to interventions aimed at reducing LV hypertrophy. Echocardiography (ECHO) has been traditionally used to quantify LV mass, but requires precise alignment, and clear delineation of endocardial and epicardial borders. Also, one must assume that the LV is a uniform, ellipsoid shape unless Simpson's rule is utilized.",

Seven domestic cats weighing 4.4 to 5.8 kg were sedated with acepromazine and hydromorphone, and ECHO was performed. LV mass was calculated using the truncated ellipse formula from a right parasternal long-axis view (RPV) at end-diastole rather than using a left apical 4-chamber view or Simpson's rule because of better visualization of the LV apex and inconsistent visualization of the right endocardial border of the septum from the RPV. MRI was performed (GE Signa 1.5 Tesla) on cats anesthetized with propofol. Heart rate ranged from 83 to 108 beats/minute (mean \u03ed 98 bpm; SD \u03ed 10.8 bpm) T1 weighted MR images were acquired during multiple phases of the cardiac cycle. The shortaxis images were obtained by acquiring 3 mm thick contiguous slices perpendicular to the long-axis of the heart. Images were acquired using the gradient echo sequence with and without hyperventilation-induced apnea and cine pulse sequence without apnea. LV mass was determined using Simpson's rule. Endocardial and epicardial borders were traced on each slice at end-systole, enddiastole, and mid-cycle. LV myocardial volumes were summated, and multiplied by myocardial density (1.05) to obtain LV mass at each measured phase of the cardiac cycle. Cats were euthanized and the LV was dissected and weighed to determine the true mass. The best MRI edge detection was obtained with the gradient echo sequence during apnea. The mean number of slices was 10 (range \u03ed 9 to 11 slices). MRI at end-systole was the most accurate method of determining LV mass based on use of Lin's concordance coefficient (MRI end-systole c \u03ed 0.94; MRI mid-cycle c \u03ed 0.76, MRI end-diastole c \u03ed 0.81; ECHO end-diastole c \u03ed 0.6). Actual LV mass ranged from 6.5 to 10.5 g (mean 8.5 g; SD 1.6 g) compared to MRI LV mass at end-systole, which ranged from 6.7 to 11.1 g (mean 8.7 g; SD 1.7 g) and echocardiographic LV mass at end-diastole, which ranged from 5.2 to 9.1 g (mean 7.1 g; SD 1.8 g).",

The traditional approach to the correction of congenital patent ducts arteriosus (PDA) in dogs has been ligation via left thoracotomy. During the past 7 years, an increasing percentage of cases have been corrected using catheter delivered occlusion devices, primarily Gianturco coils delivered via the femoral artery. The femoral approach provides the most direct access to the PDA with the least amount of catheter maneuvering. Because of the caliber of currently available catheter and coil systems and the small size of many affected dogs, delivery via the femoral artery may be technically difficult. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and limitations of transcatheter coil occlusion of PDA using a carotid artery approach in dogs.",

Dogs were anesthetized for transesophageal echocardiography, followed by transcatheter coil embolization of the PDA via surgical access of the right external carotid artery. A 5Fr-7Fr catheter was easily inserted into the artery. Because of the angles between the brachiocephalic trunk, aorta and ductus, catheters were pre-formed with an Sshaped curve to allow the catheter tip to enter the aortic side of the ductus. Using detachable coils, 1-3 coils were placed in the PDA of each dog. Placement of the first coil was relatively easy. Placement of additional coils was more difficult, as the curved course of the catheter, ductus angle and reduction in ductal flow made controlled manipulation of coil position more difficult compared to the femoral approach.",

There were two minor complications (two additional coils were delivered using a femoral arterial approach in dog 2 and one small coil embolized into a left femoral artery branch in dog 5). All dogs recovered uneventfully. One year later all dogs were reported to be normal. No murmur was heard in 3 dogs, and a very soft, localized grade 1/6 continuous murmur was heard in 2 dogs. Re-evaluation by echocardiography at one year showed complete PDA closure in one dog and trivial to mild residual ductal flow in the other 4 dogs. Although technically more demanding than the femoral artery approach, the carotid artery approach may be a viable alternative, especially in very small dogs. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between plasma carvedilol (Coreg), a 3rd generation non-selective beta-blocker with ancillary alpha 1 -blocking and antioxidant properties, and chronic oral carvedilol in canine patients with acquired spontaneous cardiovascular disease. The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of carvedilol in normal conscious dogs has been previously reported. Carvedilol has a low and variable oral bioavailability. Based on an isoproterenol challenge study in normal dogs receiving chronic oral carvedilol (1.5 mg/kg twice per day), plasma carvedilol levels were found to correlate well with the magnitude of beta-blockade. Additionally, maximum plasma carvedilol concentrations are reportedly higher in human patients with spontaneous cardiac disease relative to control subjects. In light of the aforementioned data and the potential for adverse effects with rapid over zealous beta blockade in canine patients with spontaneous cardiac disease, evaluation of PK data in this population of dogs is warranted prior to initiation of clinical trials to assess its efficacy.",

There were 13 purebred dogs and 2 mixed breed dogs; 13 females and 2 males. Age ranged from 2.8 to 71.2 months (median 5.3). Weight ranged from 2.3 to 24 kg (median 5.4). Minimum ductal diameter was measured with two dimensional (2D) and color Doppler (CD) modalities via transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) from the right (R) and left (L) parasternal views and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Measurements were compared to angiographically derived minimal diameter. TTE was performed with intravenous buprenorphine (0.007 mg/kg). Angiography and TEE were performed under general anesthesia. CD TTE and first pass nuclear angiography (FPNA) were utilized to assess initial and residual ductal flow postoperatively. 14/15 dogs were determined to be completely occluded at 1 month, documented by a FPNA ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow (QP:QS) \u03fd1.2 and no CD TTE flow.",

Ubiquitin is a highly conserved 72-aa chain involved in intracellular protein degradation by the 26S proteosome system. Ubiquitin recognizes and tags damaged intracellular proteins prior to delivering them to the proteosome system for degradation. The ubiquitin-proteosome system (UPS) is critical to the normal maintenance and turnover of cell constituents. Defects of the UPS may affect the balance of cytoplasmic proteins, cause accumulation of non-functional proteins, and lead to loss of normal cellular function and/or cell death. Explanted human hearts with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) contain over 200 distinct ubiquitin-labeled proteins, possess a 5-fold increase in overall ubiquitin labeling, and reveal occasional myocytes with massive intracellular deposits of ubiquitin complexes. Canine IDCM possesses many morphologic and biomolecular similarities to the human disease. We hypothesized that intracellular ubiquitin accumulation occurs in dogs with IDCM.",

They are both high frequency discharges distinguished by their electrophysiological parameters. Myokymia is characterized by undulating, vermicular, rippling, and wave-like movements spreading across the muscle surface, which persist despite sleep or anesthesia. Myokymic discharges are short bursts of ectopically generated motor unit potentials, firing at rates of 5-62 Hz and appearing rhythmically as doublets, triplets, or multiplets. Neuromyotonia is characterized by muscle stiffness and persistent contraction related to underlying spontaneous repetitive firing of motor unit potentials. Neuromyotonic discharges are characterized by prolonged bursts of motor unit potentials, firing at rapid rates of 150-300 Hz, which begin and end abruptly, do not fire rhythmically, and have a characteristic waning amplitude. In humans, neuromyotonia is commonly associated with immune-mediated disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, thymomas, amyloidosis, and lymphoma. Myokymia is commonly associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, multiple sclerosis, radiation plexopathy, brainstem tumors, and timber rattlesnake envenomation. Myokymia and neuromyotonia can also be primary autoimmune disorders, associated with antibody production against voltage-gated potassium channels.

Cerebrovascular (CV) disease is increasingly recognized as a cause of intracranial dysfunction in dogs. Clinical features, breed-associations, predisposing factors, and imaging characteristics of vascular-associated abnormalities are just now beginning to be further clarified. Five greyhound dogs were evaluated beginning in 1999 for acute cerebral disease suspected to be associated with CV abnormalities. Dogs ranged in age from 5 to 13 years. All clinical signs began acutely. Three dogs' signs were consistent with a central vestibular dysfunction including ataxia (3/3), head tilt (3/3), paresis (3/3), and one dog had a horizontal nystagmus. Two dogs had signs of supratentorial abnormalities including ipsilateral head turn, decreased facial sensation and vision deficits contralateral to the lesion as well as limb paresis. Clinical signs in 1 dog reflected a right-sided lesion, while the other had signs of a left-sided lesion. No dog had generalized seizures. Systolic Doppler blood pressures were performed in two dogs; one dog had pressures consistently above 180 mm Hg, and the other was at 167 mm Hg. No significant abnormalities were found in the serum chemistry (4/4), complete blood count (5/5) or urinalysis (3/4). One dog had protein loss in the urine with an elevated urine protein : creatinine ratio. Coagulation evaluations in 2 dogs were normal. CSF was collected in 3 dogs and was normal in these dogs. Four dogs had magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the intracranial region using standard sequences. Two of these dogs had vestibular signs, and 2 had supratentorial signs. All dogs had focal abnormalities within the brain. In one of the dogs with vestibular signs, MR imaging was normal. In the other dog with vestibular signs there was a focal lesion in the left cerebellum and brain stem. In the two dogs with supratentorial signs, 1 had a lesion in the internal capsule, and 1 had a lesion involving the caudate nucleus. MR imaging features included hyperintense abnormalities on T2-weighted and Flair sequences and isointense to hypointense abnormalities on T1-weighted sequences. Enhancement following intravenous contrast administration (Gadolinium DTPA) was variable. Two dogs had echocardiograms, 1 being normal and 1 having a suspected myocardial infarction as well as increased left ventricular wall thickness. All dogs improved rapidly initially with supportive care and had continual improvement over the ensuing 2 to 4 weeks. All dogs were discharged to their owner's care at home. One dog with the lesion in the caudate nucleus was necropsied two years after initial presentation and had pathologic features consistent with that of a previous CVA within the caudate nucleus. Clinical course and MR imaging characteristics in these dogs support the possibility of CV disease. The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of lysosomal storage disorders in which glycosaminoglycans accumulate. MPS VI is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase, also known as arylsulfatase B (ASB). MPS VI is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, and is clinically characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphism, corneal dystrophy, secondary neurological disturbances, and such orthopedic abnormalities as loss of the femoral head and remodeling of acetabular bone. MPS VI has been diagnosed in Siamese and domestic short hair cats, as well as in several breeds of dogs, including miniature pinschers, miniature schnauzers, corgis and Chesapeake Bay retrievers. Miniature pinschers affected with MPS VI have come from Louisiana, California and South America. They were diagnosed by a positive urinary MPS spot test, white blood cell inclusions, and deficient ASB enzyme activity.",

The normal canine ASB cDNA sequence was determined using primers developed based on conserved sequences of the human and feline ASB, and by screening clones from a canine cDNA library. When the DNA coding sequence from miniature pinschers affected with MPS VI was compared to the normal canine sequence, a single missense mutation (G to A) was identified. This mutation, occurring in exon V, replaces the tiny amino acid glycine with a bulky arginine in a highly conserved region of the protein and is found only in affected dogs. A DNA test based on restriction enzyme analysis of PCR products was developed. Samples were solicited for testing from AKC registered miniature pinschers, including nine dogs diagnosed with LCP disease. DNA obtained from cheek swab or blood samples from 89 miniature pinschers has been analyzed. One affected and ten carrier dogs were identified. None of these had LCP.

The altered organic acid profiles could reflect such an error, or they could be secondary, such as to severe seizures in a neonate. The genetic analysis suggests an autosomal recessive trait, which may be widespread in the breed. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the location and associated neurological signs of brain infarcts in dogs. Medical records of 38 dogs that presented for evaluation of acute onset, non-progressive (after 24 hours), intracranial neurological signs were reviewed [1999] [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] . All dogs had a lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible with brain infarction. Based on the MRI findings, infarcts were classified based upon: 1) location within the brain (telencephalic, thalamic/midbrain, cerebellar, pons/medulla or multifocal), 2) suspected arterial territory involved, 3) presence or absence of hemorrhage and 4) pattern of contrast-enhancement. Common neurological findings were recorded for each infarct location. The location distribution of the brain infarcts were as follows: 6/38 telencephalic, 12/38 thalamic/midbrain, 17/ 38 cerebellar and 3/38 multifocal (thalamic and medulla). Telencephalic infarcts occurred within the territory of the middle cerebral (4/6) and rostral cerebral arteries (2/6). Thalamic/midbrain infarcts occurred within the territory of the striate arteries (5/12) and perforating arteries of the rostral brainstem (7/12). Cerebellar infarcts were all within the territory of the rostral cerebellar artery. The appearance of the telencephalic and cerebellar infarcts resembled territorial infarcts seen in humans, while the thalamic/midbrain infarcts resembled lacunar infarcts. All infarcts appeared as non-hemorrhagic and contrast-enhancement was observed in only 3/38 dogs, all of which were imaged more than 7 days after the onset of neurological signs. Common neurological findings of the brain infarctions were as follow: telencephalic infarct (abnormal mental status, contralateral postural reaction deficits, contralateral nasal hypalgesia, contralateral menace deficits and ipsilateral circling), thalamic/midbrain infarct (contralateral or ipsilateral postural reaction deficits, contralateral menace deficits, ipsilateral head tilt or turn, nystagmus, ventrolateral strabismus and anisocoria), cerebellar (asymmetric cerebellar quality ataxia, head tilt, intermittent opisthotonus, nystagmus, ipsilateral menace deficit with apparent normal vision).

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) uric acid level is an index of turnover of nucleic acid and the degree of cellular destruction in the brain leading to increases in interstitial uric acid (UA) and may reflect glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Elevated CSF uric acid levels are associated with the degree of malignancy of human brain tumors serving as an indirect prognostic marker for patient outcome. The objectives of this pilot study were to evaluate a technique for the analysis of UA levels in canine CSF and compare UA levels in the CSF of dogs with intracranial meningiomas to those with a normal central nervous system based on clinical signs, in addition to MRI and CSF analysis.",

All dogs had a cisternal CSF tap performed under general anesthesia; 0.3ml of CSF from each dog was stored in fluoride oxalate containers at \u03ea80\u040aC until analysis. Uric acid in dog CSF was measured using HPLC with ultraviolet detection. The method used a citrate/acetate buffer with 6% methanol run isocratically. The uric acid peak eluted after 3 minutes and was detected at a wavelength of 292 nm. The limit of detection of this method is approximately 200nM. The intra-and interassay CVs were 5.1% and 8.3% respectively. Results are presented as arithmetic mean \u03ee SD. Data were analyzed with standard statistical methods, using a two sample T-tests for independent samples. Significance was set at P \u03fd 0.05. The mean CSF uric acid level was 13.60 M (\u03ee5.83) in group I and 6.90 M (\u03ee2.35) in group II and these values were significantly different (P \u03ed 0.04) with a mean difference of 6.7 (95% CI: 0.4, 13). This small pilot study demonstrates that CSF uric acid concentrations can be reliably measured in dogs and that there is a significant elevation in CSF uric acid in dogs with intracranial meningiomas. This research is now being expanded to evaluate larger groups of dogs with other intracranial tumor types and grades in an attempt to associate CSF UA concentrations with tumor malignancy and ultimately survival of the patient. Steroid-responsive meningoencephalitis (SRME) is an idiopathic condition which can be divided into subtypes such as granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing encephalitis, unclassified viral, allergic and eosinophilic meningoencephalitis.

Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis is a promising approach in the treatment of highly vascularized solid tumors such as primary brain tumors. Defining the presence of critical angiogenic pathway targets, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, is essential in selecting appropriate clinical cases for inclusion in therapeutic trials. Antiangiogenic treatment strategies for canine primary brain tumors have been developed utilizing intratumoral delivery of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors targeting the VEGF pathway in mice. Before these novel therapies can be used in spontaneous canine tumors, the therapeutic targets and viral vectors must be validated in canine tissues.",

The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the typical case signalment and medical conditions associated with brain infarctions, to identify associations between medical conditions and brain infarct types and locations, and to assess the outcome of dogs with brain infarcts. Medical records of 33 dogs that presented for acute onset, non-progressive (after 24 hours), intracranial neurological signs were reviewed. All dogs had magnetic resonance imaging findings compatible with brain infarction (30/33) or post-mortem confirmation (3/33). All dogs were evaluated with complete hematology, biochemistry, thyroid, coagulation and adrenal profile, urinalysis, thoracic and abdominal imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Arterial blood pressure was evaluated in 28/33 dogs. Based on the imaging findings, infarcts were classified depending on their type (large 'territorial' or small 'lacunar') and location within the brain (telencephalic 6/33, thalamic/midbrain 12/33, cerebellar 15/33). Associations between type or location of brain infarction and clinical outcome were assessed using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. There were no significant associations between region or type of infarct on one hand and patient age and sex, occurrence of hypertension (systolic \u03fe160 mmHg and/or diastolic \u03fe120 mmHg), presence of CSF abnormalities or presence or absence of an associated medical condition on the other hand. Small breed dogs (\u054515 Kg) were significantly more likely to have large cerebellar infarcts while large breed dogs (\u03fe15 Kg) were significantly more likely to have a small/thalamic/midbrain infarct (OR \u03ed 16.5, 95% CI \u03ed 1.7-163, P \u03ed 0.01). The only individual breed effect was a significant breed predisposition in spaniels (all 7 had cerebellar infarcts). An associated medical condition was detected in 18/33 infarcts. Chronic kidney disease (8/33) and hyperadrenocorticism (6/33) were the two most commonly encountered conditions. Ten of the 33 dogs were euthanized due to the lack of improvement of their neurological status (3) or severity of their associated medical condition (7). There was no association between type or region of infarct and outcome, however, dogs with an associated medical condition had a significantly shorter lifespan (7 deaths and 9 still alive, OR \u03ed 12, 95% CI \u03ed 1.3-111, P \u03ed 0.02) than those dogs with no identifiable medical condition (14 still alive).

Pulmonary surfactant maturation occurs in the last trimester of gestation. It undergoes changes at birth, when the lung makes the transition from a fluid to an air-filled state.

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefpodoxime against 173 equine bacterial isolates was determined using the E-test. Time to peak serum concentration (T max ) in 7-to 14-day-old foals (mean \u03ee SD) was 1.67 \u03ee 0.68 h, maximum serum concentration (C max ) was 0.81 \u03ee 0.22 g/ml, and elimination half-life was 7.17 h (harmonic mean). The disposition of cefpodoxime in 3 to 4 month-old foals was not significantly different from that of neonates. Adult horses had significantly higher C max and significantly lower T max when compared to foals. Concentrations of cefpodoxime in synovial and peritoneal fluids were similar to that of concurrent serum concentrations. Urine concentrations were 12 to 72 times higher than concurrent serum concentrations. The drug could not be detected in CSF. No adverse reactions were noted in foals whereas mild colic developed in 2 adult horses. MIC 90 of cefpodoxime against Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella spp., Klebsiella spp., and \u2424-hemolytic streptococci was 0.38, 1.0, 0.16, 0.19, and 0.09 g/ml, respectively. Dosing schedules for \u2424-lactam antimicrobials should maintain serum concentrations above the MIC of a given pathogen for at least 50% of the dosing interval to achieve therapeutic efficacy. Oral cefpodoxime administered to 7-to 14-day-old foals at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 12 h resulted in serum concentrations above the MIC 90 of Klebsiella spp., Pasteurella spp. and \u2424-hemolytic streptococci for more than 50% of the dosing interval. The same dose given at 8-h intervals would be required for therapy of S. enterica infections. Administration at 8-h intervals would also result in serum concentrations above the MIC of 75% of E. coli isolates for approximately 50% of the dosing interval. Further studies are required to determine the efficacy and safety of these dosages in a clinical setting. D-dimer is a degradation fragment produced by the action of plasmin on crosslinked fibrin. In human patients, high plasma D-dimer is associated with DIC, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and catheter-related venous thrombosis. We performed this study to determine whether measurement of D-dimer could aid in the diagnosis of DIC and other thrombotic disorders in foals. Specific objectives were: 1. Determine plasma D-dimer concentration of healthy foals (n \u03ed 15) 2. Compare plasma D-dimer concentration of septic and agematched healthy foals (n \u03ed 10) 3. Monitor D-dimer concentration of septic foals (n \u03ed 14) at admission and after 24 hr treatment.",

This study also demonstrated that SAA is present at high concentrations in equine colostrum and early milk. Correlation between SAA concentration in colostrum and normal neonatal foal serum at 48 and 60 hours suggests that this protein may be absorbed in the early post-partum period of increased macromolecular absorption in the neonatal intestine and could interfere with the accuracy of serum SAA concentration measurement as an aid in the diagnosis of sepsis in foals if colostral concentrations were high. Absorption of this protein does not appear to persist past 12 hours in the normal equine neonatal intestine. It is unclear if colostral/milk SAA represents maternal hepatic-derived SAA or if it is mammary gland-derived. Milk amyloid A-3 (MAA-3), a mammary gland derived isoform of SAA, has been previously demonstrated in bovine, ovine, equine and human colostrum. Unfortunately, currently available assays do not distinguish SAA and MAA-3. Human and bovine MAA-3 have been shown to have a protective function in the infant neonatal intestine through up-regulation of mucin production and prevention of pathogen adhesion. Further studies are required to define the role of MAA-3 in the protection of the equine neonatal intestine. The strong association between increased risk for septicemia and mortality in foals with inadequate serum IgG concentrations has focused the veterinary literature solely on the role of IgG in neonatal infection. However, evidence in other species suggests that additional proteins in colostrum may also be important in innate immunity. Lactoferrin is a glycoprotein in the transferrin family that is found in colostrum, milk, and neutrophils. It exerts antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory actions by several mechanisms. The purposes of this study were to establish the normal serum concentration of lactoferrin in healthy foals before and after ingestion of colostrum, to determine serum IgG and lactoferrin concentrations in sick neonatal foals, and to determine if serum lactoferrin concentration is associated with sepsis or mortality.",

Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) administered to horses with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) results in an increase in serum cortisol concentration of greater than 50% for 15-90 minutes. Normal horses do not show a change in cortisol concentration following TRH. While this phenomenon has proven useful in the diagnosis of PPID, the physiological basis of this response is unknown. A more complete understanding of the physiological regulation of the pars intermedia (PI) may provide insight into the dysregulation observed in PPID. We hypothesized that TRH is a physiological releasing factor of the PI.

This is the first evidence that TRH is a releasing factor of the equine PI. ACTH is also a minor product of the equine PI, however we did not detect an increase in ACTH following TRH. This is consistent with the finding that serum cortisol does not increase following TRH administration in normal horses. In horses with PPID, the PI is hyperplastic and produces large amounts of POMC-derived peptides, including \u2423-MSH and ACTH. When horses with PPID are given TRH, the presence of excessive numbers of TRH-responsive melanotropes may release sufficient ACTH to evoke a measurable cortisol release from the adrenal glands. Synthetic thyroid hormone (levothyroxine sodium) therapy is often initiated when clinical signs commonly attributed to hypothyroidism are recognized, or when lower than normal serum total triiodothyronine (tT3) and total thyroxine (tT4) concentrations are detected. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of levothyroxine therapy on body weight (BW), physical parameters, serum concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormones; and on the hormonal responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) injection. Levothyroxine sodium (Thyro-L) was administered orally to 8 mares for 8 weeks according to an incrementally increasing dosing regimen of 2, 4, 6, or 8 teaspoons (tsp)/d, with each dose administered for 2 weeks (1 tsp \u03ed 12 mg levothyroxine). Four additional mares were given a placebo and served as controls. Physical parameters including rectal temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were measured weekly. Blood samples were collected for serum thyroid hormone measurements and intravenous TRH challenges were performed at the beginning of the study and at 2 wk intervals afterwards. Hormonal responses to intravenous administration of 1.2 mg TRH were examined by comparing preinjection values with serum tT 3 and fT 3 concentrations at 2h post-injection, tT 4 and fT 4 concentrations at 4h post-injection, and TSH concentrations at 45min and 2h post-injection. Mean \u03ee SD body weight decreased (P \u03fd 0.01) by 19 \u03ee 12 kg over 8 weeks in treated mares and these horses appeared to be more excitable during the 2 weeks when 8 tsp/d was administered, but measured physical parameters were not altered by levothyroxine therapy. Significant (P \u03fd 0.01) treatment \u03eb time effects was detected by repeated measures analysis of variance for serum tT3, tT4, fT3, fT4, and TSH concentrations. In treated mares, serum tT3 (r \u03ed 0.33; P \u03ed 0.04), tT4 (r \u03ed 0.95; P \u03fd 0.01), fT3 (r \u03ed 0.68; P \u03fd 0.01), and fT4 (r \u03ed 0.76; P \u03fd 0.01) concentrations were positively correlated with the dose of levothyroxine sodium administered. Serum TSH (r \u03ed \u03ea0.44; P \u03fd 0.01) concentrations were negatively correlated with dose. Hormonal responses to TRH injection were significantly altered by levothyroxine sodium administration. Significant (P \u03fd 0.01) treatment \u03eb time effects were detected for the tT3, tT4, fT3, and TSH responses examined and the magnitudes of these responses were negatively correlated with dose in treated horses. Results of this study show that levothyroxine sodium significantly reduces body weight, increases serum thyroid hormone concentrations proportional to the dose administered, lowers serum TSH concentrations, and blunts hormonal responses to intravenous TRH administration. Intravenous glucose-insulin tolerance tests (IVGITT) were performed to test the hypothesis that levothyroxine sodium administration alters glucose metabolism in horses. Eight mares received levothyroxine (Thyro-L, Lloyd, Inc., Shenandoah, IA) orally for 8 weeks according to an incrementally increasing dosing regimen of 2, 4, 6, or 8 teaspoons (tsp)/d, with each dose administered for 2 weeks (1 tsp \u03ed 12 mg levothyroxine). Four additional mares were given a placebo and served as controls. Glucose dynamics were assessed by IVGITT at the beginning and end of the 8-week period. Mares were acclimatized to stall confinement for 12 hours prior to testing and provided with grass hay and water before and during the test. Testing was performed by infusing 150 mg/kg glucose as a 50% dextrose solution, immediately followed by 0.1 units/kg regular insulin. Blood samples were collected at 1, 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135 , and 150 minutes post-injection. Blood glucose and insulin concentrations were measured and data from each IVGITT were analyzed using the minimal model to generate values for glucose effectiveness, insulin sensitivity (SI), and net insulin response (NIR). Insulin disposal rates (IDR) were also calculated by linear regression analysis of insulin concentrations after conversion to natural logarithmic values. Normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk statistic and effects of time were analyzed independently for each treatment group using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Means \u03ee standard deviations are reported. Data were successfully modeled for 3 of 4 mares in the placebo group and all treated mares. Body weight decreased (P \u03fd 0.01) by 19 \u03ee 12 kg over 8 weeks in treated mares. Insulin sensitivity increased (P \u03fd 0.01) by greater than 2-fold in levothyroxine-treated mares (from 1.20 \u03ee 0.67 \u03eb 10 \u03ea4 L\u00b7mU \u03ea1 \u00b7min \u03ea1 at week 0 to 2.61 \u03ee 1.04 \u03eb 10 \u03ea4 L\u00b7mU \u03ea1 \u00b7min \u03ea1 at week 8). In contrast, SI did not differ significantly between weeks 0 and 8 in the placebo group (4.34 \u03ee 6.92 and 2.26 \u03ee 0.22 \u03eb 10 \u03ea4 L\u00b7mU \u03ea1 \u00b7min \u03ea1 respectively). Glucose effectiveness did not differ between weeks 0 and 8 in the levothyroxine (4.39 \u03ee 3.73 and 2.34 \u03ee 0.21 \u03eb 10 \u03ea2 min \u03ea1 respectively) or placebo (1.73 \u03ee 1.00 and 2.23 \u03ee 0.47 \u03eb 10 \u03ea2 min \u03ea1 respectively) groups. Net insulin response also did not differ between weeks 0 and 8 in the levothyroxine (124.88 \u03ee 15.57 and 116.20 \u03ee 49.06 mU\u00b7min\u00b7L \u03ea1 respectively) or placebo (120.76 \u03ee 40.73 and 143.21 \u03ee 46.45 mU\u00b7min\u00b7L \u03ea1 respectively) groups. Insulin disposal rate increased (P \u03ed 0.01) in treated mares. Blood insulin concentrations decreased at a rate of 9.3 \u03ee 1.3%/min at week 8, compared with 7.2 \u03ee 1.1%/min at week 0. Placebo group IDR values did not differ with time. Results show that levothyroxine administration increases insulin sensitivity and accelerates insulin disposal. Effects of levothyroxine cannot be distinguished from those of weight loss in this study, but results suggest that this drug may be useful for the treatment of insulin resistance in horses. We investigated the relationship between \u2423-melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u2423-MSH) and body condition in horses. In other species, activation of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is necessary for maintaining normal body weight. Therefore, one would expect that defects in this receptor would result in obesity and elevated levels of its primary agonist, \u2423-MSH, in an effort to maintain homeostasis. We postulated that horses are similar and that variability in the function of the MC4R receptor could lead to alterations in body mass index (BMI) and plasma \u2423-MSH concentration. Specifically, we hypothesized there would be a positive correlation between plasma \u2423-MSH concentration and BMI. The correlation between body condition score (BCS) and BMI was evaluated because BMI has not been previously used as an index of obesity in horses.",

Six healthy horses were given a combined glucose-insulin test (150 mg/kg \u03e9 0.10 U/kg, IV, respectively), and results were compared to both the singular intravenous glucose tolerance test (150 mg/kg) and the singular intravenous insulin sensitivity test (Humulin-R 0.10 U/kg). Blood samples (14) were collected (jugular catheter) within 150 min. Selected horses suffering from pars intermedia pituitary adenoma (endocrine condition), urolithiasis (non-endocrine condition), and treated with xylazine (inhibitor of insulin secretion) were tested along with healthy horses. As expected, in either the glucose tolerance test or insulin sensitivity test, a single phase curve resulted: a positive hyperglycemic phase or a negative hypoglycemic phase, respectively. In contrast, in the combined glucose-insulin test, glycemia resulted in a clearly biphasic curve: a positive or hyperglycemic phase (peak 250% base-line, at 1 minute and returned to baseline by 30 min) followed by a negative or hypoglycemic phase (the nadir was approximately 50% baseline at 40 minutes and returned to baseline by 140 min). Disease and experimental disruption of the glucose homeostasis loop resulted in either absence (blunting) of negative phase or a shift to the left (increased insulin sensitivity). Physical stress caused an insulin resistance profile (sustained positive phase). The combined test provided at least three consistent and temporal correlated elements for the evaluation of the glucose homeostasis loop: baseline value, positive phase profile, and negative phase profile. The combined test has the potential to identify and perhaps assess relative degree of insulin-secretion or insulin sensitivity failure. The result is promising and warrants further clinical research. After an athletic event horses require substrate for muscle glycogen synthesis. Rates of muscle glycogen synthesis depend on glucose availability. The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of withholding feed and of ingestion of isocaloric meals of hay or grain on glucose turnover rates and muscle glycogen synthesis after exercise.",

In conclusion, this study suggests that in horses, unlike that observed in humans and rodents, increasing glucose availability to skeletal muscle by feeding highglycemic meals after exercise does not hasten muscle glycogen synthesis during the first 8 h after exercise. Increased glucose availability may instead be preferentially directed towards hepatic glycogen synthesis and/or increased metabolic rate after exercise.

Each study period lasted 8 hours. All cats were awake during the study. There was at least 1 week washout period between studies. GFR (ml/kg/min) was calculated using both m99Tc-DTPA nuclear scintigraphy and renal inulin clearance. RBF (ml/kg/min) was calculated using renal clearance of para-amino hippuric acid. UO (ml/kg/hr) was measured as the rate of urine production during the study period. Non-parametric statistical analysis was performed. GFR, RBF and UO were compared between the 4 treatment groups using Friedman's test. Individual groups were compared using Wilcoxon's signed rank test. Significance was set at p \u0545 0.05.

In healthy cats furosemide and dopamine induced the largest amount of urine production but did not cause an increase in GFR or RBF. This therapy caused a decrease in GFR when compared to fluid therapy alone and a decrease in GFR and RBF when compared to fluids and mannitol. Additional studies are required to assess these parameters in cats with CRD. In healthy cats it appears that the renal affects of mannitol are superior to those of furosemide and dopamine together when used as an adjunct to fluid diuretic therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine complement C3 and immune complex levels in the serum of dogs with protein-losing nephropathies, compare these levels with normal dogs, and determine whether these hematological pa-rameters could be utilized as prognostic indicators. Thirty healthy dogs were identified and served as controls. Blood was collected from each dog and the serum was separated and frozen. Thirty-two dogs with naturally occurring protein-losing nephropathies (PLN) were identified as they presented to Tufts Foster Hospital for Small Animals between July 1, 2002 and July 1, 2003 . Blood was collected from each patient and the serum was separated and frozen. The clinical course of the patients was followed from the time they were identified until December 1, 2003 .

Serum was serially diluted 1:2 and the C3 and IC levels (titer) were defined as the greatest dilution at which the absorbance at 490 nm was greater than or equal to twice the background absorbance reading. The inverse of the log 10 of the titer was calculated and used for statistical analysis. No statistical difference in complement C3 level was detected between the healthy (6.5 \u03ee 0.0409) and PLN dogs (6.3 \u03ee 0.0797) (p \u0545 0.4355). Dogs with PLN did have a statistically significant (p \u0545 0.001) elevation in IC levels (3.86 \u03ee 0.0783 vs. 3.14 \u03ee 0.0502). In order to determine if IC level was prognostic, the PLN group was divided into two subgroups based on the mean IC level for all PLN dogs. There were 15 PLN patients with above average IC levels and 14 with lower than average IC levels. Survival curves for the two sub groups were plotted. While PLN dogs with a lower than average IC level had a longer median survival (78 days) than those with higher then average IC levels (5.5 days), the difference was not statistically significant (p \u0545 0.3189) due to the size of the sub-populations. Therefore, a larger study is necessary to evaluate the relationship between IC level and survival in PLN dogs. Ethylene glycol (EG) toxicity is an important cause of acute renal failure in dogs and carries a poor prognosis in patients that progress to oligo-anuria. Hemodialysis (HD) is very effective at removing EG and its metabolites and for the management of the resulting uremia, but its use in dogs has not been well documented in this setting. We analyzed presenting biochemical variables and EG and glycolic acid (GA) concentrations, as well as urea, EG, and GA reduction ratios (URR, EGRR, and GARR, respectively) and outcome in dogs with positive serum [EG] that underwent HD. Dogs were divided into azotemic (A) and non-azotemic (NA) groupings for comparison. All data are reported as medians (25-75%).",

Eleven cats (48%) left the hospital of which 6 cats had normal renal function at discharge and 5 cats had chronic renal disease. Two major categories for the etiology of acute renal failure were established. Twelve cats (44%) had a nephrotoxic cause of which only 3 cats lived; 13 cats (52%) had ''other'' etiologies that include ischemic causes (4 cats), known or suspected infectious causes, or undetermined causes. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine if initial SCr, BUN and potassium levels, or duration of stay were associated with outcome. Urine production and etiology were analyzed by Fisher's exact test. The initial SCr, BUN and potassium values have no statistical significance in association with outcome. Eighteen cats (72%) were either anuric or oliguric during the initial phase of the renal failure. Five cats (20%) were nonoliguric and 2 cats (8%) were polyuric.

All nonoliguria and polyuric cats did survive. Nephrotoxicity and anuria by itself was not fatal in this study, but both of them together were. Identification of etiopathologic factors associated with feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC) has been hindered by lack of comprehensive histopathologic descriptions of urinary bladder lesions in affected cats. In a previous study, hematoxylin and eosin stained urinary bladder biopsy specimens from cats with chronic FIC showed mucosal erosions/ulcerations, and submucosal edema, fibrosis, hemorrhage, neovascularization, mastocytosis, and mononuclear cell infiltration. These changes were significantly different from those observed in specimens from clinically normal cats, but not different from those observed in specimens from cats with urolithiasis. The purpose of this study was to utilize specialized histochemical and immunohistochemical stains to further characterize the inflammatory (lymphocyte subpopulations and/or mast cells), connective tissue (neovascularization and/or fibrosis), and uroepithelial changes associated with chronic FIC. Eighty urinary bladder biopsy specimens from 40 cats with chronic FIC, 15 cats with urolithiasis, and 25 clinically normal cats, submitted to Michigan State University, were stained immunohistochemically with markers for T (CD3) and B (CD79a) lymphocytes, mast cells (c-kit), neovascularization (Factor VIII-related antigen), and uroplakin (uroplakin III), and histochem-ically for collagen (trichrome) and glycosaminoglycans (GAG; alcian blue), and examined by light microscopy.

However, the frequency of and degree of lymphocyte and mast cell infiltration and fibrosis and neovascularization were not different between the chronic FIC and urolithiasis groups.

In human pediatric patients, the use of a topical anesthetic cream containing a mixture of 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine (EMLA cream) has been shown to reduce pain and discomfort associated with procedures such as venipuncture, catheter placement, and skin biopsies. Our recent study showed that EMLA cream, applied as 1 gram to a 10 cm 2 area of skin, is without systemic absorption or adverse effects in healthy cats (Gibbon et al., J Vet Pharm Ther, 2003) . The purpose of the present study was to evaluate, in hospitalized sick cats, the safety and efficacy of EMLA cream in decreasing signs of discomfort and facilitating the placement of jugular catheters without sedation. 25 hospitalized cats, with a variety of diseases and requiring jugular catheter placement, have been enrolled to date. Cats were scored for severity of illness and temperament, and then randomly assigned to receive either placebo vehicle or EMLA cream (1 gram to a 2 \u03eb 5 cm area of skin overlying one jugular vein). After one hour of occlusion, the cream was removed and a single lumen 19 g., 8 inch jugular catheter was placed on the treated side. The safety of EMLA cream was assessed by observing for evidence of local skin irritation; cardiopulmonary, neurologic, or GI side effects; or detectable plasma lidocaine and prilocaine levels up to 6 hours after cream application. Cats were scored for struggling, aggression, or vocalization (each on a discomfort scale of 0-3) during catheter venipuncture. If individual scores of 2 or higher were obtained, routine sedation was administered to complete catheter placement. Ten cats have received EMLA cream, and 15 cats placebo. There have been no signs of adverse effects in either group. The mean discomfort score for EMLA cats was 2.9, and the mean score for placebo cats was 4.1. 60% of cats receiving EMLA, and 40% of cats receiving placebo, had jugular catheters placed without sedation. Neither of these differences reached statistical significance in this sample size. We conclude from the initial results of this study that EMLA is safe to use as described in ill cats, and that EMLA may provide local analgesia that is sufficient to allow catheter placement in some cats without sedation. However, other factors, such as fear, fractious temperament, and resistance to restraint, may override the benefit of local analgesia in allowing catheter placement without sedation. Because most bacterial infections are extracellular and antimicrobial pharmacokinetic studies are usually limited to examining the plasma or serum concentrations, this study was undertaken to investigate the concentrations in extracellular tissue fluid (interstitial fluid (ISF)) using an ultrafiltration device for ISF collection in the dog. Enrofloxacin (Baytril) and marbofloxacin (Zeniquin) are fluoroquinolones registered for use in dogs and cats in the US. Tissue distribution of fluoroquinolones in dogs has been determined in studies using tissue biopsies and tissue cages. Both of these techniques are invasive and they have not determined the protein-unbound drug concentrations in the ISF. Only the proteinunbound fraction of antimicrobials is microbiologically active. Our goal also was to determine the influence of lipophilicity and protein binding on the distribution of fluoroquinolones into tissue ISF.",

Lipophilicity was determined from the octanol-water partition coefficient. Protein binding was measured using the ultrafiltration device in vitro. Lipophilicity and protein binding of enrofloxacin were higher than marbofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. At steady state during the CRI, marbofloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar distribution into tissue fluid (similar ISF and plasma protein-unbound concentrations) despite a higher lipophilicity and volume of distribution of enrofloxacin.

This study was designed to determine the cardiovascular and respiratory effects of Alfaxan-CD RTU at the planned intravenous (IV) label dose of 2 mg/kg and at 6 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg (1, 3 and 10 times the label dose). Four female and four male dogs were instrumented under propofol-isoflurane anaesthesia on the day before study. A thermodilution catheter in the pulmonary artery was used to monitor core body temperature, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and cardiac output. A teflon catheter in the right carotid artery was used for determination of aortic blood pressure and for anaerobically collecting arterial blood samples for pH and blood gas (PO 2 , PCO 2 ) analyses. Also measured were; heart rate (beats/min), body temperature (\u040aC), SAP, DAP, MAP (mm Hg), mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) (mm Hg), right atrial pressure (RAP) (mm Hg), cardiac output (mL/kg/min), heart rhythm (lead II), respiratory rate (breaths/min), hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO 2 %), mucous membrane color and capillary refill time. On the day of study data were collected at \u03ea60, \u03ea5 and 1, 5, 10, 15 and 30 minutes and every 10 minutes thereafter until the dog recovered from anesthesia. The three doses of Alfaxan-CD RTU were administered IV, in random order with a minimum washout between dosing of 3 hours from full recovery. The investigators were blind to the dose administered. After administration of Alfaxan-CD RTU all dogs were intubated and allowed to breathe room air. If a dog's arterial PO 2 fell below 60 mm Hg positive pressure ventilation was initiated with 100% oxygen at 6 breaths per minute until spontaneous breathing produced an arterial PO 2 greater than 80 mm Hg. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance for repeated measures with appropriate post t tests for within and between group comparisons. A P \u03fd 0.05 was considered significant.",

Firocoxib is a highly selective inhibitor of the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and is a member of the coxib class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In this study the peri-operative analgesic efficacy of firocoxib was evaluated when administered orally once daily at approximately 5 mg/kg for 5 days to dogs undergoing surgery (ovariohysterectomy). The study was a negative control, double-blinded, efficacy study using a randomized block design where blocks were replicates. Twenty, client-owned, female dogs of various breeds, weighing 14 to 74 kg with a mean of 26.8 kg and aged 0.5 to 7 years with a mean of 2.9 years, were included. Only clinically normal dogs were enrolled in the study based on physical examination and haematological and biochemical evaluation prior to the study (Day \u03ea3). Replicates of two dogs were formed in order of presentation. Within replicates one dog was randomly allocated to treatment with placebo and the other to treatment with firocoxib. Individuals administering treatment, performing surgery, or making assessments were not aware of the treatment assignments. Treatments were administered approximately 3 hours before surgery on Day 0, and on Days 1, 2, 3 and 4 at approximately 24 hour intervals. Ovariohysterectomies were performed following premedication with acetylpromazine, induction with propofol, and maintenance with isofluorane/oxygen. Surgeries for each replicate were performed by the same surgeon who was also responsible for all post-operative assessments for that replicate. The extent of pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) once on Day \u03ea3 (prior to treatment), at approximately 2 and 4 hours after surgery on Day 0 and on Days 1, 2, 3 and 4 at approximately 3 to 5 hours after treatment. To determine the VAS score a mark was made on a 100-mm scale such that 0 corresponded to no pain and 100 corresponded to the worst pain possible. Clinical signs associated with pain in dogs included restlessness, depression, panting, vocalization, looking or licking at the wound excessively, biting, an anxious appearance, reluctance to move, and inappetence. VAS was analyzed using analysis of variance for a randomized block design at each time point. Statistical testing was considered significant if the p-value was less than 0.05.",

It has been shown that DAG has characteristics consistent with less accumulation of body fat through recent clinical experiments in animal models and humans. We have examined its inclusion in dog food as an antiobesity ingredient. Obesity is a serious problem for both human and canine species. and there is a high demand for ''anti-obesity'' dog foods. Although ''anti-obesity foods are available that are reduced in fat or calories they are often less palatable and less satisfying overall. By contrast, if a weight-reducing dog food were to have intrinsic metabolic characteristics due to help lower canine body weight lower without reducing the amount of dietary fat or calories, it would be expected that to be more useful and beneficial to dogs and their owners. Thus, we examined the potential of dietary DAG as an anti-obesity ingredient in dog food using obese beagles. 32 beagles between 2-6 years old were used for the experiment; 15 females and 17 males. They were divided into two groups so that gender, age, weight, and caloric intakes were similar. 7% of TAG or DAG with similar fatty acid compositions was added to a basal food which contained 9% fat from dry ingredients after extrusion. Amounts of the supplemented diets were calculated and fed for a 6 week period to maintain body weight of each dog. Total caloric intakes did not change throughout the experiment. Body weight was measured every week, and serum chemistry evaluations were done before and after the feeding period. Body fat amount was measured before and after the experiment using a deuterium dilution method. There was no difference in the amount of food intake between 2 groups. Differences in body weight were seen after 2 weeks between the groups which was statistically significant after 6 weeks pass (p \u03ed 0.0152, ANOVA). The amount of body fat was decreased in the DAG group. Serum total cholesterol value became significantly lower in the DAG group. And beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations became significantly increased in the DAG group. Based on the above experiment, it was determined that DAG was effective for weight reduction and body fat content in the obese canine. SLE is a systemic autoimmune syndrome defined by clinical and serological features, including arthritis, glomerulonephritis, dermatitis and autoantibodies. SLE was induced in eight normal dogs by immunization with heparan sulfate, the major glycosaminoglycan of glomerular basement membrane. All the heparan sulfate-immunized dogs showed mild to moderate levels of proteinuria and skin disease. Cutaneous signs associated with SLE including alopecia, erythema, crusting, scaling, and seborrhea were observed. Immunohistological examination of the skin lesions revealed deposition of IgM and complement in dermal-epidermal junction. Three out of eight dogs showed lameness. The anti-nuclear antibody tests were positive with the antibody titers higher than 1:128 in all eight dogs. This experimental SLE model could be useful for studying immune-mediated skin disease and autoimmunity.",

The reproducibility of DNA extraction, amplification of bacterial DNA, and the separation of amplicons by DGGE was evaluated by comparing similarity indices (Dice coefficient; 100% represents complete identity) of DGGE profiles between duplicates of each dog and between the samples from all 8 dogs using gel analysis software (BioNumerics 3.0, Applied Maths).",

Hepatic function tests that are both sensitive and specific for estimation of hepatic function in dogs have not been available. Recently, a new diagnostic test, 13 C-aminopyrine demethylation blood test, has been described in dogs. The kinetics of 13 C-aminopyrine demethylation have been described in normal dogs and a time point of 45 minutes after 13 C-aminopyrine administration has been identified as the optimal time point for blood collection. Also, a dose of 2 mg/ kg 13 C-aminopyrine given intravenously has been described as optimal. Finally, a 13 C-aminopyrine demethylation blood test has been performed in dogs that underwent hepatic biopsy. Initial results suggest that dogs with more severe hepatic disease have a decreased hepatic demethylating capacity. Doxorubicin is a chemotherapeutic agent that is commonly used for the therapy of dogs with lymphoma and other malignant neoplasias. Little is known about hepatic toxicity of doxorubicin in dogs.

Accurate bronchoscopic diagnosis depends on visual assessment of gross tissue appearance to determine where biopsies are to be taken. The optimal location for biopsy sampling is not always readily apparent. An accurate non-invasive assessment of tissue architecture would help determine the best location. Many non-invasive modalities have been evaluated including, the use of vital dyes, indocyanine green dye fluorescence, fluorescein fluorometry, laser doppler flowmetry, and ultrasound. Due to various limiting factors, none of these technologies has greatly improved the ability to assess tissue beyond simple observation. Biopsy and histopathology remain the gold standard for tissue evaluation. Polarization-Sensitive Optical Coherence Tomography (PS-OCT) and Optical Coherence Tomography/Doppler Tomography (OCT/ODT) devices have recently been developed that have the potential to assess tissue non-invasively in realtime. This novel optical technology is analogous to ultrasound except that the images are created with echoes of light rather than sound. OCT images are capable of a 10 fold increase in resolution compared to best ultrasound images. PS-OCT uses coherence gating to image tissue birefringence with a high degree of spatial resolution. When the polarization state of light reflects from various depths in a tissue, PS-OCT can determine lesion depth based on condition of collagen and structural proteins. Optical Doppler Tomography (ODT) essentially combines Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to produce high-resolution tomographic images of static and moving constituents in biologic tissues. OCT/ODT technology has the ability to non-invasively image in vivo blood flow with high spatial resolution. By using a Michelson interferometer with a low coherence light source, ODT can measure the amplitude and frequency of the interference fringe intensity generated to form a combined structural and velocity image. The image resolution currently approaches 10 microns with this device but this technology has produced images with resolutions of 1-2 microns using alternate light sources. The optical imaging fiber is approximately 2 mm in diameter and is easily placed in the biopsy channel of a bronchoscope. Using inhalation and ventilator induced airway injury models we compared the results of this instrument to standard histopathology and frozen section techniques in both ex vivo and in vivo preparations. The OCT measurement had excellent correlation with standard histology techniques. The OCT imaging technique allows the clinician to rapidly scan large anatomic areas searching for the best area to biopsy. It also allows the clinician to the ability serially follow suspicious lesions. Feline asthma is characterized by reversible bronchoconstriction and chronic airway inflammation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are thought to contribute not only to the pathogenesis, but also to the perpetuation of disease, and may lead to lipid peroxidation of cell membranes. Isoprostanes are a family of eicosanoids produced by random oxidation of tissue phospholipids. In the present study 8-Isoprostaglandin F2a was determined as a direct marker of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 6 cats with spontaneous feline asthma. Diagnosis was established based on history and clinical signs, thoracic radiographs, BALF cytology and detection of bronchoconstriction during an asthmatic attack by use of conscious unrestrained barometric whole body plethysmography. Subsequently, the cats underwent a carbachol challenge to test for the presence of airway hyperresponsiveness. 8-Isoprostaglandin F2a was measured by an enzyme immunoassay (Cayman). 6 healthy cats served as controls.",

Whether fungal organisms detected using molecular techniques are causally related to the inflammation observed or result from entrapment or accumulation in the nasal cavity requires further investigation. Firocoxib is a highly selective inhibitor of the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and is a member of the coxib class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs developed specifically for veterinary use. A randomized, placebo controlled, four-period cross-over study was conducted under laboratory conditions involving eight dogs to confirm the effective dose of firocoxib in a sodium urate crystal induced synovitis model of arthritis. The efficacy of firocoxib was compared with placebo vehicle, vedaprofen, and carprofen. Treatments were administered orally once each period and, based on available tablets or oral gel, corresponded to dose levels of at least 5 mg firocoxib/kg body weight (bw), 0.5 mg vedaprofen/kg bw, and 2.0 mg carprofen/kg bw. The washout period between treatments was seven days. One hour prior to each treatment, 19 mg sodium urate suspended in 0.9% saline was injected in the left or right stifle joint to induce synovitis. The injected joint was alternated between left and right in successive periods. On the day prior to injection and treatment, and at 3 and 7 hours post-treatment, each dog was walked over a force plate to measure the peak vertical force. Six measurements were recorded at each time point and adjusted for animal body weight. Peak vertical force was transformed to the percentage of baseline (%bl, prior to urate) for each dog and time point in each period. Clinical lameness was scored based on a five point scale at the same time as peak vertical force. Analysis of variance for a crossover design was performed for the 3 and 7 hour post-treatment time points using the MIXED procedure of SAS. The model included sequence, period and treatment as fixed effects, and replicate and replicate-by-sequence interaction as random effects. Pairwise contrasts were used to compare firocoxib with each of the other treatment groups. All statistical testing was two-sided and performed at the 5% significance level.",

Secretory IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin subtype in mucosal secretions and is believed to protect mucosal membranes from the entry of pathogens. In human beings IgA deficiency is the most common primary immunodeficiency and is associated with frequent infections of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts. A comparable disorder has been reported in certain dog breeds, such as German Shepherd Dogs. In human beings IgA deficiency is defined by the presence of a low serum IgA concentration. In dogs, however, it is reported that serum IgA concentrations do not reflect local intestinal IgA production (German et al, Vet Immunol.

Secretory IgA is the major immunoglobulin subtype secreted by the intestinal mucosa. Polymeric IgA is synthesized by plasma cells located in the intestinal lamina propria, either organized in Peyer's patches or disseminated throughout the intestinal epithelium. Most intestinal IgA synthesis is induced locally by luminally derived antigens. Secretory IgA is formed during the transport of polymeric IgA through the intestinal epithelial cell. Since antigenic stimulation of the gastrointestinal tract varies, it can be expected that fecal IgA concentrations in any one individual will show some degree of variation.

Histological results of rectal mucosal biopsies were different from duodenal mucosal biopsies in 4/6 horses; histologic examinations were considered normal in 4 horses that had an infiltrative enteritis diagnosed by duodenal mucosal biopsies.",

Two of the normal horses had mucosal leucocytic infiltration that was compatible with a diagnosis of lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis. This procedure was well tolerated by horses except for occasional transient abdominal discomfort which was controlled by analgesics. In conclusion, duodenal mucosal biopsies performed under endoscopic guidance is well tolerated by horses. As normal horses may have a slight-moderate lymphocytic-plasmacytic infiltration of duodenal mucosal, results of duodenal biopsies in horses with malabsorption syndrome must be interpreted in light of the clinical findings. Despite this limitation, duodenal biopsy may be an adjunctive diagnostic technique in cases of equine malabsorption syndrome. This research project was support by the GRE-MEQ. Aortic valve regurgitation is a common echocardiographic finding in the horse, even in the absence of structural valve pathology and is termed 'physiological regurgitation.' However the mechanisms that lead to physiological regurgitation and its subsequent association with aortic valve disease are unknown. The aortic valve is a dynamic structure capable of contraction in-vitro. Although the significance of contraction has not yet been fully elucidated, it may contribute to diastolic competence in-vivo. While the ability of the aortic valve to relax has not been previously investigated, mechanisms that cause relaxation of the valve may be a factor in physiological regurgitation. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of adenosine to cause relaxation of the normal equine aortic valve in-vitro and to identify the receptors involved in this response.",

The fall in ABP seemingly invoked the baroreceptor reflex, causing sympathetic activation that increased sinus node rate, and presumably blunted the depressive effects of diltiazem on myocardial and nodal tissues.

Reduced glutathione (GSH) plays a critical role in maintaining intracellular oxidative balance and neutralizing potentially harmful free radicals.

Obesity is the most common nutritional disorder in small animal practice. Although it is the severe risk factor for a number of diseases in dogs and cats, recent findings based on the molecular biology of obesity have not been fully applied to veterinary medicine. To establish a novel approach to the treatment of obesity in dogs, we focused on the mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP). UCP is a proton transporter, which dissipates the electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, and thereby uncouples oxidative phosphorylation to result in heat production. Thus, UCP is implicated in the regulation of energy expenditure, and expected to be a target molecule for prevention and treatment of obesity. We cloned three isoforms of canine UCPs 1, 2 and 3, and revealed that their structure and tissue distribution were almost identical to those of other species including rodents and humans. We also reported that beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonists increased UCP expression in adipose tissue and thereby reduced body fat content in dogs. Gene expression of UCPs is also regulated by a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which is a nuclear receptor using polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as effective ligands. We investigated the effects of dietary PUFA on adiposity in dogs.",

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the gross and microscopic pathology and clinical side effects caused by Alfaxan-CD RTU at clinical and exaggerated doses. Twenty-four (24) healthy beagle dogs (12M/12F) were randomly assigned to four (4) treatment groups of eight animals (4M/4F) each. Dogs were intravenously administered either 0.9% saline (0\u03eb), or Alfaxan-CD RTU at 2 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg (1, 3 and 5\u03eb the label dose) q 48 hr for three (3) treatments. Study parameters included the following; clinical observations, mortality, body weight (kg), physical examination, body temperature (\u040aC), clinical pathology (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urine analysis and fecal analysis), anesthetic examinations (heart rate and rhythm [beats/min; lead II ECG], pulse [/min], direct blood pressure [mm Hg], hemoglobin saturation [%SpO 2 ] and respiratory rate [breaths/min]), anesthetic event times and injection site observations. Forty-eight (48) hr after the last treatment, animals were euthanized, necropsied and tissues were submitted for histopathology. Kaplan-Meier curves were used for comparison of anesthetic event data across treatment groups using the log rank test. Other quantifiable parameters were analyzed using an ANCOVA model with baseline values as covariates. A P \u03fd0.05 was considered significant.",

Dogs consumed normal quantities of food, had stable body weights and normal physical examinations and injection sites throughout the study. There were no unscheduled deaths. Blood chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urine, fecal and ECG analyses showed no effects attributable to the test article. Statistical examination of anesthetic event times showed a dose proportional treatment effect for time to onset of recumbency, duration of non-responsiveness to stimulus, duration of anesthesia and duration of recumbency amongst the Alfaxan-CD RTU treatment groups. There were no significant treatment-related changes in body temperature or respiratory rate. At 10 and 20 min after Alfaxan-CD RTU dose administration, heart rate and pulse rate significantly increased as dose increased. At 10 min post Alfaxan-CD RTU treatment, systolic (also at 30 min), diastolic and mean blood pressure all decreased as dose increased. A dose-dependent decrease in hemoglobin saturation was seen at 2 and 4 min post Alfaxan-CD RTU administration. All animals recovered from anesthesia uneventfully and without need for artificial support. Blinded gross and histological examination of tissues showed a no observed effect level (NOEL) of at least 10 mg/kg. The intravenous anesthetic Alfaxan-CD RTU has at least a 5\u03eb margin of safety (i.e., 10 mg/ kg) in dogs both clinically and pathologically. Alfaxalone was first introduced as a veterinary injectable anesthetic agent in combination with alfadalone as Saffan in 1971. Because the solubilizing agent, Cremaphor-EL, causes histamine release, Jurox Pty. Ltd. has developed a watersoluble formulation using 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (CD). The anesthetic drug formulation is marketed in Australia as Alfaxan-CD RTU for intravenous (2-5 mg/kg) and intramuscular (5-10 mg/kg) use for induction and maintenance of anesthesia in cats. The objective of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of Alfaxan-CD RTU when administered to six cats (3M/ 3F) subcutaneously at 10 mg/kg. Animals were administered acepromazine (1.1 mg/kg IM) 25 minutes prior to subcutaneous injection of Alfaxan-CD RTU in the right scapular area. Animals also received an equivalent volume of 0.9% NaCl in the left scapular region. Study parameters included clinical observations, body weight, mortality, physical examination, hematology and serum chemistry, anesthetic event times (onset and duration of recumbency, anesthesia, and nonresponsiveness to noxious stimuli), overall anesthetic score, injection site evaluation and gross examination of the injection site. Where appropriate, means and standard deviations were calculated and compared.",

Alfaxalone was first introduced into veterinary medicine in 1971 in combination with alfadalone as Saffan, an intravenous (IV) anesthetic agent with the excipient Cremophor-EL. However, adverse effects reported in the dog and cat were attributed to the release of histamine associated with the excipient, Cremophor-EL. Alfaxalone has recently been reformulated (Alfaxan-CD RTU, Jurox Pty Ltd, Rutherford, Australia) using only the alfaxalone active and with the much safer excipient, 2-hydroxypropyl-beta cyclodextrin.

The underlying pathophysiology of exercise-induced gastrointestinal disease remains unknown. The hydrogen breath test measures the hydrogen concentration in breath produced through microbial metabolism of orally administered carbohydrates in the intestine. Under physiologic conditions most orally administered carbohydrates are digested in the small intestine and do not reach the bacterial flora in the large intestine. Malabsorbed carbohydrates reach the colon and hydrogen is produced by mostly anaerobic bacteria. Previous studies report that the hydrogen breath test using a mixture of 4 sugars (xylose, lactulose, rhamnose, and 3-0-methylglucose) may be useful in the diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in dogs. Recently, serum and urinary recovery of 5 sugars (4 sugar solution plus sucrose) has been used as a marker for gastrointestinal permeability and intestinal absorptive function. It would be useful if both, permeability and breath hydrogen testing could be performed simultaneously. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate if addition of sucrose has an effect on breath hydrogen concentration compared to the previously used 4-sugar solution.",

Food was withheld for at least 17 hours before each study. Exhaled breath samples were collected with a close-fitting anesthesia face mask attached to a breath collection bag through a unidirectional valve. After collection of a baseline breath sample, the sugar solution was administered using a gastric feeding tube. Additional breath samples were collected 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, 195, 210, 225, 240, 270, 300, 330, 360, 390, 420, 450 , and 480 minutes after administration of the sugar solution.

However, this increase in peak occurs late and at time-points that have previously been shown to be past the normal oro-colonic transit time. Thus, these differences are most likely to be caused by colonic bacteria and thus should not affect diagnostic evaluation of the small intestine. Quantitative bacterial culture of duodenal juice is considered the gold standard for assessment of the small intestinal microflora. The technical difficulty of this procedure, however, limits its use in clinical practice. There is a need for a sensitive, specific, and non-invasive test that reflects the microflora of the small intestine in dogs. The 13 C-glycocholic acid (GCA) test relies on the deconjugation of the bile acid glycocholic acid by intestinal bacteria, with removal and metabolism of 13 C-glycine to 13 CO 2 , which enters the blood stream of the animal by passive diffusion. The aim of this study was to establish optimal doses and sampling times for the use of the GCA test as a marker for small intestinal bacterial biomass and metabolic activity in dogs.",

There was a sudden increase in the rate of accumulation of CUMPCD after 210 min for the 1 mg dose, suggesting a change in deconjugation kinetics possibly due to deconjugation of GCA by colonic bacteria. The time-point for the peak PCD showed a high degree of variation between dogs and doses. There was a significant correlation between the highest PCD and the CUMPCD at 180 min for the 2 mg/kg dose (r \u03ed 0.769, p \u03ed 0.025). The mean CUMPCD at 180 min was lower for the 2 mg/kg dose, suggesting saturation of the capacity of the intestinal microflora to deconjugate administered GCA. This difference, however, did not reach statistical significance (p \u03ed 0.264). We conclude that oral administration of 1 and 2 mg/kg of 13 C-glycocholic acid lead to a measurable increase in PCD and CUMPCD over time. Administration of 2 mg/kg of 13 C-glycocholic and determination of CUMPCD at 180 min showed the lowest degree of variation between dogs and is thus suggested for future clinical studies. Pepsinogen (PG) is the zymogen of the major proteolytic enzyme in gastric juice, pepsin. In human beings serum PG A is used as a marker for the diagnosis of specific disorders of the stomach. Recently, a radioimmunoassay for the measurement of feline pepsinogen A (fPG A) in serum has been developed and validated. Almost two thirds of serum PG A is cleared from the circulation by the kidneys. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the influence of experimentally-induced chronic renal failure (CRF) on serum fPG A concentrations in cats.",

Thus, renal function will need to be considered when assessing serum pepsinogen concentrations A in feline patients. The gut maintains a delicate balance between the downregulation of inflammatory reactions to the commensal bacteria and food antigens and the capacity to respond to pathogens with vigorous cellular and humoral immune responses. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) play an important role in sensing the external environment and communicating this information to the local immune system to effect appropriate responses. IECs possess many properties of cells of the innate immune system, in particular their ability to recognize and respond to microbial antigens. IEC recognition of microorganisms is based upon recognition of signature molecules on microorganisms called microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). MAMPs are shared by large groups of microorganisms, including peptidoglycans (PGs) found in most bacteria, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria. The response of IECs to microbial MAMPs is mediated by pattern recognition receptor (PRR) families of which two types have been identified: membrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic Nod1/ CARD4 and Nod2 that represent the intracellular counterparts of TLRs. The purpose of the studies reported here was to develop a method for the isolation and culture of a purified population of canine colonic epithelial cells which are capable of expressing PRRs.",

Most commonly detected were grippotyphosa and bratislava, which correlates with data from another investigation. Antibodies were detected in all age groups. Vaccination status was known in 41% of the seropositive dogs. Patterns of titers in vaccinates were difficult to interpret due to either lack of antibody response to some components of the vaccine, or to antibodies against non-vaccinate serovars. Feline infectious anemia is caused by at least two Mycoplasma species; Mycoplasma haemofelis and 'Candidatus M. haemominutum'. Although experimentally the organisms have been successfully transferred by a variety of routes, all natural modes of transmission for these organisms have yet to be elucidated. Blood-sucking arthropods have long been incriminated in the natural transmission of the disease, and recently, our experiments have shown that the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, can transfer M. haemofelis between cats during hematophagous activity. In those studies, the cats were unable to groom and ingest the fleas or flea excrement, a significant activity of cats with natural flea infestations. We hypothesize that the cat flea may transmit M. haemofelis when infected fleas or flea by-products are ingested, a transmission route known in other infectious diseases (e.g. Dipylidium caninum). The goal of this study was to determine whether M. haemofelis infection of previously na\u00efve cats could be initiated by the ingestion of infected fleas.",

Numerous genes of E. coli encode proteins putatively important to urovirulence, for example, adhesins and protectins. Human, canine, and feline urinary E. coli isolates have been characterized on the basis of their extended urovirulence genotypes in studies that typically test for the presence or absence of about 25 of these genes. It has been reported recently that extended urovirulence genotypes of canine and feline urinary E. coli isolates overlap with, and are essentially indistinguishable from, those of human strains that cause serious extraintestinal infections. On the basis of these and other phylogenetic findings, concern has been expressed that some canine and feline uropathogenic E. coli strains pose a significant human health hazard.

Student assessments of the comparative difficulties of the two jugular catheter placement techniques were not significantly different, and both techniques were assessed to be only slightly more difficult than placement of a cephalic catheter. Jugular catheter placement by either the modified Seldinger or through-theneedle technique can both be relatively easily mastered by entry level veteri-narians. The teaching of jugular catheter placement techniques is facilitated by the use of a synthetic jugular venipuncture model. Human serum albumin is occasionally used in hypoalbuminemic canine patients to increase albumin levels and hence colloid oncotic pressure. The assumption is that since there is significant amino acid homology among mammalian albumins, there is similar homology with regard to biochemical and physiologic functions. To test this hypothesis, selected characteristics (molecular weight, relative charge, and isoelectric point) from several mammalian species (human, dog, horse, pig, cow, rat and mouse) were determined using gel electrophoresis. Molecular weights were very similar with the exception of the canine albumin which was approximately 2 kDa greater than the other albumins examined. Differences existed between species with regard to relative charge and isoelectric point, especially in the case of the dog albumin which was relatively anionic. These biochemical differences despite high sequence homologies raise concern over the use of human serum albumin in canine patients. Further research investigating the potential antigenicity and efficacy of human albumin in the canine patient needs to be performed before this product can be safely recommended for routine use. Bronchoscopy and broncholaveolar lavage (BAL) have been shown to induce transient but significant airflow obstruction in healthy cats, which might be assessed by barometric whole body plethysmography (BWBP). Especially Penh (enhanced pause), an index of bronchoconstriction, is increased immediately after BAL in healthy cats. The purpose of this study was to test whether preventive administration of bronchodilators prior bronchoscopy in healthy and allergensensitised cats allowed to decrease post-BAL airflow obstruction.",

Recently, it was described that menatetrenone, a vitamin K2 analog, could develop differentiation of leukemic cell lines and apoptosis of immature blasts in human myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). To determine a possible role of this agent in treatment of feline MDS, we conducted a prospective trial to assess efficacy of menatetrenone.

One of the two dogs died from cardiac infarction and thromboembolism which may have been secondary to consumption of antithrombin from acute pancreatitis.",

Both cases of confirmed pancreatitis involved ESWL treatment of the left and right kidneys and/or proximal ureters. Due to the close anatomical proximity of the right lobe of the pancreas to the right kidney, ESWL treatment of the right kidney or ureter may result in shockwave induced injury to the pancreas. Extracorporeal blood purification techniques including hemoperfusion (HP) and hemodialysis (HD) can be used to remove toxins and drugs from the blood stream in the case of accidental exposure or overdose. Combination of sorbent HP (adsorption) and conventional HD (diffusion and convection) widens the spectrum of removable toxins to larger molecular weight solutes and molecules with different protein-binding characteristics. The efficacy and safety of combined HP/HD for toxin removal is demonstrated in a uremic cat with accidental enrofloxacin (ERF) overdosage.",

There were no significant changes in any hormone or protein concentration in dogs treated with deracoxib compared with placebo. Administration of aspirin, but not deracoxib, substantially decreases serum concentrations of T4, T3 and fT4. While the significant decrease in plasma proteins may account for a portion of the decrease in T4 and T3, it was not of sufficient magnitude to fully account for these decreases or the change in fT4. Hyperlipidemia refers to the presence of excess lipid in blood. Chronic hyperlipidemia may be due to a primary defect in lipid metabolism or secondary to an underlying systemic disease. Diseases associated with secondary hyperlipidemia include hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, cholestasis, and nephrotic syndrome. To determine the association of a history of chronic fasting hyperlipidemia with the occurrence of hypothyroidism, a database survey was conducted over a two-year period. Dogs with any illness (other than hypothyroidism) that could potentially be responsible for chronic hyperlipidemia were excluded. Results from 139,668 dogs not receiving thyroid supplement were reviewed. Of these, 2007 dogs had a history of chronic fasting hyperlipidemia, and 413 (20.6%) were determined to be hypothyroid based on low thyroid hormone concentrations and an elevation of thyroid stimulating hormone. Of 137,661 dogs with no history of chronic hyperlipidemia, 10,396 (7.6%) were determined to be hypothyroid. Using the Yates' Chi Square fitness test, a history of chronic fasting hyperlipidemia was significantly associated with hypothyroidism (p \u03ed 0). The odds ratio was 3.2, indicating that dogs with chronic hyperlipidemia were 3.2 times more likely to be hypothyroid than those with no history of chronic hyperlipidemia. The presence of thyroglobulin autoantibodies in hypothyroid dogs was not significantly associated with chronic hyperlipidemia, occurring at a similar incidence in hypothyroid dogs with (48%) or without (50%) a history of chronic hyperlipidemia. The possibility of hypothyroidism should be investigated in dogs with a history of chronic hyperlipidemia due to the increased risk of hypothyroidism associated with chronic hyperlipidemia. The etiopathogenesis of idiopathic hypercalcemia in cats is unknown, and abnormalities in calcium metabolic hormones may play a role. Excess concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D or calcitriol (1,25dihydroxyvitamin D) could potentially result in hypercalcemia in these cats. A total of 427 cases of suspected feline idiopathic hypercalcemia were reviewed. Cats ranged in age from 0.5 to 20 years old (mean 9.8 \u03ee 4.6 yr), and 27% were long-haired cats. A lack of clinical signs was noted in 196 cases (46%). Uroliths or renoliths were observed in 15%, and calcium oxalate stones were specifically noted in 10% of cases. Mild weight loss with no other clinical signs was found in 18% of cats. Chronic constipation was noted in 5% of cats, and inflammatory bowel disease was seen in 6% of cats with idiopathic hypercalcemia. Mean PTH concentration was 1.1 \u03ee 0.7 pmol/L (reference range 0-4.0 pmol/L) and mean ionized calcium concentration was 1.7 \u03ee 0.2 mmol/L (reference range 1.0-1.4 mmol/L). Parathyroid hormone related protein was analyzed in 301 cases, and was negative in all samples. Ionized magnesium analysis was available in 327 cases, with a mean of 0.6 \u03ee 0.1 mmol/L (reference range 0.43-0.70 mmol/L). Concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was determined in 65 cases, with a mean of 96.2 \u03ee 38.4 nmol/L, and ranged from 22 to 198 nmol/L (reference range 65-170 nmol/L). Calcitriol concentration was determined in 12 cases, with a mean of 44.6 \u03ee 12.4 pmol/L (reference range 50-100 pmol/L). Hypercalcemia is apparently not due to excessive PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D or calcitriol concentrations in cats with idiopathic hypercalcemia. Normal concentrations of ionized magnesium indicate that PTH secretion is not being inhibited by alterations in ionized magnesium. The prevalence of positive urine cultures was determined in cats with and without diabetes mellitus. Aerobic urine cultures, collected by cystocentesis, from patients at the UC Davis VMTH obtained between 1995 and 2002 were reviewed. Urine specific gravity (USG) was required for inclusion in the study. Cats were excluded if records indicated antibiotic use or urinary catheterizaton within two weeks of sample collection or a previous urethrostomy surgery. For cats with multiple urine cultures, the first culture was used in the study.",

The cats received an intravenous bolus of glucose (0.8 g/kg) at time 0 and of regular insulin (0.05 U/kg) at 20 minutes.

The MINMOD is a nonlinear 2-compartment model with 1 compartment models for glucose and insulin kinetics. The insulin compartment kinetics are described by its turnover rate constant P 2, which determines the lag associated with an insulin-induced increase in glucose disposal rate. Other parameters estimated were insulin sensitivity (S I , min \u03ea1 /(pmol/L) \u03eb 10 4 ) which quantifies the steady-state variation in glucose disappearance rate due to unitary increases in plasma insulin, and the glucose effectiveness (S G , min \u03ea1 ) which quantifies the fractional glucose clearance rate at basal insulin concentrations. From the zero-time intercept, it is possible to calculate an apparent initial glucose distribution volume (V G , dl/kg). Logarithmic transformations were used for P 2 , S I and S G , and a nonlinear mixed-effects model was used to simultaneously analyze all data sets (178 observations over 8 animals) and account for random variability.",

The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of glargine, a recombinant human insulin analogue, protamine zinc beef-pork insulin (PZI), and a purified pork lente insulin preparation were evaluated in 9 healthy neutered dogs (4 male, 5 female). Serial serum glucose and insulin concentrations were determined over a 24-hour period following subcutaneous administration of 0.5 U/kg bodyweight of each of the insulin preparations. The three insulin treatments were administered 3 days apart in a sequence that was randomly allocated in a crossover rotation. All results were expressed as mean \u03ee SEM and compared using AN-OVA. Significance was set at P \u03fd 0.05.",

The mechanisms of transformation and tumor progression currently are unknown. However, early ovariohysterectomy has been shown to be protective against the development of spontaneous mammary tumors. In humans, breast cancer is the number one cause of caner in females. Over 25% of human mammary tumors over-express the type 1 receptor tyrosine kinase, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In such tumors, over-expression of this receptor, which is activated ligand-independently, causes uncontrolled cell growth leading to tumor formation. Diagnosis of HER2positive mammary cancer is associated with poor prognosis. Recently, a humanized monoclonal antibody to HER2 (Herceptin, Trastuzumab) has shown promise in clinical treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer in humans. The present study was designed to investigate the role of over-expression of the feline homolog of HER2 in the progression of feline neoplasias, including mammary tumors. For this purpose, the feline ER2 cDNA was cloned using a low stringency reverse transcription on consensus ER2 sequence information (Genbank) obtained from known human, rat, mouse, and canine sequences. The feline sequence obtained was compared to the known sequences of ER2 cDNA and found to have 90% sequence homology to the canine. A highly homologous region of the sequence, 190 base pairs long, was used to design primers for use in real time RT-PCR in order to begin screening a variety of feline tissues and tumors for levels of ER2 expression. The feline neoplasias initially evaluated included mammary adenocarcinomas, fibrosarcomas, and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Analysis of most neoplasias indicated some level of ER2 expression. Ongoing work includes quantifying ER2 mRNA expression levels in normal and neoplastic tissue. The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted a new histological classification system for lymphoma in the dog. This classification system attempts to define distinct disease entities based upon morphology, immunophenotype, genetic and clinical features. In this study, we apply the new classification system to a large series of canine lymphoma biopsies. Pathology reports (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) from a commercial veterinary diagnostic laboratory were searched. 380 peripheral lymph node biopsies were identified from dogs that had a histological diagnosis of lymphoma, were retrievable, and contained sufficient tissue for tissue microarray (TMA) construction. TMAs were constructed from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using a manual arraying device (Beecher Instruments). Immunophenotyping was done using anti-CD3 (T-cell marker) and -CD79a (Bcell marker) antibodies. Histological classification using the revised (2003) WHO classification system was done by a single board-certified veterinary pathologist (VEV).",

Nucleic acids have advantages over other antigen forms in anti-tumor vaccines, as they are easily purified and replicated, encode multiple MHC class I and class II epitopes unrestricted by haplotype, and can provide long-lasting antigen expression. Although plasmid DNA vaccines are well-characterized, few reports have examined immunization with mRNA, which may be a safer means of cancer vaccination. In this study we investigated the hypotheses that 1) injection of mRNA encoding a model tumor-associated antigen (TAA) could prime specific CTL responses capable of protecting against tumor growth, and 2) coimmunization with TAA and co-stimulatory or cytokine mRNAs could potentiate CTL activity. C57BL/6 mice were injected intradermally (ID) or intravenously (IV) with cationic liposome-encapsulated, in vitro transcribed mRNA (0.3-4 g) encoding chicken ovalbumin (OVA). Specific CTL activity in spleen and lymph nodes was measured by in vitro europium-release assay, and by in vivo cytotoxicity assay. The anti-tumor effects of mRNA immunization were assessed with OVAexpressing tumors in protection (EG.7) and therapeutic (F10.9-OVA) models. To evaluate the potential adjuvant effects of co-administration of mRNAs encoding immunologically-active molecules, B7.1, IL-2, or GM-CSF mRNAs (1 g) were mixed with OVA mRNA prior to vaccination. We found that ID injection of liposome-encapsulated OVA, but not control, mRNA into the pinnae readily elicited CTL activity detectable in vitro and in vivo, and protected mice from EG.7 challenge. Further, growth of the melanoma F10.9-OVA was delayed in mice vaccinated with OVA mRNA 3 and 10 days after tumor injection. With IV immunization, a single injection of as little as 1 g of OVA mRNA primed CTL activity. Co-administration of OVA and GM-CSF mRNAs enhanced specific cytolytic responses 7 and 30 days after vaccination.",

Previously described CT abnormalities have included spondylosis deformans and osteophytosis as well as more subtle lesions such as bulging of the intervertebral disc. CT abnormalities, however, have been described in dogs without clinical evidence of neurologic disease. Similar observations made in our lab prompted us to examine recent data to determine the degree of IVD bulge in neurologically normal medium-sized dogs Twenty-two medium sized hound dogs between one and six years of age were included in the study. None of the dogs had any clinical evidence of lumbosacral (LS) disease and all were negative for inducible pain on palpation of the lumbosacral junction or dorsal elevation of the tail. Subsequently, the lumbosacral region of each dog was surgically explored as part of another study. In particular, surgeons noted any disc margin bulging or nerve root displacement. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Auburn University Ventrodorsal and lateral radiographs of the LS spine were made prior to computed tomography. For computed tomography (CT), the dogs were positioned in dorsal recumbency with the hindlimbs variably extended. CT was performed using a third generation CT scanner with technique settings of 120 kVp, 200 mA, 2.0 sec and small field-of-view. Contiguous transverse slices were obtained 1.5 mm apart with a tilt angle of 0 degrees.",

Using eight healthy cats, warfarin was orally administered at 0.05, 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg for 10 days. The blood was sampled from the jugular vein under isoflurane anesthesia before and 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days after the start of administration to determine PT, APTT, Fib, BT, ACT and CBC. The blood test was continued after discontinuation of warfarin until the result returned to the normal range. With the 0.05 mg/kg dosage, no change was observed in coagulation status or clinical signs. With the 0.1 mg/kg dosage, PT was significantly prolonged by 1.5 to 2-fold at 5 days post-administration. BT did not show a significant difference, while ACT was significantly prolonged. 0.2 mg/kg warfarin increased PT starting the next day, and was discontinued in 2 cats as PT reached 75 sec 5 days post-administration. Thus, we found that in cats 0.05 mg/ kg of warfarin was not sufficient, but 7-day administration of 0.1 mg/kg had a favorable anticoagulant effect. At 0.2 mg/kg, PT exceeded the detection limit in 2 cases, suggesting that we should be aware of possible adverse effects. This indicated that a PT measurement is recommended at 7 to 10 days of 0.05-0. There is no report in cats on the \u2424-blocking effect of Carvedilol (CAR). In this study, we report the \u2424-blocking effect of CAR in cats using seven clinically healthy adult cats (5 females and 2 males, 2.5-4.0 kg). After administration of placebo, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg of CAR, an isoproterenol infusion (0.04, 0.08 and 0.16 g/kg/min) was given at 3, 6, 12 and 24 hr to determine the \u2424-blocking effect. At the time of isoproterenol infusions, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the heart rate (HR) were measured via a catheter inserted to the femoral artery. In addition, at 0.08 g/kg/min of isoproterenol infusion at 3 hr after the administration of 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg of CAR, MAP and the left ventricular (LV) pressure were measured to calculate LV dP/dt. Significant differences (p \u03fd 0.05) in the blocking effect of CAR against \u2424-adrenergic stimuli by isoproterenol were observed until 12 hr after the administration of 0.1 mg/kg CAR and 24 hr after the 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg CAR. At 3 hr after the administration of 0.2 mg/kg CAR, elevation of HR and LV dP/dt in response to the \u2424-adrenergic stimuli of isoproterenol was suppressed, although there was no significant difference in MAP. Since the oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day CAR successfully blocked \u2424-adrenergic stimuli for 24 hr, 0.2 mg/kg/day may be clinically sufficient to maintain the \u2424-blockage. Because 0.2 mg/kg of CAR also suppressed the positive chronotropic and inotropic actions of isoproterenol, we suggest increasing the dosage gradually when administering to veterinary patients with cardiac failure. Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MVD) is a leading cause of heart disease in aging dogs. Therapy is directed at management of secondary congestive heart failure, not underlying mechanisms of valvular degeneration. Little is known about the cellular events that trigger and mediate MVD. Thus, we determined the cytoskeletal immunophenotype and proteolytic activity of heart valve interstitial cells (VIC) of mitral valves from apparently normal dogs (n \u03ed 4) and dogs with advanced MVD (n \u03ed 5). Mitral valves were collected post-mortem, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin for standard H&E histology and immunohistochemistry. A panel of monoclonal antibodies against cytoskeletal elements (\u2423-actin, vimentin, desmin, smooth muscle myosin and non-muscle myosin) were used to immunophenotype the VIC. Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and -13 (MMP-13) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry to determine functional changes in collagenase activity in VIC. Epitope retrieval methods included heat with or without incubation with a proteinase solution. VIC from normal mitral valves strongly expressed non-muscle myosin compared to VIC from myxomatous valves. VIC from myxomatous mitral valves strongly expressed \u2423-actin, desmin, smooth muscle myosin and MMP-1. VIC from normal and myxomatous valves stain equally for vimentin and MMP-13. In conclusion, MVD in dogs is associated with a shift in the cytoskeletal phenotype of VIC and an increase in cellular collagenase expression as evaluated by immunohistochemistry. These and other cellular changes may signal the presence of a myxomatous cellular phenotype and may be used in the future to investigate triggering mechanisms of MVD.",

QRS in leadII in normal mixed-breed dogs was divided into qR, QR, qRS, and QRs in SLLS, and QR was predominant. On the other hand, it was divided in qR, R, RS and qRS in NLS wherein RS was predominant. In SLLS of pug dogs, it was classified into QR, qRs, and QRs, whereas all the 4 dogs were RS in NLS. SLLS and NLS of the ECG were recorded with 12 dogs which were diagnosed as heart worm disease, 10 dogs diagnosed as mitral regurgitation, and 2 dogs diagnosed as dilated cardiomyopathy. QRS was divided in qR and QR in SLLS of MR, wherein NLS, it was classified broadly in R and Rsr\u0408. In SLLS of heart worm disease, 5 dogs were RS, 2 dogs were Rsr\u0408, and the others showed various patterns. On the other hand, 11 dogs were RS and 1 dog was RSr\u0408 in NLS, and appearance ratio of RS was significantly high (p \u03fd 0.05).

So, it was also concluded as a safe and feasible test to be performed in dogs. Exercise stress tests have been routinely used in human being to make the heart overwork. Thus, it is possible to non-invasively detect and functionally assess ischemic diseases that were imperceptible during rest. However, some patients are unable to perform adequate exercise due to debility or neurologic deficits, among others. Such patients can undergo stress testing by the use of drugs that cause an overwork to the heart. Amongst several available drugs, dobutamine has emerged as a good choice for stress tests due to the predominant augmentation of myocardial contractility with minimal effects on systemic pressure.",

This may be probable due to a misbalance in its beta-2 and alpha-1 agonist effects, which might be dangerous in some patients that can not face a drop in arterial pressure. Concerning the echocardiographic parameters, the augmentation of myocardial contractility resulted in good increase of ejection fraction. However, it was not enough to increase cardiac output, which remained stable along the infusion of dobutamine. Thus, dobutamine stress test seem to be a feasible and safe test to be performed in dogs and could help in diagnosing cardiac changes when the disease it is not completely settled yet. Platelets are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology and progression of heart disease in dog and man. Activation of platelets can predispose to thromboembolic events and release proinflammatory and vasoactive substances. Shear stress has, on the other hand, been shown to deactivate and exhaust platelets and the high shear hemodynamics of aortic valve stenosis has been shown in humans to cause a decrease in platelet function and subsequent bleeding tendencies. Decreased platelet function has previously been reported in dogs with asymptomatic and symptomatic mitral regurgitation.

Sixty adult dogs (males and females) were divided into three groups depending on body weight: GI \u03ed less than 10 kg; GII \u03ed 10 to 24 kg; GIII \u03ed 25 kg or more. The dogs were conducted on a leash by one of the authors or by the owner, walking for 6 minutes in a 50 meter hallway, marked every 2 meters. The dogs walked on their own pace, only guided by the conductor. The test was repeated on different days and the average distance was used for analysis. Morphometric variables were measured [as nose-to-tail length (L), height (H), thorax (TD) and abdomen (AD) diameters, rotula-to-heel distance (RH) etc.]. HR and RR were measured before the test, right after and 5 minutes later. To evaluate the effect of gender and size on the walked distance, two-way ANOVA was applied. Forward Stepwise Regression Analysis was used to evaluate the morphometric variables influencing the distance walked. There was a strong and significant correlation (p \u03fd 0.05) between body size and the distance walked in six minutes. A linear regression equation was obtained (Distance \u03ed 55,3 \u03e9 8,3 TD \u03e9 0,9 L \u03e9 2,1 RH; r 2 \u03ed 0.73; r \u03ed 0.85) to predict the distance walked in relation to morphometric variables. No effect of gender was observed on the distance walked. There was no variation in the distance walked in different days associated to groups. The HR and RR were higher after the walk test and decreased after five minutes of rest, as expected. In conclusion, the distance walked in 6 minutes was related to body size and 73% of variability in the distance walked was explained by thorax diameter, body length and rotulato-heel distance. The test was repeatable and should be useful in estimating exercise intolerance in dogs. The QT interval, which represents ventricular depolarization and repolarization period, has clinical and toxicological importance, since QT prolongation not unrelated to heart rate (HR) predisposes to arrhythmias due to electrical instability, and may lead to sudden death. There is controversy regarding QT correction in humans, even considering the great number of studies in this subject, although most studies use Bazett's or Fridericia's formulas. Despite some studies on the relation between HR and QT interval in dogs, the different approaches lead to variable results, what increases the need for more research to determine the best way to calculate QTc in this specie. Crescent doses of atropine (6 g/ kg, 12 g/kg, 24 g/kg and 40 g/kg IV) and propranolol (20 g/kg to 120 g/kg IV) were used in order to study the relation between QT and RR interval. Sixteen mature mongrel dogs (8 M, 8 F, 5-12 Kg) were used. Dogs were kept in right lateral recumbency and computerized ECGs were recorded at baseline, during atropine and propranolol infusions, and after atropine associated with propranolol. For different heart rates obtained with the protocol, QT intervals were measured on screen, considering the end of the T wave where it crossed baseline. The average of three consecutive QT intervals was used for the mean RR interval of the period (mean HR) to avoid errors due to sinus arrhythmia. Linear, logarithmic, polynomial, power and exponential equations were obtained from the relation between RR and QT intervals. The curvilinear equations showed stronger and significant correlation (P \u03fd 0,0001). Linear regression also showed good correlations, probably because the curve has a significant linear portion. The results suggest that the relationship between RR and QT intervals after pharmacological autonomic tone variation follows a curve more than a line, indicating that linear formulas are not the most indicated for QT normalization in dogs.",

Mean ages (in years) for the three groups were 3, 4, and 3 years, respectively. Echocardiograms were obtained in left lateral recumbency without sedation. Pulsed wave Doppler recordings of mitral and tricuspid inflow and of aortic and pulmonic ejection were acquired with an ECG at 200 mm/s sweep speed. Prejection period (PEP), ejection time (ET), PEP/ET, and IMP for both the right ventricle (RV) and the left ventricle (LV) were determined from 5 consecutive beats. IMP was calculated as: {(isovolumetric contraction \u03e9 isovolumetric relaxation)/ET}. Differences in mean RV and LV variables for all 27 dogs were identified by paired t-test and differences across the three arbitrary weight groups were identified by one-way ANOVA. The relationship between RV IMP and body weight, age, heart rate, PEP, ET and PEP/ET was explored by linear regression. Significance was set at alpha \u03ed 0.05.",

Mean (\u03eeSD) of heart rate during measurements of IMP and systolic time intervals were 98 (\u03ee17)/min for the RV and 96 (\u03ee21)/min for the LV. Linear regression did not identify a clinically relevant correlation between right ventricular IMP and body weight, heart rate, or between RV or LV ET, PEP or PEP/ET. A significant difference was observed between the three arbitrary weight groups for body weight, PEP (LV and RV) and PEP/ET (LV and RV), but not for age, heart rate, ET (RV or LV) or IMP (RV or LV). We conclude that the IMP for the RV is relatively independent of body weight and heart rate within the ranges studied, and is consistently lower than values derived from the LV in healthy dogs. These data provide initial reference values for the canine RV and emphasize the need for using specific right ventricular values for identification of RVD in dogs.",

Further genetic and pathologic studies need to be done to completely understand the CTD in the Border Terrier breed. Circulating cardiac enzymes are non invasive markers of cardiomyocyte injury. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is the most sensitive and specific marker, however in human medicine cTnI is often evaluated with other markers such as myoglobin (MG) and CK-MB. Several studies have reported reference ranges for cardiac troponin I in normal dogs and cats, however results are specific to each analyzer and analyzers are expensive.

Mean ABP decreased by 25 mm Hg at the highest dose (p \u03fd .001). The PR interval increased minimally (p \u03ed .036) and inconsistently. However, atrioventricular or sinoatrial blocks were observed consistently at the two highest doses. At these doses, diltiazem plasma concentrations averaged 720 \u03ee 43 ng/ml and 874 \u03ee 113 ng/ml, respectively. Diltiazem plasma concentrations at each treatment period varied considerably among horses. One horse developed high-degree sinus arrest with signs of hypotension. No other adverse effects were noted in any of the horses. These data indicate that diltiazem, dosed at 1 to 2 mg/kg intravenously, depresses sinus and AV nodal function in healthy horses at plasma concentrations between 700 and 1000 ng/ml. Effective doses may vary among horses, and may be limited by hypotension caused by peripheral vasodilation or bouts of bradycardia. Presumably the slight increase in mean HR observed at the higher doses was caused by activation of the baroreceptor reflex, which mitigated some of the depressant effects of diltiazem on nodal tissues, but did not prevent periods of sinus arrest or atrioventricular block. The ultimate cardiovascular effects of diltiazem are likely mediated by competing actions: direct drug depression on cardiac and vascular calcium entry countered by reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system in response to falling ABP. Further studies are needed to investigate diltiazem pharmacokinetics and drug effects on ventricular function, central hemodynamics, peripheral vascular resistance, and peripheral blood flow. In critical care, reliable and fast patient-side analysis of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets is essential for appropriate diagnosis and clinical management.

With its high accuracy, it proved to be a useful and reliable tool for the veterinary practice dealing with haematology in horses. Previous immunological studies demonstrated that the equine fetus is able to generate an antigen specific immune response, and considered the foal immunocompetent at birth. However, the susceptibility to certain organisms in early life suggests limitations in the immune system of the equine neonate. This study describes additional information regarding the activation and maturation status of the immune system of the foal at birth. Peripheral blood samples from 11 normal foals were collected within 1 hour of birth and before the ingestion of colostrum for serum immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymphoid tissues of 6 normal foals of less than 2 hours of age were tested for the expression of cell markers and cytokines. Samples from 6 normal adult horses were tested in parallel for comparison. Serum Ig isotype levels were measured using ELISA. The expression of cell-surface Ig isotypes and clusters of differentiation in mesenteric lymph node, spleen and thymus was tested using immunohistochemistry. The mRNA expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and II (MHC I and MHC II) and beta-2 microglobulin (b2M) molecules in spleen, lymph node and thymus was measured using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The mRNA expression of cytokines in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, spleen and lymph nodes was tested using quantitative real-time PCR.",

Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) knockout (GKO) and immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice were infected simultaneously with the same inoculum as controls. Using a direct agglutination test, all C57BL/6 and GKO knockout infected mice seroconverted to S. neurona merozoite antigens by day 14 postinfection (PI). However, B-cell deficient (uMT mice) did not seroconvert. GKO infected mice, which were euthanized by day 28 post-infection (PI), developed encephalitis, confirming activity of the S. neurona merozoites. B-cell deficient (uMT) mice developed mild splenomegaly and bilateral symmetrical lymphadenopathy by day 14 PI, which completely resolved by day 60 PI. All uMT infected mice survived until day 60 PI, at which time they were euthanized. Histopathologic changes at day 14 PI revealed mild to moderate multifocal cellular infiltrates in the liver, and mild increase in follicles without germinal center development in the spleens. Changes had resolved by day 60 PI. Flow cytometry was used to correlate gross and histopathological changes with changes in immune cell subsets. B-cell staining confirmed the lack of B-cells in peripheral blood, spleen and lymph nodes. At day 14 in the blood, there was a mild increase in the percentage of CD4 cells present, and by day 60 there was an increased percentage of CD4, CD8 and memory CD44/CD4 and CD44/CD8 cells present. There was an increased percentage of CD4 cells and CD44/CD8 memory cells present in the spleen at day 60 PI. In summary, we propose that in this mouse model, humoral immunity is not critical to protection against S. neurona infection. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of two disinfectants when used in footbaths for reducing bacterial contamination of footwear. Materials and Methods: New rubber boots were used for the study after they were cleaned and disinfected with 70% ethanol. Boots were contaminated using a standardized process; an investigator wearing rubber boots walked in a serpentine pattern for 2 minutes through straw bedding in a stall contaminated through routine stabling of an adult cow. Footbaths were filled with the same volume of freshly diluted disinfectant solution such that there was approx. 4 in of disinfectant standing in the tubs. Disinfectant solutions were prepared using the manufacturer's instructions. The following disinfectants were used: quaternary ammonium (A464N [mixture of methyl ammonium compounds], Airkem Professional Products) and a peroxygen compound (Virkon-S [potassium peroxymonosulfate], Antec International). Tap water was used as a control treatment for comparison. Samples were collected for analysis using sterile swabs pre-moistened with broth containing neutralizers for common disinfectants and swabbing 4 marked areas (20 cm \u03eb 1 cm) on each boot. Pre-disinfection bacterial counts were estimated by sampling sites on one boot immediately after contamination. The other boot was placed in the footbath for approximately 3 sec. Post-disinfection sampling was performed on the second boot 7 min after stepping out of the footbath. Ten pairs of boots were sampled for each type of solution tested. Swabs were placed in 10 ml of the sterile broth containing disinfectant neutralizers and held at room temperature until processed. Surface bacterial load was quantified by making serial dilutions and plating to blood agar and MacConkey's agar. Plates were incubated for 24 hr at 37\u040aC, colonies were counted, and results were expressed as colony forming units (CFU) per cm 2 . Differences between treatments were analyzed using regression analysis. Statistical analyses used GEE to control for the hierarchical and repeated nature of the data. Least square means and variance estimates for log 10 bacterial counts were determined from these models and used to compare differences associated with the experimental treatments. Results: There was no statistically detectable reduction in bacterial counts from boots after A464N treatment, while more than 70% reduction in bacterial counts was observed after treatment with Virkon-S. There was a detectable increase in bacterial counts on control boots treated with water compared to pre-disinfections counts on untreated boots. Conclusion: Results of this study suggest that Virkon-S is superior to A464N when used in footbaths for rapid disinfection of footwear in a veterinary hospital. This assumes that large amounts of gross fecal contamination typically will not be found on the surface of footwear in veterinary hospital environments. Objective: To characterize the risk of shedding Salmonella enterica among large animal patients admitted to the James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital (JLV-VTH) at Colorado State University. Design: Prospective longitudinal study. Procedures: Fecal samples were obtained from all large animal patients admitted to the JLV-VTH for \u05461 day between July 1, 2002, and July 21, 2003 , and cultured to identify Salmonella enterica. Samples were collected at the time of admission, and every Mon, Wed, and Fri throughout hospitalization. Antimicrobial susceptibility and serogroup and serotpye of Salmonella isolates were evaluated. Patient signalment and hospitalization information was collected from medical records. Information was also collected regarding each patients' health and management during the 48 hrs preceding each sample collection, including categorical assessment of the patients' overall systemic illness status, soft fecal consistency or diarrhea, fever, leukopenia, anesthesia or surgery, antimicrobial therapy, significant reduction in dietary intake, body systems affected, stabling location when sampled, and attending hospital service. Factors potentially associated with Salmonella shedding were analyzed using logistic regression, using generalized estimating equations to control for repeated sampling of horses. Factors associated with the likelihood of Salmonella recovery in univariable models (P \u03fd 0.20) were included in multivariable modeling, using backward stepping to determine which variables were retained in the final model (P \u03fd 0.10). Results: A total of 3,504 samples were submitted from 1,417 patients (1,508 separate admissions) as a part of the surveillance program (average \u03ed 2.5 samples per animal, median \u03ed 2, range 1-73). Salmonella was recovered from 3.5% of samples (124/3504), and 5.5% of patients (77/1396). The patient characteristic most strongly associated with increased rates of Salmonella recovery was the subjective characterization of severity of patients' systemic illness, regardless of which body systems were affected. Diarrhea occurring within 48 hrs of sampling was also associated with an increased rate of Salmonella recovery, but having other GI disease was not. After controlling for these clinical factors, bovine patients, older patients, and patients housed in isolation were more likely to shed Salmonella, which is consistent with prior conceptions regarding shedding risk at the JLV-VTH as indicated by our existing empirical Salmonella control procedures. It is also interesting to note variables that were not retained in the final model, such as fever, leukopenia, history of anesthesia or surgery, reduction in feed intake, body system affected, and gender. Conclusions: Salmonella infections represent a major risk to the JLV-VTH. In general, food animal and equine patients are segregated, as are patients with gastrointestinal disease. Additional biosecurity precautions should be used with patients having moderate or major systemic illness or diarrhea. Reliance upon these factors alone did not fully predict Salmonella shedding in this population. Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent for Lyme disease, infects a wide range of mammalian hosts. Serological studies in horses indicate that incidence of Equine Borrelia infection to be increasing in the northeastern United States, the Midwest, Texas and California. Clinical disease in horses has been associated with lameness, stiffness, joint swelling, lethargy, fever, weight loss, uveitis, and potentially with neurologic disease and foal mortality.",

In monogastric species the systemic availability of ingested nutrients is dependent upon the rate of gastric emptying (GE). In human subjects, GE is faster after ingestion of a solution containing glucose and a medium chain fatty acid (MCFA) when compared to glucose alone. Conversely, long chain fatty acids slow GE of a glucose solution. Currently, there is little information regarding the effects of dietary fat on the rate of GE in horses. The objectives of the present study were to: 1) determine the effects of fatty-acid chain length (short, C3; medium, C8; long, C16-18) on the rate of GE after administration of a glucose solution to horses; and 2) evaluate the effects of these fatty acid treatments on glycemic response, an indicator of systemic glucose availability.",

Insulin sensitivity, defined as the capacity of insulin to promote glucose disposal, is affected by several factors. Age, gender, diet, obesity and physical fitness (aerobic capacity) are all factors that influence insulin sensitivity in human subjects.

After the adaptation period, in vivo insulin sensitivity was assessed by measurement of glucose disposal during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (EHC). For the EHC, insulin was infused at a rate of 3.0 U/kg/min for 180 min with a variable rate of glucose infusion (50% dextrose) to maintain whole blood glucose concentrations at approximately 5 mmol/L.

Computer assisted learning (CAL) is a relatively new approach to teaching that is being increasingly used in veterinary medicine. It has potential advantages to teaching techniques including reducing the number of animals used for demonstration, improving animal welfare, the ability to present complex audio and visual materials, self directed learning and unobstructed material presentation. Potential problems include a lack of reality and immediacy. Traditional teaching has potential advantages of reality, immediacy, bonding with a live instructor, and the opportunity to ask a wide range of questions. However, a student's view may be obstructed in large groups and the instructor determines the rate and direction of learning. With a computer assisted module a more time consuming effort is made initially but future preparation time can be reduced. A computer assisted nasogastric intubation learning module was developed that included sections on indications, equipment, anatomy, performing the procedure, common errors and complications. Each section consisted of a text supplemented with video clips of internal and external views, audio, still photographs, or illustrations.",

The traditional group (TM) was instructed how to pass a NG tube using traditional methods, with an instructor explaining the concept and performing a live demonstration. The students in the self learning computer module (SLCM), were given a CD rom, which they studied for the same amount of time as the traditional group. The students were then united in one session to practice passing the NG tube. Every student was expected to perform the procedure. The students were given a knowledge quiz and a questionnaire about their level of comfort and confidence with the teaching method. The data were analyzed by non parametric tests. The students in the SLCM group performed better on the test of knowledge (P \u03fd 0.001), median scores out of 10, were 9.67 and 8.1, for SCLM and TM respectively. In the questionnaire, which was graded on a likert scale (0-5), they felt that they learnt more with the SCLM (P \u03fd 0.001), median scores were 4.0 and 3.0, for SCLM and TM, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups in their feeling of being prepared to perform the procedure, or their feeling of understanding of the procedure. Computer assisted learning in passing the NG tube seems to be an acceptable and effective method to train students with potential welfare and knowledge advantages. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially fatal pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle elicited by exposure to volatile anesthetics, depolarizing muscle relaxants and stress. Most cases of human and all cases of porcine and canine MH are associated with mutations in the skeletal muscle isoform of the ryanodine receptor (RyR1). Since the introduction of inhalation anesthesia in the horse in the 1970's, several horses with suspected MH episodes have been reported but never genetically confirmed. The purpose of our study is to determine if mutations in the candidate gene RyR1 are associated with MH in the horse. Two Quarter Horses that underwent halothane anesthesia with no pre-medication for other research purposes, exhibited a fatal MH episode clinically comparable to those observed in other species. Both cases developed hyperthermia, hypercapnia, lactic acidosis, and muscle rigidity. Multiple muscle biopsies were collected for histochemistry, genetic, functional and expression analysis. Mild non specific myopathic changes were observed on histochemistry. DNA sequencing revealed a common polymorphism that resulted in an amino acid change in these two horses ( MH RyR1); the polymorphism was not observed in 80 breed-matched controls ( WT RyR1). Screening tests were developed for detection of heterozygous and homozygous individuals. There were no differences between MH RyR1 and WT RyR1 in activation by caffeine and calcium, and inhibition by calcium and magnesium under physiological buffer conditions. However, the affinity to [ 3 H]ryanodine of MH RyR1 was significantly higher than WT RyR1. Western blot analysis showed no difference in expression levels of MH RyR1 and WT RyR1. This is the first report of equine MH associated with a mutation in the RyR1 gene. Traditional acid-base interpretation has relied heavily on the Henderson Hasselbalch equation and has largely ignored the importance of relative electrolyte concentration and protein concentration in the determination of acid-base balance and anion gap assessment.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the pharmacokinetics of oncedaily amikacin in clinically healthy and hospitalized equine neonates, and to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of amikacin against Gram-negative isolates obtained from blood cultures collected from equine neonates. Mean half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution (Vd) after administration of a single intravenous bolus of amikacin (25 mg/kg) to 5 healthy 2to 3-day-old foals were 5.08 h, 1.76 ml/min/kg, and 0.773 L/kg, respectively. There was a statistically significant decrease in area under the curve, mean residence time, and trough plasma amikacin concentrations between 2-to 3-dayold foals and the same foals at 10-to 11 days of age. Forty-nine hospitalized foals were studied. Eight hospitalized foals were premature, 10 were hypoxemic, 28 were septic, and 19 did not fall within any of these categories. Amikacin concentrations were measured 0.5 h (peak) and 24 h (trough) post-administration. The median age at time of measurement of amikacin peak and trough concentrations was 3 days (range 1-15 days). The median duration of amikacin therapy was 6 days (range 3-23 days). The median dose of amikacin administered was 23.5 mg/kg (range 16.7-28.0 mg/kg). There was a positive correlation between amikacin dose and peak amikacin concentration as well as between amikacin dose and Vd. There was no correlation between other pharmacokinetic variables and age, dose of amikacin, creatinine concentration, BUN, sepsis score, or dose number. Hospitalized foals had significantly lower peak plasma amikacin concentrations and lower volume of distribution than healthy foals. Sepsis, prematurity, and hypoxemia did not alter the disposition of once-daily amikacin. MIC at which 90% of all Gram-negative isolates from equine neonatal blood cultures were inhibited by amikacin was 4 g/ml, suggesting that peak amikacin concentrations of 40 g/ml should be targeted to achieve recommended peak/MIC ratio of 10:1. The proportion of foals with peak serum concentration \u0546 40 g/ ml was significantly higher in foals receiving a dose \u03fe23.5 mg/kg (median dose: 25 mg/kg; 22/24 or 92%) than in foals receiving a dose \u03fd23.5 mg/kg (median dose 21 mg/kg; 9/25 or 36%) while there was no difference in the proportion of foals with trough concentrations \u05463 g/ml between the 2 groups. Based on the results of this study, an initial dose of 25 mg/kg would be recommended for once-daily amikacin in sick equine neonates. Therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed to allow individual adjustment of dose and dosing interval. Itraconazole is an oral triazole antifungal drug used for the treatment of infections caused by Aspergillus sp., Histoplasma sp., and Blastomyces sp. in humans and animals. Itraconazole is extremely lipophilic and has a very high affinity for tissues, including lung, kidney, brain, skin and esophageal tissue, with concentrations often higher in the tissue than in plasma. Fungal infections can be difficult to treat and often have devastating consequences. Very few systemic antifungal drugs have been studied in the horse, so treatment options are limited. Itraconazole at a dose of 3 mg/kg orally, twice a day has been recommended for the treatment of fungal diseases in horses, but no pharmacokinetic data is available. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that itraconazole will be absorbed after oral administration in horses and exhibit a long half-life to allow for intermittent dosing to produce therapeutic concentrations for the treatment of fungal diseases.",

Population pharmacokinetics of marbofloxacin were investigated on 21 healthy and 16 diseased horses to assess interindividual variability of drug exposure. Demographic, physiologic and disease covariables were tested using mixed effects models. As a preliminary analysis, this study has demonstrated that none of the tested covariables were significant in regression models of compartmental volumes or distribution clearance, but the clinical status of the horse (healthy/ diseased) was a significant covariable (p \u03fd 0.01) for systemic clearance. Clearance had a lower mean and a higher variance for diseased horses than healthy horses, with respectively a mean of 0.209 and 0.284 L/h/kg and a coefficient of variation of 52% and 15%. Consequently, variability of AUC was greater in diseased horses. Considering an AUC/MIC ratio below 60h as a prediction of poor efficacy, a dosage regimen of 2 mg/kg intravenous was deemed to be inadequate for 19% of diseased horses if the MIC of the bacteria was 0.1 g/mL (sensitivity breakpoint). However 93% of diseased horses could achieve a ratio above 125h, predicting a very good efficacy, for the MIC 90 of Enterobacteriacae (0.027 g/mL). These data, which should be validated with a larger group of horses, suggest that the use of marbofloxacin is reliable for treatment of Enterobacteriacae-related diseases in horses with a 2 mg/kg dosage regimen.",

Oral use of PBZ solution allows for exact dosage of horses weighing less than 150 kg. Increased accuracy decreases risk for overdosage and toxicosis that exists with common oral formulations such as paste, powder, gel, or tablet. We hypothesized that oral administration of the same PBZ dose to fasted horses would yield statistically equivalent Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, and AUC values for both formulations. Horses (n \u03ed 6) were weighed, fasted, and orally dosed with solution or paste (control) at 2.2 mg/kg BWT. Blood was collected at time 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 8, 12 , and 24 hours post-administration (HPA). After a 14 day washout period, horses were fasted, dosed with the opposite formulation, and sampled as described. Serum samples underwent solid-phase acid extraction and quantification by high performance liquid chromatography. Cmax values for paste (7.35 g/mL) differed significantly (P \u03fd 0.05) from injectable (5.65 g/mL). Tmax values for paste (4.97 HPA) and injectable (3.03 HPA) did not differ significantly. AUC for paste (101.75) was 30% greater than AUC for injectable (67.09). T1/2 for both formulations occurred at 12 HPA. The results indicate that oral absorption of both PBZ formulations is highly variable when compared to the literature. Oral administration of PBZ (20%) solution is an accurate route of administration for horses weighing less than 150 kg; more work needs to be done to determine the dose that will yield Cmax and AUC values equal to PBZ paste. Prior work reported that NaHC0 3 administration exaggerates exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia during submaximal and maximal exertion of racehorses (Equine Veterinary Journal 25:125-129, 1993) . However, these studies did not quantify the effect of alkalosis on arterial hemoglobin-0 2 saturation. These observations are in sharp contrast with findings in human subjects exercising after administration of NaHCO 3 , wherein exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia is largely unaffected, but the associated alkalosis helps limit the desaturation of arterial hemoglobin. An exaggeration of exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia following NaHCO 3 administration to horses may adversely affect O 2 supply, and in turn, athletic performance.",

Blood-gas/acid-base variables were examined at rest and during incremental exercise leading to 120 s of galloping at 14 m/s on a 3.5% uphill grade, which elicited maximal heart rate and induced pulmonary hemorrhage in all horses in both treatments.",

During maximal exercise in both treatments, significant arterial hypoxemia, desaturation of hemoglobin, hypercapnia, acidosis, hyperthermia and hemoconcentration developed. Although the extent of exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia was similar, there was a significant attenuation of the desaturation of arterial hemoglobin in the NaHCO 3 treated horses, which had significantly higher arterial pH. Despite these observations, the arterial O 2 content of exercising horses was significantly less in the NaHCO 3 experiments because of the hemodilution, and a significant attenuation of the exercise-induced expansion of the arterial to mixed-venous blood O 2 content gradient was observed.",

Differentiating RAO, inflammatory airway disease (IAD), and normal horses can be challenging based on clinical signs and routine laboratory data. Percent neutrophils (PMNs) in BALF have been the gold standard used to differentiate (RAO) horses, normal horses and horses with (IAD). Some horses do not fit clearly into a category based strictly on percent PMNs and clinical signs.

EIPH is observed in the majority of racehorses, and is thought to contribute to decreased athletic performance. Studies have shown that one of the major factors in the development of EIPH is very high pulmonary vascular pressures that occur during intense exercise. We have shown that this treatment combination (type V phosphodiesterase inhibitor, E4021, followed by inhaled nitric oxide) reduces both pulmonary artery pressures and EIPH in Thoroughbred horses during highspeed treadmill exercise.

Fourteen unconditioned Standardbred horses (8 mares, 6 geldings, 2-5 years of age) were studied. During a 4-wk pre-test period, horses were adapted to a diet of forage cubes (fed at approximately 2% BW), and provided with freechoice water and salt. Following this baseline period, insulin sensitivity was assessed via an EHC in which insulin was infused at a rate of 3.0 U/kg/min for 180 min with a variable rate of glucose infusion (50% dextrose) designed to maintain whole blood glucose concentrations at approximately 5 mmol/L. The mean glucose infusion rate (GIR) during the final 90-min period of the EHC was calculated and used as an index of Si. Horses were then randomly assigned to one of two groups",

Muscle strips from CH and LH of ten non-gravid female horses were suspended in tissue baths and connected to force-displacement transducers interfaced with a physiograph. The strips were incubated for 45-minutes with no antagonist (control), BQ-123, IRL-1038, or BQ-123 \u03e9 IRL-1038 at 3 different concentrations (10 \u03ea9 , 10 \u03ea7 , and 10 \u03ea5 M) before concentration-response curves to ET-1 were generated. The contractile response to cumulative concentrations of ET-1 (10 \u03ea9 to 10 \u03ea6 M) was quantified by measuring change in area under the curve (AUC) for the 3-minute period following each ET-1 dose. The EC 50 of ET-1 for the control, BQ-123, IRL-1038, and BQ-123 \u03e9 IRL-1038 were determined for CH and LH at each blocker concentration. Endothelin-1 caused concentration-dependent contraction of CH and LH. Response to BQ-123 and IRL-1038 supports the existence of ET A and ET B receptors within the equine myometrium",

Approximately 14% (19/140) of vaccinated horses in the fall of 2002 and 27% (24/84) of horses in the spring of 2003 did not develop a neutralizing antibody response. It appears that a portion of the vaccinated horses failed to make a detectable neutralizing antibody response.

We evaluated the effects of centrifugation and of time at room temperature on the pH, PO 2 , PCO 2 , and lactate and HCO 3 concentrations of PE.Eleven dogs underwent pericardiocentesis for treatment of PE. For each dog, PE was divided into 2 aliquots. The first aliquot was whole effusion (WE). It was immediately fractionated into 6 samples that were analyzed 15, 30, 60, 180, 360, and 720 minutes after collection while the second aliquot was centrifuged (10 minutes) and the S fractionated into 5 samples that were analyzed at 30, 60, 180, 360, and 720 minutes after collection. All samples were contained in heparinized, capped, sterile, plastic syringes at room temperature, and all analyses were performed on a portable blood gas and lactate analysis instrument (I-Stat [Heska Corp]). ANOVA was used to compare samples between groups and over time. Results were considered significant if p \u03fd 0.05.All PEs were grossly hemorrhagic. Comparing groups, mean values for pH (figure), PO 2 , and PCO 2 differed significantly between the WE and S groups at all time points measured (PO 2 : S group higher; PCO 2 : WB group higher). Mean lactate concentration in the WE and S groups was similar initially (30, 60 min) but differed thereafter (significantly higher in the WE group). Mean HCO 3 concentration was not significantly different between groups at any time. Over time, mean pH (figure), PO 2 , and PCO 2 measurements were not significantly different at 60 min compared to 30 min, but measurements at 180, 360, and 720 min were significantly different from measurements at 30 min for all 3 analysis categories in both the WE and S groups. There was no significant difference in HCO 3 concentration over time in either group.These results mirror those obtained from previous studies using whole blood and represent additional variables to be addressed in studies that evaluate these biochemical parameters in dogs with PE.",

            "text": "The camelid ''stomach'' consists of 3 compartments, the first of which (C1) holds the largest volume and is responsible for primary fermentation of cellulose. The third compartment (C3) is a tubular structure which has a parietal component that secretes hydrochloric acid. Ulceration of the C3 compartment has been reported in several species of Camilidae. Pathogenesis is not completely understood, but mucosal injury from hydrochloric acid is considered to have a role. It has been suggested that clinical signs improved after orally-administered omeprazole, but absorption of drug after oral administration of the veterinary product Gastrogard has not been demonstrated in camelids. The pharmacokinetics of omeprazole after oral administration of Gastrogard to dromedaries at a dose of 4 mg/kg were characterized in this study. Five adult dromedaries were used. Animals were fed 3 kg of wheat straw, 2 kg of alfalfa hay, and 2 kg barley, then feed was withheld 19 hours before Gastrogard was given. Blood samples were taken at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , and 10 hours after administration. Omeprazole in plasma was measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Omeprazole appeared in plasma within 30 minutes. Elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) was 1.8 \u03ee 0.5 hours. Two peaks were present in the plasma concentration-time profiles for each of the five animals (T max1 \u03ed 0.7 hr, T max2 \u03ed 4.0 hr; C max1 \u03ed 60.6 \u03ee 25.7 ng/ml, C max2 \u03ed 40.5 \u03ee 21.3 ng/ml). The fraction of omeprazole that experienced delayed (or secondary) absorption was 57%. These results demonstrate that orally administered omeprazole in the approved product Gastrogard is absorbed in the stomach of Camelus Dromedarius. On the basis of the plasma profile, we speculate that initial omeprazole absorption occurs in C1 and that the remainder of absorption is in C3 or the small intestine. Bovine hepatogenous photosensitization has been related in Brazil since 1975. Hepatotoxic saponins and/or sporidesmin, mycotoxin present in Pithomyces chartarum spores, have been incriminated as primary causes of the disease. This study aimed to determine clinical characteristics and mortality and prevalence rates of the hepatogenous photosensitization in cattle grazing lush Brachiaria decumbens pastures. Two hundred-eighty weaned calves grazing lush B. decum-bens naturally contaminated with at least 50,000 Pithomyces chartarum spores/ gram, amount sufficient to induce bovine photosensitization, were evaluated. Sick animals were apart from the group and placed into B. decumbens pasture free of P. chartarum spore. Then, they were submitted to experimental protocol. Clinical photosensitization was classified as moderate or severe form. Animals with moderate photosensitization exhibited mild skin lesions which healed within 30 days following the onset of the disease. Animals with severe photosensitization had generalized skin lesions and died 18 to 47 days after initial symptoms. Animals that had no skin lesion but showed serum gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT) activity increased (\u03fe60 U/L) were submitted to liver biopsy and if the histologic evaluation showed cholangitis, they were referred as subclinical photosensitization animals. This information allowed to form 4 groups: healthy bovine (Group [G] 1); subclinical photosensitization (G2); moderate photosensitization (G3); and severe photosensitization (G4). Any time since the onset of the disease or at day 90th following the beginning of B. decumbens grazing if animal had no photosensitization, was preformed liver biopsy for histology.Results indicate that 181 (64,64%) showed symptoms of photosensitization. Of all sick bovines, 151 (83,42%) survived to the disease and 30 (16,58%) died. Death occurred 18 to 47 days after onset of clinical signs. Eighty-six (47,52%) animals developed subclinical disease, 65 (35,91%) had the moderate clinical form, and 30 (16,58%) presented severe photosensitization. Seventy-one (39,22%) became sick in the first 30 days following the B. decumbens grazing, 63 (34,80%) showed photosensitization within 31 to 60 days, and 47 (25,96%) between 61 to 90 days.In conclusion, the high prevalence and mortality rates of photosensitization verified in weaned calves suggest that lush B. decumbens pasture must be avoid just after weaning. Initially, these pastures could be used by adult animals, which are less prone to the development of the photosensitization. It is important a good management of B. decumbens pastures to avoid debris excess on the soil, which is necessary for the development of Pithomyces chartarum. Equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) is a condition of hypercortisolaemia and insulin resistance. The purpose of this study was to determine clinical, biochemical and endocrinological effects of trilostane, a 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, in EMS horses treated over 12-18 months. Blood samples were obtained at 4 hourly intervals over 24 hours for measurement of blood [glucose], serum [insulin] and serum [cortisol] at Time 0, prior to treatment, Time 1, 1-6 months and Time 2, 12-18 months after commencing treatment with trilostane. Results were analysed using 2-way ANOVA and T-tests. 21 horses (14 \u03ee 5 years) comprising 14 Welsh ponies or crosses, 5 Shetland ponies and 2 cobs were included. Mean estimated body weight was 300 \u03ee 96 kg; 9 were mares and 12 geldings. All horses presented for recurrent or chronic laminitis despite good management and hyperinsulinaemia (mean equivalent 94.4, 95%CI 70-128 uIU/L). Basal cortisol was elevated in 20/21 (mean 187 \u03ee 8.69 nmol/L) and hyperglycaemia was present in 6/14 horses. Equine Cushing's syndrome was excluded by lack of hirsutism (21/21), negative dexamethasone suppression test (DST) (15/21), combined DST and thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation (6/21), both DST and DST/TRH (3/21) or basal ACTH (3/21). Absence of pituitary pathology was confirmed by post mortem examination in 3 horses. Trilostane therapy was initiated at 0.9 \u03ee 0.3 mg/kg, but increased during the trial to 1.2 \u03ee 0.7 mg/kg.All horses started the trial with laminitis as the major clinical sign, 14 (67%) responding to the medication being clinically sound and available for final follow up at Time 2. Of these, 4 horses had recurrent bouts of laminitis throughout the trial and were considered partially responsive. 7 horses did not respond long term. 1 horse was euthanased due to liver disease and continued laminitis 2 months after starting the trial, a second responded for only 1 month, developed a severe bout of laminitis and was euthanased 2 months after starting. 5 horses responded initially for a period of 4-5 months and of these 2 withdrew and 3 were euthanased due to recurrent laminitis and perceived lack of response.Following trilostane therapy, there was no change in serum [insulin], although horses that failed to respond clinically showed a trend for an increased serum [insulin] compared to ones that did (P \u03ed 0.07). Serum [cortisol] decreased from Time 0 (187 \u03ee 8.69 nmol/L) to Time 1 (151 \u03ee 10.3 nmol/L) (P \u03ed 0.01), but did not decrease further at Time 2 (175.5 \u03ee 13.6 nmol/L). Serum [glucose] was significantly higher at Time 2 (6.01 \u03ee 0.30 mmol/L) than Time 0 (5.02 \u03ee 0.21 mmol/L) or Time 1 (4.85 \u03ee 0.22 mmol/L) (P \u03fd 0.02).Following long-term trilostane treatment, 67% horses showed reduced signs of laminitis and there was a significant reduction in serum [cortisol] . Further research is needed to study the relationships between hypercortisolaemia and insulin resistance in horses with EMS.",
