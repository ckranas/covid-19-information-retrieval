            "text": "Development of new classes of antibiotics to counteract bacterial resistance has been intensely pursued in recent years. The search for new molecules has led to the study of naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides. Since most of these molecules target the cell membrane, development of resistance is unlikely. The cationic antimicrobial peptide gramicidin S (GS), isolated from Bacillus brevis, is active against a wide range of bacteria and fungi. Unfortunately, GS exhibits a high haemolytic activity, limiting its use as an antibiotic for topical applications. This peptide is a C2-symmetric cyclic decamer that adopts a rigid \u03b2-structure, in which the Val, Orn and Leu residues align to form the antiparallel \u03b2-strands and D-Phe and Pro induce type II' \u03b2-turns. There is a wide interest in the generation of new GS analogues in order to dissociate the antimicrobial and haemolytic activities. In addition, gramicidin S provides a suitable model to study the structural preferences of non-proteinogenic amino acids. The current study deals with the modification of the \u03b2-turn region of GS by incorporating conformationally restricted amino acids in place of both D-Phe residues. On the other hand, the native sequences D-Phe-Pro in GS were replaced by D-Pro-Phe as a well-known type II' \u03b2-turn forming dipeptide, and this Phe residue was further exchanged for different constrained surrogates. All linear peptides were prepared by SPPS using Boc-chemistry, cyclized in solution, purified by HPLC and characterized by mass spectrometry. The biological activity of the GS analogues has been evaluated.",

            "text": "The biotin -avidin interaction is the strongest non-covalent interaction known in nature. Several biological assays apply peptides or proteins conjugated with biotin. These compounds can be used with avidin-coated ELISA plates or Biacore microchips as targets in binding assays, or can be utilized as labelled entities for capturing enzyme-or fluorophore-labelled avidin, e.g. in FACS analysis. To avoid the blocking of the active sites of peptides/proteins by avidin, a spacer of 6-amino-hexanoic acid is frequently applied between biotin and the compound to be labelled. In some cases the biologically active peptides are also poorly soluble in dimethylformamide, which makes the conjugation reaction with biotin difficult. The biotinylated peptide might have lower solubility than the unlabelled parent compound, making the purification difficult too. Therefore, we prepared a new set of compounds suitable for introduction of biotin without decreasing solubility and preventing steric hindrance. These reagents contain 3,6,9,-trioxaundecanedioic acid moiety. First, N-terminally protected (Boc/Fmoc) building blocks compatible with step-wise solid phase synthesis were produced with ethylene-diamine. This enabled us to prepare biotinylating compounds with different length and solubility. The applicability of this new family of reagents was tested by their coupling to the N-terminal amino group of peptides derived from a \u03b2-sheet region of the IgG Fc fragment via their carboxyl groups on solid phase. In this presentation the synthesis of the reagents, their attachment to peptides with low solubility in solution or on solid phase will be described.",

The food components (including processed cheese) should have the shelf life at least 2 years at ambient temperature. The aim of the work was to determine the effect of sterilization on amino acids content in processed cheese. After production, the first part of processed cheeses (two groups were analyzed) was cooled in 3 hours to the temperature 10 stC. The second part of samples of both sterilized groups there was sterilized (117 stC for 20 minutes) and cooled to 10 stC. There were evaluated crude protein content (Kjeldahl method), ammonia content (Conway method) and amino acids content (ionic chromatography, ninhydrin detection). The effect of the sterilization on the crude protein content was insignificant. In both groups there occurred the significant decrease of the content of methionine, aspartic acid, serine, glutamic acid, valine, histidine, lysine and arginine (P < 0,05). The typical decreases ranged around 2 %. The largest losses occurred at serine (around 4 %). Ammonia may be one of the products of the degradation of amino acids. The sterilization caused an increase of ammonia content (approximately 76 mg/kg). The conclusions of previous studies were confirmed. Generally only a small decrease of nutrition value of processed cheeses obtained. On the other side it is balanced by multiply extension of their durability (from months to years).",

We designed a peptidomimetic of the MyD88 TIR domain consensus peptide Arg-Asp-Val-Leu-Pro-Gly-Thr [2] , named ST2825. Here, we report its synthesis and biological activity. We also report the synthesis and biological activity of its enantiomer, ST3511, and its diastereoisomers, ST3489 and ST3558. Methods: The structure of the MyD88 TIR domain consensus peptide is subdivided into three distinct portions, the most important of which is a b-turn. In the peptidomimetic design we changed the b-turn with a tricyclic spirolactam [3] , already known [4] . We synthesized this building block, its enantiomer and two of 8 possible diastereoisomers by \"in solution\" synthesis. Based on semiempirical calculation of heat of formation [5] , we could predict the right stereochemistry of the 4 products selectively obtained in the last cyclization step. Results: These four compounds were tested for their biological activity by Reporter Gene Assay (RGA). Some coimmunoprecipitation experiments were also carried out and we report their results.",

Introduction of a methylene bridge between the C\u03b1(i+1) and the N(i+2) atoms in an open peptide (I) to mimic simultaneously the C\u03b1H(i+1) and HN(i+2) protons (\u03b2-Lactam Scaffold Assisted Design -\u03b2-LSAD) has proven to be a practical tool for the preparation of monotopic \u03b2-turn peptidomimetics (II, R2 = R3 = H), according to the principle of separation of constraint and recognition elements1. In this work we report a short, general, and stereocontrolled synthesis of multitopic \u03b2-lactam scaffolds of type VI. \u03b1-Alkyl serinates III are converted into the corresponding enantiopure Nnosyl-aziridines IV which undergo \"in situ\" ring-opening with amino acids V. Subsequent base-promoted cyclization affords the N-protected \u03b1-alkyl-\u03b1-amino-\u03b2-lactams VII. Incorporation of the novel scaffolds into linear and cyclic peptides and their conformational features are also presented, most of them showing stabilized \u03b2-and \u03b3-turn conformations. Poly(amino acids) are emerging as promising therapeutic carriers finding widespread application in the field of drug delivery. In this context, polyproline polymers have been used to solubilize poorly water-soluble proteins, in affinity chromatography for the purification of platelet profilin, and more recently, in the design of dendrimers. Poly(amino acids) are most conveniently synthesized by polymerization of the corresponding amino acid N-carboxyanhydride (NCA). In spite of the interest of polyproline, the preparation of proline N-carboxyanhydride (Pro-NCA) renders poor synthetic yields. In this work a new method for the preparation of Pro-NCA in high yields and purities is described. Amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides are obtained by the method described by Fuchs. But, in the case of proline, the N-carbamoyl chloride does not cyclise spontaneously as it takes place with other amino acids, and the use of a non-nucleophilic base is required for the cyclisation. A tertiary amine, such as triethylamine, is commonly used but it renders a low conversion of the N-carbamoyl chloride to the expected Pro-NCA, together with the presence of the Pro-Pro diketopiperazine byproduct. In the present work, polymer-supported bases have been used instead of triethylamine. Higher yields of Pro-NCA, and very low percentages of diketopiperazine have been obtained. In addition, no tertiary amine contamination was observed. Polymer-supported bases could also be recycled and Pro-NCA yields were reproducible. In conclusion, we have developed an efficient method for Pro-NCA preparation with polymer-supported bases. ",

            "text": "NMDA receptors belong to the ionotropic group of glutamate receptors. The activity of the receptor can be altered by compounds acting at binding sites. The (R,S)-(Tetrazol-5-yl)glycine (TG) has been shown to be a highly potent NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartic acid) receptor agonist with exitotoxic effects [1] . The aim of our studies was to investigate the chelating ability of TG towards copper(II) ions. Copper is widely distributed throughout the body with a distinct concentration in the brain. Copper enters cells as complex and seeks out targets requiring it to function. For these reasons it was interesting to evaluate stability and structure of TG -copper(II) complexes. The equilibrium and structural properties of complex species were characterized by pH-metric and spectroscopic (UV-VIS and EPR) methods. In the system, polymeric species are dominant at acidic pH range having { NH2, COO-} coordination with possible Ntetr bridging elements. Monomeric complexes were found at physiological pH. The two TG molecules are bound to copper ion via four nitrogen donors. The formation of two {NH2, Ntetr} donor sets results in very strong metal-ligand interactions and the complex species are very stable over a wide pH region. We have also performed an investigation on similar tetrazole compounds in order to compare the chelating ability of the tetrazole moiety . The targets of our studies were 1,5-diamino-1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazole [2] and tetrazole aspartic acid. References Continuing work in that field, we synthesized oxytocins containing tetrazole analogues of amino acids. The 5-tetrazolyl group is widely used in medicinal chemistry as an isostere of the carboxyl group. Compounds containing tetrazole ring appear to be metabolically more stable than their carboxylic analogues and have comparable acidity. We synthesized derivatives of aspartic, glutamic, and alpha-aminoadipic acids containing 1H-tetrazole ring in side chains. These derivatives were then used for syntheses of oxytocin analogues substituted in position 4. Apart from above we also obtained two analogues with tetrazole analogue of glycine in position 9. The first one contains 1H-tetrazole ring, the second one has tetrazole ring substituted with methyl group in position 1. Oxytocin analogues possessing amino acids with tetrazole ring in side chains were synthesized on amide resin using Fmoc methodology. In the case of analogues with C-terminal tetrazole ring, fragments 1-7 were synthesized on resin and then coupled with suitable dipeptides in solution. All obtained peptides show no pressor and rather low uteronic activity. However, for some analogues the uterotonic activity when measured in the presence of magnesium ions was several times higher. In humans, two classes of defensins, \u03b1-defensin and \u03b2-defensin, have been identified on the basis of tissue specificities and structural features including their modes of disulfide pairing. In general, particular combinations with disulfide bonding in cysteine-containing peptides are critical for expressing their intrinsic biological activities. In the case of human \u03b1-and \u03b2-defensins, however, disulfide isomers without the native pairing were demonstrated to exhibit similar antimicrobial activity to that of the native defensins. Therefore, to assess the biological activities of defensins as well as defensin-based therapeutics, extreme care is required in the chemical synthesis of these peptides to avoid ambiguity in quality. In the present study, we synthesized human \u03b1-defensin-1, -2 and -4, and human \u03b2-defensin-1, -2, -3 and -4 by employing Boc chemistry, and determined the optimal conditions for folding the respective reduced peptides preferentially into a native conformation. Among the factors affecting the oxidative folding in the presence of reduced and oxidized glutathione, the buffer concentration and reaction temperature were essential. All the synthetic human \u03b1-and \u03b2-defensins were confirmed to have the respective native disulfide pairing by sequential analyses and mass measurements with cystine segments obtained by enzymatic digestion. All the human \u03b1-and \u03b2-defensins could be efficiently oxidized to the \u03b1-and \u03b2-defensin-type disulfide structure, respectively, under several conditions determined in the present study. These synthetic peptides of high homogeneity were used to accurately assess the antimicrobial activity. ",

Striking features like ethanolamine group in C-terminus, the N-terminal N-formylated valine and the high hydrophobicity of the peptide sequence, make the solid-phase synthesis of gramicidin A very tricky. Therefore, we followed a new synthetic strategy for peptide chain elongation assisted by microwave energy. In fact, microwave energy has been demonstrated to produce highpurity compounds with more rapid reaction times, enhancing coupling rates and efficiency in difficult syntheses [2] . However, microwave-assisted solid phase peptide synthesis (MW-SPPS) has not been yet extensively investigated. In this context, we synthesized gramicidin A by MW-SPPS in high yield and purity, enhancing reaction rate compared to the traditional SPPS. Thermal disruption of peptide aggregation, induced by microwaves, is possible favorable for obtaining this particularly difficult sequence. Gramicidin A was incorporated in synthetic lipid bilayers, self-assembled on mercury electrodes, characterized by hydrophilic spacers interposed between the metal and the lipid bilayer.

Activation of carboxylic acids by TBCRs is particularly effective because of formation of triazine \"superactive esters\". The usefulness of TBCRs as coupling reagents has been recently confirmed in the synthesis of Z-, Boc-, and Fmoc-protected dipeptides, sterically hindered amino acids, in the synthesis of esters, in manual and automated SPPS of difficult peptide sequences, and head-to-tail constrained cyclopeptide analogues [2] . Moreover, we also demonstrated TBCRs efficient in a microwave-assisted solution synthesis of the N-glucosylated building block Fmoc-Asn(GlcOAc4)-OH using a manual monomode microwave instrument [3] . This building block was used to obtain CSF114(Glc) comparing the efficacy of a monomode microwave automatic instrument with the traditional solid-phase peptide synthesizers such as the manual and automatic in batch systems, as well as the continuous-flow one. It is known that enzymatic peptide synthesis is more advantageous than chemical synthesis in many aspects; it is highly stereoselective, racemization-free and requires minimal side-chain protection. The method is, however, limited to the use of amino acid derivatives which meet the enzymatic specificity as a coupling component. This problem may be solved using enzymes which have wide specificity of substrate. But in this case, secondary hydrolysis of the resulting peptide may arise from the inherent nature of the protease. In this matter, ficin and ficin-like enzymes were used as cysteine protease to analyze the diminishment of specificity for the substrate. The cysteine protease-catalyzed peptide coupling reaction has been studied by using synthetic fourteen Boc-amino acid phenyl and naphthyl esters as acyl donor. The reaction conditions were optimized for organic solvent, pH, and concentration of acceptor. The coupling reaction was carried out by incubating an acyl donor (1 mM) with an acyl acceptor (Ala p-nitroanilide, 35 mM) and enzyme (0.1U) in a mixture of GTA buffer (50 mM, pH 9.0) and DMSO (3:2) at 37\u0652C.

Also, some sequences form inclusion bodies or fail to express. The total chemical synthesis of insulin in research scale was a landmark achievement in peptide science. However, the most commonly used method relies on recombination of A-and B-chains under \"random\" folding and pairing of the three disulfide bridges.

The final products, chromatographically homogenous amides and peptides, were isolated by filtration or extraction from the solid support. Mutter's pseudoproline dipeptides and Sheppard's Hmb derivatives are powerful tools for enhancing synthetic efficiency in Fmoc SPPS. They work by exploiting the natural propensity of N-alkyl amino acids to disrupt the formation of the secondary structures during peptide assembly. Their use results in better and more predictable acylation and deprotection kinetics, enhanced reaction rates, and improved yields of crude products. However, these approaches have certain limitations: pseudoproline dipeptides can only be used for sequences containing serine or threonine, and the coupling of the amino acid following the Hmb residue can be extremely difficult. To alleviate some of these shortcomings, we have prepared Fmoc-Ala-(Dmb)Gly-OH and Fmoc-Gly-(Dmb)Gly-OH. These Dmb-dipeptides can be incorporated into peptides in place of Ala-Gly and Gly-Gly, resulting in peptides containing structure breaking (Dmb)Gly residues.

The known methods require the protection of amino acid(s) to fix the order of the amino acids ( Fig. 1) . Furthermore, they usually accompany the formation of longer peptides. To establish the costeffective manufacturing method, a novel activity which synthesizes \u03b1-dipeptides from two unprotected L-amino acids was screened. Methods and Results: A gene was found in the genome of Bacillus subtilis by in silico screening based on a putative reaction mechanism. The purified protein coded on the gene, i) catalyses \u03b1-dipeptide formation from unmodified L-amino acids with a specific order in an ATP-dependent manner, ii) never forms tri-or longer peptides, and iii) takes a wide variety of L-amino acids but no D-amino acids. The enzyme was tentatively named L-amino acid \u03b1-ligase (Lal). The whole cell reaction of a recombinant E. coli strain expressing Lal and polyphosphate kinase (Ppk) with two L-amino acids and polyphosphate (polyP) enable the efficient production of many dipeptides with a certain order of the constituent amino acids through the coupling reaction of Lal and Ppk (Fig. 2) .

Due to the difficulties in the isolation of significant quantities of these natural products, synthetic chemistry serves an important role in their structural assignment and biological evaluation. Antifungal agents have received considerable attention recently since the spread of HIV has left many people open to fungal infections, and there is a rapidly growing number of drug resistant strains of fungus emerging. LL-15G256gamma is a cyclodepsipeptide isolated from the marine fungus Hypoxylon oceanicum and structurally assigned in 1998 by Schlingmann. The structure of LL-15G256gamma was determined by a combination of chemical degradation, chiral chromatography and spectroscopic analysis. LL-15G256gamma uniquely combines a beta-ketotryptophan and a polyketide portion within a macrolactone ring. LL-15G256gamma has exhibited potent activity against fungal strains and as such, is an attractive compound to develop as a future therapeutic agent. To date, there have been no reported studies towards the synthesis of LL-15G256gamma. We have completed the total synthesis of LL-15G256gamma by employing the macrolactamization followed by a C-H oxidation as the key step. Aspartimide (aminosuccinimide, Asu) formation is the first step in the degradation of Asp/Asn containing peptides and proteins. The reaction is especially prevalent at Asx-Gly sites and results in a variety of rearranged and racemized products. The bases used in Fmoc-tert-based SPPS promote the formation of Asu and related products. We recently found that the Dmb backbone protection efficiently prevents secondary structure formation at GG sites and is orthogonal with respect to standard Fmoc SPPS. Here we explore the use of Dmb, Tmb and Nbzl groups (Z) for the synthesis of \"difficult\"/Asu-prone peptides, in three different schemes: A) Fmoc-Asx-(Z)Gly-OH dipeptide building blocks; B) Fmoc-(Z)Gly-OH monomer building blocks, and C) two steps \"submonomeric\" approach for synthesis of substituted N-benzyl glycines on the resin. We tested the new methods on two model peptides VKD/NGYI and HA21-20HIV-TAT48-57 (H-G1LFGAIAGFI ENGWEGMIDG20GRKKRRQRRR30-OH) fusion peptide. The yield and purity of the products reach and even exceed the level in control experiments obtained with Hmb protection and the peptides were found free of Asu/piperidides. The acid removal of the Dmb protection is ~30% faster than that of Hmb. The submonomeric route (Strategy C) is especially simple, efficient, cost effective and it allows the use of different amines for halogen-displacement. The backbone protecting groups used were in many respects superior to the commercial reagents and applicable for synthesis of both peptide acids and peptide amides. The use of Nbzl-NH2 for halogen displacement represents a new method for preparation of backbone-caged peptides. Alkyl bonded silica gels historically have been the standard in reversed phase (RP) purification of biomolecules such as synthetic peptides, small proteins, and oligonucleotides. Silica gels provided the resolving power needed for challenging separations and the mechanical stability required to be operated industrially under high pressure conditions. The chief disadvantage of silica gels is poor chemical stability under alkaline conditions, which limits their capability to withstand rigorous clean and sanitization -in-place (CIP/SIP) protocols. As a result, polymeric media have gained recent market attention because of their excellent chemical stability, which enables full compatibility with modern CIP/SIP protocols. However, first generation polymeric gels lacked both the resolving power and the mechanical stability to be compatible with industrial high pressure dynamic axial compression (DAC) hardware.",

Therefore, RNA isolation method is required. Many previous reports demonstrated isolation of RNAs, especially tRNAs. Most common and traditional purification methods are based on successive column chromatographies. It seems difficult to apply such method to every tRNA because effective combination of columns varies among individual tRNAs. To overcome the difficulty, a sequence-specific selection method using a solid-phase DNA has been devised. In this method, a tRNA can be purified from RNA mixture by a single step. However, this method needs high temperature treatment, which might assist hydrolysis of RNA strand and might impair heat labile modifications. PNA-RNA hybrid has been known to be much more stable than DNA-RNA hybrid. Thus PNA-based RNA purification method seems to be possible for wider variety of RNAs in lower temperature, in comparison with DNA-based method.

We wanted to use PyBOP, because preactivation should not be needed in this case, which is especially useful in automated synthesis. Surprisingly, in the PyBOP-mediated syntheses of 18mer PNAs we obtained products showing molecular masses approx. 67 Da above the expected ones. Detailed analysis revealed, that the modification occurred at the only guanine residue in the sequence. In order to further characterise the side reaction, a short PNA fragment was synthesised using HATU and PyBOP activation, respectively, and cleaved from the resin with and without the N-terminal Fmoc-group.

On the other hand, this reaction possibly opens an opportunity to synthesise guanine derivatives. The opioid receptor system in the central nervous system (CNS) controls a number of physiological processes including pain, reward, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular functions. As a consequence, most pain modulating compounds currently available cause a variety of side-effects. The endogenous ligands for the opioid receptors are a series of peptides that includes Endomorphin-1. Endomorphin-1 has been shown to elicit potent anti-nociception through the highly selective activation of \u00b5-opioid receptors. It is this receptor that mediates supraspinal analgesia and thus, selectivity for this receptor results in analgesia without affecting other processes. Therefore, endomorphin-1 is considered a promising lead compound for the development of a new, safer pain medication.",

The synthesis of glycopeptides requires a combination of synthetic methods from both carbohydrate and peptide chemistry.

            "text": "Our results prove that the synthesis of glycated peptides in the solid phase is feasible. The lack of homogeneous glycoproteins in sufficient quantities is an ongoing challenge in glycobiology. In order to solve this problem researchers have turned to a variety of approaches ranging from mutant eukaryotic strains to the highly demanding total synthesis of glycoproteins. [1] Using RNase B as a model Nglycoprotein [2] we have searched a path to assemble this enzyme employing a combination of chemical and recombinant methods. Native chemical ligation [3] allows the coupling of protein segments of unrestricted size in a chemoselective manner. We have developed solid phase methods to produce the required thioester building blocks 1-25-SR (A) and glycopeptide thioester 26-39-SR (B) containing an N-glycan at Asn34 on a dual linker PEGA resin. [4] The remaining segment 40-124 (C) was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein and released by intein mediated protein cleavage. [5] Sequential coupling of the three RNase segments requires the use of a protective group at the N-terminus of segment B compatible with the oligosaccharide part. Dysfunctional mutations of antitrypsin can result in a loss of elastase inhibitory activity or allow self-aggregation to occur and cause emphysema and cirrhosis, respectively. Insights of the mechanism of disease provide strategy to cope with the aberrant protein aggregation and may bring potential therapeutic agents. In the present work, we describe our effort to identify effective anti-protein polymerization ligands by the employment of combinatorial technology. Antitrypsin from human plasma was purified by glutathione Sepharose and Mono Q-Sepharose column chromatography. Both Ala-scanning and peptide shortening were carried out systematically to explore the structural requirements necessary for binding. Combinatorial chemistry was then employed to conduct the library screening experiments. Assessment of peptide binding was achieved through an unique gel electrophoresis assay. The structural requirements and the minimal peptide length required for binding were revealed by our systematic approach. This information was critical for the design of combinatorial library and the discovery of antitrypsin binding peptides with much improved affinity and specificity. There is currently no effective cure for Z antitrypsin related cirrhosis and emphysema. The synthesis and screening of combinatorial libraries offer avenues to increase throughput and ultimately lead to the discovery of inhibitory peptides to the polymerization of pathogenic antitrypsin. With the rapidly increasing number of biopharmaceuticals in the industrial pipeline the need for efficient and expedient purification procedures is growing ever greater. Affinity chromatography is one of the most promising technologies in this regard, as it offers very high selectivity and can often replace lengthy and expensive traditional chromatographic procedures. The use of combinatorial split-and-mix libraries is a powerful tool for discovering new affinity ligands but the technique has been limited by the laborious spectroscopic and chemical analysis needed to identify the binding ligand. We have previously introduced a novel bead encoding technology based on a 3-dimensional image recognition of patterns made by fluorescent particles randomly distributed inside larger beads. [1] The beads are read prior to each chemical transformation by an instrument featuring three fluorescence microscopes at a rate of 5,000 beads per hour. We here present the development of small peptidomimetic affinity ligands for the human growth hormone (hGH) by the use of this technology. The library was sought enriched prior to synthesis by in silico screening of a virtual combinatorial library using a large number of diverse building blocks. Binding ligands were identified by incubation with fluorescence tagged hGH. [ The cinnamic acids and their derivatives have been found to possess a variety of biological effects, including antiviral, Antimicrobial, antitumor and antioxidant activity. For example, several hydroxycinnamic acid conjugates with amino acids, isolated from plant sources showed enhanced antioxidant activity. The synthesis of cinnamic acid amides and their opioid activity was also cited in the literature. However the synthesis and pharmacological properties of sinapoyl-peptide amides continues to be virtually unexplored.",

Several proteins are involved in the transcription of DNA to mRNA, among which the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins. These transcription factors bind specific DNA sequences by dimerization and inserting short alpha-helices into the DNA major groove. Because the dimerization domain is only required to obtain the correct geometrical positioning of the alpha-helices, we will replace it by a dipodal steroid scaffold with defined stereochemistry. Due to orthogonal protecting groups, a unique feature of this scaffold is the possibility to design not only homodimers, but also heterodimers. Therefore this strategy allows for the construction of both major/major groove and major/minor groove binding peptides, either mimicking naturally occurring proteins or designing peptides with new binding properties. Native chemical ligation and Staudinger ligation are both suitable for the construction of these peptide dimers. Moreover, a combination of solution-and solid-phase chemistry allows for the generation of combinatorial libraries. The increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a global health problem. Therefore the development of new highly efficient drugs is one of the major tasks of this century.",

Cyclotides are a fascinating family of plant-derived peptides characterized by their head-to-tail cyclized backbone and knotted arrangement of three disulfide bonds. This conserved structural architecture, termed the cyclic cystine knot, is responsible for their exceptional resistance to thermal, chemical and enzymatic degradation. Cyclotides have a variety of biological activities but their insecticidal activities suggest that their primary function is in plant defense. In this study we determined the cyclotide content of the sweet violet Viola odorata, a member of the Violaceae family. We identified 30 cyclotides from the aerial parts and roots of this plant, 13 of which are novel sequences. The new sequences provide information about the natural diversity of cyclotides and the role of particular residues in defining structure and function. As many of the biological activities of cyclotides appear to be associated with membrane interactions, we used hemolytic activity as a marker of bioactivity for a selection of the new cyclotides. The new cyclotides were tested for their ability to resist proteolysis by a range of enzymes and, in common with other cyclotides, were completely resistant to trypsin, pepsin and thermolysin. The results show that while biological activity varies with the sequence the proteolytic stability of the framework does not, and appears to be an inherent feature of the cyclotide framework. The structure of one of the new cyclotides, cycloviolacin O14, was determined and shown to contain the cyclic cystine knot motif. This study confirms that cyclotides may be regarded as a natural combinatorial template that displays a variety of peptide epitopes most likely targeted to a range of plant pests and pathogens. Furthermore, the inherent stability of the framework makes it an excellent scaffold for protein engineering applications. Warfarin is the most widely prescribed anticoagulant drug for the prevention and treatment of arterial and venous thromboembolic disorders.Because of large interpatient variability in the dose-anticoagulant effect relationship and a narrow therapeutic index careful dosage adjustment based on INR is essential. Warfarin is available as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers,(S)-and (R)-warfarin. In contrast to (R)-warfarin, which is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450s(CYPs), Including CYP1A2 and CYP3A4,(S)-warfarin, is predominantly metabolized to 7-hydroxywarfarin by polymorphic CYP2C9. Since the potency of (S)-warfarin is much higher than that of (R)-warfarin, about 3-to 5-fold,any change in the activity of CYP2C9 gene is likely to have a significant influence on the anticoagulant response. Previous in vitro findings revealed that certain variants in the CYP2C9 gene are associated with large interindividual differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcomes of warfarin therapy. Three major alleles have been found to date in humans:Arg144/Ile359, and Cys144/Ile359 and Arg144/leu359, and Arg144/Leu359, which have been designated CYP2C9*1 (wild-type), CYP2C9*2, and CYP2C9*3, respectively. We have investigated this polymorphism in Iranians that has not been described previously. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood. For detection of CYP2C9*2, and CYP2C9*3 variants, a protocol based on PCR technique and Endonuclease digestion with KpnI, Ava II was used. In this research work, we have studied a group of 56 patients, in which warfarin therapy was initiated. Recently new 21-residue antimicrobial peptides -arenicins were isolated from coelomocytes of marine polychaeta Arenicola marina and their sequences were determined [1] . There are two isoforms of arenicins which differ only with single amino acid. These peptides have no structure similarity to any previously identified antimicrobial peptides. We have synthesized and estimated the antibacterial properties of arenicin-1: RWCVYAYVRVRGVLVRYRRCW. The linear peptide was prepared by solid phase method using Boc-technology without any problem. However the cyclization caused the appreciable difficulties. The following methods of oxidation were used: oxygen of air, K3Fe(CN)6 and hydrogen peroxide in aqueous or organic media. The best results were obtained by using hydrogen peroxide in methanol, but and in this case the yield of the aim peptide did not exceed 5%. Synthetic arenicin had the same HPLC profile and MALDI-TOF spectra as a natural molecule. The peptide showed an antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria: Peptidergic hormones and neurotransmitters are known to be produced by the specific cleavage of their precursor proteins that per se have no biological functions. The neutrophil-activating peptides we recently identified, however, are the peptides cleaved from mitochondrial proteins by proteolysis. Therefore, we named them \"functional cryptic peptides\" because they are hidden in protein sequences. Some of these peptides activate Gi type of G proteins directly, and neutrophils are suggested to be stimulated by the direct (i.e., not via GPCRs) activation of G proteins. These peptides had features, in common, in their distributions of charged and hydrophobic amino acid residues, but homologies in their primary structures were not apparent. In the present study, we predicted functional cryptic peptides that activate G proteins, based on the distribution of charged and hydrophobic residues. Receptors for these peptides were also investigated by the direct cross-linking experiments between peptides and their targeted proteins. The finding of functional cryptic peptides is expected to lead to the identification of novel signaling mechanisms where such peptides are involved in the regulation of bio-functions. The fragment 81-88 of the precursor of human interleukin-1alpha (pIL-1\u03b1) (GK-VLKKRR) appeared to have more than 80% homology with corticotropin fragment 10-18 (GKPVGKKRR). We have previously synthesized the octapeptide GKVLKKRR (referred to as leucocorticotropin, LCT) and found its high affinity binding to corticotropin receptors on various immunocompetent cells in human and mouse. In this study we investigated the interaction of LCT with rat adrenal cortex membranes and the effects of LCT on the level of 11-oxycorticosteroids (CS) in rat adrenal glands and plasma in vivo. LCT was labeled with tritium by the high-temperature solid-state catalytic isotope exchange reaction to specific activity of 22 Ci/mmol. Receptor binding studies revealed that tritium-labeled LCT bound with high affinity and specificity to corticotropin receptor on rat adrenal cortex membranes (Kd = 2.2 nM). LCT at concentrations of 0.1 -1000 n\u041c was found to have no influence on the adenylate cyclase activity in adrenal cortex membranes, while intranasal injection of LCT to rats at doses of 10 -50 microg/kg was found to inhibit the secretion of CS from the adrenals to the bloodstream. Thus, LCT is an antagonist of corticotropin receptor. Comarin derivatives such as warfarin are prescribed widely for treatment and prevention of thrombosis. Warfarin is the widespread oral anticoagulant drug employed, but its required dose is highly variable both inter-individually and inter-ethnically. So it is desirable to develop strategies to predict the warfarin dose response in patients before initiation of anticoagulation. The vitamin K-dependent \u03b3-carboxilation system, Consists of the vitamin K-dependent \u03b3-carboxylase, which requires the reduced hydroquinone form of vitamin K1 as a cofactor and the warfarin sensitive enzyme vitamin K1 2,3-epoxide reductase (VKOR), which produces the cofactor. Warfarin exerts its anticoagulant effect by inhibiting the vitamin K epoxid reductase enzyme complex (VKOR) that recycles vitamin K1 2, 3-epoxide to vitamin K1 hydroquinone.",

They are also an important factor in compressing the bacterial DNA in the nucleoid. Among the HLPs, HU protein is attracted to DNA containing structural aberrations such as four way junctions or single stranded lesions. This protein plays an important role in binding as a dimer and bending DNA. It also contributes to the beginning of the DNA replication. In this study we showed that a 10-KDa protein, probably HU exists in Halobacillus karajiensis which is a novel gram positive moderate halophile bacteria that was recently isolated from surface saline soil of the Karaj Region, Iran. Since HU is purified and characterized in E.coli we used this bacteria as the control in this study. The 10-KDa protein extraction was carried out by using PCA 5% which is normally used for extracting Histones from eukaryotic cells. The results of running the protein extracts on SDS-PAGE demonstrated a band around 10-KDa which was seen in protein extracts of this protocol. These results supported the hypothesis of the existence of a 10-KDa protein in Halobacillus karajiensis. Sufficient oxygen and nutrient delivery is a necessity for tumors. When oxygen supply decreases, tumors initiate growth of new blood vessels. Low grade astrocytomas, a class of malignant brain tumors, grow along the existing vessels in a process called co-option. Hypoxia is induced in the progression from grade III to grade IV astrocytomas (glioblastoma multiforme, GBM) which in turn triggers the formation of a new and distinct tumor vasculature. The new vessels formed by tumor-triggered angiogenesis differ by molecular composition from their normal vascular counterparts. We are utilizing phage displayed peptide libraries to identify peptides that specifically home to either co-opted or angiogenic brain tumor vessels. Furthermore, we aim at characterizing differentially expressed endothelial markers (receptor molecules) to get a better understanding of the molecular changes in the vasculature. Several rounds of in vivo biopanning was performed in mouse models of astrocytomas to isolate a phage pool that has up to a hundred-fold homing to low grade tumor lesions. Out of the selected pool we discovered peptides capable of homing and accumulating to the tumor islets and co-opted vasculature. The homing potential of our newly identified peptides has shown to be highly specific for clusters formed by the tumor cells and co-opted \"early\" vessels within these palisades. These homing peptides represent promising candidates to selectively target co-opted vessels and tumor lesions in the brain and act as lead compounds in identification of surface molecules (receptors) differentially expressed by co-opted tumor vessels. The \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin receptors play an important role in human tumor metastasis and growth. The inhibition of these receptors by antibodies or by cyclic peptides containing the Arg-Gly-Asp( RGD) sequence may be used as selectively treatment to suppress the disease.",

The dramatic increase in research for new anthrax therapeutic approach was prompted by potential use of the causative agent of anthrax Bacillus anthracis as a biological weapon. Anthrax toxin consists of three proteins, the protective antigen (PA) and the two enzymes lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF) that are carried through the membrane of the target cell upon binding to specific site on the membrane receptor-bound PA. Lethal factor and edema factor were found to cooperate to promote immune evasion of the bacterium. Here we describe the production of peptide inhibitors of PA-LF binding, obtained by selecting PA-binding peptide by a competitive panning of a phage peptide library, using recombinant LF. We selected several 12 mer peptides, which were synthesized in tetra-branched Multiple Antigen Peptide (MAP) form, inducing resistance to proteolytic degradation (1) and maintaining biological activity of phage peptides. Lead tetra-branched peptides were systematically modified by progressive shortening and residue randomization, to obtain an increase of peptide affinity and inhibitory efficiency. Affinity maturation of lead sequences enabled selection of a peptide which has an IC50 at least one log lower that any other lethal-toxin-inhibiting peptide described so far and is effective for in vivo neutralization of anthrax toxin activity (2) . The same peptide can also efficiently inhibit the binding of EF to PA and EF-induced cAMP increase in different cell lines. Microtubules are dynamic polymers that have important roles in eukaryotic cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell polarity, vesicular transport and chromosomal movement. The dynamic behavior of microtubules has been studied both in vivo and in vitro. The effect of arsenic trioxide on microtubule polymerization has been studied under in vivo experimentation shown that it inhibits formation of mitotic bundles. We studied the mechanism of arsenic trioxide effect on polymerization of microtubule protein purified from sheep brain in vitro. Microtubule polymerization has been conducted by adding 1mM GTP to purified tubuline in PEM buffer at 37oC for 30 minutes and simultaneously followed by measuring turbidity (350 nm). The results shown that lag time of polymerization (nucleation step) is affected by increasing concentrations of arsenic trioxide from 0-5 micromolar. Moreover the rate of elongation step was decreased exponentially by increasing arsenic trioxide concentration. Electron micrographs also showed microtubules length decrement due to arsenic trioxide. The results have shown the inhibitory effect of arsenic trioxide on microtubule polymerization via its effect on nucleation step as well as elongation rate. Background and Aims: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia among the elderly. The increase in life expectancy worldwide demands new therapies for AD urgently. Self-association of the amyloid \u00df-protein (A\u00df) into neurotoxic assemblies, a seminal event in the etiology of AD, is considered to follow interactions of the C-terminus of the 42-residue form of A\u00df (A\u00df42). We hypothesized that molecules with high affinity for the C-terminus of A\u00df42 will disrupt A\u00df42 oligomerization. A series of C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of A\u00df42, A\u00df(x-42) with x = 28-39, has been prepared to study their potential to inhibit A\u00df42 oligomerization and neurotoxicity. Methods: Attenuation of A\u00df42 assembly by CTFs was studied by quantitative analysis of oligomer size distributions using a photo-cross-linking assay followed by SDS-PAGE. Biological activity of CTFs themselves and as inhibitors of A\u00df42-induced neurotoxicity was assessed by MTT reduction assay using differentiated PC-12 cells. The structure of the CTFs was studied by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) coupled with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.",

Background and aims: Human Kallikrein hK2 is a prostate specific serine protease, which expression level is elevated in aggressive human prostate cancer suggesting a possible role in a tumour growth and spreading. Since hK2 protease is highly prostate specific, inhibition of its activity is a possible method to prevent tumour growth without interfering the function of the other proteases. We have identified hK2 specific linear peptide inhibitor by using phage display techniques. In order to design peptide for in vivo studies we tested the protease stability of the linear and the cyclic forms of the peptide. Methods: The prerequisite of the binding was studied by using conventional Ala-replacement method and the most optimal sequence was selected for further studies. The stability of the original linear form, acetylated form, peptide with cystein bridge and head-to-tail cyclic peptide was tested with modified trypsin (sequencing grade) and with human plasma. Results: Both linear versions and peptide with cystein bridge were unstable and were degraded during the first 30 minutes in both stability tests. Head-to-tail form of the peptide was stable in both tests during the first 180 minutes. Conclusions: Since our peptide contains arginine there was a possibility that our peptide is sensitive to trypsin and other serum proteases. Indeed both linear and one cyclic from degraded in our tests. Only head-to-tail peptide was stable during the first 3 hours suggesting protease resistant folding.",

However, these agents have very little or no specificity which leads to systemic toxicity. Among them paclitaxel is considered to be one of the most important drugs in cancer chemotherapy; however, this agent has also lack of selectivity to the tumor tissue. Therefore, development of tumor-targeting prodrug is highly promising. Methods: To activate cytotoxic agent specifically at the tumor tissue, we developed a new prodrug strategy based on O-N intramolecular acyl migration, which is a well-known reaction in peptide chemistry, and photodynamic therapy. Results: We synthesized a prodrug which has a coumarin derivative conjugated to the amino acid moiety of isotaxel (O-acyl isoform of paclitaxel). The prodrug was selectively activated by visible light irradiation (430 nm) leading to cleavage of coumarin. Finally, paclitaxel was released by subsequent O-N intramolecular acyl migration. Conclusion: We synthesized and evaluated a novel type of paclitaxel prodrug. This prodrug showed promising kinetic data. Therefore, we believe that photoactivation can be promising novel strategy for design of tumor-targeting prodrugs.

The possibility of practical application of CLA as a therapeutic agent is limited due to its high hydrophobicity. It has been suggested that the tetrapeptide sequence Pro(6)-Pro(7)-Phe(8)-Phe(9) is responsible for the interaction of the CLA molecule with the proper cellular receptor.

The intracellular signals include proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic tails of the two subunits \u03b1 and \u03b2 of the integrin, or integrin-associated membrane proteins. In vivo charge swapping mutation studies suggested that \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 tails have a direct site of interaction between \u03b1IIb (R995) and \u03b23 (D723).

In previous work it has been found that peptoid H-Arg-15-15C ( Fig. 1) inhibits the activation of TRPV1 by blocking the pore entrance. However, this compound showed toxicity in vivo.

A certain portion of ubiquitin -labeled sperm is phagocytosed and the remaining is ejaculated .Hence ubiquitin on the sperm surface could be a good marker of semen quality control in men. The aim of present study is to purify ubiquitin from packed blood cells , to produce and purify antiubiquitin antibodies,to design an immunofluorescence assy for detection of defective sperm, to compare the percentage of ubiquitinated sperm in Oligoasthenotertozoospermia and Normozoospermia and finally to determine correlations between sperm parameters and sperm ubiquitination.",

            "text": "C-Terminal analogues of Substance P (SP) have been studied for their ability to prevent tumor growth or the proliferation of several cancer cell lines. The incorporation of Damino acids into the sequence of SP and N-methylation of peptide bonds have shown to protect SP from the action of plasma and tissue peptidases. Aiming to design and prepare more potential antagonist of cancer cells proliferation and taking into account that all the metabolites of the C-terminal hexapeptide analogue [Arg6, D-Trp7,9, MePhe8]SP6-11 (antagonist G) possess the N-Me group and D-Trp residue, we proceeded to the synthesis of peptoid-peptide hybrids. They are oligomeric peptido-mimetics containing the residue [-\u039d(Bzl)-CH2-CO-]=(NPhe). The incorporation of N-substituted glycine in peptide chains has been proved to improve their stability against proteases and give biologically active peptides. Thus, the tetrapeptoid-peptide hybrids H-Arg1-D-Trp2-NPhe3-D-Trp4-OH and H-D-Trp1-NPhe2-D-Trp3-Leu4-OH, corresponding to metabolites of antagonist G and also the hexapeptoid-peptide hybrids Glp1-D-Trp2-\u039dPhe3-D-Trp4-Leu5-Glu(OBzl)6-\u039d\u03972 and Glp1-D-Trp2-\u039dPhe3-D-Trp4-Leu5-Glu(OBzl)6-OH have been synthesized. The latter have incorporated the amino acid residues Glp at the N-terminal and Glu(OBzl) at the C-terminal of the analogue, which have shown to give to the analogues increased resistance and biological activity. All the products were purified (HPLC), identified (ESI-MS) and set about for study their biological properties and activity against cancer cells proliferation. A chemokine receptor CXCR4 has multiple critical functions in normal and pathologic physiology. CXCR4 is a GPCR that transduces signals of its endogenous ligand, CXCL12 (stromal cell-derived factor-1, SDF-1). The CXCL12-CXCR4 axis plays an important role in the migration of progenitors during embryologic development of the cardiovascular, hemopoietic, central nervous systems and so on. This axis has recently been proven to be involved in several problematic diseases, including HIV infection, cancer cell metastasis, leukemia cell progression, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, CXCR4 is a great therapeutic target to overcome the above diseases. Fourteen-mer peptides, T140 and its analogs, were previously found to be specific CXCR4 antagonists that were identified as HIV-entry inhibitors, anti-cancer-metastatic agents, anti-chronic lymphocytic/acute lymphoblastic leukemia agents and anti-RA agents. Cyclic pentapeptides, such as FC131 [cyclo(D-Tyr-Arg-Arg-L-3-(2-naphthyl)alanine-Gly)], were previously found as CXCR4 antagonist leads based on pharmacophores of T140. In this symposium, we would like to report the development of low molecular weight CXCR4 antagonists involving FC131 analogs and other compounds with different scaffolds including leaner-type structures.

            "text": "Erythropoietin (EPO) controls the proliferation and differentiation of red blood cells. It activates EPOR by inducing dimerization and reorientation of two receptor chains. Peptides mimicking the action of EPO, EPO Mimetic Peptides (EMP), have been discovered by phage display, interacting with the receptor on the active site and competing with the hormone [1] . Another peptide, EPOR derived peptide (ERP), was reported to activate the receptor through an alternative site distant from the hormone binding site, and to have synergic action with EPO [2] . We report the design of new synthetic EPO-R agonists by dimerization of active peptides. PEGbased polyamide linkers of precise length were used to link the molecules, using oxime chemistry [3] . These peptides include EMPs that have been homo-dimerized through their N-or C-terminus. A hetero-dimer of one EMP and one ERP peptides was also created. Biological characterization of the molecules is currently under investigation. [ The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mediates the entry of the virus into target cells. Recent studies point out to a cell entry mechanism of this virus similar to other enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1. As it happens with other viruses peptidic fusion inhibitors, SARS-CoV S protein HR2 derived peptides are potential therapeutic drugs against the virus. It is believed that HR2 peptides block the six-helix bundle formation, a key structure in the viral fusion, by interacting with the HR1 region. It is a matter of discussion if the HIV-1 gp41 HR2 derived peptide T20 (enfuvirtide) could be a possible SARS-CoV inhibitor given the similarities between the two viruses. We used fluorescence spectroscopy techniques to test the possibility of interaction between both T20 (HIV-1 gp41 HR2 derived peptide) and T-1249 with S protein HR1 and HR2 derived peptides. Our biophysical data show a significant interaction between a SARS-CoV HR1 derived peptide and T20. However the interaction is only moderate (KB = (1.1\u00b10.3) \u00d7 105 M-1). This finding shows that the reasoning behind the hypothesis that T20, already approved for clinical application in AIDS treatment, could inhibit the fusion of SARS-CoV with target cells is correct but the effect may not be strong enough for application. [1] were used to investigate the structure, dynamics and thermodynamics of the known complex between erythropoietin mimetic peptides (EMP) and erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). With Gromacs 3.2 bioinformatics software, we have obtained from the known EMPs about the key functional amino acids required for effective Epo mimetic action. Then we systematically altered the amino acids in those peptides, and simulated the complex to observe the differences between the altered peptides with the original ones. Based on these results, we designed new EMPs of potential significance. In order to fast identify the mimetic action of these new peptides, we synthesized these peptides and labeled the EpoR binding peptide (EBP) with Quantum dots [2] , to study the binding of these new EMPs to EpoR. Our results illustrate a principle for fast identifying receptor-specific sites importance for receptor internalization, and for enhancing sensitivity to hormones and other agonists. Blood vessel formation largely contributes to the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including ischemia and cancer [1] [2] . In this regard therapeutic strategies aim to stimulate vascular growth in ischemic tissues and suppress their formation in pathologies like in tumour and diabetic retinopathy. Placental growth factor (PlGF), an homolog of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), (42% amino acid sequence identity), stimulates angiogenesis and collateral growth in ischemic heart and limb. Whereas VEGF exerts it biological function through the binding to both VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1or Flt1) and VEGFR-2 (or KDR) PlGF binds specifically to Flt1. The complex PlGF/Flt1 constitutes a potential candidate for therapeutic modulation of angiogenesis and inflammation [3] . The binding between PlGF and Flt-1 has multipunctual features [4] and potential antagonist must have a sufficient molecular surface to spatially distant contact points. We have used an ELISA-like screening assay to select antagonists of PlGF/Flt-1 complex from a large random library of tetrameric unnatural peptides (complexity: 3^30=27.000 molecules) identifying two active molecules with an about 10 M IC50. The relative stability of identified peptides were assessed in human serum and their inhibitory properties were tested in a capillary-like tube formation assay performed with Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC The \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin is a cell adhesion receptor involved in angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion. The tripeptide motif RGD is the \u03b1v\u03b23 minimal recognition sequence and many RGD-containing peptides have been investigated as radiopharmaceuticals for targeting angiogenesis and tumor metastatic phenotype. Since RGD sequence binds also to other integrins, the aim of the present study was to develop and characterize a selective \u03b1v\u03b23 ligand suitable for imaging. A novel peptide containing the RGD loop covalently linked to an echistatin domain (cRGDechi) was designed, synthesized and then tested for selective binding to \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin. A panel of peptides were used for comparison. Adhesion assays showed that the novel peptide was able to inhibit adhesion of \u03b1v\u03b23 overexpressing cells but not \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 overexpressing clones. In conclusion the novel peptide showed a high affinity and specificity for \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin. The design of new molecules, based on the lead compound presented here, is currently ongoing with the aim at developing novel anticancer drugs and/or new class of diagnostic noninvasive tracers as suitable tools for \u03b1v\u03b23 -targeted therapy and imaging. Background and aims: Short peptides like Leu-Pro-Phe-Phe-Asp (LPFFD) and Leu-Pro-Tyr-Phe-Asp-amide (LPYFDa) can influence the structure and aggregation of \u00df-amyloid peptides. Soto's pentapeptide LPFFD has been published as a \u00df-sheet breaker (BSB). It is necessary to gain more information about the nature of the interaction of A\u00df and the pentapeptides mentioned above for the understanding of their action and for the possible development of future therapeutic agents. Methods: In this study radioligand binding assay, diffusion ordered NMR spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism and FT-infrared spectroscopy was used.",

Here we present a new method to produce identical copies of arrays on microscope slides. The peptides are synthesized on modified cellulose-discs, using a variation of the SPOT-method introduced by Ronald Frank more than 10 years ago [1] . The new array format overcomes several limitations of the SPOT-method, e.g. the low throughput with only one copy of the library and the large sample volumes that are needed for membrane incubations. For the presented arrays modified cellulose discs with covalently bound peptides are dissolved after synthesis. The resulting solutions can be spotted onto glass slides by conventional spotting techniques. Three dimensional layers of cellulosepeptide molecules are formed on the surface of the supports used for spotting. A virtually unlimited number of identical arrays can be printed and assays are performed with a sample volume of 100 \u00b5l or less. As application example we show mapping experiments of the streptavidin recognition site with a peptide library containing histidine-proline motives. Because of the much higher peptide loading compared to conventional arrays, the formed 3-dimensional structure might be superior for protein-interaction studies with even low binding constants. [ The interaction between the cap binding protein, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E, and the scaffolding protein eIF4G is critical for the formation of the heterotrimeric eIF4F translation initiation (TI) complex (eIF4E/eIF4G/eIF4A). Elevated levels of eIF4E and eIF4G found in several human solid tumor cancers and the induction of malignant transformation in animal models by overexpression of eIF4E and the reversal of this phenotype by treatment with anti-sense RNA, suggest the importance of the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction in the excessive translation of oncogenic proteins. eIF4G binds to eIF4E through a conserved eIF4E-binding motif YX4L (non-specified (X) and hydrophobic ( ) amino acids) that interacts with an hydrophobic hot spot on eIF4E. We report here the identification of a putative eIF4E anionic exosite that is distinct from the hot spot and contributes to the binding of eIF4G-derived ligands.",

Structure prediction programs identify four different domains for GPBP: An N-terminal domain showing pleckstrin homology (PH domain); a central domain with high tendency to form coiled-coils; a domain with WW features; and a C-terminal START domain ('StAR-related lipid-transfer'). Using the TANGO algorithm [2] , we have identified several aminoacid sequences in the GPBP START domain of vertebrates with high tendency to participate in protein aggregation. In this work we present the synthesis and structural characterization of a collection of peptides derived from the sequences described above. We recently developed a combinatorial library screening protocol to identify HPQ-containing cyclopeptides that bind streptavidin more tightly than its linear analogues. The relative affinities in IC50 of these structurally constrained ligands and its linear counterparts were measured by a captured enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. However, their intrinsic binding kinetics remained to be elucidated. In this work, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was employed to directly determine the kinetics and thermodynamics of the ligands binding to a streptavidin chip. Solid-phase peptide synthesis was carried out using standard Fmoc chemistry. SPR experiments were carried out using BIAcore3000 optical biosensor. Streptavidin was immobilized onto a CM5 sensor chip using the standard amine coupling procedure. The equilibrium dissociation constants and kinetic on/off rates of N-to-side chain and N-to-C cyclopeptides were deduced by Scatchard analysis and computational simulation, respectively. It was found that both cyclopeptides exhibited similar binding kinetics and bound streptavidin far more avidly than its linear form (1000-fold). In addition, the reversed (QPH) linear and cyclic peptidyl ligands were hardly recognized by streptavidin. Not only the binding specificity was distinguished qualitatively, but also the entropic advantage acquired by the pre-organized conformation over its linear analogues was demonstrated quantitatively by SPR in this study. The mutation of tumour suppressor genes in the progression of cancer is well characterized. For example, p53 is found to be mutated in approximately 50% of cancers and the loss of this proteins activity has been shown to lead to the deregulation of cell growth and apoptosis. The potential of peptide aptamers to inhibit protein/protein interactions in a highly specific manner makes them very attractive as research reagents or as target validation tools in anti-cancer drug discovery. More interestingly, these molecules have the potentially to inhibit the activity of proteins which are key regulators of cancer cell growth and therefore could act as synthetic tumour suppressor proteins. We used peptides based on known protein/protein interactions, as well as peptides isolated using display technologies, for the design of protein aptamers that were used to analyze pathways critical in controlling cancer cell growth. A range of scaffolds were used to present these peptides in an effort to optimize the peptides activities. Data relating to the activity of these peptide aptamers in vitro as well as in cellular systems will be discussed. The cyclic undecapeptide urotensin II (U-II) is the endogenous agonist for the U-II receptor (UT), a Gq coupled GPCR. Current views suggest that binding by agonist, but not antagonist, leads to induction of stabilization of an active receptor conformation. We have previously probed the interactions of urotensin II with rat UT (rUT) using a series of photolabile U-II analogues containing p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (Bpa). It was found that ",

Therefore, these enzymes are considered as important therapeutic target proteins. The interactions of JNK with peptides are of special interest for development of novel specific ATP-noncompetitive inhibitors. Interactions of this kinase and its mutants with various substrates were demonstrated in vivo using yeast Ras-recruitment system. Bioinformatical tools have been developed to predict optimized binding peptides as well as to correlate sequence position and amino acid with binding effiency to extract binding determinants. Biomolecular interaction analysis have been performed for selected peptide sequences using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. Real time measurements of the binding of peptides to the different isoforms JNK2 and JNK3 resulted in the determination of affinities as well as kinetic constants for association and dissociation. Experimental results and their bioinformatic analysis are discussed with respect to critical features of potential ATPnoncompetitive inhibitors.

The C-terminal helix does not interact with Fc but it is necessary for the correct folding and immunoglobulin recognition of the B-domain. To search for new peptide analogues of the C-terminal helix that bind the N-terminal fragment, a \u00a8one-bead one-compound\u00a8 library of 300 peptides was designed based on the sequence of the C-terminal helix. Active peptides were obtained after incubation of the library with the N-terminal fragment and rabbit immunoglobulin G labelled with fluorescein. New peptides were found and their sequences identified by MALDI TOF-TOF mass spectrometry. The synthesis of the two most active peptides was carried out and the binding with the N-terminal fragment was confirmed by CD spectroscopy. The Nterminal fragment peptide showed an increase in helicity when the C-terminal wild type peptide or some analogues were present in solution. The complete domains with the C-terminal fragment mutations were synthesized and structurally characterized by CD and NMR spectroscopy. The wild type and the new mutants adopt predominantly an alpha-helical structure. The interaction between rabbit immunoglobulin G and the wild type B-domain and the new analogues was investigated using surface plasmon resonance. Although compared with the wild type, the mutants exhibited different kinetics, they were able to bind the immunoglobulin with high affinity.",

SFTI-1 possesses one reactive site located at the Lys5-Thr6 peptide bond and therefore is able to interact with the enzyme in a 1:1 stoichiometry. In this report we describe chemical synthesis and kinetic studies of a series of SFTI-1 analogues containing double sequences of the wild inhibitor. Their structures contain combinations of disulfide bridges and/or head-to-tail cyclization. Each of these analogues contains two trypsin-specific reactive sites. We expect that kinetic studies should answer the question whether such dimeric analogues are able to interact simultaneously with more then one trypsin molecule and how this fact affects their inhibitory potency. In addition, we alsopresenttwo analogues in which we substituted the disulfide bridge with a carbonyl one. Since carbonyl bridge has not been previously introduced into molecules proteinase inhibitors, we decided to check its impact on the activity and proteolytic stability of such modified analogues. ",

            "text": "Ubiquitination, the covalent attachment of one or multiple polymerized ubiquitins is a post-translational modification of proteins, which has manifold functions. It mainly determines the protein for degradation, but also activation, deactivation or substrate alteration. Due to its ubiquitinous distribution in all eucarionts no high-affinity antibodies could be originated. Highaffinity ligand peptides are of interest to study ubiqutination. Based on bioinformatical considerations and investigations of ubiquitin-interacting proteins short peptide sequences were selected. By using a peptide array specific ubiquitin binding was monitored and quantified with label free detection based on Reflectometric Interference Spectroscopy (RIfS). The results from RIfS were confirmed by detection of binding in solution with Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) using carboxyfluorescein and S0387-labelled peptide amides. Binding constants were determined by Isothermal Calorimetry (ITC) and RIfS. Finally 1H,15N-NMR chemical shift analyses of the peptides with the highest affinity were carried out, which allowed the localisation of the interaction site of ubiquitin with the peptide The results from all four methods correlated very good. They showed fast equilibria within 30 s and binding constants down to the low micromolar range. NMR results revealed hints for discrimination possibilities between Lys48 and Lys63 polymerized ubiquitins. ( 101F is a potent neutralizing mAb that binds the human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) F protein and is a promising candidate for clinical development. The majority of neutralizing antibodies to HRSV F protein map to two regions of the protein designated site II and site IV,V,VI. To further characterize the 101F epitope, we employed a trypsin digestion of a HRSV F protein-101F mAb complex, followed by mass spectrometry analysis of the resulting recovered mAb bound peptide. One peptide at m/z 3330 was captured by the 101F mAb. Sequence assignment was based upon mass and matched with the database from a virtual digest. This peptide was assigned as residues 420-445 [TKCTASNKNRGIIKTFSNGCDYVSNK] of the HRSV F protein which spans antigenic site IV,V,VI. To further delineate the epitope, the binding of 101F mAb to a series of peptides corresponding to antigenic site IV,V,VI in the HRSV F protein was determined. Based on the peptide ELISA data, the 101F-binding region could be reduced to 422-436 sequence [CTASNKNRGIIKTFS] . As demonstrated by the substitution analysis, R429 and K433 significantly contribute to epitope binding, but another positively charged residue, K427 makes a minor contribution to the binding. Both, the peptide ELISA and proteolytic digestion of the mAb-antigen complex approaches identified the same region of HRSV F protein as being critical for the binding of 101F. Furthermore, these data confirm the results obtained using complementing genetic approaches using a panel of mutations in recombinantly expressed F protein and selection of antibody escape virus mutants (data not presented). The recently identified uracil-DNA specific nuclease (UDE) is the first representative of a new family of nucleases. The protein sequence has no detectable homology to other proteins except a group of sequences present in genomes of other pupating insects (Vertessy et al, submitted). To analyze the physiological function of this protein, peptide conjugates were prepared to serve as synthetic antigens for the generation of antibodies against isoforms of dUTPase, an enzyme inherently involved in preventing the synthesis of uracil-DNA [1, 2] . We used poly[Lys(Seri-DL-Alam)] (SAK) as a synthetic branched polypeptide [3] or bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a natural macromolecular carrier. Peptides were prepared by solid phase method utilizing Syro2000 (MulltiSynTech GmbH, Germany) peptide synthesizer, using Fmoc chemistry and DIPCI/HOBt-mediated coupling on Rink-amid MBHA resin. A C-terminal Cys(Acm) was added to the native sequences for incorporation of SH group into the peptide. In case of SAK choroacetylated polypeptide was conjugated with SH-peptide to form thioether linkage. The maleimidobenzoyil-N-hydroxyszukcinimid (MBS) derivative of BSA was used to introduce the peptide into the macromolecule. ",

Recent studies have shown that single paratope peptides might be well capable to mimic corresponding antigen ligands [1, 2] , suggesting that paratope peptides from a native antibody might have many advantages, e.g. for molecular vaccine design and targeting. We have developed a new method for identification of paratope-containing peptides by proteolytic affinity-proteome analysis in combination with high resolution FTICR-mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) [3] . In the present study we used hen eggwhite lysozyme (HEL) and a polyclonal rabbit anti-lysozyme antibody (HELpAb) as a model system. The direct determination of paratope peptides was obtained by selective binding of a DTT-cleavage mixture of the anti-lysozyme antibody to immobilised HEL, followed by proteolytic digestion of the antibody-antigen complex (paratope excision, PAREXPROT). Two specific paratope peptides were identified by MALDI-FTICR-MS, and the corresponding peptide sequences were identified by database search within a 1-2 ppm threshold. Additionally, the identified paratope peptides were synthesised and characterised by affinity mass spectrometry, which ascertained their full binding specificity to lysozyme. ",

            "text": "The propeptide blocks the active site of inactive zymogen of cathepsin D and is cleaved off during maturation. We have designed a set of peptidic fragments derived from the propeptide structure and evaluated their inhibitory potency against mature cathepsin D using kinetic activity assay. The mapping localized two segments in the propeptide involved in the inhibitory interaction with the enzyme core: N-terminus of propeptide plays a major role and the active site anchor plays a minor role according to their respective Ki values. In addition, a fragment derived from the mature N-terminus of cathepsin D displayed inhibition, which supports its proposed regulatory role. The mechanism of interaction of both propeptide segments was characterized by the mode of inhibition and by spatial modeling of propeptide in cathepsin D zymogen. Using fluorescence polarization measurements, Kd in nanomolar range was determined for the N-terminal propeptide segment. The inhibitory potency of the active site anchor segment was modulated by Ala38Val mutation that was reported to be associated with cathepsin D pathology. . By comparing the resulting low-energy conformations using different sets of atoms, specific conformational features common only to the high/medium affinity compounds were identified. They included the spatial arrangement of the three most important pharmacophoric side chains Tyr2, Arg4, and Nal5 as well as the orientation of the Xaa3-Arg4 amide bond, which together represent a \"minimalistic\" 3D pharmacophore model for binding of the cyclopentapeptide antagonists to CXCR4. This model rationalizes the data for the cyclopentapeptides as well as for the peptidomimetic CXCR4 antagonist KRH-1636. Automated docking of the pharmacophore model to the 3D structure of the TM region of CXCR4 revealed that the pharmacophoric groups of the cyclopentapeptide ligands were involved in favorable interactions with their counterparts in CXCR4. For instance, the hydroxyl group of Tyr2 formed a hydrogen bond with Lys38, the guanidino group of Arg4 formed a salt bridge with Glu288, and the backbone carbonyl of Xaa3-Arg4 formed a hydrogen bond with Lys282. This finding gives additional support for the suggested 3D pharmacophore model, and also provides opportunities for rational design of CXCR4 mutants to map potential contacts with peptide ligands. With the successful completion of the human genome project, the next challenge is to assimilate enormous amount of genetic information generated and to assign functions to a large number of proteins encoded. Although the DNA chip technology to detect the abundance of mRNAs has been established, it is known that the abundance of mRNAs and proteins does not correlate. Thus, protein detection methods for reproducible and quantitative investigation of protein networks are strongly required. We attempted to establish a novel protein detection system based on a fluorescent measurement that does not require labeling of target molecules and preparation of secondary antibodies. We focused on a steric hindrance caused by the interaction between a target protein and a specific capture agent. When a target protein interacts with a specific capture agent immobilized on solid surface, we assumed that a steric hindrance in the vicinity of a capture agent increases. In order to detect the differences in the steric hindrance, we utilized a fluorescent system with the Staudinger reaction. This reaction is a chemical ligation between a phosphine and an azide group. These two functionalities are unreactive with protein surfaces under biological conditions. We incorporated an azide group into an immobilized capture agent and investigated the efficiency in the Staudinger reaction between the azide and an external triphenyl phosphine derivative. It was found that a target protein bound to the capture agent immobilized onto the solid support interferes with the efficiency in the Staudinger reaction. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has a crucial role to initiate the immune response via the binding of the peptide fragments (epitopes) of foreign antigens and their presentation to the T-cell receptors (TCR). The co-receptor molecule CD4 enhances the binding between TCR and MHC II. Small molecules that mimic surfaces of MHC-II may lead to blockage of the autoimmune response and the development of drugs for immunotherapy. HLA-DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201 (DQ2) and HLA-DQA1*0501/DQB1*0301 (DQ7) are highly correlated to autoimmune diseases as Sjogren Syndrome (SS) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The non polymorphic \u03b2 regions of the modelled HLA-DQ7, which are exposed to the solvent and may disrupt the interaction of DQ7 with CD4+ T lymphocytes were determinated using the GETAREA program. It was found that the regions 133-140 (Arg-Asn-Asp-Gln-Glu-Glu-Thr-Thr) and 59-66 (Glu-Tyr-Trp-Asn-Ser-Gln-Lys-Glu) display the highest solvent accessibility. Peptide analogs of these regions were synthesized, by the Fmoc/OtBu solid phase strategy, purified by RP-HPLC and characterized by mass spectrometry ESI-MS. The dimeric analogs of the peptides, designed to mimic the superdimeric nature of the immunosuppressory fragments of HLA class II molecules were also synthesized and investigated.",

Soto's pentapeptide LPFFD and LPYFD-amide synthesized in our laboratory are neuroprotective agents against A\u03b2 assemblies both in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism of their neuroprotective effect has not yet been fully understood. Methods: transmission electron microscopy (TEM), CD, FT-IR, diffusion ordered NMR spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and radioligand binding assays were used. Results: all the methods applied showed that the pentapeptides mentioned above do not break the fibrillar structure of A\u03b2, that is these molecules are not real \u03b2-sheet breakers (BSB). The pentapeptides bind to A\u03b2 fibrils and cause small structural changes by intercalating into the A\u03b2 assemblies. Fibrils of A\u03b2 survive one week treatment with the pentapeptides using them in 2 to 5-time molar excess. Conclusion: All the results in our laboratory show that the short peptides have long-term interaction on A\u03b2-assemblies. In the first step they bind tightly to the A\u03b2 surface and prevent further interaction of A\u03b2 fibrils with the neuronal membranes. After this step the short peptides can be built into the structure of A\u03b2-assemblies with intercalation causing a less ordered \u03b2-conformation. Proteolytic enzymes (neprilisin, IDE) could cleave and hydrolyze A\u03b2 peptides after this structural change, therefore the short peptides are good drug candidates for the treatment of AD. ",

[2, 3] Moreover, multivalent peptide polymers have been developed for the intracellular targeting of proteins. [4] This methodology was now extended to the inhibition of PEPTIDE-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS by small molecules. For this purpose, we have composed a library of 20,000 small molecules by algorithmic searching of a database of bioactive molecules with virtually designed substructures (fragments). High throughput assays were developed on the basis of fluorescence and fluorescence polarization detection. Despite the scepticism regarding the inhibition of protein-protein interactions with small molecules, efficient hit molecules have been developed for several intracellular targets and were subjected to synthetic variation and cellular follow-up assays. The essential event in platelet adhesion to the blood vessel wall after injury or in thrombosis is the binding to sub-endothelial collagen of plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF), a protein which interacts transiently with platelet glycoprotein (GP) IbAlpha , slowing circulating platelets to facilitate their firm adhesion through other collagen receptors, e.g. integrin Alpha2beta1 and GPVI. To locate theVWF-binding site in collagen III; we synthesized 57 overlapping triple-helical peptides which comprise the whole native sequence of collagen III . Peptide #23 (GPOGPSGPRGQOGVMGFOGPKGND (O is hydroxyproline)) alone bound VWF, with an affinity comparable to that of native collagen III. Immobilized peptide #23 supported platelet adhesion under static and flow conditions, processes blocked by an antibody which prevents the VWF A3 domain from binding full-length collagen. Truncated and alaninesubstituted triple-helical peptides derived from #23 either strongly interacted with both VWF and platelets, or lacked both VWF and platelet binding. Thus, we identified the sequence RGQOGVMGF as the minimal VWF-binding sequence in collagen III. The present work completes our understanding of the collagen-VWF interaction, providing information on crucial sequences in collagen that perfectly complements our existing knowledge of the collagen-binding site in VWF and may assist in targeting the collagen-VWF interaction for therapeutic purposes Solid phase assay systems such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and overlay gels are used to study processes of protein-protein and protein-peptide interactions. The common principle of all these methods is that they monitor the binding between soluble and surfaceimmobilized molecules. Following the use of bovine serum albumin (BSA)-peptide conjugates or isolated synthetic peptides and the above-mentioned solid phase assay systems, we were able to demonstrate that positively charged peptides, which would be expected to repulse each other, can interact with each other. Both the ELISA and SPR methods showed that the binding process reached saturation with Kd values ranging between 1 and 14 nM. No interaction was observed between BSA conjugates bearing positively charged peptides and conjugates bearing negatively charged peptides or with pure BSA molecules, strengthening the view that interaction occurs only between positively charged peptides. However, interactions between the same peptides were not observed in solution when was monitored by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or by native gel electrophoresis.",

The relevance of our findings for the use of solid phase assay systems to study interactions between biomolecules will be discussed. The hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a mammalian hematopoiesis-specific Ste20 kinase, contains a cluster of four proline-rich sequences called P1, P2, P3 and P4 located after the kinase domain. These Pro-rich regions play an important role in the interactions of this kinase with different adapter proteins. Previous studies showed that P1, which contains the canonical PxxPxR motif, and P2 and P4 with the canonical PxxPxK motif interact with the C-terminal SH3 domain of hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein 1 (HS1) even if with different affinity. HS1 protein shares a high amino acid sequence and structural similarity to cortactin although their functions differ considerably. Here we report the results of our investigation on the interaction between the C-terminal SH3 domain of cortactin and the four proline-rich motifs of HPK1. These interactions were analyzed by non-immobilized ligand interaction assay by circular dichroism (NILIA-CD). Upon peptide addition, the binding was monitored by the CD changes of the Trp side-chains of the conjugate GST-SH3cort. The dissociation constants Kd were determined analyzing the CD data at 294 nm using a nonlinear regression method. The results demonstrate that GST-SH3cort displays an affinity binding higher than that found with the corresponding HS1 domain and that the four HPK1 Pro-rich regions are not equivalent. P2 appears to bind with the highest affinity (Kd=0.5 \u00b5M), followed by P1 (Kd=10 \u00b5M) and P4 (Kd=33 \u00b5M), whilst P3 does not interact at all. The generation of a fibrin clot is mediated by the regulated activation of a series of serine proteases and their cofactors. Factor VIII in its activated form, FVIIIa, acts as a cofactor to the serine protease FIXa, in the conversion of the zymogen FX to the active enzyme FXa. Both FVIII and FIX are essential for normal coagulation, deficiencies of either are associated with the bleeding diatheses hemophilia A and B, respectively. The role of FVIIIa is to bind factor IXa, generating the phospholipid-dependent intrinsic factor Xase complex. At least two interactive sites have been identified for the enzyme-cofactor interaction. The Ser558-Gln565 region within the A2 subunit has been shown to be crucial for VIIIa-IXa interaction.",

These dimeric proteins show very high specificity in recognition of natural ligands. For example, \u03b14\u03b21 integrin recognizes VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) and fibronectin through binding amino acid motifs TQIDSPLN and LDV, respectively. On the other hand, fibronectin is a classical ligand for \u03b15\u03b21 integrin with the recognition motif RGD. As shown, identification of the integrin ligands occurs through small recognition amino acid sequences (mostly tripeptides).

It transforms non-covalent complexes into covalent complexes, which renders characterization of the adduct by classical techniques (mass spectroscopy, NMR,\u2026) much easier. The aim of our research is to develop a new method for peptide-DNA cross-linking involving the incorporation of a furan moiety. The strategy is inspired by the naturally occurring process of oxidative furan ring opening by Cytochrome P450. The resulting cis-butene-1,4-dial has been shown to react with amino-and sulfhydryl groups of macromolecules such as proteins and DNA. In our research, DNA binding peptides are modified with a furan moiety and then chemically oxidized into a reactive enal. This enal can react with DNA to form a covalent peptide-DNA complex. Previous attempts to selectively oxidize furan modified minor groove binding peptides consisting of N-methylpyrrole building blocks failed. We are now applying the same strategy on major groove binding peptides consisting of natural amino acids. Currently the oxidation conditions are being optimized so that the furan moiety undergoes selective oxidation. These optimized conditions will be applied to known DNA binding peptides, in order to obtain a peptide-DNA cross-link. We coupled octanoyl or palmitoyl group to the N-terminus of an analogue of SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptide, SV126-133(Ser128) to investigate the effect of fatty acid chain length on the conformation of the lipopeptide-antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) complexes and to establish the optimal peptide/ODN molar ratio (rM) for the effective delivery of ODN into the cells. The ODNs used in this study were targeted towards either the green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNA and the junction sequence between EWS and Fli1 genes. The conformational change of ODN at different rM values was followed by circular dichroism (CD), attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The SV40 peptide-mediated ODN transfer into NIH/3T3 cells was studied by epifluorescence microscopy. The interaction between the HIV-1 regulatory protein Rev and Rev responsive element (RRE) of HIV-1 mRNA has emerged in the last decade as an important target in antiviral therapy. The Rev-RRE interaction is essential for the replication of HIV. The Rev protein binds to the RRE site located in the env coding region of the full length viral mRNA and facilities the export of the RNA from the nucleus, while protecting it from the cell's splicing machinery. In the published NMR structure of the RRE/Rev-derived peptide complex, an -helical segment of Rev binding domain recognises a specific region of RRE. An approach is described to design a new class of -hairpin peptidomimetic ligands for HIV-1 Rev protein, which inhibit its binding to the RRE RNA. A model -hairpin peptide served as a scaffold to pre-organise side chains into a geometry similar to that seen in a helical peptide. A library of peptidomimetics was prepared by grafting sequences related to the RNA recognition element in Rev onto a hairpin-inducing D-Pro-L-Pro template. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that all of the designed peptidomimetics bind to RRE and the best examples show affinities (Kd) in a nanomolar range. These new ligands show a novel approach to designing Rev peptidomimetics, represent interesting leads for the development of more potent HIV RRE/Rev inhibitors and permit more detailed studies of the mechanism of binding to RNA.",

Binding of Tat to TAR is mediated by a 9-amino-acid, highly basic Arg49-Lys-Lys-Arg52-Arg-Gln-Arg-Arg-Arg57 sequence of the ARM (arginine rich motif); the key role in these interactions is played by Arg52.

Once blocked the two OS endogenous conductances (the cGMP channels by light and the retinal exchanger by removing one of the transported ion species from both sides of the membrane, i.e. K+, Na+ or Ca2+), the OS membrane resistance (Rm) could be >5 G\u038f. Therefore, any exogenous current can be studied down to the single channel level. Macroscopic currents of amplitude of ~300 pA were recorded in symmetric K+ or Na+ (>100 mM) and Ca2+ (1 mM) from the commercially available alamethicin mixture, the synthetic alamethicin F50/5 (a major component of the natural mixture), and selected analogues applied at 1 \u00b5M concentration at -20 mV. Once applied and removed the peptide, the current activates and deactivates with a time constant of about 160 ms. The synthetic analogues [Glu(OMe)7,18,19] and [Glu(OMe)18,19] produce a current of about 100 pA at 1 \u00b5M concentration, and they show a strong activation by hyperpolarization as alamethicin F50/5 itself. Clear single channel events were observed when the concentration of all of the alamethicin peptides is reduced to <250 nM.<BR> These results indicate that the three Gln residues at positions 7, 18 and 19 of alamethicin F50/5 are not a key factor for pore formation and its conduction properties. In general, the pore assembly and disassembly are very fast and cooperative events. The translocation mechanism of penetratin (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK) is not clear, but the involvement of cell membrane was supposed. Recent studies with phospholipid model membranes have shown that penetratin interacts only with negatively charged liposomes. We aimed to analyse the effect of penetratin on liposomes composed of different phospholipids (DPPC/DPPG 2:8-8:2) by fluorescence spectroscopy. In the first set of experiments, liposomes labelled with fluorescent markers (DPH, ANS and TMA-DPH) were incubated with penetratin and the fluorescence polarisation was determined as a function of the temperature. In the range of 15-200 mol/mol phospholipid/penetratin ratio, no change in the transition temperature was observed indicating that penetratin has no influence on the membrane structure. Next, we have analysed the interactions between phospholipids and penetratin through changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of the peptide due to the presence of two W residues in its sequence. Comparing the emission spectra corresponding to penetratin in aqueous media or in presence of vesicles one can clearly appreciate a blue shift. This indicates that that tryptophan residues are mainly exposed to a hydrophobic environment. Analysis of the main band shows low values of polarization suggesting a free motion of the peptide chain. On the contrary polarization measured for penetratin mixed with liposomes results in higher values. This indicates that hydrophobic residues, like Trp, are inserted into the bilayer and their motion is restricted. These data suggest the presence of interation sensed strongly by Trp properties. Cyclopeptide antibiotic gramicidin S (GS) has antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and some fungi. But non-specific action of GS and its high lytic potential limits therapeutic application of GS. We attempted to elucidate in which way GS molecule could be modified to lose its haemolytic side effects. GS molecule interacts directly with membrane phospholipids due to electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction. Naturally, changes in the state of a lipid bilayer cause changes in the GS molecule binding to a bilayer. We studied the effect of GS on human blood platelets and the effect of platelet membrane state on the GS-induced disaggregation of cells with the help of turbidimetric and microscopy techniques. We modified the membrane state by temperature, osmotic stress, ionizing irradiation, lipid oxidation. Depending on concentration GS causes platelet shape change and activation. When added to preliminary aggregated (in response to physiological agonists -thrombin, epinephrine, ADP) platelets, GS causes crumble of cells aggregates. The rate and extent of platelet disaggregation under the effect of GS non monotonously depends on temperature (range of 5-40\u00b0C) and irradiation dose (up to 200 Gy). Parameters of the GS interaction with membranes are determined by the mobility of membrane lipids. Factors modifying the lipid bilayer change the degree and the speed of the GS interaction with platelet membranes. Results obtained permit to use GS for testing the state of membrane lipids and on the other hand allow to suppose ways of GS molecule modifications to achieve its tolerance to blood cells.",

Antimicrobial peptides target the cell membrane directly, which is a key feature as evolution has shown bacteria have had difficulty in altering their membrane composition and organization to mount a suitable defence against these peptides. A common theory is that peptides that bind strongly exhibit high biological activity, but our real-time quantitative binding studies via surface plasmon resonance (SPR) have shown that this correlation does not always hold. As more information on the molecular details of membrane disruption is required, we have used Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to visualise peptide insertion and changes in membrane morphology by a range of antimicrobial peptides in situ. Interaction studies were performed with a series of phospholipid mixtures that mimic either mammalian cells (high in phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol) or microbial cells (high in phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol).

At low lipid:peptide ratios there were significant deviations from the usual hyperbolic-like partition behavior of peptide vesicle titration curves, especially in the case of the most anionic systems. Membrane saturation was shown to be related to such observations and mathematical models were derived to further characterize the peptide-lipid interaction under these conditions. The calculated peptide-to-lipid saturation proportions, together with the determined partition constants, suggest that the Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations of Omiganan pentahydrochloride could represent the conditions required for bacterial membrane saturation to occur. The hemolytic pore-forming toxin sticholysin II (StII) produced by the sea anemone Stichodactyla heliantus belongs to the actinoporin protein family. The N-terminal domain of these proteins is required for interaction with membranes. To investigate the role of StII\u00b4s N-terminal domain in membrane binding and in the molecular mechanism of hemolysis, peptides corresponding to residues 1 to 35, or shorter fragments from this region, were synthesized. In some peptides Leu was replaced by Trp. All peptides exhibited hemolytic activity, albeit to a lesser extent than the whole protein. Moreover, peptides lacking the 1-14 hydrophobic stretch were less active. The longer peptides were also able to permeabilize phospholipid vesicles. Conformational studies were performed in aqueous solution and in membranemimicking environments. CD spectra showed that, while the shorter, more hydrophilic peptides, displayed a random conformation, the longer peptides underwent aggregation with increasing concentration, pH, and ionic strength. In the presence of trifluoroethanol and upon binding to detergent micelles and phospholipid bilayers, the peptides showed a propensity to acquire -helical conformation, as expected for the sequence comprising residues 14 to 26. Fluorescence spectra demonstrated that the first residues of StII\u00b4s N-terminus penetrate more deeply into the bilayer, whereas residues 14-26 are located more superficially. This is in agreement with the predicted amphipathic nature of the helix formed by these residues and corroborates the existing hypotheses for the role of the N-terminal domain in the process of membrane insertion and pore formation.

It was shown that the optimal conditions are: dimethylformamide-acetonitrile mixture 20:80 (v/v), initial concentrations -85 mM, and enzyme-to-substrate ratio -1:3900. This approach was used in order to synthesize analogous substrates, containing different fluorogenic and chromogenic groups as well as other amino acids in P1position. The obtained substrates were tested for the papain assay. Peptidyl-a-ketoaldehydes 3 represent attractive lead compounds and intermediates in the development of potent protease inhibitors due to their structural similarity with peptide aldehydes, previously known to be excellent inhibitors of serine-and cysteine protease. Recently, we demonstrated the application of polymer cyano methylene-and carboxylato methylene phosphoranes in the assembly of a-hydroxy-b-amino esters (norstatines), a,b-diketoesters, and a,b-unsaturated ketones. [1, 2, 3] We now present a further development of our reagent linker 2 approach employing peptidyl-a-ketoaldehydes 3 and diamino propanoles 4. Carboxylato methylen phosphoranes 1 derived from bromo acetic esters which are readly acylated without racemization, play the key role in our synthetic concept. Herein we show the oxidative cleavage to peptidyl-a-ketoaldehydes 3 using dimethyldioxirane (DMD) in acetone as oxidant, after saponification and decarboxylation on the solid support. Diamino propanoles 4 were furnished via the reductive amination of resin-bound peptides. Over the past few years Nuclear Magnetic Resonance has emerged as a powerful means for lead molecular identification and optimization.On the other hand, the 19F NMR has been used succesfully in several structural studies, protein folding studies and for the identification of active compounds, using a very similar methodology that the one used in the present work. The methodology required the labeling of the substrate with a CF3 moiety. The enzymatic reaction is performed with the CF3 substrate and quenched, using an enzyme inhibitor. 19F NMR is then used to monitor the evolution of both substrate and product. Only two peaks are observed, the starting substrate and the cleaved substrate. This NMR method has some advantages: Fluorine NMR is very sensitive, 0,83 times that of the proton. There are no spectral interference from protonated solvents, buffers or detergents typically present in the enzymatic reactions.The 19F isotropic chemical shift is extremely sensitive to small structural perturbations resulting in different chemical shift for the signals of the substrate and product. Isotopic labeling of the protein is not required. As a model, Caspase-8, which play a critical role in the initiation of apoptosis process5 and HIV-1 protease were chosen. Two different kind of libraries were screened: One based on natural products from plant and animal extracts used in tradicional Chinese medicine and a second one corresponding of a synthetic library with two sublibraries of 160 and 144 compounds.With this methodology it has been possible to identify some compounds with very promising inhibitory properties. Background and aims: Human kallikrein 2 (hK2), a prostate specific serine protease, regulates the activity of several factors that may participate in proteolytic cascades promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, inhibition of its enzymatic activity is a potential way of preventing growth and metastasis of prostate cancer. Moreover, specific ligands for hK2 have potential use for targeting and in vivo imaging of prostate cancer and for development of novel assays. Methods: To find peptide ligands we panned several phage display peptide libraries against active recombinant hK2 captured by a monoclonal antibody exposing the active site of the enzyme. Alanine scanning and amino acid deletion analyses were performed to elucidate the motifs required for hK2 inhibition. Results: From libraries expressing 10 and 11 amino acid long linear peptides we isolated six different hK2-binding peptides. Three of these peptides are specific inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of hK2. Amino acid substitution and deletion studies indicated that motifs of 6 amino acids are necessary for the inhibitory activity. Conclusions: We have developed specific hK2 inhibitors by phage display technology. These novel hK2 specific peptides are potentially useful for treatment and targeting of prostate cancer.

As a prime executor of regulated proteolysis, the proteasome controls almost all aspects of cell metabolism from signal transduction to cell cycle and differentiation. Pharmacological intervention into proteasome activity leads to cell apoptosis. This observation was applied to successfully treat multiple myeloma, since the cancer cells exhibit substantially higher sensitivity to competitive inhibition of proteasome than normal cells. However, the complete shutting down of the proteasome catalyzed proteolysis leads to serious side effects resulting from the disruption of proteolytic homeostasis even in noncancerous cells. Here, we show an alternative approach to control the proteasome activity using peptide based noncompetitive regulators. The cathelicidins derived peptides rich in proline and arginine (PR) residues have been found to affect activity of all the proteasome complexes both in vivo and in vitro, likely by binding to the face of the enzyme. Mechanism and structural constrains of the PR peptides dictating their influence on the proteasome remain elusive. Our results indicate that there are three sequence related properties of the PR peptides controlling their effectiveness as proteasome regulators: length of the peptide, distribution of a set of positive charges at the peptide N-terminus, and positioning of proline residues. Far UV CD spectroscopy demonstrates that these properties also correlate with the structure of PR peptides. In particular, it seems that structural propensity of the PR peptides to form beta-turns are required to bind to proteasome as regulatory competent molecules. ",

HIV protease inhibitors have been highly effective in treating Aids patients and it is hoped that potent inhibitors of the beta secretases will also prove effective in treating Alzheimer's disease. Therefore inhibitors of the aspartyl proteases have great therapeutic potential. We have shown that the peptide glyoxals are potent inhibitors of the thiol protease papain and of the serine proteases subtilisin and chymotrypsin. Using 13C-NMR we have been able to show that glyoxal inhibitors react reversibly with an active site nucleophile in these enzymes to form a tetrahedral adduct which is tightly bound by the enzyme.",

Alzheimer`s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older people. A major factor in the pathogenesis of AD is the cerebral deposition of amyloid fibrils, consisting of amyloid \u03b2 peptides (A\u03b2), as senile plaque. The 40-to 42 amino acid long A\u03b2 is generated by the proteolysis of \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2-and \u03b3-secretases. Since BACE1, a unique member of the pepsin family of aspartyl proteases initiates the pathogenic processing of APP by cleaving at the N-terminus it is a molecular target for therapeutic intervention in AD Proteolytic activity was found to occur, to a variable degree, in digestive organs of all studied organisms over the entire pH range. The common feature was the existence of two activity peaks, in the acid (pH 2.5 -3.5) and alkaline (pH 7.5 -8.5) zones, as well as a similar protease set containing E and D cathepsins, a trypsin-like enzyme, elastase, and collagenolytic proteases. Proteolytic activity in the hepatopancreas of crab and sea star was found to be an order higher than in other study objects. High protease activity in crab hepatopancreas is an evolutionary mechanism compensating for a poor differentiation of digestive system, low substrate specificity of enzymes, and cold environment. Trypsin activity in digestive organs of invertebrates suggests that a trypsin-like enzyme is a genetically old one, an evolutionary origin of all serine proteases. A difference of kind between vertebrates and invertebrates is that the latter have cathepsine activity (absent in vertebrates) and no pepsin activity. ",

These compounds are prone to proteolytic degradation, are rapidly excreted and poorly bioavailable. The majority of this problems might be overcome by use of peptidomimetics with structures resembling those of previously synthesized peptidyl derivatives. Among the peptidomimetics are azapeptides, in which alpha-CH group of amino-acid residue is replaced by a nitrogen atom. The azapeptides have recently been demonstrated as potent and selective inhibitors of cathepsins B and K. It was shown that azapeptide inhibitors bind along the active site cleft of cathepsin B in a bent conformation. This bent structure is likely to result from the mobility of the bonds in the vicinity of the inserted azaamino acid residue as well as from the interaction with enzyme. In our present work we have studied the peptide of a sequence: Z-Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Ile-Val-OMe, which is characterized by one major and three minor conformations. The replacement of alpha-CH group in the Gly residue of peptide chain of Z-Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Ile-Val-OMe by the nitrogen atom likely results in rigid conformation.

Now SDS-PAGE analysis of the subviral particle preparations revealed several additional bands in a range of 9-23 kDa together with major viral proteins comparing to intact virions (Figure, M1matrix protein, f1-f5-M1 protein fragments, NP-nucleoprotein).

Several diseases like cancer metastasis, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic lymphocytic B-cell leukemia are linked to the interaction of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor to its natural ligand, the 68 amino acid protein stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1). [1] One strategy for the treatment of these diseases could be to block the interaction between CXCR4 and SDF-1\u03b1 with small CXCR4 antagonists. Furthermore, radiolabeling of suitable compounds with appropriate radioisotopes could provide agents for imaging of CXCR4 expression in vivo via PET. Previous studies by Fujii et al. on CXCR4 antagonists led to a high affinity cyclic pentapeptide with the sequence cyclo[Gly-D-Tyr-Arg-Arg-Nal]. [2] To further improve this structure, different approaches have been chosen with respect to metabolic stability, bioavailability, conformational rigidity and chemical versatility for radiolabeling. First, an N-methyl scan of the backbone amides was performed to influence conformational freedom and to increase metabolic stability and bioavailability. N-methylation of arginine residues yielded peptides with moderate affinity (IC<sub>50</sub>-values: 23nM (N-Me)Arg<sup>3</sup> and 31nM (N-Me)Arg<sup>4</sup>, resp.) whereas N-methylation of other amino acids significantly decreased the affinity (IC<sub>50</sub>>100nM). By substitution of Arg<sup>3</sup> by ornithine, the affinity was mostly retained. [3] The amino group of Orn can be alkylated or acylated via radiolabeled groups containing short lived isotopes. Moreover, the bioavailability should be improved as the high basicity of the two guanidino groups could be reduced. First ornithine-acylated derivatives showed IC<sub>50</sub> values between 11-35nM enabling for the first time <sup>18</sup>F-radiolabeling of small CXCR4 antagonists for PET imaging in vivo. Binding of ligands to integrins plays a major role in cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction of cells. These interactions are important not only for normal cell functions, but also in pathogenic processes. The v 3 integrin for example is involved in tumor cell adhesion and osteoporosis. The association of ligands is specific and requires minimal recognition sequences. Therefore, suppression of integrin activity using competitive inhibitors bears great pharmacological potential.",

Interactions of Src homology 2 (SH2) domains with phosphotyrosine (pY) containing ligands is critical for regulating cellular processes. The cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 contains two SH2 domains. An intramolecular interaction of the N-terminal SH2 domain with the catalytic (PTP) domain renders the enzyme inactive in the native state. Binding of a pY-ligand to SHP-1 N-SH2 leads to a conformational shift and the dissociation of the SH2-PTP complex [1] . In previous studies we investigated the topographical and conformational preferences of the N-SH2 domain of SHP-1 using conformationally restricted linear and cyclic peptides derived from the natural interaction partner Ros pY2267 [2] . We identified peptides that showed an increased binding affinity for the N-SH2 domain and partially inhibited Ros-mediated SHP-1 activity. On the basis of these results we hypothesized that an imperfect fit of the pY+1 and pY+3 side chains might be responsible for the inhibitory effect. In order to confirm this hypothesis we synthesized a new series of peptides and evaluated their biological activity. To better understand the role of each individual SH2 domain in the activation process we also determined the binding affinity against the C-SH2 domain and the activation profile of different SHP-1 mutants. Pull-down assays of the interactions of the pY-ligands with full length SHP-1 confirmed the results obtained for the binding to the individual SH2 domains. Proteins are targets for photo-destruction due to absorption of incident light by endogenous chromophores. Mass spectroscopic data presented evidence that structural modification observed upon irradiation of goat alpha-lactalbumin at 290 nm results from tryptophan (Trp) mediated cleavage of disulfide bonds [1] . The aim of the recent studies is to define structural elements that direct the destructive influence of near-UV light on the disulfide bridges of proteins.",

Therefore, in the present study, we investigate these crucial residues with electrophysiological recordings and rationally designed mutagenesis based upon our structural analysis of Kir1.1 tetramer. Lys-80 is located fairly close to the intracellular channel gate and protrudes its long side chain positive charge into the pore. This may interfere with the potassium flow by providing repulsion charge while pH is lowered, which pushes the channel towards its closed state. Mutation to Met-80 therefore reduces such pH-sensitivity. On the other hand, Arg-188 is supposed to be responsible for the maintenance of channel opening in the presence of PIP2. Loss of positive charge at this site may lead to the enhanced pH-sensitivity due to an abolished or reduced PIP2 interaction.

Recent findings of co-localization of CART and cholecystokinin (CCK)-A receptor (responsible for satiety effect of CCK) in brain and gastrointestinal tract suggest a neurochemical link between CART peptides and CCK. In normal fasted mice, CART(61-102) peptide decreased food intake after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration in a dose-dependent manner. Anorectic effect of CART peptide was enhanced by peripherally administered CCK-8, while CCK-A receptor antagonist, devazepide blocked the effect of CART peptide on food intake. We used two mouse obesity models in this study: monosodium glutamate (MSG) and diet-induced obese (DIO) C57Bl mice. Both DIO and MSG mice had substantially increased fat to body mass ratio compared to their controls and were hyperleptinemic. MSG mice were hypophagic and neither CART peptide nor CCK-8 and devazepide had any effect on food intake of these mice.

Our antimicrobial activity studies of these peptides show that the BM-1 peptide is active against microbe species as well as the native PG-1, whereas the BM-2 is completely inactive. The BM-1 analoque is shorter than native PG-1 and contains only three arginine residues, therefore is much cheaper in the chemical synthesis, what could be an advantage of this antimicrobial peptide. The conformational studies of both analogues were performed by using 2D 1H-NMR technique (in DMSO-d6) and molecular dynamics studies. The 3D solution structure of both analogues was established using interproton distances and torsion angles. For simulated annealing calculations the XPLOR program was used. Our conformational studies show that the BM-1 forms a regular beta-hairpin structure, which is very similar to that of the native PG-1 peptide, whereas the BM-2 analogue is very flexible, what could be a reason of the antimicrobial inactivity.

The paper investigates enzymatic systems in invertebrates, in particular, an enzymatic complex obtained from the hepatopancreas of red king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus, and clarifies its effect on the mechanism of chitin and chitosan hydrolysis. Chitinolytic activity was estimated with spectrophotometer using 4-(dimemylamine)-behzaldehyde method by the concentration of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine which is educed under chitinolysis. Total glycolytic activity was defined by the sum of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D(+)-glucosamine in the reaction with potassium hexaferricyanide (III). Content of D(+)glucosamine in the hydrolysates of chitin and chitosan was estimated by highly effective reverse-phase liquid chromatography (HELC) of aminosaccharides with ortho-phthalaldehyde. The paper studies the process of chitin and chitosan glycolysis and the effects of different factors (pH, temperature and time of incubation, enzyme/substrate ratio) on the total glycolytic activity of the enzymatic complex from crab hepatopancreas, which is compared with a previously studied proteolytic and exochitinase activities. A mechanism of enzymatic hydrolysis of chitin and chitosan is suggested. Study results allowed the following conclusions concerning glycolytic and deacetylase activity of EP: 1) EP induces the formation of a monomer (N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) and oligomers (chitin and chitosan) with low deacetylation. Thus, EP is characterised by a marked endochitinase (endochitosanase) activity; 2) N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase and, apparently, exochitosanase activity was not revealed;",

In order to develop potent \u00b5-opioid agonists, the dimerization of Tyr or Dmt through diaminoalkanes [2] or 3,6-bis-(aminoalkyl)-2(1H)-pyrazinones [3] resulted in production of unique opioidmimetics with high receptor affinities and potent biological activities [3] . Methods: The synthesis of opioids and opioidmimetics and the determination of their receptor binding characteristics were performed as described previously [1] [2] [3] . Results and Conclusion: Newly synthesized 3-(Tyr-NH-butyl)-6-(Tyr-NH-propyl)-2(1H) pyrazinone and 3-(Tyr-NH-propyl)-6-(Tyr-NH-butyl)-2(1H) pyrazinones (I and II) exhibited fairly high binding affinity towards \u00b5-opioid receptor (Ki\u00b5 = 7.6 and 27.4 nM, respectively).

However deamino analogues of OT are also very active and their binding is also influenced by divalent cations. We have studied OT, deaminooxytocin (dOT) and an OT antagonist (Antag) by means of electrospray MS and we have observed that all these compounds form molecular adducts with Zn2+, Mg2+, Mn2+ and Ca2+. In binding experiments using 125-I Antag, the quantity of tracer bound to membranes of HEK cells having stable expressed human OT receptor strongly depends on the character and concentration of divalent ions. Displacement curves using unlabelled Antag do not change in the absence or presence of 10 mM of tested divalent ions. On the other hand, displacement curves using unlabelled OT and dOT are shifted to the left in the presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+, and to much lesser extent by Zn2+ and Ca2+.

The binding of a pY-ligand to the N-SH2 domain is required for an efficient activation of SHP-1 phosphatase activity. The specificity of the SHP-1 SH2 domains is determined by the pY-residue (position 0) and residues at positions -2, +1 and +3. Combinatorial peptide library methods revealed different classes of consensus sequences for both SH2 domains [1, 2] . In addition, the importance of residues C-terminal to pY+3 (+4 to +6), in particular for binding to the N-SH2 domain, has been demonstrated [3] . Together with investigations of the determinants for optimal SH2 domain binding and stimulation/inhibition of SHP-1 activity [4] , these informations were useful for the generation of different strategies for effectors of SHP-1 activity. Peptides cyclized between different positions of the general consensus pY-2 to pY+3 were synthesized and evaluated with respect to N-SH2 domain binding and stimulation of phosphatase activity. ",

In a previous study [1] , the antiaggregatory activity of RGD peptide analogues, i.e. their ability to act as fibrinogen receptor \u03b1IIb\u03b23 antagonists, was correlated with the above structural criteria. Our results suggested that the fulfillment of the criterion -45\u03bf < pdo < +45\u03bf is a prerequisite for an analogue to exhibit activity. In the present study, we examine the above criteria to RGD-containing 15peptides, derived from the active sites of the ECM proteins fibrinogen, fibronectin and vitronectin, as well as, from the cryptic RGD site of von Willebrand factor. The correlation of the structural data with the biological activity of compounds, are in good agreement with the previously mentioned -45\u03bf < pdo < +45\u03bf criterion. Furthermore, our results show that the differences in activity of compounds, which display similar distances between the charged centers of Arg and Asp, can be better evaluated by the pdo structural criterion.

Fibrinogen binding on GPIIb/IIIa is an event essential for platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Mapping of the fibrinogen binding domains on GPIIb subunit suggested the sequence 313-332 as a putative binding site [1] . This region was restricted to sequence GPIIb 313-320 (YMESRADR) using synthetic octapeptides overlapping by six residues [2] . The YMESRADR octapeptide inhibits ADP stimulated human platelets aggregation and binds to immobilized fibrinogen. In this study we present the conformational analysis of three synthetic analogues YAESRADR (A2) YMESAADR (A5), and YMESRAAR (A7), using NMR spectroscopy and distance geometry calculations. Common structural characteristic of peptides A2 and A7 is the interaction between the side chains of Arg5 and Glu3, however in A2 the guanidino group of Arg5 seems to form salt bridges with both Glu3 and Asp7. Peptide A5 is stabilized only by a week interaction between Arg8 and Glu3 side chains. The interactions between the residue side chains provoke different overall shape of the three molecules. The most populated structural family of A2 exhibits a \u03c0 backbone shape, A5 a turn around -S4A5-, while A7 an almost extended shape. ",

In this presentation, the incorporation of ethylene-bridged Phe-Phe unit (eb[Phe-Phe]) or piperidine carboxylic aid (Pic) in position 2 was carried out to obtain more potent agonist or antagonist with stability against dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV). Methods: The synthesis of eb[Phe-Phe] unit was achieved according to the procedure of Lammek B. et al. [2] Protected peptides were synthesized by a solution method using Boc-chemistry. The final products were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and elemental analyses. The receptor binding affinity of peptides was assessed by radio-ligand receptor binding assay using mu and delta opioid receptors from rat brain membranes or COS-7 cell membranes expressing each opioid receptors. MUC2 glycoprotein, produced by the epithelium of the colon, built up mainly of repeat units of 1PTTTPITTTTTVTPTPTPTGTQT23, can be underglycosylated in colon carcinoma. We have been studying the epitope structure of the MUC2 repeat unit with the mucin peptide specific MAb 996 monoclonal antibody. This antibody recognizes the 18PTGTQ22 sequence as minimal, and 16PTPTGTQ22 as optimal epitope. Our interest lies in the modification of this epitope with maintained or enhanced specificity, and we aim to clarify the effect of different epitope modifications on MAb 996 antibody binding: A) amino acid changes in the flanking region, B) glycosylation in the epitope core and in the flank. For this we have prepared A) libraries of AX(1)PTGTQAA and ATPTGTQX(2)A peptides, and X(1)PTGTQX(2) heptapeptides based on the antibody binding properties of the libraries; and B) glycopeptides PT(GalNac)PTGTQ, PTPT(GalNac)GTQ and PTPTGT(GalNac)Q. The peptides were prepared by solid phase synthesis; after purification, ESI-MS and amino acid analysis characterisation their antibody binding properties were studied by competitive ELISA. Our results show that A) although all amino acids in positions X(1) and X(2) resulted in antibody binding; in position X(1) hydrophobic, in X(2) aromatic residues provided stronger binding than that of the native peptide; B) glycosylation on Thr(17) did not influence the binding of MAb 996, but on Thr(19) the presence of N-acetyl-galactosamine, interestingly, slightly increased the antibody recognition. These findings could be useful in designing synthetic peptide vaccines for tumour therapy. ",

The eight primary metal-binding sites are the four imidazole and four ammine groups on the ligand. pHpotentiometric titrations revealed, that up to pH 8 all these donor atoms loose their protons on increasing pH. The competition between the protons and the metal ions results the decrease of pKa values to about 1-3 in the case of copper(II) and to about 4-6 in case of zinc(II) ion. This reflects the higher stability of the complexes formed with copper(II) in spite of the weak axial coordination that seems to occur in zinc(II) complexes. Combined potentiometric, spectrophotometric, CD and NMR spectroscopic methods were utilized to investigate the speciation and the structure of the complexes formed in aqueous solution. The prepared Cu(II) complexes cleaved DNA, but it is not known whether in oxidative or in hydrolytic manner. Because of this ambiguity further studies with Zn(II) complexes will be undertaken.

Further studies have shown that in both male and female gonads, INSL3 and LGR8 represent a paracrine system important for meiosis induction in the ovary and male germ cell survival in the testis. Thus INSL3 may have clinical applications in fertility management. We undertook to determine the key structural elements responsible for its unique actions. Methods: Alanine-scanned analogues of human INSL3 and mimetics of the B-chain alone were prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis. Each was subjected to CD spectroscopy for secondary structure analysis and assayed for in vitro LGR8 binding and activation activity.

In conclusion, we developed selective, Cbp-containing \u03b4 antagonists and \u00b5 agonists with significant potency. Recently, we described the syntheses and biological activities of several opioid peptide analogues that contained the N-terminal sequence 1-4, common to dermorphin and deltorphin. Some of them showed very high agonist potency both in the GPI assay and in the MVD assay [1, 2] . In this work, we designed new analogues in which the sequences were elongated at the C-terminal to obtained the full sequences of dermorphin (A) and deltorphin (B). The syntheses of compounds and their biological activity profiles will be discussed. ",

The biological activity of insulin is known to be closely related to the C-terminal octapeptide fragment of its B-chain.It was found that B23 gly and B24 phe were present in all insulins so far obtained from various animal species indicating the significance of these two residues.It would therefore seem desirable to study the effect of each of these two amino acid residues or both on biological activity of the octapeptide fragment of the B-chain. A heptapeptide Arg-Phe-Tyr-Thr-Pro-Lys-Ala-OCH3, corresponding to (B22-B30) insulin des Gly23-Phe24, and an octapeptide Arg-Phe-Phe-Tyr-Thr-Pro-Lys-Ala-OCH3, des Gly23 were synthesized using the solid phase method. The C-terminal ends of both peptide were converted to methyl ester by transesterification cleavage from the resin. The side chain protecting groups were removed by HF. Manual counter current distribution method was used for purification of the free peptides. The way to solve the evaluation of tyrosine containing peptide was studied. The free methyl ester peptides were administered for insulin-like activity test by glucose metabolism in the rat fat cells technique in vitro. Aim of this study is to develop peptides as useful tools for degradation of synthetic dyes, which are often pollutants. We focused our interest in peroxidases, a class of enzymes reported to efficiently degrade azo and anthraquinonic dyes. In particular, the fungus Versatile Peroxidase (VP) of Pleurotus Eryngii can perform this degradation. Therefore, our goal is the synthesis of a peptide based on this peroxidase able to emulate its biological function. The linear and cyclic peptide sequences were derived by the theoretical model of VP [PDB: 1A20], which determined the amino acids fundamental for the desired function of the active sites. In particular, the residues instrumental for the coordination of the heme, the Mn binding site, and the Long Range Electron Transfer pathway [1] , were pin-pointed. Moreover, we calculated the radius of the heme cavity. The next step was the synthesis of these peptides in order to verify the coordination of the heme and optimize their sequences. The syntheses were carried out by solid-phase following the Fmoc/tBu strategy. Because of purification difficulties of the fully-protected peptide, we undertook an alternative synthetic pathway, based on a solid phase head-to-tail cyclisation strategy, following the Fmoc/tBu/allyl three-dimensional protection scheme [2] . Next steps will be to test the coordination properties of the synthetic peptides, with respect to the heme, and further computational studies based on the new model of Pleurotus The calcium plays an important role in biochemical pathways. It binds to enzymes and proteins in a different process. Aspartic (Asp, D) and glutamic (Glu, E) acid side chains are the main ligands of calcium, but the contribution of the backbone carbonyl groups in the binding is also important. Generally the binding places in the proteins are an unstructured loop between two helixes (310-or alpha-helix). The common sequence is the so-called EF-hand motif, which contains 12 amino acids [1] . It is already known that some proteins also bind calcium with a non-EF-hand loop. For example alpha-lactalbumins have a ten amino acid long sequence for binding [2] . It is an Asp rich sequence where 5 Asps are closer to each other than in EF-hand motif (-K79FLDDDLTDD88-) but only 3 Asps side chains take part in calcium coordination. We constructed a series of cyclopeptides to mimic the loop structure of alpha-lactalbumin [3] . In this study we focus on determining the importance of conservative amino acids within the Ca2+ binding loop of this protein, using microcalorimetry (ITC). The ITC measurements were performed in different organic solvents and at different temperature. ",

The helical conformation of GIP is further supported by CD spectroscopic studies. Six GIP(1-42)Ala1-7 analogues were synthesised by replacing individual N-terminal residues with alanine. Alanine scan studies of these N-terminal residues showed that the GIP(1-42)Ala6 was the only analogue to show insulin secreting activity similar to that of the native GIP. However, when compared with glucose its insulinotropic ability was reduced. For the first time, these NMR and modelling results contribute to the understanding of the structural requirements for the biological activity of GIP.

Efrapeptin C is a competitive inhibitor of the F1-ATPase and active against the malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. An anti-proliferative effect was also reported. Conformational analysis of efrapeptin C in trifluoroethanol and dimethylsulfoxide was conducted to obtain structure-affinity relationships. The absence of amide-and -protons resulted in an imperfect assignment and unsatisfying conformational study. Specific deuteration of methyl groups in Aib did not simplify the assignment. CD and FT/IR spectra hint to helical or beta-turn secondary structures as main structure elements. Residual dipolar couplings (RDC) were measured in a stretched cross-linked poly(dimethylsiloxane) gel in dichloromethane. The impact of the RDC on the conformational analysis led to an improved high resolution structure from simulated annealing protocols and consolidated the formation of a helical structure of efrapeptin C in nonpolar solution which is comparable with the binding pocket of the F1-ATPase. Finally, the dynamics of the resulting structures was studied using the GROMOS96 force field in explicit solvent.

Altough the inhibition is the proximal event in antidepressant action, the clinical benefit of antidepressant medications requires weeks of continuous dosing, indicating that their mechanism of action involves events downstream from acute transporter blockade. Long-term effects of SSRI treatment may be due to changes in intrinsic properties of SERT structure, function, or regulation. Thus, understanding the mechanism of action of SERT remains a primary goal in the search for developing novel treatments for diseases associated with serotonergic dysfunction.",

The model of serotonin transporter based on the crystal structure of bacterial homologue from Aquifex aeolicus (LeuTAa) was constructed using the traditional homology modelling approach. A series of docking experiments with SSRI's were conducted, using interactive molecular graphics techniques combined with energy calculations and analysis of the transporter-ligand complexes. Structural information about the serotonin transporter and its molecular interactions with SSRI's is important for understanding the mechanism of action of these drugs and for development of drugs with improved potency and selectivity. The protein kinase C (PrkC) is a member of a super-family of the eukaryotic receptor protein kinases. It forms dimers and is anchored in the membrane, with a cytoplasmic kinase domain and an external domain, presumably acting as a sensor. PrkC enables formation of biofilms of Bacillus subtilis which show a high degree of spatial organization. They colonize various surfaces and produce complex antibiotic resistant communities. PrkC acts as a Ser/Thr kinase with features of the receptor kinase family of eukaryotic Hanks kinases. Our current study involved theoretical modeling of the protein kinaze PrkC complexes with the modified ATP. The ligands were selected from a set of molecular probes developed by K. Shah and coworkers [1] . Each modified ATP molecule was docked to the active site of the kinase molecule using Autodock genetic algorithm procedure. The optimized structures of the complexes were submitted to the molecular dynamics simulations in the Amber force field. We obtained four optimized structures of PrkCc complexes in water. The results suggest the great similarity of our complexes with human cyclin-dependent kinase 2 [1] complexes. ",

N-Methyl-(Z)-dehydrophenylalanine was found in tentoxin, a selective weed killer, having been produced by several phytopathogenic fungi of the Alternaria genus. N-Methyl-(Z/E)-dehydrobutyrine and N-methyldehydroalanine are components of nodularins and microcystins, families of hepatoxins produced by species of freshwater cyanobacteria, primarily Nodularia spumingena and Microcystis aeruginosa. The simplest N-methyl dehydropeptides, Ac-delta(Me)Xaa-NHMe (where Xaa = Ala, (Z/E)-Abu, (Z/E)-Phe, and Val) and, for comparison, the saturated Ac-L-(Me)Ala-NHMe analogue were investigated using computational methods. Cis-trans B3LYP/6-31+G**//HF/3-21G Ramachandran potential energy surfaces were created. The conformers found were optimised at the B3LYP/6-31+G** level. The effect of the electrostatic solute/solvent (water) interaction on the solute energies was investigated within the SCRF method using the polarisable continuum model (PCM) on the geometries of solutes in vacuo. It was found that for all the studied dehydropeptide molecules the lowest conformer (phi, psi = ~ -109\u00b0, 10\u00b0) has the cis N-methyl amide bond. This feature seems to be independent of the dehydroamino acid moieties, the C-beta substituent and the Z/E configuration. The pi-electron conjugation as well as the N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bond play the dominant role in the stability of this conformer (see Figure) . The preliminary NMR investigations into the conformational preferences of the studied molecules in solution confirm the theoretical results obtained. The strong tendency of the N-methyl amide bond to adopt the cis configuration seems to be the reason why N-methyldehydroamino acids are found in small natural cyclic peptides, where they ensure the conformational flexibility necessary for biological action. The purpose of this study was to determine the potentials of mean force (PMF) of the interactions between models of nonpolar amino acid side chains in water. The potentials of mean force (PMF's) dependent on orientation were determined for systems forming hydrophobic and diagonal complexes composed of side-chain models of alanine, valine, leucine, proline and iso-leucine, respectively, in water. For each hydrophobic pair in water a series of umbrellasampling molecular dynamics simulations with the AMBER force field and explicit solvent (TIP3P water model) were carried out and the PMFs were calculated by using the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM). In all cases a characteristic shape of PMF plots for hydrophobic association were found, which was manifested as the presence of contact minima and solvent separated minima. Depths of contact minima for all systems studied were about 1 kcal/mol. In this work we compared the ability of two theoretical methods of pH-dependent conformational calculations to reproduce experimental potentiometric-titration curves of two models of peptides: Ac-K5-NHMe in 95% methanol (MeOH)/5% water (H2O) mixture and Ac-XX(A)7OO-NH2 (XAO) (where X is diaminobutyric acid, A is alanine, and O is ornithine) in water, methanol (MeOH) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), respectively. In theory, in all three solvents, the first pKa of XAO is strongly downshifted compared to the value for the reference compounds, the water and methanol curves have one, and the DMSO curve has two jumps characteristic of remarkable differences in the dissociation constants of acidic groups. The predicted titration curves of Ac-K5-NHMe are in good agreement with the experimental ones; better agreement is achieved with the MD-based method. The titration curves of XAO in methanol and DMSO, calculated using the MD-based approach, trace the shape of the experimental curves, reproducing the pH jump, while those calculated with the EDMC-based approach, and the titration curve in water calculated using the MD-based approach, have smooth shapes characteristic of the titration of weak multifunctional acids with small differences between the dissociation constants. Quantitative agreement between theoretically predicted and experimental titration curves is not achieved in all three solvents. The poorer agreement obtained for water than for the nonaqueous solvents suggests a significant role of specific solvation in water, which cannot be accounted for by the mean-field solvation models M337",

Among the former category of ACE peptide substrates, the most distinguished are those involved in blood pressure regulation, such as angiotensin I (AngI) and bradykinin (BK). In the latter category falls the Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) In an attempt to analyze molecular interactions at atomic level we simulated the ACE-substrate complexes, using the recently determined 3D crystal structure of ACE testis isoform and a knowledge-based docking method in order to insert the peptide substrate (AngI, BK and GnRH) of ACE into its catalytic cleft. In order to introduce the effect of protein mobility and gain information about enzyme-substrate recognition and interaction we have sampled the conformational space of these complexes via molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent representation. We have also performed molecular dynamics calculations with tACE-inhibitor complexes, such as lisinopril, as well as with tACE mutated at specific sites, such as the ligands of the two buried chloride ions that have been shown to affect substrate activity. Our results provide new insights into the role of specific domains of tACE and their implication in the enzyme activity, which is not readily apparent from the available crystal structures. Two main mechanisms for the propagation of action potential in myocytes are: 1) the free flow of local circuit current through gap junctions and 2) the effect of electrical field. Here we study effect of each mechanism and their importance during action potential propagation. Method: We simulated the cardiac myocyte by the Orcad software, then used the model of sinoatrial node to stimulate the myocytes model and studied the propagation of action potential with and without gap junction. Result: Our results show that, although gap junction solely is not able to mimic physiological condition, but it is necessary for normal cardiac functioning. On the other hand, electric field is not sufficient for successful propagation of action potential and the existence of gap junction is necessary. ",

By applying docking simulations to Anthrax Zn-metalloprotease around 1.000 peptide substrates were virtually screened according to their binding affinity. Data suggest that complexes of ALF with peptides substrates bearing Arg, Trp, Lys and Phe aminoacids, exhibit the highest binding affinity providing evidence for electrostatic interactions between negatively charged residues of ALF's active site and positively charged side-chains of di/tri-peptides. New libraries of substrates were built incorporating non-protein residues, organic moieties and chelating groups.

However, their common basic structures and universal features to induce amyloid fibril formations are not known in detail. Previously, we examined intermolecular interactions among the several amino acid residues in barnase, which is known to form amyloid-like fibril. Based on the experimental results using a series of mutant barnase, we discovered that the interactions between hydrophobic side-chains are the most essential driving force to form the fibrils and that both intermolecular and inter-sheet interactions in the fibril maintain highly ordered molecular packing. In the present paper, we describe a novel prediction method for core regions of various fibril-forming proteins and show the verification of the above possible structural principle. At first, we calculated the interaction's score between side-chains in the antiparallel orientation of beta-strands. Next, the peptides with predicted sequences of fibril cores, a couple of high-scored regions with a designed turn moiety to induce a hairpin-like form, were chemically synthesized by SPPS. As a result, the formation of amyloid fibrils was confirmed for most of high-scored sequences. In addition, we also applied this method to prion protein, we could predict 4 possible beta-strands with hetero-paired orientation. Some synthetic peptides involving these strands were proved to have fibril-forming ability. Thus, we have developed the novel method to predict the core regions that induce amyloid fibrils.",

The suppression of p53 levels is being indirectly regulated by the protein itself, which activates the expression of a gene, the oncogene mdm2 (murine double minute 2), which expresses the MDM2 protein, known as human-MDM2 or just HDM2. HDMX protein is a homologue protein to HDM2 and is being implicated, through various biological processes, in the suppression of p53. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that HDM2 and HDMX proteins are not the only ubiquitin ligases that negatively regulate p53 through ubiquitin pathway. Two recently discovered E3 ligases, COP1 and Pirh2, are also proposed to promote p53 for degradation. All these proteins function as E3 ligases bearing a Ring finger domain. These domains are characterized by their high content in cysteines and the binding of two Zn(II) ions while they catalyze the latter stage of protein signaling for proteolysis by the 26S proteasome, through the ubiquitin pathway. The structure variation and the stability of these Ring fingers is studied through molecular dynamics simulations of 2-5 ns and structure variations are analyzed in a Structure-Function correlation basis.",

During this process, one of the hCC \u03b2-hairpins (\u03b22-L1-\u03b23) changes its conformation forming long \u03b2-strand. This conformational transition destabilizes the monomer structure and leads to domain-swapped dimer. The causative force for changing the \u03b2hairpin conformation is assumed to be the alleviation of distortions of the L1-loop Val57 amino acid residue's backbone. Following the above assumption and our previous conformational studies of the hCC \u03b2-hairpin peptide we investigated the influence of the point mutations, V57D, V57P and V57N of the Val57 residue, on the \u03b2-hairpin peptide structure. The conformational studies by means of CD spectroscopy and molecular dynamics studies were performed. The study revealed that the hCC peptide with the wild-type sequence has the strongest tendency from all studied peptides to form a \u03b2-hairpin structure. On the basis of these results we conclude that the presence of distortions in the Val residue of L1-loop is unlikely to cause the 3D domain swapping of the human cystatin C.

Temporin A (TA) (FLPLIGRVLSGIL-NH2) and Temporin L (TL) (FVQWFSKFLGRIL-NH2 ) are small, basic, hydrophobic, linear antimicrobial peptides amide found in the skin of the European red frog, Rana temporaria. These peptides have variable antibiotic activities against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including clinically important methicillin-sensitive and resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains. To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of these small antimicrobial peptides, we have investigated their conformational behaviour in different environmental conditions. More specifically, we deeply investigated by solution NMR spectroscopy in water and water/DMSO (8:2) solutions as isotropic solutions and 200 mM aqueous solution of DPC (dodecylphosphocholine) was used as membrane mimetic environment. Understanding the basis of the interactions of temporins with membranes could be crucial for the design and synthesis of potent antimicrobial agents. Cripto is the founding member of a family of soluble and cell bound growth factors known as EGF-CFC [1] distinguished by the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide, two distinct cysteine-rich domains (CRD) and a C-terminal hydrophobic region involved in cell surface attachment by a post-translational GPI modification. The characteristic CRDs, known as EGF-like and CFC domains (from the first members Cripto, FRL1 and Cryptic), both span about 40 residues with 3 disulfide bridges [2] each, which, presumably, beside a possible functional modularity, confer them also a structural independence.",

Anyway, structure activity relationship data underline that preservation of the Trp30-Met31 motif is essential, and that the Phe33 side chain and a carboxylic group close to the C-terminal end must both be present. The NMR conformational study in DPC micelles of the compound endowed with maximal binding affinity (cyclo-B11, IC50=11 M) shows that this compound presents the turn-like conformation, centred at the Trp30-Met31 segment, as planned by rational design, and that such conformation is stabilised both by the cyclic constrain and interaction with the micelle.

Cripto is strictly required in the early embryonic development and contributes to deregulated growth of cancer cells in adults, since it is highly over-expressed in many solid carcinomas. It has been proposed that each single domain of Cripto could bind different protein partners, playing different functional roles [2] . On this grounds, investigation of the single domains 3D-structures can have also strong functional implications. We present here an extensive conformational analysis of the mouse CFC domain (96-134 sequence) and of the W107A mutant based on NMR data.

Furthermore, the secondary structures of the synthetic receptor fragments in presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles and interaction with UT ligands were analysed using NMR spectroscopy. SPR data showed that the EC loop II was able to recognize the ligands U-II, URP and Urantide with similar affinities while none of these two ligands were able to interact with the extracellular loop I. Furthermore, the absence of binding of Urantide, a peptide antagonist, suggested strongly that loop III would be involved in the signal transduction process and implies that U-II and URP, but not Urantide, would bind to UT according to a common pattern. Moreover, the results indicate that potent UT antagonists could be designed by producing highaffinity ligand targeting the extracellular loop II. Also, the SPR and NMR studies revealed that the synthetic structural UT domains contained some of the conformational and chemical features essential for the binding of hU-II, URP and Urantide to hUT. Synthetic cysteine-rich replicates of naturally occurring peptides such as hormones, neurotransmitters, enzyme inhibitors, defensins and toxins often can be oxidatively folded in high yields to their native structure.

These results complement published findings on the diverging relative stabilities of the intermolecularly H-bonded \u03b2-sheet structures generated by Ile versus allo-Ile homo-oligopeptides. Taken together, these data represent an experimental proof for the intuitive view that potentially different conformational properties are magnified in a strongly self-aggregated homo-peptide system (as compared to weakly self-aggregated, helical, host-guest peptides such as those investigated in this work). In a first approach to \u03b2-sandwich proteins the hydrophobic core between two symmetrical sheets each with four antiparallel \u03b2-strands was computationally designed by packing of amino acid side chain conformations (rotamers) in an initially given backbone structure. The proteins were synthesized by coupling four peptides with \u03b2-hairpin structure to a cyclic decapeptide template (TASP). An aggregation observed by equilibrium ultracentrifugation with the first designed proteins was decreased to a dimer by increasing the surface charge in two further variants of this protein from -1 to +3 and +5. Replacement of L-Pro by D-Pro in the loops and the template proved to stabilize the \u03b2-structure. These results led us to an improved design of an asymmetric core with algorithms for selection of proteins with a minimal number of atom clashes and cavities in the core, and a maximum number of hydrogen bonds after energy minimization. This protein termed beta-MOP (Modular Organized Protein) was synthesized in amounts to allow a characterization by CD, FTIR, tryptophan fluorescence during reversible unfolding, and by high resolution NMR. NMR measurements of diffusion indicate a dimeric structure. The \u03b2-structure is stable up to 80 \u00b0C (353 K) as determined by 1D 1H NMR showing sharp resonance lines. The 2D 1H,1H DQF-COSY spectrum at 750 MHz shows a typical \u03b2sheet distribution extending well into the characteristic regions >8.5 ppm (for amide protons) and >5.0 ppm (for H\u03b1 signals). All data indicate a well folded protein with \u03b2-structure.",

The hydrazino-peptides in question were synthetized on solid support, and their structures were characterized by NMR and CD methods. The results were found to be in good accordance with the 8-strand structure. Cathepsin C [EC 3.4.14.1](1), which belongs to family of cysteine proteases, catalyzes hydrolysis of N-terminal peptide, preferential GlyPhe. This enzyme may play a part in chronic airway diseases (2) . Also increaser level of enzyme was found in case of cancer, rheumatism and muscle's distrophy (3) (4) (5) . For this reason we have undertook investigations of peptides containing two dehydroamino acid residues, which could act as alkylating inhibitors of this enzyme. To define structure and conformation of investigated peptides we were used different methods of NMR spectroscopy, including standard 1D experiments, protonproton correlations, proton-carbon correlations, and 2D NOE experiments. To complete structural research computational chemistry methods had been used. In order to predict the biological activity of investigated peptides, the simulation of docking process of these peptides to enzyme active site had been made and after that correlated with results of enzymatic test.. The obtained results suggest, that investigated peptides containing two \u2206Phe residues (Z and E isomers respectively) in solution have bent conformation, which is stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonds. These results are confirmed by the results of theoretical calculations. Also simulation of docking process have showed two possible peptide's orientation in active site of cathepsin C and allowed the rational interpretation of biological test's results. Turns are important elements of secondary structure in peptides and proteins. Different types of turns are distinguished according to the number of residues involved. The most abundant is the \u03b2-turn, which involves four consecutive amino acids with the CO at position i hydrogen-bonded to the i+3 NH. The \u03b3-turn is centred at a single residue and is generally stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the i CO and the i+2 NH. Model dipeptides RCO-L-Pro-Xaa-NHR' are the smallest systems able to adopt the \u03b2-turn conformation, which is favoured by the presence of proline at i+1. A peptide of this series, incorporating a cyclopropane amino acid (Xaa), has been shown to accommodate two consecutive \u03b3-turns in the solid state [1] , instead of the expected \u03b2-turn conformation. The double \u03b3-turn encountered is unique among crystalline short linear peptides. In fact, the \u03b3-turn is observed almost exclusively in low-polarity solvents, and only a few oligopeptides of cyclic structure exhibit a \u03b3-turn in the crystal. This is the first time that the strong tendency of Pro-Xaa dipeptides to adopt a \u03b2-turn in the solid state has been switched to the \u03b3-turn.",

There are two common alleles for haptoglobin (1 and 2), and the three phenotypes, haptoglobin 1-1, haptoglobin 2-1, and haptoglobin 2-2, differ in their ability to function as antioxidants. We determined whether there was a relation between the haptoglobin phenotype and the development of Coronary Artery Diseases.

We performed haptoglobin (Hp) genotyping by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using allele-specific primer-pairs. In multivariate analyses controlling for conventional CVD risk factors, haptoglobin phenotype was a highly statistically significant, independent predictor of CVD. The odds ratio of having CVD in patients with the haptoglobin 2-2 phenotype was 5.0 times greater than in patients with the haptoglobin 1-1 phenotype. An intermediate risk of CVD was associated with the haptoglobin 2-1 phenotype. These results suggest that haptoglobin phenotype is an important risk factor in determining susceptibility to cardiovascular disease which may be mediated by the decreased antioxidant and antiinflammatory actions of the haptoglobin 2 allelic protein product.

Our recent studies on this A\u03b2 fragment using the CD method and the aggregation test have proved it a good model for structural studies. The obtained results confirmed that the aggregation process follows the scheme with an \u03b1-helical intermediate and pointed out differences in the behaviour of A\u03b2 variants. To further confirm the scheme of the structural changes accompanying aggregation we have applied FTIR spectroscopy and analysed aggregation-induced changes of the amide I band which is directly related to peptide backbone conformations. The FTIR spectra analysis indicate that water addition provoked conformational changes are strongly dependent on the A\u03b2(11-28) variant and in some cases the formation of \u03b1-helical intermediate seems to be preceded by 310 helix formation. To verify this hypothesis the temperature dependent ATR FTIR spectra will be analysed. Supported by UG BW grant. Amino acid octarepeats present in the prion protein bind to Cu2+ and are considered as a potential periplasmic copper ion transporters. This octarepeat is located in the unstructured region of the prion protein, which is supposedly not intricately involved in prion aggregation. Our group is involved in exploring the function of octarepeats with a special emphasis on their possible role in amyloid fibril formation and aggregation.1 In this context, we have prepared truncated peptide constructs derived from the prion protein octarepeat PHGGGWGQ and have reported their fibrillation activity. We will present aggregative behavior of a truncated bis-pentapeptide, containing GGGWG segment, when tethered with a flexible linker diaminobutane. Fibrillar architectures were observed by this bis conjugate after incubation in water which was probed by different microscopic and steady state fluorescence techniques. Further investigations with KI revealed a homogeneous environment of the two tryptophan moieties in the conjugate. In the absence of other side-chains, it is likely that fibril formation involves hydrophobic interaction between tryptophan indole moieties and main chain backbone interactions. Interestingly, a facilitator role for aromatic-glycine motifs for amyloid aggregation has been proposed based on bioinformatics search of the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases. Collagens are known to fold into a highly ordered rode-shaped triple helix with stretches of lower and higher suprastructural stability and even disruptions to modulate recognition by other proteins that interact with the extracellular matrix [1] . To increase understanding of folding and stability of the collagen triple helix, we have adressed the design of photocontrolled collagenous peptides. Our aim was to crosslink two side chains of the repetitive (Xaa-Yaa-Gly) sequence motifs of collagen model compounds via an azobenzene chromophore in analogy to our previous studies on photomodulation of the conformational preferences of cyclic peptides and more recently of hairpin-peptide model systems [2] . Molecular modeling experiments suggested appropriate sequence positions that could result in triple-helical peptides with conformational stabilities that can be modulated by cis/trans isomerization of the azobenzene moieties. As light switchable crosslinker azobenzene-4,4'-N-(4-iodo-2-butynenyl)carboxyamide was synthesized for reaction with two (4S)-mercaptoproline residues placed in suitable Xaa and Yaa positions, respectively. By this approach a fully folded triple helix was obtained upon thermal relaxation, and unfolding was induced by irradiation at 350 nm. The favorable optical properties of the azobenzene derivative together with the regular suprastructure resulted in a valuable model system that allows for ultrafast time-resolved studies of collagen folding and unfolding.

After protein misfolding short peptide sequences act as \"hot spots\" providing the driving force for protein aggregation in amyloid fibrils. We have identified one of these sequence stretches in the Abl-SH3 domain of Drosophila (DLSFMKGE) whereas the human homologous region (DLSFKKGE) is predicted to be less amyloidogenic. The possible reason for the difference of amyloid formation propensities of the two peptides was investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) of \u03b2-sheet structures. The antiparallel alanine \u03b2-sheets consisting of two and ten strands were constructed, minimized, and mutated to the sequences DLSFMKGE and DLSFKKGE. All four systems: 1) DLSFMKGE -two strands, 2) DLSFKKGE -two strands, 3) DLSFMKGE -ten strands, 4) DLSFKKGE -ten strands, were surrounded by 10 \u00c5 layer of water molecules over the solute and subjected to MD, Amber 8.0 force field, NTP protocol. The MD runs were started at the temperature of 10 K and the temperature was elevated stepwise by 10 degrees till 300 K. The results show considerably higher hydrogen bond percentage for DLSFMKGE than that one for DLSFKKGE during the course of the simulation, thus suggesting that DLSFMKGE is a potential fibril-maker, but DLSFKKGE is not. Two strand \u03b2-sheet systems were stable until 170 K. The ten strand \u03b2-sheets are more stable. ",

There are two isoforms of ACE. The somatic isoform is present in all human cells except the testis cells, where the testicular isoform is produced. The major difference between these two types is that, the somatic form has two active sites, at the N-and C-end respectively while the testicular has only one, which is almost identical to the somatic C-terminal active site. Here we report the structural study of a 108aa peptide (previously expressed in bacteria), which corresponds to an extended domain of the human somatic N-terminal active site of ACE (Ala361-Gly468) by circular dichroism experiments, and the overexpression in bacteria, purification and structural study, using circular dichroism techniques, of a 108aa peptide which corresponds to an extended domain of the human somatic C-terminal active site of ACE (Ala958-Gly1065). Following the subclonning into an appropriate expression vector and the expression, the peptide was isolated from the inclusion bodies using chromatography techniques. The recombinant protein fragment had a molecular weight, measured by ESI-MS, of 12102 kDa which was in consistence with the theoretical calculation based on the DNA sequence. The recombinant peptides acquired their theoretically calculated secondary structure only when 1,1,1-trifluoroethanol is present at a concentration of ~70%.

Peptides and proteins that are involved in aggregation processes contain potential metal binding sites. The concentration of metal ions in the brain tissue is naturally high and Zn in the mM range has been found in AD amyloid plaques. Thus, it is widely accepted that metal complexation is one of the key incidents that lead to conformational transitions and aggregation. We present here a coiled coil based model peptide system with an intrinsic amyloid forming tendency which can be used to study the impact of different metal ions on secondary structure and aggregation. Metal complexing Histidine residues were incorporated to create potential binding sites which, depending on their position and the nature of the metal ion, dictate folding and aggregation. The time dependent conformational transition was monitored by CD-spectroscopy. Aggregates were characterized by cryo TEM. High resolution FTICR-MS experiments revealed information on the stoichiometry of the peptide-metal complexes. In the absence of metal ions the presented peptides formed amyloids in a time range of weeks. Depending on the His positions and milieu conditions, the nature of the metal ion determines folding and aggregate morphology. Furthermore, metal binding was shown to inhibit the amyloid formation.

Insights gained from the analysis of the synthesized structure with FTIR and CD spectrometry should help us to refine the parameters for subsequent designs. With this strategy, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of protein folding. The immunoglobulin binding protein G (1IGD) from Streptococcus species consists of 61 amino acids residues, which form two antiparalell-packed beta-hairpins and an alpha-helix in the middle of the sequence packed to the beta-sheet. The second hairpin was found to be stable in isolation. This fragment is therefore likely to be the first folding initiation site of the protein which could provide an adequate nucleation center on which the rest of the polypeptide chain would find a favorable environment to fold. Thus, among the two beta-hairpins, the 48-59 fragment of 1IGD corresponding to the C-terminal beta-hairpin was synthesized. In our studies, we investigated different environmental and temperature conditions for formation of the 48-59 beta-hairpin structure. Its structure was examined by means of CD spectroscopy in water, buffer solutions (pH = 3 to 9) and in aqueous solutions of trifluoroethanol. Additionally, its structure was investigated in the solid state by FTIR spectroscopy. The CD studies revealed that the 48-59 fragment of 1IGD in water forms mainly a statistical-coil structure, whereas the FTIR technique shows formation of a regular beta-sheet structure. NMR spectroscopy and calorimetric measurements were carried out at various temperatures. Our studies show that the 48-59 fragment at low temperature exists in an equilibrium between two conformations -a regular beta-hairpin and a statistical-coil. Although increasing temperature resulted in shifting the equilibrium in the direction of the statistical-coil structure, the overall beta-hairpin shape of the 48-59 fragment was maintained. Prion diseases are characterized by the conversion of the physiological cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC) into an insoluble, protease-resistant abnormal scrapie form (PrPSc) with an highly beta-sheet content [1] . The analyses of intrinsic structural propensities of the PrP C-terminal domain showed an high conformational flexibility for the \u03b1helix 2 fragment which indicates that this region may be particularly important in the PrPC\u2192PrPSc transition [2] . Therefore conformation-based approaches focalized on helix 2 region appear to be the most promising for the study of prion protein misfolding. Recent studies on tetracycline properties showed that this molecule binds and disrupts PrP peptide aggregates and inactivates the pathogenic forms of PrP [3, 4] . A fluorometric titration of the fluoresceinated peptide corresponding to prion protein helix-2 with tetracycline has been carried out to determine the value of the apparent dissociation constant of this interaction (estimated to be 189 \u00b1 7 nM). Remarkably, the fluoresceinated peptide exhibits in water a canonical \u03b1-helical CD spectrum, that is maintained even in presence of tetracycline. Accordingly, docking calculations and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that tetracycline interacts preferentially with the C-terminal end (residues 183-195) of helix-2 with a significant involvement of the treonine rich region. In the last decades, a series of discoveries have shed light on the role played by the carbohydrate moiety in glycoproteins. It has been shown that covalently linked sugar moieties influence peptide/protein properties such as hydrophobicity, conformation, biostability and bioactivity. The design of carbohydrate-peptide analogs with increased, retained or modified biological activity requires an understanding of their conformational preferences both in solution and in the receptor-bound state.",

This inhibitor belongs to the amyloidogenic proteins shown to oligomerize through 3D domain swapping mechanism. The crystal structure of hCC reveals the way the protein refolds to produce symmetric dimer while retaining the secondary structure of the monomer. The monomeric form of hCC consists of a core with a five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet wrapped around a central \u03b1-helix. The hCC dimerization is preceded by an opening movement of L1 loop from \u03b22-L1-\u03b23 hairpin and separation of the \u03b21-helix-\u03b22 fragment from the remaining part of the molecule. The amino acid sequence of \u03b21-helix region suggests additional possible partial unfolding in the N-terminal part of helix. In order to investigate the structural stability of \u03b21-helix region the peptide corresponding to the helix and its N-terminal truncated analogs was synthesized along with the peptide analogs of helix containing point mutations that could stabilize helical structure of the N-terminus. The peptides were synthesized by the solid-phase method using Fmoc/tBu tactics. Purified products were identified by MALDI-TOF. The secondary structure content was calculated from the CD spectra using SELCON3. The random coil was the predominant structure of the peptide corresponding to the \u03b1-helical fragment of hCC and its N-truncated analogs. However, an increase of \u03b1helix content was observed in some of the peptides corresponding to the helix containing point mutations. We expect that these mutations could stabilize the hCC monomer and suppress dimerization. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a trarnscription factor that triggers cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress signals. The tetramereric structure of the p53, which is essential for its activity as a transcription factor, is formed as a dimer of dimers. While the primary dimer is constructed from inter molecular formation of a two-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet and a two anti-parallel a-helix bundle, the secondary dimer is stabilized through interactions between residues on the surface of the primary dimer. From various substitution experiments on p53, it has been shown that hydrophobicity of Phe341 is critical for the tetramer formation of p53. Also we have substituted three phenyl groups of p53 with cyclohexylalanine (Cha) and showed that Phe341Cha is dramatically stabilized against temperature, chemical denaturant, and organic solvent by CD measurements.",

In these crystals, the peptides formed tetramers which are very similar to those observed in the wild-type. The structure of the pocket where the side chain of Cha341 is incorporated was defined to elucidate the hydrophobic interaction to determine the stability. Helices shown in proteins, as a secondary structure, almost always form right-handed screw sense. This right-handedness is believed to result from the chiral center at the \u03b1position of proteinogenic L-\u03b1-amino acids. Among proteinogenic amino acids, L-isoleucine and L-threonine possess an additional chiral center at the side-chain \u03b2-carbon besides the \u03b1-carbon. However, no attention has be paid how the side-chain chiral centers affect the secondary structures of their peptides. Recently, we have reported that sidechain chiral centers of chiral cyclic \u03b1,\u03b1-disubstituted amino acid (S,S)-Ac(5)c(dOM) affected the helical secondary structure of its peptides, and the helical-screw direction could be controlled without a chiral center at the \u03b1-carbon atom. Herein, we synthesized a chiral bicyclic \u03b1,\u03b1-disubstituted amino acid (R,R)-Ab(5,6)c and its homopeptides, and studied the relationship between the chiral centers and the helical-screw handedness of peptides. Contrary to the left-handed helices of (S,S)-Ac (5) Four threefinger-toxins (TFs) have been purified from the pooled venom of golden krait (Bungarus fasciatus, i.e. Bf) from Thailand and studied previously. These peptide toxins contain 60-65 residues and 4 or 5 pairs of disulfide bonds, and are rich in \u03b2-structure. We herein analyzed the TF-isoforms in Bf venoms from Kolkata (eastern India), Hunan province (eastern China) and Indonesia to study the geographic variations and structure-function relationships of the venom polypeptide family. A total of five or six TFs of low lethality were purified from each of the geographic venom samples, the N-terminal sequences and accurate masses of the peptides were determined. The cDNAs encoding some of these TFs were also cloned and sequenced. Full peptide sequences were deduced and match with those of the TFs purified from crude venom. Intra-species variations of the venom TFs were found to be surprisingly high since sequence-identities between the majorities of orthologous toxins in different geographic samples are only 75-80 %. Most of the Bf proteins were not neurotoxic by electrophysiological assays using chick biventer-cervicis and mouse diaphragm neuromuscular tissues. The toxins appear to be associated with weak toxins or non-conventional snake venom TFs as analyzed by a phylogenetic tree. The reason behind their lack of neurotoxicity would be discussed.",

Inside a cell signals from activated receptors are integrated by networks of enzymatic reactions and molecular interactions, leading to a spectrum of cellular responses. In order to understand the relationship between a specific cellular stimulus and a cellular response, methods are required to detect in parallel the pattern of molecular interactions. A large number of molecular interactions is mediated by protein domains, binding to linear peptide motifs. Lysates of activated and resting cells were incubated on peptide microarrays carrying peptides corresponding to such binding motifs of signalling domains. Binding of proteins to a spot of the array was probed by immunofluorescence. Jurkat T cells were stimulated either with the phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate or with antibodies directed against cell surface receptors. Upon activation of T cells, numerous changes in the pattern of molecular interactions were detected for a total of 10 proteins and 30 peptides. These changes were caused either (i) by masking or unmasking of a binding domain which resulted in a reduced or increased binding of a protein to the microarray or (ii) by recruitment of a protein into a complex that in turn bound to the microarray. The changes were dependent on the nature of the stimulus. The human melanocortin receptor 1 (hMC1R) was constructed to contain a FLAG epitope and a hexahistidine tag at the amino-terminus as well as at the carboxyl terminus to facilitate purification. Stably transfected hMC1R in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell lines that expressed the receptor resulted in a KD value of 0.1 and 0.2 nM respectively in each case when the super potent agonist MTII was competed with [125I]NDP-\u03b1-MSH. Treatment of the tagged receptors in the HEK293 cells with agonist resulted in down-regulation which indicates that these tagged receptors retain their biological functions. The hMC1R was solubilized from cell membranes with n-dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside and purified at a Nickel chelating resin and a newly constructed affinity column. The purified hMC1R was a glycoprotein that migrated on SDS/PAGE with a molecular mass of 58 kDa. The results from Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was used to identify and characterize peptides derived from the hMC1R following in-gel digestion with chymotrypsin. The phosphorylation sites were identified on the purified human melanocortin receptor 1 with agonists (peptide vs small molecule) treatment. The discovery of antibiotics in the 1930s has been one of the most revolutionary events in the history of medicine. However, during last decades, the increase of antibiotic resistance has significantly hampered the application of antibiotics. Therefore, further scientific effort to find new antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action is of high importance. Insects are the largest and the most diverse group of living animals on earth. They have potentially been confronting high variety of microorganisms. As a result, they have evolved powerful defense system, thus representing vast source of novel potential therapeutics. We chose larvae of fleshfly Neobellieria bullata for identification and characterization of new promising molecules, peptides or proteins, which participate in immunity response against microbial infections. The hemolymph of the third-instar larvae of Neobellieria bullata was used for isolation. The larvae were injected with bacterial suspension of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus to induce antimicrobial response. The hemolymph was separated into crude fractions, which were subdivided by RP-HPLC. Isolated fractions were characterized by UV-VIS spectroscopy, amino-acid analysis, mass spectroscopy, 1-D and 2-D SDS electrophoresis, capillary zone electrophoresis, ion-exchange HPLC, tryptic digests and N-terminal sequencing. We found out significant antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli, Staphylococus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa in several fractions. Using real-time PCR, we followed and compared levels of mRNA of different proteins and peptides in induced and non-induced larvae. ",

It relies on the use of a small synthetic inhibitor chemically modified to allow for its immobilisation to magnetic beads or affinity chromatography materials. Proteins will be detected together with their native interaction partners because of nondenaturing conditions. This general procedure is applied for the enrichment of metalloproteinases, especially matrix metalloproteinases, which are potential target in tumour therapy. Hydroxamic acids are known to be potent inhibitors of metalloproteinases. Marimastat is a reversible inhibitor with a good potency and shows activity towards a wide range of metalloproteinases. The synthesis of new marimastat derivatives will be reported. The parent compound is modified with a linker to allow immobilisation on a solid surface. Binding studies were performed using surface plasmon resonance. This approach is not only appropriate for the generation of metalloproteinase proteome subsets by affinity column or using magnetic beads, but also to enrich and isolate interaction partners of the target proteins.

The available MS-procedures, designed to estimate the amount of protein, are aimed at derivatization at different stages of sample preparation, and as the best result, it is only possible to achieve quality comparison of the objects involved. The HSCIE reaction allows the production of evenly deuterium labelled proteins and peptides, and their application makes it possible to create a qualitative mass spectrometry method for protein analysis. Introduction of definite amounts of these deuterium-labeled proteins into biological objects, prior to isolation, separation and trypsinolysis, will generate quantitative information concerning the composition of the proteins under study. Tritium labelled proteins produced at a temperature of 100-120oC carry the isotopic label in all the peptide fragments and completely retain their enzymatic activity. The proteins' reactivity is dependent on their three-dimensional structure. The HSCIE reaction has been shown to be used both in the production of tritium labelled proteins and in the investigation of spatial interactions in protein complexes. In addition, evenly deuterium and tritium labelled peptides can be used in studies of the kinetics and transformation paths of peptides in the organism's tissues. Immunization of mice with type II collagen (CII) from rat leads to development of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Susceptibility to CIA is associated with the major histacompatibility class II protein H-2Aq that binds the glycopeptide epitope CII260-267 (1) and presents it to helper T cells. [1] To explore the interactions in the system and to stabilize 1 towards in vivo degradation, amide bond isosteres have been introduced in its backbone.Glycopeptide 1 was virtually docked into the binding site of a comparative model of H-2Aq. Based on the hydrogen bonding network between the peptide backbone and H-2Aq, the amide bond between Ala261-Gly262 was chosen for isosteric replacement. To vary the geometric and hydrogen bonding properties, mimetics of the dipeptide were synthesized with the amide bond replaced by \u03c8[CH2NH], \u03c8[COCH2] and \u03c8[(E)-CH=CH], respectively. These were introduced in 1 using solid-phase synthesis to give glycopeptidomimetics that were biologically tested for their ability to bind to the H-2Aq protein and for recognition by T cells. ",

            "text": "shown to be a potent neuroprotective factor in various pathophysiological models. Despite its therapeutic potential in diverse neurodegenerative diseases, its short in vivo half-life limits its utility as a useful clinical agent. Moreover, the development of a peptidomimetic that reproduces the pharmacological activity of PACAP is unlikely since the pharmacophores are spreaded throughout the entire peptide chain. Therefore, the development of PACAP analogues with lower susceptibility to proteolysis represents a first step toward clinical applications. In the present study, derivatives of both PACAP27 and PACAP38 with particular chemical modifications were developed targeting specific peptidase sites of action. Results indicate that the incorporation of an acetyl or a hexanoyl group at the N-terminus and modifications at the Ser2 residue contributed to increase stability against dipeptidyl peptidase IV, the major enzyme involved in PACAP degradation. Moreover, after determination of PACAP metabolites in human plasma, the amide bond between residues 21 and 22 was substituted by a CH2NH surrogate and this derivative showed increased plasma stability. All modified peptides were tested for their ability to induce PC12 differentiation. The effects of PACAP analogs on PC12 cells are mediated through the PAC1 receptor which is the major receptor involved in the neuroprotective effects of PACAP. This study exposes interesting data concerning PACAP metabolism in isolated human plasma and demonstrates the possibility of increasing the metabolic stability of PACAP without significantly reducing its biological activity. Species of the fungal genus Trichoderma are commercially used as bioprotective agents against fungal plant diseases. More than 400 strains were collected from their natural habitats and evaluated for biocontrol properties. Seven of the most active isolates exhibiting strong biological activity towards Eutypa dieback and Esca diesease of grapevine were classified as Trichoderma brevicompactum, or shown to be closely related to that species. These strains were screened for production of peptaibiotics. The formation and synergistic action of hydrolytic enzymes and peptaibiotics were to play an important role in mycoparasitism.",

These peptides have desirable pharmacological properties to become therapeutics for neurological disorders; several conotoxins have already reached clinical development stage. Our long-term goal is to improve bioavailability, metabolic stability and pharmacokinetics of conotoxins using a variety of chemical modifications. Methods: We designed and chemically synthesized conotoxin analogs containing two distinct types of backbone modifications: (1) peptide-peptoid chimeras (conopeptoids) of alpha-conotoxin ImI and (2) peptide chimeras of mu-conotoxin KIIIA containing non-peptidic \"backbone spacers\". Results: Conopeptoid-ImI, containing Ala9 replaced by N-methyl glycine potently blocked activity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In mu-Conotoxin KIIIA, aminohexanoic acid or amino-3-oxapemtanoic acid were inserted to be a part of the peptide backbone. The two oxidized analogs containing \"backbone prosthesis\" differed in their hydrophibicity profile, but they both potently inhibited neuronal sodium channels. Conclusion: Our results suggest that backbone engineering may become an effective method of producing conotoxin analogs with modified bioavailability. To increase the stability and the therapeutic efficacy of peptide sequences from myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG) that act as multiple sclerosis (MS) antigens, we grafted them onto a framework of a particularly stable class of peptides, the cyclotides. They are a recently discovered family of cyclic plant peptides with superb intrinsic stability. The limitations of linear peptides as drugs due to their instability and poor bio-availability can be overcome by using the cyclotide scaffold as a framework for novel drug design.",

            "text": "Conotoxins are small, disulfide-rich peptide neurotoxins produced in the venom of marine cone snails that enable these molluscs to capture their prey. These compounds exhibit a high degree of selectivity and potency for different ion channels and their respective subtypes, making them useful tools in the investigation of the nervous system. Due to the key role of ion channels in many physiological processes, conotoxins are also excellent drug lead candidates in drug discovery, with some examples currently undergoing clinical trials and one recently approved drug (Prialt\u00ae). Like other peptide drugs, the use of conotoxins in drug development is limited by the low oral bioavailability of these compounds due to pre-systemic enzymatic degradation and poor penetration through the intestinal mucosa. Peptide analogs that mimic the native structure and incorporate rationally designed non-natural modifications in the disulfide framework or peptide backbone may exhibit increased resistance to proteolytic degradation. In biological environments, disulfide linkages are susceptible to attack by enzymes and reducing agents (such as glutathione). Therefore we carried out the synthesis of redox-stable conotoxin analogs in which intrinsic disulfide bonds were replaced by thioether linkages. In this work, wehave explored two solid-phase synthetic routes in the preparation of thioether conotoxin mimetics: the first route based on peptide assembly using a tetra-orthogonally protected lanthionine building block, and the second route based on intramolecular on-bead cyclisation between cysteine and betabromoalanine residues. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH, L-pGlu-L-His-L-Pro-NH2), a tripeptide synthesized in the hypothalamus, operates in the anterior pituitary to control levels of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and prolactin. The thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor (TRH-R) belongs to the rhodopsin/\u03b2-adrenergic receptor subfamily of seven transmembrane (TM)-spanning, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The two G-protein-coupled receptors for TRH, TRH receptor type 1 (TRH-R1) and TRH receptor type 2 (TRH-R2), have been cloned from mammals and are distributed differently in the brain and peripheral tissues. The TRH receptor subtype-1 appears to mediate the hormonal and visceral effects, whereas TRH receptor subtype-2 has been implicated in its central stimulatory actions. Identification of critical features of the TRH, separation of its multiple activities through design of selective analogues and affinity labels have been elusive and unfulfilled goals for more then 30 years. This presentation will highlight our studies on effect of the biological activity of TRH with the introduction of alkyl groups of varying sizes at the N-1 and C-2 position of the centrally placed histidine residue of TRH peptide. The requisite N--Boc-dialkyl-L-histidines as building scaffolds have been synthesized in six steps from L-histidine methyl ester dihydrochloride and used for the synthesis of various TRH analogues. Ghrelin, the natural ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR-1a), has received a great deal of attention due to its ability to stimulate growth hormone secretion and to control food intake. During these last years, ghrelin analogues or mimetics gained interest for their implication in food intake regulation. In the course of our studies concerning ghrelin analogs, we developed new ligands of the GHSR-1a based on heterocyclic structures. Interestingly, one heterocyclic family presented high affinity for the ghrelin receptor. A structure activity study was performed within this family and led to potent GHSR-1a agonists and antagonists. The binding affinities were determined by displacement of radiolabelled ghrelin and the agonist or antagonist character was measured by intracellular calcium mobilisation. The first in vivo results revealed that in vitro activities and in vivo responses were not correlated. Particularly, binding to GHSR-1a and in vivo GH release and food intake control were not fully correlated. These results strongly suggest the presence of receptor subtypes that modulate ghrelin actions. Some examples will be reported. Further investigations are going on in the laboratory. Background and aims: Alzheimer's disease (AD) related beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides possess high propensity towards aggregation. Nowadays one of the major directions of the drug-design against AD is the synthesis of putative amyloid aggregation inhibitor molecules (AAI) which are able to hinder the formation of these toxic amyloid aggregates. In the present work we report the design, synthesis and investigation of putative AAIs derived form the peptide sequence AIIGL identical to A\u03b2(30-34). Methods: A\u03b2(1-42) peptide and putative aggregation inhibitors were synthesized manually using Fmoc-chemistry and DCC/HOBt activation. Studies on both the A\u03b2 aggregation and the effect of the AAIs were performed with several instrumental techniques. The total amount of the aggregates was determined by Thioflavine-T binding assay, while their size distribution was characterized with dynamic light scattering (DLS). Aggregated A\u03b2 forms were visualized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The binding affinity of the AAIs to A\u03b2 fibrils was studied in saturation transfer NMR experiments, while in vitro viability assays were performed on cultured human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to monitor the neuroprotective effect of the amyloid aggregation inhibitors. Results and conclusions: 32 derivatives of A\u03b2(30-34) were synthesized and tested concerning their neuroprotective effect against A\u03b2-mediated toxicity. The most promising candidates were examined with physico-chemical methods to characterize their aggregation altering ability. The pentapeptide RIIGL-amide proved to be the most powerful neuroprotective compound, and it was also able to alter considerably the aggregation kinetics of A\u03b2(1-42) . This molecule might serve as a lead compound in the drug-design against AD in the future.",

The proline-rich group of AMPs represents an exception, as they act via a permeabilization-independent mechanism that is likely based on recognition of molecular targets/transporters. However, specific internal targets have not yet been identified for most of these AMPs. Bac7 is a Pro-rich AMP isolated from bovine neutrophils that is capable to translocate across membranes to target hypothetical intracellular proteins. In this study, we used a molecular approach to identify putative targets for Bac7 by selection of peptide-resistant mutants followed by identification of the genes responsible of this resistance. To this aim, an E. coli strain susceptible to the fully active fragment Bac7(1-35) was subjected to chemical mutagenesis and a number of peptide-resistant mutants was obtained. A pool of genomic DNA from these mutants was used to construct a plasmid library that was used to transform a susceptible strain. This approach allowed the identification of 14 different clones that provided a high level of resistance to Bac7. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of genes originating from five different regions of the E. coli chromosome. Among them, one clone contained ptrB, a gene coding for a serine peptidase broadly distributed among Gram -bacteria, which could be involved in resistance by degrading the peptide. Other resistanceconferring clones, which encode for membrane proteins that may be involved in peptide translocation across the memmbrane, are currently under investigation. Lycotoxins are peptides from the venom of the wolf spider that were predicted to have an amphipatic alpha-helical structure and confirmed to possess significant antimicrobial and pore-forming activities. [1] We became interested in these peptides as potential leishmanicidal agents against Leishmania donovani promastigotes and Leishmania pifanoi amastigotes. Thus, lycotoxin I (LyI) and lycotoxin II (LyII), [1] and shortened analogues LyI1-19, LyI1-15, LyII1-21 and LyII1-17, were synthesized as C-terminal carboxamides. Short-and long-term parasite proliferation measurements showed all peptides except LyI1-5 to be active against both promastigotes and amastigotes at the micromolar range, and suggest peptide effects on parasites to be irreversible. LyII, that showed the lower activity, became more leishmanicidal upon residue trimming, whereas the most active LyI displayed the opposite behaviour. A set of complementary techniques showed that lycotoxin peptides are membrane-disruptive to promastigotes. Electron microscopy showed that two populations of promastigotes, one with intact parasites and the other extensively damaged, are formed upon addition of the peptides at their EC50. All peptides were non-hemolytic for sheep erythrocytes below 20 micromolar. Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is an enzyme that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the celiac disease. TG2 is the main autoantigen recognized by the antiendomysium antibodies and, furthermore, catalyzes the deamidation of strategic glutamine to glutamic acid within the sequence of immunodominant gliadin epitopes. Recently, another unexpected role for surface TG2, in the innate immune response in the celiac disease, has been suggested. It follows that TG2 inhibitors might represent a potential attractive pharmacological alternative to the gluten-free diet that, nowadays, is the only possible therapy for Celiac patients.",

Actually, proline residues present in the gluten epitopes are important in determining the immunogenicity of the epitopes and the specificity of TG2. Herein, we describe the preliminary conformational studies of the synthesized analogs by CD and NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling methods. The structural features of the peptides have analyzed in different environment. Given the role of the domain PQPQLPY in the gliadin proteins, structural analysis on its analogs are of considerable interest. The results of our studies might be useful to clarify the role of the proline residues in the interaction of the gluten epitopes with TG2 and, consequently, to gain new insight in the molecular mechanism of celiac disease. Carnosine and related histidine-containing dipeptides are known to react with high efficiency with the products of lipid peroxidation, namely 4-hydroxy-trans-2,3nonenal (HNE) and other alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehydes, preventing their reaction with nucleophilic residues in proteins and nucleic acids. Histidyl hydrazide alone or conjugated with aminoacids, long chain fatty acids, cholesterol and alpha-tocopherol synthesized in our laboratories demonstrated higher aldehydesequestering efficiency than carnosine, and were also efficient in protecting SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and rat hippocampal neurons from HNE-mediated death. The cytoprotective efficacy of these compounds suggests their potential as therapeutic agents for disorders that involve excessive membrane lipid peroxidation. Lantibiotics are antibiotic natural products that are synthesised ribosomally and undergo extensive post-translational modification, resulting in multiple thioether bridges and dehydro amino acids in the mature peptide. One such lantibiotic is mersacidin, which is produced by Bacillus sp. and exhibits extremely promising in vitro and in vivo efficacy versus a number of clinically relevant pathogens, most notably methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Mersacidin is believed to function by binding to the bacterial cell wall precursor lipid II, thereby preventing its incorporation into the growing peptidoglycan network. In an attempt to better understand this mode of action and develop more active analogues, we have embarked upon its chemical derivatisation. Some of these modifications resulted in an altered antibacterial spectrum, permitting some insight into tentative STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPs. The characterisation of these structurally complex compounds via a combination of multidimensional NMR and tandem mass spectrometry will also be presented. Conjugation of peptides with different moieties, such as PEG, lipids, carrier proteins and Toll-like receptor ligands is an established approach to improve their pharmacokinetic profile for drug use and/or to enhance their immunogenicity as subunit vaccines. The development of suitable conjugation strategies for peptides of any complexity is therefore fundamental for their effective use in human therapeutic applications.",

Our T7 random peptide phage library possesses a total diversity of 10 powered 10th consisting of different sequence length constrained by disulfide bond. By biopanning against human IgG, we isolated several IgG specific clones from our library. The peptides displayed on these phages shared some common sequences in the limited region surrounded by Cys residues, which suggests they are essential for binding. These clones bound only to Fc region of IgG and did neither other types of human immunoglobulin nor IgG of other animals.

The designed mimic has nearly the same sequence as IAPP but is highly soluble, nonamyloidogenic, noncytotoxic and a full IAPP receptor agonist. In addition, the mimic binds with high affinity IAPP and blocks and reverses with nanomolar activity its cytotoxic self-assembly which makes it to the most potent known IAPP cytotoxic self-assembly inhibitor. Due to its bifunctional nature, the mimic might find therapeutic application for the treatment of diabetes both as an inhibitor of amyloid cytotoxicity and as a soluble IAPP receptor agonist. Our findings offer a proof-of-principle of a chemical design approach for generating a novel class of highly potent inhibitors of polypeptide cytotoxic selfassembly which are nonamyloidogenic mimics of the native amyloidogenic sequence as well. Such reengineered biomolecules -the design of novel mimics is in progress-are of high biomedical significance for understanding the mechanism of protein aggregation diseases and for the development of prospective therapeutic treatments. Peptides that are capable of targeting abnormal changes of living tissue can be very useful in early detection or diagnosis of, e.g., cancer. Conjugating a functional agent, an effector unit, to such a peptide may provide the agent with improved pharmacodynamic properties.The specificity of a thiol group for reactive groups offer a unique way to attach effector units to cysteine-free linear or cyclic peptides. Tumor targeting peptides were synthesized by Fmoc-type solid phase methods. Peptides cyclic by cystine were modified by lactam bridges.

While more and more bacterial pathogens become resistant to common drugs, this part of insect innate immunity provides a new promising approach to develop future peptide-drugs. Proline-rich peptides possess a significant sequence homology and share a common mechanism of action. In addition Oglycosylated threonine residues of drosocin and formaecin appear to be necessary for full antimicrobial activity, although the significance of the carbohydrate moiety in interaction with intracellular targets is still unknown. We synthesized analogues of different antibacterial peptides on solid phase by the Fmoc-tBustrategy. The combination or insertion of sequence regions from different native antibacterial peptide sequences offers several advantageous effects, including further reduction of toxicity and broadening of the antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, mimicking the O-glycosylation site and changing the carbohydrate moieties, may yield new synthetic approaches to increase both the activity and the selectivity of these oligopeptides. New immunotherapeutic approaches have been developed for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases of the Alzheimer's dementia (AD) type. The identification of a \u00df-amyloid-plaque specific epitope, A\u00df(4-10) (FRHDSGY) [1] , recognised by therapeutically active antibodies from transgenic AD mice, provides the basis for development of new AD vaccines and for molecular AD diagnostics. In order to produce immunogenic conjugates, the A\u00df4-10 epitope was attached via thioether linkage to synthetic carriers of well-defined structures, such as tetratuftsin derivative (Ac-[TKPK(ClAc)G]4-NH2) and its elongated version by a helper T-cell epitope (Ac-FFLLTRILTIPQSLD-[TKPK(ClAc)G]4-NH2); sequential oligopeptide carrier (Ac-[Lys(ClAc)-Aib-Gly]4-OH) and multiple antigenic peptide (ClAc-Lys(ClAc)-Lys(ClAc-Lys(ClAc))-Arg-Arg-\u00dfAla-NH2). The epitope conjugates containing a cysteine residue either at the C-or N-terminus, and the chloroacetylated carriers were prepared by SPPS according to Boc/Bzl strategy. Conjugation reactions were performed in solution under slightly alkaline conditions, and monitored by HPLC and high resolution-MS. Structures and molecular homogeneities of all epitope peptides, carriers and conjugates were ascertained by HPLC, MALDI and ESI-FTICR-MS. Conformational preferences of the synthesized compounds in water and in TFE were examined by CD spectroscopy. Comparative binding studies of the conjugates with a mouse anti-amyloid protein beta-(1-17) monoclonal antibody were performed by indirect ELISA. Experimental data showed that the chemical nature of the carrier, the epitope topology and the presence of a pentaglycine spacer between the epitope peptide and the carrier, had significant effects on the antibody recognition and on the secondary structures of the conjugates. The new CLA analogue 1, containing ethylene bridge between Phe nitrogen atoms, was found to exhibit unexpected stimulatory effect in the model of the in vitro humoral immune response in mice. To disclose the STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP the NMR solution conformational analysis was carried out. The solid-state and solution conformational analysis of native CLA indicated the existence of this cyclic system as a complex mixture of conformations [1] . The NMR spectra recorded at 600 MHz in chloroform at 214 K showed the different conformational behaviour of both cyclopeptides: CLA exists as one isomer [1] , peptide 1 is in an equilibrium among at least of three conformers. The picornaviruses are small nonenveloped RNA viruses with a single positive strand RNA. The virus replication cycle starts after the penetration of the virus in the cytoplasm of the host cell. There are several stages of the virus life cycle used for attack. One of the most useful strategies for attacking of the virus includes inhibition of important for the virus lifecycle enzymes. The key enzymes in the replication of the picornaviruses are 3C and 2A proteases. Changes in the active center of these enzymes make them incapable to produce polyprotein in vitro, therefore the inhibition by low molecular weight molecules could stop the viral replication in vivo. 3C protease plays a major roll in the enzymatic proteolysis of the initial viral polyprotein. The target compounds were based on structural modifications in the known as crucial for the 3CP inhibition activity dipeptides Phe-Gln by incorporation of additional amino acid and pyrrole moiety. The synthesis was cared out as multiple-peptide synthesis in parallel using stepwise SPPS, Fmoc-strategy. The obtained compounds were tested for antiviral activity by agar-diffusion plaque inhibition test against Coxsackievirus B1 replication in FL cell and on this base some structure-activity interpretations were made. Histone deacetylases (HDAC) play important roles in various aspects of regulation such as proliferation, differentiation, and aging by counteracting with histone acetyl transferases. The HDACs categorized in class-I and II have a metalloprotease-related mechanism in its catalytic activity. These enzymes could be inhibited by small molecules bearing various zinc ligands such as hydroxamic acid and mercaptan. Based on the structure of chlamydocin, which has a cyclic tetrapeptide framework, cyclo(-L-Aoe-Aib-L-Phe-D-Pro-), where Aoe is (2S,9S)-2-amino-8-oxo-9,10-epoxydecanoyl, we have developed potent HDAC inhibitors as shown in the figure.",

The peptide (1) exhibited satisfactory activity to reduce both the blood glucose and blood insulin levels comparable to or even superior to those by pioglitazone, a PPAR\u03b3 agonist. The SS-hybrid (2) , which is expected to be reduced inside of cells to generate the corresponding thiol-containing cyclic tetrapeptide, also showed a significant effect but less than (1). The effect was dose-dependent from 3 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg. The effects of HDAC inhibitors were also confirmed by the observation of in vivo histone hyperacetylation induced in the lymphocyte cells. Synthetic peptides have a number of advantages over current vaccines. However, exploitation of synthetic peptides as vaccines has been limited by the small size; copy number, inefficient delivery, poor peptide immunogenicity and MHC restriction. We have developed chemical methodologies that overcome these limitations by synthesising and polymerising vinyl-peptides. Protective B-cell and T-cell peptide epitopes from the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis were identified for three different MHC restricted mouse strains using PEPSCAN techniques. Fmoc chemistry for SPPS was used to synthesize these peptides and a vinyl moiety was incorporated at the N-terminus using acryloyl chloride. After RP-HPLC purification free radical polymerisation using ammonium persulphate and TEMED was used to polymerise the vinyl-peptides in the presence of either acrylamide or other vinyl-monomers to produce single peptide or multi-peptide polymers. Size exclusion chromatography indicated that the peptide polymers were >2 million Da. The peptide polymers were used to immunise each mouse strain (BALB/c, CBA and C57Bl6) and the T-cell response induced was evaluated using proliferation and cytokine (ELISPOT) assays. The peptide polymers were found to be highly immunogenic, the single peptide polymers were found to only induce a response in their respective mouse strain, however, the multi-peptide polymer containing all of the T-cell epitopes was found to induce a response in all three mouse strains. In conclusion, our data shows that the polymerisation method overcomes all of the limitations in developing a peptide vaccine and most importantly that of MHC restriction. Cytotoxic substances are auspicious weapons in tumour therapy. This compounds inhibit cell division and proliferation, hence, they affect all cells that are able to divide. However, all these compounds act intracellularly, i.e. at first they have to enter the tumour cell efficiently. This is a serious obstacle when using highly effective cytostatica and the cause of severe adverse effects by using higher doses. Our aim is to overcome this problem by using synthetic hybride molecules composed of the cytostatic agent, in our case derivatives of arglabin, covalently linked to shuttle peptides. In order to identify the most effective possibility we tested two different strategies. By using the peptide hormone NPY, whose specific Y receptors are often overexpressed by tumour tissues, we intended to address the chemotherapeutic selectively to Y receptor expressing tumour cells via receptor mediated endocytosis.",

We investigated the peptide uptake by various cell lines and examined the release of the cytostatic agents inside the cells and its toxic effects. Background and aims: Synthetic peptides provide a straight-forward access to rationally designed inhibitors of molecular interactions based on structural information of proteins. Poor membrane permeability may be overcome via cell-penetrating peptides, but low stability remains a major drawback. An increase of stability and bioactivity of peptides by coupling to polymers is intended. Methods: For the development of peptide-functionalized cell-penetrating polymer conjugates, peptides were coupled chemoselectivly to HPMA (N-(2hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide, average MW 28.5 kDa), as an inert backbone polymer by native chemical ligation. HPMA is water soluble and its capacity in drug delivery has been demonstrated. Peptide-functionalized polymers and free peptides were incubated with proteases or cell lysates and proteolytic break-down was determined by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) deriving information on the number and size of fluorescent particles based on temporal fluctuations of a fluorescence signal caused by diffusion of particles through a femtoliter-size confocal detection volume. The diffusion time depends on molecular size. Therefore this technique is suited for the detection of proteolytic fragments. Results: Efficient chemoselective conjugation of unprotected fluorescein-labelled peptides was accomplished by means of native chemical ligation. Our FCS investigations revealed that conjugation of peptides to HPMA increased their biostability. This data also indicate that this effect is peptide-dependent. A proapoptotic peptide coupled to HPMA and introduced into mammalian cells by electroporation retained its bioactivity. Cofunctionalization of HPMA with this peptide and nonaargine yielded an efficient cellular import. Macrolides, a rather large group of natural or semi-synthetic antibiotics, are widely known translation inhibitors whose structure is based on 14-16-member lactones with carbohydrate substitutes attached. Macrolides bind to ribosomal tunnel (RT) in a way that their lactone ring is located orthogonally to the long axis of the RT, covering most of its cleft. Carbohydrate residues of the macrolides are spread along the walls of the RT. Hence, the mechanism of protein synthesis inhibition by macrolides relies on the mechanical obstruction they provide to the passage of nascent polypeptide chain through the RT. The goal of this study was to design and obtain peptide derivatives of macrolides interesting both as antibacterial agents and potential probes for investigation of nascent peptide chain topography in the RT. Tylosin ( In order to reach target sites inside the CNS, neurotherapeutic candidates must overcome the blood-brain barrier (BBB). While several transport mechanisms occur at the BBB, this work has focused on the passive diffusion mechanism. The prediction of a peptide's ability to cross the BBB is not a simple task; hence there exists the need for the rational study of the relevant factors that affect the movement across this physiological barrier. Here we present two new approaches based on in vitro non cellular assays for this type of studies. Firstly, the evaluation of compound mixtures on parallel artificial membrane permeability assays (PAMPA). This approach increases the throughput of the study and structure-activity relationships can be easily establish. Secondly, the transport and biological activity evaluation in a single assay. This second approach has been applied to the search of inhibitors for CNS proteases involved in different neurological diseases (such as Prolyl Oligopeptidase for schizophrenia) able to cross the BBB. These two new approaches allow assaying compound's permeability in the early stages of a drug development project, and then designing novel analogues with improved BBB transport properties or using blood-brain-barrier shuttles for their delivery.",

These functional groups, as well as established good lipid solubility suggest that the main target for their biological action probably will be central nervous system. The presence of aminoacid L -Valin, supposes their low toxicity, confirmed by our earlier experiments. The aim of the present work is to study their pharmacological activity as putative drugs. Methods: Male Albino mice (18-20g, 10 in groups) were used. Next neuropharmacological parameters were studied: Analgesic effect (acetic acid test), neuromuscular coordination (Rota-rod test), Orientation (\"hole board\" test) and learning and memory (passive avoidance-step down test). Results: Significant analgesic effect of both compounds was established (more pronounced by dose 250 mg/kg i.p.). Slight depressing effect on the orientation reactions in animals was registered, but the neuromuscular coordination and locomotor activity of treated animals were not changed. Good dose-dependent effect on learning and memory was established and \u041c-6 had stronger effect than \u0420-6. The compounds modified the effects of some model substances with central nervous activity. Hexobarbital sleeping time was significantly prolonged by P-6, but was antagonized by M-6. Pentileneterazole threshold was increased significantly and suggests some anticonvulsant activity of both compounds. Conclusion: As positional isomers M-6 and P-6 demonstrated some variations in their pharmacological activity probably due to the differences in their kinetics, metabolism and excretion. Registered significant neuropharmacological activity, accompanied by low toxicity motivates the new synthesis and future experimental studies.

            "text": "The Tyr-MIF-1 family of peptides (Tyr-MIF-1`s) includes MIF-1, Tyr-MIF-1, Tyr-W-MIF-1 and Tyr-K-MIF-1, which have been isolated from bovine hypothalamus and human brain cortex. All these peptides interact with opioid receptors and in addition bind to non-opiate sites specific for each of the peptides. Data in the literature suggest that Tyr-MIF-1`s have antiopioid and opioid -like effects. We used Wistar rats to study distribution and density of the tyrozine hydroxylase (TH) imunoreactive fibres and NADPH-d reactive neurons in the rat ventral and dorsal striatum. Our results showed that neuropeptides MIF-1 and Tyr-MIF-1 may affect them. Opioid peptides have been recognized as modulators of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mouse macrophages and human neutrophils. Data in the literature suggest that peptides of the Tyr-MIF-1 family -MIF-1 and Tyr-MIF-1 have antiopioid and opioid -like effects. These neuropeptides are isolated from bovine hypothalamus and human brain cortex. So far no data about direct scavenger properties of Tyr-MIFs peptides were available. In this study we tested the hypothesis that they may scavenge ROS in vitro. The antioxidant activity of these two substances was studied in the concentration range of 10-6 -10-4 mol/l. We investigated the luminol-dependent chemiluminescence to test their ability to scavenge the biologically relevant oxygen-derived species: hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical, hypochlorous acid in vitro. We found that Tyr-MIF-1 was a powerful scavenger in all tested systems. The effects were higher for hypochlorous anion and weaker for superoxide radical. MIF-1 had no scavenge activity against the hydroxyl and superoxide radicals and showed a moderate scavenger effect on hypochlorous anion. We have compared different strategies to increase the immunogenicity of an antigenic HIV peptide as a vaccine candidate. Our selected B-cell epitope comprises 15 amino acids (317-331) of the V3 region of HIV-1, JY1 isolate (subtype D), and is in tandem with a T-helper epitope corresponding to the 830-844 region of tetanus toxoid. Several presentations, including oligomerization, MAP dendrimer, conjugation to dextran beads or to other macromolecular carriers, have been synthesized and evaluated. Murine sera from the different presentations of the V3 epitope have been compared with regard to antibody titers and cross-reactivity with heterologous HIV subtypes. The MAP dendrimer version of the peptide, conjugated to recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen protein, was a better immunogen than the dendrimer alone, and showed higher immunogenicity than other multimeric presentations, or than the peptide alone conjugated to dextran beads. The MAP dendrimer version, either alone or conjugated to HBsAg, enhanced cross-reactivity towards heterologous V3 sequences relative to monomeric peptide. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) responsible for critical diseases (eg. acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease) are classified over 100 serotypes according to their surface virulence M proteins. Development of vaccine to prevent infection with GAS is hampered by the widespread diversity of circulating GAS strains and M protein serotypes, and multivalent vaccine strategy would contribute to prevention against various GAS infections and provide better protective immunity. We have studied the efficacy of incorporating four different epitopes derived from GAS M protein into a single synthetic lipid core peptide (LCP) construct, in inducing broadly protective immune responses against GAS following parenteral delivery to mice. Peptide vaccine was synthesized on MBHA resin by manual SPPS in situ neutralization/HBTU activation in Boc-chemistry. Immunisation with the mono-or multi-epitopic LCP vaccine led to high titers of antigen-specific systemic IgG responses, and the production of broad protective immune responses as demonstrated by the ability of immune sera to opsonise multiple GAS strains. Systemic challenge of mice after primary vaccination showed that mice were significantly protected against GAS infection in comparison with control mice demonstrating that vaccination stimulated long-lasting protective immunity. These data support to the usefulness of LCP system in the development of synthetic multiepitope vaccine to prevent GAS infection.",

One of its optimal epitopes is the 9-22 region (9LKMADPNRFRGKDL22). Several cyclic peptides possessing thioether bond and different ring size have been already prepared and some of them were conjugated with tetratuftsin derivative (Ac-[TKPKG]4-NH2) by thioether bond formation using selectively removable Cys protecting groups. Antibody recognition results suggested that the size of the cycle has considerable influence on antibody recognition, however, the replacement of Met in position 11 by Nle is permitted. Conjugation of cyclic peptide might increase the antibody recognition, but the binding depends on the structure and/or conjugation site of the cyclic peptide. Conjugate with the best binding capacity (7.2 pmol/100uL) as well as the conjugate containing the linear (9-22C) epitope (0.7 pmol/100uL) were selected for immunization. In order to increase the production of antibodies a new group of conjugates was prepared. In these constructs promiscouos T cell epitope peptide derived from tetanus toxoid (YSYFPSV) was attached to both amino groups of lysine residue coupled to the N-terminus of the carrier (Ac-YSYFPSV-K(Ac-YSYFPSV)-[TKPK(ClAc)G]4-NH2). The Cys containing linear and cyclic epitope peptides were conjugated to the carrier in solution (0.1M Tris buffer, pH 8). This work was supported by grants of the Spanish-Hungarian Intergovernmental Program and COST Chemistry Action. Background. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHT) is characterized with increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and in 70% of PHT patients with hypertension. It was previously shown that pro-analogue of PTH with a reversed sequence (which include strong alkali sequence -Arg-Lys-Lys-) induced significant hypertensive response at dose 10-10M/kg b.w. One of the hypothesis attributed hypertension in PHT patients to the presence of fragments of degraded PTH possessing -Arg-Lys-Lys-sequence. Aim. To compare influence on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of analogue of 25-34 PTH fragment (amide) and 25-34 fragment of PTH, with -Arg-Lys-Lys-sequence and also responsible for binding to PTH receptor. Methods. Chosen peptides were synthesized manually by a solid phase peptide synthesis method. The purity of the products was tested by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The synthesized peptides showed the right molecular mass. The influence on MAP of synthesized peptides was tested in Wistar rats. Sequential increasing boluses of each peptide: 10-10, 10-9 and 10-8M/kg.b.w. in the same animal were given i.v. Blood pressure was measured continuously in carotid artery. Results. Injection of synthesized analogue of 25-34 fragment of PTH does not show influence on MAP vs. control group. Synthesized 25-34 fragment of PTH increased MAP in 92min. of experiment for 12mmHg \u00b1 3mmHg vs. time of administration of first dose and for 17mmHg vs. control group. Conclusion. It seems to be possible, that in case of alternate degradation of PTH, accumulation of 25-34 fragment of PTH may partially play role in the mechanism inducing hypertension in PHT patients.",

The program of research of biological properties of synthesized tetrapeptide RNWD and heptapeptide RNWDVYK included the study of their binding with IgE, which was contained in standard solutions and in patients' blood serum. The binding of peptides with IgE was explored by the IFA method using IgE antibodies labeled with horse-radish peroxidase (HRPO). Peptides in the concentration of 100 mkg/ml were used for sorption on immunological plotting boards. Higher correlation between the IgE concentration and the optical density of the solution after introducing monoclonal antibodies labeled with HRPO and substrate chromogenic mixture (r=0.99) was found in the diagnostic system with sorption RNWDVYK-peptide than in the diagnostic system with sorption RNWD-peptide (r=0.94). Similar investigations were conducted with the diagnostic systems with sorption RNWD and RNWDVYK peptides, but RWND peptides conjugated with HRPO were used as antibodies against immunoglobulin E, instead of HRPO-labeled monoclonal antibodies. Almost equal correlation was found between the concentration of IgE in standard serum and serum of allergy patients with the known concentration of IgE and the optical density of the solutions after introducing the RNWD peptide, conjugated with HRPO. After introducing allergy patients' blood serum in the holes on the plotting board, the heptapeptide bound 23.79% more IgE than the tetrapeptide. Our experiments demonstrated a high IgE binding activity of synthetic RNWD-and RNWDVYK-peptides. In this study, the Information Spectrum Method (ISM) of the HA1 subunit of the H5 hemagglutinin protein of the Influenza Virus, H5N1, of different reference isolates was performed in order to identify possible antigenic determinants resistant to virus mutations. Results of this analysis demonstrated that the primary structures of HA1 subunit of H5 hemagglutinins encode a common information corresponding to one characteristic frequency in their ISs, which is probably important for the biological function of these proteins, including their possible recognition by the immune proteins targeting this molecule. Besides, comparison of the ISs of HA1 proteins of H1 \"Spanish flu\" and H5N1 isolates demonstrated an informational similarity between them. Based on these results, a segment of the N-terminus of HA1 H5N1 was identified to play a crucial role in the inhibitory and immunological properties of all possible H5N1 variants. The identified core segment, being highly conserved in all H5 strains, was selected as an antigenic determinant and coupled to the Sequential Oligopeptide Carrier (SOCn), (Lys-Aib-Gly)n, to the Lys-N\u03b5H2 groups, in order to develop a diagnostic immunoassay and formulate a vaccine candidate for the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus. Background and aims: Thrombin plays a key role in various disorders such as arterial thrombosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis, inflammation and myocardial infarction. Insights into the way in which thrombin interacts with its many substrates and cofactors have been clarified by crystal structure and site-directed mutagenesis analyses, but until recently there has been little consideration of how its non-proteolytic functions are performed. We investigated cardiovascular effects of seven modified proline-and RGD-containing peptides designed from three surface-exposed sites of prothrombin, corresponding to residues 218-223, 332-347, and 445-454. Methods: Cardioprotective effects of synthetic peptides were tested on the two rat models of heart failure produced by coronary artery occlusion (10-or 45-min) and reperfusion (30-or 240-min). Arterial blood pressures from left carotid artery, heart rate and ECG II standard lead were measured throughout experiment. At the end of second experiment hearts were morphologically investigated by light microscopy and electron microscopy methods. Results: On animal model with short-term ischemia investigated peptides did not protected from myocardium ischemia during occlusion, however, TP-L13, BK-mc and TP-H7 protected rat hearts from ventricular fibrillation, contributed more significant functional recovery during reperfusion and raising survival rate. On the model with prolong ischemia, acceptable cardioprotective effect revealed TP-H7 and BK-mc. These peptides significantly diminished necrotic zone of left ventricle, protected hearts from ischemia-reperfusion induced functional and morphological changes. Conclusions: Investigated proline-containing peptides revealed activity on cardiovascular system -decreasing of blood pressure, cardioprotective properties and improved recovery from ischemia.",

Background: Endostatin inhibits the proliferation of endothelial cells and induces their apoptosis. The measurement of serum endostatin can predict tumor vascularity. Tumor angiogenesis is a strong prognostic factor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). Significantly high levels of endostatin were noted in patients with trabecular-type tumors , and with hepatitis infection. Methods : 20 patients with HCC, 16 patients with GIT malignancies, 8 patients with liver metastasis and 8 without metastasis, and 10 normal persons . All subjects were tested for alfa-feto protein (AFP) , CA19.9 , Carcinoemberyonic antigen (CEA), and Endostatin by ELISA Results : Endostatin in normal control persons was 47.5 \u00b1 14.22 ng/ml with a significant elevation (p< 0.001) between the HCC group and all the other tested groups .AFP was 1.9 \u00b1 0.98 ng/ml in normal persons with a significant elevation between HCC and all the other tested groups ( p< 0.01).

They are widespread in nature and play the role of an effective weapon of innate immune system against bacteria, fungi and viruses. The purpose of this study was to investigate the in vitro activity of natural antimicrobial peptides: citropin, piscidin, protegrin, temporin, uperin and the analogues of antimicrobial peptides: iseganan, pexiganan and omiganan. The peptides were synthesized using the solid-phase method and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. The peptides were subjected to microbiological tests [MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimal bactericidal concentration)] on reference strains of bacteria, according to the procedures outlined by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). For comparison, conventional antibiotics (vancomycin, rifampycin, piperacillin, chloramphenicol) were included in this research. Both the natural antimicrobial peptides and the analogues inhibited the growth of bacteria, but at higher concentrations than did conventional antibiotics. Nevertheless, both natural origin of antimicrobial peptides and their low toxicity constitute a considerable advantage and this is an argument for considering the antimicrobial peptides as good candidates for medicines. The linear hexapeptide cypate-GRDSPK (compound 1; the cypate moiety is a near-infrared fluorescent label) whose RGD sequence was rearranged to GRD showed high uptake in the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-positive tumor tissues in vitro and in vivo. Despite low affinity of 1 to the integrin in the binding assays, the uptake was inhibited by equimolar amounts of the cyclic peptide c(RGDfV), which possesses high affinity to \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin. These observations led to hypothesis that cell internalization of compound 1 may be mediated mostly by only one of the integrin subunits, as the \u03b23 one. Indeed, blocking of \u03b1v integrin by the specific antibody did not inhibit the internalization of 1 in tumor cells, which was in the contrast with successful blocking the cell internalization by the anti-\u03b23 integrin antibody. Similar results were obtained in immunocytochemical assays employing the anti-\u03b1v and anti-\u03b23 integrin antibodies. Also, studies utilizing the \u03b23-knockout and wild-type mouse cell lines demonstrated that deletion of the \u03b23 subunit markedly decreased internalization of compound 1 in the \u03b23knockout cells. The preferential interaction of compound 1 with the \u03b23 subunit of integrins relative to the \u03b1v subunit was supported also by molecular modeling studies. Summarizing, the bulk of our experimental and modeling data emphasizes interaction with the \u03b23 integrin as the primary mechanism of the uptake of cypate-GRDSPK by tumors. Since this compound showed the superior biodistribution profile in vivo, our results may provide a strategy to image and monitor the functional status of the \u03b23 integrin in cells and live animals.",

Cardiac troponins are released into the bloodstream of patients after the onset of a cardiovascular damage. Even minimal elevations over the normal values, of serum troponin T and I are being used to diagnose acute myocardial infarction and also to rule out the patients' condition. The development and commercialization of highly specific biological assays for the detection of cardiac troponins is based on the production of specific antibodies against the whole complex or individual subunits. However, the specificity and sensitivity of these assays vary due to problems mainly originated from the fact that cardiac troponins have a high homology with the skeletal isoforms.

            "text": "The past decade has seen a growing interest in \u03b2-amino acids, which are important intermediates for the synthesis of compounds of pharmaceutical interest and can be used as building blocks for peptidomimetics. Oligomers of \u03b2-amino acids (\u03b2-peptides) fold into compact helices in solution. Recently, a novel class of \u03b2-peptide analogues adopting predictable and reproducible folding patterns (foldamers) was evaluated as a potential source of new drugs and catalysts. Studies on synthetic \u03b2-amino acids can be facilitated by versatile and robust methods for determining the enantiomeric purity of starting materials and products. Highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is one of the most useful techniques for the recognition and/or separation of stereoisomers including enantiomers. The aim of the present work was to evaluate HPLC methods for the separation of enantiomers of eighteen 3-amino-3-aryl-substituted propanoic acids (\u03b2-amino acids). Direct separations were carried out on different macrocyclic glycopeptide based stationary phases, such as ristocetin A containing Chirobiotic R, teicoplanin containing Chirobiotic T, teicoplanin aglycon containing Chirobiotic Tag, vancomycin containing Chirobiotic V columns and on a chiral crown ether based column. The effects of different parameters on selectivity, such as the nature of the organic modifier, the mobile phase composition, the flow rate and the structure of the analytes are examined and discussed. The separation of the stereoisomers was optimized by variation of the chromatographic parameters. The efficiency of the different methods and the role of molecular structure in the enantioseparation were noted. The elution sequence of the enantiomers was determined in most cases.",

Lax 2 1 Amgen, Inc., Pharmaceutics, Thousand Oaks, CA 2 PolyPeptide Laboratories, Inc., Torrance, CA, USA Recent years have seen an enormous increase in interest in peptide therapeutics. New peptide leads are often chosen by screening procedures using microgram to milligram quantities of peptides, frequently provided by specialized manufacturers utilizing automatic synthesizers to maximize output. The purity of the resulting compounds is often not very high. The use of SPPS synthetic procedures predetermines that most impurities are closely related and difficult to resolve by reversephase purification. These factors, combined with the use of generic analytical methods not specifically optimized for the peptide in question (e.g. the ubiquitous 0.1% TFA/water/acetonitrile system), lead to erroneous results that frequently severely overestimate the purity of the peptide. The use of poorly characterized materials in pharmaceutical development leads to significant risks of obtaining false negative or false positive results that may cause potential leads to be overlooked or misinterpretation of their pharmacological profiles.",

Utilizing the increased separation efficiency by increasing the column temperature and adjusting the gradient in two steps in reverse-phase buffers containing TFA, NaClO4, or ion-exchange buffers containing KCl, we demonstrate that methods -suitable for preclinical research -can be developed rapidly. The proposed approach will be illustrated with examples of peptides ranging between 9 and 28 amino acids and a model peptide VYPNGA. It will be demonstrated that peptides showing an HPLC purity close to 100% are often 10 -25% less pure. To approach a high-throughput cell assay format using peptides, we attempt to design and construct a peptide microarray for examination of cell activities of peptides including apoptotic cell death. Peptides were immobilized onto solid surfaces via a novel multi-functional linker. The linker enable us to examine various types of peptide cell assays in an array format. We also designed and synthesized peptidyl capture agents on the basis of the cell-active sequences suitable for the peptide microarray. ",

            "text": "The utility of targeted nanoparticles as fluorescent probes for tissue imaging has recently been subject to widespread interest. One exciting prospect is the further development of nanoparticles conjugated to both targeting peptides and cytotoxic cargoes. These nanodevices could preferentially bind to specific cells and/or tissues to provide effective tools for drug delivery. Hence, such multifunctional nanoparticles could provide both diagnostic and therapeutic functions by acting as fluorescent probes that offer targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. We have coated the surface of quantum dots (Qdots) with cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) to target and label U251M cells for fluorescence imaging. Qdots were initially coupled to polyethylene glycol linkers via carboxyl functionalities on their surface. A heterogeneous mixture of poly-arginine peptides of varying lengths (Arg(6)-Arg(10)) were covalently coupled via amide bonds to the polyethylene glycol linkers, conferring a cell penetrating capacity to the modified Qdots. Fluorescence imaging of U251M cells, after incubation with the conjugated Qdots at concentrations of 20nM, gave clear signals indicating cell binding and internalisation of the modified Qdots across the plasma membrane. We aim to further expand this work by employing racemic mixtures of CPP and cytotoxic agents to engineer conjugates that will facilitate both imaging and the therapeutic delivery of cytotoxic moieties. The ability of cell penetrating peptides (CPP) to deliver biologically active cargoes into different cell types has been successfully applied in several experimental systems. Despite the progress and growing number of described CPPs, reports about the internalization mechanisms and the intracellular routes of CPPs still remain controversial. We have characterized the membrane interaction and cellular localization of proteins delivered into HeLa cells by cell penetrating peptide transportan (TP) and its shorter analogue TP10 on ultrastructural level. Our previous results obtained by transmission electron microscopy showed that complexes of transportans with gold-labeled streptavidin translocated into cells inducing large invagination of plasmamembrane, suggesting the uptake by macropinocytosis. The complexes of transportan with gold-labeled neutravidin, in contrary, were taken into cells mostly via caveosomes and clathrin-coated vesicles. The cell-transduced transportanprotein complexes localized mainly in the vesicular structures of different size and morphology. Most of the complexes-containing vesicles in the perinuclear area contained also Lamp2 protein, marker of late endosomes and lysosomes. Still, the transportan-protein complexes were not confined in the membrane-surrounded vesicles, but spread in the cytosol suggesting the escape of transportan-protein complexes from endosomes. Our findings show the involvement of different endocytic pathways in the transportan-mediated uptake process of proteins. The concentration of a CPP and the properties of cargo protein seem to determine the pathway for the cellular uptake of a particular construct.",

In this study we designed new targeting motifs aimed to deliver various antitumoral drugs specifically to cells involved in tumor vascularization. We inserted this short RGD sequence in tetracyclopeptides closed with various means. We expect these new cyclotetrapeptides to be more specific for the targeted receptor. Moreover, these new type of cyclic peptides were multimerized on different scaffold to further improve the receptor avidity. Our purpose is first to scrutinize and to quantify the efficient cellular uptake of these molecules and second, to address the specific cell targeting of a fluorescent cargo by differents tools such as Fluorescence Activated Cells Sorting (FACS) analysis or fluorescence microscopy. These new targeting units were evaluated on two different cell lines: Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) with an over expression of the alphaV-beta3 integrin receptor and A549 cells expressing a much lower level of this receptor.

            "text": "We have recently developed new approaches for obtaining highly immunogenic peptide conjugates: synthetic polyelectrolytes (PE) were used for the conjugation with peptide molecules in which PE carry out the carrier and adjuvant roles simultaneously. In this study, 4 epitopes of antigenic parts of surface antigen of Hepatitis B virus (2-16, 22-35, 95-109 and 115-129 of the s gene.) had been synthesized.The synthesis of peptides was performed by Explorer PLS \u00ae Automated Microwave Synthesis Workstation (CEM). Peptide conjugates of synthetic anionic polyelectrolytes (copolymers of acrylic asid and N-vinylpyrrolidone) were synthesized by carbodiimide condensation following the modification procedures described early. Composition and structure of bioconjugates were characterized by HPLC (Shimadzu), NanoSPR-3, Zetasizer Nano ZS, Steady State Fluorescence Spectrometer QM-4 and Viscotek TDA 302 size exclusion chromatography. It was obtained that a single immunization of mice with PE-peptide conjugates without classical adjuvant increased the primary and secondary peptide-specific immune response to HBsAg. Moreover, these conjugates possess own selectivity for recognizing the antibody in blood sera of hepatitis virus injected people. Tissue engineering requires delivery of transplanted cells to organ sites needing repair/regeneration. We have demonstrated that several active laminin peptide-conjugated chitosan membranes enhanced the biological activity and promoted cell adhesion in a cell-type specific manner. The most active laminin peptide (AG73: RKRLQVQLSIRT)-conjugated chitosan membrane could deliver keratinocytes to a wound bed. When human keratinocytes were seeded onto the AG73-chitosan membranes under serum-free condition, more than 70% of the cells attached within 2 hrs. The membranes carrying keratinocytes were stable enough for handling with forceps and were inverted onto the muscle fascia exposed on the trunk of nude mice. Keratinocyte sheets were observed after 3 days and colonies appeared after 7 days on the fascia of host mice. These cells were multilayered on day-3 and expressed various keratinocyte markers, including cytokeratin-1, involculin, and laminin ?2-chain. These results suggest that the AG73-conjugated chitosan membrane is useful as a therapeutic formulation and is applicable as a cell delivery system, such as delivering keratinocytes to the wound bed. The peptide-chitosan approach may be a powerful cell transplantation tool for various tissues and organs. The fluorescent semi-conductive (CdSe/ZnS) nanocristals possess very attractive optical properties that could be used for tracking individually biological receptors in vivo. Our aim is to design functionalized water-soluble semi-conductive nanocristals (or quantum dots) that interact selectively with lipidic or biological membranes. To valid our approach, the interaction between the decorated QD and giant vesicles were observed by optical fluorescent and dark field microscopies. In view to solubilize and selectively bind fluorescent nanocristals to a lipid membrane, heterobifunctionalized peptidic ligands (LiIPe) that presented an adhesion domain for the nanocristal surface, an hydrophilic spacer and a terminal recognition function, were synthetized. The collo\u00efdal stability of the water-soluble nanocristals (NC-LiPe) was checked by dynamic light scattering, optical and electron microscopies The interaction of grafted nanocristals (NC-LiPe) with positive or neutral giant vesicles was observed by optical fluorescence and dark field microscopies. As shown in figure, negatively charged nanocristals (NC-LiPe) selectively adsorbed onto the surface of positively charged giant vesicles without altering the morphology of the vesicle. The nanocristals appeared as fluorescent patches growing on the surface of the vesicle until completely recovering. Therefore these ligands (LiPe) permitted to chemically functionalize the nanocristals by keeping their collo\u00efdal stability and their fluorescence in water. Furthermore it was possible to selectively label vesicle membrane.",

Exendin-4 was incubated in plasma at 37 \u2103, extracted with SEP-PAK octadecyl columns and subsequently analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that exendin-4 was slowly broken down in plasma with a half-life of 9.57 h.

The i.t. administration of nociceptin resulted in nociceptive behavioral responses, which were eliminated by the i.t. co-administration of opioid receptor like-1 (ORL-1) receptor antagonists. The nociceptive behaviors were significantly attenuated by the i.t. co-administration of the H1 receptor antagonists, but not the H2 receptor antagonists.

The present study was designed to characterize the nociceptive behaviours induced by intrathecal (i.t.) administration of HK-1 in mice. The i.t. administration was made in conscious mice according to the method described by Hylden and Wilcox. Immediately after the i.t. administration, the accumulated time for nociceptive behaviours was measured for 10 min. The i.t. administration of HK-1 dose-dependently produced characteristic nociceptive behaviours consisting of scratching, biting and licking, which peaked at 0-5 min and almost disappeared by 15 min after injection. The subcutaneous pretreatment with morphine dose-dependently attenuated the HK-1-induced nociceptive behaviours. The nociceptive behaviours elicited by low-dose of HK-1 were significantly inhibited by i.t. co-administration with NK1 receptor antagonist, however, the nociceptive behaviours elicited by high-dose of HK-1 were not affected by i.t. coadministration with NK1 receptor antagonist. On the other hand, NMDA receptor antagonists significantly suppressed both high-and low-doses of HK-1-induced nociceptive behaviours in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the nociceptive behaviours induced by low-dose of HK-1 may be mediated through both NK1 and NMDA receptors, whereas high-dose of HK-1 may induce the nociceptive behaviours through NMDA receptor",

Until recently, it was generally assumed that triacylated LP, like the synthetic Pam3Cys-SK4, are recognized by TLR2/TLR1 heteromers, whereas diacylated LP, like FSL-1, induce signalling through TLR2/TLR6 heteromers. Contrary to this model, we could show that depending on the peptide moiety, diacylated LP also signal in a TLR6-independent and TLR1-dependent manner. The aim of this study was to analyse more closely the structural basis of this heteromer usage. The synthesis of LP was carried out by fully automated solid phase peptide synthesis and Fmoc/tBu chemistry on TCP or Rink amide resin. Information on the structural factors determining the TLR2/TLR1 versus TLR2/TLR6 heteromer usage was obtained by testing of ligands with cells obtained from TLR2 , TLR6 , and TLR1-deficient mice. When stimulating B-lymphocytes of wild-type mice we found that ester-bound long-chain fatty acids are necessary to induce considerable responses. For triacylated LP with long chain length ester-bound acyl residues (like Pam3C-SSNASK4) the response in TLR1-deficient cells was only slightly decreased, whereas for LP with short length ester-bound fatty acids (like PamOct2C-SSNASK4) the response was completely abolished.

The C-terminus of the second conserved region (C2) of gp120, encompassing NTM peptide is important for infectivity and neutralization of HIV-1, while human natural anti-vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) antibodies reactive with gp120 play an important role in control of HIV disease progression.

Peptides with molecular masses < 5000 kDa should be conjugated with carrier proteins in order to ensure their immunogenicity and protect from proteolysis. In these cases the comparison of peptide immunogenicities and immunotest system development should be performed having in mind exact peptide-to-protein ratios. 23 conjugates of peptide fragments of hepatitis C virus envelope protein E2 with ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin, and myoglobin were prepared using glutaraldehyde (GA), m-maleimidobenzoyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, dimethyl suberimidate (DMS), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide as conjugating reagents. The rough evidence of the peptide-protein conjugate formation was obtained by PAGE. The exact peptide:protein molar ratio was estimated in all 23 conjugates by SELDI-MS. Almost all conjugates had oligomeric structures due to the formation of intermolecular linkages between proteins. The peptide : protein molar ratio in conjugates varied from 1:1 to 13,6:1. Conjugates obtained with the GA were more diversified in the number of peptide molecules linked to carrier proteins (peptide:protein ratios ranged from 3:1 to 13:1) than other conjugation reagents",

Moreover, these peptides are able to transport other substances into cells. This strategy was successfully applied in cases of CsA, taxol, and other drugs to improve their bioavailability. Now we have synthesized a series of analogues of cyclolinopeptide A, CLX, and the immunosuppressive fragment of ubiquitin, covalently bound to the cell-penetrating fragment of Tat and its analogues. The ability to cross the biological membranes and the immunosuppressive activities of these conjugates were tested. The conformation of the peptides was determined by circular dichroism",

To address the integrity of CPPs during their trafficking, a fluorescent double-labelled Antp peptide was designed and used as an intracellular FRET-sensor. Results: Endocytosis-mediated uptake of the CPP-cargo conjugate led to a significant reduction of cargo bioactivity compared to its direct transfer via transient membrane permeation. This finding was related to the sequestration of peptides within endocytic vesicles but also, in the case of the TNF response, to the induction of receptor internalization during cell entry. Moreover, during endolysosomal passage peptides undergo significant proteolytical degradation. Conclusions: The endocytosis-dependent uptake mechanism of",

Fully protected HIV-Tat-(48-57)-Cys(Snm)-Gly-NH-R was obtained by conversion of the corresponding Cys(Acm) peptide which was synthesized by the solid-phase method [Snm: (N-methyl-N-phenylcarbamoyl)-sulfenyl] [1]. The sulfhydryl function was introduced to the hydroxyl groups of CP by acylation with Trt-3-mercaptopropionic acid followed by acid treatment. Resulting 3-mercaptopropionyl-CP was coupled with Cys(Snm) peptide to form disulfide bridge and the protecting groups of the peptide were removed to give the CP-Tat conjugate.

Peptides were conjugated to the 5' end of the siRNA sense or antisense strand via a thioether bond under denaturing conditions to prevent aggregation and precipitation. The ability of conjugates to translocate fluorescently-labeled siRNA across the plasma membrane was evaluated by flow cytometry. The results indicate that some peptides can mediate higher efficiency uptake of siRNA into cells compared with Lipofectamine or cholesterol-conjugated siRNA. The peptide-siRNA formulation with 27-mer siRNA conjugates showed higher knockdown of TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels in activated human monocytes in vitro compared to the conjugated 21-mer siRNA species.

To improve the pharmacological profile of some Camptothecin derivatives (CPTs), five conjugates were designed, where the cytotoxic drugs were covalently attached to the RGD peptide analogues for preferential uptake into tumor cells. The peptides to be used have been selected among a series of new pentacyclic peptides bearing at 5-position a trifunctional pseudoamino acid with a carboxy-terminal side-chain. Peptide analogues showing the highest affinity to alfa v beta 3 and alfa v beta 5 integrins were coupled with CPTs at different positions. The conjugates have been optimized for binding to the receptors, proteolytic stability and an overall improvement in tumor selectivity. The nature of the linkage between RGDs and CPTs has a major impact on stability and biological activity of the conjugates. The conjugates with amide bond, but not those with ester bond, are sufficiently stable and show in vitro antitumor activity against A498 and A2780 cell lines",

The configuration of the unnatural amino acids in the peptides was determined by chiral TLC using enantiomeric standards. Radioligand binding assays and in vitro GPI and MVD assays indicated that several analogues showed high, subnanomol affinity and high selectivity for mu-opioid receptors having agonist or antagonist properties.

The influence of polymer molecular weight (RG 502H, RG504H) on the morphology, erosion of matrices and also on their in-vitro drug release behavior over a period of 28 days was assessed for leuprolide acetate in this study. Methods: Each formulation was composed of 33% (w/w) polymer and 3% (w/w) leuprolide acetate dissolved in NMP. Release studies were performed in a home-made diffusion cell at 37\u00b0C. The polymer erosion was studied using two different methods as follows. (a): L-lactic acid detection (b): pH change study. The morphology of the matrices was then analyzed by scanning electron microscope",

More specifically, the photoelectronic properties of nanometric films formed by peptide self-assembled monolayers have been actively investigated. In this work interdigitated gold microelectrodes were modified by covalently linking a hexapeptide ester functionalized by a lipoic acid (Lipo) at the N-terminus. The peptide chain [Lipo-(Aib)4-Trp-Aib-OtBu] comprises five \u03b1-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) residues and one Trp, a fluorescent amino acid with strong absorptions in the UV region. Due to the very high percentage of conformationally constrained Aib residues in the chain, the peptide adopts a rigid 3-10-helical structure. Cyclic voltammetry measurements indicate that the peptide forms a homogeneously and densely packed monolayer on the gold surface, while current/voltage curves exhibit interesting rectifying properties of the peptide SAM. Photocurrent generation experiments, performed on the peptide-layered microelectrode, show peculiar modifications of the spectrum. At 240 nm a notably higher photocurrent/voltage response was observed for the peptide-modified electrode, suggesting that a photoinduced electron transfer process from Trp to gold does take place with high efficiency",

The aim of this work is to selectively activate enzymes at their C-terminal position in order to allow specific immobilisation. We chose AKR1A1, an enzyme of the aldo/keto reductase superfamily, for the synthesis of an artificially monolabeled redoxprotein. AKR1A1 is a monomeric enzyme and catalyzes the NADPH dependent reduction of aliphatic/aromatic ketones and aldehydes. To produce monofunctionalized enzymes we applied the strategy of Expressed Protein Ligation (EPL). Accordingly, we used the IMPACT\u00ae-system and cloned the aldo/keto-reductase as fusion protein with an additional intein/chitin binding domain. Through intein mediated splicing we could produce C-terminal thioester of the AKR1A1. In the next step, the thioester was coupled to a biotin containing peptide by native chemical ligation. This specifically modified enzyme was immobilised on avidin coated surfaces. The attachment on the surface was tested by tryptic digestion, followed by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis",

We have reported solid phase peptide synthesis in water using water-soluble N-protected amino acids, such as 2-[phenyl(methyl)sulfonio]ethoxycarbonyl and 2-(4-sulfophenylsulfonyl)-ethoxycarbonyl amino acids. Following to study on water-soluble N-protected amino acids, we developed a new technology based on nanochemistry for solid phase peptide synthesis in water. The new technology is based on coupling reaction of suspended nanoparticle reactants in water. Fmoc-amino acids are used widely in peptide synthesis, but most of them show poor water-solubility. We prepared well-dispersible Fmoc-amino acid nanoparticles in water by pulverization using a planetary ball mill in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The size of Fmoc-amino acid particles was 300-500 nm. To evaluate the utility of this technique, Leu-enkephalin was prepared using the nanoparticulate Fmoc-amino acids on a PEG-grafted Rink amide resin in water",

Beyermann Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany Chemical ligation allows almost selective modification of unprotected peptides or proteins and thereby offers the opportunity for the synthesis of non-natural constructs (Kent et al. Annu. Rev. Biochem. (2000), 923). Even more selective than chemical may be enzymatic ligations. Sortases are transpeptidases found in Gram-positive bacteria. The Staphylococcus aureus sortase isoform SrtA (sortase A) cleaves proteins at a LPXTG-motif between threonine and glycine, and subsequently transfers the acyl-fragment to a N-terminal oligoglycine. In vivo, this reaction serves for the covalent attachment of proteins to the surface of the bacterium (Mazmanian et al. Science (1999), 760). Recently, sortase-mediated ligation was introduced as a new method for peptide and protein ligation (Mao et al. JACS (2004), 2670).",

To compare the binding mode of agonist and antagonist ligands to the rUT and gain insight into mechanisms responsible for receptor activation, we applied the same experimental strategy to determine contact points of a peptide antagonist. A peptide was prepared containing the N-terminal portion of the human UII sequence (NH2-Glu-Thr-Pro-Asp-) and the C-terminal heptapeptide of antagonistic urantide (Ala-Pen-Phe-DTrp-Orn-Tyr-Cys-Val): [Pen5,D-trp7,Orn8]U-II . This peptide retained high receptor affinity and had antagonistic properties. Based on this, three photolabelling analogues were synthesized with Bpa in positions1, 2 and 6, namely [Bpa1,Pen5,D-trp7,Orn8]U-II, [Bpa2,Pen5,D-trp7,Orn8]U-II and [Pen5,Bpa6,D-trp7,Orn8]U-II. All three peptides bound to the rUT with affinities comparable to U-II and were antagonistic in nature. Photolabelling results indicate that the antagonistic peptides interact with the same receptor residues as the corresponding agonists. This approach has allowed us to demonstrate that agonist and antagonist bind UT with a very similar geometry.

We have established and characterized a novel tetracycline-inducible system in stable mammalian cell lines for the high-level expression of human glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors. This is a strategy frequently used in bacterial expression systems in which membrane proteins are expressed by induction of the desired gene only after the cells have grown to near-maximum density. A gradual loss of high-expressing clones over a given time or severe counter-selection due to the toxicity of the expressed protein in constitutive expression systems are avoided. In addition, these cell lines lack N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I activity and do not allow formation of heterogeneous N-glycans that may complicate crystallization and NMR analysis. Both receptors contain a 9-mer peptide tag (TETSQVAPA) at the C-terminus for affinity chromatography. Initial receptor yields of 0.81 \u00b5g/mg protein for human GLP-1R and 1.27 \u00b5g/mg protein GR can be optimized on a bioreactor.

These enzymes are involved in the selective removal of the initiator N-terminal methionine residue from newly synthesized polypeptide chains. Deletion or complete inhibition of MetAPs in E. coli and S. cerevisiae will lead to slower growth or lethality of the organism. Although there are intensive efforts in searching for new MetAP inhibitors, there are only few inhibitors for type-1 MetAPs, eventhough it is an essential enzyme in bacteria. Clearly, there is a need for potent inhibitors of bacterial and fungal MetAPs for antibiotic applications. We present herein a new class of MetAP inhibitors, pseudopeptides, having two different non-hydrolyzable isostere moieties mimicking the transition-state of peptide hydrolysis by MetAPs. At first, we prepared a series of 20 pseudopeptide inhibitors of a general structure MSta-Xaa, in which each compound contained a statine derivative of methionine (MSta) and a different amino acid (Xaa) attached to the C-terminus of the statine synthon. These compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the type-1 MetAP from E. coli. This step allowed us to select cysteine and valine as the most potent substitutions in the Xaa position. In a second series of inhibitors, we synthesized phosphinic pseudopeptides Met-\u03c8[PO2-CH2]-Gly-Val, Met-\u03c8[PO2-CH2]-Gly-Cys, Met-\u03c8[PO2-CH2]-Ala-Val and Met-\u03c8[PO2-CH2]-Ala-Cys.

Schiller Laboratory of Chemical Biology and Peptide Research,Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada The opioid peptide H-Tyr-c[D-Cys-Phe-Phe-Cys]NH2 cyclized via a methylene dithioether has recently been reported to be a potent and selective \u00b5 opioid agonist [M.J. Przydzial et al., J. Peptide Res. 66, 255-262 (2005)]. In the present study, we synthesized dicarba analogues of this peptide with Tyr or 2',6'dimethyltyrosine (Dmt) in the 1-position. In an effort to develop \u00b5-selective opioid antagonists, dicarba analogues containing 3-(2,6-dimethyl-4hydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid (Dhp) or (2S)-2-methyl-3-(2,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid [(2S)-Mdp] were also prepared. The syntheses were performed on solid-phase by assembly of the linear precursor peptide and subsequent ring-closing metathesis between D-allylglycine and (2S)-2-amino-5hexenoic acid substituted in positions 2 and 5, respectively, using a second generation Grubbs catalyst . After cleavage from the resin the cyclic olefinic peptides were obtained as mixtures of cis and trans isomers and subsequent catalytic hydrogenation yielded the saturated -CH2-CH2-bridged peptides. In vitro opioid activities were determined in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) assays, and in opioid receptor binding assays. Nearly all Tyr-and Dmt cyclic olefinic and saturated peptides showed subnanomolar \u00b5 and \u03b4 agonist potencies in the GPI and MVD assays, and all of them were nonselective. Some of the Dhp-and (2S)-Mdp analogues were quite potent \u00b5 opioid antagonists with Ke values in the 25-40 nM range. Interestingly, all of them were partial or full \u03b4 agonists in the MVD assay and none of them showed \u00b5 vs. \u03b4 receptor binding selectivity. de Chimie, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al 2 Departments of Pediatrics and Ophthalmology and Pharmacology, Research Center of H\u00f4pital Sainte-Justine, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada",

Analogues, containing fatty acid residues were synthesized by solid phase technique and purified by means of SPE and HPLC. It was shown that attachment of palmitic acid significantly increases antitumor activity whereas introduction of lauryl, hexanoyl or pivaloyl moieties produces inactive compounds. This evidence suggests possible apoptosis-inducing role of palmitic acid in agreement with literature data. Subsequent modification of palmitoyl-containing analogues demonstrated the possibility of peptide chain elongation up to twelve amino acid residues without reduction of antitumor activity. Peptide efficiency in vitro can be substantially increased by the incorporation of nuclear localization sequence (NLS). Further biological studies emphasize important role of NLS position in analogue structure. Thus, it was demonstrated that attachment of palmitoyl moiety produce LHRH analogues possessed antitumor action in vitro. These data in conjunction with that for NLS-containing peptides are in favour of supposed apoptosis-inducing activity. M265 TOTAL SYNTHESIS OF NICOTIANAMINE AND OF A NON NATURAL ANALOGUE M.

Department of Pharmacy, University of Patras, Patras, Greece 2 Group of Peptide Biochemistry, Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic Oxytocin (OT) is a hypothalamic cyclic nonapeptide that is released into the general circulation from the posterior lobe of the pituitary. Generally known is its capability of inducing uterine contractions and facilitation of milk ejection during lactation. However widespread distribution of OT receptors in the brain and specific behavioral effects of centrally applied OT have firmly established OT role as a neurotransmitter modulating reproductive and social behaviors. The role of OT in preterm labor led to the search for and design of synthetic peptide antagonists as potential tocolytic agents. Of the many OT antagonists reported to date, only one, Atosiban, has been approved under the trade name Tractocile. The design of new OT antagonists is based on data from structure-activity studies. Antagonistic activity depends on the configuration and the hydrophobicity of the amino acid at position 2. Based on these findings and for investigation of the role of position 3 in biological potency, we synthesized by the Fmoc/But solid phase methodology twelve new analogues of [Mpa1, D-(Et)Tyr2] or [Mpa1, D-Nal(1)2]OT containing L-or D-\u03b1-t-butylglycine [Gly(But)], L-or D-\u03b2-(2-thienyl)-alanine [Thi] and L-or D-3 pyridylalanine (Pya) in position 3. Electro-spray MS was in agreement with the expected results. The analogues were tested for uterotonic activity in the rat uterus in vitro test, for pressor activity in the rat pressor assay and for the affinity to human OT receptor using 3H.OT.

Englert 11 Leibniz Institute of Age Research/Fritz Lipmann Institute 2 Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, GermanyAnimal Eya (Eyes absent) proteins are involved in the regulation of cell differentiation and organ development [1]. Recently, it has been shown that the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal segment of ~271-274 amino acids represents a PTPase catalytic domain (Eya domain). In contrast to classical protein tyrosine phosphatases that contain the signature motif HCXAGXGR(S/T) as indispensable part of the active site, hydrolysis of pY-containing substrates by the Eya domain was shown to be metal-dependent[2]. Here, we investigated the structural requirements of substrates for the Eya homologue in A. thaliana (AtEya) by two different approaches. A peptide derived from Src Y419 was chosen as a template for truncation and amino acid replacement studies. In a second approach we used a combinatorial peptide library containing phosphono methyl phenylalanine as pY-mimetic to screen for binding to the Eya domain. The contribution of individual residues on both sides of pY to binding and catalysis was assessed by kinetic analysis using HPLC and a spectrophotometric assay.[1] Rayapureddi, J.

This peptide is metabolized in the spinal cord, both in vitro and in vivo, to shorter fragments, including OFQ/N(1-11) and OFQ/N(1-6). These fragments are behaviorally active and modulate nociception in a bi-phasic process. In particular, OFQ/N(1-6) shows pronounced analgesia, followed by hyperalgesia. Removal of C-terminalGly completely abolishes peptide activity. In the present work we have synthesized four OFQ/N(1-6) analogues having at the N-terminus all stereoisomers of 4-aminopyroglutamic acid as a replacement for Phe-Gly dipeptide unit. Due to expected importance of Phe side chain for biological activity, benzyl substituent was shifted to the peptide N-terminal amino group. The transformation into such derivative can be performed by reductive alkylation on solid support after finishing elongation of the peptide chain (Szardenings, A.K, Burkoth, T.S., Look, G.C., Campbell, D.A., J.

Goldsworthy 2 1 Department of Chemistry, University of Patras, Patras, Greece 2 Department of Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London, UKLocusta Diuretic Hormone (Locmi-DH) is a neuropeptide that has been isolated from the locust Locusta migratoria. It belongs to the CRF-related diuretic peptides and has the following amino acid sequence: MGMGPSLSIVNPMDVLRQRLLLEIARRRLRDAEEQIKANKDFLQQI-NH2. Locmi-DH stimulates fluid secretion and cAMP production by Malpighian tubules in vitro and it is released into the haemolymph from corpora cardiaca . Structure-activity studieshave shown that the C-terminal fragment Locmi-DH(32-46) is active in the feeding behavioral assay in Locusta migratoria while has very low response in stimulating cAMP production by Malpighian tubulus from Schistocerca gregaria [1]. In the present work we synthesized the C-terminal analogues Locmi-DH(34-46), Locmi-DH(36-46) and Locmi-DH(38-46) in order to determine whether the C-terminal fragment Locmi-DH(32-46) can be further truncated Nterminally with loss of its effects on feeding behavior in locust. We also synthesized the N-terminal fragments analogues [Hse(Me)1,3,13]-Locmi-DH(1-30), [Hse(Me)1,3,13]-Locmi-DH(1-30)-OH and [Hse(Me)13]-Locmi-DH(6-30)-OH to study the role of the N-terminal part of Locmi-DH on biological activity. The synthesis of the peptides was performed in solid phase on the 2-Chlorotrityl chloride Resin using either stepwise or fragment condesation strategy and the Fmoc/Bu-t methodology.

We performed the synthesis of Neb-collostatin and its 29 analogues. Two analogues were modified in position 13 by Ala or D-Pro and other were oligopeptides with a shortened peptide sequence such as[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]-, [14-19]-, [15-19]-, [16-19]-, [13-19]-, [12-19]-, [11-19]-, [10-19]-, [9-19]-, [8-19]-, [7-19]-, [6-19]-, [5-19]-,[4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]-, collostatin.

Lett. 1995, 2, 313 The octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), increases [Ca2+]i in cultured rat astrocytes through activation of a GPCR coupled to PLC. The action of ODN on [Ca2+]i is mimicked by the C-terminal octapeptide RPGLLDLK (OP), partially antagonized (-40%) by the linear analog [DLeu5]OP and totally suppressed by the cyclic analog cyclo[DLeu5]OP. In vivo, ODN and OP inhibit food intake and their anorexigenic effect is blocked by cyclo[DLeu5]OP. Silaproline (Sip) is a silylated proline-surrogate which influences both the physicochemical and pharmacodynamic properties of peptides without affecting their native 3Dstructure. The aim of this study was to substitute the Pro2 residue of OP and [DLeu5]OP, that is involved in the bioactive conformation of these peptides, by Sip and to evaluate the Ca2+-mobilizing activity of [Sip2]OP and [Sip2,DLeu5]OP in astrocytes. Application of [Sip2]OP provoked a transient increase in [Ca2+]i with an amplitude significantly higher than that induced by ODN. Repeated pulses of [Sip2]OP resulted in sequential increases with gradual attenuation of the response. Preincubation of astrocytes with cyclo[DLeu5]OP partially abolished the effect of [Sip2]OP. [Sip2,DLeu5]OP did not affect the basal [Ca2+]i, but reduced by 37% the ODN-evoked [Ca2+]i increase. In conclusion, these data indicate that the substitution of Pro2 by Sip enhances the efficacy of OP but does not affect the antagonistic properties of [DLeu5]OP. Owing to their better stability and enhanced hydrophobicity, silylated ODN analogs may cross more easily the blood-brain barrier and thus may prove useful for the development of novel appetite-regulating drugs.

            "text": "26RFa, a novel neuropeptide of the RFamide superfamily characterized in our laboratory, is the endogenous ligand of the orphan receptor GPR103. Consistant with the hypothalamic expression of the peptide and its receptor, icv injection of 26RFa induces a potent orexigenic effect in mouse. Recently, it has been shown that GPR103-deficient mice exhibit a kyphotic hump and suffer from osteopenia. Analysis of the human 26RFa (h26RFa) precursor indicates that it may generate several additionnal RFa-peptides including an N-terminal extended form (43RFa), a truncated form (26RFa(20-26)) and a 9-amino acid peptide located upstream of 43RFa (9RFa). Molecular modeling under 1H-NMR constraints of h26RFa shows that the N-terminal part encompasses an -helix. The aim of this work was to study the Ca2+-mobilizing activity of human and rodent 26RFa-relatedpeptides in a CHO cell line over-expressing the human GPR103. Human and rodent 26RFa and 43RFa induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i with nanomolar potencies. Conversely, 26RFa(20-26) and 9RFa were about 400 times less potent than 26RFa, suggesting that these peptides are not endogenous ligands of GPR103. Despite their well-defined conformation within the native peptide, the human and rodent N-terminal fragments were devoid of agonistic and antagonistic activities indicating that the C-terminal part is of paramount importance for receptor activation. These data constitute the first step toward the development of new GPR103-analogs that could prove useful for the treatment of feeding or bone disorders.

All the peptides were tested for their in vitro pressor, antidiuretic and uterotonic activities. The substitution of position 2 with 2-aminoindane-2-carboxylic acid, compared to the previously studied modification using 1-aminocyclopentane-1carboxylic acid (Apc), did not result in any dramatic change of activity. The enlargement of the cyclic side chain moiety, restoring its aromatic character from the aliphatic one, however placing the aromatic ring closer to the backbone led either to retention or a slight decrease of antidiuretic activity. All the analogues had prolonged action. One of the new peptides, namely [Mpa1, Aic2, Val4] AVP, exhibits an antidiuretic activity similar to that of dDAVP, thus being one of the most potent V2 agonists reported to date. The remaining five new peptides substituted at position 3 are moderately potent antidiuretic agents with prolonged activities. These analogues also exhibit different range of antioxytocin activity which is enhanced as compared to that of the Apc analogues. Summing up, our studies provide new useful information about structure -activity relationships and open new possibilities for designing potent V2 agonists.",

The proposed epitopes were determined by combining three different computational methods including the binding motifs of Taylor, the TEPITOPE software and the MULTIPRED program. MD simulations at 300K of 150ps duration were carried out for the six modeled HLA-DQ7-epitope complexes and compared with the crystal structure of HLA-DQ8-insulin-B peptide complex used as template. A gross overview of the MD simulations is provided by the root mean square deviation (rmsd) plots. The rms deviations were computed only for the C\u03b1 atoms of the complexes as a function of time. The potential energy of interaction, \u2206\u0395int, between the modeled HLA-DQ7 and each one of the potential T cell epitopes, the variations of the solvent accessible surface areas (SASA) of the predicted epitopes during the MD simulations within the binding groove of DQ7 and the free energy of binding \u2206Gbind of the complexes were also calculated. The proposed T cell epitopes, classified according to their binding efficiency, could act as immunotherapeutic drug-like molecules.Tu344 EXAMINATION OF THE MD TRAJECTORY OF THE OPENING OF THE NF-KB USING PFA B.

The main goals of this study is to explore the influence of a) the (S,S)-CXC-cyclic motif and b) the charge-charge interactions to the relative orientation of the X and X-2 or X+2 amino acid residue side chains. Our findings indicate that independently of the nature of the X residue, there is a preference for an almost cis coplanar orientation of the X and either one of the adjacent to cysteine residue side chains. The conformation of the X residue is constrained inthe region (-80o, 60o)for the \u03a6 and \u03a8 backbone dihedral angles. We did not observed any b-turn conformation neither in linear nor in cyclic peptides. It is concluded that the (S,S)-CXC-motif can be incorporated in peptide analogues in which the cis coplanar orientation of the corresponding amino acid side chains is desirable.

These latter compounds are potentially useful for the construction of new molecular receptors and supramolecular devices. We have previously shown that peptides based on L-Mdp[CROWN] residues derived from C\u03b1-methyl-L-DOPA (Mdp) with [CROWN]= [15-C-5], [18-C-6] and [Benzo-24-C-8], have a strong propensity for folded/helical secondary structures. To the same end, peptides based on the more rigid, cyclic, Bip[20-C-6] residue have been investigated in our groups. We recently envisioned that introduction of a binaphthyl unit as a part of the crown moiety would impart supplementary structural and chiral recognition properties to these receptors. We report here the synthesis of the terminally protected amino acids Z-L-Mdp[(S)-Binol-20-C-6]-OMe and Boc-(R)-Bip[(S)-Binol-22-C-6]-OMe. Peptides based on these new amino acids, combined with Aib and/or L-Ala residues to the hexamer level, with two crowned residues at the i and i+3 positions of the main chain, were also prepared by solution methods. Their conformational analysis was performed using FT-IR absorption and 1H NMR techniques.

Kirschbaum Interdisciplinary Research Center, Department of Food Sciences, University of Giessen, Germany In analogy to the proteome and proteomics we define the peptaibiome as the entirety of fungal peptides containing the characteristic non-protein amino acid Aib. Accordingly, peptaibiomics is the analytical methodology for the structural characterization of all peptaibiotics expressed in cells of filamentous fungi. A peptaibiotic is defined as fungal peptide containing Aib and exhibiting antibiotic or other bioactivities. Peptides of this group consist of mixtures of 5 to 20residue peptides. We present a rapid and sensitive method for the detection and structural characterization of the peptaibiome expressed by fungal multienzyme complexes. The method comprises growth of fungi on Petri agar dishes and solid-phase extraction of mycelia followed by HPLC-ES-MS. Characteristic fragment ions and search in data bases enable detection of new and matching with known peptaibiotics.

In gram-negative bacteria N-acylhomoserinelactones (AHLs) are utilized, for gram-positive bacteria post-translationally modified peptides were observed as signal molecules. Synthesis and modification of those molecules, especially of AHLs was done to investigate the function of their receptor proteins and the following protein-DNA interaction. For this purpose the modifications should not harm the biological activity but offer the opportunity to introduce reporter groups. Starting with L-methionine as a chiral substrate cis and trans-3-hydroxy-L-homoserine lactone was synthesized. After acylation of the amino function with fatty acids full activity was maintained, which could be proofed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Further modifications of the hydroxyl group are done to introduce a spacer unit. If the bioactivity is still conserved a functionalized AHL can be designed.

STR\u00d8MGAARDDepartment of Medicinal Chemistry, The Danish University of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Copenhagen \u00d8, Denmarkalpha-Conotoxins isolated from the venom of carnivorous marine snails are highly potent and selective inhibitors for different subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). They contain two disulfide bonds which gives rise to two loops of intervening amino acids, with a single conserved proline residue in loop 1 that contributes to a very rigid and well defined 3D-structure. Acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) shares sequence homolgy with the ligand binding domain of nAChRs and provides a valuable tool for the rational design and synthesis of novel alpha-conotoxin analogues. Recent crystal structures of alpha-conotoxins ImI and PnIA complexed with AChBP shows that upon ligand binding the conserved proline in loop 1 is brought into close proximity to a hydrophobic binding pocket consisting of three aromatic residues. Therefore substituting the 4-position of the conserved proline with various substituents may lead to the development of potent new nAChR ligands with novel pharmacological properties, without compromising the native conformation. We have synthesised a series of analogues of alpha-conotoxins ImI, AuIB and GID, with hydroxyl, phenyl, guanidino, amino, tertiary amino and quaternary-amino substituents on the 4-cis and -trans positions of proline. The peptides were assembled in parallel using Fmoc-solid phase peptide synthesis and the correct disulfide bond isomers formed by air mediated oxidation in aqueous buffer following cleavage from the resin with TFA. The compounds were investigated at various subtypes of nAChRs and were found to possess unique pharmacologies.Th414 RETROINVERSO PEPTIDES INHIBIT AMYLOID NEUROTOXIOCITY AND ARE POTENTIAL THERAPEUTICS AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE B.M.

Gunasekera Department of Basic Medical Sciences, St. George's University, London, UK We have synthesised retroinverso (RI) forms of sequences from the central portion (residues 16-21) of beta-amyloid, the prime causative agent in Alzheimer's disease. The RI peptides are more active than the native sequences at inhibiting aggregation and fibrilisation of beta-amyloid 40 and 42. The peptides are highly active in preventing aggregation of beta-amyloid, and preventing neurotoxicity in human neuronal cell lines. and in view of their in vivo stability, have good prospect as therapeutic agents.

Sakarellos-Daitsiotis, S. Zikou, P. Mastora, A.-I. Koukou, C. Drainas, E. Panou-Pomonis, C. Sakarellos Department of Chemistry, University, Ioannina, Greece The widespread use of antibiotics led to the development of multi-resistant bacteria, resulting in an urgent need for antibiotics with a new mode of action. Cationic antimicrobial peptides are a class of positively charged peptides, with amphipathic helical conformation and a substantial portion of hydrophobicity. In the present study, amphipathic helical peptides of various chain-length incorporating Aib, an enzymatically resistant aminoacid, positively charged Arg and hydrophobic Leu, Ac-(Aib-Arg-Aib-Leu)n-NH2 (n=1-4), were synthesized in order to develop new antibiotics. Synthesis was performed by the conventional stepwise Fmoc/tBu solid-phase method and the peptides were purified by HPLC and identified by ESI-MS. The above peptides, as well as the helical sequential polypeptides (Arg-X-Gly)n, (where X represents amino acid residues Ala, Val, and Leu) were tested for their antimicrobial activity against gram(-) bacteria, E.coliDH5a, P.aeruginosa, Z.mobilis 10988, C.parapsilosis and gram(+), M.smegmatis mc2155 and B.subtilis. Experiments for hemolytic activity and proteolytic stability were performed. Conformational properties of the peptides were evaluated by CD spectroscopy. Department 2 A.N.

They were separated and their antiulcer activity was studied. Thirty individual peptides with molecular masses of 174-420 Da were isolated from the PHC by HPLC. The PHC was shown to predominantly contain 2-to 4-aa peptides, including PG, GP, and PGP. Experiments on rats demonstrated that, on intragastric administration at a dose of 1 mg/kg, PHC enhances the stability of the gastric mucosa to the action of ulcerogenic factors, such as ethanol and stress and exhibits a protecting antiulcer effect. Even a lesser dose (0.1 mg/kg), which reduced ulcer area twofold, was effective in the stress model of ulcer. The intraperitoneal and intragastric administration of PHC at a dose of 1 mg/kg was found to exhibit a therapeutic effect in the acetate model of ulcer formation. Thus, we have found that PHC is effective in all the models of ulcer formation and induces the normalization of the parameters of stomach homeostasis.

Dis., LUMC, Leiden, The NetherlandsBackground: Invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients are associated with mortality and morbidity rates. Despite the introduction of new antifungals, these infections represent a significant challenge to medicine. Here, we investigated whether human lactoferrin-derived peptide hLF(1-11) displays antifungal activity against disseminated Candida albicans infection. Methods: Neutropenic mice were intravenously infected with C. albicans and 20 h thereafter injected with various amounts of hLF(1-11). 24 h after injection of the peptide, number of viable yeasts in the kidneys were determined microbiologically and the size and number of infectious foci was quantified through histological examination. In addition, serum cytokine levels were measured. Results: Results revealed a U-shaped dose-effect curve for the antifungal action ofhLF(1-11). Effective doses of the peptide (0.04-0.4 \u00b5g/kg) were accompanied by reduced TNF-and IL-6 serum levels as compared to untreated infected mice whereas the poor antifungal activity of high doses of this peptide (400-40,000 \u00b5g/kg) coincided with high levels of circulating IL-10. Histological analysis of the number and size of infectious foci in kidney tissue sections confirmed our microbiological data. Effectively treated mice displayed infectious foci containing blastoconidia, whereas in untreated and sub optimally treated mice such foci contained mainly filamentous forms. In agreement with this observation, in vitro hLF(1-11) dose-dependently inhibited the transistion from blastoconidious to filamentous C. albicans.Conclusions: hLF(1-11)is effective against disseminated C. albicans infections. Clinical safety studies have been completed successfully and clinical phase II studies comprising hematopoetic stem cell transplantation patients are currently ongoing.

The study of receptor specificity and biological activity of IMC revealed its high affinity binding to corticotropin receptors on synaptic membranes in the mouse brain and on various immunocompetent cells in human and mouse, as well as the activation of adenylate cyclase in the target cells. In this study we investigated the effects of IMC on the level of 11-oxycorticosteroids (CS) in rat adrenal glands and plasma in vivo, and the binding of [3H]IMC to rat adrenal cortex membranes in vitro. Intramuscular injection of IMC at doses of 10-100 microg/kg was found to stimulate the secretion of CS from the adrenals to the bloodstream. Assuming that the effects of IMC on adrenal cortex cells are mediated by corticotropin receptors, we have prepared [3H]IMC and investigated its receptor binding characteristics. Receptor binding studies revealed that [3H]IMC bound with high affinity and specificity to corticotropin receptor on rat adrenal cortex membranes (Kd = 2.1 nM) and these receptors may mediate the effects of IMC on the CS secretion. IMC at concentrations of 10 -1000 n\u041c was found to increase the adenylate cyclase activity in adrenal cortex membranes. Thus, IMC interaction with immunocompetent cells, brain synaptic membranes and adrenal cortex membranes includes the following main steps: binding to the corticotropin receptor, activation of adenylate cyclase, and elevation of the intracellular cAMP content.Laboratory of Peptide Biosignal Engineering, Mitsubishi Kagaku Institute of Life Sciences, Machida, Tokyo 2 Department Od Applied Biochemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Tokai University, Hiratsuka, Kanagawa 3 Department of Biochemical and Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Gunma University, Kiryu, Gunma, Japan",

Hong AnaSpec Inc., San Jose, CA, USA Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in the degradation of components of extracellular matrix and play an important role in apoptosis, embryogenesis, reproduction tissue remodeling and repair. The development of agonists or inhibitors in controlling MMP activity continues to be of great interest for drug discovery and life science research. FRET peptide-based MMP assays have been widely used for measuring MMP activity. However, most of these FRET peptides use Mca/Dnp or Edans/Dabcyl pairs, which have relatively weak fluorescence signals with short wavelengths. We designed and synthesized sixteen MMP substrates that are incorporated with 5-FAM (donor) and QXL 520TM (quencher) by Fmoc solid phase synthesis method. QXL520TM is proven to be the most effective quencher for fluoresceins such as FAM and FITC. The new 5-FAM/QXL520TM FRET peptides offer the following advantages: a) the peptides are more readily adapted to high throughput screening since this pair is less interfered by autofluorescence of test compounds and cellular components with lower background. b) 5-FAM has stronger absorption and fluorescent signals with longer absorption and emission wavelengths (Ex/Em = 490nm/520nm) than Mca and Edans. c) QXL520TM is more water-soluble than Dabcyl and Dnp, which alleviates the problem caused by the hydrophobic nature of Dabcyl or Dnp. These peptides were screened by MMPs. Each of these peptides was found to be cleaved by certain MMPs. The peptide, QXL520TM-g-Abu-Pro-Cha-Abu-Smc-His-Ala-Dab(5-FAM)-Ala-Lys-NH2, showed the highest proteolytic kinetics to all the tested MMPs. Submicromolar of this peptide is adequate to detect picomolar level of MMPs.M259 NOVEL THIO-DERIVATIVE OF PHENYLNORSTATINE AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE BACE1 INHIBITORS DESIGN Z. Ziora, S. Kasai, K.

The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is noted as one of common techniques for diagnosis of cancers. In particular, MRI based on the measurement of 19F atom is becoming a remarkable one.To develop the practical materials utilizing not only for the 10B carrier but also MRI probe, we had already reported the syntheses of compounds containing both 10B and 19F atoms in a single molecule such as DL--In the present paper we report the biological activities of fluorinated p-boronophenylalanine derivatives 3 ~ 6, and 19F NMR measurements of these compounds as well.[1] Kato, I., et al., (2004) Appl.

The program of studies of biological properties of the heptapeptide included the investigation of its binding to IgE contained in standard solutions and in patients' blood serum. The binding of RNWDVYK with IgE was investigated by the IFA method using the IgE antibodies labelled with horse-radish peroxidase (HRPO). We determined the optimum sorption concentration of the peptide in this experimental immunoenzyme system to be 100 mkg/ml. The ability of synthetic RNWDVYK peptides to bind with IgE was studied as a function of IgE concentration in standard serum (0.47 to 60 ng/ml IgE). A high correlation was found between the IgE concentration and the optical density of the solution after introducing monoclonal antibodies labeled with HRPO and the substrate chromogenic mixture (r=0.99). Similar investigations were conducted using the allergy patients' blood serum. The serum with a known concentration of IgE was added to immunological plotting boards with sorbed synthetic RNWDVYK peptides. A high correlation was also found between the concentration of IgE in the patients' blood serum and the optical density of the solution after introducing monoclonal antibodies labelled with HRPO and substrate chromogenic mixture (r=0.94). Our experiments showed the high IgE binding activity of synthetic RNWDVYK peptides. We demonstrated the possibility of construction of diagnostic systems for the quantitative determination of IgE and IgE-antibodies.",

In addition to trimeric dUTPase core, the protein possesses flexible N-and C-termini consisting of the nucleocapsid segment, and a peptide motif conserved in dUTPases. To analyze the function of the flexible Cterminal peptide segment, reconstitution experiments were designed with truncated enzyme lacking the C-terminal 14mer oligopeptide and the synthetic oligopeptide prepared on Rink-amid resin by solid-phase peptide synthesis, using Fmoc strategy. The truncated enzyme proved to be practically inactive. Addition of the synthetic 14mer (PYRGQGSFGSSDIY) at 100fold molar excess resulted in partial complamentation of the catalytic activity (to 10% of original). A mixture of the truncated enzyme and the 14mer oligopeptide (this latter at 100fold excess) was put to crystallization trials. We conclude that the C-terminal 14mer is essential for catalytic activity. Antifolate drugs are inhibitors directed to interfere with folate metabolic pathway. Methotrexate (MTX) and pemetrexed (Alimta\u00ae) are known folic acid analogues used in cancer treatment. Different peptide conjugates of MTX have been prepared for intracellular delivery. (1) In octaarginine conjugates one of the carboxylic groups of MTX was attached to the N-terminal of the peptides. (2) However, as results showed, that both carboxylic groups are required to the biological effect of MTX. Therefore we decided to synthesize peptide conjugates of folic acid analogues in which the carboxylic groups are untouched. Octaarginine, penetratin and a cyclic peptide CGNKRTRGC, which can deliver a cargo molecule in the lymphoid system, were used as delivery peptides. We introduced squaric acid or aminoxy acetic acid as linker moiety between the peptides and cargo molecules. The conjugation was monitored by RP-HPLC, the crude products were purified by RP-HPLC and were identified by mass spectrometry. The biological activity of the conjugates was evaluated in vitro on sensitive and resistant human leukemia (HL-60) cell lines. Besides its endocrine activity, TRH (the tripeptide pGlu-His-Pro-NH<sub>2</sub>) has also been long recognized as a modulatory neuropeptide with broad range of physiological and pharmacological activities in the central nervous system (CNS). Although numerous centrally active and metabolically stable analogues and peptidomimetics have been synthesized using TRH as a template, selectivity of their CNS action has remained an issue to be addressed. We aimed at discovering novel analogues with enhanced CNS-selectivity by incorporating pyridinium building blocks. The design also allowed for enhancing transport across the blood-brain-barrier and increasing residence time in the CNS through prodrug strategy. Solid-phase chemistry was used to prepare the analogues and novel methods previously not used to incorporate pyridinium moieties into resin-bound peptides such as the Zincke reaction were also introduced. Comprehensive evaluation included measurement of affinity to TRH-receptor, acetylcholine-releasing, analeptic and antidepressant-like activity in animal models, as well as prediction of membrane affinity, determination of in vitro metabolic stability, and pharmacokinetics and brain uptake/retention studies that employed in vivo microdialysis sampling. A strong connection between acetylcholine-releasing potency and analeptic effect in animals was obtained for close analogues of TRH, while pyridinium compounds designed from the structurally related pGlu-Glu-Pro-NH<sub>2</sub> maintained the antidepressant-like effect of the parent peptide, while showing significant decrease in analeptic action.In conclusion, an increase in the selectivity of CNS-activity profile was obtained by the incorporation of pyridinium moieties. We have also demonstrated the benefits of the prodrug approach on the pharmacokinetics, brain uptake and retention of the analogues upon systemic administration. The use of small radiolabelled compounds such as peptides is a very attractive tool for the diagnosis of several different pathologies, specially cancer, through the use of nuclear medicine techniques.1 Among the various membrane receptors, the two cholecystokinin receptors CCKA-R and CCKB-R are very promising biological targets for radiolabelled compounds due to their overexpression in many tumours2. In order to develop radiolabelled peptide derivatives able to target these receptors, the binding mode of the C-terminal cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8), toward the two cholecystokinin receptors CCKA-R and CCKB-R has been, recently, structurally characterized. 3 The structural data suggest that modifications on the N-terminal end of CCK8 obtained by introducing chelating agents and their metal complexes should not affect the interaction of the derivatized CCK8 peptides with both CCKA-R and CCKB-R.",

            "text": "Various combinations of pore size and chemistry of silica-based materials were investigated for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of peptide separation. Incorrect pore size and ligands have been suggested to cause peak broadening, poor resolution and poor recovery. Our study suggests that an appropriate combination of pore sizes and ligands is necessary to obtain the most efficient usage of reversed-phase HPLC columns according to the molecular weights of peptides and proteins. We will also show the possibilities of an improved method development for the separation of complex peptide mixture by pH or additives.The development of new biopolymer materials as drug delivery systems is of enormous interest on biomedicine. Dendrimers are polymers with particular properties; they are highly branched polymers with well-defined chemical composition, and show compact globular shape, monodisperse size and controllable surface functionalities. Peptide dendrimers incorporates amino acids in their structures and have additional features such as biocompatibility and biodegradability.In previous studies we described the solid-phase synthesis of a new class of polyproline-based dendrimers. These biopolymers have the capacity to cross the mammalian cell membrane and moderate toxicity. These promising results open up the possibility to explore these dendrimers as delivery systems.To design more versatile polyproline dendrimers, we have developed a methodology that involves the combination of solid-phase and solution strategies. Diverse multivalent PEG-and proline-based cores were synthesized to attain dendrimers with distinct topologies. Dendrimers were synthesized by iterative building block addition [(GlyPro5)2ImdOH], around an inner core, using a peptide solution convergent approach. A variety of coupling methodologies and protecting groups for the N-terminal function were explored. The novel high throughput protein detection system using designed peptide arrays has been successfully indicated on their capabilities as the \"protein-chip\" [1] [2] [3] [4] . Our concept has many advantages especially for high-quality industrial production and practical applications compared to arrays with antibodies or recombinant proteins. The deposited peptide solution can be dried without covalent immobilization, although, when the resulted arrays are exposed in protein-solution they showed planned conformation [5] . Based on these basic results, several hundreds of \u03b1-helical, \u03b2-loop and \u03b2-sheet peptides, which involved a cysteinyl residue for covalent immobilization and TAMRA as a fluorescent label, were successfully synthesized, characterized and used as capture molecules. A novel material for chips made from amorphous carbon suitable for our concept has been developed, which has significant advantages over conventional glass or polymer plates, such as no selffluorescence, mechanically more stable, easy manufacturing in the aspects of precised and high throughput processing. Thus, chip-plate with nano-L wells could also be easily manufactured. Peptides were deposited on these chips surface covalently as well as non-covalently in 350 picoL/spot (diameter: ca 200 \u00b5m). The resulted chips were used for protein detection. A part of this work was funded by the Okinawa-Bio-Project and NEDO-Grant.",
