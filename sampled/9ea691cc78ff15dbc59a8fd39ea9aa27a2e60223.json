Patients with severe hepatitis have impaired immunity and are therefore vulnerable to all kinds of infections. After infection, these patients may experience shock, DIC and multiple organ failure, all of which seriously affect their prognosis and are major causes of death. Concurrent infections consist primarily of infections of the lungs, intestines, biliary tract, and urinary tract, as well as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and sepsis.",

Severe hepatitis may reduce the synthesis of coagulation factors and enhance their dysfunction and increase anticoagulants and platelet abnormalities, leading to coagulopathy. Infection, hepatorenal syndrome and complications can further aggravate coagulopathy, resulting in DIC and seriously affecting patient prognosis. 3. Hepatorenal syndrome, which is characterized by renal failure, hemodynamic changes in arterial circulation and abnormalities in the endogenous vascular system, is a common clinical complication of end-stage liver disease, and one of the important indicators for the prognosis of patients with severe hepatitis. 4. Water electrolyte disorder (water retention, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hyperkalaemia) and acid-base imbalance are common in patients with severe hepatitis. These internal environment disorders can lead to exacerbation and complication of the illness. 5. Hepatic encephalopathy is a neurological and psychiatric anomaly syndrome based on metabolic disorder, and an important prognostic indicator for patients with severe hepatitis. 6. The hepatopulmonary syndrome is an important vascular complication in lungs due to systemic hypoxemia in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The majority of patients with HPS are asymptomatic. Long-term oxygen therapy remains the most frequently recommended therapy for symptoms in patients with severe hypoxemia. 7. Endotoxemia, an important complication of severe hepatitis, is not only a second hit to the liver, but also leads to other complications including SIRS and MODS.",

The main cellular components of the innate immune system within the liver are the Kupffer cells. Kupffer cells represent 80-90% of the tissue macrophages in the human body [4] . In normal condition, Kupffer cells in liver help to clear the macromolecular substance such as pathogen, endotoxin, heteroantigen and immune complex to defense infection. In severe hepatitis, due to massive hepatocytes necrosis, the number and function of monocytes/macrophages are impaired, thus the activity of fibronectin, which is opsonin of macrophages, is decreased. Therefore, bacterium, endotoxin and other poison from gut directly access into circulation. Subrat Kumar Acharya from India reported that the plasma fibronectin (FN) level in severe hepatitis patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls (85.6 \u03bcg/mL \u00b1 75.8 \u03bcg/mL, vs. 295.5 \u03bcg/ mL \u00b1 88.5 \u03bcg/mL).

Report from Wyke showed that the defect of complement closely correlated with impaired opsonization [7] . Defect of C3 or C5 can result to weakened movement of polymorphonuclear leucocyte. In severe hepatitis, the ability of liver to produce complement has been weakened due to massive injury of parenchymal hepatic cells, which leads to decreased activity of complement to 40% of normal condition. Meanwhile, serum opsonization to E. coli or saccharomycetes are also diminished. Besides, high ammonia level in severe hepatitis also restrains complement activity to impact germicidal effect.",

Intrahepatic cholestasis positively correlated with endotoxin levels. Endotoxin can trigger hepatorenal syndrome. For kidney, endotoxin is a potent renal vasoconstrictor substance, which can make a strong contraction of the renal artery and renal blood flow reduction. In addition, endotoxin can cause kidney capillary thrombosis and acute renal tubular necrosis, or even renal cortex necrosis. Endotoxin can activate coagulation factor VII and factor VI, making the intrinsic coagulation system startup, as well as directly damage hepatocytes which release tissue thromboplastin to start the extrinsic coagulation system.

Overuptake of water and electrolyte and retention in intestine makes watery stool, which is called \"secretory diarrhea.\" Secretory diarrhea is exhibited as frequent, large amount stool with no pus, usually without pain or tenesmus. It is often accompanied by vomiting, which is prone to bring out dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and acidosis, but less severe systemic toxic symptoms. Stool examinations show less erythrocytes or leukocytes. Invasive bacterial enteritis refers to pathogenic bacteria adhere and invade the intestinal mucosa and submucosa, causing significant inflammation. Different pathogens violate different parts of intestine, small intestine, or colon, and sometimes cause inflammation both of small intestine and colon. The basic clinical manifestations include obvious systemic sepsis, high fever, and even septic shock in severe patients. Stool can be mucus bloody or purulent, less amount and more frequency. Abdominal pain are often severe, paroxysmal colic. If the lesion invades the rectum and distal colon in particular, there may be tenesmus. Sigmoidoscopy examination showed diffuse inflammation and ulceration. If only the small intestine or upper part of colon are invaded, the stool is more moisture, and without tenesmus. Stool examination show large amount of leukocytes.",

And then rashes and herpes break out, chaining into a strip, which distribute in denomination or trunk, unilateral, with duration of about three weeks or several months.

The two pathways reach a confluence at the points of factor Xa and Va. Wherein Factor Xa activates prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of Ca 2+ and factor Va bound to membrane surfaces, and then thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin. Thus, blood becomes clotted and the \"Y\" shaped pathway was established [61] . Simultaneously, there are some anticoagulation systems existing in our body, which prevents the formation of thrombus, then keeps normal circulating of blood flow. It also participates in maintaining of normal permeability of the blood vessel [62] . Among anticoagulation systems, the most important one is the fibrinolytic system, whose basic process can divided into two stages, i.e. plasminogen activation and fibrin degradation [63] . Plasminogen activators include tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and the principal function of these two plasminogen activators is to convert plasminogen to plasmin, then plasmin cleaves fibrin into soluble small peptides, namely fibrin degradation products [64] . Moreover, the process of fibrinolysis was affected by fibrinolysis inhibitors, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) and alpha2antiplasmin (\u03b12-AP). Those fibrinolysis inhibitors can either inhibit plasminogen activation, or reduce the function of plasmin [65] . Thus, there is a dynamic balance between coagulation and anti-coagulation systems under physiological conditions ( Fig. 2 .1) [66] . Many factors involved in coagulation process, i.e. clotting factors, thrombin inhibitor, fibrinolytic system and so on, are synthesized almost exclusively in the liver. Thus, liver plays a pivotal role in remaining the balance between hemorrhage and coagulation under physiological conditions (Table. 2.1) [67] . It is the important basis for pathogenesis of coagulopathy that massive hepatocyte necrosis occurs in severe hepatitis patients, resulting in reduced production and dysfunction of those blood clotting factors [68] .",

            "text": "Coagulation abnormalities, such as decreased production and dysfunction of coagulation factors, are commonly found in severe hepatitis, There are at least 14 types of factors participated in the coagulation process, including 12 classical coagulation factors, namely factor I/fibrinogen, factor II/prothrombin, factor III/tissue factor, factor IV/Calcium ions, as well as factor V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and factor XIII. Some bradykinin factors, such as RK (prekallikrein) and HMWK (high molecular weight kininogen) are also associated with coagulation. Among above factors, the others belong to proteins excepting factor IV. Plasma coagulation factors are synthesized exclusively in the liver, excepting factor III/tissue factor, factor IV, factor VI/activated factor V, factor VIII and factor VIIIa [69] . Massive hepatic necrosis leads to the decreased production of clotting factor in patients with severe chronic hepatitis. Moreover, the coagulation factors are sensitive indicators for clinical evaluation of severe hepatitis. It is common that the serum levels of factor V, VII, IX, X, XI and prothrombin decreased in the patients with severe hepatitis. On the contrary, clotting factor VIII is synthesized, and then excreted increasingly by the mononuclear phagocytic cells with stimulation of various inflammatory cytokines in the patients with severe hepatitis [70] . Anorexia and antibiotics overuse lead to obstacles in assimilation, absorption, and application of vitamin K in these patients. Vitamin K dependent coagulation factors includes factor II, VII, IX, and X. The function of \u03b3-hydroxylation was weaken by the deficiency of vitamin K and damage of hydroxylase, then the abnormal clotting factors without \u03b3-hydroxy glutamate were synthesized. Finally, these abnormal clotting factors lead to dysfunction of the Vitamin K dependent coagulation factors [71] . Coagulation factor VII eliminated significantly in the initial stage of liver injury was usually used as an early diagnosis index [72] . In addition, coagulation factors II and X, then factor IX decreased markedly, along with exacerbation of liver injury. The deficiency of Vitamin K induced by obstructive jaundice, malabsorption syndrome, can be rescued after intravenous injection of vitamin K, which is different from coagulopathy caused by liver injury. The plasma level of fibrinogen is within normal range in patients with compensatory cirrhosis. However, patients with severe hepatitis or liver failure have a significant reduction in the level of fibrinogen, and then develop dysfibrinogenemia [73] . Fibrinogen, as the main hydrolysis substrate of thrombin, is the crucial factor in the coagulation process. Thus, decreased levels or abnormal structure of fibrinogen leads to coagulation abnormalities in patients with severe hepatitis [74] . There are two clotting factors associated with thrombin except for fibrinogen, i.e. Factor V and factor XIII. Factor XIII induce a crosslink of SFM (soluble fibrin monomer), resulting in the formation of insoluble fibrin [75] . It reports that the levels of circulating coagulation factor XIII were decreased in 30% of patients with liver disease, resulting in fibrin decline or abnormality. These patients with liver disease will receive a bad prognosis if the plasma level of fibrin was at level below 35% of normal concentration [76] . It is uncommon that the plasma level of plasma factor V decreased markedly in patients with severe hepatitis, except for those complicated with DIC or hyperfibrinolysis. The low level of factor V cannot induce the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, which delay the activation of prothrombin [77] . Contact factors include classical coagulation factor XII and XI, as well as some bradykinin factors, i.e. PK and HMWK. These factors contact with vascular intima damage or abnormal surface in blood vessel walls, then active the intrinsic coagulation pathway [78] . Moreover, the contact factors can connect with bradykinin, fibrinolysis and complement system. In addition, coagulation factor XIII also activates fibrinolysis system as the initiating factor. Factor XII deficiency does not cause excess bleeding, but induce thrombus due to its decreasing activation of fibrinolytic system [79] .",

Various platelet factors were released from \u03b1-granule after platelet aggregating, and then hemostyptic fibre was produced increasingly. Those hemostyptic fibre finally produced blood clot formation after capturing the other hemocytes. Thus, platelet plugs would progress independently of platelet disintegrating gradually [99] .",

When severe hepatitis occur, myelosuppression, decreased megacaryocyte replication leading short-life platelet, lacking of hemopoietic material such as Vitamin B, folate and so on, all of these can initiate thrombocytopenia [101] . Other reasons leading to thrombocytopenia contain low expression and metabolic disturbance of thrombopoietin (TPO), as well as platelet antibody production. Researches show that the serum level of TPO related positively to platelet expression [102] . We next studied platelet associated immunoglobulin (PAIg) and its sorts such as PAIgG, PAIgA, PAIgM etc., with chronic hepatitis. In line with previous reports, we found that serum levels of PAIg and PAIgG negatively correlated with blood platelet count, corroborating the crucial role of the PAIg-mediated autoimmunization in controlling thrombocytopenia in viral hepatitis [103] .",

Microcirculatory dysfunction occur after microthrombosis producing, resulting in hypofunction of multiple organs (e.g. kidney, liver, lung and pancreas), which perform from dysfunction to failure, with illness progressing [88] . Crushed by the fibrous protein in the vessels, red blood cell destruction can lead to intravascular hemolysis. At the early stage of disease, it shows hypercoagulability. The blood in the needle is easy to coagulate, when getting blood sampling from the vein. After that, it comes with the stage of consumed hypocoagulation. The consuming of a great number of blood coagulation factors leads to significant tendency of hemorrhage [107] . It is difficult to stop bleeding in many parts of the body, including visceral organs, operative sites, injection sites, puncture sites, and mini-invasiva sites [128] . When the third stage, namely secondary fibrinolytic stage comes, a great number of the blood coagulation factors have already been used up, resulting in severe bleeding under the condition of low coagulation. Shock, acidosis and MODS make the patient's condition continue deteriorating, and are also the main reasons for death [129] .",

Soluble fibrin complexes, combination of FDPs and fibrin monomer, can't be solidified by thrombase. But protamine is able to make the complexes isolate and then fibrin monomers separate out again. The paracoagulation test means self-polymerization between fibrin monomers and FDPs, then forming macroscopic flocks. Ethanol gel test (EGT) has the same principle with Plasma protamine paracoagulation test (3P test), whereas the former has a lower positive rate. The two methods may have false negative results and false positive results. In contrast, EGT has a relatively lower sensitivity, while 3P test has a relatively lower specificity.

The 3P test shows positive with the occurrence of secondary fibrinolysis, whereas it shows negative with the occurrence of primary fibrinolysis. This means 3P test is negative when there is no blood coagulation. Domestic population data report that the positive rate of 3P tests reach 50-60%. However, the test can't be used as the ideal diagnostic indicator for DIC, owing to many affected factors.

This overall increased resistance to portal hypertensional causes increased local production of various vasodilators such as nitric oxide, leading to splanchnic vasodilation [182, 183] . There are several other factors contributing to the splanchnic vasodilation, including hyporesponsiveness of the splanchnic vessels and mesenteric vascular hyperplasia [181] . In addition, portal hypertension per se can cause renal vasoconstriction by activating sympathetic nervous. For example, when TIPS is used to reduce portal hypertension and improve renal blood flow, a corresponding reduction in sympathetic nervous activity has been observed [184, 185] . As a result of splanchnic vasodilation, blood is accumulated in the splanchnic vascular bed just like a splanchnic steal syndrome [186] . The combined effect leads to reduction in the effective arterial blood volume (Relative hypovolemia) causing a relative inadequacy in the systemic circulation, which triggers a hyperdynamic circulation in these patients [187, 188] .",

Relative hypovolemia initially causes sodium and water retention, increases intravascular volume, and simultaneously increases cardiac output. As cirrhosis progresses, vasodilatation aggravates, which activated vasoconstrictive systems, causing renal vasoconstriction and decreased renal blood flow [181, 190] . Local release of potent vasodilators such as nitric oxide (NO) leads to splanchnic visceral vasodilation, as well as enables the splanchnic circulation against a variety of vasopressor agents, including norepinephrine, vasopressin, angiotensin II and endothelin [191] . The resistance of the splanchnic circulation to these vasopressor agents makes the control of arterial pressure during cirrhosis dependent on the extra-splanchnic effects produced by the endogenous vasoconstrictor systems. The role of vasoconstrictors in maintaining haemodynamic stability becomes pivotal as arterial vasodilatation increases during cirrhosis, which makes clear why cirrhotic patients with HRS are prone to develop renal, hepatic and cerebral vasoconstriction [189] .",

Normally, the kidneys increase the production of renal vasodilators including prostaglandins and kallikrein to maintain blood flow. However, renal vasodilator production is generally reduced in patients with cirrhosis, thus contributing to renal vasoconstriction. This type of renal hypoperfusion further increases the production of various intrarenal vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II and endothelin, causing further decline of renal haemodynamics and renal function, occasionally accompanied by glomerular ischaemia and mesangial constriction [178] . When blood pressure fluctuates, renal auto-regulation regulatory mechanisms initiate to make sure that the kidneys receive a relatively constant blood supply. When the critical threshold is below 65 mmHg, renal blood flow is proportional to renal perfusion pressure which, in turn, is dependent on mean arterial pressure. In cirrhosis, with the development of liver disease in patients of cirrhosis, the renal auto-regulation curve gradually shifts to the right -which means as liver disease advances, the renal blood flow gradually decreases for each given renal perfusion pressure [178] . Furthermore, lumbar sympathetic blockade increases renal blood flow in patients with HRS, suggesting that the renal sympathetic activity is involved in this outgoing hepatorenal arm.",

Similarly, when patients with non-azotaemic cirrhotic patients who developed HRS are compared with similar patients who did not, it is observed that low cardiac output and high plasma renin activity (PRA) were independent predictors of HRS. In addition, in patients developing HRS, the evolvement of circulatory dysfunction leading to arterial hypotension and renal failure occurs in the setting of a continued decline in cardiac output and increase in PRA.

In the case of chronic kidney disease, a decreased creatinine clearance at 30 ml/minute or less is considered an indication of SLKT.

In order to further increase effective blood volume, Vasoconstrictors have been used in conjunction with intravenous albumin.

Extracorporeal albumin dialysis (ECAD) reduces serum creatinine levels, but it is not clear whether this effect is due to a real improvement of renal function or merely a filtration process. Several studies demonstrated that patients' systemic haemodynamics improved after ECAD, manifested as an increase in systemic vascular resistances and arterial pressure, as well as a decrease in cardiac output, PRA and levels of norepinephrine. However, there were too few studies on the effect of ECAD on survival in type-1 HRS patients to draw any definitive conclusions [203, 204] .

Four patients died, two of them died within 1 month, the other two died at 12 months and 14 months respectively. The remaining five patients survived for a long time.

Na + is major cation in extracellular fluid and its main anions are Cl \u2212 and HCO 3 \u2212 . K + is major cation in intracellular fluid and its major anion is HPO 4 2\u2212 . The total number of ions in body fluids is called osmolality, its unit is mOsm/L. If the osmolality on both sides of a semipermeable membrane is not equal, water moves toward the side with the higher osmolality. This phenomenon is called osmosis [216] . Osmosis of water can be opposed by applying a pressure across the semipermeable membrane in the direction opposite to that of the osmosis. The amount of pressure required to oppose the osmosis is defined to be osmotic pressure. In spite of various solute concentrations are different in extracellular and intracellular fluid, the osmotic pressure remain equal. Normal plasma osmotic pressure is 280-310 mOsm/L. Steady osmotic pressure is the basic guarantee to maintain the fluid balance across the cell membrane.",

            "text": "The main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain is GABA. Plasma GABA is derived from the conversion of glutamic acid by glutamate decarboxylase in intestinal bacterial. Notably, GABA has dual role. On one hand, during liver function failure and PSS, the removal of GABA in liver is significantly decreased; on the other hand, GABA can directly enter the systemic circulation bypassing the liver, resulting in increased concentration of GABA in blood. The concentration of GABA in CSF and brain tissue increases as more GABA crosses the abnormal blood-brain barrier. In addition, endogenous Bz was found in the blood and CSF, and the GABA receptor on the membrane surface of the brain's postsynaptic neurons increased significantly in some patients with HE and in animal models. This receptor not only combines with GABA but also binds to barbiturates (BARB) and Bz on different parts of the receptor surface; thus, it has been named the GABA/Bz complex receptor or the super receptor complex. When liver function is severely impaired, the binding affinity of this complex receptor to its three ligands is also increased. Binding of GABA, BARB, or Bz with the complex receptor can promote entry of chloride ions from neuronal membrane ion channels into the cytoplasm of postsynaptic neurons, causing membrane hyperpolarization and nerve conduction inhibition. HE symptoms were relieved in about 30% of patients treated with a GABA receptor antagonist or Bz receptor antagonist, and GABA/Bz and ammonia were reported to act synergistically in HE. Recently, some studies focused on peripheral type Bz receptors, which are different from central GABA [234, 235] . Some questions, including the source of endogenous Bz, and the correlation between the increased degree of GABA or Bz and the disease, remain to be answered. Therefore, therapy targeted at reducing the blood ammonia concentration in patients with HE and significantly reducing the increased GABA nerve tension seems reasonable [236] , but may not be completely effective. Treatment effects of reducing ammonia vary, because of the different levels of ammonia in HE patients that can be produced by the interaction between various known or unknown factors and the different effects of Bz receptor antagonists.",

            "text": "This theory is related to the metabolism of aromatic amino acids (AAA), the precursors of true neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine and dopamine. Due to the reduction in the liver's detoxification function or formation of PSS, the amines (phenylethylamine and tyramine) produced in the intestine cannot be cleared completely, resulting in elevated concentrations of these amines in the systemic circulation and increased levels in the brain through the blood-brain barrier. Under the effect of \u03b2-hydroxylase, phenethanolamine and \u03b2-hydroxytyramine (\u03b2-dopamine) are generated from phenylethylamine and tyramine, respectively and are similar to norepinephrine and dopamine in chemical structure. These amines can be taken up, stored and released by adrenergic neurons in the brainstem reticular structure. Phenethanolamine and \u03b2-hydroxytyramine are called false neurotransmitters because of their low physiological effects on the postsynaptic membrane, which is about 1/10 of norepinephrine. When these false neurotransmitters accumulate in the nerve synapse, they can outcompete or replace normal neurotransmitters, resulting in a disorder of nerve conduction. It was reported that plasma AAA (such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) increased and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA, such as valine, leucine, isoleucine) decreased in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, leading to an imbalance of amino acid metabolism. AAA are decomposed and metabolized in the liver, and liver failure decreases AAA decomposition resulting in an elevated concentration of AAA in the plasma. Insulin can promote BCAAs entering muscle, which is then broken down and metabolized in the skeletal muscle instead of the liver. Insulin inactivation is decreased in patients with liver failure, promoting a large number of BCAAs entering the muscle tissue and decreasing the concentration of BCAAs in plasma. Finally, the BCAA/AAA ratio is reduced from a normal 3-3.5:1 to 1:1 or lower. The above process reduces the BCAA concentration, but increases the AAA concentration, leading to an increase in synthesis of false neurotransmitters and reduction of the normal neurotransmitter [237] [238] [239] .",

The concentration of blood manganese can be increased when liver function is affected, during PSS, or when excretion of bile is reduced. Manganese content in plasma was sharply increased in more than 80% of patients with acute hepatitis and liver cirrhosis and the density of globus pallidus increased in the brain basal ganglia of HE patients (partially 2-7 times higher by MRI). Based on histological results, the above changes were caused by manganese deposition, which disappears after liver transplantation. It has been suggested that manganese deposition may cause dopamine dysfunction. Deposition of manganese not only cause direct brain injury, it can influence the function of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), norepinephrine and GABA neurotransmitters; impair astrocyte function; and have a synergistic effect with ammonia. However, there is no reliable correlation between the concentration of serum manganese and HE severity, which may be due to the chronic deposition of manganese [240] . The characteristic change in MRI imaging as the deposition of manganese remains to be verified. The effectiveness of manganese removal to improve the symptoms and neurological signs of patients with HE needs further validation.",

Similarly, SIRS is a common factor in triggering chronic liver failure characterized by HE and renal failure. In a study of patients with liver cirrhosis, artificially-induced hyperammonemia by oral administration of glutamine may have worsened the results of psycho-mental testing in 10 cases of sepsis patients; while brain toxicity was not obvious after the inflammation was relieved, the observation of decreased cytokine levels indicated that infection and induced inflammatory mediators enhanced brain toxicity of hyperammonemia.

According to the 2009 edition of the \"Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Hepatic Encephalopathy\" in China, HE is divided into 0-4 periods, but each period can be overlapping or distinct but each period can be overlapping (Table 2 .4). At present, scholars have stressed that the occurrence of HE is a continuous progression of the disease and should be viewed as a continuum of a wide range of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, rather than isolated clinical stages. According to the traditional West Haven criteria diagnosing grade 1 HE is based on clinical signs and physician assessments, resulting in diagnostic criteria confusion [253] . (Fig. 2.3) . Covert HE is diagnosed by a variety of neuropsychological and intelligence tests; the evaluation of overt HE widely uses the modified West Haven semi-quantitative grading table for the analysis of patients with neuropsychiatric state (Table 2 .5), the Glasgow coma scale for the analysis of the degree of consciousness of patients, and the simple HE Severity Rating Scale for the disease ",

To reduce the source of ammonia, it has been suggested that patients with HE should limit protein intake. In critically ill patients, it has been suggested that they should stop all protein intake and, after the disease improves, gradually increase protein intake to the maximum clinical tolerance. These recommendations are now being questioned because most cirrhotic patients are malnourished and all long-term protein-restricted diets increase the severity of malnutrition. In addition, a negative nitrogen balance increases mobilization of skeletal muscle, resulting in a reduction in ammonia metabolism that may increase blood ammonia levels. Recent studies have shown that normal ingestion of protein 1.2 g/(kg \u2022 d) can also improve the health-related quality of life (HRQOL), especially in MHE [265] ; and have no adverse effects on the recovery of blood ammonia and HE Fig. 2.4 The flow chart of diagnosis of HE compared with the restricted protein intake. According to the guidelines of the European Society of Enteral Nutrition in 2009, the intake of protein should be guided by the following principles: patients with acute phase HE on the first day should be put on a prohibited protein diet and given glucose to ensure energy supply and those who cannot eat food may be fed through a nasogastric tube without short-term fasting; patients with chronic HE do not need to fast and their intake of protein should be 1-1.5 g/(kg \u2022 d); oral or intravenous use of BCAA and essential amino acid preparations can be administered to adjust the balance of AAA/BCAA, promote the balance of nitrogen, and also reduce the risk of HE recurrence [266] ; probiotics and prebiotics can enhance the body's tolerance to protein; plant protein is superior to animal protein because it contains methionine, has less AAA, and more BCAA, but it also contains cellulose, which is conducive to maintain the normal flora in the colon and acidize the intestinal tract, shortening the transit time of the colon and reducing absorption of ammonia. The above points need further verification. ",

Lactulose, a kind of synthetic ketone disaccharide, cannot be broken down in the stomach and small intestine due to a lack of enzymes that can break down galactose in the digestive tract. After entering the colon, lactulose can be broken down into acetic acid and lactic acid with the help of gut bacteria, leading to a reduction in the colonic pH and inhibition of the absorption of ammonia in the intestine. These non-absorbent disaccharides are decomposed into organic particles in the intestinal tract, which can increase the osmotic pressure of the intestine, and their acidic products stimulate the intestinal wall and can slightly promote intestinal excretion. These non-absorbent disaccharides, acting as prebiotics in the intestine, can inhibit the growth of bacteria, which can produce ammonia and urea, finally reducing the production of ammonia and reversing low-grade cerebral edema when combined with rifaximin [270] . However, probiotics can benefit patients in the long-term [271] . Oral or nasal feeding (15-30 mL, 2 or 3 times daily) was recommended to adjust the daily defecation appropriately, about 2-3 times daily. Main adverse reactions include abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

In the past, oral aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as neomycin, which are rarely orally ingested, were used to inhibit the overgrowth of bacteria in the intestine. However, recent randomized placebo-controlled studies have shown that neomycin may not benefit patients with HE compared with placebo-treated patients and that long-term use of neomycin may lead to increased ear and renal toxicity risk and impair the function of small intestinal mucosa [274] . Metronidazole can inhibit anaerobic bacteria in the intestine and alleviate HE, but long-term use may lead to disruption in the intestinal flora, gastrointestinal discomfort, or neurotoxicity. Rifaximin, a derivative of rifamycin with a broad-spectrum, has a potent inhibitory effect on intestinal bacterial growth, is a minimally-absorbed oral antibiotic and only plays a role in the gastrointestinal part. Administration of rifaximin (550 mg, twice a day) can significantly prevent the occurrence of HE compared with placebo-treated patients [275] [276] [277] ; rifaximin was equivalent to or better than lactulose and neomycin in treating patients with chronic HE [278] . A study indicated that rifaximin-\u03b1 in combination with lactulose was a cost-effective therapy for patients who had experienced at least two prior overt HE episodes [270] , and this therapy could also improve the driving ability of patients with covert HE without toxicity to the auditory nerve and renal function [274, 277] . Thus, rifaximin has been recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of recurrent HE. The efficacy of rifaximin and relation between longterm use of rifaximin and intestinal flora in the treatment of HE needs to be further investigated. However, a recent study in mice showed that rifaximin beneficially alters intestinal ammonia generation by regulating intestinal glutaminase expression in MHE [277] . The study may provide a new opportunity to study intestinal flora in the treatment of HE.",

Although the reduction of dopamine neurotransmitter activity is also one of the pathogenesis, the application of bromocriptine, levodopa, has been unable to bring more benefits besides partly improving symptoms of patients.",

Therefore, it is difficult to implement and draw convincing conclusions from randomized controlled trials with a single intervention targeting a specific pathogenesis and risk factor. Ongoing issues remain, such as standardizing the research design of HE treatment and evaluating the efficacy of HE treatment more scientifically and objectively. Some clinical studies may bring new hope for HE treatment by new ongoing strategies of targeted systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurosteroids. In addition, the key point in improving the prognosis of HE is early recognition and timely treatment. Active treatment should be given when diagnosing covert HE.

In 1935, Snell reported decreased arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 , less than 94%) with abnormal hemoglobin in 38 patients with liver parenchymal lesions and biliary obstruction, and 3 years later, he proposed that such a phenomenon was associated with decreased affinity of O 2 with hemoglobin. In 1956, Rydell and Hoffbauer reported the detailed clinical diagnostic and treatment process of a 17-year-old male with \"juvenile cirrhosis\", and found multiple arterial-venous anastomoses in the lungs during autopsy, which he thought contributed to clinical cyanosis mainly. This provided a histological basis for the patient, and people conducted a large amount of studies thereafter. In 1966, Berthelot et al. injected opaque glue into the pulmonary vascular beds at the time of biopsy after the patient's death for the first time, and he found abnormal small arterial dilation in the lungs of the patient with cirrhosis, which he termed lung spider nevus. The term hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) was first proposed by Kennedy and Knudson in 1977 [303] . After nearly 20 years of studies in a large number, people gradually developed a clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis. In 1988, Eriksson used the term functional hepatopulmonary syndrome for the first time. In 1989, the famous liver disease expert Sherlock formally used this diagnostic term in his monograph Hepatobiliary Diseases, which has been recognized by many scholars [304] .",

Since primary heart and lung diseases have been excluded when HPS occurs, the abnormal pathways that red cells may pass through include: (1) passing through the pleural and hilar bronchial vessels while not reaching the alveoli; (2) blood flows directly into the pulmonary veins due to the high pressure portal system in the mediastinum, thereby bypassing the pulmonary circulation; (3) flowing directly into the pulmonary veins through the expanded alveolar capillaries or the pulmonary-venous fistula. Alveolar telangiectasia may be more important to the formation of hypoxemia, and existing study data show that the development of HPS is at least associated with the systemic hyperdynamic state, portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome and pulmonary hypertension [308] .

Factors that affect the dilation of blood vessels: the mechanisms underlying pulmonary vascular dilatation have not yet fully elucidated, and the possible influencing factors include: (a) Increased activity of vascular dilators Various acute and chronic liver diseases, liver cell failure and metabolic disorders, particularly reduced inactivation of vasoactive substances which can enter directly into the systemic circulation through abnormal anastomotic collateral vessels, result in disorder of the systemic hemodynamics and increased contents of vasodilators in the blood circulation. Just as visceral congestion in patients with portal hypertension, they can act on the intrapulmonary vessels, causing pulmonary vascular dilatation and pulmonary congestion. Substances that cause vasodilation include glucagon, prostaglandin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, nitric oxide, angiotensin, bradykinin and endotoxin, etc. (b) Reduced vasoconstrictors or decreased sensitivity of intrapulmonary vascular beds to the endogenous vasoconstrictors, such as norepinephrine, endothelin, atrial natriuretic peptide, vasopressin, serotonin and tyrosine, etc. The contents of the substances are not absolutely reduced because maybe their sensitivity is reduced. When chronic liver disease occurs, the anterior communicating branches of the originally closed non-functional capillaries may be opened, and a disorder occurs in the hypoxic pulmonary vascular systolic dysfunction which should have been normal, and it is only 75% of the normal state [309] . (c) Neurological factors Cirrhotic patients show sympathetic nerve hyperactivity, but after the formation of portal hypertension, their sympathetic nerve function may be damaged, which play an important role. Animals with portal hypertension often show abnormal pressure responses and reduced sensitivity of blood vessels to norepinephrine, resulting in increased cardiac output, and dilated pulmonary vascular volumes. Besides, hemodynamics within the lungs is also a manifestation of the body's hyperdynamics. (d) Decreased reactivity of intrapulmonary blood vessels to hypoxia Recent inert gas dispersion tests show that cirrhotic patients with over two spider nevus are manifested as not only liver damage, but also decreased systemic intrapulmonary vascular resistance, decreased reactivity of blood vessels to hypoxia and dilated pulmonary vessels. However, it was also found using pulmonary angiography that in spite of the dilated vessels at the ending of arteries, the responses of vessels to oxygen were almost normal, which did not support this view. (e) Intrahepatic angiogenesis or dysplasia may also be one of the factors for the formation of HPS.",

Therefore, it was believed that mechanical compression and insufficient ventilation due to pulmonary interstitial edema in patients with liver cirrhosis was the main reason for impaired lung function. Subsequently, Edison et al. studied the pulmonary function of 21 patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, and found that their VC, maximum ventilation volume (MVV), FRC, total lung volume, and R/T were significantly reduced, and they believed that patients with cirrhosis had obvious obstructive and limited insufficient ventilation, which were mainly caused by compression of lung tissue due to increased abdominal pressure, elevated diaphragm and increased chest volume and pressure when patients had additional ascites, and atelectasis [306] . However, decreased FEV1 resulted from compression of small trachea due to pulmonary interstitial edema and vasodilation, and early closure of expiration. Theoretically, all of the above factors can lead to insufficient ventilation, one of the factors resulting in this disease.

Pulmonary angiography can show small spider-like to obviously cavernous diffuse vasodilation within the lungs. Due to the significant dilation of the pulmonary capillaries and the anterior capillaries, the diffusion distance of the blood flow in central blood vessels and the alveoli is increased, preventing the gases in the alveoli from entering the pulmonary capillaries, thereby affecting the gas exchanges. Studies have shown that hypoxemia often occurs in patients with cirrhosis or aggravates during exercises, and it is believed that diffusion disorder or limitation of oxygen occurs in patients. In fact, factors that affect O 2 diffusion do occur in patients with cirrhosis, but they are still not sufficient to explain the apparent hypoxemia. Although vascular dilatation occurs at arterial endings in patients with HPS, their arterial partial pressure of oxygen can be reduced while inhaling air and increased when they are given oxygen inhalation, which further proves that although diffusion disorder does exist and it plays a role in the formation of this disease, the role is not important.",

            "text": "1. Intravascular vascular dilatation: Pulmonary vascular dilatation has been confirmed pathologically and by angiography. Dilated blood vessels in the lungs leads to gas diffusion disorder. Besides, since the oxygen molecules in the air can not be diffused to the central dilated blood for the gas exchange, causing decreased ventilation/blood flow ratio and pulmonary arterial partial pressure of oxygen. This decreased ventilation/blood flow, together with increased amount of reactive cardiac output, shortens the duration of blood that flows through the capillary network and insufficient oxygenation [312] . Excessive ventilation can in part enhance patients' PaO 2 . If the alveolar oxygen partial pressure is increased at this time, some oxygen molecules can reach the central areas of dilated blood vessels, increasing the arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Therefore, it is called the diffusion -perfusion disorder or pulmonary arteriovenous functional shunt rather than the true lung shunt. 2. Arterial -venous shunt: Intrapulmonary vascular fistula and pleural spider nevus can occur in cirrhosis of the liver and allow the pulmonary arterial blood to circumvent gas exchange and directly flow into the pulmonary vein so that patients may develop hypoxemia. This hypoxemia can not be corrected by oxygen inhalation and represents the true pulmonary shunt, which has been confirmed by pulmonary histopathology, angiography, transthoracic echocardiography and other examinations. It is now believed that pulmonary vascular casting is still the most direct evidence for determining the arterialvenous shunt. This intrapulmonary arterial -venous shunt is the main cause of abnormal ventilation/blood flow ratio and insufficient gas exchange. Although pleural spider nevus can also cause arterial -venous shunt, it generally does not suffice to cause significant hypoxemia due to the small amount of shunt. In addition, studies in recent years also show that portal-pulmonary vein shunt in a small amount occurs in some patients with cirrhosis, in whom blood flow circumvents the alveolar gas exchange and enters directly the systemic circulation. This can also cause ventilation/blood flow abnormalities, causing insufficient gas exchange 3. Airway closure: In 1971, Ruff et al. proved that cirrhotic patients had significantly increased closed volume (CV) and total amount of closed gas (CC) and increased gases trapped in the lower fields of the lungs, resulting in an extremely low ratio of ventilation/blood flow, and they believed these were due to reduced airway ventilation [302, 313] . In 1984, Furukawa et al. measured the lung function of 105 patients with liver cirrhosis and did not find abnormalities; however, most patients had flow -volume abnormalities and significantly increased CV, suggesting the closed the airway in advance and decreased ratio of ventilation/blood flow, which might important causes of hypoxemia. 4. Decreased affinity of oxygen with hemoglobin: Some reports showed that 15 patients with cirrhosis (mostly alcoholic cirrhosis) patients had mild systemic vascular or pulmonary vascular dilatation, normal PaO 2 , mild hypocapnia, mild right shift of the oxygenated hemoglobin dissociation curve, normal amount of carbon monoxide diffusion [313] , and mild imbalance of the ventilation/PaO 2 blood flow, indicating that the right shift of the oxygen dissociation curve due to decreased affinity of oxygen with hemoglobin in the patients. This was possibly caused by the increased concentration of 2,3-diphosphate glyceride in red blood cells, which, however, is not an important factor in the occurrence of hypoxemia [302] .",

Pulmonary function tests mainly showed significantly decreased VC, FRC, MVV and FEV1, but sometimes the total lung volume and FEV1 were normal. Chest X-ray, CT scan and transthoracic contrast echocardiography (TTCE) HPS patients are mostly normal on chest radiography or show diffuse small millet shadows predominantly in both lower lobes of the lungs, nodular shadows in both lower lung interstitium, dilated pulmonary arterial trunks, and thickened pulmonary markings, whereas these manifestations have no specific values to the diagnosis of this disease. CT scan shows certain diagnostic values in that it demonstrates distal vasodilation and even pleural blood vessels, and can suggest the presence of HPS. Arteriovenous communicating occurs in HPS patients due to pulmonary vascular dilation, indicating that subclinical pulmonary vascular dilatation and abnormal gas exchanges occur in cirrhotic patients with normal PaO 2 [306] . Contrast echocardiography: when HPS is suspected, transthoracic echocardiography can be used as a preliminary screening to determine whether the intrapulmonary vascular dilation occurs or not. The microbubble contrast material in the right atrium, after intravenous injection of dioxane isotonic saline, will develop images in the left atrium through the dilated vascular beds after 3-6 cardiac cycles, while the microbubbles cannot pass through the normal capillaries (Normal capillaries are <8-15 \u03bcm in diameter). Approximately 40% of patients with cirrhosis had positive changes on contrast echocardiography, while only a small proportion of patients are in line with the diagnosis of HPS due to the influence of dilated blood vessels. If contrast echocardiography is positive for liver cirrhosis or portal hypertension patients with hypoxemia and cardiopulmonary diseases in them can be ruled out, then the diagnosis of HPS is established.",

Patients with pulmonary cirrhosis often have a long history of chronic lung disease and signs of cardiac insufficiency, such as edema of lower extremities, palpitation, shortness of breath and other symptoms. This patient has no history of chronic lung disease or edema of lower extremities, making him inconsistent with liver cirrhosis following pulmonary heart disease. 2.

A history of liver disease or evidence of chronic liver damage and decreased PO 2 can be found in patients with HPS, especially such characteristics as orthostatic hypoxemia and intrapulmonary vascular dilatation.

Therefore, under the current circumstances in which there are no effective measures for HPS, active and effective treatment of primary liver diseases is the basis for the treatment of HPS. Therapy of primary diseases, including correction of hypoproteinemia, elimination of pleural effusion, improvement of liver function and treatment of complications, etc., can improve tissue oxygenation and improve arterial oxygen saturation. On this basis, the following treatment can be given.",

It is now believed that once the diagnosis is established, treatment should be given as soon as possible. In the early stage of correcting hypoxemia in patients with mild conditions, even in patients in whom the critical value of hypoxemia (PaO 2 , 8-9 KPa (60-67.5 mmHg) is reached and who have ascites, the hemoglobin saturation may still be less than 85% when patients are in activities or even sleep. That is to say, nasal catheter oxygen inhalation at 2-3 L/min is needed so as to improve hypoxemia [318] . With the development of the disease, oxygen flow needs to be gradually increased, and intratrachea oxygen supply can be offered when necessary. During the late stage, patients can receive pressurized oxygen through a ventilator or a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. For patients whose conditions are severe, the efficacy of oxygen therapy alone is not obvious. 2. Vasoactive drugs Vasoactive drugs for the treatment of patients with HPS are most studied; however, since its pathogenesis has not been clarified to date and primary liver disease is difficult to reverse, it is hard to define the clinical efficacy of these drugs. The commonly used drugs include: used aerosolized ephedrine hydrochloride for the treatment of 12 patients with HPS, and the preliminary efficacy was significant. The mechanisms were that ephedrine could excite the pulmonary vascular \u03b1 receptor, resulting in contracted bronchial mucosa and pulmonary capillaries and alleviated bronchial edema, so that the dilated blood vessels within the lungs were contracted and intrapulmonary shunt was reduced. Meanwhile, the bronchial \u03b22 receptors were excited and the bronchi were dilated so as to improve the ventilation/blood flow ratio and relieve hypoxia. Further studies are merited. (f) Others: There have been reports on sympathomimetic drugs (isoproterenol) and \u03b2-blockers (propranolol), etc. that improve the symptoms of HPS. Theoretically, vascular endothelin, estrogen suppressor (Tamoxifen) and so on can relieve the spider nevus and pulmonary vascular dilatation in patients with liver cirrhosis and improve their respiratory symptoms, while further studies are needed. NO is most studied currently, and there are reports indicating that NO synthesis inhibitors can increase pulmonary vascular resistance. Alexander et al. used NO for the treatment of severe hypoxemia in patients after liver transplantation, and obtained good results. Durand et al. also reported that an HPS patient was cured by inhaling NO, while its mechanisms and clinical efficacy needed to be further confirmed. 3. Pulmonary embolism It is generally considered that pulmonary vascular dilatation can vanish after liver transplantation in HPS patients who are normal on pulmonary angiography or who have cavernous vessels on imaging [310] ; for patients who show diffuse pulmonary vascular dilation features on pulmonary angiography, embolization is usually not adopted since patients' lesions are extensive and the efficacy is poor; for patients with isolated and severe pulmonary vascular dilation or arterial-venous communicating branches, local pulmonary embolism therapy can yield a satisfactory effect. 4. Liver transplantation It is currently considered that liver transplantation is still a possible fundamental measure for the treatment for HPS. In the past, it was believed that serious hypoxemia was an absolute contraindication against liver transplantation, while recent studies show that liver transplantation is preferred for patients who have good alveolar gas diffusion function, who can respond well to pure oxygen inhalation and who can undergone oxygenation safely during anesthesia. Recent reports further prove that hypoxemia can be cured after liver transplantation [308] . Through literature review and case reports, Krowka et al. believed that progressive hypoxemia in HPS could be used as an indication of liver transplantation. Temporary hypoxemia following liver transplantation can be adjusted by using NO and taking the head-down supine position and the alternate lateral decubitus position. And for HPS patients who fail to respond to the inhalation of pure oxygen, who have direct pulmonary arterial communicating branches on pulmonary angiography and who have severe clinical hypoxia, liver transplantation cannot improve their hypoxic status, has limited efficacy, or even increases intraoperative and postoperative risks. Therefore, liver transplantation should not be performed on them.",

Endotoxins do not elicit their toxic effects -as we might suspect and as it is known for many proteinous exotoxins which can kill host cells or inhibit cellular functions. Rather, LPS requires the active response of host cells. According to present knowledge we get, LPS interacts with various host cell types through lipid A, those cells include mononuclear cells, thrombocytes, endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and polymorphonuclear granulocytes, among which macrophages/monocytes are of particular importance. Through the LPS-induced activation, macrophages produce many substances, like bioactive lipids, reactive oxygen species, and in particular, cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor a (TNF), interleukin-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. It appears that when low levels of mediators are produced, beneficial effects (e.g., induction of resistance to infection, adjuvant activity) are elicited and when high levels of mediators reach the circulation that detrimental effects (e.g., high fever, hypotension, irreversible shock) are induced. However, when the host organism is in a hyperreactive state LPS, low mediator concentrations may also become harmful. The hyperreactivity to endotoxin may be caused by exo-toxins, chronic infection, and by growing tumors, and interferon-\u03b3.",

Thus, to identify and treat the infection may not be able to improve the patient's survival. 3. MODS may have perfectly healthy organ involved, and it is ferocious and rapidly progresses. Once happened, it is difficult to depress in the event almost, so often with a high mortality rate. 4. In pathology, MODS lacks features, the affected organ only showing acute inflammation, such as inflammatory cell infiltration and so on, and these changes are very inconsistent with severe clinical manifestations, and once restored, patients do not have any clinical sequelae. 5. MODS is closely with shock and infection. Shock, infection, injury (including trauma and surgery, etc.) are the three main causes of MODS. 6.

Instability of circulation due to a variety of inflammatory mediators have effects on the cardiovascular system, the circulation is most likely involved. Almost all cases, at least in the course of the early and middle will be in highpower type of cycle of \"high ranked low resistance\". Cardiac output up to 10 L/ min or more and low peripheral resistance cause shock and need vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. 2. High metabolic systemic infection and MODS are usually accompanied by severe malnutrition. Its metabolic mode has three salient features: (1) persistent high metabolism, metabolic rate up to 1.5 times more than normal; (2) abnormalities of energy pathway. In starvation, the body obtain energy mainly through the decomposition of. However, with systemic infection, the body will get energy by breaking down proteins while the use of sugar is limited and fat utilization may increase early, fall later; (3) poor response to exogenous nutrient, supplement of exogenous nutrition can not effectively prevent itself consumption, which suggests that a high metabolism itself has a \"mandatory\" also known as \"autophagy Metabolism.\" High metabolic may have serious consequences. First, protein malnutrition result from it will cause serious damage to the structure and function of the enzyme system of organs; secondly, imbalance of branched-chain amino acids and aromatic amino acid which makes the latter formate into a pseudo-neurotransmitter, then further lead to dysfunction of nerve. 3. Hypoxia in tissue cells at present many scholars believe that the high metabolic and circulatory disorders often cause oxygen supply and oxygen demand does not match, so that the tissues of bodies are in a hypoxic state, mainly clinically manifesting \"oxygen supply dependency\" and \"lactic acidosis. \".",

Such clinical manifestations as orthostatic hypoxia and shortness of breath are important reference indicators. 2. Chang SW et al. proposed the diagnostic criteria for HPS in 1996: (a) Hepatic insufficiency.

(c) Intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. 3. Krowka et al. believed in 1997 that when portal hypertension, spider nevus and clubbing occurred in patients, the diagnosis of this disease was strongly suggested, and relevant tests were needed for confirmed diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria included: (a) Intrapulmonary capillary dilation confirmed by such examinations as 99cm TC-MAA scan, contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography and pulmonary angiography;(b) Chronic liver disease and hypoxemia with PaO 2 < 9.3 KPa (70 mmHg).",

However, the application of this drug in animal experiments and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease could promote the ventilation/blood flow ratio.(b) Somatostatin and its analogues: These drugs can block the dilatory effects of nerve peptides on pulmonary blood vessels and suppress the production of glucagon. Salem et al. reported a case in which octreotide could improve PaO 2 swiftly in the patient with liver cirrhosis and severe hypoxemia, and he successfully underwent liver transplantation. However, the study by Krowka and Schwarty et al. showed that this class of drugs did not yield significant effects on patients with HPS. Theoretically, this drug can block the dilatory effects of nerve peptides on pulmonary blood vessels, while there are also data showing that octreotide can stop the symptoms of cancer-like metastatic syndrome. Therefore, its clinical efficacy still merits further studies. Song et al. found that long-acting aspirin displayed a certain effect. (c) Prostaglandin inhibitors: They can inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandin E2a within the lungs, reduce the dilatory effects of prostaglandin E2a on pulmonary vascular beds and improve the arterial oxygenation in animals with lung injury. Shijo et al. used indomethacin for the treatment of patients with HPS, and increased PaO 2 and decreased alveolar -arterial oxygen pressure were noted. Still, further clinical applications are merited for confirmation [308]. (d) Cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids: Cadranel et al. reported that cyclophosphamide and prednisone for 12 months successfully resulted in improved hypoxemia in a non-cirrhotic hepatocellular failure patient. Maybe these drugs are effective for pulmonary lesions in patients with chronic liver disease due to immune dysfunction. (e) Aerosol inhalation of ephedrine: Domestic researcher Zhang Liming et al.",
