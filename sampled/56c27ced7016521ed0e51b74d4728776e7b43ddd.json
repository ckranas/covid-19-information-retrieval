All data were compiled in the software for statistical analysis 'R'. To estimate the DALYs lost due to neurocysticercosisassociated epilepsy and headache a DALY Pigs represent an important source of income and protein in rural communities of Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA). However, smallholder pig production systems are generally severely constrained by poor management of pigs and associated diseases such as Taenia solium cysticercosis (TSC) and African swine fever (ASF). As a consequence pig performance, health and welfare are often compromised just as public health is threatened due to TSC affected pork. One of the main challenges in improving the situation is the farmer\u2032s superstitions and lack of knowledge of disease pathways and basic requirements of pigs. The current project therefore uses a multifactorial 'One Health' approach to address the complexity of changing not only management practices, animal and human health but also perceptions and prejudices. This involves awareness generation to improve overall public knowledge and community based research to document effect and feasibility at village level, in order to persuade farmers and other stakeholders to adapt solutions long-term. Small-scale testing of management tools have been carried out through student projects and the results and experiences combined in optimized pig production models tailored to conditions in Mozambique and Tanzania. The production model focuses on confinement of pigs as the key entry point for controlling TSC and ASF. To alleviate some of the problems associated with confinement, farmers and communities are provided with education on pen construction, disease control, breeding and how to provide suitable feeds and water. The production models are then assessed for effectiveness, efficacy and acceptability among smallholder pig farmers in selected communities. The impact on TSC, ASF, ecto-and endoparasites is also monitored and farmer livelihood is assessed before and after introduction of the production models.

The disease is common in developing countries and is a serious public health risk. Cysticercosis implicates significant economic losses, both in pig production and its impact on human health causing severe headaches and seizures. Cysticercosis control strategies in developing countries have been limited by a lack of available intervention tools and poor socioeconomic and sanitary conditions. Consequently, the intervention strategies to prevent and control cysticercosis must be on health education engaging the communities and creating public awareness. Enhancing basic conditions such as hygiene has an important effect on reducing the risk of transmission. In addition some very simple but effective changes in people's day-to-day practices such as use of latrines and keeping pigs in pens would stop the life cycle of the disease and considerably reduce the risk of cysticercosis transmission. The need for political will and resources are basic requirements in order to control not only cysticercosis but also other endemic zoonotic diseases. ICONZ and ADVANZ are two One Health neglected zoonotic diseases projects, funded by the European Commission through its 7th framework program.

Taenia solium taeniosis/cysticercosis is a serious agricultural and public health problem in Tanzania. This study aimed at describing the fluctuations in porcine cysticercosis prevalence in an endemic area. Three cross-sectional surveys were carried out in Mbeya Region, Tanzania, in November-December 2007 , March-April 2012 , and October-November 2012 In the first survey 300 farmers in 30 villages were visited and two of their pigs randomly sampled. In the following two surveys census sampling was used in 22 villages attempting to include all nonpregnant pigs more than 2-month old. For all surveys jugular vein blood was collected and analysed for cysticercosis antigen using Ag-ELISA. In the first survey 600 serum samples were collected. In each of the following surveys approximately 800 serum samples were collected. The first survey revealed a cysticercosis prevalence of 31% (n = 600, CI = 27-35%), in the second survey the prevalence had significantly dropped to 15% (n = 822, CI = 13-18%), and in the 6-month follow-up the prevalence had increased to 24% (n = 812, CI = 21-27%). Explanations for the observed fluctuations can only be speculated. However, in 2011 the study area suffered a decimating outbreak of African swine fever (ASF). Overlapping risk factors for ASF and porcine cysticercosis support the hypothesis that ASF may reduce cysticercosis prevalence. Also, as the Ag-ELISA assay used is not species specific, variation in transmission of other Taenia species could influence cysticercosis prevalence when measured by Ag-ELISA. Finally, seasonal variation in porcine cysticercosis could exist because of different seasonal production systems. The fluctuations are in contradiction with the theoretical model which predicts a stable equilibrium.

The role of NCC in epilepsy differs geographically and in sub-Saharan Africa, it is poorly defined. We aimed at contributing data for Rwanda, assessing factors associated with NCC, and evaluating a real-time PCR assay in case detection. In southern Rwanda and at three healthcare facilities, 215 epilepsy patients and 51 controls were clinically examined, interviewed, and tested by immunoblot for cysticerci-specific serum antibodies. In addition, patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were tested for anticysticercal antibodies by ELISA and for parasite DNA by PCR. Cranial computer tomography scans were available for 12% of patients. The Del Brutto criteria were applied for NCC diagnosis. Cysticerci-specific serum antibodies were found in 22% of epilepsy patients and 4% of controls (P = 0.003). Seropositivity was associated with age, pork consumption, and, at statistical borderline, lack of safe drinking water. 23% of the epilepsy patients had NCC (definitive, 7.4%; probable, 15.8%).

In this particular year, 38 out of 160 samples examined (23.8%) showed evidence for a chikungunya virus infection. Surveillance of chikungunya virus infections was performed by examining serum samples from travelers presenting at the outpatient clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) Antwerp, Belgium or serum samples that were submitted by Belgian laboratories to the Central Laboratory of Clinical Biology of ITM for the diagnosis of chikungunya. Testing was performed by serology (immunofluorescence) on all samples and by real time PCR on samples from the first 10 days of illness. Clinical information was obtained retrospectively.

Between 2007 and 2012 a total of 3043 dogs of various age, gender, breeds and utilization were examined. Microfilariaemia was diagnosed using modified Knott test; PCR approach was used for Dirofilaria species identification. Dirofilariosis was detected in 369 of examined dogs with mean prevalence rate of 12.13%. Dirofilaria repens was confirmed as etiological agent of infection in all positive samples, in eight dogs mixed infection with Dirofilaria repens and Dirofilaria immitis (heartworm) was revealed. Endemic areas with prevalence higher 34% were identified in south-western and south-eastern regions of Slovakia. Outdoor keeping and age higher 3 years become evident important risk factors. High infection rate (more than 50% in endemic regions) found in police dogs has represented serious veterinary problem. On the other hand, very positive fact is that intensive cooperation with police veterinarians and introduction of preventive measures led in significant decrease of Dirofilaria prevalence with the average of 4-6%. With regard to the zoonotic character dirofilariosis represents not only veterinarian but also public-health problem.

According to the report of climate change and biodiversity, it is estimated that the average temperature of the earth's surface will rise between 1.4 and 5.8\u00b0C by the end of the twenty-first century. The aim of the study was to establish the influence of the environmental average temperature in the determination of the sex of the Aedes aegypti, since it has been demonstrated in some species of lizards and tortoises, and its influence on dengue epidemics. So, it was performed a correlational ecological study and a experimental study. The first one calculated the regression linear model between the environmental temperature of Neiva, Colombia, from 2008 to 2010 and the incidence of dengue in the same period. The regression model calculated for the year 2009, 33.10% of the effect of dengue was explained by the environmental temperature (Prob > F = 0.0007). For the year 2010, the regression model explained the 26.05% of the incidence of dengue because of the environmental average temperature (Prob > F = 0.0059).

Introduction The incidence of dengue has increased rapidly with increasing geographic expansion to new countries. In 2012, the first major dengue outbreak occurred in Madeira, Europe (ever since the 1927 outbreak in Greece) with over 2100 cases.

Introduction Dengue remains a public health problem in Thailand and other countries in tropical and temperate zones. In recent years, reports have shown an increase in the age of dengue patients at the country level in Thailand. However, no formal study had been conducted on the change of age among dengue patients at the local scale over time.

The average age of dengue patients between 1999-2002 and 2009-2012 were 13 .00 AE 7.51 years (range = 1-40) and 22.45 AE 13.09 years (range = 1-74) respectively. The age of dengue patients increased significantly over time. This study was the first to use GIS spatial analysis to compare the age of dengue patients over time. Results obtained could be used for planning effective dengue prevention and control programs. Dengue was first serologically confirmed in Sri Lanka in 1962, with the first outbreak being reported in 1965. Thereafter, multiple similar outbreaks with endemic dengue fever (DF) were reported in urban areas, with only occasional reporting of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) a potentially life-threatening condition. DHF first emerged as a public health problem in Sri Lanka from 1989. Since early 2000 progressively larger epidemics of Dengue with more DHF have occurred at regular intervals. Here, we report major epidemiological shift with increasing incidence of DHF being reported in the country. Dengue has been a nationally notifiable disease since 1996. Characteristics of reported DHF patients and deaths from 2009 to 2012 are presented from national surveillance data. Dengue reporting has intensified during the past decade with expanding geographic distribution, increasing epidemic frequency and the emergence of DHF in new areas. A major upward shift with a mean incidence of 177.5 cases per 100 000 population was reported (both DF and DHF) over the past 4 years. During the same period clinically confirmed cases by severity showed a markedly high proportion of 10-15% DHF at national level. Although DHF was reported among all age groups they tend to be younger with a mean age of 14 years compared to 18 years among DF patients. Overall case fatality rate (CFR) has declined from 1% in 2009 to 0.4% in 2012. Mean age of deceased DHF patients was higher than those who survived. There is an increase incidence of DF and DHF observed in Sri Lanka. Overall case fatality due to DHF has shown a gradual decline. Therefore, we conclude that the national guidelines on management and the serial blood counts beyond day 3 of fever introduced in 2009 has helped early identification of DHF and proactive management leading to a reduction in mortality.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 255, "end": 286, "text": "1999-2002 and 2009-2012 were 13", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Materials and Methods Plaeng Yao District,"}, {"text": "Dengue epidemiology in a high-income urban setting: outbreak investigations from Kaohsiung City, Taiwan", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P.1.4.2.009 (B)"}, {"text": "Kaohsiung City, a modern metropolis of 1.5 million people, has been the focus of dengue activity in Taiwan for several decades.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P.1.4.2.009 (B)"}, {"text": "Our study aimed to provide a temporal and spatial description of dengue epidemiology in Kaohsiung City, based on data from the routine surveillance system conducted by Taiwan CDC.

Our interview results showed that 73.4% of children wore impregnated school uniforms 5 days a week. The majority of them washed the uniforms once a week (68.7%) mainly with washing machines (62.4%) and power detergents (90.2%). Approximately 41.1% dried the uniforms under shadow or windy area and 78.4% ironed the uniforms. The majority of school children had no activity after school (62.5%), therefore they changed from school uniforms to casual clothes after school (63%). Our interview results revealed that uniform treatment habits may be important factors for the reduction in efficacy of permethrin-treated uniforms over time. Improvement of impregnation is needed to prolong the impact of treated uniforms on mosquito vectors and dengue transmission. Dengue is caused by four different but antigenically related viruses, DENV-1 to DENV-4, transmitted to humans through the bites of Aedes mosquitoes. The disease is endemic in 100 countries from Asia, America, Africa and Oceania. In Europe, in the past century, Dengue epidemics occurred in Greece and other Mediterranean countries where A. aegypti was present. After that, it disappeared from Europe, but another competent vector, A. albopictus, was introduced in late 70s. In recent years, A. aegypti was reintroduced in south Russia and in Madeira island (Portugal) . In 2010, dengue re-emerged in the French Riviera and Croatia, with small outbreaks. Two years later, in October 2012, a sustained and explosive epidemic appeared in Madeira Island. More than 100 travellers from different European countries acquired the infection after returned from the island. Preliminary analyses revealed that the outbreak was caused by DENV-1 possible introduced from Latin America. The aim of this study was to determine the most probable origin of the dengue virus introduced in Madeira, Portugal in 2012. We analyzed the E/NS1 junction and complete envelope sequences from imported dengue infections acquired by returning travellers from Madeira and Latin American countries.

The implementation of vector control activities is particularly challenging in urban and peri-urban areas, where the vector is well-established and thriving on proximity to humans. The search for novel, acceptable and affordable methods of vector control is ongoing.

Aestivation, starvation, and control experiments were set up for 30 days in the laboratory by placing three groups of snails collected in dry and rainy seasons from Oyan dam, Abeokuta in standard aestivation slope (30 B. globosus and 19 B. rohlfsi), aquarium (30 B. globosus and 23 B. rohlfsi) while control slope had 20 B. globosus and 15 B. rohlfsi. Aestivation and control slopes contained water and mixture of sand and clay (3:1) while aquarium contained water only for starvation. All the snails were fed on lettuce ad libitum for 28 days during which water was completely drained out in the aestivation slope. The aestivation slope and aquarium were left for another 30 days without lettuce. Snails were thereafter sacrificed and lipid contents in tissues and haemolymph determined.

Past case reports and recent data from LF mapping surveys indicate that LF occurs in Zambia, but no detailed studies have been carried out to document its epidemiology and health implications. The present study assessed infection, disease, transmission and human perception aspects of LF in an area of Luangwa District, South-East Zambia, as a background for planning and implemen-tation of control. Populations in two neighbouring rural communities were registered and a questionnaire survey undertaken. Clinical examinations, and screening of blood for circulating filarial antigens (CFA; marker of adult worm infection) and antibodies to Bm14 antigen (marker of exposure to transmission), was carried out during daytime. Blood from CFA positive individuals was examined for microfilariae (mf) at night. Vector surveys were carried out in selected households, using light traps. A total of 985 individuals aged \u00a1 Y 1 year were registered. The prevalence of CFA increased with age from 1.2% in age group 1-14 years to 20.6% in age group 50+ years (overall prevalence 8.6%). Wuchereria bancrofti mf were identified in 10.9% of CFA positive individuals. Prevalence and mean intensity of Bm14 antibodies were much higher in individuals aged \u00a1 Y 30 years (57.2%; 0.594) than in younger individuals (19.3%; 0.241). Elephantiasis and hydrocele were well known clinical manifestations in the area, and had local names, but only one case of hydrocele was detected in the study population. Identified potential vectors were Anopheles funestus and A. gambiae. LF was therefore endemic in the study community, but infection prevalence was low. The much higher prevalence and intensity of Bm14 antibodies in the older than the younger part of the population, and the low overall rate of clinical manifestations, suggest that transmission in the area is on the decrease, perhaps because of intensive application of malaria control measures targeting the Anopheles vectors. The last decades have witnessed a considerable increase in urbanization in Sub-Saharan Africa, and more than 50% of the population is estimated to live in urban areas by 2040. Rapid growth of cities, combined with limited economic opportunities, often result in expansion of informal settlements and slums with favourable conditions for proliferation of vectors of lymphatic filariasis (LF). In Dar es Salaam, which has grown more than 30 times in population during the past 50 years (4.4 million inhabitants in 2012), historical surveys indicate high prevalences of LF. This study investigated the epidemiology of LF in the metropolis of Dar es Salaam, as a background for planning and implementation of control. Six sites with varying distance from the city centre (3-30 km) and covering different population densities, socioeconomic characteristics, and water, sewerage and sanitary facilities were selected for the study. Pupils from one public primary school at each site were screened for circulating filarial antigen (CFA; marker of adult worm infection) and antibodies to Bm14 (marker of exposure to transmission). Community members were examined for CFA, microfilariae and chronic manifestations. Structured questionnaires were administered to pupils and heads of community households, and vector surveys were carried out in selected households. Despite haphazard urbanisation, and generally poorly developed water, sewerage and sanitation facilities, the study indicated that a tremendous decrease in burden of LF had occurred. Contributing factors may be urban malaria control targeting Anopheles vectors, short survival time of the otherwise numerous Culex quinquefasciatus vectors in the urban environment, widespread use of bed nets and other mosquito proofing measures, and mass drug administra-tion in 2006 and 2007. However, the burden of chronic LF disease manifestations was still high. The development has so far been promising, but continuing efforts are necessary to ensure elimination of LF as a public health problem. Mapping the spatial distribution of lymphatic filariasis is crucial for the planning and implementation of successful control. Recently there has been an increase in the application of the socalled climatic-based species distribution modeling methods, commonly applied within the field of ecology and conservation, for the mapping of a number of human pathogens, their vectors and hosts. Climate is considered to be the predominant rangedetermining mechanism for most species at large spatial scales, but ranges may also be controlled by other environmental or non-environmental factors. In the present study, based on national survey data on LF parasite prevalence, we employ species distribution modeling to make a first map of LF in Zambia. Specifically, we aim to identify the ecological correlates associated with different cut-offs of parasite prevalence (using remote sensing and other environmental data), and to use these correlates to develop maps that describe the presence of LF at two different prevalence levels (low and medium) at un-sampled areas across Zambia. The next logical step is to refine these maps using Bayesian geostatistical modelling to predict the exact prevalence at any given location in Zambia. Furthermore, potential interactions between LF and other mosquito-borne infections will be investigated, and geographical overlaps in spatial distributions and prevalence mapped. Maps of the distribution and risk of disease and areas where one or more parasitic infections overlap in space are useful from a control point of view, especially in light of recent years growing advocacy for integrated control of neglected tropical diseases. Background One of the challenges for monitoring helminth control programmes is the lack of a copro-parasitological goldstandard diagnostic technique which combines good sensitivity with quantitative performance, low cost, and easy-to-learn technique. The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare, the WHO recommended quantitative diagnostic technique (Kato-Katz) and the Mini-FLOTAC, an innovative method based on floatation of helminths eggs with two different solutions (FS2 saturated sodium chloride; FS7 zinc sulphate) using a close system (fill-FLOTAC) with 5% fixative.

Introduction Schistosomiasis control is heavily reliant on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). With no vaccine on the immediate horizon, and the ever-present spectre of PZQ-resistant schistosomes developing in communities undergoing mass drug administration (MDA) programmes, identifying next generation anthelmintics is urgently needed for sustaining deworming initiatives into the future. Towards this end, and due to the wellcharacterised therapeutic success of artemisinin, we have begun investigating the anthelmintic activities of natural products derived from temperate plants.

Although solid organ transplantation is an accepted option for both patients with HIV and for those with CD, in literature there is no mention of transplant in co-infected subjects. We describe the first case of a patient with CD and HIV co-infection, who successfully received heart transplant. Case Description A 42-year-old Brazilian was admitted to hospital for heart failure, with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25%. He also presented generalized lymphadenopathy and low white cell count, so a HIV test was done and found positive (at baseline, viral load: 53 325 copies/ml and CD4 cells count: 30 cells/mm 3 ). The patient was placed on highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) plus cotrimoxazole prophylaxis. Taking into account the patient's epidemiological background, the screening tests for Trypanosoma cruzi were done and resulted positive. Moreover, a reactivation of Chagas Disease was demonstrated through micro hematocrit tube technique (MHT), which demonstrated the presence of trypomastigotes of T. cruzi in the peripheral circulation. A course of benznidazole (5 mg/kg/day) was promptly initiated and appeared well tolerated. Unfortunately patient's cardiac dysfunction further worsened (LVEF reached 14%), despite inotropic support. Considering the patient's age and the good response to the antiretroviral and antitrypanosomal therapy (which permitted to reach undetectable HIV load and T. cruzi parasitemia), evaluation for heart transplant was sought. The patient was successfully transplanted, benznidazole was discontinued before transplant, after persistent demonstration of negative T. cruzi parasitemia and successful immune reconstitution. T. cruzi PCR follow-up was constantly negative in the posttransplant phase. Currently, 19 months after transplant, the patient is in good health conditions. Introduction Chagas disease is endemic in Latin America and an emerging disease in non-endemic countries due to the recent trends in migration. Benznidazole is the most commonly used drug for the etiological treatment. Patients treated with Benznidazole suffer frequent adverse drug reactions and whereas arthromyalgia is common arthritis has been reported as a very rare symptom. The objective of this study is to describe the importance and characteristics of arthritis as an adverse reaction of Benznidazole. Results One hundred and seventy-eight patients in chronic phase were treated with Benznidazole. Most of them were from Bolivia, women (75.8%), age ranged from 25 to 43. Treatment was interrupted in 45 patients (25.3%), five of them (11.1%) due to arthritis. Another case of arthritis was diagnosed 2 days after treatment was stopped due to dermatological adverse event. Arthritis developed in the six patients (3.4% of all treated) between day 25 and 42 after starting treatment. One case had additive arthritis, three oligoarthritis and two polyarthritis. In five of them was asymmetric. Autoimmunity test were normal in five out of six. All affected patients were treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids and the symptoms were solved in 7-62 days with no relapse or chronicity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "Conclusions We have observed that arthritis is more frequent than previously described in patients treated with Benznidazole and it can be the main reason for discontinue treatment. We did not find an established pattern of joint involvement and no patient developed chronic symptoms afterwards. It appears that Benzidazole can cause arthritis but there is no evidence that it could trigger a chronic autoimmune disease. P. 1.4.9.005 (B) Performance evaluation of enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and lineblot for serological diagnosis of Chagas (Trypanosoma cruzi) disease Chagas disease, caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects 8-11 million individuals worldwide. It is endemic from the south of the US to Central America and South America. The disease is commonly transmitted by an insect vector but may also be spread through blood transfusion and organ transplantation, ingestion of food contaminated with parasites and from a mother to her fetus. Without specific treatment, the mortality rate among such children is high. Early diagnosis is essential so that etiological treatment can be administered. Screening of donated blood, blood components, and solid organ donors, as well as donors of cells, tissues, and cell and tissue products for T. cruzi is mandated in all Chagasendemic countries and has been implemented. Due to travelling to endemic regions and immigration from endemic regions Chagas can be found also in Europe. Serodiagnosis of new borns is often difficult due to their altered immune system and maternal immunoglobulin still present in the blood. Here we describe a new Novalisa ELISA and lineblot for diagnosis of Chagas disease. These test systems are taking advantage of the chimeric multiepitope antigen TcF (IDRI). The test was evaluated in endemic countries like Colombia and Guatemala with chronic patients (symptomatic and asymptomatic), pregnant women and newborns and a Chagas negative control group. Overall performance of both testsystems, ELISA and blot, was excellent. In addition both new testsystems were the only one who could reliably detect congenital transmission of Chagas from a mother to the child, making it essential for screening of new borns in endemic countries to provide treatment as early as possible. In our hands NovaTec Immundiagnostica ELISA and blots can reveal positive patients that currently used in house tests can not detect. Results were confirmed by qRT-PCR and compared with results of other commercial kits. P. 1.4.9.006 (B) In vitro screening of synthetic compounds for antitrypanosomal activity and cytotoxicity to human MRC5 cells There are currently only four drugs approved for treating Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) caused by Trypanosma brucei rhodesiense or T. b. gambiense. These include suramin, pentamidine, melarsoprol and eflornithine. In Zambia, HAT is caused by T. b. rhodesiense and effective drugs are pentamidine and suramin for the early stage and only merlasoprol for the late stage of infection. The disadvantages of these drugs are that (i) they are not orally bioavailable, therefore administration needs hospitalization, (ii) their effectiveness varies with stage of infection, (iii) they have serious adverse effects. It is therefore, necessary to find new drugs with fewer disadvantages for effective management of HAT. The objective of this study was to determine the in vitro activity against T. b. rhodesiense and the cytotoxicity to human MRC5 cells of selected compounds. Several classes of synthetic compounds were subjected to primary screening for in vitro activity against T. b. rhodesiense resulting in 14 that had good anti-trypanosomal activity. The 14 compounds were subsequently screened for cytotoxic effects on human MRC5 cells and seven compounds had good selectivity indices which were >50. Preliminary results show that the IC50 values against T. b. rhodesiense for the seven compounds were as follows: TROH34 -2.83 mM; TRO35 -2.96 mM; TROH32 -3.13 mM; TROH30 -3.21 mM; TROH31 -3.95 mM; MHOH116 -4.13 mM and VMOH25 -4.6 mM, compared to 0.055 mM for pentamidine. The IC50 value against MRC5 cells for all the seven test compounds was >250 mM compared to >10 mM for pentamidine. The selectivity indices (SI) were as follows: TROH34 ->88.34; TROH35 ->84.46; TROH32 ->79.87; TROH30 ->77.88; TROH31 ->63.29; MHOH116 ->60.53 and VMOH25 ->54.34, compared to >181.82 for pentamidine. These results highlight some new classes of synthetic compounds that have promising activity against T. b. rhodesiense which require further investigations. Trypanosoma cruzi is responsible for Chagas disease which is a potentially fatal considerable endemic health problem in Latin America due to inadequate therapy and the lack of an effective vaccine [1] . The only drugs currently used worldwide for the treatment of Chagas disease are nifurtimox and benznidazole. However, they present significant side-effects and limited efficacy, especially in the chronic phase of the disease [2] . A series of new phthalazine derivatives containing side-chains ended with imidazole units attached to the pyridazine ring and nitro or hydroxyl substituents attached to the benzene ring were prepared. All in vitro and in vivo assays were performed according to the methodology previously established by us [3] . Compounds J22 and J24 were more active in vitro against T. cruzi and less toxic against Vero cells than the rest of analogues and the reference drug benznidazole ( Table 1 ). The amastigote forms were found the most sensitive form for the drugs. In vivo tests on the acute phase of Chagas disease gave parasitemia decreasing values reaching 68% for J24 at day 40 post-infection (Fig. 1A ) and the reactivation of parasitemia was found to be under 50% for J24 treated mice in the chronic phase after immunosuppression ( Fig. 1B) and IgG levels were keept in those which were treated (Fig. 1C ). The cure after the experiment (absence of parasites in the target organ) was found to be 33% and no evidence of toxicity in the biochemical profiles of kidney and liver was found. Attending to the mechanism of action, it was shown that compounds J22 and J24 highly inhibited the antioxidant parasite enzyme Fe-SOD which is one of the more important mechanism of escaping from the host defense. In conclusion compound J24 would be ready to continue to a clinical stage of testing.

P. 1.4.9.010 (B) 'Tsetse traps and why do we fear them?' Communitycentred tsetse control in Uganda There is renewed vigour in efforts to eliminate neglected tropical diseases including sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomi-asis). Towards this end, efforts are being made to develop more cost-effective methods of tsetse control. In the West Nile region of Uganda, novel designs of insecticide-treated target are being deployed over an area of~500 km 2 . The operational area covers villages where tsetse control has not been conducted previously. The effectiveness of the targets will depend, in part, on their acceptance by the local community. Accordingly, we assessed knowledge, perceptions and acceptance towards targets in villages where targets and traps had or had not been used previously. Sixteen Focus group discussions with male and female participants were conducted in eight villages across Arua District. Discussions were audio recorded, transcribed and translated. We used thematic analysis to compare the views of both groups and identify salient themes. Preliminary findings indicate that despite the villages being <10 km apart, community members perceived deployed baits very differently. Villagers who had never seen traps before expressed fear, anxiety and panic when they first encountered them. This was related to associations with witchcraft and 'river ghosts' which are linked with physical or mental illness, death and misfortune. By contrast, villagers living in areas where traps had been used previously had positive attitudes towards them and were fully aware of their purpose and benefits. The latter group reported that they had similar negative perceptions when tsetse control interventions first started a decade ago. Our results suggest that despite their apparent proximity, acceptance of traps varies markedly between villages and this is related to the duration of experience with tsetse control programs. The success of community-based interventions against tsetse will therefore depend on early sensitisation campaigns that reach all communities, especially those living in the areas new to such interventions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 247, "end": 260, "text": "1.4.9.010 (B)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results Five centres in referral hospitals in the Democratic"}, {"text": "Introduction Chagas disease was considered a disease linked to rural areas of Latin America.

Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by parasitic protozoa. The disease is endemic in 88 countries and an estimated 350 million people are at risk of infection. About 21 Leishmania species cause several clinical syndromes including visceral, cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis. Treatment is complicated by the complexities of this disease and the lack of data from clinical trials. The parasitology unit at Smittskyddsinstitutet (SMI) uses an integrated approach to the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. Methods include antibody detection, microscopy, in vitro culture and molecular diagnosis. Species differentiation is performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) since 2010 and prior to this monoclonal antibodies were used. A retrospective, descriptive study was performed to describe the specimens submitted for the molecular diagnosis of Leishmania in Sweden. The analysis included patient demographics, country of infection and Leishmania species. From January 2010 to April 2013, 147 specimens from 129 patients were received at SMI for molecular diagnosis. Of these specimens, 28% (41/147) were PCR-positive. Species differentiation was performed on 38 specimens from 33 patients; with the most common being L. major followed by L. donovani complex and L. tropica. Travel histories included the Middle East, Africa, Central and South America, Asia and southern Europe; with the majority of patients infected in Afghanistan. The ratio of male to female patients was 1.6:1 and the age range was 1-72 years. Twenty-six patients had cutaneous manifestations, six patients had symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis and one patient mucosal leishmaniasis.

It is associated with a range of clinical manifestations, from self-resolving cutaneous lesions to severe visceral leishmaniasis. The infecting species is an important determinant of disease phenotype; Leishmania donovani is the major causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis in Southeast Asia. However, in Sri Lanka, there have been over 2000 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. donovani in the past 10 years while only four cases of visceral leishmaniasis have been reported. To explain the scarcity of visceral leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka, we hypothesized that prior infection with the more prevalent cutaneous parasite protects against visceral disease. Two clinical L. donovani isolates were obtained, one from a cutaneous lesion (SL-CL) and one from a visceral leishmaniasis patient (SL-VL). BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with SL-CL and challenged intravenously with SL-VL. Significant protection following short-term immunization was observed in the liver for mice immunized with SL-CL doses of 10 4 and higher. Liver protection was durable (maintained at 3 months post-immunization) and did not require persistence of the immunizing parasite dose. Protection for the short-term challenge was associated with a mixed Th1/Th2 response prior to challenge, with higher IFNg and IL4 production in protected groups, and no antigen-specific IL10 production. The post-challenge immune response was similar for long-term and short-term challenge, with comparable IFNg production in all groups and elevated IL4 and IL10 production in protected groups. Given that most individuals exposed to Leishmania parasites do not develop symptomatic disease, exposure to the cutaneous L. donovani parasite in Sri Lanka may shift the balance towards enhanced asymptomatic cases, thereby leading to the observed low prevalence of visceral leishmaniasis. Finally, these results provide a framework for re-evaluating live immunization against visceral leishmaniasis and as such could guide leishmaniasis vaccine development efforts. Routine ELISAs for diagnosis of viserceral leishmaniasis currently rely on crude antigen preparations from parasites or on recombinant proteins as capture antigens, which are prone to batch to batch variation and to nonspecific cross reactivity. In contrast, synthetic peptides can be synthesized in large amounts, high purity and more reproducible quality. In this study we evaluated different synthetic peptides derived from the kinesin-like protein K39 sequence as coating antigens for serological diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis. Kinesin-like protein K39 is expressed in different variants by the donovani complex comprising Leishmania donovani, L. chagasi and L. infantum. The Cterminal region of the protein consists of a multi-repeat unit. Several sequences from the multi-repeat region were selected for synthesis, resulting in eight biotinylated peptides of 21-39 amino acids in length. Peptides were coated on streptavidin coated microtiter plates and tested in ELSIA with sera from patients with visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis, sera from other protozoan or helminthic infections, as well as negative sera from healthy blood donors. The sequence which showed the best sensitivity and specificity was the basis for creation of an artificial peptide with three identical short repeats. This peptide was coated as streptavidin-biotin complex on standard Immulon 2HB microtiter plates and was tested under routine ELISA conditions to determine sensitivity and specificity. Results show high reactivity with visceral leishmaniasis sera and reduced reactivity with cutaneous leishmaniasis sera, which is also described with whole recombinant K39 protein. We observed frequent cross-reactivity with sera from malaria patients, while less cross-reactivity was detected with sera from Chagas' and sleeping sickness patients. Our findings suggest that synthetic peptides are suitable antigens for serological diagnosis of parasitic infections, deliver more reproducible results and are generally easier to access.

Ascaris lumbricoides is the predominant soil-transmitted helminth (STH) in the Southern Province of Rwanda. School-based deworming is applied twice annually but its actual effectiveness is unknown. In the area of Butare, we assessed factors associated with A. lumbricoides-infection and the effectiveness of preventive chemotherapy. Children were recruited at one urban and one rural school. Stool samples were collected before mebendazole treatment (500 mg single dose), and after 2 and 12 weeks, respectively. STHs were diagnosed by microscopy of Kato-Katz slides and by PCR assays for A. lumbricoides. Socio-economic status and proximate risk factors for STH infection were assessed by structured questionnaires. Pre-treatment stool samples were collected from 333 urban and 329 rural school children (median age, 10 years; range, 5-17). By microscopy, 17.2% of the children harboured STHs (A. lumbricoides, 16.0%; Trichuris trichiura, 1.8%; hookworm, 0.3%), three quarters of infections being of light intensity. Adding PCR results, the pretreatment prevalence of A. lumbricoides was 24.0% which declined to 1.8% 2 weeks after deworming and increased to 6.8% after further 10 weeks. Of the initially A. lumbricoides infected children, 5.9% and 18.0% harboured the parasite 2 and 12 weeks, respectively, following treatment. At recruitment, A. lumbricoides was more common in rural (37%) than in urban (11%) school children. Further associated factors included low socio-economic status, water supply, and garbage disposal, among others. Similar factors were linked to re-infection.

Tungiasis (sand flea disease) is a neglected tropical disease associated with debilitating acute and mutilating chronic morbidity. Hitherto, there is no effective drug treatment. In the endemic areas patients attempt to remove embedded sand fleas with inappropriate sharp instruments, a hazardous procedure by itself. The efficacy of a topical application of a mixture of two dimeticones of low viscosity (NYDA \u00e2 ) on embedded sand fleas was assessed in 47 school children in rural Kenya. It was compared to bathing the feet in 0.05% KMnO4 (the traditional treatment in Kenya). The viability of the parasites was assessed through a handheld digital video microscope and the degree of inflammation was determined by an inflammation score. The lesions were observed daily during 7 days. In the dimeticone group, 78% (95% CI 67-86%) of the embedded sand fleas had lost all viability signs after 7 days. In the KMnO4 group viability signs disappeared in 39% (95% CI 28-52%; P \u2264 0.001). The inflammation score decreased from 6 to 4.75 points in the dimeticone group (P < 0.001), but remained unchanged in the KMnO4 group (4.5 vs. 5 points). Based on the established physical mode of action of dimeticones on other ectoparasites, it is assumed that NYDA \u00e2 rapidly crept into the respiratory tract of the embedded sand fleas and caused death through hypoxia. In view of the efficacy and safety of dimeticones, the hazardous extraction of embedded sand fleas with sharp instruments is no longer warrantable. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Toll-like receptors (TLR) have been linked to susceptibility to human malaria in epidemiological studies. However, their functional roles still remain unclear. Plasmodium falciparum is reportedly recognized by TLR2 (TLR2/1, TLR2/6), among others. We investigated the impact of common functional TLR1 and TLR6 SNPs on the cytokine response towards P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (iRBCs). Malaria-naive, healthy blood donors were screened for TLR SNPs (TLR-1, TLR-6, TLR-2 etc.). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes were isolated from blood samples and co-cultivated with iRBCs. Supernatant cytokine concentrations were determined by ELISA. IL-1\u00df and IL-6 responses of human monocytes towards iRBC showed heterogeneity between monocyte donors and depended on the ratio of effector cell to iRBC. Monocytes from malaria-na\u20ac \u0131ve donors with TLR-variants associated with increased risks of malaria (TLR1 I602S; TLR6 S249P) showed reduced release of IL-1\u00df and IL-6 in response to iRBC. Homozygous TLR-6 249P revealed a pronounced effect of reduced iRBC-stimulated IL-6 production. Cytokine responses were lowest for monocytes from donors with both SNPs. In a West African population, both SNPs were found to be remarkably scarce. TLR SNPs associated with increased malaria risk correspond to a reduced monocyte production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to exposure with P. falciparum. This suggests a functional role of the SNPs and of the respective TLRs in susceptibility to malaria.

Moreover, the estimated number of deaths due to malaria was 655 000, of which 91% still took place in Africa. Yet, results of effective intervention studies suggest that the true number could even be higher because of indirect effects of the disease on other health related issues like anemia. Therefore the aim of the study was to search for the correlation between the presences of malaria infection due to Plasmodium falciparum and anemia in a highly endemic area in children under 5 years of age. A cross sectional household based survey was conducted in the Health Zone of Mont Ngafula1, Kinshasa, during the dry season from April to August 2012.

In the present study, therefore, we attempt to investigate if nRBC apoptosis is associated with peripheral RBC count, para-site load or immune response. To this end, Balb/c mice were intraperitonially infected with P. yoelii 17XL and, then, nRBC apoptosis as well as number of peripheral RBC, parasitaemia and plasmatic levels of cytokines, nitric oxide and anti-RBC antibodies were evaluated at early and late anaemia stages, days 4 and 7 post infection, respectively. Apoptosis of nRBC was increased only at the late stage and it was associated to parasite load, but not to the intensity of the immune response. In spite of increased percents of nRBC apoptosis observed when the anaemia was accentuated, this increase was not related to the reduction of peripheral RBC counts, suggesting that apoptosis is not significantly implicated in anaemia observed in the malaria model studied herein. We conclude that nRBC apoptosis in P. yoelii malaria seems to be induced in response to high parasite load and that further studies on malaria models in which acute anaemia develop under low parasite burden are needed to identify the potential pathogenic role of nRBC apoptosis.

The pharmacokinetics of total radioactivity and of pyronaridine in blood were evaluated. Total radioactivity in urine, feces, and blood samples was determined by accelerator mass spectrometry. Pyronaridine concentrations in blood were determined by LC/MS, and metabolite identification performed using LC/MS/MS.

Metabolite characterization allowed for identification of nine primary and four secondary metabolites of pyronaridine, with prominent pathways for metabolite formation including N-dearylation, glucuronidation, and oxidation.

The 3D7 group A PFD1235w PfEMP-1 has been associated with severe malaria and erythrocytes infected with parasites expressing PFD1235w bind to ICAM-1, a phenotype linked with the development of cerebral malaria. We have previously identified pfd1235w-like genes and found these to encode a DBLa1.4-CI-DRa1.6-DBLb3 domain cassette (DC4) of which the DBLb3 domains has been shown to bind ICAM-1. To identify the molecular determinants of adhesion, we used 3D protein modeling, created and expressed hybrid and substituted protein molecules and used these in ICAM-1 binding assays. Using this approach we identified a minimal PfEMP-1 binding epitope necessary and sufficient for the PFD1235w::ICAM-1 interaction. These results might have implications for the identification of parasites with an ICAM-1 binding phenotype and for the development of therapeutic interventions targeting such malaria parasites. P. 1.5.5.003 (B) Characterisation the binding of Plasmodium falciparum isolates that express ICAM-1-binding DBLb domains Adhesion between Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes (IE) and different receptors on endothelial cells is a key factor in malaria pathogenesis. ICAM-1 binding by IE is thought to be associated with cerebral malaria. Several studies have identified some DBLb domains as ligands for ICAM-1. This study identified the binding phenotypes of five IT lineage isolates that encode ICAM-1-binding DBL-b domains in their PfEMP-1s to ICAM-1Ref and four mutant ICAM-1 proteins using static assays. Our data show that different strains have different binding patterns to ICAM-1 and the mutant proteins. The study also examined the inhibition caused by four anti-ICAM-1 mAbs on the binding of IE to ICAM-1Ref under static conditions with variable inhibitory effects. The data acquired from these experiments emphasise the variation in the contact residues of ICAM-1 by different parasite isolates. Cytoadhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to endothelial cells lining the micro vessels of host organs is mainly linked to severe malaria infection. Cytoadhesion is mediated through the binding of P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP-1) to various host receptors including Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1), which has a role in cerebral malaria. In our study, we aim to develop monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the potential adhesive Duffy Binding Like (DBL\u00e2) domains of PfEMP-1 from ICAM-1 binding parasites. mAbs were raised against four recombinant proteins namely rDBL13, rDBL27, rDBL31 and rDBL41. We developed thirteen distinct monoclonal and polyclonal hybridoma clones that secrete IgM-class antibodies capable of recognizing the immunizing rDBL\u00e2 proteins. Flow cytometry results indicated that at least five monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies significantly labelled the surface of erythrocytes infected with IT4var16, IT4var14, IT4var13 and IT4var1 strains. These data suggest that oligomeric IgM may be developped to interfere with the ability of parasitized erythrocytes (PEs) to sequester and thereby reduce the mortality rate of cerebral malaria infection.

Background Population movements along the Thailand-Cambodia border, particularly among highly mobile and hardto-access migrant groups from Cambodia and Myanmar, are assumed to play a key role in the spread of artemisinin resistance.

Reaching out to highly mobile migrants with health messaging they can understand and malaria diagnosis and treatment services they can access is imperative in the effort to contain the spread of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum. The Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes are considerable one of the most important malaria vectors in Africa. Genomic and proteomic tools have been used to improve knowledge on the biology of mosquitos, providing relevant information to malaria control. The salivary glands (SG) have a central role in the parasite-vector-host interactions being fundamental not only in feeding but on pathogen transmission as well. The goal of this study is to identify and functionally characterize genes differentially expressed in the SG of A. gambiae mosquitoes in response to Plasmodium berghei infection. Three days-old A. gambiae mosquitoes were fed on mice uninfected abd infected with P. berghei. After 18 days, the SGs were removed for RNA extraction. The identification of genes was obtained by using direct RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in an Illumina \u00e2 GA IIX platform. The obtained reads were subsequently aligned using the software Bowtie (2.0) and then assessed by using the differential expression DESeq \u00e2 program. After RNA-Seq, and using the Z test Kal with P < 0.05, 2623 genes were found to be differentially expressed, from which, 1594 genes were significantly overexpressed and 1029 downexpressed in infected mosquitoes. Information on genes found to be differentially expressed in A. gambiae SG after P. berghei infection results in a valuable tool for future studies. After confirmation of differential expression by real-time RT-PCR, gene knockdown assays will allow to enlarge our knowledge on their role in malaria infection and contribute to disease control. The impact of transfusional malaria represents a challenge for blood banks due to the increasing number of individuals moving globally. Despite the advances in blood screening aiming a safe transfusion, the choice for a reliable test is not simple, since is necessary to consider sensitivity, specificity, cost and applicability in large amount of samples. Data on the frequency of transfusional malaria show values from 0.2/million units of blood in non-endemic countries to 50 in areas with transmission. In our experience we detected several cases of symptomless donors with low parasitemias only detected by PCR that had transmitted infections. In a previous study we found that assays using pools are comparable to the individual analysis, and could be applied in hemotherapy services. Here we describe advantages of real time PCR protocols, reducing the processing time and cost. A total of 9280 blood samples from 147 Brazilian blood banks were arranged in 10 samples/pool. Real-time PCR was applied for genus-specific amplification targeting the ssrRNA 18S gene. Reaction was prepared with TaqMan \u00e2 Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), primers M60/M61 and probe M62 marked with FAM \u2122 and TAMRA \u2122 , assayed in duplicate. The second protocol used the same primers assayed with EvaGreen (Biotium) reagents. From the 928 pools tested by Real Time PCR, the Taq-Man protocol detected 30 positive, with Cts lower than the cutoff (37.28). The EvaGreen protocol showed DNA amplification in 23 pools. Our results showed that 3.2% of pools assayed by real-time PCR amplified Plasmodium gDNA. The performance of this technique on pooled samples was similar when compared to the individual processing of our previous study. The earlier results show the superiority of TaqMan probe when compared to the EvaGreen protocol, which is less expensive. As this PCR is being standardized, the performance could be improved by means of changes in reaction parameters.

In endemic countries with limited resources, diagnosis of malaria is often based on clinical signs while the method is quite unreliable. Nowadays, parasitological confirmation through microscopy or malaria rapid diagnostic test (MRDT) is currently recommended for each suspected case. In the field, many obstacles are found for the accurate use of microscopy. Therefore, the use of MRDT is promoted as a good alternative in African countries. However, there is limited information about accuracy and predictive value of MRDT in population based surveys of malaria prevalence, where asymptomatic people are more likely to have lower parasitemia than in clinical settings. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of MRDT and the prevalence of malaria infection in children under 5 years of age through a cross sectional household based survey conducted in the high transmission settings of the Health Zone of Mont Ngafula1 during the dry season from April to August 2012. A total of 800 children aged 3-59 months were included. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values with their CI95% of MRDT using microscopy as the gold standard were respectively 93.5% (90.0-97.1), 81.1% (77.9-84.2), 60.6% (55.0-66.3) and 97.5% (96.2-98.9) in the overall study population. The prevalence of malaria was of 24.9% (CI 95%: 21.0-26.7) with microscopy and 38.1% (CI 95% 33.9-40.6) with MRDT. A disadvantage of the MRDT is that in opposition to microscopy it does not allow to establish a threshold within symptomatic patients to assess malaria related fever. This is a main issue in endemic areas like our study site where up to a quarter of the children had the infection without having the disease. Pregnant women and children are the main risk groups for malaria. Plasmodium falciparum in pregnant women has been widely investigated worldwide, but there are few data about the interaction with other species. P. vivax is responsible for most cases in Asia and in Central and South Americas, with reports of morbidity and anemia in pregnant women and underweight in children. In Brazil the majority of cases occur in the Amazon basin, but there is still transmission in areas covered by Atlantic Forest, where asymptomatic infections occur. In Sao Paulo State, about 10% of the autochthonous infections are asymptomatic. In the city of Juquitiba, Sao Paulo, outbreaks are recorded, with occurrence of P. vivax and P. malariae. This study is unprecedented in this region and aims to follow-up pregnant women each 3 months to verify the occurrence of Plasmodium in this immunosuppressed cohort through the gold standard method and an advanced molecular diagnostic tool. During a period of 5 months, 83 pregnant women were enrolled in a prospective cohort. Blood samples were collected each 3 months in vacuum tubes, and thick blood smears were confectioned. Real-time PCR was performed for detection of Plasmodium genomic DNA, targeting the ssrRNA 18S gene. The reactions assayed in duplicate were prepared with TaqMan \u00e2 Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), primers M60/M61 and probe M62 labeled with FAM \u2122 and TAMRA \u2122 . The genus-specific real time PCR detected Plasmodium DNA in samples of three pregnant women, with Cts lower than the cut-off (37.15). Thick blood smears examination showed one positive sample. This study shows that asymptomatic cases are still happening in areas of very low endemicity for malaria, and even more alarming is the fact of the occurrence in immunosuppressed cohorts, as the pregnant women. This study is ongoing. The casuistic will be increased and immunological parameters will be evaluated.

The diagnosis of Malaria disease is essential to provide early treatment and improve the prognosis of patients. Serological methods often fail in diagnosing new borns due to their altered immune system, resulting in a need for new diagnostic methods reliably working with sample from patients ranging from 0 to 12 month of age. Transfusion-transmitted Malaria is rare, but it may produce severe problems in the safety of blood transfusion and blood related products due to the lack of reliable procedure to evaluate donors potentially exposed to malaria. Microscopy, still considered as gold standard for diagnosing malaria, is time consuming and requires trained expertise. Moreover errors occasionally occur especially at low parasitaemia limiting its use in blood banking and screening of populations. PCR shows a high sensitivity even at low parasitaemia and can distinguish between different Plasmodium species but it is expensive and a state of the art laboratory is needed. ELISAs are known to be ideal for high throughput screening with a high sensitivity and specificity but also here trained personal and an equipped laboratory is needed. Line blots are often used as confirmatory tests since they provide a high sensitivity and specificity. There is nearly no lab equipment needed to perform this kind of assay. In addition blots can be used in automated processes for high throughput screening. In our study blots seem to be a good tool for diagnosing malaria in new borns.

Acute phase diagnosis relies on molecular testing. If not locally available it requires shipment of frozen samples to reference laboratories. Molecular diagnosis tools are often absents in low resources and remote areas and frozen shipment is not possible. Filter paper (FP) spotted serum or whole blood is exempted from dangerous goods regulations. In order to overcome the difficulties in the shipment of samples we developed a protocol for leptospirosis diagnosis by PCR from FPdried serum or whole blood. We received samples from different South Pacific islands including Santa Cruz Island (Solomon Islands) and Yap State (Federated States of Micronesia). At the time of initial consultation, venous or capillary blood samples were collected and spotted on FP. The FP-dried samples were then sent to our lab (French Polynesia) by standard mail at ambient temperature. As our extraction protocol allows both DNA and RNA extraction, the same extracts were submitted to leptospirosis real-time PCR and dengue virus multiplex reverse transcription real-time PCR. On the 172 FP-dried samples collected from dengue suspected patients in Yap State, five were leptospirosis PCR positives. On the 37 FP-dried samples collected from Santa Cruz Island, also five were leptospirosis PCR positives (four had initially suspected malaria infection and one had suspected otitis). Using the same protocol we confirmed that dengue virus serotype 2 was still circulating inYap State. We previously demonstrated the interest of using FP-dried samples for dengue surveillance in the Pacific. This protocol is now validated for leptospirosis. It is a potentially powerful tool to enhance leptospirosis and other infectious diseases surveillance capacity in the Pacific and in other remote or resource-poor regions.

We identified eight patients with active tuberculosis during TNF-a inhibitor therapy by retrospective review of the clinical charts. The indication for treatment was rheumatoid arthritis in 4, Behcet's disease in 2, Erythema nodosum in 1 and Crohn's disease in 1 patient. Four patients received infliximab, two adalimumab, one certolizumab and one a series of TNF-a inhibitors. The patient group consists of seven women and one man.

The gold standard for diagnosis is culture, but its clinical utility is limited because of the time required to obtain results. In resource-limited settings, PTB is usually confirmed by sputum smear microscopy. This method is insensitive and many patients are clinically diagnosed as having smear-negative PTB, but their diagnosis remains uncertain and they often have poor treatment adherence.

Most human cases of cryptosporidiosis are caused by Cryptosporidium hominis, which mainly infects humans, and C. parvum, a species with a confirmed zoonotic potential. The use of molecular methods has revealed that several other species, like C. canis and C. felis (naturally infecting dogs and cats respectively) also can cause human infection. However, recent findings suggest that most of these infections, which mainly occur in developing countries, are caused by anthroponotic rather than zoonotic transmission. Thus the role of companion animals in human cryptosporidiosis is not clear. Here we have investigated a case of suspected zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis in Sweden. Stool samples from a cat and a women, both suffering from diarrhoea and living in the same household, were analysed using microscopy after modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining and PCR-RFLP analysis of the COWP and SSU rRNA genes followed by sequencing. Microscopy of stool samples from both individuals showed the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts, while molecular analysis confirmed the presence of C. felis. We report the first confirmed case of cryptosporidiosis caused by transmis-sion of C. felis between a cat and a human living in the same household. Due to the fact that the cat developed symptoms before the patient, and that human cryptosporidiosis caused by C. felis is a rare occurrence in Sweden, we consider it probable that the cat was the initial source of infection, and not the opposite.

The last epidemic of yellow fever in Europe was in 1861 in St. Nazaire, a port city in France. But in the last 10 years, cases of yellow fever have been imported from Africa or South America into Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. These countries are north of the range of the urban vector, Aedes aegypti, so there was no epidemic risk from that mosquito. But another urban vector, Ae. albopictus, has become established in those 3 and 12 more European countries. In 2007, a single individual infected with chikungunya virus arrived from India in northern Italy, outside the range of Ae. aegypti. He sparked an epidemic vectored by Ae. albopictus. Europe is now vulnerable to importations of yellow fever. Non-stop airline flights between endemic areas of South America and Africa can bring passengers incubating the virus to major European cities within 24 h, where they can fall ill and infect local mosquitoes. There have recently been urban outbreaks of yellow fever in the capital cities of Asuncion, Paraguay and Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, which have international airports serving intercontinental flights. Countries in Europe where those and similar flights land should be on the lookout for cases. Unless the physician seeing a case elicits a travel history from an endemic country, yellow fever would never be suspected. ProMED <www.promedmail.org> was searched for upto-date news of yellow fever outbreaks in the endemic zones, and the spread of the vector mosquito species. The results will be presented. Insecticide spraying of aircraft cabins is not sufficient alone. The conclusion is that the present risk of a yellow fever epidemic in Europe is real, and contingency planning is urgently needed.

Many areas of the world struck hardest by the HIV epidemic also bear the heaviest burden of helminth infections (including the tissue invasive filariae), with the result that HIV/helminth coinfections are not uncommon. Several studies have examined clinical outcomes in HIV/helminth co-infected individuals, but none of these studies has focused on the underlying mechanisms of immune interactions. In the current study, we used cryopreserved samples from HIV-positive individuals with (HIV+Wb+; n = 6) or without (HIV+Wb\u00c0; n = 9) W. bancrofti infection in South India to interrogate the effect of filarial co-infection on HIV-specific T cell responses. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we examined cytotoxic potential (perforin and CD107a) and cytokine production (IFN-c, IL-2, MIP-1a) in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in response to an HIV-Gag peptide pool, and also evaluated the expression of molecules associated with exhaustion (e.g., PD-1). CD8+ T cells represented a significantly greater proportion of total T cells in HIV+Wb+ individuals compared with HIV+Wb\u00c0 individuals (P = 0.0176), and these T cells appeared to be more activated globally: they had a smaller na\u20ac \u0131ve T cell compartment, higher expression of cytotoxic markers, and more spontaneous cytokine production. CD8+ T cells from HIV+Wb+ individuals had a greater prevalence of PD-1+ cells than did CD8+ T cells from the HIV+Wb\u00c0 patients (41.4% vs. 21.9%) a feature associated with exhaustion following chronic activation. Furthermore, although mitogen-induced responses were not different between the two groups, Gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses were markedly different: Gag stimulation caused a decrease in the frequency of IFN-c+ and MIP-1a+ cells among CD8+ T cells from the HIV+Wb+ group (by 17% and 3%, respectively), whereas it induced increases in these cytokine-positive populations by 54% and 135%, respectively, among CD8+ T cells from the HIV+Wb\u00c0 group.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the causing agent of trichomoniasis, the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection in humans. Previous studies showed that many biological and pathological processes in T. vaginalis are iron dependent. However, the mechanism of iron-regulated gene expression network is still largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of iron on the growth of T. vaginalis. The parasite exhibits growth arrest and transforms to pseudocyst in the presence of the permeable iron chelator dipyridyl (DIP), speculating iron is crucial for proliferation of this protist. To analyze the mechanisms that required for survival under iron stress, we employed next generation sequencing technology to compare the transcriptome of T. vaginalis grown in different iron availabilities. We found that ubiquitin, a major component of the proteasomedependent proteolysis system is highly expressed in iron-deficient cells. In order to elucidate the roles of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in iron-stressed T. vaginalis, we monitored the growth of cells treated with proteasome inhibitor, MG132. The growth curve showed that proteasome is important for life maintenance in iron-deficient group compared with MG-132-untreated group. Iron-deficiency might cause cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation because ROS scavengers require iron as electron acceptor. We showed that the intracellular ROS level in iron-deficient group is higher than iron-rich group, but the highest level is shown in MG-132 treated T. vaginalis. Thus, one of the roles of UPS in T. vaginalis is ROS clearance. These data indicate that UPS is crucial for T. vaginalis survival under iron stress, which might provide a new insight for new drug development.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "The effects of community-based reproductive health workers on the utilization of family planning services in Yemen F.

New strategies are needed in order to inform and motivate the donors. Ensuring good standards of clinical governance is crucial to providing effective health care in resource poor settings. Unfortunately, implementing clinical audit in these settings is often beset by practical issues. We propose a method of out-sourcing the burden of data analysis to facilitating regular audit in resource poor settings. Critical to this is the development of a cheap and quick system to gather data for remote auditing. We investigated the feasibility of using an inexpensive 12-megapixel point-andshoot digital camera to collect data from clinical notes in a format capable of being sent via secure electronic file transfer for remote analysis. We photographed a random selection of 20 anonymised clinical records, from among 1000, of the HIV outpatient clinic of Cecilia Makiwane Hospital, East London, South Africa. We recorded the time taken to retrieve and photograph each record and evaluated digital images for legibility and whether information on use of the antiretroviral drug Tenofovir, suitable for clinical audit, could be retrieved from these images at a later time. Specifically, we audited whether antiretroviral drug name and creatinine clearance were recorded at baseline, months 3 and 6, and then every 12 months thereafter, in line with the latest South African Department of Health Standard Treatment Guidelines. The time to retrieve and photograph each of the 12 records ranged from 90 s to 5 min, with a mean of 2.5 min. Seven of the patients were receiving tenofovir. None of the records indicated, either in the notes or by inference from results, that blood for creatinine clearance measurement had been taken according to clinical guidelines. In this proof of concept feasibility study we demonstrated a reliable, cheap and quick method to digitise clinical records in an electronically transferable format, offering a way to facilitate standardised and large scale collection of auditable data.

Available medicines are difficult to access because of high patient fees. As a result of low utilization rates, the surveillance system based on health structure data fails to pick up increases in infectious diseases. When alert is given, there are important delays in response from the health system; additional supplies are late to arrive, there is reluctance to waive fees to allow cases to come and get treated and mobilization of additional resources from international partners already active in the district proved slow. The presence of international donor support did not show a significant difference in response potential. A critical review of health systems strengthening efforts is needed, in order to include measures and mechanisms to improve effective reaction to outbreaks of the health services. The history of health and health care in Okinawa from the end of World War II to the present offers many lessons that could be useful in planning, managing and providing health care in developing countries. Many of the problems faced then by Okinawa are still major problems in many countries those problems included scarcity and mal-distribution of health personnel, and generally poor public health. Just after the war, there were only 64 doctors in Okinawa. This was a third the number before the war. As the few doctors available shifted to work in the hospitals that were being built or rebuilt, doctors who could work at the clinics in remote islands and other remote areas were in increasingly short supply. As an immediate measure to deal with that problem, public health nurses (PHNs) have played key roles in disease prevention and control and in providing health services in remote areas of Okinawa, by managing their postings and provide the professional supervision and support they needed. Several lesson learned from the Okinawa's PHN posting system; leadership, quality and dedication of trainees, clearly defined role and responsibilities, safety, adequate housing and workplaces in communities, regular contacts and exchanges with supervisors and colleagues, etc. Although this 'excellent' system was abolished in Japan when the health systems were decentralized by enforcement of public health law in 1997, the similar effective approaches to tackle with the difficulties in posting 'qualified' mid-level practitioners to communities have been existing, such as in Ghana; in order to functioning community-based health planning and services (CHIPS) with posting community health officers (CHOs) at remote areas. The presentation will be focused on the comparison among some challenges of posting human resources for health in remote settings, and what are the key issues to achieve the goals through Okinawa's lessons. Since 2011 the public health system in Burkina has been marked by on-going conflicts with strikes and full closure of all public health facilities orchestrated by the unions of the health care providers and in one case an attempt to burn down a dispensary by angry community members. How has the conflict(s) in a country already affected by regional instability and widespread poverty marked the ways people perceive state sponsored services? This study seeks to complement existing knowledge on utilization of primary health facilities in developing countries with an investigation of whether the concept of trust is of relevance to the study of public health services, especially in times of conflicts. The study is based on an on-going doctoral work in a rural area using ethnographic methods including long term fieldwork, indepth individual interviews with patients and therapy managers, FGDs, document analysis and clinical observations combined with a survey. The study found that in spite of the fact that the public dispensary has little to dispense people increasingly seek treatment here, especially for signs of fever and for infant sickness. The patient-provider interaction is characterized by asymmetric power and patients are routinely subject to rough treatment. Because of the unequal power relations people have to trust the good intentions of the providers. However, the longer the conflict lasted the more people started to doubt their good intentions and loyalty to the community. Rather than representing a radical rupture in the way people expect the health system to function, the conflict was perceived as a continuation of the disappointments that people in rural areas encounter in their contact with public sector. The conflict was found to have a negative impact on the way people in rural perceive state sponsored health services and trust between users and the system was gradually broken. Material and Methods Microbiological analyses were carried out on the sources used by the people and along the supply chain.

In determining these core elements, this paper shall investigate whether the decentralization of health and health care services in Kenya is among the methods developing countries can utilise to achieve the right to health. The health related Millennium Development Goals are specific. The right to health is addressed through three MDGs; one, to reduce child mortality (MDG 3), two, to improve maternal health (MDG 4) and three, to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases (MDG 5) . These MDGs may soon be succeeded either by the goal of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as access to needed, good quality health servicespromotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitationfor everyone, without the risk of financial hardship as a result of having to pay to access these services, or by the proposed Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) as favoured by the states collectively referred to as BRICS. However, the process of achieving the right to health either through UHC or SDGs must encompass the demands of 'progressive realization' of the core elements of the right to health. Accordingly, this paper shall consider the following 'model' core elements in ensuring that Kenya is moving towards achieving the right to health; firstly; financing the right to health through decentralized taxation, secondly; the availability, accessibility, affordability and quality (AAAQ) of essential medicines and thirdly; the importance of health workers and their regulation administratively and financially. In a global development context where the ideologies of the privileged few have defined the way forward for the rest of the world for almost 15 years, greater global interaction is required in contributing to 'a decent life for all'. As a regional hub for Go4Health, an international consortium of academics and members of civil society assigned by the European Commission to aid the formulation of new health development goals (NHDGs), we believe it is imperative that a strong interaction exist between North and South in order for NHDGs, in their push toward universal health coverage, to truly address the health needs of people all over the world. Our qualitative study consults with marginalized communities across Asia whose health inequities can be attributed to the acronym PROGRESS. In gaining an understanding of their essential health needs as well as their understanding of their right to health entitlements we seek to give voice to those whose voices are neither locally nor globally heardto ensure that their needs are addressed in the post-Millennium Development Goal (MDG) global health policy agenda. Consultations with communities thus far indicate a need for improved access to services as well as reliable and accountable health systems. Ensuring that effective, accessible and accountable health systems and services function across the world are a collective responsibility, whereby both national governments and international governments and organizations must come up with clear guidelines not only around health targets but how those targets will come about to ensure that everybody can enjoy good health. Such an outcome can only rise out of continuous and inclusive international dialogue which in turn will lead to the creation of health policies that are truly global and address the needs of all, including those who cannot yet enjoy the basic human right to health. framework for achieving a 'more peaceful, prosperous and just world'. This framework was condensed into eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), to be achieved by 2015.

In response to demands, numerous internships in developing countries are being offered to medical residents. To avoid having these internships become part of medical tourism it is necessary to have the appropriate professorial supervision. In some universities, teachers accompany students while others rely on the host country professorial structure. Both options have pros and cons but neither one seems to be superior. Over the last number of years, the idea of transcultural supervision (also referred to as cross-supervision) has evolved. This concept consists in sharing professorial resources with those of the host country to supervise all residents, whether they are from the visiting or the host country. The success of this approach requires a number of prerequisites. One only has to think of the preparation of professors and students prior to the internship regarding the knowledge of the culture, of the language, of the customs, and of the social and religious context. It is also necessary to prepare host teachers for the arrival of foreign students and teachers.

The project includes both field (Sweden, Switzerland, and Lithuania) and laboratory (Denmark) investigations. In Sweden, Arvicolinae rodents and fox feces/scat are investigated in two low endemic areas of the parasite. Collection methods will provide density estimates of both rodent and fox populations. Collected rodents will be dissected and the livers visually examined for helminths. Samples from suspect liver lesions and parasite eggs isolated from fox feces will be tested for Echinococcus DNA using standardized PCR protocols. Feces will also be analyzed to determine fox diet. Fieldwork will occur in spring and fall with the first collection completed Spring 2013. Experimental investigations will be conducted to determine the susceptibility and stages of parasite development in each rodent species tested. Experiments are currently underway in Denmark using the field vole (Microtus agrestis). Ideally, future experiments will be planned involving the most abundant species native for Sweden (i.e. Myodes glareolus and Arvicola amphibius). At the conclusion of the EMIRO project, results from the four partner countries will be combined in the hope of better understanding of the ecology of the target rodent species, their susceptibility to the parasite, and their relationship to the fox.

This study shows development beyond this larval stage in muskoxen. Whether development to subsequent larval instars or into adult flies is possible regarding H. tarandi with muskoxen as hosts is not known. There are no records of complete development of H. tarandi in humans. However, the reported cases of ophthalmomyiasis caused by H. tarandi, which often lead to loss of sight, are of concern.

Altwaim, D. Xia and J. Wastling Department of Infection Biology, Institute of Infection and Global health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum are intracellular protozoan parasites from the phylum Apicomplexa. Both parasites share many morphological and genetic features, but have diverse host preferences. While T. gondii can infect any warm-blooded animal including humans, N. caninum does not infect humans and is widely spread through vertical transmission in cattle. In immunosuppressed individuals, the chronic stage of T. gondii can cause Toxoplasma encephalitis, whereas neosporosis results in neuromuscular disease in dogs and abortion in cattle. The basis of host preference in these two parasites is unknown, but could be due to differences in tropism to specific host cells. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the differential expression of host-cell and parasite genes/proteins during the invasion of human astrocyte (HA) cells by both Toxoplasma and Neospora. Parasites and HAs were cultured in vitro; cells were infected with type III T. gondii VEG strain and N. caninum Liverpool isolate strain. Samples were collected at 0, 4 and 16 h post infection for both transcriptomic and label-free proteomic analysis. A number of differences in host cell responses were noted between Toxoplasma and Neospora infection. Among these were differences in expression related to the type1 interferon pathway in N. caninum infected cells. In addition, the transcriptomics data from T. gondii suggests the up-regulation of various suppressive factors that prevent activation of the host response. These data suggest that the two parasites stimulate some fundamentally different host cell responses, with Nesopora, surprisingly, acting more like a 'virus infection' than an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite. Diagnosis of intestinal parasites is depending on microscopic examination of stool specimens. This study aimed at comparing detection of intestinal parasites from single fresh unpreserved stool sample versus sodium acetate acetic acid formalin (SAF)preserved pooled samples, and stained with chlorazol black dye in routine practice. Unpreserved samples were collected from 120 patients and represented as Group I. Other three SAF-preserved samples were collected from the same patients over a 6 day period and represented as Group IIa, IIb, IIc. The latter group was equally subdivided into two subgroups. The first subgroup of each of the three samples was examined individually, whereas the second subgroup of each were pooled and examined as a single specimen. All groups were examined by the routine diagnostic techniques, however, in group II when the diagnosis was uncertain, the chlorazol black dye staining procedure was carried out. Results demonstrated that out of 120 patients, 74 only continued the study. Twelve cases (16%) were positive in group I, compared to 29 cases (39%) in the subgroups examined individually, and 27 cases (36%) in the pooled subgroups. Therefore, the use of the multiple samples strongly improved the detection of intestinal parasites. In addition, pooling of preserved fecal samples is an efficient and economical procedure for the detection of parasites. Furthermore, the chlorazol black dye was simple and effective in detection the nuclear details of the different parasites.

Objectives Comparison of LF prevalence, filarial worm burden, response to LF treatment and development of chronic pathologies in HIV positive and negative individuals in a cohort in South-Tanzania. Methods From 2006 to 2011, a population based survey was conducted in the Mbeya Region, Tanzania. In 2009 and 2011, before and after two treatment rounds with ivermectin and albendazole, 1052 sera were tested with TropBio \u00e2 Og4C3 ELISA, which detects circulating filarial antigen (CFA), HIV status was determined with SD-Bioline strip test and confirmed with ELISA. Results In 2009, CFA was detected in 41.6% of participants aged 15-94 years; the HIV prevalence was 15.9%. CFA prevalence was similar in HIV negative and HIV positive individuals, 41% vs. 42%, respectively, as was the mean level of CFA, demonstrating similar worm burden in both subgroups. After 2 years of treatment the prevalence dropped significantly (P < 0.05) to 32% in HIV negative and 31% in HIV positive individuals. Development of elephantiasis occurred in 16 (3.2%) of HIV negative and 2 (1.6%) of HIV positive participants (RR = 1.83, 95% CI = 0.54 to 6.22). Hydrocele was found exclusively in HIV negative individuals, with a prevalence of 1%. Cytokine measurement in unstimulated PBMC demonstrated a higher level of IL-17 in LF-infected individuals with elephantiasis, compared to LF-infected, but clinically healthy individuals. Conclusions HIV-infection does not influence LF prevalence, worm burden or treatment success. Chronic pathologies (CP) might develop less often in HIV infected individuals. Together with the more 'aggressive' cytokine -profile in patients with CP, this could suggest a role of the host immune system in the development of LF sequelae. 1.13.1 Global HIV issues in pursuit of universal access and MDG 6 P.1.13.1.001 (B) Knowledge, attitudes and beliefs in female inmates regarding HIV infection: a survey in a prison in Mali N.

The HIV clinic is run in collaboration between local doctors, the National HIV Programme, and Danish researchers. We identified infrastructural problems at the clinic related to ART. Results (i) Inadequate drug supply: Among 3105 patients on ART 485 (16%) have experienced at least one episode of switch of ART due to drug stock outs. Three cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome were seen within a 5 week period due to switching from Efavirenz to Nevirapine. (ii) Relocation: The clinic has been relocated four times. This can be a contributory factor to the high number of patients lost to follow-up of 60%. (iii) Laboratory incapacity: (a) Diagnostics: Inadequate tests discriminating between HIV-1 and HIV-2 is one of the explanations for 9.3% of HIV-2 infected patients being treated with an insufficient NNRTI based regimen. (b) Biochemistry and CD4 measurements: Major interruptions in availability contribute to delayed initiation of ART, late diagnosis of treatment failure and lack of diagnosis of adverse events. (c) HIV-RNA: No availability of viral load measurement or resistance testing increases the risk of late diagnosis of treatment failure. Conclusion The largest HIV clinic in Guinea-Bissau faces a number of struggles, which hampers the goal of delivering ART at sufficient quality hazarding the lives of the patients.

M. SantosCentre for International Health Research and Institute for Global Health (CRESIB), Hospital Cl \u0131nic, Universitat de Barcelona,Barcelona, Spain    The current recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) to prevent malaria infection in pregnancy in areas of stable malaria transmission relies on the prompt and effective case management of malaria illness, the use of intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) at each scheduled antenatal clinic (ANC) visit and the use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs). The spread of parasite resistance to SP and the significant overlap in some regions of malaria transmission and high prevalence of HIV infection have raised concerns about the medium and long-term use of SP for IPTp. The evaluation of alternative antimalarials for IPTp is thus urgently needed in HIV-infected women. Among all the current available alternative antimalarial drugs mefloquine (MQ) is the one that offers the most comparative advantages to SP. A randomized double-blind superiority clinical trial was conducted in three African countries (Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique) to compare the efficacy of three doses of MQ as IPTp with 3-dose placebo-IPTp in HIVinfected pregnant women receiving CTX prophylaxis. Pregnant women were enrolled at the ANC and followed until the infants were 2-months old. All participants received a long-lasting ITN at recruitment. In total 1071 pregnant women were recruited from March 2011 to January 2012. The results on the efficacy and safety of MQ as IPTp shall be presented.Asymptomatic malaria and related anemia among pregnant women in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo Introduction The aim of this study was to determine the extent of asymptomatic P. falciparum infection and its related anemia in healthy pregnant women living in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, an endemic area for malaria transmission.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF30": {"text": "Conclusion These alarming results emphasize the need to actively diagnose and treat asymptomatic malaria infection during prenatal care visits, regardless of Intermittent Preventive Treatment with SP, and to increase efforts in promoting the use of Insecticide Treated Nets in DRC. Malaria in pregnancy (MiP) remains a major public health problem in endemic countries. Placental sequestration of P. falciparum parasites causes maternal anaemia and low birth weight (LBW). A better understanding of seasonal patterns of placental infection could help targeting control interventions in areas of seasonal transmission.Material and Methods One thousand ninety nine placental biopsies collected between 2004 and 2006 in primiand secundigravidae enrolled in a cluster randomized trial on malaria preventive strategies in rural Burkina Faso were analysed. Biopsies taken from the maternal side of the placenta were classified as either negative or infected (acute, chronic or past) according to the presence of parasites and haemozoin. Peripheral parasitaemia and packed cell volume (PCV) were assessed during pregnancy and at delivery. The large majority of collected placentas (71.9%) had signs of malaria infection, most of them (56.2%) past infections, 12.1% chronic and 3.6% acute. Active infections (acute and chronic) were significantly more frequent during the high transmission season (July to December). The risk of placental infection was the lowest in women delivering at the end of the dry season (May to June), when malaria transmission is extremely low. Active and past placental malaria was associated with maternal anaemia (active OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.39; 3.92; past OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.01; 2.21) and LBW (active OR 3.08; 95% CI 1.95; 4.89; past OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.03; 2.00). Intermittent preventive treatment with Y2 doses of sulfadoxinepyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) reduced the risk of placental infection by 37% (P = 0.001) as compared to incomplete (1 dose) IPTp and weekly chloroquine. Risk of active infection was reduced by 65% (P < 0.001). In rural Burkina Faso, acute and chronic placental infections, associated with LBW and maternal anaemia, show highly seasonal patterns. To reduce the burden of MiP, high coverage with IPTp-SP is needed during the peak transmission season.

A total of 141 cephalosporin-resistant isolates (139 E. coli and two K. pneumoniae) were recovered from Korle-Gonno, 136 E. coli had ESBL genes only, two E. coli and two K. pneumoniae had ESBL + AmpC genes and one E. coli strain produced carbapenemase. Of the 95 E. coli isolates from Dodowa, 89 produced only ESBLs, one both ESBLs and AmpCs, two only AmpCs and one strain produced carbapenemase. From Tamale, of 161 E. coli isolates 130 produced ESBLs. CTX-M enzymes were most prevalent in all three communities 98% (136) for Korle-Bu, 97% (92) for Dodowa and 88% (117) for Tamale, CTX-M-15 being the dominating ESBL. The prevalence of ESBL producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae the Ghanaian community was found to be 59.5% from Korle-Bu, 40% from Dodowa and 40% from Tamale with CTX-M-15 dominating.

In 2001, the government has set goals for 2015 as the establishment of a community health insurance in each of the 178 district health departments in Cameroon, and the coverage of at least 40% of the population. It therefore becomes necessary to regularly monitor the performance of CHI to achieve these objectives. The aim of this study was to make an assessment of managerial performance of CHI based on four indicators: number of members, penetration rate, claim rate and expense ratio. Six CHI representing the geographic, linguistic and cultural diversity of Cameroon were selected: Edea, Kumbo, Loum, Manjo, Mbanga and Ngaound er e.ResultsAt the end of this study it appeared that the number of members and the penetration rate were respectively <1000 and 1%, except Kumbo with 11 280 members and penetration rate of 7.52%. All CHI claim rates were higher than the 75% standard except Ngaound er e, which demonstrated the difficulty for managers to control the information asymmetries. Finally, all CHI had difficulty to maintain the expense ratio below 15%.ConclusionThe performance level of Cameroonian CHI are insufficient.

The countdown towards 2015 should be seen as an opportunity to re-focus the global development debate on these issues, including human rights, equity, community participation, and global governance.Back to the future: what would the post-2015 Global Development Goals look like if we applied the same methods used to construct the Millennium Development Goals? C. Brolan, S. Lee, D. Kim and P. Hill The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia Introduction The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)have substantially driven the development agenda since 2001, though critics have argued the process used to decide on the goals was narrowly technical and not adequately consultative. With the post-2015 development goals now under consideration, the United Nations (UN) have sought to undertake a much broader consultative process, engaging a series of national and technical consultations to inform its High-Level Dialogue. This research seeks to apply the methods used in constructing the MDGs to formulate a set of goals, for comparison both with the MDGs and the evolving post-2015 development goals. and Methods The researchers used the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs to identify UN Summits and Conferences from 2001 to 2012, (http://www.un. org/en/development/desa/about/conferences.shtml) and to follow the process described by Vandemoortele, identifying measurable goals and targets from their recommendations, and collating these into a proposed set of post-2015 development goals. and Conclusions The process yielded nine goals, with five goals duplicating current MDGs 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8. A further four new goals were identified, achieving food and water security, ensuring accessible health care systems, combating noncommunicable disease, and improving communications and infrastructure development. Conspicuous by their absence were current MDGs 4 and 5, addressing child and maternal health, though arguably the 2014 twentieth anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development will re-focus global attention on sexual and reproductive health. An extended examination of the MDG process suggests that the final technical exercise built on a decade of complex and highly politicised agenda setting, with the final list the result of high level negotiations and political trade-offs. Rather than use the past decade of UN summits as a resource from which to draw its goals, the current process is using them to initiate the dialogue, with the discourse already complex.The global politics behind the formulation of the Millennium Development Goals: what do they tell us about the post-2015 process? C. Brolan and P. Hill The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia Introduction The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have been of significance in shaping the development agenda in the early 21st Century and the complex global governance frameworks that evolved in response. Yet despite their potent role, and beside the academic contributions of Vandemoortele and Hulme, limited analysis exists around the politics behind the formulation of the world's so-called 'biggest promise'. The popular representation of the MDG process as a largely technical exercise, selecting goals from a decade of United Nations (UN) summits, fails to acknowledge the complex politics, trade-offs and negotiations that secured their now pivotal role. This analysis uses the available literature in the public domain to identify the major political plays influencing the development of the MDGs, and the impact of these on the current processes that surround the formulation of the post-MDG health and development agenda. and Methods A scoping review (Levac et al. 2010) was used to locate material in both the published and grey literature on the formulation of the MDGs. Reference lists were analysed and a tracking process was undertaken to identify and include documents of further relevance. The collated literature was subject to thematic and discourse analysis. and Conclusions Our analysis highlights the complex 'high' politics at play in the determination of the MDGs, with particular reference to the roles of key bilateral and multilateral agencies including the United Nations, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Development Assistance Committee, the World Bank, and International Monetary Fund. Our findings are of importance in understanding the challenges that have faced the MDG 8's Global Partnership for Development, and the implicit global political tensions emerging despite the current highly-structured UN consultative processes for the post-2015 Development Goals. The surgical training program: increasing surgical capacity in sierra leone by training medical doctors and community health officers in surgical and obstetric skills -progress report Masanga Hospital, Sierra Leone; 2 CapaCare, Norway; 3 St Olav University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway; 4 Ministry of Health and Sanitation, Sierra Leone; 5 Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, NorwayBackground Surgical and obstetrical emergencies are poorly addressed in Sierra Leone. Lack of human resources is a main contributing factor. There are obvious needs for innovative strategies to cope with the huge unmet need for surgery and obstetric care in rural parts of the country. In East-Africa there is experience and evidence that surgical task shifting can increase the surgical capacity. The objective of the study is to implement a surgical training program for Medical Doctors (MD) and Community Health Officers (CHO) to perform basic life saving surgery at district hospital level. This is done in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS). Two students are enrolled every three months, with the first 6 months of basic training in Masanga Hospital followed by 6 months rotations in partner hospitals. After 2 years an exam is obtained followed by houseman ships partly in governmental hospitals. Curriculum is based on the WHO Integrated Management of Emergency and Essential Surgical Care. In the period between January 2011 and March 2013, 17 students were enrolled, 1 MD and 16 CHOs. Two students have passed the final exams and have on average participated in 558 surgeries each. All students have participated in 5511 surgical procedures either as observer (25.1%), assistant (40.2%) surgeon supervised (13.1%) or surgeon independent (21.6%). The three most performed procedures were inguinal hernia repair (30.3%), caesarian section (16.4%) and explorative laparotomy (6.2%). Short course training of MDs and CHOs are feasible in Sierra Leone and can contribute to address the unmet need for surgical and obstetrical care within a short timeframe.

Rights cost money and in achieving the right to reproductive health care the Kenyan government has realised that finance plays a critical role. Thus, it is in this context that this paper will introduce zakat as a method of financing the right to reproductive health care in Kenya. Since zakat is an Islamic form of mandatory taxation its administration and management by the Kenyan government must be done in accordance with the principles of Islamic governance in order to encourage Muslims to pay their zakat to the secular state. Accordingly, this paper will explain how to restructure Kenya's National Health Insurance Fund with principles of Islamic governance to finance reproductive health care using zakat. Hence this paper presents an idea for future research based on expanding the tax base of countries by introducing zakat into their health policies and to further develop the concept of a hybrid system of health governance containing both secular and Islamic principles. This study shall utilise a mixed method approach, with an emphasis upon qualitative methods based upon archive research, which shall include health and governance legislation, health regulation, ministerial circulars on health and governance, newspapers, official and research documents both local and international related to health and governance and semi-structured expert interviews with policy makers, relevant government ministries, tax experts and officials. The quantitative methods shall involve analysing the total amount collected as zakat in Kenya. The results may prove or disprove the research hypothesis that zakat is not just a faith based tax but is potentially a legal, reasonable and rational tax which although different from conventional taxation may provide the financing required for reproductive health care in Kenya.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "Universal health coverage in Rwanda: dream or reality Introduction Universal Health Coverage (UHC) has been a global concern for a long time and even more nowadays. The Rwanda commitment to move towards UHC appears through various long term strategies, policies, laws and arrangements focusing on a strategic social protection through universal access to healthcare from 2000 to present. While a number of publications are almost unanimous that Rwanda is not far from UHC, very few have focused on its financial sustainability.Objectives (i) To make a critical scrutiny of Rwanda UHC based mainly on Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI) from 2000 to 2012 by highlighting its progress, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT); (ii) to inform policy makers about observed gaps for a better way forward.Methods A retrospective (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) SWOT analysis was applied to six metrics as key indicators of UHC achievement related to WHO definition of UHC, i.e. (i) access to care or insurance, (ii) equity and/or risk equalization, (iii) package of services, (iv) rights-based approach, (v) quality of health care, (vi) financial-risk protection, and a seventh metric related to Rwanda CBHI self-financing capacity (SFC) was added by authors.Results The first metric with 90.75% of CBHI rate and 1.07 visits per capita per year versus 1 visit recommended by WHO, the second with 24.8% indigent people subsidized versus 24.1% living in extreme poverty, the third, the fourth, and the fifth metrics excellently performing, the sixth registering a very good performance with only 10.80% versus \u226440% as limit acceptable of catastrophic health spending level and lastly the CBHI SFC i.e proper total cost recovery, estimated at 82.55% in 2011/2012, Rwanda UHC achievements are objectively convincing.Conclusions Better inclusion of health issues in IAs will support the sustainable development agenda post 2015. The following elements need to be further clarified: 1 explicit discussion of human health impacts; 2 comprehensive consideration of health determinants; 3 causal pathways from health determinants to health outcomes, including interactions; 4 distribution of health impacts on various groups (health equity); 5 utilization of health data to inform the analysis and possibly quantify health impacts.

With the tremendous movement of people across borders in the contemporary world, fuelled by globalization and new and evolving communication and transport technologies, it is increasingly important for States to both listen and respond to their growing minority populations to improve evidence based policy, planning and resource allocation to better their universal health care systems, and progress the right to the highest attainable standard of health for all. Strategy requires sustainable and continued efforts to improve sanitation monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to help achieve the Millenium Development Goal 2015 targets. Challenges collecting reliable and timely data on actual sanitation practices in resource poor settings remain and there is a need for new, innovative M&E tools for gathering reliable sanitaion data. In Ghana, data collection on sanitation coverage is by labour intensive and costly person administered Introduction Cholera epidemics have caused hundreds of thousands of cases and deaths in Bangladesh for centuries. However, the distribution and magnitude of cholera in nonhospitalized cases in Bangladesh is still largely unknown, since people simply cannot afford to see a doctor, and/or they treat the diarrhoea at home with ORS, avoiding the statistics. By developing a novel method for household surveillance of cholera the Choleraphone will detect diarrhoea cases that otherwise would have never been registered. The project is a collaboration between the University of Copenhagen, the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) and the University of Dhaka.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and Conclusions"}, {"text": "The methods are based on the concept of mHealth, which utilizes mobile phones in disease surveillance. The reporting system will be implemented in a cohort of 400 randomly selected households in Tongi, a lowincome area in peri-urban Dhaka. Each household will be given a mobile phone and instructed how to report diarrheal episodes.A medical officer will visit the household after each report. Through the mobile reporting system, the project addresses the problem of diarrheal recall, which is optimal within 48 h, meaning that the household ideally should be interviewed every 2 days. The sensitivity and specificity of the method is evaluated through interviews with a randomly selected subset of households in the cohort.Conclusion By visiting the households when they report a diarrheal incidence, the medical officer is expected to visit a household twice monthly based on an average of 25 episodes of diarrhoea per household per year. The Choleraphone will therefore cut down the household visits by 80%, from 15 to 3 per month (with one normal surveillance visit), not only saving project money but more importantly saving 6 h of interviews per month (30 min each) herby reducing research fatigue and time commitment from the households. Brief Introduction Infectious diseases outbreaks occurred frequently in schools, it is therefore of great importance to collect data about absenteeism, which has been popularly used for early detection of disease outbreaks in syndromic surveillance. We aimed to describe a successful detection case of a minor mumps outbreak using school absenteeism in rural China.

Of note, the three members of one family declined the optional 4-day stay on Tioman Island. Almost all patients presented high-grade fever, fatigue, headache, moderate-to-severe myalgia and arthralgia. Three cases experienced febrile illness for more than 14 days. A muscle biopsy from one patient revealed intense myositis, but no intramuscular cysts. Half of patients healed using usual antalgic treatments. Six patients were given empirically albendazole 400 mg b.i.d for 7 days and oral prednisone (0.5 mg/Kg/day) for 3 days tapered over 2 days. Six weeks later, four patients were still unrecovered. Prolonged manifestations were asthenia and myalgia. The patients were effectively treated with additional prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day for 5 days and decreasing dosage over 14 days.Conclusion The cluster of 12 diseased travelers mainly contributed to the 65 patients returning from Malaysia who represent the second wave of the outbreak. With little known about this foodborne anthropozoonosis, our experience suggests that late manifestations may occur and short term corticosteroid course could benefit symptomatic patients.Introduction Dengue and malaria are major international public health problems. Tourists are reported to have been infected by these two diseases and to have brought dengue and malaria from tourist areas back into their home countries.Tourism development causes changes in land use which in turn impacts disease transmission.

There is no doubt that the health of the immigrant population has become a relevant subject from the point of view of public healthcare.

A multivariate analysis adjusting for age and sex was performed by Results All samples from CH patients were detected by the rapid test, just one out of them showed a faint reaction. Two samples from NoCH individuals showed a faint reaction. Crossreactivity with samples from VL patients was not found and one false-positive result was observed in samples from malaria patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the Chagas Detect \u2122 Plus Rapid Test were estimated in two scenarios. Without problem in the interpretation of results as the first scenario and assuming that the faint reaction could not be detected as the second scenario. Taking into account these situations, the sensitivity was between 100% and 97.5% and the specificity was from 95% to 98.3, respectively. Concerns have been raised regarding the safety of human exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA), an unstable chemical capable of leaching from polycarbonate plastics products into foods and beverages. The study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of exposure of rats to different concentrations of Bisphenol A (0.6-4.1 lg/l) (concentrations detected in selected canned foods) ana-lyzed in this study. BPA concentrations were determined in samples by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Thirty male and female rats (60-80 g) divided into six groups of five rats each were then administered standard BPA in the range detected in analyzed canned foods namely baked beans, sweet corn, tomato paste, green peas and sardine obtained from Markets in Lagos area, Nigeria, orally for seven weeks at different concentrations ranging from (0.6-4.1 lg/l). Hormonal and biochemical assays were carried out; ovary, testis and liver were excised for histological studies. Data were analyzed using ANOVA. The results showed that BPA had no significant effect on serum level of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in all the groups while progesterone, estradiol, and testoterone were significantly increased (P \u2264 0.05) when compared to control groups. High dose of BPA (4.1 lg/kg) significantly increased (P \u2264 0.05) levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) while there was no significant difference (P \u2265 0.05) in the serum aspartate amino transferase (AST) alanine amino transferase (ALT) and bilirubin when compared with the control groups. Histological examinations of the test groups showed no difference when compared to the control but the ovaries had increase in the production of follicle as the doses of BPA increased. This study indicates that Bisphenol A has an induction effect on ovarian steroidogenesis. The exposure to bisphenol A in consumer products may have endocrine disrupting actions which could potentiate onset of carcinogenic reactions. Its use therefore should be replaced with suitable alternatives. In Slovakia, Echinococcus multilocularis, causative agent of human alveolar echinococcosis, was detected in red foxes in 1999 for the first time. Following long-term surveillance of tapeworm occurrence in red foxes revealed the existence of highly endemic areas in northern parts of the country, with overall prevalence rate of 41.6%. In some localities of Presov and Zilina regions the prevalence reaching as much as 60% was recorded. Between 2000 and 2012 in total 24 human cases of alveolar echinococcosis was detected and only three of them did not came from endemic localities of northern Slovakia. Remarkable is the occurrence of the disease in eight persons less than 35 years, including three patients younger than 20 years. Occurrence of E. multilocularis in red foxes in whole territory of the country, together with increasing incidence of alveolar echinococcosis in humans and especially in young people indicates the high infectious pressure of northern Slovakia environment and the threat for both, humans and animals. The research has drawn attention to necessity of targeted surveillance and engagement of specialist, veterinarians, zoologists and ecologists, for effective managements of the diseases for effective managements of the diseases prevention. causes severe economic loss to livestock.

In the studied fish, three anisakid species were recorded, i.e. Hysterothylacium aduncum (1171 individuals, 164 cods infected), Anisakis simplex (3153 individuals, 136 cods were infected) and Contracecum osculatum (446 individuals, 90 cods infected) in both the viscera and muscles of the fish. Almost all of the investigated cods were infected with larvae or adult nematode. The highest prevalence was observed for A. simplex (100%), H. aduncum (95.0%) and C. osculatum (67.5%) from the Irminger Sea. The lowest prevalence of all nematodes species was found in the cod from the Pomeranian Bay and the Gulf of Gda\u00f1sk. The highest positive correlation was reported between liver weight and the number of A. simplex on / in the liver (R = 0.64778). In summary, cod from the North Atlantic can be considered as heavily infected with nematodes. Especially the high abundance of A. simplex and C. osculatum larvae in the muscles and liver is of concern regarding the possible utilization of fresh cod as a food resource. The analysis of the similarity of the cod parasites from the fishing grounds samples showed that there were two basic groups, which tentatively corresponded with two taxonomic division into two subspecies: G. morhua morhua (North Atlantic and the Sund) and G. morhua callarias (central and eastern basins of the Baltic Sea). Brief Introduction Blastocystis is a common single-celled intestinal parasite found in both healthy individuals and patients with intestinal symptoms, including functional intestinal diseases such as IBS. The genus comprises at least 17 subtypes found in human, other mammalian, and avian hosts. Geographical differences in the distribution of subtypes in humans are seen, and in Europe ST4 appears to be more common in patients with intestinal symptoms than in healthy individuals. Detection of Annually, 20 000 wild boars (Sus scrofa) are being hunted for human consumption in Estonia. Meat of animals carrying Toxo-plasma gondii may be a source of human T. gondii infections, if eaten insufficiently cooked. This study aimed to estimate T. gondii antibody prevalence in the wild boar population of Estonia: the proportion of animals that had encountered the parasite and produced specific IgG antibodies against it. During the hunting season from 1st of October 2012 to 28th of February 2013, voluntary hunters sampled hearts of wild boar. Meat juice from thawed samples were diluted 1:40 and screened with a commercial direct agglutination test. Chi-square analysis was used to evaluate differences between the categorical variables: gender, estimated age (\u22641 or >1 year of age), and county where the animal was shot. Out of 471 individual samples submitted, 113 (24.0%, 95% CI 20.3-28.1) were defined antibody positive. This result is similar to recent findings in Finland and Latvia and show the wild boars in Estonia are commonly exposed to this important zoonotic parasite. No differences in antibody positivity were found between genders (P = 0.92, X 2 = 0.01), age groups (P = 0.68, X 2 = 0.17), or the counties (P = 0.16, X 2 = 17.93). (2005) . Meat sample of at least 25 g material consists of muscle tissue taken from foreleg tissues. All meat samples were stored frozen at \u00c020\u00b0C until analyzes. Trichinella spp. species identification was done by multiplex PCR methods. Total Trichinella spp. prevalence in Martes sp. was 47.9%. That is similar to prevalence detected for raccoon dog in Latvia. Prevalence in stone martin was 57.1% and pine martin was 46.1%. Larvae number per one gram musculature vary from 0.04 to 25. Trichinella britovi is the most widespread etiological agent of Trichinella infection in wild and domestic animals and has the widest geographical range, occurring wildlife of the temperate areas of the Europe and Asia. This is also the most common agents of Trichinella infection in Latvia and it can be transmitted from animal to animal through consumption of scraps from sylvatic carnivores and wild boars. The preliminary results of study show that in Latvia zoonotic agent Trichinella is circulating in wildlife and Martes species are frequent natural reservoirs for this parasite.Three raptor species from genus Buteo occur in Slovakia &#8211; Common-Buzzard (Buteo buteo), Rough-legged Buzzard (Buteo lagopus) and Long-legged Buzzard (Buteo rufinus). The Common-Buzzard is the most common raptor not only in Slovakia but also in Europe. The main diet component of these birds represents small rodents, especially Microtus arvalis. Our pilot study was focused on detection of endoparasites in Buzzards from Slovakia. We examined 53 Common-Buzzard, 1 Rough-legged Buzzard and 1 Long-legged Buzzard. The raptors were subjected to parasitological dissection, the samples of pectoral muscles were examined for trichinellosis using artificial digestion method and the fecal samples were examined using standard flotation technique for the presence of parasite eggs and coccidian oocysts. Parasitological dissection revealed 30% of birds being infected with parasites from the class Trematoda, in 40% were determined specimen from class Cestoda, in 6% of individuals Acanthocephalan parasites were found and the most common was Nematode infection (64%). Coprological examination detected 42.4% prevalence of Capillaria spp., in one Longlegged Buzzard eggs of the genus Cyathostoma were found and in 15.2% of samples intestinal coccidian oocysts were present. Although the raptors are potential hosts of Trichinella pseudospiralis parasite, no positive specimen was found within our study. Our results indicate that parasite fauna of raptors from the genus Buteo is quite diverse. In the following research we focus on parasite species identification and detection of blood parasites by means of molecular methods. Estonian cattle farms vary in herd size from a few animals to 2100 dairy cows and also housing conditions and management differ. The major factor is people and their beliefs of what strategies work in running the farm. Logically, beliefs affect the behaviour, behaviour affects the management, management affects the level of hygiene, and hygiene has direct influence on the successful control of many parasitic diseases. Parasitic diseases are particularly important to young animals. This study investigates farmers' beliefs regarding conditions that affect calves, using a questionnaire designed according to the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). The method enables evaluation of farmers' actual behaviour through behavioural intention analysis. The target population was Estonian dairy farms with a herd size of at least five dairy cattle. Our selection criteria were met by 1688 herds registered in the Estonian Agricultural Registers and Information Board. We sent out 1468 questionnaires by mail in April 2013. The announced deadline for the completed questionnaires is 7th May 2013. The response rate is already exceeding 33% (1st May 2013). Preliminary evaluation shows that the average farmer is 52 years old and farmers of all age groups seem to value veterinarians and seminars as most important information sources regarding calf management. The study aimed to investigate the occurrence of Eimeria spp. in Finnish dairy calves, and to examine associations between acute phase proteins (APP) and coccidiosis. On farm visits (n = 22) all the calves \u22642 months of age (younger calves; n = 142) were clinically examined and blood and faecal samples were obtained. Additional samples were collected from randomly selected calves aged 2-6 months (older calves; n = 154). Blood samples were analysed for APPs (haptoglobin; Hp and serum amyloid A; SAA) and faecal sample for intestinal pathogens (Eimeria spp., rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp.). Eimeria spp. was found in 30.8% and in 65.6% of younger and older calves, respectively. Eimeria bovis or E. zuernii were detected in 23.2% and 26.1% of samples, respectively. In younger calves suffering from diarrhea, E. bovis or E. zuernii were more often found as mono-infections compared to other intestinal pathogens. No intestinal pathogens were found in 25.4% of younger calves. Mixed linear regression models were used to investigate the association between APP concentration and coccidiosis in younger calves. Coccidiosis was classified mild (oocyst count per gram faeces (opg) 1-500 opg + diarrhea -pathogenic species or opg 1-500 opg -diarrhea AE pathogenic species or opg >500pathogenic speciesdiarrhea) or severe (opg >500 opg + diarrhea AE pathogenic species or opg >500 opg -diarrhea + pathogenic species or opg 1-500 + diarrhea+pathogenic species). Farm was included as random factor and other clinical diseases were controlled. Decreased Hp concentration was associated with mild clinical coccidiosis (P = 0.02) with a tendency to decrease with severe forms of clinical coccidiosis (P = 0.12). No statistical associations were found between coccidiosis and SAA concentrations. In conclusion, pathogenic Eimeria species are common intestinal pathogens in Finnish dairy calves and Hp is negatively associated with severity of clinical coccidiosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of carriers of intestinal parasites among food handlers attending the public health center laboratory in Sari, northern Iran for annual check-up. The study was conducted from August 2011 to February 2012. Stool samples were collected from 1041 male and female food handlers of different Jobs aged between 18 and The use of different types of wastewater for irrigation in agriculture is common practise in many countries due to limited fresh-water resources. Contamination of fruits and vegetables with pathogenic microorganisms, including Cryptosporidium spp., may occur when the irrigation water or water used for postharvest washing of the produce is contaminated. A laboratory study was carried out to investigate the effect of a coagulant from the seeds of Moringa oleifera (MO) in reducing Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and turbidity in Danish wastewater. To each of five time points, 12 replicates of 500 ml wastewater samples were added 1.2 9 10 5 oocysts per litre. Half of the replicates were added 4 ml/l of a 5% w/v MO extract, while the other half was left untreated. The samples were stirred slowly for 20 min and subsequently left to sediment for 15, 30, 45, 60 or 90 min. In wastewater from a Danish treatment plant MO extracts were effective in reducing the number of Cryptosporidium oocysts by 93 AE 3.2% after 90 min of sedimentation and the turbidity to 9.8 AE 1.8 NTU, corresponding to a turbidity removal of 95%. MO is readily available in many tropical countries and can be used by farmers for water treatment. Yet, in this study, a large number of oocysts remained in the wastewater after treatment. This was likely because the proportion of oocysts and active component from MO extract was imbalanced, with more oocysts added than the MO extract could adhere to. Additional experiments with water samples containing fewer and/ or naturally occurring Cryptosporidium oocysts are needed to establish whether MO extract can be used to effectively treat and obtain safe water free of Cryptosporidium oocysts. DNA barcoding has become popular and important tool in the identification of a variety of animals, particularly parasites. Different PCR-based methods have been developed for detection and identification of haemosporidian (Haemosporida) parasite species. As a result, numerous nucleotide sequences (lineages) of the parasites and data about their host range and distribution have been accumulated in GenBank and MalAvi database. On the other hand, the traditional systematics and taxonomy of haemosporidian parasites are based mainly on morphological characters visible under microscope during development in blood of vertebrate hosts. Recently, numerous studies developed molecular characterization (barcodes) for avian blood parasites from the genera Haemoproteus, Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon, but the predominant number of genetic sequences have been identified only to generic level. When applying traditional microscopic examination together with molecular identification in order to develop barcodes for bird haemosporidians, several difficulties usually occur: (i) poor quality of the blood smears (shortcomings of their preparation, fixation or staining), (ii) insufficient experience in the taxonomy and systematics, (iii) light intensity of parasitemia and/or absence of all blood stages necessary for morphological identification, and (iv) co-infections which are common in wild birds. Unfortunately, an increasing number of deposited sequences are also accompanied with incorrectly identified parasites; that is an obstacle for developing barcoding. In order to avoid misidentification it is recommended (i) to use spe- The history of investigations of European freshwater bucephalid species is complicated. The life cycle of bucephalids involves a distinctive furcocercous cercaria that emerges from bivalves and encysts in the second intermediate host, the fish, which in turn is eaten by definitive host (Baturo, 1977) . Gibson, Taskinen & Valtonen (1992) showed the presence of a new bucephalid species, Rhipidocotyle fennica in central Finland in addition to two bu-cephalids, R. campanula and Bucephalus polymorphus, already known in European freshwater habitats. The cercaria of R. fennica with long filamentous furcae closely resembles cercaria of B. polymorphus (Taskinen et al. 1991) , while cercaria of R. campanula clearly differs. Larval bucephalids found in unionids have until recently been called B. polymorphus in some publications (Yanovich, Stadnichenko, 1997) . For this study parthenitae of Rhipidocotyle spp. infecting Anodonta anatina were gathered from freshwater bodies in Finland, Lithuania and Ukraine. Comparative analysis using ribosomal ITS2 and 28S DNA sequences was performed. On the basis of molecular data, we recognised, that bucephalid cercariae with long filamentous furcae parasitising A. anatina belongs to species R. fennica in all studied populations. So, this species is not endemic for Finland. All previous records of B. polymorphus in the unionid clams must be attributed to R. fennica. Bucephalus polymorphus is specific to Dreissena spp. (Baturo, 1977) and reports of its presence in unionids are doubtful. At present, around 14 species of Phyllodistomum have been recorded in freshwater fishes in Europe. Only few life cycles were determinate by experimental infections, but these results are controversial. The most common type of life-cycle described is that characterized by cystocercous cercariae, but rhopalocercous and a microcercous cercariae are also known. Recently used molecular techniques have a great potential as an alternative to the classical approaches for the elucidation of digenean life cycles. Material was collected in different water bodies of Europe. ITS2 and 28S DNA sequences of adult and larval stages of Phyllodistomum spp. were obtained and compared. Life-cycle described for the type-species P. folium (Olfers, 1816) by Sinitsin (1905) can apparently be discounted. Adult specimens, obtained from type host, pike, and microcercous cercariae developing in Dreissena polymorpha, showed no match between the DNA sequences. The match was detected between sequences of adult P. folium and cystocercous cercariae from sphaeriid bivalves. Cystocercous cercariae from Pisidium amnicum, known as P. elongatum, as well as adult P. elongatum Nybelin, 1926 from roach, showed no differences from P. folium. Consequently, the validity of P. elongatum is doubtful. Rhopalocercous cercariae, Cercaria duplicata von Baer, 1827, from Anodonta anatina have been linked to P. elongatum by Orecchia et al. (1975 ) and P. angulatum von Linstow, 1907 by Ivantsiv and Kurandina (1985 . The results of our molecular study do not justify any of these experimental findings. This study supports the existence of a pressing need for all aspects of biology and taxonomy of European phyllodistomes to be thoroughly reinvestigated.This research was funded by a grant (No. MIP-52/2013) from the Research Council of Lithuania.The trematode Stephanoprora pseudoechinata is an intestinal parasite of various fish-eating birds. Metacercariae were reported from fishes, Alburnus alburnus, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Pungitius pungitius in the Gulf of Riga (Krasnolobova, 1971 ). The first intermediate host of this parasite was unknown. In August 2011 a preliminary survey of trematodes of birds in the Yagorlytska Bay of the Black Sea (Kherson region, Ukraine) was made. Adults of S. pseudoechinata were recovered from the intestine of Larus melanocephalus. During the helminthological studies of the brackish water gastropods Hydrobia acuta in the Yagorlytska Bay in 2012 we have found large-tailed cercariae. One of 1817 examined molluscs was infected. Morphological examination was conducted on living and fixed specimens. Morphological features observed led us to conclude that this species was an echinostomatid fluke, and it was identified as Stephanoprora sp. We used nuclear ribosomal (28S and ITS2) DNA sequences to establish the link between the cercaria infecting H. acuta and the trematodes previously collected from L. melanocephalus. The results demonstrated that the DNA sequences from the cercaria and adult of S. pseudoechinata are identical. The life cycle of the S. pseudoechinata species is similar to that of S. denticulata from Denmark (K\u00f8ie, 1986) and S. uruguayense from Argentina (Ostrowski de N u\u00f1ez, 2007) in that hidrobiid molluscs and fishes act as intermediate hosts. Morphology and morphometry of S. pseudoechinata cercaria is most similar to that of S. denticulata from Europe. Cercariae of S. pseudoechinata can be definitely identified to species level only using molecular markers. Plasmodium relictum is a widespread invasive agent of avian malaria, responsible for acute, chronic and debilitating diseases in many species of birds. Recent PCR-based studies revealed astonishing genetic diversity of avian malaria parasites (genus Plasmodium), with numerous genetic lineages deposited in Gen-Bank. Many studies addressed distribution and evolutionary relationships of avian Plasmodium spp. lineages, but information about patterns of development of different lineages in vectors remains insufficient. We investigated sporogonic development of two widespread mitochondrial cytochrome b lineages (cyt b) of P. relictum (pSGS1 and pGRW11) in mosquitoes of the Culex pipiens group (C. pipiens pipiens and C. pipiens f. molestus). Genetic distance between these lineages of malaria parasites is 0.2%; they fall in a well-supported clade in the phylogenetic tree. These parasites were isolated from 1 common crossbill (Loxia curvirostra, lineage pSGS1) and 1 house sparrow (Passer domesticus, pGRW11); the strains were multiplied in domestic canaries who served as donors of malarial gametocytes to infect mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were allowed to take infected blood meal and then dissected on intervals to study development of sporogonic stages. Both lineages developed synchronously and completed sporogony in both forms of C. pipiens mosquitoes, with infective sporozoites reported in the salivary glands on the days 14-15 after infection. Ookinetes, oocysts and sporozoites of all strains were indistinguishable morphologically. This study shows that (i) the patterns of sporogonic development of the closely related lineages pSGS1 and pGRW11 of P. relictum are similar, and (ii) the phylogenetic trees based on the cyt b gene likely can be used for predicting sporogonic development of genetically similar avian malaria lineages in mosquito vectors. Our experience also show that C. pipiens f. molestus is a particularly convenient experimental vector because it is easy to cultivate in the laboratory conditions. This study was supported by the Global Grant (VPI-3.1.-\u00d0MM-07-K-01-047). The ecological niche of vector snails, involved in transmission of diseases caused by intestinal worms, are modelled and mapped, and climatic parameters that may serve as predictors are identified and quantified. Once a mathematical relationship between climate predictors and vector has been established, it is possible to predict the potential distribution of the snail (and in turn disease distribution) in areas where no data exists. These modelling results can serve as valuable information when planning health interventions. We use georeferenced vector snail observations from two snail collection surveys in 1988 (364 localities) and 2012 (64 localities) together with climate parameters serving as predictors for the potential niche of vector snails. The snail species involved in the transmission of urinary-and intestinal schistosomiasis (Bulinus globosus, Biomphalaria pfeifferi, respectively) were collected together with the snail Lymnaea natalensis, responsible for the transmission of fascioliasis and paramphistomosis. Satellite observation data on temperature, rainfall, and NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) were downloaded on a 10 km resolution from NOAA data servers for 1988 and 2012; formatted in the ArcMap GIS-software to comply with MaxEnt, used for the niche modelling. A model for each of the two periods are being developed and output can be interpreted as distribution change in two climate situations, similar to the effect of climate change. Preliminary statistical analysis of the snail distribution show that the snail dataset is suitable for modeling in MaxEnt and early results show consistency with observed distributions. Climate data are of high quality and performs well as predictors. Conclusions on development during the 24-year period from 1988 to 2012 remain.This study serve as a baseline for modeling of snail distribution in a future climate and can give us valuable information on Introduction Toxoplasma gondii is an obligatory intracellular parasite in different cells of human beings and animals.

Two weeks after the second immunization, mice were challenged with 1 9 10 4 alive and the active tachyzoites of T. gondii RH strain and on days 1,2,3 and the last day (before death) after challenge, different tissues (eye, muscle, kidney, heart, brain, spleen, blood and liver) of three mice from each group were prepared and DNA extraction, parasite load of tissues has been evaluated by Real Time Q-PCR.Results Toxoplasma after intraperitoneal injection, in both case and control groups were able to movement to various tissues. In the case group receiving Excretory Secretory Antigens (ESA), parasite load in eye, kidney, brain, blood and liver was less than control group.Conclusion Hence, ESA reduced the the parasite load, but could not inhibit the distribution and presence of Toxoplasma in different tissues.Keywords Movement trend, Toxoplasma gondii, tissue, Balb/ c, immunization, Excretory Secretory Antigens (ESA), Real Time Q-PCR.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Material and Methods"}]}
