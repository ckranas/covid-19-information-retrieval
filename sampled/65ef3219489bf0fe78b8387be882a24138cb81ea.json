The severe acute TBI-a leading cause of death and disability worldwide-is a heterogeneous disorder resulting from an external force applied to the head. The TBI triggers a focal immune response that is initiated within minutes after the primary injury. This focal brain inflammation involves both brain-resident and peripheral immune cells with complicated interactions. Typically, the development of cerebral edema (CE) plays a central role in the evolution of this particular injury and is closely associated with pathoneurological outcomes (for reviews, see [3, 4] ). Current notions hold that TBI promotes a robust innate immune response induced by DAMPs that are also denoted as immunological stressors elsewhere [5, 6] . In the following, the emerging evidence and features of focal brain inflammation after TBI are briefly outlined by highlighting the pathogenetic role of DAMPs.",

This injury is caused by multiple interconnected molecular pathways including but not limited to alterations in cerebral perfusion, ion/fluid imbalance such as calcium and iron perturbations, ROS-mediated oxidative stress, disruption of the BBB, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, and a neuroinflammatory response comprised of local and systemic immune activation (for in-depth articles, see [4, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] ). Oxidative stress is of particular relevance. As emphasized [31] , excessive glutamate at the synaptic junction, which in turn activates its NMDA and AMPA receptors, facilitates excessive calcium influx into the neuronal cells and promotes oxidative stress 9.2 Brain Injury that further leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidation of lipids, proteins, and DNA. All these pro-oxidative and proinflammatory processes converge to and culminate in cell death pathways resulting in death of cerebral cells ( Fig. 9.1 ). These cells are all susceptible to traumatic injury, with neurons being the most sensitive to direct injury, followed by oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia, and ECs being particularly resistant to damage. As experimentally shown, various forms of cell death may occur, executed either directly via ACD or indirectly through RCD, as mentioned above. With the discovery of these subroutines of RCD, the critical sources of secondarily emitted DAMPs in TBI became evident, that is, DAMPs that are released from the damaged meninges, glial limitans, and parenchyma. Indeed, there is growing evidence in support of the notion that the emission of DAMPs that is associated with the various forms of TBI-induced neuronal cell death not only initiate but also perpetuate innate immune \"cell death\" pathways involved in the pathophysiology of TBI [25, 32, 33] (Fig. 9.1 ). These DAMP-promoted innate immune inflammatory responses, including complement activation, lead-or at least contribute-to CE that (1) plays a vital role in the evolution of injury following brain trauma, (2) is closely associated with neurologic outcomes, and, most importantly, (3) can lead to intracranial hypertension. Indeed, it is this intracranial Simplified schematic diagram of a conceptual model illustrating emission of constitutive and inducible DAMPs during primary and secondary brain injury in TBI. Emission of DAMPs as a cause of external mechanical forces of the initial trauma promotes innate immune pro-oxidative and proinflammatory processes, which converge to and culminate in cell death pathways resulting in various subroutines of regulated necrosis (apoptosis \u2192 secondary necrosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis). These various forms of regulated necrosis serve as secondary sources of emission of constitutive and inducible DAMPs, which, again, promote cell death pathways resulting in subroutines of regulated necrosis (i.e., a vicious circle of DAMPs emission). In severe trauma, these processes may lead to irreversible brain death. Note: compare also Sect. 4.3 and Fig. 4 .2a, b and also Vol. 1 [1] , Part V, Sect. 19.3, and Figs. 19.2, 19.4, 19.6, and 19.7 .

These macrophages are implicated in the cleanup of debris and damaged cells. Studies have also shown other beneficial aspects of cerebral immunity following brain injuries, besides resolution of inflammation, preservation of barrier function, and the release of trophic factors (for review, see Jassam et al.

However, little is known regarding the role SAMPs in the resolving phase after TBI; nevertheless, a few SAMPs such as LXs, Rvs, and Pds have been described and will be briefly touched below.",

Furthermore, the disseminated brain inflammation may be persistent and impact brain pathology, causing progressive neurodegeneration [30] . Histopathologically, various DAMPs reportedly induce proinflammatory activation in microglia, astrocytes, and neurons [37] [38] [39] [40] : a topic that will be further explored below.",

Other critical sources of DAMPs refer to simultaneously occurring extracerebral organ injuries. For example, in studies in mice, bone fracture-stimulated emission of HMGB1 was shown to contribute to the development of secondary TBI [49] . Subsequently, DAMP-activated innate immune cells such as glial cells, neurons, leukocytes, and ECs produce inducible DAMPs including TNF and IL-1\u03b2 which drive and expand early posttraumatic neuroinflammation (reported in [26, 27, [50] [51] [52] [53] ). Of note, the proinflammatory TNF was demonstrated to be linked to brain edema, BBB disruption, and recruitment of leukocytes, whereas the antiinflammatory IL-10 was assumed to possess neuroprotective properties [26, 54] .",

In contrast, intravenous injection of recombinant HMGB1 dose-dependently produced the opposite effects. Further experiments suggested the involvement of RAGE as the predominant receptor for HMGB1. In other lines of studies, ethyl pyruvate was shown to have protective effects on the development of CE following TBI in rats suggested by the authors to be mediated by the reduction of HMGB1-triggered TLR4 \u2192 NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [58] . In support of these findings were other lines of studies on a murine TBI model demonstrating that HMGB1 promotes CE via activation of TLR4 [59] . In two separate studies exploring potential therapeutic options, the neuroprotective agent glycyrrhizin was observed to (1) reduce CE significantly, (2) suppress the increase in BBB permeability and impairment of motor functions, and (3) improve outcomes in rats following TBI by downregulation of HMGB1-triggered, TLR4 or RAGE \u2192 NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory responses in the injured rat brain [60, 61] . Together, these experimental studies in rodents significantly show that, following TBI, HMGB1 is released from damaged and necrotic neurons to trigger efferent innate immune pathways contributing to CE and other typical pathological features of this life-threatening organ injury.",

In other lines of studies on mice, chronic alcohol treatment was shown to increase HMGB1 in cortex and cerebellum [64] . Also, as demonstrated by experiments in rats exposed to intragastric binge ethanol administrations, HMGB1 was found to be upregulated in the frontal cortex of the animals. In support of such findings are in vitro experiments on human and rat neurons, showing that ethanol can directly induce HMGB1 release in neuronal cells, associated with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent oxidase 2 (NOX2)/NLRP1 inflammasome signaling [65] .",

Moreover, in similar analyses of human postmortem samples of the orbitofrontal cortex, the RAGE receptor was found to be upregulated in the postmortem human alcoholic orbitofrontal cortex, and an earlier age of drinking onset could be demonstrated to be correlated with increased RAGE, TLR4, and HMGB1 expression [69] .

The critical role of mtDNA in severe trauma has been outlined in Sect. 8.3.3.3. The involvement of this DAMP in TBI could be demonstrated in investigations on the CSF of pediatric patients [70] . As reported, the mean CSF mtDNA in pediatric TBI was increased in comparison to controls. Remarkably, the CSF mtDNA concentration in pediatric patients who later died or had a severe disability was significantly higher than that of the survivors. Moreover, the authors found a significant correlation between CSF mtDNA and HMGB1, indicating that both DAMPs are increased in the CSF following TBI in pediatric patients. 9.2.6.4 S100 Proteins S100 proteins have been described in Vol. 1 [1] , Part IV, Sect. 12.2.4.2, denoted as constitutive IA-1 DAMPs, and Sect. 14.2.2.4, denoted as inducible IIIA-1 DAMPs. Out of the family of S100 proteins, S100 B proteins have been reported as classical serum biomarkers in TBI, first published already in 1995 [71] , and now regarded as a critical DAMP. Similar to other DAMP levels such as HMGB1, the protein was found to be increased in the bloodstream in the acute phase of the trauma and assessed as one of the strongest single predictors of unfavorable TBI outcome [72] . Studies in patients with TBI revealed a primary peak of S100B level during the time of the initial injury, followed by a secondary peak resulting from the second injury predicting an unfavorable outcome [73] . In an analysis of serum levels of S100B proteins in pediatric patients with TBI, median serum levels of S100B at admission were shown to decrease significantly 1 week after TBI [74] . Follow-up of these patients revealed that serum S100B levels 1 week after injury in patients with unfavorable 6-month outcomes were significantly higher than levels 1 week after injury in patients with favorable outcomes. The authors concluded that serial measurements of serum S100B may help to assess brain damage and clinical outcome of pediatric patients with TBI.",

For example, in studies in pediatric patients with severe TBI, CSF adenosine concentration was observed to be increased in a timeand severity-dependent manner in infants and children after severe head injury [84] . The authors argued that the association between CSF adenosine and glutamate concentrations may reflect an endogenous attempt at neuroprotection against excitotoxicity after severe TBI. In subsequent studies on mice undergoing experimental TBI, this early adenosine release response was shown-via activation of purine A1 receptors-to suppress seizures [85] and microglial response-mediated brain inflammation [86] . Intriguingly, the authors concluded [86] that the activated A1 receptor \"is an endogenous inhibitor of the microglial response to TBI, likely via inhibition of proliferation, and this may represent a therapeutic avenue to modulate microglia after TBI\"-a recommendation that was echoed by Jackson et al. [83] : \"Developing therapeutics that recruit astrocytes to produce/release adenosine could have beneficial effects in TBI\" (for purinergic receptors, compare Sect. 2.3.3, and Vol. 1 [1] , Part II, Sect. 5.3.4).",

Of note, if the timely homeostatic resolution of acute lung inflammation is unrestrained, or if exposure to toxic environmental factors turns out to be acute repetitive or persistent, a COPD can develop. Again, this COPD is a lifethreatening disorder that is associated with high morbidity and mortality and, thus, creates enormous challenges for healthcare systems.

In the earlier periods, there were some difficulties with an accurate assessment of the clinical symptomology of ARDS. Then, in 2012, the Berlin definition was published stressing the mutually exclusive categories of the disease: mild, moderate, and severe-as based on the degree of hypoxemia and four ancillary variables for severe ARDS. These are radiographic severity, respiratory system compliance, positive end-expiratory pressure, and corrected expired volume per minute (these variables were later removed because they did not contribute to the predictive validity of severe ARDS for mortality) [97] . In light of new insights into mechanisms of controlled and uncontrolled DAMPpromoted efferent innate immune responses, mild ALI-induced pulmonary inflammation (i.e., pneumonia) resulting in resolution of the inflammatory response may reflect a controlled protective innate immune response, whereas ALI\u2192ARDS represents a typical dysregulated overshooting efferent response caused by emission of DAMPs in excess.",

Besides apoptosis of cells of the distal pulmonary epithelium and the endothelium [98, 99] , necroptosis is discussed as another emerging subroutine of RCD. Thus, in experiments on mice, RIP3-mediated necroptosis of alveolar wall EpCs and macrophage-like cells was demonstrated to be a significant mechanism of enhanced inflammation and lung tissue injury in high dose LPS-induced severe ARDS [100] (compare Fig. 9 .2). Moreover, in an experimental rat model of ARDS, necroptosis could be Injury-induced DAMPs (e.g., released from type I alveolar epithelial cells succumbing to RCD) activate innate immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes and M1-like macrophages that in turn promote acute pulmonary inflammation via secretion of proinflammatory mediator substances (e.g., cytokines). SAMPs mainly secreted by injury-activated M2-like macrophages contribute to resolution of alveolar inflammation via promotion of antiinflammatory mechanisms (e.g., production of IL-10), efferocytosis, and reepithelialization-the end result being repair of the alveolar barrier. AECI type I alveolar epithelial cells, AECII type II alveolar epithelial cells, ECM extracellular matrix, M\u00d8 macrophage, PMN polymorphonuclear leukocytes, RCD regulated cell death. (Sources: [110-113, 164, 455]) induced by oleic acid, also suggesting that the pathogenesis of this disease may involve necroptosis [101] . These first experimental findings are supported by a clinical study showing that blood transfusion-related ALI enhances the susceptibility to ARDS in critically ill transfused patients and mice through necroptosis of lung ECs [102] . Of note, besides necroptosis of alveolar cells, initial emerging evidence suggested that necroptosis and pyroptosis of alveolar macrophages may also play essential roles in the progression of lung inflammation resulting in ARDS [101, 103] . Nevertheless, the role of necroptosis and pyroptosis (and probably also ferroptosis) in the development of ARDS is to be determined more solidly by further targeted studies. Importantly, a role of NETs/NETosis in the pathogenesis of ARDS has also been reported. Based on an analysis of bronchial aspirates from ARDS patients showing NETs to be significantly correlated with the degree of ARDS, a hydrochloric acid (HCL) aspiration-induced ALI model was developed in mice to assess whether NETs are pathogenetic and whether targeting NETs is protective [104] . Indeed, with the use of this experimental model, the authors were successful in demonstrating that HCl aspiration causes severe lung injury, together with significantly increased levels of NETs, which are correlated with the severity of ALI \u2192 ARDS.",

Arrived in the lung, the mobile immune cells, in turn, get activated to produce further cytokines and chemokines as well as cytotoxic mediators such as ROS and proteolytic enzymes (proteases) and granular enzymes. Additionally, recruited dying neutrophils produce NETs. These products at the efferent arm of the innate immune response (in case of infection, plus adaptive immune T and B cells) mediate vascular endothelial and alveolar epithelial cell damage that leads to disruption of the alveolar endothelial and epithelial barriers (for in-depth articles, see [90, 95, 107, 108] ). It is this alveolar epithelium that can be regarded as a critical target of the innate immune attacks. It is composed of two types of cells, which, under homeostatic conditions, form a natural barrier. Type I cells, which make up 90% of the alveolar epithelium, are sensitive to toxins and oxidative stress and are prone to necrosis. They are easily injured compared to PRM-expressing type II cells, which make up 10% of the alveolar surface area and-as a defender of the alveolus-are involved in surfactant production and sodium transport, as well as induce proliferation and differentiation to type I cells contributing to alveolar epithelial repair [109] (compare Fig. 9 .2, and also Vol. 1 [1] , Part III, Sect. 9.2.4). The interaction between the epithelial barrier and the other barrier, that is, the microvascular endothelium plays a crucial role in controlling fluid accumulation in the alveolar space. The various inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators mentioned above promote RCD of both alveolar type I and II EpCs and ECs (apoptosis, necroptosis) leading to disruption of the barriers associated with hyperpermeability, resulting in pulmonary edema, intrapulmonary hemorrhage, severely impaired gas exchange, decreased lung compliance, and increased pulmonary arterial pressure. Further, the injury of alveolar epithelium impairs active fluid transport mechanisms in the lung, preventing reabsorption of edema fluid from the alveolar space, which is a key step in the resolution of ALI \u2192 ARDS (reviewed in [90, 95, 98, 107, 108] ).",

In particular, a shift from M1-like to M2-like macrophages appears to be the principal mechanism involved in this resolution of inflammation stage (compare Fig. 9 .2). The M2-like macrophages promote alveolar epithelial cell transition and fibrosis formation mainly by release of TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 [110, 112, 113] Fig. 8 .2).",

When this response is uncontrolled and exaggerated, it can lead to a life-threatening disease such as ARDS. This topic has been thoroughly reviewed by Kang et al. [121] discussing the demonstration of organ-specific DAMPs as involved in pathogen-induced sepsis, often associated with ARDS. For example, remarkably high levels of HMGB1 have been found in the pulmonary epithelial lining fluid of patients with sepsis [122] . Moreover, host-derived DAMPs, such as OxPLs and HMGB1, were shown to be generated during influenza virus infection and causing ALI [123] .",

Further, one small study of 21 patients with sepsis-induced ALI revealed that HMGB1 levels were higher in epithelial lung fluid and plasma compared to controls. Interestingly, these findings could be observed persistently during both the acute and subacute phases of ARDS [133] . In subsequent investigations, HMGB1 levels were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of trauma patients during mechanical ventilation and ventilator-associated pneumonia [134] . The authors reported that long-term mechanical ventilation is associated with increased HMGB1 levels that are elevated during ventilatorassociated pneumonia compared with healthy volunteers. In a more recent study on patients with severe pneumonia and ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation [135] , the investigators remarkably observed the day 1 HMGB1 concentration to be a critical, independent biomarker for ICU mortality.",

[138] could show that mitochondrial DAMPs including mtDNA, but also mFPs, can essentially trigger endothelial permeability changes as observed in ALI \u2192 ARDS (compare Sect. 8.3.3.3). Subsequent studies used several models to confirm the pathogenetic role of mtDNA in this life-threatening syndrome. Thus, in a model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced vascular injury in perfused isolated rat lungs, mtDNA (originating from the mammalian mitochondrial genome) was demonstrated to accumulate in the perfusion medium substantially [139] . In studies on a murine endotoxemia model, several experiments were performed to prove an effect of mtDNA on ALI [140] . In a first series of experiments using this model, mtDNA was found to be released in the plasma following intraperitoneal injection of LPS. In a second series of experiments, intraperitoneal administration of mtDNA was demonstrated to cause apparent ALI and systemic inflammation associated with increased IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 levels. Accompanying analyses provided evidence that the LPS-induced mtDNA release occurred in a TLR4dependent manner, whereas mtDNA-induced ALI and systemic inflammation happened in a TLR9-dependent but TLR4-independent mode [140] . Subsequent studies on a rat model of full-thickness thermal injury produced similar results by demonstrating increased mtDNA plasma concentrations and-as revealed by related experiments-mtDNA administration-caused severe ARDS. The critical pathogenetic role of mtDNA in the development of ALI \u2192 ARDS could be documented by another recent study on a rat intratracheal Pseudomonas aeruginosa model [141] .",

In these clinical investigations, detectable levels of mtDNA were found in packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets, with the latter two transfusion products containing significant amounts of mtDNA fragments. Also, the investigators observed a linear relationship between the mtDNA given during transfusion and the serum concentration of mtDNA fragments. Even more remarkably, the quantity of mtDNA in serum measured at 24 h after transfusion predicted the occurrence of ARDS. According to the authors' conclusion, these findings support the idea that mtDNA DAMPs in transfusion products significantly contribute to the incidence of ARDS after massive transfusions.",

As reported in patients with an acute history of severe blunt trauma [144] , circulating histones increase to toxic levels within 4 h and correlate with the severity of ALI. The high levels were significantly associated with markers of endothelial damage and coagulation activation. In in vitro systems, used in parallel to the clinical observation, histones were observed to damage ECs, stimulate cytokine release, and promote NET formation and myeloperoxidase release. In murine trauma models, cytokines and markers for endothelial damage and coagulation activation were shown to increase immediately after trauma or histone infusion significantly. Pathological examinations showed that the lungs were the predominantly affected organ with edema, hemorrhage, microvascular thrombosis, and neutrophil congestion [144] .",

Thus, unlike S100A8, S100A9 was found to promote mild neutrophil and lymphocyte influx, possibly mediated in part by increased mast cell degranulation and selective upregulation of some chemokine genes. Moreover, the S100 proteins did not significantly induce proinflammatory mediators, including TNF, IL-1\u03b2, or IL-6. Furthermore, compared to the marked increase induced by S100A8, S100A8/A9 or S100A9 did not alter substantially basal IL-10 mRNA over the time course tested. Also, like S100A8, S100A9 and S100A8/A9 were shown to reduce neutrophil influx in ALI provoked by LPS challenge but were somewhat less inhibitory, possibly, because of differential effects on expression of some chemokines.",

DAMPs released from the ECM in the form of proteolytically cleaved fragments (Class IIA DAMPs) can reportedly contribute to ALI \u2192 ARDS (for class IIA DAMPs, see Sect. 3.4.2 and also Vol. 1 [1] , Part IV, Sect. 13.2). Such a DAMP is hyaluronan (HA), or fragment of hyaluronan (fHA) that was shown to be associated with organ dysfunction in ARDS (for HA, see Vol. 1 [1] , Part IV, Sect. 13.2.3.2). As reviewed by Esposito et al. [158] , increased fHA deposition has been demonstrated in the lung tissue of rats with bleomycin-induced lung injury and in humans suffering from ARDS; also, increased HA synthesis has been observed in nonhuman primates with ARDS. Notably, in a clinical study on ARDS patients [158] , increasing circulating and alveolar fHA levels were demonstrated to be associated with the severity of ALI. Moreover, the investigators noticed that alveolar fHA was apparently related to respiratory organ dysfunction rather than systemic organ dysfunction, while circulating fHA was found to be related to systemic organ dysfunction. Given these observations, the authors suggested compartmentalized effects of fHA in ARDS. Mechanistically, they discussed the possibility that-besides others-fHA may initiate inflammatory responses via TLRs [158] . In this context, it is worth mentioning another clinical study on ARDS patients providing evidence that some urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), including fHA, can be used as predictive biomarkers in ARDS [159] .",

It is the task of SAMPs, in particular, SPMs, to execute these events. In fact, as emphasized by Levy and Serhan [160] , restitution of barrier integrity, recruitment of monocytoid cells, as well as promotion of M2-like macrophage-mediated clearance of dead cells and tissue debris are all proresolving responses orchestrated by SPMs (compare Fig. 9 .2).",

They found that adenosine kinase is repressed during inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. This repression reportedly translates into a protective response during pulmonary inflammation, as observed in animal experiments involving genetic repression of adenosine kinase. Moreover, the investigators could demonstrate in pharmacological studies that the in vivo inhibition of adenosine kinase (associated with elevated adenosine) mitigates tissue injury during pulmonary inflammation.

Thus, the incidence of COPD has increased in the past few decades and has become a major public health problem and will remain a challenge for clinicians within the twenty-first century. Worldwide, COPD is in the spotlight, since its high prevalence, morbidity, and mortality create enormous challenges for healthcare systems (reviewed in [170, 171] ). The development of COPD is mainly the result of continued exposure to various environmental risk factors, although genetic host factors have a role in determining disease susceptibility and pathogenesis (reviewed in [172, 173] ). Among the environmental factors, cigarette smoking is a significant risk factor for COPD, but environmental tobacco smoking also contributes to its development. Occupational exposure to vapor, dust, gas, and fumes, as well as outdoor air pollution, is another important risk factor for disease exacerbation and mortality.",

Also, the adaptive (auto)immune system is activated in COPD, as documented by lung infiltration of Th1, Th17, and B cells, along with a decrease in Tregs in the airways. Moreover, an impact of the lung microbiome on COPD progression and risk of exacerbation has been described. And not to forget are epigenetic modifications that have been reported in patients with COPD to be sometimes linked to disease severity and susceptibility. Together, all these processes result in this typical heterogeneous and complex pulmonary disease (for reviews, see [175] [176] [177] [178] [179] [180] [181] [182] ). Importantly, as reviewed by Poh et al. [183] , COPD can \"overlap\" with other respiratory diseases, including bronchiectasis, fibrosis, and obstructive sleep apnea. While COPD alone confers morbidity and mortality, common features with contrasting clinical outcomes can occur in COPD \"overlap syndromes,\" such as asthma-COPD, bronchiectasis-COPD, and fibrosis-COPD.",

Thus, in vitro and preclinical in vivo studies could show that SPMs have bronchoprotective proresolving effects. For example, RvD1 was demonstrated to reduce significantly neutrophilic lung inflammation and proinflammatory cytokine production caused by smoke exposure and promote differentiation of M2-like macrophages associated with enhanced capacity for neutrophil efferocytosis [198] . Also, in this study, RvD1 was found to accelerate the resolution of lung inflammation when given after the final smoke exposure. Clinically, patients suffering from moderate to severe COPD were observed to have reduced levels of LXA4 and LXB4 in exhaled breath condensates [199, 200] .",

In addition to these insights into lung physiology and disease pathogenesis provided by measuring the presence of DAMPs and SAMPs, monitoring of a DAMP/SAMP signature would be an additional option to improve current therapeutic modalities. This concept would allow us to define and design an appropriate and individualized strategy for the treatment of COPD patients (DAMPs as therapeutic targets and SAMPs as therapeutics; see Sect. 9.9.3), without risking the untoward side effects (i.e., immunosuppression), mediated by traditional antiinflammatory medications.",

In particular, the recognition that DAMPs are emitted during the very treatment aimed to reduce mortality, that is, therapeutic mechanical ventilation, has opened new ways of therapeutic strategies. Additionally, by understanding the role of DAMPs as biomarkers in the pathophysiology of ALI \u2192 ARDS, a new category of rational therapeutic targets has gained considerable attention. Moreover, the new mechanistic insights into the process of transition from DAMP-promoted inflammation to SAMP-driven resolution of inflammation are now appreciated as a critical prerequisite to survive the hyperinflammatory and subsequent fibroproliferative stages of ALI \u2192 ARDS. Plausibly, in case of progressive therapy-resistant ALI \u2192 ARDS (that might eventually proceed to COPD), administration of SAMPs would be a stringent therapeutic option to implement soon clinically (see Sect. 9.9.3.3). Certainly, to reach this goal, further targeted studies on experimental animal models of ALI are needed. In particular, sophisticated determination of DAMPs and SAMPs, including monitoring the DAMP/SAMP signature, during different phases of ARDS would be necessary to identify those patients in whom such a therapeutic intervention could be beneficial. Similar concluding remarks can be made for DAMPs involved in COPD. Current studies so far available demonstrate that DAMPs occur in both lung microenvironment and serum. Nevertheless, further exploration of DAMPs in their capacity to influence COPD progression is needed. In particular, that is, in the burning interest of current environmental research and public health, it is time for urgent health studies on the pathogenetic role of air pollutants operating as exogenous DAMPs in COPD.",

Acute renal injury is dangerous and costly, affecting around one in five patients' emergency admissions to the hospital. The organ-specific injury, formerly known as \"acute renal failure (ARF),\" has been traditionally described as a rapid decrease (ranging from hours to weeks to less than 3 months) in kidney function as measured by increases in serum creatinine.

As typical for efferent innate immune responses, numerous interactions between these cells have been described (for cells of the innate immune system, also compare Vol. 1 [1] , Part III). Thus, following a reduction in effective kidney perfusion, EpCs are unable to maintain adequate intracellular ATP, and its depletion results in various forms of DAMP-emitting RCD. During an ischemic insult, all segments of the nephron can be affected, but the most commonly injured EpC is the proximal tubular cell. Additionally, the other major EpCs of the nephron involved in the pathophysiology of ischemic AKI are those of the medullary thick ascending limb, located distally. As a typical consequence of hemodynamic disturbances and ischemia-promoted ATP depletion, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton occurs that is associated with the loss of tight junctions and adheren junctions resulting in decline of function and decrease in glomerular filtration rate.",

Inflammation is a critical trigger for further forms of RN (e.g., necroptosis), whereby both events can drive the autoamplification loop of necroinflammation [223] . Mechanistically, cytokines operating as inducible DAMPs may be discussed to trigger secondary RN (e.g., TNF in necroptosis). Moreover, the PRM-expressing ECs and VSMCs of the microcirculation play critical roles in the pathophysiology of AKI. Thus, ischemia has reportedly profound effects on the renal endothelium, resulting in microvascular dysregulation and continued ischemia and further injury, especially in the outer stripe of the kidney. Importantly, the initial ischemic insult is aggravated by a number of factors, including activation of the clotting cascade, the formation of microthrombi within the vascular lumen, and impaired vascular reactivity. A characteristic feature of the latter is increased vasoconstriction and decreased vasodilatation, promoted by vasoactive mediators including the inducible IIIA-8 DAMP ET-1 [225] (for ET-1, compare Sect. 3.5.3.6, and Vol. 1 [1] , Part IV, Sect. 14.2.5.3, and Fig. 14.2) . Notably, like DAMP-activated EpCs, DAMP-activated renal ECs also secrete necroinflammatory cytokines that are so important in the pathogenesis of ischemic AKI.",

In principle, however, one can assume that the same mechanisms govern this active innate immune process as observed in other models on examining resolving inflammatory pathways. Such an assumption is supported by recent studies showing that polarization of macrophages into the M2-like type contributes to resolution of inflammation in AKI (reviewed in [229] , also compare Sect. 5.3.2). Interestingly, the cold-shock protein Y-box-binding protein-1(YB-1)-a transcriptional and translational factor, which regulates many cellular processes including cell proliferation, DNA repair, and cellular stress response-has recently been reported to orchestrate onset and resolution of renal inflammation via IL-10 gene regulation [230, 231] . However, these preliminary findings suggest that YB-1 is an antiinflammatory molecule rather than an inflammation-resolving factor, i.e., a SAMP. Further publications of exciting data from this research field can be expected.",

For example, in studies on a murine IRI model, HMGB1 was found to be expressed/upregulated, and its blockade was shown to reduce renal IRI by dampening the inflammatory response [232] . In other lines of studies on a murine IRI/AKI model, ischemia alone was found to be associated with release of HMGB1. Subsequent postischemic reperfusion appeared to induce localization of HMGB1 to renal tubules, peritubular capillaries, and glomeruli, where the renal cells might be more susceptible to ischemic insult [233] . In this study, administration of blocking antibody to HMGB1 was shown to be associated with a reduction in tubular apoptosis and inflammation in situ and in vivo with preservation of renal function. In view of these findings, the authors suggested that released HMGB1 by ischemic renal parenchyma cells may act as an essential early mediator in delayed inflammatory response during IRI, and targeting HMGB1 may represent a potential therapeutic approach in the prevention of clinical IRI associated with kidney transplantation. In support of these findings is a more recently published report showing that preconditioning with recombinant HMGB1 affords significant protection from TLR4dependent kidney IRI, indicating therapeutic potential [234] .",

Moreover, in other lines of studies, neutralizing HMGB1 with an anti-HMGB1 antibody was shown to ameliorate chronic CsA nephrotoxicity via inhibition of the TLR4 signaling pathway [236] . Also, in studies on chemotherapy drugs against cancer, cisplatin-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation was found to contribute to HMGB1 release from kidney proximal tubular cells, resulting in the promotion of inflammation during cisplatin nephrotoxicity [237] . However, the research area of DAMPs in drug-induced nephrotoxicity is poorly explored. On the other hand, these molecules may serve as valuable biomarkers in view of the fact that currently used routine biomarkers such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen increase late in the course of injury and only after substantial kidney injury occurs, when the damage may be irreversible. Thus, clinical work is desired to see if DAMPs prove useful in clinical trials with nephrotoxic drugs and can be translated to the clinic for standard patient care (also compare Sect. 9.9.2).",

The authors showed that dying tubular EpCs release histones into the extracellular space that directly interact with TLR2 and TLR4 to induce MyD88, NF-\u03baB, and MAPK signaling. They further demonstrated that these DAMPs also had directly toxic effects on renal ECs and tubular EpCs in vitro. In addition, the investigators could show that direct injection of histones into the renal arteries of mice results in induction of leukocyte recruitment, microvascular vascular leakage, renal inflammation, and structural features of AKI in a TLR2/TLR4-dependent manner. Extended experiments of the group revealed that neutralizing anti-histone IgG can suppress intrarenal inflammation, neutrophil infiltration, and tubular cell necrosis and improve renal excretory function. Notably, in recently extended studies, the Anders group could demonstrate that histones and NETs enhance tubular necrosis and remote organ injury in ischemic AKI [246] . In sum, and also discussed elsewhere [247, 248] , the release of histones from dying cells-like other DAMPs described here-support the concept that renal damage-triggered emission of DAMPs elicits a robust efferent innate immune response, which contributes to the pathogenesis of AKI.",

Uromodulin is selectively produced by the cells of the thick ascending limb and secreted into urine from the apical cell membrane. The function of uromodulin remains elusive, but the available data suggest that this protein might regulate salt transport, protect against urinary tract infection and kidney stones, and have roles in kidney injury and innate immunity (reviewed in [249] ). As outlined by Anders and Schaefer [250] , under homeostatic conditions, uromodulin is immunologically inert inside the tubular lumen. However, injury to tubular cells enables uromodulin to leak into the interstitial compartment, where it turns into a DAMP that activates interstitial TLR4-bearing DCs [251] . Notably, other lines of studies have demonstrated that uromodulin can trigger activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in the release of IL-1\u03b2 [252] .

For example, as outlined [254] , the glomerular ultrafiltrate can be enriched with minerals, proteins, or drug metabolites, especially in states of volume depletion promoting supersaturation. This acute condition can induce a sudden onset of crystal formation, resulting in acute episodes of crystal-induced tubular cell injury, interstitial inflammation, and impairment of renal function. Supersaturation of urine leads to crystallization of solutes in renal tubules. Subsequently, these crystallized deposits contribute to kidney injury by inducing direct and indirect cytotoxicity as well as by setting up an autoamplification loop of necroinflammation. Whereas direct cytotoxicity is associated with emission of various DAMPs, indirect cytotoxicity can be mediated via crystal-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in pyroptosis [255] (for crystals as DAMPs, NLRP3, and pyroptosis, compare also Vol. 1 [1] , Part IV, Sect. 12.2.5, and Part V, Sect. 19.3.4).",

Interestingly, the investigators could demonstrate a partial beneficial effect of this therapeutic maneuver by observing a reduction of urinary DAMPs and removal of plasma DAMPs. However, the higher clearance rate of DAMPs, especially HSP70 and HMGB1, was significantly associated with immune disorders (immunosuppression!) and poor prognosis. The unsatisfactory outcome of the study is difficult to explain. At least it may be a warning sign not to interfere therapeutically with DAMP concentrations without strict monitoring of the homeostatic DAMP/SAMP ratio (compare Sect. 7.3.3).",

In other lines of studies in mice [260] , microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1)-an inducible enzyme that converts prostaglandin H2 to PGE2-was observed to exert potentially protective effect against renal fibrosis and inflammation induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction. Also, as revealed by studies on various AKI models, there is accumulating direct and indirect evidence for a protective role of extracellular adenosine in renal injury-induced inflammation and fibrosis. The topic has been thoroughly reviewed by Bauerle et al. [261] . The authors concluded: \"Extracellular adenosine is a central signaling molecule involved in modulation of inflammatory events and mediating adaptation to hypoxia. Adenosine signaling helps alleviate ischemic injury in other organs, and more recently, experimental studies show promising results in AKI as well. Such studies highlight pharmacologic strategies to enhance extracellular adenosine signaling or the targeting of individual adenosine receptors, particularly, the A1, A2A, or A2BAR are effective in preventing or treating AKI from ischemia in murine models.\"",

Besides AKI, acute repetitive or persistent insults to the renal parenchyma associated with chronic inflammation in terms of nonresolving inflammation can result in permanent fibrosis and renal dysfunction, which, if left untreated, may progress to CKD. Chronic kidney disease is defined by structural abnormalities or impaired excretory renal function, suggestive of a loss of functional nephrons. Risk factors for the development and progression of CKD include low nephron number at birth, nephron loss due to increasing age, and-as addressed here-acute or chronic kidney injuries caused by toxic exposures or diseases, for example, hypertension, obesity, and T2DM (for review, see [263] ).",

The progression of CKD associated with chronic inflammation in terms of nonresolving inflammation is characterized by the constant loss of renal cells and their replacement by overshooting repairing responses. Thus, one of the consequences of CKD is glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis caused by an imbalance between excessive synthesis and reduced breakdown of the ECM [263, 264] . Typically, as with fibrosis in other organs, renal interstitial fibrosis results from activation and proliferation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, secretion and accumulation of ECM, and displacement of normal renal tubules. Profibrotic factors such as DAMPs are released/secreted by injured tubular epithelial and infiltrated inflammatory cells such as macrophages to promote complex cascades of signaling events leading to this myofibroblastic activation, proliferation, and ECM production [265] [266] [267] (see Sects. 6.4 and 6.5; for additional information see also Vol. 1 [1] , Part VIII, Sect. 36.4, p. 851).",

For example, in studies on a murine IRI model, an inhibitor of HMGB1 release, the grape seed proanthocyanidin extract was shown to attenuate IRIinduced chronic renal fibrosis [268] . In other lines of studies on a model of immune-mediated EMT established in human proximal tubular EpCs, human recombinant HMGB1 treatment was shown to induce alterations in epithelial morphology consistent with EMT, thereby indicating a potentially crucial DAMP in the development of renal fibrosis [269] . Again in other sets of studies on a murine model of unilateral ureteral obstruction-mediated renal fibrosis under ER stress, indirect evidence was provided showing that HMGB1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis [270] .

As such DAMPs, crystals such as calcium oxalates have already been demonstrated to contribute to renal inflammation in nephrocalcinosis, leading to renal fibrosis (see Mulay and Anders [273] ). Interestingly, there is evidence for a pathogenetic role of ASC specks in this scenario, that is, an inducible DAMP as denoted from the perspective of this book (see Sects. 2.2.5.4 and 3.5.4.2). For instance, in studies on the murine unilateral ureteral obstruction model of CKD, ASC speck deficiency was found to significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine expression and improve subsequent renal fibrosis [274] . Also, in these studies, ASC was observed to be specifically upregulated in collecting duct EpCs. In this context, it is worthwhile mentioning an experiment showing that macrophage uptake of necrotic cell DNA activates the AIM2 inflammasome to regulate a proinflammatory phenotype in CKD [275] (for AIM2 inflammasome, see Sect. 2.2.8).",

Indeed, initial evidence in support of such a concept has already been published, for example, by Higashi et al. [265] who reported on analysis studies on gene expression patterns among fibroblast populations at different stages of injury or repair. The investigators could demonstrate that inherent gene expression changes in activated fibroblasts accompany the transition from AKI to repair and regeneration. However, in chronic models, activated fibroblasts were found to be resistant to the antifibrotic effects of the SAMP PGE2 due to suppression of a subset of PGE receptors. Also, there is preliminary evidence for the SAMP AnxA1 to have protective effects in renal fibrosis. For instance, in studies on a rat fibrosis model, activation of AnxA1 signaling in renal fibroblasts was demonstrated to exert antifibrotic effects [276] .",

Nevertheless, the exact molecular mechanisms for the development of AKI and renal fibrosis have not been fully explored. Notably, recent advances in epigenetic research have also raised interest in the role of epigenetic modifications in acute renal inflammation and fibrosis. In fact, there is already first evidence of activation of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in both acute renal disease and susceptibility to CKD [266, [278] [279] [280] [281] . Should the concept of DAMP-promoted epigenetic modifications once been confirmed, novel therapeutic modalities for AKI and CKD may be provided (compare here also Sect. 6.6; for additional information see Vol.1 [1] , Part VI, Sect. 24.2.4.4, p. 644: DAMP-Induced Trained Immunity, as also briefly described in Sect. 3.7). Such a therapeutic approach is even more desirable regarding the potential AKI-to-CKD transition or the acute repetitive/persistent injury-mediated kidney fibrosis mentioned above. Here, the proposal for future continuous monitoring of a DAMP/ SAMP signature may help make therapeutic decisions on when to use DAMPs as therapeutic targets and SAMPs as therapeutics.",

Today, there is accumulating evidence indicating that hepatocytes succumb mainly from various subroutines of insult-induced RCD, which serve as productive sources of DAMPs emission to trigger hepatic necroinflammatory pathways. Indeed, the hepatocytes can be regarded as the targets of any injury since they have been shown to succumb from apoptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis [295] [296] [297] [298] [299] . The various forms of RCD have been best investigated in drug-induced hepatic cell death (reviewed by Iorga et al. [300, 301] ). Interestingly, it is not APAP itself that causes hepatotoxicity but rather a reactive metabolite, the N-acetyl-pbenzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Under normal circumstances, NAPQI is rapidly converted to nontoxic metabolites by GSH. However, in situations of GSH depletion, such as APAP overdose, chronic alcohol ingestion, and malnutrition, NAPQI persists and leads to liver injury that induces severe liver cell damage and results in inflammation and hepatocyte cell death. Mechanistically, several damaging effects of NAPQI are discussed, including formation of protein adducts by reacting with sulfhydryl groups resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death (for further reading, see the relevant articles [300, [302] [303] [304] ).",

This observation let suggest that, besides necroptosis, ferroptotic cell death may also occur in APAP hepatotoxicity (for ferroptosis, see Sect. 4.3.4, and compare Vol. 1 [1] , Part V, Sect. 19.3.3). Indeed, and remarkably, in earlier studies, this subroutine of RCD has already been described to be involved in APAP-induced cell death [309] . Together, the description of the various subroutines of RN in APAP hepatotoxicity strongly suggests a dominating role of DAMPs in mediating innate immune local and lethal systemic necroinflammation in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity.",

Regarding pathological features, hepatocyte necrosis occurs due to ATP depletion causing cellular swelling and cell membrane disruption. Although not specifically quantitatively defined, severe liver injury patterns are identified as diffuse, massive, and zonal with massive hepatic necrosis, with near-complete parenchymal necrosis associated with variable inflammation and ductular reaction as the most severe pathologic presentation of ALF [284, 311] . The systemic pathology of ALF at autopsy is generally that of multiorgan system failure. All organ systems can be affected, but most clinically relevant is the development of encephalopathy.

In more recent studies on an APAP-induced liver injury model in support of this concept, improvement of resolution and liver regeneration was found to be mainly mediated by M2-like macrophages. Mechanistically, the investigators [312] could show that the chemokine CCL5 can facilitate M1-like macrophage polarization and impede M2-like polarization. Similar observations were made in studies on another experimental model of acute hepatic injury in mice, suggesting that polarization of macrophages from the M1-like phenotype to the M2-like phenotype is implicated in amelioration of liver injury and accelerated hepatic regeneration [313] . So far, however, there are only a few reports on the demonstration of SAMPs in acute liver injury, as briefly touched below.",

A subsequent experiment on a liver IRI model did not only confirm these findings but could also show that HMGB1 (and also histones (see below)) promote NET formation through the TLR signaling pathway. Development of NETs subsequently exacerbates organ damage and initiates inflammatory responses during liver IRI [326] .",

For example, in a lethal APAP overdose model in mice, HMGB1 was found to impair hepatocyte regeneration markedly, and blockade of HMGB1 was observed to enhance the late-phase liver structure recovery significantly [329] . In other experiments on a murine APAP-induced acute liver injury model, neutralization of HMGB1 with a chimeric antibody was shown to attenuate the early phase of post-injury inflammation [330] . Also, in other lines of experiments on APAP-challenged hepatocytes in vivo and in vitro [331] , release of HMGB1 was significantly detected in both liver perfusate from APAP-treated mice and culture supernatant of APAP-challenged hepatocytes.",

In earlier studies on an APAP-induced liver injury model, uric acid was already suggested to trigger a cell death-induced inflammatory response [343] . Information about eATP as a critical DAMP involved in APAP hepatotoxicity was documented in experiments on mice genetically deficient in the purinoreceptor P2X7. These studies demonstrated that exposure to this DAMP (and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), as well as the P2X7 receptor, is required for manifestations of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity [344] Fig. 22.11) . Other sets of experiments on a murine model of APAP poisoning revealed remarkable changes in the liver environment during APAP overdose that were dependent on eATP signaling [345] . Consequently, inhibition of ATP action was shown to reduce the liver damage significantly. Moreover, in these studies, primary mouse hepatocytes also developed hyperresponsiveness to eATP following APAP exposure, which was prevented by a P2 purine receptor blocker. Also, human-derived cells cultivated in vitro were shown to be protected from these toxic effects when the same blockage strategy was employed. The authors of this study [345] postulated that ATP released from necrotic cells may cause cell death or accelerate APAP-induced cell death. However, subsequently published data, demonstrated in four different types of hepatocytes (human and mouse), could not confirm this concept [346] . Today, one may discuss the unproven possibility that eATP may contribute to APAP-induced cell death via promotion of pyroptotic cell death.",

This chronic disorder is defined as the acute deterioration of pre-existing chronic liver disease, usually related to an acute precipitating event in terms of an acute infectious or sterile liver injury [285, 286] . Typically, ACLF is observed in patients suffering from cirrhosis that undergoes acute decompensation. The epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, characteristics, clinical course, and prognosis of ACLF have recently been detailed in the CANONIC study, an extensive multicenter European prospective observational investigation in >1000 patients treated for acute decompensation of cirrhosis [357] . Of note, pathogenetically, ACLF develops in the setting of an exacerbated systemic inflammatory response to initial infectious or sterile acute liver damage, that is, hepatic injuries associated with the emission of MAMPs and DAMPs or DAMPs. As also observed in SIRS associated, for instance, with polytrauma (see Sects. 5.4.2.2 and 8.3.2.2), this hyperinflammatory response is associated with MOF resulting in a high short-term mortality rate [358, 359] . Until to date, the pathogenetic role of MAMPs and DAMPs or DAMPs in ACLF is not firmly proven but intensely proposed and discussed [358, 360] . However, given their documentation in SIRS (see Sects. 5.4. 2.3 and 8.3.3) , they operate in this acute liver disease most likely and will undoubtedly be described in more detail soon.",

Besides Kupffer cells, other cells such as profibrotic macrophages, neutrophils, DCs, and T/B lymphocytes also contribute to chronic hepatic inflammation-today interpreted as nonresolving inflammation-that is considered to lead to fibrogenesis/fibrosis. Together, constitutive DAMPs released from cells undergoing RCD as well as inducible DAMPs secreted by activated inflammatory cells (e.g., TGF-\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2 (see below))-together with MAMPs in case of infectious injury-activate PRMbearing HSCs which transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts (reviewed in [321, 322, 364] ). These activated HSCs then, via both serving as the major source of ECM production and interacting with the ECM, drive the mechanisms resulting in liver fibrosis/cirrhosis (Fig. 9.4) . This process occurs via epigenetic modifications late in the proliferative phase and is also called activation of myofibroblasts (for details of transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts and epigenetic modifications, see Sects. 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6).",

As outlined in Sect. 6.4.2, several DAMPs such as HMGB1, S100A8, S100A9, and GAL-3, as well as, in particular, TGF-\u03b2 (denoted as an inducible DAMP in this book) have been reported to drive fibrogenesis. Moreover, the DAMP-driven self-perpetuating Fig. 9 .4 Simplified diagrammatic model of the pathogenetic role of DAMPs in promoting activation of PRM-bearing HSCs to \"myofibroblast-like\" HSCs serving as the major source of ECM production and interacting with the ECM to drive liver fibrosis. Constitutive DAMPs are released from necrotic hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, whereas inducible DAMPs are either released from pyroptotic Kupffer cells (IL-1\u03b2) or secreted by these cells (TGF-\u03b2). Interaction of \"myofibroblastlike\" HSCs with ECM through integrin-mediated bi-directional \"inside-out and outside-in\" transmembrane mechanotransduction (symbolized by the two blue/violet-colored bi-directional arrows) leads to progressive liver fibrosis (compare Sect. 6.3 and Fig. 6.1) .

            "text": "Inflammation \u2192 Liver Fibrosis Some distinct constitutive DAMPs involved in liver fibrosis have already been identified and are selectively mentioned here. For example, early in vitro experiments provided already evidence for HMGB1 to activate HSCs [367] . In the context of chronic liver disease, HMGB1 has reportedly been implicated in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and liver fibrosis (reviewed in [368] ). Of interest is the clinical observation that liver HMGB1 protein expression correlates with fibrosis stage in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection and primary biliary cirrhosis [369] . Serum levels of HMGB1 were also found to be increased in these patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting secretion of this DAMP. Also, in studies on mice, S100A4 was found to be secreted by a subpopulation of macrophages and to promote the development of liver fibrosis [370] . The authors could show that this DAMP activates HSCs and accumulates in the liver during the progression of liver fibrosis. Further, in studies on mice, the NLRP3-activating IA-2DAMP eATP was shown to potentiate HSC activation (and thus ECM deposition), dependent on P2X7R-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation [371] (for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, compare Sect. 2.2.5). Inducible DAMPs have also been reported to activate HSCs. For instance, IL-1\u03b2 was shown to promote the proliferation of rat HSCs, whereby IL-1 type I receptor (IL1R1), JNK, and AP-1 pathways were observed to be involved in this process [372] . Last but not least, the inducible DAMP TGF-\u03b21 was shown to play a critical role in the development of hepatic fibrosis by triggering the Smad (Smad2, Smad3, Smad4) signaling pathway (known to operate in HSCs) [373] (Fig. 9.4 ; also compare Fig. 6 .3).",

Indeed, preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting SPMs being able to enhance nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and fibrosis resolution has already recently been reviewed [374] . Although the concept is still not validly proven, preliminary supportive data in this research field were already reported. For example, in studies on the murine model of hepatic IRI mentioned above [352] , the interesting finding was observed that RvD1 modulates macrophage polarization in that it attenuates the IRI-induced increase of proinflammatory M1 marker genes in Kupffer cells, associated with a decrease of M2 marker genes. As also observed by the investigators, RvD1 markedly augments the efferocytic activity of Kupffer cells. Together, these findings indicated antiinflammatory and proresolving actions of RvD1, suggesting that this SAMP might interfere with the development of liver fibrosis. A similar concept can be discussed when looking at the studies on a murine model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis also mentioned above [347] . In these studies, the authors observed that in vitro addition of recombinant AnxA1 to macrophages isolated from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis livers downmodulates M1 polarization through stimulation of IL-10 production; again a clue that administration of SAMPs might interfere with the development of liver fibrosis.",

This is all the more so, as many experimental data have provided evidence of the reversibility of liver fibrosis [375] . In particular, identification of key DAMPs found to activate/transdifferentiate HSCs as the major drivers of liver fibrogenesis may serve as a potential target of antifibrotic therapy.

The effects of alcohol consumption on mortality are higher than those of tuberculosis (2.3%), human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (1.8%), diabetes (2.8%), hypertension (1.6%), digestive diseases (4.5%), road injuries (2.5%), and violence (0.8%). As known, excessive drinking over decades injures nearly every organ in the body. However, the liver sustains the earliest and the highest degree of tissue injury from excessive drinking because this substance of abuse is mainly metabolized by liver cells, which express high levels of two major alcohol oxidizing enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase, and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2 E1) (reviewed in [377, 378] ).",

The pathological progression of ALD is overwhelmingly driven by DAMPpromoted inflammatory processes. Also, as a typical feature of ALD, MAMPs derived from gut microbes, which translocate to the mesenteric lymphatic system and portal circulation, contribute in concert with DAMPs to the establishment of hepatic inflammation (for reviews, see [48, 380] ). Moreover, intestinal dysbiotic microbiota and impaired intestinal barrier integrity are additional critical players in the pathophysiology of acute alcoholic steatohepatitis. Such involvement of MAMPs in innate immune inflammatory pathways is facilitated by increased gut permeability, caused by chronic alcohol consumption. This scenario is known to result in higher amounts of LPS in portal and systemic blood of patients with ALD [381, 382] (for the function of LPS as a possible microbe-derived exogenous DAMP in triggering innate immune inflammatory pathways, compare also Sect. 3.2.2 and Vol.1 [1] , Part IV, Sect. 11.3).

Of interest in this context are recent studies in mice [388] , showing that overexpression of the adipose-specific lipin-1 (an enzyme involved in the generation of diacylglycerol during synthesis of phospholipids and triglycerides) can cause lipid peroxidation and promote ferroptotic liver damage after ethanol administration.",

In this earlier study, the investigators further demonstrated that HMGB1 increases both in liver and serum from patients with acute alcoholic steatohepatitis superimposed on ALD and cirrhosis and that there is a correlation among the progressive increase in HMGB1 expression, translocation, and secretion with ALD stage in humans. Moreover, in parallel-conducted mouse models of alcohol-induced liver injury, they found that alcohol intake facilitates hepatic and serum HMGB1 expression, translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and secretion in these animals similar to what they observed in humans [389] . In a clinical study in patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis aimed to identify potential predictive biomarkers (together with MAMPs) for disease severity and clinical outcomes, HMGB1 was evaluated as a potential indicator of disease severity [390] . In this study, the investigators found HMGB1 to be increased in the acute phase of the disease and positively correlated with model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (a MELD score is a number that ranges from 6 to 40, based on laboratory tests to assess the urgency for a liver transplant, see [391] ). There is also first evidence suggesting a role of the inflammasome in promoting the progression of ALD [392] . This initial suggestion was supported by studies in mice showing that deficiency of NLRP3 prevents the development of alcohol-induced liver inflammation and significantly ameliorates liver damage and steatosis [393] . Further data from this study indicated that ethanol-damaged hepatocytes release uric acid, and eATP, that is, inflammasome-activating IA-2 DAMPs, which are recognized by liver immune cells as inflammatory signals. The authors argued that \"the final common pathway of this signaling is most likely represented by the activation of inflammasome, which is required for processing and activation of IL-1\u03b2, a key inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of alcoholic steatohepatitis\u2026\" [393] . More recently conducted studies on alcoholic hepatitis human and animal liver samples and hepatocytes provided evidence demonstrating that alcohol induces pyroptosis of hepatocytes by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated by TXNIP overexpression [394] (for TXNIP, denoted as a metabolic DAMP in this book, acting in NLRP3 inflammasome, see Vol. 1 [1] , Part IV, Sect. 13.4.6.3, and Part VI, Sect. 22.4.2.2).",

As a pivotal event to develop liver fibrosis, activation of HSCs leads to production of ECM proteins; different cell types such as portal fibroblasts and bone marrow-derived myofibroblasts are also supposed to contribute but to a lesser extent (also compare Sect. 6.2). Together, one can assume that development of liver fibrosis transitioning to cirrhosis represents the work of DAMPs again.

            "text": "As reviewed [398, 400] , the complete pathogenesis of this disease is not entirely known but is supposed to originate from alcohol's effects on the small pancreatic ducts and acinar cells. The pancreas uses oxidative and non-oxidative metabolism to process alcohol. The oxidative pathway leads to the formation of acetaldehyde that causes detrimental effects in acinar cells through activation of stellate cells and increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. The non-oxidative path requires the formation of fatty acid ethyl ester synthase, which leads to activation of key transcription factors, sustained increases in intracellular calcium, and inhibition of ECM, finally resulting in further cell injury. Moreover, alcohol also promotes premature activation of trypsinogen and other digestive and lysosomal enzymes within the acinar cells, thereby promoting the pancreatic tissue to auto-digest. The whole scenario contributes to aggravation of pancreatic inflammation. Another contributing mechanism is intra-acinar activation of NF-\u03baB that further drives the inflammatory response. The NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response appears to be typically associated with acute pancreatitis, as well as the potentially fatal SIRS as the worst outcome of this disease. In other words and from the perspective of this book, the scenario of alcohol-induced pancreatitis reflects the work of local emission of DAMPs which might systemically be released in case of SIRS/MOF (a topic that \"cries for proving determinations\"!).",

Although alcoholic pancreatitis can remain an acute disorder, in many cases, this acute disease progresses to chronic alcoholic pancreatitis. Notably, it was reported that such a progression from acute to chronic pancreatitis is most common in habitual alcohol abusers, indicating that excessive alcohol consumption is involved in acute pancreatitis progressing to a chronic fibrotic disorder (reviewed in [400] ). Typically, chronic pancreatitis is a syndrome characterized by chronic progressive pancreatic inflammation (obviously in terms of nonresolving inflammation) that progresses to fibrosis and scarring, resulting in loss of exocrine (acinar), endocrine (islet cells), and ductal cells [401] . The pathogenesis of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis is poorly understood, but current notions hold that chronic alcohol consumption sensitizes the acinar cell to injury by interfering with mechanisms that protect against ER stress. The alcohol injury-induced complex chronic inflammatory disorder that is linked to genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors leads to the development of pancreatic insufficiency, steatorrhea, diabetes, pancreatic calcification, and fibrosis (reviewed in [402] ).",

In the original model, mechanisms for secondary injury were hypothesized based on then-contemporary understandings of Immunology and cellular pathology.\" Today, this model can be easily explained by systemic release of locally emitted DAMPs into the blood circulation.

Intrinsically, any bone fracture leads to emission of bona fide DAMPs, which initiate a healing efferent innate immune response. Again, there is a double role of DAMPs in case of bone fracture: local emission promotes fracture healing (see Sect. 8.2.3 [409] ), and massive emission and systemic distribution may lead to remote organ injuries such as TBI and ALI. Indeed, earlier experimental studies have already demonstrated an increase in cytokines within human fracture site hematomas, as well as in the systemic circulation of patients sustaining fracture [410] .

According to the authors' conclusion, these data demonstrate a critical role for an HMGB1 \u2192 TLR4 pathway in the initiation of systemic inflammation and end-organ injury following isolated peripheral tissue injury. More recent experiments on a model of closed fracture musculoskeletal injury in mice supported these data by demonstrating that the upregulated expression of HMGB1 mRNA after injury-indicating infliction of sterile inflammation-could be significantly decreased by intravenous injection of lidocaine [416] . In other sets of studies on a murine model of tibia bone fracture one day after experimental stroke induction, intraperitoneal injection of neutralizing anti-HMGB1antibodies was found to attenuate the bone fracture-mediated inflammatory effects on the cerebrum [417] . According to the authors' conclusion, these findings suggest that bone fracture shortly after stroke enhances stroke injury via augmented inflammation through HMGB1. These experimental observations could be confirmed by further studies on a bone fracture/TBI model in mice (already mentioned above), demonstrating that bone fracture can stimulate the inflammatory cytokines releases and exacerbate TBI symptoms [49] . Notably, HMGB1 was dramatically elevated by bone fracture, and the severity of TBI was reduced after blocking HMGB1. Given these data, the authors suggested that HMGB1-mediated inflammation may have a substantial impact on the secondary TBI.",

The chronic arthropathy, characterized by progressive destruction of articular cartilage, remodeling of the underlying bone, formation of ectopic bone, hypertrophy of the joint capsule, and inflammation of the synovial lining, is a common disease that can affect joints from any part of the body, in particular, the knee, hip, and shoulder, and represents a major cause of disability and joint pain worldwide.

In a subsequent review [436] , the scenario of DAMPactivated macrophages in OA was highlighted. Among others, the authors discussed that the damage caused to chondrocytes by activated macrophages would lead to the release of more DAMPs, creating a positive feedback loop that leads to the continued destruction of cartilage. More precise knowledge about OA-associated DAMPs was added by more recent studies. For example, in experiments on human monocytederived macrophages, it could be demonstrated that basic calcium phosphate crystals can polarize primary human macrophages toward an M1-like phenotype sustaining proinflammatory processes [437] .",

By contrast, in patients suffering from organ-specific injuries, for example, TBI, the determination of DAMPs and SAMPs will give individual information about the severity of the injury, their possible remote effects, and early signs of either controlled healing or uncontrolled disease-causing processes. Also, identification of such biomarkers could allow improved understanding of the pathological processes involved in organ-specific injury and may be helpful in diagnosis, prognostication, and development of novel therapies. In fact, the application of DAMPs and SAMPs as biomarkers is expected to improve the speed of clinical decision-making, in particular, in designing and executing patient-individualized treatment strategies.

A similar proposal for applying S100A8/S100A9 as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in intrinsic AKI was made elsewhere [240] . Also, in a clinical study on patients with AKI, mtDNA was measured in the urine, the severity of the disease was quantified, and patients were followed for 90 days [242] . As reported from the authors, the measured urinary mtDNA levels turned out to be a marker of AKI severity, as reflected by its significant correlation with the peak serum creatinine level, duration of hospital stay, and probably the need for temporary dialysis. Thus, like other DAMPs, urinary mtDNA has also the potential to serve as an essential biomarker of AKI. In similar clinical studies on surgical critically ill patients [442] , elevated urinary mtDNA levels could identify newly developed AKI and predict renal replacement therapy or hospital mortality in those patients. Finally, the use of urinary mtDNA as a biomarker of renal dysfunction could be confirmed in patients with AKI following cardiac surgery [443] . Postoperatively, the investigators found that urinary mtDNA was associated with increased risk of worsening AKI following initial sample collection and that this DAMP predicts AKI progression by receiver operator characteristic analysis.",

Importantly, the systemic HMGB1 release from the APAP-induced liver injury was observed to be biphasic. One may discuss that this observation nicely documents the initial injury-induced passive release of HMGB1 as a constitutively expresses IA-1 DAMP, followed by active secretion of acetylated, disulfide HMGB1 as an inducible IIIB-2 DAMP via DAMP-activated innate immune cells (see also Table 3 .1 and Vol. 1 [1] , Part IV, Sect. 11.2).

In studies on rats already mentioned above, administration of an anti-HMGB1 mAb after TBI was shown to remarkably inhibit fluid percussion-induced brain edema [56] . This effect was associated with inhibition of HMGB1 translocation, protection of BBB integrity, suppression of inflammatory molecule expression, and improvement of motor function. Also, in a murine TBI model, blockade of HMGB1 by an HMGB1 A-box fragment (an antagonist competing with full-length HMGB1 for receptor binding) was shown to reverse brain damages in the mice following TBI [445] . The experiments further revealed that the antagonist could significantly reduce brain edema by protecting the integrity of the BBB, ameliorate cell degeneration, and decrease expression of proinflammatory cytokines released in the injured brain after TBI. These cellular and molecular effects were accompanied by improved behavioral performance in TBI mice. The authors of these experiments suggested from their data [445] that HMGB1 A-box may have therapeutic potential for the secondary brain damages in TBI. In another study on a murine model of olfactory nerve transection, injection of an anti-HMGB1 antibody was shown to be associated with significantly smaller areas of injury-associated tissue, fewer astrocytes and macrophages/microglia, and an increase in regenerating nerve fibers [446] . Given these findings, the investigators proposed that inhibition of HMGB1 could provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of olfactory dysfunction following head injuries. Also, as documented by other lines of studies on a rat TBI model [447] , intravenous injection of an anti-HMGB1 mAb can attenuate accumulation of activated microglia in the rat cortex in the ipsilateral hemisphere after TBI. Moreover, these experiments showed that anti-HMGB1 mAb inhibits HMGB1 translocation, suppresses impairment of motor function, and has positive effects on electroencephalography activity. In their conclusion, the investigators argued that anti-HMGB1 mAb may prevent cognitive dysfunction after TBI. In the context of these reports, a study on glycyrrhizin, an inhibitor of HMGB1, is also of interest [448] . In these experiments, glycyrrhizin was used to investigate whether the inhibition of this DAMP could modulate microglia/macrophage polarization after TBI. The results obtained showed that treatment with this inhibitor ameliorates the neurological function recovery, reduces the lesion volume, and inhibits the release and expression of HMGB1 after TBI. Further, the investigators observed that the administration of this substance could suppress M1 phenotype activation and promoted M2 phenotype activation of microglia/macrophages. Given their interesting findings, the authors suggested that glycyrrhizin mitigates TBI by inhibiting M1 phenotype while promoting M2 phenotype activation of microglia/macrophages, at least partly through inhibiting HMGB1 [448] .",

The authors concluded that-if these results could be translated to humans-\"they suggest that HMGB1 inhibitors provide treatment regimens for oxidative inflammatory lung injury in patients receiving hyperoxia through mechanical ventilation.\" Similar observations were made in studies on a paraquat-induced ALI, in which blocking of HMGB1 signaling by glycyrrhizin was shown to dramatically inhibit the infiltration of neutrophils and attenuate lung injury [449] . In this context, studies on a rat model of crush injury are of interest showing that intravenous administration of anti-HMGB1 antibody was associated with amelioration of histological findings of lung damage [450] .",

In an experimental model of renal IRI [451] , glycyrrhizic acid was shown to reduce the hypoxiainduced death of tubular EpCs. The authors discussed that inhibition of the interaction of HMGB1 with tubular EpCs through this substance may represent a therapeutic strategy for the attenuation of renal injury following renal IRI. In other sets of studies on the model of folic acid-induced renal damage [452] , melatonin pretreatment was shown to improve cell cycle arrest of tubular EpCs. Notably, this protective function of melatonin was observed to be closely related to the inhibition of nucleocytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1 in tubular EpCs. Further, as already touched above, extended experiments of the Anders group on AKI models revealed that neutralizing anti-histone IgG can suppress intrarenal inflammation, neutrophil infiltration, and tubular cell necrosis and improve renal excretory function [245] .",

Therefore, time appears to be mature to develop, design, and test DAMP-specific antagonists in these acute diseases to explore whether or not blocking DAMPs will benefit patients. Further, there is initial evidence for the successful use of SAMPs, in particular, SPMs as therapeutics to be administered in acute organ injuries. Thus, it can be cautiously assumed that first clinical trials in this exciting field of new therapeutic options will be reported soon.",

However, as already discussed for polytrauma (Sect. 8.4.5), much more different, that is, more difficult to assess is their future routine use as therapeutic targets and therapeutics in solid organ injuries. Undoubtedly, treatment modalities based on inhibitors/antagonists, specifically targeting DAMPs, have provided encouraging results in several preclinical models of injury-induced inflammatory responses. However, before starting such trials, the possible risks of future therapeutic exploitation of DAMPs and SAMPs have to be clearly defined, as outlined in detail in Sect. 8.4.5. Nevertheless, as typical for current therapeutic achievements in medicine, clinical trials will give us the final answer to all these imponderabilities-in case they will be designed and conducted at all.",

In particular, the impact of DAMPs on promotion of organ-specific hyperinflammation, chronic nonresolving inflammation, and fibrosis, as well as the potential properties of SAMPs in resolving organ-specific inflammation are highlighted. To understand these complex scenarios, one may reduce the various cellular and molecular pathways involved to a fundamental sequence of injury-induced events. The \"pathogenetic matrix\" of such events-that could also be applied to other organ injuries not mentioned here-can be designed in the form of two axes (Fig. 9 .5): acute or chronic organ injury \u2192 RCD \u2192 emission of DAMPs and SAMPS \u2192 necroinflammation \u2192 resolution of inflammation (restitutio ad integrum), or nonresolving hyperinflammation (acute organ failure), or nonresolving chronic inflammation transitioning to progressive fibrosis (chronic organ failure).",

Consequently, the DAMPs activate mobile and sessile innate immune cells, including leukocytes, macrophages, and tubular EpCs and ECs to produce proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediator substances. These cytokines, partly in terms of inducible DAMPs such as TNF, promote further forms of RCD, which may contribute to intrarenal necroinflammation in terms of an autoamplification loop between cell necrosis and the inflammatory response[215,216]) (for additional information also compare Vol. 1[1], Part V, Chpt. 20, p. 467 andFig. 20.1, p. 469). Repeatedly acute or persistent insults to the renal parenchyma associated with chronic inflammation in terms of nonresolving inflammation can result in permanent fibrosis and renal dysfunction, which, if left untreated, may progress to CKD (see below). Of note, there is growing evidence suggesting that both acute renal necroinflammation and kidney fibrosis reflect the work of DAMPs (for further literature, see[211,[215][216][217][218][219][220][221][222][223]).",
