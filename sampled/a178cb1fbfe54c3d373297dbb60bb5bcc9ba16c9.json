            "text": "Remission consolidation with allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation improves survival of young patients with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), but the potential benefi t of transplantation in older patients is offset by regimen toxicity and nonrelapse mortality. Busulfan (BU) is not thought to be an effective drug for ALL, presumably because of intrinsic resistance of ALL to alkylating agents, or perhaps because of the large variability in BU pharmacokinetics and erratic drug exposure. Here we report results of treatment with a PK-targeted intravenous BU regimen in 35 adults with ALL. Patient age was 19-55 (median 38) years, 21 were treated in fi rst complete remission (CR1), 4 in CR1 following primary induction failure (PIF), 9 in CR2, and 1 in CR3. Treatment was with 4 consecutive daily doses of fl udarabine (FLU) 40 mg/m 2 , followed by i.v. BU, given on days 1 and 2 at 130-145 mg/m2 daily over 4 hours with PKsampling and mass spectrometry assay. On days 3 and 4 BU dose was adjusted to target an average area under the concentration curve of 5300+530 mMol*min/L for each of the four days. Donors were siblings (19), or unrelated (16). Grafts were T-replete, fi lgrastim-mobilized hematopoietic blood cells. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was tacrolimus plus methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. Mortality from all non-relapse causes was 6% at 100 days, and 9% at one year. Causes of death were GvHD in 2 patients and infection in 1. Eight patients had leukemia relapse between day 20 and 426 (median, day 82) post-transplant. Seven died of progressive disease and 1 was reinduced back in to CR. The one-year relapse-free survival (RFS) for all patients is 68%, with a median follow-up of 1.3 years for live patients. For the 21 patients transplanted in CR1, the one-year RFS is 86%, whereas it is 43% for the 14 patients transplanted in more advanced stage. The one-year RFS is 72% in patients up to 40 years, and 64% in patients 41-55 years old, with disease status and stage similarly distributed in younger and older cohorts. With this treatment protocol, the one-year non-relapse mortality is identical to what is observed with non-transplant therapies. When compared to irradiation-containing regimens, FLU and PK-targeted BU appear much safer and similarly effective, thereby providing a treatment option for all adult patients with ALL. A multicenter study comparing this transplant protocol against post-remission chemotherapy for adult ALL is warranted.",

Patients and Methods: We analyzed 61 adult de novo BCR-ABL1-positive ALL patients (pts) and 60 CML (chronic phase and myeloid/lymphoid blast crisis) pts. AID cDNA was amplifi ed with two pairs of oligonucleotides, the forward primer of each couple conjugated with a fl uorescent dye (fl uorescein) at its 5' end. PCR products were then loaded on the ABI Prism 3730 DNA Analyzer for automated capillary gel electrophoresis and the results were plotted with the AbiPrism GeneMapper v3.5 software (Applied Biosystems). Results: On the 61 de novo adult BCR-ABL1-positive ALL pts, AID mRNA and protein were detected in 36 (59%); their S88 expression correlated with BCR-ABL1 transcript levels and disappeared after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors at the time of remission. AID expression was also found in lymphoid blast crisis CML (50%), but not in myeloid lineage or in chronic phase CML. Different isoforms of AID were identifi ed: 13/61 (21%) pts expressed the full-length isoform; 19/61 (31%) co-expressed the wild-type and different AID splice variants with deaminase activity (AIDDeltaE4a, with a 30 bp deletion of exon 4; AIDDeltaE4, with the exon 4 deletion; AIDins3, with the retention of intron 3-4); 4/61 (7%) expressed the AIDDel-taE3-E4 isoform without deaminase activity (deletion of exons 2 and 3). To investigate whether AID introduces DNA-single strand breaks, we performed a genome wide analysis by 250K NspI single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array (Affymetrix Inc., USA). Patients who expressed wild-type AID had a higher number of alterations compared to AID-negative (median copy number alteration of 14 versus 4. respectively, p<0.03). Recurring copy number abnormalities were identifi ed in genes with an established role in leukemogenesis, such as IKZF1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, PAX5, MELK, BTG1 and MDS1. Conclusions: Our fi ndings show that BCR-ABL1-positive ALL cells aberrantly express different isoforms of AID that can act as mutator outside the Ig gene loci in promoting genetic instability in leukemia cells.

            "text": "Conditioning with reduced intensity protocols (RIC) prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has been proven successful in the treatment of hematologic malignancies in patients with higher age or comorbidities, formerly regarded as uneligible for treatment with SCT and standard conditioning. Nevertheless, control of advanced or active myeloid disease relies more on the dose intensity of the conditioning protocol than on the graft versus leukemia effect and is hampered in regimens with minimal intensity. Recently we described a conditioning protocol with reduced toxicity including fl udarabine, melphalan and BCNU (FBM group), with particular activity against advanced diseases with an acceptable rate of non relapse mortality (Blood, 2008, 112: 415) . Here we retrospectively compared FBM treated AML patients with patients treated with various TBI-, busulfan-or melphalan-containing RIC protocols registered within the EBMT (RIC group). The two groups differed signifi cantly not only in size (FBM group=130pt., RIC group=625pt.) but also in AML characteristics (sAML pt. in FBM=47%, in RIC=88%), status at SCT (active disease/upfront SCT: 83% v. 17%), median patient age (63y v. 56y), and use of unrelated donors (67% v. 31%). Nevertheless, the 2-year leukemia free survival (LFS) of AML patients in remission (CR1/ CR2) at SCT did not differ signifi cantly between the two groups (FBM=32%(\u00b110%) v. RIC=49%(\u00b13%), p= 0,14). Patients with active disease at SCT (FBM=107pt., RIC=109pt.) differed in the use of unrelated donors (FBM=71% v. RIC= 36%). 2-year LFS in patients with active AML transplanted from a HLA identical sibling was 30%(\u00b15%) in the FBM group and 17%(\u00b15%, p=0.12) in the RIC group. Results for 2-year LFS with unrelated donors were 38%(\u00b16%) and 35%(\u00b18%, p=0.41), respectively. Defi nitive conclusions between AML patients treated with FBM or other RIC protocols are diffi cult to make by this analysis due to the signifi cant heterogeneity of the two study groups. Anyway, despite the increased patient age in the FBM group treatment outcomes were comparable with a trend of better LFS in AML patients with active disease and related donors. These data once more emphasize the fact that RIC protocols show substantial differences in cytotoxicity and the choice of the appropriate conditioning regimen should not only be guided by patient factors like age or comorbidities but also by characteristics of the underlying malignant disease.",

Indication of allogeneic HSCT in patients with active disease at transplant is controversial. This retrospective study was aimed to analyze the results of HSCT in adult patients with ALL receiving HLA-identical or matched unrelated donor (MUD) myeloablative HSCT while being in fi rst relapse of their disease between 1990 and 2006. The primary and secondary endpoints of this study were the 3-year overall survival (OS) and the remission rate following HSCT. The EBMT registry received reports of 532 patients (332 HLA-identical sibling and 200 MUD transplants). Their median age was 29 years (16-65). There were 333 males and 199 females. The ALL immunological distribution at diagnosis was: B-lineage 253, T-lineage 114, other 42, missing 123. Sixty two patients were affected by Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL. The median number of white blood cells at diagnosis was 26x10 9 /L (0.4-746). The median intervals from diagnosis to fi rst complete remission (CR1), from CR1 to relapse, and from CR1 to HSCT were 45, 140, 193 days respectively. The median blasts in the bone marrow (BM) at transplant was 8,5% (0-93). Total body irradiation (TBI) was used as conditioning regimen in 400 out of 532 patients. Most patients (308, 58%) obtained a CR following HSCT. The 3-yr OS for all patients was 19+2%. In univariate analysis, 3 factors were signifi cantly associated with a better 3-yr OS: type of donor (HLA-identical sibling vs MUD, 21+3% vs 17+3%, p=0.03; no circulating blasts at transplant (28+6% vs 14+5%, p=0,01) and lower number of BM blasts (<8% vs >8%, 33+6% vs 12+4%, p=0,004). There was no signifi cant impact of other potential prognostic variables studied. In multivariate analysis, performed for 102 patients with enough information, there were 2 factors signifi cantly associated with a decreased 3-yr OS: higher number of blasts in the BM >8% (hazard ratio 0,49, 95% CI 0,31 to 0,76, p=0.002) and older patients >29yr (HR 0,6, 95% CI 0,38 to 0,94, p=0.03). Our study confi rms that HSCT is an effective salvage regimen for patients with ALL in fi rst relapse, mainly for young patients with lower tumor burden. Half of patients achieve the CR after HSCT and a small but signifi cant proportion of them can benefi t in terms of 3-yr overall survival either from related or unrelated donor. The number of blasts in BM has an important impact on OS.",

Despite curative potential, the higher risk of severe graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) accompanying URD-HSCT remains a major barrier to achieving overall success. Although T-cell depletion of URD grafts decreases the incidence and severity of GVHD its impact on graft versus leukaemia effects in ALL is not known. We report a retrospective multicentre analysis of 48 adults with high risk Ph negative ALL undergoing T-cell depleted (TCD) URD-HSCT in CR1 reported to the British Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry from 1993 to 2005. Median follow-up of survivors was 56.3 months (range 18-160). Median age was 26.2 years (range 15.9-50). Sixty seven percent of transplants were matched at 10 of 10 loci and 33% were mis-matched (27% at one allele only and 6% at two). TCD was carried out by in-vivo Campath administration in all recipients with additional ex-vivo TCD in 21% of patients. The estimated actuarial overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS) and non relapse mortality (NRM) were 61%, 54% and 13% at 5 years respectively. The overall incidence of Grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD was 26% and 8% respectively. The actuarial estimate of extensive chronic GVHD was 25% at 5 years. Adverse cytogenetics at diagnosis was the only factor associated with poorer 5 year DFS (41 vs 61%). T-cell depleted URD HSCT can result in good OS and low NRM for adults with high risk ALL in CR1 and merits prospective evaluation.",

The karyotype at diagnosis provides important prognostic information that infl uences therapy and outcome of this disease.

Aims: We sought to identify novel genomic regions of interest in normal karyotype AML and to identify novel candidate regions and disease-related genes in patients with complex karyotypes using genome-wide high resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-array. Patients and Methods: 40 AML patients were analyzed until now. Cases included FAB-M0, M1, M2, M4, M5, miscellaneous cytogenetic abnormalities and normal karyotype. 250 ng of genomic DNA were processed on 500K SNP array according to protocols provided by the manufacturer. Results: A wide spectrum of different genetic lesions (gains/ losses) involving complete chromosome arms (del 16q, i(13q10), del 3p, del 7p, monosomy 9) or submicroscopic genomic intervals were identifi ed in a substantial proportion of cases without differences in the frequency of losses or gains. Focal genetic alterations were detected at the breakpoints of previously cytogenetically identifi ed chromosomal translocations, such as t(2;3)(p22-23)(q26-27) and t(1;11)(p32;q23). The most frequent genomic gains affected: 9p12 (ZNF658B, FOXD4L2), 22q11.1 (PPYR1), 5q31-q33 (CDX1) and 8p23.2 (CSMD1). The most frequent deletions were identifi ed in ACTBL1 (22q11), NF1 (17q11.2) and often in regions lacking annotated genes. Other recurring genetic lesions were uncommon. Some lesions affected regions with a single gene, such as: ETAA1, FIGN, STK32B, PRAGMIN, PCM1, GLIS3, MRG-PRX1, SESN3, BCL2L14. Marked differences in the combination of copy number anomalies were identifi ed across the different genetic subtypes of AML. Patients with normal karyotype showed no relevant genetic alterations. Conclusion: These data demonstrated that, in contrast to adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), AML is characterized by S87 relatively few recurring copy number alterations, and that spectrum of genetic anomalies is signifi cantly associated with AML disease subtype.

Graef, U. Germing, R. Haas Heinrich Heine University (D\u00fcsseldorf, DE) Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a curative therapy for many patients with leukemia. However, patients with high-risk disease as defi ned by adverse genetic features, early relapse or chemorefractory disease have a poor prognosis with conventional transplant protocols. Sequential conditioning regimens like the Munich FLAMSA approach have shown promising results in these patients. We here report a single center experience with a FLAMSA based conditioning regimen in myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. One hundret patients with high-risk AML, MDS or blast transformation of a myeloproliferative disorder and sixteen patients with high-risk ALL were treated within a sequential conditioning protocol at the Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf. Patients fi rst received a Fludarabine, HD-Ara C, Amsacrine (FLAMSA) based induction therapy and directly proceeded to conditioning with Melphalan and Thiotepa (Mel/Thio, n=36), Melphalan (Mel/mono n=64) or TBI (12Gy, n=16, all ALL) during FLAMSA induced cytopenia. Transplantation of PBPCs from matched related (n= 39) or unrelated (n= 77) donors was accompanied by a GvHD prophylaxis with Tacrolimus and Mycophenolatemofetil. Patients who had unrelated or mismatched donors received ATG. As a consequence of the fi rst interim analysis after 50 patients Thiotepa was omitted from the conditioning protocol because of an unacceptable high late treatment related mortality in patients receiving Mel/Thio (p<0.05 vs Melphalan monotherapy). In a second analysis after a median follow up of 647 days (range 44-2159) the projected 2 year survival among 100 patients with myeloid disease (median age 51 years, range 17-67) was 41% (47% with Mel/mono and 34% with Mel/Thio, p=ns). Relapse rate was 25% with Mel/Thio and 42% with Mel/mono (p=ns). Among the 16 patients with high-risk ALL (median age 26 years, range 18-54) 4 died due to relapse and 2 of treatment related complications. After a median follow up of 1004 days (range 194-1489) 10 patients are alive and free of disease including 3 patients who had refractory ALL before transplantation. We conclude that a sequential conditioning approach using FLAMSA followed by either HD-Melphalan or full dose 12 Gy TBI is safe and effective in patients with poor risk leukemia. Further studies will have to focus on early identifi cation of patients who are at highest risk for relapse to initiate effective post transplant therapies.",

Pat. were transplanted in Essen and Rostock. For the defi nition of a CMV-R treatment with ganciclovir and the detection of pp65 pos.cells in PMCs at minimum at two different occasions were required. For in vitro studies we used the cell lines Kasumi-1 (AML-M2), SD-1 (ALL) and K562 (CML in blast crises) and infected them with the AD169 CMV strain. 14 days after infection we evaluated the apoptosis rate by measuring annexin V by FACS, the proliferation rate by BRDU assay, the expression of MRD and apoptosis marker p21, c-myc. Infection of CMV in Kasumi-1 cells and SD-1 cells induced in 99.8% and 31.3% of cells apoptosis, whereas no impact on the apoptosis rate was seen for K562 cells. HCMV-induced cell death in AML cells was mediated by a caspase-dependent mechanism and could be prevented by the specifi c caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk. These results were in concordance with the clinical observation of a CMV-R after transplant in AML, ALL, and CML. AML-Patients with a documented CMV-R had in both cohorts a markedly reduced risk for relapse (prob. at 5-year 9.2% versus 52.6% in cohort 1 (p<0.0005) and 12.2% versus 47.2% in cohort 2 (p<0.013), which resulted in a sign.improved OS cohort 1 OS 73.6% versus 42.5% (p<0.04) and 48.0% versus 33.5% in cohort 2 (p<0.04). There were no sign. differences in the characteristics of pat. with or without CMV-R. Patients with CMV-R had a higher incidence of acute GVHD grade 2 -4 (82% versus 38%, p <0.0001), but this was also seen in pat.with ALL and CML who did not have a reduced risk for relapse after a CMV-R. When stratifi ed according to the occurrence of acute GVHD, the probability for risk of relapse remained sign.lower in pat.with a CMV-R compared to their counterparts (p<0.003). In multivariate analyses the sign.factors impacting the outcome and relapse rate were disease stage, chronic GVHD, unfavorable cytogenetics and CMV-R. Our data indicate an unrecognized role of CMV reactivation after HSCT for AML, which is probably mediated by CMV induced apoptosis.",

Patients were considered high-risk on the basis of primary induction failure (>5% blasts after at least 2 courses of intensive multi-agent chemotherapy; n=7); adverse cytogenetics (-5, -7, del(5q) , abn 3q, >4 abnormalities; n=18); >CR1 (n=28), secondary AML (myelodysplastic syndrome, n=3; therapy-related, n=5). At transplant, 11 had refractory disease and 1 untreated relapse. Median follow-up was 30 months (3-84), donors were HLA-mismatched at up to 3 loci (HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 or DQB1) in 20/51 (39%), 15 patients were female (29%), and median age was 36 years (13-57). Conditioning was with fl udarabine 30mg/sq.m days -9 to -7, cyclophosphamide 60mg/kg on day -6 and -5, 14.4 Gy TBI in 8 fractions over 4 days, day -3 to 0, and progenitor cells were mobilised from peripheral blood in 44/51 (86%). Cyclosporin was given at 3mg/kg from day -1 and 20 mg alemtuzumab was added to the progenitor cell bag 30 minutes prior to infusion on day 0. All patients engrafted. Acute GVHD grade II-IV occurred in 7/51 (14%; grade II in 6, grade IV in 1), extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 10/44 assessable (23%; cutaneous only in 6) and cutaneous limited chronic GVHD in 10/44 (23%).

Champlin UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, US) Introduction: To augment the antileukemic activity of the reduced toxicity pretransplant regimen IV busulfan (Bu)-fl udarabine (Flu) we combined or replaced Flu with Clofarabine (Clo). Because the immunosuppressive/engraftment-promoting capacity of Clo is unknown, we used Bayesian adaptive randomization to protect patient safety while evaluating Clo\u00b1Flu with IV Bu. Patients and methods: Randomization: Arm I: Clo:Flu 10:30 mg/m\u00b2, Arm II 20:20 mg/m\u00b2, Arm III 30:10 mg/m\u00b2, Arm IV only Clo 40 mg/m\u00b2. The Clo and Flu were infused over 1 hr each, Bu was given over 3 hr targeting a daily AUC of 6,000 mcMol-min each given once daily for 4 days. The adaptive randomization was based on a 2:1 weighted average of the posterior probabilities of 30-day transplant-related mortality and response (alive at day 30 w/o active disease, with >90% donor cells). 28 patients are enrolled, evaluable for engraftment and survival beyond day +30. M/F: 17/11, med. age 45 yr (range: 6-59). 7 had CML (BC: 1, AP2: 2, AP1: 3, late CP1: 1). 21 had AML (induct. failure: 7, refr. Relapse: 5, untx Rel-1: 1, untx Rel-2: 3, CR2: 2, high-risk CR1: 2, tx-refr MDS: 1). No AML/MDS patients had favorable cytogenetics (CG), 11 had intermediate, and 10 poor prognosis CG. GVHD-prophylaxis was tacrolimus and mini-MTX, and with one Ag mism. or unrel. graft rabbit-ATG (Thymoglobulin\u2122) (TD 4 mg/kg) was used. Results: All patients engrafted (3 progressed early). DNA chimerism; Groups I+II (lower dose Clo, n=10) had a median of 96% (range 17-100) donor (T-cell)-derived DNA, groups III+IV (higher dose Clo, n=17) a median of 100% (range 64-100) donor-DNA by day +30. By day +100 both cohorts had a median of 100% donor-derived DNA, stable beyond 6 months in evaluable patients. On December 15, 2008, 15 patients are alive in CR (median F/u 11 mos, range 1-24). 11 pats died, none was regimen-related; Progr Dx: 6, GVHD \u00b1 infection: 3 (2 before Day+100), infection alone: 1, CHF: 1, and 2 are alive with AML. Main toxicity was mucositis grade 2-3 in half the patients. One patient had moderate liver toxicity, but there was no VOD or signifi cant neurologic toxicity. Conclusions: 1) Clo-IV-Bu-based conditioning is safe in Chemo-refractory, high-risk patients, 2) Clo is adequately immunosuppressive to support allo SCT, 3) additional studies are warranted to fully evaluate the antileukemic activity of Clo\u00b1Flu with -IV Bu \u00b1-rabbit-ATG as pretransplant conditioning therapy in myeloid leukemia / MDS.

Arpinati, M. Stanzani, S. Usai, A. Bontadini, A. Curti, S. Paolini, S. Rizzi, M.R. Motta, V. Giudice, M. Baccarani S. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital (Bologna, IT) The role of allogeneic transplantation in 1 st CR of adult AML, whether from HLA identical siblings or volounteer unrelated donors, is subject to debate. We present here ours results on sixty one patients-37 HLA-identical siblings and 24 unrelatedtransplanted between 1998 and 2008. Their main demographic chararcteristic were: median age 42 yrs (HLA identilcal sibling) vs 39 yrs (VUD). 14 unrelated transplants were fully matched (10/10 at high resolution), with the remaining patients being 9/10 or 8/10. The source of stem cells was predominantly PBSC in the sibling group (83%) while it was bone marrow in the VUD group (84%). The preparative regimens were myeloablative in nearly 90% of the cases: they were based on Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide in 76% of the sibling group vs 50% in the unrelated group, while TBI/ Cyclophosphamide was used only in 5% of the sibling and 35% of the VUD groups. Low dose ATG (Fresenius, Bad Homburg) was used in all the VUD and 21% of the sibling transplants, from days -6 to day -2, at a total dose of 15-30 mg/kg. Prophylaxis of GVHD consisted of CsA and short term, four doses MTX. Supportive measures consisted of protective isolation, HEPA air fi ltration, fl uconazole, acyclovir and cotrimoxazole/trimethoprim prophylaxis, weekly CMV monitoring with preemptive intervention. All patients, except one, engrafted. The incidence of aGVHD, grade III-IV was 8% in both groups; the incidence of overall cGVHD was 43% and 29% in the sibling vs unrelated transplants, respectively and of extensive cGVHD 27% vs 12.5%. The 5 year actuarial probability of TRM was 23% in the siblings and 17% in the unrelated transplants. The 4 yr actuarial relapse risk was 25% in the sibling group and 6% in the VUD group. With a median follow-up of 56 months, OS is 61% for the siblings vs 77% of the VUDs. Within the VUD group, the patients matched at 10/10 fared better in term of TRM, relapse and OS compared to those who were matched at a lesser degree (8 or 9/ 10); the overall survival of the 10/10 is 92% at 6 years. These results show a better outcome of the VUD vs siblings, following a myeloablative regimen, because of slightly less TRM and much less relapse in the VUD population, despite ATG-F pre-transplant; thus allogenic transplantation remains a strong indication as post remission therapy in adult AML.",

Bartolozzi, F. Mannelli, G. Gianfaldoni, S. Bencini, A. Bosi AOU Careggi (Florence, IT) Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcome of patients affected by non-promyelocytic Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who relapsed after an allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCT). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of this group of patients and the therapeutic strategies offered at relapse. Results: Since january 1989 to december 2006, 157 AML patients receveid an HSCT of whom 53 (34%) relapsed. Median age of the relapsed patients was 38 (range 15-60). 30 (60%) patients were in complete remission (CR) at fi rst HSCT (20 in CR1 and 10 in CR2) and 23 (40%) in advanced disease. Median time between HSCT and relapse was 6 months . 45 (85%) and 8 (15%) patients received HSCT from sibling and matched unrelated donor (MUD), respectively. At relapse, 15 patients receveid only palliative therapy; a reinduction therapy was offered to 38 patients, of whom 24 receveid fl udarabine and cytarabine-containing regimen (FLA) while 14 receveid FLA plus idarubicin (Ida-FLA). 5 (21%) of 24 patients treated with FLA and 7 (50%) of 14 treated with Ida-FLA achieved CR. 7 (29%) and 2 (14%) were early deaths in FLA and Ida-FLA groups respectively. Overall, 18 patients performed a second HSCT of whom 9 (6 CR) after Ida-FLA and 9 (4 CR) after FLA. Comparing the two different reinduction strategies, the Ida-FLA group showed longer interval between HSCT and relapse (11 versus 6 months, p=0.08) and larger proportion of CR patients at fi rst HSCT (86% versus 56%, p=0.06) in spite of a greater median age (41 versus 37, p=0.09). All 10 patients who were transplanted with advanced disease died with a median survival of 3 months. Of the 8 patients in CR at second HSCT, 4 are alive and disease-free with a median follow-up of 30 months. At any rate, all these 4 patients were in CR1 at fi rst HSCT. Conclusions: Although retrospectively analyzed and not statistically signifi cant, the differences between the two reinduction groups are due to the fact that a more aggressive therapy was adopted in patients that, whilst older, had greater probability to reach CR and to perform a second HSCT. Our results confi rm that a second HSCT, although the most effective treatment in this prognostically dismal cathegory of patients, offers a real chance of cure only to patients who performed fi rst HSCT in CR1 and who achieved CR with reinduction therapy.",

Kaczmarek, M. Potter, M. Ethell, J. Treleaven, F. Davies, C. Dearden, G. Morgan, B. Shaw The Royal Marsden Hospital (Sutton, UK) Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) remains the only curative option for many patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We reviewed the results of SCT in a single institution treating both children and adults, over a 16-year period (1991-2007) . The study included 196 patients. The median age was 16 years (range: 2-60). The donor was a sibling in 99, unrelated (UD) in 93, mismatched relative in 4. SCT was performed in CR1 (71), CR2 (83), >CR2 (24) or with persistent disease (16). 16% of patients were Philadelphia positive, 22% had T-cell ALL, 8% had a prior autograft. The majority of patients received TBI. 78% of the patients with an UD had in-vivo T-cell depletion. The overall survival in the whole group was 48% and 42% at 5 and 10 years respectively. The relapse risk (RR) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 22% and 29% at 3 years. Acute GvHD was seen in 64% of patients (grade II-IV in 29%). There was an improvement in outcome dependent on the time period over which the SCT was performed. The 3-year survival was 33%, 51% and 57% in those transplanted from 1991-1995, 1996-2003 and 2004-2007 (p=0.03) . This appeared to be due to a decrease in the NRM in more recent years (40%, 32% and 18%, p=0.04). There was no signifi cant difference in OS, NRM or RR based on the use of a sibling or UD. SCT beyond CR2 was associated with a worse outcome in adults (p=0.01) but not in children. Survival was worse in patients who had previous autograft (p=0.0001). Although only a small number of patients (10) received reduced intensity conditioning SCT, the OS was not different to those receiving myeloablative conditioning (2 years: 45% vs 53%, p=0.4). We did observe a signifi cant difference in OS in adult (>16) compared to paediatric patients (16 and younger), (32% vs 62% at 5 years, p=0.0004), but no difference in disease relapse (28% in adults vs 24% in children at 3 years). In adult patients only one factor impacted on OS in multivariate analysis: a SCT undertaken in 2004-2007 compared to earlier years (p=0.009). In paediatric patients two factors impacted on OS: SCT P446 HD-Mel phase II study in fi rst relapse of AML: high rate of extramedullary manifestation in subsequent relapses after sequential auto-/allograft H.

To improve survival we introduced salvage therapy with highdose melphalan and autologous PBSC followed by a sequential allotransplant (Bug et al. Ann Hematol 2005; 84:748-54.) Here we present a long-term follow-up of this patient cohort. Objectives: (1) To improve second CR rate in relapsed AML; 2) to increase the proportion of AML fi rst relapse patients achieving an allogeneic transplant;",

Methods: AML patients in fi rst relapse received salvage therapy with 200 mg/m\u00b2 melphalan and autologous PBSC, which had been cryopreserved in early CR1. Subsequently an allogeneic donor was searched and a consolidating allogeneic transplant scheduled within 2 -3 months. Results: Twentytwo pts. with AML in fi rst relapse and a median age of 46 (range 29-64) years are evaluable. Eighteen of 22 pts. (82%) achieved a second CR and 20/22 pts. (91%) proceeded to a consolidating allogeneic transplant in CR2 (n=14) or PR2 (n=4) from a related (n=3) or unrelated (n=17) donor within a median of 2,4 (1,9 -4,5) months after HD-Mel. Treatment-related mortality was 0/22 after HD-Mel and 5/20 (25%) after subsequent allograft; 7 pts. died due to relapse and 10 patients are alive (8 in CR) with a median follow-up of 40 (range 25 -90) months. The projected survival at 2 and 5 years is 50% and 42%, respectively. Relapse after allograft: Of 20 allografted patients, 8 relapsed after a median of 11 (range 2 -33) months in the marrow (n=4) after a median of 5,6 (2 -33) months or extramedullary (EM) (spine, heart, gut) after a median of 15,5 (6 -20) months (n=4). Leukemia markers in patients with extramedullary relapse were inv16 (n=2), FLT3-ITD (n=1) and FLT3-TKD (n=1) . Conclusions: 1. In patients with fi rst relapse of AML, HD-Mel is superior to any other reported regimen in achieving a second CR and allowing a sequential allograft. 2. Half of the relapses after sequential auto-allograft were extramedullary, refl ecting control of leukemia by GvL in the marrow and escape at sanctuaries. 3. The association of extramedullary relapse with markers as inv16 and FLT3-mutations needs to be studied in more patients.",

Blin, B. Mahe, J.L. Harousseau, M. Mohty, P. Moreau, J. Delaunay Service d'Hematologie H\u00f4pital Hotel Dieu (Nantes, FR) Introduction: Incidence of leukemic transformation in BCR-ABL negative myeloproliferative disorders reaches 10 to 15% after a median of 15 years of follow up. The prognosis remains very poor and available therapeutic options depending on patient and disease characteristics are limited. Only few series have investigated the outcome of this population. Patients and methods: From January 1992 to July 2008, 62 patients (36M/26F) were diagnosed with blastic transformation secondary to a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD). Median age was 66 (range 44-85)years. Eleven (18%) patients had primary myelofi brosis, 25 (40%) had PV, 18 (29%) had ET and 8 (13%) had unclassifi able MPD. Patients had received a median of 2 (range 0-4) prior therapies. Prior exposure to alkylating agent and radioactive phosphorus was present in 35 (56%) and 4 (6,4%) patients respectively. Cytogenetics analysis performed in 24 patients was as follow, unfavourable Karyotype:12 patients and intermediate: 12 patients. Seven patients out of 12 tested for JAK2V617K mutation were found positive. Results: Twelve (19,3%) patients received induction chemotherapy, 8 (13%) low intensity chemotherapy (low dose aracytine, n=3 and azacytidine, n=5) and 35 (56,4%) only supportive care. Ten (16%) patients received an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) either as fi rst line therapy (7 cases)or as consolidation after induction chemotherapy (3 cases). Forty one percent (5/12)of patients who received induction chemotherapy achieved complete remission, 3 of them were transplanted and 2 relapsed at 2 and 3,5 months following CR. Median overall survival (OS) for the all cohort was 7,9 months. Interestingly, for patients who received allo-SCT in the course of the disease (n=10), median OS was 18 months compared to 4,7 months for patients who not received transplants (n=52), p=0,03.",

Adequate prognostic criteria are required for selecting patients (pts) who can benefi t from this procedure. Aim of this study was to assess prognostic factors affecting OS in a cohort of 50 AML pts who received alloHSCT as salvage treatment after a risk-oriented frontline chemotherapy (NILG AML01-00). Fifty out of 140 pts in fi rst relapse received allograft as salvage therapy. Median age was 50 yr (14 pts were >55). At diagnosis 31(62%) pts had high risk AML, defi ned by clinical and cytogenetic characteristics according to the NILG protocol. Median time from 1st CR to relapse (TTR) was 10 months (mo) and from relapse to allo was 3 mo. At alloSCT 34 pts (85%) were in 2nd CR, and 16 were transplanted with disease. The donor was matched related for 19 pts, matched unrelated for 22 and haploidentical for 9. Stem cell source was PB in 31, BM in 12 and CB in 7 pts. The conditioning regimen was myeloablative (MA) in 38 (74%) and reduced intensity (RIC) in 12. The impact of risk factors on OS was analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. The clinical outcome of the 50 transplanted pts was compared with 90 consecutive pts receiving other intensive salvage treatment. After alloSCT 44/50 (88%) achieved a 2nd CR. Relapse occurred in 22 pts at a median time of 8 mo from alloSCT, and all died. Among the 16 pts transplanted with disease 3 are in CCR. Acute (grade>II) or chronic GVHD occurred in 23 pts (46%). The 100dy-and 1-yr TRM was 6% and 20%. Among transplant related deaths, 75% were attributable to MA regimens. After a median follow up of 10 mo (range 3-68), median OS was 13 mo. The projected 1 yr-and 3-ys OS was 60 and 33%. Thirteen (28%) were in CCR at the end of follow-up. The 90 non transplanted pts showed a median OS of 3 mo, with a 1-yr OS of 16% (p=0.000). Univariate analysis performed on the 50 transplanted pts showed that high risk AML, TTR<6mo, ECOG-PS>0 and disease status at transplant were predictive of a poor outcome (p<0.05). By Cox multivariate analysis TTR<6mo and PS>0 were independent adverse prognostic factors for OS (p=0.04 and 0.01). Our data confi rm that allograft can offer a better clinical outcome than other intensive regimen. Allograft should be proposed preferentially to pts with a TTR\u22656 mo and a very good PS.RIC seems to be as effective and less toxic than MA conditioning regimen, but larger prospective studies are required for confi rming the role of RIC in AML salvage strategies.

Bosi (9) (1)University of Bologna (Bologna, IT) ; (2) Between 1997 and 2008, 129 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients in fi rst complete remission (CR) received busulfan and melphalan (Bu/Mel) as conditioning regimen prior autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in ten different Italian transplant centers. Melphalan was administered at 140 mg/m\u00b2 and combined with busulfan at 16 mg/Kg orally or 12.8 mg/Kg intravenously for patients under 60 years (=97, 75.2%). Patients older than 60 years (=32, 24.8%) received melphalan at 120 mg/m\u00b2 and busulfan at 12 mg/Kg orally or 9.6 mg/Kg intravenously. Eighty two patients (63.6%) received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and 47 patients (36.4%) received bone marrow (BM) cells. Median age of study patients was 50 years (range 16-72). Cytogenetic categories distribution was conventionally defi ned as favorable (15.5%); intermediate (60.1%) and unfavorable (24.3%). Patients were classifi ed at high risk (49% of evaluable patients) when the white blood cell count at diagnosis was higher that 30\u00d710 9 /L and/or cytogenetics was unfavorable and/or when AML was secondary to a myelodysplastic syndrome, otherwise were considered at standard risk (51%). Forty-four patients (36%) received only one post-remission chemotherapy course whereas 78 patients (64%) received two or more chemotherapy cycles after remission before transplantation. With a median follow-up of 31 months, the 8-years projected overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was 62% and 56%, respectively. The relapse rate was 45% and the non-relapse mortality (TRM) was 4.65%. Patients who underwent two or more post-remission chemotherapy cycles showed a signifi cantly better OS and DFS than patients treated with only 1 cycle (OS 74.3% vs 61.3% p=0.05; DFS 68% vs 54.5% p=0.05). As expected, there was a signifi cant better OS and DFS in younger patients (< 60 years) than in elderly patients (OS 73.2% vs 59.3% p< 0.02; DFS 67.3% vs 51.6% p<0.003). The stem cell source did not signifi cantly affect OS and DFS although PBSC transplantation led to a faster hematological recovery than BM transplantation. Of note, OS and DFS were not different between high risk and standard risk patients and this fi nding was also confi rmed when the data were analyzed according to cytogenetic categories alone. Our data suggest that Bu/Mel is an effective conditioning regimen for high risk AML patients in fi rst CR undergoing ASCT being associated with a low toxicity profi le (mainly mucositis) and TRM.",

From 1996 to 2007, only 63 out of 364 pts (27 M, 36 F, median age of 41 years) had retrospectively available conserved cells at diagnosis. The expression levels of WT1, Evi1, Flt3 and Hoxa9 were performed by quantitative RT-RQPCR. The mutational status of MLL duplication, FLT3 (internal tandem duplication or nucleotide substitutions) (ITD), NPM1 and CEBP\u00e1 were determined by PCR, RFLP and/or sequencing analysis. Four (6%) pts had Flt3over-expressed (ov-ex), 19(30%) FLT3 ITD+, 3(5%) MLLdup, 10(16%) Hoxa9 ov-ex, 7(11%) Evi1ov-ex, 15(24%) NPM1mut+, 25 (40%) WT1 ov-ex and 1 CEBPAmut+ (this marker was evaluated only in12 pts). Twenty three (36%) pts had no abnormal molecular markers and 10 (16%) 1 marker, 10(16%) 2 markers, 12(19%) 3 markers, 4(6%) 4 markers and 4(6%) 5 markers. Among the 23 negative molecular pts, 9(41%) presented a normal, 12(50%) a poor and 2(9%) a favourable karyotype,; and among the 40 positive pts, 16(40%) were normal, 8(20%) poor, 13(32.5%) intermediate and 3(7.5%) favourable. Concerning transplantation, the median interval between diagnosis and transplantation was 6 months (2.6-68.5 ). Before conditioning, 41 pts were in CR, 8 in PR and 14 in relapse. Twenty fi ve (40%) pts received a non-myelo-ablative conditioning and 38(60%) a myelo-ablative one. Twenty three (36.5%) pts received PBSC, 37 (59%) bone marrow and 4 (6.5%) cord blood cells from 47 (75%) HLA siblings and 16 (25%) unrelated donors. After transplantation, 59 (94%) pts engrafted, 42 developed AGVHD and 13 developed cGVHD. At the last follow-up, 20 pts have relapsed, 29 pts are alive and 34 died. At the median follow-up of 48 months, the OS and DFS for the whole population were 40% (33-47) and 40% (34-46) respectively with a maximum follow-up of 130 months. The univariate analysis showed a signifi cant impact of FLT3 ITD and over-expression of FLT3RQ on long-term DFS, [25%vs47% p=0.03 and 50%vs34% p=0.02] and a trend on long-term OS 27%vs46% p=0.08]. Regarding the karyotype (83% Fav, 50% Int and 24% Poor) and some other markers (Wt1:37%vs43%, EVI1:28%vs43%, NPM1:32%vs43% and Hoxa9:50%vs38%), we did not observe signifi cant difference because of small number of pts in subgroups. The known benefi c impact of NPM1mut+, was erased because the majority of this group presented an associated FLT3 ITD+.",

Steckel, R. Trenschel, L. Kordelas, T. Gromke, H. Ottinger, M. Koldehoff, A.H. Elmaagacli, C. Schulte, D. Beelen Clinic of Bone Marrow Transplantation (Essen, DE) Patients (pts) with truly refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have a particular poor prognosis after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (aSCT). In this prospective analysis, high-dose melphalan for induction of marrow aplasia followed by a myeloablative conditioning regimen before aSCT was evaluated in 50 consecutive pts (median age 55, range 19-70 years) after failure of primary double induction (n=8) or salvage chemotherapy for AML-relapse (n=42). The projected pretransplant assessment of mortality score (PAM-Score, Parimon T et al.) of this cohort revealed a median overall probability of death within 2 years of 67% (range 49-85%). 40 pts received 140mg/m\u00b2 and 10 pts 200mg/m\u00b2 melphalan followed by a total body irradiation (TBI) based conditioning regimen in 20 pts (40%) or a chemotherapybased regimen in 30 pts (60%) within 10 days after melphalan application. 18 pts received grafts from sibling (ISD) (36%) and 32 pts from matched unrelated donors (MUD) (64%). Complete remission of AML was obtained in all but one patient (98%). The transplant-related mortality (TRM) estimate at 2 yrs after aSCT was 34%. The 2-year probability of death was 64% and the 2-year event-free survival estimate was 35% with the last event occurring at 1.5 yrs. Explorative data analysis identifi ed a MUD transplant, a melphalan-dose of 140mg/m\u00b2, and chemotherapeutic conditioning using treosulfan 42g/m\u00b2 combining with fl udarabine 150mg/m\u00b2 as favourable outcome predictors. This resulted from a signifi cantly lower 2-year relapse estimate after MUD compared to ISD (21% vs. 81%, p<0.02) and a lower 2-year TRM after 140mg/m\u00b2 melphalan combined with treosulfan + fl udarabine compared to other combinations (17% vs. 54%, p<0.03). The 2-year event-free survival estimate for the 18 pts with all favourable treatment was 68% opposed to 19% in the 32 pts not fulfi lling all these characteristics (p<0.006). In conclusion, the concept of aplasiogenic high-dose melphalan together with myeloablative conditioning can rescue more than 1/3 of otherwise refractory AML pts. The benefi cial infl uence of MUD in this study further supports a stronger antileukemic potential compared to ISD in pts with refractory AML, which translates into a comparatively high event-free survival in combination with 140mg/m\u00b2 melphalan followed by a conditioning regimen with treosulfan + fl udarabine. This sequential protocol deserves further evaluation against other sequential conditioning approaches in refractory AML pts.",

However, it is not known to what extent the clinical advantage of BUS-FLUDA is dependent by the i.v. route of BUS administration, that allows a more predictable plasma peak of the drug, or by the substitution of FLUDA for CTX. We have conducted a retrospective analysis of patients treated with oral BUS(16) + FLUDA or with oral BU(16)-CY. Methods: Fifty-one patients (ALL, AML, CML) transplanted from matched sibling or UD donor were studied. Twenty-six patients received before allogeneic HSC transplantation BUSULPHAN 16 mg/Kg p.o. and FLUDARABINE 150 mg/m\u00b2 (BUS-FLUDA) and results were compared to those obtained in a group of 25 patients that received BU-CY2 or BU-CY3. Majority of patients in both groups were affected with AML. No differences between these two groups were found in percentage of UD donors (p=0.6), nor in HSC source (BM versus PBSC, p=0.9), nor in age (p=0.6). Pts were defi ned as \"early disease\" in 29% (B-F group) and 30% (BU-CY), p=0.9. Mean CD34+ cell dose infused was comparable (p=0.29). GVHD prophylaxis was standard dose CSA + MTX short course. All patients had primary engraftment and mean time to reach N. count > 0.5 x 109/l was not different in the two groups. Results: In oral BUS-FLUDA group max score of oral mucositis (DMS score) was lower during days 7-14 post transplantation (p=0.008), BUS-FLUDA group had also a CHE serum level higher than BU-CY group during week 1, 2 and 3 posttransplant (p=0.002). Moreover pts of B-F group had a lower PLT transfusion requirement (p=0.004). Haemorrhagic cystitis was recorded in 20% of patients receiving BU-CY while in only 3.8% of pts treated with B-F (p=0.06), no cases of VOD were registered in either groups. OS at 3 years was 80% in BUS+FLUDA versus 59% in BU-CY group (p=0.2) and DFS was 70% in BUS+FLUDA versus 51% in BU-CY group (p=0.3). No difference in OS between BUS+FLUDA versus BUS+CTX was observed also in the stratum of AML patients who had an OS of 70% versus 62% (p=0.9). Conclusion: Oral BUS plus FLUDA showed in comparison to BUS plus CTX the same anti-neoplastic activity with a significantly lower toxicity in terms of mucositis, PLT requirement and rate of hemorrhagic cystitis.",

The median age was 45 and 48 years, respectively. According to kariotype, WBC count and FLT3 status, seventy and sixty-four percent of cases, respectively, were considered at high risk. Consolidation therapy consisted of 2 cycles of HD-AraC and Ida. Results: The complete remission rate was 75% and 59% for FLAIE and MyAIE (p=n.s.) . Death during treatment rates were 5% and 0. After 1 consolidation course the overall CR rate was 80% and 73%. After a similar median follow up, 27 months and 21 months (5-42) respectively, 41% of patients are alive in CR in the FLAIE group (12 SCT and 3 ASCT) and 64% in the MyAIE group (7 SCT and 4 ASCT) (p=n.s.; Chi-square, Fisher's exact test). Toxicity was comparable in the two regimens. The median time to ANC recovery (>1.0 x 10 9 /L) was 31 and 23 days for FLAIE and MyAIE; the median time to PLT recovery (>100 x 10 9 /L) was 28 and 24 days, respectively. The median time of neutropenic fever episodes for patients was 1 and 1.4 in the 2 groups, respectively. Conclusions: Four-drugs intensifi ed induction therapy including Mylotarg is a feasible approach in young AML patients candidate to allo-BMT. The limited number of patients involved in this study, the low administration dosage of idarubicin, and the relevant role of fl udarabine in induction therapy, can reasonably justify the lower CR rate obtained in patients treated in the MyAIE schedule, if compared with FLAIE regimen and, above all, with standard chemotherapy. Fludarabine and Mylotarg, in combination with conventional chemotherapy, represent a promising induction regimen in young AML patients.",

We recently reported long term disease free survival of 50% in adults with ALL treated in our institution. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) following myeloablative conditioning is a treatment option available for patients under the age of 60-65 years, that may improve treatment results in adults. We present the results from the Norwegian stem cell transplant program 1985 , partly presented in Tidsskr Nor Legeforen. Patient material: In the 20-year period 1985 patients(m=38, f=23) underwent ASCT for ALL in our institution.19 were transplanted in fi rst remission, the other 42 in later stages of disease. Myeloablative treatment consisted of busulfan and cyclophosphamide(BuCy) in all but two patients, who received Cy and TBI 12Gy. Results: A matched family donor was used in 38 patients (62%). Ten of these patients had a haploidentical donor with 0-1 antigen mismatch. The remaining patients were transplanted with cells from 10/10 or 9/10 MUD. 46 patients received bone marrow derived stem cells, whereas 15 were transplanted with mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. Acute graft vs host disease (GvHD) developed in 26 patient (43%), grade II-IV in 22. Chronic GvHD developed in 21 patients (34%) with six patients experiencing extensive chronic GvHD. In December 2006, 26 patients were alive, 21 without evidence of disease. 10 patients, all transplanted with MUD, developed invasive fungal disease. Median survival was 1,5 years. Transplant related mortality due to GvHD, infection, veno-occlusive disease or non-engraftment was 25%. The most important cause of treatment failure was disease relapse in 23 patients (38%).Relapse was the most common cause of death in patients transplanted with a family donor (67%), whereas death due to transplant related complication were more common in patients who received grafts from MUD. 45% of patients with family donors relapsed with ALL, whereas relapse occurred in 26% of patients with MUD transplants. Conclusion/discussion: ASCT is a potentially curative treatment modality for adult patients with ALL where other treatment options have minor possibilities of success and should be offered to a greater proportion of patients in fi rst remission than was common practice in the 20 year study period.",

Taube (1) , M. Schleuning (1) , H. Baurmann (1) , R. Schwerdtfeger (1) (1)Deutsche Klinik f\u00fcr Diagnostik (Wiesbaden, DE) ; (2) University Frankfurt (Frankfurt, DE) Background: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is the only curative treatment in patients with high risk leukaemia. By using reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) alloSCT can be offered to patients well beyond 50 years of age. The lower rate of transplant related mortality (TRM) after RIC is offset in part by a higher rate of relapse. Since introduction of RIC in our center we have seen an increase in extramedullary relapses (EMR) . Treatment of EMR is diffi cult and requires a precise evaluation of extramedullary AML manifestations. Here we report about our experiences with [18F]Fluorodexyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and CT (PET-CT scan) for detecting sites of EMR. Patients and Methods: In 2007 we observed 7 patients with histologically proven EMR after alloSCT in our center. PET-CT scan was used in three for detection of solid extramedullary AML manifestations. PET-CT scans were performed using FDG and standard PET and CT scanner. Results: In all three patients the histology based EMR diagnosis was confi rmed by PET-CT scan. Furthermore in two Patients we were able to fi nd additional sites of EMR as compared to standard radiological methods as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRT) only. Conclusion: PET-CT Scan seems to be of diagnostic value in AML patients with extramedullary relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In order to evaluate its sensitivity (and specifi city) we are currently performing of PET-CT scan in these patients in a prospective, biopsy controlled manner.",

The impact on overall survival (OS) was not so clearly demonstrated due to higher treatment-related mortality (TRM). Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), the use of unrelated donor, new supportive therapy and diagnostic procedures introduced in recent years can affect results of alloSCT. To evaluate the role of these factors we retrospectively analysed outcome of pts with intermediate-risk AML in 1.CR transplanted in last 5 years at our transplant centre and we also compare their outcome with pts indicated for allo-SCT but treated by chemotherapy (CHT) due to lacking of donor or refusal of alloSCT.",

The source of stem cell was peripheral blood in 93%. GVHD prophylaxis were CSA/MTX. The control group consisted of 19 pts with intermediate-risk AML in 1.CR indicated for alloSCT but treated by CHT due to lacking of donor or refusal of allo-SCT. The control group except for the younger age did not differ in any prognostic parameters. Results: all transplanted pts engrafted. 9 pts (30%) developed acute GvHD and among 25 evaluable pts 9 pts (36%) developed chronic GvHD. 3 pts (10%) relapsed and 5 pts (16%) died due to TRM. The estimated probabilities of 3-years DFS and OS were 84% and 60%. Type of donor or conditioning regimen did not have any statistical infl uence on transplant results. Among CHT treated pts 2 (11%) of them died due to TRM and 10 pts (53%) relapsed. The estimated probabilities of 3-years DFS and OS were 31% and 40%. AlloSCT with comparable TRM (p=0,69) signifi cantly improved DFS (p=0.001), cumulative RI (p=0,002) and there was a trend for better OS (p=0, 10) in comparison with CHT. Conclusions:1. in comparison with CHT alloSCT with low TRM in recent years and low RI improved DFS of pts with intermediate-risk AML in 1.CR. The smaller difference in OS can be explained by the effect of salvage treatment of relapsed pts in CHT group (80% salvage treatment, 50% alloSCT). 2.

Oelschl\u00e4gel, B. Mohr, U. Platzbecker, C. Thiede, M. Bornh\u00e4user, G. Ehninger, T. Illmer TU Dresden (Dresden, DE) Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is an immunoconjugate consisting of a humanized CD33 monoclonal antibody linked to the enediyene calicheamicin. GO is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States as single agent for the treatment of CD33 positive AML in fi rst relapse in patients 60 years of age or older not eligible for other cytostatic therapy. GO has been also used in combination with conventional chemotherapy in CD33+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We retrospectively analyzed 26 patients with CD33+ primary refractory or relapsed AML receiving the MFAC regimen (GO, fl udarabine, ara-C and ciclosporin CsA) directly followed in aplasia by reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) for allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Early treatment assessment revealed an overall response (OR) of 65.4%. Grade III/IV hepatic toxicity occured in 30.8% of the patients. The median time to allograft was 22.5 days. 77% of all patients proceeded to allogeneic HSCT. All patients except one obtained granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. In 15 patients unmodifi ed blood stem cells were used, the graft of 5 patients underwent ex-vivo CD3/CD19-depletion, four out of fi ve in context of haploidentical transplantation. Unmodifi ed grafts (n=15) were derived from related and unrelated donors in 5 and 10 cases, respectively. Donor and recipient were HLA-mismatched in 4 cases. Grade III/IV hepatic toxicity after allografting was observed in 25%, including one patient with veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The median neutrophil and platelet engraftement occured in patients receiving unmodifi ed grafts on day 13 (range 8 -27) and day 17 (range 9 -103), respectively. Using ex-vivo CD3/CD19 depleted grafts, median neutrophil and platelet engraftement was observed on day haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) . We report the case of a FIP1L1-PDGFRa positive acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who received both modalities of therapy. In December 2006, a male age 25 years, presented to our institution with AML. Bone marrow (BM) examination demonstrated increased eosinophil precursors, myeloblasts of 24%. BM karyotype was complex with structural aberrations of chromosomes 1,3,16 and 18. Molecular genetics confi rmed FIP1L1-PDGFRa fusion product but no evidence BCR-ABL or JAK2 V617F mutations. The patient received two cycles of FLAG-Ida chemotherapy on the UK MRC AML 15 trial. Although haematologic remission was achieved (BM myeloblasts <5%), the BM karyotype demonstrated cytogenetic evolution, with persistence of FIP1L1-PDGFRa. Imatinib mesylate (IM) (400 mg once daily) was commenced after the FLAG-Ida #2 until myeloablative matched unrelated allograft [Cyclophosphamide/TBI/Campth conditioning, GVHD prophylaxis methotrexate/ciclosporin] in May 2007. At the time of HSCT the patient was in haematologic and molecular remission and IM was discontinued. Progressive chronic GVHD (skin) grade III occurred at day +136 post HSCT and was managed with extracorporeal photopheresis and prednisolone. The patient remained in molecular and haematologic remission until 6 months post HSCT when FIP1L1-PDGFRa fusion product was detected; necessitating recommencement of IM at 400mg daily. Despite this intervention the FIP1L1-PDG-FRa fusion product remained detectable prompting mutation analysis at 12 months post HSCT. A D842V IM resistant mutation, not previously described in AML was detected. Although IM was discontinued the patient was unable to tolerate Dasatinib and died of AML 15 months post HSCT. Although FIP1L1-PDG-FRa AML is uncommon, patients in whom allograft is thought necessary should undergo mutation screening if molecular relapse is documented post HSCT.",

M\u00e1rquez-Malaver, I. Espigado, J. Falantes, M. Carmona, I. Montero, J. Gonz\u00e1lez, M.L. Martino, V. de la Osa, \u00c1. Urbano-Ispizua Hospital Universitario Virgen Del Roc\u00edo (Sevilla, ES) Clinical results obtained with stem cell Transplantation (SCT) in acute leukaemia (AL) pts are compared with those obtained with conventional chemotherapy. A potential bias for this comparison is the possibility of a positive selection of pts in the SCT group since poorer performance individuals may not be fi nally transplanted. Aims: To prospectively analyze the pre-SCT program phase of a tertiary Institution, in order to identify: 1) the reasons why SCT in candidates with AL is not fi nally performed, 2) the clinical differences between AL transplanted pts and those candidates that fi nally do not receive the procedure, and 3) to compare overall survival (OS) between AL transplanted pts vs the whole group of pts initially accepted in the SCT program. Patients: Between 2005 and 2008 pre-transplant data on 341 consecutive pts evaluated by the SCT Committee (SCTC) of our institution were prospectively collected and analyzed. Results: 101 AL pts were presented at the SCTC. SCT was considered not indicated in 13 out of the 101 candidates (13%). Diagnoses for the 88 pts accepted for SCT were ALL (34%) and AML (66%). Of those, 7 are awaiting SCT (8%), 59 pts have been transplanted (67%) (16 auto and 43 allo), with a median time from program inclusion to SCT of 4.1 m (1.07-14.2) , and 22 pts (25%) were not fi nally transplanted due to clinical complications and disease progression (10), poor autologous stem cell mobilization (5), patient's refusal (2) , absence of donor (1) and other reasons (4). A higher rate of pts with no recent evaluation or active disease at the time of presentation in the SCTC were not fi nally transplanted (50% vs 21%; p=0.03). At last follow-up, the group of transplanted pts had superior OS than those that fi nally do not undergo the procedure (33% vs 0%; p=0.03) (Fig.1 ) and also better than the whole group of pts initially included in the program (33% vs 27%). Conclusions: SCT was not performed in 25% of AL pts initially included in the SCT program mainly due to poor autologous stem cell mobilization, clinical complications and disease progression. Our study identifi es the leukaemia status at the time of inclusion in the SCT program as a crucial factor for the scheduled transplants' feasibility. The group of AL pts that fi nally do not undergo the SCT has very poor outcome and should be considered when analysing AL therapeutic strategies.",

Criscuolo (2) (1)Division of Hematology and SC T (Rionero in Vulture, IT); (2) Division of Hematology and SC T (Naples, IT) The current study aimed to evaluate the effi cacy and toxicity of a combination of intravenous (iv) Busulphan (Bu) and continuous infusion (c.i.) Idarubicin (IDA) as a conditioning to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The protocol included IDA at 20mg/sqm daily as 3 days continuous infusion (from day -13 to -11) and intravenous BU at 3.2 mg/kg daily from day -5 to -2. Patients aged over 60 years received a reduced schedule (two days IDA and 3 days BU at the same dose). Twenty-fi ve patients with a median age of 51 years (28-72) were enrolled. All patients received peripheral blood stem cells. The median interval between diagnosis and ASCT was 4 months. The median number of CD34+ cells infused was 5.9x10 6 /kg. The median number of days to PMN >500/cmm and platelets >20000/cmm was 10 and 13, respectively. In order to perform a comparison in terms of hematological and non hematological toxicity, a group of 30 patients, who were previously autografted after conditioning with IDA and oral Bu was considered. Selection of factors for a matched pair analysis included median age, percentage of subjects aged over 60 years, median CD34+ cell received, cytogenetic and molecular fi ndings and percent of secondary AML. In both subgroups no occurrence of transplant related toxicity (TRM) was registered; in addition, results in terms of neutrophils and platelet recovery, need of RBC and S98 platelet transfusion were comparable. Finally, no difference was found as far as occurrence of documented infections (either bacterial or fungal) as well as of FUO and liver, cardiac, renal or pulmonary toxic episodes. On the contrary, patients conditioned with iv BU experienced much less frequently grade 3-4 oral mucositis as compared to the control group (12% vs 80%, p:<0.0001). This resulted in less frequent use and shorter duration of TPN (20% vs. 83%, p: < 0.0001; 5 days vs. 11 days, p: 0.02, respectively) and shorter duration of hospitalization (27 days vs. 31 days, p: 0.04). Finally, patients conditioned with iv BU had signifi cantly lower need of narcotic analgesics (13% vs 80%, p:<0.0001). We conclude that replacement of oral with intravenous BU results in a more favorable toxicity profi le. A longer follow-up is required to assess a potential advantage in terms of disease free survival.",

Curti, S. Paolini, S. Rizzi, M.R. Motta, M. Baccarani S. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital (Bologna, IT) The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of HLA matching on the outcome of unrelated transplant for AML. 60 adult pts where transplanted from 1998 to 2008. Median age was 39 yrs (range 16-56). 24 were in 1st CR, 8 in 2nd CR and 28 in more advanced phase. Patients and donors were typed for HLA-A, B, C, DR, DQ at the molecular level: 23 patients were fully matched, at 10/10 loci (group I); 10 had one or two allelic mismatches and 27 had antigenic mismatches and/or more then 2 allelic mismatches (group II). Of the 23 fully matched pts 14 were in 1st CR vs 10 of 37 of the mismatched transplants. The source of stem cells was predominantly bone marrow (50 pts). The preparative regimen was myeloablative in 90% of the cases, being TBI-based in 21 patients and Busulfan-based in 30. In all cases, ATG-Fresenius was added to the preparative regimens, usually at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg /day for fi ve days (from days -6 to -2, total dose 15-30 mg/kg). The prophylaxis of GVHD was based on the association of CsA and MTX (four doses). Engraftment: all patients but two engrafted aGVHD: overall incidence of grade II was 12%, grade III 6% and grade IV 6%. cGVHD: overall incidence of limited was 18%, extensive 10%. The incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD and cGVHD was 4% and 22% in group I, and 19% and 32% in group II, respectively. TRM and relapse were mainly related to the phase of the disease, with the worst results observed in decreasing order from the advanced phases to 2nd CR to 1st CR. However, even within each category of disease phase, the degree of matching had an impact. 1st CR: 1yr TRM 7% in the fully matched group vs 30% in the remaining patients; 1yr relapse 0% in the 10/10 group vs 14% for the others. Overall Survival: 92% vs 60% at 4 years respectively. Advanced Disease: 4 yr TRM 45% for the fully matched transplants vs 46% for the mismatched; 4yr relapse 14% in the fully matched group vs 77% in the others. Overall Survival at 4 years was 52% for the 10/10 pairs vs 10% in the others. Results of myeloablative unrelated transplants in AML are very successful when a 10/10 match is used, both in 1 st CR and advanced disease. It is likely that a stronger GVL effect occurs with VUD transplants, not evidently related to an increase in GVHD.",

Egeland Rikshospitalet National Hospital (Oslo, NO) Introduction: Allogeneic blood stem transplantation is a highly effective and potentially curative treatment for acute myeloid leucaemia (AML). However, this is counterbalanced by a relatively high treatment related mortality (TRM). We started using the Busulfan 16 mg/kg, Cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg (Bu4Cy2) regimen for this disease in 1990 and present our long-term experience from 1990-2008. Family donors with up to one HLA-mismatch and unrelated donors with up to one of ten molecular mismatches were accepted. From 1999 the busulfan dosage was adjusted according to farmaco-kinetic measurements. No ATG was used for conditioning. GVHD prophylaxis was cyclosporin and metotraxate on day 1,3,6 and 11. The patients transplanted in fi rst remission (CR1) had an intermediate or high risk for relapse. Results: 188 transplants were performed, 101 in CR1 and 87 in relapse, later remissions or in patients with primary induction failure. Median follow-up time is 8 years. The patients were 15-64 years of age, with a median of 41 years. Transplants in CR1 were performed in 83 with a family donor and in 18 with a matched unrelated donor. 13 patients have so far relapsed and have died, 18 (18%) of the patients died from TRM, 3 patients from other causes. 67 patients are alive in CR. In the group beyond fi rst remission or with primary refractory disease, 41 patients were transplanted with a family donor and 46 with a matched unrelated donor. 49 patients are dead, 19 of these from relapse. 28 patients died from treatment related complications, thus a TRM of 32%. 2 patients are alive in hematological remission after re-induction treatment, 36 alive in complete CR without relapse. Conclusions: We confi rm that Bu4Cy2 has considerable antileukemic activity in AML. Our long-term results concerning longterm stable remissions and TRM confi rms the results reported by other investigators. The regimen may be used safely in selected patients up to 65 years of age.",

Cetkovsky Institute of Haematology (Prague, CZ) Introduction: Although allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation leads to durable remission in many intermediate and high-risk acute leukemia patients, substantial number of post transplant relapses especially in the high-risk group lead to treatment failure. Potency of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), to clear CD33+ blasts is well known. Usually this effect is only temporary in the majority of non-transplanted patients. Concurrently the drug is known to induce sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), which can be accented when connected with subsequent transplantation. Patients and methods: Between the years 2001-2008 GO was administered prior to allogeneic transplant conditioning regimen in 13 patients with high risk acute myeloid leukaemia. The patients were either refractory or relapsing after conventional chemotherapy treatment. Following to GO administration 10 patients received full intensity conditioning regimen, 8 of them based on total body irradiation (12 Gy) and 2 on busulfan 8 mg/kg, 3 patients were transplanted in reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. Overall and disease free survival was evaluated by Cox regression analysis.",

Prebet, J. El Cheikh, C. Faucher, N. Vey, A. Charbonnier, C. Chabannon, D. Blaise, S. Furst Institut Paoli Calmettes (Marseille, FR) Although imatinib improves the CR rate in Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL), it remains possible that the improved initial responses to imatinib will not translate into improved survival. To date, myeloablative therapy (MAC) followed by sibling or matched unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) represents the current best available treatment option for appropriately aged patients (pt) with Ph+ALL in CR1. The use of reduced intensity regimens (RIC) and alternative donors such as umbilical cord blood (UCB) can offer an attractive treatment modality especially to older pt and those who lack a suitable matched donor. At our institution the policy was to offer an AHSCT to all CR1 Ph+ALL pt from a matched sibling or unrelated donor or a UCB unit; a RIC regimen was used for elderly pt or pt receiving a UCB transplant. Between June 2003 and September 2008 16 consecutive Ph+ALL adult pt received an AHSCT at our institution, of whom 6 from a sibling donor, 4 from an unrelated 10/10 matched donor and 6 with one or two UCB units; 8 pt were transplanted after a MAC regimen, and 8 after a RIC regimen. Median age at transplant was 41 years (range, 19-59); all pt were in fi rst complete hematological remission at time of transplant [major cytogenetic response (MCyR, n=2), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR, n=6), major molecular response (MMR, n=4) and complete molecular response (CMR, n=4)]. All pt received a tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) before transplant (imatinib=14 pt or dasatinib=2 pt)., and TKI were reintroduced after transplant in pt with satisfactory hematological recovery (10 pt). After a median follow-up of 790 (range, 98-1755) days after AHSCT, 14 pt are alive of whom 11 are in CMR. Objective responses following AHSCT without TKI were obtained in 5 pt. Non-relapse mortality was 6% (one pt died of extensive chronic GVHD in CMR) and 4 pt relapsed early after transplant at a median time of 130 (range, 40-216) days, of whom 2 pt had developed primary graft failure after UCBT. 8 pt developed acute GVHD (grade I=3, grade II=3, grade III=20), and 7 pt had chronic GVHD (extensive, n= 4 and limited, n=3). Our results suggest that AHSCT after TKI therapy is feasible without increased toxicity regardless of donor type and conditioning regimen. Postallogeneic TKI maintenance strategies may further improve results by eradicating minimal residual disease and needs to be investigated in clinical trials.",

Gjadrov Kuvezdic, R. Lasan Trcic, D. Ozretic, B. Labar University Hospital Center Zagreb (Zagreb, HR) Ewing Sarcoma is the second most common bone tumor in children and young adults. Primary vertebral Ewing sarcoma (ES)/primary neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) is very rare, especially with intraspinal infi ltration. Most cases of ES contain somatic translocation t(11;22) (q24;q12). We present a case of a boy who was diagnosed with Non Hodgkin lymphoma (B immunophenotype) of the stomach at the age of 12. He was treated according to BFM 90 protocol. Complete remission (CR) was achieved. At the age of 17 he was admitted to our department because of the anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue and hypertrophy of the gums. The diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M4) was established cytomorfologically while immunophenotypic analysis suggested pro T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (proT-ALL) with co-expression of myeloid markers (due to presence CD2+,CD3-,citCD3+,CD7+,TdT+) with 60% of CD 117 marker. Cytogenetic analysis revealed complex chromosome abnormalities (46XY,t(q26;q27),del(7q22),t(8;19)(q23;p12),der(18q). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for the most common mutations was negative. He received induction therapy with Ara-C and idarubicine. CR was achieved and consolidation therapy (NOVIA) followed. Allogenic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) from the HLA identical family donor was performed after standard conditioning regimen (Busulfan iv and Endoxan) in February 2007 with three lineage engraftment and 100% chimera on the lymphocytes and granulocytes of the peripheral blood. Eight months after allo-BMT he presented with paraparesis of the lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging showed massive intraspinal infi ltration with tumorous tissue from L4 to S1. An operation proceeded and histologically a small-blue-cell tumor (CD99 positive) was observed, indicating ES/PNET. Immunophenotypic analysis of bone marrow aspirate revealed CD45-CD90+CD117+ immunophenotype typical for tumors of neuroectodermal origin. No leukemia or lymphoma cells were found. Cytogenetic analysis showed complex pseudodiploid clone with numeric and structural abnormalities (46) (47) XY+del(1p22) ,+2del(6q),t(11;22)(q24;q13 .3),-16[cp10]/46XY) of which translocation t(11;22) is characteristic for ES, although PCR analysis for (EWS/FLI1 type 1 and 2) was negative. Conclusion: We presented a case of 17-year -old patient with three malignant diseases in a fi ve-year period, which is to our knowledge not described in the literature. AML t(8;21) treated in our centre who received either induction chemotherapy followed by consolidation or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Patients And Methods: We retrospectively evaluated data for 29 consecutive patients who were treated in the adult haematology unit between 1990 and 2004 who were found to have t(8;21) at diagnosis and were selected to receive either allogenic transplantation (ALLO, n=14) following achievement of fi rst complete remission (CR1) or to continue with chemotherapy alone(CHEMO, n=15). Median age was 23.5 and 19 respectively. All patients received standard induction chemotherapy and 84% achieved remission with fi rst line therapy. In the ALLO group, 14 patients received a planned allogeneic transplantation following CR1; 4/14 (28%) proceeded straight to allografting, while 10/14 (72%) received a further course of consolidation. In the CHEMO group, 46% received 3 or more courses HDAC; 26% received 2 doses, 26% received 1 dose. Median dosage was 12g/m 2 per cycle. Results: The estimated survival for the ALLO group was 54% at 7 years, and the mean event free survival was 60 months. In the CHEMO group, median survival was 28 moths and EFS was 12 months, and probability of survival was less than 30% at 6 years. In the ALLO group 3 patients relapsed vs 13 in the CHEMO group (21.4 vs 86.7% p=0.001). Number of patients surviving was 8 for ALLO vs 6 for CHEMO (57.1% vs 40% p=0.3). Of note, of 7 patients who received 3 or more cycles of high dose Ara-C, 6 (85%) relapsed in less than one year of completion of therapy. Conclusion: We demonstrate signifi cantly lower rates of relapse and better disease free survival in a Middle Eastern cohort transplanted in CR1 compared to HDAC. The study is limited by the small numbers and the fi ndings would need to be confi rmed by further studies in other non-white populations. Allografting in CR1 should be considered in such patients, especially in the presence of other high risk features. Autologous transplantation may be a less toxic alternative. The biology of AML with t(8;21)in our population is under further study.",

Interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics and thus drug exposure are significant and does not always allow a safe and effi cient therapy. High busulfan exposure is associated with toxicity, especially veno-occlusive disease (VOD), whereas low exposure results in decreased effi cacy, which might result in lower engraftment rates. The purpose of our study was to implement analytical method based on liquid chromatography to routinely determination of busulfan concentrations in clinical practice. A sensitive and specifi c assay, involving pre-column diethyldithiocarbamate sodium (DDTC) derivatization was developed and validated for the quantifi cation of busulfan in human plasma. The reported assay requires only 600 \u00b5l of plasma for the analysis, and its sensitivity is proper by monitoring samples at a wavelength of 280 nm. The internal standard was 1,6-bismethansulfonyloxyhexane. The retention times of busulfan and the internal standard derivatives were 12.5 min and 25.8 min. respectively. No interfeces were detected at the retention time of this two compounds in plasma containing co-administred drugs, which may be present in clinical samples. The lower limit of detection was 20 ng/ml with a limit of quantitation of 60 ng/ml. Calibration curves were linear from 60 ng/ml to 2500 ng/ml. Our modifi cation improves peak separation in chromatograms. The sample preparation was rapid, not complicated without special equipment. The preparation of 20 samples takes about 3 hours. This method is suitably for the therapeutic monitoring of busulfan in plasma following oral administration of 1mg/kg b.w. of the drug.",

Quah University Children's Medical Institute (Singapore, SG) Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in paediatric patients with high risk AML such as non-Down de novo acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), transformed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), therapy-related AML (tAML) and refractory AML (rAML) is limited by graft failure, regimen related toxicity and relapse. To minimize these risks and late effects related to total body irradiation (TBI), we treated 10 such consecutive patients (AMKL, n=2; MDS/ AML, n=4; tAML, n=1; rAML; n=3), median age 7.6 (range, 1.3 -17.0) years with a non-TBI based myeloablative regimen that included 3 active agents against AML with non-overlapping toxicities followed by bone marrow (n=4), peripheral blood (n=5) or umbilical cord blood (n=1) HSCT between September 05 and July 08. Three patients received stem cells (SC) from HLA 6/6 matched related donors while 7 patients received SC from alternate donors (AD) (HLA 5/6 matched related or HLA 6/6 matched unrelated donors). At HSCT, 6 patients were in 1st complete remission (CR1), 2 in CR2 and 2 in relapse. All received IV Fludarabine 125 mg/m 2 , IV Busulfan 0.8 -1.2 mg/kg 6 hourly, IV Melphalan, 140mg/ m 2 . AD recipients also received ATG (Thymoglobuline) 5mg/ kg. GVHD prophylaxis was with Cyclosporine/ Methotrexate (MTX) except for CBT where Mycophenolate Motfetil was used instead of MTX. Excluding the 2 patients who were in relapse, all achieved myeloid engraftment at median of 14 (range, 9 -16) days and sustained stable full donor chimera from 21 days after HSCT. Signifi cant post-HSCT complications included engraftment syndrome (n=4) and reactivation of Herpes viruses (n=4). Incidence of grade I-III acute and chronic GVHD were 63% and 67%, respectively. All were alive at median follow-up of 303 (range, 44 -1037) days Karnosky/ Lansky scores 90 -100%. The 2 patients in relapse had secondary graft failures and subsequently died of disease at a median of 138 (range, 77 -198) days after HSCT. This FLU-based regimen was well tolerated and provided prompt/ robust engraftment in children/ adolescent with high risk AML. In this small series, early disease-free-survival of 80% appears to be superior compared to historical experience with TBI-based or busulfan/ cyclophosphamide regimens. The major drawback was the high rate of viral reactivation. Longer follow-up will defi ne the magnitude of GVHD/ graft-versus-leukemia effects and if a high event-freesurvival can be maintained with minimal late effects.",

All pts experienced a signifi cant WBC nadir on median day +6, and began aphaeresis in recovered WBC up to 5.0x10 9 /L on day +12(median). All analyzed patients reached at least 2x106/kg CD34+ cells with median 3 (ranges 1-6) aphaeresis procedures. 16 (78%) of pts began collection on day +10, +11 or +12 and 4 (22%) pts did not begin aphaeresis until day +17 or longer. One patient failed mobilization. In statistical data we followed several variables concerning the platelet count on day 1 of aphaeresis which correlated with the ability to collect over 5x106CD34+cells/kg (p<0,001) and previously received chemotherapy cycles of 6 pts(32%) who started aphaeresis on median day +17 (p<0,001). We can conclude that the VP-16+G-CSF mobilizing regimen for AML patients showed effective with excellent yields results for median 3 day leukopheresis procedure. We didn't observe statistical difference between the dose schedule and the number of collected MNC in both groups. This confi rms the possibility for establishing VP-16 1gr/m\u00b2 + G-CSF 10mcg/kg regimen as primary mobilizing regimen for AML patients that undergo autologous transplantation in fi rst complete remission.",

Most relapses occur in the bone marrow. However, isolated extramedullary relapses (EMRs) occur. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence and outcome of EMRs in a consecutive cohort (n=321) of AML patients who had undergone allogeneic HSCT at Karolinska University Hospital -Huddinge from 1977-2008. Eighteen patients with EMR of AML (17) or MDS-AML (1) were identifi ed. As the patient number is limited and statistical power is diffi cult to obtain we used statistical analysis as a help to detect trends. The frequency of EMR was 5.6%, with a signifi cantly higher frequency among patients who had undergone HSCT because of advanced disease (8.9% vs. 2.0%; p=0.01). Extramedullary relapse was more common in children (12.8%) than in adults (3.3%; p=0.02), with an especially high frequency in girls (14.3%). The most frequent locations of EMR were in breast tissue (5) and skin (3). The median time from HSCT to EMR was 17.8 months (range 4.3-127) . Five of the eighteen patients subsequently developed bone marrow relapses after a median time of 69 days (range 25-93). Six of the 18 patients were alive at 2, 3, 4, 34, 42 and 177 months after EMR. However no signifi cant difference were seen in the overall mortality in females (46.6%), males (45.1%) or children (43.6%) looking at all AML patients being transplanted at our center. The mean survival time for all deceased AML patients post-HSCT was 24.4 months. Meanwhile the mean survival time for the deceased AML patients with EMR was 16.8 months.

Vicente Hospital Morales Meseguer (Murcia, ES) Objetive: To analize the impact on outcome of residual disease (RD) determined by multiparametric fl ow cytometry (MFC) in bone marrow (BM) before allogenic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 37 consecutive patients diagnosed with AML who underwent an ASCT in our Unit between June 1996 and April 2007. We collected data of RD on BM by MFC on the 30 days previous to the transplant procedure. The leukemia-associated phenotype was detected by MFC in all cases at diagnosis and/or in relapse and was used for monitoring RD. Results: Median age of patients in our cohort was 40 years (range 10-66), 19 males and 18 females, 32 patients received a transplant from an HLA-identical sibling donor and 5 from an HLA-identical unrelated donor. Six patients received a reduced intensity conditioning regimen. In 33 cases peripheral blood was used as source of stem cells and bone marrow in the other 4. All the patients had received at least 2 cycles of chemotherapy before transplant. Twenty nine were in complete remission (CR) (26 in fi rst CR and 3 in second or >2ndCR) and 8 had active disease (2 in early relapse and 6 with refractory disease). Eleven patients had high-risk cytogenetics at diagnosis. With a median follow up after transplantation of 9 months (range 5-161) 10 patients (27%) relapsed. At 4 years, disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 59% and 75% respectively. On the group who underwent transplant with active disease (n=8). The median survival of this group was 24 months. Two of the 8 patients are alive and in CR. RD value were very varied, median 0,88% (0,2%-9%). Those patients with a RD <0,4% presented a superior DFS than patients with RD >0,4% (median not reached (MNR) versus 80 months; p=0,044). OS was higher in patients with RD <0,4%, although the survival advantage was not statistically signifi cant (MNR versus 140 months; p>0,05). DFS and OS were better in the group of intermediate risk cytogenetics than in the group of high-risk cytogenetics (MNR versus 30,5 months; p=0,04 and MNR versus 106 months; p=0,015). Conclusions: Detection of high levels of RD before transplantation and high-risk cytogenetics at diagnosis are associated with high risk of relapse after ASCT. These factors should be helpful to identify groups of patients who need new approaches to reduce postransplant relapses.",

Cascavilla Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza (San Giovanni Rotondo, IT) The role of ASCT in elderly patients (pts) with AML is under investigation. We supposed that GO could have benefi cial effects as maintenance therapy after hematopoietic ASCT in high-risk pts. We report on 9 (6 males and 3 females with a median age of 67) elderly AML pts in fi rst (8) or second (1) CR who received 4 fractionated doses of GO as maintenance therapy following ASCT. Patient 1 was in 2nd CR following an induction regimen of 2 cycles of fl udarabine (Flu) + cytarabine (Ara-C) + idarubicin (Ida); he previously underwent ASCT, using a conditioning regimen of Bu-Cy. One patient had an AML refractory to a standard induction chemotherapy (3 + 7 regimen) and rescued with 1 MEC regimen. The other pts were in 1st CR following an induction regimen of 2 cycles of Flu + Ara-C. HLA-matched donors were not available for any pts. Three months after obtaining S102 CR, all pts received a myeloablative conditioning regimen and underwent ASCT. Two months after the complete engraftment, pts started treatment with GO. To date 7 of them are alive and in CR at +35, +22, +16, +12, +8, +6 and +4 months respectively, while the overall survival at the moment of reporting was +58, +27, +28, +16, +11,+10 and +8 months. Two pts were relapsed at +12 e +14 respectively from the ASCT and one of them died due to disease progression at +18 months. One patient is alive and in 2nd CR at +28 months from the diagnosis and to date he is scheduled to undergo unrelated allogeneic transplant. Six patients completed all the scheduled therapeutic approach. There were no cases of grade 3 or 4 liver toxicity and bleeding was not observed in any cases. Thrombocytopenia (50,000-100,000 cells/\u00ecL) occurred in all pts and neutropenia (500-1000 cells/\u00ecL) in 2 patients. In conclusion, in our study, despite limited in number, GO demonstrated a good effi cacy when administered in fractionated doses as maintenance therapy after ASCT in older patients with CD33+ AML in 1st or 2nd CR. GO showed an acceptable tolerability profi le, with no severe hepatotoxicity and no bleeding risk. Thrombocytopenia occurred in all patients and in all cases there was a rapid platelet recovery. A GO dose of 3 mg/m2 appeared to be better tolerated than the higher dose (6 mg/m2) and will be used in future studies. Our results could support a new therapeutic role for GO as a maintenance therapy to better manage minimal residual disease for patients in CR following hematopoietic ASCT.",

Balint, B. Todoric Zivanovic, O. Tasic, V. Skuletic, M. Malesevic, S. Marjanovic Military Medical Academy (Belgrade, RS) Introduction: There are three approaches for consolidation of patients (pts) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (with exception of acute promyelocitic leukemia). Those approaches are either allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) or conventional therapy. Aim: We have analyzed retrospectively 74 pts with AML divided into three groups-conventional, autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) and allogeneic SCT group with respect to relapses, time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). Material and Methods: We have treated 110 pts with AML from 2001 till 2008. Nine of them had acute promyelocytic leukemia and 27 pts have showed primary resistance. We have enrolled 74 pts into these analysis-30 pts into \"conventional\" (M/F 23/7, median age 48,6 years), 30 pts in the \"autologous transplant\" (M/F 13/13, median age 33,5 years) and 18 pts in the \"allogeneic transplant group\"(M/F 13/5, median age 31,6 years). After one or two courses of standard induction \"7+3\"), pts have received three more cycles of consolidation (MAE, MidAC and ICE) and last one was used for mobilization of autologous peripheral stem cells in approved complete remission. Both transplant groups immediately undergone conditioning up to standard BuCy2\u00b1IDA regimen and \"conventional group\" have received maintenance therapy with Thioguanin 160 mg daily per os and Cyto ARA 100 mg subcutaneously daily for 5 days. Prophylaxis of GvHD in allogeneic group is combination of Cyclosporine A and Metothrexate. Results: On intention-to-treat analysis number of relapses was signifi cantly lower in allogeneic group (1/18-5,55%, p<0,005) while there were no difference between other two groups (autologous 12/26 -46% vs 13/30 -43,3%, ns). TTR was longer in autologous group but not signifi cantly (9,4 range 2-42 vs 8,7 range 1-48 months). There were signifi cantly better OS in allogeneic group compared to others while there is no signifi cance between autologous and conventional group (log rank test-au:al 2,88, p<0,01; con: al 2,69, p<0,01; au:con 0,57, ns). Median survival in allogeneic group was 37,5 months (range 7-86 months).",

Ghavamzadeh Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center (Tehran, IR) Introduction: Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) in fi rst Complete Remission (CR1) is standard of care. In addition, the studies show the cure when patients are transplanted in second Complete Remission or in fi rst relapse. In this study, the outcome of AML patients with allogeneic HSCT in CR1 versus other than CR1 was compared. Patients and Methods: Since March 1991 until November 2008, from 420 AML patients, 312 patients in CR1 with median age of 27 years and 108 patients in other than CR1 with median age of 29 years have undergone allogeneic HSCT. Male/Female ratio was 168/144 in CR1 group and 55/53 in other than CR1. Totally 391 patients received Peripheral Blood, 27 patients Bone Marrow and 2 ones Cord Blood as sources of HSCT. Result: At present 266 (85%) patients in CR1 and 73 (68%) patients in other than CR1 are alive. The most common cause of death in CR1 group was Graft Versus Host Disease and in other than CR1 group was relapse. Median follow up time was 17 month (range: 1-158 month). Six month Disease Free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in CR1 was 86% and 91% (SE=2%). 2-years DFS and OS in CR1 was 78% (SE=3%) and 85% (SE=2%). Six month DFS and OS in other than CR1 was 64% (SE=5%) and 75% (SE=4%). In this group 2-years DFS and OS was 50% and 64% (SE=5%). It is considerable that six month DFS and OS in transplanted patients with CR1 was signifi cantly higher than in other than CR1 (p<0.001). Furthermore, 2-years DFS and OS in patients with CR1 were better than second group (P< 0.001). Conclusion: Although results of HSCT in other than fi rst complete remission is not as good as in fi rst complete remission but it seems that it is good enough to advice for doing allogeneic HSCT for these patients.",

Cervello (Palermo, IT) We report two cases of extramedullary relapses after allogeneic transplantation in BCR/ABL+ AML patients successfully treated with dasatinib. Case 1: on July 06 a 56 yrs old lady was diagnosed with AML BCR/ABL p210+. After induction she achieved CR; on October 06 maintenance therapy with imatinib was started but she relapsed on December 06. 2\u00b0 CR was obtained and on February 07 she received an HLA related allogeneic transplant after BUCY2 conditioning. She developed grade I aGVHD, responsive to steroid. She remained in molecular remission with a limited cGVHD until March 08, when she complained of a severe back pain: a CT scan showed a large abdominal mass and a thyroid enlargement; a diagnostic biopsy documented the presence of immature cells bcr/abl+ with a T cell phenotype (TdT +, CD34+, CD79a+, CD10+, HLADR+, MPO-). Bone marrow was negative for blasts but positive for bcr/abl and showed a mixed chimerism. She received dasatinib, 70 mg/bid, with a S103 dramatic improvement of the symptoms, a reduction of the thyroid enlargement and of the abdominal mass; after 1 month of dasatinib the marrow molecular signal disappeared and donor chimerism was restored. After 8 months of treatment the patient is doing well with a signifi cative reduction of the mass and in complete molecular remission. Case 2: on October 06 a 27 yrs old lady presented with AML BCR/ABL p210+; during induction she developed invasive fungal infection and no further chemotherapy was given but imatinib 800 mg, without molecular response. She was then shifted to dasatinib 70mg/bid and transplanted from her HLA identical sister on July 07, obtaining molecular remission. She developed grade I aGVHD responsive to steroid. On November 07 molecular signal reappeared and she was given again dasatinib 70 mg/bid and cyclosporine was stopped: a complete molecular response was obtained, but on February 08 dasatinib was stopped due to toxicities and donor lymphocytes infusion was planned but she never received DLI because of an extensive cGVHD. While on molecular remission with full donor chimerism, on August 08 an axillary mass (7x5cm) appeared and consisted with a granuloblastic sarcoma (CD34+;CD117 +;MPO+;Ki67+). Dasatinib was started again and the axyllary mass rapidly reduced. After 4 months of treatment the mass almost disappeared and she is in molecular remission. In these 2 cases cGVHD was not effective in controlling extramedullary relapses, while dasatinib seemed to effectively control the disease.",

Aleinikova Belarusian Center for Ped OncoHematology (Minsk, BY) The aim of our study was the comparison of clinical outcome after hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (HSCT) between busulfan (BU)-contained and total body irradiation (TBI)-based regimens of conditioning in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients and methods: 25 pts with ALL underwent the allogeneic HSCT in one center from 2004 to 2008. The remaining 25 pts (median age, 11 (2, y, male/female -12/13) were categorized according to protocol of conditioning. Regimen of conditioning consists of BU for 13 pts (group I) and TBI for 12 pts (group II). Twenty pts were transplanted in complete remission (CR) >I (10 pts included in group I and 10 pts -in group II) and fi ve pts of high group risk with Ph-positive ALL (3 pts from group I and 2 pts from group II). Graft versus host disease GvHD prophilaxis included cyclosporine (CSA) alone 2 pts, CSA + metothrexat (MTX)-22 pts and 1 pts -tacrolimus. The mean time of follow-up was 10 \u00b1 2 months. We analyzed the rate of GvHD (grade > II), transplant related mortality (TRM), incidence of relapse (IR), overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS), relapse free survival (RFS) in both groups. Results: There were no differences in TRM and IR between two groups (p=0,3 and p=0,16; respectively). Evidence of GVHD was signifi cant higher for group II (8 out of 12pts, 12,6%) then for group I (2 out of 13pts, 15,3%) (p=0,009). Our data demonstrate that OS, EFS and RFS on TBI-based regimen (0,51 \u00b1 0,19, 0,37 \u00b1 0,19 and 0,80 \u00b1 0,18 respectively) were better than for BU-contained (0,27 \u00b1 0,15, 0,13\u00b10,12 and 0,24 \u00b1 0,21 respectively). We conclude that TBI-based regimen is better for OS and RFS than BU-contained (fi gure1); however, the rate of severe GVHD is signifi cantly higher in TBI-group. New modalities of chemobased regimens in conditioning are needed.",

Ciceri San Raffaele Scientifi c Institute (Milan, IT) Background: allogeneic (allo) stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the only potentially curative strategy for poor prognosis acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients (pts) older than 60 are rarely offered an alloSCT because of the procedure-related toxicities and the diffi culty to fi nd a matched relative, fi t to donate; SCT from alternative donors is usually controidicated in these pts because of the high rate of transplant related mortality (TRM). Since 2002, we have transplanted 25 pts, age \u2265 60, with advanced or high risk AML/MDS, from a matched unrelated (URD) or haploidenical related (HAPLO) donor. Data on feasibility and outcome are here reported. Aim: to retrospectively evaluate data on alloSCT from alternative donors in elderly AML and MDS pts, at our Institute. Methods: period 10/2002 to 10/2008, 25 pts, median age 63.7 (60-72.1). Diagnosis (WHO): AML 6, AMLMD 7, RAEB-1 2, RAEB-2 4, MDS/MPD 2, bifenotipic AL 1, t-related AML/ MDS 3. Median number of chemo cycles before SCT: 2 (0-7). Donors:URD 5, HAPLO 20. Disease status at SCT: CR1 9, CR2 2, upfront 2, refractory 6, relapsed 6. Conditioning regimens contained fl udarabine in 24 cases, treosulfan in 22, thiotepa in 2, cyclophosphamide, busulfan, melphalan in 1 case, ATG in all cases. GvHD prophylaxis: T-cell depletion in 11 cases, CSA/MTX in 11, rapamycin/MMF in 3. All pts received SCT from peripheral blood. Results: TRM before day+30: 2 (8%); 23 pts (92%) engrafted and were in CR at day+30, included 13 (93%) with active disease before SCT. Relapses were 5 (21.7%). Overall TRM was 44% (11 pts), 9 for infections, 2 for other causes; 4 pts died for disease progression, all deaths (15) occurring within the fi rst year after SCT. aGvHD grade>II: 4 cases; extensive cGvHD: 3 cases. At last follow-up (FU) 10 pts (40%) are alive in CR with a median FU of 770 (56-1375) days, median OS from SCT of all 25 pts was 227 (3-1375) days. Conclusions: alloSCT from alternative donors is feasible in elderly pts with AML or MDS. Long term survival free from disease has been obtained in several pts; notably, about one third of those transplanted with active disease are alive in CR at last follow up. Reduced-toxicity conditioning regimens showed limited early mortality; better prevention and management of infections could permit to reduce the overall TRM rate. In conclusion alloSCT from an alternative donor is a therapeutic option for pts with poor prognosis AML/MDS and advanced age.",

Adult NHL and MM patients requiring an autologous transplant were eligible. Patients received G (10mcg/kg/day) for 4 days; on the evening of day 4 they received either plerixafor (240mcg/ kg) or placebo. Patients underwent apheresis on Day 5 after a morning dose of G. Patients continued to receive evening study treatment followed by morning G and apheresis for up to pre-specifi ed number of apheresis days or until a target number of CD34+ cells/kg were collected. In 3101, an EMEA-specifi c composite endpoint was the proportion of NHL patients achieving \u22655 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg in 4 or fewer days of apheresis and engrafting successfully.

Marini (1) (1)Spedali Civili (Brescia, IT) ; (2) University of Brescia (Brescia, IT) Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are multipotent cells that are considered one of the most promising product for cellular therapy. MSC can be expanded from bone marrow and umbilical cord blood; recently, adipose tissue (AT) has been regarded as a more suitable and easily accessible source of MSC. We tested the effects of human platelet lysate (hPL) in comparison to fetal bovine serum (FBS) on expansion potential of AT-derived MSC. After informed consent and under local anesthesia, AT was obtained from patients undergoing liposuction for plastic surgery pourposes (n=5, range 8-16 x 10 6 cells). After enzymatic digestion of the liposuction product, cells were seeded (5 x 10 5 /cm\u00b2) in fl asks in Iscove's medium with the addition of either 5% hPL or FBS for human MSC (StemCell Technologies). Non-adherent cells were removed after 2-3 days and fresh medium changed twice weekly thereafter. On reaching confl uence, adherent cells were detached and replated at low density (2 x 10 3 /cm\u00b2) in the same medium conditions. At each passage, surface antigen expression was analyzed by fl owcytometry (CD45, CD90, CD105, CD73, CD166, CD144). Expanded MSC were analyzed for differentiative capacities by using specifi c differentiating medium for osteogenic (Mesen-Cult Human Osteogenic Supplement) and adipogenic (Mesen-Cult Human Adipogenic Supplement) differentiation. Expanded MSC were cryopreserved and after thawing cultures restarted; moreover, expanded MSC were analysed for the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities. Confl uent growth was obtained at each passage after 7-10 days, showing typical MSC phenotype (negativity for CD45 antigen, and positivity > 90% for CD90, CD73, CD105) and adipogenic and osteogenic differentiative capabilities, irrespective of medium used. However, median fold expansion at fi fth passage was 15322 (range 1400-76199) for hPL cultures and 422 (range 16-827) for FBS cultures, recovering a median of 87 x 109 MSC (range 9-206 x 10 9 ) and 1.3 x 10 9 MSC (range 0.1-2.5 x 10 9 ), respectively. Cryopreservation showed no detrimental effects on the expansion potential of AT-MSC. Karyotypic analysis did not disclose any cytogenetic abnormalities. In conclusion, AT represents a valid source of MSC that can be easily expanded in high numbers for clinical applications. Moreover, hPL can be considered a valuable substitute of FBS for MSC expansion. The advantages are even superior considering the compliance with the required criteria for somatic cell therapy applications.",

Monma, A. Tojo, S. Asano Institute of Medical Science (Tokyo, JP) Recently, umbilical cord blood from unrelated donors have been used as an alternative stem cell source for adult patients with hematologic malignancies. We analyzed the disease specifi c outcomes of adult myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients treated with unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) after myeloablative conditioning and identifi ed pre-transplant factors related to the transplant outcomes. Between August 1998 and August 2008, 34 adult patients with MDS were treated with unrelated CBT in our institute. Diagnosis at transplantation S105 included refractory anemia (RA) (n=4), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) (n=7), RAEB-t (n=2), and MDS-related secondary AML (n=21) . All patients received four fractionated 12 Gy total body irradiation and chemotherapy as myeloablative conditioning. All patients received standard cyclosporine and methotrexate as a GVHD prophylaxis. The median age was 40 years (range, 19-52 years), the median weight was 56 kg (range, 43-75 kg) , and the median number of cryopreserved nucleated cells was 2.44 x 10 7 /kg (range, 1.71-4.10 x 10 7 /kg) and the median number of cryopreserved CD34 positive cells was 0.85 x 10 5 /kg (range, 0.40-2.14 x 10 5 /kg). 31 patients had myeloid reconstitution and the median time to more than 0.5 x 109/L absolute neutrophil count was 22 days. A self-sustained platelet count more than 50 x 10 9 /L was achieved in 30 patients at a median time of 50 days. Grades III-IV acute GVHD occurred in 5 of 31 evaluable patients and chronic GVHD in 26 of 29 evaluable patients. Among 26 chronic GVHD patients, in 13 patients the disease was extensive. No factor was associated with hematopoietic recovery and the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD. The 5-year cumulative incidence of transplant relatedmortality (TRM) and relapse was 14.5%, 16.6%, respectively. No factor was associated with TRM and relapse. 25 patients are alive and free of disease at between 3.4 and 125 months after transplantation. Median follow-up was 69 months. The probability of event-free survival (EFS) at 5 years was 71.3%. Poor-risk karyotype at diagnosis was signifi cantly associated with worse EFS (p=0.037). Cell dose and HLA matching had no impact on any transplant outcomes. These results suggest that adult MDS patients without suitable related or unrelated bone marrow donors should be considered as candidates for CBT.",

Micallef (1) Advanced age and intensive previous chemotherapy are two independent risk factors that are associated with poor CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The purpose of this report is to evalaute the effi cacy of plerixafor plus G-CSF (G) to G alone in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM) patients >60 years of age undergoing CD34+ HSC mobilization for ASCT. Adult NHL and MM patients requiring ASCT were eligible to participate in a phase III multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled trial. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients participated in study 3101 and MM patients in study 3102. In each of the trials, patients were randomized to receive plerixafor plus G or G plus placebo. All patients received G (10mcg/kg/day) for 4 days; on the evening of day 4 they received either plerixafor (240mcg/ kg) or placebo. Patients underwent apheresis on day 5 after a morning dose of G. Patients continued to receive evening study treatment followed by morning G and apheresis for up to a pre-specifi ed number of apheresis days or until a target number of CD34+ cells/kg were collected. In 3101, the primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved 5x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg in 4 or less apheresis days. In 3102, the primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved 6x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg in 2 or less apheresis days. Of the 298 patients enrolled in study 3101, 124 NHL patients were older than 60 years of age. The primary endpoint in this subgroup of patients was met in 29/57 (50.9%) and 17/67 (25.4%) of the patients in the plerixafor plus G and G plus placebo groups, respectively (p<0.001). Median time to neutrophil engraftment in the plerixafor plus G group was 10 days and 11 days in the G plus placebo group. Median time to platelet engraftment was 20 days and 21 days in the G plus plerixafor and G plus placebo groups, respectively. Of the 302 patients enrolled in study 3102, 145 MM patients were older than 60 years of age. The primary endpoint in this subgroup of MM patients was met in 48/69 (69.6%) and 18/76 (23.7%) of the patients in the plerixafor plus G and G plus placebo groups, respectively (p<0.001). Median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment in both groups was 11 and 18 days, respectively. In these studies, the addition of plerixafor to G in NHL or MM patients greater than 60 years old undergoing ASCT is superior to G alone.",

The one of crucial questions in CBT is whether naivity of lymphocytes could gain antigen-specifi c cellular immunity during early phase of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched transplant. To answer this, we have analyzed the CMV-specifi c immune reconstitution process for fi rst 6 months. Patients and Methods: During 2006 and 2008, 40 adults has received myeloablative regimens including 12 Gy of total body irradiation followed by CBT and a standard cyclosporine and methotrexate combination as GVHD prophylaxis in the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo (IMSUT), for 19 patients and in 9 different facilities which participated for the prospective study using IMSUT regimen for 21 patients. CMV-specifi c CD4+ and CD8+ T cell recoveries were assessed by detection of interferon-gamma (IFN-g) producing cells with CMV antigen stimulation using intracellular cytokine staining or tetramers for CMV pp65 in whom HLA-A0201, -A0206 or -A2402 positive patients. The positive was defi ned as >0.03% IFN-g positive cells among CD4+ or CD8+ T cell population and >0.01% positive in tetramer assay. Results: CMV-reactive (IFN-g positive) CD4+ T cells were detected in 65% at 1 month, 88% at 2 months, 92% at 3 months, 92% at 4 months and 95% at 6 months after CBT which were comparable to CMV-positive age-adjusted healthy control (100%). CMV-reactive (IFN-g positive) and CMV-specifi c (tetramer-positive) CD8+ T cells were detected in 53/5% at 1 month, 71/44% at 2 months, 68/36% at 3 months 75/50% at 4 months, 65/50% at 6 months (39/67% in the control). Next, we looked the effect of HLA disparity (HLA-DR for CD4+ and HLA-A/ -B for CD8+ T cell) in graft-versus-host direction with low resolution typing (LRT) and in high resolution typing (HRT). CMV-reactive CD4+ T cells were detected in 94% with matched (0MM), 81% with one mismatched (1MM) in LRT and 100% with 0MM, 89% with 1MM, 80% with 2MM in HRT at 2 months. CMV-specifi c CD8+ T cells were detected in 33% with 0MM, 38% with 1MM, 56% with 2MM in LRT and 38% with 1MM, 50% with 2MM, 67% with 3MM in HRT at 2 months, respectively. Conclusion: Post-thymic naive T cells in cord blood might obtain memory and effector function in vivo with antigen-specifi c S106 manner during early phase of post-transplant without effect of HLA disparity.",

Imbert-Marcille CHU Hotel-Dieu (Nantes, FR) Herpesvirus infections after cord blood transplant (CBT) in adults have been little studied thus far. To address this issue, we performed a comparison between 15 patients who received a CBT (CBT group) with 40 patients who received an allogeneic transplant from a matched unrelated donor (MUD group) in our centre. The two groups were comparable except for the use of ATG and the median number of CD34+ cells infused and were stringently monitored through CMV, EBV, and HHV6 DNA quantifi cations before and up to 9 months after transplant. An active infection was defi ned by a viral load >3 log/mL of blood or two consecutive PCR between 2 and 3 log/mL. Considering the all cohort, 22, 29 and 29 patients experienced at least one positive PCR for CMV, EBV and HHV6. Incidence of HHV6 infection was signifi cantly higher in the CBT group (80% vs 42.5%, P<0.0001).Incidence of EBV infection was signifi cantly higher in the MUD group (62% vs 27%, P<0.0001). Incidences of CMV were similar between the 2 groups. In multivariate analysis, the use of a CBT and a myeloablative conditioning regimen were found to increase the risk of HHV6 infection (OR=5.4, 95% CI:1.2-23.0; P=0.02; OR=3.5, 95%CI: 1.03-12.05, P= 0.04) while the use of a MUD transplant was found to increase the risk of EBV infection (OR=0.31, 95%CI, 0.07-1.37; P=0.04). HHV6 infection started at a median of 36 days post-transplant in the CBT group vs 58 days in the MUD group (P=NS). In the CBT group, all patients with HHV6 infection (n=12/12, 100%) were still positive at the end of their follow-up (7 patients alive at 9 months post transplant and 5 patients dead before month +9) compared to only 7 out of 17 (41%) in the MUD group (P<0.009). Overall, four patients were still EBV positive at the end of the follow-up (1 patient in the CBT group, and 3 patients in the MUD group, P=NS). Interestingly, the occurrence of HHV6 reactivation translated towards delayed engraftment (median time to neutrophils and platelets recovery: 37 vs 16 days; P=0.03; 98 vs. 12 days; P=0.0001). Overall, these results show that after allogeneic transplant, the pattern of HHV6 and EBV infections is dependant on the source of stem cells. A specifi c relationship is suggested between HHV6 infection and the use of cord blood cells. In addition to a potential delayed engraftment, the clinical implications of the latter fi nding need to be refi ned and prospective screening and antiviral prophylaxis approaches are warranted in the context of CBT.",

Bar, A. Nagler Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Tel Hashomer, IL) Introduction: While umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an attractive source for transplantation, major disadvantage is its relative low number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). One approach thus involves ex-vivo expansion of UCB-derived HSCs. However, the current expansion processes are laborious, expensive and providing unwanted differentiated sub-populations. AIMES. As the ABC transporter Pgp (gene product of ABCB1) is overexpressed in various stem cells relatively to their differentiated progeny, we reasoned that higher Pgp activity in CD133+ HSCs would protect them from the anti-proliferative effect of the Pgp substrate colchicine (COL) and thus could be applicable to their selection and enrichment. Methods: To this end, we isolated CD133+ HSCs from UCB by CD133-immunomagnetic separation (MACS). Pgp-expression level was measured by fl ow cytometry using the Pgp-antibodies MRK-16, and its activity was measured by effl ux assay of the Pgp-substrate Rh123. We further analyzed the relative distribution of various CD133+ subsets during 8 weeks of standard procedure of their expansion, in the absence or the presence of COL. Results: Analyses of freshly isolated CD133+ HSCs indicated that 92% of CD133+ cells express functional Pgp on the cell surface. At 8 weeks of expansion, the CD133+ cell number increased from 105 cells to 0.56\u00b10.19 x10 9 and 1.60\u00b10.41 x10 9 in the absence and the presence of COL, respectively (2.9 \u00b1 0.5 fold increase, n=6). The long exposure of CD133+ HSCs to COL at the expansion process did not affect their ability to form various hematopoietic colonies in semisolid culture after COL removal (Table 1) . Furthermore, FACS analyses indicated that ex-vivo expansion in the presence of COL preferentially enrich the CD133+/Pgp+ subset and specifi cally the CD34+/CD38-HSCs (Figure1). Conclusion: We established a novel expansion approach that specifi cally enriches the CD133+/CD34+/CD38-fraction of UCB-derived HSCs. M. Okas, J. Gertow, O. Ringd\u00e9n, J. Mattsson, M. Uhlin Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, SE) Background: When no HLA-identical donor is available, cord blood transplantation (CBT) is an attractive option due to the rapid availability of the graft and its biological properties. One of the disadvantages associated with CBT is lack of possibility for donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after CBT. Here we report expansion and characterization of CD3 positive lymphocytes from CB grafts in connection to CBT. Material and Methods: Lymphocytes from 13 CB grafts were expanded with CD3/CD28 beads and 200 IU/ml rIL2. Expanded S107 cells were cryopreserved in ready-to-use DLI doses. Immuno phenotyping and cytokine production assay were performed on expanded CB and ex vivo CB as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as controls. T cell receptor spectratyping was performed before and after expansion with aim to determine usage of different TCR Vbeta. Results: T cells have expanded with a median of 148-fold over a period of 8-11 days. Expanded preparations contained 99% of CD3+ cells without signs for signifi cant expansion of CD19+ or CD3-/CD56+ cells. CD4/CD8 ratio of expanded T cells was not altered signifi cantly when compared to CB ex vivo (a mean of 1,7 to 2,02, respectively). Majority of T cells were positive for alpha-beta T cell receptor (93%). Up to 85% of expanded T cells were CD25+, 4% of CD3+ fraction were CD25+/FoxP3+. Expanded T cells, when stimulated with CD3-beads, produced IL-2, IFN-g, TNF-a in a cell to bead ratio in a dose-dependant manner at higher levels, comparaed to peripheral T cells and CB ex vivo T cells. TCR spectratyping has shown a polyclonal pattern of TCR Vbeta-gene usage in the expanded T cell pool. Conclusions: We have successfully set up a clinically feasible system of T cell expansion for use as DLI after CBT. Expansion procedure has not introduced major phenotypic changes to cells when compared to CB cells ex vivo. Expanded cells are functional in terms of cytokine production and display no oligoclonal pattern of TCR usage. Expanded CB T lymphocytes may serve as a possibility for DLI after CBT.",

            "text": "Introduction: Since 2004, our stem cell processing laboratories have routinely checked in vitro viability of CD34+ cells in stem cell harvests, pre and post cryopreservation, using 7 Amino-Actinomycin D (7 AAD). Stem cell harvests from patients (pts) with SA processed by routine methods were associated with poor CD34+ cell viability and recovery post cryo-preservation. This prompted us to investigate the processing method. Methods: Fourteen pts with SA (age 34-67) underwent stem cell harvesting with G-CSF alone or cyclophosphamide + G-CSF. Viability testing was performed within 1 hour of collection on fresh and thawed aliquots of the cryopreserved product using standard ISHAGE gating protocol and single platform methodology. Routine cryopreservation methods used standard procedures for processing with autologous plasma and Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as cryoprotectant. A modifi ed processing method involved immediate centrifugation, plasma removal and resuspension of cells in 4.5% human albumin solution (HAS). Cells were then cryopreserved using standard procedures with 4.5% HAS and DMSO as cryoprotectant. Results: With routine methods, mean pre-cryopreservation viability of harvests of SA pts (n=11) was 98.5% (range 92.9-100%). However, the mean post-thaw viability was only 33% (range 3.8%-100%). The mean percentage recovery of viable CD34+ cells post cryopreservation (n= 12) was 25.8% (range 3.8-58.5%). In comparison, a control group of myeloma pts (n=38), mean pre-cryopreservation viability was 99.1% (range 95.3% to 100%), and mean post-cryopreservation CD34+ cell recovery was 88.1% (range 68%-100%). With the modifi ed method used for harvests of SA pts, post-cryopreservation viability (n=4) was increased to a mean of 83.8% (range 74-93%) and mean recovery of viable CD34+ cells (n=8) was 80.5% (range 54-100%). Discussion: In harvests from pts with SA use of viability testing post-cryopreservation demonstrated increased staining with 7-AAD (up to 97% non-viable) in comparison to myeloma controls (0-32% non-viable). This problem appears to be correctable by immediate plasma depletion and resuspension. The mechanism of reduced viability requires further investigation, but unidentifi ed agents in SA plasma or increased fragility of CD34+ cells in pts with SA may be contributory factors.",

Cornelissen (2) (1)Sanquin Blood Bank (Leiden, NL); (2) Erasmus Medical Centre (Rotterdam, NL); (3)Europdonor Foundation (Leiden, NL) Background: The rate of early (< day 100) infections after myeloablative single umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is high. It is caused by the limited number of hematopoietic stem cells infused, a protracted hematopoietic recovery, and by epithelial barrier disruption caused by myeloablative conditioning. Objective. To evaluate the incidence of early infections and immune reconstitution in adult patients receiving a double UCBT preceded by an non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning regimen. Methods: Patients received a low-dose TBI-based NMA conditioning regimen. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil. All patients received antibacterial (ciprofl oxacin) and antiviral (valaciclovir) prophylaxis. After hematological recovery, prophylaxis for pneumocystis jiroveci and toxoplasmosis was added (cotrimoxazole). Results: 18 double UCBTs were performed in patients with high-risk hematological diseases. Ten patients were CMV-IgG seropositive. The median number of total nucleated cells and total viable CD3+ cells infused was 5,4 x10 7 /kg and 8,92 x10 5 / kg, respectively. To date, the median follow up of survivors is 17 months (4-29). The median time to neutrophil recovery was 28 days. None of the patients developed mucositis. Acute GVHD developed in 6 (grade II: 5, grade III: 1) patients. 1). Febrile neutropenia was observed in 4 patients. In 16 patients reaching neutrophil recovery the following infections were observed during the fi rst 100 days post transplant: EBV reactivation (2), CMV-reactivation (3), central venous catheter associated bacteraemia (4). One patient, on treatment with steroids for acute GVHD, died 6 weeks post transplant due to a human herpes virus 6 infection. One patient died at day 82 due to a candida tropicalis candidemia. Total numbers of CD3+/CD19+ and CD3-/CD16/56+ cells recovered to reference values within 2 months post transplant. To date, reference values of total CD3+ cells, CD3+/CD4+ and CD3+/CD8+ cells have not been reached. Conclusion: These results suggest that the incidence of early severe bacterial infections in patients reaching neutrophil recovery is low after double UCBT preceded by a NMA conditioning regimen. While NK-cell and B-cell recovery was relatively rapid, CD3+ T-cell recovery appeared protracted.",

Somers (1) Background: Compared to single cord blood transplantation (UCBT), double UCBT results in a higher proportion of engraftment in adult patients. Sustained hematopoiesis is usually S108 derived from a single donor, however, the mechanism of predominance of a particular unit has not been unravelled yet. Growth advantage of one of the units, immunological mechanisms or both have been suggested to play a role. Early chimerism studies in leukocyte subpopulations might contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of graft predominance. Objective:To explore the feasibility of using discriminating HLA alloantigen-specifi c monoclonal antibodies (HLA-mAbs) to study chimerism within leukocyte subpopulations in the early period after double UCBT. Materials and methods: Fifteen patients received a double UCBT preceded by a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen. Cord blood units (CBU's) were typed and selected for HLA-A and B loci on serology split level and HLA-DRB1 on high resolution level. The minimal required match grade was 4/6 both between recipient and CBU's and between CBU's. For each case we assessed whether the 3 different parties could theoretically be discriminated with the available HLA-mAbs. In addition, 2 pilot experiments were performed in which chimerism was evaluated in peripheral blood by using fl uorochrome labelled HLA-mAbs and lineage-specifi c mAbs. Analysis was performed at day 11,18,25 and 32 post transplant. Results: Based on the presence of HLA-mismatches between recipient and CBU's, we assessed that the discrimination of the 3 different parties was feasible in 9 of 15 patient-donor combinations (60%). In 6 patients (40%) it was not possible to distinguish all 3 parties due to a lack of discriminating HLAmismatches. In both pilot experiments we were able to identify all 3 parties simultaneously in the total CD45+ fraction and in the different sub-fractions (T-cells, myeloid cells and NK cells) at day 11 post transplant. As from day 18 post transplant a single CBU was predominant in all subpopulations. Results at day 32 corresponded with data of chimerism analysis obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the total mononuclear cell fraction. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the use of HLA-mAbs is a promising method to follow early engraftment kinetics in leukocyte subpopulations in the majority of patients after double UCBT. Its utility can be hampered by the lack of (serologically detectable) HLA mismatches in individual patients.",

Shaughnessy (1) Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been demonstrated to be a potentially curative therapy for a variety of hematological malignancies. Successful ASCT is dependent on harvesting suffi cient CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to ensure prompt and durable engraftment. The inability to mobilize adequate number of CD34+ HSC using chemotherapy in conjunction with cytokines ranges from 5.9%-18% in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and 4.2%-30% in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's disease (HD). The aim of this report is to evaluate the effect of plerixafor + G-CSF (G) among patients that previously failed to mobilize enough CD34+ HSC with chemotherapy and G. Patients enrolled in the plerixafor compassionate use program (CUP) who had documented failure to harvest adequate CD34+ HSC with prior chemomobilization were included in this analysis. Mobilization failure was defi ned as the inability to collect 2x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg or inability to achieve \u2265 10 CD34+ cells/ ul without having undergone apheresis. The CUP mobilization regimen consisted of G (10 mcg/kg) for 4 consecutive days. On the evening of day 4, plerixafor (240 mcg/kg) was administered. On day 5, G (10 mcg/kg) was administered followed by apheresis. This regimen of G, plerixafor and apheresis was continued until the patient collected \u2265 2x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. A total of 286 patients (164 NHL, 35 HD, 87 MM) were included in this analysis. The mean age was 54.9 \u00b1 13.4 years. Administration of G plus plerixafor resulted in a median CD34+ cells/kg collection of 2.52x10 6 , 2.31x10 6 and 3.52x10 6 in NHL, HD and MM patients, respectively. The proportion of patients with NHL, HD and MM that collected \u2265 2x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg were 67.1%, 65.7% and 81.0%, respectively. The proportion of patients that proceeded to transplant were: 65.2%, 68.6% and 65.5% in NHL, HD and MM, respectively. A median of 3x106 CD34+ cells/kg were infused in all patients in this cohort. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 11 days, 12 days and 12 days in NHL, HD and MM, respectfully. Median time to platelet engraftment was 21 days, 19 days and 21 days in NHL, HD and MM, respectfully. These data demonstrate that G plus plerixafor mobilized adequate CD34+ HSC in the majority of patients who failed chemotherapy and growth factor mobilization. Plerixafor made it possible for these patients to receive potentially curative therapy.",

However there are other stem cells ie mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the marrow (BM)and peripheral blood(PB) products. The MSCs are a source of HSC and known to be immunosuppressants . The aim of this prospective study is to quantitate the MSC in the products used for SCT and to analyze their impact on graft versus host disease(GVHD) and engraftment kinetics. Method: BM or PB samples collected for SCT were analysed for their CD34+ (ISHAGE protocol) and MSC quantity by fl ow cytometry using the CD45, CD34,CD73, CD90, Stro-1, CD105, CD29,CD44 and HLA-DR antibodies. Patient and Donors: 20 patients (aged 2 mo-50 y) diagnosed to have hematological malignacies or bone marrow failure syndromes received grafts (BM:13, PB:7) from healthy donors (gender missmatched 30% and aged 2-54 y). Two patients had not received their grafts at the time of analysis. Engraftment (median)occurred on day 15(neutrophil) and 18 (platelet) in PBSCTl patients 2 days shorter than following BMT. Results: BM MSC content (median: 0.15 (0.01-0.6 10 6 /kg) was higher than PB (median: 0,057 10 6 /kg) and 1 log less than BM HSC count . Pearson regression analysis showed a correlation between TNC and CD34 or MSC counts (r=0.71 or 0.51, p=0.003 or 0.038, respectively). There was no correlation between MSC and CD34 counts. Table 1 summarizes the MSC or TNC contents among early or late engraftmenters. Table 2 compares the SC and CD3 cell counts in regard to aGVHD. Conclusions: This preliminary analysis is the fi rst report analysing the role of graft MSC content in clinical transplantation . Although statistically not signifi cant, MSC counts were higher in BM vs PB grafts. BM MSC content is comparable to values used in MSC therapy in human trials. TNC counts correlated with MSC and HSC counts. HSC counts did not predict MSC content. Faster neutrophil recovery was associated with a tendency to result from grafts, regardless of stem cell source. containing more MSCs. CD3 content was a stronger determinant of GVHD prediction compared to MSC or CD34. However since PBSCT usually results with faster engraftment and more frequent GVHD compared to BMT, more data is required to be able to analyze multiple factors simultaneously. We conclude that signifi cant amounts of MSCs are transfused with clinical BMT. MSC content analysis may be essential in future studies where engrafment kinetics and GVHD are addressed.",

According to JACIE standard, the quality controls (QC) for evaluating the effi ciency of CBU before the recruitment include viability and CFU tests. Objectives: Aim of our study was to evaluate the sensibility of QC, performed on pilot vial/fragment before CBU formal recruitment, as cell dose, clonogenic test and viability in order to defi ne the predictive parameters for the graft. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 48 unrelated Cord Blood Transplant (CBT) performed with 52 CBU (4 double transplants) at Rome Transplant Network (RTN) from September 2005 to September 2008. Patients underwent unrelated CBT for malignant (n=45) or non malignant diseases (n=3) either in 1st/2nd complete remission (n=18/11) or in advanced disease (n=19). Median patient age and body weight were 20.4 years (0.6-60) and 50.5 kg (4 -96), respectively. The CBU were HLA matched in 4 cases and mismatched for 1 (n=12) or 2 HLA loci (n=36) in 48 cases. According to RTN policy, CBU selection was based on the following pre-freezing parameters: NC dose > 2.5 x 10 7 /kg, HLA compatibility >4/6 loci, CD34+cells >1x10 5 /kg, CFU-GM >1x10 4 /kg and AB0 matching.

            "text": "Results Our analysis has shown a signifi cant relationship between the QC performed on a thawed fragment and the values both pre-freezing and at infusion of CBU, in terms of NC (p<0.01), CD34 (p<0.01) and CFU-GM (p<0.05), whereas no signifi cant correlation has been found for viability. The median time between CBU freezing and thawing was 5.2 years (0.26-9.04) and did not affect the NC, CD34+ and CFU-GM recovery. The viability of CBU at infusion signifi cantly correlates with the speed of engraftment for PLTS (p=0.005). Conclusions: From this study we can draw the following preliminary conclusions: 1) QC in terms of cell dose recovery and clonogenic assay are predictive for the values at infusion and refl ect the safety of cryopreservation procedure; 2) the viability of cells at infusion is related to the speed of PLTS engraftment; 3) CD 34+ and CFU-GM results of QC, performed on a thawed fragment, may replace pre-freezing missing data. Neutrophils engraftment kinetics is a key issue in Cord blood transplantations (CBT). By using double unit CB (DCB) suffi cient number of nucleated cells could be given for adults. We compared the engraftment kinetics in DCB versus single CB transplantations. Thirty eight patients (pts)underwent CBTs. Median age was 6 years (6 weeks -65 years). Thirty patients were children and eight were adults. Twenty three were males and 15 were females. Nineteen had hematological malignancies -Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia -7, Acute Meyeloid Leukemia -6, Juvenile Meyelomonocytic Leukemia -2, Meyelodysplastic syndromes -2, Biphenotypic Leukemia -1, and Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma -1. Nineteen had non malignant diseases -bone marrow failure syndromes -5, immune defi ciencies syndromes -5, metabolic diseases -4, hemoglobinopathies -3, and histiocytic disorders -2. Conditioning regimens were based on I.V. Busulfan (22), Fludarabine (9) and total body irradiation (6), or no conditioning (1) . Nine pts received DCB. CB units were from matched related donors in 12, and unrelated donors in 26 pts. Of the unrelated single CB units -in 6, 9 and 2 pts there were 6/6, 5/6 and 4/6 antigens matching, respectively. Of the nine DCB transplantations the recipient-donor matching was-6/6,5/6 -1, 5/6,4/6 -1, 4/6,4/6 -4, and 4/6,3/6 -2, and 3/6,3/6 -1. Median nucleated cells dose was 4.35X10 7 (0.65-50) cells/kg. RESULTS -Median follow up was 28 months (CI 95% 3-141). Cumulative incidence of neutrophils engraftment was 75% (CI 95% 62-91). Ten pts did not engraft (7 of them died). Median day of platelets engraftment was 34 (14-126). Cumulative incidence of acute and chronic graft versus host disease was 16% (CI 95% 8-34) and 19% (CI 95% 10-38) respectively. TRM cumulative incidence was 32% (CI 95% 20-53). The probability of survival was 62% (CI 95% 46-79). Cumulative incidence of disease free survival was 49% (CI 95% 32-66) . Analysis of engraftment kinetics of the twenty nine pediatric pts who received single CB units, versus the 9 adults that underwent DCB transplantations revealed that it was similar (fi gure). Median day of engraftment was 22 and 23.5 in the single CB and DCB, respectively. Similar engraftment kinetics of DCB in adults and single CB transplantations in children should encourage clinicians to consider CB as an alternative source for a graft in adults with hematological malignancies that are in need of transplantations and do not have an HLA compatible donor.",

            "text": "Cord blood stem cells enumerated using 7-AAD modifi ed ISHAGE guidelines may contain signifi cant numbers of non-viable (apoptotic) cells R.C Duggleby (1) One of the primary determinants of engraftment, independent of genetic matching, has been demonstrated to be the dose of viable stems cells that is transplanted. There is now evidence that cellular viability predicts the speed of neutrophil and platelet engraftment and overall survival. Currently the best measure of stem cell viability is the colony forming unit assay (CFU). Unfortunately CFU assays require 10-14 days of incubation making them impractical as a releasing test for the assessment of cryopreserved cord units in a clinical setting. In addition, there is only a weak association between CFU and CD34 numbers resulting in low clonogenic effi ciencies. This suggests that signifi cant numbers of CD34+ cells are not forming colonies. ISHAGE guidelines use CD45, CD34 and 7-AAD to determine stem cell content. We hypothesize that there are potentially large numbers of apoptotic cells present in the CD34+CD45low7-AAD-population; explaining the low clonal effi ciency in some samples. Methods: Whole cord blood units and mononuclear cell isolations, (cryopreserved and stored at 4\u00b0C) were assessed for absolute CD34+ cell numbers using the ISAGE guidelines and qualitatively with an additional annexin V labeling step; the viable stem cell number was assessed by CFU assay. Results: Many samples showed signifi cant evidence of apoptic cells present in the CD34+CD45low7AAD-gated population. Consequently whilst the CFU increased with increased CD34+ dose there is a good association with live (Annexin V-) CD34+ numbers (Pearson correlation R\u00b2=0.8). Conclusion: Live cell assessment by this method will enable the CFU to be predicted allowing a rapid enumeration, post-thaw, of the viable stem cells present in a cord unit. This would be an attractive releasing test for cord blood selection. We are currently assessing the impact of time and temperature to optimize the storage and handling of cord blood units.",

For UCB transplantation the total nucleated cells (TNC) and CD34+ cells greatly infl uence transplant outcome. UCB banks perform a white cell enrichment and red cell depletion prior to cryopreservation in order to decrease the stored product volumes. Various techniques have been evaluated in a restricted number of products; however the effi cacy of volume reduction under routine laboratory conditions is lacking. We report on the results of 1280 UCB processed in two banks using the same device and compare them with the manufacturer's qualifi cation reports. Materials and methods: 1280 units were processed between 1994 and 2008, 456 in centre 1 and 856 in centre 2 using a Sepax \u00ae S-100 device (Biosafe, Eysins, Switzerland) piloted by proprietary software (version 1.17 to 264), according to the manufacturer's instructions. UCB were collected in 5 different maternity wards and processed within 36 hours after collection. TNC and CD34+ counts were performed before and after volume reduction using standardized counting methods. Results: Median volume obtained immediately after processing was 21% of the initial volume (10th/90th percentile 15/29%). Median TNC and CD34+ cell recoveries were 76% (10th/90th percentile 63/86%) and 81% (10th/90th percentile 64/95%) respectively in both sites, whereas the device qualifi cation report proposes 88% and 96% for TNC and CD34+ cell recovery respectively (p<0.0001 for each value according to one sample T-test). The recovery rates were stable over time in both laboratories. Red cell depletion data were only available from centre 1 and corresponded to a median of 25% (10th/90th percentile 10/44%) retained RBC. Conclusions: Volume reduction of UCB with the Sepax\u00ae device provides a satisfactory TNC and CD34+ cell recovery in a routine setting. The TNC and CD34+ cell counts after volume reduction are however inferior than these expected by the manufacturer. The stability of the cell recovery over time in both UBC banks excludes the contribution of a learning effect. Preprocessing factors including the delay between collection and processing could be involved and have to be evaluated in the future. These data demonstrate that stem cell processing within a routine setting may provide relevant differences compared to data obtained within study conditions.",

Budakoglu Gulhane Medical Academy (Ankara, TR) Background: 10 microg/kg/day of fi lgrastim and lenograstim have been recommended for mobilization of CD34+ cells without associated chemotherapy. However, in our previous randomized study we demonstrated that a 7.5 microg/kg/day dose of lenograstim has been as effi cacious as 10 microg/kg/day of fi lgrastim. In this study, we investigated whether a reduced dose of lenograstim is equavalent to standard dose for autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization and transplantation. Material and method: A total of 49 consecutive patients were randomized to either low dose (7.5 microg/kg/day, n = 24) or standard dose (10 microg/kg/day, n = 25) of lenograstim. These two groups were similar in regard to disease, sex, body weight, body surface area, conditioning regimens, previous chemotherapy cycles and radiotherapy. Each dose of lenograstim was administered for 4 consecutive days. The fi rst PBSC apheresis was done on the 5th day. In the posttransplant period, lenograstim was given at 5 microg/kg/day until leukocyte engraftment. Results: Successful mobilization with the fi rst apheresis, was achieved in 10/24 (42%) patients in low dose group versus 14/25 (56%) patients in standard dose group. No signifi cant difference was seen in the median number of CD34+cells mobilized, as well as the median number of apheresis, median volume of apheresis, percentage of CD34+ cells, and CD34+ cell number. Leukocyte and platelet engraftments, the number of days requiring G-CSF and parenteral antibiotics, the number of transfusions were similar in both groups in the posttransplant period. Lenograstim 7.5 microg/kg/day is as effi cious as Lenograstim 10 microg/kg/day for autologous PBSC mobilization and transplantation.",

Salvaneschi (1) (1)IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo (Pavia, IT); (2) Hospital of Voghera (Voghera, IT) Cord blood (CB) use for unrelated stem cell transplantation is constantly encouraged by CB Banks spreading worldwide. Microbial contamination of the graft may cause severe clinical complications in immunosuppressed recipients; moreover central venous catheters may further enhance the risk of systemic infections. Despite accurate disinfection protocols, CB might be contaminated with bacteria at several steps from collection to cryopreservation. This is the reason why sterility still represents a major concern. All the more so because a rigorous policy of quality is essential for cell therapy protocols such as CB ex vivo expansion. Here we retrospectively reviewed the data of microbial contamination at our CB Bank in Pavia over 10 years activity. From 1997, 3025 units have been cryopreserved. Sterility testing was always performed at the end of manipulation before cryopreservation by inoculating a 2 ml sample into 30 ml media (BacT/ALERT FA/FN, Biom\u00e9rieux Inc., Durham, North Carolina, USA) to detect both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. After 14 days incubation at 37\u00baC, positive cultures were subcultured to identify the bacterial species. The corresponding antibiotic sensitivity was also assessed. All contaminated CB units were removed from the inventory and discarded. 75/3025 units resulted positive, the overall contamination rate being 2.3%. A single contaminant was demonstrated in 97.3% of positive units (73/75). The list of pathogens species isolated by subcultures is provided in the table. Post-thawing sterility testing resulted positive for 13/21 units (62%), confi rming the same species as previously detected on the fresh sample. The trend of bacterial contamination was analysed over the years (see the graphic), showing a percentage of positive detections stably under 3%, except of two spikes in 1997 and 2001. In conclusion, our review over 10 years of banking activity demonstrated the importance of constantly monitoring sterility as indicator of CB quality and one personnel performance maintenance. Despite very low incidence of contamination on average, it appeared to be primarily due to skin fl ora and contaminants at site of withdrawal. Finally, multiple resistance to antibiotics together with the ability to survive after cryopreservation and storage at -190\u00b0C, as shown for several pathogens, suggested the decision of promptly discarding any contaminated unit to be still essential for quality assurance of the stem cell product.",

Genovese, C. Del Fante, G. Viarengo, C. Perotti, L. Salvaneschi IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo (Pavia, IT) Microbial contamination of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) products is a potential source of systemic infections following transplantation causing severe clinical complications in immunosuppressed recipients. Several factors involving the patient, the collection facility and the cryopreservation laboratory may affect the risk of contaminating a PBSC product. Here we report the data recorded at our Apheresis Unit in Pavia, Italy. During 2001-2007 we have cryopreserved 375 autologous leukapheresis. All PBSC collections were obtained at our center, the patients coming from 5 distinct Transplant Centers. Sterility testing was performed at the end of manipulation before cryopreservation by inoculating 2 ml into 30 ml media (BacT/ALERT FA/FN, Biom\u00e9rieux Inc.) to detect both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. After 14 days incubation at 37\u00b0C, positive cultures were subcultured to identify the pathogen specie. The corresponding antibiotic sensitivity was also assessed. For each contaminated leukapheresis, one cryovial was thawed to repeat sterility testing. 24/375 PBSC products resulted positive, the overall contamination rate being 6.4%. A single micro-organism was demonstrated in all cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis being isolated in 83.3% of positive units. In case of multiple PBSC collections from the same patient, the same pathogen was found in all products. Post-thawing testing resulted positive for 13/24 units (54.2%), confi rming the same species as detected on the fresh sample in all cases except one. 12/24 positive leukapheresis was infused to the patient with concomitant administration of specifi c antibiotics as by the antibiotic sensitivity report. No sepsis was documented. The trend of bacterial contamination over the years is depicted in the graphic. One of 5 Institutions (TC no.1) accounted for about 63% of all positive results, as detailed in the table. A catheter in the jugular vein was present for all patients of TC no.1. Moreover 25% of collections for TC no.1 were found positive. In our experience, contamination appeared to be primarily due to skin fl ora contaminants at site of withdrawal, suggesting to implement disinfection protocols. In certain conditions, catheters enhance the risk of contamination. Anyway, despite multi-drug resistance and the ability to survive after cryopreservation and storage at -190\u00b0C, the administration of contaminated PBSC appeared feasible and uncomplicated if appropriate antibiotics are administered.",

Gabriel, J. Sharon-Richman, E. Olavarria, A. Rahemtulla, E. Kanfer, D. Marin, D. Milojkovic, K. Rezvani, D. MacDonald, R. Szydlo, J. Apperley Imperial College NHS Trust (London, UK) ASCT remains standard consolidation therapy for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and chemosensitive relapsed lymphoma (r-Ly). Peripheral blood as a source of stem cells (PBSC) has largely replaced marrow with the advantage of improved engraftment rates. PBSC are routinely collected following administration of chemotherapy in combination with GCSF. However, the resultant pancytopenia poses signifi cant risk to patients and additional chemotherapy prior to ASCT may lead to increased end organ damage potentially precluding future therapies. Novel agents can achieve PBSC mobilisation without the use of cytotoxics. In the advent of such drugs, we reviewed the effi cacy of, and complications during PBSC mobilisation. We also analysed the cost implications of adverse events. Of 151 consecutive attempts, 13.2% failed to reach our criteria in order to attempt pheresis (1x10 4 CD34 cells/ml. Of those achieving target and undergoing pheresis, 6% did not achieve an adequate cell dose for future ASCT (2x10 6 CD34+cells/kg) an overall failure rate of 19.2%. Furthermore 17.9% failed to harvest our ideal of 4x10 6 /kg (permitting >1 ASCT procedure). Factors contributing to failure in achieving target CD34+ve PB count on univariate analysis were; >2 lines of previous chemotherapy and occurrence of neutropenic sepsis(p=0.002, and p=0.005. These factors remained signifi cant on multivariate analysis (RR:4.4 and 6.2). These factors also affected CD34+ cell yield on both univariate and multivariate analysis (RR: 3.3 and 4.6). No differences were seen between MM and r-Ly. Overall, the complication rate was 34.4%,24.1% of patients suffering NS requiring admission. The mortality rate was 1.3% (NS and intra-cranial bleed). Of those developing NS, only 52% harvested suffi cient cells, but with a median delay of 3 days. The median cost of PBSC collection was E12720.6 (E1448.30-E28802). NS signifi cantly increased the cost of mobilisation; median cost of E18686.2 vs E12069.7 (p\u22640.0001). Conclusion: Our results suggest that potential candidates for ASCT should be harvested as near to achieving remission to prevent failure following additional therapy upon relapse. 1/5 patients will fail. The risks associated with current mobilisation protocols are substantial, and also impact greatly on cost. Therefore these data suggest that transplant centres should consider the use of non-myelosuppressive agents either in place of, or as a dose reduction strategy for autologous stem cell procurement.",

Leith\u00e4user, C. Grosse-Thie, I. Hilgendorf, C. Kahl, G. Kundt, M. Freund, C. Junghanss University of Rostock (Rostock, DE) Introduction: In autologous hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) a minimum stem cell dose of 2 x 10 6 CD34 + cells per kg body weight is needed to ensure engraftment. With commonly used Cyclophosphamide-based mobilizing regimens a proportion of 10-20% of patients fail to mobilize suffi cient stem cell numbers. Here we report on effi ciency of Etoposide phosphate/ G-CSF as a mobilization regimen with an acceptable toxicity profi le and HSC yields. Patients and methods: Data from 66 consecutive patients (mean age 51 years (18-73)) receiving high dose etoposide phosphate (2000 mg/m\u00b2; 22h c.i.; day 1) and G-CSF (10\u00b5g/kg s.c.; starting day 3) for HSC mobilization between 1997 and 2006 at our institution were analysed retrospectively. The study population consisted of patients who had already failed to mobilize suffi cient stem cell numbers on previous protocols or were not considered eligible for more intense mobilization protocols. CD34 + cells in the peripheral blood were monitored daily after leucocyte recovery over 1 Gpt/l and stem cell harvest was started as soon as the the CD34 cell count reached 10 /\u00b5l. A threshhold of 2 x 10 6 CD34 + cells/ kg body weight was defi ned as successful mobilization. Results: In total 47 patients (72.2%) mobilized suffi cient stem cell numbers with a mean number of 1.76 aphereses and a mean stem cell yield of 14.1 CD34+ cells/kg body weight. In patients with previous mobilization failures who constituted 47% of the cohort (31/66) a suffi cient stem cell yield was obtained in 52%. Previous mobilization failure was the strongest negative predictive factor for insuffi cient stem cell harvest. Hematologic toxicity was moderate: mean time of leukopenia (defi ned as < 1Gpt/l) was 3.9 days (0-22) and neutropenia (< 0.5 Gpt/l) of 4.8 days (0-16). The rate of neutropenic fever was as high as 47% but clinically well manageable. Discussion: In this study group of mainly elderly, often comorbid patients with a signifi cant proportion of prior mobilization failures Etoposide phosphate is a generally well tolerated mobilization agent with promising stem cell yields and should be considered as a salvage mobilization regimen after mobilization failure or as a fi rst line strategy in elderly and comorbid patients.",

Gordon (1) , P.R.E. Johnson (2) , P.H. Roddie (2) , P.C.A. Shepherd (2) The small molecule chemokine inhibitor Plerixafor has recently been used on a named-patient basis for PBSC mobilisation from patients failing to mobilise by conventional means. We present our initial experience with plerixafor in 18 mobilisation attempts in 17 patients, all of whom had previously failed to mobilise a transplantable PBSC dose, at three Scottish transplant centres. Patients had myeloma (n=10) or lymphoma (n=7). All had at least one previous attempt at PBSC mobilisation which failed or resulted in an insuffi cient cell dose for transplant (2 attempts in 2 patients). 5 of 17 patients had a pre-existing CD34+ dose from previous collections (range 0.98-2.32 x 10 6 /kg; median 1.38); 12 patients had no cells collected before receiving plerixafor. As recommended by Genzyme, patients received four days of G-CSF 10 micrograms/kg followed by Plerixafor 240 micrograms/kg subcutaneously in the evening, 11 hours prior to fi rst apheresis, except for one patient with dialysis-dependent renal failure who received 160 micrograms/kg. G-CSF and plerixafor were repeated daily until a transplantable CD34+ dose was obtained (if possible). Apheresis was started without waiting for a day-of-collection peripheral CD34+ count. For patients with a peripheral CD34+count of less than 20/microlitre, 3 (rather than 2) blood volumes were processed. 16 of 17 patients achieved a transplantable PBSC dose (>2.5 x 10 6 /kg CD34+ cells) after one (n=15) or two (n=1) courses of Plerixafor -a total success rate of 94%. The total number of apheresis procedures required was 1 (n=4), 2 (n=6), 3 (n=4) or 4 (n=2). One patient mobilised a cell dose of 1.89 x 10 6 /kg in two procedures, but was unable to receive a third Plerixafor dose due to diarrhoea (a recognised side-effect) -a second treatment cycle one month later with antidiarrhoeal cover was successful. One patient was unable to undergo PBSC collection because of intercurrent infection (not thought to be plerixafor-related). No other immediate toxicities were seen. 7 patients have progressed to transplant. Median cell dose transplanted was 3.39, range 2.68 -4.72. All seven patients have achieved sustained neutrophil and platelet engraftment (median 14 days to neutrophils >0.5; median 21 days to neutrophils >1.0; median 24 days to platelets >50). Plerixafor appears highly effective in the mobilisation of PBSC for transplant from patients failing to mobilise by conventional means, with generally acceptable toxicity.",

Nikiforakis Evangelismos Hospital (Athens, GR) Umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is associated with delayed immune reconstitution compared to bone marrow or peripheral blood transplantation, especially in adult recipients. UCBT with 2 partially matched units is increasingly utilized as a means to increase probability of engraftment in this patient population. Nevertheless, data on immune reconstitution with double UCBT are still scarce. We monitored reconstitution of cellular and humoral immunity in 16 consecutive patients, who underwent double UCBT at our center and achieved sustained donor engraftment. Patients received UCBT for high-risk acute leukemia at a median age of 34 years (range, 16-60). The majority of units (26/32) were 4/6 matched to recipient at HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1. The conditioning regimen was ablative in 11, and non-myeloablative in 5 cases. Only 1 patient received ATG. Cyclosporine plus mycophenolate was used as acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Intravenous immunoglobulin was not routinely administered, unless clinically required. Median nucleated and CD34+ cell doses at infusion were 4.2 x 10 7 /kg (range, 2.6-5.4) and 1.35 x 10 5 /kg (range, 0.6-1.98). Neutrophil engraftment was achieved at a median of 19 days. Fifteen patients developed acute GVHD (grade II: 12, grade III-IV: 3). Extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 2 patients. Immunoglobulin concentrations and absolute counts of B, NK, and T lymphocytes were assessed at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months post transplant. Median values of IgG at the above time points were 961, 353, 382, 384, 973, and 1300 mg/dl, respectively. The absolute counts of NK lymphocytes reached normal values from the fi rst month (median count, 135/uL). By contrast, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells remained lower than normal for the entire follow-up period (median counts at 18 months, 233/uL and 488/uL, respectively). CD19+ cell counts were also subnormal by 9 months, but recovered rapidly thereafter (median counts at 9 and 12 months, 82/uL and 784/uL, respectively). The relative percentage of naive helper T cells (CD4+/CD45RA+) increased marginally over 30% at 18 months. CMV infection was detected in 7 of 11 seropositive patients. In addition, 4 patients developed HHV-6 reactivation, and 2 EBV-related lymphoproliferation. In conclusion, immune reconstitution is considerably impaired after double UCBT in adult patients. This could be attributed not only to graft source but also to the increased incidence of acute GVHD and treatment with steroids.",

Stiff (1), I.N. Micallef (2) , A.P. Nademanee (3) The impact of transplanted CD34+ cell dose on clinical outcomes remains controversial. The purpose of this post-hoc analysis was to examine the relationship between CD34+ cell dose transplanted and platelet, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts at 100 days, 6, and 12 months following autologous transplantation in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM). Data were obtained from two phase 3 clinical studies that compared the safety and effi cacy of plerixafor and G-CSF (G) to placebo and G in mobilization of hematopoietic blood stem cells for autologous transplantation in NHL and MM patients. The details of the study designs and preliminary safety and effi cacy outcomes have been reported (DiPersio, ASH 2007) . The following data were obtained from the two clinical studies: number of CD34+ cells transplanted (fi rst transplant only), absolute neutrophil, platelet, red blood cell, and lymphocyte counts at 100 days, 6, and 12 months post-transplant. The proportions of patients who had platelet \u2265150 x 10 9 /L or neutrophil \u22652.5 x 10 9 /L or lymphocyte \u22650.5 x 10 9 /L at 100 days, 6, and 12 months were compared among these transplanted CD34+ cell dose categories regardless of mobilization treatment: 2-4x10 6 cells/kg, >4-6x10 6 cells/kg, and >6x10 6 cells/kg. Two separate analyses were performed, one for NHL and one for MM patients. For the NHL study, 135/150 (90.0%) patients in the plerixafor group underwent transplantation after initial mobilization compared with 82/148 (55.4%) patients in the placebo group, p<0.001. For the MM study, 142/148 (95.9%) patients in the plerixafor group and 136/154 (88.3%) patients in the placebo group underwent transplantation. A signifi cant linear trend with increasing proportion of patients with platelet count \u2265150 x10 9 /L with increasing transplanted cell dose categories was observed at 100 days, 6, and 12 months for NHL patients and at 100 days for MM patients (Table 1 ). There were no apparent signifi cant relationships between transplanted cell dose categories and other hematopoietic parameters. These ad hoc analyses confi rm previous reports that transplanted cell dose is associated with better long-term platelet recovery. Due to the small sample size in each transplanted cell dose category and the nature of the analyses, further studies are warranted to determine if cell dose has an effect on transfusions, resource utilization and long-term survival.",

Fowler (1) Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) can be a curative procedure for a variety of hematological malignancies. A number of patients fail to mobilize adequate number of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), thereby precluding ASCT. The purpose of this report is to assess the effi cacy of plerixafor plus G-CSF (G) in patients that previously failed to mobilize suffi cient PBSC. Patients meeting the criteria for the compassionate use protocol (CUP) using plerixafor plus G were included in this analysis. Participants were eligible for the protocol if they had failed to collect enough CD34+ cells with a traditional mobilization regimen. Remobilization consisted of G at 10mcg/kg/day administered on days 1-4 plus plerixafor 240 mcg/kg/day on the evening of day 4. G-CSF 10mcg/kg was administered on day 5, one hour before apheresis. If multiple days of collection were necessary, the aforementioned combination regimen was repeated. Twenty patients, 15 men and fi ve women, with a median age of 58 years were enrolled. Patients had the following malignancies: multiple myeloma (n=6), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=10), Hodgkin's disease (n=2), angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (n=1) and amyloidosis (n=1) . Majority of the patients received cytokines only (n=15) as the initial mobilization regimen. Initial mobilization attempt in this cohort yielded a median of 0.21 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg (range 0-1.8 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg) in 2 (range 0-4) apheresis days. Eighteen of 20 patients who were mobilized with plerixafor plus G were able to collect suffi cient PBSC to proceed to ASCT. Among patients who were initially mobilized with cytokine only, plerixafor plus G resulted in a median 3.7 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg (range 2-7.9 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg) in 2 apheresis days; among patients who were initially chemomobilized, plerixafor plus G yielded 4 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/ kg (range 2.5-6.2 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg) in 2 apheresis days. Median time to neutrophil engraftment was day 14 (range 10-21 days) and platelet engraftment was day 25 (range 13-38 days). These data demonstrate that plerixafor plus G is effective among patients who previously failed traditional mobilization regimens. In those patients eligible for ASCT who have failed prior mobilization attempts, plerixafor can provide an opportunity to still pursue a potentially curative procedure.",

In 45/73 (62%), previous mobilisation attempts had been inadequate for ASCT. Of these, 33/45 had received cyclophosphamide+G-CSF and 11 had received single agent G-CSF at 10mcg/kg. Results: HD G-CSF was administered for 4 days in all pts. 31/73 (43%) pts achieved the target cumulative dose of 2.5 x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg after HD G-CSF. Additional 17/73 (23%) pts achieved the cumulative target dose when combined with previous mobilisation episodes. 9 patients who did not reach the CD34+ threshold of \u22650.01x10 9 /L were not harvested. 13/45 pts (29%) had a successful yield having failed other forms of mobilisation. Ultimately, 31 patients proceeded to ASCT with the median time to neutrophil engraftment (\u22650.5 x10 9 /L) of 14 days (range 10-29) and the median time to platelet engraftment (\u226520 x10 9 /L) of 21 days (range 12-60). There were no discontinuations or dose reductions with the higher doses of G-CSF and no unexpected toxicity was reported. Conclusion: The use of HD G-CSF for HSC mobilisation is effective and well tolerated. HD G-CSF may be considered in heavily pre-treated patients and those who mobilised sub-optimally with other regimens, enabling a majority (66% in this series) to be considered for ASCT. Other advantages include avoidance of myelosuppressive chemotherapy, as well as outpatient selfadministration and fi xed-day apheresis scheduling.",

Mattsson Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, SE) Umbilical cord blood is increasingly used as a source of stem cells in allogeneic stem cell transplantation due to it's na\u00efve cell content and high permissiveness for HLA-mismatch. To overcome problems of limited cell numbers, double cord blood transplantation (DCBT) has proven both safe and effi cacious. Concerning chimerism analysis after DCBT, previous studies have indicated single unit predominance early after DCBT. In the present study we evaluated the chimeric pattern in T-, B-and myeloid cells using PCR based chimerism analysis in patients after DCBT. Of the seven patients included in this study, fi ve had acute leukemia and two patients had lymphoma. Five patients received myeloablative conditioning and two patients were given reduced intensity conditioning. Interestingly, three patients showed mixed donor chimerism in all cell lineages at 100 days post-transplantation, and two of them still at 25 and 29 months after DCBT, respectively. These two patients are doing clinically well, with no infectious complications or signs of relapse, and neither of them developed acute GVHD after DCBT. All patients received high dose antithymocyte globulin (ATG) before DCBT, which could be an explanation for an increased tolerance between the cord blood units. Immunological studies revealed phenotypic differences between the two cord blood units. Among other things, antigen presenting cells and T cells of memory phenotype predominated in one cord blood unit, whereas natural killer cells were found in higher frequencies in the other unit.",

Popova, N. Mikhaylova, L. Zubarovskaya, B. Afanasyev Pavlov's State Medical University (St. Petersburg, RU) Background: Haemopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation has been widely performed to support high-dose chemotherapy in haematological malignancies. In lymphoid malignancies, autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the treatment frequently employed in relapsed malignant lymphomas (ML) or in very high-risk ML. A total of 10-12% of patients with ML do not reach the minimum threshold of 2 x 10 6 CD34+ collected cells/kg and are considered poor mobilizers. Patients and methods: We analysed data on 64 patients witn malignant lymphomas to whom mobilization and apheresis of HSC were performed in our clinic from January 2002 to September 2006. 9 patients failed mobilization Hodgkin's disease (n=5), non-Hodgkin lymphomas (n=4)). All with advanced stage disease, previously received multiple courses of chemoand radiotherapy and failed stem cell mobilization using G-CSF alone and were considered as poor mobilizers (average number of CD34+ collected cells/kg 1.1 x 10 6 ). DHAP (cisplatin, Ara-C, dexamethazone) and pegfi lgrastim on D+1 after the end of chemotherarpy were used for remobilization. Mobilization was successful when there were more than 2.0 x 106 CD34+/kg in the fi nal product. PBPC were collected with a continuous-fl ow blood cell separator (Fenwal CS3000 plus, Baxter healthcare, Deerfi eld, IL, USA). Each apheresis procedure was performed for approximately 2 to 4 h, processing 10-14 l of whole blood volume. The total CD34+ count of the leukapheresis product were monitored daily following each collection. Results: A total of 21 mobilization cycles were performed. The average number of CD34+/kg during one cycle was 1.1 x 106. 1 patient (12%) was successful during the fi rst mobilization cycle. 3 patients (37%) were successful on a second cycle and 1 patient (12%) on a third cycle. Four patients (40%) failed remobilization and didn't reach the fi nal target. During treatment we observed mild hematological toxicity -thrombocytopenia grade III (6 patients), anemia grade III (4 patients) (CIC AE). There were no infectious complications and no signs of any other toxicity. The only grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity directly related to pegfi lgrastim was bone pain. Conclusions: Mobilization with DHAP and pegfi lgrastim seems to be effective, well tolerared and less toxic than using other disease specifi c chemotherapy regimens. It can be considered the standard of care for the group of patients, who failed previous attempts.",

In addition, sterility testing of the collected HPC-CB units before further processing was performed. The viability is determinated using fl ow cytometric method (7AAD) and vital coloration by Trypan Blue. The determination of CD34+ cells is by fl ow cytometric with BD FACS Calibur and monoclonal antibodies Becton Dickinson. Cell Cultures are incubated at 37\u00b0 C in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity (Stem Cell Technologies Methocult H4434 e H4534). The incubation time is 14 days.

Our results in internal control of cryopreserved samples showed high recoveries for TNC (88%) and for viability CD34+ cells (82%). Recovery of total colony-forming units (CFU) was 76%. Microbiological contamination of the collected HPC-CB samples was negative. Quality and security of the production process of cord blood units is an essential requisite of Quality System at CTMO-CCBB. Quantifi cation of cell recovery post thawing out represents a basic side for our production process. Periodic implementation of these simple tests is of fundamental importance for our internal QC. So we have always under control our production process of HPC-CB units. Multipotent, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are an emerging means of immunosuppression for patients with steroid refractory graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Despite clinical use, pre-clinical data is lacking. In in vitro experiments, MSC suppress T cell proliferation, even at low ratios of 1 MSC per 100 T cells. We examined the effects of donor-derived, intraperitoneally injected MSC on GVHD severity and onset in a myeloablative conditioned, MHC mismatched model of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [UBI-GFP/BL6 (H-2b to BALB/c (H-2d)]. Donor-derived MSC (4x10*5/mouse) were injected 4hrs pre or 24hrs post HSCT then mice were monitored daily for GVHD. Only mice given MSC 24hrs post HSCT showed a signfi cant delay in death from GVHD, with median survival increased by 10 days (d) (d7 vs d17, p<0.001). To investigate the reason for this difference, we conducted timed sacrifi ce experiments to explore whether MSC altered cytokine secretion patterns and cellular effectors, such as dendritic cells (DC), known to play a role in GVHD. When we sacrifi ced transplanted mice on d+1 at the time they would normally receive an MSC infusion, we observed more activated splenic DC and systemic IFNgamma compared to conditioned, untransplanted mice on d0. Despite this, MSC administered on d+1 post HSCT reduced the % and absolute numbers of activated DC and systemic IFNgamma (p<0.05) as compared to untreated controls or mice given MSC pre-transplant. This led us to hypothesise that IFNgamma plays an important role in MSC-mediated immunosuppression. To investigate this, we removed T cells as a major source of IFNgamma production in vivo by administering KT3 antibody to mice \u00b1 MSC, and found that although T cell depletion prolonged survival, MSC did not enhance this survival further. We then showed that MSC from IFNgamma receptor knockout mice or T cells from IFNgamma knockout mice in T cell proliferation assays were unable to suppress T cell proliferation in vitro. Collectively, these results suggest that IFNgamma is pivotal for MSC-mediated immunosuppression. We speculate that MSC remove IFNgamma in vivo preventing its downstream actions on GVHD effectors. These data also suggest that elevated systemic IFNgamma in HSCT recipients could be used as the trigger for MSC administration and therefore enhance their potency as cellular therapy for prophylaxis and treatment of GVHD. (1) Introduction: The complication of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a serious limitation to the wider application of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) for the treatment of leukemia and other hematological malignancies. GVHD is caused by dendritic cell (DC) stimulation of donor T cells and can be prevented by T cell depletion, but this impairs immunity to infections and the desired graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect. We have shown that activated human DC depleting CD83 antibody inhibits alloproliferation and that treatment of human PBMC transplanted SCID (hu-SCID) mice with the antibody prevents GVHD. Objectives: To determine if CD83 antibody treatment of hu-SCID mice, for the prevention of GVHD, impairs GVL precursors or their induction to GVL effectors. Methods: (i) GVL effectors were induced in vitro by co-culture of irradiated leukemic cell lines with human cells recovered from CD83 antibody or negative control treated hu-SCID mice. Responses were assayed in cytoxicity assays using 51-Cr labelled leukemic cells as targets. (ii) GVL effectors were induced in vivo, by immunization of hu-SCID mice with irradiated human leukemic cells at the time of allogeneic human PBMC transplant. At this time they were also treated with CD83 or negative control antibody. The mice were immunized again 7 days post-transplant. On days 9 or 10 post-transplant, when the negative control antibody treated mice had developed symptoms of GVHD, all mice were sacrifi ced. Human cells recovered from bone marrow, spleen and peritoneal cavity were pooled and used directly as effectors, without further stimulation, in 51-Cr release cytotoxicity assays with the leukemic cells used for immunization as targets. Results: (i) GVL effectors were successfully induced in vitro from human cells recovered from CD83 antibody treated hu-SCID mice for three out of the four leukemic cell lines tested. (ii) For two cell lines (U937, Raji), cytolytic effectors were successfully induced in vivo in hu-SCID mice treated with CD83 antibody. Conclusion: CD83 antibody treatment is a potential new therapy for the prevention of acute GVHD. Our in vivo preclinical data suggests that this treatment will not impair the desired GVL effect in alloHSCT.",

Janin Hospital Saint Louis (Paris, FR) Experimental data suggest a reciprocal relationship between Th17-induced pathology, and Treg regulatory role. In murine models, Th17 cells induce autoimmunity through tissue infl ammation promotion, and innate immune system mobilization. Murine models provide recent controversial results on the role of Th17 in GvHD. The Th17 subset has never been explored in human GvHD. To investigate its potential implication in GvHDinduced infl ammation, we studied Th17 cells presence in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract and their relationship with histological and clinical parameters. In addition to characterization of the cellular infi ltrate, TNF, TNF receptors, Fas in situ expression, and quantifi cation of apoptotic cell, CD4+/IL17+ cells (Th17) and CD4+/Foxp3+ cells (Treg) were quantifi ed in 40 patients with suspected GvHD of the GI tract, who had biopsies before steroid treatment. A Th17/Treg ratio<1 correlated both with the clinical diagnosis (sensitivity 74%, specifi city 100%, p=0.001), and 2 or more pathologic grade (sensitivity 64%, specifi city 94%, p<0.001).

Histopathological analysis of skin, gut and liver of these surviving mice showed no sign of GVHD. We next studied the homing, proliferation and apoptosis of the infused T lymphocytes in the early days postransplant, in order to ascertain the cause of the difference in GVHD survival. The same numbers of aly or BL6 donor T cells were recovered from the spleens of recipient mice 24-36 hours after transplant. However, signifi cantly higher numbers of BL6 T cells were recovered at day +5 compared to those of aly T cells. This difference might be explained by impaired T cell proliferation, enhanced T cell apoptosis, or a combination of both. Donor T lymphocyte proliferation was studied by means of CFSE dilution. Analysis of in vivo T cell divisions showed the same kinetics for aly and BL6 T lymphocytes at 1, 3 and 5 days after transplant. Therefore, aly T cells divided in vivo but the process was not productive. We fi nally studied apoptosis among donor T lymphocytes at 1, 3 and 5 days after transplant. We found that the proportions of apoptotic aly T cells were higher than those of BL6, at days 1 and 3, but not at day 5. The difference in total numbers of T cells at day 5 was associated to lower amounts of Th1 cytokines in the serum of mice receiving aly vs. BL6 T cells.",

Dickinson (1) (1)University of Newcastle Medical School (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK); (2) Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, PAS (Wroclaw, PL) Objective: The involvement of heat shock proteins 70 (HSP70) in peptide binding and presentation could suggest their potential role in the alloreactive process that leads to graft-versushost disease (GvHD). HSP70 have been shown to be involved in the pathology of GvHD in an animal model. More recent studies in humans, have documented an association between the increased levels of antibodies to 70kDa and 90kDa heat shock proteins in serum and the incidence of acute GvHD. Furthermore a correlation between the expression of an inducible form of HSP70 and the degree of GvHR in an in vitro skin explant model has been observed. The present study aimed to answer the question whether two coding dimorphisms of the HSP70hom gene identifi ed at positions +2437 and +2763, in addition to previously documented association with acute GvHD (Bogunia-Kubik et al. Transplantation 2005 , 2006 could affect the risk of chronic GvHD in HSCT patients. Methods: Polymorphisms within the HSP70-hom gene (+2763 G/A, +2437 C/T) were analysed in 232 HSCT patients and their donors in relation occurrence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and in 186 donor-recipient pairs for generation of graft-versus-host reactivity (GvHR) in an in vitro human skin explant model. Results: Acute GvHD was more frequently seen in patients with positive skin explant assay results (0.81 vs 0.67, p=0.046) and in those carrying the AA homozygous genotype (0.47 vs 0.22, p=0.034). Moreover, the presence of the A allele was found to be associated with higher GvHR in vitro (0.62 vs 0.45, p=0.045 for II-IV vs 0-I grade of GvHR, respectively). The incidence of chronic GvHD was higher in patients transplanted from donors carrying the A allele as compared to GG homozygotes (0.59 vs .039, p=0.041). After multivariate analysis donor A allele (OR=2.038, p=0.044), together with transplantation from female donor to male recipient (OR=3.561, p=0.006) and PBMC as a source of stem cells for transplantation (OR=2.092, p=0.049) were independent risk factors which signifi cantly contributed to the development of chronic GvHD. Conclusion: HSP70-hom gene polymorphisms associate with the development of post-transplant complications. Recipient and donor genotypes affect the risk of acute and chronic GvHD, respectively.",

Ziegler (1) , J. Finke (1) , C. Gr\u00fcllich (2) (1)University Medical Center (Freiburg, DE); (2)National Center for Tumor Diseases (Heidelberg, DE) Introduction: Polyclonal Anti T-Lymphocyte Globulins (ATG) are widely used for GvHD prophylaxis in allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). ATG have a wide epitope spectrum and have been shown to react with all compartments of peripheral blood monuclear cells (PBMNC). Furthermore, it has been S118 demonstrated that ATG can induce apoptosis in PBMNC. Infused ATG can be detected in patients sera up to one year after transplantation. Here we investigated the reactivity of ATG in the sera with PBMNC compartments from ten rabbit ATG treated patients after haematopoetic regeneration on day 21 post SCT. Patients and methods: Sera of ten patients who underwent unrelated allo SCT for haematologic malignancy and were treated with anti-Jurkat rabbit ATG-Fresenius\u00ae were collected on day 21 after SCT. All patients had achieved a full haematopoetic recovery. PBMNC of healthy volunteer donors were briefl y incubated with heat inactivated patients sera followed by incubation with FITC labelled anti-rabbit IgG. Then, subpopulations were labelled by lineage specifi c PE labelled antibodies (CD4, CD8, CD20, CD14 and CD56). ATG reactivity with cell compartments was detected by fl uorescence cytometry. Results: While the fresh ATG preparation virtually reacted with 100% of all PBMNC compartments, marked differences could be observed with day 21+ sera. The lymphoblastic leukemia cell line Jurkat used for rabbit immunizing in ATG generation still showed a 100% reactivity to ATG in sera. In PBMNC compartments only 44% of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, 58% of CD8+ Tlymphocytes and 41% of CD56+ NK cells reacted with rabbit ATG still present in patients sera. In contrast, 82% of CD20+ B-lymphocytes and 98% of CD14+ monocytes still reacted with ATG in patients sera. Discussion: The change in reactivity with ATG in patients sera on day 21+ especially within the CD4+,CD8+ T-lymphocyte and the CD56+ NK cell compartment compared to the fresh ATG preparation is most likely to be explained by specialized subgroups within these compartments that have the highest cell turnover. Thus, antibody specifi cities directed against particular epitopes present only in those subgroups could be depleted from the serum during haematopoetic regeneration. It can be speculated, wether these cells are represent activated cell subsets. To further characterize these subgroubs ATG reactivity has to be evaluated against particular cell activation and differentiation markers.",

Nachbaur Immunobiology and Stem Cell Laboratory (Innsbruck, AT) Oxidative imbalance may be involved in the pathogenesis of complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In order to investigate possible repair mechanisms during complications we have analyzed the catalase levels of 22 patients with hematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic HSCT from HLA-matched donors. Catalase levels were measured in serum at various time points before and after HSCT and were expressed as median levels \u00b1 standard error. Serum catalase levels of 16 patients determined on days -4/-5 before HSCT (146.9 \u00b1 46.4 \u00b5M) were signifi cantly higher than those of eight healthy normal controls (46.7 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b5M; p<0.005) indicating enhanced repair mechanisms present in leukemia patients already during chemotherapy. After transplantation catalase levels decrease and rise again when leukocyte counts begin to increase. The catalase levels of patients developing acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) are, with two exceptions, at each time point higher than the catalase levels of patients without this complication. The median increase of catalase at onset of acute GvHD was 1.4 \u00b1 0.3, whereas no increase (1.0 \u00b1 0.3) was observed for patients without GvHD on days +18 until +21 (represent the median days of GvHD occurrence). Patients were further divided into a group with an increase of catalase levels higher or lower than 1,5. The cumulative incidence of developing acute GvHD was 83% (58-100%, 95% confi dence interval (CI)) for patients with a 1,5 times higher catalase increase in comparison to 44% (25-76%, 95% CI) for patients with a lower catalase increase (p=n.s.). The cumulative survival after 2.3 years was 56% (32-81%, 95% CI) for patients without a catalase increase and 17% (0-46%, 95% CI) for patients with an increase >1,5 (p=0,06). Interestingly, catalase levels of six patients receiving dosis-reduced conditioning were, with two exceptions, at each time point higher than the catalase levels of the 16 patients treated with a myeloablative regimen suggesting that the intensity of the conditioning regimen is not infl uencing catalase levels.",

Rossignol (1) Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells, expressing an invariant TCR-a chain (Va24-Ja18) paired with a Vb11 TCR-b chain, recognize some glycosphingolipidic antigens presented by the MHC class I-like CD1d molecule. In murine models of HSC allograft, they control both Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) and Graft versus Leukaemia (GVL) phenomena. In this study, we addressed the status of iNKT cells in patients after HSC allograft with or without chronic GVHD treated by immunosuppressive agents and corticoids or in patients resistant to this treatment treated by extra-corporal photo-chemotherapy (ECP). Four groups of patients were designed: Group 1 corresponds to patients after HSC allograft without cGVHD, n = 7 Group 2 corresponds to patients after HSC allograft with a mildsevere cGVHD controlled by conventional treatment, n=9 Group 2 corresponds to patients after HSC allograft with severe cGVHD treated by ECP, n=5. Group of healthy donors (HD), n=5. We fi rst compared the frequency, the phenotype and the proliferative potential of blood iNKT cells in patients and in HD, by fl ow cytometry. The absolute blood iNKT cells number was signifi cantly decreased after HSC allograft in all groups of patients in comparison with HD. The ex vivo phenotypic analysis showed an enrichment in CCR7+CD161-iNKT cells in the group of allografted patients who did not develop a cGVHD. This CCR7+CD161-phenotype had been described as a central memory (CM)-like iNKT population. We further showed in the GVHD group 2 an inverse correlation between the expression of CCR7 and that of CD161, demonstrating the mutual exclusion of the CM phenotype (CCR7+) versus the effectors memory (EM) phenotype (CCR7-CD161+). We showed that the proliferative response of iNKT cells to their cognate ligand was impaired in cGVHD patients (groups 2 and 3) in comparison to iNKT cells from HD although there was no difference between group 1 and HD. This result was consistent with the iNKT CM phenotype of group 1 patients versus a more EM iNKT phenotype in the patients from group 3, since EM cells have been characterized by decreased proliferation capacities. Altogether our results demonstrate that the HSC allograft modify the homeostasis of the iNKT compartment, generating a biased central memory iNKT compartment (CCR7+CD161-) which is lost in the patients with GVHD. From a therapeutic point of view, it could be useful to preserve this EM iNKT compartment to maintain a GvL effect without developing a GVHD. A. Rossignol, A. Yip-Fa, C. Giraud, S. Noel, N. Maillard, A. Chauvineau, A. Barra, F. Guilhot, J.M. Gombert University of Poitiers (Poitiers, FR) The plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDc) are antigen-presenting cells and produce type-I IFN. They are defi ned by their coexpression of CD123, CD303 and CD4. PDc have a key role in the control of viral infections, and could be implicated in the control of the immune tolerance. Recent works showed a delay in the reconstitution of the pDc compartment after Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) allograft associated with an increased susceptibility to herpes viruses and apparition of acute Graft Versus Host Disease (aGVHD). We analysed the blood pDc absolute numbers in fl ow cytometry and the IFN-a production status of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients after HSC allograft with or without chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and with severe cGVHD resistant to conventional treatment (immuno-suppressors and corticoids), treated by extra-corporal photo-chemotherapy (ECP). Four groups were designed: Group 1 corresponds to patients after HSC allograft without cGVHD, n = 7. Group 2 corresponds to patients after HSC allograft with a mildsevere cGVHD controlled by conventional treatment, n=6 Group 3 corresponds to patients after HSC allograft with severe cGVHD treated by ECP, n=6. Group of healthy donors (HD), n=9. In the three groups of patients we showed a decreased absolute blood pDc numbers, in comparison with HD (p<0.01 versus group 1 and p<0.001 versus groups 2 and 3 at T0 before initiation of ECP). We did not show any difference in the frequency and absolute numbers of myeloid dendritic cells (mDc) between the groups of patients and HD. Patients from groups 1 and 2 have a decreased in vitro IFNa production by PBMC after stimulation by infl uenza virus in comparison with HD (p<0.05 for the comparison of group 1 and 2 with HD). We further analysed the pDc numbers along ECP and did not observed any modifi cation. At last, we show that, after 18 months post ECP initiation, the PBMC improved their IFN-a production in comparison with their production prior to initiation of ECP (T0) or after 2 to 9 months (p<0.05 for the comparison of T0, 2 months and 9 months IFN-a production with the 18 month IFN-a production). This was correlated with a clinical improvement of their cGVHD. Altogether we showed a selective defi ciency of pDc compartment in cGVHD patients, associated with a decreased production of IFN-a. We showed an improvement of IFN-a production by PBMC after ECP without any modifi cation of the pDc compartment. These results suggest that the pDc were a target of the ECP therapy.",

Kanold CHU (Clermont-Ferrand, FR) In the setting of Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD), the cryopreservation of mononuclear cells could allow to maintain the ECP schedule while reducing the number of apheresis. The aim of our work is so to assess whether cryopreservation impairs the immunomodulatory function of Extracorporeal Photochemotherapy (ECP) treated mononuclear cells. Material and methods: Blood of haploidentic healthy donors. Isolation of PBMC by centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients. Cryopreservation in 3.5% dim\u00e9thylsulfoxyde (DMSO) at -80\u00b0C without controlled-rate freezing (same process we use in clinical practice). Thawing in 37\u00b0C water, then ECP on Vilber-Lourmat irradiator. Viability and apoptosis measured by trypan blue exclusion test and annexin V fi xation. Immunomodulatory effects assessed in haploidentic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) by measurement of non-treated cell proliferation (Carboxyfl uorescein succinimidyl ester = CFSE dye dilution). Results: cryopreservation induced a loss of about 10% of cells, and triggered apoptosis. However, after ECP the rate of apoptotic cells was similar in fresh or frozen cells (one hour after ECP: 24% of fresh cells were annexin V + vs 28% of cryopreserved cells, p=NS; after 48h culture: 61% vs 69%, respectively, p=NS). On the three fi rst experiments, the inhibition of alloreactive cell proliferation in MLR induced by ECP-treated cells was similar with fresh and frozen cells (-21% of proliferating cells vs -17%, respectively). Conclusion: these preliminary data suggest that frozen cells retain their immunomodulatory effects after ECP. Other parameters such as IL10 secretion and triggering of regulatory T cells are currently investigated. These data will permit using cryopreserved cells to optimize and facilitate the treatment of GVHD by ECP.",

Nikkinen (1) Background: Matching for HLA genes located in chromosome 6 is required in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to reduce the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). However, a considerable proportion of patients still suffer from it, obviously due to genetic differences outside the HLA gene region. Design and methods: We studied the similarity of almost 4000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 6 between patients receiving HSCT and their HLA matched sibling donors. Results: We observed that as a result of routine HLA matching the siblings in fact shared surprisingly long chromosomal fragments with similar SNP genotypes -from 11.65 Mb to 134.66 Mb. The number of genes mapped on these shared fragments varied from 402 to 1302. Considering the whole chromosome 6, the HLA matched siblings were apparently identical for 65.2% to 97.8% of the SNPs. Conclusions: Potentially, genes similar in some transplantation pairs while different in others might have a signifi cant role in determining the outcome after HSCT.

Samuel, R. Or, I.B. Resnick Hadassah -Hebrew University Medical Cen (Jerusalem, IL) Cyclosporine (CSA) is the backbone of GVHD prophylaxis in the last decades. It is established that CSA levels in the 1st weeks after transplant are critical for the rate and severity of GVHD. Initially, we gave CSA starting on day -1 in all our protocols. However, 7 years ago, we have changed CSA initiation in most of our protocols to day -4 in order to have stable, controlled therapeutic blood levels of CSA prior to transplant. Patients and methods: the records of 1716 patients that underwent allogeneic transplantation were analyzed. Out of them, we identifi ed 2 groups of patients that received T-cell repleted grafts in which CSA was used for GVHD prevention, starting on days -1 or -4 (n=219 and 261 respectively). The guidelines for CSA cessation and DLI were uniform in both groups. The groups were compared for engraftment, GVHD (both acute and chronic), GVHD associated death and overall survival. Results: The groups were equal for age, sex, donor type, matching, disease and disease status. The median time to ANC engraftment was 16 and 15 days in the CSA -1 and -4 groups respectively with a trend toward better engraftment with CSA -4 (fi gure 1A, P=0.07). However, platelet engraftment was significantly better with CSA -4, with a median of 14 and 12 days in the CSA -1 and -4 groups respectively (fi gure 1B, p=0.0005). One hundred and twelve and 138 patients developed aGVHD of any grade, respectively. Out of them 54% and 44% had severe (grade 3-4) aGVHD (p=0.45). The median time to aGVHD was similar, with a median of 29 and 28.5 days in the CSA -1 and -4 groups respectively (p=0.54). However, 64 patients developed cGVHD in the CSA -1 group, while 102 did so in the CSA -4 group (fi gure 2A, p=0.0002. Hazard ratio 0.5893, 95% CI 0.3693 to 0.7328). Of these patients, 46.8% and 40.2% of the patients had extensive cGVHD (p=0.70), respectively. The mortality in the groups was higher in the CSA -1 group (67.6% and 50.5%, fi gure 2B, p=0.074. Hazard ratio 1.2370, 95% CI 0.9792 to 1.5828). Additionally, despite lower GVHD rate in the CSA -1 group, the proportion of GVHD associated death was more higher then in the CSA -4 group (41/148 and 17/132 patients, p=0.02). We conclude that initiating CSA on day -4 improves engraftment, conversely increases the risk for cGVHD of any grade (possibly through prevention of tolerance), but reduces the risk of GVHD associated death and improves overall survival.",

Salvatore Hospital (Pesaro, IT); (3)University of Pavia (Pavia, IT) The prediction of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) is one of the crucial aspects of unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A relatively high number of immunobiological variables have shown to play a role in aGVHD and research of a predictive algorithm is still ongoing. We investigated the prognostic performance of an artifi cial neural network (ANN) and compared it with standard logistic regression (LR) in predicting aGVHD in a group of 71 beta-thalassemia major patients (median age 11.4 years, range 1.5-29) transplanted from an unrelated donor, having considered that these patients have homogeneous immunobiological features. All patients were administered a myeloablative conditioning regimen and GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine-A, short-term methotrexate and ATG. Thirty-one percent of the patients developed grade II-IV aGVHD. Altogether, 30 different variables were evaluated: donor/recipient sex and age, Pesaro risk class, CMV serology, HCV-RNA positivity, conditioning regimen, infused CD34 cell dose, HLA-DPB1 disparity, donor/recipient HLA-Cw ligand groups for killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR):C1/C2 heterozygosity or C2/C2-C1/C1 homozygosity, donor/recipient activatory or inhibitory KIRs, donor/recipient HLA-G 14-basepair polymorphism, donor KIR AA haplotype. Patients were randomized into a learning data set (n=61) and a test data set (n=10). After training the neural network on the learning data set, LR analysis and three-layer ANN were used to predict aGVHD. LR identifi ed three independent variables with prognostic signifi cance for developing aGVHD: patients that were heterozygotes for HLA-Cw groups 1 and 2 (C1/C2); patients homozygous for the HLA-G 14-basepair deletion (-/-14-bp); donors homozygous for KIR haplotype A (AA). The sensitivity of LR (performance in predicting aGVHD in patients who developed aGVHD) was 68.4% in the learning data set and and 66.7% in the test data set; the specifi city (the ability to predict the absence of aGVHD in patients who did not develop aGVHD) was 83.3% and 71.4% respectively. The sensitivity of ANN was 84.2% in the learning data set and 66.7% in the test data set; specifi city was 100% and 71.4%, respectively (see Table) .The specifi city of ANN in predicting aGVHD following unrelated HSCT was signifi cantly higher than LR, but its sensitivity was lower. In this context, automated multivariate analysis may prove to be a useful optimization tool.",

Ehninger (1) , M. Bornh\u00e4user (1) , R. Wassmuth (2) (1)University Hospital (Dresden, DE) ; (2) DKMS Lifescience Lab (Dresden, DE) Objectives: Occurrence and severity of infl ammation is infl uenced by polymorphisms in genes coding for cytokines and their receptors. As an example a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 1142 of the Interleukin 23-receptor (IL23R) gene leading to an exchange of guanosin by adenosine has been demonstrated to offer protection from Crohns disease. Recently, investigators suggested a protective effect against acute Graft-versus-Host-Disease (aGvHD) after allogeneic transplantation. In this study we tried to further evaluate IL23R-genotype for the prediction of aGvHD and respiratory failure after allogeneic transplantation. Methods: Genomic DNA of 339 donor-recipient pairs was amplifi ed using whole-genome amplifi cation. Typing for IL23R(1142A>G)-SNP was done using a commercially available real-time PCR based genotyping assay. Suffi cient data regarding IL23R-mutational status and aGvHD was present in 332 patients and their respective donors. The majority of patients (205 of 332 patients) were transplanted from matched unrelated donors mainly using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC: n=314, bone marrow: n=17; cord blood: n=1). Results: At least one mutated IL23R-allele was present in 50 of 332 (15.0%) recipients and 38 of 332 (11.4%) donors. Minor allele frequencies were in the range of published data (Donors: 0.059; Recipients: 0.078). The incidence of aGvHD \u00b0II-IV was signifi cantly lower in patients with wild-type IL23R-gene transplanted from IL23R-mutated donors (15%) compared to cases with wild-type status in donor and recipient (42%, p=0.044). Patients bearing the IL23R SNP receiving an IL23R wild-type transplant as well as those with a mutation on donor-and recipient-side, were demonstrated to have intermediate rates of aGvHD \u00b0II-IV(36% and 28% respectively). However, IL23-Receptor genotype did not correlate with overall-survival. Furthermore, we found no association of IL23R-mutational status and a deterioration of respiratory function as measured by oxygenation-index (paO2 / FiO2). Conclusion: Transplanting IL23R-wildtype patients from donors with the the IL23R(1142G>A)-SNP seems to be protective against aGvHD. As this is the second study confi rming such benefi cial effects, a prospective evaluation of donor selection according to IL23R-genotype is warranted.",

Kuzmina, R Weigl, R. Knobler, N. Worel, H. Greinix, W. Pickl Medical University of Vienna (Vienna, AT) Introduction: ECP is an effi cient and safe treatment for patients with cGVHD. Evaluation of response and distinction from irreversible tissue damage can be diffi cult in patients with longlasting cGVHD. We recently published that an elevation of immature/transitional CD19+/CD21-B cells is signifi cantly associated with active cGVHD (Greinix et al, BBMT 14:208, 2008) . Aim of the study: We investigated the role of immature/transitional CD19+/CD21-B cells as potential cellular biomarkers for monitoring objectively response to ECP. Patients and methods: Twenty-eight patients (14 males and 14 females) with moderate (n=17) or severe (n=11) cGVHD and with 2 or less (n=14) or > 2 organs (n=14) involved were included. Seven had de novo onset, 17 quiescent and 4 S122 progressive onset of cGVHD. ECP was given as fi rst-line therapy in 12 patients and as salvage therapy in 16 ones. ECP was performed initially on 2 consecutive days every two weeks and monthly after improvement. CGVHD was assessed every 3 months according to NIH Consensus Criteria. At the same time points T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells and B cell subsets (CD19+/21-, CD19+/IgD-/CD27+, CD19+/IgD+/CD27+) were analyzed from peripheral blood (PB) by fl ow cytometry. For comparison of clinical response and PB cell numbers patients were divided into responders to ECP (n=20), and non-responders (n=8). Results: After 6 months of ECP 20/28 (71%) patients showed improvement of cGVHD including 14/17 with moderate and 6/11 with severe cGVHD. The number of immature/transitional CD19+/CD21-B cells was signifi cantly (p <0.001) lower in patients with response to ECP with a mean of 6.8% (range 1-19) compared to ECP-non-responders with a mean of 25% (range 14-43). Whereas complete responders had a mean of 5% (range 1-15), partial responders had 8% (range 1.7-19) . In addition, the ratio between immature/transitional B cells and CD19+/CD27+ memory B cells was signifi cantly different (p<0.001) with a mean of 2.2% (range 0.1-6.5) in ECPresponders and 8.6% (range 1. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] in non-responders. One year after start of ECP immature/transitional CD19+/CD21-B cells remained at a mean of 6% in CR patients compared to 24% in ECP-non-responders (p<0.001). Discussion: We confi rm that ECP achieves high response rates in patients with cGVHD. In ECP-responders immature/transitional B cell numbers are signifi cantly lower suggesting that this PB cell subset could serve as cellular biomarker for monitoring of cGVHD activity during ECP. Alloreactivity with the presence of aGvHD in patients post HSCT is a major factor affecting the outcome of haematopoietic stem cells transplantation (HSCT). In this study we focused on the presence of IL-17 producing cells in patients post HSCT in the context of cells with FoxP3 and IFNgamma producing potential. We studied the cytoplasmic expression of IL-17, FoxP3 and IFN-gamma in stimulated PBMC of alloHSCT pts (30 patients, median age: 45 years (from 1.0 to 59 years), 28 haematological malignancies, 2 SCID). Fifteen of them developed aGvHD including 9 pts with aGvHD seen at later stage post hematological reconstitution. PBMC were stimulated, according to the manufacturer procedure, with BD Leukocyte Activation Cocktail (PMA, Ionomycin and BFA) in the presence of GolgiStop, and then stained with CD4, IL-17A, IFN-gamma and FoxP3. Cells were analyzed in CD4+ and CD4-lymphocytes subpopulations. We found: (1) Contribution of IL-17A+ producing cells to CD4+ lymphocytes increased from 1.16%+0.41 at the day of hematological recovery to 5.16%+2.47 shortly before aGvHD manifestation (p=0.027, Wilcoxon Test) and then decreased to 0.74%+0.27 (p=0.008, Wilcoxon Test) when patients had overt aGvHD, (2) aGvHD manifestation was associated with an increase of FoxP3+CD4+ cells (p=0.01, Wilcoxon Test), (3) IFNgamma producing cells contribution to CD4+ cells populations is lower at aGvHD manifestation then at earlier time(p<0.04, Wilcoxon test). In conclusion: (1) Under PMA, Ionomycin and BFA stimulation CD4+ cells become in part IL-17, IFNgamma and FoxP3 positive in patients post HSCT, (2) FoxP3+CD4+ cells increase at the manifestation of aGvHD likely to counter-balance alloreactive stimulation of the immune system, (3) Proportions of IL-17+ cells in CD4+ cells population decrease at the time of full blown aGvHD, likely being marginalized in the infl amed tissues, (4) IFNgamma producing cells among CD4+ cells population do not increase at aGvHD manifestation (IFNgamma is not needed for aGvHD pathomechanism).

El-Cheikh, L. Wang, B. Esterni, C. Faucher, S. Furst, P. Berger, D. Blaise Institut Paoli Calmettes (Marseille, FR) Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a signifi cant risk in patients with graft versus host disease (GvHD) after allo-transplantation. A comparative retrospective single centre study was conducted to investigate the effi cacy and safety of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB, Ambisome\u00ae) prophylaxis of fungal infections in allotransplanted patients with GvHD. A total of 125 patients receiving high-dose prednisone (2 mg/ kg/day) therapy for acute and/or chronic GvHD after allo-SCT were identifi ed. 118 pateints (94%) had a RIC regimen and 7 (6%) a myeloablative conditioning; 95 patients (76%) had a family donor and 30 patients (24%) had an unrelated donor. Median age at transplant was 48 years (range 18-70). Forty-two patients received once-weekly high-dose (7.5 mg/kg/ week) L-AmB as prophylactic treatment. Eighty-three patients of the control group received possibly other prophylactic antifungal drugs such as fl uconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole. The prophylactic median dose of L-AmB was 500 mg/week (range 300-650) and the median duration of treatment was 7 weeks (range 2-15). The incidence of IPA disease was 8% in the prophylactic group at both one year and two years vs 36% and 44%, respectively, in the control group (p=0.008). No fungal infection-related deaths were observed post-transplantation in the prophylactic group vs 12 (14%) at one year, 14 (17%) at two years and 16 (19%) at three years post-transplantation in the control group (p=0.005). The OS rate at one year was 69% for the prophylactic group vs 75% for the control group; at two years the OS was 55% in the prophylactic group vs 64% in the control group (p = 0.60). There were no differences in the TRM rates between the two groups at two years (18% vs 19%) and at three years (18% vs 21%) (p = 0.99). Prophylactic treatment with L-AmB was well tolerated. Renal toxicity leading to treatment discontinuation was observed in only fi ve patients (12%) who were concomitantly treated with other nephrotoxic drugs; nephrotoxicity was reversible in all fi ve patients. These data suggest L-AmB prophylaxis is an effective and well tolerated treatment for the prevention of invasive fungal infection and can reduce the fungal infection related mortality in RIC allo-SCT patients presenting a severe GvHD; further prospective clinical studies are required to confi rm these single center data.",

Sclerodermatous GvHD strongly affects quality of life and survival of hematopoietic transplant recipients. Since current therapeutic approaches often fail, it is important to fi nd novel immunosuppressive strategies for refractory forms of sclerodermatous GvHD.

            "text": "In this retrospective analysis we report 27 patients (pts) with sclerodermatous cGVHD treated with mTOR-I (everolimus n=16; sirolimus n=11). Nine pts had de novo cGVHD, 6 had progressive cGvHD developing from acute GvHD and 12 had cGvHD following donor lymphocyte transfusions. Whereas 26 pts had cutaneous scleroderma, one patient developed oesophageal stenosis. Eight pts received a monotherapy of mTOR-I, 17 pts received a combination therapy with steroids and 6 pts received additional immunosuppressive drugs, no calcineurin inhibitors however. In 4 pts extracorporeal photopheresis was performed as an additional therapy. To further reduce the risk of adverse events drug trough levels were monitored and the dosing was adjusted to low therapeutical levels (3-8 ng/ml). Five and 13 pts had a complete and a partial response, respectively, with an overall response rate of 67%. In 2 pts, sclerodermatous changes stayed without progression. Six pts displayed a progressive course of the disease despite mTOR-I therapy and therefore the treatment was discontinued. Steroids could be tapered and stopped in a signifi cant number of pts. No difference in response was observed in everolimus-and sirolimus-treated pts. Major adverse events possibly related to mTOR-I were hyperlipidaemia and impaired wound healing, especially in pts with ulcerative skin lesions. One patient developed thrombotic microangiopathy and infectious complications were rare. Eight pts died, 5 of the non-responders either due to cGvHD (n=3) or infection (n=2). One of the responders died due to a relapse of the underlying malignancy, 1 died of secondary malignancy and 1 of unknown cause. The median follow-up for surviving pts is 19 months. Our retrospective analysis suggests that mTOR inhibitors are effective immunosuppressive agents for the control of sclerodermatous cGvHD. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the major cause of morbility and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Endothelial cells (EC) represent a barrier between recipient tissues and circulating T alloreactive lymphocytes after HSCT. Recent studies have demonstrated a role of Protein C (PC) pathway in the EC protection during infl ammatory diseases. In this study we evaluated the expression, by immunohistochemistry, of PC pathway's components on EC in patients with acute and chronic GVHD. Particularly, we investigated the endothelial expression of thrombomodulin (TM), endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) in 18 acute and 5 chronic GVHD biopsies and the results were compared with that observed in 7 normal skin biopsies, 5 normal intestinal biopsies, and 15 biopsies from several infl ammatory lesions of skin and gut. The percentage of EPCR/TM/PAR1-positive EC was calculated by evaluating 20 randomly-chosen fi elds in each biopsy. Biopsies showing \u226575% of negatively-stained EC were scored 0; \u226550<75% scored 1; \u226525<50% scored 2; fi nally, score 3 was assigned to biopsies with <25% of negative EC. In acute and chronic GVHD we observed a damage and loss of EC with a strong decrease of EPCR expression in EC compared to normal controls. Furthermore, we observed a decreased positivity of TM in most EC and an increased expression of PAR-1. These fi ndings were mostly similar to those observed in infl ammatory diseases. The Dunn test supplied statistically signifi cant differences (p<0.05) for all three scoring variables between controls and all lesion groups. No differences were found between lesion groups (table 1). It has been proved that APC, through the involvement of cellular receptors EPCR and PAR-1, determines modifi cation of gene expression, anti-apoptotic and anti-infl ammatory activities, as well as the improvement of endothelial barrier functions. The similar results observed in GVHD and infl ammatory diseases support the view that GVHD may be considered an exaggerated manifestation of a normal infl ammatory mechanism. The cause of TM and EPCR reduction on EC may be due to cytokines production. In fact, It has been demonstrated S124 that TNF-alpha and IL-1 suppress both TM and EPCR on EC at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Our data suggest that in GVHD, both anti-coagulant and cytoprotective APC pathway, might play a key role in the control of the process.",

            "text": "Role of the HLA-G 14-base pair deletion-insertion polymorphism in the development of severe acute GvHD following unrelated haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in beta-thalassaemia patients R. Littera (1) Non classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G Class I molecules are encoded by a gene mapped on the short arm of Chromosome 6, telomeric to the classical HLA-A, -B, and -C genes. HLA-G allelic variants may be characterized by a 14-basepair (bp) deletion-insertion polymorphism located in the 3'-untranslated (UT) region of the HLA-G gene. The presence of the 14bp insertion/deletion polymorphism seems to modify immune tolerance through enhanced synthesis of HLA-G molecules. To investigate the impact of this polymorphism on allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, we performed a retrospective analysis of 77 thalassemia patients transplanted from an unrelated donor. The donor/recipient pairs were selected for being completely identical for HLA class I and II and the HLA-G and HLA-G 14-bp genotypes. Twenty-fi ve patients developed grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD), 8 of whom had severe (grade III-IV) aGvHD. Patients that were homozygous for the 14-bp deletion had a higher risk of developing aGvHD compared to patients homozygous or heterozygous for the 14-bp insertion (13/25 -52% were -14bp/-14bp). In particular, 6 of the 8 severe cases of Grade III-IV acute GvHD (75%) were -14bp/-14bp homozygotes (relative risk = 6.0; 95% Confi dence Interval 1.12 -32.10; p = 0.04). These data confi rm that the 14-bp polymorphism is one of genetic factors involved in the development of aGVHD and may serve as a useful tool in predicting HSCT outcomes. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and encodes a protein which transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells that down-regulates T-cell activation. Polymorphisms of this gene have been associated with autoimmune diseases and it has recently been observed that donor genotypes correlate with the clinical outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in leukemia patients. In an attempt to replicate this result in unrelated HSCT of thalassemia patients, we compared the genotypical distribution of 3 polymorphisms of the CTLA-4 gene in 71 thalassemia patients and their unrelated donors with the clinical outcomes of the transplantation procedure. A signifi cant association was observed for the CTLA-4/CT60-AA genotype in recipients and the development of Grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) (48% vs 15%; P=0.0058, OR=5.3) and Grade III-IV aGVHD (60% vs 20%; P=0.02; OR=6.1). In the donors, this analysis did not reach statistical signifi cance (36% vs 25%; P=0.3). Logistic regression demonstrated that the association observed in the patients did not depend upon other known or putative risk factors for Grade II-IV or Grade III-IV aGVHD. In our patient sampling, none of the 3 polymorphisms analyzed were associated with rejection. Overall, the data obtained in this study confi rm that the genetic variability of CTLA-4 is an important prognostic factor for the development of aGVHD after HSCT. More specifi cally, our fi ndings suggest that the recipient and not the donor genotype is the main risk determinant. Other studies on larger case reports will be necessary to confi rm this association and to clarify its functional aspects. Objective: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the major obstacle for successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and T helper1 (Th1), T helper 2 (Th2) and related cytokines are key mediators. However, most of the Th1/Th2 studies came from animal models and most of the cytokines studies examined cytokine levels only at few time points after transplant, which is diffi cult to refl ect the whole picture of real clinical situation. This study is designed to see the frequencies of Th1, Th2 and related cytokines in the whole post-transplant course and to fi nd the correlation between changing levels of these immune parameters and clinical activity of GVHD. Methods: Of consecutive 23 patients receiving allotransplant, peripheral blood was collected weekly from Day 7 to Day 210 (patients without graft-versus-host disease) or Day 300 (patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease). Plasma IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, and IFN-gamma were determined by ELISA and the frequencies of Th1 and Th2 within CD4+ T cells were determined by fl ow cytometry. Total 264 plasma specimens and 44 buffy coats from 12 patients were thawed for examinations. They were 2 patients of no GVHD, 1 patient who died of acute GVHD, 4 patients of both acute and chronic GVHD, and 5 patients of de novo chronic GVHD. Results: The plasma level of IL-10 and IFN-gamma (fi gure 1) and the frequency of Th1, Th2 (fi gure 2) were signifi cantly higher when acute and chronic GVHD developed. Interestingly, even without ex vivo phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate [PMA] + ionomycin [I] stimulation, the Th1 and Th2 could be easily detected when patients had GVHD and the Pearson correlation test showed a perfect positive relationship between the frequency of Th1 and Th2 (r=0.966, p<0.001). The dynamic changing pattern of plasma IL-10 was especially correlated well with the clinical activity of GVHD. Besides, when patients\u00a1\u00a6 GVHD responded to immunosuppressive treatment, the decrease of plasma IL-10 level is prompt and is earlier than clinical improvement. The plasma level of IL-4, IL-12, and Th1/Th2 ratio did not signifi cantly correlated with GVHD. (Bars in Figure 1A and Figure 2 : 95% confi dence interval). Conclusion: The frequency of Th1, Th2 and plasma IL-10 level closely related to the clinical course of GVHD. They are good biomarkers of GVHD and can be used to monitor the therapeutic responsiveness. Furthermore, both Th1 and Th2 likely contribute to the development of both acute and chronic GVHD. Proposal: For GvHD prophylaxis we introduced low dose Alemtuzumab (MabCampathTM) in combination with Cyclosporine A in matched (10mg Alemtuzumab) and HLA A, B and DRB1 mismatched (20mg Alem-tuzumab) sibling or unrelated donor alloHCT. To evaluate the effi ciency of these low doses of Alemtuzumab in both groups, we compared the doses for the incidences of acute and chronic GvHD and reasons for death. Patients: Overall, 214 pts. (group 10mg n= 181; group 20mg n=33) received after a mainly fl udarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning (group 10mg 87%; group 20mg 81%) a graft (PBSC in 99%) from a sibling (22%; 0%;) or UD (78%; 100%;). Diagnosis were AML/MDS (72%; 67%;) or lymphoma/MM (10%; 21%). In the mismatch-group n=25 had one and n=8 had two major mismatches. Remission at TX was mainly advanced disease stage/>CR1 (85%; 100%), also refl ected by the fact that within both groups 59% and 66% had persistent induction failure or relapse. Median age was 59 (20-76) and 53 (23-74) years, respectively. Results: In the day +30 diagnostic procedures 90% and 86% of the patients achieved CR; acute GvHD \u00b0II-\u00b0IV was seen in 27% and 33% and \u00b0III-\u00b0IV in 11% and 12%; limited (24%; 25%) and extensive (16%; 21%) cGvHD show as well comparable results in both groups. Alive are 60% and 64% at a median of 375 days (8-893); main cause of death was relapse/progression (22%). The non relapse mortality (NRM) was 18% in both groups; 16% of all patients died due to infections/MOF and fi ve patients died due to aGvHD (2%). None of the UD HCT recipients died from acute GvHD. Conclusion: GvHD-prophylaxis with CsA and Alemtuzumab one single 10mg dose at day-1 absolutely is suffi cient and feasible and does show low incidences of \u00b0III-\u00b0IV aGvHD, extensive cGvHD and aGvHD-associated NRM. In HLA A,B or DRB1 mismatched transplantations 20mg Alemtuzumab (10mg Alemtuzumab day-2 and -1) is suffi cient to achieve comparable results.",

Recently, some published data have suggested a potential role of the chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) and its receptor CX3CR1, in a murine model of intestinal GVHD. (Ueha 2007) . The aim of this study is to evaluate, in humans, the impact of the CX3CR1 genetic polymorphism in the occurence GVHD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Patients and methods: Single nucleotide polymorphisms of CX3CR1 were identifi ed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Taqman) in 99 patients transplanted from a HLA identical sibling donor. Twenty fi ve percent of the patients were heterozygous or homozygous for the I249 mutation and 14% for the M280 mutation. Median age at transplant was 50 years (range: 17-69). Forty percent of the patients had an advanced disease at the time of transplant. Fifty percent of the patients received a reduced conditioning regimen; the source of stem cell was peripheral blood in 56% of patients. Results: The incidence of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) were respectivelly of 45% et 16%; 41% of the patients presented a cutaneous aGVHD and 17% an intestinal aGVHD. In univariate analysis, patients with I249 or M280 mutations of CX3CR1 had a lower incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD (4% versus 21% in the remaining patients p=0.04) and of cutaneous aGVHD (23% versus 49% in the remaining patients p=0.02). In univariate analysis, the only other factor signifi cantly associated with the incidence of cutaneous aGVHD was the pre-transplant donor/recipient CMV serology. Impact on cutaneous aGVHD, of CX3CR1 polymorphism remained signifi cant in multivariate analysis (p=0.03. HR= 0.39; SE: 0.44). Conclusion: These results suggest that fractalkine and its receptor CX3CR1 play a role in in the occurrence of aGVHD in human and that CX3CR1 genetic polymorphism is associated with lower incidence of cutaneous aGVHD.",

Russo University of Brescia (Brescia, IT) Hepatic chronic GVHD (cGVHD) develops generally as an indolent cholestatic disease or as an autoimmune hepatitis, being often refractory to immunosuppressive therapy. Liver biopsy is helpful to confi rm diagnosis, but it is not always feasible because of possible clinical complications. FibroScan is a new, fast and non-invasive technique to measure liver stiffness. FibroScan has been validated to detect signifi cant positive relationship between liver stiffness values and histological fi brosis in chronic liver diseases. Being fi brosis a hallmark of cGVHD, we prospectively evaluated the usefulness of FibroScan as non-invasive tool to make diagnosis of liver cGVHD. Liver stiffness measurements were performed on 10 healthy subjects and 20 patients undergoing allogeneic SCT before transplantation, then every 3 months and at the diagnosis of cGVHD. One patient was HCV RNA-positive. No patients had any sign of liver disease at transplantation.",

The median value of successful measurements was considered representative of the liver stiffness in a given patient, only if the interquartile range (IQR) of all validated measurements was less than 30% of the median value. Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis. Nine patients developed cGVHD (67% extensive) at a median time of 5 months (range, 4-6). Liver was involved in 67% of patients. Liver stiffness values did not differ signifi cantly in healthy subjects, patients before allogeneic SCT and patients after allogeneic SCT without cGVHD. Patients with hepatic cGVHD had higher stiffness values than healthy subjects (7,7 \u00b1 4,6 vs 4,6 \u00b1 1,5 kPa, p=0,03) and than patients without cGVHD (7,7 \u00b1 4,6 vs 4,6 \u00b1 1,9 kPa, p=0,03). Furthermore, liver stiffness values were higher in all patients with cGVHD than in healthy subjects (7 \u00b1 3,9 vs 4,6 \u00b1 1,5 kPa, p=0,04) and patients without cGVHD (7 \u00b1 3,9 vs 4,6 \u00b1 1,9 kPa, p=0,04). Our prospective study suggests that FibroScan could be a reliable non-invasive technique for the early diagnosis of hepatic cGVHD. However, it was not possible to demonstrate signifi cantly different stiffness values in the setting of cGVHD between patients with and without hepatic involvement. The small number of patients included in the survey or a clinically silent involvement of liver in all cases of cGVHD may account for this observation. Polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulins (ATG) and monoclonal humanized Campath-1H (C1H) are regularly administered before allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), to prevent rejection and acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGvHD), respectively. The dose of ATG and C1H is solely based on the total body weight (BW) of the patient. High concentrations of ATG or C1H post-transplant may delay immune reconstitution and may have an impact on cellular immunotherapy, scheduled early after SCT. In this single centre study serum levels of ATG as well as C1H were related to immune recovery and aGvHD. Between April 2004 and October 2007, 104 children received their fi rst SCT. In 21 of them no serotherapy was used in the conditioning regimen, in 47 patients ATG (Imtix) and in 36 patients C1H (Alemtuzumab) was applied. ATG patients received a total dose of 10 mg/kg over 4 days, the total dose of C1H varied from 0.6 to 1 mg/kg over 3-5 days. Active ATG and C1H concentrations were measured in frequently collected sera with a quantitative fl owcytometry assay (FACS), using the HUT78 T-cell line as target cells. Results were correlated to pre-and post-transplant parameters. Immunophenotyping of lymphocytes (Ly) by FACS was done weekly. The clearance of ATG was much faster than of C1H. ATG treated patients reached the sub-therapeutic level of 1 U/ml at day +12 (range 2-41 days), whereas in C1H patients this level being 0.1 \u00b5g/ml was reached at day +37 (range 3-70 days). ATG treated patients engrafted faster and showed an earlier immune recovery of Ly and especially of T-cells than C1H treated patients. The serum ATG concentration at day of SCT did correlate with T cell recovery but not with engraftment. The serum ATG level after the fourth dose correlated with the total dose given, pointing to the relative higher dosing in patients with a higher BW. The C1H dose given (total and per kg) correlated with the C1H concentration at day +20. A high C1H concentration at day +20 correlated with a delayed engraftment and recovery of Ly, T-and NK-cells. Patients with a C1H rest concentration below 1 \u00b5g/ml already at day +10 post SCT had a increased risk of aGvHD.",

Lankester, R.G.M. Bredius, M.J.D. van Tol Leiden University Medical Centre (Leiden, NL) Introduction: Polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, Imtix) is given prior to paediatric stem cell transplantation (SCT) to prevent rejection and Graft-versus-Host disease (GvHD). Material and methods: In this study the course of the ATG concentration was measured in a cohort of 39 paediatric patients who received their fi rst SCT at the department of Paediatrics of the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC) between August '06 and July '08. All patients received 10 mg/kg divided over 4 days, starting between 6 and 4 days prior to SCT. Unique in this study was that serum samples were taken frequently before and after every ATG dose and continued until 3 months post SCT. The active ATG, capable of binding to T-cells, was measured by FACS, whereas the total amount of rabbit IgG was measured by ELISA techniques. Results: It was found that the ATG concentration showed peak and off-peak values between every ATG dose. There was a huge variation between the individual patients, the median total ATG concentration that was reached after the fi nal dose was 80 ug/ml with a range of 52 -124 ug/ml, peak values after the subsequent doses were respectively 30-48-62 and 80 ug/ml. the active ATG concentration 12.0 U/ml with a range from 5.1 to 25.4 U/ml. It was found that there is no good correlation between the amount of active ATG and total rabbit-IgG in a patient over the different time points pre and post SCT, therefore FACS is the most reliable method to measure the concentration of active ATG. Although all patients received ATG in a dose of 10 mg/kg a signifi cant difference (P=0.002) was found between the patients with a bodyweight below or above 30 kg, therefore there could be a risk of overdosing in this last group. The clearance of active ATG is much faster than the clearance of total rabbit-IgG with half-lifes of 2-7 days and 5-30 days respectively. In the fi rst days after ATG administration the halflife of the active ATG is even faster. Patients with a low ATG concentration at the moment of transplantation were found to have a higher risk to develop GvHD, some patients with high ATG concentration showed an impaired T-cell recovery. Discussion: It would be ideal to develop a pharmacodynamical model for the dosing of ATG in individual patients, but further research with more patients is needed to make that possible. (1) Objectives: Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (cGvHD) is a recognized but unsatisfactorily described cause of genital complications in female patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). In a population-based study, we have assessed the prevalence, clinical features and histopathology of genital cGvHD. Methods: All women alive after allo- SCT 1996 SCT -2005 in the Western region of Sweden were invited to participate in a study comprising (i) gynaecological examination including photo-documentation for the clinical diagnosis of genital cGvHD, (ii) biopsies for pathological examination and (iii) structured anamnesis and validated questionnaires for assessment of depression and sexual dysfunction. To exclude estrogen defi ciency, all pts recevied local estrogen before cGvHD diagnosis. Results: Of 53 consecutive pts, 44 (83%) were examined with a minimal follow-up of 3 years post-transplant. Median age was 47 (26-72) yrs and post-SCT 6 (3-12) yrs. Symptoms of genital cGvHD included dryness, smart, pain and dyspareunia; signs were dry, thin, sore mucosa, local white and red spots, lichenoid patterns, synechiae, stenosis and painful vaginal strings. Clinical signs were categorized as probable, possible or unlikely cGvHD. Probable genital cGvHD was diagnosed in 17 pts (39%) of whom 13 had vaginal stenosis or adhesions and 3 women had vulvar synechiae. Possible cGvHD was observed in another 14 pts. Biopsies were obtained from 34 pts and histopathological diagnosis of cGvHD was made in accordance with NIH criteria (ref) . Histopathological fi ndings included lichenoid infl ammation, epithelial apoptosis, ulceration and fi brosis. The clinical diagnosis of probable cGvHD was confi rmed as probable or possible in biopsies of 15/17 cases, whereas in the group of pts clinically cathegorized as possible cGvHD 8/14 were graded as probable or possible. Depression as assessed by Beck Depression Inventory and sexual dysfunction as estimated by Female Sexual Distress Scale were established in 29% and 45% of pts, respectively. Conclusion: The prevalence of genital cGvHD after allo-grafting is unexpectedly high and appears to be associated with sexual dysfunction and mental depression. We hypothesize that early gynecological intervention may reduce the risk of severe symptoms and sequelae, and propose that gynecological expertise should be part of the team around the allografted woman. Here, we report the results of a multicenter retrospective study analyzing the effect of ATG, incorporated within the MAC regimen for MUD-transplants in leukemic patients. The purpose of the study was to compare the incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD as well as overall outcome. 171 adult patients with acute leukemia and MDS, for whom detailed allelic HLA typing (4 digits) was available, were included. 81% of patients were transplanted from 10/10 allelic MUD, and 19% from a MUD with at least one allelic difference. 120 patients (70%) did not receive ATG (no-ATG group), while 51 patients received ATG (ATG group; Thymoglobuline* in all cases) as part of the MAC regimen. Except for a signifi cantly higher number of allelic differences between recipient and donor (33% vs. 13%; P=0.002), the no-ATG and ATG groups were strictly comparable. With a median follow-up of 30.3 (range, 2.6-68.1) months, grade 0-1 and 2-4 acute GVHD occurred in 74 (46%) and 88 patients (54%) respectively, with grade 3-4 acute GVHD being signifi cantly lower in the ATG group (18% vs. 32%; P=0.04). Limited and extensive chronic GVHD were observed in 22 and 25% of assessable patients respectively, with extensive chronic GVHD being signifi cantly lower in the ATG group (5% vs. 33%; P=0.001). Interestingly, patients from the ATG group had a higher incidence of limited chronic GVHD (33% vs. 18%; P=0.06). Moreover, infection-related mortality was comparable between both groups (23% vs. 27%, P=NS). Also, NRM was comparable between both groups (30% vs. 29%; P=NS). In multivariate analysis, an HLA allelic mismatch and the non-use of ATG were associated with an increased risk of grade 3-4 acute GVHD (RR=2.80, 95%CI, 1.5-5.3, P=0.001; and RR=2.4, 95%CI, 1.1-5.0, P=0.02 respectively). Similarly, multivariate analysis showed that the absence of use of ATG was the unique parameter associated with an increased risk of extensive chronic GVHD (RR=6.9; 95%CI, 1.7-29.0, P=0.008). Finally, LFS and OS at 2 years were not signifi cantly different between the no-ATG and ATG group (48.8% vs. 41.3%, P=NS; and 53.6% vs. 54.3%, P=NS; respectively). These results suggest a global long-term benefi cial effect of ATG when used as part of the MAC regimen prior to allo-SCT from MUD (especially in the HLA mismatch setting). Such protective effect of ATG against severe GVHD can be likely achieved without an increased risk of infections or leukemia recurrence.",

Herzberg (2) The NIH staging and response criteria offer for the fi rst time the chance for uniform documentation of chronic graft-versushost disease (cGVHD) but require prospective evaluation with regard to clinical relevance and impact on QoL. We present the results of a German multicenter trial on the NIH staging criteria in cGVHD. One-hundred-forty-seven patients (median age 44 years, range 18-64) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies were evaluated according to the NIH criteria based cGVHD activity assessment, the Lee chronic GVHD Symptom-Scale (L-cGVHD-SC), FACT-BMT, HAP (human activity profi le), SF36, Berlin Social Support Scale (BSSS), 24 Item Adjective Measure (24-AM), HADS, and the NCCN-Distress-Thermometer. Enrolment occurred between day 100 and 1 year after HSCT or in the presence of active cGVHD also at later time points. Follow-up surveys were conducted at 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12 and 18 months after baseline survey. At all time points disease status, comorbidities and medication were documented. Ninety-eight patients had cGVHD (mild n=30, moderate n=43, severe n=25) including patients with mild (n=18), moderate (n=11) and severe (n=1) bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). Forty nine patients had no cGVHD. Multiple regression analysis revealed that severity of cGVHD (\u00df=0.27, p=0.01), grade of distress measured by the distress thermometer (\u00df=0.28, p<0.01) and extraverted personality (\u00df= -0.27, p<0.01) signifi cantly correlated with QoL as measured by the FACT-BMT. The HAP-maximum activity score correlated inversely with severity of cGVHD (\u00df= -0.25, p=0.015). Male sex (\u00df=0.24, p=0.02) as well as conscientious personality (\u00df=0.24, p=0.02) correlated positively with the HAP-maximum activity score. Evaluation of the impact of specifi c organ manifestations of cGVHD on QoL and the activity profi le detected a signifi cant negative impact of BO on the activity profi le (p<0.01) as well as QoL (p<0.001) already at an organ stage grade 2 which was not detectable in specifi c other organ manifestations. BO correlated signifi cantly (p<0.01) with impairment in the breath, eye, and energy subscale of the L-cGVHD-SC as well as with eye involvement of cGVHD (p=0.02). The results demonstrate, that severity of cGVHD as assessed by the NIH consensus grading correlates with impairment of physical functioning as well as QoL. The special weight of BO grade 2 in the overall grading of cGVHD is justifi ed by its impact on QOL and the activity profi le. Introduction: Allogenic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) is associated with functional impairment and psychological stress. Although quality of live (QOL) issues after alloHSCT are increasingly evaluated, little is known about suitable measurements for the physical performance and its impact on the mental status. Methods and Patients: 41 patients receiving an alloHSCT for hematologic malignancies (n=40) or aplastic anaemia (n=1) were evaluated for physical functioning before (t1), one month (t2) and 3 months (t3) after alloHSCT. The median age was 45 years (range 16-69 yrs). The conditioning regime was standard myeloablative (n=9), toxicity reduced myeloablative (n=30), or non-myeloablative (n=2). Twenty one patients developed no acute GVHD (aGVHD) and ten patients developed aGVHD grade 1-2 (n=4), grade 3-4 (n=6). Six patients died from GVHD (n=2), relapse (n=2) or infection (n=2). The grip strength test was performed using a JAMAR dynamometer, 13 muscle groups were tested with the CITEC dynamometer, conditional status was tested with the two minute walk test. QOL was assessed using the HAP, the SF36, the HADS, the FACT-BMT, the BFI and the MFIS questionnaires. Results: A signifi cant loss of grip strength (t2) (p=0.005) and a signifi cant (p=0.04) lower grip strength in patients with GVHD (t3) was detected. The median muscle strength (t3) (in % of t1) of the upper limb was 106% (75-132%) and for the lower limb 103% (77-130%) for patients without GVHD and 72% (43-186%) of the upper and 88% (63-171%) of the lower limb for patients with GVHD (no GVHD vs. GVHD for upper limb p=0.04). The walking distance (t2) median 152 m (60-240) was signifi cant shorter compared to (t1) median 165 m (96-231) (p=0.004). Patients with GVHD had signifi cant higher scores for anxiety (p=0.02), depression (p=0.004) and fatigue (p=0.009) (t3). The depression values correlated inversely with the HAP adjusted activity score (AAS) (t1) (r=-0.6, p=0.0001), (t2) (r=-0.5, p=0.04), (t3) (r=-0.6, p=0.005). The fatique sum score (BFI) inversely correlated with the AAS (t1) (r= -0.4, p=0.01), (t2) (r=-0.4, p=0.05), t3 (r=-0.7, p=0.0001). Conclusion: AlloHSCT leads to a loss of physical functioning especially during time of hospitalisation. The presence of GVHD leads to pronounced physical impairment and psychological distress like depression and fatigue. Strategies to care for the physical impairment as well as the psychological status of the patients are essential.",

Mohty CHU H\u00f4tel-Dieu (Nantes, FR) Acute GVHD remains a matter of concern after RIC allo-SCT, especially when using HLA-matched unrelated donors (MUD). Thus, the rapidly increasing use in elderly and high risk patients and evolving nature of RIC allo-SCT, emphasize the need for renewed clinical research of GVHD prophylaxis. This pilot report investigated Prophylaxis with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and cyclosporine (CsA) combination in comparison to CsA alone for GVHD prophylaxis in 35 consecutive patients with hematological malignancies receiving RIC allo-SCT from a MUD, and treated within the same period in a single institution. In this series, the median age was 52 years (range, 6-64; 20 males). The RIC regimen included fl udarabine, busulfan and ATG in all patients (with minor adjustments in 3 patients). The fi rst patients from this series (n=19; \"CsA\" group) received CsA alone for GVHD prophylaxis. The next patients (n=16; \"CsA+MMF\" group) received CsA and MMF. MMF was given at a fi xed oral dose of 1 g x 2/day without any treatment adjustment to blood levels. The two groups showed no signifi cant differences as for demographic and disease features, GVHD risk factors, and allo-SCT procedure characteristics (except for GVHD prophylaxis). 31 patients (89%) received a 10/10 HLA matched graft at the allelic level. One allelic mismatch was observed in 4 cases, with this being comparable between the two groups. 3 patients from this series did not engraft (early disease recurrence) and were not evaluable for acute GVHD. ANC >500/\u00b5L was achieved at a median of 19 (range, 0-27) days. The cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD at day 100 was 67% (95%CI, 45-89%) in patients receiving CsA alone as compared to 53% (95%CI, 28-78%) in those receiving the CsA and MMF combination (P=NS). However, the cumulative incidence of grade 3-4 acute GVHD was signifi cantly lower in the \"CsA+MMF\" group as compared to the \"CsA\" group (13% vs. 56%; P=0.03). After a median followup of 19.5 (range, 9-93) months for surviving patients, the one year overall survival was signifi cantly higher in the \"CsA+MMF\" group (81% vs. 47%; P=0.03). Overall, 4 deaths were attributed to refractory acute GVHD in the \"CsA\" group versus none in the \"CsA+MMF\" group. Though a randomized trial is needed before drawing fi nal conclusions, this pilot study suggests that adjunction of MMF to CsA can result in a signifi cant reduction of the incidence of severe acute GVHD following ATG-based RIC allo-SCT using MUD, and this may have a signifi cant impact on the probability of a favorable outcome. The objective of this study is to investigate the infl uence of the Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR) gene KIR2DS3 in Haemopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). HLA and KIR genes are located on different chromosomes so genetic identity is not guaranteed. Thus the KIR gene and MHC-CI ligand may be mismatched even in HLA-identical related transplants. As yet the ligand for KIR2DS3 is unknown. The study population included 177 consecutive HSC transplants for adult HLA-identical recipient and sibling donors performed between January 1998 and July 2005. The method used to identify the KIR genes was molecular genotyping by Luminex LABType\u00ae PCR-SSO system. Data were analysed by correlation to established clinical endpoints of HSCT outcome. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to enable comparison of overall survival rates, Cox Regression analysis used to allow for covariates in our model, determining their signifi cance and relative risk. Cross tabulation tables were used to analyse the relationship and signifi cance between variables by Chi-square or Fisher's Exact Test. Results: Presence of 2DS3 in the donor adversely infl uenced overall survival (OS) from 65% if negative for the gene to 45% when positive for the gene (p = 0.02, RR 1.3). To identify a potential ligand for KIR2DS3 investigations into the HLA type of the recipients transplanted with 2DS3 positive donors were performed. Although no signifi cant alleles of interest were found, poorer outcome was seen in C1 group positive individuals. A search was made of the common HLA-Cw allele sequences in an attempt to fi nd shared epitopes in those recipients whose survival outcome was reduced. Sites were identifi ed but none were of signifi cance as possible ligands. Combined factors; presence of KIR2DS3 in the donor and recipient CMV serostatus were analysed and showed signifi cant improved OS of 76% when both parameters were negative compared to all other combinations when OS was reduced by up to 33% (p = 0.025). Signifi cantly the presence of KIR2DS3 in the donor and severity of chronic GvHD showed that recipients experiencing mild chronic GvHD, regardless of donor 2DS3 status, have an OS of 73%, but the presence of the 2DS3 gene in the donor reduces OS from 57% to 20% in the presence of severe chronic GvHD (p = 0.024).",

Prospective KIR genotyping should be performed to exclude this gene in future HSCT donor selection. Background: Microvessel injury is associated with the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), whereas high levels of post-transplant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have a protective effect on severe acute GVHD (aGVHD) and transplant-related mortality. The current study aimed to determine the impact of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the risk of acute GVHD following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Methods: Four VEGF gene SNPs were analyzed in 98 recipients using PCR/RFLP, i.e., -2578 C>A (rs699947), -460 T>C (rs833061), +405 G>C (rs2010963) and +936 C>T (rs3025039). Results: Strong linkage disequilibrium was noted between loci -2578, -460 and +405, but not between these and +936. Accordingly, 4 haplotypes were generated based on the genotypes of -2578, -460, and +405 as follows: CTC (47.9%), CTG (26.7%), ACG (24.2%), and CCC (1.0%). The group with low producibility of VEGF (i.e., +936CT genotype and 2 copies of the ACG haplotype) showed a higher incidence of acute GVHD: A signifi cant association was noted between the risk of grade 2-4 aGVHD and the + 936 CT (p=0.006), the -2578 AA (p=0.003), and the -460 CC (p=0.002) genotypes, and the ACG haplotype (p=0.003). No association was observed between the VEGFA gene SNPs and chronic GVHD. Conclusion: The VEGFA gene SNPs might predict a lower risk of acute GVHD. The current result suggests that VEGF might play a protective role in the pathogenesis of acute GVHD.",

Doubek, Z. Racil, Z. Koristek, M. Navratil, M. Tomiska, J. Vorlicek University Hospital Brno (Brno, CZ) Background: Corticosteroid-resistant acute GVHD is diffi cult to manage, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. No standard treatment exists. We had previously seen encouraging results with pulse cyclophosphamide (Cy) in the treatment of liver GVHD in contrast to gastrointestinal GVHD, and we report here the long-term results of pulse Cy for the treatment of steroid-refractory liver GVHD, with no association to the gut. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 21 patients (pts) with hematological malignancies after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Twelve pts had acute GVHD (2 pts grade I, 3 pts grade II, 7 pts grade III), 4 pts had chronic extensive GVHD and 5 pts developed liver GVHD upon DLI. Two pts had only liver GvHD, 19 pts had GVHD with involvement of liver and/or oral mucosa, and/or skin. All pts had hepatitic variant of liver GVHD (serum aminotransferase ALT or AST elevation > 10 times the upper normal limit), classical GVHD with elevation of bilirubine was observed at 9/21 pts. All pts were treated by cyclosporine A and steroids in dose 2 mg/kg before pulse Cy, fi ve pts had another previous therapy (mycophenolate mofetil, alemtuzumab). Steroid-refractory GVHD was defi ned as the lack of response to steroids administered for at least 5 consecutive days. Cy was infused at a dose of 1000 mg/m\u00b2. Twenty-nine Cy administrations were given in 21 pts. The median time of GVHD onset and Cy administration after transplantation, or DLI, were 58 and 69 days, respectively. Results: Eleven pts (52%) achieved CR and 6 pts (29%) achieved PR. Four pts (19%) did not respond, however their condition stabilized and upon additional therapy, 3 achieved PR and one CR. Leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia WHO grade 4 developed after 5 Cy pulses, it was usually short-lived with a median of 7 days. Twelve infectious complications occurred in 8 of 21 pts, all of them resolved after antimicrobial therapy. Neither other signifi cant toxicity after Cy pulse nor infl uence of pulse Cy therapy to chimerism or disease status were observed. Three pts died, all deaths were without direct relationship to pulse Cy. Overall survival of all 21 pts is 86% with median and maximal follow-up of 33 and 81 months, respectively. Conclusion: Pulse Cy is an effective treatment for steroid-refractory liver GVHD with overall response rate 81% and remarkably good toxicity profi le, which may favor its use instead of drugs with more pronounced immunosuppressive effects.",

Holtick (1) Graft versus Host disease (GvHD) is the major limitation to successful allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and contributes signifi cantly to transplant related mortality and morbidity. Steroid refractory or steroid dependent GvHD in particular is linked to poor survival and poor quality of life. Conventional immunosuppression has limited success in these conditions and increases susceptibility to infection and relapse. Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) is a promising therapy for acute and chronic GvHD in patients not responding to conventional immunosuppression. ECP mechanisms are still poorly understood and although a number of studies using ECP treatment for conditions including acute and chronic GvHD have been published, there is limited data on the variations in blood cell subsets post ECP therapy. In a phase II clinical trial, ten patients with steroid refractory chronic GvHD were treated with ECP. Monocyte, T cell, NK cell and dendritic cell subsets were analysed by fl ow cytometry prior to ECP and, at cycle two, six and three months after the end of ECP treatment. The overall response rate to ECP in this study was 70% (3 Complete responders, 4 partial responders and 3 non-responders). A statistically signifi cant increase (p<0.05, Mann-Whitney test) during ECP treatment and follow-up could be detected for total numbers of CD4+ T cells, regulatory T cells (CD4+ CD25bright foxP3+), CCR4+ CD4+ (Th2) cells and dendritic cells (lin-HLA-DR+). Interestingly, the percentage of CD16+ CD14dim monocytes was signifi cantly increased only in patients who responded to ECP treatment. There were no signifi cant changes in numbers or percentages of NK/NK-T cell and CD8+/CD4+ effector/memory/na\u00efve subsets. In summary, the results suggest that ECP treatment alters the composition of immune cell subsets and switches the blood cell compartment towards a regulatory immune repertoire. The role of CD16+ monocytes, which were only found to be increased in patients responding to ECP, needs further investigation. An immune monitoring platform has been established in Cologne to identify cellular subsets of importance for immune responses after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",

Kolb Ludwig-Maximilians-University (Munich, DE) Acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) still remains one major cause of morbidity and mortality following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, especially in patients, who do not respond to corticosteroid therapy. We report a retrospective analysis using extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) for second line treatment of steroid refractory acute GvHD in 30 patients. 8 patients (26,7%) received hematopoietic stem cells from a sibling HLA-identical donor, 10 patients (33,3%) from an unrelated HLA-identical donor, 2 patients (6,7%) from a sibling mismatched donor and 10 patients (33,3%) from a mismatched unrelated donor. Refractoriness to corticosteroids was defi ned as progression or persistence of GvHD after treatment with methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg every 8 hours over a period of 3 days. Median duration of ECP was 54 days (range 8 -227 days) with a frequency of two applications per week until clinical response and every second week thereafter. 9 out of 30 patients (30,0%) suffered from acute GvHD grade 2, 11 patients (36,7%) from grade 3 and 10 patients (33,3%) from grade IV. Clinical signs of acute GvHD occurred after a median time of 20 days post transplantation (range 9 -160 days). Median duration from onset of acute GvHD until start of ECP was 18 days (range 1 -102 days). Complete response (CR) was defi ned as discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy following ECP, partial response (PR) as reduction to a maximum of 10mg per day and minor response (MR) was reduction by 50%. No possibility of steroid reduction or a reduction less than 50% was named no response (NR). Using these criteria 11 patients (36,7%) reached a CR, 9 patients (30,0%) a PR and 4 patients (13,3%) a PR. 6 patients (20,0%) did not respond (NR). Transplant related mortality (TRM) on day 100 was 6,7% (2 out of 30 patients). One additional patient died because of relapse. One year after transplantation 11 of 25 evaluable patients (44,0%) have died because of transplant related complications. Based on our four response groups the TRM after one year was 9,1% in the CR group, 22,2% in the PR group, 50,0% in the MR group and 100% in the NR group respectively. Overall survival (OS) after a follow up time between 45 and 994 days was 53,3% and median OS 304 days. In conclusion ECP is a promising and valuable therapeutic option for treatment of patients with steroid refractory GvHD. To assess the real benefi t a randomized prospective trial should be performed.",

Papanicolaou (Thessaloniki, GR) Conventional intensifi ed immunosuppressive therapy for refractory chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGvHD) increases mortality and relapse rates after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. We retrospectively studied the effi cacy and safety of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) in 44 patients with corticoid-resistant cGvHD. Thirty-seven patients received grafts from siblings and 7 from matched unrelated donors. Cyclosporine or tacrolimus and methotrexate\u00b1ATG were administered as GvHD prophylaxis. Patients had received 2(1-4) lines of treatment for 13 months (median) before ECP. Ten patients had developed induced cGvHD post immunotherapy. Fifteen patients had mucocutaneous disease only, 9 cutaneous sclerosis manifestations, 13 visceral involvement and 7 patients skin sclerosis and liver. Patients completed a median number of 23 sessions of ECP/patient. The therapeutic schedule included 2 sessions per week for 1 month followed according to the severity of cGvHD, by either a) one session per week for 2 months and 1 per 15 days for 2 months or b) 1 session per 15 days for 4 months, and then both cohorts received 1 session per month for 4-8 months. Response was evaluated at 3 months and at the end of the treatment. Five patients died due to early complications (<40 days): 2 early deaths occurred due to GvHD or disease progression and 3 deaths due to existing infections before ECP. Response at 3 months was 72% (28/39): 90% in patients with mucocutaneous disease, 62% with skin sclerosis, 58% with visceral disease and 83% with cutaneous sclerosis and liver manifestations. The cGvHD relapsed in 9/28(32%) in 2(1-15) months. Stable response was 48% (19/39) and 15 of 39 patients do not receive any immunosupression. In multivariate analysis only visceral involvement affected the duration of response. Patients with de novo cGvHD seemed to respond better. In terms of immunological reconstitution, a 40% increase of CD4+ cells was observed after 12 months of treatment. Infections (gr? 3 WHO) were seen in 12 patients without any mortality. No relapse of the underlying disease was documented. The 5-year disease free survival from the beginning of ECP was 80% with a median follow-up of 20 months. High response rates with acceptable toxicity and a low incidence of relapse of the underlying disease establishes the role of ECP as a new, reliable therapeutic strategy in the treatment of resistant cGvHD in earlier phase.",

Soci\u00e9 H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis -APHP (Paris, FR) Objectives: Current grading systems in acute GVHD can not effectively identify patients with poor prognosis at time of GVHD diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical or biological parameters at the onset of GVHD associated with poor prognosis of acute GVHD. Methods: The study sample was composed of 146 patients (pts) who developed acute GVHD among the 257 who received an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) after a myeloablative conditioning regimen between 1993 and 1999. Patients with acute GVHD were retrospectively analyzed for risk factors associated with NRM using proportional cause-specifi c hazards models. Initial and maximal GVHD grade per organ (liver, skin, gut) were recorded, as well as albuminemia. Characteristics of patients: Median age was 32 years (from 4 to 60 years). Source of stem cell was bone marrow in 106, peripheral blood stem cells in 23 and cord blood in 13 pts. 87 patients received SCT from an HLA-identical sibling donor. Results: At time of diagnosis, GVHD involved a single organ in the majority of the patients (109 pts, 78%): skin for 63, gut for 35, liver for 11 pts. 37 patients had multiple organs affected by GVHD: 34 patients had 2 organs and 3 had 3 organs. Initial grade was I in 60 pts (23%), II in 83 pts (32%) and III in 3 pts (1%). Maximal grade was I in 31 pts, II in 72, III or IV in 43 pts. Overall 1-year NRM was 54.9% (95%CI 46.6-63.2). 57 patients experienced progression or stability 7 days after corticosteroids initiation and were considered as \"non-responders\" (NR). Signifi cant (p < 0.05) risk factors for 5-y NRM were non sibling donor (71% vs. 54%), absence of methotrexate in GVHD prophylaxis (75% vs. 56%), initial liver involvement (80% vs. gut only: 54%, skin > grade I: 50%) and NR (85% vs. 44%). Patients who were responder to corticosteroids had same 5-y NRM than patients who did not develop any GVHD. Albumin level (alb) was associated with NRM in patients with initial gut involvement in pts with alb > or = 35 and 61. 1% [37.4-84.8] in pts with alb < 35 gr/L, p=0.035). In multivariate analysis, initial liver involvement (HR: 2.45 (1.46 to 4.12), p=0.0007) and a non-sibling donor (HR: 1.58 (1.02 to 2.43, p= 0.0039) were both associated with NRM. Conclusion: Initial liver involvement was the most important clinical predictor and may be considered in clinical management and need prospective validation.",

Despite intensive prophylaxis with immunosuppressive agents, the incidence of GvHD occurs in 9-50% of patients undergoing transplant with an identical HLA sibling matched donor and 75% of patients undergoing unrelated HLA donors. Currently, diagnosis of GvHD is based mainly on evaluation of clinical symptoms including skin rash, diarrhoea and elevation of serum liver enzymes. To date, no validated biomarkers have been established for chronic GVHD, although several candidate biomarkers have been identifi ed. The aim of this study was to characterize a number of candidate biomarkers in the serum of patients pre and post HSCT with and without GvHD. Expression of the biomarkers were also analysed using the skin explant model. Blood samples were collected from patients during pre-conditioning therapy (7 days prior to HSCT) and at 0, 14, 28 days 3,6,12 months post transplant. From the nine candidate biomarkers (BAFF, IL-33, hTLA1, APRIL, Omentin, RANKL, OPG, NALP3, NALP1) tested, the results identifi ed two molecules, BAFF and IL-33 as potential GvHD markers which may be suitable for potential disease management. BAFF (B cell activation factor) is a key regulator of B cell homeostasis and is also involved in regulation of T cell function. BAFF has been shown to be elevated in autoimmune disorders and in cGvHD patients. Likewise, our results showed serum BAFF levels were signifi cantly higher in patients with extensive cGvHD (p<0.04). Furthermore, analysis using the skin explant model showed BAFF expression was signifi cantly increased in patients with GvHR (p<0.04), confi rming the ELISA results. IL-33 is a member of the Interleukin 1 family, involved in infl ammation, host defence and immune regulation. IL-33 is a ST2 receptor ligand, upon binding it activates Th 2 cells, resulting in the release of Th 2 cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13. Our results showed that patients who developed GvHD had higher IL-33 levels compared to control patients without GvHD. A second independent cohort is currently being tested. The results suggest these two potential biomarkers may present a novel option of predicting the development of GvHD.",

            "text": "Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a signifi cant impediment to successful allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), particularly in patients not responding to primary therapy with steroids. There is no a good salvage therapy for steroidrefractory aGVHD. Based on prior reports, we conducted a multicenter phase II study to investigate the safety and effi cacy of the anti-CD52 antibody, alemtuzumab, in the treatment of steroid-refractory aGVHD > grade II. The treatment schedule consisted of alemtuzumab 10 mg/d intravenously for 5 consecutive days followed by 10 mg/d on days 8, 15 and 22 if a complete resolution of aGVHD manifestations was not achieved. Response was assessed at days 7, 14, 21, 28 and at the last follow-up after initiation of alemtuzumab. Ten patients (7 male / 3 women; median age 57 years, range 19-65) were included in the study. Six patients had received an unrelated SCT and in 7 cases a reduced intensity conditioning regimen was used. At study entry, 6 patients had grade III and 4 had grade IV aGVHD; the IBMTR severity index was B in 3 patients, C in 2, and D in 5. Eight patients had 2 or 3 involved organs: gastrointestinal (GI) tract in 9, skin in 7, and liver in 5 patients. Median time from aGVHD diagnosis to alemtuzumab therapy was 8 days (range 4-22). All but one patient, who died on day 4 after treatment initiation, received 5 consecutive doses of alemtuzumab, 4 patients received the day 8 dose, and 2 patients completed the scheduled treatment. Main reasons to stop treatment were impairment of patient performance status or aGVHD progression. Five (55%) patients responded to treatment (2 CR and 3 PR). Eight infectious events (4 of them grade 3-4) and 7 CMV reactivations were observed. Grade 3-4 cytopenias occurred in 6 patients. Nine patients died of aGVHD progression (n=7) and/ or severe infections (n=2) after a median of 40 days (range 4-93); one patient in CR died due to relapse of acute myeloblastic leukaemia on day +188. According to these results, the study was prematurely closed. Overall, our results suggest that steroid-refractory severe aGVHD may be improved upon alemtuzumab treatment. However, alemtuzumab does not overcome the dismal prognosis of patients with severe, steroid-refractory aGVHD, this pointing out to the necessity of alternative, more effective therapies for this clinical situation.",

            "text": "Polymorphisms of MTHFR and clinical outcomes in allogeneic stem cell transplantation P. Chiusolo, S. Bellesi, S. Giammarco, S. Marietti, D. De Ritis, E Metafuni, S. DeMattteis, G. Leone, S. Sica Universit\u00e0 Cattolica S. Cuore (Rome, IT) Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate drug used to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Its function is due to inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase and limitation of function of other enzymes like MTHFR. It is well known that MTHFR 677 polymorphisms results in reduced activity of this enzyme and that the use of MTX in patients with 677 CT/TT variations may infl uence side effects like mucositis and bone marrow toxicity. Samples of 47 pts submitted to alloSCT from 2002 and respective donors were analyzed for 677CT polymorphism. Pts'characteristics were: 30M/17F, median age 37years (range10-58). Underlying disease were 23 AML, 17 ALL, 2 IMF, 2 SAA, 2 CML and 1 CLL. In 39 case pts were submitted to standard conditioning regimen and in 8 cases pts were submitted to reduced intensity conditioning regimen. All pts were submitted to GVHD prophylaxis with CSA and short-course MTX. Stem cell source was BM in 5pts, PBSC in 38pts and CBU in 4pts. The donor were HLA identical siblings or parents in 32 cases and MUD in 11 pts. All CBU were unrelated. Seven pts died early after tx (14.8%) at a median time of 45d (range 30-90) for progression of disease. Twenty-two out of 47 (46.8%) developed hepatic toxicity and the median time for PMN (>0.5x109/L) and PLT (>20x109/L) recovery was respectively 20 and 15 days (range 10-48 and 11-55days). Twenty-two pts developed aGVHD grade II-IV at a median time of 26d after tx (range 10-70). Twenty-fi ve pts relapsed after tx at a median time of 4 months (range 1-34). At this time 24pts are alive with a median follow-up of 31 months (range 1-51). OS, RFS, NRM and GVHD curves were obtained by the Kaplan Meier method and statistically compared by log-rank test; while incidence of toxicities was evaluated with chi2test. Our data revealed that there was no correlation between 677CT polymorphisms and development of hepatic toxicity and/or delayed engraftment (chi2test=ns); aGVHD was significantly correlated with CC polymorphism in the donor (p=0.05) and there was a trend toward a lower incidence of aGVHD in pts with TT polymorphism. Regarding NRM at 100days after tx we found a strong correlation with CC polymorphism in pts (p=0.006), whilst we found a trend toward a higher incidence of relapse in pts with TT polymorphisms. We conclude that greater immunosuppressive effect of MTX due to low MTHFR enzyme activity in mutated pts (TT) decreases the risk of GVHD but increases the risk of relapse. Backgound: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a kind of infl ammation, endothelialitis, in terms of target organ damage. RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) as chemokine plays an important role in the pathogenesis of GVHD. Kruppel-like factor (KLF) 13 is one of key regulators in RANTES expression. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of KLF13 genetic polymorphisms and the clinical outcomes in patients treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: Candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with acute GVHD were selected using 100K DNA chip analysis in 8 patients with acute GVHD and 7 patients without acute GVHD, after allogeneic HSCT. Medical records of 251 patients with HSCT in Seoul National University Hospital between 1997 and 2006 were reviewed. Results: The KLF13 polymorphisms, rs4779682, rs11070980, and rs4779520, were genotyped in 251 patients with allogeneic HSCT. Out of 3 SNPs, rs4779520 which has mutation within 3' UTR was proven to be associated with acute GVHD incidence, especially acute liver and gut GVHD. Acute GVHD incidence was signifi cant higher for the patients with CC genotype of rs4779520 than other genotypes (p=0.0086, HR=2.6584). TT genotype and co-dominant genotype of rs4779682 (p=0.0164, p=0.0293, respectively), which is an mutation within intron 1, had statistically signifi cant relevance to the increase of venoocculsive disease, and CC genotype of rs4779682 showed higher treatment-related mortality compared with other genotypes (p=0.0306, HR=1.781). However, there was no signifi cant difference in relapse-free survival and overall survival according to KLF 13 polymorphisms. Conclusion: As the fi rst clinical study for the KLF13 genetic polymorphisms, this study suggested that KLF13 polymorphisms would have the clinical value as a predictive parameter of acute GVHD, veno-occulsive disease, and treatment-related mortality after allogeneic HSCT, through the regulation of RANTES expression. Background: Very recently, encouraging results indicate that third party human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) are a therapeutic tool for the treatment of severe steroid resistant acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD). We have established a highly effi cient protocol for in vitro expansion, under strict GMP compliance, of bone marrow derived hMSCs using human platelet lysate (hPL) in place of FBS. In this study, upon Ethical Committee approval and patient's informed consent, hMSCs were administered on a compassionate basis for the treatment of refractory GVHD. Methods: hMSCs were prepared from washouts of bags and fi lters of bone marrow collection, from third party HLA-mismatched healthy donors. Cells were grown in the presence of DMEM with 5% hPL. In a short period of time (10-33 days), low density seeding of unmanipulated cells (100-200/cm 2 ), obtained from 7 bone marrow harvests, allowed to prepare large quantities of hMSCs, with only one in vitro passage. Results: 4 adults and 1 pediatric patients were treated for aGVHD (grade III-IV) and 1 adult and 2 pediatric patients for extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD), using 18 hMSCs certifi ed bags. Before hMSCs, second or third line treatments had been given to patients with aGVHD, including Etanercept (n=4), Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF, n=3) and Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP, n=2). Patients with cGVHD were previously treated with ECP (n=3), MMF (n=3), Imatinib (n=1), Rituximab (n=1) and Etanercept (n=2). Each infusion contained a median dose of 1x10 6 /kg (range 0.7-1.2x10 6 ) hMSCs. As far as concerns patients with aGVHD, a single infusion was performed in the pediatric patient, while from 1 to 4 infusions were performed in 4 adult patients. The 3 patients with cGVHD received from 1 to 5 infusions. All infusions were very well tolerated with no immediate or late adverse events according to WHO common criteria. Among pediatric patients, 3/3 complete responses were registered. A complete response was observed in 1 adult with grade III cutaneous aGVHD, although the patient rapidly relapsed and died of leukemia progression. Three partial responses were observed in 3 adults, while only one adult showed no response and died of progressive grade IV gut and liver aGVHD. Conclusions: These data show that large numbers of third party hMSCs can be expanded in vitro with hPL-containing medium. Moreover, the clinical results and the toxicity profi le confi rm those reported with hMSCs expanded in FBS containing media. Background: Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) is thought to be induced by donor T-cells, but mechanisms of cGVHD and the critical cellular subsets remain less well understood. In this study, we analysed T and B cell subsets in 44 patients (pts.) after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Methods: Peripheral blood samples from 12 pts. who never experienced cGVHD (group 1) and 12 pts. with resolved (group 2) and 20 pts. with active cGVHD (group 3) were analysed for lymphocyte subsets by FACS. Chronic GVHD was evaluated using criteria and guidelines of the National Institute of Health. Results: The absolute CD19+ B cell count (in Gpt/l) in cGVHD pts. was subnormal (group 2: median 0.14, range 0.008-0.69; group 3: median 0.01, range 0.001-2.59); normal limits: 0.2-0.4 gpt/l) and less than that of group 1 (median 0.237, range 0.05-0.55). Furthermore relative and absolute numbers of the CD27-B cell compartment, which include immature and transitional B cells, were lower in cGVHD pts. (group 2: 78%, median 0.12Gpt/l, range 0-0.66Gpt/l; group 3: 68%, median 0.01Gpt/l, range 0 -2.53Gpt/l) compared to pts. of group 1 (90%, median 0.20 Gpt/l, range 0.05-0.52Gpt/l). Although the relative number S134 of cells of the CD 27+ memory B cell compartment was highest in the active cGVHD-group (22%) versus group 1 (10%) and 2 (12%) due to the lower CD19+ B cell count (in Gpt/l), the absolute number was lower in group 3 (median 0.02, range 0-0.96) compared to pts. of group 1 (median 0.17, range 0.04-0.65 gpt/l) and group 2 (median: 0.14, range 0-0.8). CD 27+IgD+IgM\u00b1cells (in 10E6/l) could not detected in pts. with active cGVHD (except one patient with isolated cGVHD of the oral mucosa and dry eyes) (5%, median 0, range 0-66.6) in contrast to pts. of group 1 (20%, median 1.69, range 0-6.26) and group 2 (18%, median 1.23, range 0-10.53). No differences in absolute CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers as well as regulatory T cells were observed between the three groups.",

Koenig, A. Weltermann, D. Lutz Elisabethinen Hospital (Linz, AT) Current concepts suggest a major role for innate immunity in the initiation of graft-vs.-host-disease (GvH-D) as well as in Crohn's disease (CD). Identical single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been described as risk factors for both diseases. Recently, the noncoding C/T polymorphism rs2274910 in intron 3 of the intelectin 1 (ITLN1) gene (human lactoferrin receptor) has been associated with CD. Thus, we tested whether this polymorphism of the ITLN1 gene is also associated with gut GvH-D. We retrospectively typed this polymorphism by TaqMan PCR from peripheral blood from AML patients and their donors. A pilot study of 19 patients in 1st CR transplanted from HLA identical sibling donors after myeloablative conditioning was confi rmed in a second cohort including all other AML patients (n=40). A total of 59 consecutive patients (median age 43 yrs (18-63); 31/28 female/male, 25/34 1st CR/advanced disease; 40 myeloablative and 19 reduced intensity conditioning; 54 peripheral stem cells) were tested. T-alleles were found at a frequency of 28.8% in recipients and 29.7% in donors. 50.8% of patients had a CC genotype. In the pilot study, 2 out of 12 patients with a CC genotype versus 5 out of 7 patients with a T allele had acute intestinal GvH-D (P=.045). These results were confi rmed in a second cohort. Acute intestinal GvH-D was found in 3/18 patients (16.7%) with a CC genotype and 12/22 patients (54.5%) with a T-allele (P = .014). In a combined analysis (n=59) we found acute intestinal GvH-D in 58.6% of patients with a T-allele versus 16.7% of patients with a CC genotype (P < .001). The lower incidence of acute GvH-D grades II-IV in patients with a CC genotype (logrank P = .019) was only due to less intestinal GvH-D while no difference was seen with regard to skin or liver GvH-D. We did not see any association between donor genotypes and GvH-D. The strong association (RR 3.52; between this SNP and the incidence of acute intestinal GvH-D is in accordance with reports about SNPs in other genes associated with both acute GvH-D and CD. Surprisingly, we found a higher incidence of GvH-D in patients with a T allele while the reported risk allele for CD is the C allele. Our results further support the concept of an interaction between the gut associated innate immune system and GvH-D.",

Roesch, G.-N. Franke, T. Lange, T. Aigner, D. Niederwieser, N. Basara University of Leipzig (Leipzig, DE) Objectives: Acute GvHD remains often a severe complication after RIC-HCT. We report here the predictive value of bone marrow and intestinal eosinophilia in patients transplanted from 1999 to 2005 by using RIC-HCT. Patients and methods: One hundred and fi fteen patients (55 female) with haematological malignancies with the median age of 59 years (range 21 to 75) were treated with RIC-HCT for AML (n=76), ALL (n=7), CML (n=13) and MDS (n=19). Conditioning regimen consisted of 2 Gy total body irradiation at day 0 and fl udarabine (30 mg/m 2 ) at day -4 to -2 followed by treatment with MMF and CSA. Grafts were obtained from related (n=30), allele matched unrelated (n=76) or mismatched (n=9) donors. Bone marrow and peripheral blood evaluation was performed before and on day +28 after RIC-SCT; Eosinophilia was graduated from 0 to 4. Systematic colon and/or duodenal biopsies have been performed immediately after fi rst symptoms of gut GvHD. Analytic counts were performed for tissue eosinophils within the lamina propria and lamina submucosa. Results: The incidence of acute GvHD was 51% (36% grade 1, 27% grade 2, 15% grade 3 and 22% grade 4 out of it). Most of the patients developed one organ aGVHD (skin n=36, gut n=4, liver n=2). Two-organ aGvHD was diagnosed in 10 patients (skin and liver n=8, liver and gut n=2) and tree-organ aGvHD in 7 patients. The amount of bone marrow eosinophils was increased after RIC-SCT in comparison to before HCT (6% vs 3,4%, p<0,001, respectively). Bone marrow eosinophilia after RIC-SCT was found in 66% of patients with aGvHD and was a signifi cant predictive factor (p>0.03) for developing aGvHD. However, eosinophil density did not correlated with aGvHD severity. Peripheral blood eosinophilia was not predictive for developing aGvHD. Intestinal eosinophils were found in 15 of 20 patients with clinical signs of gut GvHD which has been consequently histologically proven in 13 patients (87%, p<0.02). The degranulation of eosinophils, determined by using anti-MBP was present in all patients with gut aGvHD. Conclusions: Both gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow tissue eosinophilia after RIC-HCT predict aGvHD. In addition, gut eosinophil density and degranulation were increased in patients with higher grades of aGvHD thus indicating their role as a biological marker of GvHD. According to our knowledge this is the fi rst study showing that tissue eosinophils density might be a predictive marker for aGvHD after RIC-HCT. The regulatory regions of cytokine polymorphisms (CPs) may modulate the complexity of immunologic response, including acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) in allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplant setting. The imbalance between pro-infl ammatory Th1 cytokine like IL-6, IL-1, IL-2, TNF-a, INFg and Th2 protective IL-4, IL-10, TGF-beta1, promotes donor T cell activation and clonal expansion. The aim of this study was to determine if an association between single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPS of pro-infl ammatory or protective Th1/ Th2 cytokine and severe aGVHD existed in 41 donor and 41 recipient pairs who received an HLA matched sibling bone marrow transplant (BMT). The correlation between IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, and IFN-g cytokine levels in patient sera, and between cytokine genotype, both of which can result high, intermediate or low producer, was also studied. Finally, the frequency of the cytokine haplotypes found in BMT patients was compared with that of 30 Sardinian healthy controls. Subjects and Methods: Forty-one patients and 41 donors were typed for IL-2, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-4, TGF-beta1, TNF-a and IFN-g polymorphisms. Thirty-seven patients underwent BMT for beta-thalassemia major, 1 for acute myelocytic leukemia, 1 for acute lymphocytic leukemia, 1 for congenital neutropenia, and 1 for histiocytosis. II-III\u00b0 aGVHD was observed in 19 patients (46%), while 22 were aGVHD free. Twenty-six sera were collected from 13 patients with aGVHD and 13 without aGVHD, at various transplant times (pre BMT, 15, 30 and 60 days post BMT) and measured in an Elisa assay. Cytokine genotypes were performed using a commercially available kit (SSP Dynal Invitrogen). Results: Signifi cantly higher IL-6 levels were found in the group of patients with aGVHD compared to patients without aGVHD (p <0.03). At 30 and 60 days post BMT the high amount of IL-6 correlated with the IL-6 genotype -174 G/G. Thirteen out of 19 patients with aGVHD compared to 9 out of 22 without aGVHD showed -174G/G polymorphism (p<0.05) in the IL-6 promoter. Conclusions: The frequency of haplotype in the population of transplanted patients, not differed from healthy control. A correlation between the IL-6 -174G/G genotype, the IL-6 high production phenotype and a predisposition to severe aGVHD was observed in our study. These fi ndings could have clinical implications including the use of Tocilizumab (a monoclonal antibody against IL-6) to prevent or cure aGVHD in a targeted manner. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effi cacy of 2 preparations of ATG (ATG-Genzyme Thymoglobulin, ATG-G) and ATG-Fresenius (ATG-F) in two cohorts of transplanted patients in preventing GVHD and rejection, as well as their impact on infections, relapse, and overall survival. Patients and methods: Since July 2005 to November 2008, 50 consecutive patients undergoing myeloablative conditioning from HLA identical or mismatch siblings (n=26) or unrelated donors (n=24), were retrospectively analysed. Underlying diseases were advanced and/or high risk haematologic malignancies Thirty (30) patients received ATG-G at a total dose of 4,5 mg/kg if HLA identical sibling transplants (n = 17) or 6 mg/kg if unrelated transplants (n=13). Twenty (20) patients received ATG-F at a total dose of 15 mg/kg if HLA identical sibling transplants (n=7), or 30 mg/kg if unrelated or mismatched transplants (n=13). Both ATGs were administered on days -3,-2,-1. GVHD prophylaxis was performed with Cyclosporin and sMTX. Groups were comparable as regards age, underlying diseases and conditioning. (Tab 1) Results: Infusion related side effects occurred more frequently in the ATG-G group (80% vs 65%). Time of engraftment was similar. Acute GVHD II-IV occurred in 13% of ATG-G patients versus 15% of ATG-F patients. Two patients rejected in the ATG-G group, none in the ATG-F group. Conclusions: In this retrospective analysis, a preliminary observation underlines no statistical difference in the incidence of Acute and Chronic GVHD among patients receiving the two types of ATG. Early post transplant bacterial infections and Cytomegalovirus infections were similar in the two groups. At 17 months post-transplant Overall Survival was 73% for patients in the ATG-G cohort vs 88% for patients in the ATG-F cohort (p=0.6). In the same period the probability of relapse was 27% in the ATG-G group vs 0% in the ATG-F group (p=0.08) ( Figure  1 ). These data must be confi rmed in a randomised prospective study and longer follow-up is necessary.",

Dickinson Newcastle University (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) Complications such as graft versus host disease (GVHD) remain a major barrier to the successful application of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Cytokine expression plays a major role in the pathogenesis of GVHD. Damage to mucosal tissues during the induction phase of acute GVHD is accentuated by the release of proinfl ammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). In contrast, the antiinfl ammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) is said to down regulate the T-cell responses that are involved in intensifying GVHD. In addition, polymorphisms in cytokine genes have been associated with GVHD and patient outcome post-HSCT. We have looked at TNFd and IL-10 polymorphisms in a cohort of allogeneic HSCT patient/donor pairs and compared these with patient cytokine levels and GVHD. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and acrylamide electrophoresis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients pre-transplant were cultured in media alone, lypopolysaccaride (LPS) for 24 hours or phytohaemagglutenin (PHA) for 72 hours S136 to facilitate activation. Levels of TNF and IL-10 were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). LPS stimulated recipient TNF levels were signifi cantly increased in recipients with the TNF 3/3 genotype (p=0.043). However, in this cohort there was no statistical link between patient TNF 3/3 genotype and the development of GVHD (n=60). In addition, spontaneously released donor IL-10 levels were increased in donors with the IL-10 GCC haplotype (p=0.06). Furthermore, signifi cantly less, clinically signifi cant GVHD (p=0.047) was seen in patients with donors who had the IL-10 GCC/GCC genotype (n=63). These results further substantiate the role of cytokines in the development of acute GVHD and demonstrate that functional studies can correlate with genotype and be of clinical relevance.",

Gregorio Mara\u00f1on (Madrid, ES) Introduction: DNA Methylation controls the expression of certain genes. FOX-P3 is a transcriptional regulator expressed constitutively in regulatory T lymphocytes CD4/25 (Treg) and transiently and with signifi cantly lower levels in effector T cells. Objective: To analyze the association between FOX-P3 mehtylation status and level of expression with the dynamics of chimerism and the development of complications after allogeneic SCT (alloSCT). Patients and methods: FOX-P3 promoter methylation was assessed by quantitative methylation-specifi c real time-PCR from 32 peripheral blood (PB) samples obtained within the fi rst month post-alloSCT. FOX-P3 mRNA expression level was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR in 18 patients. Results: A higher degree of FOX-P3 methylation (\"hi-meth\") was signifi cantly associated with a lower incidence of acute GVHD (II-IV) and with a higher incidence of relapse. The observation of \"hi-meth\" would refl ect a lower amount of FOX-P3 expressing cells, both Treg and effector cells. Since Treg comprises a minor population, such observation would result from relative low levels of effector T cells, which would explain the lower GVH and GVL effect observed in the \"hi-meth\" group. Surprisingly, when FOX-P3 mRNA levels were analyzed, an association with statistical signifi cance between \"hi-meth\" and a higher expression of FOX-P3 (\"hi-exp\") was observed. It has been shown that FOX-P3 is mainly produced by Treg while effector T cells produce very low amounts of FOX-P3 mRNA. In this sense, a higher amount of Treg cells produces high FOX-P3 mRNA levels and reduces the number of effector T cells, resulting in a \"hi-meth\" status in PB samples, in which most cells would have methylated FOX-P3. FOX-P3 \"low-exp\" would, in turn, indicate a lower amount of Treg to suppress the immune activation, resulting in higher amount of effector T cells and therefore would be associated with \"low-meth\". Additionally, a signifi cant association between \"hi-exp\" and lower incidence of death was observed. Moreover, acute GVHD was the main cause of death (3/4) in the group with \"low-exp\". The lower amount of effector T cells in PB samples with \"hi-exp\" would protect from the development of GVHD. Conclusions: Both FOX-P3 mRNA expression and promoter methylation are of prognostic value for the development of complications post-SCT, favoring an early establishment of the immunotherapeutic options for an improved management of transplanted patients.",

Markopoulos, S. Tirella, C. Alvisi, O. Luinetti, A. Colombo, F. Ripamonti, E.P. Alessandrino, G. Corazza Foundation IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo (Pavia, IT) Introduction: Gastrointestinal graft-versus-host-disease (GI-GVHD) is one of the main causes of therapy-related morbility and mortality consequent to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), occurring in up to 80% of patients and involving any part of the intestine from the oesophagus to the rectum. Early diagnosis is crucial for improving clinical outcome. The clinical features of this pathological condition are usually evident in an advanced phase and the histological examination of perendoscopic mucosal biopsies may be inconclusive. Abdominal ultrasound with color Doppler (CD) allow the evaluation of single bowel wall layers with their vascularization throughout the small and large bowel. Up to now, only scanty information are available about the role of ultrasound in the diagnosis and staging of acute GI-GVHD. We aimed, therefore, to characterize the sonographic fi ndings of intestinal GVHD. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 11 patients who developed acute GI-GVHD (M/F ratio 8/3, mean age 52.2 years) after allogeneic HSCT for haematological malignancies. Sonography was performed with both 5 MHz and 10 MHz probes, and the evaluated parameters were: bowel loop transverse diameter (normal value <15 mm), wall thickness (normal value <3 mm), parietal stratifi cation and intraparietal blood fl ow by color Doppler, free abdominal fl uid, mesenteric lymph node size. In all patients stool samples resulted negative for bacterial, fungal and viral infections, whereas only in 5/11 patients the diagnosis of acute GVHD was confi rmed at histology. The remainder 6/11 patients resulted unable to undergo endoscopic examination because of their critical condition. Results: 54% patients showed an increased bowel wall thickness of both small bowel and colon (pan-intestinal disease), with the distal part of the ileum being more frequently involved (73%); bowel wall thickening was in all patients the result of increased thickness of the submucosa. In 73% patients an increased intraparietal arterial blood fl ow was demonstrated. The majority of patients presented hyperechoic mesenteric thickening (73%) and free abdominal fl uid (64%). Conclusions: ultrasonography with CD is a feasible and safe method for the assessment of patients in whom intestinal GVHD is suspected and it should be included in the diagnostic algorithm. Even if not specifi c, the fi ndings we have described may help in both early detection and accurate staging of this condition.",

Methods: 193 patients with different hematological malignancies were treated with allogeneic HSCT and underwent ophthalmologic examination in the period from 2006 till 2008. Three stages of dry eye disease were diagnosed according to the following criteria: dry eye related clinical symptoms, positive staining with fl uorescein, Schirmer's I test results less than 10 mm or a tear fi lm break-up time value less than 15 seconds (Norn test). The following treatment schedules of dry eye syndrome associated with GvHD were used: Stage 1: Artifi cial tears (high viscosity) BID or TID; Stage 2: Artifi cial tears TID and Dexamethasone 0.1% BID or TID topical; Stage 3: Artifi cial tears 4-6 times a day, Dexamethasone 0.1% TID topical and Cyclosporin A 0.05% 1 drop per eye BID. Wilcoxon pair matched test, Spearman test and Pearson test were used for statistical analysis. Results: Ophthalmologic complications occurred in 49,7% (96/193) of HSCT patients. Eye GvHD was revealed in 24% of all transplanted patients. 34 patients were eligible for assessment of system chGvHD. Among them, 70% (24/34) of patients had signs of dry eye syndrome. All patients with aGvHD received systemic GvHD prophylaxis and eye component of aGvHD responded quickly to local Dexametazone 0.1% treatment. The median day of onset of eye chGvHD was D+145\u00b129 (range 96-175). The eye chGvHD treatment results according to stages of dry eye syndrome are represented in Table 1 . There was strong correlation between both tests used (p=0.004) Two patients could not tolerate cyclosporine topical treatment because of local irritation of conjunctive. Conclusion: Approximately half of patients treated with HSCT have signs of different eye complications. The frequency of eye chGvHD is 70% of patients with systemic chGvHD. The cyclosporine local therapy proved to be effective treatment of stage 3 dry eye syndrome caused by chGvHD.",

Papanicolaou (Thessaloniki, GR) Chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD) is the main cause of late morbidity and mortality following allotransplantation. \u00c2-lymphocytes have been implicated in the pathogenesis as antigen-presenting cells or by producing autoantibodies or cytokines. We investigated the effect of rituximab in 14 patients with refractory cGvHD to at least 2 therapy lines. Rituximab was administered at 375 mg/m\u00b2 per weekX4weeks (fi rst phase), 375 mg/m\u00b2 every 2 weeksX4 times (second phase) and 375 mg/m\u00b2 every 2 monthsX1 year (third phase). Nine male and 5 female patients, median aged 42 years, were included. Eleven had received grafts from siblings and three from unrelated donors. The main graft source was mobilized peripheral blood(12/14) and myeloablative conditioning regimens were used in 10 of 14 patients. All patients had extensive cGvHD with organ involvement: skin (14 patients, 2 with cutaneous sclerosis), mouth(12), eyes(9), liver(2), l ung(3), joints(1), gut(1), kidneys(1), bone marrow (1) . The median therapy lines offered to patients before rituximab were 3(calcineurin inhibitors plus steroids\u00b1 mycophenolate mofetil, extracorporeal photopheresis). The time from GvHD appearance to fi rst Rituximab administration was 24(4-79) months. Twelve patients completed the fi rst phase, 8/14 the second phase and 6/14 are currently in the third phase. Partial or complete responses were observed in 10 patients (71%) at a median follow-up of 6 months. The time to response was 2 months in the majority of patients. Responses were mainly in the skin (10/14) and mouth(7/14) and resolution of nephrotic syndrome was observed in one patient. In responders (10/14), steroids were tapered and GvHD reappeared in 2 of them. No chimerism changes or hematologic toxicity were observed during therapy. The main reason for treatment modifi cation (doseinterval) was infection (10/14, 71%). Eight patients developed fungal pneumonia and one developed CNS toxoplasmosis, while one patient died from septic shock. The rituximab dosing schedule was modifi ed or suspended until resolution of infection. Our data suggest that B-cell depletion by rituximab may offer an effective alternative treatment for refractory cGvHD. A major limitation seems to be the relatively high incidence of infections. A possible earlier use of rituximab, when patient immune status is not severely immunocompromised or modifi ed longer intervals between treatment courses may reduce treatment-associated toxicity and improve outcome.",

Mohty CHU H\u00f4tel-Dieu (Nantes, FR) Previous studies have demonstrated that the immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporine A (CsA) may be correlated with CsA blood concentration, especially in the context of solid organ transplantation. This single centre report investigated the impact of CsA concentrations in the early post allo-SCT period, on the incidence of severe acute GVHD, in 85 consecutive patients, for whom CsA concentrations were monitored weekly after the start of infusion. 85 patients received CsA (3 mg/Kg/d, 2-3 days prior to graft infusion) as a 24-h continuous infusion until hematopoietic recovery and switch to oral formulation. Dose modifi cations of CsA were performed to maintain adequate trough blood levels and to prevent nephrotoxicity. Patients' and donors characteristics were as follow: median age: 51 (range, 18-67), 46 (54%) female donors, 33 (39%) myeloid malignancies, 49 (58%) lymphoid malignancies, and 3 cases of SAA. The stem cell source was PBSC in 66 (78%) patients, while bone marrow was used in 19 (22%) patients. 37 (43.5%) were transplanted from a matched related donor, and 48 (56.5%) from a matched unrelated donor. A myeloablative conditioning regimen was used in 24 (28%) patients, and 61 (72%) received a reduced intensity regimen. The median concentrations of CsA in the blood at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after allo-SCT were 348 (range, 172-733), 284 (range, 137-535), 274 (range, 107-649), and 247 (37-695) ng/mL respectively. All patients engrafted at a median of 17 (range, 0-42) days after allo-SCT. With a median follow-up of 16 (range, 5-29) months, grade 2-4 acute GVHD occurred in 36 patients (42%) at a median of 29 (range, 6-100) days after allo-SCT. The incidence of grade 3-4 acute GVHD was 23% (95%CI, 14-32%). In multivariate analysis taking into account acute GVHD risk factors, we found that higher whole-blood CsA concentration in the fi rst week following graft infusion, and before onset of acute GVHD was the strongest parameter signifi cantly associated with a reduced the risk of severe grade 3-4 acute GVHD (P=0.01; RR=0.24; 95%CI, 0.08-0.73). Despite its retrospective nature, this data indicates a close relationship between CsA trough blood concentration during the early post allo-SCT period and the severity of acute GVHD. Insuffi cient early exposure to CsA can be a serious risk for S138 developing severe acute GVHD. Therefore, precise monitoring of CsA concentrations and achievement of a high CsA target concentration may be an effective tool to prevent the onset of severe acute GVHD.",

Afanasyev Pavlov State Medical University (St. Petersburg, RU) Chronic graft versus host disease (chGvHD) is the most common late complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The peripheral blood eosinophilia was proven to be a prognostic factor of sclerodermatous form of chGvHD (Skert C. et al, 2006) and occurred in 10-20% of patients. On other hand the intracellular marker of eosinophils -eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and intracellular marker of mast cells -tryptase, are mediators of infl ammation and organ damage and could lead to development of sclerosis. Objectives: to determine the levels of ECP and tryptase in patients with chGvHD and compare these parameters in patients with other non-clonal hypereosinophilic conditions. Patients and Methods: The serum level of ECP and tryptase were measured in three groups of patients with peripheral blood eosinophils more than 0.4 x10 9 /L: First group consisted of 6 patients with chGvHD, second group represented 18 patients with bronchial asthma and in third group 20 patients with Hodgkin's and nonHodgkin's lymphoma were combined. The second and third groups were used as controls. A commercial fl uoroimmunoenzyme assay was used (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Results: The serum levels of total ECP were markedly increased in the patients with chGvHD (median: 39,8 ng/mL; range, 2-200 ng/mL) to compare with second group (median: 18,8 ng/mL; range, 2-197 ng/mL), p<0,03. The serum levels of tryptase were increased in group of patients with chronic GvHD (median: 12,3 ng/mL; range, 2,6-24,1 ng/mL), to compare with second group (median: 6,8 ng/mL; range, 3,6-11,7 ng/mL), p=0,03.and third group (median: 5,95 ng/mL; range, 2,3-16,4 ng/mL), p<0,05. Conclusion: The tryptase and ECP could take part in pathogenesis of chGvHD with eosinophilia probably supporting infl ammation and secondary sclerosis.",

Horal, B. Kaijser, M. Brune University of G\u00f6teborg (G\u00f6teborg, SE) Background and Objectives: Pretransplant immunity to bacterial agents (e g tetanus, dipheria) and viruses, eg polio, is frequently lost after auto-and allo-SCT. Therefore, reimmunization of is routinely initiated after patients\u00b4 immune reconstitution, 6-12 months after transplant. Ongoing GvHD and its immunosuppressive treatment may impair or delay antibody response to vaccination. Here, we account for the effect on antibody levels of our reimmunization practice in transplanted patients with and without GvHD. Methods and Pazients: At our institution, pts are vaccinated (regardless of ongoing GvHD) against diphteria, tetanus and polio, using three injections given at +6, +8, +15 months after auto-SCT, or at +8,+10, +18 months after allo-SCT. Titers of neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus -1, -2 and -3 were assessed by the poliovirus-neutralizing antibody test. ELISA technique was used to determine antibody levels against tetanus-toxoid. Titers of neutralizing antibodies against diphteria were measured by diphteria-neutralizing test. Immune level for diphtheria and tetanus was determined to \u22650.01 IU/ml. We enrolled 37 pts (23 allo-SCT, 14 auto-SCT), age 51 (21-73) yrs, without relapse and with a median follow-up of 36 (7-70) months after last vaccination). Diagnosis were in the allo-SCT group MDS and acute or chronic leukemias, and in the auto-SCT group myeloma and lymphomas. Sixteen allo-pts had GvHD and ongoing immunosuppresion (IS) at the time of the fi rst two injections. Results: In the auto-SCT group, 2 pts lacked immunity to diphtheria/polio (n=1) and diphteria/tetanus (n=1) . In the allo-SCT group, three pts lacked immunity to diphteria (n=2) and diphtheria/polio (n=1), all of whom had GvHD and IS at the point of the fi rst two immunizations. The seven allografted pts without GvHD and IS at immunization all had full immunity to polio, diphtheria and polio. The difference observed with respect to immunity between GvHD and non-GvHD pts was not statistically signifi cant (p=0.32, Fisher\u00b4s exact test). Conclusion: In spite of a high rate of GvHD and IS in the allo-SCT group, the results of reimmunization were good and similar to what was found in the auto-SCT group, suggesting that ongoing GvHD does not abrogate a respons to vaccination. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that all three allo-pts lacking full immunity had ongoing GvHD at the time of vaccination. A larger study is needed to clarify this issue.",

Eder Hannover Medical School (Hannover, DE) Background: Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) of the lung, characterised by bronchiolar infl ammation and fi brosis, is a devastating late-onset non-infectious pulmonary complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), with high morbidity and mortality. Treatment options are limited to immunosuppression, antiinfl ammatory and antiobstructive drugs, or lung transplantation. Recently, platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) have been recognised as regulators of proliferation and collagen deposition in fi brotic lung diseases. Imatinib, a PDGFR inhibitor, seems to exert antifi brotic actions at 200 mg daily, and has been reported to improve pulmonary arterial hypertension and bronchiolitis obliterans in single patients. Methods: Since November 2005, we employed Imatinib in eight patients with refractory pulmonary cGvHD. Median age was 45 years (range: 24 to 50); 3 patients were female and 5 male. Peripheral blood HCT from related (n = 6) or unrelated (n = 2) donors had been performed after myeloablative (n = 6) or reduced intensity (n = 2) conditioning, for AML, CML, or lymphoma. All patients had already received combination therapy with steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate, and/or extracorporal photopheresis. Additional Imatinib was started at 100 mg daily and increased in 100 mg steps, as tolerated. All patients were evaluated monthly for toxicity and response (pulmonary function). Results: Imatinib toxicity was generally acceptable (hematologic, nausea, or edemas), except in one patient who had to discontinue the drug at 100 mg due to reversible dyspnea. Dose increase was not possible in half of the patients; only one reached the 400 mg dosage. After a mean therapy duration of 6 months (range: 1 to 16), no signifi cant recovery of pulmonary function was noted. Best responses were minor improvements facilitating steroid tapering in two patients treated for 16 and 10 months, four patients showed no change, and two patients died due to progression of pulmonary cGvHD and/or leukemic relapse. Conclusions: Imatinib at 100 to 400 mg daily had limited efficacy in this small cohort of patients with advanced refractory pulmonary cGvHD. We cannot exclude that patients might have benefi ted from longer exposure to or higher doses of Imatinib, but both were diffi cult to achieve. Conceivably, a stronger effect S139 might also be seen if treatment was started before irreversible lung damage, or with more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

Vernant Hopital de la Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00e9tri\u00e9re (Paris, FR) Steroids are used for fi rst-line treatment of aGvHD grade >II. Steroid-resistant forms can be treated with monoclonal antibodies like inolimomab (anti-interleukin-2 receptor). Several studies have shown the effi cacy of inolimomab, but the optimal regimen (dosing interval and duration) remains to be determined. We reviewed the cases of 28 patients with aGvHD who received inolimomab for at least 2 months between 2000 and 2007. The aim of this long-lasting treatment was to allow a quick decrease of steroids. Median age was 44 years (range 20-60 years). The conditioning was myeloablative in 22 cases. The source of progenitor cells was peripheral blood in 10 cases, bone marrow in 15 cases and cord blood in 3 cases. The donors were related in 12 cases (1 mismatched) and unrelated in 16 cases (7 mismatched). Acute GvHD was diagnosed a median of 20 days after AHSCT (range 7-39 days). AGvHD was grade II in 14 cases (all cutaneous), grade III in 11 cases (8 cutaneous, 1 digestive and 2 cutaneous+digestive) and grade IV in 3 cases (2 digestive and one cutaneous+digestive). After a median of 16 days of steroid therapy, inolimomab was administered daily, for a median of 21 days, then two or three times a week. The median treatment period was 10 weeks (up to 6 months). The following immunosuppressive treatments were subsequently added in 16 cases (57%): mycophenolate mofetil (12 cases), infl iximab (7 cases), antithymocyte globulins (2 cases) and phototherapy (1 case); 5 patients received two or more of these treatments. Twenty complete responses (CR) and 5 partial responses (PR) were obtained. Only cutaneous aGvHD responded completely. During inolimomab administration, 11 of 21 CMV-seropositive patients had at least one episode of CMV reactivation. EBV reactivation occurred in 3 patients. With a median follow-up of 16 months after tranplantation (range 3-95 months), 57% of the patients (16/28) were alive. Six patients died of GvHD, 3 died of relapses and 3 died of bacterial infections (2 patients in CR from aGvHD and one in PR).",

However, severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) remains the main obstacle to apply this therapeutic modality. No standard therapy has been identifi ed once a patient has developed severe GvHD and is refractory to high-dose steroids. The pre-emptive use of CD52 antibody alemtuzumab as part of the conditioning regimen reduces the incidence of GvHD but leads to higher relapse and infection rates. CD52 antibody alemtuzumab was used in 18 patients now evaluable, age range 13-68 years, with GvHD grade III and IV refractory to at least 7 days of high-dose steroids. Patients had undergone stem cell transplantation from family donors (n=7) or matched unrelated donors (n=11). Five had 1 or 2 antigen mismatch. All patients had severe gut and/ or liver involvement. Initially, in three patients in rather critical situations start doses of alemtuzumab in the range of 70mg to 80mg (total) were applied in fractions over several days and repeated after 3 to 4 weeks. Impressive responses, such as bilirubin levels of 48mg/dl returning to normal within several weeks, were encouraging, but virus reactivation and bacterial infections were seen. This fi nding and considering the limited quantities of lymphoid tissue present early after transplantation requiring less antibody, the starting dose was reduced to 20 to 33 mg in the second, and 5-10mg in the third cohort, repeated every 2 to 3 weeks. Considerable improvement was obtained in most patients. Chronic GvHD was observed frequently. Pronounced lymphocyte depletion seems inevitable for effi cacy, and CMV reactivation and other infectious complications were seen. Thus, despite the need for close monitoring for signs of infections, alemtuzumab given in moderate doses has a substantial activity in severe steroid-refractory acute GvHD.",

Traditionally, the therapy has been mainly directed against T-cells, but there is growing evidence that B-cells are also important for cGvHD and that Rituximab may be benefi cial in such patients. We retrospectively evaluated the effect of rituximab in 13 patients with steroid-refractory cGvHD (375 mg/qm x 4 weeks). Complete response (CR) was defi ned as resolution of all GvHD-related symptoms; partial response (PR) as > 50% and no response (NR) < 50% reduction or exacerbation during or after therapy. All patients received HLA-identical SCT for AML (10) and CML (3). The stem cell source was peripheral blood (11) or bone marrow (2) from related (8) or unrelated donors (5). Eleven patients received myeloablative and 2 patients non-myeloablative conditioning and GvHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. All patients received 1-2 cycles of rituximab for extensive cGvHD. The treatment was well tolerated in all patients. One patient received less than 4 infusions because of early death from cGvHD. The median duration of cGvHD prior to Rituximab was 12 (range: 1-36) months with a median of 2.5 (0-4) previous immunosuppressive treatments. One patient achieved a CR after Rituximab, 6 a PR and 6 showed no response (NR) to Rituximab. Prednison could be reduced in 5/12 patients (42%) with a mean reduction of 91%. A total of 4/8 (50%) patients with skin cGvHD had a benefi t from the treatment. The best responses were observed in patients with sclerodermiform (3/5, 60%), enoral (6/8, 75%), and ocular cGvHD (4/7, 57%). Rituximab was administered in one patient without previous steroid therapy because of rapidly progressive sclerodermiform cGvHD. No response was observed after one cycle of rituximab and the immunosuppressive therapy was completed with steroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. One patient with obliterating bronchiolitis had a normalization of the FEV1 after 1 cycle of rituximab, whereas 2 patients died due to progressive obliterating bronchiolitis 1/3 (33%). In conclusion, B-cell depletion with rituximab may be an alternative treatment for steroid-refractory cGvHD.

Afanasyev St. Petersburg State Medical University (St. Petersburg, RU) Chronic GvHD (cGvHD) is the primary cause of late morbidity and non-relapse mortality in transplant survivors. Probability of cGvHD is higher after peripheral blood SCT than after BM SCT. CGvHD more frequently develops after MUD alloHSCT than SCT from matched related donors. Acute GVHD is also among the strong risk factors of this complication. CGVHD occurs even in SCT from a full matched donor, its severity and occurrence doesn't depend on conditioning intensity and it may deteriorate the outcome of alloHSCT. The probability of advanced cGVHD after unrelated allograft PBSCT from donors identical in HLA-A*, -B*, -C*, -DRB1* and -DQB1* loci were assessed. We analyzed data from 38 pts who underwent allo-PBSCT. For GVHD prophylaxis the patients received CsA with short courses Mtx or mofetil mycophenolate with tacrolimus. All patients received ATG to fortify immunosupression effect and decrease GVHD. Group 1 (11 pts) received Thymoglobulin with total dose of 7,5 mg/kg b.w.; Group 2 (27 pts) received ATGAM with total dose 60 mg/kg b.w. Age of patients, intensity of conditioning regimens, number of CD34+ cells in the graft and gender compatibility were comparable in the both groups. In the follow-up period of 2 years OS was similar in the both groups (63% in Thymoglobulin group vs 55% in ATGAM group, p=0.8). There was no statistically signifi cant difference in frequency of aGVHD II-IV in both groups: in Thymoglobulin group it was 45% and in ATGAM group it was 63%, p=0.3. Nevertheless, the rate of cGVHD was lower in patients, who received Thymoglobulin (11%) compared to ATGAM group (52%) p= 0.05; the most evident decrease was in the number of extensive forms (0 vs 43%), respectively (p= 0.02). Therefore, full HLA compatibility doesn't eliminate the risk of cGVHD after allo MUD PBSCT. Thereby we conclude that the use of ATG leads to rate reduction of cGVHD, however Thymoglobulin shows reliably higher effectiveness than ATGAM. Background: Graft-versus host disease (GvHD) is mediated by donor effector T lymphocytes. Regulatory T cells mediate peripheral tolerance and protect from GvHD. Polychromatic fl ow cytometry allows to examine manifold antigens displayed by a single cell and to identify fi ne lymphocyte subsets without the need of multiple tubes and a huge number of cells. Unwanted spectral overlaps increase with the number of dyes employed and require to optimize instrument settings and to select staining combinations carefully. Objective: to develop an 8-color fl ow cytomety protocol to distinguish T cell subsets including na\u00efve, effector memory, central memory, effector memory RA+ and regulatory T cells. To evaluate this approach for clinical use in paediatrics early after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Methods: Antigen groups were created according to the expression modality. Selected dyes were assigned to each group and different combinations of conjugates were tested. Analysis were performed with a digital eight colour fl ow cytometer. The accuracy of the determination of individual subpopulations was estimated for different sample sizes with normal white blood cells. Clinical use was tested with ten specimens drawn for routine blood counts on day 14 and day 20 after allo-HSCT.",

Sample sizes of CD4 T and CD8 T cells available for analysis of subpopulations were < 10000 on day 14 for most recipients, while on day 20, > 10000 events could be collected generally for both subpopulations. Regulatory CD4 T cells could be identifi ed as a CD25high/CD127 low subpopulation in most patients starting from day 20. Similar to CD4 and CD8 effector T lymphocytes, regulatory T cells with a memory phenotype were prevalent. Conclusions: We have found that 8-color fl ow cytometry allows to defi ne multiple T lymphocyte subsets starting from day 20 after transplantation in most recipients despite low lymphocyte counts and the small size of clinical specimens available in paediatrics. The estimation of T cell subsets including regulatory T cells early after HSCT may be useful to correlate phenotypic profi les with (1) the risk to develop severe GvHD or (2) with the responsiveness to therapeutic efforts undertaken to prevent or to cure GvHD. (2) Introduction: The bioequivalence of Equoral has been established by measuring pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy volunteers and in stable renal transplant recipients. To our knowledge, no study was performed in ASCT recipients. The aim of our study is to compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of Equoral solution (IVAX, USA) to Neoral solution (Novartis, USA) in ASCT recipients. Patients and methods: Our study was performed at the National Centre for Bone Marrow Transplantation (Tunis, Tunisia) between June 2007 and November 2008. This Study consisted of an open label, two-way crossover, randomized controlled trial of Equoral versus Neoral in ASCT recipients. Dose conversion was 1:1. The duration of washout period was at least 7 to 14 days. A ten-point blood sampling from 0 to 12 hours was done. The study measures included Cmax (extent of absorption), Tmax (rate of absorption) and AUC0-12h (Area under the concentration-time curve) calculated by linear trapezoid rule. The study protocol was approved by ethic committee. Results: Thirty patients enrolled the study. The median age was 26 years (range: 6 to 47). The mean pharmacokinetics features were: AUC0-12h: Equoral 4162\u00b11231, Neoral 4370\u00b11059 ng.ml/h (p=0.50); Cmax: Equoral 821\u00b1244, Neoral 834\u00b1298 ng/ ml (p=0.86); Tmax: 105 minutes for both formulations. Toxicity and acute GVHD were comparable in both groups. Conclusion: This is the fi rst study demonstrating that Equoral solution and Neoral solution can be considered bioequivalent and interchangeable in ASCT recipients.",

The incidence and the severity of these two groups of transplant recipients were compared. Results: The risk stratifi catins in our related and unrelated hematooietic stem cell transplantaiton are cimparable.

In contrast, the incidence of grade II~IV vs III~IV acute GVHD in patients with ATG prophylaxis were 18.2% vs 0%. The incidence of chronic GVHD in recipients without ATG prophylaxis was 42% and 10.0% for unrelated patients with ATG prophylaxis. Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that the use of ATG prophylaxis in recipients undergoing unrelated stem cell transplantation with ATG prophylaxis was quite effective to prevent the occurrence of acute and chronic GVHD and has comparable survival to related stem cell transplant.",

MTX is associated with mucositis, delayed engraftment and pulmonary toxicity. Campath anti-CD52 antibody may reduce GvHD by targeting lymphocytes (less in CD56+cells) and dendritic cells (less in Langerhans cells). 100mg Campath1G (non humanized) in vivo has been shown to abrogate GvHD without increasing the risk of relapse (Blood 92:4581). Unfortunately, studies with similar doses (100mg) of the humanized Campath1H (alemtuzumab) revealed increased incidence of relapse and severe viral infections which may be due to the prolonged in vivo half-life of Campath1H (21 days) vs Campath1G (13 hours). We report our single centre experience of low dose (20mg) alemtuzumab as GvHD prophylaxis in 11 consecutive matched sibling (n=6), related (n=1) or unrelated (n=4) transplantations, performed during 1/2007-1/2008. Median pt age was 39y (23-59). Diagnoses were AML(n=8), ALL(n=2), MDS-RAEB(n=1). 7pts were transplanted in CR1 and 4 with advanced disease. Conditioning was myeloablative in 6 cases (BuCy=5, TBI/VP16/Cy=1) and reduced toxicity in 5 (Flu/BCNU/Melphalan or Thiotepa). The stem cell source was peripheral blood in all cases. GvHD prophylaxis included alemtuzumab 10mg iv absolute on d-2 and d-1, posttransplant CyA with levels >200 until d+60 and thereafter tapering. All pts engrafted promptly (WBC>1000/\u00b5l on d+13(10-19), PLT>50000/\u00b5l on d+11(10-14)) and revealed complete BM and PB chimerism on d+30. Stomatitis (Gr I-II) was observed in only 2pts. One patient, who discontinued Cya on d+25 experienced steroid/ATG resistant, fatal GvHD (d100 TRM 9%). From the remaining on protocol treated 10pts, none revealed gut or liver aGvHD whereas 5pts (50%) experienced steroid-sensible skin GvHD St I-III between d+16-d+36 (median d+18), resulting in an overall incidence of aGvHD Gr I-II of 50% and Gr III-IV 0%. CMV reactivation was observed in 8 out of 10 pts at risk but no CMV disease occurred. Cya could be discontinued in all evaluable pts at median on d+135(72-210). 3pts revealed mild skin chronic GvHD and 2 moderate skin cGvHD which resolved with steroids. After a median follow up of 504 days (332-675), 7pts are alive and in CR and 4 died (relapse n=3, TRM n=1). Median Karnofsky is 100% and only 1 pt receives occasionally steroids for skin cGvHD.

It suppresses the cytotoxic action of macrophages, inhibits the production of proinfl ammatory cytokines and induces major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression on antigen presenting cells (APC). To examine the role of IL-13 in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) we measured serum IL-13 levels in 31 patients admitted for allogeneic HSCT using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All serum samples were obtained at the time of admission and prior to the administration of any preparative treatment. IL-13 levels were correlated with HSCT outcome and in all statistical analyses P values <0.05 were regarded as being signifi cant. No associations were observed between IL-13 levels and the development of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Pre-transplant IL-13 serum levels were, however, signifi cantly elevated in patients who relapsed following HSCT (P < 0.001). Moreover, high IL-13 levels were observed mainly in patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML); AML relapse occurred in 6 of 10 patients. Elevated IL-13 levels also correlated with decreased survival (P = 0.0018), with 7 of 10 patients dying as a consequence of disease relapse. Due to the small nature of the study population, our results are currently being verifi ed in a larger cohort. Despite this, our data demonstrates the prognostic signifi cance of elevated IL-13 levels in patients prior to allogeneic HSCT and suggests a role for IL-13 in disease relapse. When allogeneic hematopoietic cells are transplanted to a solid organ recipient there is a danger of organ graft rejection as these hematopoietic cells are HLA matched to organ recipient and not to organ donor. We report a patient who after transplantation of the kidney from an unrelated donor, underwent allotransplantation of peripheral blood stem cells from HLAidentical sister.",

Initial treatment consisted of induction chemotherapy and resulted in complete remission. It was followed by consolidation chemotherapy (2 cycles) and maintenance chemotherapy (5 cycles). Leukemia relapse was diagnosed on October the 20th., 2005. Patient did not achieve remission after reinduction therapy. In view of rapid progression of the disease, the availability of HLA-identical sister and poor general condition, the patient was qualifi ed for salvage peripheral blood stem cell transplantation with reduced intensity conditioning despite the fact that. HLA antigens of both marrow donor and recipient were almost completely mismatched with the HLA antigens of renal graft. The conditioning regimen consisted of treosulfan and fl udarabine. There were no major complications observed in the early posttransplant period and the engraftment was complete by the day +13. An acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) (day +42) and chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD) (bronchiolitis obliterans, day + 97) were diagnosed during the posttransplant treatment. On day +128 when outside hospital, patient has developed severe pneumonia which lead to a septic shock and death on day + 138. Initially immunosupression consisted of tacrolimus and prednisolone. Additionally from day -1 to day +23 posttransplantation mycofenolate mofetil was administered. When symptoms of aGvHD and cGvHD appeared they were treated with change from oral steroid to methylprednisolone at 2 mg/kg i.v. During the entire hematological treatment the transplanted kidney was functioning properly. Creatinine values were at an average of 1,6 mg/dL. Conclusion: We report a situation in which an almost complete mismatch between the transplanted kidney and donor bone marrow did not result in allogeneic reaction directed against transplanted organ, even in the presence of aGvHD and cGvHD.",

Cell therapy with culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) infused intravenously was recently reported as a promising treatment for severe aGVHD. Culture with donor's serum offers the advantage of safety, but results in the limited expansion of MSCs. We report the results of a-single-centre, pilot study to treat aGVHD with intra-arterial regional administration of a relatively small number of cultured MSCs. Patients: Patients eligible for this pilot study were aged over 15 years and had grade 2-4 aGVHD that did not respond to steroid treatment. Patients with only skin GVHD or who were treated with pulsed corticosteroid \u22651 mg per kg per day) or ATG within 2 weeks were excluded. The clinical protocol and consent form were approved by the Ethics Committees of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, and all participants in the study gave written informed consent. Treatment protocols: MSCs derived from each hematopoietic stem cell donor's bone marrow were expanded with the donor's serum instead of bovine serum. MSCs at a dosage of 0.5 -106 cells/kg were infused into the appropriate hepatic artery, and/or gastroduodenal, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries. GVHD was evaluated using international criteria. Results: Three cases that received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from their related donors (one was matched, the others were haploidentical) and developed refractory aGVHD, confi rmed by histopathology, were enrolled. All patients continued their treatment with steroids (n=3), cyclosporin A (n=1) or mycophenolate mofetil (n=2) at the time of infusion. There were no obvious side effects after arterial infusion. Two weeks later, two of the three patients achieved partial clinical remission from gastrointestinal symptoms, and maintained for two months. The other patient developed hepatic dysfunction and severe cytomegalovirus infections. There were no obvious relapses of disease after infusions of MSCs, but adult respiratory distress syndrome developed in the two cases. Conclusions: Local-arterial MSC infusion may be alternative treatment to systemic-intravenous MSC infusion. Further clinical research is required to achieve satisfactory results with a relatively small number of MSCs.",

Greinix Medical University Vienna (Vienna, AT) Introduction: Relapse of malignant disease after high-dose therapy followed by hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has a poor prognosis. Although allogeneic HCT with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) is associated with lower transplant-related mortality (TRM), it is controversial whether RIC improves survival after retransplantation due to high rates of recurrent malignant disease. Methods: We retrospectively compared the outcome of 56 patients (32 male and 24 female) who received either myeloablative (n=12) or reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC, n=44) for allogeneic retransplantation after fi rst (n=32) or second (n=3) autologous or fi rst allogeneic (n=21) HCT at our institution.

Forty-three of 48 evaluable patients (90%, 38 after RIC, 5 after MA) achieved a complete remission after retransplantation. Eighteen patients experienced relapse/progression after retransplantation (17 after RIC, one after MA). Kaplan-Meier probability of relapse at 5 years is 50% after RIC and 25% after MA conditioning (p=0.32). Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) occurred in 24 patients. Incidence of relapse was 30% in patients experiencing GvHD compared to 62% in patients without GvHD (p= 0.01). Kaplan-Meier probability of TRM is 67% after myeloablative and 21% after RIC HCT (p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier probability of fi ve-year-survival is 43% after RIC and 25% after MA conditioning for retransplantation (p= 0.015) and 26% in patients without GvHD compared to 55% in patients experiencing GvHD (p= 0.017), respectively. Conclusions: A signifi cantly lower probability of transplant-associated mortality was seen after reduced-intensity conditioning without a higher risk of relapse. An improved survival after RIC was observed. Occurence of graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic retransplantation is associated with a signifi cantly lower risk of relapse and signifi cantly improved overall survival.

            "text": "The chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the most important and disabling complication after allogenic haemopoietic transplantation; in recent years with the increased use of peripheral blood as a source of stem cells, there was a higher incidence of cGVHD, with major locations in the skin and lung (scleroderma-like). The pathogenesis of this disease is quite similar to autoimmune diseases, because of an immunological disorder that will result in irreversible damage to target organs or tissues, often hesitating in a permanent disability. The only investigation that can pose diagnosis of cGVHD is the biopsy of the organ or tissue affected, so that the immunosuppressive therapy may be initiated only when the damage is already well advanced. Our centre has undertaken a study using the analysis of gene expression profi le (GEP) based on macroarray method to identify and to diagnose early cGVHD scleroderma-like. The purpose of this study is to recognize the early onset of cGVHD scleroderma-like and, then, apply the necessary therapeutic measures, before an irreversible damage. Starting from the evidence of similarities among patients suffering from scleroderma and from cGVHD, we tested a panel of transcriptome of genes associated to immune-infl ammatory/ anti-infl ammatory activities, showing particular signal activity in both groups of patients. The study selects patients undergoing to allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) from sibling donor, HLA-identical, using HPC-A as a source of stem cells for haematological malignancies; about 10 cc of peripheral blood in EDTA were taken and we performed the gene profi le and MAP-Kinase proteomic array. So far, this method has been applied to six patients, four of them subsequently developed a cGVHD scleroderma-like, confi rmed by histological examination. During the congress will show the data of other patients included in the assessment. The new application of the GEP could allow detection of patients who are developing a sub-clinical cGVHD. Early diagnosis and proper treatment approach may allow, in this light, starting soon more effective immunosuppressive therapy, so as to limit the onset of incapacity and preserve the quality of life in the patients long survivor after allo-SCT.",

Marenco, E. Zucchetti, P. Brasca, V. Mancini, G. Bertani, M. Turrini, C. Gabutti, E. Morra Niguarda C\u00e0 granda Hospital (Milan, IT) Despite the wide use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), few papers describe chronic GVHD (cGVHD) risk factors, clinical features and treatment responsiveness in this transplant setting. The aim of the study is to analyze risk factors and incidence of cGVHD as well as to investigate clinical characteristics of this signifi cant complication, its response to treatment and its impact on patients (pts) outcome in RIC transplant setting. Between November 2003 and November 2007, 30 pts affected by myelodisplasia or acute leukemia (19), multiple mieloma (7), lymphoma (4) underwent RIC SCT in our BMT Unit because of age > 55 years or comorbidities. Conditioning regimen was: Thiotepa 5 mg/kg, Fludarabine 90 mg/m\u00b2, Melphalan 100 mg/m\u00b2. GVHD prophylaxis was Cyclosporine (CSA) and short term MTX (10 mg/m\u00b2 on days +1, +3, +6). No ATG was given. CSA tapering was started on day +90 from transplant. Stem cell source was PBSC in 29/30, from related donor (26) or unrelated donor (4). After a median time of 8 months (range: 6-9) 10/26 evaluable pts developped cGVHD. Involved organs included skin and mucosae, lungs, muscles, fascia and joints; cGVHD was categorized as extensive in 6 pts. Steroid treatment was given to 7 pts, for a median period of 24 months, and lead to cGVHD resolution in 5 pts. Among all analyzed parameters, only donor gender (p= 0.009) and the number of CD3-positive cells infused (p= 0.0269) were signifi cantly related to cGVHD, while no signifi cant association was observed with recipient gender, donor or recipient age, CD34-positive cells dose and previous acute GVHD. At a median follow up of 17 months (range 1-57) 18/30 pts were alive. TRM was 10%. We observed 9 relapses, 8/9 occurring in pts without clinical evidence of cGVHD. Our conditioning regimen and GVHD prophylaxis allowed an acceptable cGVHD rate (38%), even without ATG. Patients who developed cGVHD were successfully treated with steroid treatment, which, however, was prolonged in most cases. Currently there is no consensus regarding the defi nition of risk factors for cGVHD after RIC transplant, but they seem to be different from the well-established ones for full dose setting. cGVHD seems to be related to a better overall survival rate (p=0.05). These results may suggest that immuno-modulating rather than immuno-suppressive agents may have a promising role in the treatment of cGVHD after RIC transplant. Sclerodermatous chronic graft-versus-host disease (ScGVHD) is a late complication of allogeneic PBSCT. Manifestations include severe skin and subcutaneous fi brosis with contractures, wasting and frequent infections, leading to substantial morbidity. Besides high-dose corticosteroids, no effective therapy has been established. The mTOR inhibitors sirolimus and S144 everolimus combine immunosuppressive properties with antiproliferative effects on fi brobroblasts and smooth muscle cells and may benefi cially infl uence ScGVHD. We report a series of fi ve patients (pt) with extensive ScGVHD treated with an mTOR-based therapy. Patient characteristics: All pt with a median age of 38 (range, 28-60) years received PBSCT for high-risk AML (n=3) or ALL (n=2) using myeloablative (n=2) or reduced-intensity (n=3) conditioning. Acute GVHD of the skin (grade I-II; n=3) and/or gut (grade I-III; n=4) was observed in all pt. Median time to onset of cGVHD was 435 (range, 128-806) days after PBSCT. Chronic GVHD occurred during tapering of immunosuppression in 3 pt and following DLI in 2 pt involving the skin (n=5) and mouth (n=5), but GI tract (n=2), eyes (n=4) and/or muscles/joints (n=3) were also affected. Early signs of cGVHD of the skin progressed to ScGVHD in 4 pt within a median of 193 (range, 151-261) days. Only one patient presented with ScGVHD. Everolimus (n=4) or sirolimus (n=1) was initiated at a median of 197 (range, 2-341) days after diagnosis of ScGVHD, aiming at trough plasma levels of 3-5ng/ml. Immunosuppressive treatment before or concomitantly with the mTOR inhibitor consisted of mycophenolate mofetil (n=4), prednisolone (n=2), cyclosporin A (n=1) and/or extracorporeal photophereses (n=1). One pt did not receive additional therapy. Results: All but one pt have continously been receiving an mTOR inhibitor for a median of 598 (range, 264-911) days. In one patient, everolimus was discontinued recently because of complete remission of ScGVHD. All other pt achieved significant clinical improvement and stopped additional immunosuppressive therapy. No patient experienced progressive ScGVHD while on mTOR inhibitor treatment. Adverse events included infections (grade 3; n=3), hypertriglyceridemia (grade 2; n=2), deep vein thrombosis (grade 3; n=1) and hypothyreoidism (grade 2; n=1). None of the pt relapsed. Conclusion: For pt with extensive ScGVHD, mTOR inhibitorbased therapy appears to be safe and effective. Further studies including larger cohorts of patients are warranted. M. Lioznov, P.

Kr\u00f6ger University Medical Centre Eppendorf (Hamburg, DE) Recent data suggest the signifi cant success of lenalidomide therapy in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who show relapse after allogeneic stem cells transplantation (allo-SCT). This might be explained by its immunostimulatory properties. The ability of lenalidomide to enhance natural killer (NK) cells and to stimulate cytotoxic activity of T-lymphocytes was shown in vitro and in murine models but however has not been systematically adressed in patients with MM. In this study we performed analysis of cellular immune response in eight MM patients (7 males and 1 females; median age: 54,3 years, range: 39-68) who relapsed \u22656 months (median: 19,6 month, range: 6-81) after allo-SCT and were treated with lenalidomide. Lenalidomide was administred for 21 days at 10-25 mg/day, followed by 1 week interruption. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and during lenalidomide therapy at two time-points: (i) between day 30 and 60 and (ii) between day 90 and 120 after start of treatment). Using cell counting and four-colour multiparameter fl ow cytometry (MFC) the following parameters were determined: the number of white blood cells (WBC) and lymphocyte (Ly) per \u00b5l whole blood; frequency of T (CD3+), CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, activated T (CD3+HLA-DR+), T-regulatory (CD4+CD25+CD127lo) and NK (CD3-CD56+) cells in common lymphocyte population and representation of different surface receptors (CD94, CD158a/h, CD158b, CD158e, CD226, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46) on the NKcell membrane. There were no signifi cant changes of WBC numbers, frequency of T-, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, or NK cells, and the expression of all investigated NK-cells surface markers (except NKp44) during lenalidomide therapy (Student's t-test) ( Table 1 ). In contrast, the number of Ly (p=0.012; Fig. 1 , A), the frequency of activated (p=0.0048; Fig. 1 , B), and regulatory (p=0.036; Fig. 1 , C) T-cells as well as of activated NK-cells (NKp44+) (p=0.0008; Fig. 1 , D) were signifi cantly increased under lenalidomide. These data suggest for the fi rst time that lenalidomide may not only enhance the number of common lymphocyte population, but also signifi cantly increases the frequency of activated T-and NK-cells in peripheral blood of MM patients after allo-SCT. This immunostimulatory effect seems to be an important mechanism for antimyelomatous activity of lenalidomide.",

Magalh\u00e3es (1) Introduction: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains the mainstay of treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) in patients <65 years old. However, most patients relapse after ASCT suggesting that additional treatment is needed. The Brazilian Multiple Myeloma Group designed a study to evaluate the impact of thalidomide maintenance after ASCT. Methods: From October 2003 to July 2008, 212 untreated patients <70 years old were enrolled in a prospective randomized multicenter study. All patients signed an informed consent and the protocol was approved by the Ethical Committees of each center. The treatment consisted of 3 phases: (1) induction with 3-5 cycles of VAD; (2) high-dose cyclophosphamide (4g/m\u00b2) plus G-CSF for stem cell mobilization; (3) melphalan 200 mg/m\u00b2 and ASCT. On day +60 post ASCT patients were randomized to receive dexamethasone (40 mg/d x 4 days every 28 days) with (arm A) or without (arm B) thalidomide (200 mg daily) for 12 months or until disease progression. Results: The median age was 55 years (27-70), 52% were male, the median serum beta-2 microglobulin was 3.66 mg/dl, 33% were ISS stage 3, 36% were ISS stage 2 and 24% had deletion of chromosome 13. In July of 2008, 93 patients (44%) were randomized: 54 in arm A and 39 in arm B. Reasons for nonrandomization were: treatment related deaths during phases 1-3 (n= 39), disease progression (n= 22), ineligible or refused ASCT (n= 7), SMD after ASCT (n= 1), protocol violation (n= 3), abandoned (n= 19), and still in phases 1-3 (n= 28). Clinical characteristics of each group were similar. The median followup from diagnosis was 15 months. Progression-free survival (PFS) in arms A and B were 42% (95% confi dence interval [CI] 22-62) and 25% (95% CI 5-45), p= 0.07. A multivariate analysis that included baseline serum beta-2-microglobulin and deletion of chromosome 13 showed that maintenance with thalidomide was signifi cantly associated with better PFS (hazard ratio 2.43, 95% CI 1.10-5.35, p=0.03). Overall survival was 65% in arm A and 74% in arm B (95% CI 44-100), p= NS. Conclusions: A high proportion of MM in Brazil has advanced disease at diagnosis, and this explains the high number of patients who did not reach the maintenance phase. This study shows that the addition of thalidomide to dexamethasone improves PFS after a single ASCT. Despite recent advances, Multiple Myeloma (MM) is still an incurable disease with a poor prognosis at relapse. The use of conventional allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is limited by a high transplantation-related mortality (TRM). Allografting with nonmyeloablative conditioning (NMA-C) has therefore been considered to improve survival.",

            "text": "We retrospectively studied a series of 23 patients with relapsing MM who underwent allogeneic transplantation after NMA-C and compared their outcome with those of patients who relapsed but were not allografted. The propensity score (PS) methodology was used to correct for potential recruitment bias. The idea was to model, for each patient with MM alive at 6 months after relapse, the probability of receiving NMA-C transplantation, according to a set of baseline characteristics (age, serum beta2 microglobulin level (beta2M), and time to progression (TTP) after the fi rst autologous SCT). This PS was estimated using logistic regression and was then used to match 1:1 patients with similar propensity to receive allograft. Data of patients treated in the MAG-95 and -02 trials were used. Twenty-three patients with MM in fi rst (n=21) or second (n=2) relapse were treated with high dose therapy followed by Autologous SCT preceding allogeneic SCT with a 2 Gy TBI NMA-C. Donors were HLA-identical siblings in 13 (56%) patients. Median age at allograft was 50 years. Median follow-up after allograft was 27.4 months. Post-allograft response was CR in 9 patients, VGPR in 8, PR in 4 and progressive disease (PD) in 2. TRM at one year was 13%. Two patients died from PD in the year after allograft. Acute GvHD occurred in 19 patients (15 grade I/II, 4 grade III/IV) and chronic GvHD in 11. Among the 10 patients (41.6%) who relapsed with a median of 10,7 months, 6 are alive with a median survival of 38.3 months. So far, 8 patients (34,7%) including 5 in CR and 3 in VGPR are still alive without relapse with a median follow-up of 36.8 months. From the 23 allografted patients, 21 matched pairs were successfully constituted. Based on these matched pairs, the estimated hazard ratio of death was 0.35 (95% confi dence interval: 0.14-0.88, p=0.027) for allografted patients compared with non allografted. In conclusion, PS matching method here suggests that NMA-C allograft in MM patients in fi rst relapse provides a high and durable response rate with a low TRM. These promising results must be further evaluated in clinical trials. (1) Introduction: In multiple myeloma (MM) we have reported a high response rate with a novel conditioning regimen using intravenous busulfan and melphalan (ivBuMel). We present results of a retrospective matched-pair analysis comparing outcomes of MM patients transplanted using the ivBu-Mel conditioning regimen with matched controls receiving an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT) after standard melphalan followed by a second ASCT for patients not achieving complete remission (CR) after the fi rst transplant (Control group). Material and Methods: Forty three cases and 86 matched controls were available for comparison. Patients in the Control group were transplanted from 2002 to 2005, while patients in the ivBuMel group underwent transplant between 2005 and 2008. Controls were selected to match on sex, age, Durie-Salmon and ISS stage at diagnosis, and disease status at transplant. ivBuMel conditioning regimen consisted of a single dose of 3.2 mg/kg (days -5 to -3) followed by Mel at a dose of 140 mg/m\u00b2 (day -2). Standard melphalan 200 mg/m\u00b2 was the conditioning regimen administered to the Control group in the fi rst ASCT. The preparative regimen administered to those patients in the Control group undergoing a second transplant consisted of cyclophosphamide, BCNU and etoposide (CBV). Results: There were no differences in the hematopoietic recovery and mild or moderate mucositis was the toxicity most frequently observed in both groups. Fever was seen in 35 cases in the ivBuMel group and in 66 cases in the Control group, (p = NS). No patient developed sinusoidal occlusive syndrome. Two patients died due to transplant-related complications in the ivBuMel group and 1 in the Control group. Overall, 14 (16%) patients in the Control group underwent the planned second ASCT. After ASCT, 49% of patients were in complete remission in the ivBUMel group vs. 51% in the controls. Thirty-months overall and progression free survival was 79\u00b18% and 47\u00b11% in the ivBuMel and 74\u00b15% and 46\u00b11% in the Control group, respectively. Conclusions: These results suggest that the use of ivBu-based regimen for ASCT in patients with MM is a well tolerated conditioning regimen associated with a low transplant-related morbidity and mortality that compares favourably with a double transplant strategy with melphalan and CBV. Further follow-up is necessary to ascertain whether ivBu will favourably infl uence time to progression and overall survival.",

Thirty-fi ve patients (31 MM and 4 NHL) received a mobilizing regimen of G (10 mcg/kg) each morning for 4 days. Starting the evening of Day 4, patients received plerixafor 240 mcg/kg. Apheresis was initiated in the morning, 10 to 11 hours following the dose of plerixafor. Tumor cell mobilization was evaluated using a very sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique in a sub-population of 7 patients with MM. Patient bone marrow (BM) samples were collected to establish the primer for the PCR assay. Patient BM and peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected at three time points to assess TCM: screening (pre-G), after G treatment but before plerixafor, and following G and plerixafor. Quantitative allele specifi c oligonucleotide PCR was performed to detect and assess the mobilization of MM tumor cells for each patient at all three time points. This result was then used to calculate the frequency of tumor cells compared to total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In the overall patient population, all patients collected \u2265 2\u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg. Following treatment with G alone, just prior to administering plerixafor, mobilization of tumor cells was detected with a minimum of 9.70\u00d710 -6 and a maximum of 1.38\u00d710 -3 tumor cells per total PBMC. After plerixafor treatment, 3/7 patients had a small increase and 4/7 patients a small decrease in PB tumor cells. The observed fold increase in tumor cells from before plerixafor administration to pre-apheresis ranged from 0.11 fold to 1.08-fold. In a sub-group analysis, plerixafor did not appear to contribute to TCM above that which occurs with G mobilization alone. These fi ndings are consistent with other phase II clinical studies, which reported negligible TCM after plerixafor treatment.",

Methods: Total of 134 patients affected by multiple myeloma (MM) in complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) were selected to receive ASCT on an outpatient or inpatient basis. Our analysis consist of 100 patients. Median age was 50.2 years (ranged 27-68) with 70% male. In the inpatient group 34 patients received 200 mg/m\u00b2 and 21 patients received 140 mg/m\u00b2 melphalan as conditioning regimen respectively. In outpatient group 13 patients received 140 mg/m\u00b2 and 32 patients received 200 mg/m\u00b2 melphalan. In outpatient group all the patients were programmed to go home the day after ASCT and to be re-hospitalized in the case of febrile neutropenia or other sever toxicities. We used caregiver, general physician, staff nurse as an outpatient and visit team and also unequipped routine house of the patients during neutropenia. Results: Median hospital stay were 25 days in inpatient and. 4.8 days in outpatient respectively (p<0.01). There were not signifi cant differences between these groups in aphresis days, granulocyte colony stimulating factor requirement for mobilization and mononuclear cell, There were also signifi cant reduction (p<0.001) in parenteral antibiotic, blood product requirement and need for total parenteral nutrition. The most frequent causes of re-admission in 6 patients (outpatient group) were febrile neutropenia and sever mucositis need TPN. 2 years overall survival rate was 98.2% (SE=2%) in inpatient groups and 86.6% (SE=5.7) in outpatient groups. Conclusion: The ease of administration of high dose melphalan as well as the lack of excessive extramedullary toxicity including nausea and vomiting renders patients with MM more suitable S147 for outpatient management, in the present study, we describe an outpatient program based on management of the patient in his/her house during aplastic phase. Our results clearly indicate that such a procedure is feasible and safe in a patient population with an assessable caregiver.",

Soler (1) , H. Rouard (1) , N.C. Gorin (2) , P. Bierling (1) (1)EFS Ile de France (Paris, FR); (2)Hopital Saint-Antoine (Paris, FR) Patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM) in our institution receive Velcade and Dexamethasone (VD) for induction and are then consolidated with high dose melphalan followed by one or two autografts according to the IFM protocols. We monitor the ratio CFUGM 104/ CD34 10 6 /Kg (sup 8) in all apheresis products as an indicator of quality for the graft. In recent months, we were alarmed by several unexpected low ratios (< 5) which led us to cancel the graft procedure and initiate new aphereses. We retrospectively studied the quality of the apheresis products in relation to the induction treatment VD or VAD (vincristine, adryamycine and Dexamethasone) and the mobilisation procedure Cyclophosphamide (CY) (4g/m 2 ) plus growth factor (GF). We focussed on the leukaphereses (LK) in the different groups with a ratio CFUGM 10 4 / CD34 10 6 /kg under 5. Patients and methods: 114 MM treated between the years 2000-2006 at Hopital Saint-Antoine Paris were analyzed.. Three groups were identifi ed: group 1 (CY and GF) -Group 2 (VAD and 5 days GF) -Group 3 (VD and 5 days GF). During this period the procedure to harvest cells was not modifi ed and performed on a Spectra equipment (Gambro BCT). Results (median): Group 1/2/3. Number of patients 47/29/38. Number of LK : 73/59/79. Granular cells % 44.5/21/29. Total granular cells per LK : 149.5/91.13/143.63. CD34 10 6 /Kg/LK: 2.81/3.37/2.70. Total CD34 10 6 /mobilization: 6.76/8.21/7.69. Ratio CFUGM/CD34: 9.53/9.55/8.24. Platelet 10 11 /LK: 2.28/5.71/5.56. Patients presenting a Low ratio (<5) were identifi ed in each group: number of patients: 3/1/8. ratio: 1.72/3.85/3.27. platelets 10 11 /LK: 6.40/8.62/9.19. Stored overnight before freezing LK: 2/1/8. Conclusions: Leukapheresis products with a very low ratio are highly contaminated with platelets. The overnight storage at 4\u00b0C of such a quantity of platelets in a small volume may induce various damages, such as modifi cation of the cell oxygen metabolism and diminution of pH . We recommend harvesting and freezing the MM apheresis products the same day, especially for patients under VD who have a higher level of platelets before harvesting.",

The initial chemotherapy treatment consisted of VBMCP/VBAD (40 patients), VCMP/VBAP (15 patients), VAD (11 patients), others (27 patients). Sixty-seven patients received the ASCT as intensifi cation of an initial response (upfront group) while in 28 the ASCT was performed for relapsed or refractory disease (relapse/refractory group). The high-dose regimens consisted of: MEL-200 (49 patients), MEL140-TBI (31 patients) and Busulphan-12/MEL-140 (BU/MEL) (15 patients). Response, relapse and progression were evaluated according to the EBMT criteria. Results: The response after ASCT was: CR (31%), PR (63%), MR (2%), SD or PD (3%). The median time to progression (TTP) from transplant was 30 months (40 vs. 17 months for the upfront and the relapsed/refractory groups, respectively, p = 0.01) and the median overall survival (OS) 59 months (78 vs. 30 months for the upfront and the relapsed/refractory groups, respectively, p = 0.03). The median TTP for patients who achieved CR and PR was 78 vs. 18 months, repectively, p < 0.001). After a median follow-up of 8.2 years, 11 of the 95 patients (11%) remain in continued CR from 8 to more than 14 years post-ASCT, this resulting in a PFS and OS plateau. Eight of these 11 patients received the ASCT as part of the upfront therapy (in continued CR from 8 to 14 years) while the remaining three underwent the ASCT for relapsed/refractory disease (in continued CR from 10 to 14 years). Conclusions: The long-term results of the present series with 11% of patients surviving in continued CR at 8 to 14 years from ASCT suggest that, a portion of patients with MM can be cured with a single ASCT.",

All pts had a severe, rapidly progressive sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy, involving extremities, with inability to walk. All pts had M component IgA-lambda and 1 had also M component IgG-lambda, all had plasmacytosis (7-10%) in bone marrow. Endocrinopathy was present in all pts as thyroid disease and in 1 patient as hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism, in 1 pts as hypophysary adenoma, in 1 pts as glucose intolerance. All pts presented melanosis. 2 patient had splenomegaly, and 3 hepatomegaly. A patient had sclerotic bone lesion. One patient had signifi cantly abnormal pulmonary function before aPBSCT. All pts received Cyclophosphamide 1500 mg/m\u00b2 on day 1,3 and Methylprednisolon 250 mg from day 1-4 for 2 cycles and G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day was added after 2\u00b0 cycle for mobilization. 3 pts were previously treated with high dose Ig i.v. and steroids in the neurologic unit. Time from diagnosis to aPBSCT was 4 months (range 3-7). Conditioning regimen was HDMel (Melphalan 100 mg/m 2 for 2 consecutive days). Engraftment was rapid and sustained.

New drugs, in particular bortezomib and lenalidomide, are appealing for several reasons: 1) their toxicity is not overlapping with chemotherapy; 2) the mechanism of antitumor activity is different from that of chemotherapy; 3) their activity encompass also modulation of immune cells, with potential effects on the graft versus-myeloma effect. In order to evaluate the clinical role of bortezomib and lenalidomide after allo-HSCT, we reviewed data from 23 patients treated at 4 Italian institutions. Median age at transplantation was 53 years (range 35-64). Twenty-one patients underwent a reduced-intensity, and 2 a myeloablative conditioning regimen. Donors were HLA-identical siblings in 17 patients, and matched unrelated donor in 6 patients. Eleven (48%) patients developed acute GVHD, and 15 (65%) chronic GVHD (9 limited, 6 extensive). All patients relapsed or progressed after allo-HSCT. Eight patients were treated with bortezomib, 7 with lenalidomide, and 8 received bortezomib and, subsequently, lenalidomide. The median interval between allo-HSCT and bortezomib was 31 months (range 7-144), and 27 months (range 7-71) for lenalidomide. The 16 patients treated with bortezomib received a median number of 3 courses (range 1-7), in all cases with dexamethasone, in 8 cases also with thalidomide, and, in one case, in association with doxorubicin. The responses to bortezomib were as follows: 5 CR, 4 VGPR, 4 PR, 2 SD, and 1 PD. The median duration of response (DOR) was 10 months (range 1-43). Longer DOR were observed in patients also receiving thalidomide. The 15 patients treated with lenalidomide received a median number of 5 courses (range [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , in all cases with dexamethasone. The responses to lenalidomide were as follows: 2 CR, 2 VGPR, 6 PR, one SD, and 4 PD. The median DOR was 6 months (range 2-14). Toxicities were neuropathy for bortezomib, and neutropenia for lenalidomide. Only a reversible grade III lenalidomide-associated hepatic toxicity was reported. No grade IV toxicities were observed. In one case GVHD worsened during treatment with bortezomib. In conclusion bortezomib and lenalidomide are promising treatments for MM patients in the allo-HSCT setting. It is reasonable to explore their use, also in combination with immunological manoeuvres. The results of previous observations indicate that access to and outcome of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for multiple myeloma may be different for African Americans compared to white Americans. The effect of Asian ethnicity is unknown, and the role of ethnic background on myeloma treatment has not been investigated outside the US. We have analysed the impact of ethnicity on ASCT in all myeloma patients referred to a large UK transplantation centre over a 15-year period. Hammersmith Hospital is a tertiary open-access referral centre for SCT with a catchment area that primarily covers Northwest London. A total of 311 patients with a diagnosis of myeloma were referred to our institution between 1994 and 2008 for ASCT. 235 were Caucasians, 47 were of African, and 29 of Asian background. All patients received single Melphalan-conditioned ASCTs. There were no differences in baseline patient demographics and disease status at the time of ASCT between the ethnic groups. The proportion of ethnic minorities undergoing ASCT for myeloma more than doubled from 14% in the fi rst to 31% in the last 5-year observation period, while the absolute number of Caucasians receiving ASCT for myeloma remained stable. For the entire study group, PFS after ACST was 19.7 months, and OS from diagnosis was 71.3mo. Progression-free survival (PFS) after ASCT was signifi cantly shorter in Africans (14.9m) compared to Caucasians (21.7m, p=0.02). In Asians, there was a trend towards shorter PFS after ASCT (15.9m), but this was not signifi cant. Overall survival (OS) from diagnosis (Africans, 65m; Asians, 76m; Caucasians, 73.8m) and from the time of ASCT (Africans, 46.1m; Asians, 36.4m; Caucasians, 56.9m) were not signifi cantly different between the ethnic groups. These observations suggest that access to ASCT for myeloma has improved for ethnic minorities in the UK, probably because of improved referral rates rather than changes in population demographics. Although patients of African ethnicity have a signifi cantly shorter PFS after ASCT, OS after transplantation and from diagnosis is not different. Further studies are required to investigate if myeloma patients of African background benefi t from ASCT to the same extent as other ethnic groups. Several mobilization regimens are used to mobilize stem cells for transplantation in multiple myeloma, but timing of collection is often diffi cult and the rate of side effects is quite high. To optimize timing of collection of peripheral blood stem cells, to reduce side effects and costs of the procedure, we evaluated vinorelbine, a drug shown to have activity in multiple myeloma, with a single dose of pegfi lgrastim as mobilizing regimen. Thirty consecutive patients with newly diagnosed stage I to III multiple myeloma received 2 -4 cycles of VAD (vincristine, adriamycin, dexamethasone) induction therapy at two transplantation centers. This was followed by one dose of vinorelbine 35mg/m\u00b2 iv in an outpatient setting on day one and a single dose of pegfi lgrastim 6mg s.c. on day 4. On day eight a median count of 52.5 CD34+ stem cells/microliter (range 2 -320) was measured in the blood of 28 patients. Two patients already showed CD34+ cells of 51 and 60 at day 7. One stem cell apheresis was suffi cient to collect a median of 8.9 x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg body weight (range 1.2 -36.6). Four patients (13%) needed two stem cell aphereses to achieve a suffi cient number of stem cells for transplantation. Twenty-one (70%) of the 30 patients mobilized had their fi rst apheresis on day 8, 2 (7%) on day 7, and 7 patients (23%) on day 9. No episodes of fever in neutropenia or other side effects were observed during mobilization. After high dose chemotherapy with melpahalan and stem cell transplantation, recovery of neutrophils was within the expected range, indicating no harmful effect of the mobilization scheme to the stem cells collected. The combination of vinorelbine and pegfi lgrastim is an effective alternative to cyclophosphamide in the mobilization of stem cells for autologous transplantation in multiple myeloma. Results are reliable and day of apheresis is highly predictable. As all the mobilizing and collection procedures were done in an out patient setting, this mobilization scheme is cost saving compared to the mobilization with cyclophosphamide, that usually requires hospitalization. In addition, a single dose of pegfi lgrastim averts the problem of non-compliance of daily fi lgrastim injections and improves acceptance of the treatment by the patient. Between December 1999 and May 2008 104 autologous stem cell transplantations were performed in 103 patients with plasma cell disorders in our transplant center in Hungary. The patients mean age was: 54.48 years. Sex distribution: 56 males, 47 females. The diagnosis was multiple myeloma in 98, multiple plasmocytomas in 4, acute plasma cell leukemia in 1 patient. The conditioning regimen was 200 mg/m\u00b2 melphalan in 100 cases, 120-160 mg/m\u00b2 melphalan in 3 patients with kidney failure and in 1 case with a second transplantation. We administered the median of 4.9x10 6 /kg CD34 positive cells on transplantation. Neutrophil engraftment (ANC>1.0 G/l) occurred on day +10, platelet engraftment (PLT > 20.0 G/l) on day +13. According to bone marrow morphology on day 100 and immunofi xation CR rate was 76%, VGPR occurred in 21%, 2 patients were considered as non-responders. 80% of the 103 patients are still alive. The median observation time from diagnosis was 38.4 months and from transplantation 28.9 months. The day 100 non-relapse mortality was 0%. The progression free survival according to Kaplan-Meier analysis was 63.17 \u00b1 6.1 (95% CI: 51.0 -75.3) months, the overall survival was 83.2 \u00b1 5.7 (95% CI: 71.9-94.5) months. The results of interphase cytogenetical examinations (FISH) were available in 45 patients. In 74% of them genetical abnormalities have been identifi ed. Del(13q) was proved in 41.9%, del(17p) in 9.7%, abnormalities in the IgH gene in 58% of the cases (overlaps). Among IgH gene abnormalities t(11;14) occurred in 16.7%, t(4;14) in 22.2% and t(14;16) in 5.6%, in 55.5% of the cases no partner gene has been identifi ed. Three prognostic categories were distinguished: good prognosis (t(11;14)), intermedier prognosis (normal FISH results, IgH gene abnormalities without identifi cation of a partner gene, t(11;14) + the presence of a poor prognostic marker) and poor prognosis (the presence of any unfavorable genetic prognostic marker). 22% of the patients belonged to the good, 33% to the poor and 45% to the intermedier prognostic category. There were significant survival differences (p= 0.01) between the different genetic prognostic groups of patients. Autologous stem cell transplantation defi nitely improves survival in patients with multiple myeloma. Cytogenetical examinations play an important role in the defi nition of different prognostic categories that represent signifi cant survival differences of these patients.",

Orchard Southampton General Hospital (Southampton, UK) Background: Expression of CD66, a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and immunoglobulin superfamilies, has been reported on granulocytes. Phase I and II clinical trials at our centre utilise this property for the delivery of targeted radiotherapy as part of the conditioning regimen for transplantation in acute leukaemias and multiple myeloma. In these studies the vector for the application is conjugated to one of two radioisotopes: Indium-111, a gamma radiation-emitting isotope for imaging to demonstrate bone marrow targeting and Yttrium-90, a beta-emitter which delivers therapy. Previous studies revealed abnormal expression of CD66 and its isoforms (CD66a to CD66e) in tumour cells. Preliminary studies at our centre suggested the presence of CD66 antigen on normal and malignant plasma cells. However, little is known about the differential expression pattern of its variants on plasma cells from patients with multiple myeloma. Objective: We performed fl ow cytometry on myeloma cell lines and plasma cells from patients with multiple myeloma to evaluate the expression of the CD66 variants. Methods: Fresh bone marrow samples were obtained from patients at Southampton General Hospital between 2007 and 2008. Mononuclear cells expressing CD138, a specifi c plasma cell marker, were either positively selected (Easysep magnetic separation kit) or incubated with saturating amounts of CD138 and a single CD66 monoclonal antibody (CD66a and d: R&D, Genovac; CD66b and e: AbD Serotec; CD66c-Santa Cruz). Similar analysis was performed on two human myeloma cell lines, U266 and ARH77. Results: Data acquisition and analysis were performed using the FACScalibur, CellQuest Software (Becton Dickinson). Plasma cells were gated according to forward and side scatter characteristics and CD138 expression. In all clinical bone marrow specimens, positive expression for CD66a was identifi ed (range 69% to 100%) with a median fl uorescence ranging from 54 to 673. Expression of CD66a was also identifi ed in cell lines, with no detectable expression of the other isoforms of CD66. Positive but weaker expression was seen with utilisation of the panCD66 monoclonal antibody (CD66a/b/c/e) in primary samples and the cell lines. Conclusion: CD66 expression, in particular CD66a expression, was detectable on cell lines and CD138+ plasma cells. These fi ndings may help in optimisation of future radio-immunotherapeutic strategies in patients with multiple myeloma.",

Studies from the USA have examined differences in HSCT rates between States, often in the context of socioeconomic and ethnic differences between populations. Little is known about the differences in transplant activity within a universal healthcare system such as the UK. This study investigated inequalities in HSCT activity between 9 strategic health authorities in the Pan Thames region of the UK, and the extent to which this is suggestive of an inequity of access. Data was obtained from the British Society for Blood and Marrow Transplant (BSBMT) for transplants carried out from 2004 to 2007 inclusive, in 4 South East England and 5 London health authority regions. Each region is served by a single transplant centre. Collectively, these centres perform 20% of the annual volume of HSCT in the United Kingdom. Transplant rates per million population were calculated for 1900 patients aged 18-72, receiving fi rst transplants for haematological malignancies. Rates were directly age and sex standardised to the 2001 UK census population. Utilisation was examined in relation to regional deprivation scores, ethnicity and level of educational attainment of the patient. Transplant rates in general, increased during this period but differences were noted between regions seemingly matched for size and economic status. The transplant rate in one particular region increased in association with the expansion of the local transplant unit. There was also an overall increase in transplantation for ethnic minorities. Following standardisation, we found inequalities in stem cell transplantation rates for different indications between age and ethnicity matched regions. Low educational attainment was associated with low transplant rates in both deprived and affl uent regions and in regions with different ethnic compositions. Our results suggest that factors related to ethnic background, education level and the referral process may be associated with underuse of HSCT, particularly by populations resident in Essex and North East London. Further research with emphasis placed on quantifying need, is required in order to assess the extent to which these factors can be interpreted as evidence of inequity of access to HSCT in the Pan Thames region.",

Plerixafor was administered post-dialysis, as it is predicted to be removed by dialysis. Results: All 3 patients were female, aged 58-61, & had myeloma presenting in dialysis-dependent renal failure. All had failed to mobilise PBSC by conventional means (cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF in 1 patient; G-CSF only in 2 patients). Following plerixafor plus G-CSF on the regime described above, 2 patients mobilised a transplantable PBSC dose of >2x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells after 1 and 2 apheresis procedures respectively. The third patient mobilised a suboptimal CD34+ dose of 0.36 x 10 6 /kg after the fi rst apheresis procedure, and the plerixafor dose was therefore increased to 240 micrograms/kg/day. After 3 apheresis procedures, the total dose collected remained inadequate for transplant at 0.86 x 10 6 /kg. In view of this, a second treatment cycle of G-CSF and plerixafor was initiated approximately 4 weeks later, with the plerixafor dose escalated to 240 micrograms/kg/day. On this occasion, a total CD34+ dose of 2.12 x 10 6 /kg was collected in 3 apheresis procedures, giving a total cumulative CD34+ dose of 2.98 x 10 6 /kg which is adequate for transplant. No immediate plerixafor toxicities were experienced by any of the three patients. All 3 patients are now scheduled for transplant in early 2009. Conclusions: In our inital experience, plerixafor is effective in PBSC mobilisation from myeloma patients with dialysisdependent renal failure, without undue toxicity.",

Reducing Melphalan dose allows to offer this procedure to patients with severe renal impairment. From 2003 to 2008, nine patients (6 MM, 2 Amyloidosis, 1 Crystalcryoglobulinemia) with renal impairment underwent auto-HSCT: six were males, three females, median age was 55 years (range 30-65), median creatinine value was 5.4 mg/dl (range 1.5-8.65), median creatinine clearance was 19 ml/min (range 10-48). Status of disease at transplant was near complete remission (nCR) in two patients, very good partial remission (VGPR) in one patient, partial remission (PR) in three patients, while three patients had active disease. Median Melphalan dose was 140 mg/mq (range 100-160), administered at day -2 and followed by autologous peripheral stem cells infusion at day 0 after DMSO removal (median number of CD34+ : 4.61 x 10 6 cells/Kg, range 3.74-7.87). All patients engrafted, with a median time to engraftment of 12 days (range 10-15); they all developed fever with only two positive blood coltures (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus warnerii). Median duration of hospitalization was 22 days (range 18-30). We observed grade II oral mucositis in four patients, ARDS-like pulmonary toxicity in one patient, severe gut mucositis in one patient. At day +90 (data available for 7 patients) six patients achieved a favourable response (2 CR, 3 VGPR, 1 PR).

Median duration of response (available for 7 patients) is 14 months (range 4-27). This study confi rms that Melphalan followed by auto-HSCT is feasible in patients with severe renal impairment; a dose of 140 mg/mq is well tolerated and this reduction doesn't jeopardize the effi cacy of the procedure.",

Pennese, M. Dargenio, M.R. De Paolis, P. Forese, R. Matera, G. Pugliese, G. Reddiconto, A. Valacca, C. Vergine, N. Di Renzo Vito Fazzi Hospital (Lecce, IT) Background: High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stemcell support has signifi cantly improved progression-free and overall survival of patients with untreated multiple myeloma (MM). Pre-transplant complete response (CR) and tumor reduction have been identifi ed as most relevant prognostic factors for long-term survival in untreated MM. Recently, thalidomide and bortezomib both given as single agent shown to be effective in previously treated MM. Since they have target different molecular pathways their combination is waited to be highly effective to induce high CR rate and tumor reduction before HDT with stem-cell support. We present early data of this regimen in untreated symptomatic MM patients. Patients and Methods: From March 2007 to October 2008 16 pts (M/F: 12/4) were enrolled in the study; median age was 57 years (range: 42-71), 47% were older 60 years; Most of pts had stage III according to Durie & Salmon (76%) and ISS score 2-3(76%). M-component was IgG 69% (11/16), IgA 19%, and non secretory 12%. Regimen: Bortezomib was given at 1.3 mg/m\u00b2 on days 1, 4, 8, 11 , thalidomide at dose of 100 mg PO daily, and dexamethasone (40 mg/die PO) was given the day of bortezomib and the day after (320 mg td for each cycle). All patients received 3 cycles of WTD every 4 weeks before CD34+ cell collection and high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m\u00b2). Deep-venous thrombosis prophylaxis was established in all pts consisting of aspirin 100 mg daily in 44% of pts, low-molecular weight heparin (28%) or low dose warfarin (28%). Results: all pts are evaluable for response to Velcade, Thalidomide and Dexamethasone (VTD) regimen and PBSC collection; 13 pts have been transplanted. After three VTD 88% of pts achieved PR including 47% of CR. VTD regimen was well tolerated with main toxicity consisting of WHO grade III peripheral neuropathy in 12% of pts. There was no chemotherapy reduction or delay due to toxicity. A median of 6.5 x 10 6 /kg of CD34+ cells (range: 2.7-11.6) was collected in 15 of 16 pts. The median CD 34+ cells infused was 3.2 x10 6 /kg (range: 2.0 -4.3). Times to platelet (20x10 9 /L) and granulocyte (500x10 9 /L) recovery were 13 and 10 days respectively. After VTD and transplant 10 of 13 patients achieved CR (75%) and 2 (15%) a VGPR. Conclusion: These very preliminary data suggest that VTD is effective and well tolerated regimen; high response rate without compromising PBSC collection makes it a good option for initial treatment of MM although more pts and longer follow-up are required. Introduction: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) became standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) under the age of 65 years. We routinely perform ASCT for newly diagnosed MM since 1996 in our department. Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed all 225 transplants in 136 patients done for MM from 1996 till 2007. 210 transplants were autologous (195x Mel200, 15x Mel100 for elderly patients), 15 transplants were allogenic (13x reducedintensity conditioning Bu-Flu-ATG or Flu-Cy, 1x myeloablative Bu-Mel, 1x twin sibling). Median age of patients was 56 years (27-74). We analyzed overall survival (OS) and progressionfree survival (PFS) regarding conditioning, stage, complete or very good partial remission (CR, VGPR) achievement, renal impairment, single vs. double transplant and use of new drugs (thalidomide and bortezomib). Results: Estimated 10-years survival of the whole set of patients is 38% (median survival 55 months). Patients who underwent allogenic transplantation upfront had lower PFS (p= 0.0001) and OS (p=0.018) compared to those who had only ASCT. Patients with renal impairment had signifi cantly shorter OS than those without (p=0.03). Patients with Mel100 conditioning had trend towards worse OS than those with Mel200, however statistical signifi cance was not reached (p=0.08). We observed trend towards better outcome in patients treated with new drugs but signifi cance was not reached (p=0.052). Reaching CR or VGPR was surprisingly not translated into better OS (p=0.29) and PFS (p=0.27). Also stage of the disease and whether single or double trasnplant was used did not make any signifi cant difference in the outcome. Conclusion: Stem cell transplantation greatly improves outcome of patients with MM. Poor outcome of allogenic transplantation in our group of patients is related to high transplant related mortality (20% vs. 0.4%) and unexpected high relapse rate. However in this group are two long term survivors who are disease free for more than 10 years. There is a trend towards better survival, when new drugs are incorporated at any time in the course of the disease as an addition to ASCT. This fact supports hypothesis that use of new drugs with ASCT should translate into better long-term outcome. Our results also suggest that Mel100 regimen is insuffi cient and other treatment options should be offered to older patients. This is in good agreement with results of recent clinical trials. Supported by project MZO00179906. We evaluated an up-date of the combination of high-dose therapy and autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells transplantation (AHPCT) followed by a reduced intensity conditioning and allotransplantation (RICT) in de novo multiple myeloma (MM) patients (Martino et al. AJH 81:973-978, 2006) . 20 subjects with stage III MM (median age 52 years, range 40-64) received high dose melphalan (200 mg/m\u00b2) followed by AHPCT previously collected after cyclophosphamide (4 g/m\u00b2) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). After 3-4 months from APBSCT, the patients underwent RICT, consisting of fl udarabine 90 mg/m\u00b2 + cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m\u00b2 on days. Graftversus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 12 patients (8 patients developed chronic GVHD); 5 patients developed CMV antigenemia and were treated pre-emptively with ganciclovir. No transplant related mortality was shown. Response was simultaneously measured by both electrophoresis (EP) and immunofi xation (IF); when IF was negative, patients were classifi ed in complete remission (CR) and when it remained positive, near CR (nCR). After a median follow up of 62,2 months post AHPCT, the OS and EFS are 62.2 and 36.2 months, respectively. Overall, the CR + nCR rate after dose-reduced allograft was enhanced from 30 to 70%. A correlation not statistically signifi cant between GVHD and EFS was found. In conclusion, this up-date confi rm that an up-front tandem strategy with RICT following autografting is feasible and induces high CR/nCR rate in MM. It is open the debates around the results gotten in terms of OS and EFS.",

Frattini, R. Di Bella, M. Sorio, S. Ledro, C. Perbellini, D. de Sabata, F. Benedetti Bone Marrow Transplant Unit (Verona, IT) Introduction: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a fatal disease with a median survival of 3-4 years. The standard therapy in pts aged <65 years was, in the last years, VAD or VAD-like regimens followed by high dose Cyclophosphamide (Cy) and Alkeran (L-PAM) with support of peripheral stem cells (PBSC). Thalidomide (Thali) alone or associated to chemotherapy (CT) has showed considerable activity. Its effi cacy as maintenance therapy is still under investigation. Patients and methods: We considered a conventional CT (3 cycles of VAD or VAD-like regimen), high dose Cy (7 g/m\u00b2 i.v.) and PBSC harvest, followed by single or tandem (when disease still present) high dose L-PAM (200 mg/m\u00b2 i.v.) with rescue of PBSC (CD34+>4x10 6 /Kg). All pts were in stage II/III, according to Durie and Salmon. Thali (100 mg/die) was given to all pts regardless the response and discontinued at the time of relapse or progression or because of toxicities. No anti-thrombotic prophylaxis was administered. Between January 1999 and October 2007, 95 consecutive pts were treated, 90 valuable, median age 55 (33-66), male/female 50/40, M component IgG/IgA/IgD/monoclonal light chain and non-secretory MM were 51/22/3/12 and 2, respectively. All pts completed induction and high dose CT. One toxic death occurred. Thali (100 mg/day) was started within 3 months from transplant in 68 pts; 22 could not be treated because of refusal (4), progression disease (9), allergic reactions (3) or neurological toxicities (6). Results: At transplant, 13/90 (14%) were in very good partial remission or complete remission (VGPR+CR according to EBMT criteria), further 33 pts (30%) reached the CR after transplant, for a total of 46/90 CR (51%) at the end of the program. We compared the number of responses (VGPR+CR), the treatment-free interval (TFI) and overall survival (OS) in the 2 groups of pts. The median follow up was 42 months. The VGPR+CR rate was 64% (44/68) in the group treated with Thali versus 50% (11/22) in the remaining pts. With Thali we obtained further 9 CR+VGPR/33 pts not in remission after transplant (27%). Comparing the 2 groups, the TFI was 37 and 22 months, the OS was 47 and 37 months, respectively (p<0.08). Conclusions: Low dose Thali following single or tandem autotransplant appears to be a safe and feasible treatment not only as maintenance, but also as consolidation therapy, improving the rate of response (VGPR+CR), delaying the need of subsequent therapy and improving the OS, with an acceptable toxicity.",

At diagnosis, 24/98pts had a del(13), and 65/179 had high levels of beta2microglobulin. PBSC were mobilized in steady state in 135 cases, after cyclo-phosphamide alone in 53 cases or associated with other drugs in 9 cases. The number of apheresis were 1 (n=65), 2 (n=31), 3 (n=16), 4 (n=18), 6 (n=1) and 8 (n=1) . During mobilization, we used GCSF in 179 cases, GM-CSF in 5cases, SCF in 4 cases and associations of GM-CSF or SCF with GCSF in 9 (4.5%) cases. The median number of infused cells were: TNC 5x10 7 /kg (1-59), CFU-GM 70.5x10 4 /kg (0-2616) and CD34+cells 3x10 6 / kg (0-27); 115 (58%) received a number of CD34+cells<4x10 6 / kg and 82 (42%) \u2265 4x10 6 /kg. After transplantation, 156(79%) received growth factors [1 GM-CSF, 148 G-CSF and 7 SCF]. The median number of RBC and Pt transfusions were 0 [0-23] and 1 [0-20] respectively. The median number of days with neutrophils <0.5G/L was 6 (0-33) and with Pt<50G/L 17 and the median length of hospitalization was 18 days (14-54). The probability of 5-year overall and event-free survival were 64.3% (56.3-73.4%) and 32.4% (24.9-42.2%).

Using a conditional logistic-regression model, we observed a signifi cant negative impact of interval diagnosis-T (p=0.05) on length of hospitalization and RBC transfusions. A multivariate analysis showed a signifi cant positive impact of CFU-GM number [HR=1 (1000-1.002) (p=0.03)] and growth factor use after transplantation [HR=0.55 (0.36-0.85) (p=0.005)] on the number of days with less than 0.5 G/L neutrophils and a significant negative impact of CD34+cell<4 x10 6 /kg on the number of days with less than 50G/L Pt ([HR=1.65 (1.09-2.50) (p=0.01)].",

Attolico (1) Primary Plasma Cell Leukemia (PPCL) is an aggressive and rare variant of Multiple Myeloma (MM). Allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) results in sustained longterm OS, suggesting a possible graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Relapse or progression after HSCT are common and outcome is poor. No data are available about Lenalidomide as salvage therapy for PPCL relapsed after HSCT. We report a 41 year-old woman with PPCL (IgA kappa monoclonal component (MC), 32% immature plasmacells in peripheral blood, 50% immature plasmacells CD38/CD138/sIgkappa+, CD19/CD56/ CD45-in the bone marrow). She received six Hyper-CVAD courses achieving Complete Remission (CR) and, after blood stem cells collection, underwent ASCT (Melphalan 200mg/m\u00b2 followed by reduced intensity conditioning HSCT from HLA identical brother (thiotepa 5mg/Kg, fl udarabine 30mg/m\u00b2, melphalan 140mg/m\u00b2. Full donor chimerism was documented at day +90. At day +138 she relapsed with cytogenetics showing a complex hyperdiploid karyotype. Bortezomib (1,3mg/m\u00b2) and Dexamethasone (40mg) (days 1,4,8,11) were started without response; as a second-line, cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m\u00b2 on days 1, 8, 15 ) was added to Bortezomib and Dexamethasone. Nevertheless disease progressed and full donor chimerism was lost; therefore Lenalidomide (25mg/day, 1-21) and Dexamethasone (40 mg/day 1, 8, 15, 22) were administered. At the end of the fi rst course the patient developed a skin rash, hyperbilirubinemia and increased liver enzymes, compatible with acute S153 GVHD, treated with methilprednisolone (2 mg/Kg/day). The patient showed a quick improvement with reduction of MC and abnormal plasmacells in the bone marrow. After six courses of Lenalidomide the patient is in CCR, with complete donor chimerism and normal cytogenetics; a mild cGVHD persists, requiring low dose steroids. We describe here the fi rst case of a patient with relapsed and chemorefractory PPCL after allogeneic HSCT, who achieved a CCR with Lenalidomide; moreover, this is the fi rst case of response to Lenalidomide associated with development of GVHD. The mechanism of the GVL/GVM is largely unknown. T and NK cells might exert an alloimmune reaction. In this case we hypothesize that the strong antiproliferative effect of Lenalidomide could have reduced the leukemia burden, making the GVL effect stronger. Furthermore Lenalidomide could have stimulated donor T/NK cells, as suggested by experimental data.",

Palifermin, a recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor, has been approved to decrease incidence and severity of oral mucositis and is associated with rash, edema/erythema and sensations of increased tongue thickness. We report on a 65 year-old female patient with IgG kappa myeloma in ISS I stage who underwent chemomobilization of APBCs followed by HD melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2. She was included in an open-label study to receive palifermin from day -6 to +2 with APBC retransfusion on day 0. On day +10 the patient complained of severe unilateral headache and diplopia. On clinical examination she had ophthalmoplegia, partial visual loss down to 0.1 and exophthalmos of the left eye. Initial cranial MRI revealed infl ammation in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses while the subsequent one showed diffuse enhancement of superior orbital fi ssure and orbital apex consistent with Tolosa Hunt syndrome. Painful ophthalmoplegia as well as exophthalmos responded to high-dose dexamethasone with a quick recovery of visual acuity to 0.8. Extensive radiographic and laboratory work-up including CSF did reveal neither signs of specifi c infection nor of recurrence of myeloma. Following haematological recovery both typical signs of palifermin-induced adverse effects as well as elevated CRP levels normalized while several attempts in tapering corticosteroid doses were followed by prompt worsening of visual loss. Eight weeks from APBC transplantation the patient was in excellent clinical shape except persistent Tolosa Hunt syndrome. We repeated bone marrow and serological assessments of myeloma that was confi rmed to be in VGPR, cranial MRI and, eventually, performed an 18F FDG positron emission tomography (PET) to exclude possible extramedullary involve-ment. Testing for infectious agents was uneventful. Findings in the latter examinations were consistent with unspecifi c infl ammation of the orbital apex. The patient received local irradiation that allowed cessation of corticosteroid treatment. We conclude Tolosa Hunt-like syndrome in this case to be secondary due to a specifi c pharmacologic adverse effect of palifermin rather than an immune-mediated infl ammation since myeloablative treatment is considered to be one of the most effective means of immunosuppression. Introduction: POEMS syndrome is a rare plasmatic cell dyscrasia, which is associated with overproduction of VEGF and characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammapathy, and skin changes. A specifi c treatment for this disease is not established. In recent reports, high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT), performed in early stage can improve clinical symptoms, especially for polyneuropathy. We describe the clinical course of a patient with POEMS syndrome in advanced stage and unresponsive to standard chemotherapy, treated successfully with APBSCT. Case report: A 47-year-old man was admitted to Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation of Medical University in Lublin with quadriparesis, hepatosplenomegaly, sclerotic bone lesion, acrocyanosis, IgG lambda gammapathy and thrombocytosis. There was no increased number of plasmatic cells in bone marrow smear. The fi rst symptoms of disease were appeared three years ago and diagnosis of POEMS was established 18 months ago. The patient was unresponsive to chemotherapy consisted with cyclophosphamide and prednisone, so we decided to perform APBSCT. Peripheral blood stem cells were collected after mobilization by cyclophosphamide (4g/m\u00b2) and G-CSF. The number of collected CD34+ cells was 12x10 6 /kg. The conditioning regimen was high dose melphalan (140 mg/m\u00b2). The number of transplanted CD34+ cells was 4x10 6 /kg. The post-transplantation course was complicated by fever with no identifi able infectious etiology, diarrhoea, cutaneous rash and swelling without hipoalbuminaemia (engraftment syndrome?). Neutrophil (0.5 G/l) and platelet (20 G/l) engraftment occurred on days 11 and 13, respectively. The improvement was manifested by disappearance of gammapathy and organomegaly. The correction of neurological symptoms was unsatisfactory. Therefore thalidomide in a dose of 50 mg/day was applied. The second autologous transplantation is planned in January 2009. Conclusion: Our experience suggests that APBSCT may be valuable method of treatment even in advanced stage of POEMS syndrome. The effect of thalidomide and second transplantation will be presented during EBMT meeting. Aim of this study is to assess survival in a large cohort of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in Italy between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2005 . Over this period 563 patients were given HDC and HSCT, in 36 Italian Centers. General information regarding these patients was obtained from the GITMO Registry and all Centers were then contacted for additional data. During the nineties the number of HSCT, along with the number of reporting centers for BC, increased progressively until 1999. In the following years a progressive decline in the number of HSCT for BC has been observed. In the nineties a dramatic shift towards a widespread use of blood progenitors occurred. Transplant related mortality, i.e. any death not related to the disease occurring within the fi rst 100 days after transplant, has been 2%. Complete data set has been obtained so far from 17 centers for 330 patients (1 male). Median age at transplant was 43 years; premenopausal patients were 68%, HR+ 66%. Fifty % of patients had visceral metastases at time of transplant. Analysis of clinical parameters including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the whole population and in subsets of patients based on prognostic factors (ie status at transplant, menopausal status, hormonal status) demonstrated: i) PFS and OS at 5 years in the whole population were 18% and 36%, respectively. ii) HDC provided signifi cantly more benefi t in younger patients, in patients harbouring hormone receptor positive tumors and in women with chemosensitive disease (48% OS at 5 years in patients transplanted in complete remission). Full data will be presented at the meeting.",

Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has the potential to confer a durable graft versus tumor immunity, but may be limited by signifi cant toxicity in heavily pre-treated children. Therefore we have investigated the feasibility of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allo-HSCT in 6 patients with refractory or relapsed NB. All patients received at least 4 lines of chemotherapy including auto-HSCT with melphalan 140mg/m\u00b2 + busulfan 600 mg/m\u00b2 regimen. Patients were in PR or VGPR at the time of RIC allo-HSCT. Donor cell sources were: related CB 6/6 (1pt), related BM 10/10 (3 pts), unrelated BM 10/10 (1 pt) unrelated PBSC 10/10 (1 pt). RIC allo-HSCT conditioning was : Fludarabine 180 mg/m\u00b2, Busulfan IV 6.4 to 9.6 mg/kg, and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin 2.5 mg/kg for related and 5 mg/kg for unrelated recipients. One pt received exclusively TBI 2 grays as conditioning regimen. GVHD prophylaxis was cyclosporin (CSA) alone 3 mg/kg IV starting on day -1. In the absence of grade > II acute GvHD, CSA was tapered 25% weekly starting on day+30. After RIC allo-HSCT four pts responded, and 2 pts progressed. Maximal peripheral chimerism was 100% at day+60. Four patients had evidence of GVHD and 4 had \"evidence\" of graft-versus neuroblastoma effect (disappearance or decrease of blood/ marrow tyrosine hydroxylase transcript and /or MIBG spots after the induction of aGvHD by withdrawal of immunosuppressive drugs or by DLI and reappearance of neuroblastoma after the control of GvHD by immunosuppressive drugs). Maximal grade for aGVHD was III skin and liver (1pt). One patient had chronic skin GVHD. Four patients are alive, with no evidence of disease, with median time after RIC allo-HSCT of 21.8 months [3.2 -52.7] [ Table 1 ]. Conclusion: RIC allo-HSCT appears feasible and safe in patients with advanced NB. Additional studies of therapeutic strategies used donor-derived effector cells (alloreactive NK cells or T cells) and possible graft versus-tumor effects are warranted in this group of patients.",

Therefore, we started to investigate the potential of allogeneic SCT as a treatment for non-curable prostate cancer. A patient underwent allogeneic SCT from his HLA-identical sister after a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen as treatment for his metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. The patient was treated with donor lymphocyte infusions after SCT due to threatening rejection. Frequencies of prostate-specifi c T cells in the peripheral blood of the patient, sibling donor and a group of control individuals were determined by fl ow cytometry using tetrameric and pentameric HLA A2 complexes containing peptides derived from the prostate specifi c antigen (PSA). Cytotoxic activity of PSA-peptide-specifi c T-cells against peptide-pulsed target cells was analyzed ex vivo by 51Cr-release assays. Stable clinical and laboratory remission lasting for more than 5 years was observed after SCT. Using HLA containing pentamers with PSA-derived peptides we could detect prostate-specifi c CD8+ T cells in this patient in high frequencies over several months. Furthermore, higher frequencies of PSA-specifi c Tcells were revealed in the peripheral blood of the patient and female controls as compared with male healthy controls.",

Eighty-four consecutive children entered this program. All patients at fi rst relapse (with the exception of late relapse and isolated single pulmorary metastasis) were enrolled in the period 1994-2004 in a protocol including sequential high-dose chemotherapy: cyclophosphamide 7g/sqm+G-CSF and PBSC apheresis, etoposide 2g/sqm + G-CSF \u00b1 further apheresis, and mitoxantrone 60mg/ sqm+melphalan 180mg/sqm followed by peripheral blood stem cell rescue (PBSC) rescue. Radiotherapy was given on individual basis on the site(s) of relapse. Twenty-one consecutive patients were treated according to this program. The median age at relapse was 16 years, and the median time to relapse was 28 months (range 12-126). The site of relapse was: skeleton only in 7 patients, lungs only in 6, skeleton+lungs in 7, local in 1. Neither disease progression, nor treatment discontinuation due to toxicity occurred during the treatment. An adequate PBSC harvesting (>3x106 CD34+/kg) was obtained in 20 patients (95%) who were included in the present analysis. Mean time for take of PMN and platelets after PBSC was 11 and 19 days, respectively. No toxic death was recorded after the stem cell rescue. As to September 2008, median follow-up from relapse was 88 months.

Patients and methods: Between 2001-2007 TREO was administered instead of oral BU in M CHT before auto-HSCT in 10 patients aged from 8 months to 21 year (median age: 4.5 year). There were 7 girls and 3 boys. Diagnosis were as follows: NBL in 7 children (5 in CR1, 1 in CR2, 1 in PR) and ES/PNET in 3 children (2 in CR1,1 in PR). All patients demonstrated prior auto-HSCT either contraindication for use of BU (4/10) or were too young for its oral administration (6/10), while BU i.v. was unavailable at that time. In all patients M-CHT consisted of TREO in total dose of 36 g/m\u00b2 (12 g/m\u00b2/day i.v. for 3 consecutive days) and melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2 i.v. in one dose. Supportive care was carried out according to HR NBL-1/SIOPEN and Euro-Ewing protocols. Results: All children demonstrated engraftment and were discharged from hospital after procedure. None patient experienced organ toxicities greater then II WHO or live-threatening infection. 5/10 children relapsed (3 with NBL-2 in CR 1 and 1 in CR 2, 2 with ES/PNET -1 in CR1, 1 in PR) at median time of 13 months from auto-HSCT (range 6-24 months) and 4 of them subsequently died of disease progression. 6/10 patients are alive, including 5 in CCR (4 with NBL and 1 ES/PNET) since auto-HSCT with median observation time of 49 months (range 14-76 months). Conclusions: 1. M-CHT with TREO and MEL for auto-HSCT in patients with NBL and ES/PNET and high risk of BU-related complications demonstrates low organ toxicity. 2. Results of auto-HSCT after M-CHT consisted of TREO and MEL in children with NBL and ES/PNET seems to be comparable with those achieved with BU, but this observation need to be confi rmed within prospective trial in larger group of patients.",

In the current study, we engrafted NSG mice with human CD34+ HSC to provide a model for analyzing the role of patient-derived antigen presenting cells for the induction of GVH-and GVL-reactivity and to evaluate reactivity to human alloantigens of ex vivo engineered T cell allografts for improved immunotherapy. Following reconstitution of busulfan conditioned neonatal or irradiated (300 cGy) adult NSG recipients with 1x10 5 to 1x10 6 purifi ed CD34+ adult HSC and weekly i.v. injections of human IL-7 linked to the Fc-domain (Fc-IL7), human CD45+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected as early as 30 and 60 days (d) post reconstitution of newborn and adult mice, respectively. Following monocyte recruitment signifi cant numbers of T-, B-, NKand dendritic cells (DCs) were found in spleen (SPL) and bone marrow of both newborn and adult recipients by fl ow cytometry and immunhistology 30d to 60d after initial screening. However, as reconstitution of newborns resulted in thymopoiesis of human CD3+ cells and better lympho-and myelopoiesis as compared to adult mice, further studies were performed in HSC engrafted newborn recipients. Functional analyses of lymphocytes grown in humanized NSG mice revealed that human CD3+ T cells isolated from SPL and challenged ex vivo with i) murine NSG derived DCs, ii) human HLA-mismatched DCs or iii) HSC donor derived (autologous) DCs elicit immune reactivity to human but not murine alloantigens. These results and further studies on ex vivo analyzed allo-and xenoimmunity of naive HLA-matched and HLA-mismatched CD8+ T cells transferred into HSC engrafted NSG recipients will be presented to demonstrate T cell alloimmune responses in humanized mice and to show that our model can be used to evaluate residual GVH reactivity of CD8+ donor T cells in HLA-matched or haploidentical settings.",

Bernardi, D. Clerici, A. Crotta, C. Messina, A. Assanelli, C. Corti, M.T. Lupo Stanghellini, M. Marcatti, C. Bonini, F. Ciceri San Raffaele Scientifi c Institute (Milan, IT) ATG-Fresenius S (ATG-F) is a product of purifi ed, concentrated polyclonal immunoglobulin G from hyperimmune serum of rabbits immunized with the human lymphoblast T-cell line. It induces immunosuppression; very recently, the addition of ATG-F to CyA/Mtx prophylaxis resulted in lower incidence of acute and chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) without increase of relapse or mortality rates in a phase III trial of HLAmatched unrelated stem cell transplantation (SCT). The polyclonality of ATG-F is responsible for its effects on the immune system through different mechanisms: T-cell depletion through complement-dependent lysis and T-cell activation and apoptosis; modulation of molecules involved in leukocyte/endothelium interactions; induction of apoptosis in B-cells; interference with dendritic cells and induction of regulatory immune cells. However, the slow clearance of ATG-F administered before allogeneic SCT may delay immune reconstitution, increase the risk of disease relapse and impair the activity of a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). In vivo pharmacokinetics of ATG-F specifi c antilymphocyte fraction is warranted for the planning of appropriate timing of post-SCT adoptive immunotherapy with donor T-cells. We studied 15 patients with hematologic malignancies, who underwent allo-SCT from mismatched family or unrelated donors, after a conditioning regimen based on treosulfan and fl udarabine. 13 patients received ATG-F (10 mg/kg/d on days -4,-3,-2 before SCT), 2 patients did not receive in vivo T-cell depletion. We collected serum samples from the fi rst ATG-F dose to 54 days after SCT. We used a fl ow cytometry-based assay to detect the concentration of free T-cell specifi c rabbit IgG (SRIgG), corresponding to the serum biological activity against human T-cells and compared it to the levels of unspecifi c rabbit IgG (RIgG), that lack anti-T-cell function. Preliminary data show that both SRIgG and RIgG reached their concentration peak 64 hours after the fi rst ATG administration. However, the terminal elimination half-life of SRIgG is significantly shorter than the half-life of RIgG: 15 vs 69 days, indicating that 10 days after SCT SRIgG titers may have reached sub-therapeutic levels. These results suggest that in vivo specifi c activity of rabbit ATG Fresenius against T-cells disappears from circulation between days +7 to +10 after the last administration. According to these results current policy of delaying DLI after day +21 post-SCT should be revisited. A. Luyckx, L. De Somer, O. Rutgeerts, F. Ulloa-Montoya, M. Geeraerts, C. Lenaerts, M. Waer, C. Verfaillie, A.D. Billiau University of Leuven (Leuven, BE) Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells, a novel type of bone marrow stem cells with extensive proliferation potential and a broad differentiation capacity (Mesoderm including a.o. endothelium, hepatocyte like cells), are very promising as a source for regenerative cell therapy. In analogy with classical lineage-restricted mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), of which the immunosuppressive behavior is well documented and is being clinically explored, we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of mouse MAPC (mMAPC) in in vitro/in vivo assays of T cell alloreactivity. We used mMAPC (mMAPC-2) and mClone-1 (cell population isolated under MAPC conditions with phenotypic and functional characteristics of MSC) (C57BL/6 background), described in Ulloa et al, Genome Biol 2007. Mit-C-treated mMAPC-2/ mClone-1 were added to MLRs (C57BL/6 CD4+ T-cells stimulated with Mit-C-treated CD11c+ BALB/c DCs) at increasing suppressor/effector (S:E) ratios. mClone-1 mediated a dosedependent profound suppression of T-cell proliferation. By contrast, mMAPC-2 exhibited a bimodal immunomodulatory effect, with immunostimulation at low and immunosuppression at high S:E ratios. Transwell assays showed that the mMAPC-2 immunostimulatory effect is cell-contact dependent, whereas the immunesuppressive effects (of mMAPC-2 \u00e1nd mClone-1) are contact-independent. Inhibition assays demonstrated that NO and PGE2 -in part -are involved in mClone-1-mediated, but not mMAPC-2-mediated suppression. Other mediators are being tested. Neither mMAPC-2 nor mClone-1 suppressed the development of graft-versus-host disease induced by C57BL/6 T cells in NK-cell-depleted CB17SCID mice. In Popliteal Lymph Node Assays, mClone-1 consistently suppressed the expansion of alloreactive C57BL/6 T-cells in NK-cell-depleted CB17SCID mice, whereas mMAPC-2 in this assay mediated either stimulatory or suppressive effects. In conclusion, mouse MAPC exhibit complex immunomodulatory activities, in part comparable to those of classical MSC. Further study is focused on the environmental factors infl uencing the bimodal mMAPC immune behavior.",

Spyridonidis (2), J. Finke (1) (1)Freiburg University (Freiburg, DE); (2)Patras University (Patras, GR) Animal and human studies have shown that after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) low percentage of epithelial cells containing donor-derived genome emerge. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unknown. We investigated using an in vitro model if horizontal gene transfer could account as a possible mechanism for epithelial chimerism after allogeneic HCT. Briefl y, keratinocyte HaCaT cells (Y-chromosome neg) were cocultivated with non-apoptotic Jurkat cells (Y chromosome pos) or Jurkat cells in which apoptosis was induced with Camptothecin. Jurkat cells were labeled with CMFDA or BrdU in order to track the fate of apoptotic bodies and genomic material respectively. HaCaT cells co-cultivated with non-apoptotic Jurkat cells for 24-72h did not show any CMFDA, BrdU or FISH-Y chromosome signal. In contrast, cocultivation of HaCaT cells with Jurkat apoptotic bodies resulted in CMFDA signal in 28% of the HaCaT cells, BrdU signal in 18% and Y-chromosome signal in 3% of the cells. Importantly, BrdU and Y-chromosome signals were observed in the cytoplasm and within the nucleus of the HaCaT cells as evaluated by confocal microscopy. Metaphases from the BrdU+ HaCaT cells confi rmed that the BrdU signal was located within the isolated chromosomes suggesting the creation of hybrid chromosomes. Incorporation of the transferred genomic material in the HaCaT host genome was inhibited by cytochalasin (inhibitor of phagocytosis), increased 3-fold by bafylomicin (inhibition of lysosomal degradation) and 2-fold when HaCat cells were repeatedly exposed to Jurkat apoptotic bodies. In order to evaluate expression of the transferred genomic material, we cocultivated HacaT cells with intact or apoptotic GFP-transfected JvM cells. Cocultivation with non-apoptotic GFP+ cells resulted in no GFP expression in Hacat cells. In contrast, cocultivation of Hacat cells with GFP+ apoptotic bodies resulted in a 6-fold increase in the mean GFP fl uorescence in HaCaT cells. Taken together, our in vitro model suggests horizontal gene transfer through apoptotic bodies as a possible mechanism explaining epithelial chimerism after allogeneic HCT. The canine non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NM-SCT) model has become accepted during the last decades as a good preclinical model for the development of new transplantation strategies. Information on factors associated with outcome after allogeneic SCT are a prerequisite for designing new risk adapted transplantation protocols. Here we report on a retrospective analysis aimed at identifi cation of risk factors of graft survival in the canine SCT model. Data from 39 consecutive MHC-identical allogeneic NM-SCT, performed between 2003-2008 on different protocols, have been evaluated in regards to allograft survival. 23 recipients were male (59%). The median age was 14 months (range 7-29) and the median weight was 12.4 kg (9.8-19.0). Conditioning consisted of 1 Gy (n=20) or 2 Gy (n=19) total body irradiation (TBI) based regimen. CSA (days -1 to +35) in combination with MMF (days 0 to +27) or everolimus (days 0 to +27) were used for immunosuppression. A median cell dose of 3.6 total nucleated cells (TNC)/kg (1.6-11.4) was infused. Follow-up was restricted to 26 weeks after SCT. Uni-and multivariate Cox analyses were used to calculate the infl uence of age, weight, TBI dose, gender of donor/recipient, type of immunosuppression and cell dose of TNC and CD34+ cells on the outcome of SCT. Initial engraftment occurred in all dogs. Animals that received a 1Gy conditioning eventually rejected their graft after median 10 weeks (7-16). After 2Gy TBI 9/17 dogs (53%) achieved stable long-term engraftment (>26 weeks). 2 dogs died in week 10. Univariate analysis revealed TBI dose, gender, type of immunosuppression and TNC dose as factors infl uencing graft survival (p<0.2 for each). In multivariate analysis 3 factors were identifi ed as independent risk factors for graft rejection: TBI dose (1Gy vs. 2 Gy; HR 12.5, CI 2.6-59.8, p=0.002), gender (female vs. male recipients; HR 3.2, CI 1.2-8.1, p=0.016), TNC cell count (<3x10 8 TNC/kg vs. >7x10 8 TNC/kg; HR 7.4, CI 0.9-64.4, p=0.069). PBMC chimerism >30% and granulocyte chimerism >70% 4 weeks after SCT were identifi ed as independent predictors for stable engraftment (p=0.005 and 0.010, respectively). In summary, these data support that even in low dose TBI based regimen irradiation dose is important. In addition female sex as recipient and TNC dose were identifi ed as risk factors of graft survival. Chimerism at 4 weeks post SCT was predictive for long-term engraftment in the canine SCT model.",

Kr\u00f6ger University Cancer Center (Hamburg, DE) The low bone marrow milieu by myelofi brosis (MF) may predispose to poor graft function (PGF) after allogeneic stem cell transplantations (allo-SCT). We investigated the effi cacy of CD34+ stem cell boost (SCB) in MF patients with PGF. The PGF was diagnosed in patient with 2 or 3 cytopenic counts (Hb<10g/ dL; neutrophil count <1.0x10 9 /L; platelet count <30x10 9 /L) for at least 2 consecutive weeks beyond day +14 post-transplant, with transfusion requirement and in the absence of severe graft versus host disease (GvHD) and relapse. A total of 8 patients (5 males and 3 females) with median age 61 year (range, 53 -66 y) underwent allo-SCT for MF (primary n=6, secondary n=2). Three patients were JAK2V617F mutated. All patients had received HLA-matched grafts from unrelated donors (peripheral blood stem cells, n=8) after reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) based on busulfan (10mg/kg) combined with fl udarabine (180mg/kg) and antithymocytic globuline (ATG) (60mg/kg). All patients succefully engrafted with leukocytes (median day 18), while platelet engraftment was observed in one patient at day 16 from allo-SCT. SCB was performed at median time point of 150 days after allo-SCT, when the median leukocyte and platelet counts were 2.3x10 9 /L and 38x10 9 /L, respectively and mean chimerism level was 95% (range, 80 -100%). Positive selection of CD34+ stem cells was performed on a CliniMACS device, achieving a median of 98.5% purity. The patients received a median of 3.8 x 10 6 /kg (range, 2.2-7.0x10 6 / kg) CD34+ cells and 0.16x10 5 /kg CD3+ T-lymphocytes (range, 0.01-0.5x10 5 /kg). Hemograms at days 30, 60, and 90 from SCB showed steadily increasing median leukocyte (0.6, 1.2, and 1.9 x10 9 /L) and platelet (58, 81, and 103 x10 9 /L) counts. Five of eight patients showed an increase in leukocyte count at day 30 from SCB, three of them showed also an increase in thrombocyte count. Of those, two patients showed the increase in leukocyte and thrombocyte counts further up to day 90 from SCB. Moreover, with those fi ve patients, the average time lag between transfusions increased from a 8 day to a 35 day time interval before and after SCB, respectively. Two patients developed acute GvHD: hepatic GvHD grade II and gut GvHD grade II 30 and 90 days from the SCB, respectively. Three patients did not show any signs of response. These preliminary results point to the possibility of safely improving graft function using CD34+ SCB in patients with PGF post allo-SCT for MF.",

Friedrich Children`s Hospital, University of Ulm (Ulm, DE) Objectives: We present 2 patients, a 10-years old boy and a 17years old girl with autosomal recessive Hyper-IgE-Syndrome (AR-HIES), who were treated by allogeneic SCT. So far there are no reports on SCT in AR-HIES. In both patients the main clinical features were recurrent bacterial infections (pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis) and uncontrollable infections by mollusca contagiosa, particular in the face and genital region, leading to considerable morbidity and psychological problems. Pathological laboratory values included eosinophilia, elevation of serum IgE (9.000-21.000 IU/ml), T-cell lymphopenia and impaired T-cell function. Indication for SCT was based on the risk of potentially lethal infections in this primary immunodefi ciency. Methods: A reduced-toxicity conditioning regimen was applied, including radioimmunotherapy, fl udarabine (160mg/m\u00b2), melphalan (140mg/m\u00b2) and anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin. GvHD-prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporinA and mycophenolate. Both patients had matched unrelated donors (10/10). Patient 1 received blood stem cells with a reduced T-cell number, patient 2 stem cells from red blood cell depleted bone marrow. Results: In both patients hematological reconstitution was uneventful, toxicity was mild, one patient showed GvHD \u00b0I of the skin. Infectious complications included EBV-reactivation in patient 1 and brain abscesses in patient 2, which resolved without clinical residuum. Follow-up period after SCT is 3 years in patient 1 and 7 months in patient 2. They are both in good clinical condition, showing full donor chimerism. Patient 1 is leading a normal life, free of severe infections. Infection by mollusca contagiosa resolved, eosinophilia disappeared, IgE levels, T-cell-number and -function normalized. Patient 2, now 7 months after SCT, shows a markable reduction of the mollusca contagiosa. She is still on antibiotics as treatment for the brain abscesses. Immunological reconstitution is progressing but not complete yet, eosinophilia disappeared, IgE levels decreased signifi cantly. Conclusion: The clinical post transplant course suggests SCT to be a curative therapeutic approach in patients with AR-HIES.",

However, it remains unclear whether mechanisms are responsible for enhanced engraftment. Recently, it was reported that innate immune sensor toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 were expressed on hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). These receptors greatly drove of HPCs to mature innate immune cells. Here, we investigated that TLR2 is responsible for rapid engraftment of PBSCs in allo-HSCT using murine model of PBSC transplantation (PBSCT). We found that TLR2 expression was dramatically up-regulated on G-CSF-mobilized PBSCs (gmPBSCs, lineage-c-kit+) compared with BM stem cells (BMSCs). However, TLR4 was very weakly expressed and there was no change. It was confi rmed that TLR2 was directly up-regulated by G-CSF on BMSCs. Treatment of TLR2 ligand Pam3CSK4 directly augmented differentiation of gmPBSC to mature monocytes/macrophages. This is much higher than BMSCs. These responses did not occur with both stem cells from TLR2-defi cient mice. Our results demonstrate that TLR2 signaling in gmPBSCs correlates with their differentiation resulting in improvement of engraftment, suggesting TLR2 is novel target for increasing allo-HSCT effi ciency to overcome engraft failure. A. Knueppel, S. Lange, A. Sekora, D. Killian, M. Freund, C. Junghanss University of Rostock (Rostock, DE) Background: CD4+CD25high regulatory T-cells (Tregs) can modulate immune responses following allogeneic hematopoietic S159 stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Canine Tregs have not been well characterized despite the fact that the canine allogeneic HSCT model has served as important preclinical model for decades. Here, we report on phenotypic and functional properties of canine Tregs. Methods: Canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were labeled with CD4, CD25 and Foxp3 for phenotypic analysis. CD4+CD25high cells were enriched from PBMCs for functional assays by using magnetic cell sorting (Miltenyi, enrichment for CD25high). Expansion of Tregs was done by culturing cells in IMDM supplemented with IL-2 (100 I.U./ml) for one week. For allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLCs) irradiated stimulator cells were cultured with allogeneic T-cells \u00b1 freshly isolated or expanded Tregs. Results: Canine Tregs can be characterized by their immune phenotype as CD4+, CD25high and Foxp3+. The median percentage of CD4+CD25highFoxp3+ Tregs within the CD4+ compartment of PB was 0.8% (range: 0.3 -4.6%, n=11). Expansion of canine Treg could be achieved up to median 12.4% (range: 2.2 -34.2%, n=6) after one-week-cultivation. In allogeneic MLCs freshly isolated Tregs as well as expanded Tregs suppressed signifi cantly allogeneic T-cell proliferation (48% and 88%, proliferation reduction compared to controls, respectively). Conclusion: Canine regulatory T-cells display similar characteristics as Tregs of other species such as a CD4+CD25highFoxp3+ phenotype and their ability to suppress allogeneic reactions. These data may pave the way to invesigate Tregs in the preclinical canine outbred allogeneic HSCT model. (2), E.

            "text": "Rationale: It was hypothesized that yolk sac hematopoiesis derives from hematoendothelial precursor called hemangioblast. While investigation of early steps of hematopoiesis in human embryos meets technical and ethical limitations, we propose the embryoid body (EB)/blast cell differentiation system that provides an outstanding alternative to early embryo for identifi cation of hemangioblast and provides an easy access to a large number of cells representing earliest stages of hematopoiesis. Methods: We used two-step EB differentiation system that involved induction of mesoderm followed by stimulation of hemato/vasculopoiesis. The pattern of gene expression was monitored by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Cell suspensions from EB culture (day 0-6) were seeded in semisolid medium supplemented with cytokines. Obtained colonies have been characterized by Wright-Giemsa staining, immunofl uorescence, FACS and RT-PCR. Their hematopoietic potential was further assessed in CFU assay and in endothelial cell differentiation culture. Results: Cells obtained from EBs formed homogenous grapelike colonies composed of 30-50 cells (blast-like cells, BLCs) on day 6 of culture. The occurrence of colony precursor cells was transient and peaked on day 3 of EB culture in association with expression of T (early mesoderm gene) and dramatic increase in hematopoietic/endothelial genes: CD34, CD31 and KDR. BLCs had homogenous morphology in Wright-Giemsa stain, but they differed in expression of markers of both immature hematopoietic and endothelial cells (CD31, CD34, VEcadherin, Flt-1) and mature differentiated cells (CD45, CD33, CD146). They expressed higher level of HLA class I molecules when compared to hES and EB cells. Importantly, these cells could be differentiated to hematopoietic cells forming CFU-M colonies containing macrophages, BFU-E containing nucleated red blood cells, and CFU-EM colonies composed of macrophages and nucleated erythrocytes. Cells of CFU-EM and BFU-E expressed both epsilon-and gamma-globin genes, but not adult-type gamma-globin. The BLCs could differentiate to endothelial cells which had the ability to take up Dil-Ac-LDL and formed vascular networks in Matrigel. Conclusions: 1) Our EB system recapitulates early yolk sac hematopoiesis.",

Introduction: Little is known about the formation of niches, local micro-environments required for stem-cell maintenance. Here we develop a novel in-vivo assay for adult haematopoietic stem-cell (HSC) niche formation in which isolated cells from fetal bone can form a functional ectopic bone marrow environment following transplantation under the kidney capsule. Results: With this assay, we identifi ed a population of progenitor cells with surface markers CD45-Tie2-alphaV+CD105+Thy1.1-(CD105+Thy1-) that, when sorted from 15.5 days post-coitum fetal bones and transplanted under the adult mouse kidney capsule, could recruit host-derived blood vessels, produce donor-derived ectopic bones through a cartilage intermediate and generate a marrow cavity populated by host-derived longterm reconstituting HSC (LT-HSC). In contrast, CD45-Tie2-alphaV+CD105+Thy1+ (CD105+Thy1+) fetal bone progenitors form bone that does not contain a marrow cavity. Suppressing expression of factors involved in endochondral ossifi cation, such as osterix and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), inhibited niche generation. CD105+Thy1-progenitor populations derived from regions of the fetal mandible or calvaria that do not undergo endochondral ossifi cation formed only bone without marrow in our assay. Conclusions: Collectively, our data implicate endochondral ossifi cation, bone formation that proceeds through a cartilage intermediate, as a requirement for adult HSC niche formation. In addition to identifying the limb-derived skeletal progenitor capable of endochondral ossifi cation and the basic mechanisms of HSC niche initiation, our study provides a functional framework by which future studies on HSC-niche interactions at the cellular level can be carried out. Introduction: Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) display immunomodulatory effects partially mediated by soluble factors like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and have been successfully used in the treatment of graft-versus-host-disease. Information about transcriptional mechanisms regulating hMSC function is scarce. Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) is a transcription factor known to control T-cell-dependent immune responses. In resting cells, NFAT is phosphorylated, cytoplasmic and S160 inactive, while upon stimulation NFAT is dephosphorylated by the phosphatase calcineurin, leading to nuclear translocation and activation of the protein. Inactivation of NFAT is mediated by several kinases, e.g. glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b). Little is known about expression, regulation or function of NFAT in hMSCs. Methods: Bone marrow-derived primary hMSCs were used in all experiments. NFAT and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) expression was determined by real time PCR and western blotting. Subcellular localization of NFAT was analyzed by confocal microscopy. NFAT and COX2 promotor activity was measured by luciferase assays. PGE2 concentration was analyzed by ELISA. Results: hMSCs express considerable levels of all NFAT family members (predominantly NFATc3 and NFATc4), with the exception of NFATc2. In untreated hMSCs, NFAT proteins are partially constitutively active, as judged by their phosphorylation and subcellular localization status. Dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NFAT are further induced by treatment with ionomycin and reversed by cyclosporin A, indicating that the regulation of NFAT in hMSCs occurs in a calcineurin-dependent manner. Inhibition of GSK3b leads to cyclosporin A-dependent nuclear accumulation of NFAT, emphasizing the presence of a constitutive active calcineurin pathway in hMSCs. Treatment of hMSCs with ionomycin and phorbol ester induces, while CsA attenuates, the expression of COX2 and PGE2, suggesting that these genes are transcriptional targets of NFAT in hMSCs. Conclusion: hMSCs show an NFAT expression profi le which is clearly distinct from that found in Jurkat T cells or CD34+ cells. Constitutive activation of NFAT in hMSCs suggests it may be involved in mediating biological properties of these cells, e.g. the modulation of lymphocyte function through the expression of PGE2. Dissection of NFAT-regulatory pathways and target genes in hMSCs will allow to identify and specifi cally manipulate hMSC functions. We isolated and expanded ex vivo MSCs from full-term UCB (UCB-MSCs) in the presence of a platelet lysate-(PL, 5%) additioned medium. UCB-MSCs were phenotypically and functionally characterized, in comparison to bone marrow-derived (BM) MSCs. Ten UCB units (median volume 45 ml, range 40-60), from full-term deliveries, were processed. Two of the 10 UCB units (UCB3 and UCB6) gave rise to MSC-like clones, which were expanded ex vivo and characterized. UCB-MSCs displayed the typical morphology, immunephenotype and differentiation capacity. Although displaying a rather low clonogenic effi ciency, UCB-MSCs showed a higher proliferative potential as compared to BM-MSCs. UCB3 and UCB6-MSCs entered senescence at passage (P) 10 and P11, respectively. Telomerase activity and hTERT transcripts analysis, as well as molecular karyotyping through array-CGH demonstrated lack of spontaneous transformation into tumor cells. The immunoregulatory effect of UCB-MSCs on alloantigen-specifi c immune response in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) was investigated, together with the mechanisms potentially responsible for this effect (PGE2 production, IDO activity). We found that, similarly to BM-MSCs, UCB-MSCs are able to: i) strongly inhibit alloantigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation; ii) decrease alloantigen-induced cytotoxic activity (CA); iii) increase secretion of IL-6 and IL-10 in MLC supernatant. While the addition of BM-MSCs to MLC increased the percentage of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+T cells, the addition of UCB-MSCs did not result in any increase of this cell subset. With the aim of understanding the biological mechanisms responsible for the immunosuppressive effect exerted by UCB-MSCs, in a second set of experiments, MLCs were carried out in the presence of IDO-or PGE2-specifi c inhibitors (INs). Results obtained in terms of alloantigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation documented that neither IDO-specifi c IN nor PGE2-specifi c IN were able to reverse the MSC-induced suppressive effect. At difference, a clear-cut effect of PGE2specifi c IN was observed when alloantigen-induced CA was evaluated, as addition of PGE2-specifi c IN to MLC was able to reverse the suppressive effect exerted by both UCB-MSCs and BM-MSCs; on the contrary, IDO-specifi c IN was not effective for both cell source. The differences between UCB-and BM-MSCs in terms of clonogenic effi ciency, proliferative capacity, mechanisms of action and immunomodulatory properties may be relevant for their clinical application.",

Hannemann, N. Kroeger, C. Lange, U. Bacher University of Hamburg (Hamburg, DE) Introduction: The JAK2V617F mutation (JAK2V617Fmut) is frequent in the chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) . An open question is the level of cell differentiation, where the JAK2V617Fmut occurs. The existence of a common mesoderm cell as origin of both hematopoietic and mesenchymal progenitor cells was postulated e.g. by experiments in the mouse model as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) were demonstrated to be able to initiate hematopoietic reconstitution and stroma cell formation in syngeneic mice (Lange et al., 1999) . Screening for the JAK2V617Fmut in MSC derived from MPN patients carrying the mutation might contribute to insights in the differentiation level where the mutation occurs. In a series of 5 JAK2V617F mutated myelofi brosis patients of Pieri et al. (Leuk Res, 2007) , MSC were tested negative for the mutation. Methods: We performed screening for the JAK2V617Fmut by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in unseparated bone marrow (BM)/ peripheral blood (pB) (sensitivity: 0.01%) of MPN patients. From these, we selected 7 aspirable patients with myelofi brosis (primary: n=3; secondary: n=4; 5 males, 2 females) before/after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) (who all showed evidence of the JAK2V617Fmut at the time of analysis in BM/pB) for parallel screening of in vitro expanded MSC for the mutation. MSC were expanded until reaching confl uence of 90- 95% (Lange et al., Journal of Cell Physiol, 2007) . Quantifi cation of the JAK2V617Fmut was performed by correlation with the HCK gene for normalization (Kr\u00f6ger et al., Blood, 2007) . Results: MSC cultivation was performed in one patient before and in 6 patients after SCT with dose reduced conditioning and peripheral blood stem cells from related/unrelated donors. Six cases showed negative results after the fi rst passage of MSC, although all patients showed systemic evidence of the JAK2V617Fmut in BM/pB (median 3.85%; range: 0.005%-32.7%). One case showed a high JAK2V617F/HCK ratio of 32.7% in bone marrow, while MSC revealed a mutation ratio of 0.004%, which was probably due to contamination of MSC with remaining hematopoietic cells. Discussion: We here found no evidence of involvement of the MSC in the JAK2V617F mutation using a highly sensitive realtime based PCR assay. This study gives further confi rmation to the hypothesis that MSC are not affected by this mutation and S161 do not serve as common progenitor cell for stromal and hematopoietic cells in MSC.",

Iacopino Bone Marrow Unit (Reggio Calabria, IT) Background: The genome-wide analysis provides a modern approach to reveal intrinsic properties of stem cells such as the pluripotency, self-renewal and commitment. To elucidate similarities and differences about transcriptome we conducted a direct stringent comparison between stem cells of different cell source: human cord blood (HUCB) and classical adult peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs). Materials and Methods: PBSCs were obtained from 10 healthy donors treated with human (rh) G-CSF, HUCBs were collected from 20 umbilical cord. RNA extraction and reverse transcriptase was performed in all samples obtaining identical cDNA concentration (1000ng/ml). The pool of PBSCs-cDNA was used to normalize HUCB and the pool of HUCB was used to normalize PBSCs in different analysis. TaqMan\u00ae Low Density Array based on comparative ddCT method was employed to estimate relative quantifi cation of 48 genes that are known to be associated with stemness functions. The list included key human Stem Cells (SCs) pluripotency genes such as Lefty 2, FG2, TDGF1, POU5F1(OCT4), Nanog and Sox2, thus providing a positive control for the quality of the cells and the data obtained. Results: We were able to identify at least three gene blocks with different expression among the two SCs of different origins (table 1). The fi rst and second blocks included genes with higher and lower expression of mRNA-copies in HUCB than PBSCs, respectively. In the third block the genes were expressed in a similar manner. As expected, the most genes with self-renewal property were all up-expressed in HUCB (CD34, GATA1, GATA2, HOXA5, HOXA9, TGB1, PBX1, M1ES1) together with the pluripotency pattern genes. In addition, as it's noteworthy, the genes involved in homing functions were highly over-expressed in HUCB (CXCR4, IL-8, ICAM-1). Of course, the gene pattern associated with hematopoietic erythroid and myeloid lineage commitment showed interesting increases in adult SCs (LMO2, HOXA10, CUX1). Finally, MAP4K1 LEFTY2 genes involved in TGFB signalling pathway were analogously regulated in either SCs. Conclusion: Comparative analysis of gene expression among various SCs sources showed differential profi le. We believe that stemness transcriptome may be the base for the activation of a molecular program to characterize the effi ciency state of different cell products employed in stem cell based-therapy.",

In this study we characterized the C-compatibility of MSCs as compared to endothelial cells (EC). Studies of C-component C3 cell surface deposition, as well as C3a generation in vitro and in a whole blood system showed increased C-activation for MSCs. In presence of whole blood, FCS cultured MSCs induced elevated activation of Lymphocytes, Monocytes and upregulation of CD11b on PMNs which could be abrogated in the presence of compstatin or C5aR-antagonist. Differential analysis of C-regulatory proteins MCP (CD46), DAF (CD55) and protectin (CD59) as well as antibody binding to cells identifi ed the lack of MCP and DAF in MSCs, whereas IgG-and IgM-binding was comparable to ECs. MSCs showed classical and alternative pathway activation, but were protected from Clysis via CD59. C-activation could be reduced to the level of ECs when cells where cultured in human AB-serum or early passage clinical MSCs were tested and completely abrogated by C-antagonists.

We compared the characteristics of freshly isolated and of in vitro expanded cells derived from bone marrow (BM) buffy coat (BC), BM fat and adipose tissue (AT). Methods: BM aspirates were obtained from 7 BM donors and 5 patients who underwent stem cell infusion for the treatment of osteopeneic disorders. AT was isolated from 3 patients undergoing reconstructive plastic surgery. All procedures were approved by the local Ethics Committee. After the centrifugation of BM samples, a layer of nucleated cells (BC) at interphase between the plasma and red cells pellet was collected. Cells from BM fat or AT were isolated by collagenase digestion. CFU-F determination, MSC in vitro expansion, fl ow cytometric characterization, differentiation potential and immunomodulatory properties were evaluated as previously described (Urbani et al., Cytotherapy 2006; Mazzanti et al., J. Neuroimmunol 2008) . Results: Highest frequency of CFU-F/106 TNC was observed for AT-, followed by BM fat-derived SC (803.3 \u00b1753.0 and 652.4 \u00b1516.1 respectively). In addition, BM fat had a 17.1 fold increase in the mean number of CFU-F/106 TNC in comparison with BM BC of the same donor. Flow cytometric analysis of freshly isolated cells from AT showed a high percentage of CD34 (61.5%), CD90 (61.3%) and CD271 (19.4%) positive cells. CD45lowLNGFR+ stromal progenitor cells frequency in AT (20.3%) and BM fat (2.9%) is higher than BM BC (0.04%). BM BC and fat derived CD45low-LNGFR+ cells showed a high expression of the MSC markers CD90, CD73 and CD105; however only AT-derived population expressed the CD34+ haemopoietic marker. Proliferative potential of AT derived MSC was lower in comparison to BM BC and BM Fat derived MSC. MLR experiments indicated a higher suppression of lymphocyte proliferation by AT-derived MSC. Conclusions: Results from our study demonstrated that stem cells isolated from AT and BM showed different ex vivo and in vitro properties in terms of phenotype, proliferation and immunomodulation properties. These fi ndings are relevant for the selection of stem cell source and are a critical issue for clinical applications.",

Mendes, R.B. Ferreira, C.P. Vaz, A. Campos, A. Carvalhais Instituto Portugu\u00eas de Oncologia (Porto, PT) For both healthy donors and patients, peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ cell count is the parameter currently used to monitor G-CSF mobilization and to predict the yield of harvested peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). Recently, last generation haematology analyzers with \u00abimmature information\u00bb (IMI) channels came up as an alternative method to count haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), with several studies showing a correlation between CD34+ cells and HPC. The aim of this ongoing study is to compare which of the two parameters (CD34+ cells or HPC) better predicts the success of the collection. We retrospectively analysed PBPC grafts from 81 healthy donors and 103 patients with haematological malignancies (MM n=49, NHL n=37 and HD n=17), who underwent G-CSF mobilization between January 2007 and October 2008. On the 5th day of mobilization, PB samples were collected from all individuals for WBC and HPC counts in the Sysmex XE-2100 analyzer and CD34+ cell enumeration by fl ow cytometry. All individuals started apheresis and PBPC counts were also performed using the same parameters as for PB. Results are shown as median and quartile (Q) ranges. Median number of CD34+ cells and HPC obtained/\u00b5L in the PB of patients were 16 and 71 respectively and for donors values were 65 and 130 cells/\u00b5L. Most donors were good mobilizers, collecting >4x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg of recipient body weight (bw). For patients a successful collection was defi ned as >2.5x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg bw collected in up to 4 apheresis performed in consecutive days. Patients' PB results and the predictive value for the total of CD34+ cells collected are summarised in Table 1 . None of the patients with CD34+ cells below 8 (n=23) (1st Q) had an efficient mobilization, whereas 37% of patients with CD34+ cells within the 2nd Q had a successful collection. For patients with PB CD34+ cells values above median, collection was successful in 78% of cases for the 3rd Q and 100% for the 4th Q. For HPC counts there was no defi ned pattern of success, as we observed in all Q collections above the defi ned PBPC target. Even though we found a correlation between PB CD34+ cells and HPC and the total of collected cells/kg patient bw, PB CD34+ cells are a better predictor of PBPC harvests' success than HPC.",

            "text": "Objectives: MSCs are multipotent cells with many potential clinical applications. However, the lack of a precise defi nition of the cells preparation and the heterogeneity of the obtained product render validation criteria of the fi nal product of the expansion. During the culturing procedures immunophenotype changes can arise which can lead to long term consequences of complications of MSC transplantation. Aims: to estimate immunophenotype of MSC from healthy donors on early (2-4) and late (10-12) passages. Methods: MSC (n=25) were prepared by seeding bone marrow MNC in 75 cm\u00b2 culture fl asks in low glucose DMEM with 20% FCS. After 72 hours the non-adherent cells were discarded and cells were passed every 7 days by trypsinization and replanting S163 at the density of 0.5x10 6 cells/75 cm\u00b2 fl ask until the end of the culture. The immunophenotype of MSC (CD3, CD13, CD14,  CD19, CD25, CD29, CD31, CD34, CD38, CD44, CD45, CD73,  CD90 , CD105, CD106, CD166 \u00e8 HLA-DR) was analyzed by fl ow cytometry. Results: We found that in vitro expanded bone marrow MSC demonstrate higher proliferative activity on 2-4 in comparison with 10-12 passages (5,9-fold increase and 2,0-fold accordingly, p=0.049). On the 4-th passage the cells were high positive (median >90%) for CD90, CD105, CD73, CD166, CD44, median positive (median 30-90%) for CD13 \u00e8 CD29 and negative (median < 5%) for CD45, CD34, CD133, CD3, CD19, CD25, CD38, CD45, CD106, CD31. We found that after 10-12-th passages the expression of CD90 and CD166 on MSC became lower in comparison with MSC of 2-4 passages (p=0.049 and p=0.05 accordingly). We have not seen the increasing of CD133+ cells after 10-12-th passages of MSC. After 10-12-th passages in despite of the decreasing of the numbers of CD90+ and \u00d1D31+ cells, the intensity of the expression of these antigens increases. Conclusions: Our results showed, that linear homogeneity of MSCs on 3-4 passages is stabile then cells are cultured up to 10-12 passages. For cell therapy with MSC is necessary to use well tested, homogeneity cells population with known immunophenotype. Further research is required concerning different passaging techniques and culture conditions to better understand their effects on MSC's immunology characteristics.",

Following stem cell transplantation (SCT), whilst haemopoietic cells are replaced, MSC remain of recipient origin. However, MSC have previously been shown to be damaged by chemotherapeutic treatment, which is administered prior to SCT. Therefore, if damage is severe it may contribute to lack of engraftment in some transplants, one of the leading causes of mortality in this setting. To elucidate this damage, a physiologically relevant model is needed, particularly to allow study of prodrugs where cytochrome P450 enzymes are necessary for metabolism. A co-culture model utilising HepG2 liver spheroids and MSC has been developed to enable study of chemotherapeutic damage, currently focussing on cyclophosphamide (CY) which requires metabolism to the main cytotoxic agent phosphoramide mustard. This co-culture model has been evaluated by comparing results observed in haematological malignancy patients who have received prior chemotherapeutic treatment in vivo. Following chemotherapeutic treatment MSC morphology is less uniform, proliferative capacity reduced (p<0.01) and an altered adhesion molecule expression (e.g. CD44) can be demonstrated.",

The initial results raised concerns over the toxicity of S9 itself, particularly over extended periods in culture (e.g. 48 hours), demonstrating the need for a more physiologically relevant model. MSC were co-cultured with either S9 or HepG2 spheroids and exposed to 0.5mM CY for 3hrs or 48hrs. Following 48hr exposure, expansion of MSC was greatly reduced in the presence of both S9 (p<0.01) and HepG2 spheroids (p=0.051). However, following 3hr treatment, subsequent expansion of MSC exposed to CY in the presence of S9 was no different to untreated MSC, whereas expansion of those exposed in the presence of liver spheroids was signifi cantly reduced (p<0.01) and resembled that seen in patients treated with in vivo chemotherapy. It is concluded that co-culture with liver spheroids can enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of CY in vitro and provide a physiologically relevant model to study chemotherapeutic damage. (2), H.W.

(Suwon, KR); (2) Ajou University Hospital (Suwon, KR) Background: On performing umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation, faster engraftment may lead better clinical outcome. Because transplanted viable cell count in UCB is related to the engraftment, we examined cryopreserved UCB cells with several methods after thawing. Methods: Viability of cryopreserved cells were examined with trypan blue, DNA contents analysis, caspase-3 activation test, intracellular esterase activity and Annexin-V/PI staining. Results: A total of 60 samples were used in this study. After thawing, 89% of the total MNCs and 84% of CD34+ cells were viable as identifi ed by trypan blue exclusion assay. In the CD34+ cell population, the cell death rate was found to be 47% by Annexin-V/PI staining and less than 5% by DNA contents analysis. Caspase-3 activity failed to document apoptosis. The intracellular esterase activity test also showed a cell death rate of about 10 -20% at 2, 4, and 6 hours after thawing. Conclusion: Viable cells in UCB should be measured by several compensatory techniques rather than a single method. Discordance among Annexin-V/PI staining versus trypan blue exclusion, DNA contents analysis, and the caspase-3 activation test or intracellular esterase activity should be clarifi ed in order to apply these techniques for actual cord blood transplantation. Introduction: The human cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP 1B1) is a key enzyme involved in the production of reactive metabolites and in the activation of environmental carcinogens. Several polymorphisms were identifi ed in CYP 1B1 gene. The CYP 1B1 codon 432 polymorphism leads to a three-fold higher 4-hydroxylase activity for the variant CYP 1B1 isozymes than the wild types. Never before the infl uence of genetic polymorphisms of CYP 1B1 on patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), was evaluated. Methods: Here we genotyped in a retrospective study 384 recipients (R) (and their donors (D)) for CYP 1B1 expression that underwent allogeneic HSCT for various diseases and analyzed their outcome. Genotyping of CYP 1B1 (C432G) was performed by real-time PCR. Results: 170 R (44.3%) were genotyped as homozygous wildtype gene C/C, 157 R (40.9%) was genotyped as heterozygous genotype C/G and 57 R (14.8%) were genotype as homozygous gene mutation G/G. From the 167 D (43.5%) were C/C, 164 D (42.7%) were C/G, and 53 D (13.8%) had a homozygous gene mutation G/G. A homozygous CYP 1B1 gene mutation G/G was found on 18 R/D side (4.7%). Five-year estimate for treatmentrelated mortality (TRM) and overall survival (OS) were different in genotype C/G-and G/G-R with 33 + 4%, and 49 + 4% compared to homozygous wild-type gene C/C-R (23 + 4%, and 59 + 4%, respectively, [p<0.03]), whereas the fi ve-year estimate for relapse rate (RR) was not different between the groups. No differences for fi ve-year estimates for TRM, RR, or OS were seen in R with either genotype C/C-, C/G-or G/G-D. No statistic differences were found in the incidence of acute GVHD grade \u2265 2-4 or chronic GVHD on R-or on D-side with variant CYP 1B1 polymorphisms. Surprisingly, the fi ve-year estimate for TRM, RR, and OS were different in homozygous gene mutation G/G on R/D site with 57 + 16%, 78 + 17%, and 16 + 10% compared to all other CYP 1B1 genotypes with 28 + 3%, 32 + 3%, and 55 + 3%, respectively [TRM, p<0.01; RR, p<0.003 and OS, p<0.001]). Multivariate analysis confi rmed that CYP 1B1 homozygous gene mutation G/G on R/D site had an increased risk for TRM and RR (p<0.02), whereas the mutation G/G on R/D site revealed a worse OS (p<0.01). Conclusions: These results suggest that recipients with genetic polymorphism of CYP 1B1 do have an increased TRM, RR and lower OS after transplantation. Genotyping for CYP 1B1 (C432G) might help to identify patients with higher risk for HSCT.",

Apperley, N. Salooja Hammersmith Hospital (London, UK) Infertility is common following SCT for leukaemia. Very little data is available on the use and success of artifi cial reproductive techniques in patients who have received chemoradiotherapy as treatment for cancer. We have performed a retrospective survey to assess the uptake of gamete/embryo storage prior to SCT, their use following SCT and the success rate of these techniques. 63 patients (28 female) responded to a questionnaire a median of 16 years (range 2-26) post transplant. All had received total body irradiation at a median dose of 13.2 Gy (range 10-14.4) together with cyclophosphamide 120mg/kg . The median age at transplant was 34 years (range 19-58). The possibility of infertility was discussed with 44/63 patients (28M,16 F) prior to SCT. Of 28 male patients with whom infertility was discussed, all were offered sperm storage. 15 declined because they had completed their family (n=12) or because there was insuffi cient time to organise sperm storage prior to transplant (n=3). Of 13 patients who attempted to store sperm, 5 provided samples of insuffi cient quality for storage. Of 8 patients with stored sperm, one decided not to attempt parenthood after he relapsed from his original disease. The remaining 7 patients used their stored sperm to attempt pregnancy. Six out of seven patients were successful in fathering children; in three cases intracytoplasmic sperm injections were used. The median number of attempts was 2 (range 1-10) and the median duration of storage prior to successful use was 9 years (range 2-11y). Of 16 women with whom infertility was discussed, embryo storage was arranged for one; this patient had received hydroxycarbamide prior to egg collection. A fi rst pregnancy using frozen embryos miscarried at 9 weeks but a second pregnancy was succesful. A second patient had embryos stored prior to her diagnosis of CML and had already had a successful pregnancy using IVF. Following transplant, however, a single attempt at IVF failed. Reasons for failure to discuss infertility with these women or to offer embryo storage were not always clear but in the majority of patients were likely to have been related to an age greater than 40 at the time of transplant or else lack of availability of embryo storage in patients transplanted prior to 1990.",

Lee (1) Objectives: We conducted this study to describe recent characteristics of incidence, risk factors, and outcome of venoocclusive disease (VOD) in children undergoing autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: Four hundred sixty-seven HSCTs (217 autologous and 250 allogeneic) performed in 374 patients from January 2005 to December 2007 were evaluated. VOD was defi ned according to McDonald criteria and classifi ed as severe on the basis of persistent symptoms after day 100 or death before day 100 with ongoing VOD. Results: Among 467 transplants, VOD developed in 72 transplants (15.4%) at median 10 days (1-64) after HSCT. VOD was graded as mild or moderate in 62 and severe in 10 transplants. For VOD prophylaxis, heparin was used in 116 transplants, heparin + prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) in 230 transplants, PGE1 \u00b1 ursodeoxycholic acid in 86 transplants, and defi brotide + heparin or PGE1 in 35 transplants. The median duration of VOD was 12 days (3-80). Hepatomegaly was the most common sign of VOD (87.5%). Ascites, respiratory dysfunction, and renal dysfunction were more common in severe VOD compared to mild or moderate VOD. Multivariate analysis showed that total body irradiation (TBI) or busulfan containing regimen (P=0.002), VOD prophylaxis without PGE1 (P=0.010), number of previous HSCT (P=0.012), and pre-transplant serum ferritin (P=0.014) were independent risk factors for developing VOD. Mean serum ferritin level was higher in HSCT with VOD (2109.6 \u00b1 2842.5) than in HSCT without VOD (1315.9 \u00b1 1094.4) (P<0.001). Deaths within 100 days after HSCT occurred in 13 of 72 VOD-positive transplants, the cause of death being VODrelated multi-organ failure in 5 cases. The risk of death within 100 days after HSCT was 2.8 times higher (95% CI: 1.718, 4.563) for VOD-positive transplants (P<0.001). Conclusion: TBI or busulfan-based conditioning regimen, VODprophylaxis without PGE1, repeated HSCT, and pre-transplant ferritin increased signifi cantly the incidence of VOD in children after HSCT. The encouraging result of our study is to justify the role of PGE1 in the prophylaxis of VOD, however prospective randomized trials are needed to confi rm the superior effi cacy of PGE1 in preventing VOD. Despite the combination of supportive cares and VOD therapy, signifi cant numbers of patients are still suffering from VOD. Continued research for prevention and effective treatment of VOD will be necessary to improve the outcome of HSCT. We analyzed the association of the occurrence of autoantibodies or autoimmune diseases with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) and survival in allogeneic stem cell recipients. From Nov. 2001 to Mar. 2008 , 121 patients with hematological diseases who survived at least 3 months after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) were enrolled in the current study. Forty-seven patients (38.8%) expressed at least one of various autoantibodies after transplantation. ANA was positive in 22 patients (18.2%), anti-dsDNA in 7 patients (5.8%), anti-smooth muscle (Sm) antibody in 6 patients (5%), rheumatoid factor (RF) in 17 patients (14.0%), and a positive Coombs test recorded for 12 patients (9.9%). Autoimmune disease-like manifestations were observed as follows; 2 membranous glomerulonephritis, 8 AIHAs and 1 ITP, 2 sclerodermas including 1 with esophageal involvement, 2 lichen planus-like skin features, and 2 vitiligos. The positive rate of autoantibodies was higher in the patients with cGVHD (47.8% vs. 27.8%; p=0.025). The expression of autoantibodies had a statistical correlation to the specifi c organ involvement of cGVHD; ANA to sicca syndrome (p=0.010), anti-Sm antibody to hepatic GVHD (p=0.003), and RF to sicca syndrome (p=0.039) and musculoskeletal GVHD (p=0.026). The patients expressing autoantibody had a better survival than those without autoantibody expression. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 70.2% and 47.9% in autoantibody positive and negative patients, respectively (p=0.002). Especially, the patients expressing autoantibody without cGVHD had a better survival (OS = 100%) than other groups. The 5-year OS rate were 63.1% in both autoantibody and cGVHD positive group, 59.6% in autoantibody negative and cGVHD positive group, and 36.6% in both autoantibody and cGVHD negative group. Limited cGVHD (p=0.025, HR=0.353) and autoantibody expression (p=0.007, HR=0.371) were identifi ed as a good prognostic factors affecting survival. In conclusion, the occurrence of autoantibodies after allogeneic SCT was found to be related to cGVHD, and patients expressing autoantibodies had a better survival. (1), F. Naveed (1) , N.J.

Geddes (2) Busulphan (Bu) is a bifunctional alkylating agent used in conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplants. As previously seen from oral Bu data early dose adjustments are key in preventing toxicity due to overdosing. We report on 166 patients with hematological malignancies who were given a once-daily intravenous (i.v.) Bu (3.2mg/kg days -5 to -2) and fl udarabine (Flu, 50mg/m 2 days -6 to -2) regimen. Using this regimen we have shown that non-relapse mortality is increased by exposure to an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for Bu of >6000uM*min. By giving a small test dose (0.8mg/kg day -7) during the myeloablative prophylaxis, we were able to adjust patient doses by day -5 (fi rst Bu dose). Bu levels were measured in plasma using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and quantifi ed by the AUC in uM*min. The pharmacokinetic (PK) data were modeled and analyzed by non-compartmental and compartmental analysis using Win-Nonlin 5.0.1 software (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). Bu PK are dependant on the rate of infusion, which should remain constant during and between doses. We chose an infusion rate of 80mg/hr (160cc/hr) and rely on the fact that clearance of the test and treatment dose should be equal in order to predict a therapeutic dose. Eleven patients required a dose reduction (the test dose predicted >6000uM*min) where an AUC of 5000uM*min was targeted to allow a safe margin of error. Within those patients 82% of the adjustments were within 15% of the error margin for the targeted AUC. A mean reduction of 22% of the originally prescribed dose was observed. We found 91% of the 166 patients to be within 15% of the predicted therapeutic dose as determined from the test dose analysis. Furthermore, 83% of the 166 patients fell within a safe AUC window of 3000 to 5000uM*min. Since our move to therapeutic drug monitoring by test-dose PK analysis, none of our patients have been exposed to AUC > 6000uM*min. These data confi rm the value of an individual dose monitoring regimen by test-dose PK analysis.",

Rovira, C. Mart\u00ednez, F. Fern\u00e1ndez-Avil\u00e9s, E. Carreras Hospital Cl\u00ednic (Barcelona, ES) Introduction: Since the classical series of Seattle, Baltimore, Huddinge, IBMTR and EBMT establishing the frequency and risk factors for VOD in allogeneic HSCT many changes have been introduced in this therapeutic procedure. At that time, peripheral blood stem cells, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), unrelated donors, cord blood, mycophenolate mofetil and defi brotide were not routinely used. For that reason we analyzed the evolution of VOD in the last 24 years in a single centre. Patients and Methods: Between 01/1987 and 07/2008, 845 allo-HSCT were performed. Primary diseases were AML or ALL (n=363), CML (n=238), MDS (n=55), or NHL/HL/MM (n= 149). Their median age was 36 years (range, 4-67). Alternative donors were used in 197 cases (23%). 121 patients had received a previous auto-(n= 69) or allo-HSCT (n=52). RIC was used in 135 cases (16%). The Seattle and Baltimore clinical criteria were used for VOD diagnosis. Severity of VOD was classifi ed according with the retrospective Seattle criteria and by the presence of multi-organ failure (MOF). Since 2000 all VOD cases were treated with defi brotide. Results: Applying the Seattle and Baltimore criteria 117 (14%) and 73 (9%) patients developed VOD, respectively. VOD was mild, moderate or severe in 37 (32%), 53 (45%) and 25 (21%) cases. Twenty-six (22%) patients developed MOF and 20 died of VOD (67% of severe VOD, 17% of VOD, and 2% of the whole series). Twenty-seven additional patients with VOD (23%) died before day +100 due to other causes. To analyze the incidence of VOD along the years we only considered cases fulfi lling the more strict Baltimore criteria. Considering the whole series the incidence of VOD in last decade seemed to be lower. Of note, when excluding RIC HSCT it was very similar in both periods, except for HSCT from alternative donors that showed a notable reduction in VOD incidence. However, multivariate analysis disclosed that in addition to well known risk factors (previous liver disease, low Karnofsky index, myeloablative conditioning, alternative donors) time of HSCT had a clear impact on VOD, with a signifi cant lower risk in the last decade. Conclusions: The incidence of VOD has decreased along the years probably as a consequence of a better management of patients. However, the most remarkable fi nding in our historical analysis has been the notable reduction in the cases of VOD that evolve to MOF or die, probably due to the better management of VOD cases and the use of defi brotide. Introduction: the evaluation of health-related quality of life represents an important instrument of outcome in transplanted patients especially in those who received HSCT during paediatric age. The aim of this study is to evaluate the subjective cognitive development, self physical function and satisfaction profi le in a group of adolescents (age >18 yrs) transplanted during childhood. Material and Methods: 32 survivors (18 males, median age 25 yrs, range 18-33) at a median of 15 yrs (range 10-20) from HSCT performed at a median age of 9 yrs (range 0-16 yrs) responded to questionnaires on Cognitive Behaviour Assessment (CBA, evaluating global personality), Self Physical Function (SF-36), and Satisfaction Profi le(SAT-P). The source of HSCT was autologous in 19 pts. The conditioning regimen included TBI or TAI in 21 pts. Late effects included sub-capsular opacity (n=13), hypogonadism (n=23), hypothyroidism (n=7), thyroidal nodules (n=13), secondary solid tumours (n=10), skeletal problems (n=13), restrictive respiratory insuffi ciency (mild and severe in 16 and 1, respectively), C hepatitis (n=5), cavernomatous angiodysplasia (n=7), and metabolic syndrome (n=6). Karnosky scores ranged from 70 to 100 (median 90). Results: All subjects resulted within the normal range according to the questionnaires control values. Females resulted more sensible to pain (P=0.004), and more impaired in their social activities (P=0.04), emotional status (P=0.04) and instability (P=0.007) compared with males. Patients transplanted at age > 5 yrs resulted more compromised in their work activity (P=0.02). As for conditioning regimen, patients irradiated with TBI o TAI had a major impairment of physical activity (P=0.02). The relationship between subjective perception of quality of life and late effects demonstrated a correlation between hypogonadism and social activity (P=0.03), emotional status(P=0.01) and mental health (P=0.01). Patients with skeletal problems seem to have a higher perception of physical pain (P=0.007) and vitality (P=0.01). Conclusion: in our experience the subjective perception of satisfaction profi le and quality of life of a restrict group of adults receiving HSCT in childhood is within the normal range. Female gender, and hypogonadism represent the variables that affected more on subjective perception of quality of life. Introduction: Over the past decade, the number of transplants in children increased considerably. In our BMT unit this occurred mainly because of the inclusion of pts with genetic diseases and the possibility of fi nding donors with appropriate compatibil-ity in international banks. Long-term survival is important in this group of pts because they could have a long life expectancy if they were not affected by the disease. Objectives: Analyze the long-term survival and causes of late mortality in children and adolescents submitted to an allogeneic HSCT in a single institution. Materials and Methods: The information about survival and causes of death of 507 pts aged below 18 years was retrieved from our database. 201 (39%) pts survived more than 5 years and were included in this analysis. Gender: M/F: 126/75. Median age at HSCT: 9ys (range: 1-17ys). Median follow-up after HSCT: 9ys (range: 5-22ys). Most pts received bone marrow (93%) from their related donors (90%). 54 pts had malignant disease while 147 had non-malignant diseases (51 genetic diseases). The 5 year-mortality in this cohort of pts was compared to the mortality observed in normal population (based on data published by IBGE in 1991). We used the Kaplan-Meyer estimator and standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for statistical analysis. Results: Survival of children undergoing HSCT was worse than the general population and remained in that way even for children surviving 5ys or more after HSCT. The SMR (95% CI) of the children who survived at least 5 years post-HSCT was 5.437 (1.977-8.896 ). The death of rejection or relapse (table) occurred in 3pts (all before the 10 years post-HSCT). All deaths after 10 years of HSCT occurred in children with genetic diseases (Cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C in one pt with Fanconi\u00b4s Anemia and progressive pulmonary fi brosis in one pt with Dyskeratosis Congenita). Two pts with Fanconi's Anemia developed secondary tumors and died of progressive disease. Conclusion: Compared to the normal population, children undergoing an allogeneic HSCT had an increased chance of dying from any cause even after 5ys of transplantation. In our country, these pts go back to their home town and may not have adequate access to health care. Brazil is a huge country and despite our limited resources we are developing a national program to educate our pts and primary care physicians about the importance of maintaining a lifelong surveillance after HSCT.",

            "text": "Late-onset neutropenia in 53 patients treated with radioimmunotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma V. Pavone (1) (2) Background: Late onset neutropenia (LON) following chemoimmunotherapy have been reported in 10-50% of patients (pts). It appears from 1 to 6 months after the end of chemotherapy S167 (CHT) and it is severe (<0.5-1 x10 9 /L) but spontaneously reversible. Recent studies suggests that LON is due to perturbations of Stromal-derived Factor 1 (SDF-1) and coincides with the time of maximum B-cell depletion in periferal blood (PB) according with the hypothesis that LON is due to a promotion of B-cell lymphopoiesis over granulopoiesis in the bone marrow (1) (2) . Aims: Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are the most common hematological toxicities in NHL pts treated with RIT (Zevalin\u00ae). The median days to nadir of the neutropenia and thrombocytopenia is around day +60 after Zevalin\u00ae treatment without stem cell rescue, but poor information exists about late hematological toxicity in pts treated with RIT plus high dose CHT and ASCT (Z-BEAM). METHODS: We evaluated LON in 53 high risk NHL pts, all pretreated with Z-BEAM and ASCT in 14 italian centers from February 06 to June 2008. In 13 pts the immunological recovery was evaluated monthly. Results: All pts engrafted. Median CD 34+ cells infused was 5.5 x10 6 /Kg (range 2.55-34). Median time to ANC &\u2265 0,500 x10 9 /L was 10 days (range 8-20), median time to platelets (plt) \u2265 20 x109/L was 14 days (range 9-60). Median follow up was 247 days (range 125-818). 39/53 pts with > 6 months follow up were evaluated for LON (fi g.1). 6/39 (15,3%) pts experienced grade 3-4 neutropenia. Median time of onset was day + 87 (range 30-147). Median duration of neutropenia was 29 days (range 3-87). 3 CMV reactivation, 3 urine infection, 2 blood colture + for bacteria and 1 pneumonia was demonstrated during neutropenia (tab.1). In 6 pts with LON, a median CD 19 counts of 15 cells/mmc (range 0-40) was documented. In the control history group treated with BEAM +ASCT in the same period a CD 19 count of 100 cells/mmc (range 10-300) was documented, in agreement whit the hypothesis that LON coincides with the time of maximum B-cell depletion in PB. Conclusions: In our Institutions 53 pts were treated with Z-BEAM + ASCT for NHL from February 06 to June 08. After engraftment 6/39 (15,3%) pts experienced grade 3-4 neutropenia. The time of emergence of neutropenia seems to be longer (g+87) than in pts treated with Zevalin alone and coincides with the time of maximum B-cell depletion in PB as demonstrated by PB immunophenotipe. (1), C. Aitken (2) (1)Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre (Glasgow, UK); (2) Depy. Virology (Glasgow, UK) EBV-driven post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a well recognised complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Risk of developing early PTLD is associated with reactivation of EBV which can be detected by rising EBV copy numbers. Patients in our unit are screened weekly using plasma TaqMan realtime PCR, increasing to twice weekly if a positive result is found. Those with suggestive clinical features, rising copy number by >1 log in a week or an absolute value >5 log have a CT scan and biopsy if possible. Patients are given preemptive rituximab 375mg/m\u00b2 if EBV copy number reaches >log 6 or clinical features with rising copy number are found. Patients with new lymphadenopathy and rising EBV copy number are treated with rituximab 375mg/m\u00b2. A retrospective case note review of all allografts in our unit was carried out between 1/6/04 and 31/7/08 to identify patients who had been treated with rituximab pre-emptively or for suspected PTLD. There were 165 fi rst allografts during this period; 64 sibling, 100 VUD, 1 Cord. A total of 11 patients (6%) received rituximab, 5 for biopsy-proven PTLD, 6 were treated pre-emptively for rising EBV titres and clinical features only. Treatment was initiated at a median EBV copy number of log 5.2 copies (range 3.2 to 6.91). The number of treatments ranged from 1 to 5, with a median of 2. Four of the eleven patients (36%) treated for PTLD have died, two (18%) from PTLD and two from underlying disease relapse. The remaining 7 patients (64%) remain alive and well. On analysing possible risk factors we have identifi ed that VUD recipients 9/100 (9%) had a higher incidence than sibling transplants 2/64 (3%). In our unit in vivo T depletion with Alemtuzumab 100mg is used in all reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens, and in myeloablative (MA) regimens for VUD recipients and sibling HLA mismatches. No sibling conditioned with a MA regimen (29/64) developed PTLD. Recipients of a RIC fl udarabine based regimen had an incidence of 11% (10/89) compared to 2% (1/44) for an Alemtuzumab MA regimen for VUD recipients. The dose of alemtuzumab was identical in both RIC and MA regimens suggesting that the addition of fl udarabine increases the chance of EBV reactivation and development of PTLD. However, the use of PCR monitoring and preemptive therapy with rituximab has been a successful strategy in our patients, even when biopsy positive.",

Sauer Mediacl School Hannover (Hannover, DE) Background: This study aimed to identify factors infl uencing the duration of isolated red cell transfusion dependency after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 487 patients transplanted at Hannover Medical University between 2000 and 2006. Patients were identifi ed by their requirements of red cell transfusions beyond day 60 after SCT. Median follow-up was 51 months (range 18 -96 months). Median patient age was 37 years (range 0 -70 years). Stem cell source were peripheral blood stem cells (n = 344, 71%), bone marrow (n = 138, 28%), S168 and cord blood (n = 5, 1%). 57% (n = 278) had an unrelated donor including 59 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched transplantations. 43% (n = 209) had family donors out of which 17 were mismatched. Factors analyzed were age, underlying disease (malignant versus non malignant), transfusions pre SCT, time between diagnosis and SCT, conditioning regimen (full versus reduced intensity), donor type, graft source, T cell depletion, mixed chimerism, and graft versus host disease. Results: 47 patients (9.6%) showed a prolonged isolated red cell transfusion dependency. Multivariate analysis identifi ed ABO-incompatibility between donor and recipient as major risk factor (incidence of 16.4% for major mismatch, 2.9% for minor mismatch, and 9.1% for AB0-compatible transplantations (p = 0.002)). Independently of ABO-incompatibility reduced intensity conditioning regimens (RIC) were associated with prolonged red cell transfusion dependency (15.2% versus 7%; p = 0.005). Although inseparably linked to RIC, patient age was associated with prolonged red cell transfusion dependency in univariate analysis (18.3% > 55 years, 10.2% from 13 to 54 years, and 2.0% < 12 years (p = 0.001)). The remaining parameters were not associated with prolonged red cell transfusion dependency in our series. Interestingly, overall survival was not affected. Conclusions: Major AB0-incompatibility is a major factor for isolated prolonged red cell dependency after SCT. The increasing use of RIC in younger patients will show whether RIC and older age can be identifi ed as independent risk factors as patient numbers grow.",

Although the development of diagnostics and antiviral therapies improved prognosis, the consequence of encephalitis is still unclear. The purpose of this study is to clarify neuropsychological disorders in survivors with HHV-6 encephalitis. Patients and Methods: Patients receiving allogeneic SCT between January 2004 and March 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients who developed unexplained neuropsychological disorders with a positive reaction of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HHV-6 in the cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) were diagnosed with HHV-6 encephalitis. Results: Among165 recipients, eight (4.8%) were diagnosed as HHV-6 encephalitis. Five were male and three were female with a median age of 40.5 years (range, 22-56). Underlying diseases included 3 AML and 5 ALL, and 6 were in a state of remission at SCT. All of them received stem cells from unrelated donors (4 cord blood and 4 bone marrow). Myeloablative conditioning regime was carried out on all but one patient. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was attempted with tacrolimus in all patients. The median onset of HHV-6 encephalitis was day +18 (range, day +14 to +27) after SCT. The median number of HHV-6 DNA copies in CSF at the onset of encephalitis was 84,400 copies/ml (range, 590 to 930,000). Four patients were treated with ganciclovir and the others were treated with foscarnet. The median period of the antiviral therapy was 41days (range, 16 to 77). The examination of PCR for HHV-6 in the CSF was negative in all patients by the end of the antiviral therapy. The median survival from the onset of encephalitis was 360 days (range, 82 to 1636), and three patients died of irrelevant causes of encephalitis (sepsis on day 89, pneumonia on day 139 and gastro-intestinal tract bleeding with chronic GVHD on day 327 after SCT). Four patients in survivors were prohib-ited from returning to society because of neuropsychological disorders including anterograde amnesia and seizure. Conclusions: Although HHV-6 encephalitis after SCT is becoming a curable complication, the aftereffect of encephalitis such as neuropsychological disorders has infl uence on quality-of-life in long-term survivors.",

Miyamura Japanese Red Cross Nagoya 1st. Hospital (Nagoya, JP) Aim: Non-infectious pulmonary complication after SCT is a signifi cant morbidity and mortality, and its diagnosis is sometimes diffi cult. We investigated cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP, synonym of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP)) which is one of the subacute typical SCT pulmonary complications, clinicopathologically by using biopsy material. The characteristic histopathologic lesions of COP are excessive proliferations of granulation tissue within small airways and alveolar ducts associated with chronic infl ammation by large amount of macrophages infi ltration. The aim of this study was to clarity the origin of macrophages which are the key infl ammatory cells in COP lesions. Cases and methods: We have selected the pulmonary biopsy cases from our SCT data fi les of Department of Pathology, from 1995 to 2008. Fifteen cases of COP by histologically confi rmed from among 41 biopsy (transbronchial biopsy (TBB) 27 cases and surgical lung biopsy 13 cases) were used in this study. Paraffi n sections were examined histological, immunohistological and tissue FISH examination using X, Y gene probes. Results: COP cases were 4-62 y.o (median 33.0), 11 cases of male and 4 of female. Primary diseases were 14 of hematological malignancy and one of aplastic anemia. Stem cells sources were 5 of cord blood and 10 of bone marrow (2 of related and 8 of unrelated donor). Onset of these cases was 35-450 days (median 192.0 days) after SCT. All of them were cured by steroid therapy after histological diagnosis. Histopathologically, COP with some different disease phases were all characterized by CD 163+ alveolar macrophages and small number of CD3+, 8+ T lymphocytes infi ltrations. Seven cases of COP were sexmismatched SCT and 4 of them could work tissue FISH examination. All of 4 cases could be demonstrated donor type sex gene signals in infi ltrated macrophages. Conclusions: We could demonstrate that the donor derived macrophages were dominant infl ammatory cells in COP after SCT cases. COP after SCT is the distinctive disorder in early to late onset complication with favorable prognosis. Increased number of alveolar macrophages donor origin was the clue of pathological diagnosis of COP after SCT.",

Kaloyannidis, D. Mallouri, C. Apostolou, I. Sakellari, E. Yannaki, C. Smias, I. Batsis, S. Tsimperis, R. Saloum, A. Anagnostopoulos, A. Fassas G. Papanicolaou (Thessaloniki, GR) Non-relapse mortality (NRM) following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloTx) remains a signifi cant factor of treatment failure. Recently, the HCT-specifi c comorbidity index (HCT-CI) has been reported to be important predictive marker for NMR. To evaluate the impact of HCT-CI in terms of NRM and overall survival (OS), we retrospectively analyzed 242 patients (pts) aged 4-59 years (median 30), allografted for haematological disease with myeloablative regimens during a 10-year period (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) . One hundred sixty seven pts were transplanted S169 for acute leukaemia (AML: 92, ALL: 75), 26 for myeloproliferative disease, 21 for aggressive NHL, 12 for aplastic anemia, 8 for MDS and 7 for multiple myeloma. At the time of transplant, 132 pts were in complete remission (CR) (70 in CR1) and 110 had relapsed or primary refractory disease. Thirty-six received marrow while 206 peripheral blood grafts harvested from 179 siblings, 52 matched unrelated and 11 relative (2-3 antigen-mismatched) donors. Calcineurin inhibitors plus methotrexate were administered as GvHD prophylaxis. With regard to HCT-CI, 147 pts had score 0, 66 had score 1-2 and 29 had score ? 3. HCT-CI scores were not correlated with patients' age (\u00f72 test: ns). The NRM and the long-term OS were 19% and 60%, respectively, for pts transplanted in CR, compared to 33% and 25% for pts transplanted in advanced disease (p< 0.02). Patients aged <30 and 30-45 years had a similar NRM of 20%, while pts >45 years had a NRM probability of 53% (p=0,002). The NRM rates were 20%, 30% and 35% (p=0.1) while long term OS rates were 45%, 37%, and 36% (p=0.09) for pts with HCT-CI score 0, 1-2 and ? 3 respectively. To evaluate the possible factors which independently affected the NRM and OS, we incorporated in a Cox-regression model patient's age, sex, body mass index and HCT-CI score, disease status and donor's histocompatibility. In our study age <45 years, CR at the time of transplant, and allograft from a sibling donor were identifi ed as signifi cant factors for lower NRM and higher OS rates while a HCT-CI score ?3 exhibited a trend to be signifi cant (p=0.06) indicating that HCT-CI score should possibly be taken into consideration before the decision of a treatment approach.",

With the aim of a better management of LONIPC, from September 2006 we started a cooperation with the Respiratory-Pathophysiology Department of our University and with the Respiratory Rehabilitation Division of S. Raffaele Institute. We analyzed 25 consecutive adult outpatients in follow-up visit at a median time of 35 months post-transplant with a normal lung function before HSCT; 14/25 pts had a ventilatory defect that was obstructive (OD) in 8, restrictive (RD) in 5 and mixed (MD) in 1. They were treated by inhaled formoterol, budesonide and tiotropium bromide for mild/moderate OD (4 pts); as above + oral prednisone (PDN) for severe OD (4 pts); oral PDN + acetylcystein for RD (5pts); oral PDN + inhaled bronchodilators for MD. All patients were trained to the use of the inhalers, 8 received respiratory devices for home pulmonary rehabilitation care. Seven were in treatment for chronic GVHD that remained unmodifi ed. The 2-year cumulative incidence of response to therapy was 76%; 3/14 pts died of LONIPC, with a 15 year overall survival of 35%. The only variable associated with a worse response to therapy was the use of TBI pre-transplant. With the aim of early recognition and treatment of respiratory complications, from Jan. 2007 to Aug. 2008 we analyzed prospectively 11 consecutive pts. Lung function tests were performed pre-transplant and after 3, 6 and 12 months. At a median of 5 months, 6 pts (54%) showed LONIPC. All patients received early therapy according to the protocols reported above and pulmonary physical treatments; 4/6 showed a clinical and spirometric response, one of these underwent a pulmonary rehabilitation program with legs and arms exercises, chest physiotherapy and mucous evacuation. Three/6 pts received treatment for chronic GVHD, unmodifi ed for LONIPC. Conclusions: pulmonary non-infectious complications appear early after transplant, even if with mild clinical or spirometric signs; the cooperation with pneumologists and breathing physiotherapists allows the early recognition of pulmonary complications and specifi c treatments with a good response, avoiding clinical evolution with a better quality of life and reducing the employment of immunosuppressive anti-GVHD therapy.",

Solaz Ankara University Pediatric BMT Unit (Ankara, TR) Prophylactic platelet transfusions reduce the thrombocytopenia related complications in children following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Insuffi cient response to platelet transfusion is common in this period and diagnosis and management of this complication is very challenging. A prospective study was planned to evaluate the frequency and the causes of platelet refractoriness following allo-HSCT since very limited reports have specifi cally addressed this issue in children. The impact of the platelet refractoriness to the bleeding complications, diagnosis and practical options for management were evaluated. Eighty-six pediatric patients who received allo-HSCT for hematological disorders were evaluated. Platelet refractoriness was defi ned as 20-hr CCI<2500 and developed in 44 patients (50%). In case of platelet refractoriness, immune and nonimmune factors were evaluated. Alloimmunization was defi ned as 1-hr CCI<5000 and developed in 30 of 44 children (68%) with platelet refractoriness. The possible nonimmun causes were sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in 3, infection in 4, splenomegaly in 2, drugs in 1, graft vs host disease in 1 and HSCT in 3 patients with platelet refractoriness. Hemoglobinopathy was the diagnosis in 77% of the cases with platelet refractoriness and 23% of patients had other diagnosis requiring transfusions prior to HSCT (P<0.01).Transfusion of whole blood components without leukoreduction before HSCT was found as the most important factor for the development of platelet alloimmunization. Platelets from HLA-matched HSCT donors (n:11) and haploidentical parents (n:9) were transfused to alloimmunized patients and 100% and 55% of them improved platelet responses, respectively. Transplant related mortality rate was 9% and none of the patients died because of bleeding. There was no signifi cant difference in the frequency of hemorrhage between the patients with and without platelet refractoriness (26% vs 23%). Patients with platelet refractoriness required more frequent platelet and red blood cell support (P<0.01). In conclusion, platelet refractoriness associated with alloimmunization is quite high in children undergoing allo-HSCT. Platelet alloimmunization is more frequent among the multitransfused hemoglobinopathy patients. Transfusion from the HSCT donor and/or other relatives could be an option for these patients especially in developing countries where the selection of HLAmatched platelet donors may not be possible. Survival after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in childhood has improved, but many survivors develop late effects after treatment. The burden of late effects has been described in childhood cancer survivors, but only few studies focused on HSCT survivors.",

Patients and methods: Survivors of HSCT in childhood who were alive at least 2 years after HSCT and were seen by a Pediatric hemato-oncologist in our Pediatric Late Effects outpatient clinic, according to national follow-up guidelines for late effects, were eligible for this study. Cumulative incidence and severity of late effects was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 and graded from 0 to 5. Burden of late effects (LE) was defi ned as: mild: LE grade 1 only and < 3 LE, moderate: LE grade 2 and/or 4-6 LE, severe: LE grade 3 and/or > 7 LE and disabling/ life-threatening: any LE grade 4. Risk factors for severe or disabling burden of LE were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: 162 survivors of HSCT were included in this study and had a median age at HSCT of 6.3 years, 63% were male, and the majority underwent HSCT for a hematological malignancy (55%). Half of the patients were treated with a conditioning regimen including either total body or thoraco-abdominal irradiation (TBI/TAI). Fifteen children (9.3%) had chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). Cumulative incidence of late effects was 93.2% (151/162) with a median follow-up time of 7.2 years after HSCT. The burden of late effects was mild, moderate, severe and disabling in 45 (28%), 66 (41%), 38 (24%) and 2 (1%), respectively. Risk factors for a severe or disabling burden of late effects were older age at HSCT (p for trend <0.001) and a conditioning regimen including TBI/TAI (OR 2.2 CI: 1.1-4.7, p=0.03). Sex, diagnosis, donor and stem cell source and cGVHD were not signifi cant risk factors, but for the latter analysis was hampered by low patient numbers. Conclusion: A high burden of late effects is found in childhood HSCT survivors after a median follow-up of only 7 years. Older age at SCT and TBI/TAI are independent risk factors for more severe late effects.",

            "text": "High incidence of secondary malignancies after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation S. Neuburger (1) Introduction: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a curative therapeutical option for patients (pts) with hematological diseases. As result of long term survival, late complications such as secondary malignancies are emerging. Methods: Here we present a retrospective analysis of 589 pts (median age at transplantation 41 years, range 16 -75, male 339, female 250) who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation in our institution between 1995 and 2007 (siblings n= 285, unrelated donors n= 304). Pts suffered from acute leukemia (n=257), chronic myeloproliferative disorders (n=120), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=39), non-hodgkin-lymphomas (n=41) and others (n=132). Pts received conditioning with (n= 436) or without (n=152) 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI). Results: Up to 2007, 283 of 589 pts (48%) died of relapse or transplant related mortality (n=135 relapse, n=84 infection, n= 36 graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD), n=8 organ toxicity, n=20 others or unknown). 305 out of 589 pts (52%) had survived with a median follow-up of 40 months (range 1 -144 months). 21 out of 305 pts (6,9%) developed secondary malignancies at a mean of 5,1 years (range 1-10 years) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Localizations of secondary malignancies were skin (n=11 basalioma, n=2 melanoma), gut (n=2 adenocarcinoma of the small intestine, n=1 coloncarcinoma), oral cavity (n=1 squamous cell cancer) and 3 lymphomas. 17/21 pts (81%) received a myeloablative conditioning with 12 Gy TBI, 4/21 pts (19%) a reduced intensity conditioning. Acute GVHD > grade 2 and chronic GVHD extensive disease appeared in 48% and 67% respectively. Thus, these pts must be treated with prolonged immunosupressive therapy. 2/21 (9,5%) died of secondary malignancies (carcinoma of small intestine and colon) and one pts of accidential infection. Conclusion: Long term surviver of allogeneic stem cell transplantation are at increased risk of a secondary malignancies. Most of the pts received TBI-based conditioning and suffered from chronic GvHD extensive disease with consecutive immunosupressive therapy. Life-long follow-up will be needed to detect secondary malignancies in early stage of disease which might offer curative therapeutical options. Therefore, in our institution all pts undergo annual skin screening program and are sensitized for possibility of secondary malignancies. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only curative approach for many patients with haematological malignancies (HM). Despite this, successful treatment of malignant disease by HSCT frequently depends upon the ability to control transplant related toxicities (TRT). These TRT can be severe and require the admission of patients to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We analyzed outcomes among HSCT patients admitted to the ICU in our center to identify the prognostic factors that could be used to inform the design of clinical trials for these patients. A retrospective analysis was performed of 34 consecutive patients who were admitted to the ICU after HSCT between 2000 and 2007. Data were collected for disease, cause of admission, previous hospitalization, biologic data on admission, during ICU stay and at the time of discharge, SOFA and SAPSII scales scores and critical support care. Survival data during hospitalization, 30 days and 1 year after discharge were also collected. Median age of patients was 38 years. 21 (63.6%) were patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT, 16 of whom had GVHD on admission to the ICU. 12 patients were in relapse after transplant and before admission to the ICU. Median time from HSCT to admission on the ICU was 16.5 months (range . Median stay at the ICU was 6 days (range 1-28). The most frequent cause of admission to the ICU was acute respiratory failure (ARF) (53%): 14 patients (41%) were intubated, 16 patients (47%) needed non invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and 4 patients (11.8%) voluntary denied intubation. The mean SAPSII score on admission was 49 \u00b119 and the maximum SOFA score was 11 \u00b16. Overall survival (OS) during hospitalization, 30 days and 1 year after discharge was 50%, 50% and 37% respectively. No statistically signifi cant differences were observed in OS between allogeneic and autologous transplant patients, and neither was observed when comparing patients with or without GVHD after HSCT. Non relapse mortality was higher in those patients requiring MV and intubation versus those not requiring these measures (85.7% versus 25%). The need of vasoactive drugs was also an adverse prognostic factor for OS. ARF was the main cause of admission to the ICU after HSCT in our cohort and the need of intubation an independent prognostic factor. Larger sample studies are needed to identify prognostic factors for patients admitted to the ICU after HSCT and design scores that could predict outcomes for this group.",

All pts who had less than 24 months-old at time of transplantation and had survived more than one year after this procedure were included in this analysis. We used the World Health Organization classifi cation (WHO, 2006) to assess the nutritional status. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meyer method. Results: 53 infants were transplanted in this period and 33pts survived at last one year, with a median follow up of 2540\u00b11448 days after HSCT. The median age at admission was 13.8\u00b15.9 months and 6.4\u00b13.9 years at the latest evaluation, 73% (22pts) were male, 79% (26pts) had non malignant diseases and 88% (29pts) received a chemotherapy based conditioning. Sixty one percent (20pts) received HSCT from unrelated donors and 33% (11pts) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) after transplant. At the time of admission, 76% (25pts) had short stature (based on the indicator height/age), 27% (9pts) had mild to moderate malnutrition and 18% (6pts) severe malnutrition (based on the indicator weight/age). Regarding the current nutritional status, 58% of patients (19pts) had short stature, 39% (13pts) showed mild to moderate malnutrition and 12% (4pts) had severe malnutrition. Analyzing the height/age curve, 45% (15pts) did not reach an ascendant growth curve after HSCT and 42% (14pts) did not reach an ascendant weight/ age curve. In this small cohort, infants who had GVHD did not develop signifi cant long-term malnutrition. Conclusion: We observed a high prevalence of malnutrition prior to HSCT and many pts persisted with defi cits in height and weight after transplant. We should intervene as early as possible in order to prevent or diminish nutritional long-term complications. In developing countries we urgently need more investments to ensure nutritional support to infants after hospitalization.",

Before the recent introduction of intravenous formula of busulfan, oral busulfan was only available. Previous reports suggested that the use of intravenous formula of busulfan permits stable concentration of busulfan in the plasma, thus reducing regimen-related toxicities, especially veno-occlusive disease (VOD).

The median age of recipients was 35 (range, 16 ?57) years. The diagnoses for HSCT were acute myeloloid leukemia (n=39; 38%), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=36; 35%), myelodysplatic syndrome (n=13; 13%) and others (n=15; 14%).

Rodriguez, I. Bu\u00f1o, Y. Martinez, A. Gomez-Pineda, J.L. Diez-Martin Hosp. Gen. Univ. Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n (Madrid, ES) Several scoring systems have been developed to assess the risk of toxic mortality after stem cell transplantation (SCT). Basu et al (BMT Tandem Meetings, San Diego CA, 13-17 Feb 2008) preliminary reported the usefulness of a simplifi ed scoring system to predict the non-relapse mortality (NRM) at day 100 after SCT. We have checked the usefulness of the Basu scoring system in our patients. Methods: All consecutive transplants performed in our institution between Jun-04 and Jun-08 were selected. Patients with a previous SCT were excluded from the analysis as those alive with a follow-up lower than 100 days. Follow-up was censored at time of last visit or subsequent SCT. Variables included in the scoring system are included in table 1. For the purpose of this analysis the use of CB cells, not included in the original scoring system, was scored as 2. Following the sum of the values given to the scoring variables, each patient was classifi ed within one of the tree risk groups: Low (total score 0-1), Moderate (total score 2) y High (total score >2). NRM was defi ned as death from any cause without a previous disease relapse or progression. Results: 141 patients were selected, of which 112 (52% female, age 44.7 (19-68) years old) were valuables. Diagnosis: Lymphoma (48), AL/MDS (38), MM (14), Other (12). SCT type: Auto (73)/Allo (39), including 6 with non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, 22 from an unrelated donor (59% with cord blood progenitors). Pre-SCT risk: Low (79), Moderate (10), High (23). The global cumulative incidence (CI) of NRM at day +100 was 10% (IC 95%:4.5-15.5). When analyzing according to the pre-SCT risk (Moderate/High vs Low) the relative risk (RR) of NRM at day +100 was 1.4 (IC 95%:1.13-1.77) p<0.001; CI of early NRM was 37% (20-53.5) vs 4% (IC95%: 0.1-8) p<0.001, respectively. Differences in RR and CI of NRM at day +100 between patients with Moderate and High risk were found not statistically signifi cant. Conclusions: In our experience, the simplifi ed scoring system proposed by Basu et al seems to be useful to identify patients with Low vs Moderate-High risk of NRM. This tool could be of help in the decision-making process regarding candidates to SCT.",

Schumacher, L. Notarangelo, C. Forino, D. Demartiis, V. Bennato, V. Grassi, L. Lorenzi, F. Bolda, A. Bosi, S. Berta, R. Baffelli, E. Mazzolari, A. Lanfranchi Oncohaematology and BMT Unit (Brescia, IT) Since 1990 more than 200 stem cell transplants in PID both from MUD/HLA identical or haploidentical donors have been realized. The clinical results have improved thanks to the new stem cell manipulation techniques and to the improved HLA typing techniques. At present the overall survival exceeds 75% in HLA ID/MUD group and 70% in the haplo group. Since haploidentical are realized previous positive selection of CD34 cells, depleting the graft from accessory cells such as stromal or dendritic cells, the assumption was that clinically the patients could have behaved differently as concerns immunological reconstitution. Therefore we analyzed 114 SCID children who received in 70 cases an haploidentical BMT and in 44 a MUD BMT, and 94 children affected by Inborn Errors who received in 79 cases an haploidentical BMT and in 15 a MUD BMT. The result of the analysis pointed out that autoimmunity was present in aggregate only in 17 cases evenly distributed by underlying disease. No major differences were evidenced as concerns incidence on the type of transplant (6 MUD versus 10 haplos). At the same time, if donor-recipient chimerism is analyzed, it is not T-B split chimerism responsible for the disregulated immune reconstitution. Infact in the haplo group only 2 out of 10 children had a mixed T-B chimera, while in MUD the mixed chimera were 2 out of 7. As concerns cell transplanted doses in all cases, CD34 positive cell numbers, T cell infused in MUD were statistically not different in the group of children who reconstitute a normal immune function and in children who present autoimmunity. Out of the 17 cases, 10 presented autoimmune haematolytic anaemia, 4 hypothyroidism and 3 vasculitis. ABO donor-receptor incompatibility is not considered an obstacle for allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) but it can have an impact on the success of this procedure. We analyzed outcomes among ASCT patients in our center to identify the infl uence of ABO incompatibility on engraftment, transfusional requirements (TR) and survival. A retrospective analysis was performed of 151 consecutive patients that underwent ASCT from 1995 to 2007. Data were collected for TR and other clinical and biological values from time of admission for ASCT to last follow up. Hematopoietic stem cell source was peripheral blood in 138 cases (91.4%), bone marrow in 12 (7.9%) and umbilical cord blood in 1 (0.7%). The majority of patients received progenitors from a related donor (89.4% related versus 10.6% non related donors), and in 138 cases the HLA status was identical. 36 patients received a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). 97 were isogroup (64.4%), 29 had a mayor ABO incompatibility (19.2%), 33 (21.9%) a minor and 8 patients (5.3%) bidirectional ABO incompatibility. 8 cases with mayor ABO incompatibility needed pretransplant plasmapheresis due to high antibody titles. Postransplant hemolysis was documented in 10 patients and 1 developed a selective eritroblastic aplasia. Median RBC TR for the group with ABO incompatibility was 7.74 units and for the ABO identical 6.44 units, median platelets TR was 9.11 and 7.45 units for the ABO incompatible and identical group respectively. Median time to neutrophile, platelets and RBC engraftment was 17.3, 15.2 and 34.4 days in the ABO incompatibility group and 15.7, 13,1 and 27.2 days for the ABO indentical group (p=0.016; p=0.029 and p=0.083). The overall survival (OS) of our cohort is 62.9%. Median survival time is 44.3 months in the whole group (range 0.3 to 155.5 months), 39.5 and 47.3 months for the ABO incompatible and ABO identical groups respectively. In the RIC group median time of survival was 20.2 (range 1.3 to 82.5), 15.4 and 24.5 months for those with ABO incomptatibility and ABO identical graft respectively. There is a tendency for higher TR among the group of patients receiving an ABO incompatible graft versus those ABO identical. Neutrophile, platelets and RBC engraftment are faster in the ABO identical group. There are no statistically signifi cant differences in OS regarding the ABO status although there is a favorable tendency for those patients ABO identical, this should be considered when an AHSCT is programmed.",

Falorio, S. Santarone, F. Fioritoni, F. Angrilli Civic Hospital (Pescara, IT) Introduction: Treatment related (TR) ovarian failure causes amenorrhea and infertility in young women affected by Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL), depending on the type and intensity of treatment. Alkylating drugs (particularly cyclophosphamide, iphosphamide, nitrosureas, procarbazine, busulfan, melphalan), especially when used at higher doses as conditioning for stem cell transplantation, are most frequently associated with irreversible gonadic toxicity. Oral contraceptives or gonadotropinreleasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) are generally used with the aim of preventing ovarian damage. Patients and Methods: From 1994 to august 2008, we treated 91 consecutive women with a median age of 26 years (14-40). Patients received fi rst-line polychemotherapy both without alkylating drugs (ABVD or VBM) and with alkylating drugs (BEACOPP or COPPEBVCAD), followed or not by radiotherapy. Refractory/relapsed patients received peripheral blood stem cell autografting (PBSCA) after salvage polychemotherapy. To avoid TR ovarian damage, all patients received monthly Triptorelin 3.75 mg until treatment conclusion. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effi cacy of GnRHa in preventing TR ovarian damage in young women receiving high dose therapy and PBSCA. Results: Today 88 patients are alive and 3 died of HL. Before the treatment, all patients had normal menses. After a minimum of 6 months from the end of the therapy, 79 (90%) patients reported regular menses and 9 (10%) patients became menopausal. The last group consisted of 9 patients with refractory/ relapsed HL who received PBSCA with BEAM conditioning regimen, after salvage treatment with IGEV (iphosphamide, gemcytabine, vinorelbine) polychemotherapy. The cumulative doses of iphosphamide, carmustine and melphalan administered in these patients were 32-48 g/m2, 0,3 g/m\u00b2, 0,14 g/m\u00b2, respectively. Conclusions: In our experience, GnRHa is able to prevent TR ovarian failure in patients receiving a single line of polychemotherapy with or without alkylating drugs. On the contrary, it is ineffective during salvage polychemotherapy followed by PBSCA, because of the administration of high cumulative doses of alkylating drugs. Consequently, patients with refractory/relapsed HL need alternative approaches to prevent TR ovarian failure. In this regard, cryopreservation of ovarian tissue before the treatment followed by its reimplantation after treatment should be one of the most promising modalities.",

Insunza HUMV (Santander, ES) Background: Although Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is an effective therapeutic option for several hematological disorders, there is limited experience on the feasibility and effi cacy of ASCT on elderly patients. Objectives: to analyze toxicity and effi cacy of ASCT in patients >70 years old Design and methods: We analyzed the outcome of 24 patients >70 years old (median, 70 years) treated with ASCT between 1997 and 2007. The baseline pathologies were: 7 AML, 11 lymphomas, 5 myelomas and 1 amyloidosis. 12 patients received at least two treatment lines before ASCT. 12 patients were at fi rst or second complete remission (CR)at the time of transplantation, 2 at >3rd CR, 8 at partial remission and 2 with activated disease. 17 patients had some co-morbidity (cardiac, hepatic, renal, CNS or pulmonary); 9 patients with >1 afected organs. Stem cell precursors were obtained from peripheral blood in 22 patients and from peripheral blood plus bone marrow in 2 patients. The conditioning regimens were BUCY in 7 patients, BEAC/BEAM in 11, and Melphalan \u00b1 Busulphan in 6. 19 patients received Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor after transplantation. Results: Early toxicity: all of patients suffered mucositys (III/IV grade in 10 patients), 10 patients developed cardiac complications, and 5 patients mild encephalopathy. A median of 9 and 11 days were necessary to recovery 100 and 500 granulocytes, and 12 and 15 days to recovery 20000 and 50000 platelets. The median of bed-days were 16 . 23 patients suffered neutropenic fever, and 15 patients suffered later non neutropenic fever. Only 3 patients died 100 days before due to sepsis, and 8 patients died due to relapse of the disease. There was one death in CR at 79th month due to an unknown cause. With a median follow up of 29 months the overall survival was 50%, and the progression free survival was 37%. Conclusions: Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation is feasible in elderly patients, and may be curative in selected elderly patients with hematological diseases. The cardiac complications are the most notable but manageable toxicity. (2,1-9066);1001,8(11,4-26971) for auto and allo, respectively].Patients with grade 3 and 4 mucositis had higher pretransplant ferritin in auto and allogroups(p=,009; p=,009).Patients who developed fungal infections had elevated pretransplant ferritin (p=,003;p=,028). Acute graft versus host disease(aGVHD) was diagnosed in 30(20,3%) of allosubjects S174 median 43,5(12-94) days after HSCT. Pretransplant TS was higher in hepatic GVHD group(p=,04). Pretransplant serum ferritin was signifi cantly higher in SOS group(p=,01). A positive correlation was found between pretransplant ferritin, TS and Sorror's comorbidity index(CI) in allogroup (p=,0001,r=,314;p= ,01,r=,209) . The impact of ferritin on survival was independent from CI. A strong relationship was found between pretransplant ferritin and day30, day100 and OS(p=,001;p<,0001;p<,0001). F erritin had a signifi cant impact on OS in auto(p=,002),and on day30,day100 and OS in alloHSCT (p=,004;p=,001;p=,001). Survival probability was found signifi cantly lower when ferri-tin>1000 ng/ml(p=,0001). Conclusion: IO is a strong prognostic marker for OS and mortality in allo and autoHSCT survivors. Elevated pretransplant ferritin may contribute to development of toxic-infectious complications like SOS, aGVHD, mucositis and fungal infections through the pathway of oxidative stress and tissue damage caused by free oxygen radicals. Current study addresses the adverse impact of IO on survival and TRC. Our results should be validated with further prospective studies and methods to modify IO in patients who are candidates for HSCT should be developed.",

Of 106 patients consecutively transplanted since 2005, 64 had pre-AlloSCT ferritin levels available. Of these, 47 underwent Reduced Intensity Conditioned (RIC) AlloSCT (median age 53; range 20-64). The range of diagnoses included 13 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, 2 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 8 with myelodysplasia, 3 with chronic myeloid leukaemia, 4 with Hodgkin's lymphoma, 4 with myeloma, 10 with other chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, 1 with idiopathic myelofi brosis and 2 with severe aplastic anaemia. Three groups were arbitrarily defi ned by serum ferritin: Group 1 (ferritin <1000 micrograms/litre (mcg/L), Group 2 (ferritin 1000-2500 mcg/L) and Group 3 (ferritin >2500 mcg/L).

Transplant (non-relapse) Related Mortality (at 1 year) of the three groups was 6%, 27% and 63% respectively (p=0.0128), whereas disease-related mortality was 18%, 30% and 25% respectively (p=0.69). A multivariate analysis incorporating ferritin group, age, diagnosis and donor type showed only ferritin to be signifi cant (p=0.02) for overall survival in RIC AlloSCT recipients. No signifi cant effect of ferritin on prognosis was seen in our 17 FI conditioned AlloSCT recipients. We conclude that elevated ferritin pre-AlloSCT is an adverse prognostic indicator for RIC HSCT recipients, particularly in terms of transplant related mortality.",

Marbet, A. Gratwohl, D. Tsakiris University Hospital Basel (Basel, CH) Objectives: Investigation of the toxicity of Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-containing cryopreserved hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) on hemostasis by determination of platelet function and of coagulation and endothelial cell activation in patients receiving autologous HSC transplants (HSCT). Patients and methods: 40 patients (16 female, 24 male, age 54\u00b113 years) received autologous HSCT containing 7,5% DMSO. Underlying diseases were multiple myeloma (n=21), lymphoid neoplasia (n=10), acute leukemia (n=5), others (n=4). Blood samples were taken immediately before, 15 min and 16-18 hours after HSCT. We tested whole-blood platelet aggregation (adenosine-diphosphate [ADP 6.4mcM], collagen [COL 3.2mcg/ml], thrombin receptor activating peptide [TRAP 32mcM], and arachidonate [AA 0.5mM]), fi brinogen (FBG), d-dimers (DD), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag), and cell-membrane microparticle activity (MPA) measured as thrombin-generation. Results: Mean MPA (19\u00b19nM, 32\u00b119nM, 16\u00b18nM, p<0.001) and TAT (4\u00b12, 15\u00b111, 5\u00b15 mcg/L, p<0.001) increased significantly immediately after HSCT, returning to baseline the day after. No signifi cant changes were seen in FBG, DD, VWF: Ag. Only a trend for reduction of platelet aggregation with ADP (449\u00b1263, 380\u00b1277 AU, p=0.06) was found immediately after HSCT. Eight of 36 (22%) patients presented fever and/or urticaria immediately after transfusion of HSC, accompanied by higher DD (p<0.05) and TAT (only trend) changes. Discussion: We observed an activation of hemostasis, measured as increase of MPA and TAT immediately after HSCT. This effect is short-lasting and might be attributed to components of the HSC preparation including DMSO. Additional experiments addressing the infl uence of DMSO on platelet function in vitro and on direct endothelial toxicity are needed. Known adverse reactions to transfusion of cryopreserved HSC, such as fever and/or urticaria, were associated with higher DD and TAT changes.",

Michelis, M. Vagia, K. Manaka, V. Delistrati, I. Baltadakis, D. Karakasis, J. Apostolidis, N. Harhalakis, E. Nikiforakis Evangelismos Hospital (Athens, GR) Background: High-dose busulphan (Bu) is widely used in preparative regimens for AlloSCT. Intravenous Bu (ivBu) offers more predictable bioavailability than oral (poBu), avoiding erratic fl uctuations of serum concentrations. It has been proposed that this results in less toxicity without compromising effi cacy. Aim: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare poBu with ivBu in patients undergoing AlloSCT for AML or MDS in terms of regimen related toxicity (RRT), treatment related mortality (TRM), rate of relapse (RR), GVHD, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Methods: We retrospectively studied 172 adult patients allografted with myeloablative regimens based on poBu (n=135) or ivBu (n=37) during the period 1992-2008. Median follow up was 51 months for the poBu group and 13 months for the ivBu group. In the ivBu group median age was higher, high risk karyotype was more frequent, more donors were unrelated, and all grafts were peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). In the poBu group HLA typing was low resolution in 2/3 of patients receiving unrelated grafts, while marrow and PBSC grafts were equally used. Distribution of diagnostic categories and stage of disease prior to transplantation were similar between both groups. Use of ivBu was initiated in 2005. We adjusted for these potential confounding factors by employing multivariate statistical analysis. Results: Regarding RRT, poBu was associated with greater liver, gastrointestinal and renal toxicity, but this was of grade \u2264 2. The incidence of venoocclusive liver disease (VOD) did not differ between the two groups, although severe VOD developed in 2 patients in the poBu group vs 0 in the ivBu group. No differences in engraftment were observed. ivBu predicted for longer OS (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14-0.78), however no signifi cant difference was detected in the RR (cumulative incidence 30%), acute GvHD (54% overall), TRM (overall 7% at 100 days) and DFS (overall 64%) between the two groups. Discussion: Given the limitations of our study, the two routes of Bu administration did not differ in antileukemic activity and TRM. The OS benefi t probably refl ects improved results in the more recently transplanted patients and will have to be ascertained with longer follow-up. In pursuing a cost-effective transplant policy, the higher cost of ivBu should be accounted for when choosing formulation. ivBu may be more appropriate for patients with an increased risk of liver toxicity and VOD.",

Papusha, D. Balashov, A. Tulpakov, Y. Skvortsova, E. Skorobogatova, A. Maschan Research Center for Pediatric Hematology (Moscow, RU) Background: Conditioning regimens and complications of HSCT such as \"graft-versus-host\" disease (GVHD) may cause multiple endocrine dysfunctions in children. We analyzed risk factors for endocrine complications after nonmyeloablativecyclophosphamide (Cy), fl udarabine (Flu) and ATG or myeloablative Busulfan (Bu) or Melphalan (Mel)-based conditioning regimens in patients after HSCT. Patients and Methods: We studied 50 pts (27M/23 F) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and severe acquired aplastic anemia (SAA), 1-12 y after HSCT. All pts were divided according to receiving myeloablative (group I) or nonmyeloablative (group II) conditioning. Group I included 23 pts (12M,11F) with SAA, who received Cy, Flu and ATG. Group II included 27 pts (15M,12 F) with AML, who received conditioning with Bu 16 mg/kg or Mel 140 mg/kg with Cy or Fludarabine. Endocrine function tests included TSH and free thyroxin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) LH, FSH, estradiol and testosterone. Results: All children in group I had normal pubertal development, whereas in those from group II high incidence of gonadal dysfunction was revealed: ovarian failure was found in all but two patients in group II. Mean levels of FSH, LH and estradiol were 70 (45,6-89,2) UI; 35 (20-89,3) UI and 50 (10,9-80,2) pmol/l respectively. Only one girl of 10 recovered menstrual cycles after 1 year of hormone replacement therapy; in 80% of boys in group II germinal epithelial damage was observed 5 )UI/l), but Leydig cell function was normal in all pts (LH-6,7 (3,4-8) UI/l, testosteron 20,5 (9-30) nmol/l). No patients developed primary hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH-5,5 (4,2-6,7) mU/ml, free thyroxin-12 (10-13,8) pmol/l) was found in 3 pts with AA and 2 pts with AML. Growth retardation (mean height SDS=-2,5) was evident only in 4 patients with extensive chronic GVHD who received corticosteroids for > 1 year, independently of the type of conditioning. IGF-levels were normal in all pts. Conclusions: Myeloablative conditioning regimens produce gonadal damage in vast majority of children recipients of HSCT. cGVHD and prolonged steroid therapy predispose to growth retardation.

Vokurka, K. Steinerova, M. Karas, V. Koza University Hospital (Pilsen, CZ) Introduction: Conditioning regimens with reduced toxicity are suitable for older and pretreated patients. The FLU/MEL regimen comprising of fl udarabine total dose 125-150 mg/m2 and melphalan total dose 140-180 mg/m2 appears well-effective and accompanied by minimum of fatal toxic complications. To explore characteristics of oral mucositis (OM) and individual risk factors in widely used conditioning regimens is important issue that can help fi nd toxicity reducing approaches, high risk patients and candidates for novel therapeutical agents. (1, (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) 2) x106/kg, creatinine clearance: median 1,5 (0,4-3,0) ml/s, granulocytes \u22651x109/l on day: median 13 (0-26) post-transplant. Melphalan dose per kilogram of actual body weight ranged between 2,5-5,2 mg/kg (median 3,5 mg/kg) due to body surface area based dosing. OM incidence was 78%, grade 3-4 WHO 38%, OM onset on median day 6 (2-10) post-transplant, duration 12 (1-34) days, OM resolution on day 18 (9-37) posttransplant. OM in males vs. females: 67% vs. 89% (p=0,04), OM in melphalan dose per kg <3,5 vs. \u22653,5mg/kg: 65% vs. 88% (p=0,03). No correlations were observed between OM and age, patient-donor HLA identity and creatinine clearance (range 0,4-3,0 ml/s, median 1,5). In logistic regression analysis higher melphalan dose per kilogram of body weight remained significant predictor of OM (p=0,008). Conclusion: conditioning regimen FLU/MEL can be considered as high risky in respect to OM. The major factor infl uencing OM in FLU/MEL patients is melphalan dose administered per kilogram. Acute and chronic renal impairments are important complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A prospective study was conducted to investigate the glomerular renal function in children who received allogeneic HSCT from matched related donors. Non-TBI conditioning regimens were used in all but one patient. Glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR) and serial measurements of serum creatinine were evaluated prior to HSCT, within the fi rst 100 days and one year after. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defi ned as at least 1.5 fold rise in pre-HSCT serum creatinine within the fi rst 100 days and classifi ed as grade 1 to 3 according to the new defi nition criteria proposed by \"Acute Kidney Injury Network\". Fiftyseven patients (hemoglobinopathy,29; aplastic anemia,11; malignancy,17) were enrolled in the study and 24 patients (42%) had AKI. Grade 1, 2 and 3 AKI was detected in 12 (21%), 9 (16%) and 3 patients (5%) respectively. Cyclosporine, amphotericin B and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome were found as risk factors for AKI.",

All children with CKD had normal serum creatinine and none required dialysis. None of the patients had hypertension or anemia. We conclude that renal impairment is an important complication of HSCT and frequently occurs during the early phase of transplantation. Careful monitoring of renal function, minimizing the use of nephrotoxic medication, prophylaxis and effective treatment of SOS might be effective preventive measures to decrease the incidence of AKI. Methods: The Arabic translation followed the standard Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) translation methodology. Provisional Arabic FACT-BMT was pre-tested by personal interview of 20 native Arabic speaking patients. This version was then applied to the next 40 patients through telephonic interview for validation. One lymphoma and autologous stem cell transplant expert (S. Akhtar) also developed 17 additional culturally adapted questions (Cultural Adapted FACT-BMT) for relevant cultural issues. Preliminary result: Sixty patients, males 39 (65%), females 21 (35%) participated in the study. At the time of study, median age was 32 years (15 -62 years) and ECOG performance status was 0 in 73% and 1 in 22%. First 20 patients interviewed in pre-testing phase. All patients understood the questions well and no modifi cation has to be undertaken. The pre-test results indicated good content coverage and overall comprehensibility. All patients easily understood all items of Arabic version of FACT-BMT and high internal consistency in pre-testing phase is expected. Patients have high scores in all domains of quality of life including physical, social, emotional and functional wellbeing, indicating that most patients were leading a normal life. Patients scored > 70% for not at all (0) or a little bit (1) for lack of energy, nausea, trouble meeting needs of the family, having pain or feeling ill. Support from family and friends were > 80%. Quite a bit and very much satisfaction with sex life was 60%. Feeling sad was not at all (0) or a little bit (1) in 83%. Twenty percent patients were concerned about their ability to have children; this is a refl ection of younger patients being transplanted and also the social set up where the average family size usually exceeds 5 children. Statistical analysis is underway. Conclusions: These data validates the fi rst Arabic version FACT-BMT. This is likely to help large number of Arabic speaking patients, not only in the Middle East and Arab countries, but also in Europe and North America. Most of our patients enjoyed a good quality of life post HDC-ASCT.",

Results: 55, 47 and 36 patients were transplanted using the CY-TBI, Flu-Bu4 and Flu-Bu2-TT2, respectively. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) occurred in 15/55 (27.2%, p=0.59), 9/47 (19.1%) and 16/36 (44.4%, p=0.11) patients in the CY-TBI, Flu-Bu4 and Flu-Bu2-TT2 conditioning protocols respectively (significance compared to Flu-Bu4 that the lowest NRM). The patients treated with Flu-Bu2-TT2 had signifi cantly more total parenteral nutrition (TPN) days then the patients in the Flu-Bu4 group (p=0.03) which may refl ect the general toxicity of the conditioning as they express the patients' inability to either eat or tolerate food. There was no signifi cant difference in the frequency or grade of acute GVHD, although patients conditioned with Flu-Bu2-TT2 had slightly higher rate (p=0.1) and grade (p=0.08) of acute GVHD. There was no difference in the myelosuppression, blood loss, cGVHD, vital organs toxicity or infections. Conclusion: With minor variations, there is no signifi cant difference in the frequency and level of side effects and complications between CY-TBI, Flu-Bu4 and Flu-Bu2-TT2 myeloablative transplant conditioning protocols although days in need for TPN were signifi cantly higher in patients conditioned with Flu-Bu2-TT2 and a trend toward higher NRM, and the higher rate and grade of acute GVHD was seen in this group. We aimed to study the impact of high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) on nitrogen balance in patients with autoimmune diseases and hematological cancer. Patients and methods: 41 patients (male/female -22/19) undergoing HDCT+ASCT were enrolled in the study. The sample consisted of 26 patients with autoimmune diseases (male/ female -11/15) and 15 patients with hematological cancer (male/female -11/4). Mean patient age was 34 (range 17-63). Three conditioning regimens were used: BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan), mini BEAM (30% reduced BEAM), and BM (BCNU+melphalan). The following parameters were studied before transplantation and after stem cell reinfusion (D0, D+7, D+14): body mass, protein intake with food, daily urea excretion, and nitrogen balance. Results: After HDCT+ASCT dietary caloric intake decreased in 93% of patients, which is related to the loss of appetite, taste abnormalities, and nausea in this patient population. In 61% of S177 cases the caloric intake provided less than 70% of the total daily caloric need. The decrease in body mass was observed in 78% of patients. Insuffi cient protein intake (less than 1.2 g/kg body mass) was registered in 63% of patients. After HDCT+ASCT the increase in daily urea excretion as compared to baseline was observed in 73% of cases with the value more than doubling in 34% of patients. By D+7 the increase of daily urea excretion was noticed in 81% of patients (more than doubling in 27% of patients). By D+14 daily urea excretion decreased but in 59% of cases it was higher than before HDCT+ASCT. Negative nitrogen balance was observed in HDCT+ASCT patients: in 81% of patients at D0, in 93% of patients at D+7, and in 59% of patients at D+14. To ensure adequate and balanced diet, enteral and parenteral nutritional support was provided for patients undergoing HDCT+ASCT. Conclusion: HDCT+ASCT leads to abnormalities in nitrogen balance in the majority of patients. The question of optimization of nutritional support for this patient population needs further investigation.",

Baronciani, C. Depau, R. Murru, E. Angelucci Ospedale Oncologico \"A. Businco\" (Cagliari, IT) We report a case of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) following a reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation with major ABO mismatch, resistant to standard treatment and resolved during lenalidomide therapy. A 57 years old man was diagnosed of Multiple Myeloma (IgD / lamda, stage IIIA) in August 2003. After treatment with 4 cycles of VAD regimen and autologous stem cell transplantation, he received a reduced intensity allogeneic transplant from his HLA identical sister with major ABO incompatibility (donor B+ / recipient 0+). Post transplant period was uneventful but 40 days after transplantation patient progressively developed a pure red cell aplasia with high immune anti-donor isohemagglutinin titers (immune anti B, 1:512). Erithropoietin level was 203 mU/ml. Analysis of chimerism revealed allogeneic engrafment. In vitro bone marrow cultures showed CFU-E absence. Since transplant patient remain transfusion dependent receiving 4 units/ months of 0 + RBCU and chelation. Subsequently he was treated with several immunosopressive treatment: cyclosporine and steroids, plasma exchange (4 courses), 4 cycles of Rytuximab plus Cyclophosphamide, and fi nally with escalation doses of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) in association with 150 \u00ecg /weekly of erythropoietin (EPO). No clinical or laboratoristic improvement was observed. Extramedullary Myeloma relapse occurred in February 07'; he was treated with Bortezomib, Liposomial Doxorubicin and Dexamethasone for 8 cycles. Complete remission was obtained. PRCA was unchanged. A second extramedullary relapse was occurred in December 07'. He was submitted to a local radiotherapy and Lenalidomide (25 mg/day for 3 weeks) associated with low dose of Desamethasone (Rd). During the forth Rd cycle (in September 08'), together with Myeloma response, a stable increase of the hemoglobin value was observed (about 5 grams in two month). The anti-donor titers isohemagglutinin became undetectable, the direct ABO blood group converted to B+. Analysis of chimerism revealed a permanent allogeneic engrafment. Erithropoietin level was 35.8 mU/ml. This patient has been remaining transfusion-dependent 47 months after transplant, (total units of 0+ RBCU 184 since transplant), without conversion to the donor ABO blood group; only after the Lenalidomide treatment he was able to recover a normal hemoglobin value. This case indicates a possible immunomodulatory effect of Lenalidomide in the immunomediated PRCA.",

Fern\u00e1ndez-Avil\u00e9s, L. Quintana, P. Abrisqueta, M. Rovira, C. Mart\u00ednez, L. Rosi\u00f1ol, E. Carreras, J. Campistol, E. Montserrat Hospital Clinic (Barcelona, ES) Objective: We compared the incidence, kinetic and clinical impact of postransplant acute renal failure (ARF) in patients undergoing unmanipulated (allo-SCT) and CD34+ cell-selected (allo-SCT/CD34+) myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Methods: 120 patients were included in this study. Sixty received an allo-SCT (group A: 41 sibling and 19 unrelated donors) and sixty a sibling allo-SCT/CD34+ (group B). Conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg of body weight) and total body irradiation (12 Gy in 4 fractions in group A and 13 Gy in 4 fractions in group B), and graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis of cyclosporine A (CsA) plus methotrexate (group A) and CsA with or without methylprednisolone (group B). Prior chronic renal dysfunction (CRD) was defi ned as follows: estimated glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR) by Modifi cation of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation < 90 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2. ARF was divided into four categories: Grade 0: ARF <25% decrease in GFR from baseline, Grade 1: less than twofold rise in baseline serum creatinine and decrease in GFR between 25-50% from baseline, Grade 2: greater than twofold rise in baseline serum creatinine without the need for haemodialysis, Grade 3: greater than twofold rise in baseline serum creatinine and the need for haemodialysis. Results. Patient's median age was 34 years (18-54) in group A and 42 (18-64) in group B (p<0.001). Advanced disease was more frequent in group A (87% vs. 0%, p<0.00001). In our study, prior CRD did not infl uence the development of ARF (group A vs. B: 50.9% vs. 43.3%, p=NS). The incidence of ARF grades 3 and 2 (A vs. B) were 11.6% vs. 0% (p=0.01) and 56.6% vs. 73.3% (p=0.05), with a median (range) day of presentation of 16 (1-210) vs. 70.5 (6-390), respectively (p=0.00003). Patients of group A that developed ARF grades 3 and 2 had an increased risk of non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 6 months, as compared with those that developed ARF grade 0-1 (85.7% vs. 10.5%, p=0.0008; 38.2% vs. 10.5%, p=0.05, respectively). In group B, patients with ARF grade 2 do not show an increased NRM (18.2% vs. 12.5%, p=0.7). Conclusion. In this series, ARF grade 3 after allogeneic transplant was related with a very poor prognosis. ARF grade 2 was signifi cantly associated with higher NRM only in patients undergoing unmanipulated allo-SCT, corresponding to those who developed ARF in an early and critical period after transplant, in contrast to those that received an allo-SCT/CD34+. Patients and methods: Twenty-three consecutive patients with haematological malignancies (mainly acute myeloid leukaemia) S178 underwent HSCT in our Centre. All patients received busulfan over 4 days followed by cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg i.v. for 2 days as standard myeloablative conditioning regimen. Busulfan was administered in the 4-times-daily dosing schedule: group 1 (14 patients, median age 45 years, range 16-66) received i.v. busulfan 0.8 mg/kg every 6 hours, group 2 (9 patients, median age 37 years, range 25-50) received p.o. busulfan 1 mg/kg every 6 hours. In both groups the majority of the donors were unrelated (57% group 1; 67% group 2). The major source of stem cells was peripheral blood (78% group 1; 67% group 2). At the time of transplantation 64% of the patients in group1 were in complete remission, 55% in group 2. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis on the fi rst and last day of busulfan administration. Results: Table 1 provides a summary of the time of engraftment, regimen-related toxicity, incidence of acute GvHD, relapse, 100day transplant-related mortality (TRM) and pharmacokinetic data. All patients in group 1 achieved engraftment, while 1 patient in group 2 experienced engraftment failure and another patient died before engraftment could be evaluated. Median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was similar. Group 2 patients experienced a higher incidence of 100-day TRM (44% group 2; 0% group 1; p 0.03) and grade III-IV mucositis (78% group 2; 64% group 1; p 0.02). Median busulfan AUC on the fi rst and last day of oral administration in group 2 was higher than the targeted therapeutic window (AUCs between 900-1500 microMol/ min). Differences in relapse rate and incidence of hepatic venoocclusive disease (VOD) and grade II-IV acute GvHD were not signifi cant. No seizures were recorded in any of the patients. Conclusions: Our experience demonstrates that the conditioning regimen based on i.v. busulfan can be safer than the oral route considering the reduced incidence of severe mucositis and 100-day TRM, most likely because of dose assurance with predictable pharmacokinetics. No signifi cant difference in relapse rate and incidence of VOD was observed.",

Komarnicki University oF Medical Sciences (Poznan, PL) Background: Iron overload is associated with increased morbidity and mortality among HSCT recipients. We evaluated the risk of infections, organ toxicity and TRM within 100 days after HSCT with respect to pretransplant serum ferritin levels. Methods: A total of 61 patients (median age 42; range 19-68) were analyzed. Twenty one pts with AML (10), ALL (3), AA (3) and HD (5) underwent allogeneic PBSCT (14) or BMT (7). Forty pts with NHL (14), HD (11), MM (11) and AML (4) were treated with autologous PBSCT (36) or BMT (4). Elevated ferritin level >300 ug/dL was found in 54 (88,5%) pts: 300-1000 in 25 (41%); 1000-2000 in 15 (24,5%); 2000-3000 in 7 (11,5%) and >3000 in 7 (11,5%) pts. Results: neutrophil recovery occurred in 57 pts at 16 (12-54) days; 4 pts died before hematologic reconstitution due to septic shock (1) or multiorgan failure (3). Infection complications up to 100 days occurred in 45 (74%) pts including: FUO (27), bacterial (17), fungal (5); CMV (10), and VZV (2) infections. Organ dysfunction (renal, hepatic, lung) was diagnosed in 7 patients. GVHD>2-4 was diagnosed in 4 (19%) pts from allogeneic group. Eight (13%) pts died up to 100 days due to bacterial infection (1), invasive aspergillosis (2), GVHD (1) or multiorgan failure (4). Ferritin level >1000 ug/dL was associated with signifi cant higher rate of organ toxicity and TRM (p=0.046 and p=0.083 respectively). Factors signifi cant for unfavourable outcome at day +100 by Kaplan-Meier analysis were: ferritin level >1000 ug/dL (0.724\u00b10.083 vs 0.938\u00b10.043, p=0.025), advanced disease (0.730\u00b10.073 vs 1.000, p=0.006), and alloHSCT (0.571\u00b10.108 vs 0.975\u00b10.025, p<0.001). Factor predicting overall survival by multivariate analysis in Cox model was alloHSCT (p=0.029, HR=6.5, 95%CI=1.3-166). Conclusions: Elevated level of pretransplant ferritin >1000 ug/ dL is associated with increased risk for multiorgan failure and toxic deaths following HSCT. Of the 63 patients studied, 43(68%) received sibling allografts and 20(32%) matched unrelated transplants for predominantly malignant haematological conditions. The median age at transplant was 43 years (range 19-66 years). The median time of sampling post HSCT was 42 months (12-262 months). Twenty three (37%) had a reduced intensity transplant while 37 of the remaining 40 received TBI based myeloablative conditioning. Twenty fi ve (40%) received Alemtuzumab (Campath) pretransplant. 38(60%) received haemopoietic progenitor cells collected by apheresis (HPC-A). Of the 63 patients, 8(13%) were lymphopenic; 5 of whom had cGVHD. Ten (16%) had low NK cells. 29 (46%) patients had an inverted CD4/8 (<1) ratio (even when CD4 numbers were within our reference range), 11 of these patients were 3-5 years & 6 patients >5years post transplant. Persistent CD4 lymphopenia was seen in 12 patients, 3 of whom were >5 years post transplant (although more common in the group with cGVHD, the difference was not statistically signifi cant). Fewer patients in the group receiving HPC-A had low NK and T lymphocyte numbers compared with recipients of marrow stem cells (p<0.05 and 0.001 respectively). Recipients of matched unrelated transplants had lower NK cells (p<0.05), lymphocytes (p<0.01), and particularly CD4+ counts (p<0.05) compared with sibling donors (the proportion of HPC-A to HPC-M was similar in both groups). Age at transplant, intensity of conditioning including TBI & Campath did not demonstrably affect reconstitution in our limited cohort of patients. Immune reconstitution post HSCT is variable, with low CD4 counts and an inverted CD4/8 ratio commonly seen; this may S179 result from ongoing thymic insuffi ciency post transplant. In our study the source of stem cells and chronic GVHD were the main contributory factors, however the signifi cance of an inverted CD4/8 ratio remains to be fully evaluated. Background: Although i.v. BU has been recently introduced into clinical use worldwide, drug profi les of i.v. BU preparation have not been fully evaluated in different races, who may have different PK. As part of our pivotal study in Japan, we conducted a phase II study with PK analysis of a combined i.v. BU and CY regimen administered before allo-or auto-SCT. Patients and Methods: Patients with hematological malignancies were eligible for this study (age, 5 to 55 years). The efficacy variables were engraftment, relapse, OS and DFS. The safety variables were NRM and adverse events including seizure, VOD, GVHD. The conditioning regimen consisted of i.v. BU (at 0.8 mg/kg for 2 h every 6 h at a total of 16 doses, days -7 to -4) and CY (at 60 mg/kg for 3 h at a total of 2 doses, days -3 and -2). Seizure prophylaxis was phenytoin from day -9. For allo-SCT patients, GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CYA and short-term MTX. Multiple PK samples were taken on 1st and 9th doses. BU levels were determined by a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric detection method. PK modeling was performed using WinNonlin. Results: Thirty patients (28 HLA-matched allo-SCT, 2 auto-SCT; median age, 30 years) were enrolled between 7/2002 and 10/2003. The diseases were 13 AML (11CR), 5 ALL (4CR), 5 CML-CP, 4 NHL (3CR) and 3 MDS. There were no signifi cant toxicities, and all but one patient showed evidence of neutrophil engraftment at a median of 14 days for allo-SCT and 11 days for auto-SCT. Grade II-IV acute and chronic GVHD occurred in 9 (33%) and 16 patients (59%), respectively. Four patients (15%) died of non-relapse causes: MOF, chronic GVHD, hepatic failure and viral pneumonia. The relapse rate at 1-year was 26%, and 4 patients (15%) died of relapse. OS and DFS at 1-year in allo-SCT was 78% and 63%, respectively (median follow-up: 413 days). The 2 auto-SCT patients were alive disease-free at 1-year. The PK of i.v. BU showed close inter-and intrapatient consistency. The mean AUC for dose 1 and dose 9 was 1171 micromol min/L and 1242 micromol min/L, and the mean Cmax was 994 ng/mL and 1311 ng/mL, respectively. The AUC of the 1st dose was below 1500 micromol min/L in 27 patients (90%), and this was within the range of 900 to 1350 micromol min/L in 21 patients (72%). Conclusions: Since all of the profi les overlap with non-Japanese data, we conclude that racial factors may not seriously infl uence the bioactivity of i.v. BU and a combined i.v. BU and CY regimen may be practically useful. A. Tendas, P. Niscola, S. Delogu, T. Dentamaro, L. Cupelli, A. Siniscalchi, L. Scaramucci, M. Giovannini, M. Ales, G. Natale, R. Cinque, A.P. Perrotti, P. De Fabritiis S. Eugenio Hospital (Rome, IT) Background. Motor disability (MD) is a reduction of motor function when compared with normal condition. Althougth frequently observed in hematological malignancies, MD was rarely explored and reported in patients (pts) undergoing stem cells transplantation (BMT). Patients and methods. We defi ned MD incidence, etiology and pathophysiology in 24 pts, undergoing 25 BMT (20 autologous and 5 allogeneic, standard conditioning regimen in all cases). Median age was 42 years (18-70). Diagnosis at BMT was: acute leukemia in 5, multiple mieloma in 11, lymphoma in 8, myelodisplasia (MDS) in 1. Disease phase was: complete remission in 14, partial remission in 10, at diagnosis in 1 (MDS). Pts disability was assessed weekly by Barthel index (BI), till discharge. Mechanism of MD was defi ned with a scale derived by NCI 3.0 toxicity criteria, adjusted for motor functioning (Table 1) . Results. At entry MD (grade 2 or more) was present in 3/25 pts. During BMT disability (grade 2 or more) was increased to 10/25 transplants; among 10 disable pts, grade 2 MD (without ADL impairment) and grade 3-4 MD (ADL impairment) were observed in 4/10 and 6/10, respectively. At discharge, MD was still present in 6 pts ( Figure 2 ). Single or multiple mechanisms of MD were: muscular defi cit in 8 pts (fatigue/muscle wasting in 6, CNS damage related hypotrophia in 2); bone/joint damage with movement-related pain in 3 pts; respiratory tract infection in 2 pts; others central or peripheral nervous system alterations in 3 pts; movement-related pain alone in 1; visual defi cit in 1. Among 18 MD episodes in the 10 MD pts, 14 were due to treatment and 4 were due to cause not related with disease. Conclusion. In our experience motor ability impairment is a frequent feature in the setting of hemopoietic stem cells transplantation, with 40% of pts experiencing a worsening on motor functioning during procedure, mainly due to treatment-related complications. Larger studies are needed to understand disability risk factors and to plan rehabilitative programs to prevent and treat disability. Effects on both pts quality of life and caregiver work-load are strongly expected.",

Study 2: 15 patients (18-45 years), at least 2 years post-BMT, completed standardised measures of QOL (physical (PCS) and mental (MCS)), posttraumatic stress (PTS), optimism, self efficacy and late-effects. Information was also taken from medical records. Results: Study 1: Interviews were analysed using template analysis. Patients describe their QOL as good; but more compromised where patients experience late effects and transplantrelated complications. Patients experience worsened physical QOL, due to decreased mobility and increased fatigue. Psychosocial variables including optimism and social support were important for managing compromised QOL. Study 2: Quantitative data were analysed using t-tests and correlations. Patients' PCS and MCS scores did not differ signifi cantly from population norms. Patients with more late effects recorded in medical notes had lower PCS scores (p<0.005). High self-reported late effects and PTS symptoms were associated with lower MCS scores (p<0.005; p<0.01). Higher MCS scores were associated with higher optimism (p<0.005) and self effi cacy (p<0.05). There was no correlation between PCS scores and psychosocial variables. Conclusion: These fi ndings suggest that following BMT, patients experience good QOL. However late-effects and PTS may compromise this. Psychosocial variables help patients to cope and may act as a buffer, enabling patients to experience good QOL despite the negative effects of BMT. The advantages of the mixed methods approach include greater insight into QOL effects and patients adaptation to limitations, coupled with the ability to compare against population norms. We conclude there is a need for a BMT specifi c measure of QOL sensitive to the issues identifi ed in the interviews, including late effects of treatment. Bone loss is recognized as worsening the quality of life (QoL) in long-term survivors of allogeneic SCT (Allo-SCT). Therefore, this study evaluated the risk factors associated with bone loss and the role of zoledronic acid in preventing bone loss in allogeneic recipients. Fifty-three patients who underwent HLA-matched Allo-SCT were evaluated for their bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spine and femoral neck at regular intervals. Zoledronic acid (4 mg) was given intravenously to 18 patients (ZA patients) at 2 months after SCT and then every 3 months until 2 years. Grade 2-4 acute GVHD was associated with bone loss (OR=4.90, 95% CI=1.41-16.99; p=0.012) at 1 year after SCT, while the existence of extensive chronic GVHD and steroid use were both unfavorable prognostic factors (OR=9.00 and 7.22, 95% CI=1.52-53.40 and 1.44-36.22; p=0.016, respectively) in terms of osteopenia/osteoporosis at 2 years after transplantation. Prophylactic use of zoledronic acid signifi cantly prevented bone loss in the femoral neck, as well as the spine (OR=0.18, 95% CI=0.05-0.69, p=0.012). Therefore, BMD measurements and the use of zoledronic acid are recommended in the case of GVHD or long-term steroid use after Allo-SCT to improve the QoL.",

Yegin Gazi University Faculty of Medicine (Ankara, TR) Objectives: To investigate the effects of bone marrow fi brosis (BMF) on hematopoietic stem cell transpalantation (HSCT). Methods: In this study, we retrospectively analysed the data of 175 patients with a diagnosis of hematological malignancy, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and primitive neuroectodermal tumor, who underwent autologous or allogeneic HSCT (69 autologous HSCT, 106 allogeneic HSCT) at the Stem Cell Transplantation Unit of Gazi University. At the time of HSCT, the median age of patients was 33 years (range 16-68) and, 56 were female and 119 male. The median time from diagnosis to HSCT was 332 days (range 38-3107 days). Post transplantation follow-up was 318 days (range 10-1433) in autologous HSCT patients, and 265 days (range 7-1307) in allogeneic HSCT patients. Bone marrow fi brosis was evaluated immediateley before the HSCT. The effects of BMF on engraftment, graft versus host disease (GVHD), early post-transplantation complications and survival were evaluated. Results: Nineteen (27.5%) of the autologous HSCT patients, and 38 (35.8%) of the allogeneic HSCT patients had BMF before HSCT. Pre-transplantation BMF did not cause delayed engraftment, and had no impact on early post-transplantation complications. Development of acute and/or chronic GVHD were also not affected by the presence of fi brosis in the bone marrow. Overall survival (OS) was 76.7% in patients with and 88.6% in patients without fi brosis (p>0.005) while progression free survival (PFS) was 26.33% in patients with and 16.5% in patients without fi brosis (p>0.05) in autologous HSCT recipients with a follow up period of median 318 days (range 10-1433). Although the presence of fi brosis seems to decrease OS an PFS, this decrease did not reach signifi cant levels in autologous HSCT patients. OS (35.2% vs. 48.9%) (p=0.004) and PFS (27.8% vs 51.2%) (p=0.0008) decreased signifi cantly with BMF with a follow up period of 265 days (range 7-1307) in patients who received allogeneic HSCT. Cox regression analysis showed that the effect of BMF on survival in allogeneic HSCT reciepients was independent of age, Sorror comorbidity index, primary disease and disease status during HSCT (p=0.05). Conclusion: Pretransplant BMF does not affect engraftment, early post transplantation complications and mortality, in allogeneic HSCT patients, However it seems to cause a relatively poor prognosis in terms of overall survival.",

            "text": "Optimal conditioning needed for stable engraftment and full immune reconstitution (IR) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in primary immunodefi ciency (PID) is undetermined. Bu/Cy conditioning is associated with short and long-term treatment-related toxicity, particularly in children with pre-existing end-organ damage. Reduced intensity (RIC) regimens have been proposed, with good results in some centres. We present our results. 33/135 patients transplanted 1999-2007 received Flu/Melph based RIC. 5 had SCID (mean age at HSCT 0.7 months, range 6-12), 28 other PID (mean age 8.5 yrs, range 0.16-17 yrs). All received Flu 150mg/m\u00b2, Melph 140mg/m\u00b2; 6/33 also received ATG and 27/33 Campath 1-H. All received CSA as graft-vs host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. 18 had pre-existing chest-, 4 hepatic-and 10 severe gastrointestinal-(GI) disease. HSC source was matched sibling or family donor bone marrow (BM) in 10, 10/10 HLA-matched volunteer unrelated donor (VUD) BM in 13, VUD peripheral blood (PBSCT) in 4, VUD cord blood (2 9/10 HLA-matched) in 5 and T cell depleted haplo-identical parental BM in 1. There was an average 18 days until neutrophil and platelet engraftment. 1 yr survival was 28/33 (85%), with survival at last follow up (FU) of 25/33 (78%) (median FU 28 months, range 0.5 -6 yrs) -SCID 80%, non-SCID 75%. 5 deaths occurred within 1 yr of HSCT from infection (3) and GI complications (2). 3 late deaths were due to GvHD. 7/8 deaths were amongst the fi rst RIC transplants performed in our unit. 23/33 (70%) had GvHD, only 5 > grade II. 13/33 (40%) reactivated viruses (CMV 4, HHV6 4, Adenovirus 2, EBV 3). 11/25 survivors (44%) had 100% donor chimerism, 14 (56%) had stable mixed chimerism, 7 (28%) required boost infusions within 12 months of HSCT for falling chimerism. 16/25 are >1yr post HSCT; all have normal T lymphocyte function, 12/16 are IVIG independent, with normal vaccine antigen responses. These results are excellent with overall survival comparable with current European data. IR was good, with surviving patients cured of underlying immunodefi ciency. Viral re-activation is a recognised complication of RIC HSCT: PCR surveillance and prompt pre-emptive treatment with anti-viral agents should reduce mortality. Late aGvHD remains a problem, although in most patients it was \u2264 grade II. RIC has a role in successful HSCT of the sickest PID patients; viral reactivation and GvHD remain risks. FU studies are required to determine long-term outcome. Mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a key protein in the signal transduction pathway of a broad range of cytokines, are found in patients with autosomal dominant Hyper IgE syndrome (HIES). We have previously described successful HSCT with no amelioration of disease in a patient with HIES1. We re-evaluate our experience. Patient 1 suffered severe infected eczemoid dermatitis, recurrent staph & pseudomonas infection, staphylococcal pneumatoceoles, and ankle + wrist fractures. She had novel heterozygous STAT3 mutation (g.1771A>G, p.K591E), predicted to disrupt the SH2 domain. She underwent 10/10 HLA-matched URD HSCT after conditioning with Bu16/Cy200, aged 7 years. After 12 yrs follow up, she is 100% donor, has had infected eczema (St. aureus, pseudomonas) controlled and resolving over 7-8 years, softening of facial features, normalization of lumbar spinal bone density over 8 years (previously -2SD below normal), no further signifi cant lung infections and normal lung function. She has ankle and knee instability, but no new fractures, and developed thoracolumbar scoliosis 10 yrs post HSCT. Her IgE remains elevated. Patient 2 experienced Severe bilateral lower, middle, and lingular lobe bronchiectasis, recurrent pseudomonal chest infections despite antibiotic and immunoglobulin trearment, recurrent severe impetigo & chronic dermatitis and osteopenia with vertabral crush fractures T10-L2. He had a heterozygous STAT3 mutation (g.1144C>T, p.R382W) predicted to disrupt the DNA-binding domain. He underwent a 10/10 HLA identical URD HSCT after conditioning with C-1H, Flu/Melph, aged 13 yrs. After 3 yrs follow up, he has had 3 episodes of bronchopneumonia, reduced but stable lung function, his bone density has normalized and he remains 100% donor. Functional studies of fi broblasts, lymphocytes and osteoclasts are in progress. HSCT does appear to modify disease process in STAT3defi cient HIES. The effect may be more like that of HSCT for metabolic disease -with slow onset of effect and resolution of pathology. The effect on development of lymphoma is yet to be determined, and long-term follow up is required to determine benefi t. Further studies are required to determine which patients would benefi t from HSCT, but it may have a role in treatment for selected patients. Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is a autosomal recessive disorder characterized by immunodefi ciency, characteristic facial appearance, chromosomal instability, X-ray hypersensitivity, and predisposition to malignancy. Patients harbour mutations in NBS1 which encodes for nibrin, a protein critically important in DNA double strand repair. About 40% of patients develop malignancy mostly of lymphoid origin before age 21. Traditionally NBS patients have not undergone HSCT owing to concerns about chromosomal instability and increased toxicity. Only 2 cases have been reported, both included in this series. We therefore attempted to summarize the limited transplant experience in NBS patients in Europe. A total of six patients could be included. All carried homozygous NBS1 mutations. Median age at diagnosis was 7.6 years (range 1-18) and 14.5 years (2.3-20. 3) at transplant. The reason to attempt SCT was resistant or secondary malignancy in four cases. The other two were transplanted because of severe immunodefi ciency or suspected Fanconi anaemia (FA) with immunodefi ciency. All had a T-cell defect and 4/6 had defi cient humoral immunity before transplant. As expected the conditioning regimes varied widely, however 5 patients received S182 reduced intensity regimens with in vivo T-cell depleting agents. The donors were matched family members in 3 patients, one haploidentical parent and two matched unrelated donors. At a median follow up of 2.2 years (1.6-8.1) fi ve of six patients are alive and well. Three patients had no relevant transplant related complications. Three had severe mucositis and infectious complications, one of whom died on day +5 from sepsis. The latter one was the patient who had received BMT from a matched sibling after a myeloablative, busulfan containing conditioning regimen. Acute GVHD grade I-II occurred in 3/5 patients, mild chronic GVHD in one. Four patients are either complete or nearly complete donor chimeras, one has mixed chimerism, all fi ve exhibit restored T-cell immunity. Four patients have normal humoral immunity and one remains on IVIG at 1.6 years post transplant. Although very limited, the experience in these six patients suggests that SCT in NBS is feasible, can correct the immunodefi ciency and effectively treat malignancy. Acute toxicity seems to be reasonable with reduced intensity conditioning regimens. However, valid concerns remain about increasing the risk for subsequent malignancy through cytotoxic agents in these patients.",

            "text": "Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in Griscelli syndrome type 2: a single-centre report of 10 patients J. Pachlopnik Schmid (1) Griscelli syndrome type 2 is a rare immune disorder causing potentially fatal hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment. Only few cases of successful HSCT have been described and optimal modalities are not yet well known. We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of HSCT that was performed in 10 consecutive patients with Griscelli syndrome type 2 who were treated in a single center between 1996 and 2008. Seven patients (70%) survived and were cured from the primary immune defect with a median follow-up of 3.4 years (147 days -11 years), death occurred in 3 patients within 110 days after HSCT. One patient received 2 transplants because of graft failure that had led to HLH relapse. Grade II-III acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease occurred after 7 and 1 transplants, respectively. Veno-occlusive disease was observed after 5 transplants. Two patients experienced EBVinduced lymphoproliferative disease after HSCT. Out of seven patients with neurological involvement prior to HSCT, four survived and two presented neurological long-term sequelae. Furthermore, one patient without neurological involvement prior to HSCT developed long-term neurological sequelae. Taken together, this survey demonstrates effi cacy of HSCT to cure the immune disorder of Griscelli syndrome type 2. It shows that neurological involvement, which is common in these patients prior to HSCT, is, however, a major concern, also after successful HSCT. Therapy-associated immunosuppression might contribute to the emergence of EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disease. Additional studies are required to improve the transplantation procedure and reduce its toxic effects. It is likely that preemptive HSCT, i.e. before the occurrence of HLH is to be favorized. Patient: We report on a male twin born at a gestational age of 38+3. At day 6 of life, the patient presented fever, abdominal symptoms and pancytopenia requiring repeated platelet and red blood cell transfusions. Neutropenia persisted despite G-CSF. Several myelograms showed empty bone marrow with exception of lymphoid cells, also found in the peripheral blood being exclusively CD4+ without signs of activation. The patient showed hepatomegaly, severe hyperbilirubinaemia, cutaneous eruption and repeated gastrointestinal bleedings. Digestive endoscopy at 2,5 months of age evidenced gastritis and subtotal villous atrophy of the duodenum. Liver biopsy could not be performed initially because of profound thrombocytopenia. Evolution: At about two months of age, neutrophils appeared, as did eosinophils and monocytes. HLA typing on peripheral blood revealed the presence of three alleles. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation found 100% XY cells in the peripheral blood, thus ruling out materno-fetal GVHD. The origin of the third allele was compatible with the presence of cells of his twin brother. HLA typing on sorted cells revealed that the CD3 positive cells belonged to both twin brothers, whereas the CD3 negative cells were predominantly of \"donor\"-origin. At about three months of age, reticulocytes were present and the patient's blood group changed into the group of his twin brother. At the age of 10 months platelet counts were > 100.000/\u00b5l. Severe liver damage led to hepatocellular failure requiring an urgent liver transplantation at 7 months of age. Histological fi ndings of the explanted liver are compatible with GVHD driven liver destruction, HLA typing on liver tissue confi rmed the presence of alleles of the twin brother. Discussion: Maternal microchimerism can be detected quite frequently in healthy individuals, but it is usually not associated with disease. Materno-fetal GVHD is observed in immunodeficient children. Chimerism involving all peripheral blood cell subsets has been frequently described in healthy chimeric twins, who usually present immunological tolerance as evidenced by mutual absence of alloreactivity in mixed lymphocyte culture. To our knowledge, we report the fi rst patient with feto-fetal cell transfer presenting deleterious consequences due to intrauterine GVHD. The question whether the cell-transfer occurred on the basis of a primary immunodefi ciency in the recipient is currently under investigation. Background: The acute infl ammatory cerebral form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in adult men (ACALD) is as devastating as in childhood. While HSCT is an accepted long-term treatment method in boys with cerebral disease (C. Peters, Blood, 2004) , there are only anecdotal reports in men. Based on neurologic criteria, we defi ned a group of ACALD patients who were eligible for HSCT on a compassionate use basis in order to prevent complete dementia.",

Pts. were able to walk (Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) <7.0), had no major bladder dysfunction and no severe impairment of cortical functions incompatible with normal daily life. Infl ammatory CNS disease was demonstrated by contrast enhancement in MRI. The preparative regimen consisted of oral busulfan (4 x 4 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (2 x 60 mg/kg), and ATG.

In these pts. a complete loss of intellectual functions could be prevented after an initial phase of mild to moderate deterioration. Their loss of motor function post BMT correlated with their initial impairment. In contrast, the pt. #2 with GvHD had evidence of persistent cerebral infl ammation. Despite a favourable baseline status, the pt. showed an unexpected degree of deterioration both in motor as well as in cerebral function. Conclusion: These preliminary results indicate: 1) The above approach seems to be safe and feasible for ACALD pts. 2) Prevention of GvHD and severe tx complications is crucial for halting CNS infl ammation as early as possible. 3) Progression of advanced neuropathy appears to be poorly infl uenced by BMT. Until more data are available HSCT should only be offered in experienced centers to carefully chosen pts.",

            "text": "How to condition patients with Omenn syndrome or atypical SCID with gamma delta T-cell predominance? Single-centre experience on 10 patients K. Kalwak (1) Hypomorphic mutations of the RAG1/2 genes may generate different phenotypes, characterized by residual T\u00b1B-cell differentiation. They impair but do not abolish the V(D)J recombination process and are responsible for the Omenn phenotype or atypical SCID with gamma delta T-cell predominance. It remains controversial, which conditioning regimen is optimal for this specifi c cohort of immunodefi cient children with residual T cell function. Another question is, whether these pts have to be given conditioning in matched sibling donor (MSD) setting, or not. Here we report on ten patients: eight pts with either symptomatic or asymptomatic Omenn Syndrome due to del368/369AA hypomorphic mutation (n=3), Artemis mutation (n=1) or unknown mutation (n=4) and two pts with atypical SCID with gamma delta T-cells due to the same hypomorphic del368/369AA mutation. There were 3 girls and 7 boys aged from 1 to 48 months (median 9 months), who underwent primarily haploidentical CD34\u00b1enriched T-depleted PBSCT (n=6), (m)MUD-PBSCT (n=3) or MSD-BMT (n=1) . Conditioning regimens were myeloablative, incl. Bu or Treo \u00b1 Cy \u00b1Flu \u00b1Thiotepa except for one pt. given RIC. Two patients with hypomorphic mutations resulting in two different phenotypes (Omenn and atypical SCID with gamma delta T-cells) rejected haploidentical T-cell depleted PBSCT and were successfully retrasplanted from 7/10 HLAallele-mismatched unrelated donor (UD) in one case and from fully matched UD in another case. The pt with atypical SCID was conditioned with RIC, incl. Flu, Mel, Campath-1H, the pt with Omenn S. was given Bu, Flu, TT, OKT-3 and ATG. Another pt with asymptomatic Omenn S. given only Bu, Cy developed Omenn-like symptoms post haplotransplant incl. commencing rejection with autologous T cells, but was successfully reconditioned with OKT-3, steroids. Three pts died early posttransplant due to sepsis (n=2) or CMV infection (n=1). Remaining 7 children, incl. both with atypical SCID are alive and well from 3 to 111 months posttransplant (median 38 months). In conclusion: Haploidentical T-depleted PBSCT in patients with hypomorphic RAG mutations remains associated with increased risk of graft rejection due to partial autologous T-cell function. Pretransplant immunosuppressive therapy should be performed in all symptomatic pts. We strongly recommend myeloablative conditioning regimens for this specifi c cohort of pts, incl. Bu, Flu, TT, OKT-3/ATG in haploidentical setting and TREO, CY/FLU \u00b1ATG in MUD/MSD-setting. Background: Busulfan combined with therapeutic drug monitoring guided dosing is associated with higher event free survival (EFS) rates due to less graft-failure/relapses and lower toxicity in haematological stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In an earlier study, our group showed an optimal AUC between 74-82 mg*h/L in a group of children with malignant and nonmalignant indications. Nonmalignant diseases, especially inborn error of metabolism (IEM) are known to be associated with high graft-failure rates. It is not known whether there is an optimal target AUC in nonmalignant diseases. Historically intravenous busulfan has been used in the two Dutch pediatric stem cell transplantation centers in various myelo-ablative regimens with different targets for the area under the curve (AUC) and different dosing regimens of busulfan. We retrospectively analyzed the association between busulfan AUC and clinical outcome. Methods: All children, transplanted between 2001-2008, receiving intravenous busulfan as part of a myeloablative regimen for non-malignant indications, were included. The association between an AUC below or above the optimum of 74mg*h/L and the endpoints overall survival (OS), treatment related mortality (TRM), event free survival (EFS) and toxicity (acute-Graftversus-Host Disease grade 2-4 (aGvHD) and Veno-occlusive Disease (VOD), were tested using uni-and multivariable Cox regression analysis. Results: 28 patients with IEM, 36 with immune defi encies and 5 patients with bone marrow failures were included, with a median follow up time of 2.5 years. EFS was negatively infl uenced by Graft-failure below the lower limit of the AUC (18% in patients receiving <74mg*h/L, vs 0% in patients receiving > 74mg*h/L, HR=0.2, P=0.016). OS was similar in both groups (OS 20% vs 19%). All but one patients died due to TRM. EFS was 72% vs 82% (not signifi cantly different). Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) grade 2-4 did occur more frequently in patients receiving a high exposure of busulfan (5% vs 20%), but this was not signifi cantly different. VOD was seen in 13% vs 17% of the two AUC-groups. Conclusion: Dose targeting of busulfan to a high therapeutic range decreases the amount of graft failures in patients with non-malignant diseases, without compromising the treatment due to treatment related mortality.",

            "text": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation in Farber's disease with bone involvement: long-lasting and substantial improvement A. Jarisch, J. Soerensen, L. Porto, M. Kieslich, T. Klingebiel, P. Bader Goethe University Frankfurt (Frankfurt, DE) Introduction: Farber disease (FD) is a rare, lysosomal storage disorder caused by a defi ciency of acid ceramidase and subsequent accumulation of ceramide in various organs and tissues. Clinical features are characterized by subcutaneous skin nodules mostly near the joints leading to stiffness, contractures and deformation and progressive hoarseness. 7 different phenotypes are reported due to additional organ involvement, like the lungs, nervous system, heart and lymph nodes. Patients with neurological involvement mostly die in early childhood whereas in other phenotypes mostly respiratory insuffi ciency leads to death in the second decades of live. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may offer the only curative treatment for FD patients and only few patients are transplanted so far. Case report: We present a patient with FD type 3. She showed typical features like hoarseness, failure to thrive and multiple subcutaneous skin nodules. HSCT was discussed but no matching donor was found. At the age of 9 years she presented with contractures and joint deformations restricting her to wheelchair. In cranial MRI no neurological manifestation was seen but a nearly complete destruction of dens axis with spinal compression due to bone involvement of the underlying disease proven by biopsy. The patient was in danger to develop a tetraplegia and at this time a matched unrelated donor could be identifi ed. She underwent a myeloablative matched unrelated SCT. Subcutaneous skin nodules resolved completely after 3 months. The acid ceramidase activity in white cells was 0.28 (range 0.33-2.42) and b-galactosidase activity was normal. The MRI showed an exceptionally improvement of bone structure and density of dens axis without further stenosis and spinal compression. Although treated with a myeloablative conditioning regimen the patient remained mixed chimeria with increasing autologous cells. Several donor lymphocyte infusions (n=5) were given, the patient complete rejected the graft 2 year post transplant and became aplastic. A second SCT from her haploidentical father was performed. 21 month post 2nd transplant she is well, complete donor chimerism, is able to walk and is showing a continuously improvement of all physical abilities. Conclusion: We report the fi rst patient with proven bone involvement of Farber disease. In our patient HSCT improves the manifestation of FD even though SCT was done at the age of 9 years. Background: Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the only treatment that defi nitively restores normal hematopoiesis in patients with bone marrow failure syndrome (BMF). An alternative donor is required in patients who do not have a matched related family donor. In this study we report our experience over ten years. Patients and Method: Between August 1998 and October 2008, 31 patients with BMF underwent transplantation from 22 related and 9 unrelated donor. Patient group consists of 17 Fanconi aplastic anemia (FAA), 8 aplastic anemia (AA), 2 amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, 2 Kostman syndrome, 1 Diamond Blackfan anemia, 1 Diskeratosis conjenita. The median age was 10 year (range 1-17) and 21 were male. All patients with anemia were transfusion dependant. Bone marrow, peripheral blood and cord blood were used as stem-cells source in patients, 4, 24, 3 respectively. We have used four different conditioning regimen. Fludarabine based regimen or CY-ATG with thoraco-abdominal irradiation (TAI) regimen for FAA patients, CY+ATG regimen for AA patients and Busulfan+CY for DBA and Kostman syndrome were performed. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was cyclosporine alone for FAA patients (MMF for two FAA patients) and methotrexate plus cyclosporine A for other patients. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment occurred in all patients on day 12 (8-66) and day 17 (15-49), respectively. Post-transplant graft failure was occurred in two patients. Only one patient succumbed because of transplantation related problem in fi rst 100 days. Acute GVHD and chronic GVHD were found in 7 patients (6 patients grade II-III, one patient grade IV) and one patient, respectively. Overall and disease free survival were found 81%. Conclusion: We conclude that SCT the only curative treatment modality for BMF patients. Fludarabine based regimen was found more tolerable by patients and successful than regimen with TAI in FAA patients. Transfusion related complications and severe infections that worsens post-transplant outcome should be considered for each patient. The planning of expedited SCT might be more cost-effective and feasible before occurrence of complications for BMF patients. Background: Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyelopathy (MNGIE) is an autosomal recessive condition characterised by gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility, cachexia, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, demyelinating peripheral neuropathy and leucoencephalopathy. The genetic defect resides in the TYMP gene (previously ECGF1) encoding thymidine phosphorylase (TP) resulting in marked reduction of TP activity in all tissues. This results in marked increases in plasma thymidine (Thd) and deoxyuridine (Urd). The altered mitochondrial (Mt) nucleotide pool leads to mutations, depletion and deletions of MtDNA. It has been postulated that reductions in Thd and Urd levels could be therapeutic in MNGIE. It has been reported that allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) can correct the biochemical derangements in MNGIE. Patient: A 41-year-old woman presented at age 18 with anorexia and vomiting and developed ptosis and ophthalmoplegia 10 years later. Cerebral MRI revealed leucoencephalopathy and electromyography (EMG) was suggestive of a demyelinating neuropathy. MNGIE was confi rmed genetically by age 33. By age 40 she was wheelchair bound and despite long-term percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) feeding was signifi cantly underweight at 28.5kg (height 163cm; body mass index 10.7kg/m\u00b2) and a Karnofsky score of 40%. Methods: A peripheral blood SCT from an HLA-identical sister (with normal TP activity) was performed in September S185 2007. Conditioning consisted of 6.4mg/kg Busilvex, 150mg/m\u00b2 Fludarabine and 30mg Alemtuzumab with cyclosporin and 3day methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis. The CD34+ cell dose infused was 12.1x10 6 /kg. Results: Neutrophil and platelet engraftment was achieved by day +15. By day 25 her TP activity in white cells and platelets were within normal ranges and full donor chimerism was achieved by day 28. These levels have been sustained at 14 months post SCT. Complications included idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura successfully treated with Rituximab, GI haemorrhage managed conservatively and adenovirus infection. She has had no evidence of GHVD. Recent abdominal MRI shows persistent GI pseudo-obstruction but her oral intake has improved and her weight has increased to 32.3kg. Performance status, repeat EMG and cerebral MRI are unchanged. Conclusion: Allogeneic SCT can be delivered successfully to patients with MNGIE with sustained full donor chimerism and normal TP activity. Despite symptomatic improvement in the patient signifi cant physical improvement may take more time.",

Slatter (1) A 3 mth boy with diarrhoea and Parainfl uenza 3 respiratory infection was hypogammaglobulinaemic with CgC SCID due to IVS3-11bp C>G eleven bases into the CgC gene intron 3 splice acceptor site, in both patient and mother, who has non-random T lymphocyte X-inactivation. He developed hepatomegaly, pyrexia and erythematous axillary induration. Hepatosplenic lesions were present and a circumscribed lytic rib lesion on CT scan. Bone marrow examination revealed no lymphocytes or malignancy. Axillary nodule histology demonstrated granulomatous infi ltrate of large uni or binucleated cells containing prominent nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm confi rmed to be of T cell origin with some B cell infi ltrate, resembling Reed-Sternberg cells. Ki67 staining showed marked proliferative activity. There was no evidence of EBV. EMA and p80 markers were negative. Rib biopsy demonstrated extensive reactive small lymphocyte infi ltrate with pleomorphic blast-type large CD30+, leucocyte common antigen negative cells with large vesicular nuclei, suggestive of a Ki1+ lymphoma, described as a large cell anaplastic lymphoma or poorly differentiated Hodgkins lymphoma. He received 10/10 HLA MUD bone marrow infusion. On D+14 he had 422 T cells/ul and developed pneumonitis. He received one dose of vinblastine, methylprednisolone and anti-TNFa. He improved and is now well \u2265 aged 10 years. A 5 month child with PCP had a large soft tissue lesion on the left forehead, enlarging over 2 months. He was lymphopenic with hypogammaglobulinaemia. He had a c.676C>T mutation in the CgC gene. Initially neurologically normal, he became less alert, with abnormal eye movements. CSF protein was raised at 4.52g. The lesion showed bone erosion, thickened, infi ltrated dura, but no cerebral infi ltration, with a small extra-and larger intra-cranial component. Histology revealed pleomorphic spindle shaped cells surrounding a central area of necrosis with peripheral reactive lymphoid cells and foamy histiocytes with no osteoid production, diagnosed as malignant fi brous histiocytoma, storiform-pleomorphic variant. Chest CT showed bilateral infi ltrates. Despite 10/10 HLA matched maternal bone marrow infusion, he died on D+ 8 from pulmonary haemorrhage. Pulmonary and hepatic malignant fi brous histiocytoma were identifi ed at necroscopy. Immunodefi ciency-associated malignancy is usually secondary to EBV-associated B lymphocyte proliferation: these tumours were unusual and not previously reported in CgC SCID. Normal lymphocyte receptor generation requires functional proteins in the non-homologous end-joining pathway. DNA ligase IV (LIG4) and Cernunnos-XRCC4-like factor (C-XLF) are key components required for the ligation reaction that forms lymphocyte receptors, but are more widely required for DNA-double strand break repair. Defi ciency in these enzymes confers radiosensitivity and immunodefi ciency. Patients identifi ed with SCID or combined immunodefi ciencies due to LIG4 or C-XLF defi ciency are increasingly being identifi ed and offered HSCT. Many of the conditioning regimens damage DNA and patients with these disorders die from conditioning toxicity; less toxic regimens are required to successfully treat these patients. We report 2 patients successfully treated using a modifi ed Fanconi anaemia protocol. Patient 1 presented with microcephaly, developmental delay, severe lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinaemia, recurrent respiratory and CMV vireamia. He had a homozygous C-XLF mutation (c.169C>T, p.R57X). She underwent 9/10 (Amm) HLA-mis-matched URD HSCT after conditioning with Flu 150mgm2/Cy20mg/kg and C-1H 1mg/kg, aged 3.5 years. CSA and MMF were used as GvHD prophylaxis. Initial donor chimerism was 25%, but by 2 months post HSCT was 100%. The transplant course was complicated by grade 2 lichenoid skin GvHD and CMV reactivation. There was no conditioning-related toxicity and immunoreconstitution at 4 months is good although follow up is short. Patient 2 presented with failure to thrive, persistent diarrhoea, recurrent resoiratory infection and severe lymphopenia with hypogammaglobulinaemia. She had 2 heomozygous LIG4 mutations (p.A3V, p.R278H). She underwent a 9/10 (Amm) HLA mis-matched parental HSCT after conditioning with Flu 150mgm2/Cy20mg/ kg and C-1H 1mg/kg, aged 4.5 years. CSA and MMF were used as GvHD prophylaxis. Initial donor chimerism was 12%, but by 6 weeks post HSCT was 100% T cell and 85% myeloid. The transplant course was complicated by CMV reactivation. There was no conditioning-related toxicity. Longer follow up is required to demonstrate long term immunoreconstitution. These cases, in addition to our previously patient transplanted with Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome1, demonstrate safety and effi cacy of this conditioning protocol. Long term studies will be required to assess the longer term outcome. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS) and the adrenal cortex. It is caused by mutations of the ABCD1 gene, that result in an accumulation of saturated very long chain fatty acids in all tissues. ALD presents with two main phenotypes: the childhood cerebral form with onset between 5-7 years that leads rapidly to demise of the CNS and ends in dementia then death; the adult form, called adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), with onset between 20-40 years, characterized by progressive spastic paraparesis with chronic course. However 35% of patients with AMN may develop a cerebral demyelinating disease whose evolution is similar to the childhood form. Paediatric series show that haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is effective in early symptomatic boys with cerebral ALD, by restoring partial enzymatic activity. We report for the fi rst time 3 cases of HSCT performed in adult patients (15 to 28 years). All three had infl ammatory cerebral demyelination that developed after AMN. One had only electrophysiological signs of AMN without clinical symptoms. Two patients received myeloablative conditioning regimen including busulfan, cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin and one a reduced intensity conditioning regiment (RIC) aimed at decreasing neurological toxicity (clofarabine 40 mg/ m 2 , alemtuzumab, busulfan 4 mg/kg, and melphalan 140 mg/ kg). The source of the graft was bone marrow (one from an match unrelated donor and one from a sibling donor) and a cord blood for the patient receiving a RIC. The latter patient died because of infectious complications after engraftment failure. The 2 remaining patients developed a grade 1 and grade 2 acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and no chronic GVHD. As seen in transplanted ALD boys, cerebral demyelination progressed during the fi rst 18 months after HCT then stabilized during the following 5 years after HCT in strictly normal cognitive function in one patient and moderate visuo-spatial defi cit in the second. Spastic paraparesis deteriorated however signifi cantly during the conditioning regimen in the second patient and then stabilized. In ALD adult patients, HSCT seems as effective as in children to stop demyelination but with a risk of aggravation of the myelopathy. Progresses have to be made to determine a less neurotoxical conditioning regimen.",

Yesilipek Akdeniz University (Antalya, TR) Griscelli syndrome (GS) is rare genetic disorder characterized by partial albinism, neurological manifestations and immunodefi ciency. In most patients with immunodefi ciency accelerated phase known as hemophagocytic lymophohistiocytosis (HLH) develop. Allogenic transplantation (HSCT) in early period is the only curative treatment modality. We describe here two cases with GS cured with unrelated cord blood (UCB) transplantation. Case 1:3,5 months old boy diagnosed as GS and HLH was treated according HLH-2004 protocol and at 2 years of age he had transplantation from UCB after receiving conditioning consisted of Bu,Eto and CYM. GVHD prophylaxis was consisted of cyclosporine. The infused NC was 12,6X107/kg. Neutrophil engraftment occured at 33th day after transplantation. He developed intestinal GVHD treated with steroid, tacrolimus and MMF.16 months after transplant autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA) developed that was treated with steroid and MMF.19 monthts after HSCT, the patient is well, is not receiving any immunsupression and AHA recovered. Case 2:18 months old with GS and HLH had transplantation from UCB. The conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis was same as other patients'. NC count was 10,5X10 7 /kg. Neutrophil engraftment occured at posttransplant day 22.At 25th day, AHA developed. Improvement could not be achieved by steroid and plasmaphresis. Finally rituximab was used and AHA recovered. 2 years after transplant, the child is well. Discussion: Allo-HSCT is the only curative treatment for GS. If family donor is not avaliable, unrelated donor should be searched. Although papers indicating successfull treatment of GS with unrelated HSCT is available in the literature, the experience is very limited and for all we know transplantation with UCB has not been published yet. The cases described here are the fi rst published GS cases treated successfully with UCB transplantation. Besides this, developing of AHA at postransplant period in both cases are remarkable. It has been suggested in the literature that immunsupressive therapy given in posttransplant period can create immun dysregulation and this may lead to autoimmune cytopenias. In patients with immune dysregulation like Griselli syndrome or HLH, the risk may be higher and it may be benefi cial to follow up these patients during posttransplantation period in respect to AHA. The role of CB transplantation in treatment and whether having CB transplantation increase the risk for AHAin this group of patients should be evaluated in larger series.",

Parents were related and came from North Africa; both their previous children died in the fi rst two years of a severe respiratory distress. The latter performed immunological evaluation before dying, showing a low lymphocytes DR+ count. Cordocentesis performed during Sabrine pregnancy showed lymphocyte DR+ absence, while molecular studies demonstrated homozygotic mutation of CIITA gene (IVS13+1g>a). The deliver was uneventful and at birth Sabrine went in isolation under Laminar Air Flow. At fi rst clinical examination the child was eupnoic with normal cardio-respiratory activity. WBC were 12.080/mm 3 (L 9340/ mm 3 ), Hb 10.6 gr/dl, PLT 375.000/mm 3 . Lymphocyte phenotype showed normal CD19 and CD3 level (low TCD4 and high TCD8) and absent DR+ cells. Genetic diagnosis was confi rmed and the research for a Matched Unrelated Donor (MUD) was started, not being available a HLA-identical sibling. Owing the absence of a MUD, the option of a haploidentical Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) was therefore considered. Experiences in other centers showed an elevated risk of Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) following this procedure, probably due to an incorrect negative/positive intrathymic selection of TCD4. To avoid this, the infusion of maternal T depleted CD34 infusion (19.1 x 10 6 /kg), was followed, after 2 wks, by three infusion of immature donor dendritic cells (10 x 10 6 /kg), who could eventually migrate in the thymus to perform T cell selection.",

However, relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains a major concern. Single cases reported about successful donor-lymphocyte infusion (DLI) for relapsed patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and provided evidence of a graft-versus-myelofi brosis effect. We investigated the effect of escalating donorlymphocyte infusion (DLI) in 17 patients with myelofi brosis who had clinical relapse (salvage-DLI, n=9) or molecular relapse or molecular residual disease (pre-emptive DLI, n=8) after dose-reduced allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Molecular disease was monitored by highly sensitive JAK2-V617F-PCR. Thirty-fi ve DLIs from related (n=5) or unrelated donors (n=12) were given with a median dose of 1x10 6 for the fi rst and 5 x 10 6 CD3+cells/kg for the second DLI. The complete molecular response rate was 68%, and signifi cantly higher for patients who received DLI for molecular than for clinical relapse (100% vs. 44%) (p=0.04). In comparison to molecular relapse, clinical relapse required more donor-lymphocyte infusions (two vs. one) and was associated with a higher incidence of acute GvHD (22% vs. 0%). From the Patients in the salvage group achieved 4 a complete molecular remission and 2 of them had developed an acute GvHD (grade III). In non-responders of the salvage group was no GvHD documented. This provid evidence for a strong donor-T-cell-mediated graft-versus-myelofibrosis effect. Molecular monitoring with highly sensitive PCR for JAK2-V617F-mutation to detect residual disease and to guide adoptive immunotherapy seems to be more effi cient and less toxic than using donor-lymphocyte infusion for clinical relapse and should be implemented in further clinical trials.",

            "text": "Human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are currently tested in a growing number of clinical trials to determine their safety and effi ciency for immune modulation and regenerative therapy. Repeated observations of genomic instability in commonly used fetal bovine serum (FBS)-driven MSC cultures and consecutive tumor formation by transformed MSCs in experimental animals have raised serious safety concerns. We and others have recently established animal serum-free clinical scale MSC expansion protocols with pooled human platelet lysate (pHPL) as a substitute for FBS. This study was performed to determine the genomic stability of MSCs expanded under humanized conditions ex vivo. Small volume (14-17mL) bone marrow aspirates of 4 donors (3 male; age: 30, 36, and 47 years; 1 female; age 13 years) were seeded without manipulation directly in pHPL and Lglutamine supplemented minimum essential medium. Serial limited dilutions were performed to analyze the frequency of colony-forming MSCs within marrow samples. Colonies consisting of more than 50 cells were defi ned as colony forming unit-fi broblasts (CFU-F) and were counted after staining. Clinical-scale expanded MSCs were harvested directly after primary culture. Population doublings were calculated based on primary CFU-F frequency. Array-CGH was carried out using a whole genome oligonucleotide microarray platform with female reference DNA. Samples were labeled and scanned images were analyzed using CGH Analytics software. We found a strong inverse correlation between the MNC seeding density and the recovery of CFU-F indicating a profoundly higher frequency of colony-forming MSCs in BM aspirates than previously described (app. 1/1,000 BM-MNCs). Genomic analysis after large scale expansion revealed balanced profi les for all propagated MSC products despite 5 copy number variations (CNVs; >60kb) that were not documented in the database of genomic variants. Several small (7kb-1.8Mb; n=33) autosomal CNVs were observed in normal individuals and were not associated with phenotype changes. Our data support the notion that despite high proliferation rate MSCs propagated without FBS are genomically stable in array-CGH. This extends earlier results showing that MSCs expanded under humanized conditions did not form tumors in experimental animals in vivo and indicates superior safety of the rapidly available humanized MSC transplants compared to currently utilized FBS-expanded MSCs.",

No treatment has changed the natural history of the disease. Intraspinal injections of bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) have been able to ameliorate the course of ALS in murine models. We have designed a phase I/II clinical trial to check the feasibility of this approach in humans. Methods: The intended recruitment was 11 patients. Inclusion criteria required a medullar onset of the disease, a forced vital capacity (FVC) >50% and T90 < 2%. Sixty mL of bone marrow were harvested under sedation. A fi coll procedure was performed. MNC were resuspended in 2 mL of saline. After laminectomy, the MNC were infused through a spinal needle 10 and 6 mm deep in the posterior tract of T3-T4 under electrophysiological surveillance. This level was chosen aiming the preservation of the lower intercostals function as a mean to stop the deterioration of the FVC. Patients were followed for 6 months before the infusion, to establish the individual evolution of the disease, and every three months for 1 year after the procedure. Results: Seven patients have been infused so far. Median time from diagnosis to cellular infusion was 20 months. We infused a total of 402 x10 6 (240-602.8) MNC, including 3.16 x10 6 (0.96-10.25) CD34+ cells. After 9 months of follow-up, assessment of the FVC's evolution and the score points of the international ALS-FRS, Norris and MRC scales, revealed that of two rapidly evolving patients, one achieved stabilization of the progression and one was unaffected by the intervention. Five patients whose disease evolved more slowly also achieved stabilization of the functional scales or maintained basal FVC values. Serial MRI studies did not show any spinal cord damage. There were two severe adverse reactions (AE): 1 syncope secondary to constipation, and 1 high tract respiratory infection. AEs of WHO grade 1 or 2 and less than 2 months of duration were: constipation, intercostal pain, CSF hypotension and lower limbs paresthesias (1 of them persistent). After 9 months of follow-up, all patients had asymptomatic abolition of the somato-sensorial potentials of the posterior tract. Conclusions: The procedure was safe and feasible. No major complications or signifi cant morbility were observed. Stabilization of the disease was achieved in 6 of the fi rst 7 patients included in the protocol. (1) Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are increasingly used to treat refractory graft-versus-host-disease and other complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We evaluated immunogenicity of HLA-mismatched MSC infused post-transplant to SCT recipients. Recipient lymphocyte response to MSC and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from the MSC or third party donors was measured before and after infusion. In vitro primary and rechallenge lymphocyte responses of healthy individuals to MSC and to PBL from the MSC donor were similarly studied. SCT recipients given MSC responded to third party allostimuli, but showed no response to infused MSC before and up to 6 months after infusion, while maintaining an alloresponse to the MSC donor. This indicates immune unresponsiveness was restricted to MSC, since the SCT recipient was not tolerized to the MSC donor. In vitro we confi rmed that MSC failed to prime responder lymphocytes to rechallenge with PBL from the MSC donor, and lymphocytes primed with MSC donor PBL and rechallenged with MSC only showed weak responses at high stimulator-responder ratios. Although MSC upregulated lymphocyte gene expression of CD25, IFN-g, FoxP3, CTLA-4 and IL-10, they failed in both unprimed and primed responders to induce CD25+ (activated) or CD57+ (effector) CD4+ or CD8+ subsets and only inconsistently induced FoxP3+ regulatory T lymphocytes. These results show for the fi rst time in vivo that infused MSC are only weakly immunogenic and validate the clinical use of MSC from HLAmismatched donors.",

This study compares mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) and vascular endothelial colony-forming cell (ECFC) contribution to niche functions in a novel humanized co-culture system. Autologous MSC-ECFC pairs were established as stromal stimulators under animal protein-free conditions. Purifi ed CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) were used as responders in a cytokine-driven (IL-3/Flt-3-L/SCF) compared to external cytokine-free niche cell-regulated HPC co-culture. Serum-free conditions were compared with humanized cultures supplemented with pooled human platelet lysate (pHPL) as a source of human growth factors present within the niche. Primary expansion culture with and w/o niche cell support was followed by colony-forming cell (CFC) assays to determine maintenance of clonogenicity. Humanized liquid cultures supplemented with 10% pHPL were more effi cient than parallel serum-free cultures under three of four medium conditions resulting in total nucleated cell and CFC increase. Both MSCs and ECFCs further amplifi ed HPC proliferation. In the absence of external cytokines the MSC/ECFC combination was the most effi cient in amplifying HPC (mean 180-fold). MSCs were more effi cient than ECFCs in expanding HPCs and CFCs under all other conditions tested. The addition of external cytokines amplifi ed the HPC proliferation (500-fold) and CFC expansion (30-fold) but abrogated the additive effect of MSCs plus ECFCs. The stromal effect was more pronounced in pHPL-supplemented compared to serum-free cultures, indicating a peculiar role of natural platelet-derived growth factors in this process. We demonstrate for the fi rst time that HPC expansion can be modulated in a fully humanized co-culture system based on the use of pHPL as a natural source of human platelet-derived growth factors. Our data indicates that the combination of MSCs + ECFCs is at least as effi cient in supporting HPC proliferation and CFC amplifi cation as either niche cell compartment alone. We speculate that human platelet-derived factors may avoid premature HSC exhaustion in this system. The humanized co-culture thus provides a novel model system for subtractive analyses of HPC and SC-niche cell interactions. It also builds the basis for further developments towards more effective animal serum-free HSC expansion strategies.",

The CXCR4 antagonist Plerixafor\u2122 has been used on a compassionate basis with G-CSF alone to augment progenitor yields where mobilization has previously failed. However, the aim of this study is to identify a target group of patients in which we can utilize the short-term action of this drug to evaluate intervention during standard chemotherapy/G-CSF mobilization procedures for those who fail or are at high risk of apheresis harvest failure. This could reduce the need for remobilization and avoid its associated treatment delays and expense. Between January 2003 and 1st September 2008, 594 patients with lymphoproliferative disease received mobilizing chemotherapy regimens and G-CSF for the fi rst time. Of these patients, 26 were not harvested due to sepsis and disease complications and were excluded from analysis. A further 27 patients were not apheresed as the peripheral blood CD34+ cell count did not rise above 10/ul and these were classifi ed as mobilization failure. The overall failure rate to achieve a total apheresis CD34+ cell dose of 2x10 6 /kg by diagnostic group at the fi rst attempt was as follows; Hodgkin Disease 11/85(13%), NHL(high grade) 34/178(19%), NHL(low grade) 21/91(23%) and Myeloma 32/214(15%). The harvest outcome fl owchart and failure to achieve the target CD34+ cell dose for the 568 evaluable patients is summarised in fi gure 1. Notably, of the 88 patients who had a poor fi rst apheresis CD34 yield of <1x10 6 /kg, 72/88(82%) failed to collect a total CD34 cell dose of 2x10 6 /kg in two days of apheresis and 55 of the 88(63%) failed in up to three harvest days. The ideal starting point to evaluate the impact of Plerixafor\u2122 therefore is in those patients who fail to achieve a blood CD34+ cell count of 10/ul and where the fi rst apheresis harvest CD34+ cell dose is <1x10 6 /kg. The myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and its related conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia with trineage dysplasia (TLD-AML) and treatment-related myelodysplasia/acute leukaemia (t-MDS/t-AML) usually carry a poor prognosis after conventional chemotherapy. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) may offer the chance of cure for adult patients (pts) with this diagnoses (dg.). We retrospective analyzed a cohort of pts transplanted at our department for high risk AML/MDS. Materials and methods: 50 pts with dg. TLD-AML (32 pts, 65%; 9 pts with prior MDS and 23 pts with de novo AML), t-AML (7 pts, 14%), MDS (7 pts, 14%) and t-MDS (4 pts, 8%) underwent 51 allogeneic SCT at our institution between the years 2003 -2008. The median age in whole group was 53 years (range 24-68 years). 2 pts (4%) had favorable cytogenetics, 33 pts (66%) intermediate and 16 pts (32%) poor cytogenetic prognosis. 20 pts (40%) were transplanted with related donors, 30 pts (60%) with unrelated donors. 17 pts (34%) have undergone myeloablative conditioning (Bu/Cy/\u00b1ATG) and 33 pts (66%) reduced intensity conditioning (FAMP/Mel). Posttransplant graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis included cyclosporine and \"short\" methotrexate in all pts. Results: 26 pts (52%) alive in complete remission and complete chimerism with the median of follow-up 15 months (1-63 months) and the probability of 2-years overal survival (OS) 46% (42% related and 49% unrelated, p=0,6552). 24 pts (48%) died with the median of 6 months (1-50 months). The nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at day 100 was 14% (6% related and 8% unrelated), NRM at 1 year was 24% (6% related and 18% unrelated). 10 pts (20%) -7 (14%) related and 3 (6%) unrelated, p=0,0673 -relapsed after SCT with the median of relapse 5 months (3-48 months) and with 2-years disease free survival (DFS) probability of 47% (43% related and 50% unrelated, p=0,5116). Discussion: our data indicate, that allogeneic SCT is an effective treatment option for pts with high risk AML and MDS. Comparing the group of pts transplanted with related and unrelated donor no statistical signifi cant difference in OS and DFS were found. However, our results suggest better overall survival, disease free survival and lower relapse rate for patients after unrelated SCT due to supposed GVL effect.",

Imatinib mesylate enables selective, dual inhibition of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) pathways. Recently, the drug's effects on fi broblasts have been reported. Inhibiting fi broblast growth (and thus decreasing collagen production in dermal fi broblasts) is thus a logical therapeutic approach. Here, we report on our experience with 12 patients who received imatinib mesylate for refractory sclerodermatous cGVHD following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). The patients' characteristics were as follows: median age, 35 years (range: 15-59); 7 male recipients, 6 female donors; 4 cases of CML, 4 MDS, 2 ALL and 2 Hodgkin's lymphoma. The patients had received either myelo-ablative conditioning with standard GVHD prophylaxis based on cyclosporine and short-course MTX (n=9) or nonmyelo-ablative conditioning with cyclosporine and MMF. Seven patients received a marrow graft and 5 received a peripheral blood graft. All displayed refractory, chronic, sclerodermatous GHVD with at least 3 lines (range 3-6) of prior immunosuppressive therapy. The modifi ed Rodnan skin score was used to assess the extent of skin damage. Glivec was initiated at a dose of 400 mg/day between 16 and 119 months post-transplantation (median: 44). Despite an imatinib dose reduction and the administration of various symptomatic treatments, 4 patients (33%) had to discontinue their treatment soon after its initiation (range: 16-64 days) because of intolerance (especially muscle cramps) and were not evaluable in terms of the effi cacy criterion. Other side effects reported were parenthesis, diarrhea and edema. In the remaining patients, the scleroderma symptoms improved within three months of treatment initiation. At the time of this report, all patients were alive and those who tolerated imatinib mesylate have experienced a complete or near-complete response (n=4) or partial response (n=4). All responders (except for one who discontinued the drug 157 days after initiation, due to cramps) were still on the treatment, after a median time period of 216 days (range: 80-2053). This retrospective report shows that when imatinib mesylate is well tolerated, it is effective in patients with refractory sclerodermatous cGVHD and is thus a promising candidate for the treatment of this complication.",

The ex-vivo enriched non-mobilized PBMNCs were tested by FACS analysis of specifi c cell surface markers and by functional analysis of differentiation. Non mobilized PBMNCs obtained from consenting healthy donors (n=18) cultured for 7 days in a defi ned cytokine cocktail media were analyzed by FACS and tested for their differentiation capacity into hematopoietic, endothelial and mesenchymal cells lineages compared to non-manipulated PBMNCs. We found that enriched PBMNCs resulted in two distinct subpopulations, adherent and non adherent, that present different cell surface markers and have different differentiation capacities. Cell surface markers analysis showed that adherent cells possess high percentage of CD14 (28.1\u00b16.13), CD90 (4.24\u00b10.94), CD105 (42.19\u00b18.42), CD117 (9.89\u00b15.99) expression and reduction of CD45 (46.3\u00b18.14), CD31 (5.9\u00b11.9) and CD34 (0.18\u00b10.03) compare to non-manipulated PBMNCs.

            "text": "There is considerable evidence that mechanical stimuli affect gene expression in a range of differentiated cell types and simulation systems to re-cellularise tissues in vitro in a functional manner. Based on this principle, the approach taken on this study was to construct a 3D scaffold from Collagen/Alginate Gel and reseed it with autologous human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro. The main aim was to determine whether the cells would proliferate in the scaffolds and determine if they remain viable over prolonged culture periods and retain their undifferentiated phenotype. Collagen type I (2.8% w/v) was extracted from rat tails and purifi ed, then cast into gels of 1.5 mm thickness in 24-well-plates. The gels were then freeze-dried and D7-FIB+ MSCs were delivered onto the sponges by mixing. Optimisation of the 3D cell culture techniques in collagen sponges/alginate gels was achieved and 3D collagen/ alginate composites were seeded with hMSCs. Cell proliferation was assessed using the ATPlite assay and the cell viability was assessed using the live/dead cell assay upon serial sections of seeded scaffolds at different depths. Results demonstrated that the scaffolds supported the growth of MSCs over the extensive period (60 days) of culture. Histological evaluation demonstrated that cells attached on the collagen fi bers and spread within the pores. Finally, potential changes in the phenotype of hMSCs within the 2.8% (w/v) collagen/alginate scaffolds were determined by immunostaining of HLA-DR, CD-117, CD-45, CD-34, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, D7-FIB, CD-90, CD-13 and CD-105 by the immunoperoxidase method. Results demonstrated that hMSCs were positively stained only for CD-90, D7-FIB, CD-13 and CD-105 indicating that the cells retained their undifferentiated state during the prolonged period of 3D culture. In conclusion, MSCs are an attractive source for tissue engineering applications due to their ease of isolation proliferation and multilineage differentiation ability. A promising approach in the tissue engineering fi eld might be the cellularisation of tissue scaffolds using in vitro repopulation with autologous hMSCs S191 coupled with physically appropriate conditioning prior to implantation. Therefore, in future the basic principle will be seeding of cells onto a matrix scaffold and use of physically interactive bioreactors for the functional differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells within 3-dimensional scaffolds in vitro. Suicide gene, herpes virus thymidine kinase gene (hsv-tk), modifi ed donor T lymphocyte infusion (TK-DLI) is one of the promising approach to high risk leukemia patients who are going to have T cell depleted haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (1) . Despite that success of the T lymphocyte based gene therapy in haplo SCT setting to reduce relapse unrelated mortality with control of graft-versus-host disease is becoming clear, there remains some diffi culties to be solved for inducing remission to patients with relapsed leukemia after SCT. The solutions would be 1) very early detection of leukemia relapse and enough reduction of leukemia burden before TK-DLI, 2) making a \"niche\", space for lymphocytes, for TK-T lymphocytes, and 3) maintaining T lymphocytes to have potentials of proliferation and survival such as naive and central memory T cells. A phase I/II clinical trial of TK-DLI have been performed in the Tsukuba University Hospital to 5 patients (2 AML, 2 ALL, and 1 MDS) since 2002. Actually our fi ve patients for relapsed leukemia had one or more diffi cult points as listed above, and it results only temporal and insuffi cient clinical response in 4 of 5 patients. Different from the other patients in treatment failure, only one MDS patient survives more than 3 years after TK-DLI without any sign of relapse. He was in hematological remission at the time of TK-DLI and had been in immunosuppressive status of 6 month after SCT, suggests that he had been in ideal clinical conditions for TK-DLI. But TK-T cells disappeared within 4 month after TK-DLI same as the other patient, suggests TK-T cells lacked potentials of proliferation and survival in a patient. According to the result, we optimized clinical and manipulation protocols. They include 1) detection of molecular relapse and perform a TK-DLI at the level, 2) addition of lympho-depletion conditioning with Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide before TK-DLI, and 3) usage of CD3/CD28 stimulation + low dose IL-2, instead of OKT3 + high concentrated IL-2, to obtain suicide gene transduced central memory TK-T cells (2, 3) . Clinical outcome of fi ve TK-DLI patients and result of protocol modifi cation will be discussed in the meeting. So far the question whether age has a negative impact on peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization in healthy donors remains controversial. We retrospectively evaluated 129 consecutive related adult donors who underwent PBSC mobilization and collection at the Institut Paoli-Calmettes (Marseille, France) between January 2005 and December 2007.",

All donors received 4-5 days of G-CSF given once daily in the evening, with the fi rst leukapheresis initiated on the morning of day 5. Although the recommended dose for rhG-CSF is 10 \u00b5g/kg/day for stem cell mobilization, most donors received a total dose of rhG-CSF that was rounded to the lowest multiple of 300 \u00b5g, thus allowing the daily use of a whole number of vials: as a consequence, the median received dose/ kg of rhG-CSF was 8.9 \u00b5g, which may contribute to the lower number of circulating CD34+ cells observed in our cohort of patients (59.5/\u00b5L). In order to identify factors affecting circulating CD34+ cell counts as a surrogate maker for stem cell mobilization, we fi rst performed a univariate analysis, including age, gender, weight, height, total G-CSF dose and G-CSF dose per kg. Ethnicity was not tested as an explanatory factors for stem cell mobilization, because our cohort of donors was smaller and more homogeneous, mostly with individuals of Caucasian ascent Variables associated with higher post-G-CSF CD34+ cell counts were donor weight (p=0.0026) and the total dose of G-CSF received (p<0.001), thus reproducing recently published results. By multivariate analysis, only the total dose of G-CSF received remained signifi cant (p=5.49*105). Interestingly, our group of recent donors was heterogeneous in terms of age, and therefore might accurately refl ects current practices in allogeneic transplantation from related donors. It is important to stress that age did not signifi cantly infl uence CD34+ cell counts (p=0.3441). When looking at subgroups according to age, no signifi cant difference was found between the mobilization procedure and endpoints for \"elderly donors\" (age \u2265 55, n=44, of which 10 were older than 70 years) as compared to \"younger donors\" (age <55, n=85). Our results suggest that the absence of deleterious effect of older age on progenitor cell mobilization is important to consider in view of the increasing use of older donors, in the context of RIC allo-SCT. Objectives: To evaluate effects on re-epithelialization of amniotic membrane (AM) as a wound dressing in patients with chronic traumatic ulcers. Material and methods: Amniotic membrane processing Term placentas from healthy donor mothers were obtained from uncomplicated cesarean section after informed consent. Under sterile conditions, AM was mechanically peeled from chorion, washed with PBS and stored at -196 \u00baC. After thawing, segments were washed with PBS and used as dressing in posttraumatic wounds. Bacteriology tests and quality controls for maternal infectious markers (syphilis, HBV, HCV, HIV, and S192 HTLV on cesarean day and after a quarantine period of 90 days were performed. Case report 1: A 49 year old woman presented with generalized polytrauma and a wound of 17x15 cm in the right tight. Three weeks later the wound had failed to heal and an infection with Acinetobacter baumanii was documented. Wound was debridated, treated with antibiotics and vacuum therapy. No epithelialization was observed sixty days later. Wound bed was dressed with AM fragments. Ulcer evaluation was performed every 3 -4 days until complete healing. Case report 2: A 76 old year lady suffered a crush trauma in the gemelar area of the right leg. She developed local infl ammatory signs and the evolution was not satisfactory. One month later, an ulcer of 17 x 10 cm affecting soft tissues and muscles appeared. The wound was debrided and subjected to vacuum therapy. Forty fi ve days later there was no epithelialization. As previously described, wound was completely dressed with AM fragments and covered with the vacuum device. Results: Effect of AM on reepithelialization in massive wounds. Case report 1: After eight days AM was adhered to ulcer bed and re-epithelialization from the ulcer margins had started. Wound size gradually reduced and wound re-epithelialization was successfully established by the day +193. Case report 2: Eight days after AM application some re-epithelialization from the edges was observed. Even though epithelialization developed appropriately for the following 6 months, a second application of AM was decided and 2 months later the wound completely healed. Histopatological evaluation of induced newly formed skin, showed a normal histological skin structure without glands and hair. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that healing of extensive and chronic wounds may improve remarkably after treatment with amnion, resulting in total re-epithelialization of the ulcers. ASCT has been a reasonable therapeutic option in patients with AML non-candidates to allogeneic transplantation. The aim of our study has been to analyse the infl uence of different characteristics in long-term outcome of patients diagnosed with AML who undergone an ASCT. We have analysed 36 patients (18 male) following ASCT between September 1996 and January 2008. Patient characteristics are described in table 1. Median follow-up was 11 months (range 0-140 mo). All patients received G-CSF for mobilization and peripheral blood stem cells were infused with a median of 2.77\u00b110 6 /kg CD34 cells (range 1.02-13.42). Conditioning regimen was Busulphan-Cyclophosphamide. ASCT was performed in CR in 88.9% patients with median of 3 months (range 1-6 mo) from last chemotherapy and 6 months (range 3-16 mo) from diagnosis. The actual 12-year relapse probability was 27.8%, event-free survival 41.7% and overall survival 44.4%. Relapse occurred with median of 6.5 months from transplantation (range 2-19 mo) and 90% of them died with median of three months (range 0-11 mo). A total of twenty patients have died (55.6%) with median of 7 months (range 0-21 mo) after ASCT. We have analysed the infl uence of sex, age, AML subtype, cytogenetic abnormalities, WBC at diagnosis, chemotherapy courses before ASCT and time between diagnosis/last chemotherapy and transplantation on relapse risk and survival. Unfavourable cytogenetic, hyperleukocytosis and M5 subtype were associated with poor outcome and early mortality. A signifi cant correlation between mortality and number of chemotherapy courses was evidenced (p<0.02). Our results suggest that ASCT could be an effective treatment in AML patients non-candidates to allotransplant, especially in absence of risk factors as unfavourable cytogenetic, initial hyperleukocytosis, need of \u22653courses of chemotherapy or M5 subtype.",

Isolation and culture of bmMSCs: The adult bmMSCs were isolated from adult human bone marrow obtained by direct aspirations of ileac crest. The cells were plated out in culture and they were incubated at standard conditions. Isolation and culture of osteoblasts (OB): The OBs used as control were obtained by the method of enzymatic digestion. Behavior of bmMSCs on 55S glass ceramic: The behavior of isolated bmMSCs on the glass ceramic, two series of 96-well plates were seeded, with GM and OM. Then 10 x 10 3 cells were seeded. At 24 hours, 7, 15, 21 and 27 days cell adherence and growth were analyzed. Statistical analysis: A variance analysis (ANOVA) was carried out with a minimal signifi cance of p<0.05. Results: The 55S glass ceramic was an excellent substrate for the osteoblastic differentiation of the bmMSC as assessed by the increment in the production of osteocalcin and phosphatase alkaline and the reduction in the CD90 expression. Adhesion and proliferation of the cells on the substrate was observed by scanning electron microscopy as well as their ability to produce calcifi ed bone extracellular matrix. Conclusions: The results obtained allow us to assert that the 55S glass ceramic provides the adequate microenviroment to support the adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of the Background: Thrombotic microangiopathy (TAM) post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has an incidence of 4-13%, and is a life-threatening complication with a mortality rate of approximately 60%. Clinical manifestations include severe thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolysis, and frequent renal dysfunction with neurological complications. The reported risk factors of TAM include: female gender, total body irradiation, lymphoid malignancy, unrelated or mismatched donor, calcineurin inhibitors, presence of infection and graftversus-host disease (GvHD). There is no consensus for treatment of post-transplantation TAM. Description: A 9-year-old girl with severe refractory aplastic anemia received an unrelated HSCT (9/10) with HLA-Cw mismatch. The conditioning regimen included fl udarabine 150 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg and ATG. Cyclosporine (CSA) was administered to prevent GvHD. The graft was T-cell depleted with Campath-1H in vitro and followed by an addback of CD3+ cells of 5x106/kg on day+1. On day+2 she developed a Coomb's negative anemia, with schistocytes, elevated LDH, thrombocytopenia together with an acute renal failure. ADAMTS 13 antibody was negative. The renal biopsy confi rmed TAM. She then developed a grade III intestinal GvHD. The TAM was treated with plasma exchange, basiliximab, anti-TNF, heparin, and defi brotide. CSA was replaced with methylprednisolone/ tacrolimus, then with methylprednisolone/sirolimus and steroids only. None of these drugs decreased TAM intensity. The patient clinical status further worsened with CMV, HHV-6 reactivation, cardiac and pleural effusions. Considering TAM as a form of GvHD, allogenic fully mismatched third pary mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) were infused (2.22x106/kg). Two weeks later, the biological parameters went back to normal without any need of thrombocyte transfusion (fi gure 1, 2). Renal biopsy still showed TAM with global interstitial fi brosis. The biological signs of TAM reappeared 10 weeks after MSC infusion, associated with viral reactivation, pleural and cardiac effusions. The pulmonary biopsy showed medium-sized artery thrombosis, but no signs of pulmonary TAM. The issue ultimately proved to be fatal. Conclusion: This case illustrates a possible, benefi t of allogenic MSC infusion for the treatment of TAM. The timing of administration, the quantity and the number of doses is not defi ned yet. Further studies need to be done in order to confi rm this fi nding. Background: Nephrotoxicity derived from Cyclosporin treatment is a well known complication and for this reason drug level baseline is usually monitored (before morning oral intake). Recently, data in the literature demonstrated a higher reliability of drug serum level after 2 hours from oral intake as regards to absorption and needed doses in the specifi c patient. These reports are obtained among Solid Organ Transplant settings. Aim: To assess if cyclosporin blood level at 2 h from oral intake is a more reliable tool than the pre-intake level to prevent or reduce nephrotoxicity in Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation (HSCT)and Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA) patients, and to tailor the required dose in each patient. Materials and methods: Patients. From February to November 2008 we prospectively enrolled 11 patients post HSCT and 4 under Immunosuppressive treatment (IS) for SAA. We monitored serum level of cyclosporin at time 0 and after 2 hours from oral intake, creatinine and urea serum levels, drug toxicity, and Graft versus host disease (GvHD) in HSCT group. Oral dose was then modifi ed according to the 2 hours post cyclosporin results. Results: The incidence of hypercreatininemia, renal failure, hypomagnesiemia, headache and tremors was trivial and drug withdrawal was very seldom required. Creatinine serum level was \u2265 1.5 in 3 patients (20%). Only 2 out of 15 patients (13%) needed cyclosporine withdrawal: one for renal toxicity, the other one for trombotic trombocitopenic purpura; both of them were in HSCT group. Other side effects (headache and tremors) were evident only in 2 (13%) patients, one with SAA, the other one in HSCT S194 group. Cyclosporin level after 2 hours seemed to be independent from the dosage/Kg of body weight, especially in children. In 7 out of 11 HSCT patients (63%) acute GvHD (grade I-II) was evident whereas limited chronic GvHD in 4 out of 11 patients (36%) was found. Both SAA and HSCT patients tolerated cyclosporin with 2 hour level monitoring very well, with apparent less toxicity. The two patients requiring cyclosporin withdrawal were both in the HSCT group. Conclusions: Our data suggest that dose adjustment of cyclosporin according to 2-hour level is more accurate than the basal one and more effective to prevent toxicity and side effects. Furthermore, it also provides a better compliance. The scarce number of patients doesn't allow to draw defi nite and fi rm conclusions, prompting the need to further prospective studies.",

            "text": "Background: CIK cells are naturally occurring cytotoxic cells active against a variety of leukemia and lymphoma targets and with low or absent activity against normal BM stem cells. These cells can be easily expanded in vitro under adherence to GMP conditions and safely used after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Case report: A female patient with a diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (2000) was sequentially treated with steroids, Cyclosporine and PUVA therapy for 2 years. In 2002 she received chemotherapy program VAPEC-B and in 2003, she underwent a Bone Marrow stem cell allogeneic transplantation (TNC 2.8x10 8 /kg,CD34+ cells 6x10 6 cells/kg and CD3+ cells 34x10 6 /kg).The conditioning regimen was based on Melphalan,Alemtuzumab,Fludarabine and TBI. From June 2003, for progression to large T cell lymphoma of the skin, she was treated with local radiotherapy, CHOP chemotherapy and Alemtuzumab,Fludarabine and Cyclophosfamide and fi nally Gemcitabine. On day +1016 from transplant (2005), she developed pancytopenia with severe neutropenia, fever and pneumonia. Hospitalization was required. Peripheral blood immunophenotype showed a marked lymphocyte depletion(total lymphocyte count 112/\u00b5l,CD3+ 64/\u00b5l,CD4+ 24/\u00b5l,CD8+ 39/\u00b5l,CD16/56+10/\u00b5l,). For this reason, donor CIK cells (1490x10 6 CD3+ cells;782x10 6 CD3+/ CD56+)were infused. The clinical, hematological and immune situation of the patient rapidly recovered allowing the hospital discharged after 2 weeks. One month after the infusion of CIK cells, the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes was 2083/ \u00b5l,(with CD3+1595/\u00b5l,CD4+226/\u00b5l,CD8+1422/\u00b5l,CD16+/56+ 440/ \u00b5l).No evidence of aGVHD was registered. Conclusion: In a clinical setting characterized by severe depletion of peripheral blood lymphocytes, the infusion of CIK cells confi rmed to be well tolerated and allowed a rapid recovery of the whole immune system including not only cytotoxic CD8+ cells but also all the other main lymphocyte subpopulations. It is tempting to speculate that CIK cells and possibly some cytokines massively released in the setting of severe immune depletion may play such a major role to stimulate the immune recovery. The possible direct role of CIK cells in controlling viral and fungal infections in vivo is currently under investigation. Objectives: Human Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hMSCs) are considered good candidates for a growing spectrum of cellular therapies. They can be isolated from different biological sources and expanded in colture but a reproducible and effi cent method to obtain hMSCs feasible for clinical use is diffi cult to perform. Aim of this study was to validate a FBS-free two-steps protocol expansion starting from both bone marrow aspirates and washouts of bone marrow collection bags and fi lters in compliance to Good Manufacturing Practice. Methods: Total nucleated cells were collected and seeded without any manipulation in 5% human platelet lysate (hPL) supplemented alpha-MEM. After 48 hours nonadherent cells were removed and the adherent cells were expanded for 7-14 days with periodic feeding. The cells were then harvested and seeded at low density (100-200 cells/cm\u00b2) and allowed to expand for additional 10-20 days. Finally the cells were harvested and frozen. Results: In a median of 21 days (range 17 to 33), 19 \"adults\"(mean 69x106 hMSCs/bag) clinical bags could be prepared from the expansion of a portion of the cells recovered from 4 independent washouts and from 4 bone marrow harvests. 35 and 8 vials could be frozen from the remaining cells recovered from the washouts and bone marrow harvests, respectively. The theoretical full expansion of the frozen vials (validated by the expansion of 2 independent vials) could have allowed the production of 173 bags from 4 independent washouts and 18 bags from 4 bone marrow harvests. Clinical scale expanded hMSCs identity and purity were assessed by testing viability and expression of CD14, CD34, CD45, CD73, CD90 and CD105. Cytogenetic analysis was performed and no chromosomal alteration has been revealed. Bacterial, fungal, mycoplasma and endotoxin contamination were tested by validated tests according to European Pharmacopea guidelines and always found negative. Discussion: Starting from both bone marrow aspirates and bone marrow collection bags and fi lter, a minimally manipulated culture procedure allows to produce suffi cient numbers of hMSCs for therapeutic purpose using only clinical grade reagent and avoiding animal serum and to establish a frozen bank of early passages cells which can be subsequently recovered and further expanded. Furthermore it has been demostrated the normally discarded collection devices such as BM washouts represent a convenient source of large amount of hMSCs. In our Centre the standard conditioning regimen for autologous SCT in the setting of lymphoma is the combination of Carmustine, Etoposide, Ara-c and Melphalan (BEAM). In the last few years an impairment in carmustine availability, at least in Italian hospitals, has occurred. Thus, we modifi ed the standard BEAM regimen by replacing the iv administered Carmustine with its oral analogous Lomustine. The aim of the study is to evaluate feasibility and toxicity of the conditioning regimen combining CCNU 200 mg/m\u00b2, Ara C 1600 mg/m\u00b2 Etoposide 800 mg/m\u00b2, and Mel 140 mg/m\u00b2 (CEAM), and to compare these data with those of our historical group of patients conditioned with BEAM. We analized 94 consecutive patients who underwent autologous SCT in our BMT Unit between Jan 2005 and May 2008; 47 patients (pts) were conditioned with CEAM. Among these, 16 were affected by HD, 24 were diagnosed as high grade NHL and 7 as FCL. Disease status at time of SCT was 1st CR in 15 pts and 2nd or subsequent CR in 10; 21 pts had PR or active disease. Median age was 45 y (range 22-61). Median level of CD34-positive cells infused was 10.83 x 10 6 /kg (range 3.44-41.6). Median time to neutrophil engrafment was 9 days (range 7-11). 27 pts had at least one episode of febrile neutropenia (57.4%) and in 12 cases an infection was microbiologically doc-S195 umented. Gastrointestinal mucositis requiring major analgesia occurred in 2 pts. No other unexpected toxicities were recorded. Median hospitalization period was 18 days (range 15-30). In the other group of 47 pts treated with BEAM, 14 were affected by HD, 30 by HG NHL and 11 by FCL. Disease status at time of transplant was 1st CR in 14 pts; 2nd or subsequent CR in 14; PR or active disease in 28. Median age was 46 y (range 17-62). Median level of CD34-positive cells infused was 14 x 10 6 /kg (range 7.48-60). Median time to neutrophil engrafment was 9 days (range 7-11). 29 pts had at least one episode of febrile neutropenia (61.7%) and in 12 cases had a microbiologically documented infection. Gastrointestinal mucositis requiring major analgesia occurred in 4 pts. No other unexpected toxicities were recorded. Median hospitalization period was 19 days (range 15-42). These data seem to demonstrate a good safety and feasibility profi le for CEAM schedule as conditioning regimen. Regimen-related toxicities are similar to those associated with BEAM. Therefore these conditioning schemes seems to be exchangeable.",

Methods: Between 1998 and 2004, 450 patients received HSCT at Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 167 (37%) patients including 42 children. All patients were investigated by chest X-ray and/or computer tomography. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed on 68 occasions in 57 patients (6 children). In 110 patients including 36 children with pneumonia, BAL was not performed. Results: BAL contributed to the diagnosis in 43 (63%) cases with 53 considered relevant fi ndings; bacteria 13 (24%), viruses 28 (53%), and fungi 12 (23%). In 25 cases BAL was negative. In 15 of these, BAL was performed \u2265 4 days after chest X-ray, in 4 not in the same segment as the infi ltrations. Median time between radiographic fi ndings and a positive BAL was 2 (0-15) days and a negative BAL 6 (1-30) days, p<0.001. Antimicrobial treatment was administered to 84% patients with positive and 92% with negative fi ndings at the time of BAL. No serious complication due to the procedure was reported. BAL resulted in a changed treatment in 31 (72%) episodes of pneumonia. In the BAL-group 63% and in the non-BAL group 71% recovered, respectively. However, the latter group included 23% more children, more likely to recover. Conclusions: We conclude that BAL is a safe and useful diagnostic procedure for the evaluation of pulmonary complications and should be performed early at the onset of pneumonia following allogeneic HSCT.",

            "text": "Rationale: A gene profi le is a pattern of expression genes that is typical for all, or for some of the known samples of a particular disease. This profi le can be matched against existing gene profi les. Based on similarity, it can be predicted with certain probability if the patient is in an early phase of a disease or he/she is at risk of developing the disease in the future with certain probability. We apply a Computational Neurogenetic Modeling (CNGM) technique to confi rm clinical diagnosis of acute Graft vs Host Disease (aGVHD) and to predict the occurrence of this complication using a specifi c profi le of a immune gene panel. Experimental data: Expression changes of 48 genes were evaluated in 21 patients affected by haematological malignancies submitted to allo-SCT from HLA-related (n=19) and unrelated donors (n=2) for a total of 82 single observations. We have used a TaqMan\u00ae Low Density Array based on comparative ddCT method to perform a relative quantifi cation of mRNA. In all patients serial samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected between 10-90 days after transplant and in each time when a clinical feature compatible with aGVHD was present. Ten patients did not experience aGVHD, 11 patients had II-III grade of aGVHD. Result: In this study we have applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to reduce numbers of variables, but also to select variables with major weight for each principal component (PC). We found: a) for diagnosis GVHD (Yes) 2 PC, with cumulative variance of 64% and a third PC lower, b) for diagnosis GVHD (No) 2 PC, with cumulative variance of 57% and a third PC very lower. The variables compose a subset of 23 genes present in the fi rst two principal components of GVHD Yes/ No. Variables of the fi rst PC of GVHD (No) is included in the subset of the fi rst two principal components GVHD (YES). Therefore we believe that this presence strengthens the importance of sub-set genes for training an intelligent system. Conclusion: Using the PCA a sub-set of genes with largest information was extrapolated from immune panel. Starting from this analysis it's natural to develop an Artifi cial Neural Network (ANN) where genes are inputs and output is the evaluation of syndrome. We have developed different types of ANN, and have compared them to improve results. The fi nal obtained results are good, and tell us that it's possible predict the aGVHD using a restrict number of variables with a sensitivity of 92,8%, fi g.1,2.",

In a validation project a newly developed tubing system with an incorporated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-resistant sterile fi lter (Closed Cryo Prep Set, Cell\u2022Max, Germany) for cryopreservation of cellular products was evaluated by challenge experiments and media fi ll runs. Methods: In a fi rst series, fi lter of 3 systems were challenged with spiked DMSO. 20 ml of DMSO were spiked with a defi ned solution of Bacillus subtilis (strain ATCC 6051) leading to a concentration of 1\u00d710E+06 colony forming units/ml. Prior fi ltration 100 \u00b5l were used to titrate bacteria counts of the inoculum in log 10 steps using BHI agar plates. 20 ml of the bacterial suspension were applied to the system. The fi ltrate was collected and fi nally titrated in log 10 steps on BHI agar plates. The infl uence of DMSO on the bacterial growth was examined by spiking DMSO and analysis of bacterial growth after different times. In a second series, fi lter of 3 systems were challenged in the same way but NaCl 0.9% was used as medium. Additionally, 3 media fi ll runs with CSL medium were performed to detect even smallest bacterial contaminations during processing. Results: In the DMSO series, after spiking but before fi ltration the number of detectable bacteria was already diminished by 4 to 5 log leading to detectable concentrations of 1\u00d710E+01-10E+02/ml. After fi ltration, bacterial growth was not detectable. Bacteria spiked in DMSO exhibited a time dependent decline of growth with a complete growth inhibition after 5 minutes of incubation. In the NaCl series, 35 to 50% of the spiked bacteria could be detected after spiking and before fi ltration. After fi ltration, bacterial growth was no longer detectable. All media fi ll runs led to sterile products. Conclusions: Although certainly most of the potential bacterial contaminants of hematopoetic progenitor cell (HPC) grafts are not viable after treatment in 99% DMSO (similar results were obtained for S. epidermides as published recently) the sterile fi lter offers an additional security measure to eliminate potential contaminants. Final validation runs processing leukaphereses from unmobilized healthy donors and evaluating cellular integrity, proliferative capacity and sterility of the product are the next task before implementation of the system in routine cryopreservation of HPC grafts.",

            "text": "The relevance of both minimal residual disease (MRD) and chimerism after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for the detection of relapse has not yet been extensively studied. We investigated MRD in 121 consecutive children with ALL (n=56), AML (n=36), MDS (n=22), or CML (n=7) who underwent HSCT. The Wilms' tumor gene (WT1) expression was used for the detection of MRD because WT1 is overexpressed in the vast majority of patients with leukemia. We performed a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to examine the level of WT1 expression. All 88 patients with continuous normal WT1 expression levels in bone marrow and continuous undetect-able WT1 expression levels in peripheral blood remained in complete remission at a median of 1925 days after HSCT. In contrast, all 31 patients who suffered from hematological relapse after a median of 151 days presented with high levels of WT1 expression (p<0.001). In 18 patients, we observed an increase of WT1 expression levels at a median of 34 days before hematological relapse. In 14 of these 18 patients, DNA was available at the time of increase of WT1 expression level to perform analysis of hematopoietic chimerism using a semi-quantitative short-tandem-repeat PCR. Interestingly, 10 of the 14 patients (71%) revealed a complete donor chimerism, whereas only 4 of the 14 patients (29%) showed a mixed chimerism. In the remaining 13 patients with relapse, no increase of WT1 expression levels could be detected because the time interval between the last sample harvest and hematological relapse was to long (median, 66 days). In fi ve of these 13 patients, DNA was available at the time of the last sample harvest before relapse and showed a complete donor chimerism. In two patients, we diagnosed a molecular relapse using WT1 expression. At the time of molecular relapse, both children revealed a complete donor chimerism. In both patients, molecular remission was achieved by immunotherapy. Both children are alive and well without relapse at 10 and 9 years after transplantation. In conclusion, quantitative analysis of WT1 expression is a valuable tool for monitoring of MRD after HSCT. Increasing levels of WT1 expression strongly predict hematological relapse. Therefore, this approach is very useful for early diagnosis and treatment of molecular relapse after HSCT. MRD measurement using WT1 expression is more sensitive for the detection of relapse than the analysis of hematopoietic chimerism.",

            "text": "Objectives: This study investigated the kinetics of whole peripheral blood (PB) and CD3+ T-cells chimerism in patients receiving reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The T-cell chimerism has been correlated with risk of grade II-IV acute graft-versus host disease (GvHD) and relapse. Materials and methods: Twenty-eight patients with a median age of 56 years (range 17-65) affected by lymphoma (19), multiple myeloma (5), acute myeloid leukaemia (3) or idiopathic myelofibrosis (1) received RIC allogeneic SCT at Hematology Division of Udine between January 2007 and August 2008. Source of stem cell was PB for all patients out one, that received one cord blood unit, and donors were matched unrelated for 21/28 patients. Conditioning regimens were: thiotepa plus cyclophosphamide (13), 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) plus fl udarabine (3), melphalan plus fl udarabine (3), total lymphoid irradiation (1). In 18 cases anti-thymocyte globulin was used as part of GVHD prophylaxis. Hematopoietic chimerism has been serially assessed at 30, 60, 90 and 180 days after SCT in whole PB and sorted CD3+ T-cells. The analysis have been performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based amplifi cation of short tandem repeats (STR) sequences using the Ampfl STR identifl er kit (Applied Biosystems). Full donor chimerism (FDC) was defi ned as the presence of at least 95% donor cells. Results: The percentage of patients achieving FDC was lower in CD3+ T-cells in comparison with whole PB at day 60 (74% vs 79%) onward. Patients with grade II-IV acute GVHD had more frequently FDC in CD3+ at day 30 in respect to patients without acute GvHD or with grade I (91%vs 61%, p=0.07), while there were no signifi cant differences at 60 and 90 days. Patients who subsequently relapsed had a signifi cant lower incidence of CD3+ FDC at day 30 (55% vs 87%, p= 0.07), at day 60 (50% vs 88%, p= 0.03) and at day 90 (66% vs 100%, p= 0.01) in comparison with patients with sustained remission. S197 Conclusions: We conclude that mixed chimerism at days 30, 60 and 90 was associated with an increased risk of relapse and the development of acute GvHD was correlated with FD T-cell chimerism at 30 day. These fi ndings can help the management of immunotherapy after RIC allogeneic stem cell transplantation. [18F]FDG-PET/CT was performed prospectively on day +100 after ASCT. FDG-PET/CT was negative in 37 patients; 34 are alive without disease progression (median follow-up 23,5 months, range 5-38), 2 died in CR 5 and 8 months after ASCT respectively from sudden death with no evidence of lymphoma and from CMV/Pneumocystis Carinii pneumonia. One patient, affected by T lymphoma, relapse at 16 months requiring treatment and is alive at 18 months after ASCT. Twelve patients were FDG-PET/CT positive, respectively 7 in NHL group and 5 in HD group. In this group 5 patients died from disease progression at a median of 13 months (range 10-39) after ASCT, 5 patient received radiotherapy on involved fi elds and are alive in CR after a median of 21 months (range 6-37). One patient affected by T lymphoma went on to have relapse/ progression at 8 months after ASCT and required further treatment. One patient was lost to follow up. One and 2 years after ASCT OS rates were 94% in PET-negative and 80% and 70% respectively in PET-positive patients (p=0.011) ( Figure 1 ); PFS rates were 100% and 96% at 1 and 2 years respectively in PET/CT-negative patients, meanwhile PFS rates were 39.7% at 1 and 2years in PET/CT -positive patients (p<0.0001) ( Figure 2 ).",

            "text": "The most useful means of assessing response to therapy in myeloma is controversial. Multiparameter fl ow cytometry (MFC) and PCR based techniques can accurately predict survival post autograft. However, the additional impact of such sensitive tests of MRD on practical decision making in the clinical setting is still unproven. In addition, these techniques are expensive, time-consuming and not accessible in many centres. We have found that in situ hybridization (ISH) defi ned \"stringent Complete Remission\" (sCR) is simple to calculate and provides excellent prognostic information, comparable to more complex tests. Requiring only two informative probes, ISH clearly identifi es plasma cell populations and allows accurate assessment of light chain restriction, in contrast to immunocytochemistry where background staining hampers interpretation. We validated this technique in 110 patients who underwent autologous stem cell transplant between 1998 and 2004. Informative biopsies were available in 105 patients (>95%). ISH was used to measure light chain restriction of residual plasma cells on trephine biopsy (> 4: 1 or 1: 2 Kappa: Lambda ratio was defi ned as abnormal). CR by standard EBMT criteria was associated with improved progression-free survival (p=0.011). This was more marked for ISH negative patients compared to ISH positive patients (p=0.001). Those in CR with negative ISH results (sCR) had the best outcome with median event-free survival of 81 months compared to 30 months in those that did not attain sCR (p=0.008). Of interest MRD negative/paraprotein positive patients show a trend towards a longer progression free interval than their MRD positive/paraprotein negative counterparts. A similar result is seen in relation to overall survival (sCR vs others = median survival not yet reached vs 86 months (p=0.026)). We do develop informative MFC panels at diagnosis but, since there is no data supporting alteration of therapy post transplant at present and pending further clarifi cation of the clinical utility of these more S198 expensive tests, we currently use ISH based sCR as a pragmatic way to stratify patients to enable therapeutic decisions to be made and inform patients of their likely prognosis. Background: The relapse of myeloid hematological malignancies after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a major problem. The early detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) may provide the opportunity to implement some preemptive therapies prior to overt hematological relapse. Here we present our experience with treatment of molecular relapses (MR) after SCT. Methods: We analyzed 15 patients (pts) with MR of myeloid hematological malignancies (AML, n=6; CML, n=9) after SCT. Molecular relapse in AML was defi ned as the at least once confi rmed reappearance of fusion transcript detection (CBFB/MYH11, n=1; MLL/AF6, n=2; MLL/ENL, n=2; RUNX1/ RUNX1T1, n=1;) or its 10-fold increase, when detected repeatedly using RQ PCR, and while the bone marrow morphology, immunophenotype, and cytogenetic examinations remained normal. Molecular relapse in CML was diagnosed when a patient had, over a period of at least 4 weeks, (1) three consecutive samples with BCR-ABL/ABL ratio greater than 0.02%; or (2) three samples with rising ratio, the last two greater than 0.02%; or (3) two samples greater than 0.05% without cytogenetic relapse. The following procedures were used to treat the AML MR: chemotherapy (2/6 pts), interleukin 2 (4/6 pts), donor leukocyte infusions (DLI) (6/6 pts). The CML MR were treated by imatinib (4/9 pts) and/or DLI (3/9 pts) or discontinuation of immunosuppression only (3/9 pts). Median age of pts was 46 years (range 21-62). The median follow up from start of MR treatment was 28 months (range 8-61). Results: Molecular remission was achieved in 89% of CML pts (8/9) and 83% of AML pts (5/6). Next MR were observed in 27% of pts (CML, n=2, and AML, n=2) after 2, 10, 11, and 20 months. With median follow-up of 28 months, 80% of pts (12/15) were alive and disease free, 20% of pts died (2 deaths from relapse of AML, one death from GVHD without link with treatment of MR). Toxicity of treatment was evaluated according to CTCAE, version 3.0. Hematologic toxicity grade 3 or 4 and febrile neutropenia grade 3 were observed in 2 pts treated by chemotherapy. Other toxicities were moderate to grade 1-2. GVHD grade 3 developed in 3 pts after DLI. Conclusion: Early intervention at the stage of MR after SCT seems to be effective treatment in both CML and AML pts. Response rate is high (87%) and the toxicity moderate. This strategy is worth to be pursuit in more pts and therefore, new reliable markers for MRD in AML pts are urgently needed.",

            "text": "Lymphoma cell contamination in stem-cell source is considered to have a role in eventual relapse in patients receiving autotransplant (ASCT). However, most appropriate methods for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) in autograft have not been well described in clinical outcome or cost-effectiveness. We retrospectively evaluated usefulness and clinical value of fl ow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCM) application of detecting MRD in stem-cell products compared to that of seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses in patients with indolent lymphoma receiving ASCT. Subjects were 35 patients with bone marrow/peripheral blood involvement of indolent lymphoma before induction chemotherapy who eventually underwent ASCT (20 relapsed follicular lymphoma(FL), one newly diagnosed FL, three relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma(MCL) and eleven newly diagnosed MCL). Twentythree patients were male. Median-age was 49 years old. Ten patients received ex-vivo purged ASCT, and 25 received invivo purged ASCT. Twenty-nine patients archived complete remission and six archived partial remission. The maximum sensitivity of FCM usage of light chain restriction in CD10 and CD19 positive for FL and in CD5 and CD19 positive for MCL was 1.5 -10-4, and that of PCR was 1.0 -10-6. The fi rst fi ve FL patients receiving in-vivo purging was evaluated according to morphologic, FCM and PCR examinations, which all confi rmed tumor-free graft. In the group of in-vivo purging, lymphoma cells in marrow and/or peripheral blood samples of all patients were not detected before harvest by each examination except one patient who showed MRD in marrow detected by FCM examination. With a median follow-up of 41 months, eight patients were relapsed (two FL and six MCL). Estimated 3-year overall and relapse-free survival was 87.3% (95%CI: 69.5 to 95.0) and 77.1(95%CI: 57.5 to 88.5), respectively. In the patients with FL, 3-year estimated overall and relapse-free survival was 85.0% (95%CI: 60.4 to 94.9) and 80.0% (95%CI: 55.1 to 92.0), respectively. In the patients with MCL, estimated 3-year overall and relapse-free survival was 90.9% (95%CI: 50.8 to 98.7) and 71.6% (95%CI: 33.7 to 90.3), respectively. In conclusion, threecolor FCM analyses were reliable for detecting MRD. Considering the less expensiveness than PCR method, FCM is the valuable techniques for detecting MRD in stem cell products. Long-term follow up are needed to confi rm the clinical value. The role of hemopoietic chimerism analysis as a prognostic indicator of relapse after conventional haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is under investigation. We monitored the chimerism status by serial examination of short tandem repeat-based polymerase chain reaction (STR) and evaluated the clinical outcome in 93 consecutive patients who underwent unmanipulated HCT with myeloablative conditioning .Thirty fi ve patients had ALL, 53 AML,2 blast crisis of CML, 2 non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and 1 had NK leukemia. Thirty six patients were in fi rst CR, 27 in second or third CR and 28 had relapsed or primary refractory disease. The number of infused CD34 + cells were 5,3 (0,99-12,9) x10 6 /kgr, while CD3+ cells were 3,77 (0,25-12,3) x10 8 /kgr. All patients had rapid and successful engraftment. Complete donor chimerism (CC) was achieved in 91/93 patients (98%) at day +18(14-100). Early CC (\u2264 months) was observed in 75(80%) while late (\u22652 months in 18 patients(19,5%). Post-ransplant fl uctuated values of mixed chimerism(MC) were observed at least once in 39/ 92 patients (42%) at a median time of 10 months. Twenty three of them were in hematological relapse. Donor lymphocyte infusions or immunotherapy with IFN-g or IL-2 was given in 28/39 patients. Estimates of disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 50% and 52% respectively, at 67 months. In terms of immune reconstitution after HCT, the time to complete immunological recovery was 7 months (6-60). In multivariate analysis we evaluated the time of obtaining CC with the following parameters :DFS, OS, relapse rate(RR), treatment related mortality(TRM), CD34+and CD3+cell dose of the graft, status of disease pre-HCT, acute and chronic GVHD, and TBI, or BUCY as conditioning regimen. Early occurrence of CC was associated with better DFS and OS (51% and 55%) (p=0,03). DFS and OS in patients with late CC was 43% and 33% respectively(p=0,03).The RR was signifi cantly higher in patients with late attainment of CC(p:0,02). In conclusion, frequent monitoring of chimerism status by highly sensitive methods might identify impending relapse and allow early therapeutic intervention which could be benefi cial in low disease load. Background and objectives: Quantitative analysis of chimerism after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) for acute leukemia is helpful to monitor the kinetic of engrafment. Usually, chimerism is assesed by variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) or short tandem repeat (STR) amplifi cation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which have a sensitivity of 1 to 5%. Insertion/Deletion (InDel) polymorphism analysis by real-time quantitative PCR (InDel-QPCR) is a more sensitive method, so it should be able to predict relapse earlier. Design and methods: We conducted a unicentric retrospective study and we evaluated the fi les of all consecutive patients transplanted from May 2004 to April 2008 which relapsed of an acute leukemia after allo-SCT. Sixteen patients (12 myeloblastic and 4 lymphoblastic acute leukemia) were included in the study. Median age was 45 years (22-60). Conditionning regimen was myeloablative in 12 patients, the source of stem cell was bone marrow in 8 patients. Quantitative analysis of chimerism by InDel-QPCR method was usually performed every month post transplant. Results: The median delay between transplant and cytological relapse was 8.5 months . In three patients the quantifi cation of recipient DNA rate was always superior to 1% at each point post transplant and they presented an early relapse (at 2, 3 and 4 months after transplant). The 13 remaining patients achieved a recipient DNA rate inferior to 1% at a median time of 35 days, in 11 patients recipient DNA rate was less than 0.1% at 56 days and in 7 patients recipient DNA rate was less than 0.01% at a median time of 189 days. The fi rst 13 patients presented an increased chimerism preceding cytological relapse, at a median interval of 52 days (5-154). At the time when an increased chimerism was detected, the peripheral blood count was normal in 12 patients, one had persistent thrombocytopenia since the allo-SCT. Conclusion: The 0.01% to 1% range was found to be valuable for an early relapse prediction. Thus, chimerism evaluation by InDel-QPCR is a necessary method for detection of post transplant relapse before cytological abnormalities in acute leukemia, allowing early therapeutic measures. Monitoring of chimerism kinetics after allogeneic SCT may facilitate clinical decision making regarding immunomodulation. The objective of this study was to analyze how chimerism dynamics drives clinical decisions in HLA-identical sibling myeloablative allogeneic SCT patients. Methods: 49 consecutive patients (pts) who underwent HLAidentical sibling myeloablative allogeneic SCT between 1996 and 2008 were retrospectively studied. Fifteen pts were excluded from the analysis (early death, lack of chimerism data or prior allogeneic SCT). Pts characteristics are shown in Table 1 . In our standard GVHD prophylaxis, CsA was aimed to be tapered from day +50 if no signs of GVHD were present. Chimerism analysis was performed by FISH or STR-PCR. Sequential studies were attempted to be performed in BM and PB on day +15, +30, +100, +180 and +365, as well as every other week in PB in cases with mixed chimerism (MC). Results: Out of the 34 evaluable pts, 26 showed stable complete chimerism (CC) or MC with decreasing recipient cells, therefore allowing standard management with progressive reduction of CsA. In this group, 20 patients showed CC in all samples since day +30 while MC after day +30 was seen in 6 patients ( Table  2 ). Acute GVHD (aGVHD) rate was 46% (15% grades III-IV). Relapse rate was 26% in a median time of 9 months after SCT, with a median follow-up of 56 months (4-132). Interestingly, the subgroup of pts with MC after day +30 showed a higher relapse rate in spite of similar GVHD rate compared to pts with CC. On the other hand, from the 34 pts, 4 (11%) showed MC with increasing recipient cells which caused a change in the immunossupresion management (withdrawal of CsA followed eventually by DLI or 2nd SCT). A response, return to CC in PB and/or BM was seen in 2. Finally, chimerism analysis did not predict clinical outcome in additional 4 pts: 3 pts showed relapse after day +80 in whom MC was detected after relapse showing CC in the immediate prior sample, and 1 pt presented graft failure showing CC (day +20). Conclusions: The observation of MC with increasing recipient cells was useful for decision making in a small subgroup of pts. Most pts showed stable CC or MC with decreasing recipient cells allowing reduction of immunossupresion. However, high relapse rate is observed in spite of stable CC, especially in the subgroup who show MC after +30. This pt population could benefi t from earlier withdrawal of immunossupresion or preemptive DLI. (1) Natural killer (NK) inhibitory receptors for self-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) play a central role in the acquisition or maintenance of NK-cell functional competence. This NK-cell education process relies on interactions with a partner cell whose identity remains undefi ned at present. As NK cells have been reported to exert a potent graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), it is important to determine how NK-cell education takes place after HSCT. Therefore, we studied the process of NK-cell education in a cohort of 28 recipients of unrelated T-cell-replete bone marrow or peripheral stem cell graft. Fifteen transplants were fully matched (10/10 allelic match on the HLA-A, -B, -C, -DQ, and -DR loci), whereas 13 showed a partial HLA mismatch (8/10 or 9/10), resulting in a killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-ligand mismatch. Using the CD107a mobilization assay, we measured the responsiveness of different NK-cell subsets towards the K562 target cell line, as a function of their expression of inhibitory receptors for self. We show that allogeneic HSCT is followed by a fully effi cient NK-cell education process that is achieved by 3 months after transplant, and lasts for at least 2 years after transplant. In addition, HLA-mismatched HSCT leads to a stable education pattern that is determined by donor-and not by recipient-HLA ligands. This result suggests that the NK cell's partner in education is from hematopoietic rather than extra-hematopoietic origin. From a clinical point of view, this donor-ligand-driven NK-cell education model provides the fundamental basis for a sustained and long-lived GvL effect after HLA-mismatched HSCT.",

We conducted a multicentre, retrospective analysis in order to analyse variables associated with outcome in this setting. The median age of the 406 patients (pts) included in this study was 46 years (range, 13-70 years), 174 pts (42.5%) received a graft from a HLA-identical sibling, whereas 229 (56.4%) received an unrelated graft. The median follow up was 282 days (range 3-3607 days). A variety of conditioning protocols were used. In 53 pts (13.1%) a myeloablative approach was used and 338 pts (83.3%) received reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). Advanced stage of a disease was defi ned as refractory disease, partial remission or more than 2nd complete remission at time of transplant. Diseases included in this study were acute myelogenous leukemia (AML, 188 pts), non-Hodgkin\u00b4s lymphoma (NHL, 80 pts), myeloproliferative disease (MPS, 54 pts), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, 47 pts). The overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were estimated according to Kaplan-Meier method. Differences between curves were assessed by Mantels's log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the independence of OS and DFS from prognostic factors in a multivariate model. The 2 year OS and 5 year OS in this group were 36.6% and 26.9% respectively. The DFS at 2 years and 5 years were 50.0% and 42.4%. Diagnosis was associated with a significant impact on both, OS and DFS (p<0.001 and 0.006), with NHL and MPS having the best outcome. In pts who survived more than 100 days (60.8%), limited chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) improved the OS signifi cantly compared to extensive chronic GvHD or no chronic GvHD (p=0.002). Intensity of conditioning regimen had no impact on DFS, there was a trend for longer OS in pts who received RIC compared to those with myeloablative conditioning (p=0.08). In multivariate analysis underlying malignancy, intensity of conditioning regimen, acute and chronic GvHD and performance status were associated with OS. A proportion of pts with advanced hematological diseases achieve long term remission after AHSCT. CGVHD but not the intensity of conditioning has impact on outcome in this setting. Development of transplant protocols with focus on immunological rather than cytotoxic effects is necessary.",

T-cells can be distinguished into two phenotypic sub-groups by the expression of specifi c alpha/beta-and gamma/delta (GD) Tcell receptors. Methods: Only few studies have investigated the impact of recovery with increased GD-T-cells following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A recent study (Godder et al., BMT 2007) indicated a survival advantage for patients (pts) recovering with high GD-T-cells following HSCT. The data presented here emerge from a single-centre analysis evaluating the role of high GD-T-cells following HSCT in pts with hematologic malignancies. We included all patients with at least three consecutive analyses of alpha/beta-and GD-T-cells within the fi rst year after HSCT. This cohort of 107 pts. includes the following entities: AML (n=40), CML (n=19), ALL (n=13), MDS (n=11), OMF (n=9), NHL (n=7), and other diseases (n=8). Results: The threshold for the GD-high-group was defi ned as follows: 3 x above the median of all GD-T-cells of the study cohort within the fi rst 12 months after HSCT. According to this threshold 29 pts (27%) recovered with increased GD-T-cells at 3 or more time points after HSCT. The pts recovering with increased GD-T-cells achieved a signifi cantly higher overall survival (88% \u00b1 12%) compared to pts with lower GD-T-cells (69% \u00b1 6%, p 0.029). There was a trend (p=0.180) to less relapse in the GD-high-group, but also a trend (p=0.083) to more acute GvHD in the GD-high-group. The multivariate Cox-analysis confi rmed the overall survival advantage for the GD-high-group, however, without statistic relevance (p=0.105). Similar sub-group analyses for the recovery with increased alpha/beta T cells or with increased T helper cells did not indicate any survival advantage. In addition, elevated alpha/beta S201 T cells or elevated T helper cells were not directly correlated with elevated gamma/delta T cells. These analyses support that the benefi cial effect on overall survival is due to the recovery with high GD-T cells. Conclusions: This study confi rms the hypothesis of a benefi cial effect of high GD-T-cells recovery following HSCT regarding overall survival. Further research is warranted to determine more accurately the importance of GD-T-cells to possibly develop new therapeutic options in HSCT as e.g. graft engineering.",

Functional analysis of clonally expanded NK cells is the gold standard to assess alloreactivity, but is labor intensive and time consuming. We investigated the reconstitution of inhibitory NK cell receptor repertoire by flowcytometrical study of Killercell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)/natural killer-cell group-2-antigen (NKG2A) expression on donor derived natural killer cells in 39 patients after haploidentical stem cell transplantation (SCT). The KIR/NKG2A repertoire was skewed in the fi rst 6 months after SCT with reduced numbers of NK cells expressing a single KIR without co-expression of other KIR/NKG2A. Generation of such potentially alloreactive single KIR expressing subpopulations was faster for KIR binding HLA-C1, than for slower for KIR binding HLA-C2 or HLA-Bw4. In agreement with the repertoire studies, a retrospective analysis of transplant outcome of 115 patients transplanted for acute myelod leukemia showed better survival in patients transplanted from HLA-C1 mismatched donors than in patients grafted from donors mismatched for HLA-C2 or HLA-Bw4. In conclusion, these results appear to indicate that the temporal dynamics of reconstitution of NK cells of different allospecifi cities may impact upon survival after haploidentical SCT. As fl owcytometrical studies are limited by several factors, e.g. the fact that antibodies discriminating between activating and inhibitory KIR are not universally available, these studies need to be corroborated by post-transplant functional evaluations of the reconstituting alloreactive NK repertoires by NK cell cloning and cytotoxicity assays against recipient targets.",

Alefacept (Amevive\u00ae) is an immunosuppressive dimeric fusion protein that is used for psoriasis control. We showed its remarkable effect in acute steroid resistant/dependent and chronic extensive GVHD. Patients and methods: To date, 37 patients with a median age of 30 years (range 3-66) were treated by us with alefacept due to acute (n=25) or chronic (n=12) steroid resistant/dependent GVHD (23 males, 14 females). Eighteen were transplanted from HLA matched family members, 10 from HLA matched unrelated donors, 7 from mismatched donors and 2 from unrelated cord blood units. Pretreatment acute GVHD grade ranged 2-4 (median 3) and involved the skin (25), gut (16) and liver (5). All the patients with chronic GVHD had extensive involvement prior to therapy. The median time from transplantation to alefacept was 42.5 days and 13 months in acute and chronic GVHD respectively (range 18-110d and 3-47.5m) and a median of 9 (range 1-25) injections that were given per patient. Results: Twenty-eight out of the 37 patients (75.6%) responded to the treatment (19 and 9 in the acute and chronic group respectively). Despite this high response rate, demonstrating the deep immunosuppressive effect of alefacept, only 3/35 evaluable patients (fi gure 1) have relapsed (with a median follow-up of 32.5 months on the 13 survivors). Other than the 3 patients that relapsed, full-donor chimerism (100% donor cells and no residual host-type DNA) was stable throughout the treatment period and later in all but one patient, that developed mixed chimerism under alefacept treatment. His chimerism returned to full-donor chimerism with taper-down of immune suppression. Currently, 13/37 patients are alive (fi gure 2), most with improved or stable GVHD. Twenty-four patients died due to GVHD progression (13), progression of the basic disease (4), infections (4) or other causes (3). Conclusion: alefacept is effective and safe for the treatment of acute or chronic steroid resistant/dependent GVHD and may carry some discrimination between GVHD and GVL.",

            "text": "Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) to treat relapse of non-CML hematologic malignancies following alloSCT has relatively low effi cacy. We recently reviewed our experience of DLI for relapse in non-CML diseases: 64 pts received DLI\u00b1chemotherapy for relapse (25 MAC, 39 RIC; 56 Sib., 8 MUD). A response could be achieved in 19 (26%): 7/21 AML, 5/18 MM, 4/10 NHL, 1/5 HD, 1/5 ALL, 1/3 other. Although these results indicated a GVT effect, they remain relatively disappointing. Several factors may account for this lower effi cacy namely inhibition of effector cells by host-derived regulatory sub-populations. DLI results might be improved through manipulation of the recipient immune environment to allow for in vivo expansion of donor T cells from the DLI. For this purpose, we designed a dose-escalation protocol of DLI preceded by lymphodepletion (LD) using fl udarabine (Flu) and cyclophosphamide (Cy). Thus far, we treated 12 pts with LD-DLI for post-transplant relapse (3 ALL, 5 AML/MDS, 2 HD, 2 T-NHL; 2 MAC, 10 RIC; 6 Sib., 6 MUD). To avoid overwhelming toxicity due to severe GVHD, we proceeded by sequentially escalating both LD and T cell doses infused. LD consisted in Flu 25mg/m\u00b2/d for 3 d followed by infusion of 1x10 7 CD3+cells/Kg. If no GVHD developed and disease persisted or progressed, the same LD was followed by a second DLI at 5x10 7 CD3+cells/Kg. At the next step, LD combined both Cy 600mg/m\u00b2 for 1 d and Flu 25mg/m\u00b2/d for 3 d followed by DLI at 5x10 7 CD3+cells/Kg. Eight, three and one pt(s) received respectively one, two or three LD-DLIs. The fi rst LD-DLI was given at a median of 204 d (62-1917) following alloSCT. Of note, chemotherapy to treat relapse prior LD-DLI was administered in 7 pts with only one pt responding successfully. Gr II-IV acute GVHD following LD-DLI was observed in 5/12 pts (45%) while in our control group of 64 pts without LD, the incidence was 36.8% (P=ns). The median onset of acute gr II-IV GVHD following the last LD-DLI was 31 d (range 15-59) not signifi cantly different from the control group (34 d; 12-120). At last follow-up, 6 pts died: 4 relapses, 1 sepsis, 1 lung carcinoma. No pt died due to GVHD. Tumor response to LD-DLI was observed in 3 pts, all 3 achieved CR. Study of the immunomodulatory effects of LD (pre-and post-LD-DLI T cells including Treg and cytokine secretion) are currently being further characterized and will be presented. We conclude that LD-DLI has an acceptable toxicity if used in a stepwise manner or adapted to the severity of the disease.",

Objective response was observed independent of the underlying disease but was more obvious for molecular relapse or MC compared to haematological relapse. Median overall survival was 1.1 years after fi rst DLI. Patients responding to DLI had a markedly better prognosis (median survival not reached, p<0.0001) than patients who had stable disease (median survival 409 days) or disease progression (median survival 83 days). Likewise, survival depended on the indication for DLI. Patients who had received DLI for treatment of a full-blown hematological relapse had the worst prognosis with a median survival of 120 days post fi rst DLI. Acute GvHD was generally mild, with a dose dependence for aGvHD grade I+II. Only one patient died due to DLI-induced aGvHD in CR. Conclusion: DLI of stimulated lymphocytes derived from frozen allogenic grafts after PBSCT is safe and effi cient to induce long-term remissions.

            "text": "Background: Human class I leukocyte antigens are ligands for killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIRs). These receptors are expressed by NK and T-cells and thus modulate innate and adaptive immunity. KIR mismatches have been suggested to modify the outcome after stem cell transplantation. The clinical impact of killer cell receptors may vary between disease entities and pre-and post transplant therapeutic regiments. We have therefore performed a retrospective study with patients transplanted in our centre between 1996 and 2007. Patients and Methods: Samples from 54 donor/patients pairs out of a consecutive cohort of 147 allografted AML-patients, pairs were evaluable for retrospective KIR-ligand matching. The median patient age was 47 years (25-66). Patients were transplanted with G-CSF-stimulated peripheral blood stem cells (n=51) or bone marrow (n=3) from HLA matched unrelated (n=31) or related donors (n=23). KIR typing was performed as previously described. Patients were categorized according to their HLA inhibitory KIR ligand group C1, C2, Bw4, A3/A11 and presence or absence of KIR. Results: The overall survival (OAS) of all 54 evaluable patients at 5 years is 53% with a median follow up period of 2,6 years (range 1 -6.2 years). Twentythree patients died due to relapse (n=14) or nonrelapse mortality (NRM, n=9). Patients with a KIRligand mismatch (KIR-mm) had a trend towards lower relapse and nonrelapse mortality (3/31 vs. 5/23, p=0.12 and 6/31 vs. 8/23, p=0.15, respectively). Overall survival was superior in patients with KIR-ligand mismatches (KIR-mm) compared to the group of patients without mismatches (70% versus 28%, log rank p= 0.005). Patients with 2 KIR mismatches (C1 and/or C2) had even a better survival compared to patients with single KIR mismatches. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that allografted AMLpatients with KIR mismatch have a signifi cantly superior survival. The mortality due to both relapse and as well as NRM is reduced. Patients with AML benefi t from KIR-ligand mismatched allografts. KIR typing could be a useful tool to be included to defi ne optimal histocompatibility of donors and patients.",

            "text": "T-prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) is a T-cell malignancy with an aggressive clinical course. Only a small proportion of patients respond to conventional chemotherapy. Although anecdotal reports suggest that allogeneic stem cell transplantation can provide prolonged disease control in patients with T-PLL, evidence that this disease is sensitive to graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) activity is still lacking. Here we describe for the fi rst time the observation of molecular clearance of residual disease upon onset of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) in a patient who had undergone non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (NST) for T-PLL. Case report: A 58-year old man presented with rapidly progressive monoclonal (V beta 14) CD3+ CD8+ T lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly consistent with T-PLL. He achieved complete remission after 1st-line treatment with alemtuzumab by clinical criteria, fl ow cytometry, and TCD beta multiplex PCR (BIOMED-2 primers, genescan, sensitivity 1-5%). Six weeks after the end of alemtuzumab therapy the patient underwent NST from an HLA-identical sibling donor after conditioning with fl udarabine (30mg/m\u00b2 day 1-5) and cyclophosphamide (500mg/m\u00b2 day1-5). He experienced successful engraftment and there was no relevant immediate transplant-related toxicity. However, full donor chimerism was not achieved unless complete withdrawal of systemic immunosuppression at day +134 post transplant. From day +181 onwards, the patient developed symptoms of limited cGVHD which did not require resumption of immunosuppressive therapy. Post transplant molecular minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring of blood and bone marrow samples showed reappearance of clonal TCD beta PCR signals starting at day +46. Taqman-based clone-specifi c quantitative TCR beta PCR using 2 markers (J beta 1.3, sensitivity 0.001%; J beta 2.2, sensitivity 0.05%) confi rmed identity with the original T-PLL clone. MRD level was 0.4% at day +134 but became undetectable by J beta 2.2. and decreased to ongoing low-level positivity by J beta 1.3. (<0.01%) from day +209 onwards subsequent to onset of cGVHD. 14 months after NST, the patient is in ongoing clinical remission and shows sustained molecular response with decreasing signs of mild cGVHD. Conclusions: This is the fi rst report showing disease response at the molecular level subsequent to immunosuppression withdrawal and onset of cGVHD in T-PLL, strongly suggesting the existence of effective GVL activity. Therefore NST seems to be a promising therapeutic option in this otherwise incurable disease. The NOD2/CARD15 gene encodes the NOD2 protein which is critically involved in innate immunity. We have recently shown that NOD2/CARD15 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) 8, 12 and 13 within the genotype of an Unrelated Donor (UD) Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) pair result in signifi cant increases in mortality and relapse for acute leukaemia patients. There are over 100 additional NOD2/CARD15 SNPs but knowledge of their functional impact is limited and their affects on HSCT outcome have yet to be established. Here we report the impact of the frequently seen NOD2/CARD15 SNP 5 (P268S) on transplant outcome in addition to SNPs 8, 12 and 13. A sequencing protocol for the entire NOD2/CARD15 exonic region was established and used to genotype 87 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) recipients and their UDs transplanted between 1996 and 2003 in the UK. 66% of pairs were a 10/10 HLA allele match (8% 12/12 matched). 81% used myeloablative conditioning regimens, 72% included T-cell depletion with in-vivo alemtuzumab being the usual method. Grafts were bone marrow (82%) and peripheral blood stem cells (18%). Immunosuppression was Cyclosporine A alone (30%) or with Methotrexate (46%). The observed frequency of SNPs 5, 8, 12 and 13 in this cohort were 27%, 7%, 1% and 1% respectively. The presence of SNP 5 within the pair genotype resulted in signifi cantly higher mortality (6 years: WT 60%, SNP 24%; P=0.017) due to significantly increased disease relapse (6 years: WT 8%, SNP 47%; P=0.002). These effects persisted in multivariate analysis (OS: P=0.05, RR 2.232; Relapse: P=0.032, RR 5.007). In contrast to previous data, there were no signifi cant effects of SNPs 8, 12 or 13 individually or in combination in any of the models analysed. Of the individuals genotyped as having SNP 8, 12, and/or 13, 88% were also positive for SNP 5 indicating that there is likely Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) between the NOD2/ CARD15 SNPs. We conclude that the presence of NOD2/CARD15 SNP 5 within an UD-HSCT pair genotype results in increased disease relapse and mortality. There were no effects of any of the three previously studied NOD2/CARD15 SNPs (8, 12 or 13) on transplant outcome suggesting that they may be markers for a negative outcome post-transplant and may be in LD with other SNPs which are causative of these complications. These data demonstrate the need for identifying NOD2/CARD15 haplotypes and establishing their functional consequences and impact on transplant outcome. Cellular therapy for vascular regeneration is the subject of intense clinical research. Ongoing clinical trials mainly use S204 blood-or marrow-derived cell fractions for transplantation to treat cardiovascular disease. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs), monocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) within these transplants are thought to contribute to vessel regeneration. Safety concerns regarding atherosclerosis aggravation have emerged because all three cell types can also contribute to atheroma formation. We therefore examined the foam cell capacity of clinically applied vascular regenerative cells as a surrogate marker for potential pro-atherogenic side effects. Foam cell formation was tested with human ECFCs, CD14+ monocytes and MSCs which were either immediately exposed for 12 to 84 hours to acetylated low-density lipoprotein (acLDL) or subjected to a 3-day pro-angiogenic induction prior to the acLDL exposure according to clinical trial protocols. Intracellular lipid accumulation was detected by Nile Red staining with fl uorescence laser-scanning microscopy. After 3D mapping 0.5\u00b5m sections along the z-axis, the number of lipid droplets (LDs) per cell was determined using ImageJ software. Morphometric observations were confi rmed by fl ow cytometry. We found an accumulation of bright fl uorescent LDs in cultured monocytes typical for foam cells. Twelve hours of acLDL exposure after a 3-day pro-angiogenic induction resulted in increased numbers of LDs/cell, compared to 12h acLDLexposed fresh monocytes (mean\u00b1SD: 42\u00b114; range: 28-58 versus 5\u00b17; 0-18 LDs/cell). A prolonged acLDL exposure for 84h after pro-angiogenic induction even more clearly enhanced lipid accumulation in monocytes as compared to 84h of acLDL exposure without pro-angiogenic conditioning (100\u00b134; 49-138 LDs/cell; versus 20\u00b17; 13-32 LDs/cell). Despite acLDL uptake, MSCs and ECFCs displayed no obvious LD accumulation as confi rmed by fl ow cytometry within a seven day observation period.",

            "text": "Background: Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) has been previously shown to be a neuroprotective factor in models of cerebral ischemia and Parkinson's disease. In addition it has been demonstrated to have a direct anti apoptotic neuronal effects and also to stimulate neurogenesis in animal stroke models. We proposed to use cell population subsets induced by G-CSF to slow down disease progression in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Methods: Patients with defi nite or probable ALS were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive G-CSF 20\u00b5g/kg (5\u00b5g/kg x 4d) or placebo every three months for a year. The primary outcome measure was the functional decline as defi ned by the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale score (ALSFRS-R). Secondary effi cacy measures included changes in vital capacity, manual muscle strength, compound muscle action potential amplitudes, neurophysiological index, McGi11 single item quality of life score (QoL). Results: Thirty-nine patients were enrolled (study arm -19, control arm -20). G-CSF was effective in mobilizing CD34+ cells to blood. The results showed a trend of slowing disease progression following two cycles of G-CSF treatment in the G-CSF treated group in the fi rst six treatment months. Shown by lower slopes of ALSFRS-R (monthly decrease of 0.77 vs 1.08 points in the G-CSF vs controls, respectively, which means about 30% reduction) and the McGill QoL [decline by only 0.5 point /6 months vs a decline of 3 fold higher (1.4 points) in the controls], respectively. The treatment had no major side effects. Conclusion: G-CSF administration in ALS patients caused successful mobilization of autologous stem progenitor cells, within the normal range. A trend of slowing down disease deterioration at six months was observed, although it did not reach statistical signifi cance due to the small number of patients enrolled and the high drop-out rate. No major side effects were observed. A further study with a higher G-CSF dose, possibly a different dose schedule, a combination with an intervention with changes permeability of the blood-brain-barrier, or with one of the novel CXCR4 based emerging cell mobilizing drugs, in a larger number of patients is warranted. Background: Increased levels of endothelial-like vascular progenitor cells (VPCs) in PBSCs used in HSCT have been associated with reduced transplant-related toxicity. In this study, angiogenic and infl ammatory plasma proteins were quantitatively analyzed in patients undergoing autologous HSCT and correlated with graft VPC levels, graft CD34+ levels and transplant-related toxicity to identify informative biomarkers for VPC mobilization. Methods: Patients undergoing autologous HSCT were enrolled following informed consent. Using plasma samples from baseline and on day of PBSC collection, 19 factors were quantifi ed using multianalyte fl uorescence and/or ELISA. VPC clusters were enumerated using a standard cell culture assay, and transplant-related organ toxicity was determined using the Seattle criteria. Variables were dichotomized based on mean values and outcomes were dichotomized using established thresholds (VPCs > or < 2.0x10 3 /kg, CD34 > or < 5.0x10 6 /kg). Results: 36 patients were enrolled (mean age 51, 42% female) and had myeloma (10), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (14 pts), Hodgkin's Disease (7 pts) and other diagnoses (5 pts). 30 pts underwent autologous HSCT with a median of 7.0 \u00b1 3.9x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg and 6.9 \u00b1 10.3x10 3 VPCs/kg in the PBSC graft. Only plasma EPO levels increased signifi cantly on the day of PBSC collection in comparison with baseline plasma levels (p<0.05). IL-2, -10, epidermal growth factor (EGF), IFN-alpha and angiopoietin-1 all decreased signifi cantly between baseline and day of PBSC collection (p<0.05). At baseline, elevated macrophage infl ammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1alpha) levels correlated with high graft VPCs (p=0.05) and elevated IL-6 concentrations correlated with high graft CD34+ levels (p=0.04). At date of PBSC collection, elevated erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations correlated with high graft VPCs (0.02) while elevated EGF concentrations correlated with low CD34+ levels (p=0.03). High tumour necrosis factor-alpha concentrations on day of PBSC collection correlated with high transplant-related toxicity (p=0.03). Conclusions: The association of different plasma proteins with graft VPC and CD34+ cell mobilization suggests VPC and HSCs mobilize through independent mechanisms. Patients with low MIP-1alpha at baseline may benefi t from interventions that increase graft VPC levels. Strategies that increase plasma EPO to augment the regenerative properties of PBSC products should be considered.",

Based on experimental mouse studies, the benefi t of local injection of bone marrow multipotent mesenchymal stem cells to favour wound healing has been suggested after grafting 3 burned patients. However, further studies are required to validate these promising results and to elucidate the mechanisms involved. The aim of this study was to set up a rat model of severe CRS in order to clarify some of these points. We especially focused on Adipocyte Derived Stem Cells (ASC) which represent an alternative source of multipotent cells in regenerative medicine. Following injection, they may favour re-vascularization of damaged tissues via local trophic factor secretion. Moreover, their capacity to transdifferentiate remains debated. Syngeneic Fisher rats were locally irradiated at the back (50 Gy gamma) using a 60Co source (n=4). Pinching the skin above a lead screen during exposure prevents global irradiation. After a 10 days long phase of latency, the infl ammatory processes were clinically revealed by acute pain and erythema. Then hair loss and dry then moist desquamation were successively observed (weeks 1 to 3). At week 3-4, all the irradiated area (i.e. about 25 cm\u00b2) exhibited a radiation ulcer damage aspect. This indicates a second-degree burn. During the next three months, wound healing remained incomplete with iterative infl ammatory waves and moist desquamations which led to partial wound re-opening. General state of the irradiated rats was impaired (prolonged body weight loss). 4 supplementary irradiated Fischer rats were locally injected with Syngeneic ASC (previously cultured in presence of Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 at 2 ng/ml) at day 7 and day 13 (10x10 6 twice). Pain was reduced and wound healing improved 2 months after irradiation in all treated rats when compared with controls. In one of them, only hair loss and a localized (3 cm\u00b2) painless fi rst-degree burn at day 30 was observed followed by ultimate healing. Our study suggests the benefi t of the early localized injection of ASC to favour healing in case of CRS. Work is in progress to manipulate ASC ex vivo to improve their graft effi cacy.",

For decades MSC have been enriched by density gradient media (DGM) centrifugation using, for example, Ficoll-Paque\u2122 type products with a density of 1.077 g/ml, which isolates the BM mononucleated cells (BMMNC)(1-3). Objectives: We hypothesized that the use of a lower density may be associated with a further enrichment of MSC progenitors having distinct physical and biological properties. Thus, we compared two novel GMP-manufactured DGM (Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM and Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM 1.073 GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Sweden) according to their different densities: 1.077 versus 1.073 g/ml. Methods: Samples (n=13) were obtained by BM aspiration procedures. BM suspensions were scored, mixed with PBS (1:1) and gently layered on both gradients. Centrifugation was performed at 623g for 20 minutes at RT. The BMMNC were then exposed to the following assays: viability (by 7AAD), FACS analyses (CD45, CD14, HLA-DR, CD105, CD90, CD73, GD2, CD140, CD146, CD200), clonogenic MSC assay (CFU-F), MSC ex-vivo expansion and differentiations (4). Results: After separation, there was a similar cell recovery in the 1.077 (25,8\u00b114,5%) and 1.073 (26,5\u00b117,6%) groups. No difference in cell viability was noticed between groups (7AAD+: 4,4\u00b15,3% in 1.077 and 4,8\u00b14,5% in 1.073). The FACS analyses on freshly isolated BMMNC indicate that 1.073 signifi cantly reduces the CD45+ cell fraction and enriches CD45-/CD105+/ CD90+/GD2+ cell fractions by approximately 1.4 fold. Moreover, the average number of CFU-F was 1.5 fold higher in 1.073 versus 1.077 samples; similarly all parameters related to cell expansion were signifi cantly higher in the 1.073 group. In particular, after 4 passages, the average MSC number in the 1.073 group was 1.8 fold higher than in the 1.077 group. Both reagents could isolate MSC showing an expected phenotype (CD45-/CD14-/HLA-DR-/CD200low/CD140low/CD73+/CD90+/ CD105+/GD2+/CD146+) and capable of differentiating into bone (Alizarin-red stain), adipose cells (Oil-red-O stain) and cartilage (Alcian-blue stain ",

Giordano, T. Perrone, D. Pastore, M. Delia, C. De Risi, A. Spina, V. Liso, G. Specchia Hematology (Bari, IT) High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation play an important role in achieving long-term remission in certain groups of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A potential advantage of using mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) is the possibility of harvesting a great number of hematopoietic stem cells capable of more rapid engraftment. The DHAP regimen was thus integrated into various treatment plans tailored for NHL patients as a salvage chemotherapy and mobilizing regimen. A a single injection of pegfi lgrastim has been shown to be equivalent to daily fi lgrastim in enhancing neutrophil recovery after chemotherapy, whereas the experiences with pegfi lgrastim in mobilization of PBSC are limited. The study included 72 patients with NHL (42 follicular and 30 large cells). The mean age was 37 years (range 17-60). Sixtyfour patients (88.9%) had stage III-IV disease. Forty-eight patients (66.7%) had bone marrow involvement. Mobilization chemotherapy regimens were DHAP plus fi lgrastim in 38 patients (52.7%) or pegfi lgrastim in 34 (47.2%). Pegfi lgrastim 6 mg was given subcutaneously on days +6; fi lgrastim 5 microg/ kg/days from day +6. Sixty-fi ve out of 72 patients harvested a median of 12.3 x 10 6 /CD34+ cells (range 2.5-28.9) after a median of 13 days (range 8-16 days), with a single apheresis procedure in 58 (80.6%) cases. Failure to mobilize, defi ned as failure to reach a S206 circulating CD34+ cell count of 10/mcl, occurred in 5 patients (13.2%) in the Filgrastim group and 8 (23.5%) in the pegfi lgrastim group (p=ns). The mean number of CD34+ cells collected was 13.2x10e6/kg in the pegfi lgrastim group and 12.3x10 6 /kg in the fi lgrastim group (p=ns). A median of CD34+ >10 cells/ microl in peripheral blood was reached in 12 days (range 8-14) in fi lgrastim group and in 15 days (range 12-18) in pegfi lgrastim group (p=n.s.). The median duration of CD34+ >10 cells/microl in peripheral blood was 4 days (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) in fi lgrastim group and 7 days (3-12) in pegfi lgrastim group (p<0,05). To date, 65 patients have been autografted with a median of 5.4 x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg (range 2.5-12.9) with no difference in engrafment speed between two groups. The results confi rm the effi cacy and feasibility of PBSC mobilization with chemotherapy and single-dose pegfi lgrastim in patients with non Hodgkin lymphomas. Six mg of pegfi lgrastim after chemotherapy induced an adequate mobilization, whereas dose and schedule in heavily pretreated patients need further investigation.",

Ematologia con Trapianto (Reggio Calabria, IT) The absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) recovery of 500 cells/ ml or more at day 15 (ALC-15) after autologous peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been reported as a powerful, independent prognostic indicator of clinical outcomes in multiple hematologic malignancies. However, few large studies with extensive follow-up are so far available for the analysis of the impact of ALC-15 on the outcome of pts with high risk or relapsed/refractory Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). One hundred four patients (61 males and 43 females) with median age of 49 years (16-73) were include in the study. The median number of previous cycles of chemotherapy was 2. Stem cell mobilization consisted of various types of chemotherapy associated with G-CSF 5 \u00b5g/kg/day. Fortynine out 104 pts (47.1%) were in CR at the transplant time; the others showed an advanced status of disease. The main conditioning regimens were BEAM (78 pts) and Melphalan plus Mithoxantrone (16 pts). Variables analyzed with regard to PFS and OS were age, sex, LNH histotypes, previous number of chemotherapy lines, previous treatment with MabThera, disease status at transplant, number of infusedCD34+ and mononuclear cells, ALC pre-apheresis, ALC-15. Median number of infused CD34+cells was 4.8 x 10 6 /kg (2.0-16.0 ). The median time to reach PMN >500/ml and PLT >30.000 was 11 days (8-21) and 13 days (7-35), respectively. After a median follow-up of 28.1 mo. , 75 (72.1%) and 69 pts (66.3%) were alive and without progression or relapse CR, respectively. Univariate analysis demonstrated a remarkable impact of ALC-15 on OS (0.0051) and PFS (0.0026). Cox regression analysis showed that ALC-15 (p=0.017) and disease status at the time of transplant (p=0.036) were the predictive factors infl uenced OS. In addition, ALC more than 500/mL and a high number of infused CD34+ cell were predictive for longer PFS. Our study confi rms that the number of ALC on day 15 was related with PFS and OS in NHL patients. A threshold number of CD34+ cells should not be the only parameter considered for an adequate PBSC collection, probably the number of lymphocytes should be aimed for as well. Finally, this study may contribute to support the hypothesis that the immune system may be important in the disease control also in the ASCT setting, but to better understand these results, an immunological study is needed to evaluate the various subset of lymphocytes. (6) The purpose was to assess long-term outcome of patients with high risk or relapsed/refractory Lymphoma who have received high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hemopoietic progenitor cells transplant (AHPCT). So far, few large studies with extensive follow-up are available for analysis. Primary end-point was overall (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). OS was defi ned as death from any cause measured from date of transplant and PFS defi ned as disease progression or death from any cause. Data on 138 pts undergoing AHPCT at our institute, from September 1992 through July 2007. The median age of the pts was 48 y (range 14-73). Median time from 1st treatment to AHPCT was 19 mo. (range 4-276). Forty-four pts (31.9%) had Hodgkin Disease (HD), 94 (68.1%) had Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (28 indolent and 64 aggressive). The majority of the pts, 123 (89.2%) were undergoing transplant as part of savage treatment for their refractory/relapsed disease. One hundred-twentyfour pts (82%) were chemosensitive to their last chemotherapy regimen. At time of transplant, 123 pts had responding disease (54 CR, 69 PR), 15 pts had stable/untested relapse/refractory disease. Seventy-seven percent of pts received BEAM as conditioning treatment and the peripheral blood was source of stem cells in 86.2%. Post-AHPCT, 67% (93/138) pts attained CR with an overall response (CR+PR) of 92.8%. Four pts had non-relapse mortality. Of 93 pts attaining CR, 27 relapsed; 5 after attaining CR for >2 y and 1 after attaining CR for> 5 y. The median follow-up of surviving pts was 48 mo. (range 8.0-175.0). Median OS/PFS from ASCT was 10 y/10 y. Five-year OS/PFS was 62.9/58.7% and 10-y OS/PFS was 49.1/42.9% for whole group. Five-years PFS for pts with HD, indolent and aggressive NHL was 61.6%, 48.7% and 60.1% (P=NS), respectively. Coxregression analysis identifi ed only the disease status at transplant having independent impact on OS (P=0.003). Regarding PFS in multivariate analysis, responding disease at transplant and female sex were associated with a better prognosis. These data provide a long follow-up for pts receiving AHPCT for high risk and relapsed/refractory lymphoma. In particular, long-term OS/PFS is possible following AHPCT for indolent lymphoma. Overall, the type of lymphoma does not affect the results of the transplant. In addition, the disease status at the time of the transplant and sex affect outcome with the best results seen in responding and in female pts.",

Pioltelli AO San Gerardo (Monza, IT) In the autologous setting BEAM is the most widely used conditioning regimen to treat lymphoid prolypherative disorders, but in recent years the availability of BCNU (carmustine), which needs an alcoholic solvent to be infused intravenously, seems hampered by technical problems in its production. CCNU (lomustine) another nitrosurea, available for oral administration, is the most logical drug to overcome these diffi culties and we test the feasibility of such a variance at the BEAM schedule. From 1995 to 2008 we uniformly treated 127 patients (74 females S207 and 53 males) with poor prognosis lymphoma, both non-Hodgkin's (NHL) and Hodgkin's (HD), with a modifi ed BEAM using lomustine instead of carmustine (lomustine 200mg/m\u00b2 on day 1, etoposide 200mg/m\u00b2 + cytarabine 200mg/m\u00b2 b.d. on days 2-5 and melphalan 140mg/m\u00b2 on day 6) before autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). In our series the overall median age was 45.42 years (range 16.6 -68.52), 45.79 (range 16.6 -68.52) in the males group and 45. 17 (16.8 -68.04 ) in the females one. Fifty-seven patients were in complete remission (RC) at transplantation, 36 patients had a partial response to previous therapies (RP) and 34 a progressive disease. The median number of CD34+ cells infused was 5,04x10 6 /Kg (range 1,5-21,2). The median time to neutrophil (>500x10 6 /L) and platelet (>20x10 9 /L) engraftment was 11 days (range 8-25) and 14 days (range 6-35) respectively. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was given to 105 patients (83%). Oral mucositis was observed in 75 patients (59%), 32 had grade II (25%), 22 grade III (17%) and 16 patients grade IV (12%). Forty-seven (37%) patients were supported with parenteral nutrition. Fiftysix (44%) patients had grade I-II diarrhea, 5 (4%) grade III. No grade IV diarrhea was observed. Fever of unknown origin (FUO) was observed in 56 (44%), in 32 patients (25%) the infectious agent was identifi ed. Three patients had a bacterial pulmonitis. At a median follow-up of 3.66 years (range 0.1-9.4 ) the overall survival (OS) is 72% and disease free survival (DFS) is 66%. The most frequent cause eof death was disease progression, two patients (1.5%) developed an acute leukemia and four patients (3%) a fatal infection. Our data seem demonstrate that lomustine can be safely used as part of BEAM with outcomes comparable with those reported for the original schedule. (2) (table) prior to the initiation of salvage chemotherapy on EFS and OS was evaluated using multivariate regression analysis. Primary refractory HL (PR-HL) is defi ned as patients who failed induction chemotherapy i.e. only partial response (PR), no response (NR) / stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD) or relapsing within 3 months. Results: 29 male (50%), 29 female (50%), Median age at diagnosis 15 years (6 to 20) and at ASCT 17 years (14 to 21). Prior to salvage chemotherapy, stages I:II:III:IV were 4:20:10:24, bulky disease (\u22658 cm) in 17 (29%), involvement of mediastinum in 39 (67%), spleen in 12 (21%) and extranodal involvement in 25 (43%) patients. Relapsed disease in 24 (41%) and PR-HL in 34 (59%) patient. 39 patients (67%) had tissue confi rmation at relapse /progression. ESHAP was used as salvage; median of 3 cycles. Post ASCT, overall response in 48 patients (83%); complete response (CR) / CR-u in 41 (71%), PR in 7 (12%), NR / SD in1 (2%) and PD in 9 (15%) patients. Three patients achieved CR after XRT post HDC. No treatment related death. Combining all the CRs, total of 44 (76%) patients achieved CR. Median follow up from diagnosis is 63 months and from ASCT 43 months. Currently 14 patients (24% of 58 patients and 32% of 44) who achieved CR had relapsed and 31 (53%) in CR. 22 (38%) had died, 21 due to disease and one CR patient died of drowning. 5 (9%) are alive with disease. OS is 62%. Median OS has not reached yet. Thirty-one (53%) patients had an event and EFS is only 47%. Probability of EFS and OS is 45% and 55% at 11 years. Negative prognostic factor for OS was presence of B symptom at relapse / progression, P = 0.032 (probability of survival 27% vs. 60%, P = 0.0025). Despite high CR, EFS is only 47%. Conclusion: We have reported high response rate with 76% CR. Almost quarter of these patients with CR has relapsed. EFS is only 47%. B symptom at relapse was a signifi cant negative prognostic factor for OS. Better treatment strategies are needed for this group of patients. A. Clavert, E. Brissot, V. Dubruille, B. Mahe, T.

Mohty CHU H\u00f4tel-Dieu (Nantes, FR) Allo-SCT can provide a potentially curative graft-versus-lymphoma effect. However, such benefi t is usually offset by a signifi cant incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM), especially in advanced and/or elderly patients. With this background, RIC regimens for allo-SCT have arisen as an attractive modality in patients with NHL, but the role of RIC allo-SCT in aggressive B cell NHL remains a matter of debate because of a higher incidence of disease relapse/progression. This single centre study aimed to assess the potential benefi t of a tandem auto-allo-SCT approach as salvage therapy in 23 consecutive patients with relapsed or transformed aggressive B cell NHL. Median age at time of allo-SCT was 55 (range, 44-65) y. NHL histology at diagnosis included 5 cases (22%) of DLBCL, 12 (52%) follicular NLH, and 6 (26%) other subtypes. Aggressive transformation was documented in 18 patients (78%; 26% of primary and 52% of secondary transformation). Patients received a median of 2 (range, 1-4) lines of previous chemotherapy regimens prior to allo-SCT, and all patients (n=21; 91%) but 2, could actually proceed to auto-SCT prior to allo-SCT. At time of allo-SCT, 9 patients (39%) were in fi rst CR, 6 patients (26%) were beyond fi rst CR and 8 (35%) in PR. Median times between diagnosis and allo-SCT and auto-SCT and allo-SCT were 25 (range, 7-131) and 4 (range, 2.4-71) m. respectively. The RIC regimen consisted of Fludarabine, Busulfan and ATG in 20 patients (87%) and Fludarabine and low dose TBI (2 Gy.) in 3 patients (13%). After RIC allo-SCT, engraftment was achieved in all patients. With a median follow-up of 38 S208 (range, 3-86) m., 13 patients had grade 2-4 acute GVHD (56%) and 10 patients had extensive chronic GVHD (48%). Overall, 9 patients died (3 from progression, 2 from acute GVHD, 2 multiorgan failures, and 2 other causes). The incidence of NRM was 26%, (95%CI, 8-44%). At last follow-up, 13 patients (57%) were in sustained CR. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of progressionfree and overall survival rates were 51% and 64% respectively at 4 years. We conclude that a tandem auto-RIC allo-SCT approach is a potentially effi cient salvage therapy for relapsed or transformed aggressive B cell NHL, with a relatively low toxicity, likely overcoming the poor prognosis usually associated with this phenotype. These results can also likely be improved with strategies aiming to enhance the GVL effect (e.g. inclusion of Rituximab as part of the RIC regimen, and/or as maintenance therapy).",

Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have been used trying to reduce this, while preserving the establishment of a graft-vs-tumor effect (GVT). Few homogeneus series have been reported focused on MCL. We report the outcome of consecutive MCL pts who received a peripheral blood allo-RIC from an HLA-identical sibling donor. The RIC consisted in fl udarabine 125-150 mg/m\u00b2 from day -8 to -4 and melphalan 80-140 mg/m\u00b2 on days -3 and -2. Rituximab 375 mg/m\u00b2 was added to RIC in 8 pts on days -9, +1, +8 and +15. GVHD prophylaxis consisted in cyclosporine+methotrexat he. Cyclosporine tappering was anticipated at day +50 if mixed chimerism or persistent disease were present. Results: Between 2000 and 2008, 21 MCL pts were included: Median age 56 years (40-68), 16 males, median pre-alloRIC treatment lines 2 (1-4), 3 previous autoHSCT. Before allo-RIC, 15 pts (71%) were in 1st or later CR, 6 had chemo-sensitive PR (29%). Median CD34+/kg infused cells were 5,8x10 6 (2,5-10,8) and 2,0x10 8 (0,7-4,1) CD3+lymphocytes/kg. All pts engrafted reaching ANC>500 on day +16(13-20) and platelets >20.000 on day +12(8-32). Early toxicity(<day+100) included grade 3-4 mucositis in 9(43%), febrile neutropenia in 7 (33%) and bacterial infections in 4 (19%) with 2 deaths(1 herpetic encephalitis and 1 refractory acute GVHD). There were 2 additional deaths (due to chronic GVHD with infectious complications). NRM at 1 year was 19,8%. Complete donor T-cell chimerism was present at day +30 in 75% of evaluated pts and in 100% of pts at day +90. Grade II-IV acute GVHD ocurred in 30%, with 15% grade III-IV. Chronic GVHD affected 14/18 pts(78%), extensive in 7(39%). Only 1 patient (in PR after 2 treatment lines) relapsed, after +6,5y. The 5-year estimated EFS and OS were both 80% (CI95%=63-97%) and 17 pts remain alive in CR with a median follow-up of 47 months. Age \u226560 was the only prognostic factor for OS: 43% vs 100% for those younger (p<0,001) (FIGURE 1). Conclusions: Allo-RIC with FLU-MEL in MCL pts offers a good toxicity profi le, with high engraftment rate and good long term disease-free survival, specially in pts younger than 60. The very low long-term relapse rate seen in the context of a high incidence of chronic GVHD supports the sensitivity of MCL to a GVT effect.",

A single center experience C. Tecchio, F. Randon, G. Quaresmini, F. Frattini, A. Andreini, R. Di Bella, M. Sorio, F. Benedetti Policlinico G.B. Rossi (Verona, IT) Background: A minor part of patients affected by Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) fail to respond or relapse after primary conventional treatments. Although high-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) is the standard of care, long-term results and late toxicity still remain unsatisfactory. Objective: To retrospectively analyze the response rate, freedom from treatment failure (FFTF), long-term outcome and late toxicity in a series of 71 consecutive HL patients treated with high-dose sequential chemotherapy (HDSCT) and autologous PBSCT following relapse or failure to conventional therapies. Patients and Methods: From march 1986 to october 2008, 71 patients affected by relapsed or refractory HL were recruited to received HDSCT (cyclophosphamide 7g/m\u00b2, day 0, followed by PBSC harvest; methotrexate 8 g/m\u00b2 and vincristine 1.4 g/m\u00b2, +20; vepesid 2 g/m\u00b2, +28; melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2 and mitoxantrone 60 mg/m\u00b2 +48-50) and autologous PBSCT following second-line therapy. Eligibility criteria were age between 14 and 65 years, adequate organ function, biopsy-proven relapsed or refractory HD. FFTF was defi ned as the time from autologous PBSCT to relapse, assessed either by CT scan criteria and/or by FDG-positron emission tomography. Results: Patients characteristics are reported in table 1. Among the 71 patients enrolled, 68 are currently evaluable (96%) since 3 (4%) could not complete the treatment schedule due to disease progression. PBSC harvest was successful in all cases (median harvest 5.6x10 6 /kg). Complete response-rate was 57/68 (84%), partial response-rate 8/68 (12%). One patient experienced progression, transplantrelated mortality rate was 2/68 (3%). With a median follow-up of 51.5 months (6-221), FFTF was 33/65 (50.7%). Among patients in complete remission, 2 (6%) died from secondary neoplasia, 4 (12%) from secondary myelodisplasia/leukemia. Overall, 11 patients (16.5%) experienced a secondary neoplasia, 3 (4.6%) severe cardiotoxicity, 2 (3%) severe epatotoxicity. No life-threatening infections were observed. B symptoms and stage III-IV were predictors of an unfavourable outcome (p 0.001 and 0.03). Conclusions: HDSCT with autologous PBSCT appears as a feasible therapy able to rescue about 50% of relapsed or refractory patients. Although devoid of signifi cant early toxicity, this S209 treatment presents a signifi cant late toxicity. Further efforts are awaited to improve this treatment approach in order to avoid late adverse effects.",

Khattry Tata Memorial Center (Mumbai, IN) Background: BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, ara-c and melphalan) is commonly used high dose regimen for Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's (NHL) lymphomas. LACE (lomustine, ara-c, cyclophosphamide and etoposide) is a well tolerated and effective regimen. We retrospectively compared the two regimens for early toxicity. Methods: Patients of HD and NHL with primary refractory or relapsed disease from August 1994-August 2008 were included. BEAM (carmustine-300 mg/m\u00b2 x 1 day(d), etoposide 200mg/m\u00b2 x 4 d, ara-c-200 mg/m\u00b2 12 hourly x 4 d and melphalan-140 mg/m\u00b2 x 1d) was used between August 1994-March 2007. April 2007 onwards, all patients received LACE (lomustine-200 mg/ m\u00b2 x 1d, etoposide 1000mg/m\u00b2 x1d, ara-c 2000 mg/m\u00b2 x 2d and cyclophosphamide 1800mg/m\u00b2 for 3d).Oral mucositis (OM) and diarrhea were graded according to WHO scale. Neutrophil engraftment (NE) and platelet engraftment (PE) were defi ned according to standard defi nition. Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver was recorded according to Seattle criteria. Results: Twenty-nine patients received BEAM and 15 received LACE with comparable median age (26y Vs 30y). Thirty-one patients had HD (BEAM-21, LACE-10) while 13 had NHL . Six patients in BEAM had chemorefractory relapse compared to 2 in LACE. The body mass index and serum albumin level at the time of transplant were comparable. The mononuclear count (MNC) of the graft was comparable (BEAM-5 x 10 8 /kg, LACE-6.1 x 10 8 /kg), though all patients in the LACE group received PBSC grafts (100% Vs 70%; P=0.018). Grade 3 and 4 OM was more commonly seen in BEAM (60% Vs 6%; P=0.04) and more patients in BEAM received parenteral nutrition (69% Vs 13%; P=0.0005). Seven patients in LACE did not develop any OM (P=0.001). The maximum grade and duration of diarrhea were comparable. No patient in LACE developed VOD compared to 4 in BEAM. Sepsis leading to death occurred more frequently in BEAM (17% Vs 6%; P=0.462). The median days to NE (10 Vs 12; P=0.001) and PE (12.5 vs 19; P=0.002) were shorter in LACE. This difference remained statistically signifi cant even after excluding patients who did not receive PBSC grafts in BEAM. No patient in either group developed pulmonary toxicity attributable to chemotherapy. The complete response rates at day 100 were comparable (BEAM-58%, LACE-60%). Conclusion: LACE is better tolerated than BEAM in lymphomas. The follow up in the LACE group is short to compare survival rates.",

Forty pts (88.9%) had febrile neutropenia and 16 pts (35.6%) had microbiologically documented sepsis. Grade 3-4 hepatic toxicity developed in 11 pts (24.4%) and grade 3-4 renal toxicity in 2 pts (4.4%). Grade 3-4 cardiac toxicity developed in 3 pts (6.7%): 2 pts had new symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy and 1 pt had aggravation of preexisting dilated cardiomyopathy. Transplantrelated mortality (TRM) occurred in 4 pts (8.9%): all resulted from uncontrolled infection. Pts with low baseline serum albumin level (<4.0g/dL) or low baseline hemoglobin (Hb) level (<9.0g/dL) had signifi cantly shorter EFS (P=0.029, P=0.001, respectively) or OS (P=0.004, P<0.001, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, these variables maintained independent prognostic value. Low baseline Hb level (<9.0g/dL) was also S210 associated with signifi cantly longer duration of hospitalization (P=0.034) and higher incidence of TRM (P=0.012). In conclusion, HDC using NEAM with ASCT demonstrated considerable effi cacy with relatively modest toxicity as a salvage treatment of chemosensitive relapsed or primary refractory aggressive NHL pts. Baseline serum albumin and Hb levels were independent prognostic factors in this group.",

Fern\u00e1ndez de Larrea, C. Mart\u00ednez, A. L\u00f3pez-Guillermo, M. Rovira, F. Fern\u00e1ndez-Avil\u00e9s, E. Montserrat, E. Carreras Hospital Clinic (Barcelona, ES) High-dose chemotherapy (HDT) and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) are considered the standard of treatment for most patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Response to pre-transplant salvage chemotherapy remains the most important prognostic factor in these patients. However, the optimal salvage regimen has not yet been established. We retrospectively analysed the effi cacy and toxicity of MINE (ifosfamide, vinorelbine, etoposide) alternated with ESHAP (etoposide, high dose cytarabine, cisplatin, metylprednisolone) in the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL after fi rstline chemotherapy. Sixty-one patients (median age 36 years, range 18-63; 31F/30M) who either did not achieved a complete response (CR) (partial response, PR n=13, or refractory disease n=17) or relapsed (n=31) after ABVD based chemotherapy were included in this study. After MINE-ESHAP (median number of cycles 4, range 1-6), 25 patients (41%) achieved a CR, 23 (38%) a PR, four (7%) a stable disease (SD) and eight (13%) progressed for an overall response rate (ORR) of 79%. In the univariate analysis, response to fi rst-line chemotherapy was the most important prognostic factor for response to MINE-ESHAP (ORR 70% for patients with PR, SD or refractory HL vs 87% for patients relapsing after fi rst CR, p>0.0001). Grade 3-4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurred in 26 (46%), 23 (40%), and 22 (38%) patients. Eleven episodes of grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities (infectious n=8, renal n=2, etoposide allergic reaction, n=1) were observed. No toxic deaths were seen. Adequate peripheral blood stem cell collection was achieved in 56 of 58 (96.6%) mobilized patients. After MINE/ESHAP, two patients with progressive disease received only palliative care and an additional patient died of a HL-unrelated disease. As a result, 58 patients eventually received HDT and ASCT. After ASCT, 48 patients achieved CR and three PR. Overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) after all treatments were 68% and 61% at 5 years, respectively. Patients who did not respond to MINE-ESHAP had signifi cantly lower OS and EFS that those in CR or PR (46% vs 74%; and 35% vs 69%, respectively). In conclusion, MINE-ESHAP results in a high response rate with acceptable toxicity in patients with HL having failed ABVD. Intensifi cation with HDT and ASCT results in a high remission rate and long-term EFS, particularly in patients who respond to MINE-ESHAP.",

Reti, A. Sipos, E. Torbagyi, A. Tremmel, T. Masszi St. Istvan and St. Laszlo Hospital of Budapest (Budapest, HU) The purpose of this study was to assess prognostic factors of overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) of patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma after autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). Data were reviewed of 132 consecutive patients 1994 and 2008. Patients caracteristics was 81 men and 51 women, median age at ASCT 29 years (18-60), stage (Ann-Arbor) at diagnosis: stage I n=5 (4%), stage II n=60 (60%), stage III n=28 (25%), stage IV n=21 (18%), bulky disease at diagnosis n=26 (20%), median time to ASCT 30 month ( 9-130 ), primer therapy refractory n=41 (36%), relapsed < 1 year n=34 (30%), relapsed > 1 year n=38 (34%), tumor status at ASCT: complete remission (CR) n=27 (37%), residual tumor n=46 (63%), type of stem cell graft: periferial blood stem cell n=108 (82%), bone marrow n=18 (14%), mixed n=6 (4%), conditioning: BEAM n=111 (84%), Bu/Cy n=21 (16%), median follow up from ASCT 501 day (6-4526). Before the year 2006 tumor stage at ASCT was defi ned with computer tomography, after 2006 with positron emission tomography (PET-CT). Results: Three-year OS/DFS was 82/76%. Three-year OS/DFS was in the primer therapy refractory group (PT) 74/62%, in the group relapsed < 1 year (ER) 79/74% and in the group relapsed > 1 year (LR) 100/94%. Three-year OS/DFS was in the nonbulky group 82/73% and in the bulky group 81/46%. According to CR and to residual tumor group at ASCT the three-year OS/DFS was 100/80% and 73/65% respectively. 96% of the PT, 56% of the ER and 24% of the LR group had residual tumor at ASCT. Median time to progression after ASCT was 305day (22-745). Allo-PBSCT (sibling) after ASCT were in 7 and MUD PBSCT in 5 cases because of disease progression. Conclusion: Post-ASCT, there was no signifi cant difference neither in OS nor DFS between the early ( I, II ) and late ( III-IV ) stage groups. One of the reasons can be the incorrect stage at diagnosis not defi ned by PET-CT. There is signifi cantly better OS and DFS in LR than ER and PT groups. Patients without bulky disease showed similar OS and not signifi cantly better DFS ( p=0,091 ) than patients with bulky. There was significant difference both in OS and DFS between the patients with residual disease at ASCT and patients in CR. Early PET-CT should be done to defi ne PT group of patients. Theese patients need early intesifi cation of chemotherapy followed by ASCT to improve OS and DFS. In case of relapse/progression after ASCT allo-PBSCT could be curative. A. Czyz, A. Lojko, L. Gil, D. Drozdowska, D. Dytfeld, A. Nowicki, M. Kozlowska, K. Sawinski, M. Komarnicki University of Medical Sciences (Poznan, PL) Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHCT) is considered the treatment of choice for patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). However, the optimal therapy for primary refractory disease and chemoresistant relapse has not been established. We retrospectively evaluated the longterm outcome of 156 pts, median age 28 (16-59) years with advanced HL (stage IIB-IVB) treated with autoHCT between 1992 and 2007 in our department. The identifi ed indications for autoHCT included: partial response to 1st line therapy (75 pts), relapse (53 pts), primary refractoriness to chemotherapy (8 pts) and high risk disease at diagnosis (17 pts). The disease state at transplant was: CR (64 pts), PR (74 pts) and less then PR (9 pts). All patients were conditioned with modifi ed BEAM regimen (BCNU 300 mg/m\u00b2, etoposid 800 mg/m\u00b2, cytarabine 6000 mg/m\u00b2, melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2 and dexamethasone 168 mg/m\u00b2). Eleven pts were treated with tandem autoHCT and received different preparative regimen before second transplant. The source of progenitor cells was PB (79 pts), BM (65 pts) and BM plus PB (12 pts). The median follow-up of the living patients is 65 (12-196) months. There was 6% (9/156) early deaths due to infections (8 pts) and primary graft failure (1 patient). OS was 82% (95% CI 62-100), 70% and 44% (95% CI 7-80) at 7 years for patients transplanted due to partial response to 1st line therapy, relapse and primary refractory disease respectively estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. The 7-yrs DFS was 68% (95% CI 51-86), 38% and 43% (95% CI 0-88) for these three groups respectively. The 7-yrs DFS for a subgroup of 6 pts with chemorefractory relapse was 22% (95% CI 0-59). The pts with partial response to 1st line therapy as the indication for autoHCT had a superior OS (p=0.017) and DFS (p=0.014) to the other group. The 16/17 pts with high risk disease transplanted in CR1 live in remission, one died due to relapse. The secondary malignancies developed in 5/156 (3%) pts, including 3 MDS/AML, 1 NHL and 1 solid tumor. We conclude that high proportion of patients with advanced HL who achieved only partial response to standard treatment can be cured with autoHCT following modifi ed BEAM regimen. The outcome of pts with relapse and primary refractory disease is inferior, but approximately 40% of patients can achieve long lasting response. The survival of pts with chemorefractory relapse is not satisfactory. High dose Chemotherapy and auto-SCT is used for consolidation of relapsed/refractory B-NHL after response to salvage treatment. The ideal salvage protocol for stem cell mobilization and cytoreduction remains controversial. Here we report data of a retrospective analysis from a single center regarding the Overall Response Rate (ORR), the stem cell mobilisation, and the toxicity with regard to the salvage chemotherapy used. Methods: The following protocols were used: Ifosfamide, Epirubicin and VP16 (IEV), q21; R-IEV: addition of Rituximab (R) 375 mg/m\u00b2. Cisplatin, Cytarabin, and Dexamethason (D-HAP) q21; R-DHAP: addition of R. 375 mg/m\u00b2. G-CSF was given at a dose of 5-10micg/kg. (R-)DHAP: 61 patients (pat.) were treated between 9/98 and 4/08. 32/61 pat. received R.. Pat. suffered from B-cell NHL (25 DLBCL, 12 FL, 12 MCL, 12 other NHL). 21 pat. had refractory disease, and 17 early relapse. (R-)DHAP was administered as 2nd line therapy in 34, and \u2265 3rd line therapy in 27 pat. 52 DHAP cycles were given in 29 pat. and 68 R-DHAP cycles in 32 pat.. (R-)IEV: 82 pat. were treated between 12/97 and 11/03. 14/82 received R.. Pat. suffered from B-cell NHL (26 DLBCL, 44 FL, 12 pat. other NHL). 17 had refractory disease, and 35 relapsed early. (R-)IEV was given as 2nd line therapy in 59, and \u2265 3 rd line therapy in 23 pat.. 142 IEV cycles were given in 68 pat. and 30 R-IEV cycles in 13 pat.",

Stem cells were mobilized in 94.4% after (R-)DHAP compared to 94.5% after (R-)IEV. Transfusions were needed after 29% of (R-)DHAP cycles.

Conclusion: In both groups the addition of R neither infl uenced stem cell mobilisation nor the frequency of neutropenic fever. The main toxicity in treatment with (R-)IEV was neutropenic fever and sepsis. In the (R-)DHAP group the main toxicity was acute renal failure.

Mohty CHU H\u00f4tel-Dieu (Nantes, FR) Transformed aggressive non Hodgkin's lymphoma (TANHL) has a poor outcome with conventional therapies. Patients with adverse prognostic factors or who didn't achieve complete remission after initial treatment may benefi t from intensive chemotherapy approaches. However, the role of autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) in TANHL is not yet well defi ned. This single centre report investigated the potential benefi t of a single or double auto-SCT in 25 patients with TANHL. Median age at time of fi rst auto-SCT was 55 (range, 32-65) years. TANHL histology was confi rmed in all cases (22 cases of transformed follicular NHL and 3 cases of Richter following chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Patients received a median of 1 (range, 1-3) line of previous chemotherapy regimen prior to the fi rst auto-SCT. Among the 25 patients, 14 patients (56%) received a single auto-SCT, while 11 (44%) received 2 auto-SCT. Median time between diagnosis of transformation and fi rst auto-SCT was 4.6 (range, 2.6-20.1) months. At time of fi rst auto-SCT, 10 patients (40%) were in fi rst complete remission (CR) and 15 patients (60%) in partial remission (PR). The high dose chemotherapy administered prior to auto-SCT consisted of Carmustine, Etoposide, Aracytine and Melphalan (BEAM) for the 14 patients undergoing a single auto-SCT. In the double auto-SCT group, patients received Novantrone-Aracytine followed by BEAM (n=7; 28%), Novantrone-Aracytine followed by TBI/Cy (n=3; 12%) and BEAM followed by TBI/Cy in one case (4%). In this series, the median follow-up is 23 (range, 3-63) months. Overall, 3 patients died, all from disease progression. All of these 3 patients could only achieve PR after the fi rst and second auto-SCT. At last follow-up, the remaining alive 21 patients (84%) were in CR and 1 (4%) in PR. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival was 88% at 4 years after auto-SCT, with this being comparable between patients who received a single auto-SCT versus those who received a double auto-SCT. These results suggest that high-dose chemotherapy and auto-SCT is an effi cient therapy for TANHL. Moreover, double auto-SCT is feasible in this group of patients without any added toxicity. However, it remains unclear whether the double auto-SCT approach may result in any long term increased effi cacy. A. Pivkova, S. Genadieva Stavrik, Z. Stojanoski, L. Cevreska, O. Karanfi lski, V. Milenkov, B. Georgievski University Hematology Hospital (Skopje, MK) Cyclophosphamide (CTX) 3gr/m\u00b2 plus G-CSF 10mcg/m\u00b2 is commonly used regimen for mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) to support high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies, although this schedule is associated with higher rate of hemorrhagic cystitis, prolonged neutropenia, infective complications and other toxicities. Therefore we evaluated the effi ciency of VP-16 (1 gr/ m\u00b2) +G-CSF 10mcg/kg for PBPC mobilization, as possibility to lower the underlying toxicities, since the optimal dose for CTX and VP-16 as mobilizers of PBPC is still unknown. We analyzed 55 patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies treated with HDT/ASCT. The patients were mobilized either with cyclophosphamide 3gr/m\u00b2 + G-CSF 10mcg/kg starting from day 5 of chemotherapy regimen or VP-16 (1 gr/m\u00b2)+G-CSF 10mcg/ kg. Both regimens were effective in the progenitor cell mobilization and almost 84% of analyzed patients reached at least 2x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells with median 3 (ranges 1-6) apheresis procedures. Only two patients with HD failed mobilization in the CTX+G-CSF group and none in the group mobilized with VP-16+G-CSF. Patients mobilized with VP-16+G-CSF revealed less toxicity; lower duration in hospital days (6 vs 10, p<0.001), lower infective complications (30% vs 69%, p<0.001), less supportive treatment including Plt transfusions (2% vs 17%, p<0.004), days on parenteral antibiotics after mobilization (0 vs 5 days, p<0.001). We can conclude that these two regimens are equally effective in terms of PBPC mobilization in patients with lymphoproliferative diseases, but intermediate VP-16+G-CSF schedule revealed less toxicity, lower hospital days, less supportive care. These results encourage the study of such schedule in a randomized trial, as well as evaluating its role in the onset of the posttransplant secondary malignancies.",

Preda, P.R. Rafaniello, L. Orlando, D. Laszlo, G. Martinelli European Institute of Oncology (Milan, IT) Autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is a well established treatment in both Hodgkin's (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Chemosensitivity, usually assessed with computed tomography (CT), is a major prognostic factor in ASCT; Positron emission tomography (PET) has been proposed for evaluation of chemosensitivity before ASCT. We present our fi ndings with pre-ASCT PET and CT in HD and NHL patients (pts). Forty-nine pts (22 NHL (11 diffuse large B-cell, 8 mantle cell, 2 follicular, 1 Burkitt) and 27 HD) were evaluated in this retrospective study. Median age at diagnosis was 36 years (range 18-67); 22 pts were stage I-II, 27 pts stage III-IV; B-symptoms were present in 53% of pts, and 23 pts had bulky disease. 41 pts were considered for ASCT because of relapse (18 pts; median time to relapse 14 months (range 2-64)) or refractory disease after induction therapy (23 pts); eight pts with NHL (6 mantle cell and 2 diffuse large B-cell) received ASCT in fi rst complete remission according to internal guidelines. Conditioning consisted of BEAM in 37 pts, Mitoxanthrone-Melphalan in 9 pts, high-dose Zevalin in 2 pts, standard-dose Zevalin-Busulphan-Melphalan in 1 patient; Rituximab was added to conditioning in 20 NHL pts. Median time between PET and ASCT was 15 days (range 2-36). Pre-ASCT PET was negative in 30 pts (61%) and positive in 19 pts (39%); pre-ASCT CT showed a partial or complete response in 32 pts (74%) and a stable or progressive disease in 11 pts (26%), while 6 pts did not perform pre-ASCT CT. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 years were 69% and 66%, respectively. Pre-ASCT PET and CT were statistically signifi cant for both OS (p.004 and p.006, respectively) and PFS (p.000 and p.000, respectively). Considering pts by histology, pre-ASCT PET showed a defi nite prognostic role in NHL (OS p.0004; PFS p.0001) but not in HD (OS p.6409; PFS p.067), where pre-ASCT CT was superior (OS p.036, PFS p.0000)). Considering PFS in all pts, pre-ASCT PET positive and negative predictive values (PPV; NPV) were 63% and 90%, respectively, pre-ASCT TC PPV and NPV were 91% and 87%. Multivariate analysis showed pre-ASCT PET as the only prognostic factor for OS, but not for PFS. Our data showed a prognostic role of pre-ASCT PET in pts with NHL, while its role is less defi nite in HD pts, probably due to a small cohort. The use of PET before ASCT in HD still needs further investigation.",

Benedetti, F. Papineschi, A. Starita, M. Petrini University of Pisa (Pisa, IT) Objective: Detection of prognostic factors in Non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients trough an application of a partitioning recursive algorithm. Methods: Dataset comprised 651 patients affected by NHL treated from 1990 to 2005, divided in High grade (HG NHL, n=343; 52,7%) and Low grade Lymphoma (LG NHL, n= 308; 47,3%). Only responsive patients were considered. We evaluated as variables for algorithm analysis: age, sex, histological subtype, IPI status and bone marrow involvement, treatment approaches (poli-chemotherapy, mono-chemoterapy, radiotherapy, surgery, purine based chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, transplant approach, oral chemotherapy), response to therapy, previous successful treatments, previous relapses, previous failed therapies. Data were analyzed with the Hypothesis testing Classifi er System algorithm (HCS), which belongs to the family of recursive partitioning algorithms. Such an algorithm is thought to splits data in different subgroups that behave in a different way. It works starting from data and utilized them to create all the possible combinations of splits available. Among them it chooses the best one by statistics and fi nally applies it to patients' datasets. For these reason it is defi ned as \"partitioning\". Afterwards the algorithm starts again the analysis on the subset previously detected and that's because it is called \"recursive\". Results: The most important split was found between patients in partial remission (PR) and complete remission (CR). Among PR patients, two subsets with worse prognosis were found: both comprised patients with HG NHL not treated with monoclonal antibodies and/or transplant. Therefore the remaining PRs patients, treated by transplant approach and immunotherapy, had a better outcome. In CR group two subset (different only for age) with HD NHL diagnosis not treated by oral chemo alone were detected. Those patients, who had a better outcome, had been treated aggressively with polichemotherapy and/or autologous transplant. Differences between detected groups are statistically signifi cant with p.value 0,03 maximum. Conclusion: Application of computer science analysis to NHL patients has been successfull. Quality of response emerged as the most important prognostic factor but among both PRs and CRs patients those with better outcome had HG NHL diagnosis and were treated by autologous transplantation or/and immunotherapy. This analysis confi rms data available about transplant as a good approach for NHL patients. Patients and Methods: After searching registry, we identifi ed 21 patients with T-cell NHL, in whom FDG-PET was performed after ASCT. The usefulness of FDG-PET study for predicting patients' outcomes, including event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), were re-assessed and compared with conventional procedures including computed tomography (CT). Results: In 21 patients, there were 14 patients who had concordant results from both CT and PET result; 5 patients had complete response (CR) at CT and negative PET result, 9 patients had Not-CR at CT and positive PET result. Seven of twenty-one patients (33.3%) showed discordant response estimation between CT image and PET study. In these patients, post-ASCT PET detected additional abnormal uptake in 4 of 7 patients, which suggesting new pathologic lesions and not reported by CT images; two cases of new extranodal involvements and two cases of nodal involvements. All of 4 patients showed relapse or progression within 4.2 months. Remaining 3 patients showed negative PET result, although their lesions were evaluated as Not-CR according to CT images, 1 of 3 patients has shown disease free status of 72.1 months and 2 of 3 patients had shown relapse or progression within 2.0 months. When response was re-assessed with CT images, post-ASCT response did not correlated with patients' survivals in 7 patients (33.3%) but, with PET study, post-ASCT response did not correlated with patients' survivals in 4 patients (19.0%). According to PET results, the 2-year EFS rate was 60.0 \u00b1 18.2% in patients with negative post-PET result and 15.4 \u00b1 10.0% in patients with positive post-PET result (P=0.026). The 2-year OS rate was 70.0 \u00b1 18.2% in patients with negative post-PET result and 23.1 \u00b1 11.7% in patients with positive post-PET result (P=0.062). Conclusion: post-ASCT PET results after ASCT had substantial improvement in response estimation and patient's outcomes in T-cell NHL. Although routine PET study in T-NHLs is currently not recommended, it seems to have signifi cant benefi t in prediction of patients' prognosis after ASCT as it does in B-cell NHL.",

Schieder, T. Zabelina, U. Bacher, F. Ayuk, C. Wolschke, A. Zander, N. Kr\u00f6ger University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf (Hamburg, DE) Dose-reduced conditioning followed by alloHSCT is a potentially curative therapy in B non Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). However, the number(no) of patients(pts) who experienced an early relapse is signifi cant, and the achievement of a prolonged second remission is usually a rare event. Post transplant immunotherapy with DLI to induce graft versus lymphoma (GVL) effect is a reasonable option to prevent or treat relapse, however the risk of graft versus host disease (GvHD) is high. Since B-cells might serve as antigen presenting cells to induce GvHD, additional B-cell depleting therapy with monoclonal antibody (antiCD20) might reduce the risk of GvHD while inducing additional cytotoxicity to B-cells originating from B-cell lymphoma. In the current pilot study we investigated the feasibility of a combined Rtx plus DLI therapy after alloHSCT to prevent (n=10) or treat relapse (n=2). Twelve consecutive pts, affected by B cell malignancies and transplanted between July 2002 and February 2007, were included in this study. The median age at alloHSCT was 58 ys (range 27-64). The conditioning regimen consisted of melphalan, fl udarabine and ATG (n=9) or busulfan, fl udarabine (n=3). Donors were HLA identical sibling in the half of the group, with one HLA mismatched-unrelated donor. Seven pts were not in disease remission at the time of HSCT. The indication of Rtx-DLI was prophylaxis of relapse in all but two pts. The schedule of this approach was: 4 consecutive weekly Rtx(375mg/mq), started at a median time of 194 dy from HSCT(range 77-895).DLI in single dose was administered after Rtx (median dose 1x10 6 /Kg), without ongoing immunosuppression and signs of GVHD. Three pts developed acuteGVHD after DLI, 2 gastro-intestinal and 1 cutaneous, whereas 6/12 pts experienced chronic GVHD, limited in all but two. Two cases of bacterial and one case of Pneumocystis jirovecij pneumonia (PJP) were diagnosed, in 3 different pts, and 2 died in complete remission due to infection. The median no of B lymphocytes before and after Rtx was 42/\u00b5L and 4 respectively, and the difference is not statistically signifi cant in terms of incidence of infection (\u00b52 test). After a median follow up of 21 mo (range 4-37) from the 1st Rtx infusion, 8/12 pts are alive at the last follow-up, six of them without disease, whereas 2 pts died due to progressive disease. Rtx and DLI post alloHSCT seems to be a safe and effective approach to prevent early relapse in B malignancies in complete remission after alloHSCT. (1) (1)",

            "text": "Background: Standard conditioning regimen before an autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) for chemosensitive relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and Non Hodgkin Limphoma (NHL) patients (pts) is still represented by a scheduled combination of carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and Melphalan (BEAM ). Despite the effi cacy of this regimen, it is disadvantaged by the presence of carmustine, which is responsible of a high pulmonar toxicity with fi brosis and progressive reduced diffusion capacity. In order to prevent pulmonar toxicity, we replaced carmustine with Thiotepa in 26 chemosensitive relapsed HL and NHL pts. We have also evaluated the effi cacy and tolerability of this new regimen. Patients: At day -7 26 pts received 10 mg/kg thiotepa (5 mg twice every 12 hours) followed by cytarabine 200 mg/m 2 die (-5 to -3) etoposide 200 mg/m2 die (-5 to -3) and melphalan 140 mg/m 2 (day -2). Out of these pts, 16 were male and 11 female. Fifteen pts were affected by da NHL and 11 by HL. At the moment of transplant only 8 pts were in CR, 14 were in PR and 4 were in progression. All patients were in second or sebsequent line of therapy. The median time of neutrophil >500 and platelets >20000 recovery was of 10 (range 8-12) and 12 (range 10-20) days respectively. No severe infectious event has been observed. Eight pts maintain the CR, 12 have reached CR, 3 have a stable disease and 3 pts did not respond to the treatment. Three pts that were in CR have subsequently relapsed. Conclusions: Our experience with TEAM protocol has shown a signifi cant effi cacy not lower to our historical experience with BEAM protocol. The tollerability was signifi cantly accetable and no serious adverse event has been documented during the treatment or during aplastic phase, therefore the TRM at 100 days has been equal to zero. In no case, oral mucositis was higher than grade 2, even if most of the pts underwent total parenteral nutrition. Finally no cases of serious organ toxicity was observed (pulmonar, hepatic, cardiac and renal). Hematopoietic recovery, stimulated with G-CSF, has been reached as scheduled and no cases of prolonged neutropenia were observed.",

Yagci Gazi University Faculty of Medicine (Ankara, TR) Background: The current practice for the management of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's disease (HD) patients is high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). However, there is no standart salvage chemotherapy prior to transplantation. In the present study we evaluated the effi cacy and toxicity of the combination chemotherapy vinorelbine and gemcitabine as salvage therapy prior to SCT in relapsed or refractory HD patients. Patients and Methods: A total of 30 HD patients [7 women and 23 men; median age 28 years (range 17-61)] with relapsed (n= 13) or refractory (n=17) disease were treated with vinorelbine 30 mg/m\u00b2 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m\u00b2 on days 1 and 8 and 15 of each 28 day cycle with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. One patient (3,3%) died during chemotherapy due to septic shock. Second cycle of chemotherapy was used as stem cell mobilization regimen in 16 patients (53,3%). Response was assessed after 2 cycles of therapy and then 22 patient underwent ASCT, fi ve patients (16,6%) with prior ASCT and 1 patient (3,3%) with bone marrow involvement underwent allogeneic SCT. Results: Twenty nine of the 30 patients, 29 were eligible for assessment of response prior to SCT. Eleven patients (36,7%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 8 patients (26,7%) had partial remission (PR), with an overall response rate of 63,4%. All the patients (100%) were succesfully collected during recovery from second cycle of chemotherapy [median of 5,97 x 10 6 CD34 cells/ kg (range 1,78-27]. After a median follow up of 16 months (range 1-48) progression free survival (PFS) was 48,5% and overall survival (OS) was 73,7%. Hospital admissions were required in 4 patients (13,3%) due to lymphoma related poor performance status. Among non hematological toxicities grade III-IV hepatotoxicity was observed in 7 patients (23,3%) and infections in 3 patients (10%). Grade III-IV hematological toxicity was observed as anemia in 12 patients (40%), neutropenia in 22 patients (73,3%) and thrombocytopenia in 10 patients (33,3%). Conclusion: Stem cell collection is sucessfull in all patients attempted with Vinorelbine and Gemcitabine which can be administered in an outpatient setting and shows signifi cant efficacy against refractory or relapse lymphoma.",

Facchini (1) (1) (1)Hospital de la santa Creu y sant Pau (Barcelona, ES) ; (2) Hospital del Mar (Barcelona, ES) Introduction and objectives: The treatment of refractory and relapsed advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is challenging. Gemcitabine-containing regimens have been used as salvage treatment although little is known about their effi cacy, toxicity profi le and ability to mobilize progenitor cells into the peripheral blood (PBPCs) for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) procedure. Herein, we report our experience with the combination of gemcitabine-oxaliplatine (GEMOX) as salvage protocol for relapsed or refractory HL patients in terms of effi cacy, toxicity and stem cell mobilization ability. Matreial and methods: From 1/2007 From 1/ to 6/2008 consecutive patients with advanced refractory or relapsed HL have been included in two different institutions. The GEMOX protocol consisted on the combination of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m\u00b2 iv (day S215 1) and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m\u00b2 iv (day 2) every 28 days. G-CSF was administered from day +7 until granulocytes > 0.5 x 10 9 /l x 3 consecutive days in the peripheral blood. Response rates were evaluated as complete remission (CR), partial Remission (PR) and progressive or refractory disease (PD) following Cheson criteria (JCO, 1999) . WHO criteria were used to evaluate toxicity. Results: Nineteen patients (11 males, 9 females), aged 17 -65 years (median 30 years) were evaluated. At diagnosis, two patients presented in early stages and 17, with advanced disease. Median number of chemotherapy lines before receiving the GEMOX protocol were 3 (range, 2 -5) and time interval between diagnosis and the salvage protocol, 24 (range, 8 -36) months. Eleven patients had previously failed an ASCT. At the time of GEMOX all the patients were in progressive disease or in untreated relapse. Median number of administered cycles was 2 (2 -6) . Grade 3-4 haematological toxicity was present in 10 patients (neutropenia -6 patients and thrombocytopenia -4 patients). There was no grade 3-4 extra-haematological toxicity. Treatment related mortality was 5%. In 7 patients, PBPCs [median 4.3 x 10 6 /kg (range, 2.5 -14. 3)] were collected after the second cycle of GEMOX. Median number of apheresis procedure was one. Response rate was 53% (4 CR; 6 PR). Seven patients did not respond to the salvage protocol.",

We evaluated the toxicities and side effects after immunotherapy combined with high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with MCL. Methods: Since 2000 21 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed or pre-treated MCL of stage III-IV were eligible for high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. After an induction with CHOP like regimen or intensive chemoimmunotherapy (Nordic Lymphoma Study Group) autologous stem cell transplantation was performed at a median of 9 (4-70) months from diagnosis. In addition to high dose conditioning chemotherapy (BEAM) 4 doses of Rituximab (d -9, -1, +48 and +55) should be administered. Results: 21 patients (10 female, 11 male) at a median age of 59 (49-67) years were treated. 12 reached CR, 3 VGPR and 5 PR (+1 responding relapse) before receiving ASCT. Rituximab could be performed in 17 of 21 patients. Due to infectious complications third and fourth dose of Rituximab was not administered in 4 patients. A median number of 6,88 x 10 6 /kg CD 34 positive cells (0,82-22,42) were reinfused. The engraftment was generally prompt and durable (granulocytes > 0,5 G/l day +10 (9-11), platelets > 50 G/l day +13 (10-17)). Only in one case (male patient, age at TX: 55 years) a delayed regeneration (d +140; granulocytes > 0,5 G/l +11, platelets day +21) was observed. Side effects were mild in 20 of 21 patients. In 12 patients mucositis grade I-II was seen, 10 suffered from emesis grade I-III and 10 from enteritis grade I-II. Grade 4 toxicities and treatment related deaths were not observed. Infectious complications such as fever of unknown origin occurred in 5, septicaemia in 3 and pneumonia in 3 patients. Following transplantation all patients reached clinical and molecular CR. 18 of 21 patients are still in CCR with a median observation period of 33 months . 1 patient relapsed after 3,7 years and is living in CCR 2 after alternative therapy, 2 patients relapsed after 1,4 and 2,1 years and died 4,8 and 2,8 years after transplantation.

Methods: Between 2001. and 2008. we performed 42 HSCT in MCL: 35 autologous, and 7 allogeneic. Gender ratio: 29 male and 13 female. At the time of transplant the median age was 48,6 years old. The median follow-up was 33 months (3-84). In 29 cases 12 Gy Totalbody irradiation + 120 mg/bw Cyclophosphamide (TBI/CY), in 13 cases other chemotherapy (BEAM, BU/CY) were applied for conditioning regimen. In 39 cases mobilized peripheral blood, in 3 bone marrow were used for stem cell source. Results: 31 out of 35 autologous transplanted patients alive (88,6%), 4 patients died (11,4%). 25 patients are in complett remission (80,6%), 3 patients live in relapse, and further 3 relapsed patients underwent a second allogeneic transplantation. The conditioning regimen before allogeneic SCT was TBI/ CY in 2 cases, and the reduced intensity conditioning regimen included Fludarabine/Melphalane/Rituximab in 5 cases. The graft versus host disease (GVHD) prevention was Cyclosporine-A + Methotrexate in 2, and Mycofenolate mofetil + Cyclosporine-A in 5 cases. Among 7 allotransplanted patients in 3 the allogeneic HSCT were performed following relapse after autologous HSCT, in further 4 cases the allogeneic HSCT was the fi rst transplant. The median follow-up was 24 months (4-80). Acute GVHD (skin, gut, liver) gr.IV. developed in 1 case. Chronic extensive GVHD occured in 1 case. 5 out of 7 patients alive in complett remission after allogeneic HSCT. 1 patient died of bacterial sepsis before engraftment, further 1 patient died 5 months following allogeneic HSCT in steroid-resistant, gr.IV. GVHD. Conclusion: Autologous HSCT following high dose radio-chemotherapy in MCL can provide favorable DFS. Allogeneic stem cell transplant might play a role in special cases, and can be recommended even in older age.",

Vandenberghe St James Hospital (Dublin, IE) Most patients (80-90%) with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) attain a durable complete remission (CR) with fi rst line therapy. Patients with primary refractory or relapsed disease have various treatment options including salvage chemotherapy \u00b1 radiotherapy or high dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplant (HDT-ASCT). We reviewed the outcome of 41 patients with relapsed/refractory HL referred for HDT-ASCT to St James Hospital from 9 referring hospitals between 2000 and 2007. Patients were included in the programme if they had HL refractory to primary chemotherapy (n=13), relapsed HL following chemotherapy (n=13) and patients who had > 2 lines of treatment prior to referral to the transplant program (n=15). The M:F ratio was 22:19 with a median age at transplant of 33yr (range 15 -46yr). Radiological assessment of disease was determined at relapse, post-salvage chemotherapy and at 100 days post HDT-ASCT by Computerised Tomography (CT) or CT-positron emission tomography (PET) from 2004. All patients received 3 courses of salvage chemotherapy including one peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilising course prior to HDT-SCT. The median time from initial diagnosis to HDT-ASCT was 20.1 months (range 6 -145mo). Post-salvage chemotherapy 16 patients were in complete remission (CR) and the remaining 25 patients had a partial response (PR). The median CD34 cell dose administered was 3.65 x 10 6 /Kg, (range 0.6-10.45 x 10 6 /Kg). The median time for neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 10 days with a range of 8-25 and 6-35 days respectively. At day 100 post-HDT, 36 patients were in CR, 4 were in PR, 1 died of progressive disease and there were no toxic deaths. 27 of 29 patients were FDG-PET negative at day 100 post-HDT of whom 26 remain in CR. All patients who were PET +ve pre-HDT subsequently relapsed. The calculated OS at 5 year was 84%. The clinical outcome of the patients treated in the National Adult Transplantation unit compares favourably with international fi gures. Further improvement will depend on better patient selection as relapsed disease remains the only cause of death. The routine use of FDG-PET scanning may permit the selection of patients who will not benefi t from HDT and need an alternative management pathway which may include intensifi ed salvage therapy, different conditioning regimens or allogeneic transplantation.",

Masszi St Istvan and St Laszlo Hospital (Budapest, HU) Objectives: The impact of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in T cell neoplasms is poorly defi ned. Methods: Medical records of HSCT patients at Budapest from 1995 to 2008 were reviewed. We retrospectively analyzed the results of all 33 T cell lymphoma patients treated with HSCT. Results: Among the 33 patients, we performed 29 autologous and 6 allogeneic HSCT. Patients had a median age of 28 (range, 15 to 60 years). Eighteen patients (54,5%) had anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) including 10 anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive and 8 ALK negat\u00edv cases, 10 (33,3%) peripheral T cell lymphoma unspecifi ed (PTCL-U), 2 T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, 1 angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma and 1 hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Disease status at autologous HSCT was complete response (CR) in 12 patients, partial remission (PR) in 12, and refractory in 5. Preparative regimens were BEAM (89%) and TBI-CY (11%). Following autologous HSCT, 21 (72%) achieved CR, 2 PR and 6 unresponsive. Of the 12 patients who were in pre-transplant PR, 8 achieved CR following HSCT. The median follow-up of the 20 surviving patients is 27 months (1 to 124) 15 of whom are free of disease. According to disease entities the overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were higher in ALK+ ALCL group and lower in ALK-ALCL and PTCL-U groups. Among the 6 allo-grafted patients, 4 received myeloablative (TBI-CY 3, BU-CY 1) and 2 underwent HSCT after reduced intensity (Fludarabine-Melphalan-Alemtuzumab) conditioning (RIC). The source of stem cells was mobilized PB in 5 patients and BM in 1 case. Graft-versushost disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A and methotrexate in 3 patients, tacrolimus+mycofenolate mofetil in 2 cases and tacrolimus+rapamycine in 1 case. Two patients developed acute GVHD. Following allo-HSCT, 3 patients alive and 2 patients are in CR. Both patients with CR received RIC conditioning regimen. Conclusion: Patients with T cell neoplasm who respond completely following autologous-HSCT have an excellent prognosis. Those who only achieved pre-transplant PR but then obtained a CR following autologous-HSCT have similar outcome. More than half of patients (61%) with ALCL and approximately one third of the patients (30%) with PTCL-U may enjoy prolonged DFS following autologous-HSCT. In refractory or relapsing T cell lymphoma, the allogeneic-HSCT might improve the outcome for eligible patients, especially when using RIC conditioning. (1) Objectives: The aim of this study was to correlate lymfocyte recovery and progression-free survival (PFS) after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients (pts) with primary progressive or recurrent Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and to analyze factors associated with outcome. Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 33 pts with HL who underwent ASCT between 2000 and 2008. Factors analyzed: clinical stage at relapse, relapse <12months and >12months, chemosensitivity of relapse, infused lymphocytes and CD34 cells, pre-apheresis absolute lymfocyte count (ALC), day 15 and day 90 ALC following ASCT, engraftment characteristics and infections within fi rst 6 months post-transplant. Results: At the time of ASCT 14/33 patients (pts) were in CR, 7/33 in PR, 8/33 in SD and 4/33 pts were primary progressive HL. Median age:34 years (range 19-57). Median CD34 cell infused: 6.8x10 6 /kg (range 4.1-34.7). Median pre-apheresis ALC: 1.2x10 9 /L, day 15 ALC: 0.7x10 9 /L, day 90 ALC: 1.35x10 9 / L. Median follow-up: 3.6years. 3 year median overall survival (OS) and PFS are 82% and 71%. There was no association between PFS and remission status at the time of ASCT, infused lymphocytes and CD34 cell number, pre-apheresis ALC, day 15 ALC, or engrafment times. Day 90 ALC (HR=0.205, p= 0.017) was signifi cantly associated with PFS in univariate analysis and multivariate analysis. Conclusions: In our study only ALC day 90 was signifi cantly associated with improved PFS suggesting long-term lymphoid reconstitution may be an important factor for tumor control.",

Orsola-Malpighi Hospital (Bologna, IT) We analyzed data on 46 patients with lymphomas, treated with reduced intensity conditioning and allograft between 2002 and 2007 at our institution. Twenty-three patients had HL, seven high-grade lymphomas, twelve low-grade and 4 T-cell lymphomas. Median age was 37.5. 29% patients had a chemosensitive disease and 87% had been treated before with autologous transplantation. 59% received stem cell from peripheral blood and 41% from bone marrow. The donor was a related sibling for 27 patients and unrelated for 19. Conditioning regimen was the association Tiothepa (10mg/kg), Fludarabine (60 Mg/kg), Endoxan Cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg) \u00b1 ATG-F (total dose 15 mg/kg) for patients who received a related allograft, and Tiothepa (10 mg/kg), Melphalan (30 Mg/mq), Endoxan (100 mg/mq) + ATG-F Fresenius for the unrelated transplant. All patients, except one who died at day 7 after transplantation, engrafted. Overall survival was 51% at 3 yrs and it was signifi cantly associated with chemoresistant vs chemosensitive disease ( 31% vs 93%). Transplant related mortality was 23% at 3 yrs, and we observed an association with chemoresistance (33% vs 8% in chemosensitive group). Relapse was 66% at 3 yrs, and signifi cantly higher for patients with chemoresistant disease (74% vs 34%). We also tried to analyze the Graft-versus-Lymphoma effect, looking for association between complete remission (CR) and chronic GVHD: of 24 patients who obtained CR, 17 had experimented cGVHD, but of 13 who did not obtain response only 4 had cGVHD (chi squared=6.072, p=0.048). However, different diseases had different response to the immunological effect: HL and high grade NHL appeared to have a very limited response to GVL effect, but in low grade NHL and peripheral T-cell Lymphomas there was an higher rate of response with a minimal relapse risk at 3 yrs.",

Ozcan Ankara University School of Medicine (Ankara, TR) Introduction: The response rates to salvage therapy and high dose chemotherapy with autologus hematopoietic transplantation of relapsed non Hodgkin lymphoma(NHL) patients treated with rituximab in fi rst line therapy, is still debate. Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 76 patients (median age 42(17-63), Male/Female:48/28) who relapsed or progressed after fi rst line therapy and had high dose chemotherapy, autologus transplantation. We grouped them as patients treated with rituximab (R(+) n:21) and without rituximab (R(-) n:54) in fi rst line therapy. The major group of the patients were diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Median time from diagnosis to transplantation was12 months (5-151) in R (-) group and 20 months (5-54) in R (+) group. Results: The median age of R (+) patients was slightly older than R(-) patients. Overall response (CR+PR) to salvage therapy before transplantation was 62% in R (+) group and 44% in R (-) group, p=0.448. Overall response after transplantation was 76% in both groups. Posttransplantation 2 years survival of all patients was 50%\u00b17% with median 21 months of follow up. Posttransplantation 2 years survival according to groups was statistically insignifi cant between two groups R (+); 35%\u00b126%, R(-) 51%+8%, p=0.72. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma patients were analyzed spesifi cally; rituximab was found with no effect to the posttransplantation responses and survival rates; 1 year survival was 71% \u00b114% in R (+) group and 61%\u00b1 8% in R (-) group, P=0.838. Twenty nine patients (RR+) treated with rituximab both in fi rst and second line therapy was compared with 46 patients(RR-) who did not; 2 years survival was 40%\u00b115% in RR(+) group and %55\u00b18% in RR (-) group, p=0,72. Conclusion: In conclusion, we did not fi nd a positive effect of rituximab in fi rst line treatment to responses of salvage therapy and posttransplantation period. Our rituximab positive group was older and had less patients than rituximab negative group. Further randomized, prospective studies with larger patient groups are needed. Purpose: In recent years, several studies have pointed towards an association between certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP8, SNP12, and SNP13) in the NOD2/CARD15 gene on incidence of severe acute GvHD and TRM after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in adult patients. No studies were published so far, evaluating the impact of these mutations in pediatric recipients of allogeneic SCT. Here we report the results of a retrospective multicenter trial in 421 children and adolescents who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation for leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. Patients: Between February 1997 and March 2008, 421 children (median age=10.7) with ALL (n=212), AML (n=106), and MDS (n=103) underwent an allogeneic SCT and were included into the analysis. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Goethe University Frankfurt. Data were obtained for analysis until November 2008. Patients received their grafts either from a matched family donor (MFD, n=108), from a mismatched family donor (MMFD; n=46), a matched unrelated donor (MUD; n=223) or a mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD; n=44). NOD2/CARD15 mutations were assessed using RT-PCR as described previously. Diagnosis of aGVHD was based on clinical signs or histopathological fi ndings. Grading was performed based on the Seattle criteria. Results: In the 421 transplant pairs 122 mutations (21%) could be identifi ed in either the recipient (n=52) or in the donor (n=52), in 18 pairs both, recipient and donor revealed mutations. Two recipients were positive for two mutations and one donor was homozygous for SNP 12. The cumulative incidence (CI) of severe aGVHD III-IV was higher in patient donor pairs (0.17) with wildtype genes compared to 0.08 in patient/donor pairs who showed mutated genes (p=0.026). TRM in transplantations without mutations was 0.24 compared to 0.25 with mutations (P=0.9). In matched donor transplants CI of TRM was 0.20 in wildtype pairs compared to 0.22 in transplant pairs showing a mutanted gene in either the recipient or the donor (p=0.72). In these patients the CI of severe aGVHD III-IV was also higher in the wildtyp pairs (0.16) compared to 0.08 in transplant pairs showing a mutation in the NOD2CARD15 gene (p=0.044). Conclusion: On the basis of these fi ndings we conclude that consideration of NOD2/CARD15 mutations are not pertinent when selecting a donor for pediatric patients. The Study was supported by the German Jos\u00e9 Carreras Leukemia Foundation. M. Pfeiffer, T. Feuchtinger, H. Teltschik, I. M\u00fcller, R. Handgretinger, P. Lang University T\u00fcbingen (T\u00fcbingen, DE) NK activity is regulated by signaling through activating and inhibitory receptors. Acquisition of both inhibiting and activating receptors on developing NK cells is an important step in their functional maturation after transplantation. Here we report for the fi rst time on the reconstitution of NKreceptors after haploidentical transplantation of CD3/CD19 depleted grafts in children. KIR reconstitution followed an already known pattern with higher percentage of KIR negative NK cells early after transplantation and a higher and faster expression of CD158b compared to CD158a and CD158e independent of presence or absence of the corresponding KIR ligands in donors or recipients. This pattern was also seen for the subpopulation of KIR single positive NK cells, which express only one of the above mentioned inhibitory KIRs and which are thought to be involved in NK alloreactivity. Whereas some patients showed reduced NKG2D expression in the fi rst hundred days after transplantation almost all patients soon showed nearly normal levels of NKp30, NKp46, CD226, CD85j and CD244 and elevated levels of NKp44 and NKG2A. In contrast to published results in adult patients after haploidentical transplantation of positive selected grafts we found a fast recovery of CD56+/CD16+ NK cells with cytolytic activity against K562. Cytotoxic activity against K562 of both resting and IL-2 activated NK cells reached already the same level in the fi rst 30 days after transplantation as compared to later time points. Furthermore these NK cells showed strong ADCC activity against neuroblastoma cell lines and leukemic blasts as early as day fourteen after transplantation using antibodies against disialoganglioside 2 (for neuroblastoma) or CD19 (for pediatric leukemic blasts). It is not clear from published results if the fast recovery of CD56+/CD16+ NK is an effect of CD3/ CD19 depletion or a general difference between children and adults. Our results indicate a fast recovery of functional CD56+/ CD16+ NK cells after haploidentical transplantation with CD3/ CD19 depleted grafts which can mediate ADCC and therefore enable an early use of antibodies to target residual malignant cells.",

Therefore, we analyzed the incidence, risk factors, BK virus association, and mortality of HC in 165 consecutive children who underwent HSCT between 1/2000 and 12/2006 in a single center. Fifty nine patients received autologous HSCT and 106 patients underwent allogeneic HSCT. Nineteen of the 165 patients (11.5%) developed HC after a median of 33 days. All 19 patients with HC underwent allogeneic HSCT and showed BK viruria after transplantation. An acute graft-versus-host disease was signifi cantly more frequent in children with HC (p<0.001). Signifi cant risk factors for HC development in univariate binary logistic analyses were age > 12 years (OR, 3.275; p<0.031), use of busulfan (OR, 3.514; p<0.013), use of busulfan and cyclophosphamide in combination (OR, 4.935; p<0.002) , and an unrelated donor (OR, 3.309; p<0.043). Independent risk factors in multivariate binary logistic analyses were age > 12 years and the combination of busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Furthermore, we analyzed the BK virus load in urine by real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found in patients without HC a signifi cantly increased number of BK virus copies in urine in children older than 12 years (p<0.009) and in children who received antithymocyte globulin (p<0.001). In addition, BK virus load in urine was signifi cantly increased in children who suffered from HC. Thirteen of 14 children with HC had a BK virus load in urine > 10 7 copies/ml (p<0.001). We observed in individual BK virus profi les an increase of BK virus copies in urine before the onset of HC. 13 of 19 children (68.4%) with HC and 43 of 146 children (29.4%) without HC died after HSCT (p<0.003). All 6 children (100%) who suffered from grade IV HC died after transplantation. We conclude that HC in children is a disease of multiple etiologies and leads to a high mortality. Allogeneic HSCT, the combination of busulfan and cyclophosphamide, age > 12 years, and an unrelated donor are risk factors for the development of HC in childhood. Increased BK virus load in urine > 10 7 copies/ml may lead to HC. Therefore, it is useful to quantify BK virus in urine in those children with above mentioned risk factors to initiate early treatment or to prevent the development of HC and potentially decrease the HC-related mortality.",

We have prospectively analyzed differences in immunereconstitution after matched sibling transplantation (id-SIB) and unrelated bonemarrow transplantation (MUD) or cordblood (u-CB) HSCT. Methods: In a cohort study among allogeneic pediatric HSCT patients (May 2004 -October 2008 , immunophenotyping was performed on whole blood samples every other week if leucocyte > 0.4E9/L. Numbers of T-(CD3+), B-(CD19+) and NK-(CD3-CD16+CD56+) cells and subsets were determined by fl ow cytometry. Differences in maximum and time to maximum of T-and B-cell numbers during the fi rst 100 days after HSCT between recipients of the various grafts (id-SIB, MUD and u-CB) were analyzed using Wilcoxon tests. Results: 107 patients were included, with a median age of 4.7 (0.1-21.2) years. 23 recipients received id-SIB, 47 MUD and 37 u-CB graft. The median follow up after HSCT was 57,8 (2, 4) weeks and 29 (27%) patients deceased. Maximum CD8+T-cell numbers were higher after id-SIB-and MUD compared to u-CB-HSCT (151 and 373 versus 47 CD8+Tcells/uL, p=0.000). The proportion of na\u00efve CD8+T-cells (CD45RA+CD27+) was signifi cantly higher in id-SIB compared to MUD and u-CB-recipients (22% versus 10% and 4%, p=0,001). CD4+T-cell numbers did not signifi cantly differ between id-SIB, MUD and u-CB recipients (138, 159 and 68 CD4+T-cells/uL, p=0.160), but the proportion of na\u00efve CD4+Tcells (CD45RA+CD27+) was higher in id-SIB compared to MUD-and u-CB-recipients (17% versus 2% and 1%, p=0,000). NK-cell and B-cell numbers were higher in u-CB compared to id-SIB and MUD recipients (577 versus 253 and 385 NK-cells/uL, p=0,001 and 538 versus 92 and 176 B-cells/uL, p=0,001). These B-cells mainly showed immature B-cells phenotype (SIgD+CD10+CD38++). No difference in median time to maximum CD3+, CD4+, NK-and B-cell numbers was observed, except for maximum CD8+T-cell numbers, which was earlier in id-SIB compared to MUD and u-CB recipients (30 (4-90) versus 77 (3-99) and 66 (6-100) days after HSCT, p=0.003).",

U-CB recipients showed higher B-cell and NK-cell numbers compared to BM recipients. The latter may indicate a faster in vivo proliferative capacity of CB stem cells compared to BM derived stem cells. A.P.J. de Pagter, J.J. Boelens, R. Jacobi, E.A.M. Sanders, R. Schuurman, D. van Baarle University Medical Center (Utrecht, NL) Background: Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is frequently complicated by human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV6), cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein Barr virus (EBV) reactivations. Herpesvirus reactivations are associated with severe morbidity and poor survival after HSCT. T-lymphocytes play an important role in the clearance of viral reactivations after HSCT, however an easy measure of potent T cell responses for predicting outcome of viral reactivations is lacking. In this study, we analyzed expression of perforin as a marker for cytotoxic potential in CD8+T-cells in children and related this to the clearance of viral reactivations early after allogeneic HSCT. Methods: Prospectively, we weekly analyzed HHV6, CMV and EBV DNA loads in plasma by quantitative realtime PCR. Herpesvirus reactivation was defi ned as DNA load >1000 cp/mL. CMV-and EBV reactivation were pre-emptive treated according to local guidelines. HHV6reactivation was treated when there was clinical suspicion of disease. Additionally, we have weekly analyzed Perforin expression in CD8+T-cells by whole blood FACS analysis, until 4 months after HSCT. Results: A total of 27 patients were included; median age of 4,3(0.3-20,1) years. 15/27 (56%) recipients received bonemarrow (7/15 from matched family donor) or unrelated peripheral blood stemcells while 12/27 (44%) recipients received unrelated cordblood stemcells. All patients received myeloablative conditioning and standardized Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. During the fi rst 4 months after HSCT, 16 patients developed HHV6reactivation, 2 patients developed CMVreactivation and 1 patient developed EBV reactivation. The median time of herpesvirus reactivation peak was 2,4 weeks (range 1,3-15,6) after HSCT. Viral clearance was marked by a perforin peak in CD8+ T-cells (median time of maximum perforin expression in CD8+Tcells was 4 weeks (range 1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] 9) . Patients with herpesvirus reactivation (HHV6, CMV or EBV) showed signifi cantly higher perforin-expression in CD8+T-cells during viral load clearance than patients without herpesvirus reactivation (17,2% (range 0-63%) versus 6,8% (range 0-16%) respectively; p=0.003). Conclusion: Herpesvirus reactivation clearance was significantly associated with a peak in perforin-expressing CD8+Tcells. Although the early virus specifi c immune responses after HSCT have to be elucidated, perforin expression in T-cells is a useful marker for antiviral T-cell responses and viral load clearance after HSCT.",

Haveman, R. Schuurman, M. Bierings, J.J. Boelens University Medical Center (Utrecht, NL) Objective: After paediatric haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) adenovirus (HAdV) infection is a severe com-plication with high morbidity and mortality rate. By intensive surveillance patients at high risk for developing HAdV disease can early be identifi ed in order to start preemptive therapy with antiviral medication in an early stage. Methods: In a prospective study, we determined the predictive value of HAdV DNA positivity in nasopharyngeal fl uid preceding HSCT to identify patients at risk for a HAdV reactivation after HSCT. We weekly monitored Adenovirus DNA loads in plasma after HSCT. Secondly, the association between HAdV reactivation and alloreactive disease (Graft-versus-Host disease and/or idiopathic pulmonary syndrome) was analyzed. Results: A total of 62 patients after allogeneic HSCT were included: 37 (60%) recipients received bone marrow (17/37, 46%, matched family donor) or unrelated peripheral blood stem cells while 25 (40%) recipients received unrelated cord blood stem cells. 42/62 (68%) recipients received HLA-matched stem cells (for BM/PBSC high resolution typing, for CB intermediate: HLA-A and B on low and HLA-DR on high resolution). All patients received myeloablative conditioning and standardized Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. The median follow-up time was 47 (5-150) weeks. Prior to HSCT, HAdV DNA could be detected in nasopharyngeal fl uid of 8/62 patients (13%). In all these patients (100%), plasma HAdV reactivation occurred at a median time of 12.5 days (range 5-72 days) after HSCT. Additionally, 11 (18%) patients developed HAdV reactivation at a median time of 40 (14-160) days after HSCT. In multivariate analysis HAdV DNA positivity in nasopharyngeal fl uid was the only signifi cant predictor for HAdV reactivation after HSCT (HR 9, 7; 95%CI 3, 4; p=0.000) . In patients with HAdV reactivation, HadV was a predictor for alloreactive disease (HR 2.6; 95% CI 1, [2] [3] [4] [5] 4; p=0.013) . Conclusions: HAdV positivity in nasopharyngeal fl uid pre-HSCT is a very strong predictor for the development of HAdV reactivation after HSCT. Prevention or early pre-emptive treatment with antiviral therapy might contribute to prevent HAdV disease and / or SCT associated problems after HSCT.",

Formankova (1) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a recognized complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Between I/2000 and VI/2008 214 children underwent allogeneic SCT at our center for malignant (146; 68%) or non-malignant (68; 32%) disease. Donors were HLA-identical siblings (60; 28%), unrelated donors (144; 67%) or mismatched family donors (10; 5%). Eight grafts were T-cell depleted. In 10 patients (4.6%) AIHA with signifi cant hemolysis and a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was diagnosed at a median time of 201 days (76 -407) after SCT. Warm-reacting antibodies were detected in all 10 patients, in 6 in combination with cold antibodies. AIHA was diagnosed exclusively in patients following SCT from unrelated donor (9 unmanipulated) and predominantly (9/10) in patients transplanted for non-malignant disease (metabolic disorder 4, primary immunodefi ciency 4, severe aplastic anemia 1). 8 children were transplanted after fully myeloablative conditioning regimen (busulfan 16/20 mg/kg), one after reduced intensity conditioning and one received antithymocytic globulin only. AIHA was associated with mixed chimerism (10-90% of autologous hematopoiesis) in 7 patients. Therapy of AIHA consisted of corticosteroids (10/10), intravenous immunoglobulin (8/10) and rituximab (8/10). Rituximab was administered at the dose of 375mg/m2 (1 -13 doses; median 5), mostly weekly x 3, starting at AIHA fi rst manifestation (7) or reactivation (1) . 4/10 patients suffered from recurrent AIHA (1-4 reactivations), therefore 3 of them were treated with maintenance courses of rituximab (every 2 months; 2 -8 doses). Two of them achieved DAT negativity and are well 23 and 7.5 months after the treatment discontinuation, in 1 child the treatment is ongoing. All 10 patients are alive without clinical signs of hemolysis. 6 children achieved negativity of DAT 7.5 -75 (median 43) months after discontinuation of therapy for AIHA, in 4 children treatment is still ongoing. In our series SCT from unrelated donor, non-malignant disease and mixed chimerism were considered as risk factors for development of post-transplant AIHA. Therapy including repeated infusions of rituximab was well tolerated without any signifi cant infections. We conclude that rituximab is an effective modality in patients suffering from post-transplant AIHA and maintenance courses could prevent recurrence. Supported by VZ FNM MZ 64203.",

Methods: 19 patients (pts), aged 3-17 years, affected by resistant (5) or relapsed (14) NB were enrolled and submitted to an SCT after a RIC consisting of Thiotepa 15 mg/kg and Melphalan 140 mg/sqm. The donor was an identical sibling in 11 cases or a MUD in 8. At time of transplant 14 pts were in any kind of remission of disease and 5 in progressive disease. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisting of Cyclosporin A + Anti-lymphocytic serum and short term methotrexate in MUD setting. SC sources were bone marrow in 15 cases and peripheral blood in 4. Results: The reconstitution of bone marrow function was obtained in all the 19 pts after a median time of 12 and 17 days for PMN and PLT respectively in sibling setting, and 14 and 17 days in MUD setting. Acute GVHD of grade II-III occurred in 7 pts and a complete marrow donor chimerism was observed after 40 and 60 days in sibling and MUD setting respectively. After a median follow-up of 15 (1-35) months, 9 pts relapsed, 6 dead for progressive disease and 10 are alive and well. The median time of relapse from SCT was 9 (2-17) months. No pts dead for treatment related causes (TRM). The 2 years probability of OS and EFS of the entire cohort of pts were respectively 0.59 (0.13) and 0.38 (0.13), with a better EFS for pts who developed grade II-III acute GVHD (0.44 vs 0.25), were in any kind of remission of disease (0.46 vs 0), received a sibling graft (0.46 vs 0.20). Conclusions: Our experience show the feasibility and effi cacy of a RIC with SCT from HLA identical sibling donor or MUD in the treatment of relapsed or refractory NB. In fact no patient suffered TRM. Moreover in a setting of pts who the 2 years probability of survival is nearly to zero, in our experience more than 50% are alive and well. The observation that the develop of acute GVHD is related to a better outcome may offer the evidence of GVT in NB.",

Resnick Hadassah Hebrew University (Jerusalem, IL) Introduction: In some publications the feasibility of intensive care in the HSCT setting is in doubt because of an extremely high mortality rate which approaches 100%. These poor results have improved in recent years, particularly in the pediatric age group [1, 2] . Aim: Assessment of risk factors for mortality and outcome in a cohort of children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) who were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) from 2002 till September 2008. Methods: Retrospective case study. Results: 95 HSCT were performed in 91 children. Twenty one (23%) experienced 25 admissions to PICU (table); 12 patients were diagnosed with non-malignant and 9 patients with malignant diseases, all but one child underwent allogeneic HSCT. Eleven (52%) admissions resulted in death in PICU and overall 1-year survival was 38%. Of the 11 deceased patients 4 suffered from acute GVHD (grade 3-4) and 8 required endotracheal mechanical ventilation. All 10 children who developed multiple organ failure died. Of the 10 surviving patients, 3 were ventilated; all suffered from SCID and were transplanted in PICU. One year survival in children discharged from PICU was 80% (8/10). Conclusions: 1. Effectiveness of treatment in PICU was similar in children suffering from malignant and non-malignant diseases. 1. The most prominent risk factor associated with immediate mortality was development of multiple organ failure (p=0.00003). For 1-year survival it was aGVHD (p=0.039). The need for mechanical ventilation (p=0.063) as well as HSCT from mismatched donors (p=0.094) were additional parameters that can predict a bad outcome for children admitted to PICU. 2. One year survival of all patients admitted to PICU and those discharged make this treatment feasible for the pediatric group in the HSCT setting.

Intensive care unit mortality trends in children after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a meta-regression analysis. Crit Care Med. 2008 Oct;36 (10) Introduction: Epstein Barr virus (EBV) related lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a serious complication of haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Measuring EBV viral load by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is useful for detecting EBV-PTLD in patients at risk before the onset of clinical symptoms. Rituximab given at 375mg/m\u00b2 when the EBV viral load is >1000 copies/105 PBL is reported to prevent EBV-PTLD. Materials and methods: between June 2004 and June 2008 at the HSCT Unit of the Gaslini Children's Hospital, patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT were monitored for the risk of PTLD by weekly EBV load assessment and evaluation of CD20 and CD19 absolute lymphocyte counts. EBV-DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) load was evaluated by semi quantitative PCR assay. Only patients with EBV copies \u2265 20,000/105PBL or between 10,000 and 20,000 copies/105PBL but with an increase in CD20/CD19 cells in the peripheral blood were eligible for rituximab therapy. Results: 80 children undergoing allogeneic HSCT (62 from unrelated donors,17 from HLA family matched donors and 8 from HLA family mismatched donors)were evaluated. Six patients received more than one HSCT, for a total of 87 transplants. No EBV reactivation was observed in 34 HSCTs. EBV reactivation was documented in 53 other transplants, but EBV copies remained <1000/105PBL in 21 cases, while EBV viral load was \u2265 1000 copies/105 PBL in 32 (60%).These patients were more strictly monitored (twice a week). We observed an increase in EBV load \u2265 20,000 copies/105 PBL after a mean of 54 days from HSCT in 12 transplants(SD 25.9). Nine of them (8 unrelated HSCTs and 1 HLA familiar mismatched donor) who had an increase in CD20 lymphocytes were treated with rituximab. After rituximab, only one patient developed PTLD requiring chemotherapy and infusion of donor specifi c EBV cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. The remaining 3 had EBV load \u2265 20,000 copies/105 PBL, but with no increase in CD20/CD19. They did not receive rituximab and they did not develop PTLD. The patients treated with rituximab needed immunoglobulin replacement therapy for a mean of 566 days (range 41-1356 days). None of the remaining 20 HSCTs with EBV load between 1000 and 20,000 copies/105 PBL developed PTLD. Conclusions: our data suggest that in allogeneic paediatric recipients, an EBV viral load \u226520,000/105 PBL associated with CD20/CD19 lymphocyte count monitoring may represent a reliable cut off for the administration of rituximab to prevent the EBV-PTLD.",

Bartelink (1) Background: Busulfan combined with therapeutic drug monitoring and guided dosing is associated with higher event free survival (EFS) rates due to less graft-failure/relapses and lower toxicity in haematological stem cell transplantation. We previously demonstrated an optimal AUC between 74-82 mg*h/L in a group of children with (non)-malignant indications. Therapeutic drug monitoring of busulfan is still controversial. The optimal target AUC in these children is not known. We retrospectively analyzed the association between busulfan exposure (AUC) and clinical outcomes in MDS and JMML patients. Methods: All children, transplanted for MDS and JMML between 2001-2008, receiving intravenous busulfan as part of a myeloablative regimen, were included. 34 patients received busulfan, cyclophosphamide 120mg/kg, and melphalan 140mg/m\u00b2. Based on the fi ndings of these patients the most recent transplantations (n=3) were performed using busulfan and cyclophosphamide 120mg/kg only (AUC of >74mg*h/L).The association between an AUC below or above the previously found lower limit of the optimum of 74mg*h/L and the main endpoints; relapse rate, overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) and the toxicity endpoints: acute-Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGvHD) grade 2-4; and Veno-occlusive Disease (VOD), were tested using Cox regression analysis and log-rank statistics. Results: 38 patients (27 MDS, 11 JMML) were transplanted (1 patient was excluded because of unpredictable pharmacokinetics). Median follow up time was 2.2 (range 1-18) years. EFS in the <74mg*h/L and >74mg*h/L was 58% and 82% (p=0.13), resp. OS rates were respectively 51% and 82% for these AUCs. EFS and OS were negatively infl uenced by higher rates of graft-failures/relapses in the <74mg*h/L group (38% vs. 0%, P=0.047). Regarding the toxicity endpoints, high busulfan exposure was associated with more aGvHD grade 2-4: 20% vs 58% (p=0.037), and showed a trend to a higher VOD-rate: 12% vs 34%, (p=0.105). Conclusion: Higher busulfan exposure (>74mg*h/L) was associated with higher EFS / OS rates due to lower rates of graftfailure/relapses. A concern however is the incidence of toxicity (aGvHD grade 2-4 and VOD) in the higher exposure group in patients receiving a combination of busulfan, cyclophosphamide and melphalan. More precise targeting (defi ning the upper limit for AUC) might further optimize the outcomes in SCT for MDS/JMML.",

They were 21 male and 13 female, median age at diagnosis of 10 years (range 3-18), affected by solid tumour, 30, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 4. The remission status at PBSC was: CR 8 (24%), VGPR 5 (15%), PR 19 (56%), SD or not known 2 (6%). The median weight was 35.5 kg (range 13.5-86) and the median number of planned infusion was 1, range 1-3. Different regimens of mobilizing chemotherapy were used, etoposide, cyclophosphamide and ifosphamide being the most frequent drugs administered. The median time to fi rst PBSC was 10 days, range 6-15. The least threshold for CD34+ collection (20 cell/ul) was obtained in 28 of 34 patients (82%), the median value of CD34+ peak being 140 (range 20-1988). Successful PBSC was obtained in 27 patients (79%) because one very low weight child failed it for suboptimal vascular access. Sixteen of 27 patients (59%) achieved the target PBSC collection with 1 leukapheresis whilst 10 patients required a second leukapheresis. The median collection yield was 8 (range 1.9-116) and 2.45 (range 1-6) CD34+ x 10 6 /kg) for the fi rst and second leukapheresis, respectively. No Peg-f related adverse effects were reported. At July 31st 2008, 15 of 27 patients (56%) underwent a fi rst autologous transplant whilst 4 and 1 underwent a second and third transplant, respectively. The median time from PBSC to fi rst transplant was 64 days (range 10-154) and the median value of CD34+ x 10 6 /kg infused was 7 (range 3-299). After a median f-up of 29 days from fi rst transplant (range 16-176), all patients achieved a PMN count > 0.5 x 10 9 /l in a median time of 13 days (range 5-23) whilst 14 and 12 achieved a transfusion-unsupported PLT count > 20 and > 50 x 10 9 /l in a median time of 13 (range 5-23) and 15 days (range 12-36), respectively. Prophylactic post-transplant G-CSF was used in 7 of 15 patients (47%) for a median time of 7 days (range 1-11). All 5 patients who performed a second or third transplant successfully engrafted for PMN and PLT. All 15 transplanted patients were alive at latest f-up. We conclude that Peg-f single-shot CD34+ mobilisation is safe and effi cacy also in pediatric patients. Further prospective studies are needed to investigate the non-inferiority or superiority of Peg-f vs. fi lgrastim in PBSC.",

Verdeguer Hospital La FE (Valencia, ES) Purpose: Second transplant has been considered the only rescue option for patients relapsing after stem cell transplant (SCT). High morbidity and mortality rates are the major limiting factors when confronting this treatment. Patients and methods: Since 1989 a total of 293 SCT have been carried out in our Unit. During this period 21 patients received a second graft. In order to have a more homogeneous sample regarding surveillance of both viral and fungal infection and their treatment, conditioning and graft versus host disease (GVHD) management, we retrospectively review our experience in second transplant from January 2000 to November 2008. Results: Thirteen patients underwent second SCT at a median age of 9 years (2.1-19) . Diagnoses were: AML =7, ALL =5, Hodg-kin disease =1. Nine patients were in CR2 (4/9 after clofarabine containing rescue therapy), one in CR >2 and three patients were transplanted in relapse. The fi rst SCT was autologous in all cases and the median gap between transplants was 17 months (9-54). The source and HLA identity of second SCT were: Umbilical cord blood =6 (1 related), peripheral blood =6 (MRD =1, MMRD =2, MUD =3), match unrelated bone marrow =1. Conditioning regimen were chemotherapy based in 9 cases (RIC =1); and TBI-based in 4. ATG was administered to 11 patients. All patients engrafted at a median time of 16 days (9-36). Acute GVHD = 2 and Chronic limited GVHD =1. Infectious complications were the main morbidity cause: viral =8, fungal =1 (Candida spp), bacterial sepsis =5. One patient presented grade II veno-occlusive disease. We report lung infi ltrations in 4 cases and Post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PLPD) in two patients. Five patients died (disease progression =2, LPD =2, toxicity =1), 3 before day +100. Eight patients remain alive and in CR at a median follow-up of 47 months post SCT (3 -104). Conclusions: In our experience second transplant can be curative for a selected group of patients. Morbidity and mortality are acceptable. A close surveillance and preemptive treatment in viral infection might explain our good results.",

Pavlov Medical University (St. Petersburg, RU) Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo HSCT) is a curative approach for children with refractory or recurrent hematological malignancies but is associated with high treatment related morbidity and mortality. Conditioning regimen with reduced toxicity is a potential option used in these cases. Treosulfan is an alkylating agent with high antileukemic, myeloablative activity and low toxicity. We compared effi cacy and toxicity of two conditioning regimens in allo HSCT: treosulfan (TREO) +cyclophosphamide (CY) (1-st group) and busulfan (BU)+CY (2-nd group). Patients and methods: First group -11 patients (pts), follow-up is from Feb, 2004 till Nov, 2007: 6 boys, 5 girls, with mediana of age-9 y.o., ALL-10 pts (relapse-3 pts, 1 complete remission (CR) -1 pts, 2 CR -6 pts), AML in 2 CR -1 pt. Conditioning regimen: TREO 30-42 g/m\u00b2 and CY 120mg/kg. HSC donors: 2 matched related donors (MRD), 8 matched unrelated donor (MUD), 1 mismatch (8/10) unrelated donor (MMUD). Follow -up 2-nd group was from Nov 2000 till Nov 2006 and consisted of 31 pts (19 boys, 12 girls), mediana of age -12 y.o. AML -7 pts (1CR -4 pts, 2 CR-2 pts, and relapse -1 pts), ALL -24 pts (1 CR-1 pt, 2 CR-11 pts, 3 CR -8 pts, relapse-4 pts). HSC donors: 11 MRD, 20 MUD.

Caselli, L. Edoardo, G. Dini, R. Rondelli, R. Haupt on behalf of the AIEOP-HSCT group Introduction: osteochondromas (OS) are benign bone masses documented after Total Body Irradiation (TBI). The aim of this study was to establish the implications of any other risk factors in the development of OS after HSCT in childhood. Materials and methods: a retrospective study was organised in the framework of the Italian paediatric HSCT group (AIEOP) to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of OS in children after allogeneic and autologous HSCT. Nine AIEOP-HSCT centres participated in the study and 1632 children were eligible for this study. There was a slight prevalence of males (59%) and of autologous HSCT(52%). The median age at HSCT was 7.6 yrs (range 0.1-18.9). 49% had haematological malignancies, 38% had solid tumours and 13% showed non malignancies. Results: 27 children who developed OS after the fi rst HSCT were identifi ed (1.6%). There was a prevalence of males (81%) and of autologous HSCT (70%). Median age at HSCT was 4.3 yrs (range 0.7-10.6), while median interval between HSCT and OS was 8.9 yrs (range 1.9-13.8). None had a family history of OS. The underlying disease was haematological malignancy in 17 cases (63%). TBI was included in the conditioning regimen in 26 cases (96%). Length of follow-up ranged between 1.1 and 29.1 yrs (median, 4.8 yrs) and the estimated 5,10, and 20 year cumulative risk of developing OS for the entire cohort was 0.5%, 3.2%, and 6.1%, respectively. An analysis of cumulative risk stratifi ed by the various risk factors, i.e., male gender (P=0.026), autologous HSCT (P=0.0007), age at HSCT (\u2264 3 yrs) (P<0.0001) and TBI (P<0.0001)showed that they signifi cantly affect the risk of OS. In the Cox proportional hazard model the factors that were found to be signifi cantly associated with increased risk of OS were: having received HSCT at an earlier age (\u2264 3 yrs) (P<0.0001); having undergone autologous HSCT (P=0.0191); or having been treated with TBI (P<0.0001). Among the 19 autologous HSCT patients with OS, 18 received TBI as part of their conditioning regimen and 10 of them were \u2264 3 yrs old at transplant. Conclusions: this is the largest analysis and description of OS in paediatric recipients, and it demonstrates that besides radiotherapy, other independent risk factors for OS are early age at HSCT and autologous transplant. Careful clinical and anamnestic examination of these patients at risk could help us to perform radiological evaluation in suspected cases.",

During follow-up (median 6,3 yrs, range 1,4-15,3 yrs) TSH, FT3, FT4, t-peroxydase (TPO)/ thyroglobulin (TG) autoantibodies (ab) were regularly evaluated in all pts; thyroid ultrasonography (US) was obtained in 30/46 pts. Results: 37/46 pts, (21 pts after ALLO SCT) showed at least one thyroid status abnormality. In particular 20/46 pts (12 pts after ALLO SCT) developed subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) at a median age of 8 yrs (range 2-21), with a median time of onset after SCT of 2 yrs (0,2-10,9). 2/46 patients developed primary hypothyroidism, after ALLO SCT for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Anti TPO/TG ab positivity was found in 28 pts (17 pts after ALLO SCT) and in 16 pts (10 after ALLO SCT) of 22 who developed hypothyroidism. US thyroid abnormalities were found in 15/30 examined pts: reduction in size (7 pts), structural dyshomogeneity (8 pts) and nodes (3 pts). Nine out 22 patients started l-thyroxine therapy after a variable time after a median time from SCT of 2,2 yrs (range 1-8), while 14/22 pts showed a transient SH and did not receive any substitutive therapy. Conclusions: In our experience 80% of pts receiving SCT after preparative regimen with BU showed an altered thyroid status. SH was the most frequent thyroid abnormality occurred in our children (45%), who in some cases needed l-thyroxine treatment. The presence of anti TPO/TG ab seems to indicate auto/ allo immune pathogenesis of thyroid hypofunction at least in 70% of our pts. These data suggest that thyroid function should be assessed regularly even in pts who received Bu-based conditioning regimens.",

            "text": "Infl ammatory BCG adenitis associated with immune reconstitution following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant in infancy E. Searle (1) Localised infl ammatory reactions at the site of BCG vaccination with ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy are well described following the initiation of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) in children with HIV (Human Immunodefi ciency Virus). This represents a manifestation of Immune Reconstitution Infl ammatory Syndrome (IRIS) and occurs as the viral load declines and the immune system recovers with rising CD4 counts. Cases: 4 cases of infl ammation at the site of previous (at birth) BCG vaccination associated with localised axillary lymphadenopathy in children post-HSCT performed in infancy have occurred in our unit (See Table 1 for case details). In 2 of the cases pathological samples have demonstrated an infl ammatory response and in all cases symptoms were associated with immune reconstitution as measured by increasing T cell numbers in the peripheral blood. As such it is the transplant equivalent of IRIS. All the 4 cases suffered associated ipsilateral, painful lymphadenopathy which in cases 1 and 2 required surgical management. Case 3 resolved spontaneously but cases 1, 2 and 4 required prednisolone to control the local infl ammatory response and lymphadenopathy. 2 of the children were treated with anti-mycobacterial cover during steroid treatment. Conclusion: Paediatric transplant and their local infectious diseases teams need to be aware of the previously un-described phenomenon of BCG-adenitis occurring with immune reconstitution following HSCT. There are distinct parallels between this pathological process and that seen in children with HIV following the initiation of HAART and the subsequent immunological improvement. Our treatment of this complication has been described above and all of our patients have either fully recovered or are making a good recovery. However further research is required to determine the frequency of this complication and the best methods of management, in particular the place of anti-TB therapy and surgical intervention. Studies have shown the effi cacy of clofarabine in resistant leukemias. We compared clofarabine with fl udarabine in a melphalan based conditioning regimen for haploidentical stem cell transplantation in pediatric patients with refractory leukemias. Patients after standard treatment (n=5) or after previous allogeneic transplantation (n=8), 9 with ALL (NR1=3, NR2=2, CR3=4), 3 with AML (NR 1=3) and 1 with MDS (NR2=1) received clofarabine 4x50mg/m\u00b2 (day -8 to -5), thiotepa 10mg/ kg (day -4), melphalan 2x70mg/m\u00b2 (day -3 to -2) and OKT3 (0,1mg/kg day -8 to +14; n=13), followed by infusion of haploidentical stem cells. We compared them with a historical group of patients (n=9) with refractory leukemias after standard treatment (n=6) or after previous transplantation (n=3), 1 with ALL (CR2=1), 7 with AML (NR1=2, NR2=4, CR3=1) and 1 with MDS (NR3=1). Depletion of T and B cells was carried out with CD3/ CD19 coated magnetic microbeads. Primary engraftment in the clofarabine group (12/13 patients) was comparable with the fl udarabine group (9/9 patients). One patient of the clofarabine group was successfully retransplanted from a second parental donor. Sustained engraftment could be obtained in all patients. Median time to ANC >500/\u00b5l with G-CSF stimulation was 10 days (9-11) in the clofarabine group vs. 11 days (9-12) in the Fludarabine group. Independence from platelet transfusion was reached after 9 days in both groups. Relapse rate was lower in the clofarabine group (9/13 patients vs. 8/9 patients, p=0.21) than in the fl udarabine group (median time to relapse: 120 days vs. 114 days). One year EFS was 23% in the clofarabine group (3/13 patients are disease free with a median follow up of 1.2 years) compared with 0% in the fl udarabine group (9/9 patients died, p=0.14). No toxicity grade 4 according to NCI-CTC grading system occurred in both groups apart from mucositis. Conclusions: clofarabine was well tolerated as part of a conditioning regimen. Compared to our standard regimen with fl udarabine, thiotepa, melphalan, the introduction of clofarabine did not result in any unexpected toxicity. Immunosuppressive effects appeared to be similar to those of fl udarabine, since primary engraftment was observed in 92%. A tendency for a lower TRM and a reduced risk of relapse in patients with refractory leukemias was observed.",

            "text": "Effective immunotherapy of donor-derived AML after unrelated stem cell transplantation I. von Luettichau (1) Donor derived acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was diagnosed in an 8 year old boy 4 years after matched unrelated stem cell transplantation (SCT) of a female donor for high risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The patient suffered from extensive chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD) demanding high doses of steroids and immunosuppressive therapy. Good response was achieved with Psoralen plus UV-A (PUVA) and extracorporal photophoresis. In the fourth year after SCT the boy presented with progressive pancytopenia. Bone marrow analysis revealed myelodysplasia with excess of blasts (20%) and Auer rods consistent with AML M2 (WHO criteria). Donor origin of the leukemic cells was confi rmed by Y-FISH (fl uorescent in situ hybridization) revealing female caryotype in all analyzed metaphasic nuclei. Short-Tandem-Repeat analysis (STR) confi rmed the 100% donor chimerism excluding secondary AML of recipient cells. The adult donor type of leukemia was further supported by the detection of the NPM1B mutation typical for a subtype of adult AML as well as a deletion of chromosome 9q. Donor derived leukemia may be due to a leukemogenic host microenvironment. There is no standard therapy regimen. Considering the low blast count in the bone marrow and the benign clinical course of the disease in our patient we started a combination of low dose chemotherapy followed by adoptive immunotherapy. The regimen comprises the transfusion of increasing numbers of donor lymphocytes (DLI) and the simultaneous application of low dose Interferon-alpha and GM-CSF following a 14 day course of low-dose cytosine arabinosid (10mg/m 2 sc BID). 4 weeks after the fi rst DLI, < 5% blasts were found in the bone marrow. Dysplasia, however, was persistent. The peripheral blood count improved, resulting in transfusion independency. We plan to continue the treatment until NPM1B mutation carrying cells are no longer detectable. So far the treatment is well tolerated and no GvHD is apparent. Taken together, adoptive immunotherapy in combination with a mild chemotherapy regimen might be feasible for this rare condition considering that the leukemic clone developed in a highly immunosuppressed setting resulting in a potentially higher sensitivity for induced immunological control of donor leukemia. (2), E. Gorczynska (2) , J. Owoc-Lempach (2) Secondary hematological malignancy (sHM) is usually considered as high risk one, however there are no standardized recommendations concerning indications and preparative regimens for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for them. Apart from that there are no available data in the literature concerning specifi cally results of allo-HSCT for sHM in children and adolescents. Objectives: To evaluate engraftment rate, non-relapse mortality and anti-leukemic effect of allo-HSCT in children with secondary hematological malignancies. Patients and methods: Retrospective analysis was performed in 12 children and adolescents (7 female, 5 male), who underwent allo-HSCT for sHM since year 2000 within transplant centers of the Polish Pediatric Group for HSCT. Median age was 11.5 years (range 6-17 years). Diagnosis consisted of secondary AML (n = 8; 4 in CR1, 4 in CR2), secondary MDS (n = 3), and secondary NHL (n = 1). Nine patients were transplanted from matched unrelated donor (MUD) and only 3 from matched sibling donor (MSD). In 6 patients preparative regimens for HSCT were based on busulfan (total dose 16 mg/kg), and in remaining 6 on treosulfan (total dose 30-36 g/m 2 ). In addition, prior MUD-HSCT, antithymoglobulin was given for T depletion in vivo. As GvHD prevention CsA+MTX was given after MUD-HSCT, and CsA alone after MSD-HSCT. Results: Non-relapse death occurred in one out of evaluated 12 patients (day +6, ARDS in course of sepsis and pneumonia in child transplanted from MUD for sAML in CR1 after PNET). Except the last one patient, who died too early, engraftment was achieved between day (+12) and (+19) (median: day +14) in all others recipients. Relapse occured in 5 patients from 3 to 14 months (median: 9 months) after HSCT, including 3 out of 8 patients with sAML (one in CR1, 2 in CR2), and in 2 out of 3 with sMDS. Six recipients are alive in CCR for 25-75 months (median: 40 months) after transplantation. Conclusions: In children with sHM the allo-HSCT after conditioning with busulfan-or treosulfan-based regimens is feasible. However, post-transplant relapse occurs in around half of them and represents the most frequent cause of treatment failure. Therefore, there is a need for further studies concerning allo-HSCT in children suffering from sHM to defi ne in the future indications for HSCT and optimum transplant procedure in this very special subgroup of pediatric patients.

At the moment of SCT 10 patients were in second complete remision (2CR), 4-in 1 CR, 3 children -in \u2265 2 CR, 5 patients had partial remision (PR) and one boy had progressive disease resistant to therapy. Conditioning before SCT was myeloablative in all and consisted of total body irradiation (TBI) with chemotherapy in 16 children and only chemotherapy -in 7 procedures. Thirteen children were transplanted from matched sibling donors (MSD) and tenfrom matched unrelated donors (MUD). Results: 22/23 patients engrafted, and in 1 child autologous recovery was observed. 11/23 children are alive (48%) and they are still in CR. Among those patients: 8 were in 2CR, 2-in 1CR and 1-in 1PR befor SCT. 12/23 patients died: 4 children (17%) died due to relapse, 3due to progression and 5 children (22%)-due to transplantation -related complications (TRM). Overall survival (OS) was 48%, with the observation time from 14 to 104 months (median 40). Conclusions: Our study suggests, that allo SCT may improve prognosis in children with recurrent NHL, when transplantation is being performed in status CR of disease. However, allo SCT doesn't improve results in patients with partial remision. The conclusion should be evalueted in a larger series of patients. Allo SCT in children with resistant or recurrent NHL is burdened with high risk of complications in those heavily pre-treated patients. Introduction: Allogenic haematopietic progenitor cell transplantation (Allo-HPCT) is the cornerstone in the treatment of a wide spectrum of hematological malignancies in children. Its success is highly affected by recurrence of the underlying disease. Chimerism follow up is essential to fi nd out patients at higher risk of recurrence. Objective: To analyze the impact of chimerism status at days +30, +60 and +90 post Allo HPCT regarding clinical outcome Material and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 91 patients (male=51 and female=40) with underlying malignancies who underwent Allo-HPCT between November 1987 and September 2008. Patient age ranged from 0.5 to 19 years (median=7.58). Diagnosis included Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL=53), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML=30) and others (O=6). Chimerism status was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) at days +30, +60 and +90 after Allo HPCT. Chimerism was defi ned as Complete Chimerism (CC) when there was no evidence of autologous cell at any time post transplant, as Mixed Chimerism (MC) when both recipient and donor cells where found and Null Chimerism (NC) when complete autologous reconstitution was seen. Results: 31 out of 91 patients (ALL=18, AML=12, O=1) relapsed after Allo-HPCT. Median time to relapse was 114 days (25-844). All relapsed patients eventually died (Disease progression (DP) =27, Sepsis (S) =2, Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) =2). 28 other children died in remission (S=4, GVHD=2, Viral Infec-tions=3, Other=19). Mean follow up was 833.5 days \u00b1 1238.1. At day +30 median relapse-free-survival was 14,53 months in patients with CC, 12.3 months with MC and 2.07 months in children with NC (p<0.05). Median Overall-survival was 15.02 months in patients with CC at day +30, 12.37 months with MC and 2.07 months in children with NC (p<0,05).",

Diagnosis included Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL=8), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML=12), Neuroblastoma (NB=7), Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL=1), Myelodisplastic Syndrome (MDS=1) and Meduloblastoma (MB=1). 21 patients underwent Autologous HPCT (ALL=4, AML=9, NB=7, MB=1) and 9 Allogenic HPCT (ALL=4, AML=3, NHL=1, MDS=1).

Most frequent cause of death in both groups was disease progression. HPCT is a useful therapeutic strategy, but special considerations should be taken into account when transplanting infants. ALL behaves very aggressive in this age group. The role of auto HPCT for infant leukaemia has yet to be established. Infants with NB have a favourable biological feature and thus, prognosis is better compared to older children.",

From January 1996 to November 2008 27 pts (M/F-11/16) with highrisk pelvic ES (localized 21 pts, metastatic 9 pts (only lungs-2, combined-7) received HDCT with autologous transplantation as a consolidation. The median primary tumor volume (PTV) was 739 cm\u00b3. CT consisted of 5 courses: 1, 3, and 5 included cyclophosphamide 2100 mg/m\u00b2/day on days 1,2, doxorubicin 37.5 mg/m\u00b2 as a 24-hour infusion on days 1,2, and vincristine 1.5 mg/m\u00b2 on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles 2 and 4 consisted of ifosfamide 2400 mg/m\u00b2/day on days 1-5 and VP-16 100 mg/ m\u00b2/day on days 1-5. No G-CSF was given routinely between cycles. Radiation therapy was given after the fi fth cycle of CT at athe median dose of 52 Gy (range, 50-56). Patients with lung involvement uniformly received lung irradiation after the second cycle of CT at a dose of 10.8-12 Gy. As a consolidation all pts received busulfan 16 mg/kg, melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2-based high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) (n=8); with the addition of thiotepa (TT) 600-900 mg/m\u00b2 (n=10) or etoposide (VP16) 1400 mg/m\u00b2 (n=9) followed by autologous stem cell rescue (6.4 (1.9-25.3)x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg). Median number of days to WBC>1.0x10 9 /l and Plt>20 and 50x10 9 /l was 10 (8-14), 16 (0-52) and 28 (11-66) days, respectively. TRM was 11% (3 pts out of 27). Eight pts relapsed (5 of them with primary metastatic disease). EFS and DFS were 58% and 66% with a median follow-up of 86 and 96 mo, respectively. EFS and DFS in TT, VP16 and BuMel groups were 56%, 50% and 73% and 63%63% and 73%, respectively. One pt had ileus 3 mo after BMT and had successful surgery. Our results support the hypothesis that pts with high-risk pelvic ES may benefi t from BuMel-based regimens and that an addition of any drug to BuMel regimen increases a toxicity with no infl uence to DFS. Optimal busulfan (BU) pharmacokinetic data have been established for stem cell transplantation (SCT) setting, and dose adjustment is made based on \"therapeutic\" BU area under concentration-time curve (AUC) calculation for individual blood level determination. Srivastava (Blood 2004) assessed BU pharmacokinetic analysis and impact of glutathione Stransferase (GST) genes polymorphism on the risk of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD). In that study, pharmacokinetic analysis showed higher clearance of BU among patients with VOD and higher frequency of GSTM1-null genotype, suggesting that GSTM1-null predisposes to HVOD. In a pilot study of the Rambam Medical Center, BU pharmacokinetics were measured in 25 children with congenital hemoglobinopathies undergoing SCT; 5 of them with biopsy-proven liver cirrhosis. Dose adjustments were performed according to the BU AUC. Only 1/25 patients had HVOD, a young child with no cirrhosis and low BU level. This fi nding was in discrepancy with the higher incidence of VOD (29%) reported by Srivastava. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of BU disposition and GST-M1 polymorphism on occurrence of VOD in children receiving BU as conditioning regimen prior to SCT. Patients: 25 children (13 females and 12 males) received BU (12-16 mg/kg) before SCT; individual BU levels were analyzed after a second dose, and dose adjustments were performed to reach AUC between 900-1100 \u00b5M* min. Sixteen children had congenital hemoglobinopathy, 3 immunodefi ciency, 3 neuroblastoma, 2 Hurler syndrome, and 1 AML. Median age at transplantation -4 years (range 3 m.-16 y). Genetic analysis of GST M1 polymorphism was determined by PCR of DNA extracted from peripheral blood taken prior to SCT. Results: GSTM1-null genotype was found in 65.4% of the children. Only 2 patients developed VOD, one with thalassemia major and wild type/heterozygote GSTM1, and the other with Hurler syndrome and GSTM1-null genotype. Both had low BU AUC and dose adjustments were done. Conclusions: The incidence of GSTM1-null genotype (65.4%) was signifi cantly higher than previously reported (table) . Despite this, the incidence of VOD was very low, suggesting that adjusting BU to well defi ned therapeutic levels may ameliorate the effect of GSTM1-null genotype on BU pharmacokinetics, allow greater exposure to the drug, prevent its toxicity and occurrence of VOD.",

This is the fi rst report on identical twins transplanted from a single BM harvest. This was a save procedure in respect to the cell dosage since the recipients weighed 22 kg. The difference in GVHD in both patients was unexspected, since cells of a single donor came in contact with genetically identical hosts and induced a very different immunological reaction (GVHD). Our HSCT might point to host factors (virus infections, cytokines etc.) leading to different immune reactions in otherwise identical donor recipient pairs.

The conditioning regimen consisted of intravenous busulfan 3.2 mg/kg in once daily infusion for 2 days, and fl udarabine 30mg/m\u00b2 6 days, antithymoglobuline 2.5 mg/kg, 1 d for related and 2 d for unrelated donor. GVH prophylaxis consists in cyclosporine alone. Results: This is an intermediate analysis in 20 heavily pretreated children with a median age of 13.8 years at transplant (4.8-20.2) with 14 males and 6 females. Six patients had malignant solid tumors (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma), 5 had acute myeloblastic leukemia, 2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 7 Hodgkin's lymphoma. 16 patients had more than 3 lines of chemotherapy; 8 patients had previous autologous stem cell transplantation. 12 children were allografted in active disease (partial remission, relapse, progression or refractory disease) and 8 were in complete remission. 13 patients had an HLA-matched sibling donor,7 had an unrelated donor. Graft source was PBSC in 8 cases and bone marrow in 12 cases. The median time from diagnosis to allograft was 22 months. Concerning the hematologic recovery, the median time to reach absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 500 cells/mm 3 is 16 days. The median days under 25 000/mm 3 for platelet is 5 days. Evaluation of chimerism is available for 18 children. At day 30 post-transplant, chimerism is mainly donor for sixteen children (14 with complete chimerism \u2265 95% of donor's cells; 2 children with mixed chimerism and \u2265 80% of donor's cells). At day 60 post-transplant, the 2 previous children had a complete chimerism. Only one patient had primary graft failure at day 30. 8 children experienced acute GVHD grade I-II and 2 experienced grade IV. At the date of the cut-off, 15 children are alive. Conclusion: Even if further follow-up is needed the reduced intensity conditioning combining i.v. busulfan and fl udarabine is feasible, safe and effective. This regimen enables to perform allo HSCT in children not eligible for a myeloablative conditioning.",

Delayed and/or insuffi cient recovery leads to an increased risk of post-SCT complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate immunological reconstitution and antibody responses to vaccines post HSCT and prospectively evaluate the two processes among recipients of pediatric allogenic stem cell grafts. Material and methods: Twenty-three long-term (> 18 mos) survivors of pediatric HSCT with a mean age of 8,5 yrs with either a malignant (18) or non-malignant (5) disease were transplanted using a matched unrelated (11) or sibling donor (12). T-cell recovery was evaluated by analyzing lymphocyte subpopulations by fl ow cytometry, determining T-lymphocyte responses to key mitogens and measuring antibody responses to established antigens. B-cell recovery was studied by fl ow cytometry and functionally by ELISPOT. The effects of scheduled passive immunization following HSCT were also analysed. Results: The absence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) associated with a brisk recovery of both cellular and humoral immunity by 18 months post HSCT among the pediatric recipients of allogeneic grafts. However, the presence of cGHVD associated with a slowing down in the process and only 40% of these recipients reached the values of the immunosuppressed, non-transplant controls during the follow-up in the multitude of parameters analysed. Prior to revaccination protective antibody levels were found for tetanus in 66% of recipients, for Hib in 44%, for measles in 36%, for all 3 poliovirus serotypes in 75% and for all 7 pneumococcal serotypes in 0%. Post revaccination protective antibody levels were found for tetanus in 96% of recipients, for Hib in 100%, for measles in 88%, for all 3 poliovirus serotypes in 83% and for all 7 pneumococcus serotypes in 48%. None of the parameters analysed to illustrate the immunological recovery process was predictive of immunization responses post HSCT. Conclusions: Among pediatric recipients of allogeneic stem cell grafts cGVHD, particularly in its extensive form, and its therapy appear to have a profound tampering effect on a multitude of aspects in the immunological recovery post HSCT. Yet, as a response to passive immunization most of these children appeared to attain protective antibody levels without complications attributable to the revaccination program.",

Liver is the main source of FVIII, and little is know about the potential for synthesis by other tissues and organs. Studies of organ transplant recipients raise the possibility that lymphatic tissue, spleen, lung may compensate for defi cient hepatic FVIII production. We report a boy with severe hemophilia A (mutation of exon 14) and relapsed anaplastic large cell lymphoma, successfully treated by transplantation of unrelated cord blood. A.K. hemophilia A diagnosed at 18 months in his country, treated with blood transfusion and cryoprecipitate and at 6 years, upon immigration in Italy, with FVIII. At 12 years he developed a localized scapular mass, excised and treated with chemotherapy followed by consolidation with autologous HSCT. At months +18 shows systemic lymphadenomegaly; histological diagnosis was ALCL. Treated according to the EICNHL protocol, for Relapsed ALCL. After 3 chemotherapy blocks, he underwent HSCT from an unrelated cord blood unit; HLA match was 4/6, CD34 count 2x10 5 /kg. Conditioning regimen included Thiotepa 10 mg/kg, Etoposide 40 mg/kg and TBI 12 Gy. During the entire transplant phase, platelets were infused every other day, aiming at count >30,000/\u00b5l, RhFVIII 1,000 IU every 12 hours. Neutropenia was complicated by Pseudomonas a. and Klebsiella septicemia. Stable engraftment was documented for neutrophils since day +30 and for platelets (>50 000/ml) since day +42. On day +44 he was readmitted for hemorrhagic cystitis. At present, on day +65, he is doing well. VNTR analysis showed 100% donor engraftment. Clotting test results and the FVIII level are similar to pre-BMT values. No inhibitors were present before or after transplantation. Conclusion:To our knowledge this is the third case of HSCT in hemophiliac patients, after one child with severe aplastic anemia transplanted from his HLA-identical unaffected 5-year-old brother, and a 26-year-old HIV-infected man with Burkitt-type ALL transplanted from his homozygous twin brother. In both the FVIII level did not change after transplant, suggesting that bone marrow cells does not contribute signifi cantly to FVIII production. (GvHD) prophylaxis, while 4 patients received CSA, methotrexate (MTX) and steroid, and one patient received CSA and MTX. After a median follow up of 9 months (3-26); 7 patients survived. Two patients died before 100 days post unrelated UCBT due to sever sepsis while one patient died 6 months post related UCBT due to relapse of Philadelphia chromosome ALL. The overall survival was 70%.The median stay in the hospital was 53 days (26-120). Five patients (50%) were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, 2 of them died with sever sepsis, while 3 patients survived. Three patients (30%) had primary graft failure, one with FA and he is still alive after haploidentical allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at day 75 post unrelated UCBT, the second patient with CML had auto recovery and still alive, while the third patient had ALL and died with sever sepsis. Seven patients (70%) had neutrophil and platelets engraftment. The median time for neutrophil engraftment was 20 days (15-30), and 40 days (21-84) for platelets engraftment. Five patients (50%) had acute GVHD of skin that necessitate systemic steroid treatment, 2 of them had additional liver GvHD, and third patient had gut and liver GVHD. No patient had chronic GVHD. Conclusions: UCBT can be performed in developing countries with considerable success. The evolving experience will lead to better outcome in the coming years. There is an increasing need for establishing public cord blood banks in our area; to save more lives through having more readily available cord blood units for transplantation.",

Results: Patients were consisted of nine medulloblastoma patients, two pineoblastoma and one germ cell tumor patients. Six patients were under age of four years. Ten patients were in complete response (CR) status and two patients in partial response at fi rst HDCT. During the 17 months of median follow up period (range 2~47 months), six patients are alive in CR, six patients failed to survive owing to relapse and disease progression after HDCTs. There were two treatment-related mortalities (TRMs) during 22 HDCTs. Myelosupression, stomatitis and infections were most frequent major acute toxicities, and most common long term complications of the survivors were growth hormone defi ciency (4/6), thyroid hormone defi ciency (3/6) and alopecia (3/6). Both two patients with TRM received more than seven cycles of chemotherapy before HDCT since they were relapsed cases. Three survivors who were under age of four at diagnosis received radiotherapy after completion of HDCTs. Conclusion: HDCT followed by autologous HSCT was tolerable in childhood high risk and relapsed CNS tumor patients.

Introduction: Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a major complication in Pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HC has a spectrum of manifestations that range from microscopic hematuria to severe hemorrhage. When severe, HC causes signifi cant morbidity, leads to renal complications, prolongs hospitalization, and occasionally contributes to death. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively studied the medical records of 598 children (<15 years), undergoing HSCT at Hematology-Oncology and SCT Research Center (Tehran, Iran) between 1991 and 2008 to describe the incidence, clinical course, and outcome of HC in all patients and to identify the risk factors for HC. Conditioning regimens varied according to disease and clinical status. Results: 26 recipients (4.3%), 21 boys and 5 girls developed severe HC. The indications for HSCT (24 allogeneic, 2 autologous) were Thalassemia major in 12 patients, Acute",

One went on to develop acute renal failure due to urinary obstruction and required cystotomy. From these three patients, two deaths were directly linked to the HC. Discussion: In our series, severe HC occurred in 26 of 598 patients (4.3%), an incidence lower than that of adult reports. This study shows that young age correlated with a lower incidence of severe HC. A prospective study is necessary to clarify the association between clinical factors in the development of severe HC following HSCT in children. Background: Creatinine clearance can overestimate renal function in malnourished patients. Cistatine C is a protein produced in all nucleated cells. Its elimination depends exclusively upon glomerular fi ltration, which makes it a good target for glomerular function evaluation. Patients and methods: Thirteen consecutive patients undergoing SCT were included in this prospective observational study aimed to compare the glomerular fi ltration rates (GFR) obtained through both, creatinine clearance and cistatine plasma levels. Main diagnosis, characteristics of patients and type of transplant are reported in table I. Blood samples were obtained in the same day for creatinine and cistatine, 24h after urine collection, in three separate time-points, so a total of 39 samples were recruited on each arm. GFR was calculated in the regular way for creatinine clearance and then corrected for body surface. The following formula (74,835/CistCexp 1,333) was applied to extrapolate GFR from cistatine plasma levels, and no further corrections were applied. GFR results obtained with both methods were compared with T student and Pearson correlation tests (SPSS). Results: We have not found a signifi cant difference between GFR obtained through both techniques (T student, table II) and moreover, there is a positive correlation between them (Pearson correlation 0.003, table III). Comment: In our transplanted patients, cistatina plasmatic levels are a good alternative to evaluate GFR although no signifi cant differences were found with creatinine clearance.",

There was no relationship between the baseline nutritional status and survival. At hospital discharge, 40% (21pts) showed mild to moderate malnutrition and 17% (9pts) severe malnutrition. During hospitalization 6 (11%) patients lost 5-10% of body weight and 3 (6%) lost more than 10%. There was no relationship between pathology, length of hospital stay and weight loss. Fourteen (26%) patients received enteral nutritional (EN) via tube for an average of 12.7\u00b111.5 days, to supply an average of 30.4 kcal/kg/day and 0.9g protein/kg/day.

There was no statistical difference in the incidence of vomiting, diarrhea and hyperglycemia among patients who received EN, PN or exclusively oral feeding. Conclusion: We observed a high prevalence of malnutrition prior to HSCT. In this cohort of pts the use of enteral nutrition did not lead to increased gastrointestinal complications and could be used earlier in the transplant course in order to prevent weight loss during HSCT.",

Vettenranta Hospital for Children and Adolescents (Helsinki, FI) Background: Delayed immune reconstitution and opportunistic infections following pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) associate with an increased treatment-related morbidity and mortality. We retrospectively evaluated in a single institution setting the impact of viral infections on the post-transplant recovery of pediatric recipients of stem cell grafts as an indicator of their post-transplant immunoreconstitution. Material and methods: Between 1/1999 and 9/2006 a total of 180 (56 autologous and 124 allogeneic) patients with a mean age of 7.9 yrs with either a malignant (160) or non-malignant (20) disease were transplanted using a matched unrelated (79) or sibling donor (45) or given autologous stem cell rescue (56). TBI was included in the conditioning in 12/56 autologous and 116/124 allogeneic cases. No method of T cell depletion was employed. Cyclosporine and MTX were given as GVHD prophylaxis. No viral prophylaxis was employed. The medical histories were retrospectively reviewed for single or multiple viral S231 infectious episodes during the fi rst two years post-transplant and correlated with the respective clinical parameters. Results: 42% of the allogeneic stem cell recipients developed chronic GVHD: 21/52 limited and the rest extensive. 33/56 (59%) of the autologous and 109/124 (76%) of the allogeneic patients had at least one viral reactivation/clinical infection post-transplant. The viruses were categorized into two groups: latent (117/180, 65%) and nosocomial viruses (62/180, 35%). In a multivariate analysis of the allogeneic group chronic GVHD (P=0,001; Risk Rate =4,7) and secondary graft failure (P=0, 02; Risk Rate=4, 9) were signifi cantly associated with early multiple viral infections. Conclusions: Our data indicate that viruses are common clinical pathogens among pediatric recipients of stem cell grafts. However, multiple viral infections early on seem to refl ect a more severe degree of immunological derangement in the recipient and appear to identify a group of recipients with an increased risk of chronic GVHD.

The median age at transplant was 16.9 years (13-21). They were 6 males and 5 females. Ten patients received reduced intensity conditioning and only one myeloablative. Five patients were transplanted from HLA-identical sibling, 3 from mismatched family donor and 3 from unrelated donor, who were one matched and 2 mismatched. Graft was demonstrated in 10 patients. Six patients died after allogeneic HSCT without relapse or progression, and one after disease progression. The causes of death were acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease associated with infection and multiorgan failure in 3 patients, veno-occlusive disease in 2 patients and interstitial pneumonia in one. The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) at one year was 0.43 \u00b1 0.15 at 12 months. The actuarial overall survival and event-free-survival was 0.29 \u00b1 0.15 and 0.22 \u00b1 0.13 at 57 months respectively. These patients with recurrent or refractory disease have a fair chance of cure. We observe very high TRM in this study, instead of reduced intensive conditioning. Three patients are long survivors without disease at 8, 13 and 57 months. Two are survivors after related and one after unrelated transplant.

From March 2003 to February 2008, 17 chil-dren who received tacrolimus and minidose MTX as prophylaxis were reviewed, with median age of 6.8 years (range 1.4 -17 years). Nine patients underwent related donar transplants and 8 underwent unrelated donar transplants. All patients received tacrolimus beginning the day prior to transplant at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day by continuous iv infusion. Tacrolimus levels were monitored every other day and dosages adjusted to maintain serum levels 5-15 ng/ml. MTX 5 mg/m\u00b2 i.v. was given on days 1, 3, 6 and 11. The dose was reduced or omitted for severe mucositis. The median follow-up for patients was 22 months. All patients except one who had a unrelated cord blood transplant were successfully engrafted. The median time to ANC recovery ( ANC \u2265 500 x 10 6 /l) was 15 days. The incidence of acute GVHD was 22.2% with related donar group and 42.8% with unrelated group. The incidence of grade III-IV GVHD was 0% with related donar group and 14.2% with unrelated group. There was no case with chronic GVHD on both groups. Two patients had documented relapse post-transplant. The actual relapse rate at 1 year was 14%. Day-100 survival was 82%, and the survival at 1 year was 70%. The administered dose of tacrolimus to achieve therapeutic level (5-15 ng/ml) was 0.042 mg/kg/d for younger age group (< 8 yrs) compare to 0.028 mg/kg/d for older age group ( \u2265 8 yrs). Common adverse effects of tacrolimus included hypomagnesemia (88%), nephrotoxicity (23%), hyperglycemia (23%), hypertension (5%). Overall, tacrolimus and minidose MTX was well tolerated and effective as prophylaxis for acute GVHD in pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation. And children < 8 years old undergoing HSCT should receive a higher dose of tacrolimus in order to avoid the subtherapeutic level.",

Intravenous (iv) formulation of Bu should reduce intra-inter individual variability in drug systemic exposure, limiting the risk of regimen related toxicity and graft failure. Between June 2005 and May 2008, 50 consecutive Bthal patients from the Middle East underwent SCT from an HLA identical sibling in our center with an iv Bu/Cy based conditioning regimen. iv Bu dosage was given according to weight and adjusted from the fi th dose to a target AUC 1250 umol/min. Median age was 8 years (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) , one patient classifi ed as Pesaro class I, 24 class II and 25 class III. Most patients had severe iron overload evidenced by irregular iron chelation (42/50) and high median ferritin 2973 ug/L(956-14280). Median ALT and AST level was 71 U/L(12-545) and 59 U/L(18-371), liver fi brosis median Ishak stage 3 (0-5) and 16/50 patients were HCV pos (32%). Class I-II patients were conditioned with iv Bu and Cy200mg/kg(n19) with thiotepa(TT 10mg/ kg) if <4 years(n6). Class III patients received fl udarabine(Flu) 100(n6) or 150mg/m2(n16), iv Bu and Cy 160mg/kg(n22) and ATG(n16); patients receiving a second SCT following graft rejection (n3) received Flu 150mg/m2, iv Bu, Cy 200 mg/kg, TT 10 mg/kg and ATG. All patients received anti veno-occlusive disease (VOD) prophylaxis with defi brotide. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A(CyA) and methotrexate, with methylprednisolone given to patients not receiving ATG. S232 33 patients(66%) achieved Bu AUC in the expected range of 900-1500 umol/min following the fi rst dose. Seventeen patients (34%) required dose adjustment because either above (n9) or below (n8) the expected range. Post transplant toxicity was mild and characterized by: hemorrhagic cystitis(n4), CyA neurotoxicity(n3), VOD(n1), grade II-IV stomatitis(n7), reversible lung infi ltrates of unknown origin(n4). The incidence of acute GvHD II-IV was 5/47 (4 grade II, 1 grade III). Limited chronic GvHD was observed in 3/47 patients. At a median follow-up of 528 days (112-936), 98% pts are alive and current thalassemia free survival is 94% of which 100% in class I-II pts and 88% in class III.

Patients and Methods: A total of 20 patients with Thalassemia Major (14 in risk class 3; 5 in risk class 2 ; 2 in risk class 1) were conditioned with hydroxyurea (OHU) 60 mg/kg and azathioprine 3 mg/kg from from day -59 to day-11, fl udarabine (FLU) 30 mg/ m\u00b2 from day -17 to day -11, busulfan (BU) 14 mg/kg starting on day -10, and cyclophosphamide (CY) 200 mg/kg, Thiotepa 10 mg/kg and ATG 12,5 mg/kg daily from days -5 to -2 (Fresenius S). Twelfe patients received positively-selected CD34+ mobilized peripheral and bone marrow progenitor cells using the CliniMacs procedure. In a second court of eight patients in order to retain NK cells in the graft, negative selection of B and T-lymphocytes (CD3/CD19 depletion) of haploidentical marrrow was employed rather than CD34+ selection. Total T-cell dose was adjusted to 2 x 10 5 /kg by fresh bone marrow donor cell add back at the time of transplant. Both groups received cyclosporin after transplant for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis during the fi rst two months after transplantation. Results: Two patient died during post-transplant day, one on day +114 of cerebral EBV lymphoma, the second on day +92 of CMV pneumonia. Six patients reject their grafts, and 12 showed full chimerism with functioning grafts at a median follow-up of 38 months. None of the ten patients showed AGVHD or CGVHD. Conclusion: These preliminary report suggest that maternal haploidentical HSC is feasible therapeutic option for thalassemic patients lacking a matched related donor. With the increasing availability combined cell therapies with the potential to improve engraftment and immune recovery such as NK cells, regulatory T cells, mesenchymal stem cells, haploidentical transplantation will play an increasing role in allogenic transplantation.

Jalili Hematology-Oncology and SCT Research Center (Tehran, IR) Objective: Follow-up of patients with Severe Beta Thalassemia transplanted in Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran. Methods: 381 patients (165 female, 216 male) received allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) between 1991 and 2008. 358 patients were thalassemia major (106 patients in class I, 132 patients in class 2 and 120 patients in class 3) and 23 patients were thalassemia intermediate. 366 patients received stem cell from healthy full human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched siblings, 5 patients from other related (HLA-matched confi rms with high resolution method) and 10 patients from other related with one antigen mismatch. The graft source was bone marrow in 165 patients, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in 207 patients and cord blood in 9 patients. For 10 patients second transplantation was performed. Median age at HSCT was 6 years (range, 2-28 years). 272 patients were conditioned with Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, 59 patients with antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclophosphamide and Busulfan and 50 patients with ATG, Busulfan and Fludarabine. No radiation therapy was given. For graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, we used cyclosporine and Methotrexate. Results: Median follow-up was 2.5 years. 319 (83.7%) patients are alive and 62 (16.3%) patients died. Most common causes of death include GVHD in 25 patients, infection in 11 patients and graft failure in 7 patients. 5-year overall survival and disease free survival was 80% (se=2.4%) and 70% (se=2.8%) respectively. Median time to ANC engraftment (ANC>0.5 x 10 9 /I) was 15 days (range 6-73 days) and for platelets engraftment (PLT >20 x 10 9 /l) was 22 days (range 6-92 days). Acute GvHD was seen in 67% of patients. Conclusions: Allogeneic HSCT remains the only cure for severe beta thalassaemia. Now we are the second after Pesaro team, regarding large number of transplanted thalassemia patients. In order to make this treatment available to more patients, we should enlarge the donor pool. As there are marriages among relatives in some countries, we may fi nd HLA-identical relatives. It should consider that patients with thalassemia who lack sibling donor but have HLA-identical relatives should be transplanted before they are in class 3. In this study we analysed the potential role of NK cells in haploidentical transplant for beta-thalassemia patients. A total of 11 pediatric patients with beta-thalassemia received T and B cell depleted transplants from their haploidentical mothers. T and B cell depletion was carried out with CD34+ CliniMACS selection (Miltenyi Biotec\u00a9) from peripheral blood and bone marrow of donors (the mothers) and resulted in grafts consisting of stem cells and effector cells (NK cells, monocytes) with the addition of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs 3 x 10 5 /kg of the recipient). To analyse the mechanisms involved in immunological reconstitution post transplant, we analysed T cell subsets by fl ow cytometry, particularly NK cells at day + 20 and + 60 post transplant. Day + 20 post transplant, the patients had significantly lower CD4+ T cells in comparison to the controls (1.9 \u00b1 1.4% vs. 47.5 \u00b1 6% respectively), whereas CD8+ T cells numbers did not statistically differ between patients and controls (24.2 \u00b1 33.7% vs. 20 \u00b1 7%). NK cells were among the fi rst lymphocytes to repopulate the peripheral blood, and up to 70% of these cells were CD3-CD56+bright cells. Interestingly, a direct correlation has been observed between the percentages of CD56+CD16+ NK subset and the BM engraftment (in mean 71 \u00b1 21% CD56+CD16+ in the four patients with full engraftment, 27 \u00b1 28% in the three patients with a stable mixed chimerism after BM transplant (70-80% of donor cells) and 1.4 \u00b1 1% in the four patients with rejection). In all the patients the origin of the NK subsets was from the mothers. Day + 60 post transplant an increase in the percentages of CD4+ T cells, na\u00efve CD4+ cells and in thymic na\u00efve Th cells were observed (3 \u00b1 1.2%, S233 2.9 \u00b1 2.1%, 2.7 \u00b1 1%, respectively). CD8+ T cells were also increased (in mean 35 \u00b1 27.5%), in parallel with the increase of the CD3-CD16+ NK cells (potent cytotoxic effector cells) especially in the patients with full engraftment (in mean 47 \u00b1 20% vs. 28 \u00b1 31% in mixed chimerism).We observed higher percentages of NK subsets just twenty days post transplant in the patients with full engraftment respect the mixed chimerism and the rejection, suggesting a role of donor NK cells on engraftment and on prevention of the rejection with the attack of the host lympho-hematopoietic cells especially in haploidentical recipients.

Shamshiri Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center (Tehran, IR) Objective: Following a positive phase II study in all classes of thalassemia major, in this study we aimed to show that co-transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from HLA-identical related donors after conditioning regimen is safe and could facilitate engraftment and decrease graft versus host disease (GVHD). Methods: Between November 2006 and December 2008, 28 class III thalassemia major patients were enrolled. In this doubleblind randomized clinical trial, HLA-identical related donors HSC were transplanted (non-MSCs group, n=16 with median age of 14.5yrs and F/M=5/7) or co-transplanted with MSCs (MSCs group, n=12 with median age of 14.0yrs and F/M=3/13) in thalassemia major patients. Patients received Cyclophosphamidebased or Fludarabine-based conditioning regimens and short course methotrexate and cyclosporine as GVHD prophylaxis. On day 0, MSCs group patients were given MSCs intravenously 4 hours before infusion of either bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells. The number of MSCs infused was 1.45-1.75x10 6 / kg. Results: MSCs infusions were well tolerated. The median time to neutrophil engraftment (absolute neutrophil count >0.5x10 9 / L) was 18 days for MSCs group and 20 days for non-MSCs group (p-value=0.31). The median time to platelet engraftment (platelet count >20x10 9 / L) was 23 and 25 days, respectively (p-value=0.57). Acute GVHD was observed respectively, in 10(62.5%) and 5(41.7%). Chronic GVHD was found in 3/7(42.9%) and 5/11(45.5%) evaluable patients (p-value=1.0). Median follow-up duration for alive patients was 5 months (ranged [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The number of patients who not engrafted were 1(6.3%) and 2(16.7%) (p-value=0.56), and mortality rates were 3(18.8%) and 4(33.3%), respectively (p-value=0.42). Conclusion: In this study we demonstrated that co-transplantation of HLA-identical related donors MSCs with HSCs is seems to be safe. Although the above mentioned differences are weighing a partial superiority of MSC group, but we didn't fi nd statistical signifi cant difference in acute GVHD incidence, rate of non-engraftment, mortality rate and median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery between two groups. Most probably explanations are small number of patients in study groups and short follow-up period.",

Kurt, Z. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, V. Hazar, A. Yesilipek Akdeniz University School of Medicine (Antalya, TR) Allogeneic transplantation (BMT) is the only curative option for thalassemia major (TM). Complete donor haematopoiesis is not essential for sustained engraftment and the simultaneous presence of haematopoietic cells of both donor and recipient origin is not a rare event after a transplant. However there is evidence that MC is associated with an increased risk of graft failure and/or disease recurrence and the presence of more than 25% residual host cells within the fi rst 2 months is highly indicative for graft rejection. Patients with MC may benefi t from donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) by eradication of residual host cells. In this study, we retrospectively review transplanted thalassemia patients with MC in whom DLI was used to reverse relapse. In our center, DLI was used in 17 transplanted thalassemia patients. Totally 52 DLI was used and the median infusion number per patient was 3 range 1-8). Median duration between the transplantation and fi rst DLI was 5 months (1.5-13.5 m) . DLI was done in fi ve patients due to presence of more than 25% of residual host cells within 2 months after BMT and in rest of the patients due to gradual increase in residual host cells and/or decrease in hemoglobine levels. Eleven out of 17 patients have been followed as transfusion independent. The median hemoglobine levels in transfusion independent patients before and after DLI were 7.25 gr/dL(6.3-9.9) and 9.55 gr/dL(7.3-12.9), respectively. In this group of transfusion independent patients the median percentage of donor-derived cells before and after DLI were 41% (23-64) and 49% (30-100) respectively. Two out of fi ve patients who had DLI within two months after BMT due to presence of more than 25% of residual host cells became transfusion independent. The median CD3 cell count per DLI was 1.5x10 7 /kg (range 1.5x10 7 / kg-1x10 8 /kg). All fi ve patients in whom cell counts higher than 1.5x10 7 /kg were used became transfusion independent. In three patients two of which were receiving higher cell counts, grade II-IV GVHD developed at 2.5, 3, 4 months after DLI. Our results showed that patients with MC characterized by the presence of high numbers of residual host cells even within the fi rst two months after transplantation benefi t from DLI. Although the proposed cell count for DLI is 1.5x10 7 CD3 cells/kg, the higher doses may add benefi t in changing the balance between thalassemic and donor cells but should be evaluated in larger group of patients.",

Napolitano, F. Ferrua, A. Biffi , T. Roccia, M.G. Roncarolo, F. Ciceri, B. Cappelli Scientifi c Institute Osp. San Raffaele (Milan, IT) Severe neurotoxicity (tremors, insomnia, agitation, headache, hallucinations, seizures, cortical blindness, aphasia and ataxia) is a recognized complication of Cyclosporine A (CSA). We describe 6 cases of CSA related neurotoxicity out of 67 HLA identical sibling BMT performed between June 2005 and Nov 2008, in middle east patients (pt) affected by haemoglobinopaties (pts characteristics in tables). There was no correlation between serum CSA levels and seizures occurrence. The clinical and radiological fi ndings disappeared discontinuing CSA and switching to Tacrolimus. All patients are symptoms-free at a median of 460 days of follow up (range 72-866). Conclusions: Our experience suggests that pts with thalassemia have a high incidence of CSA related neurological events but that there is no correlation between serum CSA levels and seizure occurrence. Prognosis is good following CSA removal. Specifi c prodromes such as headache, hypertension or visual disturbances occurring in the early posttransplant period should be carefully evaluated with electrophysiological and imaging strategies in order to start promptly effective treatment and reduce possible irreversible sequaelae. Objectives: Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) is the only defi nitive cure for Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA). We report the outcomes of SCT from HLA-matched related donors in 7 SCA patients (pts), performed in our Institute (Mediterranean Institute of Hematology) in Rome. Methods: between October 2004 and December 2006, 7 pts affected by SCA (median age of 13 years; range 2-16 years) underwent SCT. The indications for SCT were: recurrent severe pain crisis and/or chronic blood transfusions (4 pts), acute chest syndrome and pain crisis (2 pts), avascular necrosis of multiple joints and pain crisis (1 pt). Two patients were HCV positive. Patients on chronic blood transfusions have received cytoreductive/immunosuppressive treatment with hydroxyurea, azathioprine and fl udarabine before conditioning regimen. The conditioning regimen consisted of Bu 14, Cy 200 and ATG for 6 pts and Bu14 and Cy 160 for 1 pt. As GVHD prophylaxis, all patients received \"short MTX\", cyclosporine (CsA) and methylprednisolone (MP). Results: all patients obtained full engraftment. Acute grade 2-3 GVHD was observed in 4 pts. Three pts had moderate chronic GVHD. CMV reactivation was observed in 5 pts. One pt died 1 year after SCT in her home country, likely due to septic shock, while she still was on immunosuppressive treatment for chronic GVHD.

Marziali (1) Background: Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative option for patients with thalassemia. After HSCT is particularly important to recover a complete immune reconstitution for prevention of opportunistic infections. Methods: The immunological phenotype of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 110 consecutively subjects after HLA identical HSCT performed for beta-thalassemia were studied. CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD3-CD19+, CD3-CD16+CD56+ were evaluated by Flow Cytometry at 6 and 12 months after HSCT in 70 patients followed. In a part of patients CD4 na\u00efve T cells was also evaluated at 12 months after HSCT. Results: at 6 months after HSCT we observed reduction of the mean of CD4 T cell percentage in patients respect normal value: in mean 17, 5% \u00b1 9 vs 45% \u00b1 10 respectively. After 1 year the rate of CD4+ T-cell population progressively increase: 24 \u00b1 9 at 12 months vs 17, 5% \u00b1 9 at 6 months, but the mean of CD4+ T-cell count was persistently lower than in controls. The mean of CD8 T cell is stable during the follow up and the CD4/C8 ratio decreased. The mean of the CD19 increase during the follow up ( 4,5% at 6 months vs 17% at 12 months). At 1 year after HSCT the percentage of NK (CD3-CD16+CD56+) was normalized. At 1 year after HSCT reduction of na\u00efve CD4 T cell we observed. Discussion: At 1 year after HSCT the immunological reconstitution is not still complete. The time and the extent of immune reconstitution depend on several factors. It is very important to continue the immune surveillance after HSTC and to evaluate other immunological parameters (i.e. thymic output) for to prevent infectious complications and elaborate an appropriate therapeutic strategy.",

Little is known about possible infl uences of antifungal drugs on human T cell function. We investigated the effects of the antimycotics fl uconazole, amphotericin B, caspofungin, voriconazole, and posaconazole on the proliferation and functional activity of anti-leukemia and anti-tumor CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones in vitro. Five different CTL clones (anti-acute myeloid leukemia CTL 1C6; antimelanoma CTL IVSB and 14/35, anti-renal cell carcinoma CTL BC-I and BC-V) were weekly stimulated with leukemia blasts or tumor cells in the presence of drugs titrated between 0.1-100\u00b5g/mL. We found that the in vitro proliferation of CTL clones was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner at amphotericin B and posaconazole concentrations of 0.25\u00b5g/mL and 3\u00b5g/ mL, respectively, or higher. Doses of 10-25\u00b5g/mL amphotericin B and 10-30\u00b5g/mL posaconazole were even able to completely prevent CTL growth. Both drugs also changed the cell morphology into a less blast shape type. In contrast, caspofungin, fl uconazole, and voriconazole did not induce growth inhibition in the analyzed dose range. To determine the effect of antifungal drugs on CTL function, 51Cr release and IFNg ELISPOT assays were performed in the presence of drugs following precultivation of CTL in drug-containing medium for 11 days. We observed that high concentrations of amphotericin B (\u226525\u00b5g/ mL) and posaconazole (\u226510\u00b5g/mL) strongly impaired target cell lysis as well as IFNg spot production by CTL. In assays using previously untreated CTL clones as effectors, only posaconazole at concentrations >10\u00b5g/mL reduced CTL function. This effect was most pronounced in the ELISPOT compared to the 51Cr release assay, presumably due to the longer incubation period (20h vs. 4-5h). Again, impairment of functionality was not seen if CTL clones were cultured in medium containing caspofungin, fl uconazole, or voriconazole, respectively. We conclude from these data that posaconazole and amphotericin B at high concentrations impair proliferation and functional activity of anti-leukemia and anti-tumor CTL clones in vitro. Our results may have important implications for T-cell mediated immunosurveillance of tumors and leukemias in vivo, particularly if peak levels of antifungal agents exceed the concentrations defi ned in this study.",

M\u00fcller Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen, DK) Objective: In humans ten different Toll like receptors (TLR1-10) mediate the activation of innate effector cells by molecules of microbial origin. A number of polymorphisms have been described in the genes encoding these receptors, and previous studies indicate that SNPs within TLR coding genes may be associated with the course of infl ammatory disorders. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the signifi cance of SNPs within TLR1-10 for adverse outcomes in allogeneic SCT. Patients and methods: Thirty-four SNPs within the genes encoding TLR 1-10 were determined by a SSP-PCR system in genomic DNA from donors and recipient pairs of transplants with either matched sibling donors or matched unrelated donors (MUD). The indication for SCT included ALL (n=67), CML (n=55), AML (n=75), MDS (n=19) and other leukaemias (n=10). Outcome in terms of grade 2-4 acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) as well time to relapse, overall survival, disease free survival and treatment related mortality were recorded. Significance was tested by chi-square test for aGvHD; survival data were analysed using a Cox model. Results: In transplants with sibling donors recipient genotype of TLR2 (rs1898830) was associated with overall survival (p=0.0100; HR=0.34, 95% CI: 0.15-0.79 for A/A vs. G/G; HR=0.25, 95% CI: 0.10-0.66, A/G vs. G/G) and treatment related mortality (p=0.0096; HR=0.22, 95% CI: 0.07-0.68, A/A vs. A/G; HR=0.18, 95% CI: 0.05-0.66, A/G vs. G/G). Recipient type of TLR5(rs5744168) was associated with aGvHD (p=0.015; OR=2.63, 95% CI: 1.21-5.73, C/C vs. C/T). In MUD transplants donor type of TRL2 (rs1898830) was related to aGvHD (p=0.0279; OR=1.81, 95% CI:0.96-3.43, A/A vs A/G; OR=0.98, 95% CI:0.40-2.38, G/G vs A/G). Conclusion: The presented data suggest that SNPs within genes of several TLR receptors may be associated with adverse outcome in allogeic SCT.

Alizadeh, U. Hedstrom Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences (Al Ain, AE) Objective: Antifungal (AF) therapy given to all pts with febrile neutropenia (FN) is costly and toxic. Beta-D-glucan assay is fungal-non-specifi c; galactomannan is useful only for aspergillosis. This study focused on serial assay of mannan (M) and mannanantibodies (MA) to diagnose invasive candidiasis (IC) in pts with FN, hence to aid selection of pts for AF. Previous experience with this assay has been limited to non-neutropenic pts, based on retrospective infrequent sampling. Methods: 100 patients with acute leukemia undergoing chemotherapy complicated by FN, given liposomal amphotericin B, were studied prospectively with clinical, microbiological (blood culture), and radiological (CT scans chest, liver, spleen, sinuses) evaluations for the development of IC, based on revised EORTC/MSG diagnostic criteria. M + MA were measured daily using Platelia Candida-specifi c antigen/antibody ELISA kits (Bio-Rad). Diagnostic cut-offs were determined using ROC curves. Results: 12 of 86 (14%) eligible pts had IC [C. albicans candidemia (1), C. tropicalis candidemia (4), hepatosplenic candidiasis (7)], 24 had invasive mold, 50 persistent FN. These last 2 groups served as the comparison group. Cut-offs were 0.25ng/ml and 2.5AU/ml for M and MA, lower than manufacturer's recommendations. All pts with IC developed \u2265 1 +ve diagnostic M or MA during persistent FN (FIG1).Optimal overall performance occurred when 2 consecutive positive tests for both M and MA were used. Sensitivity, specifi city, PPV and NPV [95% CI] A positive correlation (r=0.28, p=0.01) was seen with previously determined beta-D-glucan (BDG) concentrations in these pts. The fi rst +ve M test occurred at a mean, bs.d. of 8.8, b8.5 (2 to 23) days prior to clinical/mycological diagnosis of IC. High MA concentrations were delayed until leucopenia resolved. The candidal colonisation index (CCI) was \u22650.5 in 60% of the comparison group. Conclusions: Using institution-derived cut off values, early serial determination of combined M+MA is useful to diagnose IC in FN pts. Low PPV may refl ect low prevalence of IC, whilst the high NPV confi dently excludes IC. Negative M+MA tests in the presence of +ve BDG test indicates IC rather than mold. Specifi city may be low as a result of subclinical candida infection in the comparator group (high CCI). This assay could be used as part of a broad fungal diagnostic strategy aimed at tailoring AF (FIG2). Introduction: Infections are major obstacles to successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) worldwide. Transplant programs in developing countries have the additional challenge of management of neglected tropical diseases (NTD). About one billion people are affected by one or more NTD globally, which cause approximately 534,000 deaths annually. The most prevalent NTDs in Brazil are: tuberculosis, leprosy, dengue fever, leishmaniasis, malaria, Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, yellow fever (YF) and soil-transmitted helminth infections. We retrospectively reviewed the experience concerning to the management of NTDs at the HSCT program from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Amaral Carvalho, the greatest program for allogeneic transplants in Brazil. Methods: Information was obtained from both recipients (R) and donors (D). Search strategy included chart revision, pretransplant visit forms and serologic data review. Phone calls were used to get information on YF vaccination. Soil-transmitted helminth infections were not included as empiric treatment with albendazole and mebendazole is performed in all transplant candidates. Results: NTDs were not spontaneously reported in pre-transplant visit forms. Thus, only serologic information could be obtained pre-HSCT. Donor information was only obtained if a NTD was suspected after HSCT. 950 charts were reviewed from 296 autologous, 543 allogeneic and 70 URD HSCT. Forty-one patients had a second transplant. The following NTD were identifi ed in R and/or D: 2 cases of tungiasis (R), 1 visceral leishmaniasis (R), 3 pre-transplant leprosy (2 R and 1 D), 6 pre-transplant positive serology for Chagas disease (4 R, 1 D and 1 D+R), 7 tuberculosis (3 R before HSCT, 3 R after and 1 D before and respective R after HSCT), 6 dengue fever (4 R after, 1 R before HSCT, 1 D), 6 pre-transplant malaria (4 D, 2 R). Donor infection and subsequent recipient infection was seen in one case of leprosy and 1 case of tuberculosis. One patient died as a consequence of Chagas myocarditis 8 months after HSCT. Yellow fever (YF) serology was performed in 27 HSCT recipients living in endemic areas. Seven patients were susceptible to YF despite of pre-transplant vaccination in two of them. Four HSCT recipients were vaccinated against YF in 2008. Conclusions: Pre-transplant investigation of NTD is necessary to better estimate the risk of post transplant reactivation. Pre-emptive strategies should be prospectively investigated in transplant candidates at risk.",

Storek University of Calgary (Calgary, CA) Background: Herpes viruses cause morbidity and mortality of hematotoeitic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Three common herpesviruses: cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) belong to three subfamilies -alpha, beta and gamma respectively. Since the three subfamilies differ in their biological properties, we hypothesized that anti-viral T cell response (leading to the generation of degranulating, cytokine-producing or proliferating T cells) will also differ for each of the 3 viruses. Aim: To determine in healthy, chronically infected individuals whether different T cell subsets dominate the immune response to the 3 viruses. Methodology: Blood mononuclear cells from 15 healthy individuals (all seropositive for EBV and VZV, 9 seropositive for CMV) were stimulated with EBV, VZV or CMV lysate or with overlapping peptides (CMV-pp65 or EBV-LMP1+2). Cytokine (IFNg and IL-2) production and degranulation (CD107a expression) were assessed after 6-18 h using multicolor fl ow cytometry. The subsets shown in the Table have enumerated. Results: As shown in the Figure, CMV-specifi c CD4 T cells were mainly IFNg producers, both alone and in combination with IL2. EBV-specifi c CD4 T cells were mainly either IFNg or IL2 single cytokine producers. VZV-specifi c CD4 T cells were almost entirely double cytokine producers (IFNg and IL2). CD8 T cells stimulated with pp65 peptides or EBV lysate showed similar cytokine production as CD4 T cells (very few CD8 T cells were detected using stimulation with VZV lysate or CMV lysate). Degranulating pp65-specifi c CD8 T cells frequently produced IFNg whereas degranulating LMP1/2-specifi c CD8 T cells did not. Absolute count of IFNg or IL2-producing (single and double cytokine producers combined) EBV-specifi c CD4 T cells was six fold higher than that of VZV-specifi c CD4 T cells and two fold higher than that of CMV-specifi c CD4 T cells. Absolute count of IFNg or IL2-producing or degranulating pp65-specifi c CD8 T cells was ~2 fold higher than that of LMP1/2-specifi c CD8 T cells.",

Plantinga, B. Ferwerda, P. Donnelly, M.G. Netea, N.M.A. Blijlevens Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center (Nijmegen, NL) Background: Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is accompanied by a high incidence of invasive fungal disease (IFD) including those due to Candida species. There is increased interest in the molecular determinants of susceptibility to such infections. A new polymorphism, Tyr238Stop has been characterised in Dectin-1, a C-type lectin that recognises the 1,3-beta-glucan of fungi. Aim: Study the association of the Dectin-1 Tyr238Stop polymorphism with the occurrence of Candida colonization and disease in HSCT recipients. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis in a 142 Dutch patients admitted for a sibling donor allogeneic T celldepleted HSCT following myeloablative conditioning. Patients only received fl uconazole (200 mg daily) if they were colonised with Candida spp. (except C. glabrata and C. krusei) defi ned as the same yeast being present in both mouthwash and faecal samples obtained on the same day, or from the same site on two consecutive occasions. Only those with data on colonisation and those not receiving prophylaxis with itra-, vori-or posaconazole before day 0 were included in the analysis of Candida colonization. In the analysis of candidaemia patients not receiving anti-mould prophylaxis were included in the analysis. Genotyping for the presence of the Tyr238Stop mutation in the Dectin-1 gene was performed by employing a TaqMan RT-PCR SNP assay. In addition functional studies were performed with monocytes homozygous for the polymorphism, obtained from three individuals outside this cohort. Results: The allele frequency the Tyr238Stop polymorphism in the Dectin-1 gene was 6.6% in our cohort and these patients were more commonly colonized with Candida spp. on admission and on the day of HSCT, and therefore more often received fl uconazole (Table 1 ). In contrast, the incidence of candidaemia up to day 21 was not signifi cantly infl uenced by this Dectin-1 polymorphism (Table 1 ), but the use of fl uconazole was most likely a confounding factor. In vitro functional studies with monocytes homozygous for the polymorphism demonstrated ''loss of function'' occurring with this mutation resulting in impaired cytokine responses and Candida binding by innate immune cells. Conclusion: These data suggest Dectin-1 plays a role in the host defences against Candida infection and screening for the Tyr238Stop polymorphism might help select those high-risk patients who most likely to profi t from antifungal prophylaxis.",

Garnett (1) Background: Despite current treatments, cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains an important pathogen in allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients. Both the direct and indirect effects of CMV can lead to poor patient outcomes. Given the lack of robust epidemiological data on the natural history of CMV in SCT, the objective of this work was to develop a model which depicts this natural history. Methods: An ordinary differential equation model describing the fl ows between risk, infection and disease categories in an adult population undergoing allogeneic SCT was developed. Model parameters were derived from the literature as well as cohort data from two transplant centres. The model can be solved numerically to predict the expected rates of disease and death in a cohort with specifi c characteristics. Results: The model divides the population of SCT recipients into three categories according to serotype: recipient positive(R+), recipient negative but donor positive(R-/D+) and recipient negative and donor negative(R-/D-) with their associated risks of CMV viremia. In addition, the population is stratifi ed by risk: -very high risk (haplotypic donors or with cord blood source cells); high risk (unrelated donors) and moderate risk (related donors). The nine resulting categories determine the parameters of the model. For all of the categories, the fl ows through infection and disease are illustrated. A fraction of CMV disease is not preceded by viremia, but in a majority of cases, viremia provides an opportunity for screening and pre-emptive treatment. Three signifi cant CMV diseases are included, pneumonia, gastrointestinal disease and retinitis, along with secondary infections, which can result from other causes associated with neutropenia or be can result directly from CMV. The model allows calculation of the number of days over which treatment is received, the duration spent with different diseases and the pattern of mortality associated with different causes since transplantation. Conclusions: This model represents the pathways by which CMV causes disease in allogeneic SCT recipients. The model can also be used to look at future trends, such as the increasingly older transplant patient population and the projected increases in the use of cord blood cells in SCT. Finally, when available, estimates of the effi cacy of new and existing treatments can be incorporated into the model, allowing alternative management strategies to be compared.",

In multivariate analysis risk factors for developing IA were steroid therapy for moderate-to-severe GVHD (Hazard Ratio [HR] 2.9, P= 0.03), occurrence of a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) by a respiratory virus [RV] (HR 4.3, P<0.01) and CMV disease (HR 2.8, P = 0.03). Variables which decreased survival after AlloRIC were advanced disease phase (HR 1.9, P = 0.02), steroid therapy for moderate-to-severe GVHD (HR 2.2, P<0.01), not developing chronic GVHD (HR 4.3, P<0.01), occurrence of LRTI by a RV (HR 3.4, P<0.01) and CMV disease (HR 2, P = 0.01), while occurrence of IA had no impact on survival (P=0.5). Our results show that IA is a common infectious complication after an AlloRIC, which occurs late post-transplant and may not have a strong impact on survival. An important observation is the possible role of LRTI by conventional RVs as risk factors for IA. A.F. Widmer, R. Frei, M. Stern, D. Heim, C. Arber, M. Battegay, U. Fl\u00fcckiger, A. Gratwohl University Hospital Basel (Basel, CH) Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in immunocompromised patients are associated with high morbidity and mortality. We report an outbreak with an epidemic multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MRPA) clone in a 12-bed haematology unit after a new centralized water treatment system with nanofi ltration and continuous fl ow was installed. Methods: An epidemiological investigation was begun after identifi cation of a cluster of P. aeruginosa including extensive environmental cultures and a case control study. Samples of water from all faucets, showers and fi lters were taken at regular intervals. Screening of patients included rectal and perineal swabs, supplemented with environmental cultures from water and surfaces and cultures from hands of health care workers (HCWs). Results: A total of 74 episodes of P. aeruginosa colonization or infection occurred between Jan 1, 1999 and Dec, 2004. 24 of the episodes were caused by an epidemic clonal strain. 7 patients had strong evidence for bloodstream infections (BSIs) with P.aeruginosa, 2 of them died. The epidemic strain was identifi ed from the nanofi ltered water and later on, in multiple samples from toilet drains. MRPA was not recovered from HCWs, surfaces or food items. Contaminated drinking water was considered as the probable source. However, molecular typing with pulsed-fi eld electrophoresis demonstrated a closer match with strains isolated from toilet drains than from freshwater. Spillage of Pseudomonas contaminated toilet drain water was the most likely route of transmission, possibly during fl using the toilet. Continuous high-dose chlorination resulted in decontamination of the toilets, but was poorly tolerated. After introduction of continuous bromide disinfection of the toiled drains, water cultures were continuously negative and the rate of MRPA infections signifi cantly declined to < 0.1 episodes/1000 patient days. Routine surveillance cultures failed to isolate the epidemic strain with a follow up of 4 years. Conclusions: MRPA is capable of persistently contaminating toilet drains, thus colonizing and infecting immunocompromised patients. Nanofi ltration of drinking water and continuous disinfection of toilet drains in addition to active surveillance, contact isolation of infected patients contained the epidemic. Untreated drinking water is an important source for P. aeruginosa infections in the severely immunocompromised patient.",

Lankester, C.M. Jol-van der Zijde, P. Hissinkmuller, A.C.T.M. Vossen, L.M. Ball Leiden Univ Medical Center (Leiden, NL) Background/introduction: Varicella Zoster virus (VZV) belongs to the herpes family and reactivation is seen in immune compromised hosts. VZV reactivation, especially when presenting early after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), may cause signifi cant morbidity. In recent years, (re-) induction treatment of acute leukemia (AL) has been intensifi ed including immunosuppressive agents eg. fl udarabine. Based on our initial clinical observations of early VZV reactivation in children undergoing HSCT in our unit, we undertook a retrospective study to determine the frequency and the possible factors associated with the frequency and timing of VZV reactivation. Patients and Methods: Between 2002 and 2008, all children undergoing a fi rst HSCT (n=166) in our unit were included. HSCT indications included malignant (63%) and nonmalignant diseases (37%). Antiviral prophylaxis (incl. Acyclovir) was not routinely administered to our patients. VZV diagnosis was based on clinical features supported by Q-PCR and viral culture. Results: Within the cohort of 166 patients, 40 (24%) patients developed VZV reactivation during the fi rst year after transplantation. VZV reactivation occurred more often within the subgroup of AL patients compared to the remainder of patients (n=26/67, i.e. 39% vs. n=14/99, i.e. 15%, p<0.01 respectively). In children greater then 4 yrs VZV occurred more often in the AL group compared to all others (40% vs 19%, respectively). Donor type, use of serotherapy or conditioning regimen did not infl uence VZV occurence. VZV reactivation was signifi cantly increased in AL patients who had previously received fl udarabine compared to the remainder of the SCT patients (n=18/41, i.e. 44% vs. n=22/125, i.e. 18%, p< 0.01). In addition, VZV reactivation presented earlier after transplantation in patients that had received fl udarabine (median day + 36 vs day + 72). Notably, children with myelodysplastic syndrome, not previously treated with fl udarabine, and although having the same median age as the AL patients (11.2 and 11.5 yrs, respectively) VZV reactivation was found in only 21% of the patients.",

Dominietto, A.M. Raiola, V. Pinto, M. Soracco, F. Gualandi, V. Del Bono, T. Lamparelli, M.T. Van Lint, C. Viscoli, A. Bacigalupo, F. Frassoni Ospedale San Martino (Genoa, IT) Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation have an higher incidence after allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) using alternative sources such as cord blood (CB) or unrelated (URD)/related mismatched (relmm) donors. This is due to several factors including the use of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and the donor/recipient HLA mismatch. Routine monitoring and pre-emptive therapy have limited the clinical impact of CMV and EBV on outcomes. However, duration of monitoring and the need of pre-emptive therapy might differ depending on the type of donor source. Aims: To evaluate retrospectively the frequency and duration of CMV and EBV reactivation and its relevance on outcomes after ASCT from 1) CB and 2) URD/rel-mm donors. Post-ASCT variables were compared by time-dependent analyses and cumulative incidences (CI) were calculated. Methods: Since Jan 06 through Sept 08, 119 patients were analysed (CB=58; URD/rel-mm=61), the majority having received a myeloablative conditioning (72%). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CSA-based regimens and ATG (Thymoglobulin) for 2 days (3.0 to 3.75mg/kg dd-3, -2). All pts received CMV prophylaxis with Foscarnet, as previously reported and EBV prophylaxis with Rituximab 200mg total dose on day +5. EBV viremia was defi ned as more than 1000 copies of EBV-DNA/ml of whole blood. Results: The median FU was 165 (3-732) and 245 (1-942) days for the CB and URD/rel-mm group, respectively (p=NS). Gender, median age, disease phase, type of conditioning were not different between the 2 groups, whereas GVHD prophylaxis was (p=0.001). Acute GVHD I-IV was less frequent in the CB group (54 vs 82% p=0.001), but no difference in chronic GVHD (p=0.87). TRM and OS did not differ between the 2 groups. The CI of CMV reactivation was higher in the CB group (82 vs 57% p=0.025) and there was a trend for a longer duration (99 vs 35 days p=0.09). EBV reactivation (CI at 1 year) was more frequent in the URD/rel-mm group (69 vs 38 p<0.001) and the number of pts with EBV viremia was higher (23 vs 10% p=0.09 trend) as well. Conclusions: In our series, CMV and EBV reactivation are infl uenced by the type of source. CMV reactivation is higher after CB transplantation and seems to last longer, requiring extra-treatment for control. Conversely, EBV reactivation has a greater impact on URD/rel-mm despite both groups had day+5 Rituximab prophylaxis. These observation may lead to a better defi nition of recommendations for CMV and EBV management.",

Yamashita, T. Kondo, T. Ishikawa, S. Ichiyama, T. Uchiyama Kyoto University (Kyoto, JP) Widespread emergence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms in hematology-oncology units has raised the necessity to re-evaluate routine bacterial prophylaxis in cytotoxic chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Here, we retrospectively analyzed the impact of restricting the use of bacterial prophylaxis. We evaluated 126 consecutive adult patients (pts) with hematologic malignancies who had undergone myeloablative allogeneic marrow or peripheral blood SCTs between January 2000 and September 2008 at our institution. Until August 2004, patients received oral fl uoroquinolones (FQs) as bacterial prophylaxis (prophylaxis group). In pts who could not ingest oral drugs, oral FQs were temporarily substituted with intravenous administration of antipseudomonal beta-lactams. Since September 2004, any bacterial prophylaxis including oral FQs was discontinued (non-prophylaxis group). In both groups, intravenous antibiotics were promptly administered to treat episodes of febrile neutropenia or suspected bacterial infections. We estimated the cumulative incidence of microbiologically documented bacterial infection (DBI) within 30 days after SCT and early mortality within 100 days in each group, and compared the results of non-prophylaxis group with those of prophylaxis group using a competing risk regression analysis. Of the126 pts included in the analysis (median age, 42 years; range, 17-61 years), 61 received stem cell grafts from related donors, while 65 from unrelated donors. Background patient characteristics did not signifi cantly differ between the prophylaxis arm (87 pts) and non-prophylaxis arm (39 pts). The median day of onset of DBI after SCT was 5.5 (range, 2-11) in the prophylaxis group and 7 (range, in the non-prophylaxis group (P = 0.14). The cumulative incidence of DBI was much higher in the nonprophylaxis group than in the prophylaxis group (0.18 [95% confi dence interval, 0.08-0.31] vs. 0.07 [0.03-0.12]), with marginal signifi cance in univariate analysis (P = 0.06). However, early mortality did not signifi cantly differ. Further, organ failure and septic shock due to bacterial infection were not observed, except in two pts in the prophylaxis group who died because of infection with multi-drug resistant organisms. Bacterial prophylaxis can be restricted without signifi cant adverse infl uence on the early mortality after allo-SCT, if appropriate antibiotic treatment is immediately initiated in the case of febrile neutropenia.",

Petrini University of Pisa (Pisa, IT) Background: It is common experience that retreating patients too early after a course of intensive chemotherapy predispose to opportunistic infections despite apparently normal lymphocyte levels. The kinetics of reactivations of endogenous viruses that cause no obvious disease (and hence need no treatment) can serve as a surrogate marker to better understand when a patient has recovered from this functional immune defi ciency. Methods: We used real-time polymerase chain reaction to monitor the kinetics of serum Torquetenovirus (TTV) viremia in 44 hematological patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy supported by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, followed for up to 3 years. Results: Independently from underlying haematological disease or chemotherapy regimen, TTV viremia fl uctuations parallel those of other known immunophenotypic markers of functional immune defi ciency. Furthermore, we suggest here that the maximal increase in plasma TTV level reached after a chemotherapy course determines the time required before returning to basal TTV levels, allowing prediction of the appropriate time gap before delivery of the next chemotherapy course. Conclusions: We suggest here that monitoring of TTV viremia represent a unique opportunity to follow functional immune reconstitution.",

Bruno University of Turin (Turin, IT) Hepatitis B virus (HBV) positive patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and recipients of allo-SCT from HBV positive donors are at risk of hepatitis reactivation and fatal liver failure. In this setting, the impact of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and the role of prophylaxis with lamivudine (LAM) are still unclear. Ninety-nine patients undergoing allo-SCT between 1999 and 2007 with at least 3 months of follow-up (median 32 months, range 4-97) entered the study. Patients, median age of 51 years (20-67), were transplanted for multiple myeloma (54), acute myeloid leukemia (16), chronic lymphatic leukemia (11), lymphoma (10), chronic myeloproliferative disease (7) and aplastic anemia (1) . The conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 12 patients and reduced intensity in 87; 2 patients received 2 allo-SCT from the same donor for disease progression. Stem cell source was peripheral blood in 96 patients and bone marrow in 3. Seventy-six patients had a HLA-matched sibling donor and 23 an unrelated donor. Recipients negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis B core antigen antibodies (antiHBc), with HBsAgnegative donors, were not considered at risk of HBV reactivation (72). None of them experienced HBV related hepatitis during follow-up. The other 27 patients were considered at risk. All HBsAg-negative recipients from HBsAg-positive donors (3) and HBsAg-positive recipients from negative donors (2) were treated with LAM. None of them developed hepatitis B after a median follow-up of 21 months (13-30).Twenty-two patients were antiHBc-positive. Twelve/22 patients were not treated with LAM and 10 received prophylactic LAM for a median time of 19 months (range 4-36). Of these, one discontinued LAM after 8 months due to intolerance. Hepatitis developed in 3 untreated patients and in none of the patients on prophylaxis. All patients with hepatitis received a RIC allo-SCT. In conclusions, we observed: 1) a null risk of hepatitis B in patients serologically negative for HBV, transplanted with HBsAg-negative donors; 2) the effi cacy of LAM in controlling HBV replication and hepatitis B reactivation in both HBsAgpositive recipients from negative donors and in HBsAg-positive donors used in negative recipients; 3) the effi cacy of prophylactic LAM in HBsAg-negative and antiHBc-positive recipients in preventing HBV related hepatitis; 4) the lack of a protective effect of RIC for patients at risk of HBV reactivation.",

S\u00e1nchez-Ortega (1) Posaconazole (POSA) is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and increases exposure to its substrates, such as Cyclosporine A (CSA). Prescribing information for POSA recommends a reduction of CSA dose at initiation of POSA therapy (www. noxafi l.com). CSA & POSA drug interaction has not been formally studied in allogeneic HSCT (alloHSCT) yet. Here, we present a pharmacokinetic analysis in 41 alloHSCT recipients on CSA for GVHD prophylaxis who initiated POSA (200mg/8h PO) for primary antifungal prophylaxis: 25 men; median age 51, 18-67; 21 AML-MDS, 11 lymphoma, 3 ALL, 3 Myeloma, 3 others; 25 related, 16 unrelated donors; 12 myeloablative, 29 reduced-intensity conditioning. For this study, CSA dose was not reduced at initiation of POSA. Rather, CSA levels were monitored (x2-3/week) and the dose adjusted as required to keep levels within range or if CSA-toxicity occurred. Kinetics of CSA plasma levels, dose-adjustment and ratio of levels to dose were studied. Results are summarised in the table for baseline (pre-POSA) and days 7, 14 and 30 of combined treatment. They show that POSA increases CSA levels in alloHSCT recipients (p=.011), with a signifi cant effect already present within the fi rst week of treatment (225.8 pre-POSA vs 293.1 day 7 POSA; p=.028). Hence, POSA induces a 50% overall reduction in CSA dose (p<.001). This dose reduction however is not required during the fi rst week of combined treatment (p=.857), and normally occurs after day 7 (p=.082), and most frequently after day 14 (p<.001). Ratio of CSA levels to dose show a steady increase with time (p<.001). Combined treatment with CSA & POSA was safe. Only 7 patients had CSA-attributed toxicities: 4 mild increases in creatinine, 1 hypertension, 1 microangiopathy, 1 tremor. Two patients stopped POSA for abnormal liver function tests that resolved upon discontinuation. Our results confi rm that POSA treatment increases CSA therapeutic levels in alloHSCT recipients. Interestingly, this effect is evident from the fi rst few days of POSA treatment, but does not require CSA dose-reduction for 1 to 2 weeks. The initial recommendation to reduce the dose of CSA upfront should be reviewed, as it may cause subtherapeutic CSA levels in some patients that would be posed at a higher risk of GVHD. Our recommendation would be for close monitoring of CSA plasma levels and CSA dosereduction not upfront but according to plasma levels or toxicity. In this study, such a strategy has shown to be safe to manage these patients.",

Stadler, H. Diedrich, A. Ganser, E.M. Weissinger Hannover Medical School (Hannover, DE) One of the major problems after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are infectious complications in aplasia or during immunosuppression post HSCT. Reactivation of latent viruses, like cytomegalovirus (CMV), are major causes of morbidity and mortality. Virus-specifi c T-cells control the infection/reactivation of CMV, but during the recovery of the immune system of the patients these may be scarce. Recently, the screening for virus-epitopebinding CD8+ T-cells using MHC-I-peptide-complexes (tetramers) was established. We used this technique to gain insight in the immune-reconstitution of CMV-reactive T-cells. We monitored all patients undergoing HSCT in our department, matching at least one of 6 commercially available tetramers for common HLA-types. Samples were taken prior to HSCT, on days +50, +80, +100, +180 and +365 or weekly in case of CMV reactivation and/or increased immunosuppressive therapy. Of 134 patients 114 could be included in the screening. The median age was 54.5 years (range: 18 to 70). Sixty-seven patients had AML (de novo: n=42; secondary AML n=25). Fiftysix were transplanted from matched unrelated (MUD; 49.1%), 35 from matched related donors (MRD; 30.7%), and 23 patients received HSCT from mismatched donors (MMUD: n=19; MMRD: n=4). The CMV-serostatus for recipients (R) and donors (D) was: R+/D+ in 55, R+/D-in 14, R-/D+ in 10 and R-/D-in 35 recipient/donor pairs. Thirty-seven patients (32.5%) reactivated CMV at least once within a median of +38 days (range: day +11 to +93), 16 patients reactivated CMV more than once. In the R+/D+ group tetramer binding cells were detected in all patients yielding to protection against CMV-reactivation in the majority of recipients. In the R+/D-group recurrent reactivation occurred more frequently, 5 of 7 patients transplanted from MUD and 4 of 6 transplanted with MMUD reactivated CMV at least once, 4 and 3, respectively, reactivated CMV more than once. In the R-/D+ group no reactivation occurred. In order to identify risk factors besides the number of CMVbinding T-cells, we analysed all patients receiving HSCT in our centre in the last 10 years (n=603) retrospectively. Next to CMV-serostatus, HLA-matching infl uenced the risk of recurrent CMV-reactivation signifi cantly. Therefore chimerism analyses of CMV-binding T-cells are performed. Our results indicate that tetramer binding T-cells can be used as an additional parameter to identify patients at risk for recurrent CMV-reactivations.",

            "text": "Objectives: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of serious respiratory infections (mostly bronchiolitis and pneumonia) in pediatric and adult stem cell transplant recipients. We aimed to determine the frequency, risk factors, and outcome of RSV infection in the group of allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients. Methods and Results: Data were collected retrospectively from a total of 275 allo-HSCT recipients and identifi ed 33 patients (12%, 27 adults and 6 children) with laboratory confi rmed RSV infection; 18 had upper tract and 15 lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). The duration of viral shedding was long (20 days; 7-83). 28 patients received ribavirin (6 iv, 11 oral, 9 both, 1 oral + aerosolized, and 1 received all three forms). The median duration of therapy was 22.5 days (7-54). Four (1.5% of the entire cohort, 12% of infected patients; 27% of patients with LRTI) patients died from RSV (attributable mortality) while 4 patients died from other infections 38 days -5 months after diagnosis of RSV. Long-term respiratory function was assessed in surviving patients. No patient developed severe respiratory dysfunction after RSV. Mild respiratory dysfunction was common after RSV infection but lack of pre-infection information makes interpretation diffi cult. Conclusions: RSV infection results in a low overall attributable mortality after allo-HSCT but LRTI infection is associated with a signifi cant risk for death. Future studies are required to identify prognostic factors for developing LRTI, and to optimize the therapy of RSV. Objectives: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the most frequent pathogens after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Recipients of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) experience less transplantation-related toxicity and earlier recovery of CMV-specifi c immunity. However, it is unknown if these transplants are associated with reduced risk of posttransplantation infections. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze incidence, timing, and risk factors for CMV after allo-HSCT with RIC. Patients and methods: 168 consecutive patients receiving RIC allo-HSCT between June 2000 and May 2008 were included. Five patients received two transplants due to rejection or relapse. The median age was 53.0 ys (2.7-69.0) . 78 transplants were from HLA-identical siblings and 95 from unrelated or mismatched family donors. 140 grafts were PBSC, 24 bone marrow, and 9 were cord blood. CMV-serologic status in donor/recipient pairs was as follows: 15 D-/ R-, 15 D+/R-, 52 D-/R+, and 91 were D+/R+. Patients were monitored weekly by a quantitative real-time PCR for CMV DNA and preemptive therapy was given at pre-specifi ed viral loads. Risk factors for CMV DNA positivity, repeated CMV replication episodes, and CMV disease were analysed by multivariate logistic regression. Results: CMV DNA was detected after 113/173 (65.3%) HSCT. The only signifi cant risk factor for CMV DNA detection was the recipient serological status. With the D-/R-cases excluded, the rate of CMV DNA detection was 70.8%. More than one CMV episode was observed after 40 (23%) HSCT. With the D-/Rcases excluded, a CMV seropositive donor reduced the risk for repeated CMV episodes (OR 0.45; p=.02 ). Ten cases of CMV disease were documented of which 2 were fatal. No case occurred in D-/R-patients. The CMV disease rate was 6.3%. Risk factors for CMV disease were either 1st episode log10 initial viral load (OR 2.5; p=.006) or peak viral load (OR 2.3; p=.04) . Non-signifi cant factors were acute GVHD grades II-IV, CMV serological status of donor or recipient, repeated CMV episodes, donor type, stem cell source. Conclusions: In this cohort of RIC allo-HSCT patients, CMV infections were observed in 65% of all cases. The risk for CMV disease was similar to what was previously reported in myeloablative HSCT (6.3 vs. 5.2%). Higher initial and peak viral loads during the fi rst episode of CMV replication are risk factors for development of CMV disease.",

Zanis-Neto HC-UFPR (Curitiba, BR) Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes signifi cant mortality in pts submitted to SCT. Previous data reported a frequency of 3,5% of RSV infection in allogenic SCT. Despite the use of ribavirin aerosol (RA), mortality rates is still between 30 and 40% in many centers. Objectives: Analyse the clinical course and outcome of 59 pts who developed RSV infections after SCT in a single institution (Federal University of Parana -Curitiba-Brazil). Methods: In retrospective analysis, diagnosis of a RSV infection was confi rmed in 59 pts submitted to hsct. All pts had symptoms of upper or lower tract respiratory infection. From 1991 From -2004 pts indirect immunofl uorescence method (IFI). rom 2004 -2008 : 8 pts qualitative PCR. RSV infection was defi ned as a laboratory identifi cation of the virus in the nasopharyngeal aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage or coryza. RA was administrated during 12 hours, in the dose of 5g diluted in 200ml of distillated water, for 5 days. Male: 37, Female: 22. Median age of patients was 19,9 years (2,8 -54,02) . Donor: 48 related, not related 11. Detection method: IFI -51, PCR-8. 15 patients presented upper respiratory tract (URT) infection, 44 patients presented lower respiratory tract (LRT). Diagnoses: SAA-17, CML-14, AML-5, ALL-3, MDS-5, others-5. SPSS program was used for statistical analysis. OS was estimated with the use of Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed by Cox method. Results: Median time after transplantation for the diagnosis of RSV infection was 17 days (1 -435) . In the group of patients who received RA (n=50), 40 had URT infection and 10 had LRT. In patients who did not receive RA, 3 had URT infection and 6 had LRT. 20 patients died (33,8%), and the main cause of death in 13 pts was RSV infection (all this pts have need mecanic ventilation). 9 patients died before the use of RA as standard treatment for RSV (before 1992). The overall survival (OS) of pts treated with RA was 66%. In the univariate analysis: type of engraftment, method of identifi cation of RSV, time for diagnosis, type of donor, stem cell source or baseline disease did not interfere in the OS. However, OS was inferior in patients who had LRT infection (37,5%) compared with those who had URT infection (67,5%), p=0,007. In the multivariate analysis, only the use of RA affect OS (p=0,001). Conclusions: In this group of pts RSV infection resulted in an overall mortality of 34%. All pts who were not treated with RA died.",

Methods: Retrospective analysis of documentation and laboratory results of patients after allogeneic transplantation treated with voriconazole from August 2005 to November 2008 was performed. Steady-state plasma Voriconazole levels were obtained using a high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Results: 392 plasma samples from 51 patients(pts.) were analyzed; 1-29 samples per patient. Voriconazole was administered in 59% as prophylaxis, in 25% as an empirical antifungal treatment and in 16% as a preemptive treatment of invasive fungal infection. In 48 pts. (94%) voriconazole was administrated orally, only in 3 patients intravenously and the total daily dose varied from 200 to 800 mg. The mean trough voriconazole plasma concentration after the standard daily dose 400 mg orally was 1,44 \u00b5/ml (0,2-8,89 \u00b5g/ml). In 8% (23) of plasma samples from 20 (40%) patients the voriconazole plasma concentration was undetectable(<0,2 \u00b5g/ml). In 42,3% (267) of samples from 31 (63%) patients after 400 mg/day the plasma concentration was under 1 ug/ml = below the level associated with a better response to therapy and better prognosis of invasive aspergillosis. The increase in daily voriconazole dose from 400 to 600 mg in 11 patients led to elevation of voriconazole trough plasma level above 1,0 \u00b5g/ml in 4 cases and above 0,5 \u00b5g/ml in 3 cases. On 4 cases the concentration didi not changed or decreased. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that high percentage of patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation did not achieved suffi cient voriconazole plasma concentration. Monitoring of plasma levels enables an individual dosage adjustment and lead to improving response to antifungal treatment in this group of very high risk patients.",

Kassa, J. Sink\u00f3, K. K\u00e1llay, A. Kert\u00e9sz, M. Konkoly-Thege, G. Kriv\u00e1n St. Istv\u00e1n and St. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Hospital (Budapest, HU) Introduction: Growing prevalence of multiresistant bacteria (MRB) in stem cell transplant patients has gained special importance due to the subsequent increase in mortality rate and limited options to treat infections caused by these strains. Patients and methods: A two years' retrospective epidemiological survey was performed among patients undergoing stem cell transplantation at our center between March 1, 2005 and February 28, 2007 . Aim of our study was to determine the rate of colonization and infections, caused by MRB. At the same time to investigate outcomes and the potential role of surveillance cultures in predicting serious infections. During the observation period 144 hematopoetic stem cell transplantations (autologous: 83, allogeneic: 61) were performed in 140 patients (males: 79, females: 61; children: 56, adults: 84) . The age of patients averaged 26 years (from 2 months to 68 years). Respiratory tract, fecal and urine surveillance cultures were taken once weekly. In case of fever and/or symptoms of an infection appropriate clinical sampling was performed. Results: From 80 pts. with positive surveillance cultures (231 isolates) 37 pts were colonized by MRB (115 isolates). Most frequently multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (57,4%), extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producing Gramnegative bacteria (22,6%) and multiresistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (13,9%) were isolated. In 31 pts. we have found 78 positive clinical cultures. These samples were taken from blood (78,6%), wound (9,5%), bronchoalveolar lavage (7,2%) as well as other sites (4,7%). MRB grew from 42 samples, dominated by P. aeruginosa (83,3%). MRB caused infection in 12 patients. From the 9 individuals with bloodstream infections 7 died. High mortality was primarily attributable to P. aeruginosa. Primary immunodefi ciency, allogeneic stem cell transplantation and CMV reactivation were the main risk factors for MRB colonizations and infections. While positive predictive value of surveillance cultures was poor (21,6%), negative predictive value seemed to be fair (96,1%). Conclusions: The majority of patients with negative surveillance cultures for MRB do not develop multiresistant infections. In MRB-positive pts., however, the choice of empirical antibiotics should be guided by the result of surveillance cultures. G. Beutel, S. Buchholz, J. Krauter, E. Dammann, H. Diedrich, M. Stadler, P. Kirschner, A. Ganser, M. Eder Hannover Medical School (Hannover, DE) Background: Clostridium diffi cile (C. diff.) causes antibioticassociated colitis upon alterations in colonic microfl ora. Bacterial exotoxins bind to receptors on intestinal epithelial cells leading to infl ammation and diarrhea. New C. diff strains (ribotype 27) and fl uorquinolones often used prophylactically in allogeneic SCT have been linked to increasing C. diff. infections. Aims: The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical manifestation of C. diff. infections in patients undergoing allogeneic SCT. Methods: From 01/07 to 10/08, 126 adult patients with haematological malignancies were transplanted at Hannover Medical School. For 18 patients (AML n=8, ALL n=5, MDS n= 2, CML n=1, MPS n=1, NHL n=1), C. diff. toxin was detected in stool specimen at any time upon SCT (14.3%, median day + 52, range 0 -461 days). So far, no ribotype 27 C. diff. strain has been isolated. At time of C. diff. toxin detection, fi ve patients were under prophylactic metronidazole treatment, and two additional patients were diagnosed within a week after end of treatment. All patients were subsequently treated either with metronidazole or oral vancomycin, and C. diff. infection and toxin detection fi nally resolved in all cases. Interestingly, 12 out of 18 patients developed aGvHD including 4 patients suffering from III\u00b0 -IV\u00b0 aGvHD of the gut (22.2%). Two of these patients died due to refractory GvHD. C. diff infection was diagnosed before or at onset of GvHD in 7 patients, and after GvHD diagnosis in two patients, respectively. Three patients developed cGvHD (2 extensive, 1 limited). In 108 C. diff. negative patients (AML n=63, ALL n=9, MDS n=13, CML n=3, MPS n=13, NHL including multiple myeloma n=7) 52 developed aGvHD. Among those fi ve suffered from gut aGvHD III-IV\u00b0 (4.6%) which was signifi cantly less than in the C. diff. positive group (p=0.038). 25 evaluable patients developed cGvHD (9 extensive, 16 limited). Both groups were comparable in terms of conditioning regimen and CSA-based GvHD prophylaxis, respectively. Conclusions: Clostridium diffi cile infection can be detected in a reasonable proportion of patients undergoing allogeneic SCT even in the presence of prophylactic treatment with metronidazole. Although the data are limited in number, C. diff infection may be associated with a higher incidence and severity of gut aGvHD. Prospective studies are required to defi ne optimal prophylaxis of C. diff. infection and its impact on gut aGvHD.",

Kazmi, E. MacMahon, K. Raj Guy's Hospital (London, UK) The estimated frequency of parainfl uenza virus 3 (PIV-3) infections following haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is 2-5% with mortality discrepantly reported as between 17-75%. It is the policy of our unit to test HCST recipients with upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms for respiratory viruses by immunofl uorescence of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) or broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) samples. We report a retrospective analysis of the outcomes of PIV-3 infection in our unit over an 8 month period. Sixteen HSCT patients developed a PIV-3 infection (allogeneic =15, autologous =1). Nosocomial transmission occurred in 14 cases. Infection between 3-568 days from stem cell return, in 3 cases pre-engraftment. All patients had upper respiratory tract infection (URI) while lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) with virus detected on BAL occurred in 6. Thirteen patients were treated with aerosolised ribavirin (2g tds for 5 days) and IV immunoglobulin (0.5g/kg) as per standard protocol. One patient refused treatment while two with full immune reconstitution were not treated. Overall mortality was 50%. Seven of the 13 patients (54%) treated with ribavirin/IVIG died. Risk factors -respiratory failure (n=9, mortality 89%), multiple co-pathogens (n=8, mortality 75%), septic shock/multi-organ failure (n=7, mortality 86%), LRI (n=6, mortality 66%). acute GVHD on prednisolone \u2265 1mg/kg (n=5, mortality 80%), infection pre-engraftment (n=3, mortality 100%). The pulmonary co-pathogens isolated were predominantly Gm-ve bacteria (n=8) but also included Gm+ve bacteria (n=2) and fungi (n=2). Our series confi rms the high mortality associated with PIV-3 infection in HSCT recipients particularly in those with LRI, secondary bacterial/fungal infections and those receiving steroids for GVHD. A similar case series reported a lower mortality although over half the patients receiving broad spectrum antibiotics/antifungals at diagnosis (Dignan et al, J Hosp Inf, 2006 (63), 452-458) . PIV-3 predisposes to secondary bacterial infection by increasing expression of bacterial receptors on viral infected respiratory cells. Strategies to disrupt the binding of PIV-3 Haemagglutin-Neuraminidase to respiratory cells are in development. Meanwhile in patients who develop PIV-3 infection despite strict enforcement of infection control policies, the best strategy may be careful risk assessment, with effective broad spectrum anti-microbials in those at risk of secondary infection.",

Fields, K. Raj, E. MacMahon, M. Kazmi Guy's Hospital (London, UK) The incidence of Haemorrhagic Cystitis (HC) post haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) varies from 5-40%. Most early HC (day 0-20) can be attributed to chemotherapy while viral infections (polyomaviruses (BK/JC), adenovirus) are implicated in late HC (>day 20). BK viruria is detected in 50-100% of patients following HSCT with or without HC. Graft versus host S244 disease (GVHD), fl udarabine and T-cell depletion are risk factors for late onset HC. Our aim was to estimate the frequency of HC associated with BK virus reactivation following myelo-ablative (MA) and nonmyeloablative (NMA) transplantation and to review the effi cacy of Cidofovir in these patients. Over 24 months 106 patients underwent 108 transplant procedures (60 autologous (55%) and 48 allogeneic (45%)). HC occurred in 9 of 108 (8%) transplant recipients all allogeneic transplants. The frequency following allogeneic transplant was 19% (9/48). Conditioning was myelo-ablative (MA) in 5 and non-myeloablative (NMA) in 4 cases. Early HC occurred in 4/48 (8%) all following MA conditioning and without associated BK viraemia. Late HC associated with BK viraemia and viruria occurred in 4/48 patients (8%). Three patients received NMA conditioning with Alemtuzumab in all and Fludarabine in 2 cases. One patient received MA conditioning with Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide. Initially Cidofovir 5mg/kg was used in 2 patients and BK virus DNA became undetectable in the blood with resolution of haematuria. However in view of the apparent effi cacy of a low dose approach, 1mg/kg without probenecid (Savona et al, Bone Marrow Transplant 2007; 39:787-787) , two patients received Cidofovir 1mg/kg. With this approach treatment was ineffective and HC persisted, although both patients were on immunosuppressive therapy for acute GVHD. In this small series BK virus associated HC was more frequent following NMA transplantation, in contrast to a recent report (Giraud et al, Bone Marrow Transplant (2008) 41, 737-742) . This may relate to the frequent use of Fludarabine and Alemtuzumab as T cell depletion in our centre. Cidofovir (5mg/kg) appeared more effective at clearing BK virus DNA from the blood and urine leading to resolution of HC. In cases with risk factors such as GVHD or high dose immunosuppression with rising BK DNA in the blood or urine low dose Cidofovir could be considered as pre-emptive treatment.",

Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), as part of the innate immune system, are key players in antifungal immune responses, recognizing fungal pathogens at an early step of infection. Besides phagocytic mechanisms, PMNs kill pathogens by the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Methods: Human PMNs were isolated from blood of healthy donors using Biocoll separation. Cells were co-cultivated with conidia, germlings and hyphae of the clinical strain ATCC 9197. The oxidative burst was determined in a kinetic measurement quantifying dichlorfl uorescein production. Chemotaxis was analyzed by transwell assays. Furthermore, total RNA was extracted and gene expression profi ling was performed using Affymetrix U133Plus2.0 arrays. Results: We could demonstrate that A. fumigatus represents a strong stimulus releasing ROS, depending on the morphotype; germlings revealed high ROS release, whereas resting conidia showed low stimulation capacity. PMNs actively tracked germlings and directly attached to fungi as demonstrated by realtime microscopy. Transwell assays revealed that chemotaxis of PMN is strongly dependent on the fungal morphotype; PMN showed only weak chemotaxis in the presence of conidia, whereas in the presence of germlings, high chemotactic activity was achieved.",

Gesundheit, R. Or, E. Budowski, M. Shapira, I. Resnick, S. Samuel, L. Dray, O. Kaplan, D. Wolf Hadassah Hebrew University Hospital (Jerusalem, IL) Background: Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances, cytomegalovirus (CMV) has remained a signifi cant complication after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The widespread use of preemptive antiviral therapy has reduced the occurrence of early CMV disease and changed its epidemiology. In order to defi ne the current trends and to establish future guidelines, we retrospectively analyzed the rate of CMV infection and disease in the following types of HSCT: No statistically signifi cant differences were found between the CMV-donor and recipient serostatus in the 3 categories of allogeneic HSCT. The rate of CMV infection was signifi cantly higher in allogeneic compared to autologous HSCT (p < 0.001), with no signifi cant differences between the 3 types of allogeneic HSCT. However, the rate of disease was signifi cantly higher in haploidentical HSCT (p < 0.001). 15 of the 16 patients with CMV disease had a fatal outcome. We are presently analyzing the viral load kinetics and the associated risk factors in the different HSCT categories. Conclusions: Preemptive antiviral approach proved to be effective in the prevention of CMV disease in autologous, fully matched and mismatched allogeneic HSCT recipients. The increased rate of CMV disease and associated mortality in recipients of haploidentical HSCT despite preemptive antiviral therapy refl ects their delayed immune reconstitution and raises concern regarding the effectiveness of the current preemptive antiviral approach. Based on our fi ndings, close monitoring and prophylactic antiviral treatment should be employed in this high-risk subgroup of HSCT recipients.",

Benedetti (1) Neutropenic enterocolitis (NEC) is a life threatening complication of patients treated with chemotherapy. The cecum is almost always affected, but the terminal ileum, other parts of the small bowel and right and left colon can also be involved by the disease. Perforation occurs in 5%-10% of cases. Early diagnosis is crucial to start conservative medical management which appears the optimal strategy for most cases. Despite aggressive management mortality rate are high up to 21-48%. NEC should be always suspected in Neutropenic patients with abdominal pain, fever and diarrhoea. Ultrasound (US) was used to evaluate bowel-wall thickening (BWT). The degree of BWT correlated with the outcome in one study and 60% of patients with BWT > 10 mm died from this complication compared with 4.2% of those with BWT < 10 mm. We evaluated retrospectively NEC cases occurred in the last two years and usefulness of US and 24 fi t patients were identifi ed. Disease diagnosis were: MH 8, ALL 3, AML5 MM 1 and NHL 7. Treatment received was: intensive chemotherapy(10), allogenic transplant with bu/cy (1) and cy/tbi (1), autologous transplant with bu/cy (1), BEAM (10) and, MEL 200 (1). All 24 patients were neutropenic at time of diagnosis. Abdominal pain was present in 23/24 patients. Diarrhoea was present in all patients.

Two patients within 12 hours from diagnosis underwent succesful colon surgery guided by US features of potential wall rupture. Two patients with previous diagnosis of NEC relapsed during subsequent chemotherapy induced neutropenia and one died of sepsis. Overall 3/24 patients died, and 19/24 had complete remission with conservative medical management.

Junghanss University of Rostock (Rostock, DE) Introduction: Despite highly effective primary-prophylactic (PP) antifungal strategies, invasive fungal infections (IFI) are frequently observed following intensive chemotherapies (ctx). Mortality is high and previous IFI enhance the risk of consecutive fungal infections if an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is performed. Here, we report on patients with proven, probable or possible IFI prior to SCT, thus receiving antifungal secondary-prophylaxis (SP) during their SCT. Methods: Data of 202 consecutive patients (pts) who received SCT during 1/99 to 12/06 were retrospectively analysed with regards to outcome of pts with prior proven, probable or possible IFI before SCT. Other factors included were viral infections, gender, age, underlying disease, disease status, donor type, gender-matching between donor and recipient, stem cell source, conditioning-regimen and acute and chronic GvHD. Results: Median follow-up was 9.2mths (8 days to 95.3mths). Median pt age was 45yrs (15 to 69 yrs). Underlying diseases were Leukaemias (n=122), Lymphomas (n=45), MDS (n=21), OMF (n=5), others (n=9). 137 pts received reduced intensity conditioning most commonly based on treosulfane/fl udarabine (n=112). 65 pts received myeloablative conditioning mainly based on 12Gy TBI containing regimen (n=48). GvHD-prophylaxis consisted of CsA/MTX (n=106) or other CsA based regimen (n=83). 22 pts received SP consisiting of Vori-(n=12), Posaconazole (n=2), Caspofungin (n=3) or Amphotericine B (n=5), respectively, due to possible/probable (n=21) or proven (Aspergillus n=1) IFI before SCT. 178 pts received PP mainly consisting of Flu-(n=90) or Itraconazole (n=87). Median survival of pts receiving SP was 4 mths (15 days to 54 mths) compared to a median survival of 24 mths (8 days to 95 mths) in pts receiving PP (p=0.003). 15/22 (68%) pts receiving SP and 86/180 (48%) of pts receiving PP died during the study period. In the SP group causes of death were: 9 infection, 2 relapse, 3 relapse/infection, 1 GvHD. In multivariate analyses SP remained to be associated with inferior survival (p=0.004, HR=2.28, CI 1.29-4.02), besides pts undergoing unrelated donor SCT (p=0.015, HR=1.71, CI 1.11-2.65), high-risk pts (p=0.,044, HR 1.57 CI 1.01-2.43) and pts developing aGvHD III-IV (p=0.011, HR=1.73, CI 1.13-2.65). Conclusion: Despite highly effective antifungal secondary prophylaxis, proven or suspected IFI prior to SCT showed signifi cant infl uence on overall survival after SCT.",

Pi\u00f1ana, R. Martino, N. Rabella, P. Barba, N. Margall, M. Roig, D. Valcarcel, J. Sierra Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (Barcelona, ES) With the purpose of reducing cytomegalovirus (CMV) morbidity and mortality pre-emptive therapy guided by sensitive methods have been developed. The aim of this study was to analyse our 8 years single-centre experience, with 2 different pre-emptive therapy protocols in patients who underwent reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic HSCT (AlloHSCT-RIC). We have retrospectively included 186 consecutive AlloHSCT-RIC adult patients at risk for CMV reactivation. Conditioning regimen was mainly based on Fludarabine plus an alkylating agent. CMV was monitored by pp65 Antigenemiag (pp65 Ag) in 116 patients while 70 patients were monitored by quantitative PCR (quantPCR). Alternative donors (AD), micophenolate mophetil as a part of GVHD prophylaxis and T-cell depleting agents were more frequent in quantPCR group (p< 0.05). The incidence at 2-year of CMV infection (CMV-I) and disease (CMV-D) was 15% in the pp65 Ag and 39% in the PCR period (P<0.01). This difference was due to a higher asymptomatic CMV-I in the quantPCR group (5% vs 27%, (P<0.01). However a 2-year CMV-D incidence of 10% and 12%, are still similar between Antigenemia and quantPCR respectively, (P= 0.5). Patients monitored by pp65 Ag had more often isolate CMV pneumonia (64%) than patients followed by quantPCR (20%) (p=0.01). The proportion of patients with isolated CMV pneumonia with negative screening test was unusually high (66%), especially for patients monitored with pp65 Ag (77%). Multivariate analysis showed that steroids and alternative donors were independent risk factors for CMV-D (HR 4.7, p=0.02 and HR 2.7, p= 0.002, respectively) . Our fi ndings suggest that quantPCR allow us to treat preemptively a larger proportion of patients at higher risk for CMV-D, achieving similar incidence of CMV-D compared to those monitored by pp65 Ag.

Background: After allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT), cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease constitutes a serious complication. CD8+ T cells are pivotal for the clearance of CMV. Adoptive transfer of CMV specifi c T cells might constitute the key to overcome this problem. The novel technology of \"streptamers\" allows the selection of CMVpp65 specifi c CD8+ T cell up to 98% purity without altering the functional properties of the selected T cells and without requiring labor and time consuming T cell cultures. Materials and Methods: Here, the novel streptamer technology was used for adoptive transfer of CMV specifi c T cells into three acute leukemia patients with recurrent high CMV antigenemia after allo-PBSCT, in the case of the third patient in a haploidentical setting. Standard peripheral blood mononuclear cell apheresis was performed on the former stem cell donors of three patients with acute leukemia. Isolation of CMV specifi c donor lymphocytes was performed using a Good Manufacturing Product (GMP)grade Streptamer selection kit on a CliniMacs\u2122 device. Results: A single specifi c donor lymphocyte infusion (sDLI) of 2.2, 0.4 or 0.4 x10 5 CMVpp65 specifi c T cells per kg body weight was performed in an AML or ALL patient respectively, after allogeneic PBSCT developing a CMVpp65 antigenemia with a maximum of 959 or 716 or 190 CMVpp65 positive/500,000 cells and treatment with foscarnet, ganciclovir and valganciclovir. After sDLI, the CMV antigenemia was cleared and remained persistently controlled even after discontinuation of valganciclovir therapy in both patients. No acute or chronic toxic side effect, particularly no aggravation of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was observed. A strong and sustained increase of the absolute count of CMVspecifi c CD8+ T cells was detected. CMV-specifi c CD8+ T cells were CCR7-/CD45RA+, indicating a effector T cell phenotype. The chimerism analysis of the in vivo expanded CMV-specifi c CD8+ T cells demonstrated a 100% donor chimerism. T cell receptor excision circle (sjTRECs) analysis revealed a frequency of sjTRECs two logs lower than expected, indicating peripheral expansion rather than thymic proliferation of CMV specifi c CD8+ T cells. Clonality of transferred cells was proven by PCR of the respective CDR3 region. Conclusion: Streptamer technology constitutes an advantageous technology for selecting CMV specifi c CD8+ T cells at GMP level for adoptive T cell transfer.",

Leone, S. Sica Universit\u00e0 Cattolica S. Cuore (Rome, IT) NOD2/CARD15, member of the NOD family, encodes a protein which is involved in the interaction with infecting bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and so it favour apoptosis and the NFkB signaling pathway inducing the transcription of several genes encoding proinfl ammatory cytokines. R702W, G908R, L1007f insC polymorphisms are supposed to alter the recognition of the bacterial LPS. Supposing an abnormal infl ammatory response to bacterial infections due to these polymorphisms we performed a retrospective analysis of infl uence of them on outcome of pts submitted to autologous HSCT, and we correlated them to transplant complications, as sepsis, organ toxicity, non relapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS). We studied 111 patients submitted to autologous SCT between 1994 and . Allelic variants at SNP12 (G908R) and SNP13 (L1007fi nsC) of the NOD2/CARD15 gene were genotyped by PCR. Incidence of sepsis and organ toxicities were analyzed by beta-2 test while OS and RFS curves were obtained by the Kaplan Meier method and statistically compared by log-rank test. Pts'characteristic were: M66/F45, median age 46 years (range 15-66).Underlying disease were 16 AML, 55 lymphoproliferative disease, 32 MM, 4 POEMS, 4 solid tumor. The median follow-up was 33 months (range 1-129).The most relevant complications in the post-transplant phase were: FUO (55%), documented sepsis (28%) and hepato-renal toxicity (NCI grade II-IV) (48%). Ninety patients relapsed after a median time of 6 months (range 4-85); 97 (87%) out 111 are alive while 14 (13%) died. NOD2/ CARD15 mutations occurred with a frequency of 13%. For SNP12 108 out 111 (97%) patients were unmutated and 4 (3%) patients were heterozygotes, no one was found homozygous; for SNP13 102 (91%) patients were normal, 9 (8%) had heterozygotes genotype and 1 (1%) patient was homozygous. In our casistic we found no correlation between NOD2/CARD15 polymorphisms and incidence of sepsis or organ toxicities after tx; moreover we demonstrated that the presence of NOD-2CARD15 polymorphisms did not infl uence OS and NRM after tx. There are no data in literature regarding NOD2/CARD15 in autologous transplant setting, even if these polymorphisms could infl uence the toxicity grading and the incidence of complications after high dose chemotherapy, altering the interaction between bacterial toxins and monocytes-macrophages system in mucosaes. Probably our results are infl uenced by the low prevalence of these polymorphisms in the Italian gender.",

            "text": "Prospective study of oral valganciclovir for pre-emptive therapy of cytomegalovirus after allogeneic stem cell transplantation R. de la Camara (1) (Barcelona, ES) Intravenous ganciclovir (iv-Gcv) is the standard drug for preemptive therapy of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in allogeneic stem cell (allo-SCT) patients. Valganciclovir (Vgcv), an oral prodrug of ganciclovir, is used very often in practice although there is no approved indication for this specifi c use. We performed a prospective phase II multicentric study with Vgcv in adult patients to evaluate its effi cacy and safety in the pre-emptive treatment of CMV-Ag or DNAemia within the fi rst S247 180 days after SCT. The results will be compared with those obtained with iv-GCV in a retrospective control group. The primary study endpoint was the achievement of negative CMV-AG/ PCR on day 14 of treatment. Secondary end-points were negative CMV-AG/PCR, rate of neutropenia (<500 neutrophils/mm 3 ) and nephrotoxicity, until 35 days after the beginning of treatment. A minimum patient weight of 50 kg was required. Here we presented the results on the fi rst 53 prospective patients treated with Vgcv. Vgcv was given at 900 mg/12h for 14 days (induction therapy) followed by 900 mg/day for another 14 days (maintenance treatment), in both cases adjusted according to renal function. If CMV was positive at day +21, the treatment was considered a failure and Vgcv was stopped. The median age and weight of the patients was 48.2 years and 72 kg. Type of donor: 31 HLA identical siblings, 21 unrelated and 1 related mismatch. Mieloablative conditioning regimen was used in 20 cases and reduced intensity in 33 cases. Twenty cases (38%) had active GVHD and 51 (96%) where receiving immunosuppression at CMV viremia presentation. Median time for CMV-Ag/PCR positivity was 46,5 days after SCT. At day +14, 33 patients remained on Vgcv and had a negative CMV-Ag/PCR. Twenty patients failed: 9 remained CMV positive; 5 had changed to another antiviral due to an increase in viral load (between 6-13 days of treatment); 5 had Vgcv stopped due to adverse events (4 neutropenia and 1 digestive intolerance); 1 patient developed a proved gastric CMV disease on day +9. At day +35, 32 patients (60%) remained CMV-Ag/PCR negative, 7 patients (13%) developed neutropenia, but none developed nephrotoxicity. At 2 months of follow-up no more cases of CMV disease were diagnosed. Oral valganciclovir therapy given at a fi xed dose in patients over 50 kg for the pre-emptive therapy of CMV in allogeneic patients, was effective and with similar toxicity compared with the previous published experience with iv-gcv. Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV) reactivations are serious complications affecting the recipients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as they may lead to post transplant lymoproliferative disorders (PTLD). EBV load measurement in peripheral blood has been shown to be essential for the monitoring of patients; however, the optimal sample type and way of PCR quantifi cation remains uncertain. Aim of the study was to compare the EBV DNA levels in whole blood (WB), in plasma and in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) without (PBMCw/o) or with (PBMCw) normalization towards an endogenous control. Therefore, we examined the blood of 213 paired samples from 37 children and adolescents (median age 10 years; age range 1 to 21 years) who underwent allogeneic HSCT by using real time duplex PCR (ABI Prism 7500). 21/37 (56.8%) patients became EBV positive (EBV+) in peripheral blood following HSCT. The median day on which patients were EBV+ after HSCT for the fi rst time was day +49 (range, day +11 to day +180). In 11/37 (29.7%) patients we observed a total of 14 signifi cant EBV-reactivations, defi ned as >100 copies/ml plasma or >500 copies/\u00b5g PBMC DNA. All reactivations were found in WB, but only in 11/14 (78.6%) patients in their plasma or in 10/14 (71.4%) patients in PBMCw/o. EBV reactivations were frequently earlier detectable in WB than in PBMC or plasma. Comparing the four ways of EBV quantifi cation, we found strongest correlations in PBMC with and without normalization, the correlation coeffi cient r being 0.998 (p<0.0001). But also the EBV DNA levels in WB correlated with those in PBMCw/o or in PBMCw (r=0.81 [p<0.0001] recipients. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of real time PCR methods to detect HCMV in saliva samples of allo-HSCT recipients and to compare it with blood HCMV detection by PCR. Thirty consecutive allo-HSCT recipients, admitted between October 2006 and November 2007, were included in this study. Patients were sampled for PCR analysis from seven days before transplantation (day -7) to 100 days after HSCT (day +100) or until death of recipient. One saliva and one blood samples were attempted to be simultaneously obtained from each recipient once a week during the evaluation course. HCMV DNA load in saliva samples showed a high correlation with blood viral levels, as detected by real time PCR (correlation coeffi cient of 0.858; p<0.0001). Virus DNA levels in blood also showed a positive correlation with antigenemia assays (correlation coeffi cient of 0.773; p<0.0001). One HCMV DNA copy / 200ng DNA in saliva samples corresponded to 41 HCMV DNA copies / 200ng DNA in blood samples. The best possible prediction point set by a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, determining positive results in saliva, was the cut-off point of 2 HCMV DNA copies /200ng DNA, with sensitivity of 70% and specifi city of 75%. Real time PCR assays were able to clearly distinguish levels of HCMV replication in saliva (p = 0.015) and blood (p = 0.008) before, at the beggining and after anti-viral therapy. It was worth noting that HCMV DNA levels in survival patients were lower than in individuals who did not survive. Despite the preliminary nature of our data, this study shows that the highly sensitivity real time PCR test could be useful to identify HCMV DNA in saliva samples and to monitor patients at risk of HCMV disease after allo-SCT.

Hirszfeld Inst. Immun & Exp. Ther. (Wroclaw, PL) In other our study encephalitis was found to be more frequent in patients positive for EBV and to lower extent for HHV-6 DNA copies in blood. Therefore, we reanalyzed our standard S248 psychological observation charts to verify the hypothesis on association between Herpes viruses reactivation and psychological status of alloHSCT patients. The present group included 89 adults and 11 children receiving allograft from sib (45 pts) and alternative donors (55 pts). Routine psychological observation included personal conversation and psychological tests enabling assessment of emotional, cognitive and behavioral status of the patients. We found that patients: (i) with EBV reactivation (number of DNA copies > 100 / 10 5 blood cells) showed more frequently cognitive abnormalities (patients were rather diffi cult in contact and produced illusions and hallucinations) than others (0.54 vs 0.29, p=0.028); (ii) with HHV-6 reactivation (> 10 DNA copies/105 blood cells) had behavioral disturbances as compared to other patients having or lacking other than HHV-6 Herpes viruses in blood (0.55 vs 0.3, p=0.012); (iii) the presence of CMV reactivation did not signifi cantly associate with mental disturbances. In multivariate analyses we analyzed the presence of emotional, behavioral and cognitive abnormalities against EBV (>100 DNA copies/105 blood cells) and HHV-6 (>100 DNA copies/105 blood cells) reactivations and the presence of aGvHD, encephalitis, hepatitis, cystitis, pneumonia, relapse, sex and age of patients and also donor-recipient gender relation. EBV reactivation together with age and the presence of aGvHD were independently associated with the presence of any of psychological abnormalities analyzed. When HHV-6 was considered it became apparent that this virus reactivation contributes to all those abnormalities individually, similarly to the situation seen in EBV study, with age and the presence of aGvHD. From this study it is apparent that psychological status of HSCT patients is affected by reactivation of EBV and HHV-6 but not CMV. Herpes viruses reactivation constitutes severe complication with a high rate of mortality especially in patients on immunosuppression post haematopoietic stems cell transplantation. One hundred and two (45 SIB, 57 MUD) HSCT recipients were followed for CMV, HHV6 and EBV reactivation (qPCR) in the context of immunological reconstitution and post transplant complications. All tests were performed beginning from haematological reconstitution and then in one week intervals while patients in the hospital, at later time each time while seen in our outpatient department and when clinical symptoms were suggestive of viral reactivation (usually 8 observations during fi rst year post HSCT). More than 100 viral DNA copies/105 blood cells seen at least on one occasion during one year post transplant period was signifi cantly associated with clinical complications (29/66 vs 6/36, p<0.01 and 24/66 vs 4/36, p=0.01 for EBV and CMV, respectively). CMV, EBV and HHV6 DNA copies (above 100 copies/100 000 cells) were detected in 34%, 27% and 26% of patients, respectively. Acute GvHD (grade \u2265I) constituted the main risk of CMV (17/35 vs 18/67, p<0.05) but not of EBV and HHV6 reactivation. CMV reactivation was associated with higher rate of bacterial pneumonia (7/11 vs 28/91 p=0.04) and was more often in (i) adults (2/16 vs 33/86, p<0 .05), (ii) patients positive for IgG CMV anti-bodies prior to HSCT (34/84 vs 1/10 p=0.08) and (iii) in those receiving HLA mismatched graft (9/16 vs 26/86 p=0.08). EBV reactivation was associated with encephalitis (7/12 vs 21/80 p=0.01) and relapse (6/12 vs 22/90 p=0.08), the presence of EBV IgG antibodies in donors (28/84 vs 0/10 p=0.03), female donor (18/47 vs 10/55 p=0.03), and female recipient (16/42 vs 12/60 p=0.07). HHV6 reactivation was associated with encephalitis (6/12 vs 21/90 p=0.08), but in contrast to EBV and CMV, was rather rare in patients with extensive cGvHD (22/61 vs 1/23 p<0.01) and in those receiving HLA matched graft (26/86 vs 1/16 p=0.06). Both CMV and EBV reactivation were associated with a low proportion of CD8high+ CMV pp65 reactive (0.38%\u00b10.07 vs 0.88%\u00b10.12, p=0.03) and CD8high+ EBV BLMF-1 reactive cells (0.284%\u00b10.047 vs 0.48%\u00b10.06, p<0.01). Multivariate analysis proved that the factors listed above play an independent role in reactivation of investigated herpes viruses. Supported by the MNiSW grant N401 169 32/3358.",

Santoro Humanitas (Rozzano, IT) Introduction: Antibacterial prophylaxis after high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous peripheral stem cell (PBSC) support is still controversial. However, a recent randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that prophylactic levoxacin reduced the incidence of fever, probable infections with shorter hospitalization in patients treated with HDC. The aim of this work is to evaluate the role of levoxacin analyzing two consecutive cohorts of patients, receiving HDC, with or without prophylaxis. Patients ad methods: From October 2004 to November 2006, 98 HDC was performed in 74 patients. Patient characteristics are showed in Table 1 . Only patients reinfused with <5x10 6 CD34+/Kg received G-CSF from day +5. The fi rst cohort (A) of patients without prophylaxis was treated until 2005. The second cohort (B) with prophylaxis was treated from 2005 and thereafter. Prophylaxis with levofl oxacin was started during conditioning regimens and stopped in case of fever. At this time, an empiric antibiotic treatment was administered, preceded by blood cultures, chest X-ray and all others diagnostic tools. Microbiological sample analysis were performed weekly for each patients during aplasia period. Primary end points were incidence and duration of fever, secondary end points were documented infections, time to discharge, prevalence of quinolone-resistance strains in stools, mortality due to infection. Results: In cohort A incidence of fever was 77,8%, with median duration of 2,8 days. Incidence of documented infections was 47,2%. Incidence of fever in severe mucositis 72,7%. Prevalence of quinolone-resistance strains 80%. In cohort B incidence of fever was 62,9%, median duration 4,1. Incidence of documented infections 48,4%. Incidence of fever in severe mucositis was 80,6%. Prevalence of quinolone-resistance was 94%. No statistical differences were seen between the two cohorts. Discharging day after reinfusion was 16 in both groups. Overall mortality due to infections was null in the fi rst 100 days after HDC. Microbiological data suggest that cohort B has a higher incidence of resitant pathogens. Conclusion: Furthermore, our results suggest that antibacterial prophylaxis will not be a must for neutropenia after HDC.",

El-cheikh, L. Wang, C. Faucher, S. Furst, B. Esterni, P. Berger, D. Blaise Institut Paoli Calmettes (Marseille, FR) Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA) is a major cause of morbidity in patients with hematological malignancies. The aim of this single centre retrospective study was to determine the impact of prior IPA on outcome after RIC Allo-SCT. All cases of proven or probable IPA diagnosed prior to performance of RIC Allo-SCT at our Cancer Centre. 28 patients were identifi ed among 434 patients undergoing Allo-SCT. Gender: M/F (16/12); median age at diagnosis was 53 years (18-65). 23 patients (82%) had acute myeloid leukemia. IPA was diagnosed according to standard procedures. IPA therapy included: 20 patients (71%) were receiving Voriconazole; 4 patients Itraconazole, and 4 patients with an association of different antifungal drugs including Caspofungine, Liposomal Amphoteracine-B, or Posaconazole. The median duration of treatment prior to RIC was 8 months range (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . The median time between the diagnosis of IPA and transplantation was 6 months ; 20 patients (71%) received a graft from a family donor, 4 patients had a MUD, and 4 patients received cord blood cells donors. 21 patients (75%) received a conditioning regimen with Fludarabine Busulfan and ATG, and 4 patient (14%) received a conditioning with Fludarabine Cyclophosphamide and TBI, 3 patients (11%) Fludarabine and TBI, Most patients (n=25; 89%) received or continued a secondary prophylaxis against aspergillosis at time of Allo-SCT: 17 (68%) had a prophylaxis with Voriconazole; 3 patients Itraconazole, 2 patients Posaconazole. After RIC transplantation only 4 patients (14%) had reactivation of their IPA. The latter 4 patients were experiencing severe acute GVHD treated with high dose corticosteroids. None of these patients died of IPA. Actually 18 patients (64%) are still alive with a median follow up of 23.5 months (12.6-48.5) . Overall survival at 2 years was 59% [95%CI, . In all, 3 patients died from other causes not directly related to IPA, 2 patients because of relapse or disease progression, and one due extensive chronic GVHD. In comparison to literature in standard my\u00e9loablative allo-SCT setting, these data suggest that adequately treated and controlled IPA prior to RIC Allo-SCT do not worsen outcome. The latter is likely due to multiple changes in transplantation practice, including the RIC nature of the conditioning regimens, the infusion of peripheral blood stem cells, rapid diagnosis of IPA, and use of modern effi cient antifungal drugs.",

Abdelkefi (1) Objectives: A central venous access is always necessary for the management of patients receiving myeloablative conditioning followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Tunnelled, cuffed silastic catheters are the device of choice for these patients. To our knowledge, there are no prospective studies investigating the use of totally implantable central venous access ports (TIAP) in patients receiving myeloablative conditioning followed by allogeneic SCT. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the usefulness of a new \"high fl ow\" single lumen port device in these patients. Methods: Between December 2007 and November 2008 at the National Centre for Bone Marrow Transplantation (Tunisia), patients with haematological malignancies received a TIAP prior to allogeneic SCT. All patients received the same type of port [silicone, 10 French, high fl ow rate (3100ml/h), Reference 40010, Laboratoires Perouse, Ivry le Temple, France]. All devices were inserted under local anesthesia through direct puncture of the right subclavian vein using the Seldinger technique. A chest X-ray was always obtained to document correct positioning. All infusions, including the graft itself and all blood drawings, were performed via the port. Port-related bloodstream infection was defi ned according to Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines. All patients were examined by ultrasonography in case of clinical signs of thrombosis and systematically after discharge. Results: Thirty fi ve TIAP were placed in 35 patients [median age: 26 years (20-40 years); 14 female and 21 male], and remained in place for a cumulative duration of 7302 days in situ (range 30-350 days). No pneumothorax occurred. Port-related bloodstream infection (candida parapsilosis) occurred in only 1 case (1/35, 2.8% ; 0.1 event per 1000 days). This port was removed. No port-related thrombosis occurred. No port-related deaths were observed. In conclusion, the use of \"high fl ow\" totally implantable ports has resulted in a good option for long-term access to central veins and delivery of myeloablative conditioning followed by allogeneic SCT, in spite of severe neutropenia and increased risk of sepsis in this category of patients. Although multicentre randomized clinical trials are needed to defi ne the optimal device in this clinical setting, the results of this prospective study support the wider use of TIAP in patients receiving myeloablative conditioning followed by allogeneic SCT.",

Fanin (1) (1)Division of Haematology (Udine, IT); (2)Dpt Transfusion Medicine (Udine, IT) Objectives: In order to identify prognostic factors, we analyzed the outcome of 116 patients with haematological malignancies who underwent allogeneic SCT with reduced-intensity conditioninig (RIC) in our Centre between January 2002 and June 2008. Patients and methods: Median age was 56 years (range 19-69). Haematological diseases were: acute leukemia 28, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma 22, indolent lymphoma 18, Hodgkin lymphomas 19, multiple myeloma 21, idiopathic myelofi brosis 8. Pretreatment included autologous SCT (50) or more than 3 previous chemotherapy regimens (49). Disease status before SCT was: complete remission (41), partial response (26), refractory disease (49). Comorbidity index (CI) was higher than 1 in 57 patients (49%). Conditioning regimens were mainly based on thiotepa plus cyclophosphamide plus fl udarabine. Stem cells came from sibling donors (53) or from matched unrelated donors (63). Ninety-seven patients (84%) received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). GVHD prophylaxis was based on cyclosporine, short-term methotrexate and ATG in unrelated transplants. Fluconazole was administered as antifungal prophylaxis. We analyzed the infl uence of pre-transplant and post-transplant variables on TRM and OS by means of the univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: The cumulative incidence of engraftment was 93%. The estimated 1-and 3-year TRM were 23% and 26% respectively. The estimated 3 year-OS and disease-free-survival (DFS) were 53% and 48%. Grade II-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD developed in 35% and 45% of the patients. Twenty-one patients (18%) presented a proven or probable mycotic infection after SCT. Among pretransplant factors, only CI higher than 1 signifi cantly increased TRM and shortened OS, while patient age, disease type and status, donor and stem cell features did not affect outcome. Among post-transplant factors, development of grade II-IV acute GVHD or extensive chronic GVHD or mycotic infections signifi cantly increased TRM rate and shortened OS. Conclusions: Our experience demonstrated that post-transplant factors such as GVHD and fungal infections were more likely to affect outcome after RIC transplant than pre-transplant features of patients, donors and stem cell source. Only pre-transplant patient CI higher 1 was a signifi cant unfavourable outcome predictor. Therefore, every effort should be made to potentiate GVHD and infection prevention after RIC transplants.",

The patients with high IgM levels at 3 months showed lower viral or fungal infection rate. Acute GVHD (grade II-IV) and steroid use affected negatively on IgM recovery (OR=0.369, p=0.027). In addition, overall survival was better in patients with high IgM levels at 3 months compared to low IgM levels (5-year OS=72% vs. 48%; HR=0.425, p=0.034).

Fo\u00e0 Azienda Policlinico Umberto I (Rome, IT) Objectives: Infections represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cord blood transplant (CBT) recipients. We analyzed the impact of infections on mortality and the factors associated with an increased infectious risk in patients who received a CBT at our Center. Methods: Between 1996 and 2007, 69 consecutive patients with a high risk hematologic malignancy who underwent CBT were evaluated. Patients received two types of conditioning regimen (with or without TBI) and the same supportive care. The median age of the patients was12 years (range, 1-42 years); 46 were children (age <18 years) and 23 adults. Results: Overall, 88.4%, 18.4%, 58% and 11.6% of patients developed at least one bacterial, fungal, CMV or EBV infection, respectively. Most infections occurred in the fi rst 100 days from transplant, in particular 88.8% of bacteremis, 69.2% of fungal infections, 95% of the fi rst CMV infections and 37.5% of the fi rst EBV infections were documented during this period. 77% of H. zoster infections occurred after 1 year post-transplant at discontinuation of antiviral prophylaxis. No difference in the incidence of all types of infection was observed between children and adults. The 10 year actuarial overall survival is 40% (50% in children and 18% in adults). Infections were considered the primary or secondary cause of death in 28.6% of recipients who died. At multivariate analysis, adult age represented the only factor signifi cantly associated with mortality. The occurrence of any infection had no effect on the overall survival. Univariate analysis failed to identify any signifi cant risk factor for bacterial infections. At multivariate analysis, the only signifi cant risk factor for fungal infections was the period of transplant (CBT performed in the years 2002-2007 were more frequently complicated by fungal infections compared to CBT performed in the years 1996-2001). Factors signifi cantly associated with an increased risk of CMV and EBV infections at multivariate analysis were a positive CMV serology of the recipient at transplant and the development of acute GVHD, respectively. Conclusions: Our study confi rms the relevance of infections as a source of severe morbidity in CBT, particularly in the fi rst 100 days post-transplant; however, unlike previous experiences, age was not associated with an increased risk of any type of infection and infections did not represent the major cause of death.",

No data are available on VEGF kinetics in haematological patients with neutropenic fever. We evaluated prospectively serum VEGF and CRP kinetics in 42 adult haematological patients (26 males, 16 females, median age 57 years) with fever. Twentyseven patients had received an autologous stem cell transplant (non-Hodgkin lymphoma 13, multiple myeloma 7, Hodgkin lymphoma 6, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 1) and 15 patients had received induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia. The blood samples were taken at the onset of fever (d 0) and then daily for three days. Time from d0 to peak serum VEGF concentration (mean 1.02 with SE 0.18 d) was shorter that to the peak of CRP concentration (mean 1.93 with SE 0.18 d) (p=0.002). In general VEGF values were low in comparison to previous studies. Patients with severe sepsis (n=5) had higher VEGF values on d0 (77 pg/ml vs 52 pg/ml, p=0.06) and on d1 (82 pg/ml vs. 56 pg/ml, p=0.05) than patients without severe sepsis (n=37). No signifi cant differences were observed in median CRP values between patients with and without severe sepsis at any time points analysed. This study shows that also neutropenic and thrombocytopenic haematological patients with fever are capable of producing VEGF during sepsis. High levels were associated with development of severe sepsis in patients with neutropenic fever. VEGF might be more rapid indicator for severe sepsis than CRP in haematological patients with neutropenic fever. Further studies on VEGF in febrile haematological patients are warranted. A.

(Ankara, TR) Background: Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are the major stem cell source for autologous stem cell transplantation. Bacterial contamination (BC) of the collected PBSC is a major problem, which is seldomly reported. The multi-stage processing of autoPBSC till infusion incapacitates hazards for BC. There are several published reports about BC but its impact on mortality and morbidity is seldomly shared. In our single center prospective non-controlled study we aimed to determine the source of contamination at all possible stages and its clinical relevance. Patients and Methods: Our center is performing more than 100 leukopheresis and SCT per year. Candidates for autoPBSC transplantation are consecutively entered into this study. We analyzed 30 completed leukopheresis procedures on 18 patients, whose median age was 52 y (range, 25-68) with diagnoses of lymphoma and myeloma. One ml. samples were collected into the BD Bactec Ped/Plus Aerobic&Anaerobic blood culture bottles at the following stages in aspetic conditions: before and after leukopheresis from peripheral vein or from both catheter arms, in collected PBSC, just before cryopreservation from the cryobags, just after thawing at the time of infusion. Bacteriological examination was performed by BACTEC 9050 blood culture system. Growing microorganisms (MO) were identifi ed using conventional methods and gr(+) crystal ID Kit. Results: We identifi ed MO in 12 PBSC procedures of 10 patients. The majority was gr(+) cocci (%77.7) as expected and gr(-) bacilli (%22.3). Gr(+) MO were staph. epidermidis (%85.7), staphylococcus heamolyticus (%14.3) and all of the gr(-) bacilli isolated were pseud. aeroginosa. The stages of bacterial growth are depicted in table 1. The major stage for contamination was leukopheresis procedure, followed by preparation of cryosolution and thawing. The majority of the MO grown at the primary stages were not identifi ed after thawing. Only in 4/30 procedures we identifi ed MO in infused PBSC. They did not develop any relevant infectious complications during peritransplant period. Conclusion: Collection of autoPBSC and transplantation are multistage consecutive procedures, which are prone to bacterial contamination. The contamination risk during leukopheresis was higher than expected and gr(+) MO in the majority. After cryopreservation only in a minority of infusions we detected bacterial contamination which did not develop signifi cant clinical infectious episodes of the same MO.",

The fi rst 3-6 months after SCT is considered as the most critical period due to severe immuosuppression and poor T cell immune reconstitution. Monitoring of patients against adenovirus infections might be a useful strategy to decrease the morbidity and possibly mortality. Aim: To study adenovirus specifi c T-cell responses in adult SCT recipients Patients and methods: 24 allogeneic SCT patients were included. All patients were adults; age ranged 19-66 years. 23 patients had hematological malignancies. The patients were monitored with weekly blood samples by a quantitative adenovirus PCR on plasma during the fi rst three months. Adenovirus specifi c T cell responses were assessed by ELISPOT after stimulation with adenovirus lysate at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after SCT. 20 spots/1 x 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells were regarded as a positive result. Results: 215 samples were analysed by adenovirus PCR (median 8 samples/patient). All were negative. 59 ELISPOT assays were performed. 20/24 (83%) patients were positive; 53% at 4 weeks, 55% at 8 weeks and 43% at 12 weeks after SCT. There was a tendency for the response to become weaker over time (8 w vs. to 4 w; p=ns; 12 w. vs 8 w; p = .058). Patients who received PBSC grafts were more likely than other patients to have an adeno T-cell response at 4 weeks (6/10 vs 1/4; p = ns) and 8 weeks after SCT (9/13 vs. 1/5; p=.058). There were no effects by conditioning intensity, donor type or severity of acute GVHD. Conclusion: A majority of allo SCT patients had detectable adenovirus specifi c T cell immune response during the fi rst three months after SCT.",

We report our results in sibling HLA identical and in VUD transplants, all receiving low dose ATG Fresenius (Bad Homburg, D); a substantial reduction of GVHD, especially the chronic form, has been observed without an increase in infections. From 2001 infections. From to 2005 transplants have been performed here in patients with hematological malignancies. 77 patients received VUD transplants and 102 HLA identical sibling transplants. The BM was the source of HSC in 50% of the cases, PBSC in 48% and cord blood in 2%. Median age was 40 yrs (range, 18-61); one third had AML/MDS. One third had early disease. The preparative regimen was myeloablative in 73% of the cases. GVHD prophylaxis was attempetd with CsA and short term MTX. The VUD patients received, in all cases, ATG-Fresenius, usually at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg /day for fi ve days (from days -6 to -2, total dose from 15 to 30 mg/kg). All patients received Fluconazole as prophylxis. There were 11 possible cases, 1 probable and 7 proved, of which 5 were autoptic. Candida ans Pneumocystic occurred in one case, each, Aspergillus fumigatus in 7 and A. Terreus in 2, one patient having Aspergillus + Candida, Main site of involvement was the lung (19), the rest being CNS and para-nasal sinuses(1 each), kidney (2) and myocardium (1) . The mean day of onset was + 25; in 11 patients infection occurred during cytopenia, in 8 after cytopenia, always associated with high dose steroids (5 cGHVD, 3 no GVHD). 8% of the infections occurred in VUD transplants, 12% in sibling transplants; 67% occurred in advanced disease and there was no difference between myeloablative and RIC regimens, 28% and 27%, respectively. Therapy had a mean duration of 30 days (3-120), was with a single agent in 13 pts and multiple drugs in 6(sequential 5, combined 1). Response to therapy-lyposomal Amphotericin, caspofungin, voriconazole was: failure in 9 cases who died, 4 no responses and 6 improvement/resolution. No difference was observed between VUD and sibling transplants. Our results underline the prognostic importance of advanced disease and steroid use in the risk of developing IFI, and no difference between family and VUD transplants. Thus, the use of low dose ATG-F doesn't increase the risk of IFI after transplantation.",

Nozzoli (1) Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection represents the most frequent viral complication in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo HSCT). We investigated the development of CMV-specifi c T-cells reconstitution in adult recipients of allo HSCT. Patiens and methods: Since January 2008 23 consecutive recipients of allo HSCT were monitored for CMV reactivation by Q-PCR and for CMV-specifi c T-cell recovery using interferongamma-enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. 12 pts received an allo HSCT from an unrelated donor (UD) and 11 from an identical sibling (IS) one. Diagnosis were: AML 12, CML 4, ALL 3, MDS 2, MM 1; lymphoma 1; median age was 43 yrs (range 19-63); 14 were male/9 female; 16 pts conventional conditioning and 7 reduced intensity. 6 pts received a TBI based conditioning; 11 pts received ATG and 1 Campath-1H as part of conditioning regimen. Stem cell source was peripheral blood in 14 pts, bone marrow in 4 and cord blood in 5 pts (at least 4/6 mismatched). Recipients CMV serostatus was positive in all. CMV Q-PCR was weekly performed from the engraftment and ELISPOT assay was done at day +30,+60,+90 and at the time of CMV reactivation. Valganciclovir was employed in preemptive treatment. Results: 12/23 (52%) patients experienced CMV reactivation within a median time from HSCT of 43 days (range 22-60). The median CMV DNA copies was 19249/ml (range 4030-565.000 viral copies/ml). CMV reactivation developed among allo IS HSCT in 5/11 (45%) vs 7/12 (58%) of alloUD HSCT recipients, with no differences in interval and median CMV DNA viral load (42 vs 43 days; 18480/ml vs 20000/ml). ELISPOT assay performed at +30 days revealed a median value of 52 CMV T lymphocytes/200.000 cells (range 0-50.000) in all allo HSCT recipients, 26 in pts reactivating CMV (range 0-338) and 96 (range 1-50000) in those who did not reactivate. Particularly at the time of CMV reactivation, ELISPOT showed 90 CMV T lympocytes/200.000 cells (range 0-419) in all group, with differences between allo IS and allo UD (96 vs 27) and CMV viral clearance of 21 vs 41 days respectively. Conclusion: CMV-specifi c T-cells response in allo HSCT at high risk of reactivation for CMV recipient serostatus, seems to be related to type of donor and T-depletion and appear to predict the CMV reactivation rate and the response to therapy. Background: RSV represents a common infectious complication of HSCT, with signifi cant short and long term morbidity. If left untreated, the mortality from RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) approaches 100%. Aerosolized Ribavirin has been reported to improve survival from 0% to 60-70% and increased further to 80-90% with the addition of high titre RSV IVIg or Palivizumab. Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against RSV that has been shown to be safe and well tolerated when used as prophylaxis in high risk infants (prematurity or bronchopumonary dysplasia), leading to a 55% reduction in hospitalisation. Data on its use in the setting of HSCT are limited. Methods: 8 HSCT recipients (table 1) received aerosolised Ribavirin and a single intravenous dose of 15mg/kg Palivizumab within three days of diagnosis. The choice of dose and route of administration were based on a previous phase I study in HSCT recipients. The use of Palivizumab was an individual decision of the treating physician in each case. Results: No side effects, haematological or other organ toxicities were documented for any of the patients. By polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 6 of the 8 patients became RSV negative after treatment. One tested positive 3 days after treatment and was not repeated subsequently, and the other, showed reduction of the number of RSV infected cells by immunofl uorescence but again, was not repeated subsequently. Both patients improved clinically and were discharged from hospital. Two patients died; the fi rst of neutropenic sepsis and progression of his primary haematological disease. At the time of death he was negative for RSV by PCR. The other, who had developed severe RSV LRTI requiring intubation, was negative for RSV by PCR after treatment, improved clinically and was eventually extubated, but subsequently developed Pseudomonas pneumonia to which he fi nally succumbed. There were no deaths attributed to RSV. (table 2) Conclusion: Our experience supports the existing evidence that Palivizumab is safe in HSCT recipients, and for the limited number of patients that were treated, there was evidence of viral clearance while no RSV related deaths occurred, suggesting that further studies are warranted in this setting.",

Oshima (1) Background: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation remains a common complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Long-term prophylaxis with lowdose acyclovir against VZV reactivation has been reported to be effective. We carried out a trial of prophylaxis with longterm low-dose valacyclovir, which is a prodrug of acyclovir with higher bioavailability, against VZV reactivation after allogeneic HSCT to evaluate its effi cacy and safety. Methods: Adult patients seropositive for VZV-IgG antibody before HSCT were enrolled in this prospective study. Underlying diseases, preparative regimen and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis were not concerned, but patients who received anti-thymocyte globulin or T-cell depletion were excluded. Patients received oral acyclolovir 1,000 mg/day until day 35 after HSCT. Oral valacyclovir 500 mg/day three times a week was started on day 36 and continued until 1 year after HSCT. Development of VZV reactivation was monitored until 2 years after HSCT. Results: Forty patients with a median age of 43 years (18 -61) were enrolled. Three patients had aplastic anemia and the remaining 37 patients had hematological malignancies. Valacyclovir was well torelated in all but one patient who discontinued it on day 224 due to thrombocytopenia of unknown cause. Seven patients developed VZV reactivation at a median of 479 days (range 145 -651 days) after HSCT, with a cumulative incidence of 18.5%. With this prophylaxis, visceral dissemination and serious complications other than post-herpetic neuralgia was completely eliminated. All patients who experienced VZV reactivation responded well to the therapeutic dose of valacyclovir or intravenous acyclovir. Two patients who were receiving steroids for acute GVHD developed breakthrough reactivation during the prophylaxis. The other 5 patients developed VZV reactivation after the discontinuation of valacyclovir, four of whom had developed extensive chronic GVHD. As for the evaluation of risk factors, VZV reactivation was more frequently observed in patients who developed grade II-IV acute GVHD, but it was not statistically signifi cant (13.1% vs 26.7%, P=0.24). Discussion: Long-term low-dose valacyclovir can be safely and effectively administered for the prevention of VZV-related complications after allogeneic HSCT. However, VZV reactivation cannot be completely eliminated and thus close monitoring is still required, especially for patients with GVHD. Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is a leading cause of non relapse mortality in allogeneic SCT recipients. This is the fi rst study evaluating low-dose amphotericin B lipid complex (Abelcet) as antifungal prophylaxis in patients undergoing SCT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effi cacy of low-dose Abelcet or Ambisome antifungal prophylaxis in 87 patients undergoing SCT for thalassemia (n=81) or sickle cell disease (n=6): 38 patients in the Ambisome arm and 49 patients in the Abelcet arm. The two study arms were balanced for baseline demographic characteristics. Culture tests for fungal organism were performed before the start of prophylaxis and, thereafter once weekly and were taken from blood, urine, throat and stool. Blood samples for Aspergillus galactomannan and PCR for Aspergillus DNA were taken once a week. Patients in both arm received the study drug after SCT from day of profound neutropenia (ANC <200) until discharge. In the Ambisome arm patients started on study drug 1 mg/kg every other day until the fi rst fungal colonization and thereafter they received the drug 1 mg/kg per day. In the Abelcet arm patients received the drug at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day. The median total dose of the study drugs and their median consumption by patients, and median duration of prophylaxis were similar in both treatment arms. Patients in the Ambisome arm had signifi cantly more post transplant fungal colonization compared to the Abelcet arm [15 (44%) vs 10 (21%); p=0.030]. Candida species comprised the vast majority of isolates. Median time to development of colonization was signifi cantly short in the Ambisome than in the Abelcet arm (8 days vs 20 days; p=0.033). Duration of neutropenia was similar in both arms and there was not signifi cant difference between colonization and duration of neutropenia. There was no correlation between disease related covariates such as serum ferritin, liver iron concentration, number of red blood cell transfusion units, risk classes, and post transplant fungal colonization or IFI in both arms. In each arm 2 patients had probable or proven IFI. One patient in the Ambisome arm and 2 patients in the Abelcet arm had moderate adverse events as fever and chills. There was not signifi cant difference between the Ambisome and the Abelcet arm in any laboratory values measured, including nephrotoxicity and hypokaliemia. In conclusion, low-dose Abelcet could be successfully used for antifungal prophylaxis in post transplant patients.",

Bertani, C. Gabutti, V. Mancini, M. Turrini, A. Brizio, E. Morra Ospedale Niguarda Ca' Granda Milano (Milan, IT) Introduction: Antifungal treatment is a main issue in haematological patients (pts) due to costs in terms of toxicity and economical resources. The reported incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFI) varies widely between BMT Units, due to the variability in isolation and other preventive procedures. These range from use of conventional rooms to highly protective environment as Laminar Air Flow (LAF) rooms which could be considered a real primary antifungal prophylaxis. Materials: In our BMT Unit all allogeneic transplant patients are managed in highly protective environment, usually LAF, with highly sterile nursing procedures and receive fl uconazole iv after transplant. Patients with previous possible, probable, or proven fungal infection receive appropriate secondary prophylaxis starting from aplasia. Empirical antifungal treatment is not routinely used. Galactomannan Antigenemia is periodically checked as chest X-ray. CT scan is evaluated only for selected cases to minimise patient contamination. We reviewed the 178 allogeneic transplants performed from January 1997 to December 2007 and evaluated the proportion of patients treated with prophylactic, empirical, or targeted therapy. Median age was 42 y (range: 17-65); stem cell source was unrelated donor in 58 pts; reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was used in 34 cases. GVHD prophylaxis: CSPA and short term MTX. No T-depletion or ATG have been used. Results: 34/178 patients (19%) received systemic anti-mould treatment. Of whom:",

Suh Asan Medical Center (Seoul, KR) Introduction: The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the effi cacy of antibiotic prophylaxis during autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Patients and Methods: We searched Asan Medical Center Registry for NHL and MM. Total 114 cases received antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of ciprofl oxacin (500mg twice daily p.o.), fl uconazole (100mg twice daily p.o.) and acyclovir (400mg every 8hr p.o.), starting 1 day before HDT (D -1), and continued until neutrophil engraftment: when the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reached \u2265 500/mm\u00b3 after nadir, or switching to intravenous (IV) broad spectrum antibiotics at the occurrence of signs of infection; while 118 cases did not receive antimicrobial prophylaxis during ASCT. Results: In prophylaxis group, 80 of 114 (70.2%) patients had experienced febrile episodes at median day +6 after transplantation with a statistically signifi cant difference (P<0.001). In no-prophylaxis group, 111 of 118 (94.1%) patients had experienced at median day +5. Documented infection occurred in 14 of 114 (12.3%) patients in prophylaxis group, and 16 of 118 (13.6%) patients in no-prophylaxis group (P=0.846). In these patients, the positive blood culture was seen in 12 (10.5%) of 114 patients in prophylaxis group, and 12 (10.7%) of 118 patients in no-prophylaxis group (P=1.000). Documented viral infection or reactivation was not observed in prophylaxis group, but observed in 4 patients of no-prophylaxis group. Both groups showed no invasive fungal infection or serious adverse event during ASCT. The day of infection resolved was a median day +15 (range, 3-29) in prophylaxis group and day +14 (range, in no-prophylaxis group (P=0.945). The duration of antimicrobial treatment was median 10 days both in prophylaxis group and in no-prophylaxis group (P=0.565). Conclusions: In our experience, the antimicrobial prophylaxis seems to decrease the incidence of febrile episodes during ASCT, but seems to have no benefi cial effect on reducing infectious complications. The antimicrobial prophylaxis of our study did not show the difference in the detection of causative organism as an infective agent, duration of antimicrobial therapy and hospitalization between two groups.",

Results: During the observation period 23 allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantations were performed in 19 patients. In case of enteral symptoms bacterial cultures, Clostridium diffi cile -toxin determinations and viral tests were performed to detect infectious origin. From the 8 symptomatic patients an underlying viral infection could only be identifi ed in 4 cases (2 rota-and 2 calicivirus). In the remaining 4 patients symptoms were related to graft versus host disease (GvHD), mucositis, CMV-colitis and malabsorption. The median observation time was 92 days (53-265). We experienced two major complications: one sepsis caused by an ESBL producing E. coli strain and one enteropathic acrodermatitis due to the excessive loss of zink.

Discussion: Rota-and calicivirus infections are a maior threat to this patient population, however, not much has been published on this issue in the transplant literature so far. The long-lasting damage of the intestinal barrier can facilitate bacterial invasion and can lead to sepsis. Patients may require very long hospital care for enteritis thus becoming candidates for further nosocomial infections. There is no antiinfective treatment for rota-and calicivirus but decreasing or, -if possible -, stopping immunosuppression can help. Conclusions: When evaluating patients presenting with enteritis after HSCT a rota-or calicivirus infection should always be considered. Transplant centers should be able to provide long hospital care for affected individuals. Ceasing immunosuppression can be benefi cial.",

Onida (2) , E. Tagliaferri (1) Hepatitis B (HBV) infection prevalence is frequently reported as increased among hematological patients. This enabled us to start reviewing HBV serology in our HSCT recipients. Moving back over the last four years we collected a series of 238 consecutive HSCT recipients (male 129, female 109, median age 50 years, range 18-70, autologous 151, allogeneic 87). The baseline diagnoses were lymphoma in 96, acute leukemia in 59, CLL and myeloproliferative disorder in six each, multiple myeloma in 47, PNH in 5 and autoimmune disease (AD) in 19 cases. Five patients were HBSAg positive, 54 had isolated anti-HBS antibodies (14 vaccinated), 38 were simultaneously anti-HBS and anti-HBC positive, and eight had anti-HBC without anti-HBS antibodies. Anti-hepatitis C (HCV) antibodies were observed in fi ve patients. As a whole, 91/224 not vaccinated patients (40.62%) showed some kind of HBV positivity. Of 19 patients with AD, three were vaccinated, three had isolated anti-HBS and one isolated anti anti-HBC positivity. Therefore, 87/208 not vaccinated neoplastic patients (41.82%) showed some kind of anti-HBV positivity, with 46/208 having anti-HBC antibodies without HBSAg positivity (22.11%). Even dividing the series by ten-year age cohorts, the prevalence of anti-HBC positivity was higher in comparison with the reference populations in European prevalence studies, showing median values below 10% and 16-17% in the worst age cohorts; no reliable comparisons are available for isolated anti-HBS positivity. Hematologic patients have an up to 40% rate of HBV positivity, including both HBSAg and anti-HBS/anti-HBC. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding is hindered by the quality of data in the reference populations, since prevalence study either report blood donors series, a somewhat selected population, or encompass relatively small series. The imbalance between general population and hematologic patients is a persistent fi nding over time, despite the evolving pattern of HBV diffusion and the increasing proportion of European population accounted for by people coming from countries at high HBV endemics. The contrast is somewhat surprising between the interest in the relationships between HCV and lymphomas, and the matter of HBV infection in hematology, mainly focusing on the prevention of HBV complications. The question may be raised as to whether HBV infection should also be considered as a risk factor in the development of hematologic neoplasms. . 17/27 episodes of CVC related infection occured in recipients of HSCT (10 autoSCT and 7 alloSCT) and 10 occured in patients after intensive treatment (acute leukemia=4, lym-phoma=5 and multiple myeloma=1). 60% of CRBI were due to gram-positive and 40% to gram-negative bacteria. In patients with clinical suspected CVC related infection, microorganisms isolated in blood cultures obtained from CVC were: bacillus cereus (n=3), enterococcus faecalis (n=2), pseudomona aeruginosa (n=2), staphilococcus aureus (n=2), staphilococcus epidermidis (n=1), serratia marcenses (n=1), stenotrophomona maltophilia (n=1), candida kruzei (n=1). All patients recieved empirical and specifi c antibiotic directed by the in vitro susceptibility of the isolated pathogen. Infectious events were solved in 9/10 patients. 16 catheters were removed. One patient with infection by candida kruzei died with systemic dissemination in spite of treating with properly antifungical drugs after 23 days from the infectious diagnosis. Conclusion: In this cohort, incidence of CRBI was 1,5 per 1000 catheter days in tunnelled CVC with a signifi cant predominance of gram-positives microorganisms. It was observed a higher incidence of systemic infection in Hickman CVC than in port devices. Global mortality was 1.7%, and 10% of CRBI. There is a need for further prospective studies to determinate more exactly the impact of the CVC infections in this kind of population.",

Al-Abdely, M. Aljurf King Faisal Specialist Hospital & R C (Riyadh, SA) Introduction: Cytomegalovirus(CMV) infection is one of the leading infectious complications post-allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) observed in 60%-70% of cases in the fi rst 3 months. CMV seropositivity in East Mediterranean and certain Asian countries reported to be close to a 100%, hence, the need for a successful pre-emptive treatment strategy that has low toxicity. Extended treatment with Ganciclovir has been shown to be associated with increase toxicity of late CMV infection and also may interfere with the anti-CMV T-cell specifi c immunity. Oral Valganciclovir(VGC) is monovalyl ester of Ganciclovir with highly improved bioavailability. Materials and Methods: We have treated 47 patients as outpatient follow-up after discharge with VGC 900mg BID for 1 week. Those who were antigenemia negative after one week, received 900mg daily (QD) for another week then treatment was discontinued. Those who were positive after one week, continued on BID schedule for another week and changed to QD schedule once they converted to antigenemia negativity. Those remained positive after 2 weeks of treatment, considered refractory and offered alternative treatment. Results: From 1/2004 to 12/2007 a total of 47 patients underwent HSCT received preemptive treatment with VGC. All donors and 44 of the recipients were seropositive for CMV. Donor source was: bone marrow in 30, peripheral blood in 13 and cord blood in 4 patients. Preparative regimens -Myeloablative in 33 and reduced intensity in 14 patients. Disease patternneoplastic in 34 and non-neoplastic in 13 patients. Twenty nine (65%) patients had graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) requiring steroid therapy; additional GVHD treatments were added in steroid refractory cases. Sixty one episodes of CMV infection (defi ned by positive antigenemia) were observed in the 47 patients. Antigenemia varied from 1 to 700 infected cells/slide. After fi rst week, complete response(CR) was observed in 92% episodes, 5% of the episodes required 2 weeks treatment to achieve CR and 3% episodes were refractory required alternative therapy. WBC count prior to therapy was 1.75 to 11.0X10 9 /L. G-CSF was required in 8 episodes ( range 1 to 5 doses). No patients had interruption of therapy. Conclusions: Treatment of CMV infection with \"short course oral Valganciclovir\" is highly effective with minimal toxicity, very convenient to the patient and has the potential to make a signifi cant saving in administrative and labor cost. Patients (pts) undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) require a reliable venous access. Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICC) offer certain advantages over other forms of long-term venous central access. They are inserted via peripheral veins such as cephalic, basilic or brachial vein without general anaesthetic or sedation and a surgical procedure is not required. The risk of pneumothorax and haemothorax from PICC insertion is minimal. They are also easy to remove and less expensive than central venous catheters. A total of 24 PICC lines (single-lumen silicone catheter with Groshong valve, 4 Frx60cm, 18Ga.lumen) were inserted between May and November 2008 by expert surgeon under ultrasound guidance bedside in 24 pts, undergoing high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous SCT for onco-haematological malignancies. Pts' characteristics were: M/F 15/8, median age 48 years (range 19-62). Underlying disease were: AML 2, MM 7, NHL 9, HD 3, POEMS 1 and germ cell tumours 2. Chest radiograph was routinely performed in all pts. At insertion pts' disconfort was minimal. No early complication as haematoma and pneumothorax were observed. PICCs were in place for an inclusive period of 468 days (median time 19 days, range 6-32). Three out 24 of PICCs (12.5%) were removed due to bad positioning and for this reason inserted again. Six out of 24 pts (25%) presented a transient malfunction during stem cell infusion because PICCs resulted not adequate despite the low hematocrit of stem cell product infused. No pts developed clinically evident catheter-relater thrombosis (CRT). Accidental removal of the catheter occurred only in one pt. Infections were the most relevant late complication. Two out of 24 pts presented a catheter related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) . In both cases cultures of blood and catheter samples documented a concordant growth of the same micro-organism, Staphylococcus Epidermidis. For this reason PICC was removed in one pts. The infection rate of 8% equates to 4.0 infections per 1000 PICCdays. Twenty of PICCs (83%) were removed due to completion of therapy, 1 PICC (4%) was removed for CRBSI, 1(4%) for fever of unknow origin (FUO) and 2 out 24 (8%) for other causes (accidental removal and malfunctioning). In our experience PICCs are associated with a rate of CRBSI similar to conventional central venous catheter but with a good pts' compliance and reduced risk for early complications. Introduction: The fever is a call symptom of making an infection during the chemotherapy (CT) induced neutropenia. The infections are mostly bacterial and fungal or due to Herpes virus. We estimate, in this study, the frequency and the mains causes of the febril episodes (FE) during myeloablative CT neutropenia induced in 762 patients (pts). Material and methods: from April 1998 to December 2006, 777 myeloablative stem cell tranplantation for hematologic disease were realized (allografts: 541, autografts: 236). Conditioning regimen or intensifi cation were based on CT only. In our study, 762 aplastic episodes after CT are observed (allograft: 533, autografts: 229) for 590 pts with hematologic malignant diseases and 172 pts with no malignant diseases; median age 31 years (3-65); sex ratio M/F 1,3. Infectious prophylaxis consisted of isolation of the pt (Flow laminar for allograft), a gut decontamination with sterile food, strict aseptia;Aciclovir and Fluconazole when mucositis mucosae. All FE are investigated clinically and by lung radiology, blood cultures (on peripheral blood and on central venous catheter), bacteriological study of the urines, stool parasitology, sampling according to the obvious home. The empirical anti-infectious treatment contained 4 lines which follow each other: Piperacilline-Netromycin; Fortum-Amikacin-Vancomycin; Tienam-Quinolon-Vancomycin; addition of an antifungal after 7 days of resistant fever to anti bacterial treatment. Results: all pts presented neutropenia grade 4 (OMS) with median duration 11 days . One thousand four hundred thirty one FE were observed in 759 pts (99,6%) with median episode/pt 1,9. Infectious clinically documented in 391 FE (27,3%) with several localizations (central venous catheter: 119, gut : 137, lung: 55, cutaneous 58, others: 32). Infectious microbiologically documented (which 131 with clinical localization) observed in 263 FE (18, 4%): blood cultures: 248, ECBU: 11, stool: 3, vaginal: 1; dominated by cocci gram + (n=185) and bacillus gram-(n=76), Candidose (n:2). The FE of unknown origin (FUO) represent around 63.5%. 237 pts (31%) required an anti infectious treatment beyond the second line. The mortality bound to an infectious cause is 4.7% (36 pts).

Methods: Cases of proven and probable CMV infection and disease diagnosed among 97 allogeneic SCT recipients at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden from January 1997 through December 2001 were included. Patient data were collected by retrospective clinical chart review. Results: CMV DNAemia was detected among 60 patients at a mean of 45 days after SCT. Three patients had proven CMV disease. Three additional patients had probable disease, but adequate laboratory samples were not taken. Two out of the 6 patients (one proven, one probable) died in severe CMV disease even though CMV was treated promptly. In one additional patient, CMV was considered to contribute to the patient's death. Direct CMV related mortality was 2%. Fifty patients (51%) were treated in a total of 93 treatment episodes, for proven or suspected CMV infection. Treatment was started at a mean of 104 days after transplantation and many patients developed repeated episodes of CMV reactivation. Our regimen of therapy was short (21 days). The overall one-year survival was 76% and the fi ve-year survival 56%. In our study, the CMV serology of donor and recipient and the conditioning regimens are related to CMV infection, CMV treatment, CMV disease and mortality. Risk factors independently associated with CMV morbidity and mortality includes positive serostatus for CMV of the recipients before SCT, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), cortisone treatment and older age. Receiving ganciclovir/foscarnet was independently associated with protection from CMV-related death. Conclusions: There has been a signifi cant decrease in morbidity and mortality in patients related to CMV disease following allogeneic SCT in the past ten years due to CMV surveillance and early antiviral treatment. Thus, only few patients develop CMV disease and a decreased number of cases with CMV viremia are observed.",

Oren (1) (1)Rambam Medical Center and Technion (Haifa, IL); (2)Rambam Medical Center (Haifa, IL) Background: Invasive fungal infections are a signifi cant cause of morbidity and mortality in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Predisposing factors include: prolonged neutropenia, mucositis, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prolonged immune suppression and steroid use. Zygomycosis is a rare infection with increasing frequency and a high fatality rate, affecting both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. An increase in zygomycosis infection among HSCT patients has been recently noted. Presented herein are our experience and possible explanations for the increased incidence of the infection. Patients and methods: Analysis of the prevalence of zygomycosis infection was performed between 09/2007 and 09/2008 at our department. During this period 50 new patients were treated for AML and 10 for ALL. 101 patients underwent stem cell transplantation (56 -auto and 45 allo). Antifungal prophylaxis consisted of fl uconazole. Voriconazole was given to patients with suspected or proven aspergillus infection. Results: During this period 6 (4%) patients with zygomycosis infection were identifi ed; 4 were diagnosed with AML, 1-ALL, 1-MDS. 5 were with relapsed or refractory disease and 1 in 3rd complete remission (CR). Median age was 29.5 years. 5 patients underwent previous SCT (2 allo, 1 haplo and 2 auto) and 3 patients had a 2nd transplant (2 haplo, 1 allo) following/ during diagnosis of zygomycosis. The infection involved lung -1, maxillary bone -2, mandibular bone -1, oral mucosa -1 and esophagus -1. Diagnosis was established by histology (5/6) and microbiology (6/6). Treatment was combined surgical and antifungal in 3/6. Posaconazole was given to 4 and isavuconazole to 2 patients. Three patients recovered from the infection and 3 died from progression of underlying diseases with evidence of controlled fungal infection. None of the patients died from progressive fungal infection. Retrospective analysis revealed antecedent neutropenia of > 2-week duration in 5 of 6, prolonged steroid use in 3 of 6 and prior use of voriconazole in 5 of 6 patients. Infection rate was 0.17% of 2904 treatment days versus 0.03% of 3319 treatment days on fl uconazole. In conclusion: Previous exposure to voriconazole may increase the incidence of the infection and should raise suspicion in the proper context. Use of new antifungal treatment with good antizygomycosis activity enables managing this serious infection even in the transplantation setting.",

Pavlov Medical University (St. Petersburg, RU) Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is a common cause of mortality in patients undergoing allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Aim: to evaluate the incidence of IFI, to determine risk factors of IFI and to study their infl uence to overall survival (OS) in patients (pts) undergoing allo-HSCT. Patients and methods: 221 pts. after allo-HSCT were included from 2000 till July 2008. Age:1-66 (median 21 y.o.). ALL, AML-150 pts, CML, CMF, CLL -27 pts, AA-11 pts, congenital disorders-8pts, NHL/HD-17pts, MDS-6pts, solid tumors-3pts underwent myeloablative conditioning -86pts and non-myeloablative conditioning (RIC) -135pts followed by alloHSCT. At the moment of alloHSCT 134 pts were in CR, 87 pts -in relapse. Donor: MRD-77pts, MUD-135pts, haploidentical-9pts. Sources of HSC:PBSC-142pts, BM-67pts, BM+PBSC-12pts. Median CD34\u00b1 8 x 10 6 /kg. Acute GVHD prophylaxis: CsA or tacrolimus and short course of MTX or MMF. Results: The incidence of IFI before D+100 was 27%, after D+100-36%. Possible invasive aspergillosis (IA) was detected in 27 pts, probable IA-34 pts, probable IA and Cryptococcosis-1pts, proven wasn't diagnosed, disseminated candidosis-2 pts(c. crusei-1 pts), candidemia with c. parapsilosis-2 pts The onset of IFI was on D+1-940 (median D+86). The incidence of IFI under prophylaxis by intraconasole was 21%(4/19), fl uconasole 31%(48/155), voriconasole 43%(16/37). In pts who received caspofungin(0/4), and caspofungin+posaconasole( 0/1) IFI wasn't detected. In multivariable analyses the following risk factors were revealed: age greater 10 years(RR=1.2; 95%CI, 1.01-1.6), usage of ATG in conditioning in pts up 21 yo (RR=0.7; 95% CI, 0,59-0,88, \u00d0<0,05), mucositis I-IV(RR=2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.8), chGVHD in patients under 21yo(RR= 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3 -3.4, \u00d0<0,05). Conditioning, time of engraftment, stage of the diseases and sources of HSC weren't independent risk factors for IFI. In pts under 21 years synergistic effect of following factors was detected: relapse, myeloablative conditioning, BM as source of HSC (RR=0.4; 95% CI, 0,21-0, 76, \u00d0<0,05). In pts up 21 years with MRD after RIC and source of HCS PBSC the incidence of IFI was lower (RR=1.59; 95% CI, 1.01 -2.51, \u00d0<0,05).

Liebersbach, G. Shenton, T. Collyns LTH NHS Trust (Leeds, UK) Patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoeitic stem cell transplantation at Leeds Teaching Hospitals (LTH) are regularly screened during their in-patient stay with weekly swabs of nose, mouth and perineum for the presence of certain antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Urine and faeces are also cultured and Hickman line exit sites are swabbed if clinically indicated. We analysed the results of these screens to assess their relevance in predicting any subsequent infections for each patient. We also looked for any organisms that represented a nosocomial infection transmission risk or required a change in the standard empirical treatment regime for febrile neutropenia at LTH (piperacillin-Tazobactam + an aminoglycoside). Between January 2007 and December 2007, 26 adult patients (age 18 -57 years) and 11 paediatric patients (age 6 months -16 years) underwent allogeneic haematopoeitic stem cell transplantation (19 peripheral blood stem cell, 14 bone marrow, 4 cord blood). Four adults and 2 paediatric patients had organisms identifi ed in screening samples that represented an infection control hazard: 2 patients (1 adult and 1 paediatric) had a Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolated in pre-transplant perineal swabs, 1 paediatric patient had a VRE in a perineal swab taken 24 days post-transplant, 2 patients had a ciprofl oxacin-resistant, aminoglycoside-resistant Escherichia coli (E Coli) in pre-transplant perineal swabs and 1 patient had a gentamicin-resistant, ciprofl oxacin-sensitive E coli present in a urine sample. None of these patients developed subsequent bacteraemias with the organism. Two patients developed bacteraemias with 'infection control hazard' organisms in the 4-month period post-transplantation, one with a gentamicin-resistant Enterobacter cloacae and one with an Extended-spectrum betalactamase-positive, gentamicin-resistant Klebsiella oxytoca, neither of which had been identifi ed on screening samples. These results suggest that screening samples have little predictive usefulness for the development of subsequent infections in this patient group.",

Duarte (1) Clinical effi cacy and total costs (including medical resource use and drugs) were assessed for 100 days post-alloSCT, our defi ned antifungal prophylaxis period. Unit costs were obtained from the Hospital Pharmacy and the Soikos database, and are expressed in Euros 2008. More patients in the POSA group were T-cell depleted (10 vs 0; p<.01), had a reduced intensity conditioning (19 vs 6; p=.03), and an unrelated donor graft (10 vs 2; p=.08). Otherwise, age (52, 20-68), sex (58% men), disease (30 MDS-AML, 6 lymphoid, 4 CML, 3 ALL), days to neutrophil engraftment (17, , and incidence of acute GVHD (30.2%) were similar in both groups. ITRA patients received oral suspension or IV drug based on their tolerance. POSA patients had no problems with oral compliance or toxicity. Patients in the POSA group had a lower incidence of proven or probable IFI (0 vs 13%; p=.06), a higher probability of IFI-free survival (85% vs 56%; p=.01) and a trend towards an improved overall survival (85% vs 63%; p=.09) compared with ITRA patients. Total cost per patient up to day +100 were \u20ac46,562 in the POSA group (3% conditioning costs, 67% hospitalization and laboratory tests costs, 20% antifungal drug costs and 10% other drug costs) and \u20ac45,079 in the ITRA group (6% conditioning costs, 73% hospitalization and laboratory tests costs, 11% antifungal drug costs and 10% other drug costs). Incremental cost-effectiveness of POSA vs ITRA per IFI avoided was \u20ac11.858. In conclusion, our experience shows that in addition to neutropenia and GVHD, as established by the registration trials, POSA may be superior to ITRA as primary antifungal prophylaxis during the early high-risk neutropenic period after alloSCT in terms of clinical effi cacy and cost-effectiveness. In the absence of randomized trials with POSA in this indication, our single-centre study provides supporting evidence for the use of POSA for antifungal prophylaxis in this important clinical setting. T. gondii is obligate intracellular parasite causing infection known as toxoplasmosis. In immunocompetent host it causes an asymptomatic infection or fever with lymphadenopathy. Primary infection leads to latency and development of tissue cysts in muscles and other organs. Most frequently, humans become infected by ingesting meal contaminated with oocysts from infected cat faeces. The other ways are transplacentar transmission or via infected blood products or hematopoietic stem cells from donor with primary infection (seroprevalence of IgM antibodies). T. gondii causes an infection with fulminant course or end organ disease (central nervous system, lungs, liver or myocard) in immunocompromised host. Encephalitis is the most common manifestation of toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patient. Typical symptoms are fever, coma and general seizures based on necroses fi lled with tissue cysts in central nervous system. Mortality in immunocompromised patients is 60 -90%. High mortality is caused by non-specifi c clinical signs leading to late diagnosis assessment. Although toxoplasmosis is common in patients with advanced AIDS, in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients it is rare but often fatal complication. Serological positivity of T. gondii in allogeneic HSCT is routinely tested in donor only. In our department we have observed IgM seropositivity in 3 patients and 1 donor pre-HSCT. RT-PCR was performed in all cases. RT-PCR provides specifi c evidence of tachyzoites in examined material such as peripheral blood or stem cell graft. Detection limit of RT-PCR is 30 tachyzoites/ 1mL, sensitivity 30% and specifi city over 90%. Preventive administration of clindamycine was provided in all patients during neutropenia and after engraftment patients received TMP/SMZ three days a week in a long term. We have not seen the reactivation of T. gondii in our cohort yet. Median follow up is 34.5 months (3-67 months). All patients are alive.",

Wierzbowska, A. Szmigielska-Kaplon, A. Pluta, T. Robak Medical University of Lodz (Lodz, PL) Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of fl uoroquinolone prophylaxis for patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT). Methods: We analysed the data of 104 patients transplanted at the Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz between January 2002 and October 2008. The cohort was divided into two subgroups, depending on the administered ciprofl oxacine prophylaxis (50 patients in the prophylaxis group and 54 in the no-prophylaxis group). The groups did not differ signifi cantly in terms of age, gender and conditioning regimens. Multiple myeloma prevailed as an indication for autoSCT in the ciprofl oxacine treated (30 cases), as well as in the no-prophylaxis group (28 cases), and other diagnoses included Hodgkin lymphoma (13 and 16 cases respectively), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (2 and 6 cases respectively), acute myeloid leukemia (4 and 3 cases respectively) and multiple sclerosis (2 cases in total). Results: Ciprofl oxacine prophylaxis resulted in a statistically signifi cant reduction in the number of days intravenous antibiotics were administered to patients in the group with prophylaxis (p<0,01). A trend was observed towards a lower prevalence of days with fever related to infection in the prophylaxis group. Other correlations, e.g. the number of days with fever in total, the number of days with neutropenic fever, the percentage of patients receiving granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and the number of G-SCF doses were insignifi cant, probably due to the low number of cases in the study groups. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that ciprofl oxacin prophylaxis is benefi cial for patients treated with autoSCT following a high dose chemotherapy regimen, in terms of minimising both the duration of the hospital stay, and intravenous antibiotics usage. Moreover, this clearly translates into an economic advantage.",

Bauernschmitt, T. Szislo, C. Peschel, H. Menzel Klinikum rechts der Isar (Munich, DE) Background: Antimicrobial prophylaxis with ciprofl oxacin (cipro) is used for patients (pat.) at high risk for neutropenic fever after chemotherapy. 2005 Bucaneve et al. published data about the use of levofl oxacin (levo) vs. placebo to prevent bacterial infection in pat. with cancer and neutropenia, concluding that levo is effective in preventing febrile episodes, lowers the rate of microbiologically documented infections (MDI) and bacteraemia. To compare these data with the standard use of cipro we have already re-evaluated the data of pat. with AML and with lymphoma/solid tumours receiving HD-CTx and auto-SCT. Now we add the data of pat. with Multiple Myeloma (MM). Methods: We analyzed 100 cycles of HD-Melphalan (HD-Mel) and auto-SCT in 69 pat. with MM who were at risk for prolonged neutropenia. In 38 pat. one cycle and in 31 pat. 2 cycles of HD-Mel. were analyzed. Pat. after allogeneic SCT, fever before start of conditioning, antimicrobial therapy or documented infections were excluded. Prophylaxis consisted of 500 mg cipro orally TID until the development of fever or until neutropenia resolved. Following the IDSA -guidelines we analyzed the reason of fever and classifi ed pat. with fever of unknown origin (FUO), and clinically (CDI) or microbiologically documented infections (MDI). Results: The mean duration of cipro application was 13d. The mean age of the MM pat. was 58y. All pat. had a CVL. The mean duration of leukopenia <1G/l was 7d (AML: 16d, Lymphoma/solid tumours: 8d). The incidence of fever in neutropenia was 62% after the 1st cycle. After the 2nd cycle febrile neutropenia occurred in 77% (all cycles: 67%). In AML-pat. the incidence of fever was 93%, and in lymphoma/solid tumours 75%. Of the 67 febrile episodes after 100 cycles of HD-Mel 58% were FUO, 4% CDI and 39% MDI. 25% of the MDI were central venous line (CVL) infections and 38% were bacteraemia. In only 2/100 cycles HD-Mel. we documented gram-bacteraemia. The TRM at d+30 was 0% in MM and 1% in AML/Lymphoma/ solid tumours. Conclusions: The lower incidence of neutropenic fever in MMpat. refl ects the duration of neutropenia in the different groups. In MM pat. the incidence of fever rised with the 2nd cycle. Compared with the levo-data (neutropenic fever: 67% in AML, 62% in lymphoma/solid tumours) results with cipro seem to be unfavourable -but the low incidence of gram-bacteraemia with cipro (3/200 cycles) and the low mortality (1/200 cycles) is not prompting us to change to levo.",

            "text": "Patients and Methods: Patients with B-CLL who received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from a matched sibling or unrelated donor between 2001 and 2008 were eligible. Only patients with cyclosporine-based GVHD prophylaxis were selected, whereas patients with ex vivo TCD were excluded. The outcome of three major groups of patients was compared: those who were transplanted without TCD, those who received anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or alemtuzumab (CAM). Baseline and follow-up data were downloaded from the EBMT database. Results: 413 patients were eligible. At HCT 64% of the patients were in complete or partial remission. Donors were HLA-identical siblings in 74% and matched unrelated donors in 26% of the patients. 82% of patients had been treated with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen. No TCD was applied in 57% of the patients while 19% received ATG and 24% CAM. The median follow-up of living patients was 22 months (1 to 92). For the whole cohort of patients 4-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 57% (95% CI, 50% to 57%) and 44% (95% CI, 37% to 51%). The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD II-IV was 36% without TCD, 28% with ATG and 24% with CAM (gray test, p=0.13). Patients without TCD received less frequently DLI with a 4-year cumulative chance of 13% compared to 24% with ATG and 32% with CAM (p=0.03). At four years the incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was reported to be 44%, 34% and 31% (p=0.09), respectively. The relapse incidences at 4 years were 28%, 26% and 31% (p=0.44), respectively. Acute GVHD II-IV or chronic GVHD had a protective effect against relapse (RR 0.6, p=0.01). 4-year OS and PFS was 59% and 46% without TCD, 51% and 42% with ATG and 58% and 42% with CAM (p= 0.28 and p=0.21). In multivariate analysis TCD did not impact on OS or PFS, while important predictors were remission status at HCT and age. Conclusion: In patients with CLL the combination of in vivo TCD and DLI appears to result in comparable rates of extensive chronic GVHD, OS and PFS compared to T-cell replete HCT. Even after the introduction of imatinib, the calculation of the Sokal and the Euro prognostic scores has remained essential in clinical practice, since allow to stratify CML pts at different evolutive risk at diagnosis, guiding therapeutic decisions and upfront search for an allo-BMT donor. Here we reported GEP experiments aimed at the identifi cation of genes and able to predict the disease course of CP-CML pts at the onset of the disease were performed on highly enriched CD34+ cells from 27 pts with untreated CML in CP by Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 platform. In the initial part of the study, the fi rst 14 CML pts (the \"training set\") were successfully assayed for global GEP and microarray data were used to defi ne genes differentially expressed in high (6 pts) vs. low (8 pts) Sokal risk pts, thus identifying 89 probes set; clustering of their GEP showed an homogeneous pattern in high Sokal risk pts, where up-regulated genes are mainly related to the positive regulation of immune response and to the induction of apoptosis, whereas down-regulated genes are mainly involved in the negative regulation of metabolic processes. Of note, among the most signifi cantly up-regulated genes is ABCC4, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter and among the most signifi cantly down-regulated genes is PLCB1, which we recently described as being deleted in myelodysplastic syndromes and in myeloid acute leukemia. In the second part of the study, the 89 probes set differentially expressed in the training set were tested on an independent test set of 13 CML pts, including 4 high, 4 intermediate and 5 low Sokal risk pts. The test set GEP clustering displayed the same trend observed in the training set and, while low and intermediate risk pts resulted quite scattered, high risk pts clustered together. Overall, our data suggests that the expression at diagnosis of a particular array of genes might drive the evolutive risk of CML pts.

            "text": "Apoptosis induction by treosulfan is superior to busulfan in risk-defi ned human CLL cells V. Ristovska (1) , N. Wagner (1) Introduction: The conditioning regimen used prior to alloSCT infl uences the clinical outcome since it adds to toxicity/mortality and affects relapse rates and incidence of GvHD. Alkylating agents are used as part of the conditioning regimen in pts with CLL. While cyclophosphamide possesses a well defi ned activity profi le, the benefi t of administering busulfan to CLL patients is unclear since its cytostatic potential has not been evaluated in comparison to other alkylating agents. Treosulfan is a watersoluble alkylating agent which offers suffi cient stem cell toxicity, a favourable safety profi le and is increasingly used prior to allo-SCT. This analysis was performed in order to compare the cytotoxic potential of busulfan (B) and treosulfan (T) in the induction of apoptosis in cytogenetically-defi ned human CLL cells. Methods: PBMCs from 25 pts with the diagnosis of CLL, a WBC > 30 G/l and defi ned cytogenetic risk (5 x del 17p-, 5 x del 11q-, 5 x trisomy +12, 5 x del 13q-, 5 x no aberration) were cultured in the presence of IL-4/CD40L. Apoptosis was induced by the addition of busulfan (B, 3-100\u00b5M), treosulfan (T, 3-100\u00b5M), 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-hpC, 5-80\u00b5M), fl udarabine (F, 5-50\u00b5M) or cytarabine (Ara-C, 5-10\u00b5M). Rates of apoptosis were determined using annexinV/PI staining and caspase-3 production after 24 and 48 hs. Results: In the entire cohort as well as in cytogenetic subgroups, B induced apoptosis of CLL cells only to a minimal extent (< 5% at 24h, < 10% at 48 h). In contrast, T, 4-hpC, F and AraC were potent inducers of apoptosis and induced cell death via caspase-activation. The effi cacy of T was comparable to that of F. The relevance of cytogenetic aberrations was clearly evident since apoptosis induction was greatest in subgroups with favorable prognosis (no aberration, 13q-) and reduced in subgroups with unfavorable prognosis with 17p-being the most drug-resistant aberration (rate of apoptosis +12 > 11q-> 17p-). The combination of T with F or 4-hpC resulted only in limited additive effects. Results of additional in vivo-experiments in mouse xenograft models will be presented. Conclusions: Our work identifi es treosulfan as an alkylating agent with effi cient cytotoxic potential in human CLL. Since induction of cell death by busulfan appears to be minimal and given the suitability of treosulfan in alloSCT, the use of treosulfan instead of busulfan may be considered to improve the effi cacy of conditioning therapy prior to alloSCT in CLL pts.",

Lissandre (1) Aim of the study: To describe the outcome of pts who underwent HSCT from 1994 to 2008 in 4 hematological French centers. Method: 32 pts with MF were identifi ed. Overall survival (OS) and relapse free survival (RFS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) with relapse as a competing event. Patient and disease characteristics: Median age of pts at time of HSCT was 49 years (15-65). Twenty-seven pts had primary MF whereas 12 patients had MF secondary to polycythemia vera (PV) (n=7) or to essential thrombocythemia (ET) (n= 5). Among 25 pts with a cytogenetic analysis, 12 had clonal abnormalities. A JAK2 mutation was detected in 6 out of 22 tested patients. Treatment before transplantation mainly consisted of hydroxyurea or busulfan (26 pts). Before HSCT, 12 pts required platelet transfusions and 19 required blood transfusions. Twenty-three pts experienced a splenectomy. Ten patients were transformed in AML before HSCT. Dupriez score was low in 9, intermediate in 16 and high in 14 pts at time of transplantation. Results: 25 pts received a HSCT from an HLA-identical sibling and all pts were transplanted with an HLA matched donor. Fifteen pts received a myeloablative conditioning regimen (MAC) and 24 received a fl udarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC). Graft-versus-Host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine plus mycophenolate in 21, cyclosporine plus methotrexate in 13 and cyclosporine alone in 5 pts. All but one pts engrafted in median 15 days (range:0-129) after transplantation. Thirty-one pts developed grade I-IV acute GVHD. Among 35 evaluable pts, 18 developed a chronic GVHD. Median time to discharge was shorter with RIC regimen (23 days) than with MAC regimen (46 days). Three-year OS was 61% (95%Confi dence Interval (CI): 47-80). 3-year RFS was 55% (41-75). 3-year NRM was similar with RIC or MAC (32% vs. 20%). Splenectomy, age, sex mismatch, conditioning regimen (RIC vs MAC), Dupriez score and transformation into AML had no impact on outcome. Patients who received platelet transfusions before HSCT or who was CMV+ had signifi cant poorer OS. Conclusion: In these high risk MF pts, median OS after HSCT is much better than reported with alternative treatment. The main risk factor for poor outcome is thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion before transplantation whereas other usual risk factors have no more impact after HSCT.",

Results: Patients were treated with second generation TKIs for 1 to 17 months (median, 8): all patients but one achieved a complete hematologic response (CHR); 6 patients obtained also a Major Cytogenetic Response, which was complete (CCgR) in 3 patients. Donors were HLA-matched related in 4 cases and unrelated in 8 cases. Stem cell source was peripheral blood, bone marrow or cord blood in 6, 5 and 1 cases, respectively. Conditioning regimen was full for all patients. All patients engrafted successfully: median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 21 days (range, 11-41) and 22 days (range, 14-86), respectively. All patients but one achieved a full donor chimerism. Best response to allo-HSCT was Complete Molecular Response (CMR) in 9 patients, Major Molecular Response (MMR) in 1 patient and CCgR in 2 patients. Four patients relapsed: one patient at a molecular level, one patient at a cytogenetic level and two patients had a hematological relapse (sudden blast crisis). The patient who presented a molecular relapse recovered a molecular negativity after discontinuation of the immunosuppressive therapy, whereas the patient who experienced a cytogenetic relapse became RT-PCR negative after Donor Lymphocytes infusions. At last contact, 9 patients were in continuous CMR and 1 patient in MMR; 2 patients died of disease progression. Median overall survival was 16.5 months. Conclusions: Our report confi rms that second-generation TKIs before allo-HSCT does not negatively affect transplant engraftment and response rate, nor increases transplantrelated toxicity.

Br\u00fcmmendorf, P. Schafhausen, N. Kr\u00f6ger, C. Bokemeyer, D. Atanackovic University Medical Center Hamburg (Hamburg, DE) Background: Expression of cancer-testis (CT) antigens is characteristically restricted to cancer and the human germline and their distinctive immunogenicity renders them potential targets in immunotherapeutic settings. In order to identify such targets in CML, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the expression and immunogenicity of CT antigens in cell lines and patients with CML. Methods: 10 CML cell lines and bone marrow (BM) samples from 10 healthy donors were screened by RT-PCR for the expression of 30 CT antigens. RNA levels of PRAME were also evaluated in 20 healthy tissues by quantitative RT-PCR. Cell lines were analyzed before and after stimulation with 5'-Aza-2'-Deoxcytidine and Trichostatine. Expression of 15 selected CT antigens was then analyzed in BM and peripheral blood (PBL) samples from 84 patients with CML by RT-PCR. Protein expression was confi rmed by Western Blot for 10 CT antigens. Sera of 45 patients with CML were screened for antibodies against 15 CT antigens by ELISA. Results: RT-PCR showed expression of CABYR, CT45, DKK1, HAGE, KM-HN-1, MPHOSPH1, PASD1, PBK and SP17 in BM samples from healthy donors. 16 of the remaining 21 antigens were expressed in at least one untreated cell line and treatment with 5'-Aza-2'-Deoxycytidine led to a two-fold increase in the average number of antigens expressed per cell line. Treatment with Trichostatine had a less pronounced effect. Analyzing patient samples, PRAME was found in 32.1% and expression correlated with stage of disease (p=0.02), blast cell count (r=0.38; p=0.01), and reduced overall survival (p=0.021). Sporadic expression was only detected for BAGE2 (N=2) and SLLP1 (N=1). Importantly, among 20 healthy tissues PRAME was indeed characteristically restricted to germ-line tissues. While none of the patients showed PRAME-specifi c serological immune responses, one patient who had not expressed NY-ESO-1 showed a signifi cant antibody response against this antigen. Conclusions: CT antigens are frequently expressed in CML cell lines and expression can be increased by application of demethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Most frequently detected in patient samples was PRAME, the expression of which correlated signifi cantly with multiple clinicopathological parameters. One patient who had not expressed NY-ESO-1 showed an antibody response against this antigen, possibly indicating spontaneous immunity leading to the eradication of CML clones expressing this antigen in vivo.",

Kr\u00f6ger University Cancer Center, Hamburg (Hamburg, DE) Therapeutic options for patients with osteomyelofi brosis whose disease has relapsed after a prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) include donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or a second transplant. There are no large studies addressing the safety and effi cacy of a second allo-SCT for relapsed disease. We report our experience with a second allo-SCT being performed in fi ve patients with relapse of osteomyelofi brosis after the fi rst allo-SCT and who failed to DLI. There were three males and two females (median age 58 years; range, 49 -64). First transplantation had been performed in all cases by a reduced conditioning regimen based on a combination by busulfan (cumulative dose 10mg/kg) and fl udarabine (cumulative dose 180 mg/kg). The maximal response after the fi rst allo-SCT was complete remission (CR) in two patients and partial remission (PR) in three patients. All patients received DLI at 1-4 time points in median dose 2.2x10 7 /kg (range, 1x10 6 -1x10 8 /kg) due to clinical relapse after the fi rst allo-SCT. The best response after the DLI according to IWG-MRT criteria was stable disease (SD) in three patients, clinical improvement (CI) in one patient, while the fi fth patient showed progressive disease (PD). The median interval between the fi rst and second allo-SCT was 17 months (range, 11 -25). Second allo-SCT was prepared in all patients with a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen consisting of a combination of fl udarabine (median cumulative dose 5x30mg/kg), and treosulfan (3x12mg/kg). All patients received peripheral blood stem cells (median cell dose 8.3 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg bw, range, 5.4 -11.1) from HLAmatched unrelated donors. All patients successfully achieved engraftment; median leukocyte engraftment was observed on day +16 (range, 10 -20) after second allo-SCT. Acute graftversus-host disease (aGvHD) grade II-IV was observed in two patients. Three patients (60%) are alive, 4, 7, and 25 months from second allo-SCT in complete remission (CR) according to IWG-MRT criteria, including molecular remission. Two patients (40%) achieved PR and SD but relapsed and died 11 and 15 months from the second allo-SCT. In conclusion, the use of a second allo-SCT, based on a combination of fl udarabine and treosulfan is a effective and well tolerated approach for the patients, who failed to DLI after fi rst allo-SCT.",

Papayannidis (1) Background: MK-0457 is a pan-aurora kinase inhibitor with demonstrated activity against wild-type and mutated BCR-ABL, including the T315I form, as well as FLT3 and JAK-2. It is a promising molecule for the management of Ph+ leukemias, in which the emergence of mutations in the ABL kinase domain still represents the main mechanism of resistance to TK inhibitors. Aim: We conducted an innovative and proof of concept Phase I clinical study of sequential and concomitant treatment with Dasatinib, previously administered for three months, and MK-0457. This combined activity suggests that MK-0457, in association with Dasatinib, would suppress the emergence of T315I and other resistant clone, improving upon the response rate for Dasatinib and the durability of response. The trial investigated two schedules of therapy: patients who achieved and maintained a major hematologic response (MHR) after three months of therapy with Dasatinib (70 mg twice daily) received a 6-hour biweekly infusion of MK-0457 at 64 mg/m\u00b2/hr, whereas patients who failed to achieve a MHR received a 5-days continuous infusion of MK-0457 at 10 mg/m\u00b2/hr, every 4 weeks. Results: Two patients with Ph+ ALL and one patient with CML in myeloid blast crisis, previously unsuccessfully treated with imatinib, were enrolled in the protocol. The fi rst two patients, both in hematologic response after three months of treatment with Dasatinib, subsequently received the 6-hour biweekly schedule, maintaining the haematological response. No haematological toxicity was described. The third patient, enrolled in progression disease, received the 5 days MK-0457 schedule of treatment. His peripheral blood count was consistent with a severe pancytopenia, which required frequent platelets and red blood cells transfusions. His bad clinical performance status was compromised by a severe hemorrhagic pleural effusion, responsible for moderate dyspnoea and severe asthenia.

            "text": "Introduction: Allogeneic SCT has become an important treatment modality for patients with high risk leukemia and is also increasingly used in the treatment of children and adolescents with solid malignancies. Nevertheless, relapse remains the major cause for treatment failure. Immunotherapeutic treatment approaches targeting tumor antigens might help to prevent relapse. A possible tumor antigen is the Wilms tumor antigen WT1 which is over expressed in various leukemias and solid tumors. Cytotoxic T-cell responses have been detected in leukemia patients. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility to generate WT1-specifi c T cells from healthy donors which is a pre-requisite for an application as adoptive immunotherapy in the transplantation setting. Methods: Peripheral CD8+ cells were stimulated by autologous WT1 peptide-pulsed antigen presenting cells. Peptide-specifi c T-cell clones were generated by limiting dilution assay. Peptide recognition and cytotoxicity were tested in Interferon-g Elispot and Europium-release assays. Results: WT1 peptide-specifi c T cells could be found in 9 out of 10 healthy HLA-A2+ volunteers. T-cell clones specifi c for two WT1-derived peptide epitopes (WT1 p37-45: VLDFAPPGA, WT1 p126-134: RMFPNAPYL) could be generated. Effi cacy of in vitro generated T-cell clones to recognize and lyse peptide-pulsed tumor cell lines as well as endogenously WT1expressing tumor cell lines Rh1 and MDA-MB-231 was demonstrated. Thereby, blocking with HLA class I and CD8 antibodies inhibited lytic activity and peptide recognition. Peptide dose titration demonstrated the ability of T-cell clones to recognize even low nM peptide concentrations. No allo-reactive effects against HLA-different PBMCs or HLA-A2+ CD34+ peripheral stem cells could be observed. In vitro generated WT1-specifi c T-cell clones were CD8+/CD45R0+/CD45RA-/CCR7-effector-memory T cells with a purity of over 95% WT1-tetramer positive cells. Conclusion: We could demonstrate that the generation and in vitro expansion of functionally active WT1-specifi c T cells from peripheral blood of healthy HLA-A2+ volunteer donors is feasible. These in vitro expanded effector cells displayed a peptide-specifi c cytotoxicity against WT1-expressing solid tumor cell lines.",

Supported by \"Patenschaftsmodell\" of Goethe University Frankfurt (GW). Donor T cells administered by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) for the treatment of relapsed leukemia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) mediate graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) reactivity as well as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Since HLA-class II molecules are predominantly expressed on hematopoietic cells, adoptive transfer of donor CD4+ T cells may selectively mediate GvL reactivity without GvHD. This is supported by clinical studies with CD8+ T cell-depleted DLI, but it remains unknown whether GvL reactivity and remaining GvHD observed in these patients is mediated by CD4+ T cells or by contaminating or residual CD8+ T cells. We assessed the capacity of highly purifi ed CD4+ T cells to exert GvL reactivity in a NOD/Scid mouse model for human acute leukemia. Mice inoculated with primary human acute lymphoblastic leukemic cells from different patients were treated with purifi ed human CD4+ DLI (consisting of CD4+ T cells) or CD3+ DLI (consisting of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) from different donors. In mice treated with CD4+ DLI, the expansion of activated CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood coincided with disappearance of leukemic cells, showing similar kinetics as for CD3+ DLI. In the presence of these activated T cells after treatment with CD4+ DLI, the leukemic cells acquired in vivo an antigen presenting cell (APC) phenotype, characterized by upregulation of HLA-class II, adhesion and costimulatory molecules, whereas leukemic cells from untreated mice remained unchanged. The specifi city of the GvL effect of CD4+ DLI was investigated by clonal isolation of CD4+ T cells, showing that anti-tumor immunity was mediated by a polyclonal response comprising T-helper and T-effector cells directed against the mismatched HLA class II molecules of the patient. The data showed that 84% of isolated CD4+ T cell clones were reactive against leukemic cells that were in vitro modifi ed into leukemic APC, whereas only 28% of the clones also directly recognized unmodifi ed leukemic cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that crosstalk between leukemic cells and specifi c CD4+ T cells is the fundamental basis for induction of leukemic cells with APC phenotype and effi cient anti-tumor immunity. In conclusion, our data illustrate that CD4+ T cells can be potent effector cells and sole mediators of anti-tumor immunity, thereby emphasizing the clinical relevance of CD4+ T cell based immunotherapies after alloSCT. Conversion of leukemic cells to leukemia-derived DC (DCleu) improves antigenpresentation and generation of leukemia-specifi c S264 ACTR. We studied the role of the composition/quality of DC and (DC-primed) Tcells, chemokines/cytokines in the mediation of leukemia-cytotoxic reactions ex vivo or to predict the response to DC/DLIbased immunotherapy in vivo. 1) We generated DC/mature DC/DCleu from 30 AML/MDS pts (on average 23/43%/66%) and primed Tcells (in 17 cases) with DC or blasts in MLC. 2) After DCpriming on average 47% of Tcell-cases gained an ACTR, but only 23% after blast-priming.",

Pts presenting with a relapse after SCT showed better ex vivo convertibility of blasts to DCleu if they had responded to a GMCSF/DLI based therapy of their relapse after SCT compared to pts with no response (72 vs 36% blasts convertible to DCleu; 44vs 29% generable DC). Moreover we found, that cases with more vs less than 60% blasts convertible to DCleu the overall survival from SCT to endpoint was 612 vs 168 days. 7) Spectratyping of the VbetaTCR region in an AML pt reveiled a more extended clonal restriction of donor Tcells after DCpriming of Tcells compared to blast-primed Tcells and the restricted pattern was also found in Tcells from the pt after SCT. Sum:DC/DCleu can be generated in any given pt independent from karyotype. DCpriming of Tcells improves the antileukaemic CTL, but can also mediate Tcell anergy. The composition of DC/ Tcells/culture supernatants is predictive for the lytic effi ciency of primed Tcells and the patients' response to therapy. Tcell clones are enriched after DC-compared to blast priming and are found in vivo selected Tcells. We contribute to understand cytotoxic/ escape mechanisms and detect pts qualifying for DCbased immunotherapies. Possibly DCprimed, specifi c Tcells could be generated in vivo or selected from ex vivo cultures and transferred to pts in therapeutic or prophylactic settings.",

Expression of KIR2DL2-3 in subsequent timepoints was 14.4%,20%,19.6%,20.9%, and 25.4%, compared to 24.5% in donors (p<0,05 up to day +100).

The expression of NKG2A on day +28 equaled 89.9% and decreased to 79%, 68.9%,64% and 51.9% (up to day +180, p<0.05 compared to 46.8% in donors). At all time-points DI was signifi cantly lower compared to the initial donor-recipient phenotypic difference. Median DI continuously decreased from 5.9 on day +28 to 4.1 on day +365. The use of steroids was associated with higher DI and the effect was signifi cant on days +56 (p=0.01), and +100 (p=0.04). Up to day +100, DI correlated adversely with the absolute number of circulating T, Th, and Tc cells. Other factors including T-cells in the graft, source of stem cells, donor type, GVHD had no impact on DI. We conclude that: 1) acquisition of KIRs by NK cells after alloHSCT is sequential and starts with KIR3DL1, followed by KIR2DL2-3 and KIR2DL1; 2) NKG2A is overexpressed within 6 months after transplantation; 3) NK cell phenotypic pattern tends to recapitulate the donor type; 4) Phenotypic maturation is disturbed by the use of steroids; 5) T-cell recovery occurs in parallel to NK cell maturation. Our observations should be taken into account when trying to predict potential benefi t from NK cell alloreactivity. Animal models have demonstrated that the serum peak concentration of activating cytokines and hematopoietic growth factors is reached 48 hours after a chemotherapeutic treatment. We hypothesized that patients affected by resistant diseases who have already undergone an allogeneic SCT may benefi t from adoptive cell transfer performed after chemotherapy. Four high risk patients affected by AML evolved from a MDS, who already presented a disease recurrence after an allogeneic SCT (1 from haplo, 1 from MUD and 2 from siblings), completed 2 cycles of DLI (CD3 = 1x10 7 /Kg of recipient BW for haplo and MUD, and 1x10 8 /Kg for sibling) performed 2 days after a lymphodepleting chemotherapeutic treatment. These patients underwent cytofl uorimetric analysis of the PB for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD16, CD56, CD20, CD7, CD38, HLA-DR and intracytoplasmic staining for IFNg, TNFa, IL-2, IL-10 at days 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 from DLI; two patients who underwent 2 cycles of standard DLI served as controls. The results demonstrated that from day 2 throughout the entire study period, patients who received DLI after chemotherapy showed an increased presence of reactive elements, as documented by lymphocytes expressing the CD7/CD38/HLA-DR profi le when compared to controls (p 0.0001). The difference reached its maximum at day 5 (mean %\u00b1S.D. 40\u00b121 vs 8\u00b13; p 0.02). The production of IFNg was also superior in patients from the study group (p 0.01), achieving the peak at day 10 (mean %\u00b1S.D. 36\u00b111 vs 16\u00b1-4; p 0.01). Three of the 4 patients from the study group presented for the fi rst time a clinical picture of GVHD in association with the chemo-immunotherapeutic treatment (despite having previously undergone many cycles of standard DLI); in these 3 patients, the onset of GVHD was associated with an hematologic CR.",

These observations suggest that donor lymphocytes may undergo a process of activation when infused into patients who have received a chemotherapy in the last 2 days and advocate a possible new chemo-immonotherapeutic schedule that can be taken into consideration in the case of resistant/residual diseases for patients who have undergone an allogeneic SCT.",

Salmon, L. Clement, P. Bordigoni, J.F. Stoltz, D. Bensoussan CHU Nancy (Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, FR) Adenovirus (ADV) infections represent one of the major cause of morbidity and mortality following Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The incidence of ADV infections ranges between 5 to 30%, with paediatric recipients showing the highest rate of infection. The mortality rate is very high in those patients: 60 to 73%, despite new antiviral treatment strategies. Actually, it has been demonstrated that a suffi cient host T-cell response is essential to clear the virus. We describe here a complete clinical grade generation of Human anti-Adenovirus cytotoxic T cells in order to propose an adoptive immunotherapy to the recipient. Healthy donor mononuclear cells (PBMC), known for their good cellular immunity against ADV, are stimulated during 6 hours with the Peptivator-ADV5 (Miltenyi Biotec) which is a synthetic peptide pool covering the ADV5 Hexon protein. Gamma Interferon (IFN\u0192\u00d7) secreting cells are isolated on the CliniMACS device using the Cytokine Capture System (Miltenyi Biotec) (Feuchtinger et al, 2007) . The results of 4 immunomagnetic selections are presented in the table below: Isolated T lymphocytes (CTL) are cultured with IL2 and autologous feeder cells (irradiated cells from the negative fraction) in order to perform the functional quality controls. We fi rst controlled the ability of the amplifi ed CTL to secrete IFN\u0192\u00d7 when restimulated with the Peptivator ADV. A cytotocity of 40% against autologous dendritic cells (DC) as target cells (10/1) loaded with ADV5 or ADV 2 lysates could be observed when a cytotoxicity of 6% was reported with non loaded DC. Finally, we could observe a low allogeneic reaction with CTL against non HLA identical healthy donor PBMC, decreased of more than one log compared to the autologous PBMC. Good Manufacturing Practice-grade generation of ADV-specifi c T cells for adoptive immunotherapy could be achieved with a synthetic antigen. This technology presents the advantages to be fast, without any in vitro amplifi cation before infusion, and to allow a good reactivity to propose immunotherapy in case of anti-viral treatment failure. (1) DC as well as specifi c T-cells are pivotal mediators of CTL responses. We could show that autologous T-cells obtained from AML-patients or allogeneic Donor-T-cells can be primed by DCleu resulting in a very effi cient lysis of naive blasts, however not in every case -resulting in anergic T-cells or even in blast stimulation. To enlight the interactions between DC/MNC and T-cells and to predict antileukemic or non-antileukemic Tcell reactions we investigated chemokine and cytokine release profi les in supernatants collected during DC-generation (n=91) and from MLC-cultures of T-cells with MNC (n=55) or DC (n=56) from 39 AML/MDS-cases. Cytokines and chemokines were quantifi ed by cytometric bead array. The lytic activity of DC/MNC-trained T-cells against naive blasts was quantifi ed after 3/24 hours. 1) Lytically active T-cells after DC/MNC-priming secernated higher levels of IL-6 (median release 27/44pg per 10 6 cells) than lytically inactive T-cells (median release 14.5/15pg per 10 6 cells). We showed that more han 75% of all cases gained lytic T-cell activity if >15/20pg IL-6 per 10 6 cells were released after DC/MNC-priming. Lytically active T-cells secernated higher amounts of IFN-g than lytically inactive T-cells after DCpriming (95/<5pg per 10 6 cells). After MNC-priming however the median release of IFN-g of lytically inactive T-cells was higher than that of lytically active T-cells (110/56pg per 10 6 cells). We found no differences in secretion profi les of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and TNF-a between the lytically active or inactive T-cells after DC/ MNC-priming. 2) DC able to prime lytically active T-cells expressed higher levels of CXCL8, CCL2, CXCL10, CCL5 and CXCL9 (median release 864/30/5/3/2pg per 10 6 cells) than DC unable (median release all 0pg/10 6 cells). We observed that 75% of all cases gained lytic T-cell activity after priming with DC that produced >800pg/10 6 cells CXCL8 or >200pg/10 6 cells CCL2. That means that the secretion-profi le of CXCL8 and CCL2, both T-cell chemoattractants, of DC as well as the release of IL-6 and IFN-g (mediators of CTL) in MLC of DC-primed T-cells is predictive for the antileukemic capacity of T-cells. However, after MNC-priming of T-cells the IFN-g release was not associated with a lytic activity thereby confi rming the central role of DC in antileukemic T-cell response.",

However, since different gd-Tcell subsets vary considerably in their functional properties, the aim of the present study was to defi ne repertoires of cytokines, chemokines and angiogenic factors of in vitro expanded Vd1and Vd2-T-cells in response to neuroblastoma. Methods: gd-T-cell culture: Freshly isolated gd-T-cells from PBMCs of healthy individuals were resuspended (1.5 x 10 6 cells/ml) in IMDM (10% FCS, 2 mM Glutamine, 200 IU/ml IL-2, 0.5\u00b5g/ml PHA) and plated in 96-well plates. 100 \u00b5M pamidronate was added to 50% of the cell-pools to facilitate preferential outgrowth of Vd1+ T-cells. Since no feeder or accessory cells were added, the percentage of Vd1+ T-cells increased due to decay of Vd2+T-cells in these cultures. gd-Tcell neuroblastoma challenge. Irradiated Nb-cells (50Gy) were seeded in 24-well plates. 24 hours later, when they were adherent, culture medium was displaced and cells washed twice with PBS. RPMI 1640defi cient medium (no additives but serum and L-glu) was added with gd-T-cells in a 1:10 ratio to Nb-cells. After 2 hours supernatants were harvested for protein array and gdTcells for mRNA preparation. Results: After short term culture, both gd-subsets released Th1 (IL-2,IFN-g,IL-12,TNF-a,TNF-b) and Th2-cytokines (IL-4,-5,-6,-10,-13, Vd1 also TGF-b), chemokines (I-309,MCP1-3,RANTES), interleukins (IL-1,-8,-15), chemokines (leptin) as well as angiogenic growth factors (ANG,VEGF,EGF, IGF-1). These molecules were expressed at higher levels in Vd2-than Vd1-T-cells. Neuroblastoma-challenge blocked Th2-cytokine and IFN-g release in both gd-T-cell subsets. In Vd2-T-cells, Th1-cytokines were down-and tumor growthpromoting factors (ANG,VEGF, EGF, and IGF-I) were strongly upregulated. In contrast, Vd1-T-cells stopped the release of tumorsupportive factors and tolerogenic TGF-b, and strongly upregulated TNF-a and -b, MCP-1 and -2 and maintained their IL-2 production. Conclusions: Vd1-rather than Vd2-T-cells support antitumor responses against Neuroblastoma by secreting proinfl ammatory cytokines. Furthermore Vd1-T-cells do not sustain a growth-promoting or tolerogenic microenvironment. These results make Vd1-T-cells an ideal candidate for upcoming immunotherapy trials in neuroblastoma.",

However, the obstacles in generation of CTL using autologous APC namely dendritic cells are labor intensive and expensive besides it's highly variable in quality and quantity. This has triggered the interest in the development of artifi cial antigen presenting complexes (aAPC) for reliable antigen-specifi c CTL expansion. In our study, we explored various co-stimulatory signals for the possibility to induce higher stimulatory capability in aAPC. We loaded epoxy surface activated magnetic beads with HLA-B*0702/CMV_pp65 (TPRVTGGGAM) monomer and activating antibodies (AB) against CD28 co-stimulatory molecules and/or ligands (L) of the TNF-receptor (TNFR) family namely CD28 (AB), ICOS (AB), 4-IBB (AB+L), CD27 (L), OX40 (L). Cell cultures were analyzed weekly by staining with HLA-B*0702/ CMV_pp65 (TPRVTGGGAM) tetramers and surface antibodies against CD3, CD8, CD45RA, CCR7, CD57 and CD25. Our results demonstrated that triggering of CD28 co-stimulatory molecules is pivotal for aAPC besides the antigen-specifi c signal to ensure an optimal expansion of CMV-specifi c CTL. This signal could not be replaced by neither ICOS nor 4-IBB alone or in combination. The addition of ICOS and/or 4-IBB to CD28 co-stimulatory molecules did not signifi cantly improve the percentage of CTL after 3 weeks of culture. However, a trend towards higher cell numbers and specifi city was observed when combining all three CD28 (AB), ICOS (AB) and 4-IBB (AB).",

Fick, G. Stuhler, A. Opitz, H. Einsele, G. Grigoleit Julius-Maximilians-University (W\u00fcrzburg, DE) Flow cytometry has become a routine method in both clinical and basic immunological research. A main advantage is its ability to differentiate between distinct populations of cells by surface staining of various parameters. For example, we have the possibility to identify antigen-specifi c T-cells by fl ow cytometry through the development of soluble multimeric peptide-MHC complexes. Nevertheless, surface staining does not provide information about the functionality of the respective cell populations towards stimuli that are immediately refl ective of intracellular events. Hence, further methods have been described to defi ne cells by detection of intracellular epitopes. These assays include the intracellular staining of distinct cytokines or phosporylated signaling molecules (Phosfl ow). MHC-multimer approaches combined with intracellular staining are routinely used, whereas the detection of intranuclear p-kinases under MHC-multimer staining applying the Phosfl ow-protocols has not been realized so far. The use of phosphoepitope analysis in antigen-specifi c T-cells is of high interest in infections or especially during immunosuppressive drug treatment. Therefore, we aimed to establish a dual multimerphospho-staining protocol to provide a method to get insight into the biochemical signaling processes in antigen-specifi c T-cells. We chose CTL responses against CMV as model system due to well established epitopes and high frequency in healthy donors. The original Phosfl ow-protocols (Chow et al, 2001; Nolan & Krutzik, 2003) did not turn out to be suitable for a combination with the MHC-multimer approach. The very harsh fi xation and permeabilization procedures largely or completely abrogated the antigen-specifi c staining. We have been able to stain both the CMV-specifi c T-cell-receptor and the phosphorylated kinase following polyclonal stimuli (e.g. PMA, IL-2 etc.) using different protocols for some p-kinases. As far as we could determine, these protocols for the fi rst time facilitate specifi c Tcell-receptor staining with that of intranuclear phosphoepitopes after polyclonal stimulation. We currently evaluate these protocols under ex vivo conditions with CMV-specifi c artifi cial antigen presenting cells and antibody-coated plates. As mentioned above, the use of phosphoepitope analysis in antigen-specifi c T-cells may offer the possibility to get insight into complex signaling processes in defi ned clinical situations, e.g. in immunosuppressed patients post Allo-SCT.",

Biral, S. Gattillo, T. Roccia, C. Evangelio, M. Fossati, S. Napolitano, A. Giardelli, C. Soliman, F. Ciceri, M.G. Roncarolo, S. Marktel Scientifi c Institute H S Raffaele (Milan, IT) Mixed chimerism (MC) and secondary graft failure are frequent events following BMT for thalassemia. There is limited information regarding the outcome of donor lymphocytes infusion (DLI) to rescue from rejection, mainly from case reports describing only successful cases. We report our series of 6 middle east thalassemia patients (median age 7 years, range 4-13); Pesaro class II (N=2) or III (N=4) treated with DLI for grade 2-3 (<90% donor) MC following myeloablative Bu-Cy based BMT. In accordance to the schedule used in chronic myeloid leukemia, patients transplanted from a sibling donor (N=5) received a fi rst dose of 107 CD3/kg when MC was documented and, in the absence of side effects, full response or rejection, a second dose of 5*107 CD3/kg one month later; 1 patient transplanted from a phenotipically matched marrow was treated with 106 CD3/kg. Cyclosporin-A was gradually tapered off and discontinued 1 year following BMT according to the transplant protocol with no dose modification in DLI treated patients. Patients were evaluated monthly on peripheral blood, CD3, CD19, CD56, CD15 subpopulations and bone marrow for donor chimerism. In terms of safety, no graft versus host disease, aplasia or other severe adverse event were documented. Only one patient, infused when donor chimerism was 65%, experienced transient grade 3 thrombocytopenia followed by autologous reconstitution. In terms of effi cacy, we observed a different pattern of response in class II and class III patients. Among the 2 patients in class II, the fi rst patient, transfusion independent post BMT, was infused on day 90 (MC 65%, CD3+ 40%) and day 176 (MC 50%, CD3+ 60%), and converted to full donor following the second DLI. The second patient received DLI on day 174 (MC 82%, CD3+ 90%) when transfusion dependent and converted to full donor 1 month later becoming transfusion independent. These results were not confi rmed in class III patients (N=4)where DLI were never successful in preventing secondary graft failure. In conclusion, escalating doses of DLI was safe in a cohort of 6 patients with MC following myeloablative BMT for thalassemia but effi cacy was achieved only in class II patients. We speculate that class II patients are less alloimmunized and therefore a longer coexistance of host and donor marrow allows time to DLI to eliminate residual host hemopoiesis; class III patients probably have stronger alloimmunity hesitating in immune mediated rejection of donor cells despite DLI. (1) Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are endowed with immune modulatory properties. Because of these properties, MSC have been tested in the fi eld of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation where they proved to be able to improve engraftment of donor haematopoietic stem cells and to rescue patients with steroid-resistant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Despite these encouraging clinical data, limited and confl icting results are available on the effect of MSCs on antitumor immune surveillance. As therapeutic applications of MSCs often involve patients with malignant diseases, to obtain further insights on this issue is of crucial importance. We evaluated the effect of both autologous and third-party bone-marrow derived MSC on in vitro induction of leukemia-reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL). The effect of MSCs was evaluated on fi ve different donor-derived anti-leukemia CTL lines generated through an experimental approach that we previously set-up. Anti-leukemia CTL lines were generated both in the presence and in the absence of MSCs (MSC/PBMC ratio 1:20). We found heterogeneity in terms of MSC capacity to affect the emergence of anti-leukemia CTL response in vitro, irrespectively of the fact that employed MSCs were either autologous or third-party. The addition of autologous MSCs determined an enhancement of cytotoxic activity (mean increase: 45%) in three antileukemia CTL lines and an inhibition of cytotoxic activity in two lines (mean inhibition: 33%). Third-party MSCs determined an enhancement of cytotoxic activity in three CTL lines (mean increase: 26%) and an inhibition in two lines (mean inhibition: 22%). These results were observed at an effector/target ratio of 10:1. When present, the reactivity of anti-leukemia CTL lines against patient non-malignant cells was always reduced in the presence of MSCs (mean inhibition: 77%). In four anti-leukemia CTL lines the addition of both autologous and third-party MSCs inhibited the expansion rate of CTLs (mean inhibition: 35%), while in one case a great expansion of CTLs was documented (increase= 120%). The regulatory effect of MSCs was not related to an expansion of either CD4+ or CD8+ Treg. The evaluation of cytokines production and of the level of different soluble mediators is in progress with the aim of clarifying the biological mechanisms underlying the discordant results obtained on the immune modulatory effects of MSCs on antileukemia CTLs.",

Hassold, K. Seystahl, C. Dix, J. Wischhusen, H. Einsele, R. Seggewiss University of W\u00fcrzburg (W\u00fcrzburg, DE) Objectives: Immunotherapies have not been as successful as expected. Thus, pharmacologic approaches to enhance NK cell cytotoxicity and/or increasing tumor ligand expression are warranted. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib may offer such an approach. While Blake et al. (2008) have reported that dasatinib inhibits NK cell cytotoxicity, we have observed differential effects of clinically relevant doses (10-50nM) on NK cell functions against different tumor cell targets. Methods: NK cells from healthy human donors were expanded in coculture with RPMI 8866 feeders yielding a median NK cell purity of 77% (range 65-91%). Functional outcomes assessed included cytotoxicity, CD107a/b expression, TNFa/INFg production and apoptosis/necrosis induction. Results: Expansion of NK cells was completely inhibited at 50nM (n=4, p<0.001) as well as dose dependently NK cytotoxicity against Daudi, Jurkat and K562 cells (n=3, p<0.001 for all cell lines) when dasatinib was added in the 4h cytotoxicity assays. 24h pre-treatment of K562 cells with 50nM dasatinib led to signifi cantly reduced cytotoxicity (n=3, p<0.001) in opposite to pre-treating Daudi and Jurkat cells (n=3). Instead, 24h pretreatment of NK cells led to an increased cytotoxicity against Daudi (n=3, p<0.001) but not against K562 and Jurkat cells. TNFa/INFg production and CD107a/b expression was inhibited by dasatinib when NK cells were co-cultured with K562 cells (n=3) but unaffected after PMA/calcium-ionophore induced stimulation (n=3). Interestingly, the K562 induced TNFa/INFg production was increased in dasatinib pre-treated NK cells (n=3). The observed effects were not due to a decreased viability of NK cells as apoptosis/necrosis rates were unaffected (n=4).",

            "text": "Conclusion: SRC kinase-dependent cytokine production and degranulation was reduced raising concerns regarding NK cell function impairment. Hampered NK cell cytotoxicity when dasatinib was present in the cytotoxicity assay may be due to an inhibition of SRC kinase-dependent RAS/RAF/MEK/ERKpathway. Interestingly, dasatinib pre-treated NK cells showed increased cytotoxicity against Daudi but not against Jurkat and K562 cells, which suggests that dasatinib may block signals from certain activating and inhibitory receptors, making the overall effect dependent on cell line specifi c receptor/ligand expression. Our fi ndings argue for a careful evaluation of the timing of dasatinib application during tumor treatment to enhance immunotherapeutic efforts. For patients lacking a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor, umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a promising source of hematopoetic stem cells. Greater HLA disparity can be tolerated between the recipient and donor UCB compared with bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells because of the naive and immature phenotype of UCB derived T cells. The risk of rejection is increased after UCB transplantation. After HLA-identical sibling or matched unrelated SCT the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect may be increased by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after SCT. However, after UCB transplantation DLI is not possible. This raised the question of whether ex vivo expanded CB lymphocytes (CBL) also can be used as a tool for adoptive immunotherapy after CB SCT. We have managed to establish a protocol for massive expansion of CB derived T cells making them usable in the clinic suitable for DLI after CB transplantation. We have further been able to show that the expansion protocol doesnt skew the T cell population regarding the phenotype, CD4:CD8 ratio as well as TCR usage profi le measured by spectratyping. By activating the cells we have further investigated and confi rmed the expanded T cells capacity to effi ciently produce pro-infl ammatory cytokines and respond in an allogeneic setting. We have now tried expanded CBLs in an adult patient with AML with threatening rejection after double UCB transplantation. The patient received Bu/Cy and ATG as conditioning therapy. He was transplanted with double UCB with a total nucleated cell dose of 5 x 10 7 /kg. Both UCB units were 5/6 matched for HLA-A,-B and -DRB1 with low resolution HLA-typing. Chimerism analysis one month after transplant showed mixed chimerism in T-, B-and myeloid cells of both donor units and recipient. At four months after transplant the patient had 85% recipient cells in both T cells and myeloid cells indicating a threatening rejection. However, in bone marrow CD34+ cells were 90% of donor origin. Due to anticipated rejection the patient was treated with expanded CBLs, 5 x 10 3 /kg at 4 months, 1 x 10 4 /kg at 5 months and 1 x 10 5 /kg at six months. Immunusuppression was tapered at six months. The immunemodulatory treatment was well tolerated with no development of GVHD. So far no change in chimeric pattern has been shown. The immunemodulatory treatment will be continued with increasing doses of CBLs.",

Wickenhauser (2) , M. von Bergwelt-Baildon (1) (1)Lab for Tumor /Transplantation Immunol (Cologne, DE); (2) Pathology (Cologne, DE) Introduction: As Dendritic cells (DC) are effective conductors of adaptive and innate immune responses, they are used as cellular adjuvant for active immunotherapy. Nevertheless, challenges to this approach have been identifi ed. Recently CD40-activated B cells (CD40-B) have been studied as complementary antigen presenting cells. They can be expanded from small amounts of PB at >95% purity under GMP-like conditions and effi ciently prime and expand na\u00efve T cells in vitro. Importantly these cells are available at virtually unlimited amounts for high-dose, highfrequency vaccination considered crucial for the control of cancer in vivo. Methods and results: For preclinical in vivo testing using highdose, repetitive vaccinations with CD40-B we developed a murine system to study their ability to induce immune responses in vivo. mCD40B are generated from murine splenocytes by coculture with murine CD40-Ligand and addition of IL-4. mCD40B cells could be expanded more than 6-fold within 14 days and >90% purity. mCD40B were used to establish a vaccination model to study induction of tumor-and auto-antigen specifi c immune responses as well as toxicity of very-high-dose injections (VHD) in B6 mice. To determine long-term toxicity mice were vaccinated twice weekly for 5 weeks using high-doses (3x10 6 ~ 1x10 8 /kg) of mCD40B. This is about 2-3 log higher than currently used in DC vaccinations in humans. Acute toxicity was assessed by vaccinating mice once with VHD (1x10 7 ~ 3.3x10 8 /kg). There was no difference in survival, weight and clinical appearance compared to control mice. Histo-pathological assessment did not reveal any pathologic changes. Murine Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction was established to investigate the immune-stimulatory capacity of mCD40B in comparison to mDC through detection of T cell proliferation in vitro. Immune monitoring by intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-g and assessment of in vivo cytotoxicity revealed that mCD40B vaccination leads to increased IFN-g production by activated T cells and specifi c lysis of CFSE-labelled peptide-pulsed target cells. Conclusion: Based on these fi ndings that mCD40B induce T cell responses in vitro and in vivo we are now developing the optimal mCD40B vaccination algorithm for preventive and therapeutic treatment of B16-Melanoma in B6 mice as a next step towards future clinical application in post transplant donorlymphocyte-infusion or vaccination. Objectives: Cytokine induced killer (CIK) cells are CD3+CD56+ cells obtained by in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PCMCs) with INF-gamma followed by anti-CD3 antibody and expanded for 21-28 days in the presence of IL-2. CIK cells show considerable NK-like cytotoxic activity against tumor cells of several lineages, in particular hematologic neoplasms, and potent anti-tumoral activity in vivo when injected in mice carrying either murine or human tumors with little GVHD. We aimed to obtain a full ontogenic and functional characterization of CIK cells that represent a valid tool for the immunotherapy of tumors. Methods: CIK cells were generated in vitro by stimulation of PCMCs or sorted T cell subsets with IFN-gamma, anti-CD3 and IL-2. They were fully characterized in terms of phenotype, cytotoxic activity and gene expression in comparison with CD56-T cells and NK cells also present at the end of CIK cultures, and with circulating CD3+CD56+ cells. Results: We demonstrate that CIK derive from proliferating CD3+CD56-CD8+ T cells and not from the few CD3+CD56+ cells present in the starting culture. They express polyclonal T cell receptor Vbeta chains and have acquired CD56, NKG2D and large granular lymphocyte morphology, but lack expression of most NK specifi c activating (NKp30, NKp44, NKp46) and inhibitory (KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2, KIR3DL1, NKG2A, CD94) receptors, and can kill K562 targets. Circulating CD3+CD56+ cells are also CD8+CD16-but are oligoclonal, poorly cytotoxic for K562 and express lower levels of CD56 and NKG2D. Gene profi ling of CIK, CD56-T and NK cells present at the end of culture shows that differences are much more limited between CIK and CD56-T compared to CIK and NK cells. CIK cells express many genes shared by the \"infl ammatory\" memory T cells. Interestlingly, most of the genes up-regulated in CIK cells compared to CD56-T cells are part of the TNF gene network. Conclusion: CIK cells are terminally differentiated CD8 T cells. They differ from CD56-T cells present at the end of culture in terms of expression of CD56, NK cytotoxicity and proliferation. CIK phenotype, that is CD45RA+, CCR7-, CD62L weakly positive, CD11a+, CD27+, CD28-, MIP1alpha+, Perforin+, FASL+ coincides almost exactly with that described for the T effector memory RA+ (EMRA) CD27 single positive subset of terminally differentiated human memory T cells. Therefore, CIK cells may represent an even more advanced stage of differentiation of CD56-T cells.",

Klingebiel Goethe University Frankfurt (Frankfurt, DE) Introduction: Allogeneic SCT has become an important treatment modality for patients with high risk leukemia and is also increasingly used as a therapeutic tool for children and adolescents with solid malignancies like rhabdomyosarcoma and ewing sarcoma. Nevertheless, relapse still remains the major cause for treatment failure. Adoptive immunotherapy approaches using cytokine induced killer (CIK) cells might help to prevent relapse in these cases. CIK cells are ex vivo activated and expanded non-MHC restricted lymphocytes including basically \"NK-like\" T cells, T helper cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The entire population is known for a notable anticancer toxicity compared to a moderate alloreactivity. Methods: For CIK cell generation peripheral blood mononuclear cells were expanded over 2 to 3 weeks by addition of IFN-g (1000U/ml) on day one and OKT-3 (50ng/ml) as well as IL-2 (500U/ml) within the following 24 hours of culture. Culture medium and IL-2 were changed every 3-4 days. By the time the percentage of CD3+ CD56+ cells increased the whole population and all subgroups were analyzed for their phenotype and cytotoxic mechanism against rhabdomyosarcoma and leukemia cell lines. In addition alloreactivity was tested by europium release assay. Results: By using this protocol easily expanded CIK cells showed an excellent cytotoxicity against alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS13), T-ALL (H9, Molt4/8), B-ALL (Raji) and AML (THP-1) cell lines even within 7 to 10 days of culture. Using the europium release assay up to 60% of RMS13 cells, 75% of Molt4/8 cells, 85% of H9 cells, 60% of THP-1 cells and 35% of Raji cells were killed. Particularly the NK cell subgroup appeared to have a main part in antitumor and antileukemia activity. In this regard blocking MICA/B and ULBP2 resulted in a more than 50%-reduction of cell lysis. Further experiments concerning the killing mechanism of CIK cells, e.g. the role of apoptosis are underway. In contrast detection of alloreactivity was negligible. The reason for that will also be part of further investigations. Conclusion: Based on their anticancer activity and non-alloreactivity, CIK cells might represent an effective tool for cellular therapy in patients with acute leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma and ewing sarcoma undergoing an allogeneic transplantation.

Nagy (2) (1)St. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Hospital (Budapest, HU); (2)Postgraduate Medical School (Miskolc, HU) Objectives: The authors have summarized retrospectively the results of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in pediatric patients (<18y) with severe aplastic anaemia performed between 01. 01.1992. and 30.09.2008 . in Hungary. Results: During this period 43 transplants were performed in 38 pts (5 re-transplantation: 3 graft rejection, 1 graft failure, 1 late clonal disease /paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria/). Median age of pts. was 10 years (1, (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) 8) . 27 sibling and 16 alternative (9 matched unrelated, 5 mismatched unrelated, 2 haplo) donors were used. Median elapsed time from diagnosis to transplant was 85 days (17-1826) (matched related donor/ MRD/: 42 days, alternative donor 294 days). Source of graft was bone marrow in 25 transplants, peripheral blood in 17 cases and umbilical cord blood in one patient. Conditioning regimen consisted of mainly anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)-Cytoxan (19), Fludara-Cytoxan-ATG (7) or Cytoxan alone (5). Short course of cyclosporin A-methotrexate combination was used as graft versus host (GvH) profi laxis in 34 cases. 39/43 transplants have engrafted (absolute neutrophil counts > 0,5 G/ l: 19 days; platelet > 20 G/l: 20 days), rejections were observed in 4 cases. Acute (II-IV) and chronic GvHD were developed in 16/38 and 5/31 cases, respectively. 8/38 pts. have died (bacterial septicaemia 2, fungal infections 2, tuberculosis 1, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease 1). After a median of 1553 days 30/38 pts (79%) are alive; overall survival of patients with MRD and alternative donor was 21/24 (88%) and 9/14 (64%), respectively. Conclusions: While the results of MRD transplants are comparable with other national registries, the unacceptably long elapsed time from diagnosis to transplant has infl uenced unfavourably the outcome of transplants with alternative donors. We are reporting the outcome of 80 patients with acquired severe aplastica anemia (SAA) allografted from an alternative donor, after conditioning with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide (FLU-CY), with or without the addition of low dose total body irradiation (2 Gy TBI). All patients also received rabbit ATG and cyclosporine-methtrextae for GvHD prophylaxis. The FLU-CY regimen was given to 40 patients (median age 13) and the FLU-CY-TBI to 35 patients, with a median age of 30 GvHD grade III-IV was seen in 1 patient in each group. Rejection was the cause of death in 3 patients in the FLU-CY group and in 2 patients in the FLU-CY-TBI group. The overall crude survival (80%) was excellent in both groups: the actuarial 5 year survival is 79% and 77%. The median interval from diagnosis to transplant was 582 days for all patients: survival was 87% vs 70% for patients grafted before or beyond that cut off. Causes of death were rejection (5), PTLD (2), infections (5), hemorrhage (2) .",

Lodi (1) Background: Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell transplantation (AlloHSCT) with cyclophosphamide (Cy) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) as conditioning regimen is the treatment of choice for young patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA). In developing countries, and particularly in Brazil, ATG costs limit its use in AlloHSCT for SAA patients. Alternative low-cost regiments, like low dose busulfan with Cy as conditioning regimen, has been used but is still associated with a higher rate of rejection, especially in heavily transfused patients. Recently, alemtuzumab (Cam) was reported as an alternative to ATG for SAA patients with similar activity and a lower cost. Aims and Methods: In order to study the effect of the combination Cam+Cy, we reviewed all AlloHSCT performed for SAA using this conditioning regimen. Between April 2007 and November 2008, thirteen patients with SAA (defi ned by Camitta criteria) underwent an AlloHSCT in four different institutions in Brazil. Median age at transplantation was 30 (range 11-42) years. All patients had a positive CMV serology. Median number of transfusions was 16 (range 0-172). One patient received Cam+Cy as a second allo-HSCT. Patients received an unmanipulated bone marrow (n=11) or peripheral blood (n=2) graft as stem cell source and all but one patient were transplanted with an HLA-identical sibling. Median number of nucleated cell infused was 3.5 (range 1.65-4.80)x10 8 /kg. Cyclosporin alone (n=8) or in combination with methotrexate (n=5) was used as GVHD prophylaxis. Results: twelve out of 13 patients presented neutrophil recovery with a median time to > 0.5x10 9 neutrophil/L of 23 (range 13-28) days. Platelet recovery (> 20x10 9 platelets/L) occurred in all patients with a median time of 15 (range 9-45) days. Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) was observed in just one patient (grade II). One of 11 patients alive 100-days after AlloHSCT presented a limited chronic GVHD. Seven patients presented a CMV reactivation and none presented CMV disease. With a median follow-up of 293(range 32-544) days, only one patient died of AlloHSCT complications. Summary: In conclusion, the combination of cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab is well-tolerated and effective in SAA patients undertaking AlloHSCT, with lower rates of acute and chronic GVHD. A longer follow-up is required, however, to properly evaluate late rejection incidence.",

Kozlov (2) (1)Novosibirsk State Medical University (Novosibirsk, RU); (2) Institute of Clinical Immunology SB RAMS (Novosibirsk, RU) Objective: To evaluate effi cacy of daclizumab combined with CsA in adult patients with refractory or relapsed AA. Patients and Methods: We treated 6 AA patients (VSAA -1, SAA -4, NSAA -1) with daclizumab (1 mg/kg every 2 weeks for a total 6 doses) and CsA (5 mg/kg/d) who relapsed (n=1) or did not achieve PR (n=5) after one (n=2) or two (n=4) courses of ATG and long-term therapy with CsA \u00b1 MMF. Median age was 20 years (range 19-32); median disease duration was 19 months (7-21) in non-responders and 36 months in relapsed patient; median period from fi rst and second ATG course were 12 (6-18) and 6 months (2-9) respectively. Minor PNH clone was detected in 4 of 6 patients. Results: Daclizumab was well tolerated in all cases. At median follow-up of 36 months all 6 patients are alive. Three patients (50%) achieved a good PR and the last treated patient currently does not meet criteria for a PR but continues to improve. Two patients (including relapsed) did not respond to daclizumab. The patient with relapse received second course of ATG and PR was achieved. Another non-responder was successfully transplanted from MRD. Median time to response was 4 months (range 3-6). One patient relapsed in the 21 months after the course of daclizumab and responded again to rabbit ATG. Some minor laboratory improvements which not fulfi lling PR to previous intensive IST and subclinical PNH were present in all three responders before start of daclizumab. Conclusion: Moderate and prolonged immunosupression with daclizumab and CsA might become a new salvage protocol for AA, especially for slowly responding to standard IST PNH+ patients. According to World Bank data, released in the 2008 report, Romania has an upper-middle-income economy. The health budget is low and most of expansive treatment for hematological diseases are not large available. Nine three patients with aplastic anemia (AA) was taken in charge by our institution between 1986 and 2002. Eighteen of 93 patients survived more than 5 years. We have studied the clinical characteristics and treatment of them. There were 8 female and 10 male, aged between 15 and 54 years, median 25 years. Eleven patients had severe AA and 7 patients had moderate AA. Fifteen out of 18 patients were transfused erythrocytes dependent and 8 out of 18 patients were transfused thrombocytes dependent. First line treatment was in 9 patients with Cyclosporine A (CsA), in 5 patients with danazol and in 3 patients with methyl-testosterone. Eight out of 18 patients had complete remission (3 with CsA, 3 with danazole and 2 with methyl-testosterone). Ten patients had partial response (6 with CsA, 2 with danazole and 2 with methyltestosterone). Average time until response was 231 days, limits 9 to 950 days (~32 months). Two patients relapsed, both after a fi rst response obtained with CsA, at 3 years and at 5 years and 9 months respectively. The second response was obtained in both cases with CsA too. Five out of 18 patients had a second disease: 1 paroxysmal nocturne hemoglobinuria and 4 myelodisplastic syndrome, at median interval of 181 months (limits 5 years 10 months and 24 years 5 months). Overall survival was 166 months (limits 5 years and 27 years 7 months). In conclusion, a long survival, in selected patients with aplastic anemia could be obtained also with nontransplant regimens of therapy.",

We report the results of a single-center study of immune reconstitution following ASCT in 15 female's patients in our Institution from 1998 to 2008. Methods: Autologous hematopoietic stem cells were collected from bone marrow (n=4) or mobilized from peripheral blood with either granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (n=2) or Cy and G-CSF (n=9). Pretransplant conditioning regimens included BEAM (n=1), BEAM + ATG (n=1) Melphalan 140 mg/ m\u00b2 + Etoposid 1600 mg/m\u00b2 (n=2), Melphalan 120 mg/m\u00b2 (n=1), Cy 200 mg/kg (n=2), Cy 200 mg/kg + ATG (n=1), Cy 120 mg/kg (n=7). In one patient we used co-transplantation of PBSC and expanded mesenhymal stromal cells. Results: Three patients died due to transplant-related complications (sepsis, CMV infection). These patients had long history of the corticosteroid treatment, multiple and severe episodes of infections pre-ASCT. All of the alive transplanted patients showed improvement in disease activity: CR (n=11), PR (n=1). One patient died after 8 years due to relapse and one patient in PR developed a relapse 3 years after ASCT. Long-term clinical remissions observed in our SLE patients are accompanied by the disappearance of anti-ds DNA and ANA antibodies and increasing of number of CD4+CD45RA+ T cells, CD4+CD25+bright T cells and CD4+Foxp3+ cells. We also demonstrated the signifi cant increase of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in S/G2M phase of the cell cycle until 1 year after ASCT. This data may demonstrate that ASCT can induce the homeostatic proliferation of T cells and may form the basis for immune reconstitution. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that ASCT in refractory SLE can induce stable long-term remission. The assessment of immune reconstitution can be important to understand the mechanisms of self tolerance re-establishing. International multicenter clinical trial would be required to clarify these questions.",

Alexander, A. Thiel, O. Rosen, G. Massenkeil, G. Burmester, H. Radtke, R. Arnold, F. Hiepe Charite University Medicine (Berlin, DE) Introduction: In recent years, clinical trials have indicated that immunoablation followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has the potential to induce longterm clinical remission in patients with severe autoimmune diseases, including refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, relapse of disease may occur in a fraction of these patients. Methods: As part of a monocentric phase I/II clinical trial, seven patients have received immunoablation with cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte-globulin and CD34-ASCT for refractory SLE. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were analyzed using multiparameter fl ow cytometry. In addition, autoantibody titers and specifi cities were monitored during follow-up. Disease activity was measured by SLEDAI. Results: With a median follow-up of 80 months, clinical (SLEDAI < 3) and serologic remission (disappearance of anti-dsDNA antibodies) could be achieved in all patients. Three patients suffered relapse of SLE after being free of clinical symptoms for 18, 30 and 80 months, respectively. Immunophenotypic analyses revealed signifi cant expansion of circulating B cells with memory (IgD-CD27+) and plasmablast phenotype (CD27high CD20-), and increase in CD45RO+ memory T cells six months prior to onset of relapse. Recurrence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) preceded clinical symptoms in two patients by 2 and 36 months, respectively, while in one patient ANA persisted after ASCT. Serologic analysis revealed changes in the ENA pattern in all three patients. One patient developed antinuclear antibodies specifi c for Smith-Antigen (Sm) while anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies disappeared. In contrast, the other two patients newly developed anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies while anti-Sm and anti-Histone antibodies disappeared after the fl are. Conclusion: The disappearance of pathogenic serum antibodies points to the effi cient depletion of immunological memory while recurrence of na\u00efve B-and T cell subsets suggests a complete reconfi guration of the adaptive immune system after ASCT. The recurrence of lupus activity observed in three patients after ASCT was accompanied by the development of antinuclear autoantibody with new specifi cities suggesting the de novo development of SLE rather than fl are of disease. We propose that ASCT has the potential to reinduce selftolerance in SLE, which is apparently not maintained in all patients maybe by the presentation of autoantigens in a tolerance-breaking form in genetically susceptible individuals.",

            "text": "Induction of immune tolerance to gluten in coeliac disease after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for thalassaemia major M. Bernardo (1) Several case reports have already shown that patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT for haematological disorders resolved concomitant autoimmune disorders. FoxP3+ regulatory T cells are responsible for immunological tolerance to both self and foreign antigens; dendritic cells (DC) play a pivotal role in addressing immune system towards a tolerogenic or infl am-matory response. Here we report two cases of a 6-year-old boy and a 24-year old women with coeliac disease (CD) and thalassaemia major who received allogeneic HSCT. Patients were assigned to risk class 1 and 3 of the Pesaro classifi cation, respectively. The donor was an HLA-identical sibling and an unrelated donor (UD), respectively; the latter was typed using high-resolution techniques for both class I and II HLA loci. Conditioning regimen included busulfan (16 mg/Kg), thiotepa (8 mg/ Kg) and fl udarabine (40 mg/m2). GvHD prophylaxis was based on the use of Cyclosporine (CsA) and short term methotrexate. Pre-transplantation antithymocyte globulin was administered in the patient transplanted from a UD. CsA was given for 12 months after HSCT. DC and lymphocyte populations, including FoxP3+ Treg, as well as the proliferative T cell response to chymotrypsin-digested gliadin (1-10-20 ug/ml) were studied at time of CD diagnosis and after HSCT, during both gluten-free and gluten-containing diet. The 2 patients successfully engrafted, showing 100% donor chimerism. After discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy, the establishment of a gluten-containing diet did not reinduce positivity of both serological and histological markers of CD after a 2 year follow-up. In both patients, the cytometric characterization of peripheral blood cells showed a depletion either in the % or in the absolute value of both DC and Treg at time of diagnosis (22-24 cells/ul, 0.2-0.2% and 96-83 cells/ul, 8-7%, respectively) in comparison to values found after HSCT during both diet regimens (41/54-39/48 cells/ul, 0.6/0.7%-0.7/0. 7% and 196/222-177/191 cells/ul, 18/20%-17/18%, respectively) . A critical reduction of proliferative T cell response to gliadin at any doses tested was observed after HSCT. Our data suggest that substitution of patients' immune system with the donor one, possibly together with phenomenon of recapitulation of immune system ontogeny, may result into induction of immune tolerance towards gluten. The recovery of a normal value of circulating DC and Treg may play a major role in silencing gliadin-reactive T cells.",

Milanetti, A. Testori Northwestern University (Chicago, US) We evaluated the safety and clinical outcome of autologous non-myeloablative HSCT in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) failing interferon therapy. Eligible patients had RRMS and despite interferon beta had 2 corticosteroid treated relapses within the prior 12 months, or 1 such relapse and gadolinium enhancing lesion(s) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated on an occasion distinct from the relapse. Peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were mobilized with cyclophosphamide (2.0 g/m\u00b2) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (10 ug/kg/day). HSCT conditioning regimen was cyclophosphamide (200 mg /kg) and either alemtuzumab (20 mg) or rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (6 mg/kg). Twenty-one patients were treated. Engraftment of white blood cells and platelets was on mean day 9 and hospital discharge on mean day 11. The only infections were one episode of Clostridium diffi cile diarrhea and 2 cases of dermatomal zoster. Two patients receiving alemtuzumab developed late immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) that remitted with standard therapy and all patients are beyond 2 years (mean 3 years). All patients are surviving, 17 patients (81%) improved by at least 1.0 or more EDSS points, and fi ve patients (24%) relapsed but achieved another remission after further immunosuppression. After a mean of 3 years, progression-free survival is 100%, and relapse-free survival is 76%. Signifi cant improvement occurred in neurologic disability determined by extended disability status scale (EDSS) (P < 0.0001), neurologic rating score (NRS) (P=0.0001), paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT) (P=0.009), and 25 foot walk (P < 0.0001), as well as quality of S273 life as measured by the short form-36 (SF-36) (P < .0005).

Barros, B.P. Sim\u00f5es, J.C. Voltarelli Clinical Hospital of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto (Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, BR) There is no report in the literature regarding the incidence of CMV infection in autoimmune diseases patients treated with high-dose immunosuppression followed by ASCT. We report here the incidence of CMV infection in 88 consecutive ASCT for autoimmune diseases transplanted between January 2003 to May 2008 (Multiple Sclerosis (MS)=45; Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus=22; Systemic Sclerosis=9; Neuromyelitis Optica=4; Systemic Lupus Erithematous=4; Amiothrophic Lateral Sclero-sis=2; Vulgar Pemphigus=1; and Takayasu Arteritis=1). Before ASCT, all patients were seropositive for CMV. The used conditioning regimens were BEAM + hATG 30mg/Kg for 11 MS patients, and Cy 200mg/Kg + rATG 4,5mg/Kg for the other patients. All patients received peripheral blood as source of stem cells. Blood red cells and platelets infused were all irradiated and fi ltrated. Blood CMV pp65 antigen test was based on monoclonal antibody against the virus and immunofl uorescence. CMV infection was defi ned as a positivity of at least one pp65 antigenemia assay at any level. In all patients, a CMVpp65 antigenemia assay was determined weekly, starting from the day when the absolute neutrophil count went above 500 x 10\u00b3/ul, and until day 60 after ASCT. Patients with fi ve or more positive CMV cells, patients in use of corticosteroids with any number of positive CMV cells, and patients with any clinical signs of CMV disease with any number of positive CMV cells were treated with Gancyclovir. Among the 88 transplanted patients, 18 (20,5%) presented a positive antigenemia. The fi rst positive antigenemia presented a median of 19 days after stem cell reinfusion (range 05 to 52). The median antigenemia level at the fi rst appearance was 2 infected cells (range 1-40). Overall, 07 patients were treated with Gancyclovir. Five were treated preemptively. Two patients had CMV pneumonits, and one died from it at D+17 after transplantation. In 61% of the cases (11 patients), CMV reactivation was asymptomatic with less them 5 cells positive and antigenemia has cleared spontaneously. Our study shows that CMV infection can reactivate in a signifi cant proportion of seropositive patients after ASCT. However, despite the use of Antimocyte Globulin in the conditioning regimen, the rate of CMV reactivation in this subset of patients seens not be different from the 29% rate of reactivation recently encountered after ASCT for hematologic malignancies (Rossini, F., et al, Transpl Infect Dis 2005: 7: 122-125) . Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation has recently been used to treat refractory Crohn's disease (CD), showing good effi cacy and acceptable safety. We updated our fi rst experience with unselected stem cell autotransplantation in refractory CD. Seven patients (3 male, 4 female; age 26-45 years) with active moderate-severe CD (median CDAI 336, range 272-395; four with perianal disease), refractory or intolerant to several lines of treatment (2-6, median 4) including corticosteroids, infl iximab and immunosuppressant agents, were enrolled. Unselected PBSCs were collected after mobilisation with CTX 1.5 g/m\u00b2 and G-CSF 10 micrograms/kg. The conditioning regimen included CTX 50 mg/kg on days -5 to -2 and rabbit ATG 2.5 mg/kg on days -4 to -2. Toxicity, clinical response (clinical remission = CDAI < 150), endoscopic response (SES-CD) and extramucosal response (ultrasound sonography [US]) were assessed after mobilisation, at 3, 6, 9, 12 months and then every 6 months after stem cells reinfusion. No improvement was observed after mobilisation (median CDAI 363, range 258-404). Six patients were in clinical remission at the fi rst month (median CDAI 141, . At the third month, all patients were in clinical remission (median CDAI 98, range 56-132) despite discontinuation of all medications. After a median follow-up of 28 months (range 13-37), two relapses occurred after 4 and 12 months, respectively, while all other patients maintained clinical remission. At the last follow-up visit, complete mucosal healing was achieved in 5 out of 6 evaluable patients, with complete endoscopic remission in 3/3 patients evaluable at 24 months. Bowel thickening as assessed by US was slower to decrease, but improved in all patients and disappeared in 4/6 patients. Complete perianal fi stulas closure was observed in 3/4 patients. No deaths or lifethreatening infections occurred. Major adverse events included a perianal abscess after mobilisation in one patient, pleural and pericardial effusions in another, BK virus-related hemorrhagic cystitis in one case, and acute pyelonephritis in another patient, all rapidly resolved with conservative treatment. Unselected CD34+ cells transplantation has the potential of inducing and maintaining both clinical and endoscopic remission in refractory CD patients. Our data encourage the enrollment of patients with refractory CD into the currently ongoing EBMT multicenter trial (ASTIC).",

Grassia, A. Uccelli, E. Capello, G.L. Mancardi, A. Bacigalupo, A.M. Marmont Azienda Ospedaliera-Universitaria S. Martino (Genoa, IT) Starting from 1996, 45 patients with SADs were treated with high-dose immunosoppression (HDIS) in Genoa. Of these, 2 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) achieved complete remission already after mobilization (Cy 4g/sm) and received no further treatment. 37 pts received autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), 4 received allogeneic SCT (2 after ASCT) and 1 syngeneic. One patient with severe pulmonary scleroderma (SSc) died after mobilization and 1 with multiple sclerosis (MS) died 70 days after ASCT of thromboembolic complications. Twenty-three patients with MS were treated with ASCT, and achieved total regression of Gd-enhancing CNS lesions, and 1-2 degrees of improvement on the EDSS scale. Both only mobilized and autotransplanted SLE patients achieved complete clinical remission (SLEDAI) and signifi cant reduction of biomarkers but all of them had to receive maintenance treatment. Allogeneic transplants were performed for 4 patients (Behcet's, Evans, Pure White Cell Aplasia-PWCA and Sjogren-SLE overlap with chronic infl ammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIPD). Two of them died 5 years (haemolyticuremic syndrome-HUS) and 6 years (hepatitis-polyneuritis) after transplant. One patient with severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) received a syngeneic transplant, had a marked decrease of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), but relapsed clinically 3 months later. Our experience indicates that ASCT, potentiated by prior stem cell mobilization with 4g/sm of cyclophosphamide, has a powerful remitting effect in SADs. More intense conditioning regimens have resulted in longer and better remissions. Immunological cure was not achieved, and MRD could not be evaluated. After allo-SCT, in 2 cases DLI were necessary to achieve full donor chimerism coincident with CR, in 1 case relapse occurred notwithstanding full donor chimerism.",

Ciceri San Raffaele Scientifi c Institute (Milan, IT) Background: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been performed for aggressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with raising frequency; standard myeloablative chemotherapy (BEAM) \u00b1 in vivo T-cell depletion produces long-term remission of disease, with signifi cant morbidity and mortality. We assessed the feasibility of high-dose immunosuppression with Thiotepa and cyclophosphamide (Cy) with ASCT in patients with aggressive forms of MS. Methods: From December 2005 to October 2007, 9 patients affected by MS, unresponsive to conventional therapies, with elevated infl ammatory disease activity, underwent ASCT in our institution. Five patients had a relapsing-remitting, 3 a secondary progressive and 1 an hyper-acute MS. Patients had a median of 26 years, 6 (range 2.5-8) points in EDSS disability score and 15 enhancing lesions (range 1-67) on MRI before ASCT, with a median of 2 relapses in the 2 years before ASCT. Autologous hematopoietic stem cells were mobilized with Cy 4 gr/mq at day 0 followed by granulocyte colony stimulating factor 5mcg/Kg/day from day +2 to stem cell harvest. Harvest was not manipulated before cryopreservation. The conditioning regimen before ASCT consisted of Thiotepa 5mg/Kg bid on day -5 and Cy 50 mg/Kg on days -3 and -2. The median follow-up was 29 months. Results: Mobilization was successfull in all cases, with a median of 12.91x106 collected and 5.7x106 infused CD34+cells/Kg. Hematopoietic recovery was documented safely in 9/9 patients, with a median of 10 days for neutrophil and platelet engraftment. The median time of hospitalization was 24 days. Six patients developed febrile neutropenia, lasting a median of 4.5 days. There were no major adverse events. TRM was 0%. Seven patients were stable or improved at the last follow-up: 5 improved EDSS by at least 0.5 points, 2 were stable. Relapses were observed in 5 patients (4 at 1 year, 1 at 2 years after ASCT) with complete recovery after steroids. The confi rmed progression free survival is 77.8%, the disease activity free survival is 33%. A signifi cative reduction by the 79% of the annualized relapse rate and 99,6% of the enhancing lesions occurred. Conclusions: High-dose immunosuppressive therapy with Thiotepa and Cy followed by ASCT reduced disease activity and disability progression of aggressive MS with safe profi le and low toxicities. Larger number of patients and longer follow-up will be necessary to establish the value of this regimen in producing long-term disease remissions.",

Alexander, S. Schneider, S. Ziemer, U. Schneider, H. Radtke, G. Burmester, A. Thiel, R. Arnold, F. Hiepe Charite University Medicine (Berlin, DE) Introduction: Stem cell therapy for autoimmune diseases is rapidly developing with promising clinical results. However, it is increasingly recognized these patients have an added propensity to develop secondary autoimmune disorders, distinct from the underlying autoimmune disease, given their genetic predisposition to autoimmunity. Methods: As part of a monocentric phase I/II clinical trial at the Charit\u00e9 University Medicine, seven patients have received immunoablation with cyclophosphamide and ATG and CD34-ASCT for SLE. We now report the case of acquired factor VIII hemophilia in a patient developing nine months after receiving immunoablation and CD34-ASCT for life-threatening SLE. Results: The 21 year old male patient received immunoablation and CD34-ASCT in 2005 for persistent active SLE despite the usage of various immunosuppressants including cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate. Clinical and serologic remission was achieved within 1 month from ASCT and immunophenotypic analyses revealed the recurrence of thymic-na\u00efve CD31+ T cells, FoxP3 regulatory T cells, na\u00efve B cells with similar kinetics compared to other patients undergoing ASCT for SLE. While in persistent clinical and serologic remission he presented with signs of hemorrhage nine months after ASCT and factor VIII (fVIII) hemophilia was diagnosed with high titers of fVIII-inhibitor and fVIII-activity of 2%. Treatment regimens with cyclophosphamide, glucocorticoid pulse therapy combined with IVIG as well as B cell depletion and a combination of immunoadsorption and immunosuppressive therapy according to the modifi ed Bonn-Malm\u00f6 protocol failed to eradicate the fVIII-inhibitor. At 30 months after ASCT the patient suffered a complete clinical and serologic relapse of SLE. To our surprise, titers of fVIII-inhibitor completely vanished during the recurrence of ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies and were not detectable since then with persistent normalization of fVIII activity.",

Potthoff, H. Bertz, P. Hasselblatt, T. Baumert, C. Arnold, J. Finke University Hospital Freiburg (Freiburg, DE) Introduction: In about 5% chronic infl ammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are refractory to current medical or surgical treatment. Ubiquitous bacterial antigens are supposed to trigger an uncontrolled immune reaction in IBD based on a genetic predisposition (e.g. NOD2-gen mutations). Therefore it is intriguing to try to eliminate the disturbed immune reactions and to redevelop a better immunological tolerance. Methods: We used a two step approach towards autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (aPBSCT) in patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, immunosuppressors, antibiotics and anti-TNF-antibodies. Remission is induced with cyclophosphamide (2.0 g/m\u00b2/d on two successive days), and peripheral blood stem cells are harvested. APB-SCT is performed after high-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg bw/d on four successive days). Results: 8 patients were included in this pilot study. In the two patients with severe ulcerative colitis stem cell mobilisation therapy induced a transient clinical remission. In one patient colectomy was performed for safety reasons 4 months later. In the other one urgent colectomy was necessary after 8 weeks due to severe relapse. In all 6 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) mobilisation chemotherapy induced an endoscopical and clinical remission, which lasted between 2 and 18 months Two have a heterozygous mutation of the NOD-2-gene (3020insCmutation, C2104T mutation). In one of them, there was an early relapse in the terminal ileum. Resection was performed followed by maintenance therapy with budesonide and adalimumab. In the other patient with involvement of the total colon, after complete remission the sigmoid colon was resected due to a local relapse. After development of perianal abscesses and fi stulae surgical interventions must be performed. After healing of the fi stulae (prednisolone, antibiotics, adalimumab) aPBSCT will be performed. In two of the 6 patients with CD aPBSCT is scheduled for 02/2009.In two CD patients aPBSCT was performed 9 and 33 months after stem cell mobilization, respectively. This therapy induced a complete clinical, endoscopical and histological remission, which lasts 78 and 10 months, respectively, until now. Conclusions: Stem cell mobilisation with cyclophosphamide induces a transient remission in refractory IBD. High-dose cyclophosphamide followed by aPBSCT may lead to a longlasting steroid-free complete remission in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Background: The use of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as an option for severe, treatment refractory Crohn's disease has been shown in 2 studies to confer clinical benefi t. We report the summary of the UK experience to date: 5 transplants in 3 centres over the last 5 years. Methods: Between 2003 and 2007, 5 autologous stem cell transplants were performed on patients with a median age of 36 years (25-45 years), with severe Crohn's disease refractory to all available standard therapy. Stem cell mobilisation was achieved by a combination of cyclophosphamide and G-CSF in 4 patients and G-CSF alone in 1 patient. Pre transplant conditioning was achieved with a combination of ATG (total dose 7.5 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg). Response was measured endoscopically, and by calculation of the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Results: The median number of prior lines of medical treatment was 6 (range 5-8) and median number of prior surgical procedures was 5 (range 3-9). 3/5 patients were on long term PN pre ASCT. With a median FU of 27 months; 5/5 patients had clinical improvement in their disease activity. The median duration of response however was only 8 months (range 3-27 months) as defi ned by time from ASCT to next therapeutic intervention. In 4/5 patients CDAI was assessable and showed a reduction from a median score of 403 (220-550) pre transplant to 134 (120-183) at 6 months post transplant. In terms of transplant related complications 4/5 patients developed a febrile neutropenic event which was prolonged in 3/5 patients. No patient required Intensive care support. There were no procedure related deaths. Conclusion: Our experience suggests that ASCT may have a transient benefi cial role in treatment of severe, refractory Crohn's disease. Treatment-associated morbidity in this series was low with no procedural mortality. No patients attained a sustained remission and the duration of response varied considerably between patients involved in the study. The reasons behind this require further evaluation. It is possible that this represented a particularly resistant cohort of patients with Crohn's disease as evidenced by the need for prolonged PN and multiple previous surgical procedures. Interestingly all patients displayed an ameliorated form of relapse often localised with sensitivity to previously unsuccessful therapy suggesting some change in the biology of the disease.",

Bosi on behalf of Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo (GITMO) We evaluated the impact of pretransplantation transfusiondependency and serum ferrtin level on the outcome of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) receiving allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (allo-SCT). We studied 360 patients reported to the GITMO between 1997 and 2007. According to the WHO criteria, 23 patients were diagnosed as refractory anemia (RA) with or without ringed sideroblasts (6%), 61 patients as refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD; 17%), 53 patients as RA with excess blasts, type 1 (RAEB-1; 15%), 107 patients as RAEB-2 (30%) and 116 patients as AML from MDS (31%). There were 229 HLA-matched sibling and 131 unrelated donor SCT. The source of hematopoietic stem cells was peripheral blood in 224 patients and bone marrow in 136. Two hundred nineteen patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen, whereas a reduced-intensity regimen (RIC) was performed in 141 patients. Regular transfusion need was reported in 223 of 328 evaluable subjects (68%). Transfusion-dependency was independently associated with a reduced overall survival (OS, HR=1.48, P=.017) and increased probability of transplant-related mortality (TRM, HR=1.68, P=.024). The negative impact of transfusion-dependency on survival was noticed only in patients receiving myeloablative conditioning (OS HR 1.76, P=.003; TRM HR 1.70 P=.02) with an inverse relationship between severity of transfusion requirement and both OS (P=.022) and TRM (P=.021). In transfusion-dependent patients receiving myeloablative allo-SCT, pretransplantation serum ferritin level showed a signifi cant effect on OS (P=.02) and TRM (P=.04). This effect was maintained adjusting for both transfusion burden and duration (P=.038 and P=.04 for OS and TRM respectively), suggesting that the negative impact of transfusion-dependency might be determined at least in part by iron overload. Finally, transfusion-dependency was found to be an independent risk factor for acute graft versus host disease in a multivariate regression analysis (P=.04).",

Trenschel, N. Steckel, L. Kordelas, T. Gromke, A.H. Elmaagacli, C. Schulte, D. Beelen University Hospital of Essen (Essen, DE) The HCT-CI has gained interest as a predictor of transplant outcome especially in pts with MDS and AML. The HCT-CI classifi es MDS pts surviving a pre-existing solid tumor with 3 index points which leads to categorization to an adverse prognostic group according to the index stratifi cation (0 -2 versus >2). This may have consequences for decision making regarding transplant indications or procedures. We evaluated the results of 172 consecutive pts with primary MDS (N=131) or t-MDS arising from malignant lymphoma (N=24) or solid tumor (N=17) treatment, who underwent alloSCT during a 10-year period, for whom complete information of all disease features was available. Median age was 48 (16 -69) years (yrs) and was not different between primary and t-MDS. Eighty-two pts (48%) received transplants from HLA-identical sibling donors and 90 pts (52%) from matched unrelated donors after myeloablative conditioning regimens. Of the 131 pts with primary MDS, 96 pts had an HCT-CI of \u22642 (73%). In order to test, whether the HCT-CI adequately separates \"low risk\" primary MDS pts from t-MDS pts with \u2264 2 index points resulting from other comorbidities than the pre-existing malignant disease (n=30 [73%]), we compared these two cohorts in terms of major transplant outcome endpoints. This analysis revealed no differences between \"low risk\" primary and t-MDS pts with an overall 5-year OS estimate of 45% \u00b1 5% for primary and 40% \u00b1 9% for t-MDS pts (ns). In contrast, when \"high-risk\" pts of each cohort were compared, a signifi cantly inferior 5-year survival estimate for t-MDS could be demonstrated (34% \u00b1 9% vs. 0%, p < 0.006). This difference resulted from a signifi cantly higher 5-year estimate of TRM, which was 43% \u00b1 11% for \"high-risk\" primary MDS pts and 100% for \"high-risk\" t-MDS pts. Further, no differences in the outcome of pts with t-MDS arising from either malignant lymphoma or solid tumors was detectable after adjustment for the stratifi ed HCT-CI. In multivariate analysis the outstanding prognostic factor for OS and TRM was the pretransplant IPSS, whereas the HCT-CI reached no statistical signifi cance after adjustment for the IPSS. In summary, the HCT-CI may overestimate TRM of t-MDS pts with an otherwise \"low risk\" comorbidity profi le. This analysis suggests a prognostic heterogeneity of t-MDS pts which is best refl ected by the pretransplant IPSS. Therefore it appears questionable whether the HCT-CI alone allows valid prognostic stratifi cation in pts with t-MDS.",

We used a cut-off of 5% recipient cells to discriminate CC from MC, and analyzed MC as a predictor of MR. The sensitivity of CD33 PB and CD34 BM was 61% and 92%, respectively. The specifi city was 88% (CD33 PB) and 68% (CD 34 BM). CD34 BM was analyzed prior to MR in 6 relapsed patients. Five of these showed MC at a median time of 2,5 months (0,5-7) before MR. Eight of 18 patients had PB CD33 MC prior to MR with median of one month (0,5-2) before MR. Eight patients were treated with DLI due to MR. None of these resulted in CR. Another fi ve patients were treated with DLI due to MC of whom three are still in CR. Conclusion: CA is a useful method to predict relapse of MDS after SCT. CD34 MC over 5% is a highly sensitive method to predict relapse and may be combined with CA on PB CD33 to enhance specifi city. CA on PB alone is not suffi cient to predict relapse, probably due to the disease biology where apoptosis of marrow progenitors prevent these from entering the circulation. Refractory cytopenia (RC) of childhood is characterized by persistent cytopenia with less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow and less than 2% blasts in the blood. It is the most common subtype of MDS in childhood accounting for about half of the cases. Because early bone marrow failure can at least in part be mediated by T-cell immunosuppression of haematopoiesis, immunosuppressive therapy (IST) can be a successful therapy strategy for some children with RC. We have previously published the results of IST with antithymocyte globuline (ATG) and cyclosporine for childhood RC based on the recommendations for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) (Yoshimi A, et al. Haematologica 2007, 92:397) . Here, we present a longer-term follow-up (2.7 -7.8 years, mean 4.4 years) of the described cohort of 31 patients. Response to IST was evaluated according to a consensus between the Japanese and European Working Groups on SAA. In brief, response to treatment was defi ned as complete response (CR) if the following criteria were fulfi lled: ANC >1.5 x 10 9 /l, Hb > age-adjusted cut-off value, platelet count > 150 x 10 9 /l. In the absence of CR, PR was defi ned when all following criteria are fulfi lled: ANC> 0.5 x 10 9 /l, no platelet or red cell transfusion, platelet count >20 x 10 9 /l. At 12 months following IST, 5 patients (16%) were in CR and 16 (52%) in PR. This response rate is inferior to what had been described for SAA in the German study SAA 94 with 40% CR and 41% PR. At 60 months, data of 15 of the 31 RC patients were available: 7 patients were in CR, 3 in PR and 8 had relapsed or developed chromosomal abnormalities/increased blast count (clonal evolution). Defi ning toxic death, non-response, late response (later than 6 month after initiation of ATG), secondary non-response, and clonal evolution as event, 15/31 patients remained eventfree. Early or secondary non-response were the most frequent events (n = 11). Eight of the 22 patients defi ned as responders at 6 months experienced disease recurrence or clonal evolution. In total, 5 patients suffered clonal evolution. The estimated event-free survival at 60 months is 0.44% (0.33-0.54). Since the results of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from matched unrelated donors in RC indicate a cure rate of approximately 70% to 80%, it is reasonable to recommend that, in the presence of a suitable alternative donor, IST non-responders should proceed to HSCT early in the course of their disease.",

Lee Asan Medical Center, Ulsan University (Seoul, KR) International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score at diagnosis has been shown to be effective in predicting the outcomes of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but the signifi cance of IPSS score at the time of HCT has not been evaluated. Pretransplant comorbidity was recently shown to be an independent predictor of HCT outcomes in patients with a variety of hematologic diseases. We therefore analyzed the clinical signifi cance of IPSS score at the time of HCT and pre-transplant comorbidity in 68 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT for MDS (n=48) or acute myeloid leukemia evolved from MDS (n=20) between December 1995 and January 2008 at a single institute. Prior to HCT, 23 patients were given chemotherapy and 12 were in complete remission (CR) at the time of HCT. Conditioning regimen was busulfan-cyclophosphamide in 38, busulfanfl udarabine in 2, busulfan-fl udarabine-ATG in 24, and others in 4. Bone marrow was used for hematopoietic cell grafts in 48 and G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 20. The cumulative incidence of engraftment failure was 12.0% with primary failure in 2 and secondary failure in 6. During a median follow-up period of 41.0 months (range, 3.2 to 132.0 months), 27 patients died and 7 relapsed. Twenty-one deaths were not related to relapse of MDS. The 5-year probabilities of overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 60.0% and 57.4%, respectively, and the 5-year cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse were 32.7% and 9.9%, respectively. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that IPSS score at the time of HCT and pre-transplant comorbidity were signifi cant independent prognostic factors for OS, EFS, and NRM. Post-transplant outcomes were signifi cantly affected by the presence and severity of acute GVHD, but not by chronic GVHD. Patients who developed grade I or II acute graftversus-host disease (GVHD) showed superior outcomes, as assessed by OS, EFS, and NRM, compared with patients without acute GVHD or those with grade III or IV acute GVHD. No relapse occurred in patients who developed acute GVHD. In conclusion, IPSS score at the time of HCT and pre-transplant comorbidity may stratify the risk of post-transplant outcomes in MDS. Our results also indicate that graft-versus-MDS effects occur after allogeneic HCT.",

Robin (1) Aim: Analyse the outcome of patients older than 50 years who received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for MDS or AML, in Saint-Louis Hospital from January 1997 to December 2007. Method: 48 patients (pts) aged from 50 to 68 years (median: 56) received an HSCT for MDS (N=28) or AML (N=20) during this period. AML pts had intermediate (n=15) or high risk cytogenetics (n=3). 8 pts had failure to initial induction chemotherapy. FAB classifi cation for MDS was: RAEB (n=8), RAEBt (n=6), secondary AML (n=2) or refractory anemia (n=2). Maximal IPSS score was high, intermediate-2 and intermediate-1 in 11, 14 and 4 pts. there were no difference in bacterial and viral infections while there was a weak trend for more fungal infections (6% vs. 20%, p=0.2) among the Campath patients. Thymoglobulin treatment was associated with a higher proportion of T-lymphocytes at 6 months and a lower proportion of B-lymphocytes at 3, 6 and 12 months. No difference in IgG levels were seen between the two groups during the fi rst year after HSCT. Conclusion: Thymoglobulin and Campath as part of the conditioning produce similar results. Campath was associated with less overall acute GVHD without a higher relapse rate. Thymoglobulin lead to a higher proportion of T-lymphocytes and a lower proportion of B-lymphocytes.",

Castermans (1) Background: Nonmyeloablative conditioning followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is used in elderly patients with hematologic malignancies. It has been suspected that reconstitution of T-cell numbers would be impaired in elderly patients given nonmyeloablative conditioning because of age-related thymic atrophy. Here, we investigated long term lymphocyte reconstitution and thymic function in 64 patients given allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) after nonmyeloablative conditioning. Patients and Methods: Median age at transplant was 56 years (range 10-69). Conditioning regimen consisted of 2 Gy total body irradiation with or without added fl udarabine (n=57), or cyclophosphamide plus fl udarabine (n=7). Thirty-nine patients received grafts from related and 25 from unrelated donors. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Immune recovery was assessed between 1 and 6.5 years after HCT by signal-joint T-cell receptor excision circle (sjTREC) quantifi cation (211 samples), and fl ow cytometry. Further, in order to demonstrate a potential thymic recovery, sjTREC level changes from day 100 to day 365 were also assessed. Results: There was a close correlation between sjTREC levels and naive CD4+ T-cells (defi ned as CD4+CD45RA+) counts (P<0.0001). An inverse correlation was observed between the levels of sjTREC/ml and the recipient's age (R=-0.37, p<0.0001). Further, sjTREC levels increased signifi cantly from day 100 to 1 year after transplantation, this was more prominent in younger recipients (p<0.01 for patients <50; p=0.02 for patients 50-60) and absent in patients >60. Na\u00efve T-cell counts also increased signifi cantly over time. SjTREC levels still increased from 1 year to 2 years after HCT in patients < 50 years old (p=0.02). In multivariate analyses, younger patient age (P<0.001 and P=0.01), and absence of extensive chronic GVHD (P<0.001 and P=0.001) were the main factors associated with high sjTREC levels and high number of naive CD4+ T-cells after nonmyeloablative conditioning. Conclusions: Our data suggest that thymic neo-generation of T-cells occurred from day 100 in patients under 60. However, the levels of sjTREC remained low for patients above 60. Further, chronic GVHD has a dramatic impact on thymic function, as observed after myeloablative conditioning. The impact on sjTREC levels on infectious complications will be presented.",

Bethge (1) , T. Lange (2) Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens offers a potential curative therapy to patients with advanced indolent NHL. RIC HCT induces potent graft-versus-lymphoma effects, with best results in patients with low tumor burden at time of HCT. Combined use of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with RIC may increase anti-lymphoma activity of RIC. Forty patients have been enrolled in a multicenter phase II study of allogeneic HCT combining RIT using yttrium-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Y90-CD20, Zevalin) with 0.4 mCi (15 MBq)/kg on day -14 combined with RIC using fl udarabine (30 mg/m\u00b2 day -4 to -2) and 2 Gy TBI (day 0) followed by allogeneic HCT from matched related or unrelated donors. Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. Diagnoses were follicular lymphoma (n=17), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=13), mantle cell lymphoma (n=8), marginal zone lymphoma (n=1) and immunocytoma (n=1). Median age was 55 (range, 34-68) years. PBSC grafts were either from matched related (n=13) or matched unrelated donors (n=27). All patients were high risk with refractory disease or relapse after preceding autologous HCT. Disease stage at time of HCT was CR=7, PR=27, SD=6. Engraftment was rapid and sustained with no graft rejections. Median time to >500 granulocytes/\u00b5L was 15 (range, 0-69) days, and to >20000 platelets/\u00b5L 9 (range, 0-69) days. In 14 patients platelets never dropped below 20000/\u00b5L and in 8 patients granulocytes never below 500/\u00b5L, illustrating the non-myeloablative intensity of the conditioning regimen. TRM in the fi rst 100 days was 10% (n=4) and overall 35% (n=14). No additional toxicity due to RIT in comparison to our previous experience with the same RIC alone was observed. Incidence of grade II-IV GVHD was 40% (II=2, III=11, IV=3). To date, extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 9 patients. Deaths occurred due to infections=8, GVHD=6 and relapse=2. 24/40 (60%) of all patients are alive with a median follow up of 454 (range, 77-847) days, resulting in a Kaplan-Meier estimate 1 year survival of 62%. Disease status of patients alive is CR=16, PR=6 and Relapse=2. In conclusion, a combination of RIT with RIC is feasible with no additional toxicity due to RIT and with stable engraftment in all patients. Disease response and treatment related mortality seems promising even in this elderly and heavily pretreated cohort but requires further follow-up.",

Blaise Institut Paoli Calmettes (Marseille, FR) We report the outcome of 35 patients (pt) who received a Reduced intensity conditioning umbilical cord blood transplantation (RIC-UCBT) in a single centre between 2005 and 2008. All pt had high risk hematological malignancies (AML=19; ALL=9; NHL=5; CML=1; and Hodgkin disease=1). 27 pt (77%) were in CR (CR1=18; CR2=8; CR3=1), whereas 8 had a more advanced disease (PR=2; refractory=6) at time of UCBT. The median age was 44 (range, 17-62) years. For age we distinguished 2 groups: group 1 (n=13, age > 50 years) and group 2 (n=22, age \u2264 50 years). 13 pt (37%) received a single CB unit, whereas 22 (63%) received 2 CB units in order to achieve a minimum required cryopreserved cell dose of 3.0x107 TNC/kg.

Neutrophil engraftment occurred in 33 pt (94%) at a median of 20 (range, 6-45) days and a sustained platelet recovery was observed in 25 pt (71%) at a median of 36 (range, 23-136) days. The overall incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 54% (95%CI=[37-71]; 7 grade II, 10 grade III and 2 grade IV) and 37% for chronic GVHD (95%CI=[21-55]; 8 limited and 5 extensive cases) with no difference between the 2 groups. 21 pt (60%; 95%CI=[37-71] experienced at least one episode of a severe infectious complication (SINC) (virus, n=11; bacteria, n=10; fungal, n=4), requiring long-term hospitalization. With a median follow-up of 468 (95%CI=[201-681]; range, 50-1170) days, 10 pt (28%) had relapsed or progressed with this being signifi cantly lower in younger pt (P=0.045) and in those transplanted in CR (P=0.007).

Lambertenghi Deliliers (1) (1)University of Milan (Milan, IT); (2) Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico (Milan, IT); (3)Fondazione Matarelli (Milan, IT) Therapeutic options for pts with advanced tumor-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) and S\u00e9zary syndrome (SS) are very limited and mainly palliative. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) represents the only curative strategy in selected pts. However, because pts with MF/SS are often elderly and in poor conditions, high morbidity and mortality counterbalance survival benefi t. Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens signifi cantly decrease TRM, allowing gradual establishment of full donor chimerism and possible GVL effect. Evaluation of MRD is particularly useful to guide post-transplant strategies, such as DLI. Due to its extensive combinatorial repertoire and large hypervariable regions, rearrangements of TCRb represent the best target for MRD monitoring in T-cell malignancies. In our Institution, between 09/2000 and 12/2007, 13 pts underwent allo-HSCT from a HLA-identical sibling following a RIC regimen including fl udarabine/cyclophosphamide/TBI200 (up to 2001, 3 pts) or pentostatin/TBI200 (from 2002 to present, 10 pts). GVHD prophylaxis included Cy-A and MMF. At the time of transplant all pts (10 males and 3 females; median age 48 years, range 37-66) had stage III/IV refractory MF (n=9) or refractory SS (n=4). Median time from diagnosis to HSCT was 36 months (range 13-252). Source of stem cells was PB in all pts. Full donor chimerism was achieved in 38% of pts at day +30 and in 87% at 6 months. Clinical CR was obtained in 11 pts. Acute GvHD occurred in 7 pts (6 grade I-II and 1 grade IV); chronic GvHD (extensive in 2 cases) occurred in 6 pts. 4 pts have died, 2 in CR (1 from sepsis and 1 from aGVHD), and 2 with progressive disease. After a median follow-up of 43 months (range 2-99), 9 pts are alive and CR is maintained in 8 (Fig.1) . Skin biopsy and PB samples at diagnosis and at different time points after HSCT were obtained in 7/9 evaluable pts and monoclonal TCRb rearrangement has been sequenced obtaining clone-specifi c primers for PCR assays. Molecular remission was documented in all pts. 1 pt experienced clinical relapse 52 months after HSCT. Retrospective clone-specifi c analysis of TCRb rearrangements unveiled the presence of molecular relapse already 24 months before. Our results suggest that RIC-HSCT represents an effective strategy of cure in advanced stages of refractory MF/SS. Detection of MRD by TCRb analysis is feasible, allowing earlier identifi cation of relapses and possible adoption of pre-emptive treatment such as DLI.",

We have analysed whether pretransplant characteristics could predict full donor (FD)chimerism on whole blood(WB) and T-cells on day +90 and +180 and also the effect of the chimeric status on the transplant outcomes. This study included 70 patients with lymphoid (n=43) and myeloid (n=27) malignancies with a median age of 47 years (9-63). Median follow up was 22.3 months (range 2.2-49.6 months). Pretransplant characteristics included age, sex, donor type, previous stem cell transplant, CD34 dose, CD3 dose, disease status at transplant, alemtuzumab dose (50 vs. 100mg) and conditioning regimen. Multivariate analysis showed CD34 count was signifi cant in predicting FD T cell chimerism at 90 days (p=0.05). High CD3 cell dose (p=0.01) predicted FD whole blood chimerism at 90 days. High CD34 cell count (median 6.0 vs. 5.0, p=0.02) and type of donor (Unrelated vs. sibling: p=0.003) were predictors for FD chimerism at 180 days. FD T cell chimerism at 180 days was predicted by high CD34 count (p=0.02) and type of donor (Unrelated vs. sibling: p=0.006). Donor type (unrelated vs. sibling; 68% vs. 33%: p=0.01), high CD3 cell dose (median 130 vs. 2, p=0.0001) and dose of alemtuzumab (100mg vs 50mg p=0.006) were predictors for FD whole blood chimerism at 180 days. FD and mixed T cell chimerism at 90 days did not impact on overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), relapse free survival (RFS) and chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD). FD chimerism at 90 days (p=0.001) was associated with acute GvHD. T cell mixed chimerism at 180 days was a predictor for relapse (HR=7.6, p=0.02). Full donor whole blood chimerism at 180 days was a predictor for both acute (OR=3.3, p=0.04) and chronic GvHD (OR=4.6, p=0.02). However whole blood chimerism at 180 days did not impact OS, DFS, RFS and acute or chronic GvHD, but it showed a trend for increased relapse (HR=2.52, p=0.05). Our study revealed CD3 & CD34 cell dose along with unrelated donor type were predictors for whole blood & T cell chimerism at days +90 and +180 in reduced intensity alemtuzumab transplantats. It also showed donor chimerism may be a predictor for GvHD. More studies are warranted to understand the predictors for donor chimerism and to establish optimal transplant strategies.",

E.K. Nicholson, A. Clark, I.G. McQuaker, A.N. Parker, K.W. Douglas Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre (Glasgow, UK) In reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), minor-side ABO blood group incompatibility (mns-ABOi) can lead to delayed haemolysis of transplant vs no transplant (HR:0.62;CI%95:0.4-0.98) significantly affected OS. For pts who underwent an HSCT, disease phase at transplant was the most important factor affecting OS. In conclusion, by decreasing the length of the search (waiting for more than 3 months increases the probability of fi nding a donor of just 10%, while half of the pts relapse) the risk of relapse can be reduced, increasing the possibility of performing a transplant. To address the search at the same time for both VD and CB allows to increase the availability of stem cells for a transplant to be carried out prior to the median time of relapse, if the monitoring of the disease, during the search, shows an increased risk of disease recurrence. During the search of a donor for pts with HRALL, the major strategic factor must be considering \"the time\" of the transplant, more than the type of the transplant;according to this strategy, haploidentical transplant need to be considered.",

            "text": "Retrospective study of safety of peripheral blood stem cell donation by family members J. Wiersum-Osselton (1) Background: Donation of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) by relatives is widely practised. Family donors are sometimes accepted outside the age range and strict medical criteria which apply for unrelated donors and long-term follow-up (FU) is not routinely performed. This report describes a retrospective review of PBSC donations at a university hospital. Method: Case notes and laboratory results were examined of all 268 (115 female, F; average age 42.7) family PBSC donors in the period May 1996 to May 2006. Medical screening results were checked against the criteria for unrelated PBSC donation in The Netherlands and internationally (criteria of National Marrow Donor Program, NMDP). The dose of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for mobilisation was 10 ug/kg body weight subcutaneously for 5 days. In 2008 a FU questionnaire on health as well as of psychological aspects was sent to the donors. Results: 85 donors (32%; average age 50.8) would have been deferred (deferrable donors) under the NMDP criteria (n=49) or Dutch regulations (n= 36 of whom 12 only for age >55 years). A central venous catheter (CVC) was required in 20 donors (7%, 15 F, 10 deferrable). In 166 (62%, 57 F) collections one session was suffi cient. One deferrable donor mobilised insuffi ciently and donated bone marrow instead. Five serious adverse reactions occurred (2%; 3 in deferrable donors). These were symptoms of chest pain, severe pain requiring opiate treatment, extreme fatigue, inguinal vein thrombosis after CVC and severe pain at the injection sites. FU contacts were recorded for 216 donors (81%; 71 deferrable) 1-3 months after donation and for 160 (60%, 57 deferrable) also roughly 1 year (y) after donation. 5 donors are known to have died (3 deferrable). Mail was undeliverable to 6 abroad and 17 unknown at last recorded address. Ninety-nine responses were returned (41%; 32 from deferrable donors) on average 6.5 y after donation. Deferrable donors with late health data were on average 15 y older at donation and 14 y older at the time of late FU information. 6 malignancies (4 in deferrable group) and 9 cardiovascular diagnoses (7 in deferrable group) have occurred. Conclusion: PBSC donation after stimulation with G-CSF has an acceptable safety profi le but all donors should be carefully screened. The conditions seen in former donors seem chiefl y age-related. Prospective FU of donors and appropriate controls is needed to further document absence of long-term hazards.",

Zhu (2) (1)Zhejiang Uninversity School of Medicine (Hangzhou, CN); (2) Blood Center of Zhejiang Province (Hangzhou, CN) Natural killer (NK) cells are a subset of lymphocytes involved in primary immune response to recognize and mediate cytolysis of virus-infected, neoplastic and allogenic transplanted cells, without prior sensitization. Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are a family of inhibitory and activatory receptors and expressed by most NK cells. The interaction between KIR and HLA molecules expressed on target cells is known to modulate the cytolytic activity of NK cells. At present, 17 KIR genes have been identifi ed. The KIR gene family is polymorphic including genomic diversity and allelic polymorphism. The number of KIR gene loci has been reported to vary among individuals, resulting in a heterogeneous array of KIR genes in different populations. Here, we compare the KIR gene content and the genotypic structure of KIRs between two Chinese communities: East China (n=106) and Taiwanese (n=97). Methods: 203 DNA samples were studied by a low resolution PCR-SSP kit to identify all KIR genes. Results: All 17 KIR genes were observed in our two populations. Framework genes KIR2DL4, KIR3DL2, KIR3DL3 and KIR3DP1 were present in all individuals. The two populations had very similar frequencies for most loci, however, signifi cant differences were noted in the frequencies of KIR3DS1 and KIR2DS4*003. A total of 35 genotypes were identifi ed in the East China population and 29 genotypes in the Taiwanese population. The genotypes comprised of two homozygous groups. Group A haplotype, showed high frequencies in individuals from East China (45.3%) and Taiwanese (52.6%). Group A haplotype outnumbered group B haplotype in frequency by approximately 2.2:1 in the East China population and 3.0:1 in the Taiwanese population, respectively Some pairs of KIR show signifi cant positive and negative linkage disequilibrium. Conclusion: Our data demonstrated that there are some distinct in KIR gene frequencies, genotypes and LD between the two populations or communities, which shed light on a possible geographic genetic demarcation among different communities in China. The present study also provides a model to approach the effect of population migration on KIR genetic drift. It is very useful for knowing the KIR gene distribution in different communities or populations to select adaptable donors for unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",

Alessandrino Foundation IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo (Pavia, IT) To evaluate the effect of AB0 incompatibility on overall survival (OS), transplant-related mortality (TRM), relapse rate (RR) and post-transplant transfusion requirement (PTR) we analysed data of 421 consecutive adult patients with haematological malignancies (HM) who underwent allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a single centre from 1990 to 2007. Of 421 transplants, 285 (68%) were from a related donor, and 136 (32%) from a matched unrelated donor. Patients were classifi ed as high risk (n=229, with active disease), or as standard risk (n=192, with low risk MDS or HM in complete remission). As to AB0 compatibility, 255 donors (61%) were compatible, 68 (16%) major incompatible, 72 (17%) minor incompatible, and 26 (6%) bi-directional incompatible. In patients with major AB0 incompatibility, bone marrow haemopoietic stem cells (HSC) were prepared by red blood cells (RBC) removal by S294 separation on a Ficoll gradient; two patients with high isohaemagglutinins (IHA) titre had plasmaexchange at day -1 and day 0 before transplant. Conditioning regimen was myeloablative (MA) in 348 patients (83%) and reduced intensity in 73 (17%). In univariate analysis, patients who had host-derived antibodies against donor RBC antigens (major and bi-directional AB0 incompatibility) showed higher PTR (p<0.001), delayed neutrophil engraftment (p=0.01), more frequent occurrence of fever (p=0.01), higher TRM (p=0.009) and worse OS (p= 0.03). Platelets engraftment, days of hospitalization, acute Graft versus Host Disease and RR did not differ signifi cantly. We did not fi nd any association between IHA titre and PTR, OS, TRM and RR. As to conditioning regimens, our data showed a signifi cantly worse OS (p=0.03) and TRM (p=0.01) in patients with major or bi-directional incompatibility treated by MA conditioning. In multivariate analysis, the effect of AB0 incompatibility was not confi rmed as an independent risk factor; type of donor, status at transplant, and conditioning regimen were the only risk factors for OS, while TRM was affected by type of donor, status at transplant and HSC source. These data show that AB0 incompatibility does not infl uence OS, TRM and RR. However, patients with AB0 major or bi-directional mismatch have higher transfusion requirement, delayed neutrophil recovery and more frequent occurrence of fever.",

Brissot (1) The aim of this single centre report was to analyze factors associated with allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization and yield in a homogeneous caucasian population (n=95; 53% males) of healthy allogeneic adult donors. All donors received G-CSF dosed at 10 \u00b5g/kg/d for 5 days followed by large volume leukapheresis. Complete blood counts (WBC, Hb, Platelets) were measured for all donors at baseline before G-CSF administration, before and after PBSC collection. Peripheral blood CD34+ cell counts were also measured prior to apheresis. 69 donors (73%) were healthy sibling donors, while 26 (27%) were healthy volunteer donors for HLA-identical unrelated transplants. All donors were undergoing their fi rst PBSC mobilization. In this cohort, donors' demographic characteristics were as follow (median; range): age, 47 (18-81) years, weight, 69 (43-106) kg, height, 170(150-187) cm, body-mass index (BMI), 23.9 (15.2-35.7) kg/m\u00b2. As per institutional policy, the targeted total number of CD34+ stem cells was between 4 and 8 x10 6 /kg recipient body weight to be collected in a maximum of 3 apheresis sessions. Overall, the median number of collected CD34+ cells was 6.25 x10 6 /kg (range, 1.7-16.6), with 16 donors (17%) yielding less than 4 x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells. In univariate analysis, female gender, lower weight, height, pre-G-CSF and post G-CSF Hb levels, and low CD34+ cell counts prior to fi rst apheresis, were associated with signifi cantly lower total CD34+ stem cells yields (<6.25x10 6 /kg). In multivariate analysis, male donor gender and higher post-G-CSF CD34+ cell counts prior to the fi rst apheresis were most strongly associated with a higher total number of collected CD34+ stem cells (OR=6.17, 95%CI P=0.0001; and OR=3.95, ), P=0.004 respectively). Also, when considering the group of 16 \"poor\" mobilising donors (CD34+ stem cells yield <4 x10 6 /kg), in multivariate analysis, we found that a higher post-G-CSF CD34+ cell count prior to the fi rst apheresis was the strongest parameter signifi cantly associated with a higher total number of collected CD34+ stem cells (OR=6.36, 95%CI (1.68-24.15 ), P=0.006).",

Mir Rasekhian, I. Mohyedin, F. Raoofi , Z. Noori, H. Eshaghi, H. Yaghmaian, A. Ghavamzadeh HORCSCT (Tehran, IR) Objective: Placental Blood, as an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow reconstitution, has recently been shown to yield successful grafts in patients, especially children. In comparison to adult bone marrow transplantation, cord blood has the weak ability to induce severe graft-versus host disease (GvHD) and HLA-matched grafts engraft faster and reduce post-transplant morbidity and mortality. HLA Class I and Class II for 534 cord blood samples from Iran were types and the frequency of each allele were evaluated. Also we could fi nd the most frequent haplotypes in this population. Methods: In this study, 534 cord blood samples were collected from mothers with informed consent at shariati hospital. DNA of each sample was extracted using salting out method. HLA typing was performed using sequence specifi c primer (PCR/SSP) method. The frequency of alleles was evaluated. Results: Allele frequencies at six HLA Class I and Class II loci were evaluated. The most frequent alleles were A*02(36.51%), A*24(31.08%), B*35(41.94%), B*51(24.71%), DRB1*11(45.5%) and DRB1*04(24.71%) respectively. Common three-locus haplotypes in this population were A*24-B*35-DRB1*11, A*30-B*13, DRB1*07, A*33-B*14-DRB1*11 and A*11-B*35-DRB1*11. Conclusion: The HLA data of our study was similar with the other investigations on Iranian alleles which showed DRB1*07 and -*11 in Kurds and Azeris and DRB1*03 and -*11 in random Iranian population. In other races, the frequent alleles are different. For example in Japan there are A*02,-*30, B*07,-*35, DRB1*04,-*09 and in Jordan A*02,-*30, B*07,-*35, DRB1*03,-*07 and most frequent haplotype is A*30, B*07, DRB1*03. In China, A*24,-*02, B*46,-*13, DRB1*09,-*12 is common. In some previous report for USA, there are A*33-B*58, A*01, B*08, A*02, B*46 and A*11-B*40 haplotypes in different states. Neighbor-joining Tree in some articles shows Iran in vicinity to Italy and Greece which is concordant to HLA data. In Italy, A*30, B*42, DRB1*03,-*16 and in eastern Cicili DRB1*04,-*11 are the most frequent alleles. Comparison between this data of different countries helps to fi nd HLA-Match donor for patients with rare HLA alleles.",

Couban QE II Health Science Centre (Halifax, CA) APB transplantation is an established therapy several hematological malignancies. Collection of an adequate graft is a prerequisite for successful transplantation and higher CD34 cell counts are associated with improved outcomes. Many centres measure the concentration of CD34 cells in the patient's peripheral blood and proceed with collection only if the concentration is above a threshold level of 5 or 10 CD34 cells/ul. Experience at our centre indicated that several patients had excellent collections despite low CD34 concentrations in the peripheral blood. Between 2006-07, consecutive patients undergoing APB collection proceeded to standard volume autologous collection without consideration of the peripheral blood CD34 concentration. Daily apheresis continued until at least 2.0 million CD34 cells/kg were collected. Patients with myeloma were apheresed until 5 million CD34 cells/kg were collected if this were possible. There were 64 patients who underwent APB collection during this period, 34 with myeloma, 27 with lymphoma and 3 with other malignancies. There were 54 patients who underwent one set of collections, 10 patients who underwent 2 collections. The median number of apheresis procedures per patient was 2 (range: 1-7 procedures). Using a threshold of 2.0 million CD34 cells/kg, there were 53 successful collections of which 46 patients were completed with one attempt and 7 with 2 attempts. Among the patients who underwent successful collections, 15 of 53(28.3%) and 11 of 53(20.8%) would not have been collected if we had used a peripheral blood threshold of 10 CD34/ul or 5 CD34/ul, respectively. Of the 11 patients with collections < 2.0 million CD34/kg, none had a peripheral blood CD34 count > 10 and 1 had a peripheral blood CD34 count > 5. Ten patients with peripheral CD34 count < 10 cells/ul, underwent APB transplant. The median day to neutrophil recovery (ANC> 500 for 2 consecutive days) was 14 (range 9-19 days) and for platelets (platelet count >20,000 for 2 consecutive days) was 12 (range 11-21 days, 1 patient did not engraft platelets). 9 patients achieved 100days survival and one patient died on day 25. 38 patients with peripheral CD34 counts > 10 cells/ul underwent APB transplant. The median day to neutrophil recovery was 13 (range 7-21 days) and for platelets was 11 (0-16 days). All patients achieved 100days of survival. In conclusion, almost 30% of successfully collected patients had peripheral blood CD34 count < 10/ul.",

Beck University of Jena (Jena, DE) High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation is an established procedure in the treatment of oncological diseases in childhood. We investigated retrospectively the apheresis in our transplant center for infl uences on the stem cell yield. We analyzed 174 stem cell mobilizations and apheresis results of 130 patients. Indications were Neuroblastoma (n = 28), Ewing tumor (23), Hodgkin\u00b4s disease (14), Leukemia (34), Autoimmune disorders (14) and others disease. The average age was 11.1 years, with a gender distribution of 55% female and 45% male. The middle CD 34 yield was 6.1x10 6 /kg. In 69% the minimum required amount of 2x10 6 /kg and in 43% in the optimum amount of 5x10 6 /kg were collected. The collection began on average 12.5 days after the end of the chemotherapy and following 7.5 days of G-CSF stimulation. In 25 cases we were unable to collect after mobilization, because of insuffi cient blood CD 34. Mobilization at an early stage of the disease give better results for blood CD 34 on the beginning of the collection (68 vs 30/\u00b5l*, p<0,05) and for the collected CD 34 (12.9 vs 5.5 x10 6 *). Relapse-malignancies showed a lower yield of blood CD 34 (19 vs. 39/\u00b5l*) and collected stem cells (4.3 vs.7.5 x10 6 *). A previous radiation therapy also has a negative infl uence on the mobilization (19 vs. 37/\u00b5l) and collection (3.8 vs.7.4x10 6 *) of CD 34. There are also differences in collection and mobilization, depending on the malignancies and used cytostatics. The stimulation of G-CSF in a dose of 5-10 \u00b5g/kg showed higher blood CD 34 than stimulation with 10-15 \u00b5g/kg (38 vs. 22/\u00b5l*). Beginning the apheresis when blood CD 34 rise more than 20/ \u00b5l increases the success rate. In 95% we collected so a suffi cient number of CD 34. We fi nd overall good results for the collection of stem cells. But there is still plenty of potential to improve this expensive and complex procedure. Great infl uence has the time of the collection. As early as possible in the course of therapy without prior irradiation showed signifi cantly better results. Improving potential exists also in the process of mobilization. The effective use of G-CSF (5-10 \u00b5g/kg), and start the collection when enough blood CD 34 stimulated (> 20/\u00b5l), can increase stem cell yield and reduce costs. Taking into account these factors and in combination with individual approach stem cell mobilization can be improved and more effective collection results can be achieved.",

On the fi eld of HPC transplantation, JACIE has established standards of quality regarding medical and laboratory practice. However, compliance is diffi cult and few units in Europe have achieved S298 accreditation. Our transplant unit performs about 50 transplants a year, and it was accredited by JACIE in January 2004. Early this year, we became the fi rst European unit achieving JACIE re-accreditation. We believe that it is worth to show here our experience in the implementation and stabilization of a JACIE program in our Transplant Unit. Our quality management system (QMS) was designed according to a circular structure (plan -do -review -plan) which pursues continuous improvement in the HPC transplantation program; this design has been crucial for establishing and maintaining the JACIE standards.

Nguyen (1) We previously reported that NK-cell generated after haplo-SCT in high risk AML patients are characterized, during the fi rst 6 months post-SCT, by specifi c phenotypic features and impaired functioning having potential impact for transplantation outcome (Nguyen et al, Blood 2005) . In the present study, we examined the impact of INF-g on the impaired recognition of AML blasts by NK cells after haplo-SCT. We studied NK cells at 1 to 6 months (M1-M6; n=21patients) or at 24 months (M24; n=3 patients) post -SCT. Patients received CD34+ haplotransplant after a myeloablative conditionning regimen for high risk hematological diseases. As previously observed, the subset of CD56brightCD94/ NKG2A+ NK cells was increased and NK lysis of AML blasts was poor, suggesting an immature status of NK cells post transplant. However, at M24, CD56brightCD94/NKG2A+ NK subset and lytic functions restored and returned to donors levels. Blocking, ex vivo, the inhibitory CD94/NKG2A receptor on NK cells restored the lysis at M3 but not at M24. Higher level of intra-cellular IFN-g production was detected by FACS in CD94/ NKG2A+NK at M1-M6 as compared to the donors and at M24, after incubation with IL-12+IL-18 (70% vs 14%). IFN-g treatment led to higher surface expression of HLA-E on AML blasts, resulting in decreased killing by NK cells from healthy donors. Actually, adjonction of IFN-g on AML blasts inhibited the lysis by healthy donor NK cells (12% specifi c lysis with INF-g, vs 37% without INF-g). Blocking CD94/NKG2A restored the lysis previously inhibited by INF-g. Neutralization of INF-g during the interaction of NK cells post-SCT with mismatched AML blasts restored the lysis (16% lysis without INF-g neutralization versus 44% after IFN-g neutralization at M1). This effect was no more observed at M24 or in healthy donors. To conclude, increased secretion of INF-g by immature NK cells generated after haplo-SCT upregulates the cell surface expression of HLA-E on AML blasts. Increased HLA-E expression protects AML targets from NK-mediated lysis through the inhibitory CD94/NKG2A receptor which is overexpressed on NK cells during the early period post-SCT. This suggests that HLA-E could be a component of an immune escape strategy against NK attack on AML blasts currently observed after haplo-SCT. By contrast, at 2 years post-SCT and in donors, mature NK cells were functionally, which is encouraging to develop clinical trials using adoptive transfer of healthy donor alloreactive NK cells.",

Preliminary experiments also showed that blocking the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 by a PD-L1 antibody results in increased IFN-gamma production, if T cells are stimulated with PD-L1 expressing allogeneic dendritic cells (DC). By using fl ow cytometry we analyzed the expression of the PD-1 ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 on primary cells isolated from various human tissues. We detected strong PD-L1 expression on monocyte-derived DC, whereas staining was negative on B cells, hepatocytes and fi broblasts. One-third of acute myeloid leukemia blast samples expressed PD-L1, albeit with low staining intensity. We also found weak PD-L1 expression on renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC). The PD-L2 ligand was expressed only by DC and weakly by fi broblasts and PTEC. In conclusion, we demonstrate activation-induced PD-1 expression on human alloreactive CTL clones and analyzed the expression of its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 on primary cells of various human tissues. Early functional studies suggest that the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction infl uences the function of alloreactive CD8+ CTL in vitro. We believe that interfering with this negative regulatory pathway might be a novel therapeutic strategy to control GVH-reactive CD8 T cells in allograft recipients. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway might be also of relevance for graft rejection, where the induction of peripheral tolerance to the allotransplant is of paramount importance.",

GVHD incidence did not differ between pts who received a MAC or a RIC regimen. Two-year overall survival (OS) was 41% (95% CI: 26-57). OS and relapse-freesurvival (RFS) were similar after MAC or RIC regimen (OS: 29% vs 35% and RFS: 29% vs 30%). Short-term non-relapse mortality (NRM) was lower in patients who received a RIC as compared to patients who received a MAC regimen but was similar at long-term (6-month NRM = 21% vs 9% and 12-month NRM = 21 vs 19%). Patients with AML or MDS had similar OS and RFS (OS: 42 vs 41%; RFS: 37 vs 26% at 2 years for AML and MDS, respectively). NRM was not signifi cantly higher in pts with MDS (26 vs 10% at one year) whereas relapse rate was not signifi cantly higher in pts with AML (13 vs 6%). Conclusion: HSCT for AML or MDS after 50 years is a curative option for pts with related or unrelated HLA-identical donor regardless kind of conditioning regimen and co-morbidity at time of transplantation. Background: The combination of cytoreductive chemotherapy with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) is a highlyeffective anti-leukemic therapy. Since leukemic relapse after SCT still remains a major problem we are using Clofarabine/ Ara-C (ClaraC) treatment followed by RIC and allogeneic SCT to treat high risk leukemia.

Full chimerism was reached on day 14 (range 9-26). NK-cell engraftment was rapid reaching normal values on day 20 (median 248 CD16+56+3-cells/ \u00b5l, range 1-886) with NK cells comprising up to 70% of lymphocytes. T-cell reconstitution was impaired with 50 (range 0-586) and 200 (range 35-536) CD3+ cells/\u00b5l on day 60 and day 150, respectively. We observed an increase of CD3+8+ cells in contrast to CD3+4+ cells with a median of 41 (range 0-1277) vs 33 cells/\u00b5l (range 0-301) on day 80 and 247 (range 0-558) vs 175 (0-284) cells/\u00b5l on day 250, respectively.

B-cell reconstitution was delayed with 120 (range 0-489) and 181 (range 11-452) CD19+20+ cells/\u00b5l on days 150 and 400, respectively. TCR-Va-repertoire was analyzed in 15 and NK-cell receptor reconstitution in 8 patients. We found a skewed T-cell repertoire with oligoclonal T-cell expansions to day 100 and normalization after day 200. An increased NCR and NKG2A, but decreased NKG2D and KIR-expression was observed on NK-cells until day 100. In summary, after HHCT using CD3/CD19 depleted grafts, NK-cell reconstitution occurs early and fast while T-and B-cell reconstitution is delayed but seems faster compared to data published with CD34 selected grafts. A combination of reduced intensity conditioning with CD3/CD19 depleted grafts appears to accelerate the immune recovery after HHCT.

Conclusions: Our data did not show thus far a signifi cant correlation between Treg levels and occurrence of chronic GVHD. The association between Treg and TREC levels on days 100 and 365 might suggest a role for the thymus in regulating Tregs levels after HCT, or that similar factors affect thymic function and Treg levels after nonmyeloablative conditioning.

The mns-ABOi RIC transplants had a trend towards reduced OS of 297 days compared to 856 days for RIC without mns-ABOi (p=0.261). In contrast, among the MAC transplants (n=160), there was no difference in OS between mns-ABOi transplants (median OS 683 days; n=46) and non-mns-ABOi transplants (median OS 467 days; n=114; p=0.473).There was a higher proportion of VUD, HLA mismatch and older patients within the mns-ABOi RIC transplants as compared to the non-mns-ABOi RIC transplants which may contribute to the inferior OS seen. However, on considering only fully-HLA-matched sibling RIC allografts, there was still at trend towards inferior OS for mns-ABOi transplants",

            "title": "Conclusion: RIC alloSCT with intensifi ed fl udarabine regimen is associated with reduced early TRM and favourable OS and PFS in pts with advanced lymphoid malignancies non eligible for myeloablative regimens. Disease status and chronic GVHD seems to have a positive impact on OS. Efforts may be directed to identify patients who achieved response to previous regimens prior to move to RIC alloSCT. Background: In this retrospective analysis, we summarized our experience with RIC and MC after the fi rst HCT in patients (pts) with AML and CML in order to compare the longer-term outcome of these treatment procedures. Methods: 70 pts were transplanted during the 1998-2007 using PBSC from matched sibling donors. The RIC (37 pts) and MC (33 pts) groups were balanced regarding the diagnosis and disease stage. The RIC patients, however, signifi cantly differed from MC patients in median age (51 y vs. 35 y). The RIC consisted of fl udarabine (30 mg/m2/d; 5 days), busulfan (total dose 8-12 mg/kg), and ATG Fresenius (10 mg/kg/d; 4 days), posttransplant immunosuppression was mostly cyclosporine alone. The conventional regimen was busulfan (total dose 14-16 mg/ kg) + cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) followed by post-transplant cyclosporine and methotrexate. Results: The RIC vs. MC group had a median follow up 1561 (4,3 y) vs. 1898 days (5,2y), respectively. None or mild RRT was more frequent and severe RRT less frequent in RIC group in comparison with MC group (Tab 1). Eleven percent and 22% of patients in the RIC and MC group did not achieve a complete chimerism, usually for early disease progression. Median time to achievement a complete chimerism was 166 vs.108 days for RIC and MC, respectively. Concerning GvHD, the incidence and severity was less in the RIC group (Tab. 1). Nine/15 AML pts (60%) in RIC group relapsed and 6 of them died (40%), whereas 8/16 AML pts (50%) relapsed and 7 of them died (46%) in MC group. Twenty/22 (91%) RIC CML pts were alive, all in molecular remission (MR), versus 14/17 (82%) CML living pts from MC group. Whereas only 1/17 CML pts (6%) relapsed in MC group, 10/22 CML pts (45%) in RIC group relapsed (4 pts once) and 10/10 achieved new MR after treatments (DLI, imatinib, dasatinib, retransplantation) and 2/10 of them died (1 for new progression and 1 for GVHD after DLI). Mortality from any cause was 24% vs. 36%, NRM was 5% vs. 15%, early TRM was 5% (for disease progression) vs. 15%, late TRM was 5% vs. 3% for RIC and MC patients, respectively. Conclusion: Allogeneic SCT after RIC conditioning using Flu-Bu-ATG ( Fresenius) is well tolerated, after this procedure, all CML pts achieved CMR, however, quite frequent interventions for molecular relapses are required than conventional myeloablative regimen. This regimen can completely replace standard conditioning in AML pts. This work was supported by grant IGA MZ CR NS9683-4",

Pretransplant iron burden is a signifi cant contributor to transplant-related morbidity and mortality. This retrospective review is planned to assess the impact of pretransplant iron status on overall survival(OS) and transplant-related complications(TRC). Methods: The charts of 250 patients [M/F:162/88; median age 34(16-71)] who underwent HSCT[148 allogeneic (allo), 102 autologous (auto)] at Gazi University SCT Unit were retrospectively reviewed. Median follow-up was 315(1-1809) days. We evaluated the effect of IO, as measured by pretransplant serum iron, iron binding capacity, ferritin and transferrin saturation(TS) on survival, mortality and toxic-infectious complications. Results: Median pretransplant ferritin level was 576,2(2,1-26971)ng/ml [231,36",

Ausoni, S. De Matteis, V. Rufi ni, G. Leone,  S. Sica  Catholic University of Rome (Rome, IT)    Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a standard treatment for refractory or relapsed lymphoma. Defi ning response criteria based on conventional radiographic characteristics remains diffi cult because anatomical technique, as computed tomography (CT), cannot differentiate between active tumor and fi brosis. 18fl uorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET/CT), has been clinically accepted and widely use to optimize lymphoma restaging during and after chemotherapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of [18F]FDG-PET/CT to detect residual disease or early relapse after ASCT in order to design treatment intensifi cation or complementary radiotherapy. From December 2004 to June 2008 we enrolled 49 patients (31 males and 18 females, median age: 50 years, range 15-66) affected by lymphoma (16 large B cell, 10 follicular, 8 mantle cell, 2 anaplastic CD30, 5 peripheral T cell, 2 other subtypes and 6 Hodgkin's lymphoma). Patients were homogeneously treated with salvage chemotherapy and received ASCT, respectively 27 patients in CR, 17 patients in PR, and 5 in SD/PD.",

Kr\u00f6ger, T. de Witte on behalf of the MDS subcommittee of the Chronic Leukaemia Working Party of the EBMT Background: Standard treatment for MDS includes blood product transfusions, in some cases followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) after a standard myeloablative regimen. This treatment approach leads to considerable treatment-related morbidity and non-relapse mortality (NRM) during the fi rst 6 months after treatment with alloSCT. This increased mortality of transfused patients can partly be attributed to increased iron toxicity, caused by frequent erythrocyte transfusions, release of toxic iron radicals by the intensive treatment itself and its associated ineffective hematopoiesis and some other less well defi ned processes. Most information about iron overload and chelation originates from non-MDS patients. Therefore this study aims to quantify the effects of iron overload in MDS patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of data from the EBMT registry was carried out with an additional survey within EBMT centers, covering in total 206 adult MDS patients who were treated with alloSCT between 2000 and 2005. Only patients were included with alloSCT as their primary treatment, and who were classifi ed as MDS patients or as patients with MDS transformed to acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) at time of SCT. Results: 63 patients were categorized as refractory anaemia with or without ring sideroblasts (RA/RARS), 100 patients as RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), and 38 patients as RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) or sAML. The estimated 3-years NRM, relapse rate (RR), relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) for the whole group were 44%, 17%, 39% and 44%, respectively. Univariate analyses showed that RR, RFS and OS were signifi cantly infl uenced by disease classifi cation (p=0.02, p=0.004 and p=0.02). NRM was not infl uenced by disease stage (p=0.18). A low number of transfusions (<20) led to a decrease of the relapse risk (p=0.05). The other assessed variables, including age, donor type and the interval between diagnosis and SCT, had no signifi cant impact on all disease outcomes. The multivariate Cox-regression analyses showed again a signifi cant impact of disease classifi cation at SCT, but now for all endpoints, including NRM (p=0.04). An early SCT (interval between diagnose and disease < 6 months) correlated with an increased survival rate (p=0.04). Conclusion: These preliminary data show that disease stage has a signifi cant impact on outcome. More data are collected to quantify the impact of the number of transfusions and of iron toxicity.",

Benedetti Bone Marrow Transplant Unit (Verona, IT) Introduction Myelodisplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematologic malignancies with an elevated risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia. Conventional chemotherapy is unable to cure the disease. Allogeneic transplant is the only curative treatment, but very often it's not suitable because of age and comorbidities. Patients characteristics 47 consecutive pts with \"de novo\" and secondary MDS, including transformed acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) were treated between 1993 and 2007. At the diagnosis, according to the FAB, the pts were classifi ed as: 14 RA, 12 RAEB, 18 RAEB-T, CMML 1, SAA 1. According to WHO the same patients resulted classifi ed as: 1 RA, 12 RCMD, 6 RAEB-1, 11 RAEB-2, 3 MDS-U and 1 CMML. Median age was 51 years (range 11-66), M/F 26/21. When enrolled in the transplant program, 23/47 pts had already developed an overt leukemia. The median time of transformation to AML was 4.6 months Seventeen/23 of these pts (74%) were treated with at least one course of conventional chemotherapy. Nevertheless a complete remission was reached in a minority of pts. The conditioning regimen consisted of FTBI (200 cGy x 6) + CTX or BUCy for 35 pts. Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIT), including Thiotepa, Fludara, Cyclophosphamide, was chosen for 12 pts over 60 years or suffering comorbidities. The source of stem cells was identical sibling for 28 pts, unrelated donor for the remaining cases. Outcomes We observed 11/47 (23%) cases of transplant related mortality within 100 days (3 infections, 2 CNS bleeding, 2 Multi Organ Failure, 2 VOD, 2 acute GVHD), 8/11 cases in the group of pts treated with myeloablative regimens, and 3/11 in the RIT group. After day +100, relapse was the most important cause of death: 9 pts, 3 pts in RIC group and 6 in the group transplanted with conventional regimens, in most cases within 6 months. The overall incidence of acute GVHD of clinical grade >II, and the chronic GVHD, was 55% (26/47) and 26% (12/47), respectively. The overall survival (OS) was 47% (median follow-up 14 months). The sibling donor (28 cases) still seems the best source of stem cells: in fact, as compared with unrelated donor (18 cases), we obtained an OS of 53% and 33%, respectively. Conclusions Allogeneic HCT from a suitable HLA-matched donor is o good curative option for patients with MDS, including those with t-AML (about 50% of cured cases). Despite the elevated median age of these pts, an acceptable related mortality was observed.",

Bokhari, L. Watson, E. Das-Gupta, J. Byrne, N. Russell Nottingham City Hospital (Nottingham, UK) Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the favoured treatment for high risk leukemias and MDS, but its utlility is limited to younger fi tter patients. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have allowed older patients, often with co-morbidities, to undergo HSCT. The HCT-comorbidity index has been validated in predicting non-relapse mortality(NRM) in some studies comparing myeloablative versus RIC conditioning. Patients receiving RIC allografts are however very heterogenous as far as their co-morbidities are concerned and it is uncertain whether one can further delineate groups of RIC allograft recipients with signifi cantly different mortality and outcomes. This retrospective single centre study was done to assess the outcome of RIC transplants in patients with MDS and leukemia based on their co-morbidity scores in addition to other prognostic factors. 90 RIC allografts were performed between 2002 and 2008. Factors analysed in addition to HCT-comorbidity index were age of >60 years, disease status at transplant, CMV status, stem cell source and donor type(related/unrelated). The median age at transplant was 58.5 years(29-71.1) with a median follow-up of 23 months . The number of patients with scores 0-2 and \u22653 was 53 and 33 respectively(scores not available in 4). The commonest co-morbidity was moderate pulmonary function impairment. The overall survival(O.S) and NRM of the whole cohort was 51% and 28% at 2 years respectively. NRM of patients with HCT-CI of \u22653 was higher as compared to those with score 0-2 reaching statistical signifi cance both on uni-and multivariate analyses(p 0.02). Age >60 years was also a signifi cant factor on multivariate analysis affecting non-relapse mortality(p 0.01) as well as overall survival(p 0.004). Disease status at transplantation of CR2 or PR had a lower overall survival (p 0.001) but no signifi cant impact on NRM. None of the other factors were signifi cant. Hence, age of < or >60 years and HCT-co-morbidity index of < or \u22653 can be combined to further delineate RIC allograft recipients into 3 groups; group 1(age<60years and HCT-CI 2 or less), group 2(age>60 years and HCT-CI 2 or less) and group 3 (age >60 years and HCT-CI \u22653) with 2 year NRM of 8.4%, 40% and 55% respectively (p 0.001) and O.S of 76%, 40% and 30% respectively (p 0.01).This data confi rms the effi cacy of RIC allografts in group 1 patients but shows high NRM in other two groups in whom different treatment/conditioning strategies should be considered.",

Mattsson CAST (Stockholm, SE) Purpose: The prognostic value of CRP taken before conditioning for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation was evaluated in 503 patients transplanted at Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge. Patients: Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was given to 204 patients and conventional myeloablative conditioning (MAC) to 299 patients. Most patients (n=425) had a haematological malignancy while 78 patients had a non-malignant disease. An HLA-compatible related/unrelated donor was used in 196/229 cases and an HLA-A, -B or -DR mismatched donor in 78 cases.There were 287 males and 216 females with a median age of 36 years. Most patients (n=312) received PBSC while 155 were given BM and 36 CB. Results: Median level of CRP before conditioning among all patients were <10 mg/L (range <10-142). Increased CRP levels (>10 mg/L) were detected in 129 (26%) patients. Overall survival in the whole population was signifi cantly inferior in patients with increased CRP (63% vs. 53%, p<0.05). However, if analysing RIC and MAC separately, this difference only persisted among RIC patients (67% vs. 42%, p=0.004) while no difference was seen among MAC patients (61% vs. 63%, ns). Furthermore, in the RIC cohort, transplant-related-mortality (16% vs. 30%, p=0.036) and relapse-free survival (53% vs 27%, p=0.015) were worse in patients with increased CRP, while no difference in acute GVHD was seen. In multivariate analysis CRP still remained signifi cantly associated to OS (HR 1.62, CI 1.01-2.59, p<0.05), and RFS (HR 1.62, p=0.03) . No correlation between any outcome variable and CRP was seen among the MAC treated patients. Conclusion: CRP may be a good prognostic factor for outcome in allogeneic stem-cell transplantation after reduced intensity conditioning.",

Bethge (1), S. von Harsdorf (2) Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens offers a potential curative therapy to patients with advanced aggressive NHL. RIC HCT induces potent graft-versus-lymphoma effects with best results in patients with low tumor burden at time of HCT. Combined use of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with RIC may increase anti-lymphoma activity of RIC. In addition to the graft versus lymphoma effect, HCT provides rescue from hematologic toxicity of RIT which may allow dose escalation of RIT. 20 patients have been enrolled in a multicenter phase I/II dose escalation study of RIT using yttrium-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Y90-CD20, Zevalin) at two dose levels (0,6 (22 MBq) and 0,8 (30 MBq) mCi/kg) in 10 patients each, combined with RIC for treatment of patients with aggressive NHL. Patients received dosimetry with In111-CD20 on day -21 and RIT with an escalated dose of Y90-CD20 (0,6-0,8 mCi (22-30 MBq)/kg) on day -14 followed by RIC using fl udarabine (30 mg/m\u00b2 day -8 to -4), melphalan (140 mg/ m\u00b2 day -3) and alemtuzumab (20-30 mg day -3 to -2). For postgrafting immunosuppression cyclosporine was administered. Diagnoses were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=13), transformed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (n=4), blastoid mantle cell lymphoma (n=2) and follicular lymphoma grade 3 (n=1). Median age was 51 (range, 30-69) years. PBSC grafts were either from matched related (n=5) or matched unrelated donors (n=15). All patients were high risk with refractory disease or relapse after preceding autologous HCT. Disease status at time of HCT was CR=4, PR=15 and SD=1. No additional toxicity due to RIT was observed in comparison to our previous experience with the same RIC alone. Engraftment was rapid and sustained with no graft rejections. Median time to >500 granulocytes/ \u00b5L was 15 (range, 9-32) days and to >20000 platelets/\u00b5L 11 (range, 9-56) days. TRM at day +100 was 0% and overall 20%. Incidence of grade II-IV GVHD was 50% (II=8, III=1, IV=1). To date, chronic extensive GVHD occurred in 6 patients. Causes of death were relapse=6, suspected suicide=1, infection=3 and GVHD=1. 9/20 patients (45%) are alive with a median follow-up of 258 (range, 81-497) days. Disease status of patients alive is CR=7, PR=2 and Relapse=1. In conclusion, dose escalation of RIT and combined use with RIC is feasible with no additional toxicity due to RIT and with stable engraftment in all patients. Long-term disease-free survival remains to be determined.",

Nagler Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Tel-Hashomer, IL) Allogeneic SCT with both myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) is effective therapy in acute leukemia. To better defi ne the role of dose intensity in SCT, we retrospectively analyzed SCT outcomes in 356 consecutive adult patients (pts) with MDS/AML (n=277) and ALL (n=79) given SCT over an 8-year period in a single institution. The median age was 51 (range, 17-75) . The donors were HLA-matched siblings (n=191), matched unrelated (n=139) and alternative ( n=26). Pts meeting standard eligibility criteria were routinely given myeloablative conditioning (MAC, Cy/TBI or BuCy, n=141). Pts non-eligible for MAC were given either RIC (fl udarabine and reduced doses of busulfan or melphalan, n=116) or modifi ed myeloablative conditioning (modMAC, fl udarabine with myeloablative doses of busulfan or treosulfan, n=99). Disease status at SCT was CR1/ CR2 (n=176), previously untreated or untreated relapse (n=63) and chemo-refractory (n=117). With a median follow-up of 30 months (range 1-103), 159 pts are alive and 197 died; 75 of treatment-related causes and 122 of relapse. The estimated 5-yr overall survival (OS) in this relatively high-risk pt group was 34% (95%CI, 27-41). The status of disease at SCT was the most important factor predicting OS; 48, 31 and 16% for pts in CR, untreated or chemo-refractory leukemia, respectively (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis (MVA) identifi ed SCT not in CR, SCT from unrelated and alternative donors as adverse prognostic signs with hazard ratios (HR) of 2.7, 1.5, and 2.2, respectively. The conditioning regimen used was not a significant factor in the whole pt group with 5-yr OS of 38, 35 and 31% after MAC, modMAC and RIC, respectively (p=NS). However, RIC was associated with reduced OS in 2 subgroups. Among pts with MDS/AML given SCT not in CR, 5-yr OS was 34, 24 and 13% after MAC, modMAC and RIC, respectively (p=0.03) with HR of 1.6 for RIC in MVA. In the group of ALL pts, MVA identifi ed RIC and SCT not in CR1 as adverse prognostic signs with HR of 2.0 (p=0.04) and 2.0 (p=0.03), respectively. In conclusion, MAC should still be considered the standard of care for SCT in acute leukemia in eligible pts. RIC is associated with inferior outcome in pts with ALL and pts not in CR at SCT. Randomized studies are needed to determine the role of RIC in MDS/AML pts in CR at SCT. The novel modMAC regimens are relatively well tolerated even in pts not eligible for MAC and may be more effective than standard RIC in refractory disease.",

Ganser Hannover Medical School (Hannover, DE) P959 Improved outcome following reducedintensity conditioning for second allogeneic stem cell transplantation D. Nachbaur, J. Auberger, J. Clausen, B. Lindner Hematology and Oncology (Innsbruck, AT) Objectives: Second conventional myeloablative allogeneic transplants for patients relapsing after a fi rst allogeneic or P962 Reduced-intensity conditioning with fl udarabine/ cyclophosphamide has remarkably high activity in relapsed or refractory lymphoid malignancies F.S. Dijkstra, O. Visser, S. Zweegman, P.C. Huijgens, J.J.W.M. Janssen Vrije Universiteit (Amsterdam, NL) Several studies suggest that non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) has encouraging effi cacy in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. However, large series are lacking. Therefore we retrospectively analyzed data of 43 patients with indolent lymphoma (n=13), aggressive lymphoma (n=18: DLBCL n=3, MCL n=3, transformed follicular lymphoma n=10, ATLL n=1, Richters' transformation n=1) and B-CLL (n=12) receiving alloSCT after a fl udarabine/cyclophosphamide (Flu/Cy)-based conditioning regimen. Previous autologous stem cell transplants (autoSCT) had been performed in fi ve patients with indolent lymphoma and in six with aggressive lymphoma. Disease status at allotransplant was CR in 9, PR in 26, SD in 6 and chemoresistant disease in 2 patients. At a median follow-up of 653 days (range 98-2282 days) after transplantation, OS was 51.7% (95%-CI: 16.5%-86.9%), 2-yr PFS was 62% (95%-CI: 45.3%-78.8%) and 2-yr DFS was 55% (95%-CI: 36.3%-73.7%) No signifi cant differences in OS were found between the different patient groups. Overall survival according to having had a previous autologous SCT or not showed no signifi cant difference (P = 0.814). Six patients (14%) relapsed. Frequencies of grade III-IV acute and extensive chronic graft-vs-host disease were 16.3% and 51.1%, respectively. RIC with Flu/Cy therefore seems a feasible strategy in patients with lymphoid malignancies, with remarkably high activity in relapsed/refractory indolent as well as aggressive lymphoid neoplasms. Although autologous transplant(ASCT) is the election treatment in sensitive relapsed DLBCL other strategies are needed for those relapsing after ASCT or transplanted with active disease. From 1999 24 patients were included in these trials.18 (75%) had a DBLCL,3 (13%). Follicular grade 3 lymphoma, 2 (8%) a transformed MZL and 4% a BL Patients received fl udarabine 30 mg/m 2 IV ( 8 to 4) plus melfalan 70 -140 mg/m 2 (3 and 2); 12 patients (50%) enrolled in the latest trial received rituximab 375mg/m 2 ; on days -8,-1,+8 and +15 and CsA plus MTX 10mg/ m 2 (+1, +3, +6). Median age was 51 y (26-62); 4 patients (16%) were in >CR1 and 84% had active disease -10 (41%) sensitive and 10 (41%) refractory; median number of previous lines was 3 (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) and 43% had received a previous ASCT. Acute GVH was 37%(8% grade III-IV). 65% of patients at risk developed cGVH, (ext 59%). At day +100 21 patients were evaluated for response: 67% responded (13 CR and 1 PR) and 7(33% progressed); in the 20 patients transplanted with active disease 11 responded (55%) (10 CR and one PR, later converted into CR), 7 didn't respond (35%) and three (12%) were not evaluable due to early death. With a mfu of 35 months (range: 4-96 months), 8 patients (33%) are alive, 7 (29%), disease free and 16 (66%) died, 8(33%) due to progression and 7 (29%) due to NRM, 2 of them in progression. Median OS is 22 mo(1-58) with a projected OS at 5 years of 30% and a plateau from 44 mo; regarding DFS, median has not been reached and estimated DFS at 5 y is 56% with a plateau phase from 10 mo. NRM at 1 year is 20%. No variables infl uenced OS or DFS although patients receiving <4 or <4 lines has an OS of 32 months and 4 months. (NS). This is one of the largest reported series of Non Myeloablative allogeneic transplant in Aggressive B Cell lymphoma; our results with this intermediate conditioning including melfalan and fl udarabine \u00b1 Rituximab indicates a good response early after transplant, however most of the patients transplanted with progressive disease do not benefi ciate from this strategy; other approaches improving conditioning as well as perhaps some kind of maintenance will be tested in the future. Also a better control of acute and chonic GVH is needed. In summary, results are encouraging with a third of the patiens showing a long term disease control suggesting a clear graft versus Lymphoma effect (GVL) in patients with B aggressive histologies.",

Algarotti, C. Mic\u00f2, A. Salvi, C. Zanotti, A. Grassi, A. Rambaldi Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo (Bergamo, IT) Background: Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have been widely used to offer an allogeneic transplant to otherwise ineligible patients. Although well tolerated, RIC regimens are often associated with an increased proportion of disease relapse. We investigated a reduced toxicity conditioning regimen consisting of a myeloablative dose of Busulfan (3.2 mg/kg/day for 4 days) and Fludarabine (30mg/m\u00b2 for 4 days). Patients and Methods: From January 2006 to June 2008, 26 patients with a median age of 53 years and a diagnosis of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML,n=12), Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL,n=1), Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS,n=1), Multiple Myeloma (MM,n=7), Hodgkin's disease (HD, n=3) and non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL,n=2) entered this program. At the time of ASCT, 9 patients (5AML, 1ALL, 2NHL and 1HD) were in complete remission (CR), 7MM patients were all in 2nd good partial remission, 1HD patient was in partial remission while the remaining 9 patients (7AML, 1MDS and 1HD) had active disease. Results: The median dose of CD34+ and CD3+ cells infused was 4.4 x 106/kg and 202 x 106/kg, respectively. The median time to leukocyte and platelet engraftment was 16 days and 14 days respectively. At day +30, + 60 and +100 all the evaluable patients showed a full donor chimerism when BM mononuclear cells were tested. Peripheral blood CD4+ cells were of donor origin in 16/19 and 17/17 patients tested at day + 60 and +100 respectively. With a median follow-up of 370 days, 18 patients are alive (15 patients in CR, 3 with active disease) and 8 patients are dead. Fourteen patients experienced acute GVHD (grade I, n=4; grade II-IV, n=10) after a median of 47 days from ASCT. Disease relapse or progression occurred in 10 patients and was the primary cause of treatment failure. Only one patient died for a transplant-related reason (grade 4 acute GVHD). Among the 23 evaluable patients, a mild chronic GVHD was diagnosed in 7 while an extensive presentation was evident in 5 patients. Conclusion: The association of a myeloablative dose of Busulfan and Fludarabine confi rm its strong anti neoplastic activity and its remarkable tolerability in most patients who are ineligible to a full dose conditioning regimen because of age or comorbidities. Transplanted doses of T cell subsets are known to correlate with transplantation outcome. Among them, natural killer (NK) cells express anti-leukemic effect via alloreactivity and mitigate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However optimal dose of NK cells are not yet derived in non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST). Therefore we tried to evaluate the effect of the CD56+ cell dose on NST by giving additional CD56+ cells using immunomagnetic process. Nine patients were enrolled in the protocol from January 2005 to December 2006. Transplantation outcome was compared to 7 patients who did not consent the protocol during same period. All patients had AML or ALL or high degree MDS. HLA-identical siblings or unrelated donors were mobilized using G-CSF. All patients received whole leukapheresis product on Day 1, and purifi ed CD56+ cells from second day leukapheresis were given to Day 2. Selection of CD56+ cells were performed with CliniMACS system by manufacturer's protocol. Conditioning regimens were fl udarabine plus busulphan or fl udarabine plus idarubicin plus melphalan. All patients received cyclosporine A or tacrolimus for GVHD prophylaxis. The numbers of transplanted total nuclear cells showed no signifi cant difference (supplement group; 10.95x10 8 / kg, range 9.32-18.27, non-supplement group; 10.28x10 8 /kg, range 8.25-12.45). Also transplanted doses of CD3+, 4+, 8+ cells showed no statistical difference except for CD56+ doses (106.24x10 6 /kg, range 73.59-240.95 vs. 73.02x10 6 /kg, range 46.06-112.09; P=0.04). Ratio of CD56+ cells to CD34+ cells and CD3+ cell were higher in CD56+ supplemented group. Purity of CD56+ selection was mean 96.6% (range 93.1-98.9) and yield was mean 48.3% (range 28.8-82.3). Mean period to engraftment was earlier in CD56+ group but without statistical signifi cance (mean 12.5 to 14.7 days, P=0.2). Two cases of acute GVHD(>-grade 2) occurred in CD56+ group and one case in non-supplement group. Chronic GVHD (extensive) occurred in 5 cases and 2 cases in each group. Three patients in CD56+ supplement group relapsed but soon achieved CR after salvage treatment. Two patients relapsed in control group and died of disease progression. DFS showed no difference but OS was longer in CD56+ supplemented group. Out data had limits to show benefi ts of supplementary infusion of CD56+ lymphocyte in non-myeloablative transplantation. Optimal doses of NK cells and T cell subsets needs to be determined by larger scale data. The ideal stem cell donor registry should contain a young, healthy, and motivated donor pool with ethnic diversity refl ecting that of potential transplant recipients. Many ethnicities remain under-represented in major registries, and marked genetic diversity within some ethnic groups demands a higher ratio of registrants to recipients to insure successful donor searches. The Israeli population is ethnically diverse, with large numbers of second-generation emigres from Middle-Eastern countries, Ethiopia, Baltic States, etc., prompting us to diversify the ethnic representation within our national registry. To achieve this goal, we opened a single stem cell donor recruitment site at the Israeli National Armed Forces Induction Center (Israeli law mandates on-site registration of all potential military conscripts regardless of their eventual draft status). Information about the registry and stem cell donation was provided to all conscripts, but coercion to register was not sanctioned. 70% of eligible individuals agreed to participate, with higher registration rates among potential combat conscripts vs. non-combat inductees. Since May 2005, 80392 military conscripts have entered our registry vs. 121000 individuals recruited through costly and cumbersome volunteer donor drives organized in the civilian population during the same period (current registry size 388888 donors). The median age of donors in our registry dropped from 37 years in 2005 to 32 years (as of November 2008) since we have started conscript registration. We compared requests for donor confi rmatory typing (CT) between military and civilian donors as a surrogate for the \"matchability\" of these donors. During this period, CT requests were received for 953 out of 308496 civilian donors and for 302 out of 80392 military conscript donors, ratios of 0.31% and 0.38% (p<0.01 by chi squared). Specifi c data on ethnic representation is difficult to obtain as many conscripts listed \"Israeli\" or \"mixed\" (parents of different ethnicities) as their ethnicity. Nonetheless, we increased the number of Ethiopian donors from nearly none to nearly 2000. The decrease in median age of our donors contributes to a longer donor dwell time within the registry. Conscripts are a highly motivated population and are generally of robust health, increasing the likelihood that they will be willing and eligible stem cells donors. The higher frequency of matching in this population refl ects its ethnic diversity.",

            "text": "Natalizumab treatment modulates phenotypic profi le and expression of adhesion molecules in bone marrow and peripheral blood CD34+ cells of patients with multiple sclerosis U. Oelschl\u00e4gel, T. Ziemsen, C. Garten, M. Markgraf, G. Ehninger, M. Bornh\u00e4user University Hospital Dresden (Dresden, DE) Objective: The alpha 4 integrin inhibitor Natalizumab is used in the treatment of highly active multiple sclerosis (MS). Elevated CD34+ counts in peripheral blood have been described in MS patients during this treatment. In the present study CD34+ counts and expression of adhesion molecules on hematopoietic progenitor cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood of MS patients under Natalizumab (MS-BM, MS-PB) should be compared with those in healthy BM and mobilized blood after G-CSF stimulation. Methods: BM (n=11) and leucapheresis samples of (n=11) of healthy donors and BM (n=4) and PB (n=6) of MS patients were investigated fl ow cytometrically combining CD45 PerCP5.5/ CD34 APC with further antibodies in FITC and PE (CD11a, CD62-L, CD44, CD31, VLA4, CXCR4, or CD133). Measurements have been performed on a FACSCanto II. If possible, 2000 CD34+CD45dim cells with overall ca. 500,000 cells were measured. Results: Of note, the absolute CD34+ cell count was significantly higher in MS-BM compared to control samples (1334/ \u00b5l vs. 109/\u00b5l; p=0.0050). An elevated CD34+ count was also detectable in MS-PB vs. healthy steady-state PB (7/\u00b5l vs. <1/ \u00b5l). The expression of most adhesion molecules was lower in MS patients compared to healthy donors, BM: CD62-L 6% vs. 74% (p<0.05); CD11a 31% vs. 48% (p<0.05); PB: CD62-L 43% vs. 85% (p<0.01) and MFI of CD11a (p<0.05), CD31 (p<0.05), and CD44 (p<0.01). Remarkably, the CD133 expression on CD34+ cells was also clearly lower in MS-BM and PB (26% vs. 82%, p<0.01; 26% vs. 48%, p<0.01) compared to healthy donors. Repetitive measurements, done before and during 5 days after the 1st administration of Natalizumab in two patients, revealed the maximum CD34+ count between day 3 and 4. The blocking of VLA4 via Natalizumab was refl ected as a decrease in mean VLA4 fl uorescence intensity from 8157 before to 3526 at day 4. Furthermore, the expression of CD44 was also down regulated during the same time period. Conclusion: The mobilization of CD34+ cells in MS patients after Natalizumab administration in PB and even more in BM was shown to be accompanied by a down regulation of adhesion molecules. The lower CD133 expression suggests that a more mature progenitor subset is mobilized by this treatment. Further investigations should evaluate whether these differences correlate with distinct biological features and whether Natalizumab could be clinically useful as an adjuvant mobilization agent in heavily pretreated patients with hematologic diseases. The KIR genes (KIRs) and the HLA genes, located on different chromosomes, segregate independently of each other. Thus perfectly HLA-matched pairs are usually and typically mismatched for KIRs. Both activating (S-genes) and inhibitory (L-genes) KIRs probably infl uence the HSCT outcome and various studies suggest that number and/or composition of donor KIR genes repertoire may impact on transplant outcome. This suggests that number of KIRs might be the criterion of unrelated donor (UD) selection in cases with many HLA matched UD available; typically in patients with common HLA haplotypes, e.g. in the most frequent haplotype A1B8DR3 (also termed AH8.1). Methods: 41 unrelated individuals from the Czech National Marrow Donors Registry (CNMDR) with confi rmed HLA genotype A*0101-Cw*0701-B*0801-DRB1*0301-DQB1*0201 (PCR-SSP), i.e. unequivocally composed of the 2 AH 8.1 haplotypes, were genotyped for the complete set of 14 KIR genes and 2 pseudogenes. Results: 14 different KIR genotypes were found, with 9 (22%) occurred only once. The most frequent genotype found in 39% individuals corresponds to A haplotype homozygosity (AA). The remaining possessed more than 1 activating KIR and were either AB heterozygous or BB homozygous. All individuals possess inhibitory KIRs for self class I ligand (C1group) and only 4% lack either the 2DL1 or 3DL1, i.e. KIRs for not possessed inhibitory epitopes (i.e. C2 group and Bw4). Median number of all possessed KIRs was 9 (range 7-14), fi gures for S and L genes were 2 (1-6) and 7 (5-8). While AA genotypes individuals possess solely uniform 7 KIRs, AB/BB haplotypes were more heterogeneous -median of 11 KIRs (range 7-14), 13 different genotype observed. The L genes frequencies: 2DL4, 3DL1, 3DL2 and 3DL3 -100%, 2DL3-98%, 2DL1-95%, 2DL2-51%, 2DL5-37%. S gene frequencies: 2DS4-100%, 2DS2-51%, 2DS1-29%, 3DS1-27%, 2DS3-24% and 2DS5-17%. Conclusion: We confi rm the variability in terms of KIR genotypes and gene diversity even in individuals with most conserved HLA haplotype (A1B8DR8 homozygous). The selection of HLA matched UD according the KIRs contents could thus be applied in patients with common HLA phenotypes. The benefi ts of NK alloreactivity could be accomplished in such a group of patients where many perfectly HLA matched donors are usually available.",

To assess the effect of the search on the outcome of pts with HRALL, we analyzed prospectively 136 pts, median age 11 yrs (1-59), on search of an unrelated donor through the BMDWW Registry and Cord Blood (CB) Banks, between 1995 and 2008.

Fifty-one % of the 110 patients who entered into the study in CR showed a relapse at a median of 4 and 2 months from the start of the search for pts in I-II CR and >II CR, respectively. Of the 101 pts with a donor, 61% underwent a transplant: 25% in a more advanced phase compared to the start of the search; 35% of pts who started the search in relapse obtained a CR and underwent an HSCT. Therefore, 44% of pts failed to undergo a transplant because of lost eligibility due to disease progression. The 10-year probability of OS was 22.5%. Disease progression was the major cause of death.

            "text": "The importance of graft cell composition to outcome after allogeneic stem cell transplantation P. Svenberg, O. Ringd\u00e9n, M. Uzunel Karolinska University Hospital (Stockholm, SE) Background: Stem cell dose has been shown to be important for outcome in patients who undergo stem cell transplantation (SCT). Grafts may contain varying amounts of different cell populations like CD3+, CD19+, CD56+, CD4+ and CD8+ immunocompetent cells, whose role for clinical outcome is less clear. Patients and methods: We analyzed 591 patients who underwent SCT at Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge between 1998 to 2007 and correlated FACS results of the above mentioned cell populations to clinical outcome. Most patients (76%) had hematological malignancies. 58% of the patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen, 62% were given peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and in 58% of the transplants an unrelated donor was used. Results: As expected, PBSC contained much higher levels of all different cell populations as compared to BM. We found that patients reciving high numbers of CD4+, and CD8+ cells had signifi cantly more rapid engraftment. Also, a CD4+ level above 200 x 10(6)/kg was correlated to higher risk of developing acute GVHD grades II-IV (41%) as compared to patients receiving below this level (24%) (p<0,037). While the incidence of bacteria sepsis was lower in patients receiving a high number of cell dose (CD3, CD19, CD56), no correlation between cell dose and CMV reactivation was found. Relapse free-and overall survivals were not signifi cantly affected by the different cell populations. Conclusion: Grafts containing high numbers of CD4+ cells is a risk factor for developing severe acute GVHD but survival rates were not signifi cantly correlated to graft composition. Concerns exist about underutilization and underrepresentation of ethnic minorities on donors Registries. Some ethnic groups are poorly represented within the total number of donors leading to unequal access to stem cell transplantation for all patients in need. In fact some minority groups have rare and varied HLA combinations, therefore fi nding a match is more diffi cult than among Caucasian donors. As HLA-matching requirements are less stringent, cord blood (CB) may offer to minorities with rarer and more varied HLA types an increased chance of fi nding a compatible donor. Several factors contribute to discourage minorities from participating to donors program (lack of information about: benefi ts of transplantation, existence of registries, need for donors, risk of donation and the lack of opportunity to donate). Common barriers to donation can be addressed by educational strategies aimed at increasing knowledge and educating minorities about the importance to people of their ethnic background of becoming a donor, as a match is more likely within the same ethnic group. For this reason, a project of minority recruitment was initiated by our CB Bank in 2006 with the goal of increasing the number and genetic diversity of CB units available for matches. Initiatives included brochures and promotional materials that were distributed to donation centres at free costs. Education materials and informed consent were translated into fi ve languages (English, French, Spanish, Arab, Albanian) and carry complete information about the donation procedure and purpose. Here we evaluate the impact of such a strategy on implementing the ethnic diversity among our CB Bank. As a result of this programme (see the graphic), between 2006 and 2008, the number of non-Italians donors increased as referring to those coming from Europe but remained stable for those coming from extra-European countries. The proportional distribution of racial and ethnic groups among the CB collections is far away from approaching their proportional distribution in population. Further efforts are required to increase not only understanding of the need of CB donations for minority donors but also their motivation and opportunity to donate by establishing relationships with community centres in collaboration with bilingual translators and cultural mediators. Background: Data regarding the characteristics of graft cells products obtained by healthy infants are lacking. Objective: To compare the graft products obtained by infants with that obtained by young matched HLA-identical sibling donors for thalassemic recipients. Methods: Consecutive healthy infant donors(<24 months of age) and 99 young donors (3-53 years, median 15,1 years) undergoing bone marrow stem cells collection for their matched recipients entered the study. Main variables of interests analyzed were donor weight, patient weight and the ratio donor weight/patient weight in order to identifi ed great unfavourable differences between donors and recipients weights (ratio <1). Levels of CD34 cells and CD3 cells collected in the bone marrow donations were assessed and compared between the two study groups. Results: The weight of infant donors was signifi cantly less then the young donors (median 10.9 vs 43.5 Kg, p<0.001) and consequently the bone marrow volumes harvest were significantly smaller (median 258 ml vs 630 ml (p<0.001). Indeed we observed that the median weight recipient is rather two-fold greater then the respective infant donors (18,8 kg patients vs 10,9 kg donors) on the contrary in the young donor group the patient weight exceeds not much the half of the donor weights (26,8 kg patient vs 43,6 kg donors). In order to quantifi ed the unfavourable discrepancy between donor and recipients Allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) is a well-established treatment for several haematological malignancies. However, little is known regarding the real costs of this procedure in our setting. The aim of this study is to determine the total costs of alloHSCT in patients with haematological malignancies. Forty-three peripheral blood alloHSCT recipients were included in this analysis. We reviewed all clinical activity and categorized it by in-patient admission, out-patient visits, diagnostic procedures, laboratory tests, and medication use (divided by conditioning regimen drugs, antifungal prophylaxis and treatment drugs, and all other pharmacy expenditure). All costs were analysed for an initial period up to day +100 after alloHSCT. Unit costs for drugs were obtained from the hospital pharmacy and for all other resources from the Soikos database. All costs are expressed in Euros 2008. Transplant donor costs were not taken into account at this point. Patients in the study had a median age 52 (20-68), 58% were male, 30 had an MDS-AML, 6 a lymphoid malignancy, 4 CML, 3 ALL. Eighteen received a myeloablative conditioning and 25 a reduced intensity conditioning, 31 from a related and 12 from an unrelated donor. Median time to neutrophil engraftment was 17 days (13-33), and incidence of acute graft versus host disease grades II-IV was 30.2%. Patient overall survival at day +100 was 79%. Mean total cost per patient was \u20ac46,010. Hospitalization costs accounted for the majority of these (\u20ac21,727, 47% per patient), followed by drug costs (\u20ac14,210, 31% per patient) and diagnostic and laboratory tests costs (\u20ac10,072, 22% per patient). Mean conditioning treatment costs per patient were \u20ac1,882 (4%, \u20ac4,464 myeloablative conditioning costs -MAC-and \u20ac521 reduce intensity conditioning -RIC-), mean baseline disease drug costs per patient were \u20ac4,602 (10%) and mean fungal prophylaxis or treatment drug costs per patient were \u20ac7,727 (17%). Up to a 60% of all costs were incurred in the fi rst 30 days from hospitalization for alloSCT. Non pharmacological treatment costs accounted for 69% of all costs, mainly due to hospitalization costs (47%). Allogenic stem cell transplant poses a high burden on the patient and society, with total costs around \u20ac46,000 per patient for the fi rst 100 days.",

The alpha-chain of the IL-7R is polymorphic with the existence of 4 SNPs (+510C/T (rs1494558), +1237 A/G (rs1494555), 2087T/ C (rs6897932) and +3110A/G (rs3194051), that all give rise to amino acid substitutions. We previously found an association between donor +1237G and increased treatment related mortality (TRM) and acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) after matched unrelated donor (MUD) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as well as allergy. The C allele of +2087 has been associated with allergy and multiple sclerosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic signifi cance of IL-7Ra SNP genotypes in a large cohort of adults receiving MUD HCT for haematological malignancies. Patients and methods: 590 Caucasian adult (>18 years old) patients with AML (n=111), ALL (n=76), CML (n=373) or MDS (n=30) in early stage disease receiving a myeloablative conditioning regimen and an allele-level matched (HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1) T cell replete HCT from an unrelated Caucasian donor from the National Marrow Donor Program. IL-7Ra polymorphisms were determined by an SSP-PCR system in genomic DNA extracted from banked pre-transplant blood samples from the NMDP Research Repository. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for overall (OS), transplant-related mortality (TRM), relapse, and acute grades II-IV and III-IV and chronic GvHD, adjusting for clinical variables in the multivariate analysis. Results: Neither donor nor recipient SNP genotypes were signifi cantly associated with overall survival or TRM. Associations between donor SNP genotypes, relapse and GvHD are summarized in the table. Conclusion: Although the univariate analysis indicated an impact of the previously identifi ed risk alleles of SNP +2087 (C) and +1237 (G) of the donor on GvHD or relapse, this was not confi rmed in the multivariate analysis. Our study does not fi nd suffi cient evidence to support an association between the three examined IL-7Ra SNPs and adverse outcomes in MUD HCTs. (1) (",

Primary endpoints included proportion of complete correctors (i.e. patients reaching Hb \u2265 13 g/dL) before day 126 post-transplant and median time to achieve Hb correction in each arm. Results: In intent to treat analyses, the proportion of complete correctors was 24% in group 1, 81% in group 2 (P<0.001 compared with group 1), and 92% in group 3 (P<0.001 compared to group 1, and P=0.099 compared to group 2). Median time to achieve Hb \u2265 13 g/dL was not reached in group 1, 42 days in group 2 (P<0.001 compared to group 1), and 32 days in group 3 (P<0.001 compared to group 1 and P=0.127 compared to group 2). Mean \u00b1 standard deviation total doses of darbepoetin-alfa administered were 1,445 \u00b1 489 \u00b5g in group 2 vs 1,272 \u00b1 443 \u00b5g in group 3 (P=0.06). Eight patients (2 in group 1, 4 in group 2, and 2 in group 3) required red blood cell transfusions on study, including 4 patients following early disease progression. In per protocol analyses, the proportion of complete correctors was 21% in group 1, 80% in group 2 (P<0.001 compared with group 1), and 96% in group 3 (P<0.001 compared to group 1, and P=0.029 compared to group 2).

There was no difference in ferritin levels, nor in rates of thrombo-embolic events, or other complications among the groups. Conclusions: This is the fi rst prospective randomized trial demonstrating that darbepoetin alfa is safe and highly effective to ensure full erythroid reconstitution after autologous HCT when started on day 28 posttransplant.

Patients and methods. From September 2006 to March 2008, 80 patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors were enrolled in this phase II open-label randomized study. Conditioning regimens were different based on disease and preference of each center. Autologous PBSC were reinfused at day 0. PEG was administered subcutaneously at fi xed dose (6 mg) 24h after autologous stem cell infusion (day +1). FIL was administered subcutaneously at weight-based daily dose (5 mcg/kg/d) from day +1. The primary end points were duration of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, ANC < 0.5 x 10 9 /L) and the number of days to achieve an ANC > 0.5 x 10 9 /L starting from the days +1. Secondary end points were the number of days to achieve an ANC > 1.0 x 10 9 /L starting from the days +1, number of days with fever > 38 \u00b0C, duration of antibiotic therapy, and number of documented infections. Results. Patient and disease characteristics were reported in Table  1 . No differences were observed between the two groups (FIL vs PEG).

Fassas George Papanicolaou Hospital (Thessaloniki, GR) A G-CSF-associated risk of splenic rupture has been recognized in normal donors of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Limited information is available on the G-CSF effect in the presence of splenomegaly and extramedullary hemopoiesis as in thalassemia. Gene therapy (GT) has recently been postulated as a therapeutic potential for thalassemia and the mobilized autologous CD34+ cells may represent the preferable source of stem cells for genetic modifi cation due to the higher yield of HSCs compared to bone marrow harvest. An enlarged spleen may potentially pool HSCs from the periphery and negatively affect mobilization. We explored the G-CSF effect in a thalassemic mouse model (HBBth-3) as compared to a normal strain (C57Bl6), in terms of safety, mobilization effi cacy and distribution of HSCs among hematopoietic compartments. There was no death or clinical sequelae of splenic rupture in G-CSF-treated animals of either strain, however, at the time of sacrifi ce, hemorrhagic infarcts were detected only in the spleens of G-CSF-treated HBBth-3 mice (5/40). In contrast, the G-CSF effect on spleen size was stronger in the normal than in the thalassemic (thal) strain (133% vs 65% increase of the spleen volume over baseline). HBBth-3mice mobilized less effectively than C57Bl6 mice (Lin-sca-1+ckit+ cells/microl PBM-NCs:90\u00b155 vs 255\u00b1174, p=0.01/CFU-GM/ml PBMNCs:390\u00b1262 vs 1131\u00b1875, p=0.01) due to increased trapping of HSC and progenitor cells into the spleen (Lin-sca-1+ckit+cells/spleen: 487\u00b135 vs 109\u00b119.6, p=0.01/CFU-GM/spleen/102:1470\u00b1347 vs 530\u00b1425, p=0.0006). Splenectomy restored the mobilization profi ciency of thal mice at comparable levels to normal mice (Lin-sca-1+ckit+ cells/microl PBMNCs:164\u00b1111 vs 223\u00b199, p=ns) and resulted in the development of a hematopoietic compensatory mechanism in the steady-state liver of splenectomized thal mice which was greatly increased after G-CSF. G-CSF didn't signifi cantly affect Hb or reticulocytes in either strain when spleens were intact. However, G-CSF caused anemia after splenectomy in the C57 but not in the thal mice due to intense compensatory liver hemopoiesis. Our data imply that, in view of human GT for thalassemia, either multiple cycles of mobilization or alternative ways (ie AMD3100+G-CSF), may be required for a suffi cient yield of transplantable gene-modifi ed HSCs in non-splenectomized patients. Strategies also to reduce the risk of G-CSF-induced splenic infarcts should be explored in a clinical setting.",

Initial work also showed the strong correlation between S301 the A+ allel and HSC accommodation in marrow, refl ected by the granulocytes recovery (expressed as the day post transplant when the number of granulocytes exceeded 500/ul) in the group patients after autologous HSCT.

In total 162 recipients (40 auto and 122 alloHSCT) and 122 allogeneic donors were genotyped for SDF-1 alleles using a PCR-RFLP technique and digestion with MspI restriction enzyme. Number of transplanted CD34+ cells was associated with the pace of granulocytes and platelets recovery in autologous (R Spearman: -0.380; p<0.016 and -0.468, p<0.003 for granulocytes and platelets, respectively) and allogeneic (-0.369; p<0.0001 and -0.0357, p<0.0001) transplant recipients.

The multiple regression analyses (considering: patients' age and sex, number of transplanted CD34+ cells and SDF-1 polymorphism) confi rmed the independent association of the SDF-1-A allele and number of CD34+ cells in the graft (p=0.032) with granulocyte (p=0.049 and p=0.032) and platelet (p=0.027 and p=0.019) recovery after autoHSCT. In allogeneic transplant recipients, all AA+ carriers and only 72% of those having G allele (p=0.037) were among patients that recovered in granulocytes prior to 19 day post alloHSCT independently of number of transplanted CD34+ cells.In conclusion, the presence of the SDF-1-A allele facilitates the mobilization of CD34+ cells from bone marrow to peripheral circulation and (in addition to the number of CD34+ transplanted cells) also signifi cantly infl uences the hematological recovery of granulocytes and platelets in patients after HSCT.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) alone or in combination with CHT are standard procedures for mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). Recently the pegylated form of G-CSF has been introduced, that leads to a larger molecule with an increased half-life. While pegfi lgrastim is equivalent to daily fi lgrastim in enhancing neutrophil recovery, its effi cacy in PBSC collection is still under evaluation. From January 2006 to October 2008 37 patients (pts) with malignant lymphoma were eligible for stem cell mobilization and ASCT. They were relapsed or progressive disease or mantle-cell, T-cell lymphoma at diagnosis. Pts received DHAP-modifi ed schedule (ESHAP) as cytoreductive and mobilizing regimen. Twenty-four hours after the chemotherapy they received a dose of 6 mg of pegfi lgrastim. For the characteristics of pts see Table 1 . Peripheral CD34+ cell evaluation started from the increase of WBC above 1x10 9 /L. PBSC were collected using a Cobe Spectra separator. Leukapheresis started when the number of circulating CD34+ cells was >7microL and performed daily until target number of PBSC \u22652x10 6 was reached. All pts were considered for time to neutrophil and CD34+ cells recovery, as for the engrafment after high dose CHT. Thirty-fi ve pts (94%) performed successfully PBSC collection, that was completed after a single apheresis in 33 pts. The median time to a suffi cient number of CD34+ was 10 days (8-12 days). Two pts required an additional procedure, despite the satisfactory number of CD34+ circulating. At the time of harvest the median peak of absolute CD34+ cells in the PBL was 68 microL (range 7-252) and the median CD34+ cells collected for single patient were 9,4 x10 6 /Kg (range 2,4-47,6) . No failure at collection was recorded and 28 pts obtained an optimal harvest (>5,0x10 6 /Kg). Up to now 23 pts evaluable for engrafment after BEAM regimen engrafted. The median time of grade 4 neutropenia was 8 days (range 6-10 days) and the recovery of platelet \u226520 x10 9 /L was recorded in median 12 days after the reinfusion (range 8-21 days). Our experience showed that a single injection of pegfi lgrastim in combination with CHT is a valid procedure for mobilization of CD34+ cells into the PBL in pts with malignant lymphoma. Besides, a high percentage of pts (82%) obtained an optimal collection just with a single leukapheresis. Finally, the pegfi lgrastim-mobilized CD34+ cells induced rapid and sustained engrafment after myeloablative CHT.",

Lee Asan Medical Center (Seoul, KR) Results: Co-expression of multiple KIRs on NK cells was more frequent than expected from random association of independent events. Individuals having three or four of the major KIR ligands had similar frequencies of NK cells expressing multiple KIRs as those with only one KIR ligand. The distribution of self and nonself-KIRs at the cell surface refl ected a stochastic combination of receptors rather than a selection process conferred by cognate HLA class I molecules. Co-expression of KIR and NKG2A differed for individual KIRs but was independent on the presence of cognate HLA class I ligands. Together, these results indicate that KIR expression is independent of expression of cognate HLA class I ligands in the host and regulated by a stochastic process characterized by increasing expression probabilities during KIR acquisition. Conclusion: The results provide new insights into the formation of the KIR repertoire and argue against selection of human NK cells conferred by HLA class I molecules. Better knowledge on how inhibitory KIR repertoires are formed in new hematopoietic environments may have implications for how to interpret and exploit NK cell mediated alloreactivity in allogeneic stem cell transplantation. (1) Objectives: Transplantation over HLA barriers involving killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR)-HLA mismatch may trigger donor NK cell alloreactivity that contributes to graft-versus-leukemia effects and improved survival of patients with myeloid malignancies. Such effects have also been reported in HLA-matched stem cell transplantation (SCT) when donor NK cells express KIR for non-self HLA ligands. This is intriguing and indicates that mechanisms of NK cell tolerance and hyporesponsiveness may be set-aside during the post-transplantation period. Methods and results: To explore this possibility, we have performed a retrospective analysis of the outcome in a cohort of 110 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (n=82) and myelodysplastic syndrome (n=28), undergoing T cell-replete SCT with an HLA-matched sibling donor. Lack of ligands for donor inhibitory KIR had no effect on overall survival, incidence of relapse or graft-versus-host disease. Presence or absence of activating KIR genes in donors with KIR haplotype group B and A respectively, had no effect on outcome, nor did any specifi c activating KIR-HLA combination. In line with these clinical observations, functional analysis of the NK cell repertoire post SCT using multicolour fl owcytometry revealed maintained hyporesponsiveness of NK cells expressing inhibitory KIRs for non-self HLA ligands. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence against the emergence of an alloreactive NK cell repertoire in HLA-identical allogeneic SCT.",

Cuccia (1) (1)University of Pavia (Pavia, IT); (2)IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo (Pavia, IT) The search of compatible donors still represents the major limit to widespread use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Haploidentical siblings may provide an alternative transplant option when HLA-matched related donors are not available, the disadvantages being essentially the increased risk for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and graft rejection. In particular, ASCT from an inherited paternal HLA antigen (IPA)/ non inherited maternal antigen (NIMA)-mismatched donor has been previously demonstrated to be feasible decreasing GvHD and preserving graft-versus-leukaemia (GvL) effect. In fact, maternal cells passing the placenta during pregnancy express HLA molecules which are acknowledged by the foetus, who develops a tolerance to NIMAs maintained in adulthood. In the setting of unrelated ASCT, the maternal haplotypes are easily available for cord blood (CB) units while this information is not provided for adult donors. As NIMAs should be tolerated by the CB immune system, one can argue that the knowledge of the donor's NIMA haplotype (a third ghost haplotype) could further augment the chance for fi nding a compatible CB donor and reduce immune complications of ASCT. For this purpose we fi rst identifi ed the 9 most frequent NIMAs and inherited maternal alleles (IMAs) in the Cord Blood Bank of Pavia, aiming to establish if the NIMA haplotypes could be a common source of genotypic compatibility in our population. In our policy, low and high resolution DNA analysis was used to defi ne HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 alleles for each CB-mother couple participating to the CB banking program. Typing was performed by PCR-SSP and PCR-SSO. 6324 haplotypes for the HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 loci were considered retrospectively, corresponding to 1581 CB units and their mothers. The frequencies of HLA-A; -B;-DRB1 haplotypes were obtained by direct counting. 7 haplotypes out of the 9 most frequent were present both as NIMAs and IMAs, as shown in the graphic. In our population NIMAs appear to be neither rare genotypic combinations nor preferentially non-inherited haplotypes. Thus, the knowledge of the real tolerogenic potential of CB units, namely the third haplotype that is the NIMA one, may further increment the immunological privileges of this stem cell source, in particular for patients affected with non-malignant diseases for whom GvL effect is not relevant, while reduced GvHD is highly desirable.",

Smith, Z. McIver, N. Hensel, J. Melenhorst National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, US) Since lymphocytes do not normally encounter cells from unrelated individuals, it is presumed that alloresponses causing GVHD are mainly derived from na\u00efve T cells. However, memory cells may also participate in the alloresponse, following sensitization through pregnancy, or through cross-reactivity, against viral antigens. We used fl ow cytometry to track alloresponding T cell activation using CD38, and proliferation by CFSE dilution. Umbilical cord mononuclear cells (UCMC) from fi ve donors were stimulated with an irradiated pool of HLA-disparate donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (alloPBMC). By day 8, over 80% of the cells were CD38+CFSE dim, indicating na\u00efve T cells were alloresponsive. Next, PBMC from adult donors were negatively immunomagnetically sorted into subsets, using CD57+ and CD45RO+ for na\u00efve (N) cells, CD45RA+ and CD57+ for central memory (CM) cells, CD62L and CD57+ for effector-memory (EM) cells, and CD27+ and CD45RO+ for effector (E) cells. Adult N, CM and EM cells -and to a lesser extent, E cells -proliferated and acquired CD38 expression comparably to na\u00efve T cells, indicating that all subsets can be alloresponsive. Electronically sorted T cell subsets, stimulated with single donor alloPBMC confi rmed that CM + EM CD4+ and CD8+ T cells make proliferative alloresponses. PBMC subsets from 3 adults were then primed for 8 days with alloPBMC and tested for intracellular cytokine (IFNg; TNFa; IL-2) production after rechallenge with the pool. CD4+ and CD8+ N, CM + EM cells (but predominantly CM cells) generated cytokines after exposure to alloPBMC. While showing a proliferative response to stimulus with PBMC, UCMC only produced cytokines when rechallenged with CD3+ antigen presenting cells (with high costimulatory molecule expression) but not the original PBMC. These data confi rm that not only na\u00efve T cells from neonates and adults, but also adult memory T cells respond to alloPBMC. To directly assess if T cells specifi c for DNA viruses such as EBV cross-react with alloantigens, we stimulated PBMC from three adults with EBV lysates and immunomagnetically sorted CD137+ cells. Cells expanded for three weeks were rechallenged with EBV-negative alloPBMC. We found a small but signifi cant population of bi-reactive T cells producing IFNg or TNFa. These fi ndings indicate that in man alloresponses are not confi ned to a particular subsets of post-thymic T cells, and that strategies to prevent GVHD by na\u00efve T cell depletion may be ineffective.",

During the aplasia post BMT, we experienced a high incidence of refractoriness to platelets (plt) transfusions (trx). This is explained by the presence of anti HLA antibodies (abs) in patients transfused in countries using non leukodepleted blood units. Based on this, we set up a system (HLA specifi c trx) to identify the best plt donor by avoiding HLA antigens against which the patient had specifi c anti-HLA-abs. Patient characteristics: median age 8 years (range 2-17), 22 in Pesaro transplant risk class II, 25 in class III. Median number (MN) of blood trx pre BMT for class , class III: 101 (6-230). Plt refractoriness to trx defi ned as corrected count increment < 4,5 at 24 h post trx calculated as body surface*(post plt trx-pre plt trx)/number plt in transfused unit. All patients in class III were positive for anti HLA antibodies (MN 26, range: 9-54), whereas only 16/22 in class II (MN 18, . Trx of random plt to immunized patients resulted in 74% refractoriness compared to 25% in non immunized (p< 0.0001). Among immunized patients, splenectomized patients had a better plt trx outcome to random units (p < 0.01). In addition, patients with more then 26 anti-HLA-abs had a higher number of failed plt trx (82%) compared to patients with < 26 abs (64%), p< 0.01. When HLA specifi c trx were employed (in immunized patients only), 68% trx were successful, compared to 26% with random trx (p < 0.0001). When a plt donor negative for antigens against which the patient had specifi c abs was not identifi ed, 1 antigen mismatch was tolerated. Analysing trx outcome depending on the degree of HLA match and AB0 compatibility, we documented that full HLA match is probably better then 1 antigen mismatch (p=0.08) and that AB0 compatible units are probably better then incompatible (p < 0.4) and the best result is obtained when HLA matched and AB0 compatible plt were used (p< 0.07).",

            "text": "In conclusion, we documented a high incidence of anti-HLA-Abs in middle east thalassemia patients. In this setting, the use of HLA specifi c trx following BMT resulted in improved transfusion outcome, limitation of costs, fl uid overload and exposure to multiple donors. We suggest that this method is more effective and worth cost wise. HLA-DR15 is associated with autoimmune bone marrow failure syndromes such as aplastic anemia, and in this setting predicts response to immunosuppressive treatment. A particular susceptibility of DR15 expressing hematopoietic cells to autoimmune attack has therefore been suggested. We hypothesized that DR15 may also play a role in allo-immune effects after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In a datafi le of 7521 10/10 matched unrelated donor transplants contributed to the International Histocompatibility Working Group (IHWG) in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) we investigated rates of survival, disease relapse and acute GvHD in patients with or without DR15. Transplants facilitated by the Japan Marrow Donor Programme (JMDP, n=2569) were analyzed separately from non-JMDP (n=4952) transplants due to differences in the frequencies of the DR*1501 and 1502 alleles. DR15 was present in 46% of JMDP and 34% of non-JMDP transplants. Effects were analyzed for DR15, as well as for its most frequent alleles, DR*1501 (more prevalent in non-JMDP patients) and DR*1502 (more prevalent in JMDP patients). DR15+ and DR15-patients were well matched for disease stage, age at transplant, rates of T-cell depletion, matching of HLA-DP, and donor/recipient gender. No statistically signifi cant effects of the presence of DR15 were observed for survival, rates of relapse, incidence and severity of acute GvHD, with the exception of a small reduction in rates of grade II-IV aGvHD in DR15+ patients of borderline statistical signifi cance (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confi dence interval 0.79-0.99, p=0.03, see Figure 1 with univariate survival and cumulative incidence curves and Table 1 with adjusted hazard ratios). In conclusion, in a large population of well-matched unrelated donor transplants, the presence of HLA-DR15 did not impact survival, risk of disease relapse, or acute GvHD incidence and severity. These data suggest that DR15 does not appear to confer a special susceptibility to allo-immune effects in the setting of matched unrelated donor allogeneic HSCT.",

Hallek, H.P. Hansen University of Cologne (Cologne, DE) CD30, a member of the TNF receptor family, is preferentially expressed by activated or memory Th2 cells, regulatory T cells and NK cells but not by resting B cells or T cells. In the transplant setting, CD30 plays an important role for the balance between Th1/Th2 immune responses, modulating immune responses and tolerance induction. CD30 is cleaved by metalloproteinases and the ectodomain, soluble CD30 (sCD30), is released. In organ transplantation (heart, liver, kidney) several investigators documented the relevance of sCD30 in the peripheral blood as a predictive marker for allograft rejection. In fact, patients with high levels of sCD30 had a reduced graft survival. Considering these results, a signifi cant role of sCD30 also in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could be assumed. In our project we investigate sCD30 levels at different time points (day -1, day of engraftment, day 30, day 100, and in case of graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) development) in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The primary goal of this trial is the evaluation of possible correlations between sCD30 levels and immunologic reactions defi ned as GvHD or graft-versus-leukaemia effect. At this time, a total of 10 patients have been observed until day 100 (AML: 4 pts; ALL: 2 pts; CML: 2 pts; CLL: 1 pt; T-NHL: 1 pt). Several fi ndings emerge from this investigation: 1.) In all patients, levels of sCD30 at baseline (day -1) were low (mean 24,9 U \u00b1 9,44 U (SEM). 2.) There were 4 patients with no signs of GvHD until day 100. In these patients, no signifi cant changes in sCD30 levels were found. 3.) Mild to moderate GvHD which responded well to therapy did not show increased sCD30 levels. 4.) Two patients experienced high sCD30 levels. One patient developed severe lethal GvHD (CD30, min: 10 U; max: 134 U); the other patient had continuous moderate GvHD (CD30, min: 60 U; max: 145 U). 5.) One patient with mild GvHD showed elevated sCD30 levels in the relapse situation (CD30, min 10 U; max 70 U). In conclusion, these results suggest a critical role of sCD30 as predictive marker for immunologic reactions after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",
