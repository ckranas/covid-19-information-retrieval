Two potential problems exist with this pacing method: (1) Loss of atrioventricular (AV) synchrony and (2) Exacerbation of coexisting AV valve degeneration. The latter disease is prevalent in the breeds most commonly afflicted with SND. Pacing the right atrium would permit normal depolarization of the ventricle; however, placement of the lead in the right auricle is difficult in these small dogs. Moreover, assurance of adequate AV nodal conduction (AVNC) is required for atrial pacing alone. While dual chamber pacing offers ideal pacing with backup when AVNC is abnormal or questionable, cranial vena caval syndrome is a risk and synchronized ventricular contraction is lost. Therefore, atrial pacing with a single lead in a location that is technically feasible, after assurance of adequate AVNC, would be preferred in dogs with SND.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The objectives of this pilot study were to determine the Wenckebach point (WP) for the assessment of AVNC during a commonly used anesthesia protocol, and to assess the interatrial septum as an alternative site for atrial pacing in small dogs.

Lead dislodgement was detected in 2 dogs 24 hours after implantation and in 3 dogs at one month. The lead remained in position in only one dog. Following consultation with Medtronic implantation specialists, the problems identified were directed specifically to requirements of the 3830 lead: (1) Inadequate lead slack for this lead.

This pilot study provides initial data concerning the WP in normal dogs and information to optimize the method for atrial lead positioning. Symptomatic bradyarrhythmias unresponsive to medical therapy remain the most common indication for artificial cardiac pacing in canines. While the right ventricular apex (RVA) allows for easy endocardial placement of leads, there is mounting evidence of the detrimental effects of long term RVA cardiac pacing. During RVA pacing, the action sequence deviates significantly from normal and is associated with considerable depression of left ventricular (LV) function. One human study has shown that the LV adverse remodeling and deterioration of systolic function in patients with 3 rd -degree AV block is prevented by BiV pacing. Prior studies in dogs using tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) did not identify a statistical difference in LV synchronization between pacing sites, although there was a trend for more synchronization during BiV pacing.

Although it is well known that the prominent rhythm of the canine heart is a sinus arrhythmia, only recently has a nonsingular distribution (NSD) of beat intervals been documented leaving a region with a paucity of intervals (zone of avoidance, ZOA). This observation may be associated with the multicentric origin of the sinus node impulse; however, the latter cannot explain the mechanism of the NSD. Spontaneous discharge of the canine sinus node is under the influence of the autonomic nervous system, voltage clock (I f channel), and calcium clock (spontaneous release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum). Alterations in these factors have been implicated in sick sinus syndrome. The purpose of this study was to deconstruct specific components that influence the sinus node discharge in the ex vivo canine sinus node specifically to determine if (1) acetylcholine (ACH), (2) blockade of the calcium clock (via ryanodine) or (3) blockade of the voltage clock (via I f channel blockade with ZD7288) result in NSD with a ZOA.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Right atrial monophasic action potential (MAP) recordings and 2-site unipolar epicardial electrograms were made from perfused canine preparations with intact sinus nodes.

However, preps treated with ACH (2097 AE 390 ms) (one area < 95% with range 19-63%; P < 0.001) demonstrated NSD and the ZOA. These results demonstrate that the non-innervated inherent rhythm of the canine sinus node has a singular distribution, but treatment with ACH reproduced the distributions as seen in vivo. Moreover, specific blockade of the voltage clock or calcium clock did not recreate the in vivo distribution. ACH is known to affect both the voltage and calcium clock, thus, further studies whereby suppression of both clocks is needed to determine if the NSD is recreated. Reconstruction of the NSD and ZOA with ACH in the ex vivo model suggests that other physiologic factors are not in play.

Cats were enrolled at the time of admission for acute CHF due to any type of cardiomyopathy. BNP was analyzed during hospitalization and the CATCH questionnaire was administered to the owner prior to discharge. The questionnaire was re-administered 3 days after discharge by telephone. Finally, cats were re-evaluated 7-14 days after discharge when BNP was measured and the CATCH questionnaire was administered. Thirty-seven cats were enrolled in the study: 5 cats died or were euthanized before discharge, 1 was euthanized after discharge but before the final study visit, and one was lost to follow up. Therefore, 30 cats completed the study and were included in the final analysis. Mean (AESD) age was 10.7 AE 4.0 yrs, with 17 males and 13 females (all neutered).

Median BNP at baseline was 655 pmol/L (range, 188 to >1500 pmol/L) and was 583 pmol/L (range, 41 to >1500 pmol/L) when reassessed 7-14 days later (p = 0.59). Median QOL was 26 at baseline (range, 0-70; possible range of 0-80, with 80 being the worst perceived QOL), 19 (range, 0-61) at the time of discharge, and 19 (range, 2-49) 7-14 days after discharge (p = 0.66).

Heart rate evaluation is an important part of every exam and is routinely used in clinical decision making. In the hospital setting, heart rate is routinely assessed by auscultation. Ideally, inhospital heart rate would reflect the patient's heart rate at home.

Pimobendan is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor that has been shown to have positive survival benefits in dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF) due to myxomatous mitral valve degeneration (MMVD). Clinical trials of pimobendan in human patients have demonstrated a trend towards sudden death, which is presumed to be due to ventricular arrhythmia. The question of whether pimobendan therapy alters the incidence of cardiac arrhythmia in dogs with CHF has not been completely addressed. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether pimobendan therapy has any effect on the incidence of arrhythmias in small breed dogs with CHF due to MMVD. The secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of pimobendan therapy on quality of life scores and sleeping respiratory rates. Six small breed dogs (<15KG) with MMVD were recruited in a prospective double blinded cross over designed study. Each dog was treated with either pimobendan or placebo for two weeks followed by a one-week washout period, and then treated with the other medication for two weeks (placebo or pimobendan respectively). All dogs received standard background therapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril or benazepril) and furosemide as required throughout the study. Dogs requiring treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs were excluded from the study. For each dog, a 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitor was performed at baseline, after two weeks on pimobendan and after two weeks on placebo. Average heart rate, frequency of arrhythmia (ventricular and supraventricular) including single premature beats, couplets, and runs of tachycardia were recorded. Owners were instructed to complete a quality of life questionnaire at each time point, as well as record sleeping respiratory rates throughout the course of treatment. Frequency and type of arrhythmia were compared between baseline, placebo and pimobendan. No significant difference in frequency or type of arrhythmia was noted between baseline, pimobendan and placebo and there was no significant difference between quality of life or sleeping respiratory rate questionnaires between placebo and pimobendan. In conclusion, pimobendan does not appear to increase the incidence of cardiac arrhythmia in small breed dogs with CHF secondary to MMVD when compared to placebo.

Interestingly, two dogs of IIIb class were very severe CHF condition and died in 12 hours since first presentation. However, dP/dt maxs of two dogs were markedly increased compared to other dogs of IIIb class (4050 mmHg and 4741 mmHg each). The authors think that dP/dt index can be valuable indicator for survival of CHF. LASSBio294 is a new cardioactive prototype produced from safrole substrate, found in Brazilian plants like \"canela branca\" (Ocotea pretiosa), which showed positive inotropic and vasodilatory effects in in vitro and in vivo tests.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a multisystemic disease, and is not well known the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to hypertension frames. We evaluated the effects of systolic blood pressure (SBP) on the cardiac structure in dogs with VL. 37 dogs of various breeds (7 to 14 kg) with VL were stratified by SBP. 17 dogs with SBP to 129 mmHg shaped the G1, 10 dogs with SBP between 130 and 160 mmHg shaped the G2, and 10 dogs with SBP above 160 mmHg shaped the G3. Chest radiographic, ECG, echocardiographic, serum creatinine (SCr), urinary creatinine protein ratio (Up/c), electrolyte profile and renal excretion of calcium, phosphorus, sodium, phosphorus and magnesium, determination of serum aldosterone, troponin I, lactate dehydrogenase 1 (LDH1), creatine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB), and plasma renin, were measured in all dogs. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis Test followed by Dunnett's test for post-hoc comparisons; significance was set at P < 0.05. G3 dogs showed at echocardiographic examination increased of IVSd, PWD, ITEI, IVRT, FS, EF, IVS%, LVM. G3 dogs had higher SCr, Up/c, renal excretion of sodium, serum aldosterone, plasma renin, troponin I, CK-MB. Our results indicate that dogs of G3 with VL from this study considered hypertensive, develop changes in cardiac function and structure due to renal impairment. Additionally, the increase in SBP, aldosterone and renin, is suggestive activation of compensatory mechanisms in these dogs. Despite medical and surgical advances, short term survival rates in equine post-operative surgical colic patients have not sig-nificantly improved over the past 20 years. Although several markers for measuring global tissue perfusion are available, there are currently no practical measures of capillary microvascular perfusion in equine patients. In human patients with sepsis, early goal directed therapy aimed at improving microcapillary perfusion rather than global perfusion improves survival. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the technique of orthogonal spectral imaging (OPS) to visualise the capillary microvasculature in conscious normal horses and to assess the reliability of this technique. Images of the capillary microvasculature were obtained in six normal horses from the lip, gum and rectum by one operator on five days and four operators on one day and stored and analysed offline. Each video was assessed for quality and perfusion parameters to include proportion of perfused vessels (PPV), functional capillary density (FCD), microvascular flow index (MFI) and vessel density (VD). Data was normally distributed and analysed using ANOVA and ICC. All four operators were able to obtain all images at each site. Images of the gum were more difficult to obtain than the lip and rectum. Technique repeatability was average to good (ICC=0.4-0.6) for all measures except for FCD and VD measurements from the rectal mucosa (ICC<0.4). Technique reproducibility revealed 93% agreement between operators and was average to good (ICC=0.4-0.6) for all perfusion measurements except for FCD and VD from the rectal mucosa which was poor (ICC<0.2). Measurement repeatability revealed good agreement (ICC=0.6-0.88) across all measures of microvascular perfusion, Measurement reproducibility revealed agreement between analysers of 83% and was average to good for all measures of perfusion (ICC=0.4-0.73) except for MFI from the gum mucosa (ICC=0.2). Image quality was correlated with agreement; the better the image quality, the more likely the measure would be reliable. In conclusion, PPV was the most reliable technique across all sites to assess the mucosal microcirculation in normal conscious horses.

Orthogonal polarization spectral (OPS) imaging provides an opportunity to assess capillary microvascular perfusion in the horse by visualisation of mucosal blood flow. This technique may provide a useful outcome for early goal directed therapy in horses with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which may in turn affect outcomes in horses with severe intestinal pathology. In order to validate the technique in the horse, evidence is required to demonstrate that changes in intestinal perfusion result in changes in mucosal blood flow determined using OPS. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that changes in perfusion, caused by administration of the alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist detomidine, results in measurable changes in microvascular blood flow in horses that mirror known aberrations in total peripheral resistance (TPR) and cardiac output(CO). Microvascu-lar blood flow was recorded using OPS placed, manually, per rectum in six normal horses (weighting 603 AE 134 kg) undergoing sedation for a range of clinical procedures. OPS recordings were made prior to and after sedation (5, 10, 20 minutes) with detomidine (10ug/kg) and butorphanol (10 mg/kg) administered by intravenous injection. Microvascular perfusion was determined using standardised methods from OPS recordings including proportion of perfused vessels (PPV), functional capillary density (FCD), microvascular flow index (MFI) and vessel density (VD). Data was normally distributed, presented as mean (AESD), and differences between time points were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. There was a significant effect of detomidine on microvascular blood flow as demonstrated by changes in MFI, PPV and FCD five minutes after sedation (p < 0.001). Similar changes were effect demonstrated using VD 10 minutes after sedation (p < 0.02; Table 1 ). Microvascular had returned to pre-sedation values by 20 minutes as determined by all criterion. These data demonstrate that changes in organ perfusion that are known to be caused by the alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists result in observable changes in mucosal blood flow and appear to mirror changes in cardiac output and total peripheral resistance that have previously been demonstrated after administration of detomidine in the horse.

Although cardiovascular complications arising from metabolic diseases are widely recognized in humans, similar reports are lacking in horses. Both dysregulated glucose uptake, which is mediated by glucose transporters (GLUT), and inflammation contribute to diabetic cardiomyopathy. In particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines are implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and impaired glucose uptake. Toll-like receptors (TLR), which mitigate the innate immune response, also play a key role during inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. This study aimed to investigate pro-inflammatory cytokines, TLR signaling and regulation of glucose transport in the equine myocardium during hyperinsulinaemia. Horses were treated (48 h) with a prolonged, euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp (p-EHC) or balanced electrolytes (controls). Left ventricular protein extracts were analyzed by Western blotting for GLUT (1, 4, 8, 12) , TLR4, TNF-a and IL-6 expression. Heart rate remained unchanged from baseline values for both groups. GLUT isoforms were not altered by hyperinsulinaemia either at the cell membrane or in total lysates. Down-regulation of TLR4 from the cell membrane (by 77%, p < 0.05) occurred in p-EHC-treated horses, without a change in TNF-a or IL-6 protein content. To further investigate cardiac TLR4 expression during hyperinsulinaemic conditions in vitro, isolated myocytes (rat) were incubated with high doses of insulin, which also resulted in down-regulation of TLR4 protein content compared to basal conditions. The results suggest that, in the absence of obesity, hyperinsulinaemia may directly decrease TLR4 activation in the heart, which may reduce immune system capability. Investigation of cardiac TLR4 signaling in insulin-resistant horses is required to further elucidate this provocative finding. Critically ill foals often present with clinical evidence of volume depletion and tissue hypoperfusion, which is reflected by hy- perlactatemia. Aldosterone and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are essential to maintain blood pressure, electrolyte balance and organ perfusion. Several studies have investigated the association between blood L-lactate concentrations with severity of disease and mortality in septic humans, horses and foals. However, information on aldosterone and AVP as it relates to hypoperfusion and L-lactate concentrations in critically ill foals are minimal. We hypothesized that septic foals will have higher L-lactate, aldosterone and AVP concentrations compared to healthy foals. We also proposed that hyperlactatemia will be associated with hyperaldosteronemia, hypervasopressinemia, clinical and laboratory markers of hypovolemia and non-survival in hospitalized foals.

Equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE) in horses is caused by L. intracellularis, an obligate intracellular bacterium. Clinical signs of this disease can include a decreased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, and fever. Folate (FOL) and cobalamin (COB) play an important role in amino acid metabolism and in RNA and DNA synthesis and altered serum concentrations of these vitamins have been associated with gastrointestinal signs and systemic complications. Low serum COB concentrations are associated with increased serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentrations, which reflect the availability of COB on a cellular level.

Further investigation of NBB in foals is warranted. Toll-like receptors (TLR) not only play a central role in pathogen recognition by the innate immune system, but are also activated by endogenous ligands. TLR4 signalling stimulates proinflammatory cytokine release and plays a critical role in linking inflammation and metabolic disease. Although an association between equine laminitis and metabolic dysfunction has been proven, the disease pathogenesis is poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate TLR4 signaling in two models of insulininduced laminitis. Standardbred horses were treated with a prolonged-euglycaemic, hyperinsulinaemic clamp (p-EHC), hyperglycaemic clamp (HC) or balanced electrolytes (controls). Clamp-treated horses developed clinical (p-EHC) or subclinical (HC) laminitis, whereas controls did not. Skeletal muscle and lamellar protein extracts were analyzed by western blotting for TLR4, IL-6, TNF-a and suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS-3) expression. Increased lamellar TLR4 and TNF-a protein expression occurred without change in IL-6, although a trend (p = 0.09) for increased SOCS-3 content was noted, in p-EHC-treated horses compared to controls. In addition, lamellar SOCS3 protein content was positively correlated with TLR4 in p-EHC-treated horses (R 2 = 0.88, p < 0.05). The p-EHC and HC did not alter TLR signaling in skeletal muscle or lamellae respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study of equine lamellar TLR signaling. Activation of TLR4 signaling suggests that lamellar inflammatory pathways are activated by the clinical onset of insulin-induced laminitis, a finding consistent with histopathological reports. However, the lack of activated TLR signaling during subclinical laminitis does not support a role for proinflammatory cytokines in pre-clinical hyperinsulinaemic laminitis pathophysiology. Pneumonia is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in foals less than 6 months of age; however, adult horses, unless immunocompromised, are not as susceptible to such respiratory infections including Rhodococcus equi. We speculate that the pulmonary cytokine environment differs between the neonate and adult thereby imparting differing phenotypes to pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). This could result in differences of microbicidal activity between adult and foal pulmonary-alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) were performed in foals at week 1, month 1, month 6, and month 12 of age as well as in adults >6 years of age. Aliquots of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF; n = 12) were analyzed via a 300 cell count differential by a clinical pathologist. Foals at week 1, month 1, and month 2 showed an increased number of macrophages and significantly decreased number of lymphocytes as compared to month 12 samples and adult controls (p < 0.00001). Month 12 foals and adults had very similar cell populations (p < 0.5). PAMs from week 1, month 1, month 6 and month 12 (n = 3) were stimulated with and infected in vitro. Stimulants included LPS/IFNc, opsonized zymosan, and heat-killed R.equi antigen. Infection with R. equi was enumerated by dsRed and GFP fluorescence permitting concurrent measurement of reactive intermediates and bacterial load. Foals at week 1 exhibited lower levels of peryoxynitrite and superoxide production as compared to their counterparts at month 12 (p < 0.05). Consistent with our hypothesis, PAMs derived from foals yielded a higher bacterial load than in adults (n = 2; p < 0.01) indicating increased foal PAM susceptibility to R. equi infection. BALF (n = 4) was also analyzed for IFNc, IL-4, IL-10 via Luminex and TNFa via ELISA to analyze the role of age-associated cytokine milieu on macrophage phenotype. Results indicate an age associated increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFNc and TNFa) relative to anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) (p < 0.0001 for week 1 versus adult; p < 0.01 for month 1 versus adult). To further characterize the role of cytokines in susceptibility to infection, PAMs (n = 3 for each age) were stained for extracellular CD172a and for intracellular IL-4, IL-10 & IFNc for evaluation by flow cytometry. CD172a+ gated PAMs produced more IFNc but less IL-4 and IL-10 by 12 months of age (p < 0.1). The greatest difference in intracellular cytokine production (p < 0.02) was between the month 1 vs. month 12 age groups. Taken together, these critical differences indicate that foal PAMs are more susceptible to infection with Rhodococcus equi and support the notion that the pulmonary cytokine milieu impacts the microbicidal response of the macrophage. Strenuous exercise may be accompanied by endotoxemia, systemic pro-inflammatory changes and can also influence immune response. Exercise-induced inflammation has been studied in human and horses.

Bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal washes (NPW) and guttural pouch lavage (GPL) samples have been used for both diagnostic testing and the detection of carrier animals for Streptococcus equi (S. equi), but have had low sensitivity. Previous in vitro studies were performed to determine the optimal laboratory technique and the detection limit for S. equi cells in 0.9% NaCl. This field study compared the Copan TM flocked swab culture and the Copan TM flocked swab PCR methods with the results of a direct-PCR (gold standard) in 193 NPW and GPL clinical samples from sick (134) and not sick (59) (convalescing and subclinical) horses to verify the previous in vitro results. We hypothesized that: the direct-PCR would detect S. equi in NPW and GPL samples more reliably than flocked swab culture; that the flocked swab-PCR method would detect S. equi in NPW and GPL samples with equivalent frequency as direct-PCR; and that the flocked swab culture would detect S. equi in NPW and GPL samples more reliably than traditional culture. 35 samples were positive for S. equi via the gold standard (direct PCR). The direct PCR will be submitted to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute for consideration as a national standard operating procedure for the collection and processing of NPW and GPL samples for S. equi from horses. Neonatal Maladjustment Syndrome (NMS) is one of the most common diseases of the neonatal foal. Also called \"dummy foal syndrome,\" clinical signs range from disinterest in the mare and inability to nurse to obtundation, recumbency, and seizures. The pathophysiology of NMS is not fully understood, and has often been attributed to hypoxic damage to the brain induced by perinatal asphyxia. However, foals diagnosed with NMS do not always have a history of such events, or hypoxic histopathologic changes in the brain at necropsy. An alternate hypothesis for the pathogenesis of NMS is the persistence of high concentrations of pregnanes. Pregnanes, allosteric modulators of the GA-BAA receptor, are normally elevated at birth and decrease rapidly within 48 h. Foals with NMS have previously been shown to have persistently elevated plasma pregnane concentrations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "E-51 POOLING OF FECES AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES"}, {"text": "The aim of this prospective study was to induce clinical signs consistent with NMS by the infusion of the pregnenolone derivative allopregnanolone, and to report the resulting clinical signs and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings.

Idiopathic headshaking has been recognized for over a hundred years and is a spontaneously occurring nociceptive and potentially crippling disorder of mature horses. Typical headshaking behavior includes sudden, violent flicks of the head, excessive snorting, striking at the nose and trying to rub the nose on the thoracic limb or ground.

Serum creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) were measured 1-4 h before, and 4-6 h after, a game. Data related to possible risk factors for ER was collected using a face-to-face questionnaire. Acute ER was defined as a threefold or greater increase in CK from the pre-exercise level.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed for the management of lameness in horses. The beneficial effects of NSAIDs are achieved by inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, which catalyses the formation of pro-inflammatory prostanoids. Meloxicam (MEL), a COX-2 preferential agent, has been advocated for this purpose and previous studies by our group have demonstrated that the drug may be safer than less selective COX inhibitors. MEL has been demonstrated to be an effective anti-inflammatory in vitro and in vivo, however comparisons with drugs in more common usage are lacking.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u00df and TNF-a appear to play important roles in autoinflammation associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but underlying cellular mechanisms related to this process remain to be fully defined. Canine Degenerative myelopathy (DM) is a spontaneous large animal model of familial ALS of man and represents a valuable tool through which to evaluate the role of these pro-inflammatory cytokines in the neurodegenerative process. Here we quantify the expression of IL-1\u00df and TNF-a in conjunction with hsp70 (another potent stimulator of the innate immune response) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and spinal cord sections from control dogs and dogs with histopathologically confirmed DM. Concentrations of hsp70, IL-1\u00df and TNF-a in CSF were determined using high sensitivity ELISA, and protein expression in various regions of the spinal cord was determined by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) and quantified using Aperio Scanscope (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA). Concentrations of all three proteins were below the limit of assay detection in CSF for both normal (n = 10) and DM affected dogs (n = 10). Tissue analysis of IHC staining revealed enhanced hsp70 expression in ependymal cells of dogs with DM compared to controls (p = 0.003). IL-1\u00df and TNF-a staining was reduced in white matter of DM affected dogs, likely artifactual due to negative staining created by the pathology associated with DM. Based on these findings, hsp70 could serve as an important biomarker or trigger for sustained inflammation in DM and ALS and further research in this area is warranted. Canine degenerative myelopathy (DM) initially manifests as spastic upper motor neuron paraparesis with general proprioceptive ataxia (stage I) that progresses to paraplegia (stage II). Owners often elect euthanasia when their dog becomes nonam-bulatory paraparesis. When euthanasia is delayed, weakness spreads to the thoracic limbs (stage III) and lower motor neuron signs emerge as flaccid quadriplegia, widespread muscle atrophy and dysphagia (stage IV).

The aim of the study was to confirm that canine distemper virus (CDV) infection of ex vivo isolated monocytes leads to a substantial generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which contributes to the pathogenesis of demyelination in the acute phase of the CDV infection. During the acute phase of the CDV infection peripheral blood monocytes migrate to the central nervous system. Microglia and recruited monocytes/macrophages are capable to synthesize ROS that are cytotoxic particularly to oligodendrocytes which might be one underlying mechanism leading to demyelination.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "N-4 CLINICAL AND IMAGING FINDINGS ASSOCIATED WITH BRAIN HERNIATION IN DOGS AND CATS.

Sepsis and acute lung injury are associated with substantial and long-term cognitive impairment. Activation of microglia is a potential cause of this cognitive change. Syndecan-4, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), is selectively increased in the lungs of mice treated with E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and is a marker of classically activated (M1) macrophages. The objective of this study was to measure syndecan-4 gene expression in the brains of mice following systemic administration of LPS. We hypothesized that syndecan-4 limits the extent of inflammation in the cerebral cortex caused by inflammation secondary to systemic LPS. C57Bl/6 mice were administered intratracheal (IT) LPS at 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, and brain tissue was harvested at 6 h. Samples were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) (n = 6 mice/time). The amount of mRNA recovered was reported as a fold increase over 0 hour controls, and values were reported as mean AESEM. Our studies show an increase in TNFa (91 AE SEM fold) and syndecan-4 (3.1 AE SEM fold) expression at 6 hours in cerebral cortex following intratracheal LPS at a dose of 3 mg/kg. No significant changes in syndecan-4 or TNF-a mRNA were seen in young (8 to 12 week old) mice treated with 1 mg/kg IT LPS; however, old (10 to 12 month old) mice treated with 1 mg/kg IT LPS showed significant increased TNF-a (19.1 AE SEM fold) and syndecan-4 (3.8 AE SEM fold) gene expression in the cerebral cortex. In conclusion, we found that syndecan-4 gene expression is increased in cerebral cortex following IT LPS administration, which may indicate an antiinflammatory role of syndecan-4, and that the inflammatory response in the CNS following IT LPS is more pronounced in older as compared with younger mice. Future studies to clarify the role of microglia in the CNS inflammatory response to systemic administration of LPS and the potential for syndecan-4 to limit this inflammation will be pursued in syndecan-4 null mice and their littermate wild type controls.

Forty one to fifty-three per cent of all mammary tumours in dogs are malignant, with carcinoma being the most common malignant type. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in human tumours can be induced by growth factors, cytokines, oncogenes and other factors. Induction of COX-2 has been implicated in various cancers. Recently, systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by elevated circulating concentrations of acute phase proteins, has been shown to be independently associated with poorer survival in human patients with advanced cancer. Elevated C-reactive protein identifies tumours capable of producing significant amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, in particular interleukin-6, and therefore with the potential for more rapid growth of tumour cells.

Recent evidence in human cancer patients and rodent models suggests that the neutraceutical sulforaphane (typically found in raw cruciferous vegetables) may have utility in prevention of cisplatin induced renal toxicity, however there is little examination on its effects on cancer cells with or without conjunctive chemotherapeutics. To examine the potential safety and effects on canine cancer cells three canine cell lines were treated with a serial dilution of sulforaphane (0-50 uM) for 48 hours and 6 day growth curve assays were performed using MTT assays. Apoptosis was examined using annexin V staining, or caspase 3 immunoblotting. Further viability assays were performed to examine sulforaphane treatment in conjunction with either palladia (mast cells) or doxorubicin (osteosarcoma). Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc analysis or Student's T test to determine significance. Results suggest that all cell lines have reduced cell viability in both the 48 hour MTT proliferation and the growth curve analysis at between 2 and 3 uM of sulforaphane (p < 0.05) with apoptosis occurring in two of the three cell lines (mast cells and osteosarcoma cells) at concentrations between 10-20 uM. Sulforaphane did not promote cell survival nor did it promote further cell death in the face of other chemotherapeutic insults in mast or osteosarcoma cells. Further mechanisms for reduced cell viability are being examined, however sulforaphane does not confer a survival advantage for these cell lines making it a potential neutraceutical to investigate for chemotherapy-induced renal cytotoxicity. We previously described a population of lymphoid progenitor cells (LPCs) in canine lymphoma that persist in the xenotransplantation setting. Our hypothesis was that LPCs behave like tumor-initiating cells and that PSC-833, a selective inhibitor of the ATP binding cassette B1 transporter (ABCB1, a.k.a., p-glycoprotein/multidrug resistance protein-1) would sensitize them to doxorubicin and improve remission. Dogs with therapy-na\u20ac \u0131ve diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were eligible to participate. Twenty dogs were enrolled into a double-blinded, placebo controlled, multi-institutional study. The experimental and control groups received oral PSC-833 (7.5 mg/kg) or placebo twice daily for 5 days, respectively, followed by 5 doses of doxorubicin 21 days apart, with the first dose reduced to 21 mg/m 2 to mitigate potential side effects of ABCB1 inhibition. LPCs in lymph node biopsies and peripheral blood at diagnosis, at the end of neoadjuvant period, and 1-week after the first chemotherapy dose were quantified using flow cytometry. Interim data analyses show a trend to delayed progression in the PSC-833 group compared to placebo, and significantly delayed progression associated with stabilization or reduction in the percent of LPCs in lymph nodes at the end of the neoadjuvant therapy period. The relationship between ABCB1 + lymphoma cells and LPCs and the results from final analyses with censoring after 12-months of follow-up will be discussed.

Depending on concentrations, adiponectin can have positive or negative effects on cancer cell proliferation. The role of adiponectin and AdipoR in canine TCC is not known. The objective of this study was to determine expression of AdipoR1 in TCC cell lines and in tissues from normal canine bladder and primary and metastatic TCC.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "N-4 CLINICAL AND IMAGING FINDINGS ASSOCIATED WITH BRAIN HERNIATION IN DOGS AND CATS.

Dysregulation of adipokines is well known to be associated with visceral obesity; however, the literature contains no information regarding circulating levels of adipokines in dogs with naturally occurring hyperadrenocortism (HAC).

There were significant decreases in the levels of leptin, insulin, and cortisol after the treatment with trilostane; however, the mean leptin value in Group B after the treatment was still higher than that of Group A. This study revealed that the up-regulation of circulating leptin level in dogs with PDH might directly correlate with hypercortisolemia. In addition, these findings indicate that the dysregulation of adipokines is likely to be associated with complications in dogs with uncontrolled HAC. Chronic hypercortisolemia may primarily result in clinical signs and organs damages in consequence of glucocorticoid effects, and in kidneys it may cause the increase of glomerular filtration rate as well as of glomerular permeability, mostly causing renal proteinuria which is characterized by urinary proteins loss of high molecular weight proteins (HMWP > 60 kDa~albumin). However tubular damage may also be involved and the impairment of tubular reabsorption of filtered proteins is characterized by loss of low molecular weight proteins (LMWP). The aim of this study was to evaluate, sequentially, the urinary proteins patterns in dogs with pituitary dependent HAC, before and during the follow-up treatment with trilostane; the hypothesis is whether hypercortisolemia may be associated to the development of renal damage. Ten dogs (6 to 13 y-old) with HAC (diagnosis based on low-dose dexamethasone suppression or ACTH-stimulation tests and abdominal ultrasound) were studied and data were recorded before (T0) and during 60 (T1), 120 (T2) and 180 days (T3) of treatment. None of the HAC dogs had or developed arterial hypertension and/or azotemia. Exclusion criteria were any concomitant disease that could cause secondary renal disease or preor post-renal proteinuria. Control group was composed of 14 clinically normal adult dogs (punctual observation). Six HAC dogs had normal urinary protein-to creatinine ratio (Coomassie blue) (UPC < 0.5) before and during all the period of treatment and developed with good control. Four out of 10 HAC dogs showed increased UPC since before (ranging from 0.7 to 15.1) and along the treatment and had poor control. Qualitative evaluation of proteins (SDS-PAGE) revealed that all HAC dogs, before and during the course of the treatment, showed higher percentage of LMWP (T0 = 73.3 to 94.2% of total proteins; T1 = 61.2 to 100%; T2 = 59.3 to 100%; T3 = 60.0 to 100%) in comparison to clinically normal dogs that had equivalent percentage of HMWP (44.6%AE 12.5; meanAESEM) and LMWP (55.4%AE12.5) (unpaired t test; p < 0.05). Moreover, higher number of proteins bands of LMWP was also detected in all HAC dogs during follow-up, most variation of 5 to 8 bands, while control dogs had scare or 3 to 4 bands. Thus, the qualitative longitudinal evaluation of urinary proteins suggested that hypercortisolemia may be more associated to the development of tubular damage than glomerular, and that tubular alteration persisted during treatment of the period of this study, for dogs with good or poor control. Even for those four dogs with poor control that had increase of UPC, urinary LMWP predominated showing that qualitatively evaluation of proteins could provide more information regarding to the location of renal damage, and then adding more information for the better understanding of the effect of cortisol on kidneys. Hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) as a possible cause of a gallbladder (GB) mucocele has been recently described in dogs; however, there is currently a lack of evidence regarding the association between the two disorders.

Glucose tolerance tests are used in humans to diagnose prediabetes and diabetes, and are based on glucose concentration at 2 h following glucose administration. One in 150-400 domestic cats develop diabetes analogous to human type 2 diabetes, but tests for prediabetes and diabetes are not well characterized or commonly utilized in clinical practice. Thus, cats are usually not diagnosed until clinical disease is evident. Data suggests that dosing glucose per kg confounds glucose tolerance test results in obese dogs, causing higher peak (2 min) glucose concentrations, and subsequently higher values for glucose area under the curve, and higher absolute glucose concentrations.

Despite this, comparatively little is known as to how people are primarily exposed, and what (if any) health risk is associated with chronic, low-level exposure. It is hypothesized that house dust may represent a significant exposure route because PFCs can slough or volatilize from products used indoors, subsequently adsorbing to and accumulating within house dust. The purpose of this study was to determine if PFC serum levels in domestic cats tended to increase in proportion to time spent indoors and whether analyte patterns reflected that of food sources [e.g., fish products with high perfluoro-octane sulfonate (PFOS) but low perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS)] or with house dust (PFOS + PFHxS + perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) \u2500 with high PFHxS levels in the most contaminated dust).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "EN-19"}, {"text": "In 2008, serum was obtained from feral and pet cats presenting to shelters and clinics in the Raleigh, NC area, including the NCSU VTH.

Hence, cats may be ideal sentinels to better assess PFC exposure risk in children.

Following ! 18 h fast, a catheter was inserted into the cephalic vein. After 3 h, fasting glucose was measured from the ear or paw using the Abbott AlphaTRAK. Glucose (0.5 g/kg bwt) was administered i.v. over 30s and glucose measured at 2 min and 2 h. Reference intervals were determined after Box-Cox transformation and exclusion of outliers. The cutpoints were defined as the upper limits of the 95% reference intervals. Based on a priori knowledge that overweight and obese cats have abnormal glucose tolerance, cats of BCS 7-9/9 were excluded from the fasting and 2 h reference interval calculations. Reference intervals for Burmese were pooled with non-Burmese because the percentage differences of the medians and interquartile ranges for the sub-groups were 50% and 100%, respectively. Based on the 95% reference interval, the fasting glucose cutpoint for cats with BCS 6/9 (n = 44) was 6.3 mmol/L (113 mg/ dL); the associated 90% confidence interval was 6.1-6.5 mmol/L (110-117 mg/dL). 2/82 cats were classed as having impaired fasting glucose (BCS 5 and 7/9).

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a frequently diagnosed endocrinopathy in dogs with an increasing prevalence, challenging life-long management and frequent complications. Pancreatic islet transplantation is the only non-invasive, curative treatment for T1DM.

Total serum osmolality is comprised of effective osmoles, those solutes that exert a tonic effect and cause water to shift extracellularly, and ineffective osmoles, those solutes that do not exert a tonic effect. In health, the major contributors to osmolality include the monovalent ions, glucose, and urea. In certain disease states, the concentrations of various organic anions such as lactate, acetoacetate (AA), and b-hydroxybutryrate (BHB) rise and increase serum osmolality. However, it is unclear whether these solutes exert a tonic effect and contribute to serum tonicity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether lactate, AA, and BHB act as effective or ineffective osmoles in a canine red blood cell (RBC) model.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "EN-24 EVALUATION OF A HIGH YIELD TECHNIQUE"}, {"text": "Tonic effects of various solutes on RBCs were determined using an automated cell counting device (Scepter2.0, Millipore) to detect changes in RBC diameter (dRBC). RBCs were washed and acclimated in 300mOsM sodium chloride (NaCl) for 10 minutes. RBCs were then added to control or test solutions and incubated for 30 minutes prior to dRBC measurement. First, 50 mM of known effective (glucose) and ineffective (urea) osmoles were added to separate 300mOsM NaCl solutions and dRBCs compared to a control (300mOsM NaCl). Next, the tonic effects of organic anions were examined: dRBC of chloride (Cl), BHB, and lactate were compared in 300mOsM solutions of sodium (Na) salts; dRBC of Cl, AA, and lactate were also compared in 300mOsM solutions of lithium (Li) salts. The Wilcoxon rank test was used to compare dRBC between groups (a<0.05; n = 15). dRBC in urea was larger than in control (p = 0.014); dRBC in glucose was smaller than control but this difference was not statistically significant. Thus, ineffective osmoles cause an increase in dRBC and effective osmoles do not. For the organic anions, dRBC was larger in NaBHB (p < 0.001) and smaller in Na-lactate (p < 0.001) when compared with NaCl control. dRBC was larger in LiAA (p < 0.001) and Li-lactate (p = 0.003) when compared with LiCl control. In this model, BHB and AA act as ineffective osmoles and do not exert a tonic effect. In contrast, the tonic effect of lactate appears to be dependent on the associated cation. Diabetic nephropathy has become the most important cause of end-stage renal disease in human. Chronic hyperglycemia is the main component in the development of complications along the course of the disease. Long term complications are common in humans, such as diabetic nephropathy (DN), characterized mainly by glomerular lesions and proteinuria of loss of high molecular weight proteins (HMWP > 60 kDa~albumin). Initial changes include glomerular hyperfiltration and renal hyperperfusion. Morphological changes also may occur including thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, glomerular hypertrophy, mesangial and tubulointerstitium expansion. However, tubular damage may also be involved resulting in loss of low molecular weight proteins (LMWP < 60 kDa). In dogs, there are a few studies that investigated the relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and renal injury. The aim of this study was to sequentially evaluate the urinary proteins, quantitatively through urinary protein-to creatinine ratio (UPC; Coomassie Blue) and urinary albumin-to creatinine ratio (UAC; ELISA Immunology Consultants Laboratory) and qualitatively by SDS-PAGE during the course of DM in dogs, and to identify the segments of the nephrons that could be involved. Ten normotensive dogs with DM (age from 8 to 13 yr-old) had good fasting glycemia (252.9 AE 22.6 mg/dL; mean SEM) and were followed-up for 6 months (T1 to T6). Exclusion criteria were any other concomitant diseases that could cause renal secondary damage or pre-or post-renal proteinuria. Control group was composed of 14 clinically normal adult dogs (punctual observation). All diabetic dogs had UPC < 0.25 throughout the course (ranging from 0.07 to 0.25) and UAC ranged from 0.0 to 0.000801 (microalbuminuria = UAC 0.03 to 0.3). Thus, all diabetic dogs had normal values of UPC and UAC, and SDS-PAGE revealed that those diabetic dogs, in comparison to clinically normal dogs, had equivalent percentage of LMWP proteins (kruskal-wallis; p > 0.05) (diabetic dogs: T1 = 55.4 AE 8.0%; T2 = 61.9 AE 8.8%; T3 = 59.7 AE 10.5%; T4 = 67.0 AE 8.1%; T5 = 64.3 AE 4.6%; T6 = 52.4 AE 10.8%) with variation of 1 to 4 bands, while the control group had 55.4 AE 12.5% of LMWP (ranging from 19.7 to 64.7%) and 3 to 4 bands. Thus, the sequential evaluation of urinary proteins suggested that the diabetic dogs did not develop tubular or glomerular damage during this study. Furthermore, the good glycemic control may have contributed to prevent DN in dogs. Moreover, further studies in larger number of cases and longer period of observation should be conducted for the better understanding of mechanisms underlying renal injury that may be involved in DM dogs. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is one of many differentials for polydipsia and polyuria in cats. Response to synthetic AVP, desmopressin, is used to support a diagnosis of CDI but does not rule out psychogenic polydipsia. Etiology of CDI may be attributed to pathology of the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary or remain unknown. Over 50 mutations in arginine vasopressin (AVP) have been reported in humans with CDI.

AVP mutations do occur in cats with CDI and may have diagnostic potential. Primary idiopathic hypertriglyceridemia of Miniature Schnauzer (MS) is a frequent disorder. The genetic and metabolic causes remain unknown. MS dogs with hyperlipidemia can develop pancreatitis, seizures, vacuolar hepatopathy and diabetes, therefore early diagnosis is important.

Overall, thirty-one dogs (56.4%) had hyperlipidemia from which 13 had hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). Eleven dogs (20%) had hypercholesterolemia (HCOL) and seven (12.7%) had both HTG and HCOL. Medium serum concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol were 205.96 AE 313.83 mg/dL and 261.30 AE 127.18 mg/dL, respectively. A mild basal HTG (between 100-400 mg/dL) was found in 12 (21.8%) animals and 8 (14.5%) dogs presented a moderate to severe (TG > 400 mg/ dL) HTG.

The following histopathologic findings were recorded without concurrent pancreatitis: edema (1), fibrosis (5), cystic degeneration (4), atrophy (2), neoplasia (4), nodular hyperplasia (8 mild, 1 moderate), and islet amyloidosis (5). Two pancreata were normal. Combining AP and CP, the overall sensitivity and specificity were 48 and 54% for Spec fPL, and 41 and 62% for DGGR-lipase. When considering mild CP as clinically irrelevant, the overall sensitivity and specificity for pancreatitis were 60 and 54% for Spec fPL, and 60 and 63% for DGGR-lipase. Sensitivity and specificity for all forms of AP were 50 and 54% for Spec fPL, and 50 and 62% for DGGR-lipase. Sensitivity and specificity for severe AP were 67 and 57% for Spec fPL, and 67 and 64% for DGGR-lipase.

Recent molecular studies have revealed that the canine gastrointestinal tract (GIT) harbors a highly complex microbial ecosystem. Gut microbes play a very important role in the development and regulation of the host immune system, which is believed to be mediated in part through the production of immunomodulatory metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyrate, propionate, acetate). Alterations in the small intestinal microbiota of dogs with chronic enteropathies have recently been demonstrated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. However, limited information is available about any potential changes in the predominant bacterial groups in dogs with acute diarrhea. In previous studies, Blautia spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Faecalibacterium spp. have been shown to be abundant groups in the canine GIT and have been shown to be producers of immunomodulatory metabolites in humans and rodent models.

Stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality that affects 60-100% of critically ill human patients. The prevalence of SRMD in dogs is unknown but is expected to affect canines similarly. Critical illness disrupts gastroprotective mechanisms leading to the mucosal barrier dysfunction of SRMD. Traditionally, SRMD is treated using acid suppressants that increase gastric pH. Consequently, gastric bacterial proliferation predisposes patients to tracheobronchial colonization and pneumonia. Sucralfate, a sucrose/aluminum salt complex, does not increase the risk of these complications. We examined the protective effect of sucralfate on acid-injured ex vivo canine gastric mucosa, which exhibits similar barrier dysfunction as SRMD.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "GI"}, {"text": "Gastric antrum was collected immediately post-mortem from 17 random-source dogs scheduled for euthanasia by an animal control facility.

These findings suggest that sucralfate has utility in treatment of SRMD mediated by acid injury to gastric mucosa. Chronic diarrhea is an important and often frustrating condition in dogs and cats. While multifactorial, chronic diarrhea can be associated with profound changes in the intestinal microbiome, which might play critical roles in causing or potentiating disease.

Little information is only available on the role of adipokines in the development and progression of acute pancreatitis (AP) in dogs. In human medicine, it has been shown that among the adipokines, resistin stimulates inflammatory cytokine(s) expression, and conversely is up-regulated by those cytokines.

The clinical impact of transfusing red blood cells (RBCs) after longer durations of storage is a major issue in human transfusion medicine, as some studies have found an association between administration of \"older\" RBCs (generally defined as >14 days of storage) and increased mortality, multiple organ dysfunction, and/or sepsis.

Duration of PRBC storage does not appear to be a major contributing factor to mortality in the general canine population receiving PRBC transfusions, although it may be associated with progression of multiple organ dysfunction and coagulopathies. Also, duration of PRBC storage may be an important consideration for mortality in patients with hemolysis, particularly IMHA. Prospective studies are warranted to further investigate the clinical impact of duration of PRBC storage on morbidity and mortality post-transfusion in dogs. Transfusion medicine is a component of high quality veterinary care.

Cats under sedation had statistically significant lower reticulocytes count than non sedated ones, no significant changes were observed on any other RBC parameter.

A previous study in dogs attested the use of medetomidine leads to an increase in splenic volume, but no correlation between PCV and splenic size was found, supposedly due to sequestration of RBC in nonsplenic sites. Also, there may be a shifting of fluid from extra to intravascular compartment in order to maintain normal cardiac output during sedation. RBC sequestration and fluid shifting may contribute to the reticulocyte count decrease observed in sedated cats. Previous studies have shown that canine patients with congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS) have changes in serum concentrations of both pro and anti-coagulant proteins.

Twentyone client owned dogs with CPSS confirmed by ultrasound or nuclear scintigraphy were enrolled prospectively. Complete blood count, biochemical panel, conventional hemostatic tests (platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), quantitative fibrinogen, antithrombin activity (AT), protein C (PC), d-dimers, and factor VIII) as well as kaolin activated TEG were measured. Dogs with CPSS had significantly shorter k values and increased angle, maximum amplitude (MA) and G values compared to normal dogs.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most common inherited disease in cats, is also a common inherited disorder in humans. Initially described in cats of Persian ancestry, it also occurs in cats of other lineages. A causal point mutation in Polycystin 1 (PKD1) is diagnostic. Feline ADPKD varies in phenotypic expression but usually is evident using ultrasonographic renal imaging (cystic lesions). While renal ADPKD manifestations are well documented, a subset of cats from the initial ADPKD colony concurrently demonstrated biliary fibrosis and hyperplasia consistent with a fibrocystic biliary malformation. Rare single biliary cysts were also described (lined by flattened or dysplastic biliary epithelium). To our knowledge, fibrocystic biliary disease consistent with a ductal plate malformation in the absence of polycystic renal lesions has been defined in humans, but has not been definitively associated with the feline PKD1 mutation.

Age-related immunosenescence (ARI) occurs in many species, including cats. This study explored differentially expressed genes (DEG) within feline leukocytes that might be related to ARI. Following an overnight fast, blood samples were collected from 36 healthy, adult, neutered cats equally divided by age as young (<7 yrs), middle-age (7-11 yrs) and old (>11 yrs). Leukocyte differentials were determined on fresh blood, and leukocyte RNA was purified and stored (-80C) until analysis via microarray. Gene ID, signal median, background median and quality control flag information were extracted from the raw data, with gene expression determined as the difference between signal and background noise. Age effects were determined via ANOVA, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Neutrophil percentages increased (46.6 a AE 4.1, 54.6 a AE 3.4, and 69.3 b AE 2.8, respectively for young, middle-age and old; p < 0.01), and lymphocytes decreased (43.9 a AE 5.2, 37.4 a AE 4.0, and 23.3 b AE 2.8, respectively for young, middle-age and old; p < 0.05), with age.

Non-erosive immune-mediated polyarthopathy (IMPA) in dogs is diagnosed with arthrocentesis and synovial fluid analyses, and serial joint arthrocentesis is recommended to monitor response to therapy. However, repeated arthrocentesis is invasive and requires sedation, so treatment adjustments are often made without any objective measures of disease remission.

IL-17-producing helper T cells (Th17) were recently recognized in humans and in mice as a fourth component that regulates adaptive immune responses. Th17 cells function by promoting inflammation that counterbalances the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs). The relationships of Th17 cells to health and disease remain poorly understood, but data from laboratory animals suggest that Th17 cells could contribute to a variety of immune-mediated diseases. The existence of Th17 cells in the dog has not been conclusively established. Although expression of mRNA encoding orthologs of IL-17 and the IL-17 receptor was documented in tissues from dogs with arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and lymphoma, there was no association between IL-17 gene expression and disease phenotype. However, robust assessment of the role of Th17 cells will require methods that can measure the frequency of these cells in health and disease in balance with other lymphocyte subsets. For this reason, we validated three antibodies against human and murine IL-17 to recognize IL-17 producing canine T cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with the mitogen Concanavalin-A (ConA) for 4-6 hr, secretion was inhibited by disrupting Golgi function, and production of IL-17 was examined in T-cell subsets using intracellular stain-ing. Accumulation of intracellular IL-17 was observed in stimulated CD4 and CD8 T cells using each of the three antibodies tested. The effect of inflammatory and regulatory cytokines on this Th17 response, as well as the relationships between Th17 and Tregs in canine peripheral T cells will be discussed. Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system reacts against red blood cells just as it would against a foreign bacteria or virus. Although the causes of IMHA are still not well understood, IMHA can result from a primary immune system problem or result secondary to some other condition. Naturally occurring CD4 + , CD25 + regulatory T cell (Treg) that is produced by the normal thymus as a functionally mature T-cell subpopulation has a function that maintain immunologic self-tolerance and inhibit immune response.

Sample size precludes statistical analysis at this time, but it appears that identification of organisms in urine sediment is more likely in intact dogs. Vector-borne pathogens, which infect dogs throughout North America, cause a spectrum of clinical and hematological disease manifestations. As tick distributions expand through changes in ecosystem management, wildlife migration and increased travel by humans and their companion animals, regional shifts in tick-borne pathogen exposure are likely. In an effort to better delineate regional exposure to various tickborne pathogens, an expanded set of species-specific peptides were used to develop an experimental rapid, in-house diagnostic SNAP \u00e2 Multi-Analyte Assay (SNAP \u00e2 M-A). The assay detects specific antibodies to Ehrlichia canis (Ec), E.chaffeensis (Ech), E.ewingii (Eew), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Aph), A.platys (Apl) and Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) in canine serum samples. Archived serum from a population of dogs being screened for tick-borne diseases by the Vector-Borne Disease Diagnostic Laboratory from 2008 to 2012, were rescreened with SNAP \u00e2 M-A to determine the species-specific seroprevalence for six tick-borne pathogens.

Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) is an acute-phase serum protein that is produced by the liver in response to inflammation, infection and neoplastic conditions. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is one of the most important viral diseases of cats. The diagnosis of FIP is often challenging. The clinical suspicion of FIP must be supported by the analysis of effusions when present, but usually histopathological analysis is the definitive test. Nowadays, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used to detect FCoV and is fast and sensitive, but results must be interpreted in the context of clinical-pathological findings. The aim of this study was to determine AGP concentration in cats with clinical and laboratorial signs of FIPeffusive and non-effusive forms. Total RNA from blood and effusion samples was tested with a RT-PCR for detection of FCoV mRNA of the highly conserved M gene. Healthy cats were used as control group. AGP was measured by the use of a commercial species-specific immunoassay test (PHASE Feline alpha-1 acid glycoprotein SRID Assay Kit, Tridelta Development Ltd, Ireland) in two groups of cats: 20 healthy cats and 8 cats with FIP diagnosed by RT-PCR. For both groups, serum samples were collected, harvested and frozen at -80\u00b0C until assayed. Unpaired T test was used to compare the groups. Mean of AGP concentration was significantly higher (3579.5 AE 690.27 lg/mL) in cats with FIP at diagnosis than in healthy cats (235.22 AE 154.19 lg/mL), p < 0.0001. The results agree with other author, who studied this same protein in cats with FIP and other diseases and found that, when the pretest probability of FIP is high, based on history and clinical signs, moderate serum AGP levels (1500 to 2000ug/mL) can discriminate cats with FIP from others, while only high AGP levels (>3000ug/mL) can support a diagnosis of FIP in cats with low pretest probability of disease. In conclusion, AGP concentration was significantly higher in cats with FIP and, based on history, clinical signs and laboratorial alterations can help with FIP diagnosis.

Dogs with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may progress with proteinuria according to the renal disease or in consequence of progressive loss of nephrons as glomerular hyperfiltration may develop in the remaining nephrons causing proteinuria. Glomerular proteinuria is characterized by urinary proteins loss of high molecular weight (HMW > 60 kDa~albumin), and tubular proteinuria of low molecular weight (LMW < 60 kDa).

Thus in Group I, normal values of UAC predominated and no macroalbuminuria (UAC > 0.3) was detected, and SDS-PAGE revealed that those CKD dogs with UPC > 2.0 showed higher percentage of LMW proteinstubular pattern (84 to 100% of total proteins and 4 to 6 bands), as well as CKD dogs with UPC < 2.0 (40 to 100% of total proteins and 4 to 6 bands) when compared to control group (LMW proteins= 55.4 AE 12.5%; meanAESEM, and scarce or 3 to 4 bands of proteins) (unpaired t test; p < 0.05).

Dogs underwent twice weekly HD and were fed a constant protein and calorie intake. Urea kinetics were assessed by measurement of preHD serum urea nitrogen (pre HD SUN), weekly time-average urea concentration (TACurea), dialysis dose (eKt/V), and urea nitrogen appearance rate (G).

To circumvent this limitation, we devised an external closed bypass loop adapted to the Gambro Phoenix that delivers product dialysate (Qd, 350-800 ml/min) at reduced flow (Qd, 1-15 ml/min) to and from the dialyzer. Dialysis intensity thus is controlled by the dialysate flow while maintaining all machine functionality at fast blood flow (Qb) to prevent clotting.

Variant alleles in NPSH1 and KIRREL2, the genes which encode the slit diaphragm proteins nephrin and filtrin/Neph3, respectively, were previously found associated with protein-losing nephropathy (PLN) in Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers (SCWT) by a genome-wide association study and subsequent gene sequencing of candidate genes in a statistically significant interval that differed among dogs with PLN compared with geriatric (14-18 year old) SCWT. Genotyping assays were developed for both of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes that are in linkage disequilibrium in the breed. Homozygous positive dogs were shown to be at highest risk for the development of PLN, heterozygous dogs were at intermediate risk, and homozygous negative dogs were at low risk for the development of PLN. A prevalence study was performed to ascertain if breeders could safely remove carrier dogs in one generation. Cheek swab, blood, or semen samples were tested from 1208 SCWT dogs of all ages (median 4 yrs). Haplotypes are described as 1-1 (homozygous negative), 1-2 (heterozygous), and 2-2 (homozygous positive) for the PLN-associated variant alleles. The following table shows the frequencies found in various countries. Without genetic counseling with the knowledge of these haplotypes and assuming random breeding, the variant allele frequency would remain 43% in the USA. This high frequency indicates that it would be unwise to cull all carriers (1-2 or 2-2 dogs) of the variant alleles in one generation, thereby risking loss of genetic diversity, increased inbreeding, and the potential of increasing the incidence of other deleterious genetic traits.

Urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence (USMI) is reportedly the most common cause of acquired urinary incontinence in dogs. Estrogen replacement therapy is one of the medical treatment options however estradiol (E2) esters and synthetic estrogens, which have a long nuclear receptor occupancy time, have been associated with estrogenic effects, such as mammary gland neoplasia, reproductive organ neoplasia and bone marrow suppression, in dogs. Estriol (E3), a naturally-occurring metabolite of E2, has short nuclear estrogen receptor occupancy. E3 has been shown to improve continence, through increasing urethral resistance and closure pressure, in incontinent female dogs and has a favorable safety profile at therapeutic doses in dogs (0.5 to 2 mg/day) for years and at high doses (10 mg/day) for prolonged periods (90 days).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "NU"}, {"text": "To demonstrate the safety of E3 in ovariohysterectomized female dogs a study was conducted in accordance with requirements set forth by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Veterinary Medicine.

Serum biochemistry values remained in the normal range during both weight loss and maintenance. Based on this data, the test food provided safe and effective weight loss and maintenance. Lean body mass increased during the weight maintenance phase in the face of continued loss of body fat. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that dog plasma concentrations of selected nutrients decrease after undergoing caloric restriction for weight loss. Thirty-one overweight dogs that had successfully lost at least 15% of initial body weight between 2005 and 2011 were included in the study. Dogs remained healthy throughout the study, and no signs attributable to nutrient deficiency were noted. Percentage weight loss was 28.3% (16.0-40.1%) starting body weight, over a period of 250 days (91-674 days). Median energy intake during the weight loss period was 62 (44 to 74) Kcal/kg 0.75 target weight per day. Nutrients that had been previously identified to be at potential risk of deficiency during caloric restriction were measured in plasma (choline, amino acids) and urine (selenium) at the initiation and completion of a standardized weight loss regimen in dogs. Choline (P = 0.046) and threonine (P = 0.02) decreased after weight loss. Glycine (P = 0.041), and urinary selenium:creatinine ratio (P = 0.006) both increased after weight loss.

Body composition, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and circulating metabolites were measured in 70 dogs from 5 to 15 years of age fed one of five protein concentrations (15, 16, 22, 25, and 30% ) in a one year study. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc., Topeka, KS, USA.

Dogs experienced behavioral enrichment through daily interaction and play time with caretakers, and by daily opportunities to run and exercise with access to toys. Dietary protein was sufficient in all foods as shown by no response to treatment, and maintenance of albumin, hemoglobin, hematocrit and lean body mass over the one year study. Increasing dietary protein was associated with increasing GFR (P < 0.01) and circulating urea (P < 0.01) as well as decreasing creatinine and symmetrical di-methyl arginine (SDMA) concentration (P < 0.01). Total lean body mass was positively associated with circulating creatinine concentration (P < 0.01). GFR was influenced by circulating concentrations of creatinine, SDMA, the creatinine and SDMA interaction, lean body mass, and fat mass. These data show that GFR in the dog responds to protein load as influenced by dietary protein intake, is influenced by body composition, and that creatinine, SDMA, body lean, and body fat all have a predictive benefit in estimating GFR.

This study aimed to measure the serum CRP concentrations in patients with idiopathic epilepsy (IE), without structural or infectious alterations, presenting generalized seizures episodes in order to verify if the seizures interfere in CRP concentrations. Therefore, 56 dogs were evaluated in three study groups. Control group, composed by 23 healthy dogs, group B with 17 dogs presenting IE which had seizures within 24 hours, and group C with 16 dogs presenting IE, which had seizures in a period of time between 24 hs and 5 days. The mean of CRP concentration was 0.98 (range: indetectable -6,36 lg/mL) for the control group, 2.14 lg/mL for group B (range: indetectable -5,03) and 0.68 lg/mL (range: indetectable -1,98 lg/mL) for group C. Statistical analysis was performed by Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn's test and no significant difference on CRP concentration was observed between the control group and those animals that had seizure episodes for more than 24 hours. A significant difference was observed when compared groups control and C with those that had seizures within 24 hours (p = 0.0002). Although the values of CRP concentration were within the accepted range for many authors, it was concluded that seizures generate in dogs with IE an acute phase response characterized by mild increase of serum CRP, probably caused by muscle contraction. Maximum CRP concentration occurs at approximately 24 hours after seizures, and was not observed detectable increase after this time, Inappropriate urination is a problem with serious implications for both cats and their human families. As part of a larger research project aimed at investigating behavioral and physical differences among cats presented with inappropriate urination, owners of 18 spraying and 23 toileting cats with normal control subjects from the same multi-cat households (n = 39) were recruited. Whilst large amounts of urine deposited on horizontal surfaces are typically found in cases of \"toileting\", \"spraying\" cats tend to deposit urine on vertical areas for chemical communication purposes. The case-control dyads were brought together by the owners to the veterinary hospital of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, for a medical work-up (i.e. physical examination, complete blood count, biochemical profile, urinalysis and urine culture, abdominal ultrasound of the urinary system and cystoscopy where possible in female participant cats only). Medical concerns were identified with similar frequency in both the otherwise healthy recruited \"sprayers\" (i.e. 38.9% -cases versus 5.6%controls) and \"toileters\" (32.1% -cases versus 21.4%-controls) (Pearson Chi 2 test, p = 0.639). Medical alterations such as renal calculi, higher creatinine levels, although within normal reference range and \"glomerulations\" (detected during cystoscopy) in both \"sprayers\" and \"toileters\" were common. The link between early renal disease and different types of urinary act, particularly when urinary function does not seem to be diminished remains unknown. Likewise, the potential for renal formations (e.g. calculi within the kidney) to cause pain and as a consequence bring about a change in urination behaviour has been completely overlooked. If such conditions act either as causes or contributors to inappropriate urination and have not been detected due to medical exams being focused on the lower urinary tract or urinalysis this might explain, at least in part, the refractoriness of some cases. Since the veterinary health goal should be to provide complete care for the feline patient with a urinary behaviour problem a detailed medical examination including imaging evaluation of the upper urinary tract should be encouraged in refractory cases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "OT-4 MONITORING CLOUDY EYE PROGRESSION BY"}, {"text": "OT-7 EVALUATION OF THREE DIFFERENT POINT-OF-CARE TESTS FOR QUANTITATIVE DETECTION OF CANINE C-REACTIVE PROTEIN.

However, little is understood about the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Most cost of reproduction studies simply ask how reproductive capacity influences age at death, but are blind to the subjects' actual causes of death.

The domestic cat research community has developed an illumina Infinium iSelect Feline 63K DNA array that was financially supported by Hill's Pet Food, Inc and distributed by competitive awards from the Cat Health Network. These DNA arrays are useful for case-control studies of cat diseases and traits, limiting the need for extended pedigrees for causative gene mapping to chromosomal regions. However, the successful use of DNA arrays is dependent on the density of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the array, genetic make-up of the case-control samples, and the dynamics of the cat population under examination. Our research efforts have focused on the genetic structuring of cat populations, indicating that different genetic markers can define eight worldwide \"races\" of cats and that the most common 29 breeds form only~21 cat breed populations. In additional, our examination of genetic linkage disequilibrium demonstrates that certain breeds, such as Burmese and Birman, have high linkage disequilibrium and inbreeding, requiring less cats for powerful case-control analyses. However, breeds that have low inbreeding, low linkage disequilibrium and therefore are very similar to random bred cats, require higher samples sizes for a sufficient analysis. These low power cat breeds, such as Siberians and random bred cats, will likely need a higher density DNA array for successful studies. Our research group has examined over 2,000 cats for various diseases and traits to identify locations for these conditions on cat chromosomes and the subsequent analysis of regional candidate genes for causative mutations. We have previously reported success with the identification of Burmese hypokalaemic polymyopathy to a mutation in the WNK4 gene on cat chromosome E1. The studies have also been successful with the localization of a progressive retinal atrophy in Persians, a major gene causing brachycephaly and a craniofacial dysmorphology in Burmese cats, and several dominant and recessive coat colors and fur types, such as the Selkirk Rex mutation. This report will present several cat case-control studies and the genetic analyses of cat populations, highlighting the potential reasons for the successes and failures of case-control studies. In addition, the genome sequence of the domestic cat has reached 14x coverage. Small groups of cats, such as a cat with a disease or abnormal condition and its parents and or normal sibs, can be genetically sequenced as a means to discover causative mutations. Direct sequencing of human patients with abnormalities is rapidly becoming a standard of care. The need and feasibility of direct sequencing and higher density DNA arrays for companion animal health care will be presented, highlighting genetics of the domestic cat.

The FDA-approved label for cefovecin (Convenia) warns that administration with another highly-protein bound drug, such as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) could produce a protein displacement drug interaction. Carprofen and cefovecin are two highly protein-bound (>99% and 98.5%, respectively) drugs frequently administered to dogs. A protein displacement interaction may produce higher unbound drug concentrations, changes in pharmacokinetics, and ultimately adverse effects or lack of efficacy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cefovecin alters the plasma pharmacokinetics of carprofen in dogs. Carprofen was administered intravenously (4 mg/kg) alone and in combination with subcutaneously administered cefovecin in a two-period crossover study utilizing six adult dogs. Plasma concentrations of carprofen enantiomers were analyzed by HPLC and pharmacokinetics were determined using compartmental methods. Cefovecin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of S(+) carprofen, but did affect the R(-) enantiomer. Area under the curve (AUC), clearance, and terminal half-life (T 1/2 ) were significantly (p < 0.05) less following concurrent carprofen and cefovecin administration when compared with carprofen alone. The R(-) enantiomer geometric means for AUC were 200.6 and 148.2 lg\u00c1h/mL, means for Cl were 10.0 and 13.5 mL/ min/kg and means for the terminal half-life (T\u00bd) were 8.5 and 5.5 h for carprofen alone and in combination with cefovecin, respectively. Volume of distribution at steady-state was unchanged and was 0.10 L/kg for both enantiomers. Although the PK profile of the R(-) enantiomer was significantly influenced by concurrent cefovecin administration, the pharmacologically active S(+) enantiomer was not. The results of this study indicate that a clinically significant drug interaction is unlikely from the concurrent administration of carprofen and cefovecin in dogs.

Alimentary lymphoma comprises one of the most common malignancy in cats and hematological and biochemical profile are important to detect alterations and to select the treatment protocol. The goal of this study was to retrospectively analyse the hematologic (CBC) and biochemical (total protein, albumin, urea, creatinine, alanine aminotrasnferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase) records of 27 cats with alimentary lymphoma. A clinical history was acquired and a complete physical examination was performed for each patient at the time of the first presentation. Presenting signs included weight loss, lethargy, anorexia and diarrhea. The diagnosis was determined by cytology or histopathology. Large cell or lymphoblastic lymphomas were the most common cell type comprising 63% of the cats (17/27) and 37% presented small cell or lymphocytic lymphomas (10/17). Cats had a median age of 11 years (range 3-16 years). Regarding retroviral status, 7,4% (2/ 27) were infected by FIV and 3,7% (1/27) by FeLV.

It affects more than 150 mammalian species including humans, dogs and cats, among others. Leptospires spp. belong to a group of motile, aerobic or microaerophilic gram-negative spirochetes, with a hook-shaped end. Pathogenic and non-pathogenic species co-exist in nature.Between 2009 and 2011, blood samples collected from 3907 dogs in Germany were sent to our laboratory and screened for Leptospiral antibodies by means of microscopic agglutination tests (MATs) that involved a total of 35 116 assays. The serovars included in the tests were L. Icterohaemorrhagiae, L. Canicola, L. Pomona, L. Bratislava, L. Grippotyphosa, L. Saxkoebing, L. Autumnalis, L. Australis and L. Serjoe. Results were considered positive if the antibody titre was ! 1:400.L. Grippotyphosa and L. Saxkoebing have been reported to be the most common serovars causing Leptospiral infections in dogs. In this study, the prevalence of positive antibody titres for the two particular serovars was found to be relatively low. Whereas the prevalence of L. Saxkoebing showed a transient increase in 2010, the overall pattern of positive antibody responses to L. Grippotyphosa showed a slight decrease during the course of the study.In 2009, 4% of all positive dogs were sero-positive against a single serovar. This proportion remained stable in the following years, albeit with a slightly decreasing tendency. The number of dogs developing dual seropositivity against two serovars increased steadily, as did the number of dogs seropositive against four different serovars simultaneously. None of the tested samples turned out to be seropositive against L. Serjoe.In this study, L. Bratislava, L. Icterohaemorrhagiae and L. Australis were found to be the most frequent serovars eliciting high-titre antibody responses. However, during the course of the study, some significant dynamic alterations in seropositivity frequency were observed with the aforementioned serovars. In 2009 and 2010, the highest antibody titres (1:3200) were most often found in the order of L. Bratislava > L. Autumnalis > L. Australis > L. Icterohaemorrhagiae. In 2011, the order changed to L. Bratislava > L. Australis > L. Icterohaemorrhagiae > L Autumnalis.Our data suggest that, considering the high magnitude of antibody responses, cross reactivities of the wild serovars (L. Bratislava, L. Australis and L. Autumnalis) with vaccination serovars (L. Canicola, L. Icterohaemorrhagiae/ Copenhageni) were rather unlikely. This study shows that the serovars hitherto considered \"rare\" played a greater role than previously thought in eliciting Leptospiral antibody responses in dogs. Identification of fungal organisms in urine sediment may allow rapid and cost-effective diagnosis of systemic infections. While, B. dermatitidis has been sporadically noted in urine sediment from infected dogs; however, the frequency at which organisms may be identified has not been systematically evaluated. Aims of this prospective study were to determine frequency of identifying B. dermatitidis organisms in urine sediment from dogs with confirmed systemic infections, and to determine whether presence of fungal organisms is more likely in intact males.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "Urine was prospectively collected from dogs with cytologically-confirmed blastomycosis prior to initiation of antifungal therapy.
