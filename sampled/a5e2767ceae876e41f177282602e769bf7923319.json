Procacci; Verona/IT Purpose: To evaluate the role of CEUS in the study of solid and cystic masses of the pancreas. Materials and Methods: 100 masses of the pancreas, found on conventional US, were studied with CEUS, by using Sonovue (Bracco) on a Sequoia 512 (Acuson). A dynamic observation from the early contrastographic phase (during arterial enhancement), to the late contrastographic phase (after venous enhancement) was possible. All the lesions were cytologically/histologically proved. The results were compared with those obtained at Spiral CT and/or MRI. Seven distinct enhancement patterns were observed: 1) Rapid intense enhancement in the early contrastographic phases with microbubble entrapment in the late phase [14 neuroendocrine tumors, 4 metastases from hypervascular tumors, 3 poorly differentiated carcinomas]; 2) moderate enhancement in the early contrastographic phase, resulting hypoechoic in the late phase [6 poorly differentiated carcinomas, 1 acinar cell carcinoma, 18 neuroendocrine tumors]; 3) capsular enhancement in the earliest phases [1 solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm; 2 neuroendocrine tumor]; 4) no enhancement [32 ductal adenocarcinomas and 2 neuroendocrine tumor]; 5) progressive enhancement [1 solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm]; 6) \"parenchymographic\" enhancement [12 inflammatory masses]; 7) parietal nodules and septas enhancement [4 cystic tumors] . Results: CEUS correctly characterized 74/84 (88%) solid pancreatic tumors. In particular all (32/32) the ductal adenocarcinomas were correctly diagnosed. Small nodules and septas of pancreatic cystic tumors, not visible at conventional US, were detected at CEUS. Conclusions: CEUS can demostrate macrocirculation and microcirculation of solid pancreatic masses and can improve the characterization of cystic pancreatic lesions.",

Lyra, N. Batakis; Athens/GR Purpose: To present the value of dual-phase spiral CT for the confirmation of resectability and pre-operative staging of pancreatic carcinoma. Materials and Methods: In a period of 4 years 184 patients with pancreatic carcinoma underwent dual-phase spiral CT for preoperative staging. CT scans after IV administration of contrast material with an electronic injector were obtained in the arterial (scan delay = 20 sec) and in the portal venous phase (scan delay = 50 sec) under a protocol with a total volume of 150 mL, flow rate 5 mL/sec. We have correlated the CT findings with surgical-pathologo-anatomic findings. Results: Dual-phase spiral CT was positive for pancreatic carcinoma in 178 patients (96.7%). In 6 patients it was false-positive (3.3%). In 44 (78.4%) out of 55 patients it showed hepatic metastases, in 33 (64.7%) out of 51 patients it showed lymph node enlargement, in 49 (88%) out of 60 patients vascular invasion, and in 8 (66.6%) out of 12 patients peritoneal metastases. The accuracy of the method was up to 90%. Conclusion: Dual-phase spiral CT is a safe, noninvasive, and accurate method to investigate pancreatic carcinoma and should be considered as the standard preoperative method for assessing lesion resectability.",

Kotchatkov; Moscow/RU Purpose: To investigate the value of preoperative CT in assessment of resectability of pancreatic head cancer. Methods and Materials: Eighty-nine patients (52 males and 37 females; mean age 60) with pancreatic head adenocarcinoma were investigated with spiral CT with bolus intravenous contrast enhancement. All of the patients were operated on. Whipple procedures were performed on 56 patients and palliative operations were performed on 33 patients. Results: Tumors of 24 patients were considered unresectable. 11 patients (Group 1) had tumors that were encircling superior mesenteric or portal veins (8 pts), superior mesenteric (2 pts) or hepatic arteries (1 pts) completely. No fat layer was identifiable between the tumors and the vessels. 13 patients (Group 2) had CT appearances of tumors that partially (less than 2/3 of the circumference and in less than 20 mm) circumscribed the vessels. Tumors of all group 1 patients were not resectable with a negative margin. Among group 2, four patients (30.8%) had unresectable tumors; six patients (46.1%) had tumors that were difficult to dissect from the vessels; 3 patients (23.1%) had no evidence of vascular involvement and in fact went through curative surgery. Conclusion: The CT findings predicted correctly surgical findings in 21 of 24 unresectable tumors (87.5%). When the tumor partially circumscribed the vessels CT was not to be relied upon in predicting whether or not the tumor was fixed against the vessels.",

Matarazzo 2 , A. Siani 2 ; 1 Naples/IT, 2 Pozzuoli/IT Learning Objective: To illustrate the appearance of several splenic lesions as shown during real-time, contrast-specific, harmonic imaging. Background: Contrast-enhanced, low-mechanical index US is a new technique allowing continuous, real-time assessment of splenic abnormalities. In our institution we use the technology named contrast tuned imaging (Esaote, Italy) and we employ a second-generation, sulfur-exafluoride based, microbubble contrast agent (SonoVue-Bracco, Italy). The contrast agent, at a volume of 2.4 or 4.8 mL, in injected through a peripheral vein and a 20 G needle, using a three-way stopcock and a 5-mL normal saline flushing. Imaging Findings: A wide spectrum of splenic disorders is depicted: injury, spontaneous hematoma, abscess, capillary and cavernous hemangioma, lymphomatous infiltration, metastasis, splenomegaly, and accessory spleen. Several potential pitfalls are also shown. Conclusion: Contrast-specific US is being used with increasing frequency in the evaluation of the spleen. This is a superficial organ, with an almost homogeneous echotexture and with a dense and persistent contrast-enhancement; these characteristics make the spleen an optimal organ to be studied with contrast-specific US. Radiologists should be aware of the typical and atypical appearance of splenic disorders as shown at contrast-specific US imaging.",

Ramachandra; Birmingham/UK Learning Objectives: To familiarise with the normal anatomy of the spleen. To further demonstrate common variations and splenic pathologies encountered in clinical practice. Background: The spleen is the largest single mass of lymphoid tissue seen in the body. We familiarise with its normal image appearance using CT, USS and MRI. The pattern of contrast enhancement of the spleen during the arterial and venous phases in CT can mimic disease by forming pseudomasses. Normal variants such as splenunculus, splenic clefts/lobulations, liver wrap-around, wandering spleen as well as congenital heterotaxic syndromes will be discussed. A spectrum of splenic pathologies are demonstrated and the list of differential diagnoses that should be considered when seeing splenomegaly, cystic lesions, solid lesions and splenic calcification. Examples of splenic trauma -laceration, subcapsular and intraparencymal haematoma will be discussed and complications such as splenosis demonstrated. Image Findings: Images of the spleen on plain radiography, CT, MRI, USS and radionuclide imaging from our institution are demonstrated along with imaging protocols. Conclusion: There are several normal variants of the spleen which should be readily recognised. Congenital abnormalities of the spleen such as polysplenia are rare, this should not be misdiagnosed as splenosis. It is useful to assess the presence and extent of splenomegaly. Further classification of parenchymal lesions into cystic or solid can be made. Solid lesions can be further subclassified into those with calcification. This poster demonstrates some splenic pathologies, a clear list of differential diagnosis is essential in interpreting any splenic lesion.",

Junghanss; Heidelberg/DE Learning Objects: The new WHO-classification provides, for the first time, a standardized sonomorphological staging of echinococcal cysts. We demonstrate the clinical value of this classification with examples from our cohort of patients. Specific signs supporting the diagnosis of CE, and criteria for assessing cyst viability are presented. This allows staging of cysts relevant for treatment decisions (surgery, percutaneous drainage (PAIR), albendazole or \"watch&wait\") and treatment monitoring. Background: Ultrasonography plays a central role for diagnosis and follow-up of abdominal CE due to problems regarding sensitivity and specificity of clinical symptoms and serological tests. This technique allows the staging of cysts with respect to the involution process (spontaneous and treatment induced). The treatment options of CE have broadened in recent years with percutaneous drainage (PAIR), medical treatment and \"watch&wait\" as preferable strategies over surgery for specific cyst stages. In 2001 a standardized classification has been published by WHO allowing inter-observer comparison of treatment decisions and follow-up. Procedure Details: 55 patients with a follow-up of up to 4 years have been seen in our referral centre for CE since 1999. Apart from 3 patients with pulmonary lesions and 1 patient with a spinal manifestation, all other patients had abdominal cysts (63 hepatic, 1 spleen, 1 kidney, 1 peritoneal). We evaluated the value of the WHO-classification for diagnosis, therapeutic decision making and follow-up. Conclusion: On the basis of the WHO-classification ultrasonography is not only an excellent tool for the primary diagnosis of CE but also very valuable for clinical decision making and monitoring treatment response.",

To gain an appreciation of, and be alert in clinical practice to, the wide range of sites, both common and uncommon, of metastases from malignant melanoma, including the lymphatic, central nervous, and musculoskeletal systems, thorax, abdomen and pelvis. 2. To become familiar with the radiologic appearances of metastatic melanoma on CT, MR, and ultrasound. Background: Malignant melanoma is a tumor that is increasing in incidence throughout the world, with a widely varying prognosis and distinctly capricious behavior. If, and when, the tumor metastasizes it can spread in an expected manner; however, frequently both the timing and sites of dissemination can be entirely unpredictable. Imaging Findings: This exhibit will present the wide range of manifestations of metastatic melanoma throughout the body, including the lymphatic, central nervous, and musculoskeletal systems, chest, abdomen and pelvis, and soft tissues, as identified by the major cross-sectional modalities of CT, MR, and ultrasound. The hypervascular and hemorrhagic tendency of the tumor, and its typical MR signal characteristics, will be illustrated. The exhibit will demonstrate the typical sites of metastases, namely lymphatics, brain, lungs, and liver; but will also illustrate the wide spectrum of more unusual sites of dissemination, including meninges, pleura, pancreas, gallbladder, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, peritoneal cavity, skeletal muscle and bone.",

We reviewed the imaging of patients with a histologically proven diagnosis of PTLD treated at our sub-regional oncology unit over the past 5 years. Conclusion: PTLD is estimated to occur in between 2-5% of patients. Clinical manifestations are variable ranging from focal disease with graft dysfunction to systemic illness. PTLD may be unsuspected or more extensive than expected and imaging plays an important role in diagnosis, staging and follow-up. CT (and to a lesser extent US) is the imaging modality of choice.",

Buzzi; Buenos Aires/AR Learning Objectives: To exhibit for the first time a medical document of Eva Per\u00f3n's embalmed cadaver. Background: Eva Per\u00f3n was Juan Domingo Peron's wife (he was President in Argentina between 1946 Argentina between and 1955 Argentina between , and between 1973 Argentina between and 1974 . For her political and social action she is known worldwide. She died of a cervix cancer in 1952. When she died, she weighed less than 30 kg, so many people doubt that her embalmed cadaver (small and consumed) belonged to her. The cadaver was embalmed by Dr Pedro Ara, Professor of Anatomy at the School of Medicine of the University of Cordoba. He was born in Zaragoza, Spain, and he was established in Argentina in the decade of 1930. Professor Ara carried out excellent work with Eva Peron's cadaver. Contrary to the classical technique, Eva Peron's embalmed body conserves its viscera. Imaging Findings: When the r\u00e9gime was overthrown in 1955 Eva Peron's cadaver was deposited in the General Confederation of Work (\"Confederacion General del Trabajo\", CGT). The new authorities doubted of the authenticity of the cadaver. Radiological exams were made by Dr Guido Gotta (father of one of the authors), who confirmed that the body corresponded to a human being, and that there was evidence of neoplasia (abdominal nodules, bone metastasis). Conclusions: Besides its medical use, thanks to its capacity to examine the interior of bodies, since their discovery X-rays were used for other purposes. In this case, they were used to determine the authenticity of Eva Peron's embalmed cadaver.",

The age of the patients in our series ranged between 17and 30-years-old. Imaging Findings: Complications of drug abuse in the drug addict will be classified according to their pathogenic mechanism or by their way of administration. Pathologically, complications are usually due to their vasoconstrictive and thrombogenic effect on different organs, including the brain (stroke), heart (myocardial ischemia), the gastro-intestinal system (ischemic colitis), the nose (nasal septum perforation due to cocaine snorting). A direct toxic effect of drug metabolites is another pathogenic mechanism resulting in tissue necrosis, as typically seen in liver cell necrosis due to ecstacy. The route of administration (intravenously, orally, inhalation or smoking) may also reflect the radiological presentation. Local abscess formation, septic thrombophlebitis, septic pulmonary emboli or bloodborn infections result from intravenous access, whereas inhalation and smoking may result in pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and epidural pneumatosis. Indirect complications, such as an increased risk for traffic accidents can be attributed to the additive effect of a cocktail of drugs and/or alcohol. Complications related to smuggling are due to accidental rupture of packed drugs in the gastrointestinal lumen.",

Two radiologists reviewed radiologic findings retrospectively and correlated with pathologic results. Imaging Findings: We categorized them into 3 groups by cell of origin; nerve sheath origin (schwannoma in 7, neurofibroma in 4, plexiform neurofibromatosis in 1, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in 3), paraganglionic cell origin (paraganglioma in 7, pheochromocytoma in 8), and ganglion cell origin (ganglioneuroma in 5, ganglioneurofibroma in 2, ganglioneuroblastoma in 1, neuroblastoma in 8). Conclusion: Although abdominal neurogenic tumors show a broad spectrum, some neurogenic tumors revealed characteristic radiologic findings and correlated well with pathologic findings. Familiarity with various neurogenic tumors in the abdomen is helpful in the approach of the diagnosis.",

Results: Most patients had been at increased risk because of drug abuse, alcoholism, AIDS and steroid therapy. Radiological findings included low density lymph nodes, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, intrasplenic and intrahepatic masses, ascities, diffusely thickened and enhanced peritoneum, mottled low density masses in the omentum, pleural effusion, thickening of the bowel, adrenal enlargement, atrophy and calcification, fallopian tube fibrosis, uterine atrophy and adhesions, ureteral and bladder fibrosis, and different patterns of renal hydronephrosis and calcification. Conclusion: Patients with AIDS had more severe form of involvement than those who did not have AIDS. Sonography was the only imaging modality to demostrate septations within the tuberculous ascites, but showed the fewest morphologic details in renal tuberculosis. CT is the imaging modality that best determined the extent of intrabdominal tuberculosis.

The U statistic of Mann-Whitney was performed for the quantitative variables, whereas the Chi-square or the Fisher's exact tests were used for the qualitative ones. Variables were also included in a multivariate stepwise logistic regression model. A ROC-analysis was performed. Results: In the stepwise logistic regression, presence of medium or large EV was independently predicted by splenomegaly, decreased platelet count, HCV infection and a decrease of the maximum portal flow velocity (MPV).

The aim of the study was to analyse head-to-head the diagnostic value of pancreatic DSA, computed tomography and magnetic resonance in 29 patients (25 female, 4 male; 37 \u00b1 6 years) with insulinoma. The diagnosis was established by pathohistology after the surgical treatment in all patients. The tumours were localised in the pancreatic body in 20/29 patients (69%), in the pancreatic tail in 8/29 patients (27%) and in 1/29 patients (4%) Purpose: To estimate variants in the anatomic structure of the gallbladder, the biliary and pancreatic ducts and to develop a technique of research. Material and Methods: 780 patients underwent complex MRI using a 1.5 T unit. T2W HASTE, T1W TurboFLASH, including FS, and MRCP (single-slice TurboSE and multi-slice HASTE in different orientations) were acquired. 65 patients also examined with ERCP. Results: In 18% of patients the merger of the hepatic lobar bile ducts was extrahepatic. 21% revealed an additional right hepatic duct, more than half running into the common bile duct (CBD) low. The low fusion of the cystic duct and CBD was revealed in 19% of the patients, and its left arrangement in 23%. Anomalies in the form of the gallbladder are revealed in 35% and additional pancreatic duct in 10% of patients. In 13% patients the main pancreatic duct and CBD had a common ampoule, in more than 64% of cases they enter the duodenum parallel, in 13% cases separately. It is expedient to study the mutual relationships of ducts, parenchyma and vessels with application of T2-w HASTE. General submission about bile and pancreatic ducts and gallbladder allows receiving single-slice Tur-boSE. For better analysis of details of anatomic structure it is necessary to study of source images multi-slice HASTE in different orientations. The results of research especially are useful for planning of operative treatment. Conclusions: Complex MRI, especially reception of T2-w images and realisation of MRCP, is an excellent tool for revealing variants in anatomic structure of the gallbladder and ductal system.",

The diagnosis is based on physical examination and/or standardized questionaires so there is a need for quantitative diagnostic tools. The aim of this study is to evaluate computed tomography (CT) to measure fat distribution in HIV patients. Methods and Materials: 61 HIV-patients (44 men) were included. Lipodystrophy was diagnosed clinically on 31. Subcutaneous limb adipose tissue area and their percentage were measured by a single slice at mid thigh and mid arm by CT. The subcutaneous (SAT), visceral (VAT), and total (TAT) abdominal adipose tissue as 362 B D E F A G well as the VAT/TAT, SAT/TAT and VAT/SAT ratios were calculated by a single slice at umbilical level. Results: VAT/TAT and VAT/SAT ratios were significantly greater in lipodystrophic than in non-lipodystrophic patients: 0.62 vs 0.41, p < 0.01 and 2.48 vs 0.38, p < 0.01 respectively in men. 0.38 vs 0.25 p < 0.05 and 1.14 vs 0.32 p < 0.05 in female patients.

Lukac; Belgrade/YU Purpose: Therapeutic approach to HD requires determination of the disease extent to supra/infradiaphragmatic lymph nodes (LN) . A problem appears when LN are of borderline size or only slightly enlarged. Should such a finding on CT be considered as reactive hyperplasia or a pathological finding? The purpose of this report is to solve this dilemma. Methods and Materials: Infradiaphragmatic spiral CT scan was performed in 250 patients with histologically confirmed supradiaphragmatic HD. Bipedal lymphography represented the gold standard for final staging. Taking reactive hyperplasia into consideration, we estimated and statistically analysed CT's ability to differentiate benign and malignant conditions, and its value for staging. Results: Lymphography showed infradiaphragmatic disease in 48% of patients, 21% of whom had enlarged LN, while in 79% LN were of normal size or smaller. Of the total number of patients, reactive hyperplasia and lymphographically normal findings were found in 21% and 31% of patients, respectively. CT detected enlargement in 41% of patients, and in 20% of these this finding concurred with the lymphographic one. CT could neither detect affected normal/reduced LN, nor differentiate reactive from malignant hyperplasia. Postlymphographic restaging of the disease showed that 37% of patients would be understaged and 21% overstaged on the basis of CT finding only. Conclusion: Reactive hyperplasia represents a risk of up/downstaging if staging relies on CT only. Errors can be partially assigned to the inadequate interpretation of the CT findings, which cannot be taken for granted when LN are of borderline sizes. In such cases additional diagnostic procedures are necessary.",

Materials and Methods: MR and MSCT were performed in 25 cases of cardiac cancer diagnosed by biopsy prior to operation. MR and MSCT scans were performed on two different days. MR sequences included FSET1W, FSET2W, FSE T1W with fat suppression and dynamic enhanced FSPGR with fat suppression; MSCT was applied with dynamic triphasic contrast enhancement. All these findings were prospectively analyzed by two doctors separately and correlated with the surgery pathological findings. Statistic work was performed with SPSS. Results: According to histopathologic staging, the accuracy for T1-staging detected with MR and MSCT were 70% and 55% respectively, 75% and 62% for T2staging, 87% and 69% for T3-staging, 89% and 60% for T4-staging. Compared with MSCT, dynamic enhanced and delayed MR with fat suppression was superior for revealing the involvement of esophagus and aorta, early stage of invasiveness and providing more evidence in T2 from T3 or T3 from T4 staging (P < 0.05). Among these MR plain scan sequences, T1W with fat suppression was outstanding in depicting the gross features of the tumor, presence of ulceration, and adjacent lymph node swelling. Diagnostic accuracy determined by ROC analysis was marginally higher with MR scan than with MSCT scan in T-staging of cardiac cancer. Conclusion: MR is superior in T-staging of cardiac cancer and can be used to optimize the therapeutic strategy, thus avoiding unnecessary operation.",

Bartolozzi; Pisa/IT Purpose: To assess the diagnostic capabilities of multidetector CT in various esophageal pathological conditions. Methods and Materials: Thirty-three patients underwent a multidetector CT study after esophageal distension by means of effervescent powder administered after induction of hypotonia. All acquired images were post-processed with 2D and 3D software tools. The CT data was compared with the results of conventional radi-ology (33), endoscopy (28), or surgery (14) . Follow-up ranged between 4 and 15 months. Results: Esophageal distension in the upper and middle third was classified as \"good\" in 32/33 cases (97%); in the lower third, esophageal distension was \"good\" in 21/33 cases (64%). Final diagnoses were: leiomyoma (6), squamocellular carcinoma (6), adenocarcinoma (4), esophageal infiltration by thyroid cancer (2), benign polyposis (2), chronic esophagitis (5), post-sclerotherapy stenosis (1) , no abnormalities (7). When good distension was achieved, the thickness of unaffected esophageal wall was < 3 mm (range between 1.5 and 2.4 mm, mean 1.9 mm). Pathological wall thickening was observed in 25/33 cases (76%) with values ranging between 3.6 and 36 mm (mean 9.6 mm). Spiral CT demonstrated 21 true positive cases and 7 true negative cases. There were 4 false negative cases and 1 false positive case. Sensitivity was 84%, specificity 87%, diagnostic accuracy 85%, positive predictive value 95%, negative predictive value 64%.

(IBD) . To describe the technique of barium tagged dark-lumen MRC. To outline the advantages, disadvantages and limits of the method. Background: Conventional colonoscopy (CC) is the most widely used method for the assessment of the extension and the activity of IBD. However, CC is an invasive technique and requires long-lasting bowel preparation. Furthermore, not infrequently the examination of the entire colon and terminal ileum wouldn't be possible due to severe pain or fecal residue. These disadvantages are eliminated with barium tagged dark-lumen MRC which makes this examination more tolerable and acceptable by patients. Imaging Findings: Ten patients who present with symptoms of IBD underwent CC first and subsequently MRC. For fecal tagging, barium sulphate-containing contrast agent is given with meals, beginning 48 hours before the examination. For MRC the colon was filled with 2000 mL of diluted barium. After intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA, coronal T1-weighted three-dimensional gradient-echo sequence is performed. Additional fat-saturated axial two dimensional gradient-echo and coronal true-FISP sequences are obtained. Colon segments are interpreted seperately (rectum, descending, transverse, ascending colon, caecum) when assesing the extent of the disease. Bowel wall thickening and congestion of marginal vascularity are considered as signs of the disease. Out of sixty segments, 50 of them had colonoscopic correlation. Of these in 42 (84%) the extent of disease correlated with CC. Non-correlation of findings of MRC and CC was detected in 8 (16%) patients. Conclusion: Barium tagged dark lumen MRC can be used for the assesment of the extent of IBD.",

Seol; Seoul/KR Learning Objects: To provide an in-depth review of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST's) with their epidemiology, histopathology, clinical manifestations and the most up-to-date therapy. To describe radiologic features of GIST's. To discuss differential diagnosis of GIST's throughout the abdomen. Background: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST's) are unique neoplasms that occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract, mesentery, omentum, and retroperitoneum. They are the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastroin-testinal tract and are defined by their expression of KIT (CD117), a tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor. The expression of KIT is important to distinguish GIST's from other mesenchymal neoplasms such as leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas, schwannomas, and neurofibromas and to determine the appropriateness of KIT-inhibitor therapy. Imaging features of GIST's vary depending on tumor size and organ of origin. Since most GIST's arise within the muscle layer of the gastrointestinal tract, they most commonly have an exophytic growth pattern and manifest as dominant masses outside the organ of origin. Procedure Details: The purpose of this exhibit is to provide an in-depth review of GIST's with their epidemiology, histopathology, clinical menifestation and differential diagnosis. This exhibit will also reflect our experience in the radiologic evaluation of patients with GIST's, with emphasis on the typical findings present on small bowel series, ultrasonography and CT (including 3D images using multidetector CT). Examples of unusual GIST's and pathologic correlation as well as the most up-to-date therapy will be included. Conclusion: After interacting with this exhibit the radiologist will have an enhanced understanding of GIST's including histopathology and radiologic features.",

Alvarez; Madrid/ES Learning Objectives: To illustrate the spectrum of usual and unusual primary neoplasms involving the jejunum and ileum. To evaluate the efficacy of barium studies, US, CT and MR imaging in the management of these tumors. To understand the radiologic findings on the basis of pathologic correlation. Background: Preoperative diagnosis of jejunal and ileal neoplasms can be a challenge for both clinicians and radiologists. Symptoms are nonspecific and endoscopy is commonly unsatisfactory. Since early diagnosis is crucial for prompt therapy, imaging plays an essential role. Tumors develop in all histologic components of the small intestine including epithelial cells, lymphoid tissues, lymphatics, vessels, nerves, and muscle. Imaging Findings: We retrospectively reviewed the imaging findings of jejunal and ileal neoplasms from our digestive pathology database. Findings were correlated with pathology in all cases. Specific neoplasms addressed include benign (adenoma, leiomyoma, lipoma, familial polyposis, hemangioma, lymphangioma and fibroma); and malignant neoplasms (adenocarcinoma, carcinoid tumor, lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma, direct extension to the small bowel from extraintestinal tumors, and metastasic lesions). Enteroclysis is the primary and most effective radiologic modality in the evaluation of these neoplasms. CT should be the complementary radiologic modality and used for staging. MRI may help in specific cases. Pitfalls, diagnostic difficulties and differential diagnoses are emphasised. Conclusions: Evaluation of patients with small bowel neoplasms frequently requires multiple imaging modalities for diagnosis and treatment planning. Because of the characteristic imaging appearances of many of these tumors, this exhibit will help the radiologist in training to better understand and recognise jejunal and ileal neoplasms.",

Background: Abdominal CT scan has been shown to be the most valuable technique, in confirming the diagnosis of small bowel occlusion and to depict the site, level and cause of occlusion. Very few studies have focused on the contents of the bowel. Particulate faeces-like material mixed with gas bubbles within the lumen of a dilated small bowel loop is always a pathological condition. It is the result of a delayed intestinal transit. To access prevalence, characteristics of this CT sign, and differential diagnosis, we have reviewed 87 CT scans of small bowel occlusion over a period of two years. Imaging Findings: Our analysis suggests that the small bowel faeces sign is probably more frequent than the previous reported studies, in demonstrating 11 cases of small bowel faeces sign mainly observed in the ileal loops, and pointing to the site of occlusion. Faeces sign appeared as tubular gas bubbles mixed with particulate matter with no capsule in dilated segments of small bowel loop, due to adhesions, closed loop, and tumours (adenocarcinoma, carcinoid). Differential diagnosis of two phytobezoars is also illustrated and discussed. Conclusion: Small bowel faeces sign may not be confused with colonic segments leading to a failure to recognize the exact level of obstruction. Moreover, it represents a sentinel sign in determining the site of occlusion and consequently the cause of the obstruction.",

Taylor; Manchester/UK Learning Objectives: To evaluate changes in radiological appearances in patients with metastatic GIST treated with Imatinib. To highlight any specific imaging features that can be used to predict disease relapse. Background: Imatinib (Glivec, STI-571) is a KIT tyrosine-kinase inhibitor drug, recently developed and found to be effective in the treatment of metastatic GIST. We reviewed the pre-and post-treatment imaging findings on CT in ten patients. The duration of treatment varied from two to forty one months. The pre-treatment, eight and sixteen weeks scans were reviewed, along with the scans at the time of any relapse. The sites of metastases, size of lesions and cystic change were assessed. Imaging Findings: Metastases were present in the liver and peritoneum in seven patients each; mesentery and retroperitoneum in four and two patients respectively; splenic, renal and subcutaneous in one patient each. One patient had progressive disease at eight weeks. Nine patients responded to treatment. The maximum reduction in size of the metastasis was at eight weeks. Most metastases underwent cystic change with treatment, particularly in the liver and peritoneum. Two patients are known to have relapsed at fourteen and fifteen months. In both cases, cystic metastases developed more solid components prior to disease progression as indicated by an increase in the tumour volume. Conclusion: Ninety percent of the patients responded to treatment. Cystic change in the liver and peritoneal metastases correlates with disease response to Imatinib. An increase in solid components may be a useful predictor of disease relapse.",

The imaging features of those with a neoplastic aetiology were reviewed. Image Findings: The imaging reflects recent studies examining the incidence of primary small bowel tumours. Adenocarcinoma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, carcinoid and leiomyosarcoma comprise the majority. Secondary tumour deposits also lead to small bowel obstruction. We demonstrate those that metastasize intraperitoneally (such as ovarian carcinoma), haematogenously (such as melanoma), or by local tumour extension (such as liposarcoma and bladder carcinoma). Conclusion: It is well established that CT is a valuable diagnostic procedure in patients with acute small bowel obstruction. It is not only useful in distinguishing obstruction from ileus, but frequently establishes the cause of obstruction. Small bowel neoplasms are rare but have a high mortality since tumour-related symptoms occur late and are non-specific. Endoscopy is not feasible in most cases, as enteroscopy is limited to specialist centres. Small bowel contrast studies do not reach the high level of accuracy obtained in the evaluation of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. CT not only allows tumour detection, but demonstrates possible complications and offers the possibility of pre-operative staging in the acute or elective situation.",

Background: Multislice computed tomography (CT) gives us detailed information as thin-slice sagittal, coronal, and 3-dimensional images rapidly. A small volume of free air can be detected, and the perforation holes were predicted in some cases. During a 2-year period 21 patients with perforation of the stomach or duodenum underwent preoperative CT scans. There were 16 men and 5 women averaging 54.2 \u00b1 15.6 (29 to 84) years old. All patients underwent to surgical treatment, and all sites of perforation were confirmed. Imaging Findings: Levels of perforation were the antrum of stomach (n = 1), body of stomach (n = 5), duodenal bulb (n = 14), and descending limb of duodenum (n = 1). CT images showed local extraluminal gas near the perforation sites in 17 patients (81%), local ascites near the perforation sites in 15 patients (71%), edematous wall of perforation sites in 19 patient (90%), dirty increased density in the fat tissue in 19 patients (90%), and a perforation hole in 8 patients (38%).

Covello 3 ; 1 Naples/IT, 2 Frattamaggiore/IT, 3 Napoli/IT Learning Objective: Anorectal sphincter dysfunction can be responsible for evacuation difficulties and constipation; in addition, pelvic floor disorders can be associated. By using defecography associated with videoproctography, the evacuation time and the sphincters' opening time can be assessed, obtaining further information about the physiopathology of rectal empting and anal sphincter function. The aim of this study is to have functional radiological parameters of anal activity to detect anorectal sphincter dyssynergia syndrome. Background: On a consecutive series of 680 patients suffering from constipation we assessed by defecography combined with videoproctography 33 cases of sphincter dyssynergia syndrome (16 males and 17 females with mean age of 45 years, range of 17-34 years). All patients underwent clinical examination and endoscopy; 26 patients were investigated by anorectal manometry. Imaging Findings: In all patients defecography with videoproctography provided a sphinter opening delay > 40 s (normal values: 1-40 s) and increased evacuation time > 68 s (normal values: 3-68 s). Manometry revealed anal hypertonia in 13 cases. Conclusion: Defecography associated with videoproctography is an accurate, simple and non-invasive method to approach anosphincteral pathology, permtting study of this particular type of terminal constipation, which is difficult to demonstrate using other techniques. Background: GIST are rare mesenchymal tumors of the abdomen, for which an effective, molecular-targeted therapy with Imatinib Mesylate has been recently developed. Imaging Findings: 35 pts with advanced GIST (24/35 with liver lesions and 33/ 35 with peritoneal involvement) undergoing therapy with Imatinib Mesylate. All pts had a baseline MR, and then at 2, 4, 6, 12 months during treatment. Pts responsive to therapy (31/35) showed: A) tumor decrease in size (with an in-crease in tumor volume at 2 months from treatment start in some cases (17%) due to necrosis or bleeding): B) Hypointensity of the lesions on T1w images (lesion was hyperintense in rare case due to bleeding) and hyperintensity of the lesions on T2w images (correlating with the amount of degenerative tissue or necrosis): C) Hypovascularization of the lesions on contrast-enhanced T1w images in comparison to pre-treatment assessment, due to the presence of degenerative tissue or necrosis: E) Evidence of peritoneal fluid in all pts at the first months, reabsorbed in the following months. Conclusions: MRI is useful to identify tumor response to Imatinib Mesylate in advanced GIST as from the early months of therapy with the following indicators of treatment activity: A) Size of lesions; B) signal intensity; C) vascularization; D) amount of degenerative tissue or necrosis; E) presence of peritoneal fluid.",

Background: Bowel intussusception is more commonly associated with the paediatric population, but can occur in adults, affecting virtually any part of the gastrointestinal tract. In adults there is more often an underlying structural lesion, which acts as a lead point. Imaging Findings: Bowel intussusception has a classical appearance on barium studies and cross-sectional imaging and occasionally a lead point can be identified. Due to the underlying structural causes, surgery is more often required in adults than children, resulting in the availability of histopathologic specimens for correlation. However within the small bowel even in adults it has been shown that the majority of cases are self-limiting. In this exhibit, we review the imaging findings of intussusceptions affecting various sites in the gastrointestinal tract using different modalities.

Procedure Details: A total of 28 cases of tumoral terminal ileum pathology were found. All lesions were seen for the first time at the double contrast barium enema, and lately examined and characterized by the follow through or small bowel enema. In most of them abdominal computed tomography was performed. 20 cases had histological confirmation based on surgical specimens. Of the remaining 8 cases, 4 were lipomas with typical densitometric values diagnosed by computed tomography, thus these patients did not undergo surgery. The other 4 lesions described as polipoid did not have histological confirmation as the patients refused surgical resection. Conclusion: Double contrast barium enema can detect the presence of terminal ileum tumoral pathology even when not yet clinically suspected. There are a few radiological signs which allow the radiologist to recognize and diagnose it. Background: Magnetic resonance is a powerful diagnostic tool for abdominal imaging, particularly for extra-visceral tissue depiction. Newer pulse sequences, such as single shot fast spin echo (SSFSE) and steady state free precession (SSFP) with a water solution infusion via naso-jejunal tube can accurately depict the bowel lumen in a fashion similar to conventional double contrast enema. Furthermore 3D and 2D fast T1 weighted sequences with iv contrast administration allows the evaluation of wall involvement. Imaging Findings: Findings are summarized into lumen abnormalities, wall involvement and extra-luminal alterations. Corresponding DCSBE are shown and compared. Signs of disease activity at MRE plus conventional MRI are stressed. Contribution of different pulse sequences is evaluated. Conclusions: MRE plus conventional MRI is feasible in the diagnosis, staging and follow-up of Crohn's disease. Subtle mucosal lesions are still poorly depicted, compared to DCSBE. Extra-luminal involvement is superbly showed, particularly by new SSFP sequences. Disease activity signs seem to be the added value of magnetic resonance in Crohn's disease assessment.",

Background: 150 patients affected by colorectal carcinoma underwent colonoscopy and MSCTC on the same day. 100 patients free of colonic lesions were included as a control group. CT parameters were: collimation, 4 x 1 mm; effective mAs, 80-165; and kVp, 120. MSCT colonography was performed before (prone position) and after (supine position) intravenous administration of contrast material with a 60-sec delay-time. MSCTC images were interpreted by two radiologists on a workstation. The results of MSCT colonography were correlated with colonoscopy and with the results of the histopathologic examination performed on the resected surgical specimen. Intra-operative ultrasonography was used as the reference standard for the presence of liver metastases. Sensitivity and specificity for tumor detection and staging accuracy (according to the TNM classification) of MSCTC were calculated. Imaging Findings: Surgery revealed 164 carcinomas (150 primary and 14 synchronous lesions) in 150 patients. Colonoscopy failed to visualize the entire colon in 21 patients due to obstructive neoplasms and missed all 14 synchronous carcinomas. MSCTC provided a complete evaluation of the colon in all cases, correctly identified all primary and synchronous carcinomas (164/164; sensitivity, 100%), and yielded three false-positive diagnoses (specificity, 98.8%).

The clinical significance of each feature and differential points from benign GIST or other conditions will be discussed. Learning Objectives: To illustrate CT findings of common and uncommon duodenal diseases with pathologic correlation. To demonstrate a comprehensive CT anatomy of the duodenum and adjacent organs. To describe the pitfalls on CT interpretation of duodenal diseases. Background: The duodenum may be involved by secondary process as well as primary pathology because it is close to adjacent organs including the stomach, pancreas, liver, gallbladder, hepatic flexure of the colon, aorta, IVC, right kidney and adrenal. Duodenal pathology can be overlooked on CT interpretation but understanding of CT anatomy of the duodenum and adjacent organs may be helpful in the diagnosis of various duodenal pathology. Procedure Details: Helical CT during the portal phase with water as an oral contrast agent was performed for better detail of duodenal lesions. We reviewed CT findings with pathologic correlation in 41 patients with various duodenal diseases. Duodenal diseases were classified as follows; congenital (duplication, malrotation, diverticulum, and annular pancreas), trauma (intramural hematoma, iatrogenic perforation by endoscopy), inflammatory (perforated peptic ulcer, secondary process by pancreatitis or cholecystitis), primary neoplasms (lipoma, adenoma, adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors), secondary invasion of adjacent neoplasms (pancreas, stomach, colon, and gallbladder), bezoar, and postsurgical afferent-loop syndrome. Conclusion: Helical CT during the portal phase with water as an oral contrast agent provided a comprehensive view of the duodenum and adjacent organs. Understanding of CT anatomy and the pitfalls on CT interpretation was helpful in the diagnosis of various duodenal diseases. To investigate utility of MR volumetry for resectable rectal cancer before and after preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Methods: 104 patients with respectable locally advanced rectal cancer underwent preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Among them, 78 patients (55 men and 23 women; median age 55 years; range, 27-75 years) who had MRI before, and 1 month after concurrent chemoradiotherapy were enrolled into this study. Radiation of 45 Gy/25 fractions was delivered to the pelvis, followed by a 5.4 Gy/3 fractions boost to the primary tumor. Chemotherapy was administered concurrently with radiotherapy and consisted of 2 cycles of 5-FU (500 mg/m 2 / day) and leucovorin (20 mg/m 2 /day) for five days during the first and fifth weeks of radiotherapy. Surgery was performed 4-6 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation. MR volumetric examinations for tumor volume before and after chemoradiotherapy were perfomed in workstation software using T2-weighted axial images.",

MR findings were compared with evacuation proctography, considered as gold standard. Rectocele and pelvic floor descensus were graded either with the standard reference values, and with modified values obtained from normal volunteers. Results: MRI vs evacuation proctography identified 13/15 rectoceles, 25/28 anorectal junction descents, 7/9 rectal prolapses, and 4/6 diskinetic pubo-rectalis syndromes. MRI detected additional findings in 30% of patients (4 enteroceles, 10 uterine descents, 11 cystoceles, 4 perianal pathologies-abscesses, anal fistulas). MRI, using specific reference values provided 90% sensitivity, 93% accuracy, 84% NPV for the anorectal junction descent, while using conventional values provided 63% sensitivity, 75% accuracy and 57% NPV.

Static and spot lateral radiographs of the pelvis are obtained at rest, during squeeze and push, and during and after evacuation. If widening of the rectovaginal space (RVS) is observed during the dynamic phase, in the absence of an enterocele, a barium sigmoid enema is performed and further lateral films are obtained at maximum straining. Results: Widening of RVS was observed during ECD dynamic phase in 16 of the 73 patients (22%). Thirteen of these patients had small bowel loops prolapsing into RVS (enterocele). For the three remaining patients, in which the widening of RVS could not be explained by enterocele, we performed a sigma barium enema demonstrating the presence of a sigmoidocele.

All patients were referred to CT immediately after colonoscopy. CT was performed with 16 x 0.75 mm, 120 KV and 50 mAs in both supine and prone positions after colonic air insufflation. This method was well tolerated for all patients. Independently, two experienced radiologists interpreted axial, sagittal and coronal images and 3D endoluminal reconstructions (virtual colonoscopy). In cases of disagreement, the diagnosis was established by consensus. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and kappa test were analysed. Both methods were compared with Chi-Squared test. Results: In our series, the prevalence of colorectal polyps was 49%. When polyps were 5 mm in size or greater MDCTC had a 96% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 92% PVP and 99% PVN. The agreement between colonoscopy and MDCT was observed in 91%. No statistical differences were found between these methods. Conclusion: CT colonography is emerging as a potential alternative to conventional colonoscopy in the screening of colorectal cancer. 16 Row MDCTC represents a reliable imaging method to detection of colorectal polyps with a high accuracy, particularly when the polyp size is 5 mm or greater. This suggests an improvement over single slice CT.",

Materials and Methods: Twenty patients, aged 15-92 (median 67), were examined in a three year period, using helical CT without oral contrast administration and after intravenous injection of contrast medium. The clinical manifestations consisted of acute abdomen and/ or sepsis in all patients. The diagnosis of bowel ischemia was confirmed with surgery, where colonic and/ or small bowel resection was performed in 18 patients within 24 hours. One patient with the presence of portal gas was found to be normal at surgery and one patient died before surgery and had a confirmatory autopsy. Results: The causes of critical intestinal ischemia were diverse, including superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism in 3 (15%) patients, inflammation in 5 (20%), intussusception in 1 (5%), volvulus in 2 (10%), adhesions in 4 (20%), HIV infection in 1 (5%) and unknown etiology in 5 (25%).

Bartolozzi; Pisa/IT Purpose: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of single and multi row CT colonography (CTC) for detection of colorectal polyps. Materials and Methods: Between 1996 and 2003, seventy-two consecutive patients with a moderate to high risk of developing colorectal cancer underwent CTC followed by complete CC within 24 hours. CTC was obtained by means of single row CT (n = 20) and multi-row CT (n = 52). Sensitivity and specificity of single and multi-row CTC for detection of colorectal polyps was determined by means of lesion location in four colonic segments (cecum-ascending c-a, transverse t, descending d, sigmoid-rectum s-r). Results: All colonic segments were completely visualised in each patient both by single and multi row CTC study. CTC identified 63 polyps (< 6 mm) in 44 pa-tients (c-a N = 17, t N = 17, d N = 19, s-r N = 10) , and 33 polyps (6-20 mm) in 24 patients (c-a N = 5, t N = 3, d N = 12, s-r N = 13) . CTC generated 28 false positives (FP) for polyps smaller than 6 mm and 10 FP for polyps 6-20 mm. False negatives (FN) were 4 for polyps < 6 mm, and 2 for polyps 6-20 mm. Sensitivity of single and multirow CTC for detecting polyps were 80% and 89% respectively for polyps < 6 mm, and 83% and 94% for larger polyps 6-20 mm (p < 0.01). Overall sensitivity and specificity of CTC for small polyps (< 6 mm) was 88% and 87% respectively. Overall sensitivity and specificity increases for larger polyps (6-20 mm) at 94% and 96% respectively.

Subjects and Methods: Seventy-five consecutive paediatric patients referred for suspected CD underwent ileo-colonoscopy with biopsy and CE-PEG-MRI. The distal ileal mucosa was assessed by endoscopic and histological scores. The CD activity was measured by means of paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI). Results: Active CD was diagnosed in 26 cases, active ulcerative colitis (UC) in 18, spondyloarthropathy and indeterminate ileo-colitis in 11. In all CD patients CE-PEG-MRI showed a high concordance with endoscopy and histology. Of the 18 UC patients the CE-PEGMRI was negative in 15 and showed mild parietal contrast enhancement of the terminal ileum in 3 of the 7 patients with backwash ileitis. Among the group of SpA patients, CE-PEG-MRI was negative in 4 and revealed mild parietal contrast enhancement in 7. No increase in wall thickness in any of the UC and SpA patients was demonstrated. Sensitivity and specificity of CE-PEG-MRI were 84% and 100%, respectively.

Marano; Rome/IT Purpose: To assess the usefulness of sonography in celiac disease after small bowel loop filling by sonographic contrast medium. Materials and Methods: 33 consecutive patients with clinical suspicion or diagnosis of celiac disease were prospectively examined by US before and after (30'-40') drinking of 500-750 mL of an isosmotic water solution of polyethilene glycol. 14 patients had celiac disease (positive histology or AGA or EMA antibodies); 19 patients had previous celiac disease but were clinically negative, or had other benign disorders, and were considered as normal. Results: After contrast administration intestinal loops were better or slightly better shown in 12/33 and 16/33 patients (36.3% and 48.4%), or unchanged in 5/33 (15.5%). Among celiac patients, observed intestinal abnormalities were: segmental dyskinesia; transient intussusception; reduced number of jejunal folds; increased number of ileal folds; hypotonic dilated fluid-filled loops; increased intestinal motility. Extra-intestinal abnormalities in celiac patients were: spleen size reduction; mesenteric lymphadenopathy; liver steatosis; free peritoneal fluid. 4 celiac patients had no detactable abnormalities (false negatives); there were no false positives. Overall accuracy was 87.8% (sensitivity: 71.4%; specificity: 100%; PPV 100%; NPV 82.6%) Conclusions: Small bowel filling by sonographic contrast medium improves US evaluation of wall thickness, mucosal fold pattern, and intestinal motility. Transient intussusception was the single most diagnostic sign, whereas other features were less specific and of limited value unless found in combination.",

Miucin-Vukadinovic; Sremska Kamenica/YU Purpose: The goal of the study was to determinate and compare the value of MRI and transrectal US (TRUS) in the staging, and post-irradiation therapy restaging, of rectal cancer. This study was designed to evaluate the down-staging effect of preoperative radiation. Method and Materials: 34 patients (range, 38-86) with biopsy-proven rectal can-cer underwent imaging using a 1.5 T scanner and transrectal US (7.5 or 10 MHz transducer) before, and after radiation therapy (50 Gy, a daily fracton of 2 Gy, 5 days a week).Tumors were staged according to the TNM staging system. Two observers independently scored the tumor stage. The standard of reference was histopathology (after surgical resection). Results: All patients underwent radiotherapy before surgery for rectal carcinoma. Before radiotherapy MR examination detected 20.6% T2 (B1), 41.2% T3 (B2), 8.8% T2N1 (C1) and 29.4% T3/4N1 (C2) tumors. Down-staging of one or more T stages occurred in 44.1% with tumor regression in 23.5%. The MRI tumor stage agreed with the histological stage in 86% of patients. TRUS correctly staged 81% of lesions. T category was correctly restaged after preoperative radiation in only 61.8%. Conclusion: Preoperative radiotherapy is becoming the standard of care for resectable, locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum. MRI and TRUS enable selection of appropriate patients for preoperative radiotherapy. Preoperative TRUS can establish the depth of penetration of a tumor and showed less sensitivity for lymph node staging. MRI showed better diagnostic accuracy (with tendency for overstaging) then TRUS for interpretation of complete pelvic status in the pre-and post-irradiation period.",

Mikhailava; Vitebsk/BY Purpose: The objective of this study was to investigate the possibilities of noninvasive abdominal echography in efficacy evaluation of chronic peptic ulcer pharmacotherapy. Method and Materials: 87 patients with gastric ulcers in the exacerbation phase were examined before the course of pharmacotherapy and after it. Ultrasound investigation was carried out after administration of 400-500 mL deaerated liquid. On echography a chronic gastric ulcer was visualized in 84 cases. In the acute exacerbation phase the peptic ulcer was deep, filled with echogenic contents, the ulcer edge being sharp and overhanging. Periulcerous infiltration was hypoechogenic, 50-90 mm long, 6-12 mm thick, and its area made up about 400-900 mm 2 . The peripheral edge of periulcerous infiltration seemed sharp. In the course of effective treatment both ulcer dimensions and periulcerous infiltration area reduced on echograms. Periulcerous infiltration reduction speed made up about 10 mm 2 /day. The reparative process was also accompanied by ulcer flattening. In cicatrization the ulcer was not visualized on echograms, a hypoechogenic stripe 3-4 mm thick generally remaining. In the absence of reparation, the echographic picture of the ulcer and periulcerous infiltration didn't change essentially. Parallel endoscopic study of the stomach revealed either coincidence with echographic findings of qualitative characteristics of the reparative process positive dynamics or its absence. In 6 cases the results of ultrasound and endoscopic investigations didn't coincide; echograms showed slight infiltration with a central small echogenic area at the site of ulcer regarded as ulcer reparation, while endoscopy revealed a red scar. Conclusion: Thus, abdominal ultrasound investigation of the stomach enables reliable evaluation of gastric ulcer dynamics in the course of conservative treatment.",

Pastor; Valencia/ES Purpose: To describe the sonographic and CT features in right-side colonic diverticulitis and to differentiate this entity from other right-side acute abdominal conditions. Methods and Materials: 16 patients with a final diagnosis of diverticulitis of the ascending colon or cecum were retrospectively reviewed. Sonography was performed in all patients and CT in 13. The following findings were evaluated: the presence of an inflamed right colonic diverticulum, pericolonic infiltration, focal colonic wall thickening and the identification of a normal appendix. The diagnosis was confirmed by surgery, clinical course, or barium enema. Results: Sonography and CT showed pericolonic inflammation and focal colonic wall thickening in all cases. The inflamed diverticulum was seen with sonography and CT in 15 (94%) and 13 (100%) patients respectively. The normal appendix was identified with sonography in 7 (44%) and with CT in 5 (38%) cases. The initial diagnosis was: right-side colonic diverticulitis (n = 11), acute appendicitis (n = 2), perforated colonic carcinoma (n = 2) and an inflammatory mass (n = 1). Conclusions: Right-sided colonic diverticulitis is a condition that can clinically mimic other causes of right abdominal pain like acute appendicitis, perforated colonic carcinoma, salpingitis, ileocecal inflammatory pathology, epiploic appendicitis and omental infartion. In this series the most common sonographic and CT findings included the presence of a right colonic diverticulum with thickening of the adjacent pericolonic wall and pericolonic infiltration. Both ultrasound and CT can be extremely useful in the early diagnosis of this entity avoiding unnecessary surgery procedures, in a primarily benign and self-limiting condition that can be treated conservatively.",

As of June 2002, results had been obtained for 80 patients; and correlation between these results and grouping by contrast enhancement ratio was analyzed. Results: All patients in the highest-grade group (n = 10) had local recurrence. When only the highest-grade group was considered positive, there were no false positives and only one false negative.

Method and Materials: 119 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease underwent MRI in the context of a clinical evaluation including biochemistry, endoscopy, histology and radiology. All patients underwent MRI after oral administration of a superparamagnetic contrast agent, using standard sequences (HASTE T2weighted, with and without fat-suppression and Gd-enhanced T1-weighted FLASH). Two independent radiologists evaluated MR images on printed films. Disease length, presence of strictures, fistulae, abscesses, phlegmons and any other abdominal complication were evaluated at the level of each segment. Gold Standard (GS) for morphological assessment were: Barium studies, CT or US, and surgery when performed. At the level of the affected segments bowel wall thickness, T1 wall Gd-enhancement, T2 wall signal, T2 fibro-fatty proliferation signal were evaluated and graded (0-3) to assess disease activity. GS for disease activity were endoscopy, biological activity and CDAI. Results: MRI detected 90% of overall disease length, 75% of fistulae, 92% of strictures; adhesions were overestimated. In 11% of patients MRI showed complications requiring surgery (1 hydronephrosis, 4 abscesses, 5 phlegmons, 1 pancreatic duct stone, 1 enterovesical fistula, 2 ovarian involvements). The following MRI findings were statistically correlated with the clinical and biological signs of active disease: bowel wall thickness (r = 0.59), wall Gd-enhancement (r = 0.84), T2 wall signal (r = 0.80), T2 fibro-fatty proliferation signal (r = 0.76). Learning Objectives: To recognize usual and unusual radiologic findings of pseudomyxoma peritonei with pathologic correlation. Background: Pseudomyxoma peritonei is a rare neoplastic condition in which gelatinous intraperitoneal fluid collections associated with mucinous disseminated implants are observed. Although a ruptured appendiceal mucocele is the most common cause, pathologies arising from other origins may cause this condition with various imaging manifestations. Imaging Findings: The usual imaging findings were of mucinous, fluid-like material spread over the peritoneal cavity with organ scalloping observed in the liver, splenic and mesenteric margins, with central displacement of small intestinal loops. Within the material, cyst-like round structures may be observed and clarified by the septal enhancement on contrast-enhanced images. Punctate, annular, or curvilinear calcifications may be disseminated. Dropping appendiceal mucocele or a rare urachal tumor located in the female pelvis may simulate an ovarian tumor and be misdiagnosed as gynaecological disease. Demonstration of the continuity to the cecum or urachus was the diagnostic clue. Localized disease in the female pelvis may simulate ovarian carcinomatous peritonitis, and scalloping of the uterine margin may suggest this condition. Because synchronous mucinous tumors of the ovary and the appendix may occur, careful observation to detect the slight irregularity of the omentum adjacent to the cecum is necessary to avoid overlooking an occult primary appendiceal lesion. Conclusion: To recognize various imaging findings is important to make the correct preoperative diagnosis. In particular occult appendiceal lesions must not be overlooked. Multiplanar observation on CT and MRI was important to recognize the complex organic-pathologic relationships to identify the primary neoplasm.",

Kim; Incheon/KR Learning Objectives: To illustrate the CT findings of the different types of retroperitoneal cystic masses. Background: Retroperitoneal cystic masses, which arise within the retroperitoneal space but outside the major organs of that compartment, are uncommon. However, the widespread use of computed tomography (CT) for evaluating abdominal and retroperitoneal diseases has increased the detection rate of retroperitoneal cystic lesions. In this exhibit, we conduct a literature review and present the CT findings of our own patients to illustrate the CT appearance of different types of retroperitoneal cystic masses. Imaging Findings: A variety of CT features were identified in various retroperitoneal cystic masses. The disease entities include cystic lymphangioma, retroperitoneal mucinous cystadenoma, m\u00fcllerian cyst, cystic change of paraganglioma, epidermoid cyst, cystic teratoma, tailgut cyst, mucocele of appendix, perianal mucinous adenocarcinoma, cystic change of leiomyosarcoma after chemotherapy, pancreatic and nonpancreatic pseudocyst, lymphocele, urinoma, and hematoma. Conclusion: Knowledge of CT findings of various retroperitoneal cystic masses may be helpful for differential diagnosis. Learning Objective: Our purpose is to describe the CT and MR findings of cystic dystrophy of the duodenal and gastric wall in heterotopic pancreas (CDHP) which allows an accurate diagnosis of this pathology usually associated with chronic pancreatitis. Background: Cystic dystrophy in heterotopic pancreas is characterized by the development of cysts in heterotopic pancreatic tissue localized in the duodenal or gastric wall. Cyst formation is related to cystic dilatation of an anomalous duct bordered by pancreatic excretory epithelium, or to pseudocysts caused by pancreatitis of the heterotopic pancreas. We reviewed CT and MR findings in five patients with cystic dystrophy in heterotopic pancreas (CDHP). They underwent spiral CT (n = 5) and MR/ cholangio-MR (n = 2). Diagnosis was confirmed by endoscopic US in all cases. Three cases were pathologically proven after surgery. Imaging Findings: The CT and MRI findings of CDHP consists of cysts, (normally multiple), located in the inner wall of the second part of the duodenum and less frequently in the stomach. The duodenal or gastric walls affected are thickened and inflammatory changes are observed around the cysts. Signs of chronic pancreatitis are frequently seen. MR/ cholangio-MR shows high intensity lesions corresponding to the cysts. Conclusion: CDHP presents some CT and MR features which permit an accurate and reliable diagnosis. When a cystic lesion is found in the duodenal or gastric wall CDHP should be included in the differential diagnosis with other cystic masses such tumors or abcesses. , and thanks to its favorable  influence on serum glucose and lipid profiles, this technique is the preferred treatment for patients with severe type I diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease  (simultaneous pancreatic-kidney transplantation) . Therefore an understanding of the anatomic configuration and the spectrum of postsurgical complications is needed. Imaging Findings: We retrospectively reviewed computed tomographic scans (CT), ultrasounds (US) and doppler studies of 14 patients who had undergone pancreatic transplantation using portal-enteric drainage in our hospital between January 2002 and July 2003. We review the usefulness, limitations and potential pitfalls of CT and US. Acute postoperative complications, including acute rejection, transplant pancreatitis, peripancreatic collections and abscess, pseudocysts, vascular complications (thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm) and exocrine leaks, are depicted. Furthermore, CT-guided percutaneous biopsy and drainage is a safe and an alternative method for obtaining tissue from the transplanted pancreas with graft dysfuntion, and collections. Conclusion: Knowledge of normal anatomic configuration and the radiologic appearance of normal pancreatic transplant will allow proper interpretation and early treatment of the spectrum of portsurgical complications in this kind of pancreatic allograft. The more common current gastric bypass procedures include the Roux-en-Y procedure and bilio-pancreatic diversion with duodenal switch procedure. The more typical complications of these surgeries include anastomotic leaks and stenoses, both of which have been reported in the current literature. More atypical complications, however, have not been comprehensively demonstrated. Imaging Findings: Gastric bypass/gastric stapling is a common surgical procedure at our institution. We have encountered several atypical complications, documented with flouroscopic studies using water soluble contrast. We offer five unusual complications which include the following: Internal herniation through the small bowel mesentery, internal herniation through the transverse mesocolon, external herniation through the abdominal wall incision, enterocutaneous fistulas, Roux-en-Y configuration with anti-peristaltic inversion of the gastroenteric Roux limb, and incorrect anastomosis of the Roux limb with the excluded stomach (resulting in a Roux-en-O configuration). Conclusion: Our findings expand those of the current literature to include the more infrequent complications of gastric bypass surgery. In the fluoroscopic evaluation of post-operative gastric bypass patients, a thorough understanding of expected post-operative bowel configuration is essential. In addition to assessing anatomical abnormalities, it is equally important to assess for abnormalities of motility. In this study, we performed a retrospective review of the medical records and imaging studies of 37 patients with proven FMF, diagnosed between 1992-2002. Imaging Findings: The commonest clinical manifestation were recurrent peritoneal attacks with abdominal pain (75.6%) and fever (40.5%). Abdominal imaging findings included ileus (n = 12), focal peritonitis (n = 3), ascitis (n = 2), splenomegaly (n = 5), and hepatomegaly (n = 2). One patient developed fatal peritoneal mesothelioma, and 13.5% of patients developed amyloidosis with sonographic findings of renal parenchymal disease or cardiomyopathy. Arthritis was second in frequency occurring in 36.1% of patients. Radiographs were normal (n = 4) or showed joint effusion and soft tissue swelling (n = 4) due to synovitis. Two patients developed seronegative destructive arthropathy. Pleuritis was encountered in 13.9%. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) was present in 2 patients, multiple sclerosis in one, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia in one patient. Conclusion: FMF predominantly involves abdominal viscera but can affect other organs. The majority of patients have nonspecific imaging findings and the radiologic diagnosis is rarely considered. Amyloidosis, mesothelioma, and destructive arthropathy are potential serious complications of FMF. Polyarteritis nodosa, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia are rare associations or coincidence with FMF.",

To illustrate the spectrum of appearance of the disease in its various locations in the human body. To list the various imaging strategies. To discuss the differential diagnosis. Background: Mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma arises in extranodal mucosal lymphoid tissue and has only been recognized recently. It affects several extranodal structures such as the stomach, the lung, the eye and the salivary glands. It is generally low grade and has an indolent course, as it remains long confined to the initial site. In this exhibit we describe and illustrate the most common radiological patterns of MALT lymphoma.

The study group consisted of 10 men and 7 women (mean age 62 years). The predisposing factors of MALT lymphoma, number and location of lesions, and course of the disease were evaluated. We determined the most probable diagnosis on the basis of the radiologic findings and correlated them to pathologic and immunohistochemical findings of endoscopy, biopsy and bone marrow examination.10 out of 17 patients presented with MALT lymphoma of the stomach, 2 in the parotid gland, 2 in the lung, 2 in the large intestine (sigmoid colon, rectum), 1 in ileocecal valve and 1 in the orbit Rectal MALT lymphoma coexisted in one patient, and parotid gland and lung lymphoma in 2 patients.

Kaku; Oita/JP Purpose: Internal hernia of the anterior part of the abdomen (IHAPA) is difficult to diagnose preoperatively because of its rarity and lack of imaging landmarks. The purpose of this study is to clarify the CT features of IHAPA by CT, especially with multi-detector row CT (MDCT). Methods and Materials: The CT scans in 8 patients with surgically confirmed IHAPA through a transverse mesoclolon (n = 4) or an omentum (n = 4) were retrospectively reviewed; furthermore, the transverse mesocolic type was classified into intramesenteric type (n = 2) and transmesenteric type (n = 2). Special attention was paid to the herniated sac-like appearance, hernial orifice, running course of the omental fat and transverse colon. Results: The closed loop of the small bowel was observed in all cases. A sac-like appearance, enclosed by transverse colon was identified in both cases with intramesenteric type, but was not observed in other types of IHAPA. Fatty continuation between the hernial orifice and omentum was identified in two out of four cases with omental type of IHAPA. Furthermore, the transverse colon passed above to the hernial orifice in all cases with omental type, while this finding was not observed in any of the transverse mesocolic type. Conclusion: The relationship between the hernial orifice and transverse colon, and sac-like appearance enclosed by transverse colon are the diagnostic key of IHAPA on CT. Particularly, MDCT would become feasible to diagnose the IHAPA preoperatively, even though it lacks of vascular landmarks.",

Matsuki, H. Kani, I. Narabayashi; Takatsuki/JP Purpose: Gastric arteries and veins can vary between patients; therefore, it requires much time to ligate arteries, and veins can be damaged during regional lymph node excision under laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG). We evaluate the efficacy of fusion imaging of three-dimensional angiographies of arteries and veins around the stomach by the multiphase fusion technique under singlebreath hold using 16 row multidetector row CT (MDCT) in the preoperative simulation and intraoperative navigation of LAG. Methods and Materials: Contrast-enhanced CT scan using 16 DAS MDCT was performed on 10 patients before LAG. Images at both arterial and venous phases were obtained under a single-breath hold. Three-dimensional CT angiographies at the arterial and venous phases were reconstructed using the volume-rendering technique and then fused. 1) The detectability of the left gastric artery (LGA), right gastric artery (RGA), left gastric coronary vein (LCV), right gastric vein (RGV) and Helens' gastrocolic trunk (GCT) on the multiphase fusion images was evaluated in comparison with the surgical findings. 2) In intraoperative navigation, the clinical usefulness of multiphase fusion imaging was evaluated. Results: 1. In nine of ten patients (90%), the multiphase fusion images could demonstrate clearly, simultaneously and three-dimensionally the LGA, RGA, LCV and GCT without a respiratory gap. 2. We could arrange and rotate a multiphase fusion image to correspond to the operative view, which was very useful in the intraoperative navigation of LAG.",

Engelholm; Copenhagen/DK Interstitial brachytherapy is used in the treatment of anal carcinoma, so far without image guidance during needle positioning.The aim of the study was to describe a procedure for optimizing needle positioning guided by three-dimensional (3-D) endosonography. Twelve patients who received external radiation therapy for anal carcinoma were referred for interstitial brachytherapy under 3-D endosonographic guidance. The procedure was initiated by anal endosonography performed with a 10 MHz rotating endoprobe. Cross-sectional images of the anal sphincters were stored on a 3-D system during retraction of the endoprobe. Afterwards, any projection could be reconstructed. From this scanning the optimal positioning of the needles was determined. The needles containing radioactive isotopes were inserted through holes in an externally fixated disc. Repeated endosonography assured that optimal tumor coverage was obtained by adjusting the number, loading or position of the needles. In all patients endosonography was able to visualize the extent of the tumor and the position of each needle so that both the distance from needle tip to upper tumor border, as well as the distance from the anal orifice to the lower tumor border could be determined. In 8 patients endosonography showed a, at least 2 clock-positions larger circumferential tumor size than manual examination. This made an increase in number of needles necessary. In 5 patients endosonography influenced the extent of loading of the needles. In 2 patients endosonography led to a change in positioning of the needles. 3-D endosonography guidance of interstitial brachytherapy in anal carcinoma seems possible, which may influence the radiation coverage. To determine CT criteria that allows accurate classification of interstitial hernias. Methods and Materials: CT scans of 13 patients with surgically proved spigelian hernia (n = 7) or interparietal inguinal hernia (n = 6) have been retrospectively reviewed. CT assessment included: 1) Assessment of the hernial sac (anatomic situation, extension, content) and 2) assessment of the fascial defect (anatomic situation, relationship to the inferior epigastric vessels). Results: In all cases (n = 13), the hernial sac was located between the internal and external oblique muscles. The fascial defect was located at the spigelian aponeurosis, above the inferior epigastric vessels in the seven cases of spigelian hernia, and at the internal inguinal ring, lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels in the six cases of interparietal inguinal hernia. Conclusion: Assessing only the hernial sac does not allow accurate classification of interstitial hernias. Diagnosis is established by precise analysis of the anatomic situation of the fascial defect.",

Background: The early diagnosis of breast cancer is a challenge in breast imaging work-up. To detect malignancy in non-palpable breast lesions without unnecessary open biopsies, percutaneous biopsy of the suspect lesion should be undertaken. Percutaneous breast biopsy can be performed under sonographic or X-ray guidance. Whatever method is used, certain principles apply. Exhibit Details: The exhibit will be divided into subsections focusing on the indications and diagnostic limits of each procedure, the necessary equipment for each method and the steps taken to perform each procedure through sample cases. We will focus on practical issues such as needle size, site of entry, number of tissue probes that we need to take according to the lesion type. Also the avoidance of complications, and other useful tips will be presented. A special reference will be made to the histological findings that require surgical excision and the potential pitfalls in case of false negative samples. We will also present a short time follow-up diagram for the histologically confirmed benign lesions.

Purpose: Mammographic follow-up of patients after conservative treatment for breast cancer by screen-film mammography is difficult and sometimes impossible due to the post-radiation and surgical changes. Digital mammography (DM), with post-processing tools, might facilitate the reading. The purpose of this presentation is to evaluate the accuracy of DM and to describe the post-therapeutic changes in these patients. Materials and Methods: DM (Senograph 2000D, GEMS\u00ae) was performed in 77 patients 3 and 6 months after conservative treatment (surgery and radiotherapy) for breast cancer. Mammograms were indepedently read by two senior radiologists. Both radiologists performed screen-reading, using commercially available post processing tools (magnification, zoom, contrast inversion, thickness compensation). They evaluated the overall image quality. The following features were also analysed: breast density (according to BIRADS classification), skin thickening, parenchymal changes with glandular oedema (4 grades), scar and microcalcifications. Results: All DM were considered as of diagnostic quality by both radiologists. Importance of glandular oedema was correlated to breast density (BIRADS 4, n = 16; oedema 4, n = 14), (BIRADS 3, n = 41; oedema 3, n = 48). Analysis of skin and dermal thickness was facilitated by the algorithm of thickness compensation. Visibility of scars (n = 54) and microcalcifications (BIRADS 2, n = 21; BI-RADS 3-4-5, n = 6) was improved by digital magnification and digital contrast variations. Conclusion: Digital mammography due to the post processing tools seems to facilitate dramatically reading of mammography in patients with previous conservative treatment for breast cancer, and helps to delineate post-therapeutic changes.",

Therefore image quality comparisons show different results using optimized spectra for each digital system, compared to using the same spectrum for all systems. To show a short way to present breast MR dynamic imaging obtained using 1-mm 3 isotropic 3D acquisition and single-voxel proton spectroscopy. Background: During a standard breast MR exam, including a precontrast shorttau inversion recovery (STIR) or fast spin-echo T2-weighted fat-sat and a dynamic Gd-enhanced 3D sequence, at least 700 native and subtracted images are produced. Moreover, maximum intensity projections (MIPs) of a subtracted phase and dynamic curves must be shown. If performed, proton spectra could be given with localizing images, too. Procedure Details: Seventy breast MR exams were performed at our Department as follows: 40-slice axial STIR; 128 T1-weighted 3D gradient-echo coronal 1-mm partitions (384 x 192-mm field-of-view; 384 x 192 matrix; 1-mm 3 voxel) with 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-chelate and 120-s time resolution (4 postcontrast phases), giving 680 native and 512 subtracted for a total of 1192 images; single-voxel spinecho (TE 135 ms) proton spectroscopy. We present firstly an axial MIP of the first subtracted sequence similar to cranio-caudal X-ray mammography (XM) views, two lateral MIPs similar to lateral 90 degrees XM views, and a coronal MIP. Then, only selected images are presented: STIR, precontrast T1-weighted, and postcontrast subtracted images (morphology); percent enhancement-to-time curves for regions of interest (dynamics); proton spectra with/without choline peak at 3.14-3.34 ppm and lipids peaks (metabolism). Representative cases will be shown in correlation XM, ultrasound, and pathologic proof. Conclusion: Breast MR high-resolution imaging and proton spectroscopy can be effectively summarized in no more than 24 images (2 x 16-in-one films), 2% of the acquired/subtracted 1192 images.",

Procedure Details: All procedures were performed on a 1.5 T Philips Gyroscan Intera Unit. Standard CE breast MRI imaging protocol included a dynamic volumetric T1-weighted acquisition prior and after Gd-DTPA injection employing a bilateral surface coil. Localization was achieved either by employing a stereotatic device or by triangulation methodology with external markers with a flexible unilateral surface coil. Imaging acquisition was tailored to each case.

Background: Accuracy of pre-treatment diagnosis of breast carcinoma extension is essential in order to plan the most effective therapeutic approach. Extension of carcinomas can be difficult to interpret on 2D images, especially if their distribution is segmental or irregular. Also, additional multifocal or multicentric foci can be problematic to localize in respect to the main tumour and the anatomy of the remaining breast. It is furthermore important for breast surgeons to apprehend the extent of the disease in radiological images in order to plan the surgical approach.

Background: The rate of breast cancer recurrence is 1-2% per year. Follow-up of patients after conservative surgery includes a periodic clinical examination and a mammography every 6 months during the first 2 years and every year thereafter. Post-treatment changes may mimic or obscure recurrent cancer. Diagnostic problems are encountered with conventional imaging and fine-needle aspiration cytology. Increased vascularity and vascular permeability occurs in recent scars and inflammation; however majority of scars 6 months after surgery do not enhance significantly at MRM while all malignancies do. Imaging Findings: In our series all cases of proved recurrence showed over 70% maximum signal intensity enhancement at minute 1 and plateau or washout dynamic curve at MRM. Only two cases of scar showed more than 70% maximum signal intensity enhancement at minute 1 and the curve in all benign cases was gradual. The quantitative data should be always correlated with the morphology of enhancement curve. Irregular shape or margins and inhomogeneous enhancement proved to be important criteria for recurrence assessment.",

Its high negative predictive value may have an impact on follow-up of treated breasts. The correlations between enhancement parameters and histopathological findings were analyzed using stepwise multiple regression analysis, Student's-T test and Spearman moments correlation coefficients. Results: Significant correlations were determined between the presence of lymph node metastasis and tumor size (r = 0.397, p < 0.01), contour characteristics (r = 0.369, p < 0.05), and edge characteristics (r = 0.495, p < 0.01). A highly significant correlation was found between histological grades and qualitative enhancement patterns (r = 0.403, p < 0.01). Statistically significant differences were found between the groups with and without lymph node metastasis regarding enhancement in the 1 st minute (p < 0.01) and TIC slope (p < 0.05). A significant difference was found between the histological grades I and III regarding all quantitative enhancement parameters, whereas no difference was found between the grades I-II, and II-III. Conclusion: DCE-MRI helps to predict prognostic factors of breast cancer by revealing qualitative and quantitative enhancement features of the primary tumor. Additional morphological factors further improve our ability to predict lymphatic metastasis. We measured the number of vessels, the major systolic velocity (PS), the end diastolic velocity (ED), the resistance index (RI) and the glosing index (PI) appearing in all the slices we took. We noted the maximum and minimum values of all the above parameters that appeared in the same mass in different slices and calculated the differences. Results: For the benign tumors the mean values for the differences between the maximum and the minimum number of vessels was (DIFFVES) 3.26 (P < 0.00), the DIFFPS was 3.23 cm\u00b2/sec (P < 0.00), the DIFFED was 2.38 cm\u00b2/sec (P < 0.01), the DIFFRI was 0.12 (P < 0,03) and DIFFPI was 0.

Oh 2 ; 1 Sungnam/KR, 2 Seoul/KR Learning Objectives: To analyze the imaging and histopathologic features of fibroadenomas in kidney transplanted patients and to compare findings of fibroadenomas in kidney transplanted patients with those in a control group. Background: From 1990 to 1999, 1,438 patients underwent renal transplantation at our institute. All patients received immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporin A and steroid after renal allograft. We examined ten female patients who were diagnosed with fibroadenomas during chemotherapy, and compared the data obtained with that of fibroadenomas in the normal population. Procedure Details: Twenty-two fibroadenomas developed in ten patients. Eight of the 10 patients had multiple fibroadenomas and 7 had bilateral fibroadenomas. The mean diameter of the fibroadenomas was 4.17 \u00b1 2.5 cm. By mammography the lesions were spherical in shape and had a well circumscribed margin with a high density mass. None of the lesions showed calcification or spiculation. Sonographic findings of the masses showed relatively high echogenecity with higher L/T ratios than benign masses, however, features of homogeneous internal echo and well circumscribed margin were consistent with benign. Conclusion: The fibroadenomas that developed in patients with renal transplantation showed a tendency to be multiple, bilateral and larger than those in the control group. These fibroadenomas also exhibited a more rapid growth, a more spherical shape and an unusually high internal echo and higher L/T ratio than usual fibroadenomas. To present mammographic and ultrasonographic (US) findings in various types of reconstruction using autogenous myocutaneous flap after mastectomy or breast conserving operation. Background: Breast reconstruction is an integral part of a woman's breast cancer management and yields positive psychological benefits for the patient. Autologous tissue reconstruction has gained in popularity in part owing to adverse publicity regarding prosthetic implant safety. It can alter breast anatomy and architecture drastically. In this exhibit, we describe mammographic and US findings in the various types of reconstruction using autogenous myocutaneous flap after mastectomy or breast conserving operation. Procedure Details: Mammography and ultrasonography obtained in patients who had undergone reconstruction mammoplasty using the autogenous myocutaneous flap procedure were reviewed to facilitate recognition of both normal and abnormal postoperative appearances of the various types of reconstruction using autogenous myocutaneous flap after mastectomy or breast conserving operation. Normal mammographic and US findings include predominance of fatty appearance, surgical clips, and surgical scars. Abnormal mammographic and US findings include fat necrosis, calcifications, and locally recurrent carcinoma. US findings of fat necrosis were cystic, complex and solid appearing masses with circumscribed or ill-defined margins in peripheral portions of flap. US finding of locally recurrent carcinoma was ill-defined heterogeneous hypoechoic lesions in reconstructed breast, similar to those of primary breast cancer. Conclusions: Breast reconstruction using autogenous myocutaneous flap has increased in popularity with various methods. Mammography and sonography facilitated excellent visualization of normal and abnormal findings of various reconstructed breasts using autogenous myocutaneous flap.",

Background: We reviewed our records for the last ten years. During that time, 76,443 mammary studies were performed. All cases with extramammary pathology were selected. They were classified into two broad categories: those which had abnormal physical findings (palpable mass or skin thickening) and those with abnormal findings in the mammogram (calcifications, nodules and thickened lymphatics). Imaging Findings: Cases were classified as follows: Microcalcifications secondary to filariasis. We will see more of these cases due to increased immigration.

Nakajima, M. Fukuda; Kawasaki/JP Purpose: The aim of this study was to approach the reality of microcalcifications of benign and malignant diseases using synchrotron radiation imaging, and to make a comparison with conventional X-ray images. Materials and Methods: Surgical and biopsied specimens fixed in wax blocks were imaged using synchrotron radiation (SR), and conventional mammography unit (CONV) as well. Studied were 98 patients (40 benign, 58 malignant). SR imaging was performed at SPring-8 in Japan in refraction-enhancement mode. CONV images were evaluated visually using a magnifying glass. SR images were inspected on a monitor without magnification. Morphology of microcalcification was categorized to 3 groups: small round, amorphous (Am), and pleomorphic (Pl). Results: 1,319 calcifications were observed in 98 CONV images and 9,225 calcifications in SR images. 7,906 of 9,225 (86%) were invisible in CONV images. SR imaging revealed that great numbers of specks were recognized collectively as a single calcification in CONV images, and 949 of 1,319 calcifications in CONV images were found to consist of multiple specks. The incidence was especially higher in Am and Pl types (602/755 and 187/204, respectively). Comparing malignant with benign diseases, there was a striking contrast in Am-type calcifications; majority of Am-type calcifications in malignant diseases were found as collectives of fine specks (84/432), to the contrary 69/170 in benign (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Synchrotron radiation imaging showed that majority of amorphous and pleomorphic type calcifications, especially of amorphous type of malignant diseases, in conventional images were essentially collectives of multiple specks.",

The effects of various hormone regimens, selected according to the gynecological status, were evaluated by two radiologists. Wolfe classification and a new scoring system were used to assess the change of mammographic density. The new scale divides each breast into ten wedge shaped slices on the CC positioned mammograms. Change of density is scored according to the number of slices, which have an increase of density in comparison with the baseline mammograms. The results were statistically evaluated to compare the effects of various hormone regimens using a control group of 75 patients who did not receive any hormonal therapy.

The purpose of this presentation is to analyse its clinical, mammographic, and ultrasonographic features, with histopathological correlation. Materials and Methods: In a retrospective review of 472 consecutive histologically proven carcinomas of the breast, 14 pure (tubular component of at least 75%) tubular carcinomas were found (2.97%) in 12 women (age 54 \u00b1 10 yrs). Results: Three lesions were palpable. On mammography, five were not detectable; the remaining presented as nodules with spiculated (3 lesions) or irregular (2) margins, spiculated nodules with microcalcifications (2), distorsion (1), or asymmetric density (1). On US, 1 lesion was not detectable; the remaining presented as hypoechoic lesions with irregular (12) or well defined (1) borders. For 12 tumours, diagnosis of carcinoma was made with cytology; in 2 cases core biopsy: in the first a complex sclerosing lesion with atypical cells was suggested, in the second differential diagnosis between tubular carcinoma and sclerosing adenosis was proposed. Lesion size was 10.1 \u00b1 5.1 mm. Only in 1 patient were metastatic axillary nodes found. Conclusion: In our series, tubular carcinoma presented mainly as a non-palpable, small-sized lesion, with non-specific mammographic patterns and a hypoechoic ultrasonographic appearance.

Oda, T. Kubota, H. Satake, A. Sawaki, T. Ishigaki, Y. Nimura; Nagoya/JP Purpose: We report a new method for an adequate segmental resection of nonpalpable breast cancer employing an interventional technique using three-dimensional images of contrast-enhanced CT. Materials and Methods: Eight patients with non-palpable breast cancer (DCIS 6, invasive carcinoma 2) were included in this study. Diagnosis of carcinoma was made by cytology, but the extent of the lesion could not be clearly shown by US. One hour before the operation, contrast-enhanced helical CT was performed using a Toshiba Aquilion (Toshiba Corp. Tokyo) with the patient in the supine position, following the insertion of VATS (Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) markers (Hakko, Japan) under US guidance. CT scan was performed 75 seconds after the injection of contrast medium. The detector row configuration was 4 x 1-mm. Maximum intensity projection (MIP) was performed on three-dimensional reconstruction (3D-CT). Using three-dimensional images of CT, anatomical relationship of VATS markers, nipple and carcinoma demonstrated as a well-enhanced focal-clumped lesion or segmental lesion was evaluated and lines of resection with 2 to 3 cm surgical margin were designed. Curative resection was confirmed in X-ray films of resected specimens based on the relationship between the lesion and the VATS markers in preoperative three-dimensional CT images. Results: In all 8 cases, adequate segmental resection with cancer free surgical margins was accomplished and the cosmetic results of the surgery were satisfactory. Conclusion: Three-dimensional images of contrast-enhanced CT with this interventional technique is a useful method to design resection lines for non-palpable mammary carcinomas.",

Materials and Methods: A questionnaire (33 items) about these practices was sent to 755 radiologists three months after medical continuing education (May-December 2002) . The answers were analysed with chi-square test. Results: 225 radiologists completed the questionnaire; 102 radiologists practiced breast screening; 211 used the BI-RADS classification; 204 radiologists followed-up the abnormality with a short interval, 36 made a biopsy and 11 overclassed the image; 148 radiologists asked for advice from other radiologists, 49 from an expert, 45 submitted to a multidisciplinary committe and 15 asked for a second reading. A short interval-follow-up disturbed 115 radiologists about an eventual unfavourable evolution of the abnormality and 57 radiologists about legal problems; 36 had difficulty in explaining to patients the short interval-followup. The median of the scale (0 to 10) of the radiologists perceived stress is 3. Conclusion: These French radiologists have consistent practices with the BI-RADS classification and the ANAES recommendations. They may have difficulties in explaining the procedure to patients.

Materials and Methods: The first model mammography screening project in Germany has been running in Bremen for the last two years. All women between 50 and 70 years of age have been offered mammography and any suspect findings were investigated by core biopsy. These cases were reviewed in the Pathology Dept. of the University M\u00fcnster and discussed at a weekly multidisciplinary meeting. Lesions were classified using the 5 point B classification scale as recommended by the European Union. Results: In the first two years of the screening project, a total of 22000 women had mammography. Suspicious areas were detected and core biopsies were obtained from 401of these women. 46 % were classified B5 (malignant) 46% of these cases were classified B1,2 (regular breast tissue, benign) and 8% of these cases were classified B3 and B4 (atypia probably benign, suspicious of malignancy). In 90% of all cases there was agreement amongst the reviewing histopathologists, but in 10% there was no interobserver consensus. These disagreements centered on flat epithelial atypia, atypically hyperplasia and papillary lesions.",

Oda, T. Imai, T. Ishigaki; Nagoya/JP Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of multi-slice CT for nonpalpable breast lesions with microcalcifications, compared with mammographic findings. Materials and Methods: 40 cases with nonpalpable microcalcification of the breast recommended for biopsy on MMG. They included 26 malignant lesions (ductal carcinoma in situ, n = 18; ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion, n = 8) and 14 benign lesions (mastopathy, n = 6; intraductal papilloma, n = 2; other, n = 6). On multi-slice CT images, the presence of focal or segmental enhancement in the region consistent with microcalfications was regarded as positive diagnosis for malignancy. All mammographic and CT findings were assessed with a consensus between two radiologists. Results: 4 cases of benign lesions pathologically were assessed as \"suspicious malignant\" on MMG, while, in three of them, focal or segmental enhancement appeared on multi-slice CT. Although seven cases of breast cancer were assessed as \"probably benign\" on MMG, six cases acquired focal or segmental enhancement on CT. For cancer diagnosis, the sensitivity of MMG and multi-slice CT were 69.2% and 96.0%, specificity was 71.4% and 57.1%, and negative predict value were 58.8% and 88.9%, respectively.

We fully illustrate the morphology, contrast enhancement and mobility of myxomas in rare locations such as the right ventricle and unusual attachment to the tricuspid valve. Background: Although benign myxoma is the most common primary cardiac tumor (25%), it remains a rare finding with an incidence of 0.5 per million population per year in the western world. Myxomas are found in the left (75%) or right (20%) atrium and seldom in the ventricles. These pedunculated tumors typically arise from the atrial septum near the fossa ovalis and much less frequently from the mitral valve. Intracardiac obstruction and systemic emboli are the major complications. Imaging Findings: Myxomas in an uncommon cardiac location should be differentiated from other primary (malignant) and secondary (thrombus; metastasis) cardiac tumors. MRI allows visualization of the narrow pedicle, its attachment and the changing tumor shape and mobility during the cardiac cycle, unlike most malignant processes. In contrast to most thrombi, myxomas have low signal intensity on cine gradient-echo images and show contrast enhancement. The water-rich myxomatous stroma, fibrous stroma, calcifications and hemorrhage account for the heterogeneous T2-weighted SE images. Increased interstitial space in the myxoid region and inflammatory zones enhance after intravenous Gd-DPTA on T1-weighted SE images. Lobular tumor surface and higher volume increase the pre-and postoperative risk for systemic emboli. Furthermore, the exact location on MRI is most helpful in planning the surgical access. Conclusion: Myxomas in uncommon locations can be differentiated from other cardiac tumors by evaluating tumor morphology, mobility and enhancement.",

Caro 3 ; 1 Cordoba/ES, 2 Jaen/ES, 3 Cadiz/ES Learning Objectives: To describe an adequate protocol to study patients submitted to Ross procedure with MR. To identify and quantify postsurgical complications in this group of patients with MRI. B D E F A G Background: Ross procedure is widely accepted as one of the best methods for aortic valve replacement, especially in children and young adults. Ultrasound is usually used in their follow-up, but tit offers a limited evaluation of the right outflow tract, being important to discard homograft stenosis. MRI overcomes the limitations of ultrasound and may replace the number of digital subtraction angiograms traditionally performed in the follow-up of these patients. Procedure Details: We describe step by step our MR protocol, to study patients submitted tothe Ross operation. Examples of the MR features of common presentations and complications are shown from our series of 53 patients. Our protocol consists of the following steps: \u2022 Black-blood coronal and transverse turbo spin echo T2-weighted images. \u2022 CineMR gradient-echo sequences allow functional qualitative assessment of themotion of valves and chambers, the detection of either valvular regurgitation orstenosis, and areas of altered myocardial contractility or relaxation. We perform GRE-CineMR sequences in left two chamber, right two chamber, fourchamber, short axis (at several levels from the apex to the base), left ventricular outflow tract, right ventricular outflow tract, and aortic rootviews. \u2022 Phase contrast images are performed to obtain quantitative data about magnitude anddirection of blood flow through the right and left ventricular outflow tracts. Conclusions: CMR allows an accurate evaluation of patients submitted to Ross procedure and identification of the postsurgical complications. The causes of focal outpouching of the left ventricle are as follows: 1) true aneurysm; a chronic complication of myocardial infarction, which contains the endocardium, epicardium, and thinned fibrous tissue replacing the myocardium, 2) pseudoaneurysm; a consequence of rupture of the ventricular free wall due to acute infarction and confined by the pericardium, 3) diverticulum; a congenital outpouching of ventricular wall including all of three layers, and 4) hibernating myocardium due to chronic ischemia with paradoxical outpouching at systole. MR imaging is useful in differentiating these causes by using variable imaging sequences to evaluate the myocardial contractility, perfusion and viability. In this exhibit, we will show the usefulness of MR imaging to differentiate these pathologies using various MR imaging sequences. Imaging Methods and Findings: Cardiac MR imaging methods include; 1) cine imaging for wall motion analysis, 2) first pass myocardial perfusion imaging, and 3) delayed enhancement imaging. Images were obtained along the short axis and horizontal long axis of the heart. By analyzing the shape, contractility, motion, perfusion, and contrast enhancement, it is possible to differentiate the causes of the outpouching lesion of the left ventricle. Conclusion: Cardiac MR imaging is useful in differentiating various causes of focal outpouching of the left ventricle.",

Results: 9 pts (of 20) had a positive dynamic study of heart chambers dimensions and volumes in early postoperative stage. In the area of prostheses signal of low intensity was defined in all the patients (artifacts). Narrow flow of low signal intensity along the prostheses leaflets corresponded to normal function of prosthesis (46 of 50 valves). 4 pts had signs of mechanical valve dysfunction (3mitral paravalvular leaks, 1 -aortic prosthetic valve stenosis). MRI data were in agreement with the results of echocardiography. MRI was able to diagnose such postoperative complications as atelectasis (4), mediastinal haematoma (2), pleuritis (2).

Left ventricle Echo-densitometry performed in long-axis views from left parasternal border at ES/ED with following percentage cyclic variation indexes (CVI) calculation. SPECT was performed 16-20 hrs p.i. of 750 MBq 99mTc-WBC and 10 min p.i. of 99mTc-MIBI. Results: All patients were divided into 3 groups based on scintigraphic data: first group -20 patients with diffuse leukocytes uptake that considered as IMI; in second group there were 21 patients with local leukocytes uptake and abnormal MP (IMI+MF); third group consisted of 12 patients with only MF. Control group patients (n = 7) had normal MP and no leukocytes uptake. CVI was 38 \u00b1 10% in controls; 10.6 \u00b1 21% in 1 st ; -5.2 \u00b1 22% in 2 nd and -19 \u00b1 23% in 3 rd group. CE-MRI was able to detect IMI in 88% of patients. Regression analysis revealed good correlation between IMI by CE-MRI and by WBC-SPECT (r = 0.70, P < .01). Furthermore, good correlation was found between CVI and 99mTc-MIBI uptake (r = 0.51, P < .01) both for IMI and MF detection. Conclusion: CE-MRI enables exact detection of IMI as compared to WBC-SPECT.",

Background: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), using radiofrequency energy, for treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) has been associated with complications including pulmonary vein (PV) stenosis or thrombosis. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the PV morphology following cryoablation. Method: 50 patients underwent percutaneous PVI in 3 academic centers. Contrast-enhanced, single-slice or multi-slice spiral CT (1-2.5 mm thick slices) was obtained before, 3 and 12 months following PVI. All examinations were read blinded to the location(s) of ablation. PVs were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively: the diameter at ostium and at 1 cm from ostium were measured. The presence and location of luminal irregularity or thrombosis was also assessed. The aims of this study were comparison of the local myocardial contraction between the myocardium with DE and without, and evaluation of myocardial DE's prognostic significance in patients with congestive heart failure due to nonischaemic DCM.

Choe; Seoul/KR Purpose: To determine feasibility of contrast-enhanced MRI (ce-MRI) at true enddiastole (ED) free from limitation of time for inversion-recovery and trigger window for quantifying transmural extent of infarction. Methods and Materials: MRI was performed in 18 patients with myocardial infarction. Cine imaging and ce-MRI with same registered slices in short axis were performed. To allow true ED ce-MRI, ECG synchronization should use two RRintervals for one acquisition of a segment of k-space by setting the heart rate to half that of the true heart rate. Trigger delay time was adjusted to the RR-interval for imaging at ED and to the sum of RR-interval plus the time between R-wave and the end-systole (ES) determined in cine images for imaging at ES. Results: Wall thicknesses of the ED and the ES ce-MRI were greater than those of the ED and the ES cine images (7.5 \u00b1 1.3 mm > 6.2 \u00b1 1.4 mm, 9.4 \u00b1 1.8 mm > 8.6 \u00b1 1.8 mm respectively).

Among them, systolic wall thickening was observed with cine imaging in 8 patients and the transmural extent of hyperenhancement measured on ED ce-MRI decreased by 5-30% on ES ce-MRI proportional to the degree of systolic thickening of the epicardially nonenhanced myocardium. Transmural hyperenhancement in 4 patients showed no difference in thickness between enddiastole and end-systole. Conclusion: Ce-MRI at ED is constantly possible by using two RR-interval per acquisition of a segment of k-space and useful to avoid the variation in infart sizing with irreproducible cardiac phase other than end-systole in case of subendocardial infarction.",

All CT and MR examinations were quantitatively and qualitatively read blinded to the location(s) of ablation. Results: For CT, the mean diameters at LA-PV junction and at 1 cm from ostium were 1.6 (0. (1996.1-2002-6) . Associated cardiac and extracardiac anomalies were evaluated on fetal echocardiography. Postnatal diagnosis or autopsy were correlated with fetal echocardiography. Results: In 30 fetuses with right aortic arch, combined congenital cardiac diseases were as follows, TOF (8), VSD(1), and DORV with pulmonary stenosis (1) . Associated extracardiac anomalies were oligohydramnios(2), arthrygryposis(1), splenic cyst (1), and shortening of long bones(1). On postnatal echocardiography, previously non-diagnosed VSD were found on two neonates and TGA without VSD in one neonate. Overall incidence of combined cardiac defects is about 43.6%. Conclusion: Right aortic arch associates variable cardiac defects and extracardiac anomalies in about half of fetuses. Prenatal diagnosis of right aortic arch must be followed further echocardiography and targeted fetal sonography for exact diagnosis.",

Method and Materials: 72 consecutive patients with \u03b2-thalassemia major (35 treated by DF and 37 by L1) underwent, at enrollment and after one year treatment, heart MRI (1.5 T unit) with an electrocardiogram-triggered gradient-echo T2 weighted sequence. Liver MRI was obtained at the same time in all patients. Measurements of the heart to muscle signal intensity ratio (HSIRs) were compared between the two groups and with laboratory parameters, liver iron concentration (LIC) and liver to muscle signal intensity ratio (LSIRs). Results: HSIRs were significantly increased in DF (t = -2.8; p = < 0.01) and L1 group (t = -3.1; p = < 0.01) after one year treatment. No statistically significant difference in the values of HSIRs was present between the two groups at the beginning (p = 0.25; t = 1.13) and after one year treatment (p = 0.20; t = 1.28).

Methods: 107 patients (80 male and 27 female, mean age 49 \u00b1 8 yrs) who had history of myocardial infarction and resting regional left ventricular dysfunction were examined. Blood supply, regional myocardial oxidative metabolism and regional metabolic substrate utilization were assessed by SPECT at 3-5 and 35-40 min after i.v. injection of 400 MBq with 123 I-PDA. Echocardiography with low doses of dobutamine was used for measuring inotropic reserve. Results: Early 123 I-PDA SPECT demonstrated high specificity in diagnostics of perfusion defects (up to 85%). The delayed images showed foci of remaining higher activity in regions of ischemic, but viable myocardium. 387 of a total of 1050 myocardial segments had abnormal resting wall motion. In 189 of them no oxidative metabolism and inotropic reserve were detected, that indicated scarred myocardium. 314 of them were considered to be viable as they demonstrated both oxidative metabolism and inotropic reserve. Conclusion: 123 I-PDA as an agent for simultaneous perfusion and oxidative metabolism evaluation may be used for identifying myocardial viability. Diagnostic value of this method in combination with low doses of dobutamine echocardiography even in the cases of severe myocardial metabolic damage is nearly equal to PET with 18 FDG and should be applied for detection of viable myocardium.",

Zvezdin 1 ; 1 Novi Sad/YU, 2 Belgrade/YU Purpose: Aim of prenatal diagnostics of obstructive heart lesion is to make right decision about the way leading further pregnancy, and decision about the time, place and way of labor. Sensitivity and sensibility of fetal echocardiography are very high -between 95 and 98%. Methods and Materials: 2 648 fetuses were examined in period of seven years. 40 fetuses with the diagnosis of some obstructive lesions of the heart were investigated. Control group was made of 120 fetuses with normal echocardiograms divided into four groups according to gestational weeks. Echocardiographic techniques used: M-mode, 2 D and Doppler techniques. Results: Examination were made between 20 and 39 weeks of gestation. All cardiac structures show linear growth with progression of pregnancy. Both halfs of the fetal heart are the similar size. 32 obstructive lesions of the left heart and 8 lesions of the right heart were diagnosed. There is statistically significant difference in size of the left and right structures in fetuses with obstructive lesions according to each other and also the same structure of the normal fetal heart. Conclusions: Obstructive lesions of the left heart were diagnosed much more frequently (80%) than the obstructive lesions of the right heart (20%) in the examination material. Left heart hypoplastic syndrome was dominated lesion-75% of obstructive lesions of the left heart and 60% of all diagnosed obstructive lesions. Difficult obstructive lesions are progressive, have poor prognosis and present one of the indications for abortion. Background: Encouraged by beautiful cardiac multislice CT (MSCT) images presented at radiology and cardiology meetings, and by the favorable preliminary reports on high diagnostic value, more and more radiologists consider starting up their own cardiac MSCT program. The quality of the examinations initially obtained then, however, often does not live up to the high expectations. Procedure Details: A common cause for insufficent image quality is the poor attention to detail during image acquisition. In fact cardiac MSCT depends on the skill and dedication of the CT-technician. As an international training center for cardiac MSCT, we have noticed some common mistakes likely made by less experienced operators. Generally, the basic procedures issues tend to go wrong: e.g., positioning the patient, placing the ECG-electrodes, choosing appropriate filtering, applying basic cardiac anatomy and physiology knowledge, etc. We will provide a step-by-step \"how-to\" pictorial with tips and tricks for successful cardiac CT imaging, illustrated by many examples of \"right and wrong\". Issues addressed include handling of patient and workflow, data acquisition, and standardized image post-processing. Conclusion: A step by step approach to Cardiac MSCT scanning prevents scan failure.",

Chan; Stanford, CA/US Learning Objectives: 1. Describe tomographic imaging techniques for assessment of sinus venosus defects (SVD). 2. Illustrate intra and extracardiac anomalies during MDCTA and MRI-MRA for SVD. Background: SVD with associated partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR), accounts for 1-2% of congenital heart anomalies. Clinical presentation is nonspecific and thus, diagnosis relies on imaging. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) have been established as standard for this purpose. However, both are invasive and not without risk. MDCTA and MRI-MRA are alternative noninvasive means to image these patients. MRI offers the additional benefit to assess shunt ratios with cine phase contrast (PC) sequences. In this exhibit, we highlight our experience with MDC-TA and MRI-MRA in 9 exams having surgically proven SVD-PAPVR. Procedure Details: Five exams were performed on 8 or 16 channel MDCT. Contrast was injected at 4 cc/sec, employing bolus trigger technique. Two of the 16-MDCT were retrospectively ECG-gated with 0.625 mm thickness. Non-gated studies were acquired at 1.25 mm, with a pitch of 1.35-1.375 and rotation time of 0.5-0.6 seconds. Sequences employed in the four MRI-MRA exams included ECGgated T1, balanced steady state free precession, PC, and 3D-SPGR angiography. 3D post-processing employed volume rendering and maximum intensity projection techniques. Conclusion: Anatomic defect size and location; number of abnormal veins) and dynamic evaluation for SVD-PAPVR corroborated TEE, DSA, and/or surgical findings. We identified on all MDCTA, a jet of contrast crossing the defect into the left atrium (CT shunt sign). Our preliminary experience indicates tomographic imaging is a reliable noninvasive alternative to TEE and DSA for assessment of SVD-PAPVR. To sensitize radiologists to the application of reformatting and 3D-reconstuctions in cardiac CT which depict the coronary arteries in a manner consistent with standard catheter angiography in routine clinical practice. To demonstrate a step by step approach to acquistion, optimized reconstruction techniques, and read-out algorithms in the evaluation of the coronary vessels. Background: Recent advances in the temporal and spatial resolution of MDCT have opened the door to the use of CT in routine cardiac diagnostics, which is evolving rapidly as a noninvasive method. CT coronary angiography has compared favorably with conventional catheter coronary examinations, however new reconstruction and visualization methods are continuously being developed and are often lacking in meeting the demands of the routine clinical setting. It is crucial that radiologists become attuned to the standard approach to the coronary angiogram used in clinical cardiology so that advantage is not lost in the competition to provide services. Procedure Details: In this educational module, we present a step by step assessment of coronary vessels based on 3D-reconstructions of isotropic MDCT datasets with special consideration to projections and visualization techniques which correspond with the standards of clinical cardiology. Optimization of time consuming 3D renderings of ECG triggered datasets as well as read-out algorithms are demonstrated in examples for normal coronary vessels in addition to representative cases of coronary artery pathology. The resulting effective temporal resolution is 94-188 msec (depending on heart rate and reconstruction algorithm). Larger volumes can be studied with isotropic spatial resolution and higher temporal resolution. The capability to scan larger volumes increases the feasibility and the accuracy of this technique in the visualisation of coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). The scan protocol to evaluate CABGs with 16-row MSCT is described. Different types of conduits (arterial and/ or venous), artefacts (surgical clips) and distal anastomoses of the graft are illustrated with DSA correlation. Furthermore, atherosclerotic graft's disease (stenoses and occlusion) as well as native coronary artery disease is displayed with DSA. Conclusion: ECG-gated 16-row multislice CT coronary angiography with 0.375 s gantry rotation time provide improved image quality in the evaluation of CABG.",

Materials and Methods: 53 patients with suspected diagnosis of coronary artery disease were examined by MSCT and PET. MSCT data was obtained using Siemens Volume Zoom CT scanner. Retrospectively ECG-gating image reconstruction was conducted. PET was performed on Ecat-Exact-47 (Siemens) with 13N ammonia at rest and during pharmacological test with vasodilatators (adenosine, dipyridamole). Results: The first group comprised 16 (30.2%) patients without stenoses in coronary arteries according to the results of MSCT. PET also didn't detect reduction in perfusion of myocardial ischemic genesis in these patients. The second group included 10 (18.9%) patients with low-grade (< 50%) stenosis of coronary arteries. In these patients PET at rest and during stress didn't reveal a reduction in perfusion of myocardium. Invasive coronarography was not performed for the 1 and 2 groups. The third group included 23 (43.4%) patients with different grades of stenosis in coronary arteries, according to the MSCT. There was reduction in perfusion in the corresponding myocardial segments revealed during at rest and/ or stress-PET. There was invasive coronarography done for these patients, which confirmed the existence of stenosis. Methods and Materials: Ten volunteers (M:F = 8:2, mean age 55) without ischemic heart disease and 34 consecutive patients (M:F = 20:14, mean age 56) with ischemic chest pain underwent CT coronary angiography (Sensation 16, Siemens, Germany). Reconstruction was done around -400 ms from R peak and multiplanar reformation and volume rendering were included. Myocardial bridge was determined by demonstration of tunneled segment dip into myocardium. Invasive coronary angiography was performed in 12 patients. Results: Twelve tunneled segments in LAD were detected in two volunteers (20%) (n = 2) and 9 patients (26.5%) (n = 10). Nine were located in middle LAD (2 in volunteers, 7 in patients) and 3 in distal LAD (in patients). with 4 to 36 mm in length, 0 to 4.5 mm in greatest depth. The cross-sectional areas of tunneled segments were 39% smaller than those of the just proximal and 10% smaller than those of just distal to the tunneled segments. Calcification in LAD was detected in 1 volunteer and 4 patients with myocardial bridge but not in tunneled segment itself. Significant stenosis was detected in proximal LAD of two patients and mild stenosis in one patient which were confirmed by invasive coronary angiography. Five patients showed only myocardial bridging in LAD without coronary arterial stenosis. Conclusion: MSCT directly visualizes tunneled segment within myocardium and gives useful information about myocardial bridging and neighboring coronary arteries.",

Roobottom; Plymouth/UK Purpose: To evaluate retrospectively ECG-gated multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) for the full evaluation of secundum and sinus venosus atrial septal defects (ASD), in adults, in comparison to trans-esophageal echocardiography (TOE). Materials and Methods: Twelve patients undergoing TOE for further assessment of presumed ASD, as a prelude to definitive treatment, also underwent retrospectively ECG-gated multi-detector row CT. The multi-detector CT scans were compared to TOE for defect and pulmonary vein visualisation. Secundum ASD sizing; measurements, before possible device closure, were compared, and virtual angioscopy of the right atrium was evaluated for direct, three-dimensional defect visualisation. Results: Larger secundum ASDs (greater than 2.0 mm) were well visualised with multi-detector row CT, but smaller defects and sinus venosus defects were not. For maximal secundum defect size there was a mean difference between the techniques of 0.9 mm (limits of agreement minus 5.5 to plus 3.6 mm). Overall there was moderate agreement for the defect and rim sizing measurements. Pulmonary venous drainage was universally fully and correctly evaluated with multidetector CT, which compared favorably to TOE. Virtual angioscopic visualisation of secundum defects was possible in 4 patients, but the images produced were considered of limited clinical value. Conclusions: Retrospectively ECG-gated multi-detector row CT offers alternative imaging of ASD in adults, allowing visualisation of significant secundum defects, pulmonary venous drainage and defect sizing. Further investigation, to establish the accuracy of defect and rim sizing measurements and to re-explore direct defect visualisation with advanced post-processing tools, is required.",

Methods: 220 patients were studied. CTs were performed in a 4-row CT scanner with 4 x 1 mm collimation, 0.5 mm slice increment and 130 mL of non-ionic contrast. Ten patients with MB diagnosed with MSCT were evaluated with Nuclear Medicine (NM). Rest and stress studies were performed with 30mCi Technetium 99m Sestamibi. Segmental analysis were performed on 18 segments within the short axis plane (6 basal, 6 mid-ventricular and 6 apical) in both methods. Positives NM findings were defined as a perfusion defect within a segment at both rest and stress. Positives CT findings as hypo-intense region within a segment. Results: All the MBs were placed in the LAD. DA detected 11 cases, whereas MSCT only 10. The sensitivity was 90.9% and the specificity 100.0%. In 3 cases the MB of the LAD had greater diameter in the 95% phase and they were compressed in the 75% phase. Six cases showed ischemia in the NM studies. There were 4 true-negatives, 5 true-positives and 1 false-negatives findings. The sensitivity was 83.3% and Specificity 100%, Positive predictive value was 100% and the negative predictive value was 80%. Conclusion: MSCT can detect the presence of MB in coronary arteries. It is essential for this identification a multiphase reprocessing of the CT data and can also detect the presence of myocardial perfusion defects. To predict the local, gonadal, thyroidal and eye dose with and without different protection devices in retrospective-gated multi slice CT of the heart. Material and Methods: Radiation dose was measured with an Alderson phantom and a digital dose meter with and w/o an infradiaphragmatic lead drape, a cervical lead protection and an eye shield. Measurements were done with the ionization chamber placed over the heart, uterus, thyroid gland and eyes. Helical CT of the heart was performed with an Aquilion MSCT (Toshiba). The dose was determined with slice collimation and pitch between 1 and 2.5 using constant voltages and current-time-products for retrospective gated CT. Results: Local dose over the heart ranged from 142 to 584 \u00b5Sv. Gonadal dose was determined with 61 to 190 \u00b5Sv w/o lead protection and 23 to 39 \u00b5Sv using a circular infradiaphragmatic lead drape, meaning a gonadal dose reduction of up to 80%. With use of protection devices the dose to the thyroids could be reduced by 36.5% and 39% in terms of using an eye shield. Conclusion: Radiation causing gonadal dose in cardiac CT is predominantly extracorporal radiation and only in a lesser degree due to scatter radiation from inside the body. An effective dose reduction of 80% can be achieved by consequent use of a circular lead drape closely adapted to the inferior helical range. The use of organ adapted shields covering the thyroids or eyes mainly results in a decrease of the surface dose and is recommended as well for all patients receiving cardiac CT. Images were acquired using a 4-row spiral CT scanner with 0.5 s gantry rotation time. In all patients detailed clinical, ECG, US and scintigrafic (when available) data were collected in order to identify the presence of MI. When a patient with MI was found, MDCTA images were analyzed on both axial and multiplanar reconstruction in order to confirm the presence of an infarcted area. Results: Our study population included 33 patients who previously underwent coronary percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stent placement (a total number of 45 stents) and 14 patients with previous by-pass surgery. After clinical assessment, MI was found in 17 patient (9 septal, 4 apical, 3 anterior wall of left ventricle, 1 infero-septal). MDCT was able to detect the presence of MI in 14/17 cases (82.3%), showing a regional hypoattenuated area and wall thinning. In all cases, localization and extention of ischemic area were perfectly correlated with clinical known data. In two patients with sub-endocardial involvement, MI could was not detectable with MDCT. In one patient the presence of motion artefacts affected image quality and myocardial scar wasn't visualized.",

Material and Method: 37 patients underwent cardiac MDCT (8 DAS) (Aquilion8, Toshiba, Japan) to obtain coronary angiography. Scan data were subsequently reconstructed at 10 different kinds of phases in ECG wave. These methods can be classified as follows according to the used wave in ECG; 1).The center of the reconstruction phase is positioned at the peak of T-wave (method T-p), the end of T-wave (method T-e) and the midpoint of descending curve of T-wave (method Tm). 2).The end of the reconstruction phase is positioned at the peak of P-wave (method P). 3).The center of the reconstruction phase is positioned using nterval (method R30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80) . All patients were classified into 3 groups according to their heart rates (HR) (group 1; HR < 60 (n = 14), group 2; 60 < HR; < 70 (n = 10), group 3; HR < 70 (n = 13)). Two radiologists assessed image quality in blind fashion and scored as follows (2:good,1:fairly, 0: bad). Bonferroni/dunn test was performed for statistical analysis. Results: In group 1, significantly better image quality was achieved in method P, RR70, RR80 than other methods. Among them, highest image quality was obtained by method P. The best result was obtained by method P in group 2 and Tm in group 3. Conclusion: Optimal image reconstruction phase in MDCT coronary angiography shifts from late diastolic phase to late systolic phase as heart rate increases.",

Background: A variety of pulmonary complications occur in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients and are a major cause of morbidity and death. Imaging Findings: HRCT is useful in detection of pulmonary abnormalities, but these findings are generally non-specific. These complications, which reflect the immunologic status of the patients, occur in three phases. This pattern can be used to interpret CT scans. The neutropenic phase (up to 3 weeks after BMT) is characterized by fungal infections, alveolar haemorrhage, pulmonary oedema, and drug reactions. At CT, fungal infections like angioinvasive aspergillosis appear as nodules surrounded by a halo of ground-glass attenuation; alveolar haemorrhage and drug reactions, as bilateral areas of ground-glass attenuation or consolidation. The second phase (3 weeks to 100 days after BMT) is dominated by cytomegalovirus pneumonia, which appears as multiple small nodules with areas of consolidation or ground-glass attenuation, and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia again mostly as ground-glass attenuation. The late phase (more than 100 days after BMT) is characterized by bronchiolitis obliterans revealing bronchial dilatation and a mosaic pattern of attenuation, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP), the CT findings usually being patchy consolidation or ground-glass attenuation and chronic graft-versus-host disease. Conclusion: If CT findings are considered in relation to the time elapsed after BMT, diagnostic options can be narrowed sufficiently to enable accurate diagnosis.",

However recognition and early diagnosis of these lesions may allow for conservative treatment and excellent patient outcome. The aim of this study is to illustrate the CT findings of variable benign tumors of tracheobronchial tree and correlate with the pathologic findings. Imaging Findings: This study included 15 patients with benign tracheobronchial tumors which were confirmed histologically by surgical resection (n = 13) or bronchoscopic biopsy (n = 2). The tumors were classified the anatomic locations of the lesions into trachea (n = 4), bronchus intermedius (n = 1), lobar bronchus (n = 8), and segmental bronchus (n = 2).

This interactive presentation will allow the reader to test himself, comparing his own subjective estimation to the real volume computed from 3D shaded surface displays (SSD). To outline the usefulness and ease of post-processing with spiral CT to obtain a true assessment of the pleural fluid volume. Background: Assessment of the volume of pleural effusions is very imprecise both on chest X-ray and axial chest CT slices. The amount of fluid may be required by clinicians for therapeutic purposes. 3D SSD of the effusion provides rapid computation of its volume. In this exhibit we will recall the physiopathologic mechanisms involving the preferential locations of pleural effusions. We will show pleural effusions of various volumes on chest CT along with the corresponding chest X-rays and the precise volume of the effusion computed from 3D reconstruction. Procedure Details: Various cases of free or collected pleural effusions on spiral chest CT (CT Twin and MX 8000 IDT), are presented, including coronal and sagittal reformations. CT images stand along with the corresponding chest X-ray, obtained in the upright and supine position, and with the computed volume of the effusion using 3D reconstruction. Conclusion: Pleural volumetry is readily available using spiral CT data recontruction.

Background: Pulmonary edema, a frequent cause of acute dyspnea, can be clinically difficult to detect. HRCT is crucial in suggesting this diagnosis, particularly when pulmonary embolism is suspected. Actually, bolus intravenous injection of iodinated contrast in case of pulmonary edema may worsen heart failure and lead to patient death. Imaging Findings: The HRCT signs of pulmonary edema are usually divided into interstitial and alveolar patterns, and both can be associated. Classic signs of interstitial edema, which accounts for 70% of cases, are peribronchial and peribronchovascular thickening, septal lines, ground glass opacity, pleural effusion, cardiac enlargement and pulmonary veins dilatation. Alveolar edema is characterized by bilateral, patchy or coalescent areas of airspace consolidation, predominantly basal and perihilar. Butterfly pattern is found in 5% of cases. Atypical patterns are due to preexisting lung or heart disease, such as right upper lobe edema related to mitral regurgitation, or heterogeneous distribution of edema due to preexisting lesions of emphysema or constrictive bronchiolitis. Highly selected cases will be used to illustrate typical and atypical patterns.",

To review the radiological findings of smoking related interstitial lung diseases and their pathologic correlations. 2. To provide some radiological clues for the correct diagnosis. Background: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) represent a heterogeneous group of lung disorders of known or unknown cause. Recently, it has been appreciated that cigarette smoking is related to the development of several ILDs including desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RIBLD), pulmonary Langerhans'cell histiocitosis (PLCH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Procedure Details: We reviewed the plain radiograph, CT, and HRCT findings of four intersitital lung disorders that have been linked to smoking.

Background: Paraquat is a widely used herbicide that has toxic effects on the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Paraquat has been known to induce acute pulmonary fibrosis, causing progressive respiratory failure and death. In Japan, 5% paraquatdiquat product has been used since 1986, in place of 24% paraquat product,. However, there is no report that compares the influence these products have on the lung. Procedure Details: There were 39 patients from whom chest X-rays were taken, and 22 of those (56.4%) had abnormal findings, which were composed of 10 ground-grass patterns, 4 reticulogranular patterns, 4 pulmonary edemas, 4 cardiomegalies and pulmonary congestions, 2 pneumothoraxs, and 1 mediastinal emphysema. Pulmonary edema was found only in the patients with 24% paraquat intoxication; in all cases, the plasma paraquat concentration was much higher than others. All reticulogranular patterns were found a few days later, and those in the patients with 5% paraquat-diquat intoxication were potentially reversible. Conclusion: 24% paraquat product has more influence on the lung than 5% paraquat-diquat product. Pulmonary fibrosis caused by 5% paraquat-diquat product is potentially reversible.",

The HRCT examinations were assessed retrospectively by two radiologists, and the presence and character of bronchiectases were noted. Results: Bronchiectases were seen in 22 patients (58%). In 15 of them the \"signet-ring sign\" and \"tram track sign\" were seen, with lack of normal tapering. Bronchi were visible in peripheral lung areas, within 2 cm from the parietal pleura in 10 patients. 4 patients had varicose bronchiectases with the typical \"string of pearls\" appearance. In 2 patients, cystic bronchiectases were seen, presenting with the picture of \"cluster of grapes\". Conclusions: Bronchiectases is very often seen in patients with pneumoconiosis, especially in advanced stages. HRCT is the modality of choice to diagnose the presence of small bronchiectases and bronchiolectases. Typical HRCT patterns include \"signet-ring sign\", \"tram track sign\", lack of normal tapering, and visible bronchi in peripheral lung areas, within 2 cm from the parietal pleura.

Biopsy of 14 lesions revealed NSCLC in 8 cases (5 adenocarcinoma, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 large cell carcinoma, 1 adenoid cystic carcinoma). Of these 3 were stage I (37.5%); 2 stage II (25%); 2 stage III (25%) and one stage IV (12.5%). 6 were benign lesions (3 hamartomas, 1 lymph node, 2 fibrosis). In 2 cases the PET was negative, in 3 cases the nodules resolved after antibiotics; 2 participants refused biopsy. Conclusion: Low-dose spiral CT seems to be a promising method for screening lung cancer. Our preliminary cancer screening results with low-dose spiral CT, demonstrated a prevalence of asymptomatic cancers in 1.98% of a smoking population including a high proportion of early tumor stages.",

The final diagnosis by resected specimen of these cases were 3 type B, 4 type C and 2 type F peripheral adenocarcinoma. We compared HRCT findings of them to identify the CT density in each tumor. Results: Though the final pathological findings show 3 type C tumors, the specimen by CT guided biopsy show only type A or B tumors. Further more, though the final pathological findings show 2 type F, not having a replacement growth pattern, the specimen also show type A or B, having a pure replacement growth pattern. Conclusion: Pathological mismatched findings between CT guided biopsy and resection were observed. Additional CT image comparison between mediastinal and lung window settings gave us probable information about the tumors having replacement growth patterns or not. Before performing CT guided biopsies, image recognition about the solid density helped us choose the most suitable biopsy site. With more thorough information derived from HRCT and biopsy on the types of tumors patients have, physicians can offer patients more accurate prognosis. Purpose: To analyze high-resolution CT (HRCT) findings in asthmatics and control subjects, and to evaluate the relationship between HRCT findings and pulmonary function tests in asthmatic subjects. To try to evaluate the correlation between the bronchial wall thickening (BWT) with pathologic findings and reflect the thickness of epithelial basement membrane on basis of the HRCT findings. Materials and Methods: Using HRCT, the author analyzed the ratio of BWT, the frequency of bronchial dilatation, the extent of air trapping and centrilobular nodules. In addition, the author assessed HRCT findings of 52 asthmatic patients for correlation with pulmonary function tests and then obtained bronchoscopic biopsy at the second divisional branch of 12 patient among the 52 asthmatics. The author measured the thickness of the epithelial layer and basement membrane after H-E stain and then statistically compared with BWT on HRCT. Results: Among the total 52 asthmatics, BWT on HRCT showed significant correlation with FEV1 (p = 0.006) and TLC (p = 0.012). PEFR (p = 0.04) shows significant correlation with the air trapping on HRCT statistically. Among the 12 patient of 52 asthmatics, BWT on HRCT shows statistically significant correlation with basement membrane thickness on pathology, but not with epithelial layer thickness on pathology (p = 0.023, r = 0.642).",

On the other hand, an image processing computer software extracted several quantitative measures of the shape of each nodule from DICOM data of HRCT images.

Conclusion: HRCT is a more sensitive method of evaluating pathologic process in lungs of CF patients than LFT.

Bj\u00f8rtuft; Oslo/NO Purpose: To evaluate the clinical value of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of patients after lung transplantation. Materials and Methods: HRCT with insp-and expiratory scans was performed in 36 patients (19 women, 10 single-and 26 double lung-, including two heartlung transplanted) who had survived for 11 months or more. The median followup time was 36 months (range 11 to 72 months). Air trapping was evaluated on expiratory scans constructed from two short spiral scans in two levels with minimum intensity projection (MINIP)-reconstruction. The degree of air trapping was classified on a 0 to 16 scale according to the affected surface area. A score of 3 or more was defined as significant air trapping. Results: 13 patients developed the bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) as defined by reduction of pulmonary function test results to less than 80% of the best postoperative values after a median time of 12 months. 10 of these had an air trapping score of 3 or more. Among patients without BOS (n = 23), 7 patients showed significant air trapping. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of a score of 3 or more in the diagnosis of BOS were 77, 70 and 72% respectively. Bron-chiectasis developed more frequently in BOS than in non-BOS patients (69 and 39%, respectively).

All patients underwent inspiratory and expiratory HRCT as well as forced spirometry, maximum voluntary ventilation, somatic plethysmography and cardiopulmonary exercise test. HRCT images were evaluated for the presence and distribution of low attenuation areas. Objective quantification of low attenuation areas was obtained by determining the relative area of pixels representing lung tissue with a density below -910 HU (Pixel Index). The resulting pixel index was determined for a single slice at the upper middle and lower zone. Results: Pulmonary function parameters correlated well with pixel index during expiratory scan. There was significant correlation between the upper part of the lung and forced vital capacity (FVC),%FVC, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) and total lung capacity (TLC). The middle part of the lung correlated with FVC, FEV1, FEF25-75 and resistance. The lower part of the lung was also correlated with FEV1, FEF25-75, residual volume (RV) and total resistance. Pixel index during inspiratory HRCT scans did not correlate with pulmonary function tests. Conclusions: Expiratory HRCT in asthmatics correlates well with pulmonary functions, which suggests that in asthmatics substantial gas trapping may occur during expiration because of severe airway narrowing and/or airway closure.",

Methods and Materials: 19 HIV positive patients were referred to the special infectious diseases unit and 11 non-AIDS immunocompromised patients were referred to the oncology unit of our hospital with a diagnosis of clinically suspected pulmonary infection. All patients were evaluated with HRCT (1.5 mm collimation, 10 mm interval, 140 kvp, 175 mAs, and 1-s scan time).

Results: All patients in both groups had the typical findings of PCP, such as presence of ground glass appearance (patchy or diffuse), consolidation (focal or diffuse), bronchiectasis or bronchioloectasies, septal thickening, cysts and nodules. The incidence of consolidation, especially diffuse, was a significantly higher finding in non-AIDS patients (p = 0.029).

Grenier; Paris/FR Learning Objectives: To be familiar with the postprocessing procedures after multi-detector row CT (MDCT) which can optimize the assessment of airway and lung disease. Background: Axial slices are considered as the gold standard for analysis of airways and lung diseases. Since the era of MDCT, excellent reformations, and 3D reconstructions have become available and frequently used in case of airway disease. Infiltrative and cystic lung diseases may also benefit from these techniques, provided that they are optimally used. Procedure Details: All 2D and 3D reconstruction techniques available were retrospectively applied on MDCT volume data set from patients with airway and/or lung disease, using various parameters. Optimized multiplanar volumetric reconstruction and 3D CT bronchography are particularly well adapted for assessing tracheobronchial stenosis and bronchiectasis. Maximum intensity projection is recommended for assessing small nodular and mosaic perfusion patterns. Minimum intensity projection is helpful: 1) To detect and assess ground glass opacity; 2) To visualize the airways within any lung parenchymal lesions, helping guide selective bronchial aspiration and bronchoalveolar lavage; and 3) To depict bronchial adenolectasia in patients with COPD or bronchiectasis. Virtual endoscopy is particularly helpful in depicting tiny nodulation of the tracheobronchial mucosa in granulomatous and malignant diseases. Highly selected cases will be used to illustrate the most striking additional information provided by postprocessing techniques in airway disease, infectious lung disease, and diffuse infiltrative lung disease.",

Moreno De La Santa; Vigo/ES Learning Objectives: To asses the useful of volume rendering 3D images (VR) in the evaluation of rib fractures using a 16-slice multidetector CT. To compare VR and conventional images in determining the number and location of fractures. To describe the advantages of VR over conventional images. Background: Multislice CT has improved the resolution in evaluation of traumatic patients because it permits thinner slices and multiplanar reconstructions with near isotropic voxel. However, the number of images to be evaluated is greater and the diagnosis of rib fractures remains difficult due to the obliquity of costal arches in the axial view. We evaluated chest CT examinations in 54 patients with rib fractures. In this exhibit, we describe CT technique, reconstruction parameters and the advantages of VR over conventional images to ensure number and location of rib fractures. Procedure Details: A 16-slice multidetector CT was performed using the following parameters: 90 mAs, 120 Kv, 16 x 1.5 mm collimation, during a single breath hold. Images were reconstructed with 3 mm thickness, 50% overlapping and soft tissue kernel filter (B40). Two experimented radiologists analysed axial, multiplanar and VR images. The number of fractures, location and part of arch fractured (anterior, medium and posterior) was described. Conclusion: Volume rendering is more accurate than conventional images in determining the presence and location of rib fractures, particularly when arches are fractured in more than one site. Also, it is a less time consuming technique with better diagnosis confidence. We recommend its use in a routine practice for chest-CT in traumatic patients.",

Twodimensional reformation images including multiplanar reconstructions (MPR), multiplanar volume reconstructions (MPVR), and three-dimensional reconstructions (external and internal rendering) were obtained at a workstation (Vitrea 2; Vital Imaging). The main applications of MSCT in airways disease as well as its limitations and pitfalls are emphasized. Specific topics addressed include congenital airways anomalies (anomalous origin of bronchi, vascular rings, tracheomalacia, bronchopleural fistula), extrinsic airways compression, tracheal and bronchial wall infiltration (bronchogenic carcinoma, angiosarcoma), intraluminal airways masses (carcinoid tumor), inflammatory diseases and posttraumatic and iatrogenic airways injuries. Conclusion: MSCT provides very high-quality image postprocessing (multiplanar and three-dimensional images), overcoming limitations inherent to SDCT. Additional benefits include preprocedural planning for bronchoscopy and surgery, and a more comprehensive spatial anatomy for both radiologists and referring physicians.",

Entwisle; Leicester/UK Learning Objectives: To illustrate the utility of ultrasound-guided supraclavicular lymph node aspiration in the cytological diagnosis of lung carcinoma. We describe our preliminary experience in 19 patients over the last 4 months. Background: Lung carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer death in the UK. Histological diagnosis traditionally requires invasive techniques to obtain tissue, such as bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy or image-guided lung biopsy. We have introduced this technique in patients who have at least N2 disease on staging CT. If positive, this helps both to stage the patient and provide a cytological diagnosis. It may prevent the need for more invasive techniques, such as percutaneous lung biopsy or mediastinoscopy. Procedure Details: All patients were scanned and nodes over 10 mm in size were aspirated under ultrasound guidance, using a 21 gauge green needle. A capillary \"coring\" technique was employed, without suction and aspiration. The samples were then expelled from the needle into cytospin fluid, for cytological examination. The procedure could be performed without local anaesthetic and as an out patient. Of the 19 patients examined, 16 had significant lymphadenopathy. Of these, 12 had positive malignant cytology, although 2 had indeterminate cell type. 4 samples showed no evidence of malignancy and PET confirmed no evidence of supraclavicular nodal involvement in 1 case. Conclusion: This is a promising non-invasive technique in the staging and diagnosis of patients with lung cancer.",

From the native raw data, four sets of simulated raw data were generated with 60, 40, 20 and 10 effective mAs, respectively. From each raw data set, CT slices were reconstructed with 1.25 mm thickness and 0.8 mm increment, and with a soft tissue kernel. Three readers who were blinded to the patients names and to the simulated mAs levels analyzed the CT series twice, in random order. PE in 6 central pulmonary arteries (PA) and 20 segmental PA were graded with a four-point scale. Agreements (Kappa statistics) and readers performances using 90 mAs as the gold standard were calculated. Results: All PE seen at 100 mAs were depicted at all lower radiation dose levels. Intraobserver agreements were independent from the radiation dose but strongly depended on the reader's experience. Agreements were good for central PE but only moderate for peripheral PA branches. Accuracy of low-and lower dose CTPA ranged from 95 to 100%, and were independent from the radiation dose (p < 0.001) but not on the reader. Conclusion: Reducing the radiation dose during CTPA is feasible with high accuracy, and may have less influence on CTPA interpretation than may have changing the reader or repeating a reading.",

Methods: 20 patients were examined with standard chest scanning protocol. After scanning, images were reconstructed with smoothing filter. Both set of images were filmed under the same conditions. In blinded assessment, three radiologists independently rated films for overall image quality and chest anatomic details (1 -unacceptable, 2 -substandard, 3 -acceptable, 4 -above average, and 5 -superior). For all exams and reconstruction filters image noise were measured in relation to the descending thoracic aorta. Results: For all three readers overall image quality was higher for standard filter. Image quality for standard protocol was 3.75 and for images reconstructed with smoothing filter 2.97. Average image noise for images reconstructed with standard filter was 36.4 and for images reconstructed with smoothing filter the noise was 15.8. All three radiologists rated greater chest anatomic details for standard protocol images. For both protocols the best-rated detail was that of the trachea and main bronchi (4.15 standard, 3.18 smoothing), and the worst was that of the esophagus (2.87 standard, 2.20 smoothing). The greatest difference between rates of the two protocols was for paratracheal tissue (3.41 standard, 2.27 smoothing) and the smallest for carina and lymph node area (3.31 standard, 2.67 smoothing). Conclusion: Standard filter is better in visualization of all anatomic detail in general chest exams including mediastinal structure and lymph node area.

Prassopoulos 1 ; 1 Alexandroupolis/GR, 2 Ottawa, ON/CA Learning Objectives: To present the spectrum of imaging findings that allow the differentiation of acute pulmonary embolism (APE) from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary artery hypertension (CTEPH) based on chest radiography and helical computed tomography (CT). Background: Patients with a prompt diagnosis of APE may recover completely following anticoagulation therapy. In a minority, pulmonary emboli do not completely resolve leading to organization, artery obstruction and ultimately to CTEPH. Although the evolution process of APE to CTEPH has not been fully elucidated, the distinction of the two entities is critical since the treatment of APE is conservative, while CTEPH warrants pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Imaging Findings: Radiographic findings of APE are nonspecific and include atelectasis, peripheral consolidation and pleural effusion. Localized lung oligemia with associated dilatation of a central artery is extremely rare. Right ventricular and central pulmonary enlargement, patchy oligemia and peripheral scars may be seen in CTEPH. The cardinal signs of APE on CT angiography are central or completely occluding arterial filling defects, which may be associated with peripheral airspace disease and pleural effusion. Eccentric filling defects adherent to the vessel wall, irregular intimal thickening, abrupt vessel narrowing or tortuosity are features of CTEPH. Dilatation of central arteries, abrupt vessel cut-off and peripheral scars are more common in CTEPH than in APE but arterial webs, bands and mural calcifications are only observed in CTEPH. If arterial findings suggestive of CTEPH are present, the addition of mosaic oligemia on HRCT is pathognomonic of CTEPH. Conclusion: CT allows differentiation of APE from CTEPH.",

Unfortunately, medical treatment of the primary pulmonary hypertension by prostacyclin (PGI 2 ) can be fatal in veno-occlusive disease and an early pre-therapeutic diagnosis of this uncommon condition is critical. So, the aim of the study was to evaluate CT of the chest as a non invasive approach of this disease.",

CT scans were compared with the CT scans of 15 consecutive patients with a pathologically confirmed primary pulmonary hypertension. Results: Ground glass opacities were significantly more frequent in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (p = 0.003), abundant, with a random repartition, and a preferentially centrilobular distribution (p = 0.03). Sub-pleural septal lines, and adenopathy were also significantly more frequent (p < 0.0001). The association of these three findings appeared to be quite pathognomonic of pulmonary venoocclusive disease as the cause of pulmonary hypertension (specificity = 100%) with a 66% sensitivity. Conclusion: On the initial pre-therapeutic chest CT, association of ground glass opacities (particularly with a centrilobular distribution), septal lines, and adenopathy are indicative of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease in patients displaying pulmonary hypertension. Caution must be taken before initiating vasodilatator therapy in the presence of such radiological abnormalities. .0 x 1.6 mm 3 ) was performed during and after a single injection of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight of Gadomer. Image data was compared to pre-embolism Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI and post-embolism thin-section Multi-Slice CT (n = 2). SNR measurements were performed in pulmonary arteries and lung. Results: One animal died after induction of PE. In all other animals, perfusion MRI and MRA could be acquired after single injection of Gadomer. At perfusion MRI, PE could be detected by typical wedge-shaped perfusion defects. While the visualization of central PE at MRA correlated well with CT, peripheral PE were only visualized by CT. Gadomer achieved a higher peak SNR of the lungs compared to Gd-DTPA (21 \u00b1 8 vs. 13 \u00b1 3). Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced 3D perfusion MRI and MRA allow the assessment of PE using a single injection of the blood pool contrast agent Gadomer.",

Goh; Singapore/SG Purpose: To compare thin-slice (3-mm) maximum intensity projection (MIP) reconstructions with 3 mm axial scans for detection of acute pulmonary emboli. Materials and Methods: Multi-detector CT pulmonary angiography (4 x 1 mm, 1.5 pitch; 0.5 sec) was performed in 18 patients. From each raw data set, axial 1 mm and 3 mm scans were reconstructed. Thin-slice (3 mm) MIPs in axial, coronal and rotational planes were reconstructed from 1 mm axial data using a 3D Workstation. The 90 data sets were reviewed for evidence of embolus on a per vessel basis by 2 radiologists with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Emboli demonstrated on the axial 1 mm images were taken as standard for comparison. Results: Pulmonary emboli were detected in 336 vessels (mean of 18.7 emboli per patient) with 35.8% in subsegmental arteries. The thin-slice MIP images demonstrated more emboli as compared to axial 3 mm images. Axial and rotational 3 mm MIP images detected most of the emboli (95.2% and 92%). Significant advantage of axial and rotational 3 mm MIPs over axial 3 mm images was seen at subsegmental artery level (92.5% and 89.2% versus 41.7%) (P < 0.05).

We used a single-slice spiral CT scanner (24 sec., 3-5 mm collimation), with iv contrast injection at high flow rate. Both pulmonary parenchyma and vasculature were evaluated, along with the enhancement pattern of the endoluminal lesions. Results: In all 3 cases, the left main pulmonary artery was affected (the distal segment in one case and proximal segments in two). In one patient, the right main pulmonary artery was also involved. All the vascular lesions were occlusive, without anterograde flow and extravasal diffusion. In two patients, contrast enhancement of the endoluminal mass was better detected in the delayed scan. In one patient, contrast enhancement had a periferical distribution. In all the patients, there were no parenchymal signs of thromboembolic disease. Conclusions: Primitive angiosarcomas of the pulmonary arteries are associated with occlusion of the main pulmonary artery and lack of parenchymal signs. As the differential diagnosis between massive thromboembolic disease and primitive angiosarcoma may be difficult with monophasic CT scan, the evaluation of the contrast enhancement of intraarterial lesion in the delayed phase becomes fundamental. Purpose: To demonstrate the imaging features of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTPH) on chest CT scans and to evaluate the correlation between the extent of mosaic pattern of lung attenuation and hemodynamic measurements. Methods and Materials: Chest CT scans of 50 patients with CTPH were reviewed to assess vascular and parenchymal changes. In all patients diagnosis was confirmed by surgery. The diameter of the main pulmonary artery (PA) and the ratio of the diameters of the main pulmonary artery to the ascending aorta (rPA) were correlated with mean pulmorary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. Mosaic attenuation was quantitated by adding the number of abnormal lobes (including lingula, score 0-6). This score was correlated with the hemodynamic measurements. Results were analysed by regression analysis and Spearman's correlation. Results: Thrombi were observed in the central pulmonary arteries in 79% of cases. In all CT scans a mosaic pattern of lung attenuation was found. Scars related to the pleural surface were identified in 69% of cases, bronchial artery collaterals in 60%. CT scans showed dilated PA in 98% and rPA \u2265 1 in 90%. Mean pulmonary artery pressure correlated more strongly with rPA than with diameter of PA. The score of mosaic attenuation showed a strong correlation with pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.66; p < 0.0001).

Background: Breast cancer is a common cancer in women and is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer-related deaths in women. The thorax is a common site of metastasic disease and complications related to surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation. Imaging Findings: The purpose of this exhibit is to review the CT and MR findings of the various intrathoracic manifestations occurring in patients with breast cancer. These include complications related to direct extension of tumor, to metastatic spread, and complications secondary to treatment. The complications can be divided into those that affect the chest wall (chest wall invasion, chest wall metastases, axillary and internal mammary lymphadenopathy, local recurrence, postradiotherapy sternal and costal tumors, surgical complications), mediastinal and hilar manifestations (lymphadenopathy, abscess formation, lymphatic obstruction), pulmonary manifestations (lymphangitic carcinomatosis, pulmonary metastases, endobronchial metastases, neoplastic emboli, lung infections related to immunosuppressive therapy, obliterative bronchiolitis post bone marrow transplantation) and pleural manifestations (pleural effusion, pleural metastases).

Background: Bronchogenic cysts are one of the congenital cystic lesions in the chest. It has variable appearances on imaging and overlapping features with other mediastinal lesions. It is often identified incidentally. Imaging Findings: We reviewed the imaging on 30 proven bronchogenic cysts. Plain radiographs and CT images were available for all cases. MRI images were available in 8 cases. Most of bronchogenic cysts have a classic mediastinal location and well defined margin on plain films, with homogeneous low density appearance on CT. However they can be found within the lung parenchyma, be cystic or cavitary, have thick walls and be seen to expand. On MRI, fluid levels can be demonstrated. Occasionally, they can be multiple or co-exist with significant unrelated pathology. Conclusion: Bronchogenic cysts have a wide range of imaging appearances and familiarization with these appearances is essential for appropriate inclusion of the diagnosis within a list of differential diagnoses.",

Goddard; Bristol/UK Learning Objectives: To illustrate the radiological appearances of various mediastinal cystic lesions using various imaging modalities. Background: Cysts of the mediastinum constitute a small but important diagnostic group, representing 12 to 18% of all primary mediastinal tumors. Mediastinal cysts can be classified based on their aetiology, and include bronchogenic, oesophageal duplication cysts of foregut origin, mesothelial derived pericardial and pleural cysts, cystic thymic lesions, and other miscellaneous cysts. Neuroenteric cysts may develop by abnormal septation of the embryogenic germ cell layer, which closely associate with the vertebral column. In addition, mesothelial cysts, including pericardial and pleural cysts, and thymic cysts also occur in the mediastinum, as well as other rare cysts. Imaging Findings: Characteristic location and internal architecture of different mediastinal cystic lesions are used to aid the clinician in formulating a diagnostic plan. Plain chest radiographs can identify mediastinal cysts in a large proportion of cases. CT usually reveals well-circumscribed rounded masses of water density or a little higher and is useful in delineating the size, shape, and extent of the mediastinal masses. Characteristic fluid signal on MRI performed in selected patients differentiates the benign cystic lesion from solid mediastinal masses. MRI has therefore succeeded in providing valuable pre-operative specific diagnostic confirmation in regard to mediastinal cysts in selected cases.",

Despite prophylactic therapy, patients remain at particularly high risk for bacterial, viral and fungal infection in the post-procedure time period. Infectious complications are diagnosed and monitored using plain radiography, ultrasound, CT, MRI, image-guided biopsy and less often, nuclear medicine. Other commonly encountered complications requiring radiological investigation include hepatobiliary complications, veno-occlusive complications and graft-versus-host disease. Imaging Findings: This educational exhibit demonstrates the radiological appearances of the spectrum of common and unusual complications encountered by patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation, as depicted using a wide variety of imaging modalities.

Sanchez Nistal; Madrid/ES Learning Objectives: To identify and describe the imaging findings on air-space pattern in lung metastasis. Background: Lepidic pattern growth in lung metastasis is an uncommon manifestation of disseminated malignancies, mainly described in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. On CT, differentiation from other lung diseases as multifocal pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and brochioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) may be difficult, and diagnosis of BAC cannot be made with confidence if a primitive extrapulmonay adenocarcinoma has not been ruled out. Imaging Findings: We reviewed X-ray films and CT studies of 8 patients with proven air-space pattern lung metastasis. Metastasis was classified as air-space disease when it showed one or more of the following CT findings: Air-space nodules, including cavitating and pseudocavitating nodules; parenchymal consolidation containing air bronchogram and focal or diffuse ground-glass opacities. The primary tumors were colorectal adenocarcinoma in 5 patients; pancreatic adenocarcinoma in 1; adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater in 1 and infiltrating duct breast carcinoma in 1. In 1 patient the diagnosis of pulmonary disease preceded the discovery of primary malignancy and was synchronous in 2 other patients. Cavitating nodules were seen in 5 patients; parenchymal consolidation in 3; ground-glass opacities were seen in 3; pseudocavitated nodules in other 3 patients; solid nodules in 3; nodules with air bronchogram in two; mass with air bronchogram in 2 and lymphangitic carcinomatosis in 1 patient. Conclusions: Air-space pattern is an uncommon manifestation of lung metastasis. Differentiation from BOOP, multifocal pneumonia and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma can be difficult because this can be the onset of the disease.",

Conclusion: A standardized MSCT examination protocol represents the preferred screening method in the evaluation of patients who have sustained chest trauma. Purpose:To find out important CT findings for the prediction of prognosis of thymoma with a survival analysis. Materials and Methods: 45 patients with thymoma, who underwent surgical resection, were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical data were collected from chart review. Preoperative plain and contrast enhanced CT was performed in all patients. Two independent chest radiologists evaluated CT images paying special attention to diameter, contour, shape, cystic or necrotic portion, calcification, mediastinal fat obliteration, invasion of adjacent mediastinal structure, thickening of adjacent pleura, infiltration of adjacent lung, infiltration of adjacent chest wall, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, enhancement pattern, and degree of enhancement. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated. Influence on survival for each CT finding was analyzed by logrank test. Results: Cystic or necrotic portion, calcification, mediastinal fat obliteration, invasion of adjacent mediastinal structure, thickening of adjacent pleura, infiltration of adjacent lung, infiltration of adjacent chest wall, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, homogeneous enhancement pattern and high degree of enhancement were seen in 40%, 43%, 71%, 39%, 12%, 6%, 10%, 6%, 6%, 2%, 70% and 56% of patients respectively. The CT finding that were most predictive of survival was calcification (logrank test: p = 0.001). Cystic or necrotic portion (p = 0.01), infiltration of adjacent chest wall (p = 0.001), and pleural effusion (p = 0.003) were independent predictors of long-term survival. There were no differences in survival for the other findings. Conclusion: Calcification, cystic or necrotic portion, infiltration of adjacent chest wall, or pleural effusion on CT suggest poor prognosis of thymoma.",

To illustrate the causes of low attenuation splenic lesions. 2. To discuss clinical and imaging features which aid diagnosis in patients with known or suspected malignancy. Background: Abnormalities of the spleen are commonly encountered during CT of the thorax and abdomen in patients with suspected thoracic disease, posing diagnostic difficulty particularly in patients with otherwise operable malignancy. We present a pictorial review of low attenuation splenic lesions in patients with suspected thoracic disease. The most common causes are benign (including pseudocysts caused by trauma, infection or infarction), infections (mycobacterial, fungal, hydatid), sarcoidosis, haemangiomata, and lymphangiomatosis. Malignant causes include lymphoma and metastases (lung, breast, melanoma, stomach, liver, colon). In patients with known malignancy, splenic metastases are rare in the absence of widespread metastatic disease. Although the morphological pattern on CT may suggest malignancy (multiplicity of lesions, irregular margins, enhancement and splenomegaly), other imaging studies may be complementary. On ultrasound focal anechoic lesions are typical of benign cysts while multifocal or diffuse solid lesions are suggestive of malignancy. On MRI heterogeneous lesion signal is suggestive of malignancy. In cases where morphological imaging is non-specific, FDG-PET may play an important role. The accuracy of splenic biopsy in indeterminate lesions approaches 90% but significant complications occur in 10.3%. Conclusion: Isolated low attenuation splenic lesions must not be considered synonymous with metastases even in patients with known cancer. Awareness of the differential diagnosis and further imaging permit accurate diagnosis and management.",

The submission process makes full use of the Internet. The reviewers, who are expert radiologists, carefully review the submitted cases. When the reviewed case is sent back to the submitter with the reviewers' comments, the submitter should correct their text and images according to the reviewers' comments in order to obtain the reviewers' approval. The computer assists these processes automatically, and it enables submitters and reviewers to do collaborative work in registering cases without temporal or spatial restriction. Finally, approved cases can be registered to our library. Results: Up to August 2003, our radiology-teaching library has collected 1264 imaging cases in all subspecialties. In these cases, 616 cases have been registered. In August 2002, the board examination of radiologists in Japan has been performed with selected cases from this library in all subspecialties. Conclusion: Our library is readily available to radiologists who do not have much computer knowledge. Our web-based radiology-teaching library will be useful for the education of all radiologists.",

Eye level evaluation of films was not possible with fixed monitor height. Crowded workstations and alternators were observed. Based on the findings, adjustable workstations with articulating keyboards, mousing surfaces with gel wrist rests, flat screen liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors, and multi-adjustable posture support chairs were evaluated. Placement of view boxes and ambient lighting issues were addressed. Adjustable height workstations for small group consultation and conferencing will be strategically located.

To support the informed consent of the patient using four-dimensional display. To describe the technical procedure of CT scanning for blood flow analysis. Background: Aortic aneurysms or dissecting aneurysms are serious and lifethreatening conditions that requires early diagnosis and prompt surgical treatment. It is difficult to directly measure the blood flow and pressure without invasive examination. Computer simulation is one of the solutions for non-invasive diagnosis, or for comparison of pre-and post-operative measurement of the blood flow and pressure. In this exhibit we will describe the application of CFD based on four-dimensional vessel reconstructions from multi-slice CT data. Procedure Details: The volume data (0.5-2 mm slice thickness) was acquired from half-second multi-slice CT (Aquilion, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan). Segmented vessels were converted surface display by Marchine Cubes Method. Input parameters of blood were applied as an ideal incompressible fluid. Steady and transient analysis of CFD was performed using commercially available software (AcuSolve, ACUSIM Software, Mountain View, CA) by a finite element method.",

Vidal; Valencia/ES Purpose: To provide distributed decision support services in soft tissue tumor (STT) to assist the radiologist. Previous studies have shown the capability of pattern recognition techniques to classify between benign/malignant character and different histological groups. Methods and Materials: Radiologist access to the STT distributed decision support services is achieved using a graphical interface, with four windows that offers the main system functionalities areas: 1. Access to local or distributed STT registers that contain the features to study. New data can be imported from Microsoft Access formatted files or other databases. 2. Statistical analysis that provides the graphical representation and reports of statistical and evaluation information like probability distributions per class, correlation studies, ROC curves. 3. Graphical representation of STT registers provides graphical representation of STT features from the protocol, using PCA-transformation, or feature selection. 4. Automatic classification access to STT classifiers distributed web-services, developed with pattern recognition technology. Results: A location independent and multi-platform system has been developed to provided decision support services for radiologists dealing with STT diagnosis. The system architecture considers the access from hospitals using local or distributed data and connections to clinical decision support servers. The nodes maintenance and upgrade are automatically controlled by the architecture. Conclusion: This system helps radiologists with novel and powerful methods in STT diagnosis and characterization. It provides access to distributed data, statistical analysis, graphical representation and pattern recognition classification. GRID technology will incorporate more facility, security and powered communications to the STT distributed decision support services.",

The system enabled direct retrieval of DICOM images from the PACS, and allowed to use interactive telediagnosis tools for image visualization and processing. Results: During the teleradiology session, DICOM images archived at the PACS were readily accessed without any loss of information. A number of functionalities of visualization software were utilized and tested, combined with real-time videoconference session. The system was proven robust, efficient and providing for high performance. Conclusion: The broadband telemedicine system under study has given us a useful insight about the potential of applying broadband technology in healthcare, especially the performance of videoconferences with telediagnosis of radiological images.

Methods and Materials: Sixty normal mammographic images of dense breasts were selected from the DDSM database. Simulated radiopaque lesions of known image characteristics, such as low contrast (0.8%-5%) and unsharp contour (0%-80%), were generated and superimposed in dense breast areas. This resulted in a case sample that is difficult to achieve and verify with real lesions. All images with simulated lesions were processed by the wavelet-based method. Evaluation was carried out by an observer performance comparative study between the wavelet-processed images and original ones. The sample was presented to three experienced radiologists, classifying each simulated lesion with respect to contour type, using a five-point rating scale. A binormal ROC curve was individually fitted to the scores of each observer with a maximum-likelihood procedure and the area under the ROC curve (A z ) as well as the 95% confidence interval were calculated, for each technique.",

Methods and Materials: Using the MDCT scanner SOMATOM Sensation16 (Siemens, Germany), CT-images of a phantom were performed, with diferent combinations of slice-thickness (0.75, 1, 2, 3, 5 mm), pitch (0.5, 1, 1.5), slice-collimation (16 x 0.75 and 16 x 1.5) and reconstruction increment (50% and 100%). The phantom consists of simulated round lesions of different size (diameter between 1 and 10 mm) placed into a thin-walled plastic tube of 6-cm diameter. Quantitative analysis was assessed by evaluation of changes in size and shape of the lesions and calculation of sensitivities. Qualitative analysis was perfomed by evaluation of lesion's blurring of stairstep artifacts and rippling artifacts. Results: Overall sensitivity was 100% with slice thickness 0.75, 1 and 2 mm and not dependent on pitch. The smallest lesions (diameter 1 mm) were not detected with slice-thickness of 3 and 5 mm. Image quality of endoluminal images was graded as optimal for slice-thickness 0.75 mm and 1 mm. There was no statistical significant difference in quality using a different pitch in these images. However mild rippling artifacts were documented together with an increase in pitch value. Conclusion: Slice-collimation and slice-thickness are the most important parameters in selection of on optimal scan-protocol for VE: slice-collimation of 16 x 0.75 and slice-thickness of 1 mm seem to be optimal. Pitch and increment are less important, although values of 1 and 50% seem to be optimal. Selection of optimal parameters is also depended on lesion size.",

To educate radiologists about new MR liver specific contrast agents and MR imaging techniques. To demonstrate the value of the combined use of liver specific and non liver specific contrast agents as a problem solving tool. Background: Liver specific contrast agents used in combination with non-specific gadolinium chelates may serve as a problem solving tool in the diagnosis of focal liver lesions. Hepatic focal lesions with atypical imaging appearances usually need further assessment, namely biopsy, particularly in patients with history of malignant disease. Liver specific contrast agents offer new opportunities for liver imaging and provide information about the functional and morphological features of focal liver lesion. Currently a variety of contrast agents, subdivided in different categories are available for clinical use in MRI of the liver.

Understand when these agents could be used to improve diagnostic images and cost effectiveness. An appreciation of the clincial appearances of \"Doppler rescue\" in different areas of vascular imaging. Background: Ultrasound (US) assessment of the vascular system remains an accurate imaging modality despite the advancement of Magnetic Resonance Angiography. US allows real-time, multi-planar and safe assessment of the vasculature which is convenient to both operator and patient. Limitations of US, es-pecially in the vascular system are well documented. Full diagnostic Doppler assessment is not always possible for a variety of reasons. Color Doppler assessment greatly improves vascular imaging and recent technical advances have further improved the capabilities of Doppler US. A further important development is the introduction of microbubble contrast, which allows previously non-diagnostic studies to become interpretable and avoids further imaging: termed \"Doppler rescue\". Image Findings: The use of microbubble contrast will be illustrated in the cerebral circulation using trans-cranial US, the extra-cranial carotid system, the liver vasculature, renal artery and the peripheral arterial system.

Diagnostic demands require different examination techniques including unenhanced and several contrast enhanced scans for musculoskeletal, angiographic and parenchymal diagnosis. 16-channel MDR-CT overcomes previous technical limitations, which used to require thickening of slices or segmenting for whole body coverage. We therefore developed a multi-phase contrast protocol allowing acquisition of musculoskeletal, angiographic and parenchymal organ information in a single scan. CT technique and contrast protocol, advantages and limitations of this procedure are described and illustrated. Procedure Details: 12 consecutive trauma patients were examined on a 16channel MDR-CT (Philips, Mx8000IDT). After exclusion of cerebral hemorrhage application of iodine contrast media (400 mg iodine/ml, Imeron 400, Altana, Germany) was started with a bolus of 40 mL at a flow of 2.0 mL/sec, followed by a pause of 40 sec. Subsequently, a second 60 mL contrast bolus (3.5 mL/sec) is followed by a saline chaser. The CT-scan is initiated with a delay of 85 sec using a collimation of 16 x 1.5 mm, slice thickness of 2 mm and an increment of 1 mm. Results: This protocol provides excellent diagnostic image quality covering all issues of trauma work-up. Within a table time of less then 10 minutes all relevant pathologies were assessed as proved by further clinical follow-up. All fractures including two petrosal ones were detected. Parenchymal pathology included lacerations of liver, spleen, and kidneys. All arterial and venous hemorrhages were diagnosed without the need of additional diagnostic work-up.",

Background: Introduction of multi-slice spiral CT permitted greater flexibility in abdominal examinations. However single slice spiral CT still remains a powerful tool in routine imaging practice. Procedure Details: The aim of this exhibit is to describe lesion or organ behaviour before and/or after contrast material initiation in order to help the participant to understand why, when and how these agents should be administrated for optimal abdominal single slice spiral CT evaluation. Contrast volume, flow rate and scan delay before initiation, are discussed. The influence of patient weight and circulatory parameters such as cardiac output and inflow obstructions on contrast enhancement will be also analysed. Special techniques in order to achieve optimum GI opacification will be also discussed. Purpose: To compare hepatic signal intensity change using superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced MR imaging with scintigraphy using Technetium-99mgalactosyl human serum albmin (99mTc-GSA) and a visual grading score, in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Methods and Materials: Forty-six patients with hepatic dysfunction who underwent SPIO-enhanced MR imaging and scintigraphy with 99mTc-GSA were examined prospectively. In terms of clinical cirrhosis severity, 46 patients were classified into four group; 16 patients were classified as non-cirrhotic, 18 were classified as group A, 10 as group B, and 2 as group C (Child-Pugh classification). On MR imaging, T2-fast field echo (T2-FFE) images were obtained before and after the administration of SPIO. To assess the effect of SPIO, post contrast relative reduction in signal-to noise ratio (reduction-SNR) was calculated. The findings of 99mTc-GSA-scintigraphy were classified into 5 types according to visual grading score. The clinical cirrhosis severity, reduction-SNR, and visual grading score were analyzed with nonparametric methods.",

Although there are theories on the design of optimal paramagnetic centers, actual relaxivities are still below expectations. Methods and Materials: Measurements of relaxivites s -1 mM -1 ) to establish nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion profiles of existing and possible future contrast agents were performed on two field cycling relaxometers and on a 4.7 T MR research machine. Results: At high field, r 1 and r 2 of small Gadolinium complexes are low and decrease; high-field relaxivities can be increased through reduction of molecular motion. To some extent, it is possible to increase the r 2 of small Dysprosium complexes. NMRD profiles of superparamagnetic particles reveal a high r 2 /r 1 ratio at ultra-high fields. However, one particle of 5nm contains around 2,500 iron ions, whereas one macromolecular complex contains one or a few gadolinium ions.

This fact will be of paramount importance in the context of molecular imaging. They will act as negative agents. Results: The contrast ratios of rat abdominal aorta and portal vein on the first to fifth contrast imaging were higher for NMS60 than those for Gd-DTPA with every injection doses. The peak contrast ratios of aorta and portal vein for NMS60 were 1.4-1.7 and 1.7-2.2 times as high as those for Gd-DTPA. The renal excretion of NMS60 was as fast as Gd-DTPA. Conclusion: NMS60 showed stronger contrast enhancement for the rat vascular system, especially the portal vein and provided MR angiograms of higher image quality when compared with Gd-DTPA at the same injection dose. 3D-FSPGR imaging was performed before and after 5, 15, 30, 60, 120 min.

Methods: Four groups of 10 PET/CT-referrals (370 MBq FDG at 90 min pi) each were investigated with/-out iodinated contrast (300 mg/mL) application: (A) without, (B) multi-phase 90/50 mL (3/1.5 mL -1 ) cranio-caudally with 30 s delay, (C) 90/40/40 mL (3/2/1.5 mLs -1 ) cranio-caudally with 50 s delay, and (D) 80/60 mL (3/1.5 mLs -1 ) caudo-cranially with 50 s delay.

Materials and Methods: 36 hepatic metastases in 17 selected patients were included in our study. All lesions were studied with CE-US using real-time, continuous scanning with Esaote Esatune equipment with the CnTI software, enabling non-destructive imaging at low MI, following intravenous bolus administration of 2.4 mL of a second-generation agent (Sonovue-Bracco). The enhancement patterns of lesions were assessed during the arterial, portal and late phases. The examination was conducted pre-ablation, 24 hours, 1 month and 3 months after thermoablation. Purpose: An up-to-date study showed that for high-risk patients the nonionic, dimeric radiographic contrast medium (RCM) iodixanol had less nephrotoxicity than the nonionic, monomeric RCM. The lower incidence of secondary effects is often attributed to the lower osmolality of the dimeric RCM.

Results: Expressed in terms of concentration of iodine in the buffer as well as in terms of concentration of the RCM-molecule in the buffer, iotrolan induced a significantly lower relaxation than the monomeric RCM (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two monomeric RCMs iohexol-300 and iomeprol-300 (p > 0.05). The iso-osmolal formulation iotrolan-300 induced a smaller relaxation than the iso-osmolal formulation of iomeprol-150 (p < 0.05). Precontracted segments were strongly relaxed by all the RCMs as compared to mannitol (p < 0.05). Iotrolan had no significant effect on the basal tone of the vessel whereas iohexol and iomeprol induced a small relaxation effect. Conclusion: Independently of its osmolality and dilution effect, dimeric iotrolan causes less relaxation of isolated, precontracted segments of porcine renal arteries than monomeric iohexol and iomeprol.

Methods and Materials: Urine samples were taken before, three hours, and six hours after intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA, Gd-DTPA, and Gd-DOTA at 0.1 mmol/kg to each of five patients who underwent contrast-enhanced MR imaging. Five patients who had non-contrast MR imaging were evaluated as controls. Urine was assayed for quantitative analysis of zinc and copper using atomic absorption analysis. Results: Gd-DTPA-BMA caused the highest increase in zinc excretion among the three agents, 1795 \u00b1 1273 \u00b5g at 3 hours and 985 \u00b1 434 \u00b5g at 3 to 6 hours.

All of them were studied with the same CT helical protocol. Patients were randomly distributed into three groups: A) monophasic (120 mL at 2.5 mL/s); B) low-high biphasic (120 mL, the first 60 mL at a rate of 2 mL/s and the other 60 at 2.5 mL/s); and C) high-low biphasic (120 mL, the first 60 mL at a rate of 2.5 mL/s and the other 60 at 2 mL/s). All the patients were injected, through an antebrachial route, with 300 mg I/ml non-ionic contrast media. All CT scans were obtained at the portal phase with a fixed delay time of 55 seconds. Contrast enhancement was evaluated by attenuation coefficients measurements at liver, inferior cava and portal veins, renal cortex, superior aorta and aortic bifurcation. Results: The biphasic protocols obtained statistically higher enhancement at the aortic bifurcation (Anova, p = 0.003). However, there was no other statistically significant difference (Anova, p > 0.05) among the three protocols at the different levels. Although non-significative, enhancements following monophasic protocol were always higher than those obtained with biphasic protocols, with the exception of aortic bifurcation. Conclusion: Monophasic injection of contrast agents on helical CT of the upper abdomen gives higher enhancement of parenchymal and venous structures. No significant difference was observed between low-high and high-low biphasic protocols. Quantitative analysis showed a statistically significant difference between SI of myometrium on plain and Sinerem-enhanced MR images assessed by means of t-test. C/N between lesion and normal myometrium significantly increased following Sinerem administration. In four patients Sinerem-enhanced images provided additional information leading to more accurate T staging. Conclusions: Intravenous injection of Sinerem provides a significant decrease of SI of normal myometrium with higher C/N between neoplastic lesion and normal myometrium. Sinerem-enhanced MRI provides better evaluation of myometrial neoplastic invasion increasing the conspicuity of neoplastic lesions in patients with endometrial and cervical carcinoma. Further studies are necessary in order to realize the physiologic mechanism of myometrial uptake of Sinerem. Purpose: Verification of radiological methods with histology has always been difficult due to poor correlation of slice thickness, orientation and confinement to two dimensions. A method for a quantitative three-dimensional reslicing of histological sections is introduced (Patent pending EPA03008877.7) permitting exact matching of slice geometry.

Endometritis, the most common cause of fever in the postpartum period, complicates 2-3% of vaginal deliveries and up to 85% of cesarean sections. Post partum hemorrhage is most often caused by uterine atony and retained products of conception, and complicates 1-2% of vaginal deliveries. Imaging Findings: In early puerperium, uterus is most often retroverted and empty with fluid and debris in the cervical area. Intrauterine cavity increases on days 7-14 post partum with fluid and debris in the whole cavity and it may be normal to see an intracavitary echogenic mass. AP diameter of the uterus diminishes progressively in 6-8 weeks. Endometrial gas is occasionaly visualized after normal vaginal delivery in the immediate puerperium and disappears within 1-2 weeks. It can be difficult to differentiate from endometritis, which can progress to pelvic inflamatory disease. Endometrial stripe decreases during puerperium; if it remains thickened, complications such as retained products of conception or hypotonic uterus may be suspected. Doppler US can be useful for differentiating between them. We describe these features with ultrasound and CT. Conclusion: It is important to recognize normal postpartum uteral findings in order to differentiate them from pathological conditions.",

Background: We retrospectively analysed 26 MR exams performed before and after surgical treatment and 20 MR exams without and with intra vaginal device of 23 patients with pelvic floor dysfunction: Urinary incontinence (Tension-free vaginal tape n = 3, artificial urinary sphincter n = 4, intra vaginal device n = 10) and pelvic prolapse (intra vaginal device n = 2, promontofixation n = 2, prosthetic B D E F A G plaques Permacol and Polypropyl\u00e8ne in recto-vaginal and uretro-vaginal wall n = 2).

Takeuchi Background: The endometrial cavity may demonstrate a spectrum of imaging manifestations ranging from normal, to that of a reactive, inflammatory, and benign and malignant neoplastic cause. Imaging Findings: Thickened endometrium or endometrial mass included benign endometrial hyperplasia or polyps, endometrial carcinomas or carcinosarcomas, and gestational trophoblastic diseases. Hyperintensity similar to the endometrium suggested rather benign hyperplastic lesions. Hyperplasia or polyps associated with adjuvant tamoxifen therapy tended to be large masses with cystic changes and prominent stromal proliferation. Myometrial thinning suggested malignancy but was occasionally overestimated because of the fragility of the myometrium with adenomyosis. Submucosal leiomyoma with edematous change may mimic endometrial mass, and demonstration of the continuity to the myometrium was the clue to its myometrial origin. Uterine sarcomas may involve endometrial cavity, and endometrial stromal sarcomas often showed endometrial masses with characteristic myometrial invasion. Adenomyomatous endometrial polyp may simulate endometrial stromal sarcoma due to arborescent smooth muscle components which resemble the preserved bundles of myometrium within the tumor on T2-weighted images. Fluid collection in the cavity was well visualized on MRI to distinguish between hydro-, pyo-, and hematometra. Conclusion: To recognize various imaging findings of the uterine endometrial cavity; it is important to make a correct preoperative diagnosis to avoid unnecessary or excessive surgical intervention and to preserve the fertility of the patients. Learning Objectives: To demonstrate wide variations of the fluid collection in the female pelvis with pathophysiologic correlation and evaluate the diagnostic clues to the differential diagnosis. Background: There are various situations with fluid collection in the female pelvis. Although physiologic ascites is often observed in the reproductive era, other pathophysiologic fluid collection with both benign and malignant conditions may occur. Imaging Findings: Mucinous ascites with organ scalloping in pseudomyxoma peritonei is characteristic. Hemorrhagic ascites, which shows high attenuation on computed tomography (CT) and is well visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be observed with malignant tumors, adnexal torsion or ruptured endometriosis. Lactate detection on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may suggest its malignant condition. Non-neoplastic diseases such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, pelvic inflammatory diseases, endometriosis, adnexal torsion and massive ovarian edema may cause accompanying fluid collection with adnexal enlargement. Benign tumors may cause ascites, such as Meigs' and pseudo-Meigs' syndrome, and malignant tumors may cause carcinomatous peritonitis with fluid collection. Ascites in postmenopausal woman is an unnatural finding and may suggest adhesion due to old inflammation or surgical procedure, or existence of hidden neoplastic disease. Ascites in a tumor-bearing woman may suggest an advanced stage of disease with occult tumor implants. Localized fluid collection like peritoneal retention cyst is observed in adhesive pelvis after surgery, inflammation or endometriosis with characteristic contour shape. Conclusion: To evaluate the nature or biochemical components of ascitic fluid by MRI and MRS may be helpful for the differential diagnosis.",

Lee; Seoul/KR Learning Objectives: To illustrate the spectrum of imaging findings of the recurrent ovarian cancer. Background: Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of death among the gynecological malignancies. The treatment of ovarian cancer has traditionally been initial surgical staging and cytoreduction, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Then, a second look operation is performed to reassess the tumor status after first line chemotherapy. Once pathological complete response is defined, the management of ovarian cancer depends on non-invasive methods such as serology and cross sectional imaging. On the follow-up evaluation, identifying patients with minimal recurrent disease is important as it provides the best chance for complete clinical response and long-term survival following second-line chemotherapy. Imaging Findings: Recurrent ovarian cancer usually manifests as local recurrence, peritoneal seeding and nodal recurrence. Vaginal stump recurrence is the most common manifestation of the local recurrence. Peritoneal seeding presents as ascites, peritoneal enhancement, peritoneal nodularity, and/or mesenteric infiltration on cross sectional imaging. Nodal recurrence is most commonly seen in the external iliac group, which is not the presumed site based upon anatomic studies. Although hematogenous dissemination is less frequently seen in the recurrent ovarian cancer, hepatic or pleuropulmonary involvement is a relatively common manifestation of hematogenous spread. The unusual manifestations of hematogenous dissemination include metastases in the extrahepatic abdominal solid organs, bone, central nervous system, and abdominal wall involving subcutaneous fat or muscle. Conclusion: Familiarity with the patterns and spectrum of imaging findings of recurrent ovarian cancer will facilitate accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment. ",

Accurate staging of cervical carcinoma at presentation is essential from the point of view of prognosis and also for management planning, as patients who present with stage IIa or lower grade carcinoma proceed to surgery, and those with higher grade tumours are treated primarily with radiotherapy. Recurrent disease is also best depicted using MRI. Patients can present with or develop a wide variety of complications as a result of their tumour and MRI can be of particular advantage in the investigation of local complications. Imaging Findings: This educational exhibit illustrates the MR imaging findings of cervical carcinoma of all grades. We also demonstrate the MR imaging features of a wide variety of local and distant complications, including local invasion, fistula formation, small bowel obstruction and obstructive hydronephrosis. Conclusion: MRI is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis and staging of primary cervical carcinoma. It is also of benefit for the investigation of disease related complications and for the investigation of recurrent disease. The most common is serous papillary carcinoma. These tumors can show totally solid appearance, but mainly solid mass with some cystic portions is more common. They have unique imaging findings especially on MR in that papillary masses with branching pattern are frequently accompanied by peritoneal seeding masses. Serous surface papillary carcinoma of the ovary, a distinct subtype of these tumors, is mainly located on the surface of the ovary. Sometimes normal ovaries can be found inside papillary masses on MR, which is a very unique and striking appearance. Brenner tumor and endometrioid carcinoma are another subtypes of epithelial tumors that can show solid appearance. Extensive calcifications can be found in some solid Brenner tumors. Endometrioid carcinomas are sometimes accompanied by endometrial pathologies including endometrial carcinoma. Conclusion: Knowing these characteristics can help make correct diagnosis on CT and MR, especially differential diagnosis with metastatic tumors.",

To discuss differential diagnosis of uterine leiomyomas from gynecologic and non-gynecologic disorder. Background: Leiomyomas are the most common uterine neoplasm and are composed of smooth muscle with varying amounts of fibrous connective tissue. Imaging features of uterine leiomyomas vary depending on tumor size, location, degeneration and other histologic findings, and specific types of unusual leiomyomas. Uterine leiomyomas are classified as submucosal, intramural or subserosal. The common types of degeneration are hyaline (> 60% of cases), cystic, myxoid, red and hemorrhage. Degenerated leiomyomas have variable appearances on T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced images. Specific types of unusual leiomyomas include lipoleiomyoma and myxoid leiomyoma, which have characteristic MR findings enough to differentiate from other gynecologic and nongynecologic disease.

Liddicoat; Leicestershire/UK Learning Objectives: Review of imaging features in women with endometriosis since introduction of a 1.5 T Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner. Women were referred when they did not wish to undergo laparoscopy or where surgical intervention and visualisation was difficult. Background: Endometriosis affects women during the reproductive years between 25 and 29, with an estimated prevalence of 5-10%. Presentation range from pain (symptoms and severity do not correlate) to asymptomatic (diagnosed during infertility investigations). Endometriosis (functional glands and stroma outside normal endometrium) is characterised by deposits, endometriomas (cysts) and adhesions, commonly ovarian but is documented to involve any site within the peritoneum and extraperitoneum. MR is noninvasive with high sensitivity and specificity, small foci appearing hyperintense on T1 and variable signal on T2 weighted images. Endometriomas (> 1 cm) appear hyperintense on T1 and hypointensity on T2, with hyperintense foci on T2 dependant on age of haemorrhage. Fat saturation sequences are essential to improve lesion conspicuity on T1. We reviewed all women referred for investigation of suspected endometriosis, and for evaluation of disease extent and sites (notably recto-vaginal pouch) in known cases of endometriosis. Procedure Details: Sequences used were axial T1, sagittal T2, axial oblique fat saturation (tirm) and narrow section coronal T2 imaging. MR identified endometriosis involving ovaries, bilateral thick walled and unilateral endometriotic cysts, extra-ovarian disease within peritoneum and soft tissue. Fibroids and simple ovarian cysts were common, with evidence of concurrent endometriosis. Conclusion: MR detected small foci of endometriosis outside of the ovaries. There was a high incidence of other gynaecological pathologies allowing early review and treatment.",

Zubarev; Moscow/RU Purpose: To determine the possibilities of 3D transvaginal (TV) sonography in preoperative assessment of uterine leiomyomas and to correlate the findings with hysteroscopic, laparoscopic and macroscopic data. Method and Materials: 31 women with symptomatic uterine leiomyomas were evaluated before myomectomy and hysterectomy. Multiplanar images of the uterus were created in 3D TVS. Preoperative location of the leiomyomas, and interactions with uterine cavity, cervix and iliac vessels were assessed in each case. US results were compared with hysteroscopy in 6 pts, laparoscopy in 7, open surgery in 5 and pathomorphology data in 13 pts. Results: Surgical management was changed after 3D TVS examination in 8 cases. 3D coronal images allowed better location of the submucous and centripetal leiomyomas especially in multiple closely lying fibromyomas. 3D TVS results correlated with hysteroscopy in 91% (10/11) of cases vs. 64% (7/11). 3D Power Doppler TVS provided precise evaluation of the pedunculated submucous and subserous leiomyomas thus enabling adequate myomectomy. In comparison to macroscopic data of the uterus, 3D TVS were superior to 2D TVS in differentiation of the type of leiomyomas in 92% vs. 69% of cases, and in assessment of the interactions with the cervix in 100% vs. 62%. Multiplanar reconstruction of the coronal planes on 3D TVS improved determination of the uterine cavity interactions with large subserous-interstitial leiomyomas before laparoscopic myomectomy. Conclusion: 3D TVS is a useful complement to 2D TVS in preoperative assessment of leiomyomas. Accurate evaluation of the leiomyomas on 3D MPR can decrease the possibilities of intraoperative hemorrhage and uterine trauma. B D E F A G",

Prassopoulos; Alexandroupolis/GR Purpose: To reevaluate the role of hysterosalpingography in the diagnosis of adhesions related to infertility and in patients managment. Materials and Method: 54 consecutive patients with more than two years infertility underwent hysterosalpingography (HSG), followed by laparoscopy. Patients with infertility related to uterine abnormality were not included. Diagnosis of peritubal adhesions was based on the presense of the following six imaging findings: Convoluted tubes, vertical tubes, loculation of contrast medium in peritoneum, halo effect, ampullary dilatation or fixed laterodeviation of the uterus. Results: In total, 92 tubes were delinated. No abnormality was detected in 7 tubes on both HSG and laparoscopy. Laparoscopy disclosed adhesions in 51 tubes. Diagnosis of adhesions was made in 46 tubes (18 correct, 28 false positive), when the presence of one abnormal sign on HSG was considered as criterion; and in 40, when two or more signs are present (33 correct, 7 false positive). Ten live births five to eight months after hysterosalpingography occured. Conclusions: Accurate diagnosis of adhesions on HSG requires the presence of at least two abnormal signs. The six-month interval between HSG and laparoscopy might be shortened when adhesive peritubal involvement is radiologically suspected. Laparoscopy is less indicated when no abnormality is detected on HSG.",

Background: Conventional excretory urography and conventional computed tomography (CT) were considered the standard techniques used to examine patients with urinary tract neoplasia. Multi-detector row CT offers high speed of acquisition and high resolution images, allowing axial and 3D urographic acquisitions. Imaging Findings: 15 pts with transitional cell carcinomas were analysed. All patients underwent unenhanced and post-contrast CT axial scans, followed by a urographic acquisition in the excretory phase (2 mm collimation, 1.5 mm reconstruction interval). 3D reconstructions of excretory phase images were created with on an independent workstation using a MIP algorithm. Neoplastic lesions were visualised as solid papillomas in 3/15 cases, as wall thickening of the collecting system in 11/15 cases and as solid tissue in the renal sinus in 1/15 case. Lesions were more evident on the source axial images of the excretory phase urographic acquisition. In the post-contrast images, the lesions resulted quite vascularized. Urinary tract dilation was evaluated in 13/15 patients. Dilation was better evaluated on the 3D MIP CT-urographic images in the case of normal renal excretory function and on the source axial images of urographic acquisition in the case of functionally excluded kidneys. Conclusion: CT-urographic axial and 3D images combined with conventional CT imaging allowed good evaluation of urinary tract neoplasia. The more frequent pattern was the wall thickening of the collecting system (74% cases), associated to urinary tract dilation (87% cases).",

Backgrounds: Due to advances in CT technology and its wide spread use for imaging a variety of abdominal conditions, small renal masses are being incidentally detected more frequently on CT. Since at least half of renal cell cancers are detected incidentally by imaging, the cost and time for further imaging of small renal masses may increase. In addition, some renal cell cancers may be cystic and it is important to have a strategy for dealing with cystic renal lesions that do not meet the CT criteria for simple cysts. Imaging Findings: We will discuss and show a variety of small incidental renal masses detected on unenhanced and single phase contrast-enhanced CT. Topics discussed will include the following: CT criteria for distinguishing lesions that do not need further imaging for characterization from lesions that require further imaging for characterization; technical considerations affecting imaging findings; updated Bosniak classification for cystic lesions; pitfalls in interpretation; and an algorithmic approach for \"indeterminate\" masses by using ultrasound, dedicated renal CT, MRI, or percutaneous biopsy.",

Balconi; Milan/IT Purpose: To determine safety and efficacy of laparoscopic cryoablation in the management of small renal cell carcinoma and to assess its medium term outcome. Methods and Materials: 27 patients underwent laparoscopic cryoablation of 29 tumors between July 2000 and June 2003. All treatments were delivered under laparoscopic US guidance. Patients were followed up clinically, biochemically and by MR imaging 24 hrs after surgery, and subsequently at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Results: 24 hrs after treatment all cryolesions were more than 1 cm larger than the original masses; cryolesions decreased in size by an average of 38% at 1 month, 46% at 3, 64% at 6 and 80% at 12 months following cryoablation. Early post-procedure MR images showed complete ischemia of all cryolesions. Follow-up (mean 16 months) revealed no evidence of recurrence in 24/27 patients. One patient showed local recurrence at 12 months, one patient demonstrated an metachronous nodule in the same kidney at 12 months and another patient showed a pancreatic metastatic nodule at 6 months. No significant rise in creatinine was noted post-procedurally. After surgery, retroperitoneal effusion was found in all cases; 6/29 cases showed an intralesional haematoma, 28/29 cases showed low signal intensity foci due to haemostatic material and 3/29 cases showed a perilesional haematoma at 1 and 3 month follow-up. Conclusions: Our medium term experience suggests that laparoscopic cryoablation is a safe, well tolerated and minimally invasive therapy for small renal cell carcinoma, and MR is an effective imaging technique in the follow-up of renal lesions treated with laparoscopic cryoablation. Results: Echographic findings postbiopsy were normal, or with loss of corticomedullary differentiation, enlargement and gross edema.

Han; Belgrade/YU Purpose: To analyze whether clearance of mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3), which is equal to its tubular extraction rate (TER) could serve as a sensitive parameter of renal function impairment. Methods and Materials: Investigation was carried out in 107 patients, who were divided into nine groups, according to the diagnosis and the degree of renal failure. Dynamic renal scintigtraphy was performed 20 minutes after i.v. injection of 150-220 MBq of MAG3. TER was determined by single-sample, volume distribution method using the standard solution of labeled MAG3. Results: Results of TER were correlated with blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr) and creatinine clearance (CCr). Significant linear correlation between TER and CCr was found (r = 0.76; p < 0.0001). Correlation between TER/ BUN and TER/Cr was exponential (r = -0.78 and r = -0.82, respectively; p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Analysis of our results show that TER is a more sensitive parameter than CCr, Cr and BUN, especially in mildly deteriorated function. In advanced renal failure, the sensitivity of TER is similar to the sensitivity of BUN and Cr.",

There were no significant side effects caused by the infusion of the anesthesic drug. However the infusion of the drug may cause a degradation of the TRUS image. Air bubbles are sometimes infused with the drug causing a \"fuzzy\" image, which results in a degree of difficulty in guiding the needle. A thorough TRUS examination of the prostate prior to the anesthesia helps the radiologist in planning the biopsies in advance and thus guiding the needle to the appropriate area, even through a \"fuzzy\" image. Conclusion: US-guided local anesthesia, before TRUS biopsy, is useful for assuring patient cooperation during this often painful procedure and essential if TRUS findings call for a large (more than 10) number of biopsies. Conclusion: Conventional MR images combined with pyelo-urographic techniques allowed a good evaluation of urinary tract neoplasia.

Background: Teaching gross human anatomy is traditionally based on demonstration and study of the different organs and systems directly on corpses. However, availability of specimens for this purpose can be difficult for a variety of problems and, at present, anatomical models made of plastic material and electronic files are used in most schools of medicine. These problems have been always present in the history of medicine. To overcome this, in 1771, a special laboratory was established at the \"Imperial Regio Museo di Fisica e Storia Naturale\" of Florence to create a collection of anatomical waxes, copied from anatomic dissections, to enable three-dimensional anatomic studies with schematic drawings and captions indicating anatomical details. Imaging Findings: From 1771 to 1893, the laboratory prepared a large number of models, and the collection in Florence consists of about 1500 pieces. In the collection there are over 200 preparations, showing the complete urogenital system in the male and the female. Special models have been created to demon-strate sectional anatomy, the internal structures of the kidney, the relationships of the prostate with the bladder base and the seminal vesicles, the penis, the vagina and the uterine cavity. Many waxes depict the gravid uterus and the foetus, with its vasculature and its relations with placental vessels. Conclusion: This allows the collection to be considered as the first 3D \"textbook\" of anatomy in medical history.",

Background: Urachal adenocarcinoma is an extremely rare malignant neoplasm that develops from embryonic remnants and has a variable clinical course. Clinical, pathologic and imaging findings were retrospectively evaluated for 6 patients with urachal adenocarcinoma referred from 4 centers. Imaging studies (CT, n = 6; MRI, n = 2) were reviewed for morphologic features, such as tumor size, homogeneity, margins and degree of enhancement. Imaging Findings: The mean tumor size was 3.5 cm. The tumors were heterogeneous in 4/6 patients, with irregular margins in 6/6, calcifications in 1/6 and strongly enhanced in 6/6. All tumors extended anteriorly from the bladder dome; endoscopy was normal in all cases. Enlarged lymph nodes were visible in 2/6 patients. Histologically proven invasion of the bladder dome was detected in 2/6 patients and invasion of the anterior abdominal wall in 1. 3D reconstructions in the sagittal plane (n = 2) evoked a urachal mass and assessed its relationship with the urinary bladder, umbilicus and rectus muscles.

In 3 children, stones were located in the urinary bladder, and in the urethra in another 2. All of them were male patients; we decided to use ESWL instead of invasive methods of treatment. ESWL procedures were performed under general anesthesia in 4 and under sedo-analgesia in 1 patient. During treatment, the patients were placed in the prone position (patients with bladder stones) or in a modified supine position (perineal approach for urethral stones). An average 3000 shock waves were applied per patient with a maximal energy of 3.0 kV. Average duration of treatment was 35 minutes. Results: Successful fragmentation was achieved during the first session in 4 patients. In 1 patient with a urethral stone, the fragmentation was not satisfactory and the treatment was repeated 7 days later. Complete elimination of stone fragments was achieved during the first 3 days in the patients with successful first treatment, but was not achieved at all in the patient with repeated treatment. Cystoscopy was performed and the stone was found within a urethral diverticulum. There were no complications in our patient group. Conclusion: ESWL in our experience seems to be useful as a non-invasive method in the treatment of stones with in unusual locations. It could be recommended in male patients without anatomical variations of bladder and urethra. Methods: This is a retrospective study of helical CT of 42 patients that showed iliopsoas abnormalities (11 neoplasms, 12 abscesses, 14 hematomas, 2 cases of atrophy and 3 of calcifications). The study group included 33 men and 9 women, 9-90 years old (mean 58 years). All studies were obtained over a 10-year period. Final diagnosis were correlated with different CT features to determine findings that could be used to differentiate these abnormalities. These included enlargement of the iliopsoas muscle, irregular margins and fat infiltration, attenuation of the lesion, calcification, bone fracture and associated adenopathy. Result: Psoas pathology is more frequent in men (p < 0.05). Low attenuation and heterogeneity are the most reliable CT features of iliopsoas abscesses (p < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of low attenuation for the diagnosis of abscesses are 24% and 92% respectively. The specificity of heterogeneity for the diagnosis of abscesses is 100%. Bone fracture is useful for the diagnosis of hematoma (p < 0.05). Bone fracture is 53% sensitive and 85% specific for diagnosis of hematoma. Conclusions: Low attenuation, heterogeneity and bone fracture are helical computed tomography features useful for differentiating iliopsoas pathology. Results: All masses were classified correctly by both analysis. The mean percentage of signal intensity on subtraction images were 200 \u00b1 63 (means \u00b1 SD) and nonadenomas 29 \u00b1 7 (means \u00b1 SD), respectively.

Results: There were cochlear aplasia with large vestibule (n = 1), cochlear hypoplasia (n = 1), Mondini malformation with large vestibular aqueducts (n = 1), Mondini dysplasia with large vestibule (n = 1), large vestibular aqueduct and endolymphatic sac (n = 5), small internal auditory canal (n = 1) and large vestibule (n = 1). Four cases were involved unilaterally. Seven cases had combined deformities. Five cases had cochlear implant. Conclusions: Both CT and MR can be used to look at inner ear malformations, but often both techniques are complementary. CT is preferred when associated middle or external ear malformations must be excluded. MRI is preferred when subtle changes in the membranous labyrinth or abnormalities of the nerves in the internal auditory canal must be visualized. Purpose: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is probably the most common cause of vertigo and the most common peripher vestibular disorder. BPPV has been postulated to be the result of freely floating debris of degenerative otoconia in the endolymph of a semicircular canal (SC), canalolithiasis or debris that becomes adherent to the cupula of the semicircular canal. The key in determining the diagnosis of BPPV is still examination performing positioning manovers and the use of Frenzel glasses. Differential diagnosis can be difficult. The aim of this study was therefore to provide a new diagnostic approach by 3D-NMR technique. Our special interest has been if there was a structural change in the SC or the cupula, which could be identified in patients with incurable vertigo compared to those with self-limited disease. Methods and Materials: We investigated 10 normal and 10 BPPV subjects using a 1.5 T GE MRI with 3 D data set: TR 4320, TE 238, 1 mm slices, 512 x 512 matrix, 22 x 22 FOV, 1.0 NEX. Results: All BPPV patients had pathological filling defect of the SC before therapy which must be considered as an anomaly canalolithiasis. We postulate there must be structural changes in its lumen which makes the endothelium adhesive which is recognizable in HR-3D-MR as a filling defect. Conclusion: A significant improvement in quality of high-resolution MRI of the inner ear using CISS could be obtained at 3.0 T despite potential drawbacks. To obtain at 1.5 T, the same SNR would require approximately double measuring time, optionally increasing the risk for an accidental head movement which may prove detrimental at high resolution. (2), dysplasia of the vestibule with or without abnormality of the lateral SCC (2), Mondini-deformation (2), cochlear dysplasia and absence of cochlear nerve (1) and dysplasia of the modiolus (1). One patient showed labyrinth hemorrhage at the time of MRI. Ten cases presented typical clinical features of a progressive hearing loss. In 6 patients a constantly moderate or profound sensorineural hearing loss was present since early childhood. One patient was deaf. One patient suffered from a Pendred syndrome. Conclusion: A large vestibular aqueduct is a common finding in patients with suspected inner ear malformation. Nevertheless, especially in isolated LVA, it is sometimes missed in routine work. Even if there is no therapy, an early diagnosis is needed to explain to the patient, the cause of hearing loss, the prognosis and behaviour which can possibly delay progression.",

Results: The differences between the results for granulomas and cysts were statistically significant. When the difference of densities exceeded 85.6, the lesion was a cyst and when it was below 45.9, a granuloma was diagnosed. Combined application of two criteria, namely the calculated difference between densities and the largest dimension, increased diagnostic possibilities of radiological differentiation of granulomas and radicular cysts.

Violaris 1 ; 1 Eastbourne/UK, 2 Brighton/UK Purpose: To evaluate the role of ultrasound-guided biopsy in the management of palpable parotid lesions. Materials and Methods: One hundred patients were included in this prospective study over a 5-year period. Initial ultrasound examination was performed using a 5-10 MHz high frequency transducer. Guided biopsies were taken under local anaesthesia (single operator) with a spring loaded variable throw (15 mm/22 mm) biopsy gun using 18 or 20 G needles with an average of 2 passes per patient. Results: In 100 patients, biopsy revealed 50 benign neoplasms, 24 malignant lesions (including 6 primary and 6 secondary lesions as well as 12 lymphomas) and 26 other pathologies including sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, reactive lymphadenopathy, Sjogren's and actinomycosis. Only 6 lymphoma patients needed surgery for further histological grading. Diagnostic accuracy was 100% for benign versus malignant pathology in the 54 patients who underwent subsequent surgery. There was 96% correlation between biopsy and operative histology with only two non-correlates. These involved misdiagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. These would have required further histochemical staining for differentiation. Surgery was avoided in forty-six patients after biopsy diagnosis. There were no immediate complications of biopsy. Conclusion: Ultrasound guided biopsy gives 100% benign versus malignant pathological differentiation. It also has 96% correlation with operative histology. Correct pre-operative diagnosis influences the decision to undertake conservative or radical surgery and unnecessary surgery can be avoided. A core of tissue allows histopathological analysis where assessment of tissue architecture, tumour grading and immunochemical staining is possible. This is invaluable for accurate diagnosis.",

The normal ear served as the control. Two radiologists evaluated contrast enhancement in the area of the cochlear aqueduct. Result: Forty-eight of 62 ears (77.4%) showed contrast enhancement of the cochlear aqueduct, but no significant differences in the frequency of contrast enhancement were observed between patients with and patients without vertigo, tinnitus, sensorineural hearing loss, cerebellopontine angle tumors or a highriding jugular bulb.

Patients and Methods: Five patients with basaliomas of the facial soft tissue were examined before surgery with high-resolution MRI using a 1.5 Tesla system with a 47 mm microscopy coil. Axial T1-and T2-weighted TSE images were obtained from all patients before Gd-DTPA application and additional axial and/ or sagittal T1-weighted sequences with and without fat suppression after CM application (FOV 60 mm, matrix 256 x 256, slice thickness 1.5 mm, acquisition time 5-7 minutes). Qualitative analysis of MR images was performed by two radiologists who measured the extension of the tumor and decided whether bone erosion or infiltration of the orbit or of the nasal cartilage was present. Results: T1-weighted unenhanced axial images proved to be the most useful sequences in predicting the extension of the basaliomas. For the evaluation of B D E F A G orbital invasion, additional sagittal T1-weighted unenhanced images were helpful. The extension of the lesions correlated well with the results on histology. In one case, however, nasal cartilage infiltration was not correctly diagnosed on the basis of high resolution MR.

Method and Materials: From March 1999 to September 2002, 32 patients underwent orbits MRI. Seventeen patients had unilateral SO muscle paresis: 13 congenital and 4 acquired. Fifteen patients had normal SO. The area of the superior oblique muscle in the section of maximun width was obtained in primary gaze position, supra and infraversion. Asymmetry of the superior oblique muscles was defined arbitrarily as the difference between both SO in the same patient and the measurement was compared with the values obtained in the normal group of patients. Results: Mean maximal difference was 14.2 \u00b1 3.3 mm 2 (p < 0.01) between the healthy and paretic eye. In the normal group of patients it was 4.3 \u00b1 1.6 mm 2 (p < 0.02).

Surgery and radiotherapy are main treatment modalities. We evaluated typical angiography findings of NA, its role in defining tumour blood supply and treatment planning. Material and Methods: Forty patients with JNA (38 males and 2 females aged 12 to 57) underwent angiography. We assessed tumour vascular composition, its location in relation to the maxillary artery (MA), feeding vessels and feasibility of preoperative embolization. Relationship between stage of tumour, presence of intracranial extension and internal carotid artery (ICA) blood supply were statistically evaluated. Results: On angiograms, all tumours presented intensive inhomogenous blush. 97.5% of tumours were supplied by MA, 15% by ascending pharyngeal and 7.5% by the facial artery. In 30% of tumours, feeding vessels originated from the ICA and in 1 (2.5%) case from the vertebral artery. The relationship between ICA blood supply and tumour stage was statistically significant. ICA blood supply had no correlation with the presence of tumour intracranial extension. Two patients with abundant ICA supply were disqualified from surgery and underwent irradiation. In 2 patients with previous external carotid atery ligation, preoperative embolization of vascular recurrent tumour was not feasible. In 33% of cases MA was displaced by tumour lateral extension. Conclusions: Angiography shows typical features of NA (nasopharyngeal, highly vascular tumour supplied by MA), confirms diagnosis of this tumour and enables preoperative embolization. Analysis of tumour blood supply is useful in determining best therapeutic approach. Angiography visualises displaced MA, which helps the surgeon identify and ligate it during tumour removal. ",

After capsular width was measured, ROC curve analysis was performed to establish the most accurate cut-off value to discriminate between joints with and without MR effusion. Results: Diagnostic accuracy of US to predict MR evidence of TMJ effusion was good (area under the ROC curve = 0.817).

Results: Fifty-three patients had operations (39 lobectomies, 7 thyreoidectomies including 2 with lympadenectomies and 7 thyroid resections). Six cancers, 26 adenomas, 15 colloid nodules, 14 goiters and 9 with thyroiditis were found. Demonstration of the nodules in three orthogonal planes by 3D USA and assessment of the nodule's character and vascularity helped to change surgical management in 8 cases; in 2 cases post puncture morphological diagnosis and in 9 cases operation was rejected. 3D USA was superior to conventional 2D in differential diagnosis of thyroid nodules. The preliminary decision to perform a lobectomy or a total thyroidectomy was based on variety of factors, many of which were delineated by detailed ultrasound examination. Preoperative evaluation of thyroid vascular anatomy and MPR of the nodules were of value for changing surgical management for thyroid resections and in rejecting the necessity of operation.

To describe the technique and problems related to SPECT/ PET/CT/US image fusion in the neck region and to demonstrate the clinical relevance of the information gained by multimodality imaging on a series of 58 patients with neck tumors, lymph node metastasis, Graves disease and chronic ENT inflammations. Background: Small tumors or subtle changes in inflammatory diseases cannot be detected in only one imaging series. Multimodality imaging allows for a combination of functional and anatomical information in one dataset and therefore gives more detailed informations on distinct changes. Procedure Details: For reproducible immobilization of the patient, an individual mold of the patient's head, neck and shoulder was produced using the BodyFix vacuum device (Medical Intelligence, Schwabm\u00fcnchen, Germany). Up to 8 modality-specific markers were reproducibly attached to the skin and to the mold. The data-sets were transferred to the TREON StealthStation navigation system (Medtronic Inc.) and image fusion was performed based on the markers and anatomical landmarks. Image fusion allowed precise correlation of suspicious tracer-enhancements to tumorous contrast-enhanced nodules on the CT images. In patients with Graves disease and ENT inflammations focal disease in homogeneous tissues was uncovered due to increased tracer uptake. US images were used for screening and to depict vascularisation.",

Background: Lemierre's syndrome is the triad of pharyngitis, internal jugular vein thrombosis and pulmonary infection. The causative organism is Fusobacterium necrophorum. This is a commonly fatal disease requiring both the radiologist and clinician to keep an index of suspicion. The diagnostic findings include pharyngitis with direct local invasion into the lateral pharyngeal space and thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein. Metastatic infection is common and the usual site is pulmonary (80%). Imaging Findings: The imaging findings include pharyngitis with direct spread of infection into the lateral pharyngeal spaces. Internal jugular vein thrombosis and pulmonary infiltration leading to cavitation are the next most common findings.Other findings include pleural effusions, spinal and brain abscesses, septic arthritis and IVC thrombosis. A variety of imaging modalities are employed to assess the patient with disseminated Fusobacterial infection.

The examinations were performed with Aplio US-System (Toshiba) with 7.5 MHz broadband transducer. PD and ADF (either 2D and 3D) were applied pre and post application of ultrasound contrast agent (intravenous bolus of 2.4 mL SonoVue). The methods were compared by visual assessment. Results: Both CE ADF and PD are sufficient to depict blood supply. While PD delivers better B-Mode information, ADF allows continuous examination due to the lower MI thus giving more time to acquire 3D data set and determining signal intensity time curve after one bolus application of contrast. ADF showed less artifacts concerning blooming and cluttering in number and extent in almost all cases. In 5 cases, we were able to demonstrate a perfusion after 6 weeks of therapy but in 3 it was only possible using CE techniques. Conclusion: Although PD delivers more B-Mode information ADF is the method of choice since it has the same sensitivity for detecting blood vessels but allows continuous examination and is less susceptible for artifacts. Conclusion: Percutaneous islet cell transplantation appears to be a simple and clinical promising radiological intervention and an alternative to surgical pancreas transplantation in patients with type 1 diabetes refractory to insulin therapy.

Gil Bello; Sabadell/ES Learning Objectives: To illustrate our experience with colonic stents in the treatment of acute obstruction from colorectal cancer. To describe the results and complications of the procedure based on a series of 78 patients. Background: Colorectal cancer is an important health problem with a high morbidity and mortality rate. Between 10-30% of patients with colon cancer present with acute obstruction. 70% of acute obstructions are in the left colon and rectum, and only 40% of left sided carcinoma colonic obstructions can be treated with intraoperative lavage and subtotal colectomy. The rest of the patients need a temporary or, more probably, permanent colostomy with an important impact on quality of life. In this exhibit we will describe the use of colonic stents as a temporary treatment prior to elective surgery of left sided colon and rectal cancer and as a palliative treatment in the unresectable colon cancer. Between July 1997 and August 2003, 78 patients with acute colonic obstruction were treated with colonic stents in our department. The procedure, indications, contraindications, and the results are described and illustrated. Procedure Details: Plain abdominal radiography and abdominal CT was performed to all patients prior to the procedure. Two different types of colon stents were used: enteral Wallstent (Boston Scientific) and Hanarostent (MITech Co., Ltd.) Conclusion: Clinical resolution of the obstruction was achieved in 84%. Anastomosis was successfully performed in 95% of the patients undergoing surgery. Major complications developed in 13% (5 perforations, 5 obstructions and 3 migrations). Palliative treatment was effective in all cases.",

To describe the complications and patterns of recurrence of tumours after radiofrequency ablation. Background: The injection of saline to potentiate the effects of radiofrequency ablation in solid organ tumours in experimental models is well described in the literature. We have injected saline prior to ablation into primary hepatocellular carcinomas, colorectal metastases to the liver and primary renal cell carcinomas. Procedure and iImaging Details: Using either ultrasound guidance or CT and under general anaesthesia, we lace the tumour with 5 mL of 30% saline via a coaxial needle. A radioablation probe is then placed along the needle -the latter is then removed prior to applying the RF pulse. We routinely ablate the track along which the probe has travelled to avoid seeding. Routine follow-up with a dual phase abdominal CT scan is done at 1 month and 3 months. The appearances of ablated tumours, recurrences and complications are reviewed in this presentation.

The patients presented over a two-year period. The age range of these patients was sixteen to forty seven. The primary aetiology in three patients was a dental abscess. The fourth patient had an acute pharyngitis. Image Findings: A combination of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck and thorax was used to define the anatomical compartments involved. Radiological placement of an 8Fpigtail catheter using US or CT avoided a major surgical procedure in all patients. The common pathogen isolated was Streptococcus viridens. Patients were treated with the appropriate antibiotics and all made an uneventful recovery. Conclusion: An understanding of the anatomical spaces of the neck and their communication with the mediastinum is demonstrated and we recommend that in this condition, which has a high mortality when managed surgically, interventional radiology is an effective treatment option with a low complication rate. Complications occurring after drainage are not uncommon and add to the morbidity of the procedure. The authors display their experience in handling complications (remedial procedures with appropriate images) that occurred in 100 patients with malignant biliary obstruction, in whom PTBD and/or stenting was performed over a 2-year-period. The authors will also list precautions to be observed to prevent such complications. Procedure Details: Severe hemorrhage was treated by catheter repositioning, angiographic embolization of pseudoaneurysm and coil embolization of a portal vein branch rent via a PTBD tract. Cholangitis and bilomas required placement of additional drainage catheters. A migrated plastic stent was repositioned with vascular snare. A ring biliary catheter that broke during procedure, the proximal part lying in peritoneal cavity, was removed by image guided forceps, followed by replacement. Blocked plastic stents were removed endoscopically or via the percutaneous route by canulation with a guidewire followed by replacement. Ring biliary catheter and additional stents plastic/metallic stents were used for blocked metallic stents. Pericatheter leaks responded to flushing, wire passage or larger catheter exchange. Conclusion: It is important to be aware of complications that occur during PTBD and stenting, and how to deal with them before embarking on a full time biliary decompression program.",

Major complications, that includes hemoperitoneum, liver abscess, needle-tract seeding and cardiovascular death are 1.5% in PEI and 6.1% in RF. Conclusion: PEI and RF are effective local curative methods in liver tumors, with more frequent major complications in the RF group. and excellent (7-10). The efficacy was also evaluated with the days until the patients unable to move started to walk again after PVP. Results: PVP was technically successful in all patients with three cases of minimal complications. The mean VAS score for 198 patients was 7.16 before PVP compared with 2.05 after the procedure.

Morris 2 ; 1 Basle/CH, 2 Sydney/AU Purpose: To evaluate the effect of vessel size on radiofrequency lesion creation in the lung with respect to potential for perfusion-mediated heat sink effect and for vascular and bronchial injury. Methodology: Radiofrequency lesions targeted to tissue encompassing a variety of vessels were created in vivo in the lung of 10 cross-bred sheep. The access was either open after thoracotomy along the 5 th intercostal space, or percutaneous. Acute, subacute and chronic changes have been investigated, with immediate, 96 hours and 28 days sacrifice of the sheep post ablation. Macroscopic and histopathologic analysis of the vessels and bronchi was performed. The degree of vascular and bronchial injury and viability of perivascular pneumocytes were recorded. Results: Heat sink effect, macroscopically indicated by invagination of the lung tissue between the vessel and the radiofrequency lesion, was not observed in vessels with a diameter less than 3 mm. Half of the vessels 3 mm or smaller were thrombosed, while the arteries of the same size looked to be patent. Macroscopically no vessel wall injury could be detected. All vessels 5 mm and above showed a certain extent of invagination, no clots were visible. Occasionally within the bronchial lumen small amounts of dark solid material was seen, macroscopically believed to be consolidated blood-tinged sputum. The histopathological results are expected soon. Conclusion: As already shown for liver vessels, lung vessels seem to also have a perfusion-related heat sink effect, consistently seen in vessels above 5 mm in diameter.",

Kelekis; Athens/GR Purpose: To present the additional difficulties and technical peculiarities of radiofrequency ablation (RF) for hepatic dome lesions. Materials and Methods: 19 patients with focal subphrenic hepatic lesions (8 HCCs, 11 metastases) underwent percutaneous CT-guided RF ablation. Electrodes with 7 or 9 active tips were advanced under CT-guidance. Although technically difficult due to the great needle angulation and penetration of a long hepatic portion, transhepatic route was followed in all cases. Transpulmonary penetration was considered high-risk due to the large diameter of the electrode. Results: All patients experienced mild discomfort during the procedure. Three complications were noted: 2 small subcapsular hematomas and 1 pleural effusion, which were treated conservatively. 75% of the HCCs and 81.2% of the metastatic lesions showed signs of complete necrosis immediately post procedure. Residual non-necrotic tumour was present in 4 cases and repetition of the procedure was required. Tumour recurrence was demonstrated in 2 patients (10.52%) on 1-year follow-up control and was treated with a new session of RF ablation. Overall, 25 RF sessions were performed. Conclusion: Hepatic dome lesions can be treated successfully with RF ablation. Careful planning and technical skill are required due to their location. Results: No treatment complications were noted. The patients recovered well post injection. CT performed in both children after three months showed ossification of the lytic lesions, allowing the cervical braces to be removed. Conclusions: To our knowledge no prior experience in endosteal cervical steroid injection has been reported. These two cases confirm the improvement of osteolytic lesions in children with LCH after treatment with endosteal infusion of steroids. Stabilisation of the cervical spine was particularly beneficial, as the children were no longer in pain and removed the need for cervical braces three months after the treatment.",

Endothelialization were found in patent vessels from 1 week to 3 weeks after ablation. Conclusion: Endothelization was confirmed from 1 week to 3 weeks after RFA in patent vessels. Blood vessels with diameters of 3.0 mm and over maintain high patency even after RFA. It is therefore possible to maintain blood flow in the distal area of hepatic parenchyma following ablation for hepatic tumors, thus RFA has a limited impact on hepatic function. In three cases, a successful second trial after an initial failure was performed. The procedure was performed by means of a transhepatic (n = 63) or a transperitonea l (n = 76) access route. During procedure, the Seldinger technique was used (transhepatic approach, n = 63, transperitoneal approach, n = 62) in 125 patients, while in the remaining 14 patients the procedure were performed using a trocar technique with a transperitoneal approach. Chiba needles (20G, Mdtech, Denmark, n = 22), JELCO needles (16G, Johnson & Johnson, USA, n = 67) and Secalon catheters (16G, Ohmeda, UK, n = 36) were used for initial puncture of GB. Only minor complications such as abdominal pain (n = 16), hemorrhage (n = 2), referred pain (n = 4) occurred in 21 cases (15%). Abdominal pain is more frequent in transhepatic approach (18%) than in transperitoneal approach (7%), but not statistically significant (p = 0.061). Overall complication rate is lower in transperitoneal approach (8%) than in transhepatic approach (24%)(p = 0.016). According to puncture needle, there is no significant difference in complication rate between the Chiba needle (18%) and the 16 G needle (Jelco needle and Secalon catheter, 16%). Conclusion: Percutaneous cholecystostomy has proved to be safe and effective treatment for patients with acute cholecystitis.",

Carcione; Palermo/IT Purpose: To evaluate the CT role in treatment of lumbosciatalgia through chemonucleolysis with oxygen-ozone (O2-O3) mixture with periradicular and periganglionic technique. Materials and Methods: From January 2000 to June 2002, 145 patients (85 women, 60 men; age range: 30-75 years) with lumbosciatalgia, underwent intradiscal, periradicular and periganglionic treatment with O2-O3 mixture, corticosteroids and anaesthetics. The analysis of the results was made by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 1 day before treatment (T0) and, respectively, 4 weeks (T1), 3 months (T2), 6 months (T3) later. All the procedure was performed in a step-wise fashion and controlled by CT scans: from positioning the needle in the centre of the nucleus polposus to mixture administration within the nucleus and in periradicular and periganglionic sites. Results: In 125/145 (86.2%) patients a partial remission of the complaints just after the first treatment (VAS 6 at T1) was observed; VAS was 4 at T2 and at the last evaluation, six months later (T3), it was 2. In 20/145 (13.8%) patients VAS was 8 at T1 and another treatment was performed, with an improvement of VAS at T2 and T3 respectively of 6 and 3 in 15/20 cases. The remaining 5/20 patients did not show any improvement even after the second treatment and VAS ranged from 8 to 10 at T3. Conclusions: Chemonucleolysis with O2-O3 mixture with periradicular and periganglionic technique under CT guidance is a reliable and competitive method in treatment of lumbosciatalgia.",

            "text": "Multiple In 22 patients with malignant biliary obstruction of the hilum and unavailable bilateral access, drainage of biliary tree was obtained with one percutaneous access through which multiple stent deployment was performed with a cross-positioning technique. The first self-expandable endoprosthesis was positioned in the common bile duct. Thereafter a balloon catheter was inserted along a previously introduced guide wire to dilate the mesh of the stent. After having removed the catheter, a second stent was implanted through the dilated wall of the first stent, across the hilum. Overall 47 stents have been cross-implanted. In 20 patients 2 stents have been inserted, in 1 patient 3 stents, in another patient cross-positioning of 4 stents was required. Results: No relevant complications have occurred. Patient survival and stent patency rates were comparable with those of multiple-access stenting technique. The procedure is generally more protracted implying an increased radiation exposure for both the patient and the operator. Conclusion: Biliary stenting with one percutaneous access and cross-positioning technique is a useful procedure in all cases in which bilateral access in not possible. It reduces the risks connected to multiple passages of liver parenchyma though at the expense of a longer time of exposure for both the patient and the radiologist. Results: In 10 (91%) patients pain relief was complete within one to two days after injection. One (9%) patient with multilevel hemangioma failed to respond. We did not observe any complications. Conclusion: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a promising therapy for patients with painful vertebral hemangiomas. This method is effective, with low risk of complications, and may be appliciable to asymptomatic cases as a preventive treatment.",

Badea; Cluj Napoca/RO Purpose: The evaluation of the efficacy of ultrasound guided aspiration followed by lavage with antibiotics in the treatment of gallbladder bed abscesses after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Materials and Method: 20 patients with gallbladder bed abscesses were treated percutaneously between 2000-2002. The abscesses were located in gallbladder bed with extension into subhepatic area 35% (7/20). The volume of aspirated pus was 5-20 mL (average 15 mL). The first step of the treatment was the abscess puncture by a transhepatic 65% (13/20) or another approach 35% (7/20) using an 18 G needle (1.2 mm). After pus aspiration, the cavity was washed 2-3 times with a Metronidazol + Ampicillin solution, the amount of antibiotics once injected being half the amount of the aspirated pus. Oral or IV antibiotics (corresponding to antibiogram) were administrated for 7-10 days. In the case of fluid reaccumulation the treatment was repeated. Background: PTPE is a reliable tool to induce liver regeneration of the nonembolized lobe. This facilitates extended right resection in e.g. Klatskin tumor, HCC or liver metasases. Between 1998 and 2000 we performed 80 PTPE. In three cases we noted a failure in regeneration of segment II + III but a growth of segment IV after right lobe embolization. In 10 portal vein ligations which regularly spare segment IV the regenerative outcome was significantly reduced compared to PTPE including segment IV. Procedure Details: In 9/10 patients we use a subxiphoidal access to puncture the left portal vein under US-guidance, otherwise a transhepatic right intercostal access. Via 5F guiding catheters a 2.5F microcatheter is placed in each segmental branch in order to apply 5-8 mL histoacryl-lipiodol solution in total. Segment IV branches are difficult to reach because of the configuration of the Rex recessus anatomy. Since the left lateral segments lie adjacent, the emolization of segment IV is critical and has to be performed with the utmost care to prevent spill over of embolzation material. Conclusion: Segment IV turnes out to be the key for optimal portal vein embolization results. Although bearing the risk of embolization material displacement to segment II and III the better results clearly suggest application of this technique. 3. Palliation of duodenal obstruction via trans-oral route (n = 5) and trans-gastric route (n = 4). Procedural Details and Results: For group 1 and 2, and the trans-oral route in group 3, the technique is essentially an extension to the well established technique of oesophageal stenting of malignancy (except longer wires and catheters are used when more distal stenting is required). As more distal lesions are tackled, the intrinsic difficulty of manipulating long wires and catheters increases and gives way to the more direct transgastric route approach of group 3. This is also an extension to the well established technique of radiological insertion of gastrostomy using T-bar fixation. Failure of insertion occurred in 2 patients in the duodenal obstruction group via the trans-oral route. There were no immediate or delayed complications and no re-interventions were required. Five patients (30%) returned to normal diet, 6 patients managed semi-solid diet (40%) and 5 patients (30%) had no significant improvement post stent insertion respectively. The mean survival for groups (2) and (3) (i.e. primary carcinoma) was 58 days (range 10 to 224 days). Conclusion: Radiological placement of gastroduodenal stents is effective for palliation of upper GI malignancies.",

Aschoff; Ulm/DE Learning Objectives: To demonstrate the additional impact of contrast enhanced multi-detector-row-CT angiography (MDR-CTA) compared to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for planning of angiographic intervention. Backround: In selected cases a pre-interventional CTA can be useful to facilitate angiographic intervention. We selected four patients with different disease entities (pulmonary AV malformation; bleeding caused by hepatic aneurysmosis and from renal pseudoaneurysm after partial renal resection; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prior to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with aberrant arteries) from our collective who underwent CTA prior to angiographic intervention. Procedure Details: All CT scans were performed using a 16 channel Multi-Detector-Row-CT (Philips Mx8000 IDT). Both multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) and slab maximum intensity projections (slab MIP) were performed. After CTA, patients underwent angiographic intervention (coil embolisation in the first three, TACE in the last case). MDR-CTA can demonstrate the exact extent and localize multiple vascular malformations, as demonstrated in the first case. In addition, MDR-CTA can not only find the cause of hemorrhage but also demonstrate the exact localization of the specific vascular pathology (2 nd and 3 rd case). These findings facilitate the intervention, resulting in decreased In three children, a renal artery stenosis between 80 and 90% due to fibromuscular dysplasia was discovered. In two of these three, the stenosis was unilateral and in one bilateral. In the remaining child, a long stenosis of unknown etiology was discovered. Procedure Details: In all patients, PTRA was performed after having exactly defined the morphology and the hemodynamics of the renal artery stenoses. In three children we have achieved very good. Results: PTRA was successful resulting in an increased diameter of the arterial lumen. PTRA was repeated and unsuccessful in one child with a severe stenosis and an emphasised \"recoil\" phenomenon. Autotransplantation was therefore performed. Reference is made to current controversies on this issue. Background: Endoluminal repair is an acceptable treatment modality for abdominal aneurysms. Implant selection is based on the aneurysm's neck anatomy, resulting in two main implant groups; those fixed above the level of the renal arteries, and those fixed below this level. Each group presents advantages and disadvantages that should be considered in the selection process. Type I endoleaks are the most common complications derived from implant selection. Procedure Details: In order to select the implant, the patient should undergo a contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan with coronal reconstructions to image in detail the abdominal aorta, and measure the size of the aneurysm, the distance from the renal arteries to the upper border of the aneurysm, and several other measurements needed. Alternatives are abdominal aortic DSA and MRA. The two main features that will determine the fixation site are the neck's shape and distance. Sealing is always infrarenal. Suprarenal devices provide better fixation, although some series report small renal parenchyma infarcts, due to emboli. Infrarenal devices are easier to handle, provide for small corrections one placed, but cannot be placed in tortuous necks. Conclusions: Two main implant groups are used in endoluminal abdominal aneurysm repair, the suprarenal and infrarenal fixation devices. Proper patient selection is needed to decide which device is to be used, in order to minimize post-procedural complications. ",

Diagnostic percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) was performed in all patients, followed by placement of an internal-external biliary drain in the same procedure. In 10 patients presenting with stenosis in the area of the anastomosis, dilatation with balloon angioplasty was also carried out. In 2 patients with biliary calculi, lithotomy was performed followed by expulsion of the calculi to the digestive tract. One patient presented with a massive biliary leak that did not respond to percutaneous drainage and required implantation of a metal prosthesis. Results: The transhepatic approach was used for the diagnostic study, for locating the cause of the complication and to carry out the therapeutic maneuvers required for its resolution. In the 24 patients studied, the initial outcome of percutaneous treatment was satisfactory (100% technical success) and in 16 of them (66%) it was the definitive therapeutic measure. Among the remaining 8 patients, 4 underwent surgical re-anastomosis and 4 re-transplantation. Drainage placement was beneficial in all patients, allowing elective surgical treatment once the infectious-obstructive complication was resolved. Conclusion: Interventional radiology plays an important role in the therapeutic management of hepatic post-transplantation biliary complications. PTC allows precise early diagnosis of the complication. The interventional technique reduces the need for reoperation, thereby reducing associated morbidity and mortality.",

Sakai 1 , T. Kitayama 1 , M. Hamuro 1 , R. Yamada 1 , Y. Inoue 1 , T. Kaminou 2 ; 1 Osaka/JP, 2 Yonago/JP Purpose: The rupture of gastric varices (GV) is a serious complication in patients with portal hypertension. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and transcatheter sclerotherapy (TS) are effective treatments of GV. The effects on the portal pressure completely differ in TIPS and TS. However, to our knowledge, no comparative study of the two treatments for GV has been reported. The purpose of this study was to compare TIPS with TS on GV bleeding and survival. Materials and Methods: A total of 139 cirrhotic patients with GV underwent endovascular treatment. Of the 139 patients, 104 without hepatocellular caricinoma were enrolled in this study; 27 patients were treated by TIPS, and 77 patients by TS. GV bleeding and survival rates were compared between the TIPS and TS groups. Multivariate analysis was used to identify the prognostic factors for GV bleeding and survival. Results: The cumulative GV bleeding rate at 1 year was 20% in the TIPS group, and 2% in the TS group (p < 0.01). The prognostic factor associated with GV bleeding was the treatment method. The cumulative survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years, were 81%, 64%, and 40%, in the TIPS group, and 96%, 83%, and 76%, in the TS group, respectively (p < 0.01). The prognostic factors for survival were the treatment method and the Child-Pugh classification. Conclusion: TS may be more useful for GV than TIPS in consideration of GV bleeding and survival. Results: TPSAE was technically feasible in all patients without procedure-related complications. Despite significant higher injury grade (3.7 vs 2), higher rate of active contrast extravasation (38% vs 3%) and higher amount of hemoperitone-um on CT, secondary bleeding rate requiring splenectomy was lower in the TP-SAE group (2.7% vs 10%). Conclusion: TPSAE is a feasible and safe procedure in the treatment of splenic injury. TPSAE allows a non-operative management despite a selection of severe splenic injuries with one of the lowest reported secondary splenectomy rates.",

Brueckmann; Munich/DE Purpose: With a death rate of more than 50%, vertebrobasilar thromboembolism still remains a dangerous disease. This high rate can be mainly attributed to the overall failure of recanalization of 30%, depending on the extensiveness of the clot. This is especially in multisegmental occlusions, where the recanalization rate is very low and mortality is about 90%. We investigated the feasibility of using a coronary mechanical device based on the Bernoulli effect (Angiojet) for rapid recanalization. Methods: Ten patients with acute vertebrobasilar occlusion were included in the pilot study. Inclusion depended on the presence of multisegmental intracranial (8 patients) or any extracranial occlusions and coma lasting no more than 8 hours. Local intra-arterial fibrinolysis had failed in two patients before the Angiojet was used, and thrombolysis was administered to two patients afterwards (rt-PA). Five patients underwent additional intracranial balloon or stent angioplasty, and five received platelet inhibition by tirofiban. Results: Treament was primarily done with the Angiojet and succeeded in complete recanalization in 90% of the patients (97% of the vessel segments). Addition of fibrinolysis resulted in success in 100% of patients and segments. Three hemorrhages were associated with additional thrombolysis, tirofiban, or both. Seventy percent of the patients survived, and 60% had moderate to excellent outcome.",

Conclusion: Transradial and transulnar approach are alternative catheterization methods even in abdominal angiography and intervention. Pre-and post-operative CT scans before discharge, at 1, 3, 6 months and biannually thereafter were performed; pLA and pIMA were evaluated in each followup scan and the number of pLA was counted.These data were correlated with the frequency of EL-II. Pre-and postoperative volumes of the aneurysmal sacs were measured from CT data. Results: Median follow-up was 24 months (range 6-36 months).In total 706 CT scans were performed and analyzed. Six months after stent-graft implantation pIMA and/or at least 2 pLA were seen in 45 patients (50.5%); 11 patients (12.4% of the study cohort) had an EL-II. No EL-II was seen in patients without pLA/ pIMA. Three groups were identified and compared: patients without pLA/pIMA/ EL-II and patients with pLA/pIMA with/without EL-II. A tendency to minor mean volume loss in patients with pLA/pIMA and a significant trend to volume increase in patients with EL-II in later follow-ups was seen. Conclusion: There is a high incidence of pLA/pIMA in patients after EVR. Persistent lumbar and inferior mesenteric artery perfusion is associated with significantly higher EL-II rates after EVR of AAA. Significant differences in volume changes in later follow-ups were seen between patients with or without EL-II.",

Becker; Geneva/CH Purpose: To evaluate the effects of selective transarterial chemoembolization (S-TACE) in patients with suspected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Materials and Methods: 36 candidates for OLT, with viral or alcoholic cirrhosis and a total of 64 nodules suspected to be HCC (1-5 nodules of 0.7-5.7 cm), underwent S-TACE with doxorubicine/lipiodol in 1-3 sessions. Catheter position was segmental or subsegmental in 71% and unilobar in 29%. Particles were added unless complete stasis was observed. The delay between S-TACE and OLT was 129 (5-500) days. Histologic findings of the explanted livers was correlated with all clinical, biologic and radiologic parameters. Results: Based on the final diagnosis, 58 nodules were HCC, five were regenerative nodules and one was focal nodular hyperplasia. We observed total or neartotal necrosis (> 90%) in 35 (60.4%) HCC nodules and no dissemination was present. Twenty-three HCC (39.6%) nodules were partially necrotic; in 13 of these, capsular and/or vascular invasion were present. One patient developed a pseudoaneurysm at the puncture site; no other complication was observed. Conclusion: S-TACE leads to complete necrosis in the majority of HCC nodules. OLT candidates with a long waiting period should be followed by repeated imaging studies, in order to be able to prevent tumor regrowth or spread by repeating S-TACE when necessary.",

There were also observed certain post-hospitalization complications which included: a) clotting of stent-graft leg in 2 cases b) leak type I which demanded implantation of additional element of stent-graft in one case c) small leaks type I in 3 cases and type II in 2 cases which did not demand any further intervention-the type II leaks were observed in 3 cases 6 months after the operation d) the increase of parietal circular thrombus inside the main part of the stent-graft in two cases e) complaints connected with the internal iliac artery occlusion were declared by 4 patients. The catheter has four microsurgical blades that cut directly into the stenotic plaque during inflation. Recently they were proposed for the use in peripheral arterial system using a balloon diameter raging from 4 up to 5.5 mm. Material and Methods: Seven consecutive patients (mean age 58 years) were treated with cutting balloon PTA (CB-PTA) from June until September 2003. All of them had severe multiple, calcified stenosis of the femoro-popliteal artery, maximum 2 cm in length, never treated before. All patients had important associated risk factors such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hyperlipoproteinemia and smoking. Results: CB-PTA was technically successful in all patients, with lumen diameter improvement at least of 50% or residual stenosis less than 20%; moreover we never observed major dissection of the intimal plaque and we never required stent placement. Conclusion: CB-PTA in lower limb calcified stenoses is a promising technique that seems to be superior to PTA alone, without requiring stenting in femoropopliteal arteries. Aneurysm diameter in all patients were > 5 cm (average diameter were 6.9 cm, range, 5.5-10.4 cm). The mean follow-up was 17 months. Average hospital stay after the intervention was 7-9 days. Results: The stent-grafts were successfully deployed in all patients. Control spiral CT 24 hours after the procedure revealed endoleak in 5 patients (15.6%). Spiral CT follow-up on 7 th day following the intervention showed that in 4 patients endoleak spontaneously stopped and in one patient small endoleak was seen, but it also stopped within a month following the intervention. In two patients (6.3%) acute thrombosis of iliac graft extensions was diagnosed a month after the intervention. In both cases successful endovascular thrombolysis was performed with good clinical outcome. In one patient (3%), progression of atherosclerotic disease resulted in migration of the stent-graft two years after the placement of the graft. Reintervention was done with successful deployment of additional aortic extension of the stent-graft. Average reduction of aneurysm diameter was 8.2 mm (range, 0-32 mm). Conclusion: Endovascular treatment of AAA with Talent stent-graft is a safe and effective procedure. In patients with well defined indication it is safe alternative to open surgery procedure.",

Rampoldi; Milan/IT Purpose: Percutaneous thrombin injection under sonographic guidance has been shown to be an effective and well tolerated treatment for a iatrogenic femoral pseudoaneurysms. For these reasons some authors suggest thrombin injection as alternative treatment also in other body districts. We illustrate our experience, techniques and results in the ablation of pseudoaneurysms of different etiologies and locations whit direct thrombin injection. Materials and Methods: From June 2000 we treated six patients, age range 33-75 years, affected with pseudoaneurysms developed after iatrogenic trauma in three patients (arising from radial, posterior tibial and thoraco-acromial arteries), post-pancreatitis (splenic and superior mesenteric arteries) in two patients and in one patient after spontaneous rupture of renal angiomyolipoma in tuberous sclerosis. Two patients were anticoagulated. The diameter of pseudoaneurysms varied between 2.4-11.5 cm. After disinfection of the entry site, we slowly injected bovine thrombin (1000 U/mL of solution) percutaneously under ultrasound guidance in four cases, while in two cases we injected directly the thrombin in the pseudoaneurysm cavity with a fluoroscopically guided endovascular angiographic catheter. Results: All interventions were successful and showed no immediate or late complications. Doses of thrombin needed varied between 200-6000 units (0.2-6 mL of solution). A complete thrombosis of the pseudoaneurysm sac was accomplished within minutes of thrombin injection. No recurrence was seen at the follow-up. Conclusion: In selected cases, direct thrombin injection may be useful in treating non-femoral pseudoaneurysms resulting in rapid and persistent occlusion. In our limited experience it represents a safe and effective minimally invasive technique and an alternative to surgical repair.",

Park; Pusan/KR Purpose: To report two cases of successful emergent endovascular treatment of ruptured pseudoaneurysm from the hepatic artery using balloon expandable coronary stent-grafts. Materials and Methods: Case 1. A 65-year-old male underwent Whipple's operation for a cholangiocarcinoma in the distal common bile duct, but his postoperative course was complicated by serious blood loss from a ruptured pseudoaneurysm in the common hepatic artery. Using premounted coronary stent-grafts (Jostent, JoMed, Germany), the neck of the aneurysm was completely excluded. Case 2. A 66-year-old male underwent surgical treatment of a Klatskin's tumor and hepaticojejunostomy. Four weeks later, an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding prompted celiac angiography. Active bleeding from a small pseudoaneurysm in the right hepatic artery was controlled with endovascular deployment of a premounted coronary stent-graft (Jostent, JoMed, Germany). The final angiogram demostrated a total exclusion of the aneurysm with preservation of the arterial lumen. Results: Transcatheter embolization using a variety of embolizing materials has been considered the treatment of choice for true or false hepatic artery aneurysms. However stent exclusion of the hepatic artery bleeding in an emergent situation has been reported only in few cases. For patients with a compromised blood supply due to portal vein occlusion or exclusion of important collateral pathways by surgical operation, a stent-graft may become the procedure of choice.",

To describe the most often used interventional devices (ID) benefiting from the recent intensive research activity to improve their functionality or their biocompatibility. 2. To provide an update on the current status of new materials and biomaterials available in the field of vascular and non-vascular interventional radiology, including our original experimental data 3. To discuss the importance and the safety issues related to the use of biomaterials and coating materials concerning ID. Background: In the past decade, interventional radiology has allowed percutaneous access devices and therapeutic implants to be more reliable and effectively used due to the availabiliity of new materials. Currently, there are several passive or active stent coatings commercially available with good results in preliminary studies. These materials more often result from industrial research and less frequently from medical research. Procedure Details: In this paper, we discuss biomaterials currently available for use, together with new biomaterials for the vascular or non-vascular ID, such as, for example, the drug-eluting stents, coils for embolization, and biliary/ureteral catheters or stents. Finally, we discuss the future of biomaterial use in interventional radiology with the original data in our laboratory (e.g., antithrombogenic and biocompatible stent coating: diamond-like carbon). Conclusion: Biocompatible issues are very critical for ID in order to coexist with living tissue without causing harm. Considering the recent advances in new materials with biological effects, we believe the biomaterials will soon constitute a new core of interventional radiology. The radiologists should establish new research domains and complete new and effective products.",

We have performed highly integrated imaging diagnosis and interventional therapy with this system in more than 200 patients. Procedure Details: Angiography assisted multidetector-CT was performed for the diagnosis and the target therapy of hepatic, pancreatic, adrenal and renal tumors and uterine myomas. In addition, multidetector-CT assisted angiography and interventional therapy was performed for vascular recanalization, such as aortic and peripheral vascular stent therapy; for endovascular treatment of aneurysms and for percutaneous therapy of varices, with a variety of three-dimensional reformatting techniques. We also performed several interventional procedures, such as percutaneous biopsy, biliary and abscess drainage, with this system. Conclusion: We introduce our highly integrated intervetional CT system with technical merits to clinical use. Background: CT is the imaging method of choice to evaluate hemodynamically stable patients with significant blunt abdominopelvic trauma. Contrast enhancement is essential for the diagnosis of many visceral injuries in these patients. It has been demonstrated that contrast-enhanced CT is valuable in the detection of active extravasation of contrast material. The detection of contrast extravasation is critical because it indicates an ongoing, potentially life-threatening hemorrhage. Imaging Findings: The purpose of this exhibit is to review our experience with active contrast extravasation in patients with blunt trauma to the abdomen and pelvis. Findings of contrast-enhanced CT are correlated with those of conventional angiography. The role of angiography and transarterial embolization in patients with active extravasation on contrast-enhanced CT will be discussed. Conclusion: Contrast extravasation on CT can be used to localize anatomic sites of hemorrhage and to guide immediate angiographic or surgical intervention in patients with abdominopelvic trauma. State-of-the-art CT enables a more detection of contrast extravasation than is possible with conventional and single detector helical CT. ",

This permits visualisation of the needle in \"real time\", allowing accurate needle placement. A novel laser guidance device that facilitates needle placement during ultrasound guided biopsy is presented. Methods: A laser module was constructed by mounting a laser diode in a nylon tube. A lens was used to transform the pencil laser beam into a linear alignment beam. The laser module was mounted on an ultrasound probe using a customdesigned clip that consisted of two polycarbonate half shells. The linear laser beam was calibrated to be coplanar to the ultrasound beam. No probe modifications were necessary. Fourteen biopsy operators performed eight free hand and eight laser guided biopsies each of capsicum-stuffed olives suspended in gelatine phantoms. Endpoints measured were: (1) time to biopsy, (2) sample quality and (3) perceived usefulness.",

However, 71% of operators stated that laser guidance had a positive effect on the procedure, and 79% said that they would use it in the future. Conclusion: A probe-mounted laser guidance device is perceived to facilitate accurate ultrasound guided needle insertion by the majority of operators in a pilot study. Planning of the intervention is on basis of CT-imaging data sets acquired immediately before an intervention. Spatial relation between imaging space and targeting device is either established by using of an optical tracker system or via robot registration based on a CT data set.

Hahn; Budapest/HU Aim: The aim is to create a model of a liver resection combined with intraoperative irradiation for micrometastases. This combined ischemic-reperfusion and irradiation injury of the liver has not yet been investigated. Methods: Normothermic segmental liver ischemia were created on 250-280 g male Wistar rats. Rats were divided into four groups for 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes of ischemia. Hepatic microcirculation was studied by laser Doppler Flowmeter. Histological alterations were followed. I, II, IV lobes were exposed to 0, 25 and 50 Gy of Cs-137 \u00e3-radiation. ALP, ALT, AST, LDH, bilirubin and TNF-\u00e1 tests were performed. Results: Reperfusion was assesed by post-ischemic flux plato maximum (PM), by area under the curve (RT) and by the time to maximum flux level (RMI). Flowmetery showed a nonlinear fashion of reperfusion according to ischemic period. After 30 and 45 minutes ischemia the rate of the reperfusion is almost the same. 60 minutes of ischemia represents an intermediate lesion in term of recovery. After 90 minutes, minirapid deterioration of flux (below 20% of control) was observed. Survival is rather determined by the length of the ischemic period, than the irradiation dose. Low dose irradiation (25 Gy) with short-term ischemia (30 min) did not result in increased liver enzymes and resulted only in minimal histological changes. The group of 25 Gy irradiation with normotherm, short-term ischemia seems to be tolerable for the tumor-free liver. Conclusion: Liver toleratse irradiation injury suprisingly well and preconditioning promotes restitution of liver circulation after ischemic injury. Purpose: The aim of the study was to assess radiation exposure to the radiologist incurred with CT fluoroscopy.",

Scatter exposures were measured with and without radiation protection devices: without and with placement of a lead drape on the patient, with and without use of thin rubber radiation protection gloves. In addition, scatter radiation was determined for a combination of lead drape and radiation protection gloves. Results: There is a wide variety for the use of CT fluoroscopy ranging from diagnostic biopsy procedures to therapeutic interventions such as radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases and CT fluoroscopy-guided osteosynthesis of fractures. Scatter exposure rates to the hand of the radiologist ranged from 1 to 320 micro Sv per case without use of a lead drape and radiation protection gloves. The lead drape reduced the scatter exposure to the hand of the radiologist by 65 percent. Radiation protection gloves reduced scatter radiation by 36 percent. The combination of both radiation protection devices was most effective in decreasing the dose by 76 percent. Conclusion: CT fluoroscopy is a useful targeting method with a wide variety for interventional procedures. However, significant radiation exposures may occur. Therefore, the radiologists should be aware of different techniques of CT fluoroscopy guidance and the methods to reduce scatter radiation. Purpose: Workforce planning, deskilling scenarios and risk containment are generating a need for interventional training processes remote from patients. Fixed models lack ultimate realism, and animal models lack pathology with political problems in the UK. Virtual environments for interventional needle puncture training require accurate haptics, based on force relationships between tools and tissues, and visualization. To achieve this demands advancements in tissue segmentation, assignment of tissue properties and generation of synthetic images from abnormal patient anatomy and pathology. These challenges require wideranging expertise and will probably take over a decade to achieve fully. No existing simulator model covers interventional radiological needle access procedures (eg: targeted biopsy, nephrostomy, biliary and abscess drainage). Thus a substantive collaboration is essential to develop appropriate virtual training environments.",

Dimitriadis 1 ; 1 Thessaloniki/GR, 2 Kavala/GR Learning Objectives: To present the imaging features which help in the differential diagnosis of the femoral head \"bone marrow edema pattern\". Background: Bone marrow edema of the femoral head is a non-specific MRI finding associated with various painful conditions of the hip like osteonecrosis, idiopathic transient osteoporosis, transient bone marrow edema syndrome, migratory osteoporosis and stress fracture. A total number of approximately 400 hip MRI examinations were performed in three different diagnostic centers from January 1997 to July 2003. Bone marrow edema was present in 80 cases. Procedure Details: MRI units used ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 Tesla and the examination protocols included T1 SE and T2 FSE fat-sat or STIR axial and coronal images, while sagittal images and contrast administration were reserved for specific cases. Patients with typical findings leading to the diagnosis of osteonecrosis or fracture were excluded. The remaining patients had non-specific bone marrow edema of the femoral head which was demonstrated as diffuse, ill defined, low signal intensity on T1W images, high on T2W and STIR images, and extended to the femoral neck region. In half of the patients follow -up examinations were also available. We selected and present the imaging criteria, at presentation and follow -up, which can lead to an early specific diagnosis. Conclusion: Bone marrow edema of the hip has to be correctly interpreted in order to avoid overtreatment in transient and self-limiting conditions. The presence of subtle subchondral lesions and the temporal evolution are usually key to diagnosis.",

Imaging Findings: 1284 patients with histologically proved diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions in our institution between January 1991 and December 2002 were identified from the pathology data base. Imaging findings with plain radiography, CT and MRI were retrospectively reviewed and correlated with key pathologic features. The various patterns of periosteal reaction are arranged into the following categories: continuous (smooth, lobulated, and ridged shells, solid, single lamella, laminated or \"onion skin\", and parallel spiculated or \"hair on end\" reactions), interrupted (buttres, Codman triangle, lamellated, and spiculated reactions), and complex (divergent spiculated or \"sunburst\", and combined reactions). The most representative cases of each form of periosteal reaction are displayed.

In MR images, spin-echo (SE) T1-weighted images (T1-WI) and T2-WI were obtained and Gd-DTPA contrast enhanced images were obtained in 5 cases. In these cases, the location, the radiographic findings, signal and enhanced pattern on MRI were analyzed. Imaging Findings: In 5 cases, the tumor located in epiphysis (45.5%), in 2 cases in apophysis (18.2%), in 3 cases in apo-metaphysis (27.3%), in 1 cases in epimetaphysis (9.0%). In all cases, the tumor was depicted as radiolucent area and in 5 cases, the sclerotic margin was recognized. In all cases, the tumor was revealed as iso-intensity comparing with surrounding muscle on T1-WI. On T2WI, in 7 cases, the tumor revealed as iso-intensity with bone marrow and in the other 4 cases, it revealed as low intensity. On T2-WI, in 8 cases, high intensity area was included which corresponds to the cystic degeneration. In all 5 cases, the tumor was moderately enhanced on contrast enhanced T1-WI.

Imaging Findings: MR images performed on 1-1.5 T MR system of 10 histologically proven cases of parosteal osteosarcoma were retrospectively analyzed for the bones involved, location and the relationship between the signal intensity and the grade of the tumor.There were 8 females and 2 males. Ages ranged from 17 to 50 (mean 32.9). Most commonly affected bone was femur, on its distal end, posterior aspect (7). Histological grading was described as follows:Grade I: hypocellular stroma with subtle atypia; Grade II: mild increase in stromal cellularity and more prominent cytologic atypia, Grade III: marked pleomorphism with high cytologic atypia and mitotic rate, also called dedifferentiated type. Regarding the described grading above, 6 of our cases were Grade I (low), 2 were Grade II (intermediate) and 2 were Grade III (high). On MRI, all of the parosteal osteosarcoma cases were of hypointense signal intensity on T1-weighted images and were hyperintense on T2-weighted images with no exception.

To describe imaging findings useful for an effective diagnosis 2. To discuss the main differential diagnosis with giant cell tumor (GCT) of knee. Background: GCT is a relatively common skeletal tumor. It is a benign but locally aggressive and destructive lesion composed of primitive histiocytes and large, multinucleated giant cells. The most frequent symptom is pain, local swelling, limited range of motion and pathologic fracture (10%). Location of GCT and age of patients suggest the diagnosis. It usually affects long tubular bones and, in particular around the knee, the most common site is distal femoral and proximal tibia (50 and 40% of all TGC). The main differential diagnoses include osteosarcoma (teleangectatic or fibrogenic), malignant fibrous istiocytoma, chondromyxoid fibroma and aneurysmal bone cysts. Treatment of choice is surgical resection but recurrence is frequent. Imaging Findings: On radiography GCT appears as an eccentric and geographic bone lysis, associated with a narrow zone of transition and lacking surrounding sclerosis. CT is superior to conventional radiography in outlining the extent of the tumor and in demonstrating cortical invasion but MR is currently the best imaging modality in determining extra-osseous extent, articular surface involvement and tumor recurrence with optimal definition of either osseous sclerosis or pseudocapsule. The signal characteristics of the lesion on the different MR sequences will be described to find out if they can help in differential diagnosis. Conclusion: Radiologic appearances of GCT is important in allowing prospective diagnosis, guiding therapy, and facilitating early detection of recurrence.",

Background: A superscan is a radionuclide bone scan which demonstrates markedly increased, homogenous skeletal radioisotope uptake relative to soft tissues and is usually associated with absent or faint renal images. A retrospective analysis of all whole body radionuclide bone scans performed over a fiveyear period was performed to identify the presence of superscans. Analysis was based on review of reports identified on a computerised Radiology Information System (RIS). Images were reviewed in association with other relevant imaging and in select cases, with laboratory data and clinical notes. A variety of cases were then selected for this pictorial review. Imaging Findings: A total of 6222 whole body bone scans were performed in our institution in the last five years. 11 superscans were selected for inclusion in this pictorial review. The vast majority of superscans identified were related to metastatic disease of which prostate cancer dominated. Superscans were also identified secondary to hyperparathroidism, metabolic bone disease including osteomalacia and Pagets disease. Conclusions: In this pictorial review, we describe the patho-physiological pathways resulting in the appearances of a superscan. In addition, we pictorially demonstrate a variety of causes resulting in superscan. Finally, interpretative pathways of analysis and helpful signs are suggested.",

Results: 95 patients (13.1%) showed BME with variable distribution, resulting from: acute trauma (57), stress fracture (4), degenerative disease (19), spontaneous osteonecrosis (8) and osteochondritis dissecans (6) of the femoral condyle, soft-tissue infection (1), excesive lateral pressure syndrome (1), iliotibial-band friction syndrome (1), transient BME (3), tumor (4), and nonspecific (9).

Conclusion: BME patterns at MRI can help to establish the possible cause of knee pain. When there is a history of acute trauma, edema shows typical features that can give the clue to a possible mechanism of injury.

The sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET for disease (presence of ET, and/or its metastases) were 95 and 75% respectively. FDG-PET and/ or other imaging modalities detected altogether 138 focal lesions. Sensitivity and specificity regarding focal lesions were 78 and 75%. This lower sensitivity is due to small lesions. WBS detected all 11 primary bone lesions present at WBS investigation, but only 8 of 70 bone metastases in four patients, while FDG-PET detected both the primaries and metastases. Conclusion: FDG-PET investigation is a valuable method in case of ET-s. Concerning the detection of bone metastases of ET-s FDG-PET is superior to WBS, while for the depiction of small lesions mainly represented by pulmonary metastases FDG-PET is less sensitive than helical CT.

Argentos 1 , N.L. Kelekis 2 ; 1 Piraeus/GR, 2 Athens/GR Purpose: Osteomyelitis presents as a complication in a percentage of patients after metallic bone-implant placement. Early and accurate detection is crucial for proper treatment. Conventional MR images are usually severely degraded from intense artifacts, rendering interpretation often impossible. We report our results using an optimized MR imaging protocol in detecting foci of osteomyelitis near metallic bone implants. Materials and Methods: During the last year we examined 17 patients (12 men and 5 women, age range 25-70) with metallic bone implants and clinical suspicion of osteomyelitis. The MR protocol consisted of T2-weighted STIR and single shot turbo spin echo sequences. For T1 and T1 contrast-enhanced images we employed turbo spin echo sequences with slice thickness of 3 mm, echo train length > 10, minimum echo spacing and minimum TE. Diagnosis of osteomyelitis was based on the detection of one or more of the following findings: subperiosteal fluid, bone sequestrum, fistula and abscess. Results: All MR examinations were of diagnostic quality with minimal artifacts present. In 6 patients one or more of the above mentioned findings were present and were diagnosed with osteomyelitis. In the remaining 11 patients no findings suggestive of osteomyelitis were observed. Confirmation was obtained by followup and clinical outcome. Conclusion: With the use of an optimized scanning protocol MRI may overcome its limitations caused by metallic artifacts and is able to detect foci of osteomyelitis in patients with metallic bone implants.",

Results: Patients included 32 females and 39 males (aged from 9 to 61 years) with pain in extremities. Osteogenic sarcoma was diagnosed in 34 patients, Ewing sarcoma -19, chondrosarcoma -11, bone lymphoma -7. In 7 cases on plain film bone damage wasn't detected. On bone scintigraphy, the majority of lesions showed greater than mild uptake, in 11 cases showed no uptake. At MR imaging isointense or low T1w signal and increased T2w signal was present in all cases. Specific cellular constituents (e.g. fibrous, chondroid, blastic or teleangiectatic components), can modify signal characteristics. Lesions that are primarily blastic, and, therefore, sclerotic on plain film radiographs, demonstrate low signal intensity on both T1-and T2-weighted sequences. Edema characterized by indistinct margins, is a poor indicator of malignancy. Conclusion: Study shows that there is overlap in the radiological appearances of primary malignant bone tumors especially in the early stages. Magnetic resonance imaging is shown to be a useful and sensitive modality in the detection and evaluation of bone tumors. MR imaging accurately assesses soft tissue and synovial involvement, as well as marrow infiltration, which may be radiographically silent. In patients with extremity pain MR imaging is necessary and MRI data wasn't correlated with conventional radiology. All of them were underwent lateral flexion-extension radiography and lumbar MR imaging. Differences of interspinous distances at flexion-extension radiography were analyzed at upper, lower, and spondylolisthetic segments. The MR features of the interspinous ligament were divided into 2 groups according to their signal intensities: Group 1, with inflammatory type presented as high signal intensity at T2-weighted image and low signal intensity at T1-weighted image, and Group 2, fibrotic or fatty type. The incidence of the interspinous ligament with the inflammatory type was analyzed on the spondylolytic segment and the upper and lower segment without spondylolysis, respectively. Results: Spondylolysis at L3, L4 and L5 levels were 3, 30 and 72, respectively. Of 105 patients, the inflammatory type of the interspinous ligament was 25 (24%) on the spondylolisthetic segment and 54 (51%) on the upper segment without spondylolysis (p < 0.05). The mean difference of interspinous distance on the spondylolisthetic segment and the upper segment were 8.4 mm and 10.0 mm, respectively (p < 0.05).",

Matsubara; Hiroshima/JP Purpose: The most common type of scaphoid bone fracture is the transverse fracture of the waist (central 1/3). However, traditional positioning in radiography frequently fails to visualize bone fracture line. This may be caused by the fact that X-rays cannot be irradiated perpendicularly onto the scaphoid long axis. In this study, we searched optimal limb position for visualizing the waist of the scaphoid bone. Method: In 30 volunteers, the scaphoid bone was taken in the ulnoradial direction at 40\u00b0ulnar deviation (group A) and 40\u00b0 ulnar deviation with the fist clenched (group B). Images measured the angle between the cassette plane and long axis of the scaphoid (C-S) and the angle between the cassette plane and the volar tilt (C-V).",

We devised new positioning that lift distal side of forearm upward at about 30\u00b0 in group A, at about 15\u00b0 in group B. These positioning make the long axis parallel to the cassette plane. Especially, the later view was able to visualize the ulna-scaphoid joint more clearly without overlap of radius and scaphoid bones as compared to traditional method. Conclusion: In fractures of the scaphoid, in which early diagnosis is critical, optimization of first-choice X-ray imaging is a key factor, and an additional image involving a 15\u00b0 scaphoid waist view will be useful. Background: MRI imaging is a very powerful tool in the evaluation of the ACL, with higher sensitivity than the clinical examination of the knee. Some of its lesions are well known and easily identifiable, but others require careful interpretation and familiarity with the spectrum of ACL pathology. Over 3000 knee MRI examinations performed in three different diagnostic centers from January 1997 to July 2003 were reviewed retrospectively. ACL lesions were found in approximately 200 knees. Procedure Details: MRI units ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 Tesla, and various imaging protocols were used, with T1 and T2 coronal and sagittal images obtained in all cases. Traumatic tears were the most common lesions identified. Tears were classified as acute or chronic, complete or partial. We illustrate and discuss the primary and secondary findings of ACL tears, as well as the imaging criteria in the evaluation of the postoperative ACL. We also present fractures of the anterior tibial spine with ACL avulsion, ACL ganglion cysts and mucoid degeneration, which are less commonly seen.",

Rutkauskiene; Vilnius/LT Learning Objectives: To illustrate and compare conventional X-ray and ultrasonography diagnostical possibilities of painful shoulder in RA. Background: Up to 60 percent of rheumatoid patients have shoulder pain. A rational decision on the treatment of shoulder disease in rheumatoid arthritis depends on an accurate assessment of its cause and the extent of rheumatoid involvement. Imaging Details: A group of 25 RA patients, who reported a pain in the arm and/ or limitation of the active movement, were examined first with conventional anterioposterior and obligue -outlet -view with 12-15 angulation X-ray of both shoulders. The most common findings were: joint space narrowing, erosions, subchondral cysts, irregularities of greater tuberosity, deformity and flattening, superior migration of humeral head, erosions in acromioclavicular joint, sometimes soft tissues swelling. Ultrasonography study was performed with a 8. Results: Clinical signs and symptoms (pain and swelling) due to foot involvement were present in 3 (13%) of the patients while frequency of involvement was 21 (91%) with MR imaging assessment. The most common involved anatomical region was the hindfoot (83%) following by midfoot (69%) and ankle (22%). The MR imaging findings were bone erosions, Achilles tendinitis, para-articular enthesophyte, joint effusion, plantar fasciitis, joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, soft tissue edema, bone marrow edema, enthesopathy of the Achilles attachment, plantar fascia attachment, and plantar ligament, subchondral edema, retrocalcaneal bursitis, subchondral cysts, subchondral fissures, and bone ankylosis. Conclusion: MR imaging may detect bone, soft tissue, cartilage, tendon, and joint abnormalities in AS patients, even if AS patients did not have clinical signs and symptoms of foot involvement. This imaging modality may be of importance especially early diagnosis of inflammatory changes in the foot. Additionally, familiarity of the typical MR appearances of foot involvement in AS patients may be helpful in narrowing the wide differential diagnosis of spondyloarthropathies.",

Massuet; Sabadell/ES Objective: To evaluate the spectrum of findings for plain-film radiography and other imaging techniques in patients with early or late complications of hip prostheses. We describe the usefulness of each imaging technique in follow-up. Background: Over the last 14 years more than 200 hip replacements have been performed in our hospital annually. All patients are followed up immediately after surgery, at 6 months and then yearly or when necessary, using plain films and sometimes sonography (US) and/or computerized tomography (CT). US and CT are used to confirm or rule out osteointegration of the prosthesis and complications such as periprosthetic abscess and/or hematoma. Imaging Findings: We analyzed radiological features of the normal and pathological evolution of hip prostheses. We describe early complications (affecting 5.2% of patients), such as infection, cement extrusion, and periprosthetic fracture, as well as late complications (affecting 9.2% of patients), including aseptic loosening, osteolytic lesions, heterotopic calcifications, migration of the acetabular component, femoral diaphysis fracture, and dislocation of the prosthesis. Conclusion: Plain films are essential for evaluation and detection of hip arthroplasties. US is usually used to guide percutaneous aspiration of soft tissue. CT enables correct assessment of osteointegration of hip prostheses. Results: With wrist arthroscopy as the standard of reference, average sensitivity and specificity of non-enhanced MRI, for tears of the TFCC were 0.82 and 0.77 respectively and 0.98/0.97/ for arthroscopy. Conclusion: MR imaging-plays a major role in evaluation and management of traumatic wrist injuries, improves clinicians diagnostic accuracy and reduces the need for arthroscopy. These preliminary results illustrate the ability of MRI to assess the integrity of the TFCC and suggests its use as the first imaging method following plain radiography in the evaluation of patients with chronic posttraumatic pain on the ulnar side of the wrist. Wrist arthroscopy is a more valuable technique in determining the location, size, and extent of ligament injuries within the wrist.",

Ultrasonographic criteria of lesion were considered the absent recognition of the ligament and strong echostructural inhomogeneity A-C joint. Measures of A-C and coraco-clavicular (C-C) distances were drawn by means of both methods. Dislocation's degree was defined according with Rockwood's classification. Results: In 6/18 cases of indirect trauma, diastasis of the A-C joint (2-5 mm), was observed, whereas C-C joint was not involved and C-C ligaments were normal.

Schmid; Bochum/DE Purpose: Evaluation of the clinical use of direct MR arthrography of the glenohumeral joint with maximum distension of the joint capsule in patients with glenohumeral instability using a posterior approach. Patients and Methods: Direct MR arthrography of the shoulder joint was performed on a 1.5 T system in 30 patients (12 women, 18 men, mean age 36 years). 17 right and 13 left shoulders were evaluated. All patients had anterior or bidirectional instability (18 posttraumatic, 12 constitutional). Using a fluoroscopically guided posterior approach, 10 mL iopamidol 250 M and 5 mL 0.2% mepivacaine were injected, followed by a 1% dilution of dimeglumine gadopentetate in 0.9% sodium chloride until full capsular stretching was achieved. MR sequences were T1-weighted spin-echo axial and oblique-coronal, fat-saturated T1 3D axial and oblique-coronal, and axial T2 Flash-2D. Results: Arthrography was possible in all patients. The total amount of intraarticularly injected fluid was 30-60 mL (mean 38 mL). No complications occurred. MR imaging showed significant capsule distention in 11 patients (37%) and ventral capsule defects in 5 patients (17%). 14 labral lesions (11 anterior, 3 posterior), 3 bicipital tendon lesions (1 complete, 2 partial ruptures) and 2 partial ruptures of the rotator cuff were noted. 13 patients underwent surgery. Regarding labral lesions, sensitivity of MRI was 88.9%, specificity was 75%, and diagnostic accuracy was 84.6% compared with surgical results. Conclusions: Glenohumeral direct MR arthrography allows accurate detection of labral and tendinous lesions. Maximum capsular distension allowed preoperative evaluation of capsular laxity as a source of shoulder instability.",

Schick; T\u00fcbingen/DE Purpose: Seven different MR sequences were compared to localize cartilage defects in knee and to evaluate the stage of maturation of the hyaline cartilage graft. Methods: MRT was performed in 19 patients aged 17-48 years with autologous transplantation of a hyaline cartilage tissue graft after a knee trauma. Examination dates were: before transplantation to localize the defect, and 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months after transplantation to control the morphology and the maturation of the autologous graft. Standard T2-and proton-density weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) sequences, T1-weighted spin echo (SE) sequences, gradient echo (GRE) sequences with and without magnetization transfer (MT) pulses as well as experimental diffusion weighted GRE sequences (PSIF) were used. Results: For depiction of the graft short time after surgery T2-weighted TSEsequences showed the best results, to identify potential secondary damages before transplantation PD weighted sequences were superior. 6 and 12 months after transplantation spoiled 3D-GRE-sequences displayed the graft in high spatial resolution. From the diffusion measurements no statistically significant discrimination between cartilage and graft was obtained at any time, whereas, different images from GRE-sequences with and without MT pulse provided high contrast between cartilage and surrounding tissue. The quantification of the MT effect showed an assimilation of the graft to the original cartilage within 12 months. Conclusion: MRT should be performed before every transplantation because cartilage defects and secondary damages can be detected clearly. After transplantation MRT can easily identify the graft and detect hypertrophy or debonding in early stage.",

Buckland-Wright 1 ; 1 London/UK, 2 Loughborough/UK Purpose: Fractal Signature Analysis (FSA), a computerised method of textural analysis, permits the separate measurement of changes in vertical and horizontal trabeculae based on the fractal dimension over a range of trabecular widths (fractal signature). We determined whether the FSA of high definition macroradiographs (X5 magnification) quantified differences in trabecular organisation at sites of osteopenia and erosion formation in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) hand. Methods: Sixty-seven RA patients had macroradiographs of the left hand. The distal radius was scored and grouped from very mild (RA1) to moderate (RA4) disease. Macroradiographs were digitised and FSA of horizontal and vertical trabecular organisation were measured in the radius at sites of osteopenia, erosion formation and a mid-shaft site. The fractal signatures were compared to 11 healthy non-arthritic subjects using the t-test. Results: Compared to the non-arthritics, FSA at the distal radius in groups RA1 to RA4 measured a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in fractal signature at the osteopenic and mid-shaft sites, affecting small to large sized vertical trabeculae, and at the erosion site, involving small and medium sized horizontal and vertical trabeculae. The reduction was smallest in RA1 and greatest in RA4. Conclusion: FSA quantified the trabecular bone loss in the distal radius of RA patients of increasing radiographic severity based on a proportional reduction in fractal signature. Disease related bone loss involved varying trabecular widths with vertical trabeculae at the osteopenic site and both vertical and horizontal trabeculae at the erosion site. Potentially, FSA can distinguish changes consequent to bone-mediated RA drug treatment.",

Conclusion: Use of MPR and SSD in CT data postprocessing allows establishing the type of acetabular fractures that defines a choice of treatment tactics. Our standard protocol of MPR and SSD reduces analysis time of research results and creates conditions for uniform perception of injuries by all participants of diagnostic process. Conclusion: Routine X-ray projections prove insufficient to establish a diagnosis in 1/5 th of the cases. Confusion is caused by overlaying of fracture edges and pelvic bone in the direction of X-ray beams. The latter makes hardly visible the small posterior fragment, too.

To describe the MRI findings for lipomas and liposarcomas. To develop the principles of percutaneous biopsy. Background: Differential diagnosis between lipomas and liposarcomas, especially atypical lipomas is not always easy. Despite similarities, differential diagnosis can be reliably established employing image parameters. Nevertheless, the staging process of STLM culminates in biopsies, allowing to manage the proper treatment. Biopsies can be performed percutaneously using imaging guidance. An open biopsy with the resection of the entire mass is disputed when the STLM is composed essentially of fat on MRI imaging to avoid the misdiagnosis of benign lipoma. Each procedure must be carefully planned: an inadequate biopsy may fail to allow proper diagnosis, have a negative impact on survival, and ultimately necessitate an amputation to accomplish adequate margins of resection. Procedure Details: After the description of characteristics and different histological subtypes of lipomas and liposarcomas, we will describe the MRI findings for each diagnosis, according to a review of the litterature by illustrating with MRI imaging of patients followed in our center. We will develop the principles of percutaneous biopsies according to litterature and our experience.

Background: The patients with inflammatory myopathies (inclusion-body myositis (IBM) = 4, polymyositis (PM) = 3 and dermatomyositis (DM) = 1) underwent whole-body MR muscle screening examination. MR examination is performed at six different levels: neck, shoulder, abdomen, pelvic girdle, and upper and lower leg. T1-and T2-weighted images with and without fat suppression were performed for each level. Signal intensity of muscles, volume and the symmetry of involvement were quantified in 54 individual muscles on each side. Imaging Findings: IBM, DM and PM are rare diseases with clinical and histopathological similarities. IBM usually does not respond to immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish these entities correctly. IBM is characterized by more frequent fatty infiltration, atrophy, inflammation, a distal predominance, and anterior group involvement. The finding of selective involvement of the medial gastrocnemius and of the vasti with sparing of rectus femoris is typical for sporadic IBM. The selective involvement of flexor digitorum profundus is also highly suggestive for IBM. T1, T2 and fat-sat images contain different but complimentary information.

Background: Elastofibroma dorsi is a rare, typically slow-growing, often bilateral, para-neoplastic formation. It's composed by fibro-elastic and adipose tissue and is selectively localized along the postero-lateral side of thoracic wall, under the scapula. The certain diagnosis is cyto-histological. MRI was the hitherto elective diagnosis. All cases of elastofibroma in our series were studied with US; some of them also with CT and MRI; in a retrospective analysis US allowed to suspect presence of elastofibroma in all patients: 3 of them underwent surgery that confirmed the diagnosis. Procedure Details: In our series the US examination, performed with 7.5-10 MHz linear probe, showed solid masses, sometimes in both sides, with badly visible margins, hypoechoic with inside hyperechoic stripes, obliquous from the transducer plan. Conclusions: In all cases US and clinical findings allowed the diagnosis of elastofibroma dorsi. The MRI, performed in 3 patients that underwent surgery, confirmed the US findings. The remaining 2 patients are undergoing follow-up with US. So, US findings, within site, slow growth and possible presence of bilateral masses, allow the diagnosis of elastofibroma dorsi, avoiding costly MRI.",

De Simone, C. Pagliarello, M. Politi; Rome/IT Purpose: Psoriasis is often associated with Achilles enthesopathy. This study compares the efficacy of Ultrasound, Echo-Color-Doppler and MRI in the evaluation of early signs of Achilles enthesopathy in psoriatic patients. Methods and Materials: 22 consecutive psoriatic patients, 17 men, 5 women, mean age 48 years (age range 19-72), mean PASI score 14, entered the study. All patients underwent sonography of the Achilles tendon and peritendinous structures with Aplio (Toshiba) equipped with a linear multifrequence (8-13 Mhz) transducer; the study was completed with Color-Doppler analysis. An MRI study, before and after gadolinium, was then performed using E-Scan XQ (Esaote), 0.2 Tesla superconducting magnet. Axial and sagittal T1 and T2 weighted, sagittal GE and STIR sequences were obtained. After gadolinium, axial and sagittal T1 weighted sequences were obtained. Results: The more frequent US findings were microcalcifications inside the Achilles tendon (27% of cases) and signs of bursitis (27%), while uncommon there were degenerative lesions and signs of peritendinitis. Completion with Echo-Color-Doppler did not add significant data to US study. MRI imaging showed degenerative lesions and peritendinitis as well as US, but was not able to identify any microcalcification. All the alterations were identified in the basal study; administration of gadolinium did not allow any additional pathological finding. Conclusion: Our preliminary results show that MRI, especially with low magnetic field, is not sensitive compared to US in detecting early changes of Achilles enthesopathy in psoriatic patients, while Echo-Color-Doppler and enhanced MRI sequences had limited utility in diagnostic imaging of early stages of this pathology.",

This study aimed to evaluate the application potential of US and MRI performance in detection of these lesions. Material and Method: 7 patient with palpable nodules suspected plantar fibromatosis were evaluated. The US examination was performed by means of a high resolution transducer through tranverse and longitudinal scans along with evaluation of intra-nodular vascularization by power-Doppler. MRI was performed by means of a 1.5 T unit with axial and sagittal planes. T1 weighted MRI images after administration of iv contrast medium were acquired from two patients. Results: 11 nodules were, overall, detected, most of them located in the medial plantar fascia. All nodules were oval-shaped, hypoechoic at US and hypointense at MRI. Considering number and size of nodules, US and MRI overlapped (were strikingly similar). Moreover, nodules showed hypervascularization at power-Doppler, confirmed at MRI with paramagnetic contrast medium. This pattern might suggest a different pathoanatomical condition of these lesions, as hypervascularization is a sign of an early stage lesion, featuring a large fibrovascular proliferation. No correlation was found between vascularization degree and symptoms the latter resulting from the neurovascular structures disorder. Conclusions: US associated with power-Doppler is the first choice method in the evaluation of plantar fibromatosis, able to detect number, size and activity pattern of nodules, leading to a pre-surgery diagnosis. In severe plantar fibromatosis MR is to be considered a complementary method in evaluation of the extent. Purpose: Conventional MRI is a well-accepted technique in evaluating soft tissue tumors. However it is not specific in differentiating benign and malignant lesions. In this study the differential value of the dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) was investigated. Methods and Materials: Turbo FLASH DCE-MRI was performed on 27 subjects (2-74 yrs) with soft tissue tumors. Enhancement in the 1 st min (E1), 2 nd min (E2), maximum enhancement (Emax), and time-signal intensity curve (TIC) slopes were calculated. Discriminant analyses were performed to reveal parametric differences of the benign and malignant lesions. Results: Histopathological diagnosis of benign (N = 9) tumors were hemangioma (n = 3), neurogenic tumor (n = 3) lipoma (n = 2) and desmoid (n = 1), whereas malignant lesions (N = 18) were classified as liposarcoma (n = 5), osteosarcoma with soft tissue component (n = 5), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (n = 5), synovial sarcoma (n = 2) and giant cell tumor (n = 1). For malignant lesions mean values for E1, E2 and Emax were 98%, 102%, and 119%, respectively. Mean TIC slope was 2.75. For benign lesions the above mentioned values were 43%, 66%, 76%, and 1.43, respectively. ANOVA based discriminant analysis was correctly classified 74% of the lesions to benign and malignant groups using E1, 78% of the lesions using E2 or Emax, and 82% of the lesions using TIC slope. The combination of the above mentioned parameters had resulted a 93% accuracy (p < 0.001). Conclusion: DCE-MRI parameters are the surrogate markers of tumoral microcirculation and tissue perfusion. These parameters may be used as key factors when deciding proper treatment alternatives and to reveal malignant transformations.",

Lagalla; Palermo/IT Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of MR to depict spring ligament (SL) and to visualize its chronic abnormalities even when associated to injury of the posterior tibial tendon (PTT). Materials and Methods: MR images from 185 patients (102 female and 83 male; age range 35-62 years), with clinical suspect of injury of the PTT, were retrospectively examined for SL normal appearance and abnormalities. All exams were performed by a 0.5 T MR using T1 weighted spin-echo and T2 weighted fast spinecho sequences on the axial plane.10 asymptomatic control patients (7 female and 3 male; age range 33 -63 years), were examined in the same interval time using T1 weighted spin-echo and T2 weighted fast spin-echo sequences on an oblique plane (45\u00b0), parallel to SL. We evaluated if SL was totally or partially visualized, SL thickness and signal intensity. Results: In all control patients SL was completely visualized, 4-5 mm thick and homogenously hypointense. 120/185 patients had injury of PTT. Among these 120 patients SL was visualized in its medial portion in 78 patients of which 56 had chronic abnormalities of LS. At standard MR examination was not possible to visualize the inferior portion of SL in almost all 185 patients. Conclusions: MR seems to be an important diagnostic technique to evaluate SL abnormalities. The high association of SL lesions with PTT injury has to be known and considered when studying patients with proved advanced PTT injury in order to plan correctly the MR study to SL whole examination.",

Results: Ultrasonography found multiple anechoic and hypoechoic cystic lesions (n = 10), necrozing tumor-like lesion (n = 1). CT scan showed evidence of multivesicular cysts in all cases. MRI showed typical liquid lesions (n = 3), heterogenous signal due to scraps (n = 1) and evaluate accurately the extent of involvement. Conclusion: In our experience multivesicular cysts is the main lesion showed in primitive hydatidosis soft tissue. Ultrasound is still in routine relevant to detect muscular hydatidosis; CT scan and MRI confirme the diagnosis and are helpful to demonstrate the relation between cysts and adjacent structures and evaluate extent of involvement before surgical management. Results: 115 MRI showed degenerative signs. In 30% disc enhancement was peripheral, parallel to the end plates.The disk enhancement was at L4-L5 in 35% and L5-S1 in 47%. It was found in 86% of end plates inflammation and in 88% of fatty changes. It was found in 6% of stage II and IIIA normal or earlier degenerative stages, 21% of stage IIIB and 57% of IV stage latter degenerative stages. 10 biopsies were performed avoiding disc infection. 5 of the 15 MRI of patients with ankylosing spondylitis showed large contrast enhancement parallel to the end plates without end plates inflammation. 10 MRI of operated patients showed linear uptake parallel to end plates associated with enhancement in the posterior part of operated disc. 10 MRI of patient with infectious spondylitis showed central disk enhancement with end plates inflammation in 100% and vertebral abscess in 50%. Conclusion: Disc enhancement parallel to end plate is a disc degenerative sign in operated and non-operated disc. It may be present in inflammatory conditions as ankylosing spondylitis. Central disk enhancement appears to be an infection sign.",

All patients were female and reported being pregnant in the year preceding the diagnosis. Three had delivered by caesarean section. The ultrasound examination were performed with a 12-5 MHz multifrequency transducer. MRI imaging employed TSE-T1w sequences with and without gadolinium, and TSE-T2w sequences with and without fat suppression. Results: In the cases of EADT ultrasonography showed solid homogeneous masses, slightly hypoechogenic compared to the adjacent fibromuscular structures. In the 5 anterior abdominal wall cases, the margins were clearly identified on a transversal plane but spiculated and irregular along the longitudinal plane in 3 out 5 cases. The large perineal lesion (diameter 6 cm) appeared dyshomogenous, but margins were regular and clearly identifiable. At Color Doppler exami-nation, all lesions showed a rich vascularisation. MRI confirmed the fibrous nature of the lesions and helped in the differential diagnosis with endometriosis.

Laredo 2 ; 1 Le Kremlin-Bic\u00eatre/FR, 2 Paris/FR Learning Objectives: To illustrate the clinical, radiological and histological spectrum of findings in Erdheim-Chester disease. To be able to recognise the disease in a patient with elementary symptoms. To describe the imaging modalities that are necessary for a precise staging of the disease. Background: Erdheim-Chester disease is a multisystemic histiocytosis associated with characteristic skeletal abnormalities. Bone (bone pain), skin (xanthomas), orbits (exophthalmos), pituitary gland (diabetes insipitus), retroperitoneum (hydronephrosis) and lungs may be affected by the disease. The relashionship of the disease with Langerhans cell histiocytosis is still unclear. Seventeen patients with Erdheim-Chester disease were evaluated between 1990 and 2001, using conventional X-rays, US, CT, bone scintigraphy and MRI. Radiological-pathological correlations were available in 15 cases. Imaging Findings: Osteosclerosis of long bones in lower limbs is the most common feature (15/17 cases) and should be a trigger for the diagnosis. MRI demonstrates replacement of the high signal of the bone marrow by a decreased signal on T1 and T2-weighted images. Atypical osseous manifestations include involvement of ribs, skull and pelvis; focal lytic lesions are seldom encountered (3/17). Visceral involvement may affect pituitary gland, orbits, pericardium, lungs, kidneys and retroperitoneum. Pathologic study shows accumulation of lipid-laden histiocytes and fibrosis. Conclusion: Bone lesions are rather specific and should suggest the diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease. Detection of visceral involvement, sometimes asymptomatic, requires imaging of brain, lung and retroperitoneum. Histological analysis is necessary to assess the diagnosis and differentiate the disease from other cases of histiocytosis, especially Langerhans cell histiocytosis.",

These were: i) minor and slow decrease in size in the pt with the longest follow-up, following a transient initial increase in size, which was seen in all pts; ii) hypodensity of lesions on T1w images and hyperintensity on T2w images; iii) hypovasculature of lesions on contrast-enhanced T1w images in comparison to baseline assessment. Conclusion: Actual responsiveness of chordomas to molecular-targeted therapy with Imatinib mesylate is left to be determined. However, preliminary observations suggest that MRI may be useful to assess tumor response. Signs of response may be subtle, likely depending on changes in tumor tissue rather than (or before) decrease in size.",

Background: Groin pain is a common complaint in athletes, particularly prevalent among soccer players. This condition is frequently multifactorial, and the differential diagnosis can cover a rather broad area of entities, mainly involving adductor muscle and tendinous group, pubic bone even inguinal hernia. Between January 1998 and August 2003, 90 athletes with groin pain were examined at our institution. The MRI findings of the possible causes of groin pain in athletes are described and illustrated. Imaging Findings: The examinations were performed in a 1 Tesla imaging system (Magnetom Impact Expert, SIEMENS) with a surface coil. T1-weighted spin echo and T2-weighted fat suppressed turbo spin echo images were obtained in axial plane; STIR a T2-weighted turbo spin echo sequences were performed in coronal plane. The pathological findings observed were: osteitis pubis, stress fracture of pubic bone, muscle tears (adductor, obturator, rectus abdominis, pectineus, iliopsoas, gracilis and rectus femoris groups), abdomino fascial abnormalities, inguinal hernia, bursitis and inflammation conditions of the spermatic cord. Conclusion: MRI depicts adequately the numerous pathologic entities related to groin pain in athletes.",

Modern aseptic technique, in addition to the use of antibiotic-coated prostheses, have dramatically reduced the incidence of such infection. Aggressive antibiotic suppression is effective in fewer than 30% of cases, the remainder requiring removal of the infected prosthesis, with associated morbidity, and occasionally, mortality. Clinical signs and symptoms are frequently non-specific, including lethargy, pyrexia and anorexia. It is for this reason that quite often the task of locating a causative factor relies upon the expertise of the radiologist. Imaging: Using a pictorial review we depict the numerous pitfalls in the radiological diagnosis of prosthetic and endovascular graft infections. In addition, a guide to radiological imaging of less frequently encountered infections, such as those of breast and penile prostheses, ventriculo-peritoneal shunts, intra-ocular lens, cardiac pacemakers and valves, will be provided. The limitations and benefits of Conventional Radiography, Digital Subtraction Angiography, Computed Tomography, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Radio-isotope Scintigraphy with respect to the site of infection will be explored in turn.",

Recently, radio-frequency heating of inter vertebral disc has been proposed, as an alternative to surgery. We propose here a new method of discal radiofrequency in which heated water is used to spread the thermal energy. Materials and Methods: Seventeen patients were included prospectively according to the criteria used in previous intra discal radiofrequency studies. The catheter is placed in the nucleus and heated water is used as thermal conductor to burn the annulus nociceptors. Intra discal pressure and impedance measurements were used to control the energy delivered during the procedure. Clinical results were evaluated by the Oswestry score. The treatment was scored as a success with at least a 50% pain reduction on global perceived effect on Oswestry score.",

Karabulut; Denizli/TR Purpose: To determine the value of presence of calcaneal spur in evaluating painful heels. Materials and Methods: 145 heels of 66 female and 11 male patients with a mean age of 45.7 \u00b1 9.8 years and mean body mass index (BMI) of 35.0 \u00b1 10.5 complaining of bilateral (n = 68) and unilateral (n = 9) heel pain were studied. Lateral radiographs of the 145 symptomatic and 163 asymptomatic heels were obtained to assess presence of calcaneal spur. MR imaging of the symptomatic heels was performed using 1.5 T superconductive system. The images were taken and reviewed for presence of plantar fasciitis (PF). Heel pad thickness was also measured. Results: Calcaneal spur was seen in 72 of 145 (49%) symptomatic and in 13 of 163 (7.9%) of asymptomatic heels. MR has revealed PF in 68 of 145 (46.9%) painful heels and calcaneal spur was present in 53 of the cases with PF. Calcaneal spur was significantly correlated with weight (P < 0.001), BMI (P < 0.001), age (P = 0.029), heel pain duration (P = 0.003) and PF (P < 0.0001). No correlation was seen between calcaneal spur and both height and heel fat pad. Conclusion: Although calcaneal spur is not the cause of pain, it may provide an objective assessment of the changes due to chronic repeatitive trauma to plantar fascia secondary to obesity or age. On the other hand foot radiography should be part of the initial diagnostic methods as it helps in excluding different causes of heel pain.",

All patients also were checked with MRI. In transabdominal ultrasonographic examination, compression of abdominal wall and inner contents were done. After this, we observed closely the contour of body, the height of body, disc height, and paraspinal lesion. Results: In 50 patients, there were 1) compression fractures or burst fractures; 23 patients, 2) spondylitis; 7 patients, 3) bone tumorous condition; 2 patients, 4) abscess formations in paraspinal muscle; 3 patients, 5) ankylosing spondylitis; 1 patient, and 6) disc herniation; 14 patients. In these patients, transabdominal ultrasonographic findings were relatively correlated with MR findings, but lesions in posterior and middle elements of spine could not be evaluated with transabdominal ultrasonographic approach. Conclusion: Despite of many limitations of transabdominal ultrasonographic examination for detection of spine and paraspinal lesion, when spine and paraspinal structures or lesion are visible on transabdominal ultrasonography, ultrasonography suggested to be a screening method in patients with back pain. In particular, ultrasonography was superior to MRI in detecting the minimal change of anterior disc, prediscal space, or anterior longitudinal ligament of spine.",

Colosimo; Rome/IT Dural sinus thromboses (DST) are not extremely rare, they still account for 5% of ictus in young adults. They need an accurate diagnosis at the onset of symptoms, and during the follow-up, to reduce the risks related to prolonged thrombolytic therapy. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and, in the last years, phase contrast MR angiography (PC MRA) with conventional MR sequences have become the methods of choice for DST diagnosis. Our purpose was to evaluate the usefulness of gadolinium-enhanced ultrafast MRA (GE-UF MRA), routinely employed in supra-aortic vessel evaluation, in the diagnosis and follow-up of DST. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 12 patients with diagnosis of DST, studied using 1.5 T magnet, conventional SE, TSE and GE-UF MRA sequences. We could compare GE-UF MRA images with DSA in 3 patients and PC MRA in 5 patients. Results: In all 3 DSA controlled patients, we found a complete agreement between GE-UF MRA and DSA concerning location and extent of DST. In all 5 patients with both GE-UF and PC MRA, the overall DST diagnosis was identical, even if the diagnosis of minimal dural sinus involvement was easily and definitively assessed with UF-GE MRA, which allows a superior diagnosis confidence. Conclusions: Our preliminary experience suggests that GE-UF MRA is a very fast modality, is easily obtained and analyzed and has a superior diagnostic confidence compared to PC MRA. In our opinion GE-UF MRA should be proposed as the primary diagnostic tool in the recognition and follow-up of DST.",

This facilitates decisions on the need for further imaging modalities. Background: Vascular dementia represents a very heterogeneous diagnostic category. Utilizing the NINDS-AIREN criteria and a centralized imaging rater to determine eligibility for enrollment in recent large-scale clinical trials testing new treatments for vascular dementia has provided increased consistency in the diagnosis of VaD. The diagnostic criteria for probable vascular dementia include the development of dementia temporally related to stroke with neuroimaging confirmation. The criteria include a table listing brain imaging lesions associated with vascular dementia. In this study, 520 patients have been screened for the presence of cerebro-vascular disease using brain CT or MRI. Imaging Findings: The wide spectrum of neuroradiological features that are associated with VaD may result from cerebral small-vessel disease with extensive leukoencephalopathy or lacunes (basal ganglia or frontal white matter), or may be the consequence of single strategically located infarcts or multiple infarcts in large-vessel territories. It may also be the consequence of global cerebral hypoperfusion, intracerebral hemorrhage or other mechanisms such as genetically determined arteriopathies. Conclusion: Neuroimaging is required for confirmation of cerebrovascular disease in VaD and provides information about the topography and severity of vascular lesions. Neuroimaging may also assist with the differential diagnosis of dementia associated with normal pressure hydrocephalus, chronic subdural hematoma, arteriovenous malformation or tumoral diseases.",

The role of imaging in differentiating a variety of conditions that may cause the above neurologic symptoms is very important. Morphology and patterns of cerebral lesions also enables an assessment of the pathophysiology and hemodynamics of brain complications after cardiac surgery. We retrospectively reviewed the brain CT images of 94 symptomatic patients, who previously had cardiac surgery performed. Imaging Findings: A variety of common and uncommon findings on CT and MR images of neurologic complications after cardiac surgery are illustrated. Acute infarctions involving a vascular territory, hemorrhagic infarctions, multiple infarctions, watershed infarctions, bilateral infarctions, braistem and cerebellar infarctions, uncal herniation, brain edema and inflammatory processes are depicted.

Laxanis; Athens/GR Learning Objectives: To illustrate the MRI, MRA and angiographic findings of an ethmoidal dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in the anterior cranial fossa. Background: Ethmoidal AVFs are rare vascular anomalies. Only 129 cases have been presented since 1963, when they were first described by Lepoire. They can be either congenital or acquired lesions. Ethmoidal arteries are the main feeding vessels. The vast majority drain to the superior sagittal sinus and to the cavernous sinus. The presenting symptom is intracranial hemorrhage, mostly subarachnoid or intracerebral. Their propensity for hemorrhage justifies immediate surgical removal of the lesion. Imaging Findings: An MRI scan was performed demonstrating an abnormal region of signal void, suggesting a vascular anomaly involving the base of the left frontal lobe. For further evaluation, the patient underwent an MRA examination. A vascular linear lesion, probably a vein, at the base of the left frontal lobe and enlargement mainly of the left, as well as of the right ocular artery was discovered. A digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed and an EDAF on the left ciribriform plate supplied by bilateral ethmoidal arteries was revealed. It drained via a dilated abnormal vein to the left vein of Galen. So far, only one other case has ever been reported with venous drainage to the vein of Galen. Conclusion: Specific MRI and MRA imaging findings should arouse the suspicion of an EDAF and DSA can effectively demonstrate the nidus of the lesion, as well as the feeding and draining vessels and confirm the diagnosis.",

In this case study, functional magnetic resonance imaging was employed to image blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect changes in the temporal lobes under TMS-therapy. Methods: In a curative attempt, a 30-year old schizophrenic patient (DSM-IV) with medication resistent acoustic hallucinations was treated with low-frequency TMS (fstim = 1 Hz) over a four week period. fMRI was performed in a 1.5 T clinical scanner using the standard head coil and a GE-EPI sequence. The TMSeffects were detected based on the event related BOLD-fMRI of auditory hallucination and auditory hallucinations rating scale. FMRI was performed prior to and after the TMS series to visualize possible cortical activation changes in the stimulated area. Data analyses were performed with SPM99 (http:// fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk.spm). Results: After the third week, the patient presented a reduced frequency of acoustic hallucinations of approx. 50%, while the loudness of the hallucinations remained unchanged over the 4 weeks of stimulation. fMRI demonstrated a BOLD effect activation reduction after TMS in speech related areas, which exceeded the local stimulation area. Discussion: fMRI data revealed an activation reduction in temporal and temporo-parietal areas after TMS corresponding to the clinical recovery. The combination of TMS and functional imaging is promising, allowing an insight into neuro-biological mechanisms during TMS intervention, which may help to improve treatment success.",

Background: Six Mandarin speakers and skilled readers of Chinese participated in this study. All the subjects were right handed. Experiments were performed on GE MRI scanner at the Huashang Hospital. Sixteen slices covering the whole brain were collected with blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) sequence. The anatomical images were obtained in the transverse plane during the same scan session with 3D FSPGR sequence after the functional measurements. The four types of stimuli were distributed equally in two main conditions i.e. Chinese and Pinyin. In each condition, half stimuli were words and half were non-words. Data analysis was carried out using FEAT, the FMRIB Easy Analysis Tool, an extension of MEDX. Imaging Findings: The activations in the right inferior frontal gyrus, the left fusiform gyrus, the bilateral cuneus and the bilateral superior frontal gyrus were stronger for Chinese character reading than for pinyin reading. The activations in the bilateral supramarginal gyus, the bilateral superior parietal gyrus and the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, however, were stronger for pinyin reading than for Chinese character reading. Different parts of the middle temporal gyrus were also activated for reading these two scripts. The low hemispheric lateralisation for both Chinese character and pinyin reading indicate an important role for both hemispheres in reading. Conclusion: fMRI is one of the best methods of illustrating difference of brain activations during alphabetic and non-alphabetic reading.",

Renowden; Bristol/UK Learning Objectives: To illustrate typical MRI appearances of the brain of patients with inborn errors of metabolism and toxic inherited white matter disease. A simple algorithm to unravel the possible cause of imaging findings is incorporated as part of this presentation. Background: The diagnosis of a neurometabolic disease is usually suggested by clinical history and physical findings and is confirmed by appropriate special studies, which may include neuroradiological investigations. When the patient is referred with a nonspecific diagnosis, such as delayed development, the aim is to suggest the possibility of a neurometabolic disorder and initiate further evaluation including possible therapy and genetic counselling. On occasion, routine neuroradiological studies may incidentally produce results suggestive of a neurometabolic disorder. Imaging Findings: Disorders including glutaric aciduria, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, Leigh's encephalopathy, maple syrup urine disease, methylmalonic aciduria, adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe's leukodystrophy and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease are illustrated. A pattern approach based on which part of the brain is affected is used to provide an aid to the diagnosis. Conclusion: Magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role in the identification, localisation and characterisation of underlying white matter abnormalities in affected patients and is also extensively used to monitor the natural progression of such disorders and the response to therapy. Background: To compare 3D-DSA with 2D-DSA and 3D multi-detector CT angiography (CTA) with VRT in the detection and evaluation of intracranial aneurysms.

Shuguang; Shanghai/CN Learning Objectives: To describe the MRI character of cerebral sparganosis. Background: The cases of cerebral sparganosis have shown a trend of increased frequency with the change of eating habits, especially eating under-cooked products of snake or frog. There is sparse literature available which illustrates nonspecific findings of cerebral sparganosis in MRI including nodular lesions, white matter degenerations or haemorrhages. MR imaging of six patients with cerebral sparganosis were reviewed retrospectively in our exhibit. Imaging Findings: All six cases of cerebral sparganosis showed a single lesion. The location of lesions were superficial with three in the parietal lobe, one in the frontal lobe, one in the temporal lobe and one in the posterior part of brain stem. Five lesions were irregular in shape and about 3 cm diameter with moderate hypointensity on T1WI and hyperintensity on T2WI. A presenting feature of the parasitic granuloma was a \"string-knot shape\" enhancement, which was demonstrated in 5 cases. One case showed a cystic lesion with peripheral enhancement. There was slight hyperintensity surrounding the nodular lesions which corresponded to edema. No white matter degenerations or hemorrhages were revealed which had been described by previous studies. Diagnosis of sparganosis was made on the basis of characteristic enhancement in MRI for 5 cases and one was diagnosed as parasitic infectious disease. During surgery, live larvas of sparganum were successfully removed in five cases with \"string-knot shape\" enhancement lesions. In the case with a cystic lesion, only fragments of worm body were obtained. Conclusion: \"String-knot shape\" enhancement is a characteristic MRI finding which has a high value in diagnosis of cerebral sparganosis.",

MRS has been applied to distinguish brain tumors from other diseases and is available on many clinical scanners. Post-processing of single-voxel and multi-voxel studies may be presented either as metabolic spectra or parametric maps in the latter. Imaging Findings: In brain tumours, there is elevation of choline (a marker of cell membrane turnover) and decreased N-acetyl aspartate (a neuronal marker) and creatine (an energy substance). Lactate and mobile lipids are sometimes present. Conversely, non-neoplastic lesions typically do not show increased choline. Lactate is sometimes detected in ischemia, abscess and demyelination. Toxoplasmosis and tuberculomas typically show a dominant lipid peak. Bacterial breakdown products including acetate, alanine and succinate are detected in abscesses. Occasionally, increased cellular infiltrates and reactive astrogliosis may result in elevated choline levels, mimicking tumour. Conclusion: With increasing clinical application of MRS, radiologists should be familiar with common spectral patterns of brain disease as well as the potential pitfalls in interpretation.",

Mercader; Barcelona/ES Learning Objectives: To describe some aspects of brain iron metabolism which can be studied by MRI. To learn how decreased signal intensity on T2-W images in the basal ganglia can be seen in several white matter disorders. Background: The iron is taken up by capillary endothelial cells in basal ganglia and then is transported axonally to projection sites where it is used in local metabolism, there the iron is stored in oligodendroglia cells. Interruption of normal axonal transportation of iron caused by white matter abnormality might lead to increased accumulation of iron at the basal ganglia since it could still be taken up but not be transported. It is generally accepted that there is a correlation between the accumulation of iron in the extrapyramidal system and the degree of hypointensity observed at this site on T2-weighted images. Imaging Findings: Low signal intensity on T2-W images were observed in the basal ganglia in 14 patients with different white matter disorders (congenital, multiple sclerosis, postradiation toxicity, ischemia, AIDS-related and tumoral). MR studies were performed with a 1.5 T scanner. Conclusion: Decreased signal intensity on T2-W images in the basal ganglia can be seen in several white matter disorders.",

            "text": "Typical Background: Wernicke Encephalopathy (WE) is a severe neurologic disorder caused by thiamine deficiency related to malnutrition or malabsorption of B1 vitamin that occurs mainly, but not exclusively, in alcoholic patients. We reviewed the risk factors as well as the usual and unusual clinico-radiological features including two cases in non-alcoholic patients (one with gastroesophageal reflux and other with pyloric stenosis secondary to biliogastric reflux). A third of patients with acute WE present with the classic clinical triad: opthalmoplegia, ataxia and confusion. Other initial manifestations are hypothermia, hypotension, coma, nutritional polyneuropathy, cardiovascular involvement. Early diagnosis is crucial because of non-specific clinical findings, a high mortality rate but a possible complete recovery with immediate thiamine replacement. Imaging Findings: Typical MR findings include symmetrical signal changes in medial thalami, tectum and periaqueductal region. In the acute stage, enhancement after contrast injection may be visible in these regions as well as in the mamillary bodies, but at chronic stages atrophy is the main finding. Atypical features described include signal changes in the cerebellum, dentate nuclei, pons, red nuclei, basal ganglia and central and precentral sulci. Massive haemorrhages are rare whereas microscopic foci are frequent. Differential diagnosis includes de/dysmyelinating disorders, infarctions and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Variant but symmetrical distribution of findings rules out most of them. Conclusion: WE is a reversible, severe disorder and a high index of suspicion is recommended to diagnose it, even in non-alcoholic patients. To determine whether functional MR imaging sequences (diffusion tensor, tractography, perfusion, spectroscopy, blood oxygenation level dependent-BOLD), can help add new information to the pre-surgery approach to brain tumors. To determine the efficiency and efficacy of these news tools in evaluating brain tumors. During the period of 6 months, MR exams of 25 patients with brain tumors (17 men, 8 women; mean age 47.5years) were performed in a 1.5 T clinical scanner (Siemens, Germany) , using MR clinical standard protocol and functional sequences (diffusion tensor imaging, perfusion, spectroscopy and BOLD sequence). All the patients had their histopathology diagnosis confirmed by brain biopsy and surgery; glioblastoma multiforme (n = 9), anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 6), low grade glioma (n = 6), gliomatosis cerebri (n = 1) and metastases (n = 3). High grade glioma and metastases had hyperperfusion, high picks of choline and low N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Low grade glioma and gliomatosis cerebri had low relative cerebral blood volume, low NAA, high choline and myoinositol. Diffusion tensor imaging showed alterations of the main tracts within and nearest the high grade tumors. Low grade tumors had main tracts dislocated but not interrupted. The white mater tract were preserved in gliomatosis cerebri. BOLD sequence identified the sensory-motor and language activating areas. MR imaging has been used to evaluate brain tumors. With new neuroimaging advanced tools, we can do this analysis in a more accurate and precise way and it takes less time than it was thought to. It is a huge contribution to the evaluation and management of patients, providing a type of diagnosis close to histopathology diagnosis.",

During retrieval of abstract words we observed an increase of left FPPFC interactions, while right DLPFC showed no interactions. Memory performance was higher for pictures vs words. Conclusion: Firstly, our results support the idea of a common bilateral PFC involvement across different stimuli and mnemonic operations.

Material and Methods: Twenty subjects affected by idiopathic PD according with the Brain Bank Criteria were enrolled for this study. Nineteen normal subjects were included as controls. Ten of them performed a retest procedure. PD patients, after at least 20 days of therapy withdrawal, were submitted to perfusion DSC-MRI. Sixteen of them were retested after apomorphine injection at least 24 hours. Relative regional blood flow was evaluated by using regions of interest (ROI) of 50 pixels manually placed in different region of basal ganglia. Results: PD patients showed a significant inter-hemispheric asymmetry due to a higher perfusion in the more affected side (< 0.01), while normal subjects did not. PD exhibited an abnormal \"asymmetry index\" in the measured nuclei. DSC-MRI performed after subcutaneous apomorphine injection did not show any significant asymmetry in PD patients. Retest in normal subjects did not show any significant variation.

Vassiou 2 , M. Vlychou 2 , P.J. Papadaki 1 , G.M. Zavras 1 , J.B. Fezoulidis 2 ; 1 Athens/GR, 2 Larissa/GR Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of spiral CT angiography in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to vascular malformations. Methods and Material: One hundred and fifty-eight patients suffering from subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) underwent CT angiography (CTA) as well as intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA). CTA was performed using spiral CT with 150 mL of intravenous contrast at 4 mL/sec, after a delay of 20 sec. Slice thickness 0.8 mm and a reconstruction index of 0.5 was used. Axial slices and multi-planar reformatting (MPR), maximum intensity projection (MIP) and 3D surface shaded display (SSD) reconstructions were reviewed. IA-DSA followed in all patients. There was comparative study between two methods. Results: Twelve cases of vascular malformations were diagnosed by CTA and these comprised 9 arteriovenous malformations and 3 venous angiomas. In 10 cases, the cause of SAH was vascular malformation and in 2 cases was an incidental finding. In comparison with IA-DSA, CTA missed only a small dural arteriovenous malformation but diagnosed a small venous angioma missed by IA-DSA. These two malformations appeared without hemorrhage. Conclusion: CTA is a useful non-invasive method in detection of cerebral vascular malformations causing SAH, with similar results to IA-DSA. Even though IA-DSA offers more anatomical detail in the evaluation of supplying and draining vessels, CTA can be a useful diagnostic tool as the tridimensional aspect offers additional information in the therapeutic planning of these vascular malformations. Material and Methods: CT angiography (CTA) was performed using spiral CT with 150 mL of intravenous contrast at 4 mL/sec, after a delay of 20 sec. A slice thickness of 0.8 mm and a reconstruction index of 0.5 were used. Axial slices and multi-planar reformatting (MPR), maximum intensity projection (MIP) and surface shaded display (SSD) reconstructions were studied to evaluate aneurysm characteristics. Then the image data was analyzed using volumetric 3D rendering technique to succeed endoscoping imaging. This technique extracts CT numbers in the boundary region between the vessel wall and contrast media within the vascular lumen. Results: Forty cases of cerebral aneurysms were detected by CTA. With the technique of CT virtual angioscopy, we assured an excellent visualization of the inner contours of the vessels including the neck and the dome of the aneurysm (fly through). Also 3D morphology of the internal structure of the aneurysm was demonstrated (fly around). The size of the sac (true lumen) and the neck were exactly estimated. Blood vessels flowing into and out of aneurysms were visualized. In 9 patients with ruptured aneurysms that were operated, virtual angioscopy showed the site of rupture, wich was confirmated by operation. Conclusion: Virtual angioscopy following spiral CTA is a very useful technique supplementary to CTA in non-invasive evaluation of cerebral aneurysms and selection of the most appropriate therapeutic modality.",

Our results suggest that a successful encoding requires an involvement of frontal lobes, that are probably responsible for the strategic aspects of memory functions. As was shown in the elderly control group, frontal lobes can compensate for the deteriorated visual memory which is known to decline over time. The special features of cerebral hemodynamics were studied in 52 patients with Chiari 1 malformation (CM) with the help of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and transcranial dopplerography (TCD). MRA data analysis (58) revealed the frequent presence of vertebrobasilar system (VBS) maldevelopment and embryonic type of circle of Willis. TCD data analysis (100) discovered vertebrobasilar insufficiency and bilateral blood flow increase in the intracranial part of the internal carotid arteries giving evidence of the compensated blood flow from the carotid system to the VBS. 21% of patients with CM and communicating hydrocephalus had TCD signs of intracranial hypertension. The most significant changes in cerebral hemodynamics were found in patients with marked pathology and older than 30 years. Conclusions: 1. Changes of cerebral hemodynamics in patients with Chiari 1 malformation are conditioned by a complex of various causes; vertebrobasilar system underdevelopment, extravasal compression of the VBS arteries, rombencephalon hernia (CM) compensated blood flow from internal carotid system to VBS and the presence of intracranial hypertension. 2. The role of vascular factors in pathogenesis of the clinical signs of Chiari 1 malformation is confirmed. Acute disorders of cerebral ischemic circulation in VBS and syncopal conditions were mainly found in patients with the 2 nd /3 rd degree Chiari malformation above 30 years of age, that correlates with the greatest changes of cerebral hemodynamics by transcranial dopplerography findings.",

Results: In group 1 (six patients) there was a prolonged MTT, a reduced CBF and an increased CBV in two cases. A poor depiction of MCA with MRA and a significant reduction of MBF in the MCA homolateral to ICA stenosis (103 mL/ min), as well as an angiographic impaired willisian compensation with a recruitment of vessels arising from the external carotid artery and from superficial collateral supply was detected in group1. Conclusions: PWI reveals oligemic abnormalities in only some patients with ICA stenosis. Increased MTT and reduced CBF are associated with an impaired willisian collateral supply. Probably, bolus dispersion may influence the PWI-detected oligemia in ICA stenosis.",

The same 52 patients had TCD on the 1 st day. Results: Symmetric blood flow velocity (BFV) in both MCAs was revealed in 41% of the patients. In this group, clinical course was rather auspicious in more than 70% of patients. Infarcts area in these patents had limited, cortical (73%) and subcortical (27%) localization. No lethal outcome was noted. Asymmetric blood flow with decreased MCA BFV by more than 20% on the affected side was noted in 32% of the patients. In this group, the infarctions had cortico-subcortical localization on final CT. The clinical course was more severe and complicated than in the first group.One lethal case occurred. In 27%, TCD demonstrated signs of hyperperfusion of hemodynamics with increased of MCA BFV by more than 20%, on the affected side, combined with high peripheral resistance index. Infarcts had mainly deep basal location, and 3 lethal cases occurred. Later CT detected hemorrhagic transformation of necrotic area (5 cases, 33%).

Jovanoska; Skopje/MK Purpose: To estimate significance of iv application of paramagnetic contrast in MR imaging in diagnosis of parenchymal brain metastases, especially leptomeningeal carcinomatosis seeding from lung cancer. Next purpose is to compare sensitivity between CT and MR imaging. Material and Methods: Thirty-six patients with lung cancer were evaluated radiographicaly to determine the present of metastases in CNS. We used CT as a screening tool and MR after i.v. application of GdDTPA. Results: Our series with 36 patients included 27 or 75% with non small-cell lung cancer and 9 patients or 25% with small-cell lung cancer. Three patients (33%) of 9 with small-cell lung cancer had occult metastatic disease to the brain. Eight patients (28%) of 27 with non small-cell lung cancer had metastatic disease to the brain parenchyma. In this series, leptomeningeal metastases were not found. CT scans were performed in all 27 patients, MRI was performed in 15 cases, some with i.v. application of GdDTPA, and in 8 patients brain metastatic disease was found. Post contrast MR imaging presents leptomeningeal carcinomatosis as thin linear enhancement along the cortical surface, which follows the gyral pattern of the cortex. Conclusion: All patients with lung cancer have to be investigated for brain metastases because of a great percentage (about 30%) of occult metastatic disease. Contrast enhanced MR of the brain is a superior method compared to CT because of excellent contrast resolution, is safer and has multiplaner abilities. To demonstrate meningeal seeding, contrast enhanced MRI is the modality of choice.",

All examinations were performed with 1.5 T unit using single-shot echo planar diffusion-weighed MR imaging at three different b values of 1000, 2000 and 3000 s/mm 2 . Seven days later from the onset, we re-examined the subjects with T2 weighted image for confirming the final diagnosis. Four experienced neuroradiologists assessed each diffusionweighted images for the presence of cerebral infarction and then compared the findings of each images with those of T2 weighted images. We divided the findings of each diffusion-weighted images into five categories by location of abnormal signal intensities and calculated true positive rate in each categories. Purpose: Arterial visualization of intracranial 3D-CTA is difficult in the area of the skull base. This is due to the close proximity of the internal carotid artery and skull base and the fact that they both have almost the same CT values. Accordingly, subtraction artifacts due to misregistration are unavoidable using the conventional subtraction method. Even a slight difference of the start position in data between pre-and post-contrast CT may lead to the production of considerable artifacts. Nowadays, subtraction of two sets of volume data has become possible on a workstation. We assessed whether this technique was useful in intracranial 3D-CTA. Methods and Materials: Subtraction was performed in both phantom and patients and the accuracy was tested. Results: Precise measurement was shown to be possible in the phantom experiment. Following this, several clinical cases were applied. Conclusion: Subtraction is effective due to being almost free of misregistration.",

Mochizuki 2 ; 1 Osaka/JP, 2 Onsen-gun/JP Purpose: Radiation exposure during CT perfusion study is a serious problem. The purpose of this study was to devise a method for reducing radiation exposure in cerebral perfusion studies using multi-detector row CT. Methods and Materials: Nine patients (6 males and 3 females; mean age 68.4 years) participated in this study. Following a standard protocol for CT perfusion study, continuous (cine) scans (0.8-1.0 sec/rotation x 60 sec) consisted of four 5-mm-thick contiguous slices performed after an injection of iodinated contrast material (30-40 mL) using a multi-detector row CT scanner (Light Speed QX/I, GE). New image data were generated by thinning out the original images thus acquired. The thinned-out images were interpolated by linear or cubic interpolation. The functional images of perfusion parameters such as cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and mean transit time (MTT) were generated from these images by applying deconvolution analysis based on singular value decomposition pixel by pixel. We calculated the correlation coefficients between the perfusion parameters obtained from original and thinned-out images for 15 regions of interest in the grey and white matter. Results: When using 10 continuous images with a scan time of 0.8-1.0 sec and the thinned-out images with a scan interval of 1.6-2.0 sec, the radiation exposure could be reduced to 56.0-58.3%, with the correlation coefficients of CBF, CBV and MTT being kept greater than 0.9. Conclusion: This method can reduce radiation exposure while keeping the accuracy of perfusion parameters equivalent to that obtained from original images.",

Results: Statistical analysis showed significant differences of ADC values dependent on ROI location within the brain hemisphere. There was no difference between right and left hemisphere. ADC values for low and high field systems were similar. In 30 patients, ischemic lesions were found in the first examination. Follow-up confirmed 24 infarcts.

It can create difficulties in the differential diagnosis and can therefore cause problems in choosing the appropriate therapy. This is especially true in cases with Alzheimer's versus Lewy-body disease ((DLB), which require different therapeutical approach. We applied 1H-MRS to assist the diagnostic process and to look for specific differences in the metabolic content of the brain tissue in these two entities. Methods: 1H-MRSwas performed using 1.5 T scanner in T1-weighted images in 3 orthogonal planes in 24 elderly subjects with consensus criteria DLB (n = 12), NINCDS-ADRDA AD (n = 12), and normal control subjects (n = 10). 1H-MRS was performed with single-voxel (SVS) technique using STEAM sequence (TR 2000 ms, TE 20 ms). Voxel was positioned in the temporal, occipital lobe and centrum semiovale. Results: In both Alzheimer's and Lewy-body group, 1H-MRS showed changes in the metabolite pattern in all voxel locations, with the most distinct expression within temporal lobes. NAA and creatine peaks were lowered in both patients groups, comparing to the controls. In spectra of Lewy-body patients myoinosytol peak remained unchanged as opposite to the Alzheimer's where it was increased. Conclusions: 1H-MRS can be an additional, very important tool in dementia studies and differential diagnosis of this group of diseases. In DLB patients 1H-MRS is feasible but there are difficulties in scanning patients in the later stages of the illness due to tremor and the degree of brain atrophy. The activation tasks consisted of left finger movement, sensory stimulation, listening to comprehension (for sensory language area), word generation (for motor language area) and working memory. The reference function was boxcar waveform. Activation maps were thresholded at uncorrected p = 0.0001. The thresholded activation maps were placed into Talarach's space. Results: Cerebellar activation was observed in the motor, the word generation and the working memory tasks. In the hot sensory and listening comprehension tasks, there was not any visible activation in the cerebellum. Left and right posterior cerebellar (Declive) activation was observed in the left motor task. Ipsilateral cerebellar activation was more prominent than contralateral cerebellar activation during the left motor task. Left posterior cerebellar (Declive) activation was observed in the working memory task. Left posterior cerebellar (Declive) and both anterior cerebellar (Culmen) activations were noted in the word generation task. Conclusion: Cerebellar activation was observed in the afferent actions of the brain including motor, motor language and working memory tasks. There was no activation of the cerebellum in the efferent action of the brain including sensory and sensory language tasks. The cerebellum is involved in a variety of functional tasks including motor, word generation and working memory. ",

The protocol consists of axial T1 and PD/T2 SE, and FLAIR, T2FSE and IR in a coronal plain perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus. Whenever necessary, we applied T1 + Gd SE in axial and coronal planes. Films were interpreted by two experienced neuroradiologists. Sequences were statistically analyzed in pairs using Wilcoxon Sign Ranks Test. Results: There were 33 patients (68.75%) with MR and EEG findings suggestive of hippocampal sclerosis. Eight of them underwent therapeutic surgery and there was histopathologic confirmation of the diagnosis. FLAIR detected hyperintensity of the hippocampus in 31/33 (94%) and was much more sensitive than T2FSE (18/33 p = 0.002) and PD/T2 (11/33 p = 0.000). Reduced hippocampal size (28/ 33), atrophy of hippocampus (22/33) and enlarged temporal horn (24/33) were better detected with IR than T1 (9/33 p = 0.000).

Batinica, J. Papa, M. Seronja-Kuhar; Zagreb/HR Purpose: To assess the usefulness of virtual endoscopic cerebral CT angiography data analysis in patients with aneurysm rupture before making a decision between neurosurgical intervention or endovascular treatment. Materials and Methods: During a one-year period, MSCTA was performed in 35 patients after a conventional CT proven subarachnoid hemorrhage. Images were acquired using MSCT LightSpeed Ultra, GE. Helical data acquisition followed after rapid i.v. administration of contrast material (3.5 mL/sec), with 18-23 sec delay. Data was postprocessed on GE Advantage Workstation Ultra v4.0 using reconstruction protocols MIP (maximum intensity projection), SSD (shaded surface display), VR (volume rendering) and VE (virtual endoscopy). Results: Detailed analysis of aneurysmal neck, dome, vessel of origin and surrounding vascular or bone structures was acquired by SSD, MIP or by high-accuracy VR protocol. Modified surface rendering and VE protocol were used for endoscopic mode viewing to visualize neck shape, accessibility from the parent vessel, presence of thrombotic clots or calcifications inside the aneurysm and vessel of origin, as well as to define orifices of branches arising from the dome. Conclusion: Accurate characterization of morphology of the aneurysm, especially depiction of orifices and aneurysmal neck are essential for choice between neurosurgical intervention or endovascular treatment. When endovascular treatment is an option, it is useful to know angulation between parent vessel and neck and real volume of aneurysmal dome for proper estimation of coil size and shape. VR and VE imaging of the aneurysmal sack and surrounding anatomy may provide additional useful information for endovascular treatment or neurosurgical intervention. ",

To outline the advantages and limits of plain film radiography, cross-sectional imaging, interventional radiology and radionuclide imaging. Background: Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a critical therapeutic intervention for a variety of pathological conditions. The complications of BMT include chemotherapy and radiation toxicity, graft versus host disease, recurrent malignancy, infection and miscellaneous conditions. Complications of allogenic BMT manifest in a variety of clinical settings. The neurological system is commonly affected. In this presentation we will review the incidence, clinical presentation and the radiographic findings of CNS involvement following stem cell transplantation. Plain radiography, contrast material enhanced studies, sonography, CT, MRI and interventional techniques are essential in diagnosing these complications and evaluating their response to therapy. Imaging Findings: Findings may be broadly classified into either infective, cerebrovascular or treatment induced. Common infective manifestations include human herpes virus 6, invasive mucormycosis and central nervous system tuberculosis. Classical image findings of haemorrhage and infarction are seen in addition to graft versus host disease cerebrovascular angiitis. Infarcts, diffuse white matter disease and cortical atrophy are seen following total body irradiation. The imaging findings of posterior leukoencephalopathy in cyclosporin toxicity is illustrated.",

A firm understanding of the clinical presentations and incidence in combination with typical radiological findings is essential in the successful management of this patient sub-group. B D E F A G Background: Diffusion weighted imaging has been widely used in stroke patients to detect early acute cerebral infarction and find out ischemic penumbra. However, we often unexpectedly encounter restricted diffusion on DWI of nonvascular origin mimicking hyperacute or acute infarction in clinical practice.We reviewed nonvascular diseases with restricted diffusion on DWI for past three years by retrospective selection. Imaging Findings: The characteristic findings mimicking hyperacute or acute infarction are high signal intensity and low apparent diffusion coefficient values, mainly distributed in the white matter and incompatible with arterial territory with no stenoocclusive lesion on MR angiography or conventional angiography, and are reversible. These findings may increase possibility of nonvascular diseases such as infection, inflammation (viral or bacterial encephalitis), hemorrhage, leukodystrophy, toxic (anti-cancer drugs, CO poisoning), metabolic origin and tumors. Conclusion: We present various diseases, under certain clinical settings, and systematically discuss the mechanism of restricted diffusion in a limited number of specific diseases. Background: In patients with vitamin B12 deficiency, symptoms related to the spinal cord may often help to find the diagnosis. However, in patients with atypical symptoms MRI shows typical findings often diagnostic for SCD. Beneath a general discussion, we present 2 cases of SCD in whom MRI findings were leading to the diagnosis of B12-deficiency. Patient 1 presented with tingling in her extremities. Neurologic examination showed a subacute loss of proprioception and profound loss of vibration sense. Vitamin B12 serum levels were normal. T2W-MRI showed increased signal in the posterior columns of the spinal cord. DWI showed disturbance of diffusion in the same location. Patient 2, who practiced a vegan alimentation, was admitted with incomplete paraplegia with signs of spasticity. Vibration sense and proprioception were impaired as well. MRI revealed the typical findings of severely increased signal within the posterior columns of the spinal cord. Both patients presented in very early stages of the disease. In summary, the MRI findings showed typical signal hyperintensities in T2W images in the posterior columns of the cervical and/or thoracic myelon-segments. Conclusion: Even in patients with subtle atypical symptoms, MRI with its typical findings often allows the diagnosis of SCD even in the rare case of normal levels of vitamin B12. ",

Background: DTI is a new MR imaging technique that non-invasively visualizes white matter fiber tracts and may have potential to assess demyelination and other brain disorders. Using single shot echo planar imaging (TR 7000-9000/TE 90-100 ms, 3 mm section thickness, b value 800-1000 s/mm 2 in 6-54 non-collinear directions at 1.5 and 3 T) and offline post-processing of diffusion tensor metrics (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and principal eigenvector) and fiber connectivity images (using fast marching tractography) could be studied. Imaging Findings: In normal patients, the fractional anisotropy (FA) maps clearly visualized white matter tracts as areas of high FA compared to gray matter. The corticospinal tracts, corpus callosum and optic radiations could be consistently identified. Abnormalities such as brain neoplasm, cerebral infarction and multiple sclerosis lesions showed decreased fractional anisotropy and elevated mean diffusivity.

They can by classified according to: a) Time of presentation as early = synchronous (at initial diagnosis) or late = metachronous (diagnosed during the treatment); b) The imaging characteristics as multicentric (arise independently in different sites, there is absence of macroscopic connections or way of dissemination) or multifocal (they spread from primary tumor to other areas in the brain, with evidence of routes of dissemination). We reviewed documentations of 109 patients with diagnosis of glial tumor WHO grade III-IV who underwent surgery between January 2001 and December 2002. In all patients radiological and histological diagnosis was performed and 8 cases were established as multiple glioma. Imaging Fingings: Most of the patients had one bigger lesion and 2 or 3 smaller ones. The lesions were usually hyperintense on T2-weighted images and hypoor isointense on T1WI with strong postcontrast enhancement. Most of them had moderate edema. We recognized 6 multicentric and 2 multifocal gliomas, 7 were synchronous and one metachronous. Conclusion: Multiple gliomas are often radiologically reported as metastasis, sometimes as lymphomas or infectious diseases. The differential diagnosis of multiple masses in the brain is very important for therapeutic consequences and multiple glioma should considered because of suggested increasing frequency of this entity. If strong postcontrast enhancement and moderate edema around the lesions are observed, this diagnosis should be suggested.",

All patients had an MRI combined with CT in stereotactic conditions. Some patients also benefited from stereotactic DSA (n = 43) or PET (n = 57). In all cases, MR was used to delineate a target before radiosurgery. CT was always used as a control for MR distorsion. DSA was used in combination with angioMR for all arteriovenous malformations.

Materials and Methods: DTI data were acquired using DW-SE-EPI sequences and a 1.5 T MR-unit, with the following parameters: TR 6000-10000, 18-28 slices, 5 mm slice thickness, 1.5 mm intersclice gap, 64 x 64 matrix and gradients encoding in 25 directions, b-1500 sec/mm 2 . Data were acquired in normal subjects and 13 patients with brain tumors, AVM's or seizure foci being considered for surgery. FA images and corresponding colored coded maps were generated. Also, FSE T2 or FLAIR images were acquired in identical locations for comparative use. Results: Major white matter tracts (intrahemispheric, interhemispheric, and brain stem) were readily visualized, including the following: superior longitudinal fasciculuus, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, corpus callosum, cingulum, optic radiations, anterior commissure, corona radiata, internal capsule, pyramidal tracts, medial lemniscus, medial longitudinal fasciculus, cerebellar peduncles and gracile and cuneate fasciculi. The spatial relationships of these tracts and resectable lesions were analysed, with particular attention to the risk of a postoperative deficit. All results were correlated with the pre-and post-operative deficits. Conclusion: White matter anatomy can now be imaged using DTI/FA and access to pre-operative eloquent white matter mapping has great potential to improve the outcomes of neuro-surgical candidates.

Embolization of the entire segment of the dissected site with detachable platinum coils (internal trapping) was performed in all patients. In one patient with posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA)-involved VA dissecting aneurysm, internal trapping of the aneurysm followed by occipital artery-PICA bypass was performed by a neurosurgeon. Results: Coil embolization was successful in all 9 patients. There were no procedure-related complications. There was no sign of infarction in the PICA territory in all patients. There was no recurrent bleeding or ischemic symptoms during the follow-up periods. Follow-up angiography showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm without recurrence in all patients. Conclusion: Endovascular coil embolization is a safe and highly effective treatment of ruptured VA dissecting aneurysms. high-grade stenoses of the carotid artery were treated with stent implantation. DW MR imaging of the brain was performed a day before and after the endovascular treatment. All patients underwent neurological examination before and after the procedure. Results: DW MR images showed a total of 12 new hyperintense lesions in 5 (31%) of the 16 procedures performed. Eight lesions were ipsilateral to the treated vessel and 4 lesions, in 2 patients, were contralateral. These patients with contralateral lesions also had new ipsilateral lesions. The lesions were located in parietal lobe (n = 5), periventricular (n = 2), occipital lobe (n = 1), frontal lobe (n = 1) and corona radiata (n = 1). All lesions measured < 5 mm in diameter. None of the patients had neurological symptoms. Results: Angiographic occlusion was complete in 84 (72%) and 30 (68%) aneurysms in groups A and B, respectively. Mean percentage of volumic occlusion in these groups was 30.9 and 29.2%, respectively. Perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were 4 and 2%, respectively in group A, and were respectively similar in group B. No significant difference between the two groups was observed. However, percentage of volumic occlusion correlated with sac-to-neck ratio smaller than 1.5 (P = 0.061) and with sac size (P = 0.002), except when 3 or more threedimensional coils per aneurysms were used (P = 0.222). The better the percentage of volumic occlusion, the better the percentage of angiographic occlusion (P = 0.004). Percentage of volumic occlusion was an independent predictor of angiographic complete occlusion (P = 0.001). WFNS grade 5 was an independent predictor of perioperative mortality (P = 0.043).",

Results: Neuronavigation was possible in all cases and was successfully applied in pre-operative planning and during surgical procedures. We calculated some data to check the efficacy of the method, having a mean fiducial error of 0.7 mm and an accuracy value at 6 cm of depth 1.7 mm. Discussion and Conclusion: Imaging fusion for pre and intra-operative neuronavigation provided, in all cases, great advantages in the choice of the best approach, placing of bone flap, early identification of deep normal or distorted anatomic or pathologic structures and their eventual encasement or involvement by the pathologic primary process, correct definition of tumor boundaries and meningeal implant and relationship with functional areas.

Methods: We selected 18 subjects who had completed a 6 month follow-up. The MR scans were obtained at baseline, at 3 months and at 6 months. Two regions of interest (ROI) were placed in each hemisphere in the NAWM in each MR study and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value were calculated in patients and in 15 healthy controls. Results: TADC in NAWM in patients was significantly higher then in controls (controls mean tADC \u00b1 sd = 0.731 \u00b1 0.015 mm 2 /sec x 10 -3 ; patients mean tADC \u00b1 sd = 0.7655 \u00b1 0.108 mm 2 /sec x 10 -3 ; p < 0.01).

Purpose: Evaluation of uveal melanoma imaging characteristics in ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and correlation of those findings suggestive of melanoma. Material and Methods: Eleven patients (8 men, 6 women, age 30-75 years) with possible diagnosis of uveal melanoma were evaluated. The patients underwent ophthalmoscopic and ultrasonographic examination followed by CT and MR examination. CT imaging was performed with 3 mm axial pre-and post-contrast and coronal post-contrast sections. Axial and coronal 3 mm T1 and T2 images were obtained, followed by post-contrast T1 images in axial and coronal direction. Additional T1 fat-sat post contrast images were also obtained depending on the relative position of the melanoma in order to evaluate possible extra-orbital extension. Results: Of the melanomas, six were located in the left globe, ranging from 2 mm to15 mm in size and most commonly on the lateral wall. The tumors appeared as hyperechoic lesions on US with a reflectivity range of 50-70%, suggestive of melanoma. Retinal detachment was detected in four patients. On CT images the melanomas appeared as homogenous slightly enhancing lesions, while in two patients, the tumor was less obvious due to the retinal detachment. On MR images the tumors appeared as homogenous hyperintense lesions on T1WI in five patients. Characteristic signal void on T2WI due to melanin deposition was noted in three patients.",

Dimitriadis; Thessaloniki/GR Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of detected structural abnormalities in medically intractable epilepsy, especially those who are amenable to a surgical therapy, and also to evaluate the sensitivity of different dedicated MR sequences. Materials and Methods: One hundred and twenty patients (aged 6 months-64 years) with medically intractable partial seizures underwent an MRI examination in a 1.5 T unit, with T1 and PD/T2 SE in an axial plane and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2FSE and inversion recovery (IR) in a plane perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus. Whenever necessary, we applied T1 SE + Gd DTPA in axial and coronal planes. Results: Seventy-nine of the 120 patients had a pathological scan (65.8%). Abnormalities were hippocampal sclerosis (HS) in 30 patients (25%), cerebral tumors in 12 patients (10%), vascular malformations in 9 patients (7.5%), cortical infarcts in 8 patients (6.7%), cerebral infections in 4 patients (4.2%) and 15 patients with developmental disorders (5 cortical dysplasias, 4 pachygyrias, 2 polymicrogyrias, 3 subcortical heterotopias and 1 patient with tuberous sclerosis). All patients with cerebral tumors and eight patients with HS were operated and there was a pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis. Patients with vascular malformation underwent a therapeutic embolization. FLAIR had higher sensitivity in detecting hippocampal sclerosis and cerebral infarcts while IR was particularly useful in detecting developmental disorders. Conclusions: MR imaging, with an epilepsy dedicated protocol, plays a cardinal role in locating and characterizing anatomic epileptogenic foci in patients with refractory epilepsy and helps in defining the type of treatment.",

Materials and Methods: Seven patients (4 men, 3 women, age between 26-70 years) with biopsy-proven glioblastomas were scanned before and/or after treatment by PET/CT (Biograph, Siemens). A dose of 180 to 220 MBq fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was administered for each PET scan with an acquisition time of 6 minutes for bed and interactive reconstruction. Acquisition time for CT was 25 seconds, bringing the total acquisition of combined PET/CT study to 15 minutes. Results: Three patients with high-grade astrocytomas demonstrated hypometabolic FDG nodules without contrast enhancement at CT scan before surgery. Two patients showed nodules with hypermetabolism of FDG (SUV 16-18) and intensive enhancement of contrast medium due to the recurrence of tumor after combined therapy. In one patient, after radiation therapy, the region of treatment had decreased uptake of FDG and increased enhancement of contrast medium at CT because of radionecrosis. Conclusion: It was confirmed that combined PET/CT study could effectively determine whether a lesion was malignant and provide evidence of tumor recurrence. The collection of prominent medullary (white matter) veins appears like a \"medusa head\" on MR angiographic images and gadolinium-enhanced 3D-TOF sequences; this sign is considered pathognomonic. Conclusion: MRI is of great value in the accurate identification and morphologic specification of vascular abnormalities. Traditionally, these cases required invasive diagnostic imaging. VA correct identification is very important because this anomaly is asymptomatic but the ablation can induce venous infarctions. ",

Liver pathology includes steatosis, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension. The pathological mechanism of cirrhosis may be due to obstruction of the biliary ductules with thickened secretions and secondary inflammation producing fibrosis. Biliary tract abnormalities include gallstones, micro gallbladder, and sludge. Excessive loss of faecal bile acids due to pancreatic insufficiency is associated with increased lithogenicity of the bile. The pancreatic abnormalities include fat infiltration, fibrosis, atrophy and occasionally cysts and calcification. The primary problem is the plugging of the intralobular ductules by inspissated viscid mucus.

Thornbury; Belfast/UK Learning Objectives: This poster presents a pictorial review of pediatric neck masses and their imaging features. Particular emphasis is applied to the anatomical site of the mass to aid in differential diagnosis. Background: Infants and children with neck masses frequently present to the radiologist for further evaluation. The most common aetiologies include congenital lesions and their complications, lymphadenopathy and malignant masses. The role of the radiologist is to differentiate between these conditions using im-aging modalities such as ultrasound and colour Doppler, CT and MRI. Where appropriate, the radiologist will also stage lesions for management purposes, and aid in guiding aspiration or biopsy. Imaging Findings: The radiological appearance of congenital lesions such as thyroglossal duct cysts, branchial cleft cysts, cystic hygromas, haemangiomas, dermoid cysts and sternomastoid \"tumours\" are discussed. Cervical lymphadenitis and abscesses, and neoplastic masses such as neurogenic tumours, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and lymphoma are also described. Lastly, lesions of the thyroid and salivary glands are evaluated. It must be emphasised that the radiological findings should always be interpreted in conjunction with the patient's age, the clinical history and the findings on physical examination. Conclusion: Neck masses are common in children and a frequent cause of attendance at A&E departments. Identifying the anatomical site and radiological appearance aids the differential diagnosis. Conclusion: A typical osteoarticular lesion in a typical site can alert you to the diagnosis of SAPHO, but an unusual site or a primary presentation with no skin lesions will make diagnosis harder or there may be misdiagnosis. Children may be seen in a number of specialties, which can lead to unnecessary delays in diagnosis and possible incorrect treatments. This makes the radiologist pivotal in the diagnosis of SAPHO, although the differential diagnosis should always be considered. To demonstrate the problems which can be caused when trauma X-ray films are incorrectly marked when using the red dot system. Background: Many radiographs are returned to Accident and Emergency departments without formal radiological reports, and the red dot system, whereby radiographers attach a red dot to radiographs which they suspect to be showing a fracture, is a widely practised system, used throughout the National Health Service. It is acknowledged that whilst this system can be beneficial to Accident and Emergency departments it is not without its problems.

The presence of renal anomalies has great postnatal significance and successful antenatal counselling depends on the availability of the most complete information. The advent of fast MR sequences has allowed the acquisition of high signal to noise ratio images of the fetus even in the absence of amniotic fluid. We discuss the technique of MR of the fetal renal tract. We describe the normal appearances fetal kidneys on MR and present data on illustrative cases where MR provided additional information over and above a detailed ultrasound examination. Methods: T2W single-shot Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement (RARE) and T1W 2D Fast Low Angle Shot (FLASH) were obtained of the fetal kidneys in the three orthogonal planes. All images were acquired without fetal sedation with the mother in the supine position within 20 minutes. Comparison ultrasound and MR images are presented. Results: MRI is able to diagnose and assess a variety of renal anomalies such as renal aplasia, dysplastic renal tissue, polycystic kidney disease, congenital hydronephrosis, and ectopic renal tissue.

            "text": "Imaging evaluation of neonatal cystic pelvic masses V.V.T. Mascarenhas, A. Duarte, L. Lobo, J. Fonseca-Santos; Lisbon/PT Learning Objectives: To describe imaging features of cystic pelvic masses (CPM) in the newborn. To outline main differential diagnosic pitfalls. To emphasise the role of imaging evaluation in treatment and follow-up orientation. Background: Neonatal CPM are among the most common abdominal masses in the neonate and usually first suspected during fetal ultrasonography. A more precise diagnosis in the neonatal period is essential to an adequate orientation in treatment and follow-up. On this regard, imaging evaluation, particularly US and MRI as the main techniques, undertake a pivotal role. We describe diagnostic imaging features, differential diagnosis limitations and a systematic diagnostic approach to CPM among selected cases in our department. Imaging Findings: We reviewed the referred cases based on sex, location, relation to adjacent anatomic structures and morphological features. Main diagnostic entities considered were pre-sacral (sacrococcygeal teratoma and myelomeningocele) and non pre-sacral masses (genitourinary related namely hydrocolpos, ovarian cyst, bladder diverticulum; digestive tract related e.g. duplication cyst; others, particularly lymphangioma). Morphological imaging findings according to their uni-or multilocularity, simple or complex components and the presence of specific findings were considered. Ultrasound was the first and sometimes the only imaging modality performed. Selected cases were further evaluated with other imaging modalities such as conventional contrast studies (e.g. cystography) or MRI. Conclusion: Although there is a wide range of entities presenting as a CPM in the neonate, a systematic imaging approach allows a more precise diagnosis or at least a considerable narrowing of diagnostic possibilities in the majority of cases, which is essential for therapeutic orientation.",

            "text": "Normal sonographic appearance of kidneys and adrenals in neonates and young infants: Unique distinctive features M. Vakaki, G. Pitsoulakis, H. Manoli, C. Koumanidou; Athens/GR Learning Objectives: To familiarize residents in radiology or pediatric radiology with the sonographic characteristics of neonatal and infantile kidneys and adrenals. Backround: The kidneys are the most commonly sonographically examined abdominal organs during the first months of life. The adrenals, due to their position adjacent to kidneys, are almost always clearly visualized during the renal sonogram. Their sonographic appearance is quite different from that in older children and adults and often causes misleading incorrect diagnoses. Imaging Findings: Examples of various normal sonographic findings of the kidneys and adrenals in neonates and young infants are presented and embryologically, anatomically or functionally explained. They include the hyperechogenicity of the renal cortex, the \"enlarged\" hypoechoic pyramids, the fetal lobulation, the inter-renicular septum, the transient neonatal renal medullary hyperechogenicity, the papillary projections in the pyelocalyceal system, the renal pyelectasis, the large and hyperemic neonatal adrenals and even more. These sonographic interpretations are often misdiagnosed as abnormal conditions, which are also provided. Conclusion: This exhibit will allow an interesting way for young radiologists and pediatric radiologists to learn the common, but also the rare sonographic appearances of neonatal and infantile kidneys and adrenals. This knowledge is essential in order to prevent misdiagnoses and needless further investigation. Background: Difficulties with blind corticosteroid injection of the subtalar joint are commonly encountered in children with JRA. Ultrasound (US) guidance can make the puncture more accurate by directly showing the needle tip within the joint. Procedure Details: Twelve consecutive patients with JIA who had clinical signs of active arthritis and intraarticular fluid or synovial proliferation in the subtalar joint detected at US received either a blinded injection (n = 7) or a US-guided (n = 5) injection with free-hand technique using high resolution (12-5 MHz) US.",

            "text": "Patients were assessed at 24 hours, 2 months and 6 months of follow-up to compare the level of clinical response and the frequency of complications between the two treatment groups. Conclusion: Although significant improvement was documented in both groups of patients with respect to baseline, those injected under US-guidance had a lower clinical dysfunction score at 24 hrs and 2 months follow-up. No major complications were noted. Our preliminary results indicate that intraarticular corticosteroid injection of the subtalar joint in children with JIA is more accurate and successful when performed under US guidance. Background: Doppler sonography is a well-established technique to evaluate a number of pediatric abdominal conditions, but the field of diagnostic applications is now on the brink of major changes. Many contrast-specific modalities have been developed in recent years by academic researchers, ultrasound scanner manufacturers, and pharmaceutical companies. Our aim is to update the diagnostic value of conventional Doppler modalities, and to analyse potentially useful applications and indications for the more recently developed techniques. Imaging Findings: Specific entities will be used to illustrate clinical principles that can be applied to multiple clinical situations. Topics addressed include: vascular patency (arterial or venous thrombosis or stenosis, biliary atresia, liver and bowel transplantation, and surgical shunts); anomalous vessels and tubular structures (dilation of the biliary tree vs. blood vessels, pulmonary sequestration, varicocele); and evaluation of hyperemic and ischemic lesions (appendicitis, intussusception, pyelonephritis, orchitis / testicular torsion). Conclusion: B-mode sonography, as well as Doppler techniques, have a key role in pediatric diagnosis for several reasons (non-invasivity, lack of ionizing radiation, sonographic access is better than in adults, no need for anesthesia or sedation). Understanding the physical principles that govern Doppler imaging is essential for its successful clinical application. Symptomatic cases: n = 8. Mean ONSD right eye = 5.5 mm (SD = 0.7), mean ONSD left eye = 5.7 mm (SD = 0.9). A Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test showed no significant difference between these results. Using the largest reading for each eye when well and symptomatic: mean asymptomatic ONSD = 4.8 mm (SD = 0.8, n = 8), mean symptomatic ONSD = 6 mm (SD = 0.8, n = 8). A Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test showed a significant difference in these results (p = 0.008). Conclusion: ONSD increases in acutely raised ICP. Our results suggest that children with spina bifida and shunted hydrocephalus cannot be assumed to have ONSD within the normal range even when clinically well. In the long term we aim to compile new ONSD reference ranges for children with shunted hydrocephalus. ",

The MRI appearance of GM during fetal development has been well-documented, but data about GM morphology in pathological conditions is sparse. Antenatal ventricular dilation (VD) is associated with significant neurological morbidity. We used antenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the GM in fetuses with and without VD. Methods: Retrospective analyses were conducted of fetal MR images acquired over a 2-year period, using fast T2 weighted sequences. In 70 fetuses (normal ventricles in 44, VD in 26 cases), we evaluated the signal characteristics and the maximum germinal matrix diameter (GMD) at three sites: the anterior and posterior ventricular horns and the caudothalamic notch (CTN). Between-group comparisons of GMD in normal and fetuses with VD were made using a Students t-test. Results: GM had the same low signal intensity regardless of GA and/or ventricular volume. None of the infants with VD had evidence of GM haemorrhage. The mean GMD in controls showed a linear decrease with brain maturation. In fetuses up to 28 weeks of GA with normal ventricles the GMD was greatest at the CTN. The similar pattern of changes in GMD was measured in VD group, where the mean GMD at the TCN were slightly, but not significantly lower then in controls (t = 1.48: p > (0.05)). Conclusion: GM diameter decreased with increasing gestational age. We did not detect any significant difference in GM morphology in the group of fetuses with antenatal VD.",

Focal testicular lesions (cystic and solid tumor) and extratesticular structures were documented regarding size, localization, range, vascularity and ultrasound diagnosis. In testicular tumors, the degree of tumor vascularity was subjectively graded from 0 to IV. The ultrasound diagnoses were compared to the final diagnoses based on clinical tests, surgical and histological examination. Results: 11 testicular and extratesticular tumors showed more enhancement than adjacent testicular parenchyma, seen between 15 to 60 s (mean 29 s) and 55 to 252 s (mean 83 s) after injection. The duration of enhancement was 15 to 210 s (mean 80 s). Cross sections and adjacent vessels were only seen in: teratoma, embryonal carcinoma and yolk sac tumor.

Koumanidou; Athens/GR Purpose: Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of the posterior urethral valves (PUV) and the accompanying vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in boys. However, its contribution to the characterization of intrarenal pathology, which is considered to be of great prognostic value, is minimal. It is only with recently introduced high resolution ultrasonographic equipment that details of disturbed renal architecture can be visualized. Materials and Methods: 12 infant boys with PUV, aged 1 day to 7 months were examined sonographically with 5-8 MHz convex and 5-12 MHz linear transducers. The presence of PUV was confirmed with VCUG in all cases. Results: Apart from the classic sonographic findings of PUV, which were also demonstrated, findings specific to the kidney included: a) bilaterally increased renal parenchymal echogenicity and loss of corticomedullary differentiation (12/ 12), which with b) small cortical cysts (8/12) imply renal dysplastic lesions, c) increased medullary echogenicity, cupping of dilated calyces, which is attributed to intrarenal reflux (3/12), d) hypoechoic lines pointing towards rounded calyces, corresponding to the pelvotubular backflow of urine (2/12), e) small subcapsular urinomas (2/12), f) urinoma and urine ascites (1/12) and g) intrarenal abscesses (1/12) and fungal balls in the collecting system (2/12), due to post-surgical candidiasis of the urinary tract. Conclusion: Ultrasonography with high-resolution transducers is able to visualize underlying renal pathology and to image the parenchymal architecture, contributing not only to the diagnosis but also to the definition of the prognosis in boys with PUV.

Study of the Doppler signals after fast Fourier Transform enables us to characterize the fetal movements in term of the amplitude, displacement and frequency. Estimate of displacement is obtained by calculating the phase of the signal resulting from the analytical filtering of the Doppler signal and to separate the direction from the Doppler signals. Results: Twenty recordings were carried out on four women in their last quarter of pregnancy. During the last quarter of pregnancy, the FHR is approximately 130 Beats.min -1 . however, the FHR that we detected is about 134 Beats.min -1 . We are thus in the presence of the fetal heart rhythm.

Agianniotakis, E. Sfakianaki; Iraklion/GR Purpose: To investigate the capability of hand and wrist sonography in skeletal age assessment, and to propose a technique that could be commonly used. Materials and Methods: Forty-two children, aged 0 months to 16 years, underwent a left hand radiograph for skeletal evaluation. They were also sonographically examined on the same hand, with focus on distal epiphyses of radius and ulna, carpal ossification centers, adductor sesamoid bones of metacarpophalangeal joint of the wrist and the cartilage of the third's finger distal phalange. Scanning and measurements were obtained in both transverse and longitudinal planes, and the images were digitally recorded for further evaluation. Results: All areas of interest were identified both in the left hand radiograph as well as in the sonographic examination, for each individual. Furthermore by dorsal and palmar scanning of the carpal ossification centers, accurate mapping and measurements were feasible. Gaining experience, and developing a common procedure, we were able to progressively minimize most technical difficulties. Conclusion: Hand and wrist sonography promises an accurate, safe and cost effective assessment of skeletal age. Detailed knowledge of hand and wrist anatomy, and familiarization with a standardized method, as the one we propose, in acquiring and interpreting images is indispensable. In addition, the designation of sonographic charts for the evaluation of skeletal age could be possible in the future.",

Mak\u00f3; Budapest/HU Purpose: Biliary atresia (BA), intrahepatic cholestasis (IHC) and neonatal hepatitis (NH) are the main causes of neonatal direct hyperbilirubinaemia (NDH). The distinction of BA needing early surgical intervention from NH and IHC syndromes is essential, but difficult. The impact of hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HSC) in the differential diagnosis of NDH was evaluated. Methods and Materials: 28 HSCs of 25 patients (age: 10 days-6 months) with NDH were included in our retrospective study of a five years period. After administration of 1.85 MBq/kg (min.: 9 MBq) 99mTc-BrIDA serial abdominal images were performed up to 24 hours. The scintigraphic diagnoses (SD) of BA, IHC, NH and indeterminate (IND) were defined based on visual scoring of liver uptake, intrahepatic radiopharmaceutical transport and bowel activity. SDs were compared with clinical diagnoses (CD), which were based on laboratory, histological or operative findings and/or clinical follow-up. Results: The CDs were: 12 BA, 9 IHC, and 7 NH. The SDs were: 10 BA, 5 IHC, 7 NH, 6 IND were correct in 14 and false in 8 cases, while the CD in the 6 IND cases was BA. Regarding the shortage of bowel activity as a basis for SD of BA the sensitivity and specificity of HSC in the diagnosis of biliary atresia were 100 and 75% respectively. Conclusion: Our results suggest that hepatobiliary scintigraphy is a useful tool in distinguishing BA requiring urgent surgical intervention from other kinds of pathologic conditions causing NDH, but that it is unreliable in further narrowing of the differential diagnosis.",

Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were measured from the brain lesions and 12 normal appearing white and gray matter areas in study group. 12 normal appearing areas were also measured in the control group. Results: ADC values obtained from the normal subjects were similar to values described in the literature. ADC values of study groups were significantly different from the control subjects. ADC values for the neurodegenerative disease group, anoxic encephalopathy group, ADEM group, encephalitis, SSPE group, were respectively between 0.33 x 10-3-2.1 x 10-3 cm 2 /s, 0.10 x 10-3-2.03 x 10-3 cm 2 /s, 0.55 x 10-3-0.93 x 10-3 cm 2 /s, 1.02 x 10-3-1.58 x 10-3, 1.07 x 10-3-1.46 x 10-3 cm 2 /s.

The (pre-released) version (Aug. 2003), work in progress, has been evaluated on different full field digital mammography (FFDM) systems and is the basis of the present teaching session. Procedure Details: Following systems were included: Senographe 2000D (GE), Senoscan (Fischer), 5000MA (Fuji), AC3 (Fuji), Embrace CR (Agfa) and Embrace DR (Agfa). The tests as described in the protocol included direct performance tests, contrast detail analysis, patient dose measurements and physical measurements such as MTF and DQE. For these last measurements, acceptable and achievable levels have not yet been defined. The help of a service engineer was necessary in most systems to get access to raw data. The tests as proposed in the protocol could then be performed. Contrast detail analysis is the most critical part and should be automated to reduce interobserver variability.

Noo 2 ; 1 Highland Heights, OH/US, 2 Salt Lake City, UT/US Learning Objectives: To describe how the different aspects of helical cone-beam reconstruction affect spatial resolution in all three dimensions. To demonstrate that depending on the radial and angular position of a voxel, this resolution can be anisotropic. To describe appropriate filtering and interpolation steps that can be taken to reduce these effects. Background: A number of methods have been described recently that provide either exact or near-exact reconstructions of helical cone-beam scan data. In this exhibit, we will describe key aspects of the implementation of these reconstruction algorithms that affect spatial resolution. We will show how the anisotropy of in-plane resolution can be related to the corresponding effect in single-slice 2D reconstructions. Alternative filtering and interpolation steps will be suggested. Procedure Details: FWHM slice-sensitivity profile and in-plane resolution measurements were performed on helical reconstructions of a phantom consisting of seventeen 0.25 mm diameter spherical beads located at 0, 100, and 200 mm radii. The scans used an MX8000-IDT 16 x .75 mm detector configuration with a 1.25 pitch factor. Single-slice 2D reconstructions were performed on the same phantom using both fan and parallel convolution-backprojection algorithms to produce comparative in-plane measurements. Alternative hi-order interpolation and voxel-dependent filters were investigated to produce nearly isotropic resolution. Conclusion: Significant spatial variation in resolution can be observed in exact or near-exact helical cone-beam reconstructions. A more uniform and isotropic result can be achieved by using hi-order interpolation to produce parallel projection data along with longitudinal voxel-dependent filtering.",

Simulations were performed using the same phantom geometry, including a 32x.75 mm helical scan. A voxel-dependent filter was used to achieve uniform longitudinal resolution and compared to projectionbased filtering. Both real and simulated thorax phantoms were used to evaluate the effects on image quality. Results: Resolution measurements demonstrate an angular variation in longitudinal resolution for large-pitch helical and circular HS cone-beam scans. The FWHM SSP measurements varied by over 15% and 25% at 100 and 200 mm radii respectively. Reconstructions with projection-based filters did not reduce this variation. Similar results were observed for helical scans with the larger cone angle (32 x .75 mm detectors), wherein the resolution pattern varied at half the frequency along the longitudinal direction. Applying voxel-dependent longitudinal filtration achieved uniform resolution, demonstrating improved image quality in both real and simulated scans.

Schick; T\u00fcbingen/DE Purpose: Diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) using SE-EPI in tissue with short T2 values, such as kidney or skeletal muscle, suffers from a poor SNR for higher bvalues. Using a stimulated-echo diffusion preparation, sufficiently high b-values can be obtained by increasing the mixing time (TM) rather than TE. A diffusionweighted stimulated-echo EPI sequence is proposed which minimizes the influence of eddy currents (EC) without any increase in the minimum TE or acquisition time. Methods and Materials: Assuming a monoexponential decay for the EC with time constant \u03bb, gradient pulses can be implemented within the TM interval such that eddy current effects proportional to exp (-\u03bb x t) will vanish. In-vivo DTI measurements were performed in human calf musculature on a 1.5 T Siemens Sonata unit. Measurement parameters were TE = 37 ms, TM = 100 ms, TR = 4000 ms, b = 0 resp. 500 s/mm 2 , Matrix 64 x 64, FOV 200 mm, NEX = 4, slice thickness 8 mm. Diffusion weighting was applied in six directions in order to calculate the diffusion tensor. Results: Diffusion images were acquired with and without EC correction. Images without EC correction showed obvious scaling and shearing distorsions whereas in images obtained with EC correction no significant distorsions were observed. Conclusion: Diffusion-weighted MR imaging using EPI is very sensitive to image distorsions caused by eddy currents. Inserting additional gradient waveforms in a stimulated-echo EPI sequence drastically reduces these artifacts and allows a calculation of the diffusion tensor in various tissues with low T2/T1 ratios without significant misregistration.",

Claussen; T\u00fcbingen/DE Purpose: Metallic implants such as aneurysm clips may cause enlarged artifacts at higher magnetic field strengths, not only due to susceptibility effects. Aneurysm clips made of Ti-alloy were investigated with special respect to MR-imaging results and possible RF-induced artifacts. Materials and Methods: 10 aneurysm clips were measured in Gd-DTPA doped water at 1.5 T and 3.0 T with adapted SE-sequences. Additionally, two models made of copper were investigated at 3.0 T. To separate RF induced effects, the transmitter voltage was bisected stepwise to verify the RF-induced deviation of the local flip angle near to the implant. This was also done with 3D-TSE sequences. Results: In comparison to 1.5 T, more pronounced hyperintense zones were found at 3.0 T. They were independent of the exchange of phase-and frequency-encoding direction (swap) and became more pronounced at reduced transmitter voltage. Comparative investigation of two Cu-models and one selected Ti clip at reduced transmitter voltage revealed RF induced effects depending on inductive and capacitive structures of the clip. Conclusion: Metallic implants have to be considered carefully at 3.0 T due to the electrical conductivity. RF-induced artifacts can appear not only for longish objects but also on smaller devices. In the case of aneurysm clips, a slight RFinduced effect could be detected. Potential patient endangering due to a local enhancement of the secific absorption rate (SAR) can be estimated as negligible.",

Methods and Materials: Monochromatic 1M LCD monitor and photometer of luminance calibration tool kit (Data Ray Corp, Westminster, USA) were used. The luminance contrast of this monitor was measured by a photometer displaying GSDF and CIELAB. Luminance change and digital driving level (DDL) that corresponded to CT value (HU) were tabulated.

The ratio of luminance contrast to CT value contrast was calculated as visual contrast index (VCI). The VCI of GSDF and CIELAB was evaluated using t-test. Result: Using t-test, VIC of CIELAB was significantly higher than that of GSDF in window setting of thoracic CT imaging (p < 0.01).

Materials and Methods: From April 1998 to February 2002, 5039 cardiac procedures, coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) have been performed on 3332 patients. Mean DAP was 78.6 Gycm 2 . Patients with a cumulative dose-area product (DAP) higher than 300 Gycm 2 have been extracted. They were 78 patients (2.3%), 17 female and 61 male, mean age 71 years, who underwent a mean number of 4.5 procedures resulting in a mean cumulative DAP of 335 Gycm 2 and a maximum value of 995 Gycm 2 . From DAP, CSD has been estimated adopting 4.3 and 8.7 10 -3 cm -1 as conversion factors for CA and PTCA, respectively. Clinical follow-up has been performed adopting the LENT-SOMA methodology and scale. Results: The highest CSD estimated was 6.7 Gy and only 25 patients (32%) exceed a skin dose of 3 Gy. No skin injuries were detected at clinical follow-up. These results allow to estimate a frequency for skin injuries of less than 3.10 -4 in patients undergoing repeated cardiac procedures.",

The intention of the development of ultrasound computer tomography was to increase the reliability of ultrasound imaging and to supply standardized images similar to other cross section imaging procedures. Methods and Materials: Instead of a manually-controlled linear transducer array, we used ultrasound computer tomography (USCT) to image a volume directly. A few thousand ultrasound transducers were arranged in a cylindrical array around a tank containing the object to be examined coupled by water. Every single transducer was small enough to emit an almost spherical sound wave. While one transducer was transmitting all other transducers worked as receivers simultaneously. Afterwards a different transducer emitted the next pulse. For volume reconstruction each transmitted, scattered and reflected signal was used. In an experimental set-up a phantom containing nylon filaments, straws, and a cadaveric forearm were investigated. Results: Nylon filaments with a diameter of 0.1 mm were visualized. The skin and soft tissue of the cadaveric forearm were clearly detectable but the bone structures could not be delineated sufficiently. USCT supplied reproducible image sequences. Conclusion: USCT promises to supply standardized high quality three-dimensional images without ultrasound shadowing artifacts and without interobserver variability. Furthermore, the tissue is not deformed, in principle offering multimodal image fusion with other cross section imaging modalities. Prior to clinical set up extended development especially of large transducer element tubes and improvement of software is necessary. ",

Materials and Methods: 204, 75 and 104 PTCAs performed at three different centres were investigated. Multiple linear stepwise regression analysis, including clinical, anatomic, and technical factors, was performed in order to obtain fluoroscopy time (FT) predictors. Based on the regression coefficients of the emerging model a scoring system was defined, and a CI was obtained by adding up the single scores for each individual procedure. Since a good correlation (r = 0.41; p < 0.001) was found between the dose-area product (DAP) and the resulting CI, the latter was used to classify dose values into three groups. CI groups were determined by means of an ANOVA test: different sets of groups were explored until the matrix of pairwise comparison probabilities reached a minimum value (p < 0.001). The resulting DAP and FT third quartiles corresponding to each CI group are suggested as preliminary RLs in PTCA as a function of procedure complexity. Results: PTCA preliminary RLs: (i) for DAP values: 54, 76 and 127 Gycm 2 , and (ii) for FT: 12, 20 and 27 min, respectively for the three CI groups: low, medium and high complex procedures.",

The present study of the chaotic SEL activity was done to try to find out distinctive dynamic features between melanoma and adjacent tissues. Methods and Materials: MTE is a new functional, non-invasive digital imaging modality, which enables dynamic visualization of the skin and underlying tissues in terms of spectral electroimpedance and electropotential parameters, with high spatial and temporal resolution (~ 0.5 mm). Non-thermal mm-EMF (4 min) and weak MF (< 0.001 T) were used as test influences. Initial and induced SEL dynamics have been graphically and statistically analyzed. Specifically, the throughimage-sequence analysis resulted in detailed dispersion maps of the scan-area. The SELs of (i) healthy and allergic subjects, and (ii) those with cutaneous melanoma were investigated. Results: Primary melanoma manifested not only as a sharp electro-abnormality, but also as a distinctly stable/hyposensitive zone (sigma = 0.0 -1.0%) in all measurement parameters.This hyposensitive zone(s) was surrounded by islet areas of marked hypersensitivity (sigma is up to 50%).

ICE indices were determined in patients (n = 13) with NPH, brain atrophy or asymptomatic ventricular dilation (VD), and in healthy volunteers (control group; n = 11). Concurrently, a time constant of the integral of the CSF response function, which represents the intracranial mechanical property was determined with PC cine MRI. The changes in ICE indices were also analyzed after intravenous injection of acetazolamide. These values were then compared with the volume-pressure response (VPR) during the shunt operations. Results: The ICE index in the NPH group was significantly higher than in the control or VD group, but no difference was found between the control and VD groups. The ICE index increased in all groups after an acetazolamide injection because of an increase in cerebral blood volume. There were significant correlations between the ICE index and the time constant. A positive correlation was noted between the ICE index and the VPR. Conclusion: ICE analysis measured by PC cine MRI makes it possible to noninvasively obtain a detailed assessment of intracranial state and dynamics in the NPH and to assist in diagnosis of the NPH.",

Servomaa 2 ; 1 Oulu/FI, 2 Helsinki/FI Learning Objectives: To clarify the content and uses of the concept of radiography in health sciences and to compare it to the concept of radiography in physics and technology. Background: In the field of radiography, theoretical research related to concepts has so far being rare. Nevertheless, the concept development is an important part in constructing theories and clarifying the identity of a discipline. In Finland, the discipline of radiography started in 1999 at the University of Oulu, and since then it has offered radiographers academic education in their own field. For being able to build its own knowledge base and theories to be used in developing the profession and education of radiographer, and for being able to stand for its position as an independent academic discipline, the young discipline of radiography needs systematic conceptual clarification and development. Procedure Details: The concept of radiography was analysed using so-called evolutionary method of concept analysis (presented by Rodgers). The contents and uses of the concept were studied by determining the concept's characteristics and by observing these characteristics in the cross-disciplinary comparison. The data consisted of literature and Internet pages, and were analysed using deductive-inductive content analysis. Conclusion: The concept of \"radiography\" in health sciences can be determined as \"dual, dynamic, social and situation-related expertise of radiographers in the use of radiation, which is based on a versatile synthesis\". It seems to be wide and complex in nature, and radiographer-centered. The content and the use of the concept varies according to the discipline.",

Background: In general, we use an ionization chamber dosimeter or TLD to measure dose distribution of diagnostic level. However TLD can not indicate horizontal and consecutive dose distributions, because it has only scattered dose data. Consequently, we used Gafchromic film to obtain a horizontal consecutive dose distribution of human diagnostic level. Imaging Findings: 1. First, we placed a Gafchromic film and glass dosimeters in the specific place of the chest phantom. Then we irradiated the chest phantom with diagnostic level X-rays. The dose distribution which was acquired by the film and glass dosimeters was then analyzed. 2. Next, we examined the result of fluoroscopy. 3.

Chapman; Leeds/UK Aim: To determine the types and rates of complications encountered by radiographers when performing double contrast barium enemas. A similar complication rate to those encountered by radiologists will reassure those who have adopted this new skill mix and encourage its further development whereas an increase in complications may point to areas where radiographer training needs to be improved. Materials and Methods: 741 questionnaires were posted to radiographers who had in the last 5 years attended one of the biannual Leeds barium enema training courses. Results: Of 741 questionnaires posted 407 (54.9%) were returned completed. Approximately, 348,433 barium enema examinations had been performed. 59 radiographers reported 87 complications, including 13 intraperitoneal and 11 extraperitoneal perforations. There were five deaths (mortality rate -1 in 69,687). The five deaths included two of the twenty-four (10%) perforations, two of the forty-five (5%) cardiac events and one CVA that occurred during an examination. Conclusions: Radiographers have been regularly performing DCBEs for almost a decade. The mortality rate for radiographer performed double contrast barium enemas is similar to that reported for radiologists. A slightly higher than expected rate of perforation is noted in this study and so this is an area where radiographer training should be targeted.",

Bull; Sheffield/UK Purpose: Vetting of CT requests ensure that the examination is justified in accordance to local guidelines and also allow the radiologist to select the most appropriate CT protocol. However the provision of poor clinical information severely limits this step. This audit aims to determine the prevalence of inadequate clinical details in CT request forms and also identify trends that result in poor referring technique. Methods and Materials: For a two week period all inpatient electronically generated CT request were prospectively monitored. Outpatient & out-of-hour requests were excluded. Results: Out of a total of 126 requests, 102 were successfully audited (81%). The types of examinations included CT head 63 (62%), abdomen 19 (19%), thorax 13 (13%), abdomen and thorax 2 (2%), and musculoskeletal 2 (2%). Problems were encountered with 39 requests (38%). The most common problem encountered was that of inadequate or misleading information (n = 20). Others issues included better alternative examination (n = 2), undisclosed renal impairment (n = 4), failed examinations due to agitated patients (n = 2), ward cancellations (n = 4), requests without contact details (n = 7), and wrong ward details (n = 5). As a result 20 of these requests were not performed. The majority of these requests are completed by junior doctors. Conclusion: Vetting of CT requests is an essential first step towards a successful CT examination. The provision of inadequate clinical information is prevalent and junior doctors require closer supervision when completing CT requests.",

G\u00f3mez-Le\u00f3n; Madrid/ES Purpose: To assess the utility of multislice computed tomography (MSCT) in the diagnosis and follow-up of aortic dissection. Materials and Methods: Seventy-one patients referred to rule out aortic dissection underwent MSCT following a standardised protocol. The volume of interest was the entire aortoiliac system, 120 mL of non-ionic iodinated contrast were administered at a flow rate of 3 mL/sec. A collimation of 3 mm, table speed of 16 mm per rotation, pitch of 4 and reconstruction interval of 2 mm were used. Multiplanar (MPR) and three-dimensional reconstructions (external rendering) were obtained in a workstation (Vitrea 2; Vital Images Plymouth, Minn). Aortic dissection was diagnosed when an intimal flap separating the true and false lumen was observed. Patients diagnosed with aortic dissection underwent an endovascular repair (stentgraft placement). Follow-up CT examinations after endovascular repair were acquired with the same MSCT protocol, after performing a basal nonenhaced study. Complete closure of the entry site, and both stent-graft and visceral arterial branches patency were considered as adequate stent-graft function signs. Results: Nine of the 71 patients were diagnosed with aortic dissection (six acute and three chronic dissections), two of which involved the ascending aorta and seven the descending thoracic aorta. Follow-up demonstrated in all cases a residual abdominal aortic dissection with progressive decrease in size of the false lumen. Conclusion: MSCT determined the exact anatomy of the dissection flap, the location of the entry and reentry sites, and the major branch vessels that were supplied by the true lumen.",

Riera; Madrid/ES Learning Objectives: To assess the safety and efficacy of endovascular stentgraft placement for repairing descending thoracic aortic aneurysms in high-risk patients. To analyse the major associated complications. To show our experience in the management of these patients over a six-year period. Background: By helping patients avoid open surgery, endovascular aneurysm repair minimises the perioperative derangement of pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and gastrointestinal function. The greatest potential benefit is in high-risk patients who have large aneurysms and who are poorly suited to any of the current alternatives. Procedure Details: Endovascular aneurysm repair was performed in 39 highrisk patients who could not undergo conventional repair. The feasibility of endovascular treatment and the prosthesis' size was determined based on preoperative spiral CT and intraoperative angiography findings. Stent-grafts were surgically inserted through exposed femoral arteries with fluoroscopic guidance. The anaesthetic technique was either epidural or general. Endovascular grafts were constructed with Gianturco stents and polytetrafluoruroethylene (PTFE) graft. Stent-grafts were placed in 12 disecting, 21 atherosclerotic, five traumatic, and one post-coarctation descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. 68% of them were chronic. We analysed the results obtained in both stable patients, in which an elective treatment was performed of sacular, fusiform, traumatic and chronic dissection aneurysms, and in emergency patients (intramural bruise, penetrating ulcer, and aortic dissection). Conclusion: Endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic aneurysms offers considerable benefits. Long-term follow-up is needed to ascertain the durability of the procedure especially in dissecting aneurysms. An interdisciplinary and experienced team is needed to manage endovascular and surgical treatment.",

Thrombosis of the IVC secondary to benign causes is less common. Predisposing factors include pregnancy, connective tissues disorders and coagulation abnormalities. Recognition of caval thrombosis on ultrasound may be difficult. However, depiction of the IVC on both contrast-enhanced computerised tomography and MRI is more accurate. Although non-contrast MRI is useful for demonstrating IVC occlusion, contrast-enhanced MR venography offers the opportunity for rapid evaluation in a single breath-hold. Imaging Findings: The normal appearance of the IVC as demonstrated by MRI is illustrated, along with examples of IVC occlusion associated with both benign and malignant pathology. Simple rules for differentiating bland versus tumour thrombus are presented and illustrated. A method for optimising the timing of data acquisition for CE-MRA is presented. The merits of \"indirect\" versus \"direct\" IVC MR venography are also discussed. Finally, artefacts that may mimic IVC thrombus are described. Conclusion: MRI/MRA accurately evaluates the IVC. The multiplanar imaging capabilities, lack of ionising radiation, coupled with the added benefit gained from the use of intravenous gadolinium based contrast agents in MRA, makes MRI the modality of choice in evaluating patients with suspected IVC occlusion.",

            "text": "The aorta revisited: Spectrum of findings on helical CT A.J. Madureira, J.P. Jesus, J. Loureiro, I. Ramos; Porto/PT Learning Objectives: To review the imaging findings of the anatomical variants and disease processes that may affect the aorta from the aortic valve to the bifurcation. To describe the pitfalls that may be encountered. Background: Helical CT is a frequently used method in the evaluation of diseases affecting the aorta. It provides invaluable information in the assessment of acute aortic syndromes and is often employed in diagnosis and follow-up of dissection, aneurysm and bypass surgery. Procedure Details: The imaging findings of the diseases that may affect the aorta are presented based on the experience of our tertiary care hospital and level 1 trauma center. The anatomical variations of the aortic arch vessels, acute aortic syndromes, aneurysmal disease and aortic bypass surgery are discussed and illustrated thoroughly. Conclusion: Helical CT is a firstline imaging method in the evaluation of aortic disease due to it's widespread availability, good spatial resolution and speed. Learning Objectives: To illustrate the MR findings that differentiate severe carotid artery stenosis with a tiny residual distal lumen from patients with total carotid artery occlusion. Background: Due to the small but substantial stroke risk in patients undergoing digital subtraction angiography, contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (M.R.A.) has become the standard for evaluation of carotid occlusive disease in many centres. M.R.A. is highly accurate in differentiating significant stenosis (70%-99%) that requires carotid endarterectomy, from insignificant (< 70%) disease. M.R.A. is also highly accurate in differentiating severe stenosis from occlusion. However, demonstration of a string sign depends on careful interrogation of the source images as the residual patent lumen may not be visualised on standard maximum intensity projections. Given the clinical importance of differentiating between these two groups, we present and contrast the imaging findings of patients with significant carotid stenosis and those with total carotid artery occlusion. Imaging Findings: We describe the varied findings in both patients with total carotid artery occlusion and those with severe stenosis. We present a simple algorithm for rapid evaluation of patients referred for differentiation of severe stenosis from occlusion. Background: Anomalies of IVC and renal veins occur with a prevalence of 0.07% to 8.7%, and are easily identified on CT, frequently incidentally. If unidentified, they can be misinterpreted as pathology (adenomegaly, retroperitoneal masses, normal venous structures and/or collaterals during acquired obstruction) or can lead to morbidity during radiologic and surgical procedures (positioning IVC filters, varicocoele sclerotherapy, renal venous sampling, shunt placement for portal hypertension, liver or kidney transplantation, IVC ligation for thromboembolic disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair). We describe the CT findings in 48 cases of anomalies of the IVC and the LRV. Imaging Findings: 20 female and 28 male patients, aged 20-76 years, were studied. We found 4 anomalies of the suprarenal segment (interrupted IVC with azygos continuation), 26 anomalies of the renal segment (18 circumaortic LRV, 8 retroarotic LRV), and 18 anomalies of the infrarrenal segment (1 retrocaval ureter, 6 transposition of the IVC, and 11 duplications of the IVC). One patient with agenesis of the IVC with azygos continuation had profound venous thrombosis, and another had bronchiectasis. In any other case the anomaly was responsible for the patient's symptoms. Results: Mean size of the ascending aorta in these patients at initial presentation was 7.4 cm (range 5.0 to 12.5 cm). Dissection of the ascending aorta occurred in 50%. Median size of ascending aorta at time of dissection was 5.6 cm. All patients underwent surgery for their aneurysms. The postoperative mortality was 6.3%. We have compared the two groups of Marfan's syndrome patients whom had dissections: with an aortic-root diameter from 7.0 to 12.0 cm (70%) and with an aortic-root diameter from 5.0 to 7.0 cm (30%). There is correlation between the aortic-root diameter and the probability of aortic dissection. Analysis to isolate risk factors for dissection revealed that size larger than 6.0 cm increased the probability by 40%.",

Yucel, R. Albayrak; Afyon/TR Purpose: Vertebral artery hypoplasia (VAH) may be defined as VA flow volume below ~ 30 to 40 mL/min using color duplex sonography. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of VA hypoplasia on internal carotid artery (ICA) flow volume and cerebral blood flow (CBF) volume. Materials and Methods: In this study, 17 patients with VA hypoplasia and 20 control subjects with normal VA flow volume were enrolled. The patients and control subjects were 50-75 years of age. The ICA and VA flow volumes were determined by using color duplex sonography. Cerebral blood flow volume was calculated as sum of flow volumes in the ICA and VA of both sides. The ICA and CBF volumes of patients with VA hypoplasia were compared with control group flow volumes. Results: In VA hypoplasia and control group, there were no significant differences between ICA flow volumes of right and left sides (222 \u00b1 70 versus 260 \u00b1 87 mL/ min; p = 0.16 on the right side, 211 \u00b1 117 versus 236 \u00b1 73 mL/min; p = 0.45 on the left side) or sum of flow volumes of both ICA (434 \u00b1 144 versus 495 \u00b1 127 mL/ min; p = 0.18). However CBF volume tended to be lower in patients with VA hypoplasia than control group. Conclusion: Evaluation of CBF using color duplex sonography is noninvasive and easily applicable to all patients and provides valuable diagnostic data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating lower SBFV and normal ICA flow volume in patients with VA hypoplasia.",

We reviewed our series to assess the overall prevalence, specificity and diagnostic significance of this finding. Materials and Methods: In a 6 year period (from January 1997 to December 2002) we have evaluated with US, 388 consecutive patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (larger axial diameter of the aorta > 30 mm). Twenty-nine aneurysms were proven to be ruptured (sonographic and/or CT diagnosis) and were surgically confirmed. The remaining 359 patients were not symptomatic and were proven to have a non-ruptured aneurysm at follow-up. Results: A floating membrane was found in 8 out of 29 patients with ruptured aneurysm (28%) and in none of the subjects with non-ruptured aneurysm. The image appeared as a thick layer floating within the aneurysm lumen, clearly detached from a more or less eccentrically placed luminal thrombosis (present in all 8 cases), with a paradoxical movement unrelated to overall vessel pulsation.",

Detrano; Kopavogur/IS Purpose: Though demographic associates of coronary and abdominal aortic calcification in elderly persons are known, similar information about the thoracic aorta is not available. We developed a protocol for scanning the thoracic aorta from the aortic bulb to the descending aorta at the level of the cardiac apex. Methods and Materials: Computed tomographic images were acquired with a Siemens Sensation 4 scanner, using sequential mode and prospective ECG gating. The CT images were processed using calcium scoring software for coronary arteries, which is modified in order to label areas and quantify calcium in the thoracic aorta. The thoracic aorta is divided into three segments: arch, ascending, and descending. These segments are labeled and calcium within them quantified and results expressed in Agatston scores. Results: Agatston scores were acquired from 676 individuals (263 men, 413 women) with an age range of 66-92 (mean 75) years. There was a 34% increase (95%CI: 22%-45%) in the total Agatston score for every 5 years of age for men, and 49% (95%CI: 40%-58%) for women. There was no significant difference between men and women in the age group 66-70 and, men in the age group 85+ had significantly lower scores than women. Conclusion: A robust method for quantifying calcium in the thoracic aorta has been established. Age and gender distributions of thoracic aortic calcification in the elderly show strong age dependance for both genders but significantly stronger for women than for men.

Morphological findings were correlated by DSA, surgery or post-mortem. Results: There were 10 AR, 8 AF (4 tracheobronchial, 3 oesophageal, 1 duodenal), 17 CAP (4 AT, 7 AD, 6 RAU) and 5 RAAE. CTA was diagnostic in all cases except five AF: four were diagnosed by DSA, one at post-mortem. In 34 cases, CTA correctly determined the decision of patient management. One separate vertebral artery origin was missed. Two patients died before surgery. 36 patients underwent emergency repair (22 surgical, 14 endovascular); two were observed. Five thoracic AF were treated by endovascular repair, two by surgery, one infradiaphragmatic AF by surgery. Conclusion: CTA is valuable for diagnosing aortic and supraaortic emergencies and determining their treatment. However, in suspected AF complementation by DSA is usually required.",

Influence of PAT on slice thickness, image matrix, total examination time, and image quality are discussed. Results: Phase contrast acquisitions are extremely helpful in evaluating flow patterns in the renal arteries, and offer unique information about the flow velocity patterns. PAT using SENSE reconstruction algorithm leads faster 3D MRA acquisitions. This results in, not only shortening the examination time, but also shortening the breath-hold time, and providing better image quality due to decreased motion artifacts.

Aim of this study is to evaluate onset of early atherosclerotic changes of epiaortic vessels in HIV positive patients, treated with PI. Purpose: Hematoporphyrin (HP) accumulates in arteriosclerosis selectively and shows specific fluorescence spectrum change in accordance with the stages of the sclerosis, and this fact is under discussion as to its availability to diagnosis and therapy. We paid our attention to the fact that HP accumulates in the interface of swollen collagen type IV and lipid. We assumed such a model of atheroma, and we examined the possibility of a photodynamic therapy for arteriosclerosis using collagen type IV and phosphatidyl choline liposome. Material and Method: We added HP to collagen type IV, then the liposome containing cholesterol to the mixture, and examined the agglutination state of the protein-lipid complex. Afterwards, we irradiated that complex with LED pulse of 680nm for one hour, and examined scattered spectroscopy, interference spectroscopy using 680nm semiconductor laser and high sensitivity CCD in order to observe the HP and the agglutination state of complex, and, then, analyzed the alteration of protein-lipid complex in terms of Fourier analysis. Result: HP gave influence to the various state of assembly of protein-lipid complex. In addition, protein-lipid integration state was changed by the irradiation of light pulse and the change of scattered light that signifies the state of dispersion was observed.",

The acquired data yields three images: A standard chest radiograph, a soft-tissue image with the bones removed, and a bone image. In this work, this new technique is presented and first applications are illustrated. Materials and Methods: Dual energy imaging enables the acquisition of two posterior-anterior X-ray images of the chest separated by approximately 200 milliseconds. Information from the high-energy image (110-150 kVp; the same image as a standard posterior-anterior chest X-ray exam) is combined with information from the low energy image (60-80 kVp) to generate bone and softtissue images. Results: Two main applications are shown: Evaluation of calcified or non-calcified lesions by comparing the soft tissue image with the bone image, and detection of pleural diseases on the soft tissue image. Occasionally, traumatic costal lesions can also be accurately detected. These points are illustrated by several clinical cases. Conclusion: The dual energy technique gives more information than a standard chest X-ray, and can be useful in some clinical applications.

Trinidad; Vigo/ES Learning Objectives: To describe 16-MDCT indications with three dimensional volume rendering (3D-VR) in the thoracic venous system. To illustrate its anatomy and recognize its most frequent pathology. Background: With the development of the angio-CT techniques the pulmonary and systemic arterial systems of the thorax has been appropriately focused. Less attention has been paid to the venous systems, because the disorders of these venous systems usually have an indolent clinical presentation. In this exhibit we describe the use of 16-MDCT and 3D-VR imaging in the study of the venous thoracic structures. Procedure Details: 42 patients with several thoracic diseases underwent routine CT angiography with a 16-MDCT (Somaton Sensation 16) using a 16 x 0.75 collimation were studied. Venous opacification was provided by automated injection of 100 mL of contrast material at 3 -4 mL/s. Scan delay was 24 -30 seconds. Slice reconstruction was performed at 1 mm thickness and increment 0.5 mm. VR images were reconstructed at a workstation (Wizard, Siemens). Jugular, subclavian, brachiocephalic, thoracic, superior and inferior vena cavae, azygos, hemiazygos, cardiac and intercostals veins were the structures most easily observed. Congenital variants and pathologic disorders were also studied. Conclusion: 16-MDCT and 3D-VR images are excellent techniques to study in vivo the anatomy and the pathology of the systemic veins in the thorax.C-337Imaging findings of superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction: A pictorial review P.R. Healey, A.E. Healey, E. O'Grady, J. Curtis; Liverpool/UK Learning Objectives: The superior vena cava syndrome is characterised by oedema of the face, neck, thorax and upper limbs associated with an intractable headache. It is often associated with tortuous dilated veins across the chest wall. The causes can be subdivided into extrinsic and intrinsic causes of occlusion, thrombosis and infiltration. Many of these clinical findings are evident on radiological imaging. Background: The superior vena cava is the main route of drainage of blood from the head, neck and the upper limbs. There are other routes of drainage should the superior vena cava become obstructed. These depend on the site of obstruction and the length of vessel occlusion. The azygos system is a common path of collateralisation. Other rarer collateral roots include the pericardial veins, the neck and subcutaneous veins. Imaging Findings: We demonstrate some common causes of superior vena cava obstruction, their findings on CT and angiography. Examples of the radiological treatment of superior vena cava obstruction are also shown. Conclusion: The finished poster illustrates the imaging findings and the radiological treatment of superior vena cava obstruction.",

To illustrate appearances of post surgical failures and recurrences. Background: Pelvic floor dysfunction in the female is a common condition, favored by dystocia, menopause and ageing. The scope of interventions to treat pelvic floor dysfunction in its different compartments is rapidly expanding with new surgical techniques and new materials. Magnetic resonance imaging, with static and dynamic sequences, is now commonly used in the preoperative assessment of the different pelvic compartments. More generally radiologists performing pelvic MRI are commonly faced with post surgical aspects. It is then of utmost importance that radiologists be able to identify those post surgical normal and abnormal (failures and recurrences) patterns. Material and Methods: Through a prospective and retrospective review of 450 pelvic MRI examinations performed before and after surgical treatment of pelvic floor disorders, the authors identify and illustrate the normal and abnormal appearances after a variety of treatments: Intravaginal devices, tension free vaginal tape with its various approaches (retro pubic, prepubic, trans obturator), suspensions, fixations, use of different types of meshes, surgical correction in the anterior, middle and posterior compartments.

For quantitative parameters, the following were examined by a consensus of two radiologists: ER (enhancement ratio) 1: (SI1-SI0)/SI0, ER2: (SI2-SI0)/SI0, ER3: (SI3-SI0)/SI0, ER2-1: ER2-ER1, ERmax, SAT: SI1/SI max. Analysis of variance was used to identify significant differences in quantitative parameters among tumors. Results: The tumors were specified as leiomyoma(38)(T2w-hyper [LM-hyper]: 11, T1w-hypo [LM-hypo]: 27), leiomyosarcoma (LMS)(7), adenomyosis (ADM)(3), fibromyoma (FM)(1), cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (17), endometrial adenocarcinoma (EC) (18), postmolar gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) (6), malignant melanoma of the cervix (MM) (1). The types of dynamic curves were early enhancement and washout (GTD, MM), early enhancement and no washout (EC, SCC, LMS), delayed enhancement (LM-hyper, LM-hypo, ADM, FM). In these tumors, there were statistically significant differences in various parameters between the following tumors (p < 0.05): GTD vs other tumors (ER1, ER2, ER3, ER2-3), SCC vs EC (ER3), SCC vs LM-hyper (ER2-3), SCC vs LM-hypo (ER1, ER2, ER2-3, SAT), EC vs LM-hyper (ER2-3), EC vs LM-hypo (ER2-3, ER1-3, SAT), EC vs LMS (ER1), LM-hypo vs LMS (ER1, ER2-3, ER1-3, SAT). Conclusion: Analysis of various parameters using Gd-enhanced dynamic MRI with 3D-FLASH technique was useful to determine the characteristics of uterine tumors.

Pozzi Mucelli; Trieste/IT Learning Objectives:To describe different macroscopic and microscopic components observed in solid and cystic renal tumours which present a correlation with imaging procedures. Background: The identification of macroscopic and microscopic features in renal tumours is essential for correct characterization. Macroscopic features such as site, morphology, margins, pseudocapsule, gross necrotic and cystic changes present a clear impact on staging and therapeutic approach. Microscopic intratumoural components, often commisted, present a more complex correlation with ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Different microscopic intratumoral components: 1) Cellular (high cellularity and high nucleus cytoplasm N/C ratio with low quantity of extracellular matrix; mid or low cellularity, mid or low N/C and high quantity of extracellular matrix); 2) Stromal (fibrotic, fibrovascular, fibromyxoid); 3) Necrotic (coagulative, colliquative, haemorrhagic); 4) Vascular related to neoangiogenesis; 5) Calcific; 6) Adipose; and 7) Cystic, may be identified on the basis of their appearance on US, CT and MRI.

The cases presented a pathologic process of the retro-extraperitoneal space with extension in both the retroperitoneal space and the pelvis. The selection were based on the demonstration of the renal fasciae on the CT images by thickening or by propagation of fluid along the fascial planes. Results: The perinephric space is closed caudally.

Background: Transrectal sonography of the prostate gives us an accurated anatomic definition of the prostate and its anatomic relationships with adjacent structures. Its ability enables good characterization of echotexture, localization and vascularization of these lesions. Our study is a review of cystic lesions which are classified depending on its location (medial or lateral cysts), origin (congenital or acquired cysts) and related complications. Materials and Methods: Sonograms were obtained by using real-time, direct transrectal scanning with a 6 MHz convex endorectal transducer. Examinations were conducted with patients in the left lateral decubitus position with the hips fully flexed. Detailed examinations of the prostate and the seminal vesicles were routinely performed in both the sagittal and axial planes and also using color and power Doppler. Results: Of 200 transrectal sonographic examinations performed between January 2001 and February 2002, 21 were found to have cystic lesions: 7 of them were congenital cysts (2 m\u00fcllerian duct cysts and 5 utricular cysts) and 14 were acquired cystic lesions (10 cyst > 1 cm related with changes of benign prostatic hyperplasia, 2 prostatic cystic carcinoma, 1 prostatic abscess and 1 spermatocele).

To evaluate the effectiveness of urographic and pyelographic MR sequences in the diagnosis of urinary tract neoplasia. Background: Conventional excretory urography (CU) and computed tomography (CT) were considered the standard techniques used to examine patients with urinary tract neoplasia. Recently, conventional, urographic and pyelographic MR exams have been performed in patients with urinary tract disease. Imaging Findings: 20 pts with 21 transitional cell carcinomas were analysed. 13/20 patients underwent CU and 10/20 a CT scan. All patients underwent MRpyelographic (3D-TSE T2w), MR-urographic (ce 3D-GRE T1w) and conventional morphologic sequences (GRE T1w, TSE T2w and ce dynamic FS-GRE T1w). A) Neoplastic lesions were visualised as solid papillomas in 12/21 cases, as thickening of the wall of collecting system in 7/21 cases and as solid tissue in the renal sinus in 2 cases; B) Lesions were more evident on TSE T2w, ce FS-GRE T1w and MR-urographic images; C) Lesions resulted quite vascularized; D) Urinary tract dilatation was evaluated in 17/20 patients.

This exhibit illustrates CT features of adrenal incidentalomas (myelolipoma, adrenal haemorrhage, adrenal adenomas and adrenal metastasis) Procedure Details:The detection of an incidentaloma at abdominal computed tomography (CT), except in the presence of CT features that permit a specific diagnosis, becomes a problem in the differentiation of benign from malignant incidentalomas. A value of 10 Hounsfield units or less on nonenhanced CT represent essentially lipid-rich adrenal adenomas. There are two limitations to this characterization: Incidentalomas initially detected on enhanced CT and lipid-poor adrenal adenomas. The relative enhancement washout on enhanced CT permit then the lesion to be characterized as benign or malignant by using a threshold of 50% washout on a 10-minute-delayed enhanced CT. Conclusion: Limitations of this characterization are only for benign pheochromocytomas and atypical adrenal cortical carcinomas.C-461Urogenital anatomy, as seen in the anatomic waxes of the museum \"La Specola\" L.E.

The extraperitoneal spaces are divided into separate anatomic compartments thus assisting in the understanding of containment and spread . The anatomy of the abdominal retroperitonem is well documented.However less is known about the pelvic extraperitoneal spaces. Learning Objectives: To determine perirenal communication with pelvic extraperitoneal spaces, and pelvic extraperitoneal communication with themselves and with abdominal retroperitoneal spaces. Procedure Details: Under CT guidance contrast was injected into 8 embalmed cadavers into the perirenal space. In a second study contrast was injected into pelvic extraperitoneal spaces (prevesical in 4, perivesical in 2 and perirectal in 2). CT parameters included: Axial imaging, 3 mm slice thickness, pitch 2, mAs 240, kVp 120, allowing sagittal and coronal reconstruction. Axial images and reconstructions were reviewed to determine flow pathways of contrast material and compared with anatomic dissection. Post perirenal injection communication was seen between the perirenal and pelvic extraperitoneal spaces in all cadavers. Post pelvic extraperitoneal space injection communication between pelvic extraperitoneal spaces readily occurs. In particular the perirectal space communicates with the other pelvic extraperitoneal spaces. Free communication between the pelvic extraperitoneal spaces and the abdominal retroperitoneal spaces also occurs.Conclusion: Intercommunication occurs both between the various pelvic extraperitoneal spaces and with abdominal retroperitoneal spaces.

Guardia Mas, C. Casta\u00f1o Duque; Barcelona/ES Learning Objectives: To define and analyze the radiological spectrum of inner ear anomalies in patients with congenital neurosensorial hearing loss (NSHL) Background: According to the literature, 20% of patients with NSHL have radiological visible abnormalities of the inner ear. Based on radiological findings, it is possible to make a classification of the type of malformation and the moment at which such malformation occurred. CT gives great definition of the changes in the osseous otic capsule, whereas MR allows evaluation of the membranous otic capsule as well as the status of the acoustic nerve, very important if a cochlear implant is contemplated. We have studied 200 patients with NSHL by CT and/or MR, finding a whole spectrum of malformations of the inner ear, except for complete aplasia. Imaging Findings: We intend to show the normal anatomy of the inner ear with CT and MR, as well as classification of all types of malformations found in 50 patients (25% of 200). The most frequent one is dilatation of the vestibular aqueduct (20 patients). Different kinds of cochlear anomalies were found in 16 patients. The remaining 14 patients presented anomalies of the posterior labyrinth, round window and modiolus. Conclusion: CT and MR are complementary studies that allow exact diagnosis of inner ear malformations and the status of the acoustic nerve which explains the associated hearing loss. These findings are important to establish a prognosis and the possibility of a cochlear implant. C-478 The diagnostic value of diffusion coefficient in the characterization of parotid tumors A.

Claussen, M.D. Seemann; T\u00fcbingen/DE Purpose: To compare high resolution MRI of the inner ear structures at 1.5 T and at 3.0 T using completely re-phased gradient-echo sequences (CISS). Material and Methods: A pilot study was carried out in 3 healthy volunteers using whole body MR units with 40 mT/m gradient systems and the standard head coils. At 1.5 T, the sequence parameters were: 3D-CISS, flip angle 70\u00b0, TR = 9.27 ms, TE = 4.64 ms, read-out bandwidth: 197 Hz/pixel, resolution: 0.39 x 0.39 x 0.4 mm 3 (256 x 256 matrix with 100 mm FOV, 50% phase oversampling, no k-space filter), slab thickness 25.6 mm / 64 slices, 1 average, measuring time: 7:37 min. At 3.0 T, the flip angle had to be reduced to 42\u00b0 in normal SAR mode. SNR was determined from the original axial slices. MIP reconstructions were performed. Results and Discussion: The signal characteristics of the inner ear require a high flip angle (T2-->T1, flip angle--> 90\u00b0). Despite the sub-optimal flip angle at 3.0 T, considerably better SNR (1.34-fold) was achieved in the same measuring time. Negative effects of field inhomogeneities were not observed at 3.0 T. Thus, an excellent delineation of the internal structures was achieved.",

Two factors are probably the cause of neuropathy development: primary (direct) like nerve laceration / partial disruption, or secondary (indirect) namely vascular factors. Purpose: The aim of the study was to evaluate blood flow parameters in ocular vessels (ophthalmic artery, central retinal artery, short posterior ciliary arteries) in patients with traumatic optic neuropathy. Material: Examined group consisted of 34 patients (4F, 30M), aged 14-70. Method: All patients were examined ophthalmologically. Radiological procedures included: X-ray, CT, US (B-mode and color Doppler). For ultrasound examinations 7.5 and 9 MHz linear array transducers were used. Results: Blood flow parameters in the ophthalmic artery and posterior ciliary arteries were similar compared to the control group. Abnormalities were observed in the central retinal artery: In 8 patients (25%) blood flow was not detected and in 18 (56%) blood flow velocities were signifficantly decreased. Normal blood flow parameters in the central retinal artery were found only in 6 patients. Conclusions: 1. Color Doppler sonography is a useful technique in diagnosing traumatic optic neuropathy. 2. Our results confirm that vascular factors may play a main role in the pathogenesis of traumatic optic neuropathy.",

Material and Methods: Forty-six patients (55 eyes) with different orbital and optical diseases. Results: US-examination of the eyebulbs was done using gray-scale US with color and power Doppler, 3D power Doppler angio-reconstruction and 3D volumetric US. In all patients with detached retina, the combination of 3D regimes allowed assessment of the form and spatial topography of the detached retina. The adjacency of retina at the place of the scleral sealing was revealed at the postoperative period. In the case of detached choroid, volumetric topography was studied, the sites of subchoroidal hemorrhages were detected and the spatial correlation of choroid and retina was observed. Choroid melanoma was assessed in terms of location, the vessel inside, the connection between the lesion and the choroid and the type of the \"vessels map\".

To investigate the usefulness of CT and MR image fusion of these examinations. Methods and Materials: Spiral CT (sCT) and MR postsurgery images were obtained in 27 patients after orbital wall fractures. The globe was supported with polypropylene texture or titanic mesh. Volumetric acquisition of spiral CT and MR images were obtained in the same coronal planes. Images of both the modalities were analysed separately by two experienced radiologists according to the quality of visualisation of the implanted grafts. The second focus of evaluation was to assess image artefacts caused by the alloplastic material within the surrounding structures. The sCT and MR images digital fusion of all the examinations was applied. Results: In all the patients the sCT scans showed titanium mesh clearly with no significant artifacts. The MR images in all those cases revealed only an area of metal-artifact, but surrounding tissues could be satisfactorily evaluated. The fused CT and MR images well depicted an implant on the background of soft tissues. The polypropylene texture was not well visualized either by sCT or MR examination. Conclusion: Titanium implant could be only visualized using CT but the intraorbital soft tissues were better depicted in MR. Their digital fusion unified the advantages of both the modalities.

Methods and Materials: From April to July 2003, FUS was performed in the 20 patients (age range, 34-55 years) with symptomatic uterine fibroids in Japan. The selection of the patients was performed according to our therapy-requirements for FUS. Written informed consent was obtained form all patients. The treatment was performed with a 1.5-T MR imaging system (Signa; GE medicals systems, Milwaukee Wis) and a MR imaging-compatible focused ultrasound system (Exablte 2000; Insightic-TxSonics, Haifa, Israel). Eight patients complained of hypermenorrhea. Seventeen patients complained of the bulk-related symptoms, such as frequency of urination, sensation of pressure, or sensation of mass. The improvement of clinical symptoms was assessed by questionnaire and follow-up MR imaging was performed a month after the FUS. Results: Nineteen of the 20 patients had technically successful procedures and were interviewed a month after FUS. 6 (75%) of 8 patients reported improvement in hypermenorrhea. 12 (71%) of the 17 patients with bulk-related symptoms reported improvement in these symptoms. Follow-up MR imaging showed a mean 10% reduction in uterine fibroids volume. A patient experienced a second-degree skin burn as a complication.Conclusion:The uterine fibroids to be treated by FUS are limited, but FUS is an effective and safe therapy in the management of symptomatic uterine fibroids.

Methods and Materials: 289 patients with superficial venous malformation were in the care in our service. 3 of them presented with cavernomas, 1 with Maffuci's syndrome and 10 with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. The lesions were cervical and cerebral in 76% of cases; thoracic and abdominal in 24% of cases. Lesion envolvement was evaluated by CT scan (n = 20) and MRI (n = 10). The approaches were: abstention because of iatrogenic risk or small lesions (n = 61), elastic contention (n = 11), only surgery (n = 5), one to four sessions of percutaneous sclerotherapy only (n = 172) and followed by surgery (n = 40). Results: There was clear regression in 60% of patients treated exclusively by sclerotherapy. Among the 40 patients treated by both sclerotherapy and surgery good results were obtained in 80% of cases. Conclusion: The management of superficial vascular malformations needs a multidsciplinary approach. Percutaneous sclerotherapy is the first choice treatement, which can be followed by surgery.C-569Long nitinol stent-method of choice for bending area of peripheral vessels: Animal study A. Nikanorov, J. Harrison, D. LaFlash; Santa Clara, CA/US Purpose: To evaluate the performance of various length nitinol stents in the femoral artery and otbtain a risk determination of stent migration and/or stenosis in the bending areas of the vessel.Methods and Materials:A retrospective review of a study in which 18 porcine femoral arteries (n = 9 pigs) were implanted with nitinol self-expanding stents (n = 29) was carried out. Stent lengths were 28 to 100 mm. Stents were implanted separately and overlapped in the distal iliac and superficial femoral artery (SFA). Angiographies were performed during hip flexion/extension post-implant and at 3 and 28 days. Results: Angiography during hip flexion showed significant bending in common femoral/proximal SFA, mild bending along the length of the SFA, no bending in iliac and deep femoral arteries. Follow-up results were constant and depended on stent length and location. Short stent 28 mm in iliac and deep femoral arteries showed no adverse effect; in common femoral and SFA demonstrated stent migration, arterial kinking at the stent's edge, severe stenosis, and separation of overlapped stents. Medium stents 38 and 56 mm in iliac/proximal SFA migrated; moderate stenosis observed. Long stent 100 mm covered the bending area of the SFA and bent along with the artery. There was no migration or stenosis. Conclusion: Long stent may be a method of choice for SFA. Short stent can cause arterial kinking and lumen obliteration. To prevent stenosis and stent migration avoid implanting stent with the edge in the area of arterial bending. Porcine femoral artery may represent worst-case model for stent evaluation in peripheral vasculature.C-570Our experience with endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm with the Talent stent-graft J.

Krimmer; Bad Neustadt a. d. Saale/DEPurpose: Morphological assessment of the scaphoid nonunion (pseudarthrosis) by means of high resolution multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). Methods and Materials: 769 patients suffering from radial-sided wrist pain were examined with a multislice CT (SOMATON Plus 4, Volume Zoom, Siemens, Erlangen) in a specially for the scaphoid designed scan plane and protocol. A 2 x 0.5 mm collimation with an increment of 0.3 mm along the scaphoid long axis (oblique sagittal) in spiral technique (FOV 60 mm) and a coronal reconstruction (MPR) is recommended. Results: Out of the 769 patients 217 presented a scaphoid nonunion. The remaining cases showed either an acute fracture, were postoperative follow-ups or were inconspicuous. The following anatomical and morphological changes were depicted. They correspond to the staging of scaphoid pseudarthrosis: Stage I: resorption zone with widening of the fracture line, a) without b) with fragment dislocation. Stage II: cystic transformation extending into both fragments, a) without b) with carpal instability. Stage III: sclerotic fracture surfaces, a) without b) with carpal instability. Stage IV: secondary osteoarthritis, a) without b) with carpal collapse. Conclusion: High resolution MDCT provides a superior anatomical and morphological assessment of scaphoid pseudarthrosis. The spatial resolution as well as the z-axis coverage is excellent, the thin collimation and optimal overlap allows an ideal data set for multiplanar imaging. Thus MDCT is the imaging modality of choice: \u2022 In detecting and staging of scaphoid non-union. \u2022 In assessing early periscaphoidal osteoarthritis. \u2022 And finally, for the postoperative clinical management.",

Material and Methods: Material comprises 7 patients operated due to progressive scoliosis with the Cotrel's method, which consist in putting on the bone grafts taken from fibula and iliac crest on the vertebral arches and intervertebral joints, was used up to early 80 s and was replaced with the Harringthon's procedure. Examinations were performed 21 -36 years after the procedure, in 2 mm thick axial sections. 3D reconstructions were performed with the bone threshold (150 HU). The spatial images were assessed in real time in any desired external and internal projections. Results: In all cases the bone grafts were well accreted with the vertebral arches, forming the single bone segment. The vertebral bodies show different degree of mineralization. The parts of the vertebral bodies on the bulging side of the scoliosis show the presence of multiple and large pseudo-foramens, resulting from intense osteoporosis of those vertebral parts. The parts of vertebral bodies on the concave parts of the scoliosis show real, intense mineralization. The width of the spinal canal and vertebral foramens remain unchanged. Conclusions: 3D CT is valuable in imaging the spine after operations of the scoliosis with the Cotrel's method. The altered force vectors in the operated spine cause the presence of the pseudo-foramens. This is a good model of the late results assessment of posterior spondylodesis.",

Background: After intraarticular injection of Gd-DTPA under fluoroscopic guidance, eight shoulder specimens were investigated with standard MR-sequences with 1.5 T (T1w, with and without fat-saturation). An axial, a paracoronal and a plane parallel to the intraarticular portion of the long biceps tendon (\"parabicipital\") were chosen. The specimens were cryosectioned in the parabicipital plane and photodocumented. Imaging Findings: Identical correlative sections between MR-arthrography and cryosectional surface of intersection showed two cases of pathological superior labral-bicipital complex. Two specimens appeared normal and four as norm-variants. Conclusion: MR-arthrography provides detailed information about superior labral-bicipital complex.

Bondioni; Brescia/IT Purpose: To investigate the role of unenhanced and enhanced MR imaging (MRI) in acute undisplaced fractures of the scaphoid and to correlate MRI with the radiological features in order to predict union/nonunion and recovery time. Materials and Methods: 27 consecutive patients with acute scaphoid fractures (1-10 days) were prospectively examined with conventional plane film and unenhanced/enhanced Gd-DTPA MRI. MR examination considered: a. Site and type of fractures (according to Herbert and Fisher 1996 classification). b. Signal intensity and vascular status at the level of the fracture and proximal fragment. c. Qualitative evaluation of enhancement.Results: On plain films all fractures were detected and well described. On unenhanced MRI in only 9/24 patients the fracture line was detected, hypointense on T1w images and hyperintense on T2w images. In 15/24 patients the line fracture was not recognized, due to ill defined hypointensity on T1w and hyperintensity on T2w images astride the fractures site. In one patient diffuse hypointensity involved the proximal fragment. After Gd-DTPA administration, performed in 18/24 cases, the bone marrow showed significant and homogeneous enhancement in 13/18, weak and heterogeneous in 5/18. 4/5 patients with weak heterogeneous enhancement and 5/13 patients with intense and homogeneous enhancement showed delayed radiological and clinical recovery.

Drevelegas; Thessaloniki/GR Purpose: To identify the diagnostic value of the relationship between soft tissue tumors and the superficial fascia in the distinction of benign and malignant lesions. Material and Methods: From a group of 124 soft tissue tumors lesions located either subcutaneously or deeply and having contact with the fascia were selected. The study group was composed of 70 tumors (31 benign and 39 malignant).MR studies were performed with 0.5 and 1.5 units. MR images were obtained with T1-weghted and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences in at least two planes. STIR sequences and post -gadolinium T1-weighted images were also obtained. The relationship between tumor and the superficial fascia (minimal or widely fascial contact, acute or obtuse angles, crossing the fascia) were examined by masking the pathologic confirmation. The linear extension of the tumor along the fascia also known as fascial tail sign was also examined. Results: Of the 70 tumors, 20 (16 benign and 4 malignant) showed minimal fascial contact with acute angle with the fascia. 14 (9 benign and 5 malignant) showed wider fascial contact with acute angles. 36 tumors (6 benign and 30 malignant) had wider contact with obtuse angles with the fascia. 2O of them (all malignant) crossed the fascia from either side. Of the 36 lesions 21 lesions (3 benign and 18 malignant) had positive fascial tail sign. Conclusion: Obtuse angles between superficial fascia and soft tissue tumor, a tumor crossing the fascia and the presence of fascial tail sign strongly suggest malignancy.",

Familiarization with the Tile and Young Burgess classifications of pelvic fractures and their correlation with CT. 2. Describe the technical procedure of CT guided percutaneous fixation of pelvic fractures. 3. To evaluate the usefulness of CT imaging in the diagnosis of occult and stress pelvic fractures. Background: Pelvic fractures are a common and often life threatening result of major trauma. The importance of pelvic fractures lie in potential osseous and ligamentous instability and the vascular pelvic injury associated. Fracture classifications are useful to the surgeon as a means to determine pelvic stability. The Tile and Young Burgess classifications are the most widely accepted by orthopedic surgeons. CT scan has become an essential element in the orthopedic management of pelvic fractures. Also it can be useful to diagnose and locate active pelvic hemorrhage. In addition CT guided fixation of reducible sacral fractures and sacroiliac joint disruptions is a safe alternative to open reduction and internal fixation. Finally CT is helpful for confirming the presence of occult pelvic fractures with emphasis on insufficiency fractures. Procedure: Six years retrospective study of 279 patients who underwent CT for a pelvic injury at a level 1 trauma center. The more characteristics CT findings of pelvic fractures were described.

Materials and Methods: We compared the results of postoperative MDCTA and DSA in 38 patients.In 18 of all, MDCTA was performed with 16-channel MDCT, in 20 with 4-channel MDCT, and in 2 with both of them. Two radiologists blinded to the results of DSA evaluated the presence of residual sac of aneurysm. The ability of MDCTA to discriminate between surgical clips and branching vessels, and the presence of vasospasm were evaluated with 3-and 4-point scale, respectively. Results: Fifty-two surgically clipped aneurysms were evaluated in this study. The separability of MDCTA was graded as good in 25, fair in 16, and poor in 11 cases. But in the cases with 16-channel MDCTA, it was graded as good in 19, fair in 3, and poor in 2 cases. Among three residual aneurysms confirmed by DSA, two were accurately diagnosed by 16-channel MDCTA, and one was missed by 4channel MDCTA. In addition, 4-channel MDCTA showed one false positive result of residual sac, which was confirmed to be a turning vessel on DSA. MDCTA detected vasospasm in 22 patients, but MDCTA tended to overestimate the degree of vasospasm in 9 of 10 discordant cases. Conclusion: Sixteen-channel MDCTA showed good ability to discriminate between surgical clips and branching vessels, and was able to accurately diagnose the presence of residual sac. Because of the tendency of overestimation, vasospasm must be diagnosed carefully only by the results of MDCTA.C-749Brainsurface rendering image of cortical dysplasia G.-H. Chung, Y.-M. Han, S.-Y.

Methods and Materials: In 65 people (59 men, 6 women, 15-72 years old), ordered by the law court in course of action for murder, CT of brain was performed. Measurements of ventricular system, skull vault and external CSF spaces were performed and values of indexes as: frontal horn index, Evans index, ventricular index, sella media index and Huckman number were calculated. Average values of measurements and indexes were calculated separately for four groups of age (up to 20, 21-40, 41-60 and from 61). Results were compared to norms of physiological brain ageing according to Meese with Kusmiderski's modifications. Results: Cortical atrophy in examined murderers, exceeding physiological values was observed only in the group up to 20 years old. Subcortical atrophy, exceeding physiological values was observed in groups up to 20 and to a lesser extent 21-40 years old. Values of frontal horn index and Huckman number, corresponding to frontal lobes atrophy, exceeded physiological values in groups up to 20 and to a lesser extent 21-40 years old. Conclusion: Cerebral atrophy, particularly subcortical frontal lobes atrophy, exceeding physiological values, indicating characteropathy as one of potential reasons for aggressive behaviour, was statistically significant in people up to 40 years old, however in people above 40 years old it did not differ from normal values.C-762Diffusion-weighted MR imaging of acute cerebral infarctions in patients with middle cerebral artery stenosis N.

Alorainy; Riyadh/SA Learning Objectives: This educational exhibit provides a comprehensive review of imaging findings of lesions of the spinal epidural space on different imaging modalities and an approach to the differential diagnosis based on these findings. Background: Spinal epidural space can be involved in several disease conditions, the distinction between which is highly dependent on knowledge of regional anatomy and disease pattern on imaging. Management (medical or surgical) of the spinal epidural lesions is highly dependent on correct radiologic diagnosis. Imaging Findings: Many diseases can involve the spinal epidural space, either as primary lesions of this space or as an extension from a disease process in the neighbourhood. For sake of easy and accurate interpretation, the lesions of the spinal epidural space were classified etiologically/pathologically to degenerative, inflammatory/infective, neoplastic, traumatic/iatrogenic, hematologic/vascular and miscellaneous lesions. Both CT and MRI have crucial role in imaging of spinal epidural abnormalities. Conclusion: The spinal epidural space is a site for several primary and secondary diseases. Distinction between lesions of this space is helped by good knowledge of the spectrum of imaging findings of the abnormal spinal epidural space.C-766Axial DW-EPI study of biexponential water diffusion in human cervical spinal cord A. Jasinski 1 , B. Tomasz 1 , M. Konopka 2 , P. Pieniazek 2 , M. Hartel 2 , T. Skorka 1 , W.P. Weglarz 1 ; 1 Krakow/PL, 2 Katowice/PL Introduction: Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has a limited role in spinal cord studies due to technical difficulties. Recent studies have shown that at high bvalues, diffusion in the brain and in the animal spinal cord presents a biexponential decay corresponding to fast and slow diffusion components, due to water properties in various compartments of the nervous tissue. To the best of our knowledge DWI of human cervical spinal cord (CSC) at high b-values has not been published so far. We report results of transverse diffusion studies in the CSC at high b-values using single shot axial DW-EPI.Methods and Materials:This study was conducted on 12 healthy volunteers. MR and DW images were acquired on1.5 T system, with b = 450, 600, 750, 900,  1200, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000 s/mm 2 . Values of ADT were determined for different ROI in the white (WM) and gray matter (GM) by fitting the signal decay for different b after TE correction. Results: Good quality DWI were recorded for all b-values. The average values of diffusion components in the ventral horn in GM were: D f = (1.11 \u00b1 0.17) 10 -3 mm 2 / s, A f = 0.54 \u00b1 0.07, D s = (0.14 \u00b1 0.03)10 -3 mm 2 /s, A s = 0.46 \u00b1 0.07. For WM in the posterior funiculus the corresponding values were: D f = (1.35 \u00b1 0.55)10 -3 mm 2 /s, A f = 0.74 \u00b1 0.07, D s = 0.08 \u00b1 0.02)10 -3 mm 2 /s, as = 0.26 \u00b1 0.07. Obtained data presents bi-exponential dependence of diffusion parameters on b value.",

Barxias Mart\u00edn, R. de la C\u00e1mara Llanza; Madrid/ES Objective: To show the neuroimaging features of central nervous system complications in oncohematologic neoplasms.Material and Methods:The neuroimaging features in patients with oncohematologic neoplasms who presented with central nervous system complications in the last five years in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Results: The main neuroimaging features in oncohematologic neoplasms with central nervous system complications have been classified into four main categories: 1) Neoplasm disease: Primary and secondary neoplasms involving the parenchyma and the meninges. 2) Infections: Abscess, meningitis and sinusitis are frequents in the evolution of these patients, most of them immunodeppressed due to their primary disease or secondary to the therapy. 3) Hematologic complications: Intracerebral and extraaxial hemorrages, dural venous trombosis (sometimes associated to venous infarctions) and cerebral infarctions. 4) Secondary to the therapy: Toxicity secondary to chemotherapy and radiotherapy effects. Discussion: Central nervous system complications can be secondary to the primary disease, to the therapy or to the immunossuppresion and they can occur separately or some of them together in the same patient. Occasionally, it can be difficult to differentiate from another process by only the imaging features, so it is very important to know the characteristic imaging. Nevertheless an important number of cases are diagnosed finally by histology. Conclusion: It is important to recognise the central nervous system complications in oncohematologic neoplasms and their imaging features, since they have implications in the final diagnosis and the possible management of these patients. gliomas: MRI findings B.

To outline the social and legal framework of body packing and it's diagnosis. To outline the advantages and limitations of the several imaging methods applicable for the diagnosis of body packing. Background: Body packing is one of the common ways to smuggle drugs into the target countries, mostly by airline travel. Procedure Details: Suspects are brought to our institutions on a voluntary basis, most of them preferring radiological work-up to going into custody until the drugs are (or are not) excreted by natural ways. It has to be emphasised, that body packing of narcotic drugs is a potentially life threatening infliction, since a significant number of body packers die because of leakage of the packs within the intestinal tract. The examination of choice is an AP abdominal radiograph. In equivocal cases or if avoidance of the minimal X-ray exposure is of special importance (e.g. potentially pregnant persons), ultrasound should be performed. CT is an excellent additional investigation if findings should still be equivocal. This may be the case with some packing methods which render the ingested drugs very difficult to detect. Conclusion: Radiological investigation of suspected body packing is an invalua-ble tool which however confronts radiologists with a situation delicate for legal and social reasons.

This is a retrospective analysis of radiological studies (plain film studies of the abdomen, urography, CT, US and barium studies) of 25 patients clinically diagnosed with intraabdominal TB. Functional, dynamic, and morphological signs have been evaluated. We present the radiological manifestations significative of abdominal TB, together with commentaries about its radiological appearance, emphasizing the differential diagnosis in each case. We include different sites of GI and GU disease. In 11 of the 15 cases, the suspicion of GU TB (73.3%, 9) was based on urography as positive results on laboratory tests had not yet been obtained. Conclusion: Imaging techniques play a key role in the diagnosis of new, atypical presentations of TB. They enable us to know the extent and location of the lesions even before laboratory results become available, thus permitting the start of empirical treatment in the interin, prior to histological confirmation. The incidence of extra pulmonary and atypical TB is on the rise. For this reason, TB should be considered in the differential diagnosis of GI and GU in appropriate clinical situations.Learning Objectives: To show the important role of the radiologist in the diagnostic work up of patients with pelvic floor disorders. To review the radiological techniques used in this type of patient. To illustrate the various findings detectable at these techniques in pelvic floor pathologies. Background: Pelvic floor disorders are actually common complaints in medical practice and their symptoms include incontinence, prolapse, constipation and pelvic pain. Anatomical knowledge is essential to understand the radiological findings and to correlate with clinical evidence. There are three pelvic compartments which may be affected: Anterior, which includes bladder; medium, which includes vagina; and posterior, which includes rectum. The main radiological techniques we may use are cystography, defecography, colonic transit and functional magnetic resonance (MR).The role of the abdominal doppler ultrasonography and CT angiography inthe diagnosis of ligamentum arcuatum syndrome I.

LAMS is a rare organic disorder in the background of delayed gastric emptying. If the suspicion of the diagnosis emerges on the basis of clinical symtoms and standard barium emptying studies, abdominal doppler ultrasound and CTA are both valuable methods for confirmation.

This technique for virtual dissection needs only a minimum of time of operator interaction. with suspected biliary or pancreatic abnormality. We performed both 3D-MRCP with breath-holding and with free-breathing using a PACE technique on a 1.5 T unit. The imaging parameters of 3D-MRCP with breath-holding is TSE with restored pulse (TR = 988-994 msec, TE = 454-457 msec, slab thickness = 48-60 mm, no. of partitions = 16-20, effective slice thickness = 3 mm). The imaging parameters of 3D-MRCP with free-breathing is TSE with restored pulse (TR = 1630 msec, TE = 635-650 msec, slab thickness = 60 mm, no. of partitions = 60, effective slice thickness = 1 mm). We compared both 3D-MRCP images reconstructed by the workstation. The average total acquisition time of the breathholding method is 28.5 seconds, and that of free-breathing method with PACE is 6.3 minutes. Results: In all cases, 3D-MRCP image using the free-breathing method with PACE is superior to that using the breath-holding method. The difference is more dominant in patients who have difficulty in breath-holding. In the depiction of fine structures such as the cystic duct or branch ducts of the pancreas, 3D-MRCP using free breathing with PACE is superior to that using the breath-holding method. Conclusion: 3D-MRCP using free breathing with PACE provides clear 3D-MRCP images in all patients even if the patients experience difficulty breath-holding. The finer structure can be depicted by this method because isotropic voxel evaluation can be conducted. Volumetric measurement is an appropriate technique to evaluate treatment response in patients with liver metastases undergoing chemotherapy; moreover the spread of new dedicated workstations seems to have overcome limits of inapplicability as clinical routine. The contrast-enhanced MR cholangiograms were evaluated for the presence and location of bile duct leaks. Correlation was obtained in all cases with surgery (12), ERCP (5), percutaneous drainage (4) and clinical follow-up (8). Results: In 16/29 cases bile duct leakage was proved by surgery, ERCP or drainage means. Contrast-enhanced MRCP depicted the leakage in 15/16 and ruled out leaks in all 13 cases (sensitivity: 93.75%; specificity: 100%; PPV: 100%; NPV: 92.85%). The leak site was depicted in 8 patients and arose from: main bile duct (4), cystic duct remnant(1), right variant segmental branch",

Materials and Methods: The contrast images were taken of the BR12 phantom with a 1 cm thick acrylic phantom (2\u00d72 cm 2 ) which was on the top of it. The top slab which is 1 cm in thickness was moved 2 cm forward against lower slabs. Total thickness of the BR12 phantom was varied 2 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm and 8 cm.Incident beam qualities were altered with target filter combination and applied tube voltage. Tube voltages were varied between 26 kV and 32 kV with Mo/ Mo and between 28 kV and 34 kV with Mo/Rh. Exposures (mAs) were determined with an incorporated auto exposure control unit. The average glandular dose for various beam qualities were calculated using the exposure-to-average glandular dose conversion factors. Results: In 2 cm phantom, Mo/Mo has better contrast than Mo/Rh and dose was not affected by varying filter and X-ray tube voltage. In 4 cm phantom, contrast of Mo/Mo with over 30 kV and one of Mo/Rh with 28 kV and 30 kV were about the same contrast but dose was decreased about 12~20% with Mo/Rh. We found it better using Mo/Rh than using Mo/Mo with over 30 kV.In 6 cm, 8 cm phantom, Mo/Mo needed a large dose and resulted in a lower contrast by increasing X-ray tube voltage than Mo/Rh.",

However, in digital mammography, nothing is decided yet.This study examines the evaluation method for image quality of a digital mammography with clinical equipment through physical evaluation of the mammographic comuputed radiology (CR) systems under clinical conditions. Materials and Methods: We used two CR systems. One consisted of a single plate image reader (FCR 5000MA, Fuji), which includes dual-side reading and 50-micron pixels. Other consisted of a single plate image reader (FCR 5000H, Fuji), which includes single-side reading and 100-micron pixels. Digital characteristic curves, pre-sampling MTFs and digital Wiener spectra were measured as indices of image quality. Pre-sampling MTFs were measured from slit and edge images at 28 kV. Digital Wiener spectra were measured at 28 kV with breast equivalent filter. Results: Pre-sampling MTFs with both readings were almost the same. Digital Wiener spectra with dual side reading were superior to those with single side reading. NEQ of CR system with dual side reading was superior to that with single side reading because of the good efficiency of light condensing. Conclusion: New mammographic CR systems with dual side readings should be a further powerful tool for detecting low-contrast lesions in the breast. Wiener spectra need to determine exposure conditions, in order to perform comparison between institutions, since it is strongly influenced by beam quality and dose.",

ICTP can be substituted for MRI when managing multiple bone metastases in patients with advanced breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy, although not in cases with few or no bone lesions. Tumor size ranged 5-20 mm. Ten tumors were detected on both dynamic study and delayed postcontrast T1WI, and one was not detected on either of them. Eight tumors had ductal dilatation, two had cyst formation, and eight had intraductal hemorrhage. Nine tumors had gradual enhancement and one had rapid enhancement pattern on the dynamic study. Three relatively large tumors (10-20 mm) had peripheral rim enhancement and were misdiagnosed as breast cancer. From pathological findings, peripheral rim enhancement was thought to be chronic inflammation and fibrosis of duct wall surrounding the tumors. Conclusion: Three of ten intraductal papillomas showed peripheral rim enhancement presumably reflecting chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the duct surrounding the tumors.

Materials and Methods: Between July 1998 and September 2002, MR imaging with pathological correlation was available in 157 breast lesions of 153 patients. All patients were female. The patients' ages ranged from 16 to 82 years (mean: 52 years). MR imaging was obtained using 1.5 T unit. Both breasts were scanned with transverse fat-suppressed T2WI using a fast spin echo sequence. The distribution patterns of LS classified 4 types and were correlated with pathological findings. Results: LS on FS-T2WI were identified in 50 of 157 breast lesions. The central type of LS was seen in 34 malignant lesions, but in none of benign lesions. The inhomogenous type of LS was only seen in 7 malignant lesions. The linear type of LS was only seen in 9 benign lesions. The nodular type of LS was only seen in 3 phyllodes tumors that also showed linear type of LS. LS in malignant lesions histologically corresponded to fibrosis or hyalinization. The linear type of LS corresponded to fibrous septations in the lesions.The nodular type of LS also corresponded to massive fibrosis.Conclusion: Evaluation of patterns of LS is important to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions.Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of initial MRI on predicting the extent of residual breast cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All suspected implant ruptures and suspicious intramammary lesions were verified surgically. The remaining cases are in follow-up. Results: We found 61 women with single lumen implants (57 silicone, 4 saline solution) and 19 double lumen implants. MRI detected 15 intracapsular ruptures (10 monolateral, 5 bilateral) and 4 cases of residual silicone from a previous prosthesis removal. Also 4 cases of primitive invasive ductal carcinoma (1 negative to the other imaging techniques) and 1 case of recurrent carcinoma (suspect at clinical and US evaluation) were found and all verified by histopathology. Conclusion: An integrated approach for the evaluation of implant integrity and breast parenchyma in a single one-time protocol is proving to be time saving and reliable, and well accepted by the patients.

At 1 month, 5/31 (16%) lesions that were considered tumor-free showed local residual disease. At the 3 months follow-up, local persistence was revealed in 2/31 lesions (6%). Conclusion: Given the advantages of using CE-US for the follow-up of hepatic metastases treated with RF, the examination 24 hours post-ablation is essential in evaluating the immediate results. Follow-up at 1 month reveals the cases of incomplete necrosis not detected with CE-US in the first 24 hours, because of the small amount of residual viable tumor.

Chryssogonidis, G.A. Vorkas, C.A. Papadopoulos, E. Syndouka, K. Lytras, L. Grassos; Thessaloniki/GR Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of contrast-enhanced sonography in monitoring therapeutic response to radiofrequency ablation (RF) of colorectal hepatic metastases. Materials and Methods: 20 patients diagnosed with 47 hepatic metastases of colorectal origin, either by multimodality imaging (CT-MRI) or biopsy, were enrolled. All patients were examined with contrast enhanced U/S by using real-time continuous scanning with a low mechanical index after bolus injection of 2.4 mL of a second generation agent (Sonovue, Bracco) before and 24 hours after thermoablation. Results: Pre-treatment U/S examination showed rim enhancement of hypovascular metastases during the late phase of the study in all cases. After ablation CE-US revealed residual rim enhancement in 7/47 (15%) metastases, indicating the presence of viable residual tumor and in 40/47 (85%) lesions showed complete necrosis. Conclusion: CE-US is an effective method for the immediate evaluation of RF results, assessing treatment margins and revealing local persistence.Cost effectiveness of SonoVue-enhanced ultrasonography (CE-US) in the characterization of benign liver lesions (BLL) L.

Grazioli 1 ; 1 Brescia/IT, 2 Milan/IT Purpose: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of contrast enhanced US (CEUS) in the characterization of BLL versus enhanced CT or MR. Materials and Methods: 112 patients have been studied with US and CE-US and the diagnosis obtained with the two methods was compared with CE-CT and/or CE-MR as gold-standards. The costs of the US, CE-US, CE-CT, and CE-MR exams have been calculated considering both fixed costs (amortization of the equipment/min) and variable costs (materials and cost/min of the staff involved). Results: After US 59/112 patients needed further tests (32 CT and 45 RM were performed). After CE-US only 26/112 patients needed further tests (11 CE-CT and 25 CE-MR performed).This means that the difference between US and CE-US in terms of correct diagnosis is 33 pts in favour of CE-US. Conclusions: Considering that US costs 39.0\u20ac, CE-US 80.0\u20ac, CE-CT 145.0\u20ac and CE-MR 250.0\u20ac, the costs of CE-US in all the patients enrolled (n = 112) is 8960\u20ac, and this cost is compared with the costs of CE-CT plus CE-MR plus US in the subpopulation of patients (n = 33 pts) that would not need any further tests after CE-US; this costs is 10164.0\u20ac.This means that we could have saved 1204\u20ac with an average cost-save per patient of 10.75\u20ac. In this study we did not consider the indirect costs related to the patients discomfort, radiation exposure, iodine exposure and time-save, (in fact we normally perform CE-US jointly with US exam) that might increase the cost saving in favour of CE-US.Effectsof radiographic contrast media on isolated porcine renal arteries: A comparison of dimeric iotrolan and monomeric iohexol and iomeprol M.

Grazioli; Brescia/ITPurpose: Characterisation of small nodules (2 cm) in patients with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis is a major problem. EASL (European Association for the Study of the Liver) suggests biopsy of all lesions 1 cm and 2 cm in the survelliance algorithm for HCC. The purpose of this presentation is to evaluate the possible role of CEUS in the characterisation of these lesions. Methods and Materials: At b-mode ultrasonography 31 nodules up to 2 cm (range 7-20 mm, mean15.6 mm) in 31 consecutive patients (12 female, age range 39-80years) were detected. All patients had contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with a second generation contrast media (Sonovue, Bracco, Milan, Italy) using continuous real-time low MI scanning (CCI: Acuson-Siemens). The standard dose was of 2.4 mL. Mini video clips were recorded during arterial portal and equilibrium phase and than reviewed. Final diagnosis was obtained by biopsy or CT/MR. Results: Final diagnosis was HCC (n = 21), displastic/regenerative nodules (n = 7), hemangioma (n = 3).CEUS characterized correctly 29/31 lesions. One HCC didn't show the typical enhancement during arterial phase both at CEUS and CT. Final diagnosis was obtained by liver biopsy. One hemangioma showed homogeneous enhancement during arterial phase and wash-out during portal venous phase at CEUS -a diagnosis of HCC was hypothesized. Diagnosis of capillary hemangioma was obtained with MR. Conclusions: CEUS can play a role in the characterisation of small liver lesions in patients with chronic liver disease. Liver biopsies could therefore decrease in number, if these results are confirmed in larger series.",

Wall, L. Matuszewski, T. Persigehl, B. Tombach, W. Heindel, C. Bremer; M\u00fcnster/DE Purpose: Optical contrast techniques allow for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in vivo and should therefore offer high sensitivity for cell migration studies. The purpose of this work was to assess membrane selective fluorochrome cell labelling for in vitro and in vivo cell detection. Methods and Materials: Tumor cells were labelled with membrane selective carbocyanine fluorochromes (DiO, DiL and DiR, Molecular Probes, Inc, Eugene) operating in the green, red and near infrared spectrum. Cell viability and duration of label retention were studied in vitro. The detection threshold of labelled tumor cells was determined in a cell phantom in vitro and in a tumor xenograft model in vivo. Results: All fluorochromes provided efficient cell labelling with SNR values between 50-150 (5 x 10 5 cells). Viability of labelled cells was virtually identical to non-labelled controls. Cellular fluorescence decreased with cell division but was still detectable beyond 8 mitotic cycles. As few as 5000 labelled cells could be detected in vitro (10 sec acquisition). While DiO and DiL labelling only allowed for cell detection in subcutaneous tissue (2 mm) DIR-labelled cells could even be depicted in deeper tissue sections (6-8 mm). Conclusion: Membrane selective cell tagging with lipophilic fluorochromes is an effective procedure providing a stable optical cell label. Non -invasive monitoring of transplanted cells as well study of cancer spread in vivo can be envisioned using this technique.Arthritis diagnosis by autofluorescence in an animal modelA. Hansch, D.

We compared the role of DDS and PDS in renal transplant recipients developing acute renal parenchymal dysfunction and correlated these findings with kidney biopsy, which was taken as the gold standard. Methods and Materials: 30 post renal transplant patients with acute graft dysfunction underwent gray scale sonography, DDS and PDS using HDI 5000 ATL machine. Patients who developed graft dysfunction due to vascular, obstructive or other non-parenchymal causes were excluded. All patients underwent an allograft biopsy within 72 hours of the sonography. We conclude that PDS is superior to DDS in screening patients with acute parenchymal renal dysfunction post transplantation. However, a normal PDS examination does not exclude an acute rejection.

Conclusion: MRI in combination with MRA is presently considered as a noninvasive imaging technique for the evaluation of carotid space tumors as it allows a multiplanar approach and direct visualization of the tumor and adjacent vessels. Instead of DSA, MRI and MRA are superior to other modalities in evaluating the differential diagnosis regarding vascular vs non-vascular tumors.

Sone, S. Imai, T. Yamashita, M. Fukunaga; Kurashiki/JP Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) for the diagnosis of bone metastasis in a rabbit bone tumor model. Materials and Methods: Skeletal lesion of tumor or inflammation was induced by the injection of VX-2 tumor cell suspension or croton oil, respectively, at the distal femur of Japanese white rabbits. Ten to fourteen days after the injection, MRI was performed under intravenous anesthesia. Single shot echo planar DW images were obtained. After MRI, the diseased side of femur was extirpated, analysed histologically, and compared with DW images. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were compared among the different tissue regions, and their relationship with histological measurements was examined. Results: In the necrotic regions of intraskeletal tumors, ADC values were higher than those in the regions with abundant viable tumor cells (p < 0.0001). In the extraskeletal tumor, necrotic cells were numerous and ADC values were similar to those in the intraskeletal necrotic tumors. Intraskeletal nflammatory lesions and normal bone marrow showed the highest and lowest ADC values, respec-After therapy, normal scintigraphy was in 89% in agreement with the clinical picture but MRI only in 22%. The MGUS patients had negative findings in both methods. Six patients in the initial MM stages not requiring therapy had positive T1-weighted findings, with negative STIR and MIBI. Out of the 38 patients with active disease, 32 had focal and 4 focal+diffuse MRI findings. MIBI showed D type in 18, F + D in 8 and F in 5 patients. In patients in remission (within 2 months), 10 MRIs showed focal changes, 5 partial conversion. In MIBI, 11 of these patients had N type, 4 had F + D. Conclusion: MRI and MIBI scintigraphy are methods of equal sensitivity in detecting MM and complement each other. The advantage of MIBI is whole-body scanning and faster response to therapy, conversely, MRI reliably detects epidural propagation and vertebral compression and thus influences the therapeutical procedure.",

To describe the MR imaging criteria for assessing the relationship of the pituitary macroadenomas with their surrounding structures. To outline the surgical and clinical implications of distinctive MR imaging features, that have been reported in recent literature. Background: In this presentation, we describe a systematic approach for a complete preoperative MRI evaluation of pituitary macroadenomas with emphasis on surgical considerations and distinctive imaging features with prognostic value. From our archives, we collected the preoperative MRI studies of 85 patients with pituitary macroadenomas that underwent transsphenoidal surgery. They included 55 non-secreting and 30 hormone-secreting adenomas (PRL = 3, GH = 24, ACTH = 2 and GH-PRL = 1). The MRI findings were compared with the surgical and histological findings and correlated with the clinico-laboratory data of the patients. Imaging Findings: In every case, we used recently described criteria to assess cavernous sinus invasion by the pituitary adenomas. We focused on the detection of the bright spot of the neurohypophysis. We evaluated the signal intensity of the adenomas on T2-weighted images and the contrast enhancement pattern with emphasis on prediction of their consistency (soft/firm, fibrous). Conclusion: The MRI yielded 82% accuracy in diagnosing cavernous sinus invasion. The bright spot of the neurohypophysis was detected in 78% of the patients and none of them developed permanent diabetes insipidus postoperatively. 6 adenomas demonstrated signal hypointensity on T2-weighted images, 4 nonfunctioning of fibrous consistency and 2 GH-producing of soft consistency.The etymology of Greek terms used in neuroradiology E.

Acikgoz; Zonguldak/TR Purpose: To directly image and analyse, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the cervical spinal nerves in the patients with clinical and radiographic evidence of cervical radiculopathy by high resolution MR neurography. Method and Materials: Fourty consecutive symptomatic patients and five asymptomatic volunteers were studied. A magnetic resonance imaging phased-array coil system was used to obtain high-resolution coronal T1-weighted spin echo and coronal/axial short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images of the cervical spine and spinal nerves. On the axial STIR images, nerve/muscle signal intensity ratio of the cervical spinal nerves were measured on the two sides and were compared with paired samples T test. p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results: Markedly increased signal in the distal portion of the affected spinal nerves was determined. In the patients, nerve/muscle signal intensity ratio measurements of the affected spinal nerves showed a significantly increased intensity compared with that of the non-involved spinal nerves (p < 0.01). In the controls, nerve/muscle signal intensity rate of the spinal nerves was nearly identical on the two sides (p > 0.05). Conclusion: According to us, MR neurography using phased-array coils sequences can detect signal abnormalities within compressed cervical spinal nerves in patients with corresponding radicular symptoms and findings. This technique may be particularly helpful in evaluating patients with multi level disc disease of the cervical spine.Endovascular coil embolization for the treatment of ruptured vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms W.

Arana, L. Mart\u00ed-Bonmat\u00ed, E. Moll\u00e1, S. Costa; Valencia/ES Purpose: To correlate cervical spine MR imaging findings with outcome measures questionnaire. Material and Methods: A total of 226 patients submitted with neck pain with or without radiculopathy were studied. There were 74 men and 152 women, aged 42.6 \u00b1 13.8 years. Patients with previous surgery, neoplasm or traumatic episodes were excluded. Every patient completed the validated Northwick Park Neck Pain questionnaire with nine core items, providing a score of pain and disability from 0 to 100. All patients had sagittal gradient-echo T1 and fast spin-echo T2, axial gradient-echo and MR myelography weighted images. MR images of the two most affected disc levels were read obtaining a MR score ranging from zero to 30. Results: There were no gender differences regarding MRI and symptoms score. Overall, MR findings did not correlate with overall symptoms score (Spearman's Rho, r = 0.034, p = 0.56). No particular disc level was associated with symptoms (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.65). On the regression linear model of MRI score, the only items included from the questionnaire were sleeping pain (p = 0.03) and pain interference with work (p = 0.01). No other associations were found with other symptoms. The pain and disability score was not statistically associated with any particular disc level. MR score correlated with age (r = 0.656, p = 0.001) but not with symptoms (r = -0.032, p = 0.62). Conclusion: In patients with neck pain, only pain interference with work and sleeping were related to MRI findings. Imaging score score did not correlate globally with self-reported pain score.Neuroimaging abnormalities in Lyme disease encephalitis R.A. Ikonomov; Sofia/BG Purpose: Lyme disease is caused by the tick-borne spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi. Pathological reactions found in peripheral nerve, root or plexus and CNS include meningeal inflammation, perivascular inflammatory cell formation and focal demyelination. In view of multiform clinical signs, the diagnosis of the disease is often difficult. Methods and Materials: We have observed four patients (two men and two women) with Lyme disease encephalitis. They were bitten by a tick between one and three years ago. The patients had a headache, drowsiness, personality changes, impairment of memory, cognitive slowing, weakness and pyramidal signs. The patients underwent the following examinations: native CT scan, contrast-enhanced CT scan, native MRI, contrast-enhanced MRI, CSF examination and serologic examination. Results: Neuroimaging techniques mainly showed lesions in the basal cerebral structures. CT showed mild hypodensities in the midbrain (cerebral peduncles), diencephalic areas and basal ganglia. MRI demonstrated increased signals on T2 in the anterior and/or posterior limb of internal capsule, thalamus, ventral areas of cerebral peduncles and hippocampus, with decreased signals on T1 in the same structures. Contrast enhancement MRI showed significantly increased signals on T1 in the described areas and in the meninges in two of the patients. CSF examination showed lymphocytic pleocytosis with a normal glucose concentration and a mildly or moderately elevated protein concentration. The serum and CSF positive serology (ELISA) confirmed the diagnosis. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the main lesions in Lyme disease encephalitis are localized in basal cerebral structures: rostral midbrain, diencephalic areas and basal ganglia.Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty using single lumen balloon catheter with non-valve wire for acute middle cerebral artery embolism Y. Hori, Y. Sagara, T. Nakamura, M. Saino, H. Nagatomi, H. Kiyosue, M. Okahara, S. Tanoue, H. Mori; Oita/JP Purpose: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) using a single lumen balloon catheter (STEALTH) with a valve wire has been performed to treat acute middle cerebral artery embolism (MCAE). However, we found use of STEALTH with a valve wire could be associated with a poor manoeuverability of valve wire in some cases with tortuous access route, which may lead to an unsuccessful procedure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a modified PTA technique using STEALTH with a non-valve wire for acute MCAE. Methods and Materials: Five patients with acute MCAE were treated with modified PTA technique. STEALTH was advanced into the occlusion site with a nonvalve wire. PTA was performed with inflation of STEALTH with the same wire at 2 to 4atm for 30-60 seconds. Local fibrinolysis was added when distal emboli was observed. Follow-up CT was performed within 24 hours and 3-7 days after onset. Success rates of the procedure, recanalization rates, complications and clinical outcome assessed by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were evaluated with comparison of control group of patients treated with standard PTA or local fibrinolysis alone. Result: Complete recanalization was achieved in all patients. There were no technical complications. After 24 hs, CT showed no cortical infarction in 3, cortical infarction in 2. Three patients recovered to mRS 0 or 2. One patient died from symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Conclusion: This technique showed the high rate of recanalization and may provide a safe and effective treatment for acute MCAE.Predictors of the immediate anatomic and clinical results of embolization of intracanial wide-necked aneurysms using three-dimensional coils J.-N.

Ryjkova; St. Petersburg/RU Purpose: To determine the accuracy of point-based MRI/PET image registration using the original stereotatic adapter (SA) Materials and Methods: MRI and 18F-FDG PET of aqueous phantom were performed by using original SA. SA was actually a mask rigidly fixed to the table.Markers were made in advance on the phantom. Variances of markers localization (VML) were measured along each axis on the linear accelerator table meant for stereotactic radiation therapy. Coordinates were marked by the marks in the thickness of fixing mask (\"zero\" points). VML were measured under the guidance of X-ray from \"zero\" points. PET and MRI were then carried out. VML on PET and MRI modalities were also conducted as regards \"zero\" points. Then fiducial localization error (FLE) was calculated, PET and MRI images were matched and fiducial registration error (FRE) and target registration error (TRE) were calculated. Results: Root-mean-square (RMS) FLE of the phantom for PET and MRI modalities were 0.8 mm and 1.1 mm, respectively. RMS FRE and RMS TRE for a phantom registration was 1.8 mm and 4.8 mm, respectively. A strong direct correlation was noted between the markers number and FRE (r = 0.99, p < 0.05) and FLE (r = 0.99 p < 0.05). Beside reliable correlation between the markers number and the value of TRE were not received (r = -0.44, p > 0.05).Conclusions:The received data testify relatively high accuracy of point-based MRI/PET image registration using original SA.

Materials and Methods: We evaluated MR images of 32 patients (19 males, 13 females, age 3-59) with various types of leukemia (acute 28 cases, chronic 4). All the patients demonstrated the symptoms indicative for CNS damage. MRI examinations were performed with 0.5 T Gyroscan (Philips). The protocol included 3 plane images with T1SE, T2TSE, FLAIR and MTC sequence (coronal plane); axial T1FFE scans were used as well. Slice thickness range was 1.5-6 mm. In all cases, scans after administration of Gd-DTPA were obtained.Results: MRI findings included the following cerebral lesions: parenchymal (7 cases) and meningeal infiltration (3), cranial nerve involvement (2), treatmentrelated changes (16), hemorrhage (6), infection (1), second primary neoplasm (1), non-determined foci (5). Additionally, in 4 patients MRI examinations detected leukemia-related changes in other sites such as bones(5), maxillary sinus(1)and soft tissues (3). Final diagnosis was confirmed by histopathologic examinations (5) or further radiological and clinical observation. Conclusion: Direct CNS involvement in leukemic patients may be demonstrated as a wide range of changes. Familiarity with the spectrum of CNS complications and their imaging appearance is essential to make the early diagnosis.

Mar\u00edn C\u00e1rdenas, E. Mayayo Sinu\u00e9s, R. Jim\u00e9nez Monreal, V. Mazas Artasona; Zaragoza/ES Purpose: Venous angioma (VA), so-called developmental venous anomaly, is an \"umbrella-like\" group of dilated white matter veins converging radially on a single enlarged tubular draining vein. This large collector vein drains into a dural sinus or deep ependymal vein. Solitary VA constitutes the anomalous venous drainage from a cerebral portion, sited in deep white matter, near the frontal horn or fourth ventricle and is exclusively venous and asymptomatic. Traditionally, intravenous angiography was the diagnostic method to assess accurately VA. Our objective is to demonstrate the ability of MR angiographic images, especially contrast-en-hanced 3D-TOF sequences, in the accurate diagnosis of VA, offering the possibility that an asymptomatic vascular anomaly can be detected by non-invasive imaging methods. Materials and Methods: MR images of the brain from June 2000 to September 2003 were evaluated. Subjects with MRI signs of VA were selected and MR angiographic images and gadolinium enhanced 3D-TOF sequences were assessed. Results: A linear area with flow void is found, sometimes just intuited depending on sequences, crossing the white matter to the cortical area.

Background: Diagnosis of congenital and acquired diseases of spinal cord has implications for management, therapy and functional prognosis. Spinal MRI has been called the gold standard of screening for spinal cord diseases, but it is timeconsuming, costly and invasive in neonates. Procedure Details: Between January 1992 and June 2003, 270 SUS were performed in 251 patients. Suspicion of dysraphism and cutaneous stigmata were the most frequent clinical indications. The SUS examination technique, anatomy and imaging findings are described and illustrated, and compared to MRI (69 exams). Spinal dysraphism was observed in 17.5% of patients (36 myelomeningoceles, 1 diastematomielia and 7 dermal sinnus).

Background: Intestinal transplantation represents a potential treatment option in patients with irreversible, chronic intestinal failure. Several types of intestinal transplantations can be performed: isolated intestinal transplantion, combined intestinal and liver transplantation or multivisceral transplantation. Imaging Findings: Correct interpretation of imaging studies after transplantation depends on familiarity with the surgical anatomy. For these reasons this pictorial essay schematically illustrates the intra-operative appearances during various procedures of intestinal transplantation performed in children.

            "text": "Learning Objective: To demonstrate urethral anomalies in the pediatric population. Background: The MCU and ascending urethrogram are important techniques in the evaluation of the pediatric urethra. Anomalies such as posterior urethral valves are frequently encountered, and are associated with serious clinical implications. Good technique and image interpretation are essential in making the correct diagnosis. Imaging Findings: Anomalies include fistulae, valves, webs, duplications, phimosis and strictures. Occasionally, incidental findings such as prostatic or cowper's gland extravasation are seen. Conclusion: To educate and familiarise radiology trainees and radiologists with the evaluation of the pediatric urethra.Post mortem CT examination of neonates B. Lagesen, R.M. Tjonneland, H. Aure; Oslo/NO Learning Objectives: To determine whether or not the use of post mortem total body CT examination in cases of intrauterine death and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) can give valuable and satisfactory information and be a supplement for the investigation of cause of death. Background: There has been a decline in autopsies performed in Norwegian hospitals during the recent years explained by general ethical attitudes, as well as by cultural and religious prohibitions to autopsy, particularly in the immigrant population. Procedure Details: The examination must be carried out within 12 hours of the time of death. The CT examination is carried out by a helical technique within one scan. Scout view: 0 o and 90 o . SFOV: Small / medium. Algorithm: Standard. Slice thickness: 2 mm. Pitch: 1.5. Table movement: 3 mm. Reconstruction interval: 1.1 mm. Tube current: 230 mA. Multiplanar reconstruction and 3D images were evaluated at the CT workstation, with the possibility of viewing the images at different degrees of rotation. Conclusion: The images of the brain and skeletal have high image quality and give exceptional information. The image quality for thorax and abdomen are not as high, but give useful information. Rigor mortis and autolysis are to be considered and the results of the examination are dependent on how long after death the examination is carried out. Total body CT examinations give valuable and satisfactory information and can be an alternative to autopsy in cases where parents refuse permission due to general ethical, cultural and religious attitudes.MRI in the evaluation of children with NF type IH. Kaur, S. Ryan, V. Donoughe; Dublin/IE Learning Objectives: Illustrate MRI findings in NF type I in children. To give indicators to help distinguish benign and malignant complications of this disease.To recommend a strategy for follow-up imaging in these children. Background: Children with NF I may have a variety of manifestations including benign and malignant brain and spinal cord abnormalities, vascular complications, bone and other mesodermal abnormalities. Imaging Findings: MRI scans done over 42 months on patients known to have neurofibromatosis were reviewed. Indications for the scan, the scan findings, operative and pathological findings when available, were reviewed. We demonstrate a range of manifestations of optic nerve gliomas and their progression. We indicate features that distinguish benign lesions such as \"neurofibromatosis bright objects (NBOs)\" from astrocytomas. We demonstrate a variety of spinal manifestations of the disease and their varied clinical features. We show the usefulness of MRI in the evaluation of soft tissue and bony complications of this disease. Finally, we review the literature and our experience to propose a role for imaging findings in the diagnosis of NF 1 and propose a strategy for the follow-up imaging in children diagnosed with this condition. Conclusion: MRI is valuable in the diagnosis and follow-up of children with NF 1. We recommend MR imaging be considered in children with NF 1 who present with any change in clinical condition.3D extremity angiography with multi-detector CT in childrenM. Karcaaltincaba, D. Akata, U. Aydingoz, G. Leblebicioglu, M. Haliloglu, D. Akinci; Ankara/TR Learning Objectives:To describe a technique of extremity angiography using multi-detector CT in pediatric patients. To illustrate normal anatomy and abnormalities of the extremity vasculature. Background: Extremity angiography using multi-detector CT is a non-invasive modality used for evaluation of vasculature as an alternative to conventional angiography. Recent studies demonstrated feasibility of this technique in adult patients. 3D images allow display of vascular and osseous structures. In this exhibit, we will describe the use of extremity MDCT angiography in pediatric patients with suitable indications, potential clinical applications, the advantages and the limits of this technique compared to conventional angiography. Between December 2002 and September 2003, 7 pediatric patients underwent extremity CT angiography. Normal and abnormal extremity CT angiography studies will be illustrated. Procedure Details: Extremity multidetector CT angiography was performed by using a 4-channel multidetector CT. Technical parameters: detector collimation: 4 x 1 mm; pitch: 1.75; reconstruction interval 1 mm; slice thickness 1.25 mm; table speed per second, 14 mm; gantry rotation time 0.5 sec. Contrast injection rate varied from 2 to 3 cc/sec witha volume not exceeding 2 mL/kg of body weight. Mean acquisition time was 21 sec (range 17-25 sec). 3D volume rendered and MIP images were obtained from axial images to display vascular and osseous structures. Indications for the CT angiography studies were vasculitis, osteomyelitis, preoperative anatomic evaluation, soft tissue mass, and arterial injury. Conclusion: Technical success was achieved in all patients (100%) who underwent extremity CT angiography studies. In pediatric population extremity multidetector CT angiography is feasible and can be used as an alternative to conventional angiography.The MR spectrum of anatomical variants of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal axis in pituitary stalk interruption syndrome G. Zuccoli 1 , G. Tognini 2 , F. Nicoli 1 , M. Uccelli 3 , F. Ferrozzi 3 ; 1 Reggio Emilia/IT, 2 Parma/IT, 3 Cremona/IT Learning Objectives: The purpose of this study is to describe the full spectrum of pituitary axis anomalies seen in pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS) by means of MR findings, and the association with other CNS anomalies. Background: The detection of anatomical abnormalities of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal axis represents a diagnostic marker of hormonal deficiency. Absence or hypoplasia of the pituitary stalk, hypoplasia of the adenohypophysis and ectopia of the neurohypophysis (pituitary stalk interruption syndrome; PSIS) are frequent MR findings in patients affected by isolated growth hormone deficiency or multiple pituitary hormonal deficiency and represents a distinct pathological entity. Septo-optic dysplasia represents a possible associated anomaly. Co-existent periventricular nodular gray matter foci have been recently described, suggesting a common genetic origin of PSIS and other development anomalies. Procedure Details: MR study protocols of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal axis include sagittal and coronal T1-weighted thin section (3 mm) images acquired with a standard head coil, 256 x 256 matrix and 20 cm field of view. Coronal or axial T2-weighted images should be also performed in selected patients. Conclusion: We present MR images showing different locations of the neurohypophysis (at the stalk level or at the median eminence level), different morphological aspects of the \"bright spot\" (single or double) and of the stalk (thin or interrupted). Furthermore we describe the association of PSIS with other development anomalies such as neuronal migration disorders.In concludion, we show the full spectrum of MR presentations of this syndrome, emphasizing the usefulness of performing a complete brain study to find associated anomalies.Radiology of pediatric liver tumours: A pictorial reviewA.S. Shaw, D.F.Q.C. Yu, P.A. Kane, J.B. Karani; London/UK Learning Objectives: To review the clinical presentation, radiological appearances and further management of benign and malignant primary liver tumours. Background: Primary liver tumours are relatively uncommon within the pediatric population. The third commonest site of primary abdominal neoplasia, they account for only 3% of tumours in this age group. The clinical presentation, histological classification, radiological appearances and management of these tumours are diverse. Imaging Findings: We present the radiological appearances of benign and malignant liver tumours at ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, with a brief overview of clinical presentation and further management. Conclusion: Primary liver tumours are a heterogeneous group of disorders which can usually be differentiated with a knowledge of the clinical and radiological features.Pediatric brain MRI in neurofibromatosis typeI H.-J. Mentzel, J. Seidel, C. Fitzek, J.R. Reichenbach, W.A. Kaiser; Jena/DE Learning Objectives: To evaluate the frequency, evolution, and diagnostic impact of characteristic central nervous MR imaging lesions in children with Neurofibromatosis type I (NF I).To give recommendations about diagnostic procedures in children with NF I. Background: NF I has a prevalence of 1:3-4000 and is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition with a high degree of penetrance. Optic gliomas occurs in 5-15% of patients with NF I, brain gliomas occur in 1-3%, and are usually lowgrade astrocytomas although approximately 50% became malignant gliomas. Imaging Findings: We reviewed 27 patients with NF I. MRI was performed every 12m and in cases of tumors every 6m. 4 patients had optic gliomata (14.8%), 2 chiasma gliomata (7.8%), 4 pilocytic astrocytomata (14.8%). Unknown Bright Objects (UBO's) on long TR sequences were detected in 81% (n = 22), involving basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem. Change of the UBOs in size and/or intensity with age was observed in 22 patients. Learning disabilities were diagnosed in 30% of the patients with UBO's. Conclusion: UBO's may be useful as an additional imaging criterion for NF I. Contrast administration is useful in baseline MR studies to maximize tumor detection and characterization, to add confidence to the diagnosis of benign probable myelin vacuolization, and to document stability of neoplasms on follow-up examinations. We recommend performing serial MR in children every 12 months. The frequency of follow-up in children with known brain tumors will vary with the tumor grade, biological activity, and treatment.Conventional and color Doppler sonography of scrotal pathology in children: An update M. Fit\u00e9, C. Aso, G. Enriquez, J. Carre\u00f1o, N. Tor\u00e1n, J. Lucaya; Barcelona/ES Learning Objectives: Scrotal lesions are common in children.Ultrasound is the first imaging modality used to examine children with suspected scrotal pathology. Moreover, Doppler US has increased the radiologist's ability to assess flow in the prepuberal testis. The aim of this exhibit is to illustrate ultrasound findings in common scrotal processes, in order to facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment. Background: We present a retrospective review of 750 children with scrotal lesions studied with ultrasound. Imaging Findings: The lesions were divided into the following groups: Perito-neal-vaginal complex lesions, epididymo-orchitis, torsion of the testes or their appendages, benign and malignant testicular tumors, traumatic lesions, testicular microlithiasis and scrotal involvement in systemic conditions such as Schonlein-Henoch purpura, Kawasaki disease and congenital suprarenal hyperplasia. Conclusion: Clinical symptoms are often nonspecific in scrotal processes yet some of these conditions require urgent surgical treatment; thus, knowledge of their ultrasound features is highly relevant in clinical practice.",

Alvarez; Madrid/ES Purpose: Portosystemic shunts are constructed to palliate symptomatic portal hypertension or to provide decompression of the hepatic vasculature in Budd-Chiari syndrome. The aim of this exhibit is to show the utility and limitations of duplex, color and power Doppler sonography in the evaluation of portosystemic shunts performed in pediatric patients. Methods and Materials: Twenty-one portosystemic shunts were performed in 19 patients aged six to 18 years (12 females, 6 males) for the management of portal hypertension (portal vein obstruction, Budd-Chiari syndrome, congenital hepatic fibrosis, and cirrhosis). Follow-up protocol included a preoperative control, an immediate postoperative control one day to 1 week after surgery, and long-term postoperative controls three months, six months, and one year after surgery. We illustrate the vascular connections and demonstrate the expected postsurgical direction of flow in the blood vessels involved. The US techniques and the criteria for inferring patency are discussed. Advantages, limitations, and pitfalls of every Doppler modality are emphasized. Results: Types of shunt were 10 meso-cava, 6 distal splenorrenal, 1 proximal splenorrenal and 4 porta-caval. All were adequately assessed by Doppler sonog-raphy. Stenosis of the shunt was diagnosed in two patients and thrombosis in one patient, all confirmed at arteriography. Conclusion: Duplex Doppler US provided physiologic flow information, and color Doppler US was capable of directly imaging shunt flow and, in most cases, identifying shunt anastomosis. The majority of surgical portosystemic shunts can be fully evaluated and complications detected with Doppler sonography if the hemodynamics of the surgical procedures are understood.Optic nerve ultrasound in assessment of raised intracranial pressure: Its role in clinical practice L.C. Bamford, A. Paterson, G. Cran, J. Turner, S. McKinstry, P. Flynn, L.E. Sweeney; Belfast/UK Purpose: Early diagnosis of acute intracranial hypertension enables prompt treatment. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is reflected by enlargement of the dural optic nerve sheath with the formation of papilloedema. Published reference values of ONSD in \"normal\" children are: children less than 1 year < 4 mm diameter, children over 1 year \u2264 4.5 mm in diameter. Methods and Materials: A total of 63 children with spina bifida and shunted hydrocephalus were included in the study. ONSD readings were taken 3 mm behind the optic nerve head using a 7 MHz sector probe. Eight children re-presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of raised ICP and had CT brain scans performed. Results: Asymptomatic cases: n = 63. Mean ONSD right eye = 4.5 mm (SD = 1.1), mean ONSD left eye = 4.6 mm (SD = 0.9).A Pearson calculation showed both eyes to be highly correlated. A cumulative percent calculation showed 70% (44/ 63) of children had ONSD > 4.5 mm.",

            "text": "Magnetic resonance urography in the diagnostic work-up of infants and small children G.I. Kirova, M. Minkov, T. Georgieva, G. Hadjidekov; Sofia/BG Purpose: The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic potential of MRI examination for detection of renal abnormalities in small children. Materials and Methods: 35 children (20 days to 14 years) referred from the urology service, in whom urinary tract abnormalities were strongly suspected, underwent MR exam. The technique included unenhanced and enhanced MRU images of the abdomen and pelvis. The examination as a whole took 20-30 min. Transverse images and 3D reformations were assessed on a satellite console and 3D data were reviewed with different rotating angles. Findings were retrospectively compared with results of urinalysis, ultrasonography and surgery. Results: MR examination of urogenital tract depicted different clinically suspected urinary tract abnormalities, including 4 duplex systems, 3 renal distopias, 12 obstructive megaureters, 3 uretheroceles, 6 PUJ obstructions, 5 with accompanying renal parenchymal disease, 6 urinary tract calculi, 6 tumors, one extra renal mass, 3 with bladder abnormalities and one transplanted kidney. Most of the children had complex pathology. MRU demonstrated anatomy better than IVU, particularly the renal parenchyma and poorly functioning dilated systems. MRU was superior to US in showing ureteral pathology. Conclusions: MR urological examination could prove especially advantageous in a number of clinical applications, including urinary tract obstruction, renal tumors, transplanted kidney and a wide range of congenital anomalies. It is a safe, noninvasive, and relatively fast technique for imaging children's renal tract disorders. MRI thus has the potential to replace other ionizing imaging techniques and offers better results for many indications.Choledochal cysts in pediatric patients: Preoperative evaluation with MR cholangiography Y.A. Akhmetov; Almaty/KZPurpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography in accurately demonstrating the presence, extent, and type of choledochal cysts. Methods and Materials: Eight patients with sonographically suspected choledochal cysts were evaluated with a 2D and 3D FASE MR cholangiography technique. The presence, extent, and type of choledochal cyst were determined. MR cholangiographic findings were correlated with the gold standard of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and surgery in all patients, and with additional CT in five. Results: There were six (75%) Todani type I and one (12.5%) Todani type IV choledochal cysts. The extent of the involvement was correctly demonstrated on all MR cholangiograms. Calculi and sludge were correctly identified on the MR cross-sectional images in four patients (50%) but were not seen on MR cholangiograms in one (12.5%). In one patient with an initially misinterpreted choledochal cyst, MR sectional images showed the typical appearance of a hydatid cyst, which was confirmed at surgery. Conclusion: MR cholangiography can be used to confirm the diagnosis of choledochal cysts and define the extent of involvement preoperatively. Non-biliary cysts such as a hydatid cyst can mimic a choledochal cyst on the MR cholangiogram and should be correlated with the MR cross-sectional images to avoid misinterpretation.Effects of EC guidelines implementation on effective dose reduction in spinal investigation for childhood scoliosisD. Baranska, M.A. Staniszewska, T. Bieganski; Lodz/PL Purpose: To reduce the radiation exposure in children in conventional X-ray examination of spine according to the EC guidelines. Methods and Materials: 78 children diagnosed for scoliosis were randomised into groups of either standard or improved radiographic tehnique: 1. Standard technique: AP projection, focus-skin distance -FSD 1 m (FFD ~ 1.3 m), tube voltage 73 kV, inherent filtration of 3.5 mm Al, no additional filtration. 2. AP, FSD 1 m, 73 kV, additional filtration of 1 mm Al and 0.2 mm Cu 3. PA, FSD 1 m, 73 kV, additional filtration as above 4. PA, FSD 2 m, 73 kV, additional filtration as above 5. PA, FSD 2 m, 102 kV, additional filtration as above. The children were then divided into two groups corresponding to the mathematical phantoms representing 10 and 15 year-old children. The air kerma measured with LiF, TLD-100; effective doses calculated by Monte Carlo simulation.Results: All the new condition settings diminished exposure. The reduction of the effective doses, as compared to standard technique was as follows: technique 2 -64% effective dose reduction in the groups of both 10 and 15 year-old children; technique 3 -77% and 67% in 10 and 15 year-old patient groups respectively; technique 4 -58% and 60% respectively; technique 5 -83% and 72% respectively. Conclusion: Optimising of the imaging conditions according to the EC guidelines in paediatric radiology allows for evident effective dose reduction, with no significant loss of image quality.Comparison of semiquantitative bone marrow scintigraphy and MIBGscanning in diagnosis of neuroblastoma J. Soukhova, V. Soukhov, E. Karetkina, B. Kolygin; St.Petersburg/RU Purpose: To compare results of semiquantitave bone marrow scintigraphy (BMS)and whole body MIBG-scanning used for staging and therapeutic effect assessment in patients with neuroblastoma. Materials: BMS and MIBG-scanning were performed in 24 consecutive children(1-14 y.o.)  with histologically proven neuroblastoma before and after the treatment. BMS using 99mTc-millicolloids started 1-1.5 hr after i.v. injection of 222-370 MBq; MIBG-scanning -24 hours p.i. of. Quantification was performed on MIBG images of affected bone: count density, measured within a region of interest, was divided by background count density. This value represents coefficient of tracer uptake (CTU). Semiquantitative grading of BM images was as follows: grade 1-absence of image, grade 2-markedly diminished tracer uptake, grade 3 -slightly reduced tracer uptake, grade 4 -normal BM scan. Results: The following correlation coefficients were observed for evaluated regions with \"hot spots\" of MIBG uptake taken as evidence of metastases in the indexed sites: 4.97 \u00b1 1.80 before treatment and 1.51 \u00b1 0.53 -after. Focal or diffuse defects of tracer uptake (grade 1 or 2) by BMS considered to represent metastatic involvement. Marrow regeneration can be considered in regions with image grade 3-4. In all cases p < 0.001. Conclusion: Statistically significant correlation was observed between BM semiquantitative image grades and MIBG CTU. Whole body BMS can be effectively used for the initial diagnosis of BM invasion by neuroblastoma and BM regeneration. Quantitative results of MIBG-scanning reflect therapy response and influence choice of treatment schedule.Application of low-dose scan protocols in 16 row computed tomography: Dose reduction in pediatric examinations M.F. Khan, C. Herzog, H. Ackermann, H. Schmidt, T. Vogl; Frankfurt a. Main/DE Purpose: Optimization of different low-dose CT protocols for dose reduction in pediatric radiology.Methods: 30 children aged between 2 and 12 years consecutively received a 16 row computed tomography examination. Thorax, spine and neck were examined. Scan parameters were individually adapted: T: I 500 ms, collimation: 16 x 0.75 mm and 16 x 1.5, 120 -80 KV, 50 -11 mAs. Follow-up examinations allowed a continuous variation of selected scan parameters. Evaluation criteria included image quality, image noise, delineation and resolution of selected structures as well as general assessability. Age, gender, body weight, dose -length product and effective mAs were recorded. Results: In examinations focusing on the spine, soft tissues of the neck, and pulmonary infiltrations as well as most of the interstitial pulmonary diseases a satisfactory image quality was achieved by using 80 kV and 11 mAs (mean image quality: 2.1 (spine), 2.3 (pulmonary infiltration), 1.9 (soft tissue neck) and 2.7 (interstitial pulmonary diseases), grade 1 (very good) to 5 (poor)). Topographic overviews turned out to be extremely dose dependent and were therefore omitted in most cases. A mAs dose reduction up to 70% (110 mAs to 33 mAs) as compared to conventional CT imaging protocols could be achieved in chest and neck exams. In spinal examinations a dose reduction up to 94.1% (244 mAs to 15 mAs) was possible. Conclusion: Appropriate selection of scan parameters in 16 row computed tomography allows a clear dose reduction in pediatric CT examinations as compared to conventional CT imaging techniques.",

Kim, W. Cho, J. Kim, S.-J. Bae, J. Kim, J.-Y. Kim, J. Ja; Seoul/KR Purpose: To describe the MRI findings of cortical malformation of cerebrum in undermyelinated brain, and to evaluate the use of T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) with narrow window width and three-dimensional RF spoiled FAST (3D RF spoiled Fourier acquired steady state) imaging for detection of cortical abnormalities. Methods and Materials: The subjects were sixteen patients with epilepsy, aged under 2 years. The subjects had pathologically-confirmed cortical malformation of cerebrum (n = 4) or abnormalities well localized with PET or SPECT and EEG findings (n = 12) (9 boys and 7 girls, age ranging from 4 months to 21 months). T2WI and 3D RF spoiled FAST imaging using thin (1.6 to 2 mm) partition sizes were performed. Two radiologists reviewed the imaging. Results: On T2WIs, cortical abnormalities were not detected in 10 of the 16 patients. On T2WIs with narrow window width, cortical abnormalities were detected in all patients. Bright foci were seen in 7 patients, dark foci in 5 patients and delayed myelination in 4 patients on T2WIs with narrow window width. On 3D RF spoiled FAST imaging, delayed myelination as compared with the contralateral side was detected in 7 of the 16 patients. Conclusion: T2WI with narrow window width is useful for detection of cortical malformations of the cerebrum in undermyelinated brain and 3D RF spoiled FAST imaging shows delayed myelination.",

Zaleska-Dorobisz, B. Jankowski, J. Wawro, K. Moron; Wroclaw/PL Background: The aim of this study was to estimate of the color Doppler and power Doppler imaging efficacy in diagnosis of acute scrotum in children. Material and Methods: 140 boys with acute pain and scrotal oedema with an age range between 4 days and 14 years were admitted to hospital. The clinical and ultrasound examinations with CD and PD showing acute changes in the testes and scrotal structures are presented with special focus to vascular flow. Results: The accuracy of ultrasound findings verified intraoperatively and by histopathologic examinations was 82%. In 118 (80.5%) cases the morphological changes were directly related to the duration of the signs and symptoms. Testicular arterial flow was compromised in testicular torsion and was normal in adnexial torsion. Transitional blood flow changes were noted in 25 boys after testicular trauma. Pathological vascularity was recognized in 5 cases of accidentally-diagnosed testicular tumors with acute inflamation. Conclusions: Color Doppler imaging is useful in diagnosis evaluation of the acute scrotum in children.Pictorial display and review of life threatening fetal conditionsK. Aratani, H. Hyodoh, H. Akiba, M. Tamakawa, K. Hyodoh, M. Hareyama; Sapporo/JP Purpose: We reviewed our clinical and MRI files of patients with life threatening fetal conditions for the prenatal diagnosis of fetal malformations as well as for the maternal disorders during pregnancy.Methods and Materials: From July 1999 to December 2002, 60 women with complicated pregnancies were referred for MRI. Imaging was performed in a 1.5 T system using SSFSE sequences. The pathologies presented include CNS tumor/developmental anomaly, gastrointestinal atresia/hernia, abdominal tumors, genitourinary anomaly, superficial tumor (hemangioma), other multiple anomalies of fetal malformations, and placental bleeding/hematoma, bicornuate uterus, myoma, cervical cancer, ovarian tumor of the maternal disorders. This exhibit affords the observer an opportunity to review the appearances of some of the rarer pathological conditions. A simple dose reduction protocol for pediatric multislice CT R.A. Allen, A.J. Watt; Glasgow/UK Purpose: In pediatric CT examinations, failure to adjust parameters based on weight or age may result in unnecessarily high radiation doses. Radiation dose is directly proportional to the tube current for a given CT scanner and kilovoltage. The aim of this study was to assess the parameters used for CT scanning in a large tertiary referral centre. Methods and Materials: CT scans performed at The Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Yorkhill, Glasgow from April 2002 to December 2002 were examined. A weight-based protocol was designed based on the current literature. The tube current & kV selected for each examination before and after introduction of the protocol was compared.",

In our study, we analyzed ultrasonographic (USG) findings correlated to clinical parameters in an HIV-infected pediatric cohort of patients all with parotid enlargement to assess if BLL may be considered an early manifestation of HIV disease. Methods and Materials: USG of parotid glands was performed in 34 pts (23 M, 11 F). None had xerostomia or sicca syndrome symptoms. Mean age was 9.7 years (range[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]. Twenty-three patients were on HAART regimen, 8 were given only two NRTIs, one had no therapy and 2 had therapy interruption due to adverse events. Only three patients had diagnosis of full-blown AIDS. Mean CD4+ cell count was 865/\u00ecl (range 56-5126) with a mean CD4+ percentage of 26.8% (range 2.2-44.2%). Mean viral load was 4.3 Log10 (range < 50-182,000 copies/ml). Results: USG assessed three different patterns of intraparotid lymphoid hyperplasia: markedly evident in 13 subjects (classified as type 1), barely noticeable in 16 patients (type 2) and only parotid enlargement without lymphoid hyperplasia in five patient (type 3). Conclusions: BLL may indeed be considered an early manifestation of HIV disease: 33/34 pts were in a stable clinical condition, with a good response to antiretroviral therapy. Due to the reported possible malignant transformation of BLL in adults, it is also advisable to perform USG at least once a year or in concomitance with any modification of the parotid lesions.High resolution chest tomography (HRCT) in very low birth weight infantsP.A. Daltro, R.R. Mello, M. Boechat, J.M. Lopes; Rio de Janeiro/BR Purpose:To study the prevalence of HRCT abnormalities in very low birth weight infants, since there is very little information about this technique in the neonatal period, especially in very low birth weight infants who are most suceptible to lung injury at this critical period of the development. Methods and Materials: All babies with birth weight of less than 1500 g and up to 34 weeks gestational age born at Instituto Fernandes Figueira (FIOCRUZ, Brasil) between January 98 and August 2000 had HRCT of the thorax just before discharge, whilst in stable clinical condition. We used Pro-Speed-S CT HRCT. Informed consent was obtained and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Research at Instituto Fernandes Figueira. Results: We studied a total of 86 infants with a birth weight of 1113 \u00b1 232 g and a gestational age of 28.5 \u00b1 2.3 weeks. HMD was diagnosed in (52.3%) and BDP in 24 (27.9%). There was good agreement between the two examiners (Kappa: 0.68). A total of 24 HRCT studies were considered normal (27.9%). nary dysplasia (DBP) had abnormal HRCT and 40% of non-DBP infants had abnormal HRCT. Conclusions: At the time of home discharge, asymptomatic very low birth weight infants show a high prevalence of abnormalities on HRCT of the thorax.Evaluation of contrast enhanced duplex Doppler and power Doppler ultrasonography in diagnosis of the thyroid nodules in children U. Zaleska-Dorobisz, T. Zak, E. Czapiga, K. Moron; Wroclaw/PL Purpose: The aim of this study was to establish the usefulness of power Doppler sonography and evaluation of contrast agent utility in ultrasound diagnosis in the assessment of thyroid nodules in children. Materials and Methods: 84 children were operated on for nodular goitre. Mean age was 13.6 years and ranged 7-18. Diagnostic assessment in all cases included US, thyroid hormones evaluation and US-guided needle aspiration biopsy. All patients were examined by power Doppler before thyroidectomy, 30 children were examined by power Doppler sonography after intravenous injection of Levovist. The vascular pattern on CDD and USCA divided the nodules on the Lagalla criteria. Definite diagnosis was based on histologic examination of the resected thyroid tissue. Results: Thyroid US aimed to assess precisely the morphology and topography. Multiple nodular lesions were diagnosed in 37 children and single nodule was identified in 28. Suspicion of malignancy was noted on cytology in 13 children. In 30 children using Levovist the study assesed the vascularity of 78 thyroid lesions. Analysis of the impact of contrast agent on the number of vessels visualized with regard to their histological status i.e. malignant or benign was performed. Conclusion: CDD and PD are important and are significant aids in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules in children, and in assesment of the degree of vascular change. Findings on USCA become highly predictive for malignancy only when multiple signs are simultaneously present in the thyroid nodule.",

Kawamata, M. Takasawa, N. Oku, A. Takahashi, J. Hatazawa; Osaka/JP Purpose: Cerebral blood flow (CBF) can be non-invasively quantified using the brain perfusion index (BPI) determined from radionuclide angiography (RA). For measurement of BPI, accurate determination of arterial input function (AIF) is necessary. We have developed a method for the automatic extraction of AIF using fuzzy clustering and a solid-state gamma camera (Digirad). Methods and Materials: RA was performed using Tc-99m HMPAO for 120 sec with a Digirad placed on the heart and a 4-head SPECT (SPECT2000H). For comparison, the data were also acquired using a conventional gamma camera (RC-2600I). The AIFs were obtained using fuzzy clustering (AIF a ) and manual drawing of a region of interest (ROI) (AIF m ) from the region of aortic arch. The ROIs were also drawn over the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The BPI values were calculated using spectral analysis (BPI a : BPI obtained using AIF a , BPI m : BPI using AIF m ). The deadtimes of Digirad and RC-2600I were measured using the reference source method. Results: The mean and SD of BPI m became larger with increasing ROI size, while the BPI a was almost constant regardless of ROI size. The SD of BPI a was smaller than that of BPI m . The deadtime of Digirad (0.92 \u00b1 0.63 \u00b5sec) was much less than that of RC-2600I (5.00 \u00b1 0.95 \u00b5sec). Furthermore, the deadtime of Digirad was almost constant regardless of the volume of phantoms, while that of RC-2600I increased with increasing volume.",

Repa 1 ; 1 Kaposvar/HU, 2 Budapest/HU Purpose: The effect of brachytherapy, characterized by rapid dose fall off from the radiation source, is different compared to external radiation. We used proton MR spectroscopic imaging to investigate brain tissue response to brachytherapy. Methods and Materials: Twenty glioma patients treated with surgery and/or brachytherapy were studied with MR imaging (T2 weighted images and post contrast T1 weighted images) and 2D proton MR spectroscopy (TR: 1500 ms, TE: 135 ms, voxel size 3.3 cm 3 ). Brachytherapy resulted in central necrotic zone, surrounded by an enhancing rim (demarcation zone) and an outer edematous zone on MR images. In each patient sample, spectra of the three zones and the normal appearing white matter were analyzed. Results: In demarcation zone, choline/creatine (Cho/Crea) ratio (2.9 \u00b1 1.33 vs. 1.04 \u00b1 0.23, p = 0.004, two-tailed unpaired Student's test) and choline/N-acetylaspartate (Cho/NAA) ratio (1.43 \u00b1 0.53 vs. 0.74 \u00b1 0.28, p = 0.003) was increased compared to normal white matter. In edematous zone Cho/Crea ratio was increased (1.31 \u00b1 0.33 vs. 1.04 \u00b1 0.23, p = 0.007), Cho/NAA ratio was not different (0.9 \u00b1 0.39 vs. 0.74 \u00b1 0.28, p = 0.21) compared to normal white matter. In demarcation zone we found elevated Cho/Crea ratio (2.9 \u00b1 1.33 vs 1.31 \u00b1 0.33, p = 0.03) and Cho/NAA ratio (1.43 \u00b1 0.53 vs 0.9 \u00b1 0.39, p = 0.006) compared to edematous zone. In the central necrotic zone we could only detect lipid and/or lactate peaks. Conclusions: MR spectroscopy demonstrates significant spectral differences in the brain following brachytherapy. Tumor recurrence can be suspected in cases where focal choline accumulation is detected.",

Klingebiel 1 ; 1 Berlin/DE, 2 Leipzig/DE Objectives: Suitability of quantitative CT-perfusion (CTP) imaging for assessing the early as well as final infarct volume in acute stroke patients. Material and Methods: Twenty-two patients with acute cerebral ischemia underwent CTP on admission. Parameter maps of cerebral blood perfusion (CBP), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and mean transit time (MTT) were generated using a parametric deconvolution algorithm. Additional diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) was performed in seven cases. Volume of diffusion abnormality was compared with the infarct volumes as assessed by two blinded neuroradiologists for each of the perfusion maps. In addition, final infarct volumes were determined on the basis of follow-up studies. Results: Mean volumes of ischemia as assessed by CBP, CBV and MTT were 38.5, 15.9 and 41.3 mL respectively. Amongst the patients in whom DWI was performed, six showed perfusions deficits in all perfusion images. In one patient, who had no DWI abnormality, perfusion deficits only were found on CBP and MTT images. Mean volume of DWI changes was 25.1 mL. The most significant correlation was found between the extent of CBV reduction and DWI infarct volume (r = 0.899, P < 0.01). Mean final infarct volume was 27.7 mL for all patients. CBV reduction showed the best correlation (r = 0.838, P < 0.01) with final infarct volume. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that CBV maps based on the CTP technique applied in this study permit prediction of infarct volume in early stroke, so CTP would deliver information about the ischemic penumbra.",

Cohnen, G. Kircheis, H.-J. Wittsack, F. Miese, F. Wenserski, A. Saleh, D. H\u00e4ussinger, U. Moedder; D\u00fcsseldorf/DE Purpose: To correlate quantitative changes of water content in brain parenchyma using magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) with different stages of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Materials and Methods: Forty-three patients with hepatic encephalopathy and 15 age-matched control subjects underwent MR imaging (1.5 T Vision, Siemens) including MTI, MR-spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Liver cirrhosis was due to alcohol in 26 patients whereas non-alcoholic disease was found in 17. Patients underwent assessment of critical flicker frequency (CFF) as test for HE with a frequency under 39 Hz considered pathologic. Magnetiza-tion transfer ratios (MTR) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were determined in basal ganglia, posterior white matter and pons using ROI-measurements. Single-voxel MRS was performed using a STEAM sequence (TE = 20 ms, TR = 1.5 s) assessing basal ganglia and posterior white matter. Results: MRS showed typical findings with decreased myo-Inositol combined with increased glutamine/glutamate with increasing degree of HE indicated by a reduced CFF. Compared to controls, MTR showed a significant decrease both in the basal ganglia as well as in the posterior white matter. In alcoholic subjects, this was independent from the degree of HE, whereas in posthepatitic cirrhosis a correlation was found. A non-significant increase in ADC was noted with a decrease of CFF in both groups. Conclusion: The results may indicate an increase of free protons in the brain parenchyma of patients with HE possibly supporting the hypothesis of a lowgrade cerebral edema. The differences between alcoholic and non-alcoholic subjects may hint at a general brain damage due to alcohol independent of hepatic failure.",

Okamura, N. Tsuyuguchi, K. Kitamura, N. Ozawa, S. Minamikawa, T. Tashiro, Y. Inoue; Osaka/JP Purpose: Among imaging modalities measuring regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), dynamic perfusion computed tomography (CT) studies are easy to perform and readily available without specialized equipment. However, quantitative studies comparing perfusion CT with positron emission tomography (PET) have been few. We assessed the correlation of CBF values obtained from perfusion CT and PET. Methods and Materials: Eleven patients with various cerebrovascular diseases underwent perfusion CT and PET. The perfusion CT studies were performed with a four-channel multi-detector row CT scanner. Four contiguous 8-mm CT sections were cine-scanned during a 36 mL bolus of intravenous contrast medium at a rate of 4 mL/s, with a total acquisition time of 50 s. CBF maps were obtained from perfusion CT data by central volume principle and deconvolution method. On CBF maps of both perfusion CT and PET, multiple regions of interest (ROI) were drawn independently, including frontal, temporal, parieto-occipital territories, caudate nucleus, thalamus and white matter in both hemispheres. ROIs were visually matched by agreement of three radiologists. Mean CBF values of multiple ROIs with both CT and PET were compared through linear regression analysis. Results: Correlation coefficients for individual analysis ranged from 0.657 to 0.833, overall 0.553. Linear regression analysis showed moderate correlation between perfusion CT and PET values (slope = 0.668, intercept = 21.958). Conclusions: Our study has shown moderate correlation of CBF values between perfusion CT and PET. Despite the various alterations of cerebral blood flow in our cases, perfusion CT studies were validated to be an easy-to-perform imaging technique to assess CBF values.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the early effect of normal aging on the regional distribution of brain metabolite concentrations, including N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho) and creatine (Cr). Methods: Seventy nine volunteers, ages 16 to 75 years, were examined by localized single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy at 1.5 T using PRESS 135 sequence.Voxels 2 x 2 x 2 cm were placed in the middle white matter (WM) of the centrum semiovale in the left hemisphere and in the occipital gray matter (GM) of posterior parietal lobes. The ratio of NAA/Cho were calculated, as well as absolute concentrations of NAA, Cr and Cho.Quantification was performed using method of external standard. Results: Absolute concentrations (mM/kg) of Cho increased with age both in WM (r = 0.42, P < 0.05) and in GM (r = 0.57, P < 0.05). Cr concentrations were much higher in GM than in WM and significantly higher in the old than young subjets (r = 0.41, P < 0.05). The change of WM Cr with age failed to meet P < 0.05 criteria.

To assess the diagnostic quality of radiographs performed in the emergency department in a major referral hospital. 2. To determine the type and number of inadequacy encountered most often. Materials and Methods: Two specialist registrars (Trainees) in radiology, reviewed 800 plain films performed in a busy emergency department. Films were examined for inadequacies, which impair the diagnostic quality of the examination. Despite artefacts or exposure problems, if a reasonable diagnostic conclusion could be made, the film was considered to be adequate. If a film was found to be inadequate, clinical details (that could have contributed to the poor quality) were looked at, and taken into consideration. Artefacts obscuring the area of interest, inadequate collimation, incomplete examinations and improper exposure factors were considered as inadequate. The number and the type of inadequacy, the type of examination were noted. Results: 1. The study showed that about 9% of the total films performed were inadequate. There are no national figures we could find to compare our results with to evaluate the performances on our emergency department. 2. The type of inadequacy encountered most often was the presence of jewellery obscuring the area of interest (27%), followed by artefacts caused by clothing (10%).

Acunas; Istanbul/TR X-ray usage as a diagnostic device was realized in Turkey first time at the Military Medical School in 1896 by Esad Feyzi, who was an intern and physics assistant. This new invention attracted attention so much that Dr. Salih and Rifat Osman also joined him and they started to work in a small unit, where they practiced radiographic examination.The following year, Yildiz Portable Military Hospital was reserved for wounded patients from the battlefield of the Ottoman-Greek War. This mobile hospital, which was activated in 1892, was exported from Germany and comprised Duquer system pavilions that were reassembled within 10 hours. They took away the X-ray equipment from the Military Medical School to Yildiz and began to produce images of bullet and shrapnel pieces from the patients sent from the battlefield. Kuttner and Nasse from German Red Cross came to Istanbul in 1897. They were surprised to see that this new invention was already being used there. On the Greek side English physicians used two X-ray devices that were transferred from England to Pire Harbour on May 1897. Therefore the Ottoman-Greek war took its place in medical literature as the first war that radiographic images were taken, first by the Turkish and soon after by German and English physicians. References stated that English physicians took X-ray images of wounded Greek soldiers and there is no record about Greek physicians taking part in this work. Turkish physicians continued to work on radiographic images during the war which they had started shortly after the discovery of X-rays. To demonstrate how to perform a numeric flow simulation in patient-specific vessels based on isotropic CTdatasets. To illustrate the possibilities of this promising tool on clinical cases. Background: CFD was introduced recently to investigate the behaviour of blood flow. Different studies determined CFD as a valuable method to demonstrate the flow and pressure. Most studies use simplified standard models for the simulations. This exhibit explains methodological aspects of CFD and how numeric flow simulations are performed in patient-specific vessels based on high-resoloution CT datasets. Possible applications of CFD in the cardiovascular field are discussed. Procedure Details: Isotropic CT-angiography data are used to segment the vessels. After generation of a surface mesh using the marching cube algorithm, the model is transferred into a volume mesh and the different entities and walls were defined. Specific parameters as velocity at the inlet boundary, flow parameters, and material specific parameters have to be assigned in a next step.The simulation itself provides detailed information about flow-behaviour and pressure. This helps to identify possible zones for development of artherosclerosis or, especially in aneurysms, locations for a possible rupture. Furthermore, blood flow can be quantified and e.g. effects of stent-graft implantations or the benefit of a coronary bypass can be demonstrated. Conclusion: CFD in combination with patient-specific patient-data is a promising method to visualise flow-effects. In the near future CFD will also gain increased importance for pre-interventional planning of vascular procedures. Background: Evaluation of the central veins is easily achieved with contrastenhanced MR angiography. \"Indirect\" CE-MRV, a technique where the veins are evaluated during the \"venous\" phase has been largely replaced by \"direct\" CE-MRV, a technique whereby dilute contrast agent is injected into the upper extremity veins and imaging is performed during the first-pass. Imaging Findings: In order to overcome T2*-induced susceptibility-effect commercial strength contrast-agent is diluted with saline. In our institution we use a 6% solution (3 cc of contrast agent in 50 cc saline). 1-3 cc of contrast is injected over the duration of the breath-hold scan (TR/TE/Flip 5 msec/2 msec/40 deg, Matrix 512 x 200, FOV 400-450 mm x 360 -450 mm. 32-60 slices, 4 mm interpolated to 2 mm). Mask subtraction of a pre-contrast scan is performed. The spectrum of findings in normal and diseased veins is illustrated. Examples of thrombosis, stenosis and occlusion of the central veins will be illustrated. Common pit-falls and artefacts will also be emphasised. Conclusion: \"Direct\" CE-MRV is an effective modality for evaluating the central veins. A simple robust method is presented, along with examples of the appearance in normal and pathological states.",

            "text": "Multidetector row CT angiography of the lower extremities for the assessment of traumatic vascular injury E.E. Williamson, J.C. Hellinger, A. Napoli, G.D. Rubin, D. Fleischmann; Stanford, CA/US Learning Objectives: 1. To describe the CT angiographic (CTA) technique used in the evaluation of traumatic lower extremity (LE) vascular injury. 2. To illustrate the spectrum of vascular and nonvascular pathology found during LE-CTA in the setting of trauma. Background: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) has long been considered the imaging standard for traumatic vascular injury. CTA is a more readily available, noninvasive imaging alternative which is less expensive, less resource intensive and can be used to assess bone and soft tissue injuries without the need for additional imaging tests. In this exhibit we highlight our experience with CTA in 27 trauma patients.Procedure Details: All examinations were acquired using 8 or 16-channel multidetector-row CT (MDCT). Contrast media was administered at 4-5 cc/sec using bolus-tracking technique. Thin section images were obtained from one vascular segment above the level of trauma through to the foot with collimation of 1.25 and pitch of 1.35-1.5. Table feed and gantry rotation speed were adjusted to optimize scan duration to match the peripheral delivery of IV contrast. All studies were reformatted in 3-dimensions using volume rendering, maximum intensity projection and curved planar reformation techniques. Conclusion: The spectrum of direct vascular injuries included large and small vessel occlusions, pseudoaneursyms, active extravasation, and vasospasm. Nonvascular pathology with indirect effects on the vascular system included complex fractures, open soft tissue wounds, hematomas, and joint effusions. CT angiography of the extremities is a promising technique in the evaluation of traumatic LE arterial injury with the ability to assess nonvascular injuries without the need for additional studies. There is a wide range of imaging techniques available for MRV evaluation of the central chest veins, including conventional non-contrast time of flight imaging and contrast enhanced methods such as the newer VESPA (venous enhanced subtracted peak arterial) sequences. Imaging Findings: Examples of common central venous pathologies will be illustrated from our database of over 120 patients, who underwent MR at 1.5 T using various sequences including non contrast time-of-flight, and post gadolinium true FISP, T1-weighted VIBE and 3D FLASH sequences. Typical scan parameters included matrix 512 x 200, FOV 400-450 x 360-450 mm, 32-60 slices, 4 mm interpolated to 2 mm. Common pathologies demonstrated included thrombo-embolic disease, central venous obstruction due to local tumour extension, congenital and acquired venous stenoses, AV fistulas and infected venous pseudo-aneurysms. Conclusion: MRV is a robust, highly accurate and non-invasive technique for assessment of central venous pathology.",

Gr\u00f6ller 1 , D. Fleischmann 2 ; 1 Vienna/AT, 2 Stanford, CA/US Purpose: The accurate determination of the central vessel axis is a prerequisite for automated visualization (curved planar reformation) and quantitation. The purpose of this work was to assess the accuracy of different algorithms for automated centerline detection in a phantom simulating the peripheral arterial tree. Materials and Methods: Six algorithms were used to determine the centerline of a synthetic peripheral arterial vessel (aorto-to-pedal arteries, diameter 18-0.6 mm) dataset (256 x 256 x 768, voxel size 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 mm). They are ray-casting/ thresholding (RCT), ray-casting/maximum gradient (RCMG), block matching (BM), fitting to ellipse (FE), center of gravity (CoG), and Randomized Hough transform (RHT). Gaussian noise with a sigma: 0, 5 and 10 was used to observe the accuracy of the method under noise influence. The accuracy of automatic centerline determination was quantified by measuring the error-distance between the derived centerlines, and the known centerline course of the synthetic dataset. Results: BM demonstrated unacceptable performance in large vessels (> 5 mm) when the shift used was less than 3 voxels. RCMG demonstrated a greater error (mean of the error 4.73 mm) in large diameter (> 15 mm) vessels than in small diameter (< 15 mm) vessels (mean of the error 0.64 mm). Because RHT and FE use Canny edge detector preprocessing, both are sensitive to noise. CoG and RCT keep the mean of the error-distance significantly smaller (0.7 mm and 0.9 mm respectively) than all other algorithms. Conclusion: CoG and RCT algorithms provide the most efficient centerline approximation over a wide range of vessel diameters.",

Materials and Methods: Fifty-one patients with thoracoabdominal disease underwent MRA of the bypass graft region. Subtraction maximum intensity projection (MIP) images and cine-mode displays were produced to identify the Adamkiewicz artery, its side of origin and branching level, and the drainage vein. For statistical analysis, signal intensity ratio (SNR) and contrast noise ratio (CNR) were also calculated. Results: In 46 (90.2%) of the 51 patients, at least one Adamkiewicz artery was seen to arise from an intercostal artery. Two Adamkiewicz arteries were identified in 9 (19.6%) of the 46 patients. Spinal drainage veins were visualized in 41 (80.4%) of the 51 patients, a single drainage vein in 30 of the 41 (58.8% of the total patient group) and two drainage veins in the remaining 11 (21.6% of the total patient group).

Jordaens 2 , P.M.T. Pattynama 2 ; 1 Belgrade/YU, 2 Rotterdam/NL Purpose: Electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVs) with radiofrequency ablation in treatment of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is associated with PV stenosis. Cryothermal ablation (CA) is a new promising method in treatment of these patients. Although initial experience of CA showed no associated PV stenosis, results at follow-up have not been reported. The aim of the study was to assess PVs for the presence of stenosis three months after CA by contrast enhanced angiography on 16-row detectors multislice computed tomography (MSCT). Materials and Methods: Twenty four patients (mean age 52.6 \u00b1 7.6 years, 15 males) with symptomatic atrial fibrillation underwent CA in 46 PVs. All patients underwent complete clinical work-up, electrophysiological study, ultrasonography and MSCT angiography before CA. MSCT pulmonary angiography was performed three months after the procedure to evaluate ostium and the proximal 10 mm of all PVs. Results: Dimensions of the treated PVs remained unchanged: the coronal ostial diameter was 19.1 \u00b1 2.4 preprocedural vs. 18.6 \u00b1 2.4 mm at follow-up, p < 0.05, ratio of coronal and axial diameter 1.2 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 1.2 \u00b1 0.1, p < 0.05, respectively and the coronal diameter of the proximal 10 mm from the ostium 17.1 \u00b1 2.5 mm vs. 16.5 \u00b1 2.2 mm, p < 0.05, respectively. Conclusions: CA of PVs in atrial fibrillation has not been associated with stenosis at the orifice and proximal 10 mm of the PVs after three months follow-up. MSCT pulmonary venography is a reliable, noninvasive method for assessment of PVs in a three-dimensional manner prior to ablative treatment and during the follow-up period.",

Imai 1 ; 1 Isehara/JP, 2 Wako/JP Purpose: To compare three different sequences of magnetic resonance (MR) venography without contrast media for patients with varicose veins below the knee. Materials and Methods: For 23 patients with lower extremity varicose veins, MR-venography using time-of-flight (TOF), fat suppressed T2-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) and balanced turbo field echo (bTFE) were compared.The original images on 1.5 Tesla Gyroscan (Philips) were transferred to a workstation (M900 Quadra, ZIOSOFT Inc.) and 3D images were reconstructed using maximum intensity projection (MIP), multiplaner reformation (MPR), and volume rendering (VR) techniques. For analysis, the veins were divided into superficial, deep venous systems, perforating and varicose veins, and were evaluated using three points scale by a radiologist and a surgeon.Results: Superficial, deep venous systems and perforating veins were best visualized on bTFE (p < .05), while varicose veins were equally visualized on TSE and bTFE. TOF provided poor visibility except in popliteal veins. Coexisting arterial system seen on bTFE could be discriminated from the deep venous system especially on axial reconstructed images. The varicose veins connected with the superficial venous systems and perforating veins on the surface of the muscle were easily recognized on VR only using bTFE. Conclusions: MR-venography using bTFE displays the best images of the whole venous system in patients with varicose veins below the knee.",

Subramaniam; Glasgow/UK Purpose: To assess the impact of joint surgical and radiological audit on the accuracy of MRA reports in the evaluation of potential live renal donors. Materials and Methods: We analysed the case records of live renal donors who underwent gadolinium enhanced MRA as part of pre-operative evaluation to assess renal vasculature between August 1999 and July 2002. In cases of discrepancy between MRA reports and surgical findings, studies were retrieved to the MRI workstation and subjected to detailed joint clinical and radiological review. Scan quality was assessed and sources of discrepancy were identified. Results: There were 45 donors, 23 men and 22 women. Reported MRA findings were fully confirmed at surgery in 38 of 45 cases. These scans were not analysed further. In 7 donors, the findings at surgery were discrepant with the radiological reports. There were 4 cases of \"missed\" early branches and 3 cases of \"missed\" accessory arteries. In the first year of audit there were 4 discrepant cases out of 18 (22%), all of which were radiological reporting errors. The number of discrepant cases in the second year dropped to 2 out of 19 cases (11%). Neither of these was a radiological reporting error. There was one \"missed\" early renal artery branch in the third year of audit, which was visualised on MRA review. Conclusion: The accuracy of preoperative MRA in potential live renal donors is high. Radiological reporting of MRA examinations is improved through careful clinical feedback, audit and interdisciplinary co-operation.",

Hor\u00e1k, M. Herman, J. Bucil, J. Klein, J. Nekula; Olomouc/CZ Purpose: To assess the feasibility and to evaluate the benefit of a 3D contrastenhanced (CE) MR portography (MRP) covering the entire volume of upper abdomen with maximal spatial resolution using GRAPPA (GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acqusitions). Materials and Methods: 12 patients were examined before or after surgical creation of porto-systemic shunt. T1-weighted 3D angiographic sequence with 3D centric reordering optimized using a GRAPPA factor of 2 was performed at a 1.5 T scanner (Siemens Symphony Maestro Class) in three phases after administration of 30-40 mL of 0.5-molar or 15 mL of 1-molar gadolinium-DTPA followed by 20 mL saline solution into the canula in antecubital vein. Anatomical postcontrast T1-weighted 3D spoiled GRE with Fat Saturation was added. Parameters of HiRes 3D-CE-MRA sequence: in-plane resolution = 1.5 x 0.9 mm, number of partitions = 80, slice = 2.5 mm, partial-Fourier = 6/8, FOV = 400, TR/ TE/FA = 3.55/1.28/25, TA = 27 sec. Results: Large evaluated volume HiRes MRP sequence is suitable for detailed postprocessing (subvolume MIPs) in any plane, imaging borderline vessels like recanalized umbilical vein or retroperitoneal collaterals, usually best seen in portal phase. Robust protocol can be very easily adapted for uncooperative patients covering the same evaluated volume. Functional information (flow direction) can be added with Phase Contrast MRA flow quantification sequence. Conclusion: Our preliminary results show that the application of GRAPPA allows to capture the whole portal vascular system without missing any important collateral with high spatial resolution in cooperative patients and with sufficient spatial resolution in non-cooperative ones. It's possible to image the flow in surgically placed porto-systemic shunts.",

Materials and Methods: In 24 patients, 48 carotid arteries and 48 vertebral arteries were evaluated with 16-MDCTA and conventional digital subtraction angi-ography (DSA). Standardized 16-MDCTA acquired from the circle of Willis to the aortic arch. 16-MDCTA data were displayed with maximum intensity projection (MIP) for carotid and vertebral arteries and with volume rendering (VR) for carotid artery. The percent diameter stenoses of the carotid artery bifurcation and vertebral artery origin were measured separately on MIP, and/or VR CT images and DSA. The carotid stenosis was graded as no, mild (< 30%), moderate (30-70%), severe (> 70%), and occlusion with NASCET criteria. The vertebral artery stenosis was also assessed with the same five-grade scale. The results of 16-MDCTA were correlated with the gold standard of DSA. Results: All carotid and vertebral arteries were assessable on MIP and/or VR CT images. Correlation between stenosis measured with 16-MDCTA and that measured with DSA were good (Pearson correlation: on carotid MIP images, c = 0.983, < 0.001; on carotid VR images, c = 0.992, < 0.001; on vertebral origin MIP images, c = 0.984, < 0.001). The aggrement rate of stenosis grading between 16-MDCTA and DSA was also high (91.7% on carotid MIP; 93.8% on carotid VR images; 91.7% on vertebral origin MIP images).

In 8.1% of patients brachial artery blood flow was less than 300 mL/min and in 7% of cases dialysis fistula flow was greater than 2100 mL/min. Conclusion: Only 11.6% patients had no abnormal either clinical, morphological nor flow parameters. 44.2% of patients had abnormal clinical and US morphological parameters. Colour Doppler ultrasound is more sensitive than clinical or laboratory methods in detection of hemodialysis fistula dysfunction. It is strongly recommended to start regular ultrasound examinations of all dialysed patients. Material and Methods: 50 patients with Brescia-cimino-shunts were examined by independent examiners with i. a. DSA and vascular ultrasound. All patients had a shunt-volume of less than 400 mL/min., an angiographical stenosis of the anastomosis of at least 50% or changes of the venous portion of the shunt were examined. Studies were performed with the aid of a multifrequency ultrasound probe (5-10 MHz, Logic 700, 9, GE) using B-mode, color coded Duplex (CCD) and B-flow, first of all in the brightness modification. Results: In the group of anastomotic stenosis measurements of intrastenotic diameter gave for i. a. DSA values of (average: 2.33 mm), for B-mode (average: 2.56 mm), for CCD (average: 2.88 mm), for brightness mode of B-flow (average: 2.27 mm) and for B-flow with B-mode information values of (average: 2.37 mm). The best agreement with DSA was achieved by brightness mode of B-flow. While in B-flow in cases of anastomotic lesion or venous stenotic lesions, hypoechogenic vessel wall alterations were detected, they were not seen in B-mode in any case and not reliably in CCD due to blooming artifacts. In cases of venous aneurysm and vascular elongation a flow detection free of artifacts was only demonstrated by B-flow. Conclusion: Ultrasound B-flow detects anastomotic stenosis of hemodialysis fistula better than other ultrasound modes. The visualization of hypoechogenic vessel wall alterations and the degree of stenosis is also better appreciated by this mode.",

All patients were radiotherapeutically treated 6 to 24 month ago. Internal mammary arteries were ultrasonographically investigated with 7.5 MHz linear transducer in longitudinal planes. Diameters of the arteries were measured in M-mode; resistivity indices (RI), pulsatility indices (PI), peak systolic and end diastolic values were measured with color Doppler USG. Mean values of the above mentioned parameters were statistically compared among patient and subject groups. Results: Mean diameter of the internal mammary arteries were found to be 19.02 mm in patients and 36.57 mm in control subjects. There was a statistically significant difference between two groups regarding the stated parameter (p < 0.001). In contrary, the difference of RI, PI, peak systolic and end diastolic values were not statistically significant in two groups studied. Conclusion: Shortly after radiotherapy the diameter of the internal mammary artery significantly decreases but its flow spectrum does not change. Ultrasonographically performed simple diametric measurements may be used as rapid and noninvasive screening tests to predict the development of coronary artery disease.",

Garz\u00f3n, N. G\u00f3mez-Le\u00f3n; Madrid/ES Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of multislice computed tomography (MSCT) after placement of endovascular stent-grafts for treatment of aortic aneurysms. Matrials and Methods: Seventy-six patients underwent MSCT angiography following treatment of thoracic or abdominal aortoiliac aneurysm with endoluminal stent-grafts. MSCT was performed from the supracoeliac aorta to the femoral artery bifurcation in patients with aneurysm affecting the abdominal aorta (n = 70), and from the thoracic inlet to the femoral bifurcation in patients with thoracic aneurysm (n = 6). The standardized protocol consisted of a nonenhanced CT (3 mm collimation, pitch of 4, reconstruction interval of 2 mm, table speed of 16 mm per rotation and a single-breath-hold acquisition), followed by a contrast-enhanced CT. All images were postprocessed in a workstation (Vitrea 2; Vital Images, Plymouth, Minn). The image postprocessing included multiplanar reformats, MIP, shaded-surface display, and volume rendering. The studies were assessed for stenosis, thrombosis, perigraft leakage, migration, angulation of graft, and enlarging sac size without visible endoleak (endotension). Follow-up CT was performed prior to discharge and at six and twelve months after intervention. Results: After stent-graft placement in the 76 patients, CT demonstrated graft permeability in 76 (100%), perigraft leaks in 17 (22%), angulation of the graft in 9 (12%) and endotension in 2 (2.6%). Conclusion: MSCT was able to study the entire aorta with a maximal and homogeneus opacification. The MSCT technique allowed fast scanning, great anatomic coverage during a single breath hold, few motion artefacts, and high spatial resolution in the longitudinal plane, improving the diagnostic accuracy of the examinations.",

Acar, B. Degirmenci, A. Yucel, R. Albayrak; Afyon/TR Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the measurements of vertebral artery (VA) flow velocity and flow volume for diagnosis of vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Matrials and Methods: We examined 96 patients referred for evaluation of vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Net VA flow volume and mean systolic flow velocity were determined by using color duplex sonography. We grouped the patients into three: group 1 consisted of patients with severely damped VA flow volume (< 120 mL/min), group 2 moderately damped (120-200 mL/min) and group 3, normal (> 200 mL/min). The mean systolic flow velocities in each group were compared by one-way ANOVA. Results: Damped VA flow volume was determined in 56 of 96 patients, of these patients 18 had severely damped, 38 had moderately damped, 40 had normal VA flow volume. Mean VA systolic flow velocities of group 1, 2 and 3 were 32 \u00b1 12, 42 \u00b1 10 and 46 \u00b1 8 cm/sec, respectively. Mean VA systolic flow velocity in group 1 was significantly lower than that of group 2 (p = 0.001). However there were no significant differences between VA systolic flow velocities in group 2 and group 3 (p = 0.2). Conclusion: According to our findings, measurement of VA velocity is enough for diagnosis of vertebrobasilar insufficiency in patients with severely damped VA flow volume but may not always be helpful in differentiation of moderately damped flow volume from normal. Therefore we conclude that for the diagnosis of vertebrobasilar insufficiency, measurement of volume in addition to velocity is necessary in detection of moderately damped VA flow volumes.",

Pozzi-Mucelli; Trieste/IT Purpose: To report our experience in rotational angiography (RA) after PTA of the femoropopliteal arteries and to compare this modality to standard anteroposterior (AP) projection. Materials and Methods: Forty patients underwent PTA of the femoropopliteal arteries in the last 12 months. Twentysix were stenoses (lenght: 1-5 cm) and 14 occlusions (lenght: 3-10). In all cases PTA was successful and the result was checked with AP projection and with an RA acquisition. The procedure were performed on the Philips Integris Allura System providing the RA tool. Results: RA after PTA was successful in all cases. In 42% of cases there was no difference between the static AP projection and RA, whereas in 47% the static acquisition, compared to RA, underestimated the degree of residual stenosis by 10-30%. In about 40% of these cases a disagreement on the presence and extent of subintimal flaps between static and rotational acquisition was identified. In another 11% of cases there was substantial agreement on the residual stenosis but not on the PTA-induced dissection which was always better identified on RA. Conclusions: RA allowed optimal evaluation of all cases improving the information on the conventional technique based on one or two projections. In our experience this information modified our therapeutic approach leading to repeated balloon angioplasty or stenting in 46% of cases. All the diagnosis were confirmed by digital angiography or surgical treatment. In the first group (endoluminal repair), the complications were: a) periprosthetic hematoma (n = 2); b) neointinal hyperplasia (n = 2); c) partial stent-graft thrombosis (n = 4); d) total stent-graft thrombosis of an iliac branch (n = 7); e) endoleak type II (n = 4); f) endoleak type III (n = 4), separation of the stents' components (n = 1). In the second group (surgical repair) we observed: a) periprosthetic infections (n = 3); b) supraprosthetic aneurysm (n = 1); c) pseudoaneurysm (n = 2); d) aortoenteric fistula (n = 2). Conclusion: CTA is accurate, fast and minimally invasive imaging method in the evaluation of complications after abdominal aortic aneurism repair.",

Potocki; Zagreb/HR Purpose: The purpose of the study was to evaluate positive MSCT-angiography findings in patients with spontaneus-nontraumatic aortic dissection. MSCTA is a noninvasive, time-saving radiological procedure for patients with aortic dissection because they need prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Aortic dissection is defined as a separation of the inner aortic wall layers. It is divided by Stanford classification into type A that involves the ascendent aorta and type B involves distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. Materials and Methods: MSCTA was performed in 42 patients (14 (33.5%) female and 28 (66.7%) male age 18 -81) with clinically suspected aortic dissection over a period of 14 months on Lightspeed Ultra 8 Slices, GE. Slice thickness was 2.5 mm with 50% overlap of reformatted images. We injected 100-120 mL of nonionic contrast material at a flow rate of 4 mL/sec with Smart Prep feature. MIP and MPR were usually used. Results: Aortic dissection was found in 29 (67.4%) patients. 21 (72.4%) had acute aortic dissection and 8 (27.6%) chronic type. Acute aortic dissection Stanford type A was found in 13 (62%) and type B in 8 (38%). In 13 patients we did not find aortic dissection but other CT findings could explain the symptoms: AA, rupture of AA, mesenteric ischemia, pericardial effusion. Conclusion: MSCTA is noninvasive, rapid and relatively comfortable radiological procedure for patients with suspected acute aortic dissection in cardiovascular emergency. This technique enables correct and detailed diagnostic information and obviates catheter aortography.",

Materials and Methods: Sixty-six patients who received catheter placement in the hepatic artery for arterial infusion chemotherapy were retrospectively recruited from the pool of clinical records between 1998 and 2003. Two interventional radiologists reviewed the digital subtraction angiographies (DSAs) and clinical records of these patients. They assessed the following items by consensus: 1) location of the RGA, 2) frequency of the patent pyloric branchs after coil embolizaton of the RGA, 3) outcome of arterial infusion chemotherapy through the catheter. Results: The location of the RGA could be determined in 58 patients. RGA-coil embolization was performed in 36 patients. In 7 patients, fine pyloric branchs were patent after embolization. They were too fine to be embolized by the catheter technique. In 2 of these 7 patients, the catheter was successfully placed to avoid the drug infusion into the pyloric branch. The clinical outcome of the other 5 patients were as follows: One patient received the arterial infusion chemotherapy without any complication. One patient experienced transient abdominal pain in the course of arterial infusion chemotherapy. Two patients received replacement of the catheter because of abdominal complication. The last patient received surgical ligation of the RGA because of reopening of the RGA.

Grenier; Paris/FR Learning Objectives: To be familiar with the radiologic features of Erdheim-Chester disease, a rare form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis of unknown etiology. Background: The disease is characterized by tissue infiltration with lipid-laden foamy histiocytes, polymorphic granuloma of inflammatory cells and collagen fibrosis. The patients have a mosaic of infiltrative involvement of various organs. Bone involvement is almost always present but often clinically asymptomatic. The prognosis depends on the severity of cardiovascular, renal or cerebral involvement. Imaging features of 10 histologically proven cases were reviewed. Imaging Features: Radiological bone involvement was present in all cases, characterized by bilateral and symmetrical spongy bone densification, cortical thickening and periostosis of long bones from the metaphysis to the diaphysis associated with scintigraphic tracer uptake. Renal and perirenal involvement seen on CT scans consisted of bilateral and symmetrical perirenal tissue infiltration (hairy kidney) (n = 6), extended to the adrenal fossae, the renal sinuses, and the proximal ureters. Cardiovascular involvement consisted in 1) thoracic and abdominal circumferential periaortic tissue infiltration (coated aorta) with extension to the coronary, supraaortic and pulmonary arteries, and abdominal branches, 2) stenosis of renal or mesenteric arteries (n = 3), 3) involvement of pericardium (n = 2) and myocardial mass (n = 1). Tissue infiltration involved pituitary in one case and orbits in another one. Conclusion: A diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease should be considered in patients who demonstrate bilateral and symmetric densification of the long bones with increased uptake on scintigraphy in association with perirenal fat infiltration and/or a periaortic fibrosis.

Pellets of labeled cells and non-labeled controls were evaluated by MR imaging. The cellular iron oxide uptake was proven by prussian blue stains and spectrometry as a standard of reference. In addition, cell viability was tested with the Trypan Blue exclusion test. Differences between labeled cells and non-labeled controls were tested for significance using the t-test. Results: NK-92 cells could be labeled with Ferucarbotran and Ferumoxides by lipofection and electroporation, but not simple incubation. Lipofection had to be performed for 24 h, but resulted in only minor, not significant impairment of cell viablility (88-92%) compared to controls (96-98%), while electroporation caused cell labeling within seconds, but reduced the viablility of the cells significantly (61-74%), thereby necessitating additional cell culture time for cell recovery.

Mugler 2 , E.E. de Lange 2 , W. Schreiber 1 ; 1 Mainz/DE, 2 Charlottesville, VA/US Purpose: Dynamic \u00b3He-MRI permits regional analysis of distribution ventilatory kinetics. Dedicated post-processing offers image-based lung function parameters. Sliding window reconstruction of interleaved-spiral acquisitions provides high temporal rates, but do functional parameter values depend on the temporal frame rate? Methods and Material: Single-slice coronal dynamic \u00b3He-MRI was acquired continuously for 15 s during free respiration. Image reconstruction was performed using sliding window technique with 3.4 ms data sampling-time (repetition-time 10 ms). Post-processing was performed using a self-written software with linear motion correction for calculation of: Rise Time (TR, interval of lung-signal from 10% to 90% of peak signal), delay-90 time (TD90, interval of trachea-signal 50% and lung-signal 90%), amplitude (peak lung-signal), and peak flow (PF, maximum signal slope). Analysis was done for 6 ROIs using a temporal resolution of 20 ms, 120 ms, and 240 ms (2 nd , 12 th , and 24 th image). This study included 4 exemplary patients (Asbestosis, 2 x Asthma, COPD) so far. Results: Post-processing of the data-sets lasted 30 to 120 mins at an actual PC (2.4 GHz P4, 2 GB RAM). TR ranged from 418 to 1707 ms (median 859 ms), TD90 ranged from 228 to 1427 ms (median 753 ms), amplitude ranged from 13 to 557 a.u. (median 130 a.u.), PF ranged from 12 to 710 a.u. (median 207 a.u.). No relevant difference was detected in the evaluation of different temporal frame rates for all patients or within an individual patient. Conclusion: Since these preliminary data suggest a limited effect of high temporal frame rates, improvement of spatial rather than temporal resolution might be the emphasis in the future. To determine the compensatory mechanisms involved in recovery of motor function following resection of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and their relation to the clinical characteristics of recovery. Subjects and Methods: Thirteen patients referred for surgery of low-grade gliomas located in the SMA were compared to nine healthy controls using fMRI before and after surgery during self-paced movements of both hands, successively. Activation within regions of interest (ROIs) (primary sensorimotor cortex (SMC), premotor cortex (PMC), SMA) were compared and tested for correlation with anatomical characteristics of the tumor and resection, and clinical data. Interaction analysis between ROIs was performed using partial correlation. Results: Tumor growth induced preoperative underactivity in the adjacent SMA and overactivity in the opposite SMA. Postoperative recovery was associated with recruitment of the lateral premotor cortex in the healthy hemisphere. In the affected hemisphere, pre-and postoperative correlations between SMA, PMC and SMC were decreased. In the healthy hemisphere, postoperative correlations between PMC and SMA or SMC were increased. Shortened onset and duration of recovery was associated with preoperative changes in SMA activation. Conclusions: These findings suggest that tumors induced a dysfunction in activation and connectivity of the ipsilateral SMA, which was partially compensated by a recruitment of the SMA in the healthy hemisphere. This preoperative remodeling of SMA activity did not prevent the occurrence of the postoperative deficit but was associated with shortened recovery. SMA resection was compensated by the recruitment of an ipsilateral premotor circuitry.",

Rees; Bristol/UK Purpose: To develop a resource for radiology undergraduate and postgraduate education from a series of research projects dealing with internet filter aided search. Supported by a research and education grant from the EAR. Materials and Methods: Two independent research projects into internet search were examined for their application to radiology education and these methods were compared to conventional image search protocols. This experience was translated into constructive advice for undergraduate students undertaking special study modules in radiology. The two internet filters developed were designed to improve accuracy of text search and to improve the search results from image search enquiries in radiology and medical subjects. A second iteration of the image search filter was developed to produce a web crawler that selected images from previously carried out text searches. The text and image based filters were tested with other search engines over a preset number of criteria. Results: Both the text based search facility and the image based facility showed advantages when compared to conventional search methods. The image search facility was successful in handling medical searches compared to common search engines and the web-crawler was efficient at producing a large number of images from selected sites. These methods were used to develop medical students skills in the use of the internet and has been used in the construction of radiology image based special study projects. Conclusion: Web based filter programmes and education in search techniques can result in improving the efficiency of internet based material for radiology education.",

Niethammer 2 , E. Sp\u00fcntrup 1 , E. Klotz 2 , R.W. G\u00fcnther 1 ; 1 Aachen/DE, 2 Forchheim/DE Purpose: In the work-up of pulmonary embolism (PE), CT allows for direct visualization of emboli. In addition, perfusion defects permit direct assessment of the extent of PE, using color-coded lung densitometry. This new image processing technique has been deployed for a 4-slice multi-slice CT (MSCT) system. For further improvement, a subtraction technique within a single breath-hold will be mandatory. Materials and Methods: Three healthy pigs underwent lung lavage to induce C-960 Assessment of the angioarchitecture and hemodynamic characteristics of cerebral AVMs by contrast enhanced static and non enhanced dynamic MR angiography M. Essig; Heidelberg/DE Purpose: The aim was to improve the definition of the angioarchitectural components of the AVM based on a dynamic MRA (dMRA) and a high resolution 3D multi-bolus and multi-phasic contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA). Both techniques will be compared with 3D-TOF-MRA and transfemoral high resolution plain film angiography performed for treatment planning. Materials and Methods: DMRA will be performed by tracking a blood bolus through a vessel structure using the spin labeling technique STAR (Signal Targeting with Alternating Radiofrequency Sequences). Time-resolved CE-MRA will be acquired with an ultrashort 3D fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence (TR/TE 2.3/0.9 msec) using asymmetric k-space sampling in readout, phase-encoding, and partition directions. Results: All used sequences were successful in the assessment of patients' cerebral AVMs. The integration of acquired images into the treatment planning protocol was possible for all modalities. The different AVM compartments, feeding arteries, AVM nidus, and draining veins were detected easily and best on the dMRA. The method also allowed to hemodynamically assess the malformations: small AVMs generally showed shorter shunt times, however, a short shunt-time was associated with a higher risk of bleeding. CE-MRA also proved to be superior than TOF-MRA in the assessment of the angioarchitecture, however, the time resolution of the dynamic varient was too slow to achieve a substantial hemodynamic characterisation. Discussion: DMRA and CE-MRA are better suited than TOF-MRA to assess AVM angioarchitecture. The differentiation of different compartments of the malformation and the hemodynamic assessment is best seen with dMRA.",

Todua; Tbilisi/GE Purpose: To assess the possible connections between diagnostic imaging (spiral CT, MRI) of retroperitoneal metastases of testicular tumor and the detection of paramagnetic centres and free radicals in the resected lymph node tissue after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). Materials and Methods: 23 patients with stage I morphologically confirmed nonseminomatous testicular tumors were subjected to RPLND. Diagnostic imaging included abdominal spiral CT with IV contrast and MRI. Specific tumor markers (AFP, CGT) were detected. Highly sensitive (10 10 -10 11 spin/gas) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of 46 resected lymph node tissue was performed to detect the presence of paramagnetic centres and free radicals (Fe 2+ , Mn 2+ , N0) signals. CT or MRI scans were judged as positive or negative for Rp metastases on the basis of size, contrast enhancement criteria and compared with morphological and EPR data. Results: In 14 patients estimated as N0 on CT and MRI the increased signals of free radicals were revealed in 2 tissues. Among 9 patients (N1) with 18 resected lymph node tissue, 5 showed low signals of Fe 2+ Mn 2+ N0 and 13 material (morphologically confirmed as metastatic) high signals of free radicals, while the increased presence of paramagnetic centers were not detected in these tissues. Spiral CT and conventional MRI fail to detect micrometastases in 3 cases.",

Franquet, S.E. Kalloger, A. Oikonomou, S.L. MacDonald, E.M. Baile, R.J. Mayo; Barcelona/ES Purpose: To compare gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography with contrast-enhanced spiral CT for the detection of small pulmonary emboli in pigs with and without pneumonia. Materials and Methods: Ten female juvenile pigs were anaesthetized, intubated and ventilated. Sub-segmental sized pulmonary emboli were introduced by injecting 4.5 mm methacrylate beads into the external jugular vein. Lung infiltrates were simulated by intra-bronchial injection of human plasma. Animals were imaged in the supine position at suspended inspiration with 15 cm H20 PEEP. Contrast media was injected via brachial vein. Dual gradient (TwinSpeed) 1.5 T MR images were acquired using 3 dimensional spoiled gradient-echo time of flight sequence; TR 4.8 msec, TE 1.2 msec, 45* flip angle, 6 mm section thickness, 32 cm FOV, 256 x 160 matrix, one average. Two MRA sets, pulmonary arterial and venous, were acquired in 39 seconds. Contrast enhancement was provided by 20 mL of Gd dimeglumine followed by 20 mL of normal saline, injected at 2 mL/sec. Non-contrast and contrast enhanced CT images were obtained using an 8 track spiral CT; 1.25 mm detector aperture, 90 mL contrast at 3 mL/sec. Subtraction perfusion images were calculated by subtracting contrast enhanced from non-contrast CT images. After imaging the pig was euthanized and a methacrylate cast of the pulmonary vasculature was obtained and used as a \"goldstandard\". CTA, CTA with subtraction perfusion images and MR images were independently interpreted by two observers in a blinded fashion. Results: No significant difference (p > 0.05) was seen between CTA, CTA with subtraction perfusion images and MR for mean sensitivity (86%, 88% and 68%) or mean specificity (94%, 94% and 73%), respectively. No significant difference (p > 0.05) was seen in sensitivity or specificity between pigs with and without infiltrates. A prospective power analysis based upon this preliminary data indicates that the addition of two more readers (N = 4) would yield significant differences (p\u00a30.05) between CTA and CTA with subtraction perfusion images compared to MRA for sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: Preliminary results indicate that CTA and CTA with subtraction perfusion images provide improved detection of sub-segmental sized PE in comparison to Gadolinium-enhanced MRA.",
