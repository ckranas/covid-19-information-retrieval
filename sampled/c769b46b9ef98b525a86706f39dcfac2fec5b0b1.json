The recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in China, which causes COVID-19 disease in humans, and its current spread to several countries, leading to the first pandemic in history to be caused by a coronavirus, highlights the significance of zoonotic viral diseases. Rift Valley fever, rabies, West Nile, chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, and influenza viruses among many other viruses have been reported from different African countries. The paucity of information, lack of knowledge, limited resources, and climate change, coupled with cultural traditions make the African continent a hotspot for vector-borne and zoonotic viral diseases, which may spread globally. Currently, there is no information available on the status of virus diseases in Africa. This systematic review highlights the available information about viral diseases, including zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, reported in Africa. The findings will help us understand the trend of emerging and re-emerging virus diseases within the African continent. The findings recommend active surveillance of viral diseases and strict implementation of One Health measures in Africa to improve human public health and reduce the possibility of potential pandemics due to zoonotic viruses.",

Only original research, natural case reports, or review articles were included in this systematic review. Experimental studies that did not report natural cases were excluded from this study. The articles were primarily searched through four databases, including National Library of Medicine, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NLM-NCBI)-PubMed, Google Scholar, the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED), and SCOPUS. The reported virus diseases in humans, livestock, wild birds, wild animals, pets, poultry, and slaughterhouses were screened. Initially, the databases were searched using variation of the search terms (\"Zoonotic virus diseases in Africa\" OR \"Virus zoonoses in Africa\"). Later, the search terms were further extended to search through the databases with individual country names for all the 54 countries that are located either within mainland African continent or its island nations. Therefore, the search terms were extended to, e.g., \"Virus zoonosis in South Africa\" OR \"Zoonotic virus diseases in South Africa\", as well as \"Virus zoonotic diseases in Zimbabwe\", \"Virus zoonotic diseases in Madagascar\", \"Virus zoonotic diseases in Mozambique\", and so on for all 54 African countries, including the island nations of Mauritius, Seychelles, Comoros island including Mayotte and Anjouan, as well as Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and La Reunion islands for the zoonotic virus diseases that were reported up until 25 September 2019.

A study included 21 samples from different bat species, including blood from live bats species of Miniopterus griveaudi and Chaerephon pusillus and brain tissues from dead bats, to investigate the prevalence of lyssaviruses. These bats were primarily hunted for bushmeat purposes. Initially, the sera samples collected from bats were heated for 30 min at 56 \u2022 C to inactivate the complement and then lyssavirus-neutralizing antibodies were detected in the samples using a miniaturized rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT). Additionally, real-time RT-PCR was conducted to detect lyssavirus RNA in the bat samples using specific oligonucleotide primers targeting a conserved sequence of nucleoprotein gene of lyssaviruses under investigation, including Lagos bat lyssavirus (LBV), Duvenhage lyssavirus (DUVV), European bat lyssavirus-1 (EBLV-1), as well as rabies lyssavirus (RABV). In this study, only two bat sera samples were positive for LBV seroprevalence while two other sera were positive for DUVV prevalence out of eight samples that were tested. None of the samples were positive for lyssavirus RNA by real-time RT-PCR [41] . Many other viruses (Ebola, coronavirus, rabies, etc.) were reported to be transmitted due to exposure to or consumption of wild animals. The eating of or exposure to wild animals always puts humans at risk of zoonotic virus disease transmission.",

A total of 1242 samples were collected from 7 representative species of rodents found in Madagascar. A total of 111/897 samples (12.4%) of Rattus rattus species and 2 out of 125 (1.6%) samples of Mus musculus species of rodents were found to be positive with nested PCR for the infection of Anjozorobe virus [55] . The study suggested a high zoonotic transmission risk to the human population living in households given the prevalence of Anjozorobe virus in household-dwelling rodent species [55] .",

Urine, blood, and wing biopsy samples were collected from 22 bats. Antibodies specific to soluble G glycoproteins of Nipah virus (NiV) confirmed that four samples were serologically positive for Nipah virus antibodies [60] . Based on Bayesian analysis, no bats were identified as the recent migrant or the first-generation migrant to their population in the regions. Thus, this study concluded that the E. helvum population across the sample sites in the African continent, including sites in Malawi, represented panmictic continental populations.

A study was undertaken to assess the zoonotic potential of two novel paramyxoviruses named Achimota virus 1 (AchPV1) and Achimota virus 2 (AchPV2) in 25 sera samples collected from a roost of fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) near Dar es Salam. Sera samples were collected from 226 children in the age group of 2 months to 13 years having febrile illness and admitted to a hospital. Serology confirmed that only one human sample (0.4%) was positive for AchPV2. Interestingly, three (12%) bat samples were positive for AchPV1 and two (8%) were positive for AchPV2 [67] . This study reported the prevalence of novel rubulaviruses named AchPV1 and AchPV2 across bat populations in the region. The human population living in proximity to the roost of E. helvum would be at risk if they came in contact with the urine, tissues, or excreta of these bats [67] .",

The first known CDV outbreak in SNP killed 54 lions (Panthera leo) in the year 1994 in a population of 250 lions; the dead lions had neurological disease symptoms of seizures and pneumonia [69] . This study included 23 dead lions, 13 symptomatic, and 72 apparently healthy lions in the SNP. Additionally, sera samples from 111 healthy lions collected over a period of 10 years from 1984 to 1994 were also analyzed to assess the CDV seroprevalence. Approximately 85% of the SNP's lion population was found serologically positive for anti-CDV antibodies [69] . CDV was successfully isolated from one lion. The investigation established that the virus in lions was closely associated with the virus reported from a dog found in the region, hence a transmission from dogs to lions was established, which not only affected the lions but other wildlife animals as well in the SNP [69] .",

This child reported fever, abdominal pain, and headache, which worsened as days passed by. The patient went into a coma after two weeks of the onset of the disease. Diagnosis was carried out for the possible viral and bacterial diseases being circulated in the region but were negative [74] . Hence, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples were used for viral metagenomic sequencing to investigate the possible etiological agent of the disease. However, the bulk of the sequence could not identify a probable virus, but two short reads exhibited some similarity with several orthobunyavirus genome L-segments [74] . Therefore, the technique of genome walking was used to further extend these reads up to 936 nucleotides. An orthobunyavirus known as Tataguine virus appeared to share some similarity with this 936-nucleotide sequence, but still there was significant genetic variation and thus, this sequence was considered of a novel orthobunyavirus, which was termed as Ntwetwe virus based on the name of the village of the patient. Ntwetwe virus was most likely referred to as an arbovirus vectored by Anopheles mosquitoes. There has not been any other case of Ntwetwe virus from this region; hence, the case of this girl child was a rare and unique Pathogens 2020, 9, 301 16 of 83 event.

Internal organs as well as oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from dead birds were collected and investigated for IAV infections. Wild birds exhibited the clinical symptoms of torticollis, depression, lethargy, and convulsions just before death. Since the tern samples were positive for the IAV, subtyping for H5 virus was done, which identified few H5-positive tern samples. Immediately after this outbreak in terns, the disease was also observed in chickens and ducks in Masaka district. Eighteen clinical samples obtained from chickens and ducks were investigated. Molecular investigation followed by sequencing identified the H5N8 virus in 17 samples. Phylogenetic analysis identified a high similarity (99.5%) of Ugandan H5N8 virus sequences with the H5N8 sequences reported from the Democratic Republic of Congo and a relatively lower identity (98.8-99 .1%) with the H5N8 virus sequences reported in 2017 from Egypt and South Africa [78] . This observation suggested a bird migration-related spread of H5N8 virus in the African continent.

Interestingly, genotype I was most widely distributed across the outbreak-hit regions and it was found that all the genotype I virus sequences were 100% similar for the nucleotide identity, which indicated that this genotype had a common origin [79] . Later, a second ASF outbreak occurred in April 2017 in domestic pigs. A total of 15 cases of ASFV with 11 fatalities in pigs were reported in a village. The sequencing and phylogeny confirmed that this outbreak was caused by the ASFV genotype II, which was circulating in the regions of South-Eastern Africa [80] .

Additionally, 23 of the rabies-positive samples were further considered for virus genome sequencing using the Sanger sequencing method. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the rabies virus sequences retrieved in this study appeared to be related to the sequences reported from south-east African countries [90] . In another comprehensive country-wide surveillance of rabies virus in Zimbabwe during 2014, brain tissue samples were collected from 13 domestic dogs from different households, as well as from one goat and 3 cows. Samples were subjected to the DFAT assay followed by nested PCR for the detection of the G and N genes of rabies virus. Interestingly, most of the samples tested in this study were positive for both the G and N genes while all of the samples were positive for the rabies virus G gene. Therefore, this investigation resulted in a 100% prevalence of rabies virus in the brain tissue samples of the dead canine, feline, and bovine animals included in this investigation. The reports on rabies virus predominance in Zimbabwe suggest a serious threat to the humans and domestic animals as well as wildlife in the country [85] .

Children with ILI reported a fever, cough, and sore throat. SARI cases reported having a fever, cough, and/or difficulty in breathing. RNA was extracted from the collected samples for the detection of IAV by real-time RT-PCR followed by IAV subtyping. Real-time RT-PCR samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) value up to 30 were considered for HA gene sequencing. The molecular investigation identified 112 IAV-positive children suffering from influenza-like illness while 12 children were IAV positive and suffering from the severe acute respiratory infection. Subtyping identified that 23 ILI cases occurred due to the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, while 51 were found to be positive for the IAV subtype H3N2. Interestingly, influenza B virus (IBV) was detected in 38 of the ILI cases. The study reported that 15 ILI cases belonged to the B/Victoria lineage of IBV while 10 IBV-positive samples belonged to the B/Yagamata lineage, but 13 other samples could not be ascertained. Similarly, seven cases of the SARI were due to IAV infection, five were because of IBV infection, two were due to the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, and another five were due to the H3N2 virus infection. This study reported that different types and strains of influenza viruses were responsible for inflicting ILI and SARI among children in Burkina Faso [93] .",

This finding speculated that there might be an incidence of zoonotic transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 to the exposed swine workers [31] . In a more recent investigation, 19 pig handlers working either at an abattoir or piggeries were enrolled for an investigation aimed at the detection of IAV. Simultaneously, nasal swab samples from 132 pigs were collected from an abattoir and piggeries in Kumasi during 2014-2015. The one-step RT-PCR for matrix gene detection followed by HA subtyping using one-step RT-PCR confirmed that two swineworkers were infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. One of these infections was from an abattoir worker while the other infection was from a piggery worker. Interestingly, 13 pig samples were also found to be positive for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus while three pig samples were infected with H3N2 virus.

The initial symptoms include fever and weakness in the early stage followed by headache, muscle pain, sore throat, diarrhea, and abdominal pain in the following days. The advanced stage symptoms may include seizures, disorientation, shock, and even coma [105] . The first case of Lassa fever in Ghana was a 19-year-old male who was a farmer and an active hunter. He felt febrile and had chills along with joint pain for about three days. He went on hunting with another household member and had a rat meal while he was symptomatic. His condition worsened over the next three weeks and he was hospitalized, where his condition became complicated and he died. The RT-PCR investigation of the patient's blood confirmed an infection with Lassa virus [105] . Interestingly, the second case was a 24-year-old male who had no contact with the first patient. He developed fever and had yellowish sputum with chest pain. Soon, his condition deteriorated, and he started vomiting blood and bloody sputum, following which he died in the hospital within hours. His blood sample was analyzed and found to be positive for Lassa virus infection [105] .

The tendency of this bat species to feed nearby human populations put humans at risk of potential exposure to its excreta, body fluids, and tissues, which raises the concern of zoonosis and public health. In another study, urine samples of from straw-colored fruit bats were collected from Accra during September to November 2010, which were used for virus isolation. Sera samples were also collected at two different times in 2007 and 2010. Sera were also collected from humans living nearby bat roost in Accra or from those who were involved in the hunting or butchering of bats. Novel paramyxoviruses named AchPV1 and AchPV2 were isolated from the bats [67] . To assess the zoonotic potential of the Achimota virus, 216 healthy human subjects were sampled. Sera of two febrile individuals reacted against the AchPV2 antibodies, which indicated the zoonotic potential of this novel bat-borne paramyxovirus (Achimota virus) and its ability of cross-species transmission to humans [67] .",

In August 2015, a nine-month-old female infant developed fever, vomiting, cough, and diarrhea. After preliminary symptomatic treatment, her condition was stable for the next five days, which later deteriorated with severe diarrhea and vomiting. The infant quickly developed respiratory distress while being shifted to the University Hospital but died on the way. Her buccal swab test was positive for Ebola virus by RT-PCR. The genome of this virus matched with the Sierra-Leone 3 lineage, which was endemic in the region of her residence during May-July 2015 [111] . To trace the source of infection, the deceased infant's parents were tested for Ebola virus infection using body fluid samples. Surprisingly, the mother's breast milk was found to be positive for Ebola virus RNA using real-time PCR with a threshold cycle (Ct) value of 23.3. Following sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, it was found that the virus from the breast milk was closely related to the virus from the infant's buccal swab. More interestingly, both isolates shared two unique single-nucleotide polymorphisms [111] . Hence, it became evident that the transmission happened to the infant through breast feeding from the mother. RT-PCR-based diagnostics confirmed that the virus was also present in the seminal fluid of the father of the infant. Sequencing revealed that this virus was part of the Sierra-Leone 3 lineage but was not close to the virus isolates from the infant and the mother [111] . This was a rare incident reporting the Ebola virus transmission to an infant from the mother via breast feeding.",

Upon investigation, the woman's serum was found to be positive for the Ebola virus antibodies with the ELISA test. The genome sequence of this virus revealed that the virus did not belong to the circulating clade of Sierra-Leone 3 in that area; rather, it belonged to another lineage GN1 [113] .

The investigation learned about new cases of the disease, which were transmitted among the family members of the three patients who recently died of the disease. By the end of April 2016, there were seven confirmed and three likely cases of the Ebola virus disease in the region, eight of which died during treatment. Since these people lived in the forest region, a spillover event from a wild animal reservoir was suspected. To rule out any speculations, the blood samples from two confirmed cases were collected and sequenced. The analysis confirmed that neither sequences belonged to the Sierra-Leone 3 nor GN1 clusters but were associated with the sequences reported during the 2014 outbreak [114] . Hence, these results ruled out the possibility of transmission from an animal reservoir. Further investigation revealed that one of the survivors had sexual contact with the deceased first case as well as other sexual partners. It was noted that this survivor's seminal fluid sample was positive for Ebola virus, with a Ct value of 23.4 on 21 March 2016, which was again positive with a Ct value of 32.4 on 9 April 2016. The survivor's seminal fluid was collected on 21 March 2016 and viral RNA was sequenced; the results showed identical sequences from both survivors. Sequences from the other cases confirmed that the disease cluster was linked to the survivor, who sexually transmitted the disease to other individuals. Intriguingly, the molecular assays and sequencing provided evidence that the Ebola virus was persistently present in the survivor's seminal fluid between 26 October 2014 and 9 April 2016. This was new information indicating that Ebola virus was persistent in the seminal fluid of the patient who was cleared of infection following the standard protocol even after 531 days of the first diagnosis, the longest period reported so far [114] .",

Another surveillance study was conducted to find out the animal reservoir of the Lassa virus in Guinea [116] .

It is believed that HTLV-1 originated in Africa from monkeys in the wild and was transmitted to humans as a result of animal-human contact due to the social and cultural practices in rural communities. Rural Guinea-Bissau has been reported to have a 5% HTLV-1 prevalence in West Africa, which is the highest known prevalence in the region. Unfortunately, due to a lack of genomic data, information on the circulating subtypes of the virus was unknown until recently. The pattern of transmission within communities was also unknown. Hence, to find out the disease epidemiology and transmission patterns of HTLV-1, adults and children from the Caio community in the country were sampled. The status of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 was determined through the ELISA test. The outcome was further confirmed with PCR using tax/rex gene-specific primers. Additionally, the long terminal repeat (LTR) and p24 regions of the virus genome were sequenced for 72 individual samples to analyze the disease [117] . Based on the LTR sequences, phylogenetic investigation confirmed the presence of the HTLV-1 subtype 1a in majority of the Caio sequences. However, interestingly, one virus sequence was divergent and was found to be closely related to the HTLV-1 subtype 1g, which was basically isolated from a hunter in Cameroon. This finding was further supported by analyzing the p24 sequences obtained from 36 individuals [117] . This was the first report of a novel HTLV-1 subtype 1g from Guinea-Bissau and it was speculated that transmission probably happened either through human-to-human contact or from the wild.",

In total, 35 of the 511 tested M. natalensis sera samples were positive, with a seroprevalence rate of 6.8% [120] . Interestingly, the study findings revealed that a 14.2% seroprevalence rate was found in the M. natalensis population captured from southern Mali, especially the surrounding villages nearby Soromba. Real-time and conventional RT-PCR analyses revealed a prevalence rate of 7.7% (19/246) . Intriguingly, >99% of the rodents captured from southern Mali were M. natalensis species [120] .

As a result, many ruminants, including cows, goats, and sheep, were reported to have fever, increased salivation, abortions, and death during the outbreak. An investigation was soon launched after the disease symptoms in ruminants were reported in the country. In the early phase of the investigation, sera samples were collected from 13 symptomatic humans as well as 6 animals, including one camel, one cow, 3 goats, and one sheep. The collected sera samples were tested for a panel of arboviruses, including chikungunya virus, dengue virus, YFV, and WNV, as well as hemorrhagic fever viruses, including CCHFV and RVFV. Three animals, including one cow, one goat, and a sheep, were found to be positive for RVFV through the RT-PCR assay. Further, during August-December 2016, a total of 399 human sera samples were collected. RT-PCR and ELISA tests identified 17 RVFV cases. More precisely, nine sera samples were found to be positive with RT-PCR while eight samples were positive for ELISA using specific antibodies. Strikingly, 33 human subjects under investigation were reported dead during this period. This was the first report of RVFV from Niger. The findings of this investigation showed the high probability of virus zoonosis between ruminants and the exposed human population in the region. Interestingly, the study also suggested that large human gatherings during festivities where ruminants are traditionally sacrificed along with environmental factors like wet climatic conditions may potentially aggravate the spread of the disease [124] .",

Hence, an investigation was carried out to determine if the agricultural workers exposed to poultry had evidence of disease transmission. The study included 316 farm and open market workers from four towns in the south-western part of Nigeria who were exposed to domesticated poultry, including chickens, geese, ducks, pigeons, and turkeys [125] . The MN assay showed eight poultry-exposed workers and two non-exposed individuals had elevated antibody titers against three subtypes of avian influenza viruses viz., H5N1, H5N2, and H11N1, and one avian-like influenza virus H9N2 subtype [125] . Interestingly, one non-exposed individual was seropositive for IAV H5N1 subtype, which indicated the possibility of subclinical avian influenza H5N1 infection in the past. One poultry-exposed worker was seropositive for two viruses: H11N1 and H9N2, which indicated that this person was infected with two influenza viruses at some point of the occupational exposure. The study had three categories of exposed individuals: poultry industry workers, meat processors, and poultry market workers. These individuals had been in their professions from three to 20 years. This investigation reported the zoonotic transmission of avian influenza virus from domestic poultry to humans, but more interestingly, the findings also suggested that subclinical infection with avian influenza virus may also trigger zoonotic transmission of the disease [125] .",

Surprisingly, real-time PCR analysis confirmed that 43 swine samples were infected with the IAV [30] . Intriguingly, clade-specific real-time PCR determined that 22 swine samples represented the H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1c; the phylogeny confirmed the transmission of the virus from avian species to the swine. This was the first report of the H5N1 prevalence in a swine population from Nigeria [30] . The mechanism of transmission of avian-like influenza H5N1 virus subtype to the swine population may be explained by the introduction of the virus into the swine population through wild birds. The lack of proofreading as well as post-replication repair mechanisms due to error-prone RNA polymerase, which are known to make IAV a highly versatile virus in terms of genetic reassortment and evolution, may facilitate the adoption of avian-like influenza viruses into swine, where it would evolve through reassortment [30, 126] .",

Approximately 3 mL of blood were collected from 96 pet dogs as well as from 89 village dogs living in hunting communities. The HI assay using specific antibodies detected that 75 dogs were seropositive for canine influenza virus H3N8 antibodies while none of the dogs were positive for canine influenza virus H3N2 subtype. However, most of the pet dogs sampled at Ibadan and Lagos veterinary clinics were vaccinated for rabies virus and canine distemper virus, but the seroprevalence of canine influenza virus H3N8 subtype in pet and village dogs puts the companion human population at risk for disease transmission [130] .",

The first known case appeared in an eleven-year-old boy in the year 1971 who developed MPXV disease symptoms, including a rash, sore throat, fever, and headache, among other symptoms. Subsequently, other family members contracted similar disease symptoms, but the epidemiology of the disease could not be ascertained. Later monkeypox outbreaks in the country reported at least 262 suspected cases, out of which 7 patients died while another 115 cases were confirmed for the MPXV disease [119, 131] . The investigations reported that these outbreaks were not imported but most probably resulted due to a spillover from a possible reservoir host within the country. According to a recent report, during 1971 to 2018, a total of 118 confirmed cases and seven deaths due to MPXV disease were reported [132] . Another study reported that a third outbreak of the MPXV disease occurred in September 2017, during which 61 cases were confirmed out of 172 suspected cases across 14 states [4] . WHO reported 244 suspected cases of MPXV disease; 101 cases were confirmed during 2010 to 2018 [133] . It has been suggested that the cultural and traditional practice of bushmeat hunting and trade puts individuals at risk of disease transmission from wild animals to humans. Apart from this, exposure to the body fluid of infected individuals is an important factor for human-to-human transmission of the disease [4] .",

Interestingly, the phylogenetic analysis based on the HA1 sequences of five A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses retrieved in this study reflected a close association with the sequences reported from Cameroon, Ghana, and Cote d'Ivoire [95] .",

This study included 855 samples collected from patients admitted to the Ebola care centers in different districts in the country during December 2014 and September 2015. The total nucleic acid extracted from these samples was screened for Ebola virus RNA using real-time PCR. The samples were divided into two pools: The first pool was screened using 73 Ebola virus-specific primer-pairs in the presence of five human housekeeping genes as a control. Samples in a second pool were screened using 72 Ebola virus-specific primer-pairs and the housekeeping genes as controls. Ion Torrent Hi-Q sequencing generated 554 Ebola virus genome sequences from the positive samples [144] . Blood, buccal swab, breast milk, and semen samples were successfully used to recover the Ebola virus genome sequences greater than 10 kb in this study. Based on the genome sequences, the study reported that at least nine different lineages of Ebola virus circulated in this outbreak. Interestingly, eight virus lineages appeared to be variants of the Sierra Leone 3 lineage, which was first reported in June 2014, while one cluster appeared to have derived from the GUI-1 lineage, which was originally reported in Guinea. This study reported human-to-human transmission of Ebola virus through birth, contact, and breast feeding [144] .",

To investigate the status of poultry flocks, 147 trachea and cloacal swab samples were collected from 7 regions encompassing 19 different sites. Additionally, biopsies of the internal organs were collected from the dead post-mortem poultry birds. RNA was extracted from the poultry samples and were subjected to real-time RT-PCR for the detection of the M-gene. Further, IAV-positive samples were tested for the H5 and H7 subtypes. The H5-positive samples were also tested for the N1 gene for confirmation of the subtype. The results revealed that out of 147 poultry samples, 58 were positive for IAV. Subtyping identified 34 poultry samples that were positive for H5N1 virus. Simultaneously, blood samples along with oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from poultry workers or poultry-exposed individuals who worked either at the poultry farm or in a live poultry market for investigation. Only 15 human samples were found to be positive for IAV, which were successfully subtyped into 11 isolates of H3N2 virus, while four isolates could not be subtyped. Seroconversion was detected only in two poultry workers [167] . Sera samples were collected from 29 swine herds during May-June 2011. A total of 197 sera samples from 29 swine herds were collected from the majority of healthy or clinically normal pigs while only a small percentage of pigs had diarrhea. Sera samples were tested by a virus microneutralization assay using MDCK cells given its higher sensitivity over the HI test. The results found that nine swine herds were positive for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus while the nine other herds were positive for H1N1 virus. This study suggested that IAV was in circulation during 2011 [129] .",

It was also thought that these people might have spread the disease among others in their contacts.

The laboratory investigation revealed that the first two outbreaks, which resulted in 16 cases with four deaths, were primarily due to the MPXV infection. Two outbreaks were due to cocirculation of MPXV and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which claimed one death out of seven cases, while two other outbreaks were found to originate from chicken pox infection among six people.

On 8 October 2009, samples from the index case woman were found to be positive for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus through real-time RT-PCR. Immediately after this report, the authorities started tracing the contacts of the index case woman. Her friends, neighbors, the office where she worked, the hospital where she got treated, as well as the school where her children went for education were among the most probable spots for infection, hence these were investigated. All the suspected cases were sampled for nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs for diagnostics of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.

It was believed that the disease first appeared in domestic poultry, which quickly affected backyard chickens and commercial poultry, and hence became zoonotic. However, there was no human-to-human transmission reported, but interestingly, three family clusters were reported. The first family cluster, which comprised of two siblings, was reported in March 2006. The second cluster, comprised of three family members, was reported in December 2006. The third cluster, also comprised of two siblings, was reported in March 2007. However, in the first two clusters, the individuals shared a common exposure, of course, to the infected poultry and as a result became sick, while the siblings in the third cluster had two separate exposure incidences to the birds, which were most likely infected [196] . The common symptoms reported upon illness were fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, muscle or joint pain, and headache. There were 19 cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome, out of which 18 died. Six other patients died, increasing the toll to 24 (38%). The virus was successfully isolated from 34 case patients [196] . Sequencing of the HA and NA genes confirmed that the virus belonged to clade 2.2. The isolates of the virus were found to be related to the ones reported from Europe and the Middle East [197] . Domestic poultry infected with H5N1 were the likely source of infection among humans as many of the cases were either in direct contact with backyard poultry or were involved in the production and distribution of flocks [196] .",

However, 122 out of 157 nasal swabs collected during 2014-2015 were found to be positive for IAV. The subtyping RT-PCR based on HA gene amplification was conducted to distinguish among the H5, H9, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. It was found that 46 swine nasal swabs were found to be positive for the H5N1 subtype, seven were positive for the H9N2 subtype, and 69 samples were positive for the A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype.

Following the declaration of the yellow fever outbreak, 605 symptomatic cases were considered for investigation from 42 different sites in the outbreak-hit areas in country. The symptoms included febrile illness, jaundice, hemorrhage, and eventually death in severe cases [226] . A total of 45% of the cases belonged to nomads or pastoral communities who were sampled and interviewed to find out the epidemiology of the disease. The investigation interestingly reported that a small rural area where the infected pastoral population stayed for some time while migrating to other locations notified the maximum number of symptomatic cases. The outbreak was so severe that 163 patients died out of 605 reported cases in a short period of time. A higher number of cases were found in males (61%) than females (39%). The collected blood samples were tested and several of them were found to be positive for YFV, chikungunya virus, dengue virus, and WNV [226] . Thirteen adult mosquitoes of the Aedes aegypti species were also collected from the outbreak regions, but this study could not correlate the outbreak with the mosquito vectors sampled in the region. According to the interviews taken from the reported cases, it was evident that the disease most likely spread from human to human and most of the cases were reported from rural areas [226] .",

Samples were subjected to a direct rapid immunohistochemical test (DRIT) and direct florescent antibody (DFA) test. Additionally, 21 brain tissue samples were used for total RNA extraction followed by RT-PCR for the sequencing of the genome. The diagnostics confirmed that 72 of the 96 tested samples were positive for rabies virus infection. A sample obtained from a single cat was negative for the infection. In total, 30 of the 39 cattle samples were positive for the rabies virus using both diagnostic tests. Additionally, 36 of the 41 dogs were found to be positive for the rabies virus infection. Further, three goats, one horse, and six sheep were also found to be positive for the rabies virus. The phylogenetic analysis of the selected samples resulted in three clusters, where one cluster represented the rabies virus sequences retrieved from dogs while the sequences in the second cluster represented the relatedness with the rabies virus sequences reported from the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. Interestingly, the sequences in the third cluster represented the samples originating within Lesotho and a few of the samples reported from the Free State Province of South Africa. The findings of this investigation reported the circulation of rabies virus among domestic animals in Lesotho [233] .",

A rabies fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test was conducted to assess the seroprevalence of rabies virus in the samples. Only seven sera samples were found to be positive for the rabies antibodies. On the other hand, a serum neutralization test was conducted to investigate the seroprevalence of CDV, which observed 62 positive samples. Four rabies virus isolates were successfully recovered from the brain tissues of the killed jackals. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these sequences were identical to the rabies virus isolates reported from the jackals, greater kudu, and dogs in the same geographic area. Therefore, these findings suggested a zoonotic transmission of rabies virus among dogs, greater kudu, and jackals in Etosha National Park [234] .",

Penguins were reported to die after having severe disease symptoms, including torticollis, incoordination, corneal opacity, lethargy, and a state of comatose. The liver tissue sample from one symptomatic penguin and three cloacal samples from other sick penguins were collected and processed for RNA extraction. Quantitative RT-PCR detected the matrix gene sequence of the H5 strain of IAV. For further characterization of the virus, partial segments of the HA and NA gene sequences were amplified from the liver tissue and cloacal samples. Sequence analysis identified the HPAIV strain H5N8 in the penguin samples and revealed that the H5N8 virus in African penguins in Namibia is identical to the H5N8 virus reported in 2017 from South Africa [235] , which suggested the circulation of the H5N8 virus in the southern African region.",

Interestingly, since all 60 sera samples were found H5 and H7 negative, the farm owner expressed disagreement and felt that his birds were culled unfairly. As the set procedure, the entire ostrich flock was bled before culling at an abattoir and further tested for H5N2 subtype based on NP-specific ELISA.

Intriguingly, the attending paramedic and nurse developed similar symptoms and died due to severe complications, with symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fever [266] . The diagnosis confirmed an infection with Old World arenavirus. The reverse-transcription PCR procedure yielded approximately one 300-bp glycoprotein gene and another approximately 1000-bp nucleoprotein gene. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the etiological agent of the viral hemorrhagic fever was a novel arenavirus, hence it was named Lujo virus [266] .",

The results were positive for rabies, but the fluorescence was more intense than what is usually seen in rabies cases; hence, another lyssavirus infection was suspected. A panel of antibodies was used that differentiated amongst lyssaviruses and confirmed that the cats were infected with Mokola virus [270] .

For whole-genome sequencing, RNA was extracted from the fecal sample and was subjected to a sequence-independent amplification method. Sequencing was done by the ultra-deep sequencing method. The assembled sequences were analyzed using BLAST for the identification of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these rotavirus sequences from South Africa clustered with the rotavirus sequences reported from Brazil, the USA, and Japan [288] . In another report, diarrhea was reported by a farmer in six-week-old piglets on a Warmbaths farm in northern Transvaal. Internal organ samples from two autopsied pigs were submitted for electron microscopic examination. Fecal samples from the pigs were negatively stained and examined under an electron microscope, which identified the particles of two distinct viruses. Based on the morphology (well-defined circular particles) and particle size, it was determined that the swine fecal material had rotavirus particles [289] .",

Additionally, 50 samples were included from non-aquatic birds, including pigeons, doves, and sparrows, in this study. Sera samples were screened for avian influenza virus using ELISA followed by the HI assay with specific antibodies to detect avian influenza viruses. Only eight aquatic wild bird samples were HI positive for avian influenza virus. These positive samples were characterized as H10N9 avian influenza virus.

Veterinarians and farmers were contacted, and relevant questionnaires were obtained to understand their response about the predominance of Orf virus disease within the country. Simultaneously, ruminants and cattle exhibiting Orf virus disease symptoms were included in the study. During the investigation, suspected cases of cows, goats, Boer goats, and sheep showing any lesions or scabs were sampled. DNA was extracted from the samples and a 594 base-pair sequence of the B2L gene, which represents a conserved region in the Parapoxvirus genus, was amplified. Amplicons were sequenced and sequence analysis of the nucleotides and amino acid alignments was carried out using the ClustalW method. This study successfully retrieved Orf virus sequences from six Boer goats, two goats, two sheep, and two cows. Interestingly, Orf virus infection was reported in one human individual who developed a blistering lesion on the thumb of one hand during the study period.

However, all the samples were negative for HIV, and four clippers were found to be positive for HBV infection. These four positive HBV clippers had enough DNA copies to trigger the transmission of the disease. This study revealed the risk of HBV transmission through clippers used in haircuts at barber shops.

The patient was described to be in a high state of agitation with profuse sweating and muscle spasms of the back and neck. The patient was recently bitten on the lip by a bat, which was thought to be the cause of the disease. The initial disease symptoms were headache, muscle ache, sleeplessness, and difficulty in swallowing, which later progressed into profuse sweating and agitation. Muscular spasm and dyspnea of the mouth and throat muscles occurred at each attempt at drinking water. The patient was immediately admitted to a hospital in Pretoria with an initial diagnosis of rabies. At the hospital, the patient underwent intense pain and spasms of the pharyngeal muscles along with the arms and upper body parts whenever he was coaxed to drink water. The following night, the patient became violent and by the morning was seen frothing from the mouth, smashed the Vacoliter bottle to the wall, and kicked the attendants. Within 24 h after admission to the hospital, the patient died of respiratory arrest and seizure. The necropsy examination revealed that the brain was slightly congested while the lungs were severely congested along with other nervous system-related conditions. The brain tissues of the deceased were taken for a fluorescent antibody test of rabies but was found to be negative. Several attempts for rabies diagnostics were made but all were in vain. Experimental infection of mice introduced the ascending paralysis, culminating in death. It was considered a new virus strain and hence was given a new name 'Duvenhage virus (DUVV)'. This was the first original report suggesting the zoonotic transmission of DUVV isolated from a South African male in 1970 [295] .",

            "text": "Briefly, in this review, important virus diseases reported from countries in Africa were highlighted. The findings of this review are crucial in the context of the prevalence of virus diseases circulating across Africa and therefore, the data would be useful for designing studies focusing on virus diseases in Africa in the future. Interestingly, this review highlighted the circulation of Achimota virus, Duvenhage lyssavirus, Lagos bat lyssavirus, European bat lyssavirus, Achimota virus, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, and coronavirus through the bat species E. helvum ( Figure 18 ). This information established bats as a potential natural reservoir for these zoonotic viruses that impact animal and human health. Cattle were also found to be infected with rabies virus, IDV, Kunjin virus, RVFV, Langat virus, WNV, and Wesselsbron virus. The reports of IDV infections in cattle were relatively interesting in the context of the host range of IDV ( Figure 19 ). Cattle were also found to be infected with rabies virus, IDV, Kunjin virus, RVFV, Langat virus, WNV, and Wesselsbron virus. The reports of IDV infections in cattle were relatively interesting in the context of the host range of IDV ( Figure 19 ). Cattle were also found to be infected with rabies virus, IDV, Kunjin virus, RVFV, Langat virus, WNV, and Wesselsbron virus. The reports of IDV infections in cattle were relatively interesting in the context of the host range of IDV ( Figure 19 ). This reflects that IAV, WNV, and RVFV have a wide host range. An IAV prevalence has been reported in pigs in Kenya [29] . Interestingly, pigs have recently been reported to be infected with the HPAI H5N1 subtype in Nigeria [30] and with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Nigeria, Ghana [31] , Cameroon [32] , and Togo [33] . Pigs were found to be positive for the HPAI H5N1 subtype and LPAI H9N2 subtype in Egypt during 2014-2015 [34] . Apart from this, hepatitis E virus, calicivirus, rabies virus, African swine fever virus, rotavirus, and several other viruses have been reported to infect pigs in African countries ( Figure 21 ). Sheep were the other host that was reported to harbor RVFV, WNV, rabies virus, Langat virus, Kunjin virus, Wesselsbron virus, and IDV ( Figure 22 ). Abortions and mortalities were reported among pregnant sheep that were infected with RVFV during gestation [213] . This reflects that IAV, WNV, and RVFV have a wide host range.

Virus disease pandemics have always been challenging for mankind, regardless of whether it was the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic [297] , the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, or the more recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in late December 2019; the latter is ongoing as of the date of this publication. One of the most crucial factors reported behind the transmission of influenza virus was its dependence on the relative humidity and temperature, which have proved to be important environmental conditions behind the emergence of influenza virus disease [298] . A high population density, rapidly changing environmental conditions, migration, and international travel coupled with rapid aging may facilitate virus dissemination and evolution, which may be crucial for the progression of emerging viral infectious diseases [299] . Recently, an Ebola virus outbreak was reported from the countries in West Africa. The zoonotic transmission of Ebola virus was reported from Cote d' Ivoire in 1994 from chimpanzees to humans [71] . The Ebola virus disease was reported to be spread further through human-to-human contact and siblings within a household were found to be positive for the Ebola Virus disease pandemics have always been challenging for mankind, regardless of whether it was the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic [297] , the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, or the more recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in late December 2019; the latter is ongoing as of the date of this publication.

The seroprevalence of anti-RVFV antibodies in ruminants, including cattle, goats, and sheep, living around wetland areas in Africa suggested the role of wet environmental conditions in disease progression [92] . Exceptional rainfalls led to flood-like situations in African grasslands, which have been reported to serve as favorable sites for the RVFV vector, the Culex mosquitoes; as a result, RVF outbreaks have occurred following exceptional rainfalls within Africa [302, 303] . Rabies virus and MPXV, among several other potentially infectious virus diseases, have been reported from humans, animals, and birds within Africa.",

Human-to-human transmission of Ebola virus through exposure to body fluids has been reported, which makes the human population vulnerable to the disease. The introduction of MPXV from wild reservoirs to human populations represents zoonotic transmission and it has been challenging to contain the disease to date. Interestingly, the hunting, butchering, and trading of bushmeat, especially in western and central Africa, including, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, among others, puts the human population at risk in terms of a zoonotic virus disease outbreak. Reports of an avian influenza virus from Egypt in domestic as well as commercial poultry and wild birds further increased the burden of disease in the continent. A report of swine influenza A virus from Kenya along with the finding of the HPAIV H5N1 subtype in a swine population in Nigeria and Egypt indicated the possibility of the transmission of influenza from wild birds to commercial pigs. Avian influenza was first reported in terns in South Africa in 1961. More recently, the highly pathogenic subtype of avian influenza was reported from an ostrich farm in the Western Cape province in South Africa. Interestingly, ASFV, which was reported to trigger hemorrhagic fever among the swine population, was reported in a commercial piggery in South Africa in 2013.",

            "text": "Overall, cultural practices, poor resources, illiteracy, lack of information and awareness, and limited or lack of active surveillance of vector-borne and zoonotic viral diseases would be considered the most probable factors behind the high burden of viral diseases in the African continent. Therefore, the findings of this study recommend that appropriate action plans must be urgently taken to increase awareness through extensive concerted and interdisciplinary efforts, and adequate education must be imparted in the context of possible virus disease outbreaks to stakeholders within such communities that may be prone to the acquisition of virus infections by different means. The launch of initiatives, such as 'One Health', for active virus disease surveillance at the interface of animals, humans, and the ecosystem is critical to devise and implement strategies to prevent or control the transmission and circulation of vector-borne and zoonotic virus diseases in Africa.",
