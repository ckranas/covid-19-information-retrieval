Pour, Liu (3, Schmied B UNMC/Eppley Cancer Center, Univ.ofNebraska Med. Center, Omaha, NE Introduction. Observations in the hamster panctentic cancer model and in patients with pancreatic cancer have indicated a relationship between cancer and the endocrine pana'ena. We have performed studies to clarify this issue. MethedL Syrian Golden hamsters treated with BOP, transplanted hamster pama, eatic islets, cultumt human end hemster islets, and surgical or autopsy m~'rial from l~tic cancer patients were used. Remits. a) Studies in the hamster Ipodel: 1) Most invasive ductal cancers developed within islets. 2) Over 90% of induced ductal cancers contained endocrine cells. 3) Dem-uctioa of pancreatic 13 celis with stmptozotocin or alloxaa inhibited pancren~ cascinogenasis. 4) Genetically diabetic hamster strain with atrophic islets was resistant to pancreatic carcinogenic effect of BOP; whereas, the genetically non-diabetic strain with intact islets was not. 5) Induction of nesidioblastosis significantly enhanced the incidence and numtans of pancreatic cancer. 6) BOP induced tumor in the submandibular glands where homologous islets were transplanted but not in those without islet transphmtation. 7) Treatment of isolated hamster islets in culture with BOP led to the development of malignant cells with invasive potential in vivo whan transplanted into the subcutaneous tissue, pancreas or submandibular gland of recipient hornet's. 8) Hamsters with cancer show serum hormone abnormalities. Studies in humerus: 1) As in hamsters, malignant glandular structures were found in the pancreas of patients with or without pancreatic cancer. 2) Over 90% of pancreatic cancer contained variety of pancreatic endocrine cells. 3) No cancers have ever been recorded in type I diabetic patients. 4) Treatment of isolated human islets in culture with BOP causes malignant transformation. 5) Pancreatic cancer patients show hormonal abnormalities similar to that found in hamsters. Conclusion. C'ertah populations of pancreatic islets (most probably the stem cells) present cancer progenitor cells. Pancreatic carcinogenesis involves both the exocrine and endocrine pancreas.",

            "text": "Introduction: Long-term survwal of surglcally treated patients with pancreatic invasive ductal cancer(pancreauc ductal cancer) has remained low, and five-year survwal rate has been lower than 10% Micmscop=c curative resectmn is o~en very difficult to achieve in most of the pancreatic cancers, because of widely-spread lymph node metastases, defimte retropentoneel invasion and wide spread of cancer cell invasion through the nerve plexus Clinical staging with imaging techniques is still difficult owing to the very invasive and hematologicaliy me~tstatic characteristics of this cancer, h is, thus, difScuh to preoperative or inn'aopemtive estimate of the extent of the curability by surgery. For these reasons we have rather routinely performed a so-called extended resection of pancreatic ductal cancer, which includes 1) dissection of a part of the lymph nodes along the abdominal aorta with group 2-lymph nodes, 2} cleaning of nerve plexus along the common hepatic artery (or splenic artery), the cdiac axis, and a part of the superior mesenteric artery with pancreat,c head plexus I and 11, 3) resect,on of a part of the celiac ganglions, and 4) PW(-) resection. Patients and Results: We have performed macroscopicaIIy curative resection of the invasive ductal pancreatic cancer in 141 patients (median age: 63, head cancers\" I I3, body and tail cancers: 28, stage I: 6, stage I1: 4, stage 111.28, stage IVa. 67, stage IVb 26). Following results were obtained; I) The R0 resection is essentmlly necessary for long-term survival. 2) Comprehensive stage, curability and irradiation are clearly independentprognnsuc factors (Cox's proportional hazards model) 3) Patients w~thout lymph node metastases showed a s~gnificantly better survwal curve than those wxth node metastasis; however, those with lymph node metastasis have also been alive more than three years 4) The ,nc:dence of plexus invas=on increased w=th the s=ze and the extensmn of the cancer, and plexus mvaslon was observed m 20 % of the smallcancer of less than 2 cm in diameter 5) Patients who underwent intranperative irradianon after the resect=on showed higher survival rate than those with surgeD' alone 6) Postoperat=ve regional chemotherapy with continuous 5-FU infuslon decreased the hepatic metastasis w=thm 6 months 7) For improvement of the postoperative nmrmonal state, preserving the whole stomach (PpPD) seems to be useful Conclusions: These findings, presumably, suggest that the local recurrence of pancreet=c cancer might possibly be controlled by the extended resecuon and the mtraoperative Jrradiauon, and the early development of hepatic metastases might be controlled w~th regional chemod~erapy We will present a vsdeo of our method of resection and reconstrucuon forthe p~mcreanc mvasive cancer Since 1980 extended surgery has been used to n-ant panc~adc cancer in many institution in Japan in the hope of cumuve resection and good outcome. The resection ram increased, but the final outcome was unsatisfactory, and instead the question of postoperative quality of life (QOL) following exmnded surgery has become a burning issue. During the past 22-year period (1976.10 -1997.5 ) 168 of the 187 padenm with invasive pancreatic ductal carcinoma were treated surgically at Mie University Hospital Them were 3 groups of panents: an early period group (1976.10 -1981.4, n=34) , a middle period group (1981.5 -1993.3, n=lO0) , and a late period ~oup (1993.4 -1997.5, n=34) . The standard operation (pancreatoduodcnectomy with DI lymph node dissection) was performed in the early period, extended operations (pancreatodundenectomy with D2 ~ymph node dissection) were performed in the middle penod, and a modified standard operation (pancreatoduodenectomy with DI lymph node+a dissection) was performed m the late period. DI dissection is similar to dissection up to the NI level m the UICC classifination. \"D2 dissection\" means dissection of lymph nodes up to the para-anrtic mglon. Our \"modified standard method\" means dissecuon of the anterior pancreattcoduodenal (APDL posterior pancreaucoduodenal (PPD), pyloric (PY), hepatoduodenal ligament (HDL), common hepanc artery (CH), rr-ddle colic vessel (MC) lymph nodes and half of the sopermr mesenteric (SM) lymph nodes. Thus, the lymph node dissection level m the modified standard procedure is between the level in the standard and extended procedure, but the pancreatoduodenectomy LS the same as usual. We consider the previous standard operauon to be a less curative rcsecuon procedure, and the extended operauon to be curative resection, hot a high-stress operauon. Accordingly, we have modified the surgical procedure (modified standard operauon) m our recent cases out of constderauon for the panents QOL.",

Both Iocoregtonal recurrence and hepatic meta-stasis are major causes of cancer death after resection of adenocarcmoma of the pancreas. Thus, in resection of pancreatic head cancer, we have performed a wide range of lymphatic and connective tissue clearance plus postoperative liver perfusion chemotherapy (LPC). Operative procedure and postoperative LPC(Vidao):During operation, the major vessels such as the superior mesenteric artery, celiac truncus, aorta are skaletonized to clearly remove the surrounding connective tissues and lymph nodes (Extended pancreatectomy). The portal vein, if cancer invasion is suspected, is also resected together with the pancreatic head w=thout performing the 'tunneling\" procedure. Each one catheter is placed in the hepatic artery and one of the vein in the mesenterium. Postoperatively, 125 mg/day of 5-fluorouracil is infused via each of the two routes continuously for 4 weeks (LPC). Result,= The 5-year surv=val rate in our extendetl pancreatectomy plus LPC was 41% wtl~ch was slgmficantty h=gher than 24% of extended pancreatectomy alone or 8% of the conventional pancreatectomy alone.

The aim of the present study was to assess a therspeutlc effect of IS-741 on a lethal model of acute pancreatitis in dogs, focusing on cPLA2. Materials and Methods. Adult mongrel dogs were endotracheally intobated under intravenous anesthesia and maintained on spontaneously breathed room mr. During infusion of lactated Ringer's solution at a rate of l0 ml/kg/hour, acute pancreatztis was induced by electing autologous gallbladder bile into the mare pancreauc duct. The dogs were then divided into two groups: Group A (non-treatment), no treatment during the experiment, and Group B (IS-741), mtravenously injected with IS-741 at 6 and 30 hours after eduction of acute pancreatius. PLA2 acuvtty in venous tissues were measured by separating the samples into high molecular fractions for cPLA2 and low molecular fracuons for secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) on a Sephadex column. Results. The survival rate was slgnificandy higher m Group B than in Group A (80% vs. 30% at 36 hours). Mean arterial pressure, PaOL and creanmne clearance were well maintamed m Group B as compared with Group A. The NAG index, which is known to be markedly increased in renal tubular damage, was s]gmficantly lower in Group B than m Group A. Histologlcad examination of the pancreas, lung, and kidney m Group B showed cmlder changes than in Group A. cPLA: actwlty in the pancreas, lung and renal cortex was much lower in Group B than in Group A, but sPLA: acuvtty in these tissues did not differ s=gmfinantly between the two groups. Conclusion. IS-741 exerts a potentmlly therapeutic effect on experimental acute pancreautlS by nutLgattng the degree of damage in the pancreas, lung, and kidney. The mhib,tory effect of IS-741 on cPLA: may conmbute to one of the anu-inflammatory mechanism of acuons of this agent. Acute pancreatitis ts an inflammatory disease, which varies in severity from mild to severe. Factors determ=ning the severity of pancreatitis are not known. It is generally believed that the earliest events in the evolution of acute panczeatitis lead to premature intra-acinar cell activation of digestive zymogens and that those enzymes, once activated cause acinar cell injury. Recent studies have suggested that the ultimate severity of resulting pancreatJtis may be determined by events which occur subsequent to acinar cell injury. These include inflammatory cell recruitment and activation as well as the generation and release of cytokines and other chemical mediators of inflammation.",

The initial treatment is conservative, including intensive care medicine and adequate fluid replacement. The indication for an operative intervention should be based on clinical and bacteriological data. Infection of pancreas necrosis occurs in 30 to 70%. de+pending on the extent of necrosis and is the key indication for the operative management of necrotizing pancreatitis.

The carboxamide derivative I5-741 effectively prevented pancreatitis-aSsociated lung injury following the septic challenge. Severe acute pancreatitis results in significant morbidity and mortality. No specific therapeutic options aside supportive care have been proven to be effective in patients. The development of various animal models of acute pancreatitis (AP) has made it possible to rapidly study new approaches of potentially beneficial medical compounds, The pathogenesis of AP involves the release of lysosomal enzymes which trigger a cascade of events including activation of digestive enzymes ultimately leading to autodigestion. The initiation process of AP potentially includes activation of CCK-A receptors since blockade of these receptors with spec=fic antagomsts decreases the severi~ of injury in the pancreatic tissue, tn the past years, a venery of potent and selective CCK-A receptor antagomsts have been developed. The different antagomsts have been studied ~n different models of AP' prophylacttc admimstration of CCK-A receptor antagomsts prevents the development of inflemmahon induced by cerulem or by cholin-defictent diet ~n rats, mice, and dogs.

Dept. of Medicine, Municipal Hospital, Ldneburg, FRG. Background. Pancreatin mlcrosphere preparations containing 25000 -40000 F.I.P units of lipase are recommended for the vast malorib/ of patients. This will lead normally to clinical improvement and reduction of steatorrhea. However, a number of patients fading to respond present a problem for the physician in charge of their treatment. Practical guide. 1. Increase enzyme dosage by 2 -3 times the initial dosage. If treatment still remains unsuccessful, 2. patient compliance should be checked by asking appropriate questions or by estimating fecal chymotrypsm. If the patient is compliant, 3. the diagnosis should be reevaluated (is it really exocdne pancreatic insufficlencyg), and the doctor make tests for giardiasis, bactenat overgrowth, and blind loop in operated patients. 4. If the patient ;s operated (gastnc section), non-acid protected granule enzyme preparat=ons should be g=ven. If gastroduodenal passage is disturbed (diabetes mellitus etc.) rnicrospheres or non-ac=d protected granule enzyme preparations plus H~-receptor antagonists or proton pump mhlbitors should be given If a seamh result is negative, 5. other intestinal absorption disorders (e.g. celiac disease) should be excluded. If this agmn ~s negative, 6. a last resort is to decrease fat intake to 40 -60 g per day or to add Hz-blockers or proton pump inhibitors to the treatment. Conclusion. Although this stepw=se procedure ts time-consuming, =t Es necessary to prevent in patients not responding to pancreatic enzyme substitution the development of late complications of exocnne pancreatic insufficiency. Background: Enzyme replacement therapy is common in the management of patients with exocrinc pancreatic insufficiency. However, fipase preparation that is acid-stable and has higher lipolylic activity is necessary to correct fat malabsortion due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Furthermore, the ideal treatmant should be based on reliable evaluation of exoerine pancreatic function. The secretin (S') test is the gold-standard test, but BT-PABA test or fecal chymolrypsin test (FCT) is popular in Japan. In the present study, we investigated (I) the diagnostic value of the, so tubeless tests in comparison to the S test. and studied (2) the in vitro and in vivo lipolytle activity of bacterial lipase (BL) that has been recently developed. Methods and Results: (I) The S test and the two tubeless tests were performed in 157 subjects comprising 51 patients with definite chronic pancreatitis (CP) and 27 patients with probable CP. The diagnosis of CP was based on the diagnostic criteria for CP by the Japan Pancreas Society (1995) . In the S test, we analyzed fluid volume, bicarbonate concentration and amylase output of duodenal aspirates for 60 rain. The results of the S test correlated with the morphological changes in pancreatic imaging tests. The values of FCT and BT-PABA test significantly correlated with max. bicarbonate concentration in the S test. The values of these tubeless tests decreased in proportion to the degree of exocrine pancreatic dysfuncnon. Each tubeless test was less sensitive and specific for determining exocrine pancreatic impairment than the S test. However, greater reliability for diagnosing. CP can be obtmned by performing the two tubeless tests simultaneously.",

Major pancreatic resection can result in steatorrhoea which is particularly difficult to control and may require high doses of pancreatm. The a=m of this study was to demonstrate equivalent efficacy of high {Creon| and standard dose (Creon o) pancreatin in treating steatorrhoea post-pancreatectomy. Patients and Methods. 42 patients, post-pancreatectomy, were assessed for a randomised, double-blind, cross-over study. Patients were stabilised on a suitable dose of Creon | during a two week run-in period. Following this they received either Creon| or Creon | at this dosage for two 14 day treatment periods. Criteria used to demonstrate efficacy of treatment were stool fst excretion, stool volume, stool frequency and clinical symptoms. Results. 39 patzents were random=sed and 37 completed the study. During the run-in period 22 (56%) patients had a stool fst excretion of > 7g/day, with a mean capsule intake of 19.4 (range 9-54). There were s~gnificant correlauons between stool fat excretmn and capsule intake (p < 0.02), stool volume (p<0.OO01), stool frequency (p<0.01) but not with clinical symptoms. Seth Creon| and Creon | demonstrated stat=stmally simdar efficacy in the treatment period. Conclusion. The use of Creon| for the treatment o; pancreatic insufficiency following pancreatectomy should significantly reduce capsule intake resulting in improved convenience and compliance rate.

Two pancreauc cancer cell lines, Panc-1 and MIA PaCa-2. were used. Complement levels in supernatants were determined by ELISA. Complement mtLNA expression was evaluated by RT-FCR and Northern blot analysis. Results_ The C3 and factor B synthesis was induced by the addiuon of one of fibrogenic cytokmes, [L-I~, in two cell lines. TNF-a also induced a marked increase in the secretion of C3 and factor B m these cells. On the other hand. the addiuon of TGF-~ potently attenuated the effects of both IL-I~ and TNF-a on C3 and factor B synthesis. These effects were also confirmed at the mRNA levels. The addition of PDGF also down-regulated the IL-I~-and TNF-r factor B synthesis at the protein and mRNA levels.

Recently, it was reported that protease inh~bitors, which stimulate pancreatic exocrine secretion by the release of CCK and secretin, delay the accelerated gastnc emptying and improve postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetes by the release of CCK. Gosya-jinki-gan (T J-107), a herbal medicine, is used for diabetes in Japan and China. In this study, we investigated the effect of TJ-107 on pancreatic exocrine secretion, and the role of CCK and secretin in its stimulative mechanism in rats. Methods. Cannutas were inserted under anesthesia into the biliary and pancreatic duct, duodenum, stomach and jugular vein of male Wistar rats (280-320 g). Bile and pancreatic juice were returned to the duodenum continuously, and on the 3rd day, the following experiments were performed. 1) TJ-107 0.5 and 1.0 g/kg, i.g. 2) Loxiglumids, a CCK receptor antagonist, 50 mg/kg, i.g. 30 m,n before TJ-! 07. 3) In addition to Ioxiglumide, anti rat secretin serum 100 i~l/rst, i.v. 15 mm before TJ-107. Pancreatic juice was collected every 30sin and the volume and protein output were determined. Plasma CCK was measured before, and 30 and 60 sin after TJ-107 admin,strat=on by RIA. Moreover, the effects of TJ-107 (0.005-50 p.g/mg) on trypsm activity was estimated by Hesterine method in vitro. Results. T J-107 stimulated the volume and protem output of pancreatic juice dose-dependently and increased plasma CCK levels. The st=mulatton of pancreatic exocrine secretion by T J-107 was inhtb,ted partly by Ioxiglumide and completely by anti secrets serum combined with Ioxiglumide. TJ-107 did not ,nhibtt trypsm actiwty. Conr T J-107 stimulated the pancreatic exocnne secretion. Its effect is conmdered to have been mediated by the release of CCK and secrets from the duodenum without tnh,b=tion of trypsin activtty. clime of gastroenterology, Insdtut of pathology*, Chnical center Ni.~, YU l[ntroduction. Considering well-known anatomic and physiologic relation-ships between duodenum and pancreas we presumed pathohistologic changes of duodenal mucosa in chronic pancreatitis (CP). Patients and Method. Endoscopic guided duodenal hiopsies were taken from the second and the third portion in 30 patients with CP proved by means of imaging procedures (abdominal plain radiography, ERP, ultrasound and cr) and the measurement of faecal chymotrypsin. Results. Using HE and AB-PAS technique in all cases were found different types of chrome duodenitis: DUODEN1TIS CHR ATROPHICA GR I in I0, DUODENITIS CHR ATROPHICA GR II in 12. DUODEN1TIS CHR ATROPHICA GR Ill in 6, and DUODENTTIS CHR sUPERFICIALIS m 2 cases. PYLORIC METAPLASIA was found in 18 cases. Using specific PAP and non-specific Grimelius and Masson-Hamperl techmque special attention was focused on the changes of gasmn (G-) and cholecystokinm (I-) producing cells. The all of pauents had endocrine cell's abnormalincs in the form of ZYMOGEN HYPOGRANULATION. Decrease in the number of G-and i--cells was found m 28 cases and had correlanon with the degree of chrome atrophic duodemtls. Seven patients had the HYPERTROPH:[O of G-and I-cells. Conclusion. Pauents with CP obvmusly have the pathologic changes of duodenal mucosa which may be consequence of CP but also may have some etxopathogenenc role. DUODEN1TIS CHR ATROPHICA of various degree is the most frequent finding. The changes of mucosal endocrine cells, such as ZYMOGEN HYPOGRANULATION. decrease in the number or the HYPERTROPHIO of G-and I-cells may have some adaptable role m the development of exocrme pancreatm msufficxency.

Theoretically, pefloxacra's spectrum of action and pancreatic penetration should make it a valid altematwe to irazpenera. Patients and Methods: In a raulticentre study, 56 severe acute pancreatitis patients with necrosis affecting at least 50*/0 of the pancreas were randomly allocated to two weeks' ratrvenous treatment with pefloxacin 400 rag b d.(27 patients) or ira,pencra 500 rag tad (29 paneras) within 120 h of onset of symptoms Age Sex, body weight, Ranson and Apache lI scores, C reactive protein, aetzology and tzrae from onset of syraptoras to treatment were well matched ra the two groups Results: The racidences of int'ected necrosis and extrapancreat~c rafectlons were 37% and 48%, respectively, ra the pefloxacra group and 10 3% and 206% in the iraipenera group, im=penera proving stgnificantly more effectwe (p<0 05) The mortality, due in all cases to sepsts, was not sigmficantly different in the two groups, but was lower on traipenera (10 3% vs 18 5% ) Conclusion: Desp=te its theoretzcal potential, pefloxacm xs not a valid alteraatz,,e to ~mzpenem in severe pancreatms UNDERESTIMATING ACUTE PANCREATITIS.

Acute pancreatitis may be accompanied w~th gastrointestinal motor disorders. We tried to study whether gastrointestinal transit was disturbed during acute pancreatitis and to identify which mechanisms might be involved in acute pancreatitis. Patients end Methods, Using non-invasive hydrogen breath test to measure the orocecal tranmt time (OCT'I') represented small intestinal motility, 24 patients (M/F: 21/3, age: mean*-SE, 61.5 + 2.1 yrs) w=th the clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitts were enrolled into this study. All patients received twice OCTT measurements at acute stage and recovery, respectively, Meanwhile, blood was obtained to study the amylase, lipase, Creactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, endothelin-1 and nitrate/nitnte levels. Results. OCTT measured at acute stage was significantly delayed compared with this at recovery (130.0 -* 9.0 vs 80,8 \u2022 7.4 ram, p<0.001). Plasma endothetin-1 levels exhibtted a pos=hve correlation with OCTTs in acute stage (r=0.509, p=0.011). When the recovered levels were taken into consideration, the percentages of altered OCTTs also correlated with the percentages of altered plasma endothelin-1 levels (r=0,751, p<0,001). Plasma nitrate / mtnte levels s~gmficantly decreased at acute stage compared with this at recovery (5.25 -+ 0.82 vs 10.20 \" 1.24 M, p<0.005), whereas the=r levels did not cormtate with OC'l-rs. Conclusion. Intestinal transit ~s delayed cn patients w~th todd to moderate acute pancreatms and symptomat=c recovery is associated w=th normalized motility. Elevated plasma endothelin-1 levels m acute stage of these pattents may be one of mechamsms mediating intestinal dysmotflity.",

The value of serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFu), interleukin-1 beta (IL-113), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukm-8 (IL-8) in predicting the outcome of acute pancreatltis was evaluated. Patients and Methods. In 50 patients with acute pancreatttis, the serum concentrations of TNFcL, IL-I~, IL-6, IL-8 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 after admission. A severe attack was defined as one that was comphcated by (i) local pancreatic complications (necrosis, abscess or pseudocyst); (ii) systemic complications (acute resptratory msuffictency, renal failure, heart fadure, septicemia); or (iii) death. Results. Serum concentrations of IL-I~, IL-6, IL-8 and CRP on days 1 to 7 were significantly htgher in pattents with severe pancreatms than in patients with mild pancreatms. Patients w=th severe attacks had significantly elevated serum TNFcL concentrations on days 1 to 3 compared with those w(th mild attacks, but not on days 4 and 7. The median peak value of TNFr IL-1 [(3, IL-6 and IL-8 was reached on day 1, in contrast to the median peak of CRP, which was reached on day 2. Using cutoff levels of 12 pg/mL for TNFr 1 pg/mL for tL-I~, 400 pg/mL for IL-6, 100 pg/mL for IL-8 and 12 mg/dL for CRP, the accuracy rates for detecting severe pancrea(ms were 72%, 82%, 88%, 74% and 80%, respectively on day 1 and 78%, 74%, 80%, 76% and 80%, respectwely on day 2.

Power spectral analysis of systemic arterial blood pressure (SAP) signals was used to evaluate the ANS funcuons Materials and Methods, Acute pancreatitis was induced by intravenous infusion of caerulein (15 p,g/kg/hr) in male Sprague-Dawley rats (200--250 gin). Endotoxemic shock was induced by intravenous infusion of lipopolyssacharide (Ecoli: 0111 94, 15 mg/kg/hr) Control animals received the same volume of normal saline. The nght femoral artery was cannulated to measure SAP and subsequently its spectrum continuously. A laser doppler flowmetry (LDF) probe was attached on the pancreattc surface to measure the relative changes of capillary blood flow Results. The activity of low and very low frequency (LF and VLF) components of SAP spectra decreased concomitantly m the early stage (1-2 Iv after caerulein or lipopolyssacharide infusion) which associated with decrease ofgBF in the pancreas The activaty of high and moderate frequency (HF-MF) increased However, in both experimental condit,ons, total autonormc activity (VLF-LF-MF~-HT) increased with parasympathetic deteriorauon (LF-VLF/VLF*LF+MT-HT) Conclusions.

Significant correladens between the systemic concentrations of ;,R~rrrmatory mediators and severity of acute pancreatkis (AP) were demonstrated. In a prospective clinical study, we have evaluated the concentrations of i~flammatory mediators in peripancreafic fluid (PF) and their relation to the developement of systemic complications of AP. Patients and methods. 19 patients (pat.) with necrotizing AP were included. The medians of R~nson and APACHE H scores were 6 (0-10) and 13 (4-22) points, respectively. Pancreatic necrosis was proeved infected in 9 pat.(47.36%). A~ites and (PF) were collected through fine-needle aspiration or intraoperatively. We measured Endotoxin (etox), using LAL-Test; Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a) and interleukin-6 (IL6), u~ng an ELISA-tecfiniqun. Results. 1-The local concentrations of above parameters did not correlate with Ranson and APACHE 1]\" scores on the first 48 hours. 2-Only etox in PF could s~g~ificantly differentiate between pat. with CT finding of pancreatic necrosis <30% of pancreatic paranchyma (7 pat., Median =0 16 EU/ml) and pat. with pancreatic necrosis >50% (5 pat., Median= 1.5 EU/ml) (P=0.02). 3-Etox in PF was signiflcandy higher in pat. who died. (I 1 Pat.. Median=l.5 v. 0.11 EU/ml, P=0 006). 4-local values of above mediators could act significantly differentiate between pat. who complicated with renal (7 pat.), or pulmonary, insufficiency (17 pat.), sepsis (10 pat.) and sepsis like syndrome (7 pat.) and pat. without these complications. 5-No significant differences of concemrations of above mediators between pat. v,ath sterile and infected necrosis. 6-Etox-and IL-6-values locally were significantly higher than their values in plasma measured on the same time [Median Etox (EU/ml): PF=I.5, Plasma=O. 12, P=0 009, Median IL-6 (p~ml). PF=2788, Plasma=446. P=O.O005)]. No significant difference for TNF-a. Conclusion. The concentration~adients of the measured parameter between plasma and PF show that the retropedtoaeum represents an ellectwe barfer, in that AP compartimenulized. The course of AP will be mainly, determined with the s'ystemtc reacraon, that does not cerrelate with the locol event. Introduction Acute pancreatitis =s caused by autodigesUon of pancreatic tissue induced by activated proteolytic enzyme, whose pathogenesis is not still completely understood. Recent evidence suggests that oxygen free radicals play an important role in pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. In thin expenments, we evaluated the role of oxygen radicals and the effect of small molecular weight ant~oxidants (rebamipide. N-acetyl-cysteme, allopurinol, I}-carotene) m the development of cerulem-mduced acute pancratitis. Methods The male rats weighting 180-200g were diwded into six groups: Group I; iv infusion of a physiological saline for 3 5 hours; Group II; iv infusion of cerulem(lOl~g/kg/hr) for 3.5 hours; Group III, IV, V, VI were treated with rebamip=de(100mg/kg, ip), N.acetyl-cysteme(2OOmglkg,~v), allopunnol(2Omglkglhr, concomitant with cerulem), and !3-carotene (50mg/kg, ip), respectively. At the end of expenment, blood and pancreas were taken. Amylase actiwty in serum was assayed and pancreatic weight was measured.",

The activity of both forms of MAPK, p~2map k and p44mapk was determined in isolated rat pancreatm actnar cells by means of Western-blotting, with the use of highly specific antibody which recognizes active, dually phosphorylated MAPK. Acini were stimulated with different concentrations of ROS ~onors -hydrogen peroxide (H202), menadione (MND) or irradiated wtth UV-light. Results. Incubation of acint with H202 rapidly and dose<lependently activated both forms of MAPK. Within 5 rain tt induced 8-fold increase of p42map k activity. At 30 rain p42map k activity reached a max=mum (12-fold increase), remained at a similar level until 60 mtn, and then signtficently declined. At 120 mtn it was only slightly elevated (2-fold) above the control. Incubation of actor with superox=de donor -MND also induced activation of both forms of MAPK.

On the basis of light-microscopuc reconstruction of pancreatic tissue, Boci<man reported that the ductules and acim were arranged in a complex, branching system of tubules, wh,ch anastomose and end blindly, whereas Takahash~ ctaJmed that there was no anastomosis among the intercalated ducts and acim. However, it is impossible to recognize the three-dimens~onal structure of the mtra-acinar secretory canaliculus and the peripheral intercalated duct by light m~croscopy, since their lumina are less than 1 ,,~ m in diameter. Method. The common hepatic duct of the ratwas ligated proximal to its entry into the pancreas, and the common b~le-pancreatlc duct was also hgated near its junction with the duodenum. A specimen of pancreatic tissue taken one day after ligation was fixed in buffered 10% formaldehyde solution, embedded in styrene, and serial sections 0.5 ,#. m thick were cut and observed by scanning electron microscopy (a new method devised by Naora). The intra-acinar secretory canalicuh and the peripheral intercalated ducts in each section were then reconstructed. Results. In some aclnL two intra-aclnar secretory canaliculi joined a canaliculus, which ended blindly. A few non-branched intercalated ducts interconnected two adjacent intraoaclnar secretory canaliculi. However, all the intra-aclnar secretory canallculi ended blindly close to the basement membrane. Conclusion. The intercalated ducts and the ]ntra-ac~nar secretory r are arranged ~n a complex branching system, but the latter, wh=ch are the most penpheral pancreatic duc;s, end blindly.

In vitro transfection efficiency of s=x kinds of cationic liposome and that of a Fusogemc liposome. which is a hybrid vector made from liposome and inactivated Sendal Virus. were examined. Purified expression ptasm=d that consists of LacZ gone driven by an actin promoter or a CEA promoter were used as a reporter gene. LacZ plasmlds were incorporated into the fusogenic liposome and the resulting complexes were purified using glucose gradient. Two CEA pos,tive human pancreatic cancer cell lines.

As we have recently shown cyclin DI is overexpressed in human pancreatic carcinoma cells and this overexpression correlates significantly with poor prognosis (p < 0.01). Recent reportes linked rmtogenic signalling to the act'vation ofras which integrates growth factor signaling to the induction of cyclin DI. We assessed the role of EGF, EGF-R and cyclin DI in pancreatic carcinoma tissues. Immunhistochemically we examined 42 adenocareinoma ~es on the expression of EGF, EGF-R and cyclin DI and could demonstrate an overexpression in the tumour cells in 51%, 54% and 62,.3% respectively, whereas normal human pancreas stained negative for all of the three factors. [merestingly EGF as well as EGF-R expression correlated significandy with the cyclin D1 expression in human pancreatic tumour cells (p < 0.00l and p < 0.05). Cell cycle analysis in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (BxPC 3, AsPC 1) revealed an increase of cells in S/Gl-phase between 18h and 30h after stimulation with 50 ngtml EGF. Cyclin DI mKNA increase after 2h was shown by R.T-PCR corresponding to an increase of cyclin D1 protein with the maximum level at 7,5 h following stimulation which was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Similar results were obtamd with TGF--r By means of BrdU incorporation assays the dose dependent proliferation of the cell lines was confirmed Conclusion. These results demonstrate that cyclin DI overexpression in the turnout cells of pancreatic cacrcinoma tissue is at least m part dependent on the mitognnic effects of EGF or TGF-<x signalling through the EGF receptor In contrast to the EGF and EGF-R expression cyclin DI expression correlates significantly with poor prognosts suggnstmg that beside the sumulatory effects of EGF or TGF-ct, cyclin DI expression is mlluenced by other factors or by actwated ras =tself National Cancer Center Hospital East, Chtba, Japan.

Patients and Results.The prospective study compnses 49 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed non-msectable ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma. There was a significant negative correlation between pain at the time of diagnosis, evaluated with a Visual Analogue Scale. VAS, and survwal: the morn pain the shorter survival. There was also a shorter su~val for those patients with pain ~n the upper right part of the abdomen (p=0.02) or epigasthum (p=0.02) compared to patients without pain them, whereas pain =n the upper left, lower right, and lower left parts of the alxlomen as well as pain in the back or overall gave no prognostic information. The patients not using analgesics at the time of diagnos~s did not live longer than those who took analgesics, and patients on morphine did not live significantly shorter than those without morphine. The type of pain (dull or coUckly) and if the pain was aggravated by certain factors was of no prognostic importance. The regression analysis showed that only the size of the pancreatic tumor (tumors 2 cm or less), the type of pain (dull or colickly), and site of the pain (epgastnum) could explain some (58 %) of the correlation of VAS to survival and pain at diagnosis was an independent factor for survival when compared to stage, s~te, and grade of differentiation of the tumor, gender and age. Conclusion. The measurement of intensity and extension of pain expanenced at the ttme of diagnosis by the patient w~th an unresectable exocrine pancreatic cancer can be used for prognostic purposes.

The exaCt immune mechanisms undedying alcoholic chronic pancraatitis (ACP) remain a subject of discussion. Recent data provide evidence, that TNF-a is involved in the pathoganas~s of severe alcoholic acute pancraatitis (AAP). Specific receptors regulate the biological effects of TNF-r To define the role of cytokines we analyzed the gene expression of TNF-a and TNF-a receptors (TNFR) in isolated pedpheral blood mononuctear cells (PBMC) of patients with ACP. Patients end Methods. mRNA synthesis of TNF-a, TNFR-p55 / -p75, IFN--f, ~L-10 and \"~ndL~cible nitric oxide synlhetase (iNOS~ was determined by RT-PCR in PBMC of patients with chrome alcoholic pancreatitis. The sevedty of pancraatitis was evaluated according to the CT seventy index (Balthazar sconng system: CTSI=I-3 n = 10; CTSI=0 n = 8); calcifications were demonstrated in 11/18 patients. 8 healthy individuals (HC) served as controls. Results. A strong upregulation of TNF-a, TNFR-p55 and -p75 specific mRNA was found m patients with ACP compared to controls (p<0.01). 6/10 patients w~h AAP (CTSI 1-3) and 448 patients with CTSI=0 demonstrated an enhanced expression of the mRNA synthes=s of IFN-y (p=0.02). In contrast, the expression of IL-10 was not enhanced in advanced ACP; =NOS was not detectable. Conclusion. The marked expressmn of TNF-m TNFR-p55 and -p75 )n PBMC suggests, that ACP provokes a systemic enhancement of inflammatory mediators. Introduction. We have demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that in animal models of spontaneously developing chronic pancreatRls (WBN/Kob rat, stroke prone spontaneously hypertensive rat, OLETF rat), tortuous ductal channels or helical deformities of ~e pancreatic ductal lumlna occur, and that tl~etr inner surfaces have long c~Ua and crater-like depressions. These changes are thought to be caused by ~ncreased pancreatic duct pressure. Method. The common hepatic duCt of the rat was ligated proximal to )ts entry into the pancreas, and the common bale-pancreatic duct was also hgated near its junction with the duodenum. Using SEM, we then observed the tuner surfaces of )nterlobular ducts =n convenUonaUy fixed pancreatic tissue 1,2, 3, or 5 days after ~igat~on, and corrosion casts of the pancreatic ducts 2 days after ligation. Results. In the rats without ligat)on, the ductal lumma were cylindncal and their smooth tnner surfaces had short c;I)a. At 1 day after ligatlon, the inner surfaces had long cilia and crater-hke depressions, and at 2 days, tortuous ductal channels or helical deformities were ewdent. In some ~nterlobular ducts, each eptthelial cell had a bulging ap,cal surface w~th a long odium at 2 or 3 days a~er ligat]on, and at 5 days, their tuner surfaces had long ctlia and large crater-like depressions but no epithelial cells w,th bulging ap)cal surfaces. Conclusion. The increase of pancreattc duct pressure causes the pancreat)c ductal lumen to become tortuous or hellcat, and the inner surface to have long c~lia and crater-hke depressions. Pancreabc duct ceils w~th a bulging aptcal surface are present temporanly at the early stage of increasing pancreatic duct pressure. Introduction: Mucin producing pancreatic tumor (MPPT) is increasingly rceogntzed in clinical entaty and attention has been focused because of its unique morphology.

We investigated whether ~rc-chemomcdc peptide that binds to high affinity receptors on white blood cell membranes can determine the level of leukocyte accumulation in the pancreas and the lungs during acute experimental pancreatitis. Methods: Pancreatitis of graded severity was induced in rats with intravenous cen~tein (5~g/kg/h, mild edematous pancreatitis) and a combination of cemlem and comrolled intraductal infusion of glycodeoxycholic acid (GDOC [0retool/L, necrotizing pancreatitis) Saline was infused in controls. At 3 hours of infiJsion, Z~Tc-chemotactic peptide ('~'Tc-For-MLFK-H'YNIC) was injected intravenously At 6 hours the pancreas and the lungs were removed and radioactivity was counted In addition, leukocyte accumulation in both tissues was assessed by myeloperoxidase-activity and edema was determined by wet/dry ratio.

Introduction. p27 m*+, known as a tumor suppressor, has a negative regulating role of G1 progression through the ceil cycle. Although abnormalities of p27 ~t, including deletions and mutations, have been rarely detected, a correlation between the expression of p27 m*~ and the degree of malignancy has been reported in many human cancers. However, to date nothing is known of the expression of this protein and its clinicopathologtcal significance in pancreatic carcinoma (PC). The present study is to investigate the status of the expression of p27 ~*~ in human PC and assess the role of altered the expression of p27 mD~ in the development and progression of PC, Materials and Methods. Six human normal pancreas 22 benign pancreatic lesions (18 chronic pancreatitis and 4 cystoadenomas), and 54 pancreatic carc=noma (46 adenocarcinomas, 6 cystoadenocarcinomas, and 2 adenosquamous carcinomas) as well as four PC cell lines were analyzed for the expression of p27 roD' by immunohistochemistry (SABC) using a polyclonal antibody (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Lnc.), with a concentration of 10 ~gJml. Results. Normal human pancreas and all except for the two cases of benign tissue showed negative-staining for p27 '~0' protein. Detectable expression of p27 mp~ was found in 13 cases (24.1%) of PC as well as 2 PC cell lines. We observed various staimng of p27 mm existed among different degree of tumor differential=on, even most sampies with p27m*'-negative staimng having very high levels of p27 m~ in welldifferentiated tissues areas compared to negligible or ve~ low tevets of p27 mot in moderately or poorly differentiated areas. Moreover, the lack of the expression of p27'~D'was cons=stently increased with increasing tumor grade (G1 & G2 vs. G3) and climcal stage (I & II vs. 111 & IV), respectively, and each relation had a stattstmally significant difference (p < 0.05), Conclusion. The above results suggest that the absence of the expression of p27 m=~ =n PC ts very common and this alteration may play a role in contributing malignant progress3on of this d,sease.

PD relieves the pancreatic duct obstruction secondary to the periampullary tumor and partly elimmates the neurohormonal control on the exocfine function In this study, analyzing the pancreatic secret'on in the early period after PD is to study the differences m the rec.~ ,cry of pancreatic exocrine function in patients with narr.ox: and dilated pancreatic duct Patients and Method. Four patients with narrow pancreatic duct, less than I 5ram m diameter, N group, and mx patients with dilated duct, larger than 2ram in diameter, D group, under aem PD were studied The volume of pancreatic juice, electrolytes, bicarbonate, LDH, amylase and the total protein were measured in the first 6 weeks after PD One-way ANOVA is performed for evaluating the time-related changes of these factors m the N and D groups of'patmnts Conclusion. A larger volt:.ne of pat~creatic juice, p=0 001, and a higher dady output of amylase, p value is less than 0 05, in N group were found Higher calcium concentration and elevated LDH in D group and a quick :r recovery ofb~carbonate secretion and higher protein secretion m N group were observed [nlroduc~on.

Introduction. Prognosis of pancreatic cancer is one of the poorest among vanous cancers. This is, in part, due to lack of a dignostic tool to detect pancreatic cancer earlier although radiological imaging has made marked progress. We analyzed K-ras mutations in the duodenal juice(DJ) in order to evaluate its usefulness as a diagnostic tool for periampullary cancers. Patients & Methods. One hundred and fifty-one patients admitted to the National Kyusyu Cancer Center were studied These include 33 pancrea'0c cancer, 3 bitiary cancer, 2 ampullary cancer, 7 pancreatic cyst. 77 chronic pancreatitis and 27 other benign disorders. DJ was collected under a 50-rain intravenous infusion of t00U secretin. DNA was extracted from the pellet niter centhfugation of D J. and mutations of the K-ras codon12 were analyzed using ennched I=CR by Bat-N1 digestion (Gastroenterology 110: 221, 1996) . Results. In the patients with pedampullary cancers, mutations were detected in 22(63%) of 35 pancreatic cancer, 2(67%) of 3 biliary cancer and 1(50%) of 2 ampullary cancer. Whereas such mutations were detected only in 8(7.4%) of 111 benign disorders(l(14%) of 7 pancreatic cyst, 5(6.5%) of 77 chronic pancreatitis and 2(7.4%) of 27 other benign disorders). Conclusions. K-ras mutations are identified in non-cancerous lesions of the pancreas, and in the analysis using pancreatic juice(P J), in fact. mutations are detected even in benign pancreatic disorders with relatively high frequency. In the present study, a positive rate for the K-ras mutations is 63% in the periampullary cancers, while it is less than 10% in the benign disorders. Further. collection of DJ is less invasive to patients than that of PJ. These results suggest utility of analysis of the K-ras mutations in DJ to differentiate per)amputlary cancers from benign conditions. ",

Therefore, in this study the therapeutic effect of ONO-5046 on the lung, liver and kidney in addition to the pancreas was examined in severe hemorrhagic paacreatitis in dogs. Materials and Methods. Eleven adult beagle dogs were used for the study. Under general anesthesia, acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced by injection of a mixture of autologous bile and porcine trypsin into the main pancreatic duct. Additionally, lipopolysaccharidr was administered intravenously at 2 hrs after induction of pancreatitis. For one group, continuous i.v. infusion of ONO-5046 (50mg/kg/hr) was started prior to the injection of LPS (ONOgroup). For the other group (control), saline was infused instead. Over a 6-hr period, blood samples were taken from the femoral artery and the blood pressure was monitored. Finally, the pancreas, lungs, kidneys and a lobe of the liver were removed, weighed and used for \"histological examinations. Results. There was a large amount of bloody ascites. WBC count was markedly reduced in response to induction of panereatitis, and decreased further by the septic attack in the two groups. Serum levels of amylase and a2-macroglobulin-trypsin complex increased similarly in both groups. Wet weight of the lung was slightly heavier in the controls. Microscopically, the pancreas showed interstitial hemorrhage accompanied by extensive edema in both groups. Mild inflammatory cell infiltration and bile stasis occurred in the liver of the controls. The tung demonstrated mild inflammatory cell infiltration in the two groups. Conclusion. It is presumed that severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis can not be alleviated by administration of an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase alone. though it tended to lessen the damage of remote organs such as the liver and lung.",

The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-13) family consis~ of a large group of potypeptides that includes ] mammalian TGF-13 isoforms, ac~vim, inhibira and borne mor?hogene~e proteins (BMPs). These polvpeptides play an important regulatory, role in tassue growth and development. TGF-13s are known to be overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer and this overexpression has been correlated with enhanced tumor aggressiveness. It is not known, however, whether other members of this supeffamily also contributes to disease progression in this disorder. Therefore. in the present study, we characterized the expression of BMP-2 in pancreatic cancer cell lines and tissue samples, and correlated the presence of BMP-2 in the cancer cells with patient survival. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of a single 3kb BMP-2 manscdpt in all five tested pancreatic cancer cell lines. Furthermore. BMP-2 enhanced the growth of two cell lines (CAPAN-I and ASPC-t), inhibited the growth of one cell line and was without effect in the other two cell lines (PANC-I. T3M4). Densatometric analysts of Northern blots using RNA samples from 24 cancers and lg normal pancreattc tissue samples revealed a I0fold mcrease (p<0.0Ol) in the 3 kb BMP-2 transcnpt an the pancreatic cancers in comparison to normal controls. The mean survwal of patients whose pancreatic cancers expressed BMP-2 m the cancer cells was 10 months. In contrast, the mean survival of patientS whose pancreanc cancer cells were negative for BMP-2 ammunoreacttvtty was 16 months. These findings indicate that BIvIP-2 ts overexpressed m human pancreatic cancer, that BMP-2 has the capacgy to modulate pancreauc cancer cell growth, and that 8MP2 might conmbute to disease aggressiveness an human pancreanc cancer. (Kato, etal Surgery, 1997) . In the present study, we testified whether CaR plays a s=mllar role in human gastnnoma cells. Methods. Human gast~moma cells were taken from mechamcally minced gastnnoma t~ssues which were obtained at surgery. Following stud=es were performed. 1) Gastnn secretory dynamtcs in response to the increase +n the concentration of extranellular calcium ([CaZ+]o) from 2 54 to 10 mM were observed m the perifumon system 2) The change of the concentrat=on of cytosohc free calcmm ([CaZ*],) was momtored by fluorometry umng fura-2, when the [CaZ*]o was changed from zero, 2 54, 5 to 10 mM 3) Total RNA was exVacted from frozen human gastnnoma tmsues, and was Sublected to RT-PCR w~th CaR-specific pnmers followed by Southern blot hybndtzatton Results. 1) Htgh [CaZ \u00a7 evoked a drastic increase m gastnn release from gastrmoma cells and the peak secretory rate was 2-fold of the basal level. Introduction. Gastrointestinal neoplasttc t=ssue has been reported to exhtbit mtnnsic autofluorescence that differs from the autofluoreacence of normal tissue when exctted w~th blue or v=olet light. A endoscop=c autofluorescence =magmg system (LIFE-GI system; Xfllilx technology Corp., Canada and Olympus opt=cal Co., Japan) that uses mercury hght for excitation has been newly developed for imaging lesions of dysplama and carcinoma tn the gastrointestinal tract. However, =n pancreatic duct, tt has not been apptied to pancreatic duct. This cs the first report on auto-fluore~nce endoscoptc =magmg system in the pancreat=c duct. Patients and Method. Two cases of pancreas cancer and chromc pancreatttm are presented. After pancreatectomy, we put endoscope (12 Fr,) in the pancreatic duct of resectes pancreas. Then, the =mages were obtained by the LIFE-GI system (exc=tatton. 437 nm). Results. In a pattent of pancreas cancer, the ~mage of cancer les~on ;n pancreatic duct was seen m dark red m com0ans~n w=th light blue of normal lesmon, and we could easdy recogmzed the cancer lesion On the other hand, ~n a patient of chromc pancreatttts, the =mage of stenottc les~on m pancreatic duct was seen m light blue, and we could not recogmze the d=fferent color between stenottc lesion and normal lesion. Conclusion. In prev=ous studies on the gastrointestinal tract and bronchial tree, cancer les~ons appeared dark red when examined by the LIFE-GI system. In pancreatic duct. the cancer temon was detected =n dark red =mages, too In near future, autofluorescence gancreatoscopy mtght become useful examination for the detection of cancer lesion of pancreat=c duct. The obstruction of the pancreatic duct causes atrophy of pancreatic acini through apoptosis in rats. This study investigated the effect of OI on this change. Methods. Three kinds of total pancreatic duct obstruction models were made in male Wister rats; Group A: The duodenal cod of the bilcpancreatic duct (BPD) was ligated, Group B: In addition to group A, BPD was llgatcd at the hepatic hilus, Group C: In addition to group B, bile was drained into the duodenum (without O J) and Group D: Sham operated. Rats were sacrificed on day 1, 2, 3, and 5 after the treatment. Body weight., diameter of the BPD. pancreas weight, dry/wet ratio of the pancreas, serum amylase and serum total bilirubin were measured. Result. Total hiiirubin were higher in group A and B than group C and D throughout the study. Pancreatic wet weight/body weight increased in group A, B, and C until day 2. Then, in group B and C, it decreased to be lower than group D on day 5, whereas it did not decrease in group A. The dry/wet ratio decreased in group A, B and C. Serum amyla.~ increa~d on day 1 in group A, B and C and, then decreased. On day 5, it was still elevated m group Athan group C and D. BPD diameter continuously increased though the study in group A, B and C. However, on day 5, BPD waS less dilated in group C than group A and B. Histological findings revealed that fibrosis around the interlobalar ducts developed in group A and B but not in group C and D.Tablr shows the results on day 5 (value: mean-+SE. \": p<0.05 vs Group C 7.5---0.6 * 6,2\u2022 4.5+0.4 0.5-+0.], Conclusion. BPD diameter and histological findings suggested that the ~ttraductal pressure was higher in the grroupS with OJ (group A and B). On the other hand. serum amylase suggested that the atrophy (presumably due to apoptusis) of the acim was disturbed by OJ. Therefllre. OJ ~ccms tu inhibit self defense mechanism against pancreatic duct obsttuction. Insulinoma is the most common fimcttonal endocrine tumor of pancreas even though its prevalence is relatively rare. In general, the tumor is a single and has a bemgn nature, so that the potential for surgical cure is very high.Patients and Methods. We retrospecuvely analyzed 50 including our own 14 patients who were diagnosed as insulinoma and underwent operation during a 25 year period from 1973 to 1997 at mutiple centers in Korea. Results. There were 14 men and 36 women in this study .The mean age of the patients was 45 years(17-69years). The most common clinical manifestation was loss of consciousness (86%) and all the patients had symptoms of Whtpple's triad. The mean duration of symptoms before diagnoses was 46months(t month-20years). The minor can be localized in 37 paUents (74%) preoperatively. The accuracy of tumor localization by ultrasonogram.

Patients and Method We examined the function of APD in 58 cases of the pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM). Ex.istence of APD was examined roentgenograpbscaUy. We injected contrast medium containing indigocarmine through the catheter in the main pancreatic duct and examined the excretion of the dye from the minor duodenal papilla endoscopically. Results APD existed in 11 of 26 cases of the congenital choledochal cyst. Patency of APD was detected in 5 of 9 cases examined by dye-injection ERP APD existed in 15 of 30 cases of PBM without biliary dilatation, and APD was patent 4 of 13 cases examined. There was no sign~cant relationship between patency of APD and associated bLl.iary carcinoma, but 5 cases of the congenital choledochal cyst with APD bigger than 2 mm in diameter had no biliary carcinoma..Amylase level of the btle in cases of PBM with patent A.PD was frequently lower than that of cases with nonpatent APD Conclusion It is suggested that in cases of PBM w~th patent APD. the incidence of carcinogenesis of the biliary tract maght be lower, as the reflex of the pancreatic juice to the bile duct might be reduced by the flow of pancreatic juice from the upper dorsal pancreatm duct into the duodenum ~aa the manor duodenal papilla. We reported a new embryologic hypothesis of annular pancreas which can account for the developmental mechanism of three types of arrangement of annular ducts, by reference to Odger's model. In annular pancreas with annular duct opening to Wirsungs duct. the tip of the left ventral bud proximal to the bile duct becomes fixed to the duodenum during atrophy of the left ventral bud. The left bud persists and then forms the annulus during rotation of the duodenum, while the right ventral bud develops into the ventral pancreas. [n annular pancreas with annular duct opening into the major duodenal papilla w~th absence of Wirsungs duct-annular pancreas develops in the same mechanmm as above, but the ventral pancreas ~s hypoplast~c [n annular pancreas with annular duct opening into the common bile duct w~thout commumcation with Wirsung s duct. the tip of the left ventral bud distal to the bile duct adheres to the duodenum and forms the annulus.",

Surgery 2) Patholog~ ) Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan Introduction The human pancreatic duct system, the main pancreatic duct (MPD) and the accessory pancreatic duct (APD), is formed by fusion of the main drainage ducts of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic primordia. Patients and Method APD shows two di~erent patterns in pancreatograms; long and short type. APD of the long type fornls a straight line and joins N~D at the neck of the pancreas. APD of the short type joins MPD near its first inferior branch. Two hundred fifty-five pancreatograms of normal pancreatic head were reviewed. Results We found long inferior branches exceeding 2 cm fzom APD m 74.6% with long type, sign~cantly oftener than 30.2% with the short type. Patoncy of APD of the long D'Pe was 74.5%. sign~cantly ~eater than 36.2% in the short type. Immunohistechem~cally, we found .N[PD between the junction with APD and the neck portion of the autopsy pancreas in the short type lay within the ventral pancreas. characterized by pancreatic polypeptide rich islets. Conclusion The long type represents a persistent main duct of the dorsal primordium. The short type likely m formed by the proximal main duct of the dorsal primordium and its long inferior branch, with the mare duct of the dorsal primordium at the point of connection w~th the main duct of the ventral prunordium being obliterated and replaced by th~s additmnal communication. Introduction. The prognosis after resection for pancreatic cancer remains poor. Even if extended operation was performed, the results have not been shown to be superior to lesser procedure. Therefore, we examined micrometastasis in resected lymph nodes, especially in patients with negative lymph node involvement, to evaluate rationale of extended operation and necessity-of Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT) as adjuvant therapy. Method and Material. Resected lymph nodes in patients with negative lymph node involvement by Hematoxylin Eosin (HE) staining following extended operation combined with IORT were examined by immunohistochemical staining of cytokeratin. Lymph nodes of 132 of the peripancreatic node and 107 of the paraaortic node were examined. Result. Immunoh~stochemtcal cytokeratin staining was positive in 13 nodes of the 132 peripancreatic nodes and in 2 nodes of the 107 paraaort~c nodes. Five of seven patients with negative lymph nodes b v HE examination had micrometastasis in per~pancreatic nodes, and two of the five patients were positive in the paraaoruc nodes. Conclusion. Five patients (71.4%) of seven with negative lymph nodes by HE examination haa m~crometastas~s. Th~s suggests that extended dissection of regmnal lymph nodes and IORT for advanced pancreatic cancer is necessary to control local recurrence, but tts survival resutts ts hmtted for hepatic metastases. Introduction. Three-dimensaonal recognition is essential for the diagnosis and surgical treatment of pancreatic tumor. The clinical usefulness of new 3 dimensional CT,Shaded Volume Rendering(SVR) was evaluated ~n patients with pancreatic diseases. Patients and Methods. 25 patJents w~th pancreatic diseases were enrolled in this study. Helical CT (Xpress/ SX;ToshJba)was used for the collection of 3D data w=th a slice thickness of 3mm, a table movement of 3-5ram, a reconstruction pitch of 1-2ram. Shaded Surface Display(SSD), Maximum Intens=ty Prolect~on(MIP) and were made by 30 Processor of CT(Real-Render ) and utilized high quality 3D W/S(X-tens=on,Tosh=ba). SVR was performed using new 30 W/S. A non-~onJc contrast medium was admJn=stered intravenously (3-5ml/sec, total 120-150 ml). Delay t=me was 20 sec for artanes, 70 sec for the portal veto. Results. Three-d~mens=onal CT made ~t poss=ble to demonstrate clear anatomr relat]onsl~=ps between pancreatic tumor and the portal or splenic ve=ns by intravenous contrast mject~on. SVR was super=or to SSD for delineating vascular and bde clucLs structures, but was inferior to cine MIP image of vessels ~n quality. Conclusion. From these results, =t ~s reasonable to conclude that these devices contributes cons=derably to the =mprovement of the 3D CT image of the pancreatic d=eease Pancreatogram and computed tomogram (CT) has been crucial to make a diagnoszs of the pancreatic carcinomas It ~s well known that irregular stenosJs or Jnterruptlon of the mare pancreatic duct (MPD) and avascular mass are the characteristic findings. However, here we report a T1 mvaslve ductal carcinoma which showed unique findings with pancreatogram and CT arteriography. Pancreatogram demonstrated mdd stenos~s due to a fflhng defect m the MPD, slmdar to mtra-ductal papillary tumor. On the other hand, CT artenography clearly showed an avascular mass surrounded with weaker enhanced area than normal pancreatic parenchyma, although this finding was not detected completely by convenhonal enhanced CT It was proven by hJstoioglc analysis of surgical resected specimen that the ~hng defect was corresponded to the mvaston of carcinoma into the MP0 and not only the avascular mass but also the weaker enhanced area were equwalent to the carcinoma tissue SJnce these finding are not common to the irtvasive ductal carcinoma, further analys~s regardrng the finding of CT artenography and h~stologacal evaluation of small pancreatic cancer en a Fargo-scale study ~s required COLOR DOPPLER IMAGING OF PANCREATIC TUMORS WITH A GALACTOSE-BASED CONTRAST AGENT E Karasawa, A Yamada*, M Tenma, T Hatori, T ImaizumL K Takasakt-, N Hayash='**, M Ohto \"-\"Oept of Radiology, -Dept of Surgery,'-Dept of Internal Medicme, l nstztute of Gastroenterology, Tokyo Women's Medical College,Tokyo,Japan. ~Researoh Center of Charged Particle Therapy,NIRS",

The pancreaUco-Jejunostomy (P-J storey) has been termed the\" Achilles heed of the Whipple operatton\" The incidences of morbidity and mortality following P-J storey depend largely on the entegrtty of the pancreattc anastomosis The numerous reconstructuve techniques dewsed =n attempts to tmprove the safety of the P-J storey have been revtewed recently. Patients and Methods. There were 385 patients who underwent a standard or modified Whipple operal=on for penampullary cancers in seven teach~ng hospitals distributed =n Ta=wan. The anatomosis method for the restdual pancreas and a limb of lelunum are mainly diwded two groups Group I =s endto-end (n=82,21.30%) and Group II ~s end-to-s=de (n=305. 76 70%). Results The mc:dence of leakage from the P-J storey were noted 11 (1341%) and 19 (6.27%) for the group I and II respectively (P,:0.05) Re-operation requcre~l for these comphcatton were found in 2 and 5 patients of group I and II but all fall except two of group II. The total hospital mortahty of group I and II were 5 (6 10%) and 19(6 27%) respectwety (P>0 05). Conclusion. A end-to-s=de, duct-to mucosa =solated Roux loop P-J stomy following pancreat=co<luodenectomy has a lower leak rate than the method of end-to-end Whereas. the post-operaUve hospital mortality was of non-s=gntficant defference",

            "text": "Conclusion. 22-oxa-calc=tnol may provtde a more useful tool for the chemotherapy of pancreat=c cancer than calotnol. In responssve cells, these agents up-regulate p21 and p27 as an early event, which =n turn could block the G1-S trans=uon. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-g and extracellular mamx (ECM) are known to play an important role on the process of wound healing of the pathological diseases. On the other hand, several matrix metalloprotemases (b,,~vlP) are known to degrade ECM. [t is recognized therefore that ussue repair represents a balance between synthesis and degradation of ECM components. The aim of thts study was to elucidate the rote of TGF-131, ECM and MMP in wound healing following argimne-mduced acute pa'ncreatius. METHOD. Acute pancreauus was reduced by mtraperitoneal injectxon of L-arginine (500 mffl00 g body weight) in male Wistar ratS weighing 150-160 g. Ram were killed by decapitation at 24. 36, 48.60, 72 h. and 5 and 7 days after the mjecuon. Expressmus of TGF-rq, fibronecnn, type I, I]I and type IV collagen mR.NA were deternuned by Northern transfer analysis and that of,'VDvlP-I and ,'vLMP-2 mR.NA was examined by RT-PCR. Immunoreactiv~ty of fibronectm m the pancreas was assessed by using monoclonal anubodies against rat fibronecUn. RESULTS. TGF-BI mRNA expression was detectable at 36 h. reached the peak value at 48 h. Type I and [V collagen rnI~NA expression was elevated at 36 h, whereas fibronectm and type if[ collagen m.RNA expression was increased at 48 h. Fibronectm. type [, I'1] and IV collagen reached the peak values at 60 h. Thereafter. expressions of these ECM mRNA gradually decreased, but remained elevated untd 7 days. MMP-2 mRNA was sigmficantly increased at 72 h, and reached the peak value at 5 days. MMP-I mR.NA levels dnd not alter. Marked depusmons of fibronectm were observed in the mterlobular and intralobular space at 72 h. but they disappeared at 7 days. CONCLUSION. The peak value ofTGF-I31 mRNA expressLon was followed bv that of ECM mRNA expressmn, Furthermore, the increased level of .MMP-2 transcrtpt was followed by disappearance of deposmon of fibronectm. These findings suggest that TGF-FIl plays an important role on the prodocuon of ECM and that ECM degrading proteases ts xnvolved m the healing process of acute pancreatltls. Methods. Gene expression of five somatostaun receptor subtypes (sstr-I 5) in eight human pancreaUc cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa-2, Pane-1, PSN-1, FA-6, SUIT-2, BxPc-3, Capan-1, Capan-2) was first exammed, uslng a reverse transcnptase polymerase chum reacuon (RT-PCR) method. The same method was then applied to pancreauc cancer tissues and normal surrounding pancreauc tissues which were surgically msected In ten pauents. Anttpmhferatwe effects of somatostaun and its two analogs were exammed with MTI\"assay for three human pancreatic cancer cell lines and hsstr-2A gene transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Results. All cell lines, human pancreatic cancer and normal surrounding pancreauc tissues expressed mRNAs of more than two sstr subt}pes. Six of eight cell lines expressed sstr-t, 2, and 5, and two cell lines expressed sstr-2 and 5. Seven of ten pancreatic cancer tissues expressed sstr-I and six of ten pancreatic cancer tissues expressed sstr-3, sstr-5 was not detected except one case of pancreatic cancer ussue. Six of seven normal surrandlng pancreatic tissues expressed sstr-I and all cases expressed sstr-3. All cancer cell lines, pancreaUc cancer tissues and normal surrounding pancreatic tissues expressed sstr-2. Somatostatm and ~ two analogs mh,b~ted EGF stimulated pancreauc cancer cell prohfemtlon.

Institute of Digesuve Disease and Nutri6ort, Korea University College of Medicine, Seed. Korea Introduction. Gallstone pancreatius has showed higher mortality and morbidity rate as con-~ to other causes of ~acreadtis, and the lrolxn\" timing of endoscopic retrograde cholan~opancreatograt~y (ERCP} and endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) is still controversial. But recent several trials reveals that early ERCP/EST is safe l:rocedum and can reduce mortality and complication rate in gallstone pancreatitis. Methods. To assess the safew and effectiveness of early ERCP/EST. we perfomed ERCP and EST, if necessary, in 52 cases of acute gallstone pancreadtis dunng recent 4 years. The diagnosis of gallstone pancreauus was based on the typical signs and symvtoms, enzyme elevation, and radiolngical findings. Ranson criteria at adrmssion were used for seventy. Results. Early ERCP group (in 72 hours) were 33 cases and delayed group were 19 cases. Early and delayed FAT group were 22 and 1.7 cases, respectively, No stadsdcaUy sigruficant difference was found bet~veen early and delayed groups in blood chermstry and the sevent3\" of l~ancrearaus according to Ranson cntena. Duedenoscol~c findings show normal ~ptUa m .~ cases, mpdlary edema in 24 cases, and hemorrhagm and lacerated papilla in 8 cases. No remarkable complications according to ERCP or EST were noted. The hospital days of early ERCP'EST group were sigruficantiy shorter than deia.ved group. Conclusmn. This result suggest that early endoscopic procedures on the diagnos~s and treatment were considered as a sa/e and effecnve treatment medality in the gallstone pancreatius. For identify, the t~ssue injury by ox3\"gen free radical (OFR) in e.xtxrtrrental tmncreat/tis, rmastrerent of lipid ix~ro,,ddaaon lmXtmts has been used However. the antio.~dant defence inte.mc~ to form as inL-~ system, daerfore, it rray be maPla'ol:a-iate to rely on measurement of a single corrvonent as an indicator of the funcuoning of the entzre systan Recently, Total Andoxidant Status (TAS) is deveklxd for evaluating the overall lxrfornmce of the antio.,ddant system ~]~is study was to assess whether T-iS is a useful indicator for evaluatin~ the role of OFR as patho~enesis of e.'q:edn-en, M pmx:matitis. Methods. Twenty-one male S-D rat (200-250g B.wt) were used. There were three groups: Ca-oup 1(n=7, control), Group 2 (n=7, ceru]ein), and Group 3(n=7, taurocholate). Each rat received an iv infusion of cerulein(5ug/kg/hr) for 4 hours or intraductal taur~r..holate (5~ 0.1ml/100~ B.wt) injection. After #ancremids was induced, blco:l samoles for b~cher~cai chanses including TAS (P, andox Lab. Ltd, C.n.matin, L,~4J and glutathion pero.,ddase (Gl:'x) were taken. Pancreas was ~ for histology Results. Edematous and necrouza'N pancreatads were induced by cerulean and murocholar~, respeclavely in rat. The b~echerracal changes including TAS and CA:'x were as follows: Background: Serous cystadenoma(SCA) and muclnous cystic neoplasm(MCN) are the most common cyst;c neoplasms of the pancreas. It ~s very imoortant to d~fferenttate between these neoplasms because almost all of SCAs are benign but many of MCNs are malignant. Previously it has been shown that these tumors could be distinguished by racholog~o studies or cytologzc features and tumor markers ~n the cyst fluid. But there are significant rates of ovedaps in thetr findtngs and suffictent eptthetial cells could not be asp~reted to be examined. So other preoberattve confirmative diagnostic test should be develooed to be abte to determine whether the cystic tumors must be resected or not. Aim: The purpose of th~s study ~s to examine whether toucan staining of FNA espectally for background fluid matenal which ~s secreted from tumor cells can differentiate MCN from other cyst;c lesions. Methods: Seventeen FNAs were obtatned from 4 SCAs. 5 MCAs. 1 muo~nous ductal ectas~a. 2 paptllary cystlc tumors, I adenocarclnoma and 4 pseudocysts. Cytologic analysis was performed and muc~carmlne staining was done to see whether toucan ~s contatned ~n the cytoplasm of the cells or tn the background flutd matenal aspirated from the cysts Results: Epithelial cells were ol3served ~n 7(.58%) from 12 cystic tumors.

Pathophisiology of tumor-forming pancreatms, especially non-alcoholic, has not been enough known. In this study, tumor-forming panoreat~tts was climcopathologically investigated. Patients & Method. In 7 patients with non-alcoholic, tumor-forming pancrea'dhs, operated because of difficulty ~n differential diagnosis from pancreatic cancer, clinical features, imaging examinations and pathohistologml findings of the pancreas were retrospectzvely investigated. There were 3 men and 4 women, and the mean age was 56 \u2022 12.5. Pathohistologtcally, the degree of intra-and interlobular fibrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and disappearance of the acinar tissue was examined. Results, 1. They had rarely an abdominal pare, charactenst~o of pancreatltls; only one had a lower abdomtnal pron. Three patients had an immunological abnormality; pnmary sclerosing cholangms, ulcerattve colitis, and Sjogren's syndrome. 2.

Introduction. Combination of heat and various anticancer drugs can have a synergistic antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo, though the mechanism is not clear. We have previously shown that endogenous tumor necrosis factor (enTNF) acts as an intracellular resistance factor to inhibit the cytotoxic effect of heat by scavenging oxygen free radicals via the induction of manganous superoxide dismutasr (MnSOD). Consequentry, we examined whether the suppression of these resistance factors by combining anticancer drugs and heat cause augmentation of heat-mduced cytotoxicity in ancreatic carcinoma cells. ateriais and Methods. (1) The human pancreatic carctnoma cell line. PANC-1, constitutively expresses appreciable amounts of enTNF and also demonstrates heat resistance, was used in this study. (2) Heat sensitivity was mesured by dye-uptake assay and clonogenic assay. (3) The expression of enTNF was measured by a indirect fluorescein antibody method using polyclonal anti-human TNF antibody, and intensity of cell fluorescence was measured by a Fluoroskan II. MnSOD acnvity was assayed by the nitroblue tetrazolium method. (4) Apoptosis was determined by DNA ladder formation using agarose gel electropboresis. Results. (1) After treatment of FPuN'C-1 cells for 15 h wath adnamycin (ADM), the expresston of enTNF was decreased by -!.3%, and MnSOD activtty was suppressed by 55%. (2) The cytotoxic effects by the treatment of PPuNC-I cells with ADM followed by heat were greater than the sum of those observed with the agents administrated individually.

Dept. of Surgery, IT, Himskima University, Hiroshima, Japan Introduction, We previously reported a model of acute alcoholic pancreadtis, however this model did not reach a severe state. We considered that this is because the pancreas in dogs, unlike that in humans, is not fixed to the reu'o~ritoneum. In the present study, we utilizedthe previous dog model but with the pancreas fixed to the retroperitoneum, and investigated the effect of the f~ttion in an experimental model of severe acute alcoholic pancreadtis. Methods. Adult dogs, weighing 9-15 kg, were used. A gastric fistula was prepared, and an 8 Fr tube was inserted into the greater pancreattc duct. Two weeks after the insertion, the duodenum was isolated 5 cm apart from the greater pancreatic duct on the anal side, followed by administration of ethanol (at 2.5 oJkg) into the gastric fistula (Group At.n=6). In a second group. fixation of the pancreas to the retroperitoneum in addition to the same treatrnentas in Group Ar was performed (Group Ar~-F. n=6) . In a third group, fixation of the pancreas to the retroperitoneum only was performed (Group F. n=6). In a control group, only laparotomy was performed (a=6]. Results. Group Ar represents the model that we have already reported and in this group, biochemical and histopathological findings obtained 36 hours after administration of ethanol demonstrated acute alcoholic pancreatitis. although the disease did not become severe. In Group Ar~-F. lethal condition was doted 2,1 hours after administration of ethanol. Accordingly. m all =m'oups mth, s present stud.',', laparotomy was re-performed 24 hours after adrmmstration of ethanol. In Group Ar+F. serum amylase, lipase, elastase [. ALT. LDH. and Cr levels 24 hours after ethanol admimstrauon were higher than before, whereas serum Ca and Po2 levels were lower. In Group Ar+F histopathological examination revealed that hemorrhag,c neerosts and infiltration of inflammatory cells were noted in the pancreas, and m addition.variable damage were noted in the lungs, liver, and kidneys.These findings were not noted in any of the remaining groups.

Introduction : increased mare pancreatic duct (MPD) pressure ~s frequently considered as a mechanism of pain during chromc pancreatltis (CP) e~ther calcifying or obstructwe. Nevertheless, MPD pressure has never been assessed at the end of endoscop=c drainage procedures in painful CP or pancreas diVlsum (PD) as a predictive factor of clinical effectiveness. Patients and method : out of our cases of painful CP or PD treated by endoscopm drainage, 13 patients (10 men, 3 women, mean age=45.1 years, range \" 18-67) wtth good clinical results after a long term follow-up (45 months) were studied manometncally. The major feature was a MPD stncture m all pattents (CP 11 in cases, PD m 2 cases) whtch was cahbrated with a 7F (2 cases) or a 12F (11 cases) stent dunng a mean time of 13.6 months (range 9-31) The pressure was stmultaneously measured m the duodenum (zero level) and tn the MPO thanks to a dual electronic pressure device. The pancreattco-duodenal grad=ent (PDG) represented the difference between pressure =n the MPD and in the duodenum. Results -the mean PDG did not decrease after drainage (16 1 before, 15 2 mm Hg after). The 7 patients who had normal PDG (10.2 before and 5.9 mmHg after) had a complete disappearance of the MPD stenosis. In the 6 remaining patients who had an elevated PDG after drainage (24 7 before, 22 4 mmHg after), the MPD stncture persisted or was unchanged. Sex, age, aetiolcgy, duration of stentmg or followup and stent d~ameter was not different ~n the 2 groups.

The generation of oxygen-derived flee radicals has been implicated in the pathogenesis of experimental pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to determine the role of oxygen-derived free radicals in patients with acute pancreatitis. Patients and Method. The serum levels of lipid peroxide(LPO), myelopero~dase (MPO) and C-reactive protein(CRP) were measured 13 patients with acute pancreatitis and 1.4 healthy volunteers as control subjects. The seventy\" of acute pancreatiris was assessed by Atlanta Classification. Results. The mean age of patients with acute pancreadtis and healthy volunteers were 53.6=15.9 and 32.5=7.6 years. The sex ratio(M:F) of the two groups were 11:2 and 10:4, respectively. The serum levels of LPO. MPO, amylase and CRP were as follows (table) . Conclusion. The senam levels of LPO and MPO were higher m pataents with acute pancreatttts than control group..2maong acute pancreatttts group, these levels were htgher m severe oancreatms than rruld pancreatms but no statistical stgntficance was found. Introduction. Gallstone is the most common cause of acute pancreatitis, but the mechanism of cell death m human and experimental pancreamis remains poorly understood. The experimemal models of pancreatitis induced by duct obstruction are particularly important because they closely resemble the mechanical events that occur during or after gallstone passage Thus, this study was designed to determine the mechanism of cell death in the model of pancreafitis induced by pancreaticubllia~/duct(PBD) ligation in rats. Methods. Thirty five male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups; Group A, sham operated; Group B, PBD obstruction for 1 day; Group C, PBD obstruction for 2 days; Group D, PBD obstruction for 3 days, Group E, PBD obstruction for 5 days: and Group F, PBD obstructron for 7 days. In each rat, we evaluated the biochemical and morphological changes. Biochemical parameters were serum amylase, lipase, AST. ALT, alkaline phosphatase and total bllirubin Morpholo~cal changes were shown by light macroscopy, chromatin condensation and DNA breaks were assessed using Apoptag In Sire Apoptusis detection kit Results. The level of amylase and lipase peaked within 24 hours after PBD obsu'uction, and returned to baseline after 5 days despite persistent obstruction. Acinar cell deletion and prohferattoo of ductal-like cells were prominent after 3 days of PBD obstruction without an acute inflammatory response Complete deletion of acmar cells and severe atrophic changes of pancreas with fibrosis were observed after 7 days ofPBD obstructmn When the TL,'NEL technique was used.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is characterized by low resectabdi~' and poor long-term survival due to distant metastases and locally advanced disease which precludes curauve reseetron, while regional pancreatectomy improves resection rates in a locally advanced lesion. However this procedure has been reported to involve high mortally\" and morbidity without improvement of Iong-term survival. We are going to analyze this procedure comparing with other pancreatectomy and non-resection procedures in patients v, qth pancreas cancer. Patients and Method. From August 1989 to September I997. 162 patients operated on tbr pancreas adenocarcinoma were grouped into non-regional pancreateclomy group(NRP.n=32), regional pancrentectomy ~oup(RP.n=37), and non-resection group{NR,n=93).

Nakajtma. M. Imamura. Department of Surgery and Surgical Basle Science. Kyoto Unwatstty, Kyoto 606-0 I, Japan. Somatostatm. a natural tetradccapeptide, possesses annsecretory and annproliferanve activities on several tumor cell lines. In recent years, many somatostann analogs have been d~veloped as antipre, liferative agents. The amtprohferanve aeneas were reported to be mmnly mediated through the type 2 somatostatm receptors (sstg). The sstP,2 was a major of receptor among sstRs in normal pancreas, whereas it was less exhibited m pancreanc cancer. Th,s fact ts thought to be the reason why the formerly developed somatostatm amdogs exert some side effects before they show thelr anuproliferanve effect on pancreanc cancer. In 1996, however, a novel somatostann analog wlth a umque five-~:s~due ring m'ucture. \"1\"T-232, was reported to have mmor-selectwe antipreliferanve acnv~ty without antisecretory activity (PNAS.

Methods: I. PANC*I. AsPC-I, Capon-2. CFPAC-t and MmPaCa-2 cells were employed. The ceils were plated m 24 multi-well plates. In the exponennal phase of growth m monolayer, the cells were incubated with T'I'-232 and RC-160 for 48h. The cells m monolayer were measured by Coulter-counter to compare the annprohferanve effects among these agents. Furthermore. cell survival fracnon assay was done for TT-232 to deny a simple toxic effect. 2. PANC-I cells affected with 5 gM TT-232 for .tgh were subjected to FITC-TUNEL stummg to detect fragmented DNA. 3.

To evaluate the value and safety of early endoscopic re.grate choiangiopancreatograpby(ERCP). Patients and Methods. 126 patients with acute pancreatitis were randomized to divide into two groups. Six~ six patients with acute pancreantis in the early ERCP group were under-want early ERCP and endoscopic therapy (within 3 -10 days). 60 patients with acute pacreadtis were not treated by surg~ally, r and early ERCP in control group. The disappearance of the abdominal pain, decreese of serum asnylasr level, the mean days and cost of the bospitodzatton and complications were observed in all the patients of two groups. Results. (1) In the early ERCP group, ERCP showed that in 54.5% of ease with biiiary tract disease, 4 cases with pancreatic stones, 4 cases of pancreatic divisum, 4 cases of larger divemcula of around the papilla., and 17 cases of normal (~ 33 cases with biliary tract disease were treated by endoscopy including papdlosphmcterotany, endoscopic nosal bdiary drainage and endoscopm dilatation of the accessory papilla, with no complicatins.

Introduction. Chronic relapsing pancreatitis (CRP) is a common disease of digestive system. The results of the treatment are not always sausfactory. Taking into r significance of the phospholipase A2 at pathogenesis of CRP, we used inhibitors of this enzyme m complex ~eatment of the disease. Patients and Methods. 110 patients suffering from CRP m the exacerbanon stage were observed in our clinic. 30 of them received usual therapy with spasmolytics, cholinolytics, fermental drugs (group D, 50 of the patients received additionally protease inhibitors such as contrycal, ete (group H), 30 other patients apart from the basic therapy received inhibitors of phosphotipase A2 --tetacm-caicium (EDTA) in the dose of 10 ml once a day in the course of 10-15 days (group III). 30 healthy persons were also observed. Results. Stopping of the pain syndrome was more effeettve in the patients received EDTA, than in other groups. In the group III pain syndrome remained the same only m one case (3.3%L para decreased at 21 pattents (70.0%), pain ceased at 8 patients (26.7%). Admintstering tetacin-calcium treatment, authentic improvement of the functional state of pancreas was reached. This results in increase of debit pan of amylase, t~'psin and tipase in duodenal contents and also in increase of index of immune-reacttve insulin in blood. The level of immune-reactive phospholipase -\\2 was increased before treatment in the patients of all groups. Only in the patients of group Ill this index had signtficantiy decreased alter the treatment.

BACKGROUND\" One of the major problems associated with the management of insulinomas is their preoperative localization after the diagnosis has been made. The purpose of th~s study was to analyze the efficacy of preoperative localization of these tumors and the immediate and late results of their surgical treatment. METHODS. Fifty-nine patteots with hyperinsuhnism were studied and the results of the diagnostic tools for tumor preoperative localization were compared with findings at surgical intervention. The influence of the type of surreal procedure on the immediate and late postoperative courses was studied RESULTS Fifty-five of the 59 cases were benign lesions Preoperative diagnosis was possible by US in 28 1% of the cases, by CT imaging in 25%, by combined selective celiac and mesenteric ang~ography in 54 19/o, by EUS in 27 2*,/0 and by assay of portal plasma insulin levels in 94 4% In 54/55 cases (98 2%) the tumors could be identified intraoperatively by palpatlon. By the addition of intraoperative US all les~ons were identified Twenty-nine enucleanons and 32 resections were performed m the 55 patients with bemgn tumors The five patients with malignant lesions were submitted to pancreauc resections There was no mortality m this series External pancreatic fistulas were the most frequent complications and all healed spontaneously Late diabetes developed in three cases at~er distal pancreatic resec,on Long term results were excellent m 98 I% of the bemgn cases Only one of the pat~eots w,h malignant tumors survived more than 5 years CONCLUSIONS It is concluded that preoperatwe localization of msulinomas ~s not absolutely necessary, and by combining peroperatt',e palpation with mtraoperatl~e US. mainly at reoperauons, most of the cases can be adequately dealt ~tth Tumor enucleat~on ~s the best choice tbr treatment of the bemgn les~ons except those assocmted with type I multiple endocnne neoplasia.

As compared to B, either C and D treatments limited the increase of GOT and GPT level (D > C, p<0.05). However, only FUT-175 prevented (p<0.05) the hepatic energy metabolism failure (arterial pyruvate, lactate, pyruvate/ lactate ratio, acetoacetate and acetoacetate/3hydroxybutyrate ratio, tissue ATP, ADP, AMP, Total Adenine Nucleotide and Energy Charge). A timecourse increase of Lysosomal Cathepsin B leakage and my~hocondria MDH leakage was observed in liver tissue of B group (p<0.01 vs control).

Recently the role of cytokines as \"acute phase response\" mediators within the common pathway of inflammatory processes has been suggested. The aim of this study was to make a time-course assessment of some parameters of the cy~okine cascade during AP of different severity. Materials and Methods. In 205 Wistar rats, three models of AP were applied: A) Caerulein-induced (7~g/kg/h for 6h i.v.); B) as A, plus 10mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) i.p. injection 3h afterwards; C) 3% Na-taurocholate injection into the common bile duct. Saline and sham-operation were considered for control of A/B and C group, respectively. Sacrifices were made at i, 3, 6, 9, 12, 48h plus observation until death for extra 25 C-group rats. Samples were withdrawn for: routine chemistry, TNF-O~ IL-6, IL-8, Granulocy~e colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) and endotoxin (Ex). Results. As a whole, peak levels of each cytokine were significantly higher in AP rats ( C > S > A ) than in control (p<0.001). Levels in C group were higher vs A and B groups (p<0.01) and increased later on. TNF-~ and Ex level were negligible and delayed in group A. IL-6 and IL-8 were correlated in S and C group (r:044, p<0.05). However, only IL-8 and G-CSF correlated with the prognosis (days of survival) in Cgroup (p<0.05).Ex, which showed a time-course increase, was related to TNF-~, G-CSF and IL-6 (p<0.05) but only G-C3F significantly correlated with the e~ent of necrosis (p<0.05). Conclusion. These data suggest that the severity of AP is related to an earlier and more sustained increase of some cy~okines.

Half of the stomach was frozen in liquid nitrogen to assay energy metabolism parameters and the onher half for subcellular studies and glutathione assay. Results. Gastric juice pH was unaffected during both treatments. As compared to D, gastric mucosa of B and C groups showed a significant time-course increase of Lysosomal Cathepsin B leakage, mythocondria MDH leakage and TBARs (p<0.01) together with decreased energy charge and glutathione concentration (p<0.05). BN, although unaffecting the overall course of AP, totally prevented the above gastric mucosa metabolic failure (p<0.01 vs B and C groups). Conclusion. These data strengthen previous reports on metabolic GI tract derangement during AP and point out a lipid-peroxidation mechanism as a relevant pathophysiological basis. Such phenomena were prevented by an oral supplementation with a novel natural antioxidant which is not inactlvated by gastric acidity. Introduction. The aim of this study was to assess plasma fatty acid profile in asymptomatic chronic pancreatitis patients (CP) while attempting its correlation with other clinical variables. Patients and Methods. We studied 18 patients with ethanol-induced CP. As control, 15 age-and sexmatched healthy subjects were considered. Patients were not on vitamin-or enzyme-supplements for at least 3 months prior recruitment. Blood was withdrawn for: vitamin A, E, total lipid, Retinol Binding Protein, zinc, prealbumin and plasma fatty acids. Patients were put on a 3-day 80g fat diet end a 24h-stool collection was used for Near Infrared Reflectance Analysis (NIRA) (Esetek, Grottaferrata, Italy). At the entry, calorie intake was not statistically different between the groups, but fat intake was lower in CP (p<0.05). Results. Serum level of vitamin A, Retinol Binding Protein, total lipid and zinc were comparable between the groups. However, praalbumin and vitamin E were significantly lower in CP patients (p<0.o5). Linoleio acid (18:2) and arachidonic acid (20:3) were significantly lower in CP patients (p<0.01). Mild steatorrhea was showed by NIRA assay in CP patients (less than 10g fat/24h). Only linoleic acmd values correlated with vitamin E/total lipid ratio (r: 0.44, p<0.05). The latter parameters showed a significant relationship with MIRA value (r: 0.67, p<0.01). Conclusion. These data suggest that in CP patients with mild insufficiency, in spite of normal routine biohumoral values, subtle plasma fatty acid changes take place. Such abnormalities are paralleled by low vitamin E/total lipid ratio and unrelated to steatorrhea. However, the latter two parameters appear to be somewhat interdipendent. We previuously demonstrated enhanced expression of ICAM-1 in severe acute pancreatitis, suggesting ~e role of activated endo~elium. In this study, we examined effects of ascitic fluids prepared from rats with experimental necrotizing pancreatitis on the (i) cytokine expression, (ii) vascular tone. and (iii) micro~rombus formation in human umbilical veto endothelial cells (HUVEC). Methods. Experimental necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced in male Wistar rats with sodium taurocholate. At 24 h later, the peritoneal exudates were collected, centnfuged and HUVEC were treated w~th the supematants. We examined (i) expression of interteukin (IL)-6, IL-8 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; (ii) induction of mRNA for these cytokines, endothelial isoform of nithc oxide synthase (ecNOS), endothelin-1, platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), tissue factor, thrombomodulin by reverse-transcription PCR or Northern analysis, (iii) activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFr nuclear factor IL-6 (NF-IL6), cyclicAMP responsive element binding protein (CRER) by electrophoretic mobdib/shift assay.

Studies in rats showed that diversion of bale-pancreatic juice (BPJ-D) from the small mtestine strongly stimulated pancreatic enzyme secretion (luminal feedback regulatmn by protease). LCRF, a novel 8136 dalton pept~de punfied from rat intestmal secretion is a putative intralummal regulator of CCK secretion. We have established a RIA for LCRF. We examined whether LCRF secretion was regulated by cholinerg~c regulation or mh=b~ted by sematostatln, a potent inhibitor of CCK release and pancreatic secretion, m consc=ous rats. Methods. Male Wistar rats (300-330g) were prepared w~th cannulae drainmg BPJ separately, and with a duodenal and a right jugular veto cannulae. Rats were placed in restraint cages and expenments were conducted 4 days after the operatmn without anesthesia. After 1.5-h basal collection w~th 8PJ return, BPJ was diverted and NaHCO3 was infused instead (1el/h). The changes ~n pancreatic secretion of flu=d and protein were momtored for 4-~. intravenous mfusr of somatostatin-14 (2 nmol/kg/h) or atropme (100 t~g/kg/h) was started at the begmnmg of 8PJ-0 or 1-h before 8PJ-D The rats were sacnficed before and 2,4-h after 8PJ-D, ancl the plasma CCK was measured by RIA usmg OAL-656 antibody The [ummat content of LCRF =n the small mtestmal lumen (prox=mal 20 cm) was measured by RIA.

The purpose of th=s study was to elucidate tt~e utility of Ibm-section heiicaJ CT for iocal stagmg of pancreatic cancer. Patients and Method. Twenty patients who underwent surgery and pathologically confirmed pancreatic cancer were mcluded in th~s study SUbleCts. These patients prospan~vely underwent dynamic thm-sectmn helical CT (5 mm slice-thickness, 5 me/sac table speed, 2.5 rnrn reconstruction). CT findmgs were mterpretted by three r~dmlog~sts accordmg to the GeneraI Ruies for the Study of Pancreatic Cancer estabhshed by Japan Pancreas Society. ~,e., the s~ze. serosaJ (antenor) and reltopentoneat (postenor) extansmn, artenaJ and po~tal evasion, duodenal eves=on,bale ducts evasion, extrapancreatlC nerve plexus evasion. The accuracy of CT staglng was determmed by the correlation w=th surgical and penological findmgs. Results. Tumors were detected ~n a~ patients on CT. but the s~ze tended to be smaller at CT than at pathology. The accuracy of helical CT was 85% for sero\"~J invasion, 85% for retropantoneaJ extension, 100% for artenal ~nvaslon, 92% for gortat ~nvas~on, 94% for duodenal mvas;on, 88% for bde ducts evasion, 90% for ext~apancraat~c nerve ptexus invasion.

Methods: 31 patients with severe acute pancreatit=s (median APACHE II= 10.5, IQR 9-12) were randomized to receive intravenous Lexipafant or placebo as part of a multicentre study. We measured circulating neutrophil priming and hydrogen peroxide production on admission and at 72 hours following the start of the infusion in 17 of these patients.

Though endoscoptc retrograde cholang.o-pancr~graphy (ERCP) is well-known as one of the useful modal,oes. ~t ts often difficult to diagnose the correct e.,ustence of the ~,st or =ts charactenst:cs due to a lot of mucm and/or a lack of the commumcaaon bet~ een the q.. st and the mmn pancreauc duct in ~'sac tumor of the pancreas. IVlagneac resonance cholang~opancreatos (MRCP) :s being wtdely performed as a noninvasive diagnosUc modal,ty for mvesugaUon of the bdiary a'ee and pancreaac duct system. In the present study, we compared MRCP =mages to ERCP. CT images and hlstologtcal findings m order to clarify the thagnosuc efficacy of MRCP for cysuc tumor of the pancreas. Patients and Methods. Fifteen pat,en~s w~th cysuc tumor of the pancreas, surgically resec~t and h:stologtcally confirmed, were stud~. The.', consisted of 5 ~-].ses of mWaductal papdlary adenocarcinoma, 5 of mhmductal papdlary adenoma. 2 of serous ~smdenoma. 2 of retenaon ~'st associated t~=th invastve duc~ carcinoma, and I of sohd c)suc tumor. All of them v, ere examined by NRRCP, ERCP and CT preoperuUvely at Nanonal Cancer Center Hospital East dunng the period from Februa~\" 1995 to Januat3.\" 1998 MRCP images were compared to ERCP. CT tmages, and l~stolog~c.al findings. The aims of the study were to analyse 1. The spontaneous apoptosLs =n human pancreatzc cancer, 2. Its association wzth the prolderation rate of the turnout, 3. The correlation of apoptotlc index and mzto0c ~ndex wzth the hlstoiogtcal features of the turnout and the outcome of patients. Patients and Methods. 13 surgical spec:mens of ductal adenocarcmoma of pancreas were collected from patients who underwent potentially curative resection. No preoperattve radto-or chemotherapy was performed. In these specimens we determme the apoptotlc cell death by deo~nucleotidyl transferase (TdT) -mediated dUTP-degoxlgenzn nick end lal~elling (TUNEL). The prohferatlve acttvlty was determined by immunohzstochemzstry us;rlg monoclonal an0body MIB-I. Apoptotlc Index (A/ evaluated as a percentage of TUNEL-posltzve cells of 1,000 neoplastic calls) and Mitot~c index (MI, evaluated as a percentage of positively stained nuc!e= /1,000 nuclei counted) were calculated tn each case. Statzstlcal analyszs was performed by means of Pearson's and Fisher's exact test. TUNEL and Ki67 were expressed ,n neoplastic ceils but not ,n normal tzssue of the same speczmen. Results. The AI was 49 0-*-47 9 and MI 12 8-_10 2 (mean:S.D) AI was h,gher in small (<4 cm) than ~n large (>4cm) tumcurs (80 3=56 1 and 20.7\u2022 1 respectzvety)(p<0.02) CytoZog=cal and archztectural grading showed a pos=tzve con'elatzon with AI (p<0 05 and p<0.05 respectively).

Three and four years later in case 2 and 3 resp. the procedure was simplified. An electtoeoagulatory, spli~ng was performed by means ofa papRlotom= \"mthout general ana~hesia. Prior to the operation, the celes were maximally dilated (fig,) by injecting coawast medium through thr natural openings. Then. in case 2. the papdlotome was also inserted through ~ opening ( fig.) . In case 3, the nana'al opening was located atthe lei~: lateral wa.]l of the celt. ~fore, the papdlotomr inserted tl~ough a small medial mc~sion.

Food consumption was matched between the two groups. Rats in the C group were kept sedentary. Rats in the E group were exercised for 60 rain a day (treadmill running final speed, 32 m. mm\"), 5 days a week during the experiment. After 8 weeks, the pancreas and hindlimb muscles were rapidly excised and weighed. Protein and DNA contents and enzymes a~vlties in pancreatic tissue were measured. Pancreatic tissues were prepared for transm=ssJon electron microscopy.",

These results suggested that the chromc exercise causes the increase in pancreatic wesght with hypertrophy of acmar cells. The increase of pancreatic protein content could be due to the increased synthesis and storage of exocnne enzymes. Introduction. The Beger's procedure is an organ-sawng procedure in the treatment of svere chromc pancreatitis. However, there are some problems, when this procedure =s indicated to the patients with low grade malignant cystic tumor.

Surgery, Fulita Health University, Toyoake, Japan. Introduction. The supenority of various metods of reconstruct]on following pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD) is unproven. We believe that the supedonty should be demonstrated for patients wtth similar pancreatic exocrine function Therefore we studied fat absorption after these operat]on using 13C.tnoctanoin breath test. These operations were compared w~th respect to thoctanom absorption for groups of patients classified by their pancreatic fibrosis. Patients and Methods. We used two metods of reconstructions following the PPPD as follows: PG group (30 cases), Pancreatogastrostomy, duodeno-lelunostomy and choledocho-lelunostemy were done ~n order; P J-2 gruop (22 cases), Pancreato-jelunostomy, choledocho-jejunostomy and duodeno-lelunostomy ~n order. The breath test were performed on the pat]ents who could tolerate a normal solid diet 1 to 3 months after operation. The pat]ents =n the gruops were classified by the fibroszs of the pancreatic remnant, wh=ch was presumed the area of by measunng fibrosts of the transectinal wegde of the resected pancreas h~stolog=cally. We classified the fibros=s into three grades according to the degree of the fibrosis as follows: grade 0, < 10% fibrosis, grade 1, 10% to 30%; grade 2, > 30~ Results. There were no significant differences tn the 13 C excretion rates and the cumulat]ve values between the gruops. The 13 C excret]on rates and the cumulat]ve values in the pattents w~th more than 30 % pancreatic fibros=s were lower than those tn the patients with less than 30 % pancreat]c fibros=s, regardless of the metods of reconstruct]on The cumulat]ve value ~n the PG grade 1 subgroup was s~gnffzcantly better than that for the P J-2 grade 1 subgruop. Introduction. Various activities of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) are the result of its interaction with a membrane receptor consisting of an 80 kDa ligand-binding 9 subunit (gp-g0), which triggers the association with a 130 kDa 3 subunit (gp-130), a common signaling component shared with other members of the 1t.,-6 superfamily. Recent clinical puhlicanons have shown high serum levels of IL-6 in patients with surgical intervenuon or cancer-induced cahe.xia; however, functional analysis of IL-6 and its receptor has not been fully elucidated in the level of cancer cells, in this study, we examined the relationship between the expression and activation ofgp-130 and the resistance to r~iarion-induced apoptosis in pancreanc cancer ceil lines, and reed to clari~, the molecular mechanism. Materials and Methods. Four human pancreatic cancer cell lines (CFPAC-I, HPAC, AsPC-I and Mia.PaCa-2) were employed. Levels of IL-6 in condiuoned media were measured by ELISA assay, and phosphorylated gp-130 were detected by immunopreuclpation method (IP\" anti gp-130 pAb, IB: ann p-Tyr mAb).",

A 12-year-old Japanese boy was admitted to our hospital in September 1987 because of dull upper abdominal pain. On admission, a 6 crn t*nder, elastic hard, barely movable mass was palpable in the upper abdomen. Routine blood studies yielded values within the normal range, except for moderate elcvalion of T-bil (2.4 mg/dl), GOT (77 IU/L), GPT (105 IU/L), and ALP (84.9 KA). Serum neuron-specific enolasr CNSE) was devoted to 24 ng/ml (normal range: <10). The serum levels of gastroimr.slinal hormones such as insulin, glucagon, somatostaun, and gasa'in were all within normal Limits. US and a CT scan revealed an encapsulated, cystic mass with a solid component. 6 cm in diameter, located in the head of tlm pancreas, and a dilated gallbladder and intrahcparic bile duct. FI'GBD was performed and cholangiography demonstrated obsamcdon of the common bile duct. Celiac angiography revealed a hypovascular mass. A solid cystic tumor was suspected, and pylorus-prescrving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The resected tumor measured 7.0 \u2022 6.5 X 6.0 cm. and was covered with a fh'm. fibrous capsule. Histological exan'finaaon revealed that the cyst was Lined by pscudopapillary epithelial ceils, and mitoses were ra:t. Immunohistochemical studies showed immtmomaaivity for a a l-antin'ypsin alone, with no cells Ixing reactive for careinoembryonic anugen, insulin, #ucagon. somatostann, or gastrin. We determined the tumor to be a solid cysnc tumor of the pancreas. The patient has been well for ten years since surgery, with no signs of rl~-'ur~fll~. We are studying the influence of site of tumor growth, route of immunization, and ,mmunological tolerance on the induction of immunity to MUC1, a human gtyr C57BV6 mice (w/t) and C57BI/6 transgenir for MUC1 (MUC1-Tg) were challenged with Panc02-MUC1, a syngene,c pancreatm cancer cell line expressing human MUC1, e,ther orthotopically (into the pancreas) or subcutaneously. All wit mice rejected tumor cells injected subcutaneously at a dose of lx10 s cells but 7 out of 10 (70%) did not relect tumors injected orthotopically. MUC1-Tg mice did not re ect tumor cells injected by either route. Sera from wtt mice that rejected Panc02-MUC1 at the orthotop,c s te showed no detectable IgG1 and IgM against MUC1 tandem repeat. Mice ,n which Panc02-MUC1 grew progressively showed s]gn,ficant IgG1 and IgM titers, suggest,ng that a humoral immune response to the MUC1 tandem repeat was ineffective for rejection of Panc02-MUC1 and that tumor rejection was cell-mediated, wit mice were protected against orthotopJc challenge with Panc02-MUC1 by two different procedures : (1) Preimmunization of wit m,ce w,th a low dose of Panc02-MUC1 subcutaneously; or (2) Adoptive transfer of spleen and lymph node cells harvested from mice ,mmunized with Panc02-MUC1 subcutaneously. Th,s demonstrates that ,mmune responses aga,nst MUC1 can be detected and adoptively transferred. These results suggest that the otthotop,c site is more favorable for growth of Panc02-MUC1 than the subcutaneous s,te and that it is more difficult to produce immune responses to tumors grow,rig at th,s site. Nonetheless. Panc02-MUC1 cells grow,rig in the pancreas are accessable to the immune system. We are currently evaluating different =mmun,zahon protocols and the =mmune cell types =nvolved =n this protective response. Introduction. Our previous study suggested that the rapid gastric emptying and impaired gallbladder contraction in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) was due to depleted pancreatic lipase output. We tested whether oral pancreatac enzymes can improve the results. Patient* and Method,. Study subjects comprised 17 healthy controls and 20 patients with CP. We studied gastric emptying time (GET) and gallbladder contraction (GBC) in response to a mixed liquid meal. Thirteen patients had an initial study using a test meal without pancreatic enzymes, followed on separate days by a test meal with pancreatic enzymes (Excelase', Meiji, Seika Corp., Tokyo). Blood samples were taken before and 2 hours ajar the test meal to determine the pancreatic polypeptide (PP) levels.",

Whipple operation is the most common surgical procedure performed as a challenge of cure. However. it has different operative mortality rates depending on the center, surgeon experience, post operatlve cares and so on. Specialized centers seem to have low morbidity. This time. we would like to show our institution data and experience. Patients and Methods: Thirty three patients who underwent duodenopancreatectomy with reconstruction in single loop and duct-tomucosa anastomosis (between pancreatic duct and jejunal loop) were analyzed retrospectively. The surgeries were done between t99t and 1994, in Campmas State Umversi W Hospital. Brazil. Nineteen of the patients were male (57.5%) and 14 were female ~42.5%), with median age of 61 years (range\" 30 to 75 y.o.). Pathologic examination results showed: adenocaremoma of duodenal papilla in 19 patients L57.5%), pancreatic head cancer m 11 patients (33%), adenocarcmoma ofbde duct m two (6%) and non-functiomng endocnne tumor in one case. The reconstruction techmque performed m all cases was jejunal single loop (Whipple modified): 1. hepatmojejunostomy with interrupted ~utures. 2. pancreatic duct and jejunal loop m two layers using *Iaxon 5.0@: tst-Wirsung duct and jejunal mucosa anastomosis in interrupted ,,utures. 2nd-interrupted sutures between jejunal seromuscular layer and the pancreas. 3. gastrojejunostomy in interrupted sutures.

Four-week old male WBN/Kob rats were led wtth a specaal pellet diet (MB-3) for 20 weeks. The rats were sacrificed at 4-week intervals, and the imncreata were removed. The F~ncreanc ussues were Mstopathologtcally examined. PAP mRNA was detected by an RT-PCR method. Semtquan,tauve analysis on the RT-PCR results was performed Using a computer scanning of PAP and beta-actm (internal control) mRNA hands on an agarose gel electrophoresis. The cellular localization of PAP mRNA was anah. zed by in smt h) bndizanon (ISH) using biotin-labeled PAP eDNA probe (777 bp) Chmhu-~uizlu-tang (T J-10) was orallx administered as drug therap}. Camostat mesdate (Fotpan) was used as a control drug. Results. Pathologmal changes of chronic pancreatms xxere first seen in 12-week-old WBN/Kob rats.

Introduction: TO develop diagnostic assays that can identify patients va~h pancreatic cancer early in the come of disease, the use of molecular techniques is a promising new area of investigauon. K-ras mutation in pancreatic juice has been shown to be positive m up to 70% of pancr-atic cancer. However, the usefulness of K-ras mutation in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is questionable due to its high false positive and false negative values. Telomerase is a nbonucleoprotein enzyme necessary for the synthesis of telomeres. In contrast to normal somatic cells, cancer cells are characterized by the aberrant expression of telomerase. We conducted flus study to determine the useffflness of the K-ras mutation and telomerase activity in pancreatic juice for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Patients and Methods: The pure pancreatic juice was examined in 31 patients: 12 with ductal cell carcinoma of the pancreas, I l utah chronic pancreantis, and 8 controls. About 15-20 ml of pancreatic juice wa.i collected dunng ERCP after secretin stimulation. The K-ras gene was amplified by enriched PCR and the mutation at the codon 12 was examined by direct sequencmg Telomerase activity was detected by telomenc repeat amp[ificanon protoco [ (TRAP, Oncor For the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, teiomerase activity in pancreanc juice may serxe as a possible useful tool complementary to the K-ras mutation because it may decrease the false positive rates.",

Hereditary pancreatitis (HP) is an autosomal dominant disorder, and not distinguished from pancreatitis due to other causes with the conventional morphologic or biochemical markers. Since a high risk of pancreatic cancer in HP has been reported, it is important to make predse diagnosis of HP for the prediction of prognosis. However, the diagnosis of HP in Japan by means of family tree study is difficult due to decreasing number of children in this country. Recently Whitcomb st at. reported that a point mutation in trypsinogan gone could cause HP. Their observation opened the way to gone diagnosis of HP. Thus far, two mutations have been cisscribed: a G-to-A transition in exon 3 (R117H) and an A-to-T (N21 I) change in exon 2. The aim of this study is to assess the contribution of trypsinogen gene mutation on juvenile or familial pancreatitis in Japanese patients. Patients and Method. Ganomic DNA was extracted from 24 patients who showed symptoms of the pancreatitis in childhood and/or had affected famdy member(s) and four healthy relatwes in 17 families. R117H mutation was examined by Aft III digestion of PCRamplified DNA #agments and N211 mutation was inspected by directsequancing. ResultS, R117H mutation was found in four families.

Technetium-99m ~lacmsy! human serum albumin (Tc-GSA) is a novel liver scintim'aphic agent. The aim of the present study was to examine whether liver scintigraphy with this agent performed before bfliaD' drainage could predict outcome of bilia~.' drainage in patients with periampullary carcinomas complicating obstructivc jaundice. We also investigated whether this liver scmtim'aphy could predict postoperative liver function in these patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Patients and Methods. Tc-GSA liver scinuEaphy was performed m 13 patients with periampullary carcinomas compficating obstructive jaundice. Each patient underwent standard pancreancoduodenectomy after bfliar,\" drainage. Maximum removal rate of Tc-GSA (GSA-Rmax; standard normal value~-0.60) was calculated using a radiopharmacokinetic five-compartment method. Efficacy of preoperatw,\" biliary drainage was assessed with decrease of serum total bilirubin concentration for the tmtial l week after the biliary, decompression. Postoperative liver function was assessed with increase of serum bilirubin concentration, which was calcaiated by the difference between bilirubin concentration Immediately before surgery and maximum bilirubin concentration after the surgery. Results. Decrease of serum bilirubin !. week after bdiary drainage were hi~er in the GSA-Rmaxz0.60 ~oup than m the GSA-Rmax<0.60 ~oup (8.1 = 1.3 vs. 3.0 --1.3 mg~dbweek, p<0.05).

Introduction. K-ras gene mutations m codon 12 are frequently found in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Detection of these mutatmns have been focused for screening and diagnosis of the disease. The aim of this study ts to examine the potential usefulness of the detection of K-ras gene mutations in plasma DNA from the patients with pancreahc dudal adenocarcmoma. Patients and Method. K-ras gene mutations in codon 12 were exanuned by mutant allele specific amplification method (MASA) in DNAs extracted from surgacal specimen and plasma obtamed from 21 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and four wtth chronic pancreatitrs. Results. K-ras gene mutations m codon 12 were deteded m DNA from 15 of 21 (71%) primary tumors. In nine of 15 (60%) patients with the K-ras gene mutahon posttive tumors, the identtcal K-ras gene mutations were detectable m thetr plasma DNA. Netther of the pahents with chrontc pancreatitts nor healthy volunteers demonstrated the mutated DNA m plasma. Tumors postttve for the K-ras gene mutatmns in plasma DNA were more likely to be large (p<0.05) and chance for palliative treatment (p<0.1) than those negative for K-ras gene mutattons in plasma DNA, while other climcopathologlcal features such as htsto[ogic type, mode of invasion and metastasis dose not correlate with K-ras gene mutation status m plasma DNA. K-ras gene mutattons in plasma DNA were not detectable after treatments m six of nine (67%) patients. Conclusion. K-ras gene mutations can be detectable in ctrculating DNA extracted from the plasmas of the patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcmoma.

The retroperitoneal site of pancreas, his relatively small bulk and his Intimate relation with the neighboring digestive and nondigestive structures confers an extreme difficulty to diagnosis of some masses with this topography. Sometimes the diagnosis is established only peroparafively, even postoperatively, after meticulous dissection of the operative specimen. We present the case of a 38 year old young women who was admitted for palpable epigastric tumor and violent abdominal pains. Echography, scanner, gastroscopy, radiology and laparoscopy could not specify, the origin of the tumor. Only laparntomy and histological examination specified the diagnosis of ectopic antropiloric pancreas. Retrospectively, only the CT could suggest the diagnosis. If the laparoscopy is often named \"the queen\" of the abdominal exploration, the laparotomy is \"'the emperor\". Introduction. Recent studies have evaluated pancreatic exocrine function by using MRCP to monitor changes in duodena/ fluid induced by secretin. However, this method does not provide a quantitative measure of pancreanc exocrine function. We evaluated pancreanc exocrine function by measuring changes in the intensity of pancreatic tissue on ,MR/. Patients and Method. We examined five patients with pancreatic exocrine hypofunction confirmed by PFD test (hylx>-function group) and five normal volunteers as control group. After intravenous injection of 100 units of secreim (Secrepam Eizai), T2 enhanced images of pancreatic tissue v, ere serially taken for 16 minutes. The ratxo of intensity between pancreas tissue and iliopsous muscle was calculated and changes in the intensity ratio v, ere calculated in both groups. Results. In the control group, the intensit2/' muo increased immediately after injection of secretin and reached a peak value at about 5 minutes. Hov, exer. the intensity ratio =m'adually decreased to the baseline value. In contrast, in the hypo-funcUon L..n'oup. two different patterns were obser, ed: I) no changes in the intensiD\" ratio relative to baseline value. 2) the intensity ratio gradually increased hut the peak value ~as delayed compared wlth the control. Conclusion, Our results sbox~ed that the intenslty ratio of pancreas tissue m patients with hypo-fimctlon of pancreanc exocrme secreuon x~as different from that in normal subjects, and suggest that MRI-secretin method ma~ be usefid tbr quamitauve assesment of pancreatic exocrme fianctlon.

In the evolution of the surgical treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP) there were two periods: the old penod when we recommended early surgery and the late period when we do not operate m the first interval and we operate only when septic complicauons occurred. In our retrospective study we try to see if the modem concept is sustained by the results in our cases. Patients and Method. From 1989 to 1995 100 cases of necrotic pancreatitis (NP) were treated in our department. It was 68 male and 32 women. The etiology was biliary in 38 cases, etanolic in 27 cases, metabolic dislipidemic in 12 cases, drugs related in 2 cases and tmknown in 21 cases.

The early surgery, realized the bfliary decompression and drainage and treatment of the etiological bihary factor, the lavagr of the peritoneal cavtty, opening and draining the peripancreatic spaces.

Introduction, The early pancreatic enzyme response to intraduodenal (id.) stimulants is mediated by a vago-vagal cholinergic enteropancreauc reflex (Am J Physiol 1980;238:G23-G29). The aim of the study was to further characterize the cholinergic receptors and to investigate a possible involvement of CCK-A-receptors ha this reflex. Methods. In 6 conscious dogs with gasu-ic and duodenal cannulas, secretin (164 pmobXg/h iv.) was given to provide a flow of pancreatic juice of about 1 drop/sen. Amylase activity was measured ha each drop before and after rapid iv. in lecuon of caerulein (7.4 pmol/kg) or id. injection of L-tryptophan ('I'R.P; 1 retool), Na-Oleate (3 retool), and HC1 (3 retool). The ex'penments were repeated in the presence of the Ml-antagonist telenzepine (81 nmol/kg iv.) and of the CCK-A-amagonist L-364,718 (0.1 mg&g iv.). Latency of response was defined as the time elapsing between injection and increase in amylase activity greater than the mean \u00a7 3SD of prestimulation output. Results. Latency of pancreatic amylase response to TRP and oleate was sig~Jficaztly (p<O.05] shorter than to caeru[eir, and to HCL Teler~z.epme increased the latency to TRP and oleate, but not to HCI.

Single-point mutations m the cationic trypsmogen (CT) gene have been reported ~n Caucasian hereditary pancreatltJs CLIP) kindreds. We studied CT and anionic trypsmogen (AT) gene mutations m Japanese HP kindreds. Methods. All five exons of the CT and AT genes were amplified by PCR and sequenced [n seven Japanese HP famrhes. Results. Two kinds of a smgle-pmnt mutation =n the CT gene, which were ~dentical to those prewously reported ;n Caucas=an HP families, were observed in separate Japanese HP families: 29Asn(AAC):Ile(ATC) in exon 2 and lZ2Arg(CGC):His(CAC) m exon 3. PancreatztlS occurred at more advanced ages =n patmnts wath the N291 mutation than patients wtth the Rt22H mutation. Large talc=fled pancreatic stones were observed Jn patients w~th the N291 mutation, but small stones were observed ~n only one of three patients w=th the R122H mutation.

We have been treating patients with potentially localized pancreas cancers with preoperative RT; this treatment setting could improve ms~,'tability and yet eliminatepatieotswith occuhmetastasis. CA 19-9 is a tumor marker available for estimating active tumor cell burden. We studied usefulness of CA I%9 in this treatment serdng. Patients and Methods. We used 23 pancreascancerpattentswith elevatedCA 1%9, treatedby pmoperativeRT (30--50 Gy) between 1991 and 1997. They were planned to be followed by tumor resectionwhen possible and intraoperative radiotherapy (IOR, 20 Gy) irrespective of resection. CA 1%9 serum levetwas checkedbefore RT, immediately after RT, and thereafter. Recurrenceincludingliver or peritoneal metastasisand local progression was dux'nmnedwith CT scans to study the relationship with changes of CA 19-9. Results. CA 19-9 level before RT, ranged from 64 to 14(X)O U/ml, decreased immediately after RT in 10 patients (Group A), increased in I0 patients(Group B), and remainedstablein 3 patients(Group C). In Group A, 6 patients underwent lapalotomy: IOR alone (4 pts: one showed peritoneal dissenunation), resection+lOR( 1 pt), resection alone ( 1 pt); and ,.t. pataentsdid not: esumated unreseetable(3 pts) and metastasis( 1 pt). In Group B and C, 6 patients underwent lapalotomy: IOR alone (4 pts), resecuon -~OR (1 pt), resection alone( 1 pt); and 7 Paaentsdid not: esumatedunres~ctable(2 pts) and metastasis(5 pts). Metastasisdeveloped by 60 days after the initiation of l~r in these 7 patients. Metastastsdevelopedthereafterm 15 of remaining 16 patients. Imtial recurrence was liver metastasis( 14 pts). pentoncal dissermnation(7 pts) and pleuraldisseminatmn{ I pt).

We invesugated the effects of HGF and combined treatment with TGF a on the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells. Methods Pane-l, COLO 357, T3M4 and ASPC-1 human pancreauc cancer cell lines were used. These cells were plated on a 96 well plate and medmm was changed to serum free medium supplemented with TGF ct or HGF at coneentranons up to 20 ng/ml. Fixed conccnWauon (10 ng/ml) of HOF was combined with different concena-atmns of TGF a. Cell growth was assessed by MTT assay 48 hours after medium change. mlLNA expressmn of c-met, TGF a and epidermal growth factor receptor after treaanem of each cells with TGF a or HGF was examined by Notthem blomng using respecuve eDNA probes. Results TGF ct stimulated the cell growth of all cell lines. The smnulatorv effect of HGF on cell growth was observed m COLO 357, T3M4 ant:[ ASPC-I cells, except for Panc-I cells. Combination treatment wtth 10 n~rnl of HGF and 1 n~ml of TGF 0t enhanced their sumulatory effect compared to HGF alone, however, thin effect was not clearly shown when the concentration of TGF cr was increased to 10 nffml.

Introduction Acute Pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disorder, most commonly caused by gallstones, alcohol and drugs, although up to 30% of cases are idiopathic, Interactions between environment/diet and genotype may affect an individual's predisposition to AP via the alteration of oxygen free radical levels and/or the inappropriate metabolism of xenobiotics. In this study, we have examined four polymorphic xenobiotic metabolismg enzymes, Cytochromes P450 CYPIAI, CYP2D6, CYP2EI, and N-Acetyltransferuse 2 (NAT2) to ~sess their influence on susceptibility to AP Methods.Genomic DNA was extracted from 80 Caucasian AP pa.dents and age/sex matched random unaffected controls Polymerase Chain Reactions were performed using specific oligonuclcotide primers and restriction endonucleases to detect the genetic polymorphisms wuhin the CYPIAI, CYP2D6, CYP2EI and NAT2 genes Results. From the genetic analysts, 100% (20/20) of pauents with alcohol-induced AP were NAT2 slow acetylators, compared with 67 5% (54/80) in the random population (Chi-Squared Test P<0 01) No statistically significant difference in slow acetylator frequency was observed in the gallstone-reduced AP or idiopathic AP when compared wth the random population. No association was observed between the occurrence or aetiology of AP and CYPIAI, CYP2D6 or CYP2E! genettc polymorphisms Conclusions. These results suggest that the NAT\" slow acetylator status may be associated with an increased risk of alcohol-reduced AP. but not gallstone or idiopathic ..L ~ In alcohol-reduced :L a, reduction of CYP2EI catalysed oxidauon and impaired N-Acetylatton of promutagens such as nkrosammes may increase the nsk of pancreatic tissue damage inmba~n rest is now m~,~la_~ad the \"~Id-~,d\" test <~ ~ pmx~a~ ~ In the px'~ent study, we ~ ,,;t,.,,~-,d the ~fic duct diameter (PDD) on ~hy (US) and the ~crine fime~n simuI~n~oualy attzr an ina-avenous boh~/n.iec~n of seera~/n (100 IU).

This has hamlx'red generations of islet stem cells for possible treatment of diabetes mellims. We have been able to culture Syrian hamster islets in a defined medium indefinitely, Material and Methods. Freshly isolated islets from Syrian hamsters were hand-picked and cultm'ed in a M3:6 medium. After roelang for 14 days and removing fibroblaats, islets were hand-picked, placed in culture dishes, and examined at weekly intervals hmologically, inmaunohistochemically, and electron microscopically. llemqts The isolated islets showed typical structures of inlets with no contamination with exoerine cells. Cultured islets floated m the medium during the fimt 14 days and tended to adhere to each other. After 14 days, fine duetulur structures, not seen ha the freshly isolated islets, ap~ared within all islets. At 21 days, the islet cells gradually lost their granules and were replaced by undifferentiated cells of duetular cell morphology. These duetular.like cells formed lumen and typical microvllh and were surrounded by typtcal islet cells intermingled v,ath undifferentaated cells. Smgle or group of cells showing characterisncs of at;nat cells and intermediary cells of aemar..ductular, acinar-I~ cell, or aemar-~ cell appeared between the duetular structures and endocrine cells. After 21 days, the exocnne cells disappeared and were replaced by multdayered ep~thehum that covered the surface of the islets. At 28 days, the epithelial cells gradually migrated into the surrounding area to form a monolayer of monomowluc undifferentaated Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is rarely possible because of symptomless nature of the disease in early stages. Screening with ultrasonography (US) followed by computer tomography (CT) in suspicious eases is not sensitive enough and diagnostic work-out has to involve endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreato~aphy (ERCP) v, ith histology or at least cytology m most cases Percutaneous fineneedle aspiration, is claimed to promote tumor-cell seeding, thus intraductal brush-cytology or biopsy should replace it if deep catheterization of pancreatic duct is possible However, diagnostic efficacy of the intraductal approach is not known. In the last year, we performed ERCP in 52 patients with pancreatic tumor. Cy'tology or biopsy was taken in 29 patients (both in 10 cases wnh further supplementary techniques in 2 other patients) The intraductal cytology confirmed ERCP diagnosis in 11 patients, it x~as negative in 11 cases The intraductal biopsy was posture in 3 and negatb, e in 9 patients Both techniques ~,,ere successfial m 3 cases, only cytology m I patient, neither confirmed ERCP diagnosis in 6 cases In 5 patients duodenal biopsy also helped the ~orkout ho~e',er, it v, as negati',e in 2 cases with highly suspicious lesions Conclusion mtraductal cytology and bmpsy can confirm diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in 50 % and 33%, respecti',ely but ERCP remains the gold standard until magnetic resonance imaging (MRCP) will replace it for diagnostic purposes Operative endoscopy for mtraductal sampling and palliation will keep its important role even later on Recendy we postulated that chronic ethanol feeding can cause pancreatic injury by modulauon of phospholipase D (PLD) acttxaty fan early marker of regeneration) On the other hand qumolone annbtonc, ciprofloxacm (Cipro), which mlubtt prokaryouc cell growth and protein s'ynthests, is known to improve the recovery from liver injury after ethanol The present study was undertaken to detarrnme the influence of Clpro on PLD aenwty and other parameters of pancreatic regeneranon a.fter chronic ethanol feeding. Methods: Male rats were pair fed ad hbttum wth isocaloric liqmd Lieber DeCarli diet with or without ethanol content. After 6 weeks of feeding alcoholic and non-alcoholic rats received Cipro (p o. 100mg/kg/day) or saline for 4 addiuonai weeks. At the end of treatment some rats received also t h mfuston of caerulem (Cue) (0 25 p.g/kg,'h), to sumulate PLD actavlty. After 6 and 10 weeks of thfferent treatment modes. rats were kdled, dispersed pancreatac acmt were prepared and loaded w~th ~H mynsuc acid to label phosphatidylcholine pool, and phosphaladic acid (;H PA) was counted as a marker of PLD actiwty.

Some patients complain of persistent abdominal pain associated with high serum levels of pancreauc enzymes, but without definite signs of chronic pancreatitis. This condition has been regarded as possible or mild variant of chronic pancreatitts. In the present report, we proposed a new pathophystologm hypothesis and therapeutic strategies for this condiuon. Patients and Methods. Six patients. 2 males and 4 females, 32 to 62 yrs old, with persistent abdominal pain (more than 3 yrs.) and elevated serum pmacreatlc enzyme levels have been treated in our department. US. CT and ERCP did not show any significant abnormality in any patient. One or more pancreauc enzymes, i.e., serum p-type isoamylase, elastase-1 or trypsin. showed sustained elevation. Peroral trypsin inh]bltors had been administrated but had failed to induce a sufficient response. From precise medical interviews, a vicious psycho-somauc cycle consisted of the fotlowmg three processes was hypothesized: l) Depressive mood and anxiety reducing hypersecretion of pancreauc juice. 2) Elevation of the mtraductal pressure resulting from pancreauc hypersecreuon causing abdominal pare and increasing the serum levels of pancreatic enzymes. 3) Exacerbation of the symptoms aggravating the depressive mood and anxiety of the patient. Based on this hypothesis, a therapeutic strategy, focusing parocularly on the physician-patient relationship was formulated. The patients were treated under this strategy and have been followed up for 2 to 8 years at the authors' clime. Results. All the six cases showed rapid improvement not only m their physical symptoms but also m their quality of life within a few momhs after inntating treatment. Serum pancreanc enzyme levels returned to normal in 5 of 6 cases. No complication has developed during follow-up period. Conclusions. The pathophystology )n these patients was completely different from that of definite chrome pancreatttts, and the condition should be considered a functional dtgesuve disorder similar to functional d x spepsla or imtable bowel ~', ndrome. Introduction. The liver has been proposed as a source of mediators that influences the lung damage in acute pancreauus.The aim of this work ts focused on the acUvatton of alveolar macrophages m a model of experimental lung damage associated with acute pancreantls and the influence of the liver tn this activation. Methods. The study design included four groups of male Wistar rats (300 g b.w.). In the first group, pancreatms was induced by intraductal admmtstratlon of sodium taurocholate (5%). In the second ~oup. an end-to-side portocaval shunt was performed immediately before pancreatitts induction in order to prevent the mtual passage trough the liver of substances released by organs revolved ,n the inflammatory process of the pancreas. A group of animals with mtraductai admtmstratton of physiologic saline and a group with portocaval shunt alone were also included as control groups m the study. Three hours after pancreatms reduction, physiologic saline administration or ponocaval shunting, a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and alveolar macrophages were obtained. Cells were counted, cultured m 6 dish plates, incubated for I h at 37\"C under 5% CO2 m air. and then. washed to remove nonadherent cells. Superoatants of cultured alveolar macrophages were obtained after 24 h of cell culture at 37\"C under 5% CO2 m air. Macrophage activation '.,,as evaluated by the release of NO. TNF and MIP-2. NO generation was measured by mtrtte accumulauon. TNF and MIP-2 were measured by using a commerczal ELk kit. Results. Induction of pancreauus was associated with the acuvauon of alveolar macrophages reflected m the mcrea.~ed generauon of NO. TNT and MIP-2. All these changes were prevented when a ponocaval shunt ~,,a.s performed before the mducuon of pancreautts. Portocaval shunt had no effect m the local ~eventy of pancreauus, reflected by serum ilpase [evel~ Conclusion.

To clarify generic alterations based on the histological charactedstics of ductal epithelium and examine the spatial relationship of different types of genetic alterations in the early stage of pancreatic carcinogenesis, we conducted an extensive, tolal-area, muiOfocal analysis of K-ras gene mutanons and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at p53 gene locus occurring in cases of mucin-prodocing tumor (MPT) of the pancreas. Patients and Methods. We studied three cases of MPT: One case each of intraductal papillary tumor (IPT), ducvectauc mucinous cystic neoplasm (DMCN) and megacysnc mucmous cystic neoplasm (MMCNL which were previously venfied to con~n vanous atypias of ductal epithelium including carcinoma, and to harbor K-ras gene mutation and LOH of p53 gene. After histological exammauon, a total of 126 sites were mlcrodissected from the section representative of each entire lesion of the three cases, and the geneac analyses were performed. Results. in all three cases. K-ras mutations were found m tissue with nuld atypla of ductal epithelium, and always (100%) in regions of moderate atypla or higher, whereas LOH of p53 gene was seen m moderate atypla or higher. and at 50% or more in severe atypta (carcinoma). LOH of p53 gene was always associated with K-ras mutauon. In contrast to K-rm mutataons, LOH of p53 gene showed a more gradual tendency to increase with atypm. Moreover. in all three cases, K-ras mutation was dismbuted wMely throuo_hout the tumor, but LOH of p53 gene was localized to one or a few Mstologtcally homogeneous areas. Whde the [PT and DMCN cases showed single types of K-ras mutation and LOH of p53 gene, the MMCN case presented two types of each genetic altemuon occumng separately m different areas. Conclusion. From these data we could confirm that K-ras mutation occurs in the early stage of tumongenests, and LOH of p53 gene supenmposes on the K-ras mutauon dunng the course of tumor progression. In addmon, these alterations were homogeneous w~thm the individual area of the same Mstolomcal characterisoc. Further. m the MMCN case the double mutst]ons of K-ras ~ene may indicate a different histogenesis of this ty. pe from the other two types of ~iFl'. a notion that has long been proposed from a clinical and anatomical view point.

The tnlury-causmg mechanism is not well understood. However, piatelet-activatmg factor (PAr\"), whmh is generated during the onset of acute pancreatitis, has recently been implicated tn several inflammatory conditions including panc~eatitis. This study uses the enzyme rPAF-AH (ICES Corp., Bothell WA) to deactivate PAF and details the effects of this drug on the severity of lung inlury. Methods: The biliopancreatic duct of opossums was ligated under sterile COnditions, leading to the development of severe necrotmng pancreatitis within 24 hours, with increasing seventy over several days. Increased serum amylase and lipase, necrosis of pancreatic amnar cells, and infiltration of inflammatory cells characterized the disease. One to four days after duct blockage, opossums were administered esther rPAF-AH or a placebo. Results: The placebo.treated animals showed acute lung injury three days post-ligatton. The seventy of injury progressed with time and was marked by enhanced microvascular permeabdffy as quantitated by extravasation of FITC-labeled albumin into the lungs and morphological damage seen m hematoxytin-eoslnstained paraffin sections.

In ~his study, we compared the exocrine secretion and histological ehanges of pancreas of Kob with that of Wistar rats. To clarify the mechanism of the pancreatic disorder, the binding of CCK-8 to the pancreatic membranes were also examined. Methods. Male Kob and Wistar rats at 10, 12, 16 and 20 weeks were used. Cannulas were inserted into biliary and pancreatic ducts, and duodenum. Bile and pancreatic juice were returned to the duodenum continuously, and on the 3rd day, CCK-8 (250 ng/kg/hr, i.v.) was administrated. Pancreatic juice was collected every 30 rain in conscious rats. To measure the CCK-8 binding to pancreatic membrane, pancreatic membrane fractions were incubated with '=I-CCK-8 for 60 rain and the radioactivity of membranes were counted. The number and affinity of CCK receptors were estimated by Scatchard analysis. For histological examination, slices of pancreas were dyed with hematoxylin-eosm and azan-mallory methods. Results. Compared to Wistar rats, the stimulation of protein output of Kob by CCK-8 was weaker from 16 weeks and continued to diminish up to 20 weeks. The bindings of CCK-8 to pancreatic membranes in Kob were lower from 12 weeks and continued to diminish up to 20 weeks. In Scatchard analysis, the insufficiency of CCK-8 binding to pancreatic membranes was denved from decreased numbers of CCK receptors.

Within recent years evidence has been produced establishing the relauonshmp of cancer cells and stromal cells for tumorinvas~on. One mediator which may play an important role in such processes is transforming growth factor ~l (TGFI31), because this mullffuncaonal cytokme regulates cellular funclaons such as epithelial cell growth, differentianon and the synthesis of extracellular mamces. Although ~t ~s well known that TGFI3 transduces the signaling through a heterodimeric complex of the type I and type II TGFI~ receptors (TI3RI and TI3RII), no study has been corned out to examine their expresston simultaneously in tissues of pancreatic duct cell caromoma (PDC).

After operation. he was treated with chemotherapy because of metastasis. He enterered the hospital with a chief complaint of cough and general fatigue. His condition deteriorated and he died of respiratory failure two months later. An autopsy revealed pieural and pencardial carcmomatosis with metastases to the liver, nght adrenal gland, diaphragm, esophagus, vertebrae and lymph nodes. The cause of death was considered to be respiratory failure. As an incidental finding, the head of the pancreas showed a lesion of ductule-likc structures measunng 2,5 ram.

In addition to slightly different anatomy, the lipid contents of human and rat pancreas differ, but are more similar than those of ox and guinea-pig pancreas (Durand et al. Pancreas, 1987; 326-332) . It is well known that the same experimental disease model gives different results in different animals. Materials and Methods. Pancreatic glands from 25 alcoholics, 86 patients with heart disease, and 1618 rats, and pancreatic powders from horse and pig were examined for amylase, ~-hexose amidase, carboxyl ester lipase, cctipase, elastase, insulin, lipase, phospholipase A2, PSTI, trypsin, A~so, Lowry, and pH. Pancreatic glands were minced, delipidated, and air-dried. Pancreatic powder was dissolved in buffer (1 g/10 ml, pH 5.0 and 8.0), stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes and centrifuged 2x10 minutes (cell centrifuge, 2000 rpm). The supematant was used for the above mentioned examinations. Results. A pronounced variation in the composition of the different pancreas was found. Even some differences in the two human groups were seen, which support findings that eg. obese patients, who get pancreatJtis, are in a more senous condition than lean patients. Conclusions. The differences in compositions of pancreatic enzymes, hormones, other proteins, and liplds may explain why good animal models have solved only few of the questions in the understanding of the causes of human pancreatic diseases, and have contnbuted very little to treatment and prevention. Healthy subjects commordy expenence fullness, bloating and mild abdominal discomfort follow~ng mgestaon of large meals. When h'equent and severe, these symptoms commonly are attnbuted to the u'ntable bowel syndrome. Whde more rapld digestion presumably would reduce these symptoms, unimpresmve results have been obtained m previous studies empinymg pancreatic supplements that are denatured m the stomach and thus provide rrummal enhancement of digestzve activity. The purpose of the present study was to determine ff nucroencapsulated pencrealac enzymes (MPE) (CreonX; Solvay Pharm.

METHODS: In a randomized, doubleblind, crossover study, 18 subjects ingested a breakfast consstmg of 185 g of cookies (1196 calories and 72 g of fat) and three MPE capsules or ~dentacal placebo. The seventy o[ gastrointestinal symptoms and frequency of flatus passages were recorded for 17 hours, and endalveolar breath samples were obtained hourly for I0 hours. RESULTS: For the entire test period, ingestion of pancreahc supplements was associated with a mgn~cant (P<O.05) reduction m bloating, and reduclaons m perception of gas, flatus frequency, and nausea that had P values between 0.05 and 0.10. Independent analysis of early versus late symptomatology showed that MPE produced stgndacant (P<0.05) reductxons m bloating, gas, and fullness dunng the droner to bedtame period. MPE had no mgnificant effect on breath H2 or CH~ excretann. CONCLUSIONS:",

Morphologically chronic pancreatitis is characterized by irregular sclerosis with destruction and loss of the exocrine parenchyma. It is known that at some stage during disease process chronic pancreatitis clin,cally presents tumorous swelling, often suspected to be carcinoma. This stage is also known as the tumorforming stage of chronic pancreatitis. Patients and Method. Ten cases of so-called tumorform ng type of chronc pancreatitis which were detected as a tumor on computed tomographic scanning or physical examination were studied hidtopathologically. Eight of the 1 0 cases were in heavily alcoholic drinkers. I-n 7 cases the tumorous lesion was located in the head of the pancreas, and in 3 cases in the body and tad.

Introduction. In PPPD for advanced diseases, peripyloric lymph nodes are resecxed sacrificing the first gastric branches of the dght gastric artery. (RGA) and right gastroepipinic artery (RGEA). We examined the effect of different procedures of pedpyinric vessels on gastroduodena[ blood flow. Patients and Methods. In 14 PPPD cases (8 pancreatic cancer, 3 biliary cancer and 3 other diseases) operated in our Depamnent fi'om February 1.995 to May 1997, gastroduodenal tissue blood flow was measured intraoperativeiy by a laser flow meter (MBF3D, Moor Instruments, U.K.). Measurement was performed three times [before starting resection, after removal of the organs (REM) and after finishing reconstruction (REC)] at the serosal surface of the duodenum (2cm anal from the pyloric ring), antrum (2 cm oral from the pyloric ring) and body of the stomach, respectively. Change was estimated as a percent of the value obtained before resection. Results. In 13 cases, one of the following modes was performed; type I (n=5): preservation of RGA and cutting RGEA near its origin, type 2 (n=5): cunmg both RGA and RGEA near their origins with all gastric branches preserved, Type 3 (n=3): resection of the first gasmc branches of both RGA and RGEA. In one case excluded from this study, RGA was cut at the origin and the first gasmc branch of RGEA was resected. In general, blood flow significantly decreased after the removal of the organ (REM) in the duodenum and the antrum, then recovered to some extent after reconstrucuon (REC) m the duodenum. No sigmficunt change was observed m the body. The table shows the results. Table. Values: mean\" SE (%). *\" p<0.05 vs type 1.

Kuroda First Department of Surgery, Kobe University School of Medidne, Kobe, Japan Introduction. Mechanism for renal failure in acute pancreatitis remains unclear. We hypothesized that renal cell injury via apoptosis is involved in renal failure with acute pancreatitis. Methods. Necrotizing pancreatitis was induced on male Wistax rats by retrograde injection of sodium deoxycholate into pancreatic duct. Six h later, the kidney was harvested and apoptosis was evaluated by in situ nick-end labeling and by DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. The asotic fluid, which was collected 6 h after development of pancreatitis, was injected intraperitoneally into normal rats, and apoptosis in the kidney was also evaluated as described above. In vitro, apoptosis-inducing ability of the ascitic fluid was estimated using isolated rat renal tubules and normal rat kidney cell line (NRK52E) by nuclear stainixtg and by cell cycle analysis in addition to DNA electrophoresis. Results. Apoptosis was detected by in situ nick-end labeling on the renal tubules 6 h after induction of DCA pancreatatis m vivo, and was confirmed by DNA fragmentation. Similar tubular apoptoms was also detected 6 h after intrapentoneal injectaon of the ascitic fluid in normal rats. In in vitro analyses, the ascitic fluid reduced nuclear and DNA fragmentations on the isolated renal tubules, and increased the apoptotic cell ratm on NRK52E cells in a time-dependent manner. Conclusions. Apoptotac cell death of renal tubules occurs in severe acute pancreaht:s, and ~s possibly involved m the mechanism of renal failure via apoptosis-mducing activtty in pancreatitis-assoc~ated astatic fluid. been reported in clinical cases of acute pa~creatitis, thymic change in acute pancreatitis is still unknown. To investigate impairment of cellular immunity in acute pancreatitis, alterations of thymus in the rats with acute pancreatitis were examined experimentally. Methods. Male Wistax rats were used and two groups with pancreatitis of different grades of severity and control group for each other were developed. Edematous pancreatitis was induced by 4-h continuous intravenous administration of cerulem (5pg/kg/h), and necrotizing pancreatitis was induced by retrograde injection of 0.1 ml of 10,% sodium deoxycholated into biliopancreahc duct. The thymus weight and number of thymocytes were estimated. Apoptosis in thymus was examined by the in situ nick-end labeling, by DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, and by cell cycle analysis using proptdium iodide. Results. Both thymus weight and the number of the thymocytes decreased significantly in the rats with necrotizing pancreatitis 6 h after introduction of pancrearltis (p <0.02 vs. sham operation). Neither thymus atrophy nor the thymocyte reduction was observed in rats with edematous pancreatitis. In the thymus from the rats with necrohzing pancreatitis, in situ nick-end labeling showed mgruficant increase of apoptotic changes of thymocytes, which was also confirmed by step ladder pattern on agarose gel electrophoresis of the extracted DNA and by cell cycle analysis. Conclusion. Thymus atrophy associated with apoptoms occurs in the rats with necrotizmg pancreattt~s. Introduction.

The problems a~sociated with such u'eatments have been reposed to be infection, biliary sludge, migration of endoprosthcses, and re-smnosis by tumor growth. To overcome these problems, we adopted intracavitary in-adiation and microwave tissue coagulation therapy (MCY) in combination with serf-expandable metallic mesh smut (EMS). Materials and Methods EMS (Wal~ent@, Accuflex| NT stent| or Memotherm| ) was inserted through the pemutaneous tnnshepatic drainage (FrBD) fistula on 50 consecutive patients with malignant bile duct obstruction, including two patiants who underwent endoscopic insertion. In selected patients, intracavitary in'adiadon using remote aftedoading system (RALS) with 60Co was combined in order to control the stenosis by rumor growth. Total dose of 32 to 48 Gy with 4 to 6 sessions of RAI.,S was applied to each pafienL Percutanoous MCT was also performed in patients with biliary stenosis by tumor growth after s~enting in order to ablate the tumor and dilate the bile duct. Results All of these patients have been followed up. Three patients suffered from biliary stanosis after EMS stenting and they were treated with MCT and/or EMS insertion. We observed no complicanons relating to the smut inse~ion, irradiation or MCT. Patients died of GI bleeding without jaundice or cholangitis, liver fmlure due to portal vein occlusmn or multiple hapauc metastases 3 to 12 months after the stent mserdon. Conclusion Our experience shows that EMS could be easily inserted through the PTBD fistula wlthout complicaaons, and pereutancous transhepatic inU\"acavimry irradianon and MCT could provide good palliation for patients with malignant bile duct obstruction, Introduction Perineural invasion is one of the most important prognostic factors in pancreato-biliary wact cancer, and recent reports indicate a close relationship between expression of neural cell adhesion molecule (NC.~ and cancer im'dlzadoo into the permeutal space.

However, little is known about the development of regulatory peptide receptors in pancreas. Receptors for cholecystokinin (CCK), bombesm (BBS), seeretin, vasoaetive intestinal peptide (VIP) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were therefore visualized and quamified by storage phosphor autorediography in rat pancreas at various ages. Method. The panereata of three rats in each of age group (10 days, I month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months) were removed and rapidly fiozen at -80 ~ C. Tissue sections were incubated with each labelled peptides mentioned above at concentration of 100 pM. Alternate slides were incubated with addition of 1 gM of the corresponding non-radioactive peptides to determine the extent of non-specific binding. Results The specific binding of CCK (3.8 + 06 finol /mg protein) and BBS (1 2 4-0.3 fmol /mg protein) in the panereata of rats was able to be visualized at the age of 10 days and kept increasing with their aging. The h~ghest binding for CCK and BBS at the age of 12 months was 40 _ 0 9 and 4.6 + 0 7 fmol / mg protein separately. The panereata of rats at the age of 10 days expressed receptors for EGF w~th similar binding capacity (3 6 4-0 7 fmol /mg protein ) as that at the age of 1 to 6 months (3 8 4-1.1 fmol /mg protein) However, the EGF receptors in the pancreata of rats at the age of 12 months were significantly decreased (0 9-L-_ 0.3 fmol /mg protein) It could be observed that VIP and seeretin receptors in the pancreata of rats increased from the age of l0 days (1. I 4-0 4 and 0 9 _ 0.2 fmol /mg protein) and reached to the peaks at the age of 3 months (4 5 -,\" 1.6 and 5 1 4-0.9 fmol /mg protein) then decreased gradually.

Japan, School of Medicme, Kitakyushu, Japan Introduction. TGF-I] 1 and extracellular matrix (ECM) are known to play an important role on the process of fibrosis. The histological alterations ia human chronic pancreatms are scamng of acinar parenchyma and diffuse fibrosis, and overexpression of TGF-~I and ECM gene has been observed in the pancreas. Furthermore, transgemc mice overexpressing TGF-~I is shown to develop massive pancreatac fibrosis. The pathogenesis. however, remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the senal changes of gene expression of TGF-I~I and ECM (fibronectin, type L III and IV proeollagen) of the pancreas in oleic acid-reduced pancreatitic rats. Method. Pancreatitis was induced by a single intraductal infusion of 50 I, tl oleic acid in male Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g. These rats were killed at I, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 wks after lntraductal infusion. Total R.NA was extracted from the pancreas using acid guan=dinium thiocyanatephenol.chloroform method. Expression of TGF-~I and ECM genes was determined by Northern blot analysis. Immunoreacuvlty of fibronectm and type Ill procollagcn in the pancreas was assessed by using the labelled streptavtdin biotin method. Results. TGF-[~I mR.NA expression was detectable at I wk after ole=c acid treatment and reached the peak value at 2 wks. Fibronectm, type 1. III and IV procollagen mRNA expression was detected at I wk and reached the peak value at 2 wks after the treatment. On immunolustochetmstry, fibronectm and type I~ collagen ~mmunoreactwtty was ovserved at 4 wks. Fibronectm immunostammg was found around the tubular complexes, whereas type I]I collagen tmmunostammg was detected around small vessels as well as around the tubular complexes m the pancreas. Conclusion. Increased express=on of TGF-~I at 1-2 wks after oletc acid treatment was comczded with that of ECM. These results suggest that TGF-I~I plays an important role on pancreat=c fibrosis m the early stage of ole=c acld-mduced pancreatms m rats.",

The etiology of type 2 diabetes is very complicated and not entirely clarified. However, both deteriorated insulin secreUon and insulin resistance are related wrth the development of diabetes. The reduction of ~nsulin-producmg beta cells were often seen in type 2 diabetic patients by autopsy. Such reduction might be the basic defects that lead glucose mtoterance. On the other hand, the reduction of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), a key factor for glucose-reduced insulin secretzon, was seen In some diabetic ammals. Methods. We Jnvestigated if the amount of beta cells would affect the beta cell function or GLUT2 expression tn beta cells, The following 3 groups were prepared ; 1) 50 % pancreatectornlzed (Px) rats at 6 weeks 2) The rats transplanted 1000 rslets under the renal capsule at 6 weeks 3) control rats. At 10 weeks, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed m each group Then the islets were isolated and perffused to study their function. And Some islets were homogenized for GLUT2 ~mmunoblortmg Results. Daily blood glucose (BG) levels, body weight, and HbAlc levels at 10 weeks were not different among each groups In OGTT, BG levels at 30 mm were szgnfficantly hzgher, and serum insuhn levels at 0 and 60 m=n were szgmficantly lower Jn Px group. However, Insulin secretion assessed by ~slet perffus[on were preserved in Px group. Moreover, GLUT2 expression evaluated by Western blot were not significantly different among each group Conclusion. Insuhn-secretmg function and GLUT2 express=on were not influenced by 50 % Px or add=txonal transplanted islets. In Px ammals, their beta cells could compensate the reduced beta ceil mass by overworking. Nevertheless. their beta cells could maintain the msuhn secretion and GLUT2 express=on, which suggested that the reduced beta cell mass or their overworking alone could not explain the mechanism of beta cell dysfunction often seen ~n diabetes Introduction.

It had been reported that an autotmmune mecharasm may be revolved m some panents wlth i&opathlc chromc pancreamls, wi'ach could called as \"autoanmune pancreamls\" We ~ve reported that autoanribodies against carbomc anhydrase II (CA-[I) were 1denufied in some ofthesu pauents. However, it is sull unknown whether CAII plays an important role in the pathogenesis or not. To clarify it, we established an animal model of auto, mmune pancreauus using neonatal thymectommed mice immumzed wuh CA-[I. Materials and Methods. Ei~t Balb/c mice m each group were thymectom~.ed on the 3rd day aRer birth (3dTx). At the penod of 3 weeks old, rmc,r were subcumneooslly tmmurazod with 0 ling of CA-II with complem Freund's adjuvant, and sacnficed after twice booster mjecuuns Normal rmcc irrunumzed with or without anugens and 3dTx-nuce rejected with adjuvant alone were served as controls, Antibodies agmnst CA-[I were serially measured. We studied lustolng~cal findings of the pancreas, salivary. gland and hver, and the subsets of mf-dtratmg lymphocytes by zmmuno-hJstochemlstry and flow c vtometlc analysis. Gene expressions of [FN-y and 9\"-.I. were also analyzed by RT-PCR Results, Fhstologlcal studies showed degeneratlve changes ofacmar cells m seven and mfiln-anng lymphocytes around the pancreanc duct m four of c=ght 3dTx-mlce immunized v,~th CA-ll Infiltranon oflymphocytes miD the duct of sahvary gland or bdlary duct was found m all ~mmun~zed n-ace Flow cytomctD' and tmmunobastochermcal studies showed predominant mt]Itratmn of CDg posluve cells m each immunlzed mouse.

The short-term safety of endoscopic sphincter dilation (ESD) remains to be defined. We prospectively investigated the rate of pancreatitis and changes in pancreatic enzyme values induced by ESD. Patients and Methods. One hundred nine patients with common bile duct sZones were treated using ESD between luly 1995 and September 1997. Serum amylase values were examined before and after the procedure in 102 patients treated 106 times and these findings were compared with the incidence of paucreatitis. Patients were classified into three categories according to serum amylase levels before therapy (A group: within the normal range. B group: over the normal range up to 500 mU/ml, C group: above 500 mU/mt). The severity, of pancreatitis was categorized into four grades (mimmal: abdominal pain after the procedure lasting no longer than the next morning, mild: with elevation of amylase values to at least three times normal and abdominal pain necessitating treatment for three nights after the procedure, moderate: reqmred 4-10 nights treatment, severe: required intensive care). Results. Serum amylase levels after the procedure in groups A and B were elevated significantly compared with baseline levels, in contrast, levels in group C decreased. Overall, amylase levels after the procedure were elevated in 95 studies. Minimal or mild pancreatitis developed in 21 (15 minimal and 6 todd) patients from groups A and B only. The absolute values of serum amylase levels after the procedure in patients who developed mild pancreatitis were significantly higher than those in patients who did not develop pancreatitis. Conclusions. Although pancreatic serum en~.'mes were elevated in almost all patients after ESD. procedure-related pancreatnis developed in a small percentage. Among indications for th~s procedure, there does not seem to be any contraindication regarding treatment of pattents wtth high amylase levels. although such patients sometimes have stone-related pancreat]t=s or may be predisposed to developing this disorder. Introduction. Patients with chronic pancreatifis are reported to have a somewhat higher prevalence of pancreatic carcinoma than the general population. Furthermore, recognition of carcinoma in patients with chronic pancreatitis is reported to be difficult.",

Introduction. A possible cause-effect link between the presence of lipopolysacchande (LPS) in the bloodstream and the appearance of acute pancreatitis has been suggested. Th~s study was des,gned to assess the effect of LPS adminustration on different acute pancreatitis markers ustng rodent expenmental models. Materials and Methods. Male, Wistarrats walghmg 180-200 g, were fasted for 16 h and then received 4 tntra pentoneal injections containing 10 mg/kg Salmone//a LPS at 1 h intervals. Control rats received sterile nonpyrogentc saline. Rats were exsangulnated and the pancreas removed at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 h and 4 d after LPS admm]stratuon. Pancreatltisassociated preteen (PAP) express,on was assessed by vertical SDS-PAGE in 12.5 % gels and Western blot analyses In other sanes of experiments, male, 25-30 g Swiss mica rece,ved the same treatment as rats. Mice were also sacr~ced at different times thereafter, the pancreas was removed and RNA was extracted, punfied and separated by electrophores,s. Gen=c express=on of TNF..a was established by Northern-blot analysis ustng a TNF--a probe labeled with =P. Rasults. Plasma amylase act~v~y was significantly increased in LPS-~eated rats when compared ~th control an,reals (2,712\u2022 vs. 1,533\u2022 U/L. n=8, p<0001). Rat PAP was detected ~n the pancreas 6 h after LPS admm=stratJon. 4t was increased at 36, 48 and 72 h, then decreased and became undetectable by 4 d after LPS admmJstrat=on Expression of mouse TNF-<z mRNA was apparent 1 h after LPS admcntstrat=on, increased hy 2 h and were still high 6 h after LPS adm,nlstratton. There was no TNF~ mRNA expression ,n control mice. Conoluaion. Thts study demonstrated that adm~n=stra'uon of LPS can =nduce expenmental acute pancreattt=s and suggested that the =nflammatory response in the pancreas may be involved ,n the early pathogenests of the disease. Introduction. Trypsinogen activation peptide flAP) is a sensitive indicator for the activation of trypsinogen. Urinary TAP is reported to be a useful marker for the prediction of severity of acute pancreatitis. In the present study, we measured plasma TAP in experimental pancreatitis in rats and evaluated the usefulness of measuring plasma TAP. Materials and Methods. Edematous pancrentitis was induced by inwaperitoucal injections of 40 ~tg/kg of caerulein (two times). Hemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced by an infusion of 0.5 ml of 0. I% trypsin and 5% sodium tsurocholate. Plasma TAP was measured by ELISA. Results. In caemlein induced pancreatltis, plasma TAP increased 1 h after the In'st injection of caerulera, and then decreased to pre-pancreatitis levels. The mean value of plasma TAP at lh (2.55-~0.82nM) was significantly higher thaa that at 0 h (0.62\u2022 nM). A subcutaneous injection of CCK antagonist ~'S-941 3 mg/kg) after caerulem significantly ini~bited the elevation of plasma TAP at 1 h. In trypsin-taurocholate induced pancreatitis, plasma TAP at 1 h was 41.88\u2022 10.66 nM. Plasma TAP decreased gTadually, but remained at significantly hi~er levels ( 18.81\u2022 raM at 12 h) than prepamcreafitis levels. The treatment wtth a synthetic trypsin inhibitor (ONO3403 lmg/kg) significantly decreased the elevation of plasma TAP m trypsintatwoeholate induced pancreatitis. Conclusion. Trypsinogen activation immediately after the induction of paucreatins by caerulem can be detected by measuring plasma TAP. Plasma TAP can be used for esnmating the severity of pancreatitis and the effectiveness of the treatment.",

OuchL DepartmelYPof Surgery, Miyagl Cancer Center, Natod, Japan.Introduction. Carcinoma of the pancreas still has a dismal prognosis. Because of the markedly improved safety of the pancreatic operation, pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) could be used as a palliatwe procedure with or without mtraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). However the benefits of a palliative operation and IORT for survwal and quality of life (QOL) of patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas are not clear.Patients and Method. Between January 1982 and December  1996, 13  patients recewed PD with positive margms and 32 patients underwent surgical bypass for the cancer of the head of the pancreas. Six of 13 patlents undergoing PD and 14 of 32 patients undergoing surgical bypass were treated with IORT Survwal and hospital-free survival (HFS), as an indicator of QOL were studied in these patients.

With recent progress of ulwasound ~cchnolo=~/, an inu-avascular ultrasound (IVUS) catheter was developed and inwaporml cndovascuhtr ulwasonography (IPEUS) ks now possible. IPEUS provides crisp, high-resoluuon, cross-sectional images perpendicular to ~h* portal vein ares, and portal vcm invasion ks diagnosed as oblkcrafion of an cchogcnic band of the portal vein wall. However, the rotational or~nm~ion and longitudinal extent of portal invasion arc difficult to understand in ~ of topographic anatomy of the portal vein. Thrcc-~ional (3-D) imaging of IPEUS has since facilita~xi the interpretation of the ultrasound scan. Patients and Method. The 3-D imaging of IPEUS was consm~ctexi in 20 patients of pancreatic head cancer who underwent operation and IPEUS, IPEUS was pcrforrn~ with 8-French, 20-MHz IVUS cathe~r from fiac branch of the superior rn~nt~wic vein. The IVUS catheter was withdrawn about 80 mm from the intrahcparlc pomon to the inn'apancrcafic portion at I mm/scc by a mechanical pull-back device. The 2-D imaging dam wcrc compiled in viclcotapc and wansfcrrcd to the workstation for 3-D imaging (NewaIVUS, Sc Irnagc, Los Altos, CA). The frame acquisition ra~ was 30 frames/see, and 3-D images were consn'ucaxi by surface rendering. Results. A IonDmdinal cut-open image was consu'uct~ and v:cwed from the various cut plane. The invasion area was depicted as a defect of the portal vcm wall. In case of compression, portal vein wall was kept intact and anatomical rclanon between rumor and the portal vcm wall was easy to understand. A lon~tudinal cut-open image also showed the conflucnc~ the splctuc vein, hepatic re'tory, and lymph nodes along the portal vein simultaneously. Conclusion. With the progT~S of computer ~chno[ogy, 2-D rVUS knagc was sampled in dig,tal format afmr analog-to-digltal conversion, and 3-D image could bc consu'uctcd. Thus. 3-D IVUS images mtIcct the portal vein snmcmrc correcdy because there is mimmal distoruon of the 3-D unagc.

Thereaiter nafamostat mesilate 240rag/d, in combitmfioo with the antibiobcs m~Jpenem Ig/d, was continuously mfi~sed for five consecutive days. Results. After CAPI, climcal signs and symptoms such as abdominal pain had improved, with amelioraUon of biochemacal parameters. Angiography revealed ~nprovement of pancreatic blood flow that was insuffident before CAPI. The sutural rate was 92.3% (24/26). Surgical exm~pa~on was performed in three cases. Coadunioas. CAPI in severe acute !:ancreauns was effectwe tn reducing mortality and preventing the development o[ necronc lesions. pancreatic cancer, and causes a difficulty of curative resection. Methods and result. In this study, all currently used human pancreatic cancer cell lines, PaCa-2, AsPC-1, SW1990 and Capan-2, were found to express an abundant c-ret proto-oncogene and ret protein which were identified to be a receptor for gtial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) as a member of receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily. In the invasion assay, the migration of pancreatic cancer cell was markedly induced by a cocultivation with human glioma cells, T98G or A172, capable of producing GDNF and its ex~racellular secretion. Anti GDNF antibody could suppress a majority of the migratory activity, but no~ all, in the cOnditioned media of gUoma cells. Checker board analysis on the migrauon showed both chemotactic and chemok=~.etic activity of GDNF. lmmunochemical localization of GDNF m human celiac ganglionic tissue attested to the contentmn. Conclusion. The specific neural invasion of human pancreatic cancer cell expressing a c-ret proto-oncogene spreads along a concentration gradient of GDNF produced from peripheral gang[ions.

As is known, the TNF-a, [L-6 and [L-8 play an important role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome and [L-4 and [L-tO inhibits the synthesis of cytokines by the mononuclear phagocytes. D)m to this the levels of TNF-~ IL-6. IL-8. IL-4 and [L-IO were measured in 32 patients with acute pancreatitis. Venous blood was sampled on the first, third and seventh days after admission. The more signiHeant increase of all inflammatory e~ok[ne levels was noted in patients graded as severe (APACHE lI score more than 7) compared with mihl ~m-oup. At the same time. the significant decline of IL-4 level and insik,ni[icant rise of IL-t0 was noted. The substantial changes of iL-4 and IL-IO levels in the patient with the mild course were not marked. The developments of the systemic complications accompanied by the increase of inflammatory cytokine level~, especially ,f TNF-~x and [L-8, with the simultaneous increase of [L-)0 levels and decrease of IL-4 levels.

Mucmous ductal ectasia (MDE) is characterized by mucin producing tumor causing pancreatic ductal dilatation. This study attempted to clarify the ctimcal, radiograph:c and histological features of this disease. Patients and Method. We reviewed total twenty eight cases of mucinous ducted ectazia which were reported in Korean literatures including our mght cases during a 6-yr period. Results. They included twenty men and eight women, aged 40-79 years. All patients presented w~th an iniaal clinical diagnosis of acute or chronic pancreaatis. suspected cystic neoplasm of pancreas, or biliary obstrucuon. At endoscopic retrograde pancreatngraphy, twent3\" mx patients showed mucin secretton from orifice (92.9%). twen~-five panents showed patulous ampullary onfice (89.3%). and twent!\" six pauents showed mucinous filling defects with dilatation of main pancreauc duct (92.9%). Pathological examinauon showed fifteen mtraductal papdlary mucinous hyperplasias (53.6%). rune intrad-uctal adenocarcmomas (32.1%). and four adenomas (14.396). Conclusion. With increasing use of ERCP. a diagnosis of SIDE should be made more frequently because lntraductal mucus provides an tmportant clue.

Bfliary pancreatitis, which usually remains edematous, sometimes progresses to hemorrhagic. We hypothesized that pancreatic duct obstruction deteriorates pancreatitis, and investigated the effects of pancreatic bile duct ligation (PBDL) on rat caerulein-i.nduced pancreatitis. Methods. In vlvo: Pancreatic bile duct ligation (PBDL) was performed in combinatlon with 6-h intravenous continuous caerulem infusion on Male Wistar rats. Serum amylase level and pancreatic histology were evaluated. In vitro: Isolated pancreatic actru were collected from the rats with 3-h PBDL, and amylase and LDH release induced by various concentration of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCKS) were estimated. Results. In vavo: Serum amylase level was significantly elevated and hemorrhagac change in the pancreas occurred in the rats with PBDL I h before caerulem administration. On the other hand, the rats m which PBDL was added 2h after the beginning of caerulein administration, the hemorrhaglc change was not observed. [n vitro: Preceded PBDL reduced amylase secretion from the acini induced by maximal (100pM) or supramaximal (10n.'vl) dose of CCK8 to 50% of control. Although no significant effect of PBDL was observed on the basal LDH release, preceded PBDL significantly enhanced LDH release in the presence of suprama.xinaal dose of CCK8. Conclusion. Preceded pancreatic duct obstruction deteriorates pancreatic histology of edematous pancreatitas to hemorrhagic via enhancement of intracellular autodigesnon.

Tando, 1\". Nakamura, T. Suda. The Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hirosaki Untversity School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan Introduction. Recent studies suggest that vagal nerve may play an important role in pancreatic exocnne function. And ~t has been well established that hormonal actions of gut peptides regulate pancreatic exocnne functzon Thss ~nterplay between neuronal and hormonal regulations on pancreaOc exocrine functLon Is still uncertain. We aimed to evaluate exocrine pancreatic function and cholecystokinin (CCK) release in patients with autonomic nerve dysfunction (AND) Patlents and Method. In 34 patients with diabetes (16 had AND) , 28 patients wlth chronic pancreatitis (7 had AND) , 6 patients with neurological disease (all had AND) and 8 healthy subjects, we studied pancreatic exocnne function by Secretln test. And test meal-stimulated CCK release were measured by radiolmmunoassay Autonomic nerve funct=on of patients were evaluated wRh Tilting test, RR interval on electrocard=ography, pdocarpme test and chn=cal symptom Results. Patients with AND of each group had a decreased pancreauc secretion in volume, b=carbonate output and amylase output. Basal CCK levels were not significantly different ~n patients wath AND and patients w~thout AND However, CCK release In response to the test meal s=gn=ficantly =ncreased =n patients w~th AND Conclusion.We conclude that patients w~th AND have pancreatic exocnne dysfunction, and that a slgn=ficant increase of postprandial CCK secretion =n patients w~th AND compensates for this pancreatic exocnne dysfuncttonDEVELOPMENT OF REGULATORY RECEPTORS IN THE PAN'CREATA OF RATS C Tang *~, I Biemond ~, ESM Jonge de-Muller, CBHW Lamers 2 Department of Gastroenterology, The First Hospual.

We report the East case managed with temporary. placement of endoscopic steals in the pancreatic duct across the papilla of Valor to eliminate suspected partial obsWacfion to outflow of pancreatic juice. Case Report. A 63-year-old woman with a history of cholangitis occurring three times within the recent ten yeats was referred to our institution from a private clinic. Endoscopic retrograde cholangin-pancreato~aphy (ERCP) demonstrated five stones measuring I2 mm in maximal diameter in the common duct. After obtaining informed consent, therapeutic ERCP with ESD using a Maxforce S-French balloon-tipped biliary catheter (Microvasive. Boston, M.A) with a total length of 180 cm and balloon length of 3 era (maximal diameter 8 ram) was conducted. The balloon was inflated manually with~tadiopaque contrast medium and saline to a maximal pressure of 8 atmospheres. Slight oozing was only observed after the dilation procedure. Thereafter. a 0.018 inch guidewire (Pathfinder: Boston Scientific Co.. Ltd.. Boston. MA) was passed through the diagnostic cannula into the bile duct after obtaining a pancreatogram. A S-French, 50 mm stem with side-holes (Green Pancreatic Stent: Wilson-Cook Corp.. Winston-Salem. USA) was then passed over the guidewire and placed across the papilla of Vater. Simultaneously, a #French. biliary, stent with a length of 20 crn (So[opass: Mictovasive. Boston, MA) was placed into the bile duct across the papilla of Vatcr. There were no complications or clinical symptoms associated with these procedures. The serum amylase levels decreased from175 IU,'] (before the procedure) to 147 IL'~1 (morning after the procedure) (normal range:100-320 [L',I). Three days after the procedure, these stents were removed endoscopically and the stones were completely cleared with 2 subsequent ERC sessions. Conclusion..Mthough our report is limited to a single case. temporary. pancreatic stenting has potential to prevent post-procedural pancreatitis by facilitating temporal' pancreatic drainage. To establish the reliability of this procedure, further prospective and randomized t/'ials arc needed.",

Phenethyl ,sotluocyanate (PEITC), a natural constituent of cruciferous vegetables, has been extensively investigated for its cancer daemopreventive activity in rodents In the present study, the effects of PEITC on pancreatic tumorigenesis induced by ,V-nitrosobts(2-oxopropyl'l amine (BOP) in hamsters were investigated separately in the initiation and post-iniuation phases. Materials and Methods. Female 5-week-old Syrian hamsters were twice given subcutaneous injections of BOP 7 days apart at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight as an iniuation treatment Groups l and 2 recewed etther 100 or I0 ~ reel PEITC per animal by gavage, 2 h prior to each BOP treatment Groups 3 and 4 were fed a diet supplemented with PEITC at a dose of 6 or 3 ~mol/g for 51 weeks aider the second BOP treatment Group 5 and 6 animals respectively served as BOP-positive and non-treatment controls At the end of week 52, all surviving animals were killed and h~stopatholog~cally examined for the existence of pancreatic proliferatwe lesions R~ults.

Mutations in codon 12 K-ras are frequently found in pancreatic cancer. It has been demonstrated that human T cells have the potential to recogmze tumor ceils expressing mutated ras pep~des. However, =t remains unclear whether T ceils can recogmze the same mutated peptides which express in the own tumor cells. Material and Method. We typed pancreatic cancer tumor for the mutations of K-ras oncogene by mutant allele specific amplification (MASA) method, and the sensitivity of MASA method was confirmed by direct sequencing method. Next, T cell response was analyzed against 18-mer peptldes (encompassing residues p4-21 of p21 ras, YKLVVVGAXGVGKSALTI where X is Gly, Val, Cys. Asp) deduced from codon 12 sequence of K-ras oncogene =n peripheral blood lymphocytes originated from 4 patients with pancreatic cancer Results. Two patients had T cell response against 18-met peptide with mutated peptide Val, whereas one pattent had the mutation of Asp from Gly, and another patient had no mutatton. However, no T cell response has been recogmzed in healthy volunteers. Moreover, there was no identltq between the mutation of K-ras pepttdes and T cell response ~n pancreattc cancer patients.",

Introduction. PPPD has a clinical merit over classical Whipple procedure in which dlstai stomach is rcsected. Recently, we have expanded tbe indication of PPPD to the majority of pancreatic cancer cases unless the stomach and proximal duodenum is involved. In some of these cases, pcdpylotic lymph nodes were resected sacrificing the first gastric branches of the fight gastric and right gastroepiploic vessels. We tried to evaluate the clinical significance of this procedure. Patients and Methods. In 50 PPPD cases [pancreatic mar.at (PC) : 20, biliary cancer (BC): 17, other diseases (OD): 13] u'eated in our Department from .May 1991 to November 1996. operative procedure and postoperative course was reviewed. Results. Operative mortality was 0%. In 45 cases (90%), one of the following 3 modes was performed; type I (n=21): presewation of right gastric artery (RGA) and cutting right gastroepiploic artery (RGEA) near its origin, type 2 (n=12): catting both RGA and RGEA nesr their origins with all gastric branches preserved, Type 3 (n=12): resection oftbe first gastric branches of both RGA and RGEA. in this, about 2 t=n length of the proximal duodenum was preserved for anastomosis. Type I was used for 4 PC, 6 BC and 11 OD (7 benign, 2 potentially malignant and 2 malignant diseases). Type 2 was for 7 PC and 5 BD. Type 3 was used for generally advanced diseases of 5 PC. 5 BC and 20D.

Aims: To determine in untreated CPI if GE of liquids is related to plasma peptide YY (PYY) and/or neurotensin (NT) and ,f nuthents in duodenum or ileum are related to plasma PYY and NT. Methods: We prepared 3 dogs by ligating the major and minor pancreatic ducts and inserting duodenal and tleal c.annulas to infuse nonsbsorbable markers and to asptrate intestinal samples. Each dog was fed 1 of 5 isocalodc test meals containing 850 kcal of vanous nutrient compos,tion according to a m=xture design and unlabeled PEG as a liquid meal marker. Intestinal samples were aspirated every 15 mJn to measure nuthents (carbohydrate, fat and protein) and meal (PEG) and infused markers. After calculating lummal flow rates, GE of liquids (area under curve of the amount rema,nmg tn the stomach) and the amount of nutrients delivered to the duodenum and ileum were calculated over 6 hr.

We recently developed an orthotopic segmental pancreas transplant (OSPT) technique. This study was done to determine if interposing the graft splenic vessels in this technique restores physiological graft hemodynamics and reduces thrombosis rate. Methods. This study was designed as a comparative study between OSPT with (the interposition group, n=l 1) and wrthout (the control group, n=t 1) interposition of the splenic vessels. On day 7 post'transplant, the recipient dogs were relaparotomized and grafts were assessed macroscopically, microscop,cally and functionally. In a subset in the interposition group (n=6), splenic artee/and ve,n flows and graft tissue blood flow were monitored through the revasculanzation procedures. Results. Thrombosis incidence was 9.1% and 54.5% in the interposttion group and the control group, respectively (p<0.05). The splenic artery and veto flows decreased markedly from 52.1 :t:17.2 mUmm and 40.24\" 14.3 mL/min at laparotomy, to 3.0-+ 1.9 mL/min and 1.8 ---2.0 mlEm,n after proximally established reperfus,on, respectwely. They Increased s=gmficantly immediately after the interpos,tion to 35.4+7.5 mL/m,n and 31.5+18.5 mL/rmn, respectively. The flows further increased to greater than 90% of the basal flows 2 hours after the mterposttion. In contrast, the graft t=ssue blood flows were not affected mgmficantly by the mterposttion. Conclusion. The mterpostticn of the splemc vessels ~n OSPT decreases the thrombos=s nsk by producing physiological splemc flows without an adverse effect on graft tassue perfus=on. OSPT w,th the splemc vessel ,nterposit,on may be climcally applicable. Introduction. Severe acute pancreatitis (AP) fi'equendy leads to shock or multiple organ failure (MOF) that are respousthle for a high mortality. It is known that corticosteroid inhibits a release of cytokmes, an activation of [eukncytes and phospho[ipasr A 2 that may be involved in the development to severe AP. In clinical practice, a large dose of methylpredonisolone (hiP) is useful to txeat patients with shock or MOF However, this therapy is not common in the u'eaunent of AP. In the present study, we determined the effect of IMP in the development of AP induced by closed duodenal loop (CDL) m rats. Materials and Methods. Male Wistar rats. weighing 160-220g, were used in this experiment. Four cm of CDL was prepared by ligating the duodenum at two points on both sides of the bile-pancreatic duct. The rats were divided into three groups as follows; (1) sham-operation (S), (2) CDL-pancreatius, (3) CDL-pancreatitis with MP (CDL*MP). MP (30 mg/kg body weight) was given to rats by an intravenous mjecuon via tall vein. The laparotomy was done again 6hrs after the preparation of CDL. and the ascltes was collected tbr measurement of the volume, trypsmogen activation pepude (TAP), IL-6 and TNF-ct {ELISA). Then, blood flows of the pancreas (splenic lobe) and the left kidney v~ere determined using a Laser Doppler blood flowmeter. Serum amylase actwtty, TAP. IL-6. TNFct and hematocrit were also measured. The pancreas were removed for measurement of its wet weight and for histological evaluation of the gland. Results. The administration of a large dose of MP sigmficanfly decreased the pancreatic weight, hematocnt, serum amylase acuvlty, volume and TAP concentrauon of asc~tes that increased m CDL group. Furthermore. both pancreatic and renal blood flows in CDL-MP group were sigmficandy higher than CDL group. MP also improved the degree of pancreatic edema and necroses induced by CDL. Conclusion. The present results suggest that a large dose of MP prevents the development of experimental AP m rats, MP may be asefu[ to treat pauents with severe AP. Medical School,Nagoya,Japan introduction. We investigated the surgical indications of mucinproducing tumors of the pancreas from the view points of the clinical diagnosis ,pathological tidings and operative methods. Patients and Methods. We perfomed surgery on 20 patients (12 men and 8 women) with mucin producing tumors of the pancreas during the penod January 1988 trough December 1997.Their ages ranged from 44 to 80 yr( mean age, 61 yr). Results.Pathological assessment revealed 11 mucinous cyst adenomas,4 mucinous cystadenocaroinomas (including one borderline case),2 invasive mucinous cyst adenocaroinomas,one intraductal papillary adenoma,one intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma and one hyperplasia. With regard to the operations,3 cases underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy,8 pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy,6 distal pancreatectomy,2 biopsies operation, and one enucleation of the cyst. We could pre-operatively diagnose 5 cases as carcinomas .Two were diagnosed by endoscop=c b~opsy,1 because of a fistula to the common bde duct and 2 because of the metastabc liver tumors or invas=on to the retropentoneum and portal veto .We have experienced no recurrence except in 2 b=opsied cases and one patient died from another disease. Conclusion. Operat=ve therapy for muc=n-produc=ng tumors of the pancreas is waranted because of the=r potent=al to progress and the difficulties tn different=ative diagnos=s of ben=gn and malignant lesions.

These effects were not seen tithe PD was decompressed. Inu'oducdon. TechnologJcal advance m serum amylase assay (enzy.vnanc method usmg autuanal,,7.er) made it possible to measure the enzyme acuvity accurately, reliably and rapidly. More than 90% of Japanese hospitals use this method now. Moreover, many hospitals employ ton amylase assay as a laboratory rouune test on admmmon.The chance finding of h,,peramylasemta is someames hard to evaluate, thereby I conducted the following stud,,-PauenLs and Method. ToNal serum amylase acUvmes were examined by an enzymatic method m 320 apparently healthy subjects >60 years of age (Group I) and ,n the same number of younger adults (18-59 years of age) (Group If) . P-type isoamylase assay, hpase assa); amylase lsozyme on cellulose acetate electrophorems, pancreauc altrasonography were performed m 27 mdivtduals m Group I and in 38 subjects in Group II who displayed hyperamylasetma. CT scan was performed in 12 Ln Group. I and in 8 :n Group lI who exlubttod P-type hyperamylasetma. Results. ToNal serum amylase levels m Group I (73 5 _--61.0 IU/L) were sigmficandy l'ngher than those in Group II (138.8=45 5 IU/L, P<0.01) . When 220 IU/L was taken as the upper limit of normal, 19.4% of Group I and 5.3% of Group II had values m excees of this upper hmit. Macroamylasemla was confirmed in one of 27 in Group [ and in ~vo of 38 in Group If. [n Group l, ultrasonography showed minor changes in 4 cases. All considered of no significant chmcal importance. CT scan was eventually normal m all cases examined. In Group II, norm of them revealed abnormal findings either on ultrasonography or on CT scan examined. Conclumoo. Asymptomatic hyperamylasemta should be examined for P-typa ,soamylase acUvl%\" and amylase isozyme on cellulose acetate electrophorems first. After excluding macroamylasemla by electrophosems, further exammaoon of pancreas should be performed only Ibr remaining patients who have P-~'pe hyperamylasemla. Aging should be considered one of the causes of h x peram.',lasemia of unknown euolog). Methods. Syrian golden hamsters (females, 5-6weeks of age) received a subcutaneous injection of N-nitrosobas(2oxopropyl)amine (BOP) at 70mg/kg. The hamsters then received further injections of BOP at 20mg/kg three times at two week intervals. Twenty weeks after the first injection, the hamsters were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and theft pancreases were exctsad. Tumor nodules in the pancreas were divided into two, one embedded in paraffin for H-E stairong and the other minced for primary culture. The cloning cylinder techmque was applied to obtain clones and aliquots of 1 x 10 + cells were inoculated trtto the subcutaneous tissue or the pancreas of hamsters. The resultant tumors were excised for histological examination. Results. The incidence of gross tumors m the pancreas induced by BOP subcutaneous mlection was 85% (6 of 7 sacnficed hamsters). Primary culture was performed for a large nodule. After about the 20th passage, we got epithelimd without tibroblast cells. After the 50th passage, its doubling time was 18 hours and when 1 x10 + cells were inoculated into the subcutaneous tissue or pancreas of hamsters, tumor nodules grew to about 5 mm m d~ameter after 14 days. The cell line has now been maintained m culture for more than one year. Conclusion.We have established a pancreatic ductal adenocarcmoma cell line ~n hamsters which is, b~ologtcally and morphologically, closely mmdar to human pancreatic ductal adenoc.arcmoma. It should therefore prove useful for development of treatment modalitles It has been suggested that humoral mediators are involved =n the mechanism of multiple organ fadure =n acute pancreatitis. We also showed that pancreatttis-induced ascJttc flu;d (PAP') from a canine model had a lethal effect on healthy rats injected with PAF. In thas experiment, m vivo 31p and 23Na NMR spectroscopy was used to study the potentLal mechanism of hepatocellular injury associated with severe acute pancreattt=s Methods. The changes in hepatic ATP hydrolys=s (inorgamc phosphate, Pi) and cytosohc phosphorylatJon potentml (I]-ATP/Pi) and intracellular pH (pHi) and mtracellular Na + concentration ([Na+] i) in the rats after 2 h following the onset of severe necrotlzmg pancreatitls induced by deoxycholic acid (DCA) were compared to those ~n healthy rats at 3 and 6 h after mtrapentoneal rejection of PAF obtained from DCA-pancreatitts rats. Results. In the liver of rats wRh 2 h of DCA-pancreatltzs, I]-ATP decreased to 48% of basehne, and Pi increased to 174% of baseline activity Hepatic [Na+]i increased tO 78 mM (p<0 05) along with a decrease in pHi (6 76. p<0 05) When PAP was Lnlected into the peritoneal cavity of healthy rats. ~t reduced hepatoceilular injury with mmJlar seventy At 3 h after the rejection of PAF the hepatic i % ATP/Pi ratio decreased to 0 49. the [Na+]~ increased to 43 mM (p<O.05) and the pH~ decreased to 7 30 (p<0 05). At 5 h after PAF rejection, the hepatic ~-ATP/Pi ratio decreased to 0 34 (p<:0 05). the [Na+]j was 51 mM (p<0 05). and the pHD was 7 05 (p<0 05) Conclusions. Acute pancreatlt~S causes dramatic changes tn hepatocellular btoenerget=cs and ion=c metabohsm, and PAF contains factor(s) reducing these changes Our data suggest that these changes m the liver early =n the course of severe acute pancreatltls may be revolved m the mechanism of mulhole organ failure assoczated with this disease Abstracts 281",

In nonfunction,ng tumors , hormone production is not clinically ev,dent. So the clinical behav,ors are quite different. Methods: We reviewed islet cell tumors of pancreas ,n the National Ta,wan Unwersity Hospital from 1978 to 1996. 26 ,slet cell tumors totally w,th 7 nonfuncboning tumors, 17 insulinomas and 2 gastnnomas were found Results: Pat,ents with nonfunct,on,ng tslet cell tumors cons,steal of 5 women and 2 men The mean age was 46.1 years. Abdominal pain, fullness, and body we,ght loss were the most frequent presentattons. Wh,le patients w,th funct,onlng islet cell tumors had a mean age of 45.7 years and manifestated as symptoms resulted from the hormones they secreted, such as consc,ous change ,nducad by hypoglycem,a Both of the nonfunctlonmg and funct,on,ng islet cell tumors were mostly located ,n the tad of pancreas ( 6/7 and 14/19 ) No abnormahty of laboratory data nor elevated tumor markers were found ,n nonfunctlon,ng tumors One of our patient with gastnnoma had MEN ( mult,-endocnne neoplasla ) type I.

Patients and Method:f7 patlents(43~73yrs old, male 12, female 5),with stage ~\" advanced pancreatic cancer were studied. Seven patients already had distant metastasis.5-FU(375mg/m~ wasused by continuous 24 hour drip infusion on day I to 5, 8 to 12, 15 to 19..A.DM(25mg/mZ)was bolus-injected on the first day only and CDDP(40mg/m~ was used by continuous 24 hour drip infusion ('FAP ~erapy). The whole regimen was repeated twice. Radiotherapy,using 6.0Mev Linac,1.7Gy a day (total5 iGy/30 fractions ) was used concomitantly with chemotherapy.The total period, including one week of no drug perlod,was seven weeks First Department of Surgery, Shimane Medical Universit% lzumo, Japan Introduction. Islet transplantation (Tx) may require neovaseularization process for better and longer function. VEGF known as the most potent angiogenie factor is reportedly detected in normal islet cells. Therefore. VEGF may play a role in neovascularization of transplanted islet. We investigated the expression of VEGF in the transplanted islet cells to test the above hypothesis. Methods. Transplantable islets were isolated from l.,cwis ratS (8 to 10 weeks of age) by discontinuous dextran gradient after collagenase digestion. Seven hundred to 1200 islets were injected into the intersc.apular subcutaneous tissue (SC, n=10) or portal vein (pV. n=7) of the same descent rats. In SC group, interseapular tissue was restored 1 or 4. weeks afar Tx. In pV group, the liver was resected 1 hour, 1 w~k or 4 weeks after Tx. Each tissue was fixed in formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin as 2-3 ram thick slices (4 or more slices for each tissue). Continuous 4 am slice was immunnstained for either insulin or VEGF using specific antibody. Normal pancreas and islets immediately afxer isolation were also prepared and immunostained in the same manner. Results. In SC group, insulin-positive cell was not detected in any slices. In PV group, several insulin-positive islets were found in the portal vein I hour after Tx and near the surface of the river I or 4 weeks after Tx. [n general. islets of 1 or 4. weeks postTx were fewer in number than islets of 1 hour PostTx. The islets immediately after isolation wet= insulin-positive and VEGF-positive as was seen in the islets of normal pancreas. Only a part of insulin-positive islets of I hour postTx seemed weakly stained for VEGF. However. islets of I or 4 weeks pos(l x were not stained for VEGF. Conclusion. VEGF is detected in the islets of normal pancreas and immediately after isolation. However. :t was not dete~ed in the islets 1 or 4 weeks after Tx. VEGF produced by :slet cells does not seem to play a role in islet nr at least shortly after Tx. Moreover. isolated islets may lack some function winch is normally exerted by islets m the pancreas tissue.",

Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies have been known in chronic pannereatitis (CP) patients. However, serum water-soluble vitamin and trace element [evds remain unknown.To clarify whether or not there am water-soluble vitamin and trace element deficiencies in CP patients, we measured water-soluble vitamins and mace elements of the CP patientS, subdividing into two groups (without or with steatorrhea). Patients and Methods. The subjects of the study were CP patients (n=26) (consisting of 16 cases without and 10 cases with steatorrhea) and healthy subjecrs(n=30). Blood sammples were collected in the morning before breakfast. We measured serum vitamin B1. vitamin B2, vitamin B12. folic acid and serum iron, copper, zinc. magnesium,and selenium. Result. Undernutrition was present in about 50% of CP patientS with stcatorrhea and about 30% of CP patients without steatorrhea. Moreover. The scram levels of vitamin B2 and selenium in CF patients with steatorrhea were significantly lower than both those ia CP patients with steatorrhca and in healthy subjects. Fuurther. in several eases CP pataents with steatorrhea, the serum levels of vitamin B2. iron. copper, fine., and magnesmm were low under -2SO of healthy subjects. Cnclusioa. we must take the deficiences of water-soluble vitamins and Irdce elements into consideration in CP patients in spite of manifest dificiency symptoms. We have previously reported that the detection of K-ras mutatzons (KRM) m the pure pancreatic juice aspirated from the orifice of papilla Vater through cannula endoscop,cally ts useful for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Th=s study was undertaken whether the detect=on of KRM ,n the duodenal aspirate (DA) which is an easdy collectable sample would be useful for the screening of pancreatic and bdiar7 maJignancy or not. Materiels and Methods. DA was obtained from 27 patients with pancreatic cancer, 24 with chronic pancreat,t~s, 6 w,th bdiary tract cancer, 10 w,th adenomyomatosts of gallbladder. 12 w~th cholecystolithtasls, and 9 w,th no detectable diseases. E)A immediately after ERCP was aspirated using duodenal endoscope without the secretory stimulation by secretm. DNA was extracted from the DA. KRM at codon 12 ,n the C)A was analyzed by PCR-RFLP. Mutant al[ele specific amphficatton (MASA). and PCRhybndizatzon protect=on assay (HPA). Results. Inczdence of KRM m the DA w,th pancreatzc cancer was 42%(5/12) by PCR-RFLP, 63%(17/27) by MASA. and 42% (5/12) by PCR-HPA. That w,th chronic pancreatitls was 25%(4/16) by PCR-RFLP, 29%(7/24) by MASA. and 19~ by PCR-HPA Moreover. that w,th bihary tract cancer was 33%(2/6) by PCR-RFLP, 50%(3/6) by MASA, and 0%(0/6) by PCR-HPA. On the other hand. KRM was all negatwe by PCR-RFLP and PCR-HPA ~n the DA from patzents with adenomyomatos~s of gallbladder, cholecystohthlas~s, and no detectable d=seases. The ,nc=dence of KRM zn DA with pancreatzc cancer was lower than that (78% by PCR-RFLP and 66% by PCR-HPA) in the pure pancreatzc ]ulce w,th secretory stimulation by secretin. However. the relatwely h=gh percentage of KRM =n the DA with pancreat=c and bdtary cancer was found by MASA whzch xs a hlgl~ly senstt,ve method Conclusion.Oetectlon of KRM ,n OA ,s useful for the screening of pancreatic and bdiary cancer using a sens~twe method such as MASA. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which alcohol and its metabolites injures the pancreas nmlains unknown. We therefore compared the effect of different treatment agents in ethanol and FAEE induced pancreatic injury. Meterisle and methods. Ethanol or FAEE were infused into male Sprague-Oawlsy rats (n-12 per subgroup). Six different treatment regimens (2 protease inh=b,tors; (I) soybean tz~/psin inhibitor (STI), (2) gabexate mesilate (GAB); 2 oxygen free radical scavengem (3) 4. Hydrnxy-TEMPO (4.HT), (4) catalase; a xanthine oxidase inh,b=ter: (5) allnpurinol; and a calcium channel blocker: (8) verapomd) were infused paraIM to ethanol and FAEE in additional animals and the effects were compared to saline control animals. Pancreatic injury was assessed at 8 and 12 hrs by wet-dry ratio (edema). piaoma and t,ssue levels of tz3\"psin~en activation peptidu (TAP), and by light microscopy. FAEE-and ethanol-levels m serum were measured by gas-chromatography mass spectroscopy. R=ult=. Ethanol infusion led to generation of plasma ethanol and FAEE levels equivalent to those seen in intoxicated indiwduals. Ethanol and FAEE. hut not the saline controls, induced highly significant edema formation (p < O.OO 1 ), TAP (p < O.QO 1), and vacuelizatlon of pancreatic acmar ceils. The two protease rahab,tore reduced pancreatic TAP formatmn in both ethanol and FAEE induced inlury (p < 0.01), but did not reduce pancreatic edema, 4-HT, catalam and allopurinoi decreased both edema formation and TAP in ethanol and FAEE induced ,nlury (p <0.05}. Verapemd reduced edema in ethanol, but not in FAEE ,nduced injury, while TAP was reduced zn both (p < 0.01). Vacuoles in pancreatic acmar cells observed in all treatment groups were ,dentical to those found ,n the untreated control ammals, CenrTh~s study shows that ethanol and FAEE induce a pancreat~tls-like ~n}ury in rats which can he reduced by protease inhzb,tors, oxygen free radical scavengers, and caiomm channel blockers. Thus the mechanism of ethanol and FAEE induced inlurY to the pancreas seems to be identical and inciudes disregulatmn ,n these different steps. Inlz'odu~nn. The outcome of severn acute pancreatms it dependent on ,ts pulmonary and septic complications. Leukocyte adhesion and Infiltration are central events m the pathogeneszs of necrotizing pancreatJtis. The aim of the present study was to analyze the time poet and levels of the express,on of adhesmn molecules =n the pancreas and lung m pancreatttzs of different seventy and to assets whether treatment with a monoclonal antibody agamst ICAM-1 can reduce local and systemic complications. Methods. Expressions of ICAM-t ,n pancreas and lungs was rnvesttgated m 80 mate Spregue-Oawley rats at 3, 8, 12. and 24 hours after inductee of todd edematous {caerulein 5/~g/kg/h i.a. over 8 hrs), or severe necrotmng pancreas,tie (intraductal infusion of gly~odeoxycholic acid and caemlem i.e.} As assessed by immimohistnchemistry and Westem-bJut analysis ICAM-I expres=on was correlated w,th leukocyte infiltration (myeloperoxidase ant'~W) and histological changes. The possible therapeutic effect of monocianal antibodies agomst [CAM-1 was assessed by pancreat,c and lung edema, intrapancreat,c trypsmogen actntatton (TAP), leukocyte mfiltratlon, and histopathology ,n addittanal animais. gmlts, increased tCAM-1 expressom m pancreas was evident by 6 hours m edematous pancreatltis, hut at no time pmut ,n lung. Tn contrast ]CAM-1 was upregulated at 3 hours ~n the pancreas and at 12 hours in lang in necrotlzlng pancreat,t,s (p < 0.001).

Pancreatitis was induced by four intramuscular injections of cerulr (50 ~ g/kg at t-hour intervals). Pancreatitis rats were injected intraperitoneally with t0 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 6 hours following the first cerulein injection as a septic challenge. Pancreatitis rats were treated with a bolus intravenous injection of TCV309 (3 or 30 u g/kg) 30 minutes before the septic challenge. Intense mononuclear cell infiltration and lung hemorrhage occurred in pancreatitis rats with sepsis, but were not seen in pancreatitis rats receiving a bolus TCV309. The TCV309-treated rats had lower serum concentrations of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC), and lower levels of CINC mRNA in the Lung, as well as fewer the pulmonary infiltrates immunoreactivr for CINC or Mac-1 (CDI. lb/CDIS). LPS-stimulated m vitro CINC production by naive bronchoalveolar macrophages was significantly enhanced by pretreatment with PAF. Pretreatment with TMB-8 (an inhibitor of calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum), W7 (calmodulin antagonist), pyrrolidinr dithiocarbamatr (PDTC) (a potent inhibitor of NF-kB) completely abrogated the cbemoattractant production. Altered intracellular calcium, due to Ca 2+ efflux from intracellular stores, may be involved in the 'priming' of bronchoalveolar macrophages to release CINC following triggering with LP5 during acute ceru[ein pancreatitis. The PAF antagonist TCV309 effectively prevented pancreatitisassociated lung injury following the septic challenge. in pure pancreatic juice (PPJ). Here, to improve the genetoc diagnosis using PPJ, we tried to analyze p53 mutations of PPJ obtained by duodenal endoscopy from padents with PC, and compare with results of analysis of K-ras mutations. Materials and methods: PPJ was obtained from 26 patients w~th PC, 4 with mucin producing adenoma (MPA), 16 wtth chromc pancreatitis (CP) . PPJ were collected endoscopically through canula from papilla of Vater. DNA was extracted from PPJ, and amplified by PCR for exon 5, 6, 7 and 8 ofp53, respectively. Non-Rl SgCP was used for detection of mutant bands from whtch were recovered for direct sequencing analysis. In the same samples, the mutations of K-ras gene at codon 12 were also analyzed by the methods of PCR-RFLP and hybndizatton protection assay (HPA).Results: Of the twenty-s=x cases of PC, p53 mutations were detected in the 11 cases (42.3%). On ~e other hands, no mutatoons were seen =n ~e cases w~ MPA nor CP. In K-ras analys~s w~th PCR-RFLP wh=ch had a high sensttivtty in spite of some false positives, 84.0% (21/25) were mutatJon positive. By HPAwhlch was a quantitative method having the advantage of high specificity for PC, mutatlon was detected Jn 65.3% (17/26). Using combmanon assay with p53 and K-ras muta~ons, genetm abnormalities were seen in 92.0% with PCR-RFLP and 73.1% with HPA. In both methods, p53 alone was post~ve in two cases. Conclusions: \"The spectficlty of p53 mutations for PC ts very htgh, w=th some cases exmb=tJng only p53 mutation w~thout K-ras mutation. So. simultaneous analysis of p53 and K-ras mutation =s suggested to enhance the genetic diagnosts of PC. Introduction: A substztute for pancreas =nc!ud=ng transplanted pancreas should be provided after total pancreatectomy because =t is quite dtfficult to control blood glucose levels w=th penodtc msuhn administration. We constructed adenovtrus vector containing human insulin gene (Axlns), which was proved to produce human promsu[in enough to decrease blood glucose levels Kn dtabetic rats. Therefore, we tested the effects of in wvo insulin gene transfer using Axlns on pathological changes after total pancreatectomy. Materials and Methods: Nine Beagle dogs we=ghlng 10-13 kg were subjected to total pancreatectomy preserving duodenum and devlded mto three groups which were no insulin group (n=3), penodic msuhn admmlstratton group (10 units ,\"day of long acting human insuhn) (n=3), and Axlns group (n=3). Axlns of which bloactiv=ty was 4 x 1010 PFU, was mlec~ed via the spleen tmmedtately after total pancreatectomy. Survival penods, changes ~n blood glucose levels during the day, oral glucose tolerance test (OG'i-r) using 15 g of glucose, serum levels of human c-peptlde and total protein were momtored. Results: Mean survtval periods were 2 days ~n no msuhn group. 10 days ~n insulin group, and 25 days tn Axlns group.

Introduction. Immuno-gene therapy can be one of the approaches to improve the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients.To test its clinical feasibility,we have examined a possible antitumor effect of human pancreatic cancer cells producing intedeukin-2(IL-2),lL-4,1L-112,or IL-15 in nude mice. Methods AsPC-1 cells, human pancreatic cancer cells, were transdused in vitro with retrovirus vector ,LXSN ,containing a respective cloned cytokine cDNA. Transduced or parent AsPC-1 cells (lx10 ~) were injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally into BALB/c menu m~ce, and the tumor volume and the survival days were assessed. When cytokine-producing cells were rejected, parent cells were re-inoculated into the mice to examine whether immunity was induced.Results, Loss of tumorigenicity of IL-2-or IL-4-producing cells was observed when they were injected subcutaneously, whde the tumors of IL-12-or IL-15.producing cells showed the retardation of their growth. Inoculation of AsPC-1 cells, but not irravalent human colon cells, into the mice which had rejected cytokine producing cells showed retarded tumor growth of the rechallenged cells. Thus, tumor specific acquired immunity was generated. The survwal of the mice intrapedtoneally inoculated with each cytokine producer was prolonged compared with that of the mica injected with parent cells. Moreover, intrapentoneal injection of the ratrov~rus bearing IL-2 gene into the mice which had parent cells tn the pentoneal cavity prolonged the survival of the mice,suggesting successful zn wvo transductlon.Conclusion. Local cytokme production from pancreatic cancer ceils can induce immune rasponce even in a T cell deficient state, and this provides a possible therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancers. Adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic ducts is to the fifth leading cause of cancer death in both U.S. and Japan. Development of the disease is clinically silent so that at the time of the diagnosis, the vast maionty of cases are incurable with a very poor prognosis. Thus, the detection of etiological factors in the environment offer the hopes for the prevention of this deadly disease. Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) are mutagens isolated from cooked foods and their carcinogenic=ties were extensively studied in mice and rats. However, so far no studies have been done in hamsters. Recently, we established a rap~d production model for pancreatic duct adenocarcmomas in hamsters based on the principle of the resmtance of carc:nogen m=tlatad cells to the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of carcinogens originally reported for rat liver carcinogenesis and this model is useful for studying not only the mechamsms underlying duct carcinogenesis but also for the detection of imtiators or promoters for the carcinogenesis, in the present experiments, we studied the 6 HCAs of PhlP, MelQx. IQ, Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2 and A~C which were given in the diets after the in=tmtJon and selection procedure when pancreatic duct cell hyperplasias were developed for 50 and 70 days. For 50 days administration of 0.02% Trp-P-1 increased the total numbers of ductal lesions including hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasm and intraductal or ~nvaswe carcinomas and for 70 days administration, the ~nc=dence of carcinomas increased to 67% as it was compared 330/=n hamsters without receiving Trp-P-l. Furthermore. Trp-P-t was given intragastncally at a concentration of 100 mg/kg body we~gnt as the imttator instead of BOP increased BrdU labeling index ~n pancreatic duct epithelial cells. Ohter HCAs did not show any effects on duct carcinogenesis. These results suggest that Trp-P-1 may be the initiator and promoter for pancreatic duct carcinogenesis =n hamsters and full carcmogemc=ty study wdl be further required. Introduction. The activation of trypsinogens('l'AP) and pancreatic type 1 prophosholipase A2(PROP) have been reported in severe pancreatitis patients. Tap assays for released trypsinogen activation peptides are an accurate early indicator of severity in acute pancreatitis. Subjects and methods. We measured TAP and PROP concentrations in plasma from 22 acute pancreatitis(AP) patients(severe 9, moderate 13), moderate chronic pancreatitis(CP) patients and 10 healthy adult controls.
