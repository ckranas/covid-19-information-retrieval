In order to develop a practical method for the synthesis of L-10 Bpa, we have recently examined the enantioselective method utilizing the Negishi reaction based on the coupling of 4-( 10 B)boronoiodobenzene derivative with 3-iodo-L-alanine derivative (2) . From the standpoint of diagnosis of cancers, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is noted as one of common techniques. In particular, MRI based on the measurement of 19 F atom is becoming a remarkable one. To create practical materials utilizing as not only the 10B carrier but also MRI probe, we had already synthesized the compounds containing both 10 B and 19 F atoms in a single molecule such as - [4-( 10 B)borono-2,6-difl uorophenyl]-DL-alanine [DL-10 Bpa(2,6F 2 )] 3., - [4-( 10 ",

In addition, its torsion angle is commonly found either in the right-handed 3 10 -/helical region (-30 \u00f7 -50, or cis' conformation) or in the left-handed, semiextended, region [-150 \u00b110, or trans', or poly-(L-Pro) n conformation]. Methylation at the C -position of a Pro residue was suggested to block the preceding tertiary amide ( ) torsion angle of the resulting ( Me)Pro to the trans disposition and to restrict the , surface to the single region where the 3 10 / -helices are found. We have synthesized a large set of N -blocked, ( Me)Pro-containing, dipeptide N'alkylamides having the general formulas P-D-( Me)Pro-Xxx-NHiPr and P-Xxx-D-( Me)Pro-NHiPr, where P is Ac or Boc and Xxx is D-Ala, L-Ala, Aib, Gly, D-( Me)Pro, or L-( Me)Pro. The results of the present X-ray diffraction analysis clearly show that the region of the conformational map overwhelmingly preferred by ( Me)Pro is indeed that typical of 3 10 / -helices, but the semi-extended, type-II poly(Pro) n helical region can exceptionally be explored by this extremely sterically demanding C -tetrasubstituted -amino acid. In addition, the known high propensity for -turn formation of the Pro residue is even enhanced in peptides based on its C -methylated derivative. To complete the picture of the preferred conformation of ( Me)Pro, the synthesis and crystal-state investigation of a series of terminallyprotected homo-peptides from D-( Me)Pro are currently in progress in our laboratory",

Five-member cyclic N-amidinoamino acids represent hybrid structures, combining both proline rigidity and high positive charge of arginine guanidine group. Structurally similar N-amidino-proline, N-amidino-pyroglutamic acid and cyclocreatine (2imino-1-imidazolidine acetic acid) were chosen as objects of our study. The problem of their incorporation into peptide structure requires use of substituted derivatives or effective guanidylation technique. Recently we have presented the synthesis of Mts-protected N-amidinoproline. Nevertheless, its application in N-termini modifi cation of peptides shows slow condensation rate in classical as well as solid phase synthesis for short peptides (2-5 residues) or completely fails in case of longer ones (10 residues). On the other hand, polymer supported guanidylation of proline by bis-Boc-protected carboxamidine-1Hbenzotriazole seems to be preferred route to N-amidino-proline containing peptides. Three methods of N-amidino-pyroglutamic acid synthesis have been investigated and model dipeptide has been acquired on Wang polymer by the cyclization of guanidine-glutamic acid. For selective Boc-deprotection on Wang resin the literature technique has been utilized. However, in this case ESI-MS and NMR analyses evidence for side-reaction of triethylamine alkylation by polymer linker fragment. HPLC analysis shows N-amidino-pyroglutamyl-phenylalanine stability at acidic and physiological pH but fast ring opening in water solution at pH 9. For cyclocreatine application in peptide synthesis we suggest the use of its p-toluenesulfonate having good solubility in DMF and showing effective coupling in Cl-HOBt/DIC condensation. The examples of Namidino-amino acids practical application in peptide synthesis will be presented.",

Cyclic analogues of tryptophan which introduce local constraints and reduce the fl exibility of the indol moiety are very valuable tools to probe the bioactive conformation of the peptide ligands. One of the possibilities to freeze indol moiety of tryptophan is the synthesis of the additional 6-member ring by the formation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro--carbolines. We report the synthesis of 1,3-disubstituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro--carbolines via the Pictet-Spengler reaction. Methyl ester of tryptophan or dipeptides with N-terminal Trp (Trp-Ala-OMe, Trp-Leu-OMe) were used as arylethylamine substrates and -amino aldehydes derived from L and D-amino acids were used as carbonyl components. We determined that there were no differences of the stereoselectivity of the Pictet-Spengler reactions in the case of Trp-OMe or Trp-dipeptides. We also investigated the conformation of the newly created 6-membered ring in cis and trans diastereomers. The ROESY spectra were used to assign the more stable conformation for each isomer. The conformations of cis isomers derived from tryptophan and dipeptides were the same and substituents on C-1 and C-3 were in both cases equatorial. The conformation of trans isomers were depended on the carboxyl part of Trp. For methyl ester of tryptophan the ester group was axial, whereas for dipeptides we observed the opposite conformation with equatorial substituent on C-3. Our results show that the Pictet-Spengler reaction can be successfully performed for amino acids and peptides and the conformation of the newly created 6-membered ring depends on the substrates and the size of C-1 and C-3 substituents.",

Recently we have reported that the helical-screw sense of oligopeptides can be controlled without a chiral center on the peptide-backbone but by chiral centers at the side chain. That is to say, we designed and synthesized an optically active cyclic , -disubstituted amino acid (S,S)-Ac(5)c(dOM), in which the -carbon atom is not a chiral center but chiral centers exist at the side chain. Conformational analysis of the (S,S)-Ac(5)c(dOM) peptides revealed that the hexapetide formed left-handed 3 10 -helices both in solution and in the solid state, and the octapeptide assumed a left-handed -helix. Herein we designed new two diastereoisomeric cyclic , -disubstituted amino acids; (1S,3S)-and (1R,3S)-1-amino-3-(methoxy)cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Ac(5)c(OM)) having chiral centers both at the -carbon atom and at the side chain. The amino acids (1S,3S)-and (1R,3S)-Ac(5)c(OM) were synthesized starting from L-(-)-malic acid. That is to say, at fi rst, the malic acid was converted to diiodide compound, and bisalkylation of dimethyl malonate with the diiodide gave a cyclic diester. Monohydrolysis of the diester, followed by Curtius rearrangement produced separable mixtures of (1S,3S)-and (1R,3S)-Ac(5)c(OM). We prepared both diastereoisomeric (1S,3S)-and (1R,3S)-homooligomers by solution-phase methods, respectively, and studied their preferred secondary structures using 1 H NMR, FT-IR, CD and X-ray crystallographic analysis.

For PC obtaining, the synthesis of the monomer, 1azabicyclo[4.2.0]octane, (C), was carried out by organic methods which then will be used in polymer synthesis [1] [2] . Consequently, polymers having different molecular weights and their water soluble bioconjugates were synthesized and the characterization of these polymers and conjugates were done by different methods such as UV, ATR FT-IR, SEC with four detectors and Zeta Sizer. For the chemical modifi cation of PC, bromoacetic acid was used and a water soluble polyampholyte synthesis was achieved with the quaternization of polymer. ATR FT-IR spectra of PC was recorded and molecular weights, polidispersity values of polymers, Mark-Houwink constants and molecular diameters of the polymers were measured with size-exclusion chromatography with four-detectors (light-scattering, refractive index, viscosity and UV). With Zeta Sizer, size-analysis of polymer chains were done and their zeta potentials were measured. It is determined that molecular weights of the polymers were affected by the change in the amount and the type of initiators used and also from the polymerization media. Analysing of having biodegradable characteristics of the synthesized polymers has been being reviewed. After synthesis and modifi cation of PC, its conjugates with antigenic peptides like Avian Infl uenza Hemagglutinin (HA 98-106) YPYDVPDYA and RGDSGGC cell receptor peptide were obtained.

In addition, these peptides clearly adopted monomer state with a random coil structure, which were verifi ed by various physicochemical assays.

Both selfassembly and conformational change of the produced A 1-42 in situ were observed with time. Similarly, the photo-triggered click peptide afforded A 1-42 by UV-irradiation.

We will report that Chiral 2-trifl uoromethyl-1,3oxazolidines (Fox) are highly versatile synthons for the stereoselective synthesis of various functionalized -trifl uoromethylamino compounds such as -amino nitriles , -and -amino acids, diamines and amino alcohols. 1, 2 Moreover, trifl uoropyruvate-based oxazolidines proved to be very valuable building blocks for the stereoselective synthesis of both enantiomers of -trifl uoromethyl proline and -Tfm-pyroglutamic acid, in enantiopure form. 3 Moreover, the synthesis of the (S)--Tfm--allylglycine and the novel (S)--Tfm norvaline were achieved in a few steps from this starting material. We will also report a recent straightforward synthetic route to Tfm-dihydroxyprolines in enantiopure form from trifl uoropyruvate-based chiral oxazolidines. Chitinases catalyse the hydrolysis of chitin, the natural homopolymer of (1,4)-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Chitin is a key structural component of the cell walls, exoskeletons, and eggshells of pathogenic fungi, insects, and nematodes, respectively, which all rely on the ability to hydrolyse chitin at specifi c points in their life cycles. Chitinase inhibitors are now attracting considerable interest as novel fungicides and insecticides, as well as chemical tools to study human diseases as diverse as asthma and malaria. In this context, the cyclic pentapeptide natural products, argifi n and argadin, are two exciting inhibitors which pose some interesting synthetic challenges. The argifi n structure includes two sensitive -linked Asp residues, as well as an unusual carbamoylated Arg side chain, while argadin contains a unique Aspsemialdehyde residue, that is cyclised to the peptide backbone to generate a potentially labile hemiaminal. We will describe improved routes to both compounds that allow us to avoid signifi cant side reactions such as aspartimide formation and homoserine-mediated backbone cleavage that are observed in our previously reported syntheses. [1, 2] This is achieved by carrying out the assembly and cyclisation of both peptides, including key side chain derivatisation steps, entirely on solid phase. The application of the strategies devised to the automated synthesis of argifi n and argadin and related natural products will be described. During the last two decades combinatorial chemistry has become an important tool for the quick synthesis of large numbers of small molecules used, for example, in the generation of the new lead structures for medicinal applications. Additionally, it allows rapid access to diverse chemical libraries with novel structures and properties. Small molecules libraries are generally prepared on solid support simplifying tedious purifi cation steps of the intermediates and facilitating the entire synthesis. Piperazines and keto-piperazines are amongst the important backbones in today's drug discovery. The piperazine framework has been defi ned in medicinal chemistry as a \"privileged scaffold\". It is a molecular backbone with versatile affi nity properties representing a frequently-occurring binding motif, and providing potent and selective ligands for a wide range of biological targets. The high number of positive hits revealed in biological screens with the piperazine scaffold urged chemists to develop plenty of different synthetic methods that allow fast and effi cient building of these heterocyclic systems on solid support as well as homogenous chemistry. However, the majority of these methodologies is not stereospecifi c and the complex mixtures of the stereoisomers are generated. In order to preserve important chiral centers in potential hits we propose to use pipearzine backbone, initially prepared in optically pure form, bearing various tethers with orthogonally protected groups applicable via Solid Phase Organic Chemistry (SPOC). We will describe a novel synthesis of keto and diketopiperazine building blocks. These chiral building blocks are applied in \"around-the-scaffold\" modifi cation strategy by SPOC, introducing valuable physico-chemical properties in 3 independent diversity points. Solid-phase strategies for constraining peptide structures can serve for elucidating the relationships between conformation and activity. For example, the systematic substitution of natural amino acids by their aza-amino acid counterparts has been accomplished using a Fmoc strategy featuring couplings with aza-amino acid chlorides to provide insight into the biologically active conformers of the melanocortin receptor agonist Ac-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH2 as well as the calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonist [D31, P34, F35]CGRP27-37 (1) (2) (3) .",

Nowadays, almost all peptide bond formed are carried out in the presence of 1hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) or its derivatives (HOAt, Cl-HOBt). Thus, HOBt derivatives are used in combination with a carbodiimide or another coupling agent or built into a standalone reagent such as immonium ( Thus, a replacement of HOBt should be found for preparation of peptides for research purposes and, more important, for the production of peptide based APIs. Herein, several alternatives to HOBt will be discussed taking into account the explosivity properties. Furthermore, a new family of immonium salts, which incorporates an proton acceptor in its carbocation skeleton. The novel proton acceptor coupling reagent has shown superiority to the described previously. An oxygen in the carbocation moiety confers to the reagent more solubility, enhances coupling yields and decreases racemization, allowing the use of just one equivalent of base.

Native chemical ligation (NCL) (1), Staudinger ligation (2) lead to the formation of a native peptide bond at the ligation site. Other methods result in the formation of unnatural covalent bonds such as oxime (3), thioester (4) linkages. These methods are of great interest when native peptide bonds are not absolutely required. In this context, we examined the potential use of the phenylthiocarbamate group in ligation chemistry. The phenylthiocarbonyl group can be easily introduced into peptides on alpha or epsilon amino group using phenylthiochloroformate and standard solid-phase method (5) . It reacts chemoselectively with cysteinyl peptides to give an alkylthiocarbamate bond. S,N-shift of the alkylaminocarbonyl group from the Cys side chain to the alpha-amino group did not occur. The method was used for linking two peptides chain through their N-termini, for the synthesis of a cyclic peptide or for the synthesis of di-or tetravalent multiple antigenic peptides. Synthetic peptide derivatives which contain secondary amide moiety at C-terminus are inhibitors of serine and cysteine proteinases and thus could be effi ciently used as ligands in affi nity chromatography in order to isolate these enzymes. There is a number of chemical syntheses of amidous peptide derivatives in the literature, but the reaction yields are usually low and reaction conditions and purifi cation procedures are too complicated. It is also known that the application of enzymatic catalysis allows to obtain high reaction yields with simultaneous simplifi cation of synthetic and purifi cation procedures, and at the same time preserves the optical purity of target compound. Subtilisin 72 sorbed on silochrome could be effi ciently used as catalyst of acylation of secondary amides by the esters of acylpeptides. Subtilisin's wide substrate specifi city allows to carry out the syntheses with peptides which contain hydrophilic, hydrophobic, dicarbonic-and diamino-acids at C-terminus. Piperidine, morpholine, indole, diethylamine and other secondary amines are used in the syntheses as the amino-components. The reaction yield equals about 60-80% in dependence of the nature of C-terminal amino acid of acylating peptide, pKa of amine and the hydrophobicity of the fi nal compound. The distribution of the reaction product in liquid and solid reaction phases is investigated, the optimal reaction conditions for enzymatic acylation of secondary amines are established. All the compounds obtained are characterized by its NMR and mass spectra. The inhibition constants for some proteolytic enzymes with the compounds of research are defi ned. 1 ",

In particular, arylhistidines naturally occur in the active site of the heme-copper oxidases as well as in cytotoxic and antifungal marine peptides (1) . A method of choice for the preparation of unsymmetrical biaryl systems is the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of an aryl halide with an arylboronic acid. It has been shown that microwaves signifi cantly enhance this reaction leading to higher overall yields and purities as well as shorter reaction times. Although a great variety of biarylic compounds have been prepared following this approach, so far, it has not been applied to the arylation of the histidine imidazole ring. Initially, we studied a methodology for the synthesis of 5-arylhistidines via a microwave-assisted Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction in solution (2) . Taking into account the advantages of the synthesis on solid support, such as the avoidance of tedious work-up which are particularly valuable for palladium-catalyzed reactions, we studied the application of the above methodology on solid-phase. Here, we report the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction between a 5-bromohistidine and an arylboronic acid on solid support. The reaction conditions were optimized by varying several parameters such as the solvent, the reagent concentrations and the reaction time. The optimized conditions were subsequently applied to the synthesis of peptides containing a 5-arylhistidine residue. This work constitutes the fi rst Suzuki-Miyaura coupling involving the imidazole ring of a histidine on solid support. ",

In the last decade an increasing interest in -branched dehydroamino acids has been developed based on their importance as commodity chemicals and value as tools in structure relationship studies. The incorporation into a peptide of such unsaturated amino acids introduces an element of conformational rigidity, as well as changes in reactivity, allowing for the development of high affi nity ligands for receptors. A variety of methods exist for the synthesis of dehydroamino acids. Some of these approaches rely on thermodynamic control to dictate the alkene geometry. If there is no strong thermodynamic preference, or if the desired product is not the thermodynamically favoured isomer, the existing synthetic methods are often ineffective. We describe here an effi cient stereoselective method for the synthesis of , -branched dehydroamino acids (III) from -aryldehydroamino acids (I). The -aryldehydroamino acids (I) were prepared from commercially available Z/Boc-phosphonoglycine trimethylester and aldehydes using the Schmidt protocol. The transformation of (I) into their -bromodehydroamino acid derivatives (II) is performed by a Hoerrner reaction in a very good yield giving the Trans derivatives. Suzuki cross-coupling on (II) with a boronic derivative generated the high value building blocks (III). A variety of side chains can be incorporated using this type of reaction. The stereochemistry of these compounds has been determined using NOE enhancement experiments.

The task of making a turn mimetic can be regarded from the perspective of the backbone dihedral angles -to make a beta turn mimetic the phi and psi angles of two consecutive residues have to be controlled. Limiting the dihedral angle space is most effectively accomplished with a cyclic constraint -one or more may be used. In this case a single medium ring cyclisation from the (i) carbonyl to the (i+3) amine -in place of the classical hydrogen bond -forces the four backbone dihedral angles into a turn conformation. Due to the polyfunctional nature of peptide systems the introduction of unnatural constraints can be synthetically challenging. In the present case a number of side reactions were encountered and had to be overcome. Some were well known such as diketopiperazine formation and others involving transannular interactions were unexpected and gave rise to interesting byproducts. Ultimately the side reactions were overcome by choice of cyclisation position and synthetic modifi cations.",

So, antimicrobial peptides, both synthetic and from natural sources, have raised interest as potential useful drugs in the future. However, due to proteolytic degradation, peptides are not ideal candidates for pharmaceutical development. That is why numerous researches try to develop non natural peptidic analogues for enhancing metabolic stability, bioavailability, and biological absorption. In this class of peptidomimetics, pseudopeptides consisting exclusively or including aza 3 -amino acids have emerged as a promising new class of compounds that favour hydrogen bond formation and can enhance biological activities when compared to natural parent peptides (1) . We have designed \"mixed\" cylic pseudopeptides composed of -and aza- 3 -amino acids that target bacterial cell wall and induce the death of the pathogens. Particularly, some of these cyclic pseudopeptides have broad spectrum antibactericidal activities on gram positive and gram negative bacteria with low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). On the other hand, this type of molecules is not haemolytic and cytotoxic at antimicrobial activity levels(2) Now, we try to explain the mechanism of action of our pseudopeptides that act on the microbial membranes. With NMR studies we have demonstrate that in solution cycles auto-associate at high concentrations and we investigate their behaviour in presence of small unilamellar lipidic vesicules (SUV) (3) . This phenomenon of auto association seems to be facilitated at the lipid interface. ",

We are currently expanding this fi eld by synthesizing and studying the properties of new sets of peptido2.rotaxanes. The initial set examined includes symmetrical, achiral compounds with a Fmoc stopper at each terminus, threads built up with a central fumaric diamide station and two helical Aib ( -aminoisobutyric acid) homo-peptides of different lengths (from 1 to 5 residues), and an aromatic tetramide macrocycle. These supramolecular systems have been characterized spectroscopically and two of them by X-ray diffraction as well. The fundamental interactions between macrocycle and thread (the same interactions offering the major contribution to the template-directed preparation of this family of molecules) are intercomponent H-bonds comprising the four amide groups in the ring and the two amide bonds in the fumaric derivative. The second, more complex, set of peptido2.rotaxanes examined is represented by non-symmetrical compounds involving a thread based on a central helical -(Aib) 6 -peptide linker and two stations of opposite chirality (a -D-Leu-Gly-Gly-tripeptide at the N-terminus and a fumaric diamide-L-Leu moiety at the C-terminus). As stoppers and the macrocycle, we selected two diphenylacetyl groups and the usual aromatic tetramide, respectively. As spectroscopically assessed, the macrocycle initially positions on the fumaric diamide-L-Leu station. Subsequently, by using photons as stimuli to induce the fumaric<->maleic equilibrium, we were able to switch partially the relative macrocyclebinding affi nity in favor of the -D-Leu-Gly-Gly-tripeptide station. This is the fi rst example of a rotaxane where the ring makes a journey to one of the stations by wrapping up around a helical peptide thread.",

Herein, the title bis peptides A and B were suggested and synthesized as new prototype candidates of such class compounds. Pre-assembled and purifi ed peptides via the conventional methods of peptide synthesis are, subsequently, coupled to either 1,2,4,5-benzene tetra-carboxylic dianhydride or 1,4,5,8-naphthalene tetra-carboxylic dianhydride. The expected structures of obtained A and B as preliminary candidates were confi rmed via the chemical, chromatographic and spectroscopic methodologies.

X = phenyl or bi-phenyl ring [compound A and B respectivel 63 the fragment PTH(1-34) is suffi cient to bind and activate the PTH type I receptor (PTH1R). The molecular mechanisms by which PTH binds to and activates the PTH1R have been extensively investigated. Recent investigations focusing on the interaction of N-terminal modifi ed fragments PTH(1-11)NH2 with PTH1R showed that certain modifi cations can increase signalling potency and that enhancement of the -helicity in the PTH(1-11) sequence yielded potent analogues of PTH(1-11)NH2. The design of cyclic analogues represents a widely used strategy to increase peptide stability and potency. The structural constraint induced by cyclization reduces conformational fl exibility and may enhance potency, selectivity, stability and bioavailability as well as membrane barrier permeability. Initially, the work was concentrated on conformational constrains in N-terminal such as the introduction of Ctetra-substituted amino acids. Global restrictions in the conformation of a peptide are possible by limiting the fl exibility of the peptide strand through cyclization. To this purpose, the amino acid side chains that are not involved in receptor recognition are connected together or with the peptide backbone. Previous works on the role of side chains of AA determined through D-scan, analogues which maintained better -helical structure, contained D-Gln in position 6 and 10. Recently Gardella and co-workers reported that an analogues of PTH(1-11) cyclized between 6 and 10 residues exhibited almost the same activity of linear analogues. So, in this work two new potent cyclic analogues in position 6 and 10 were synthesized directly on SPPS, using side chains of Lys and Glu or Ser.

It has been shown in vivo that the Ab 82D6A3 has an antitrombotic effect without showing the bleeding complications that known antitrombotics exhibit. This makes the Ab an attractive lead for antithrombotic drug design.

Incorporation of the functional groups of the amino acids and fi xation of the secondary structure of the paratope will be the aim in the design of the paratope mimetics. With this rational design we will try to develop an orally available, synthetic paratope peptidomimetic with the same antitrombotic effect as the antibody. The development (solid phase and solution peptide synthesis) of the mimetics is a stepwise process. In each step conformational restrictions are introduced.

Backbone cyclization can help to stabilize these ligands against proteolytic degradation and to form their bioactive conformation. Till now backbone cyclization was performed with bifunctional and in few cases with trifunctional amino acids but not with phosphotyrosine. The assembly of such peptides requires preformed building units. Because the necessary reductive alkylation of phosphotyrosine derivatives leads only to very low yields we used N-functionalized pseudodipeptides with the unprotected phenolic hydroxyl group. For fragment condensation we synthesized building units of the common structures: Fmoc-Aa\u00d8[CO-N(X)-(CH2)n-NH-Alloc)Tyr(OH)-OH and Fmoc-Aa\u00d8[CO-N(CH2)m -COOAll)Tyr(OH)-OH. Depending on the steric hindrancy of the N-terminal amino acid these pseudodipeptides were synthesized in solution or at SASRINresin. They were purifi ed by fl ash chromatography and analytically characterized by HPLC, ESI-MS and NMR. We tested our strategy on the synthesis of an octapeptide-ligand for the N-terminal SH2-domain of the phosphatase SHP-1: Glu-Gly-Leu-Asn/Abu-pTyr-Nle-Asp-Leu-NH2. Couplings of the dipeptide units were performed with PyBOP, stepwise coupling to the peptide fragments with unprotected phenolic hydroxyl group with pentafl uoro phenylesters. After fi nishing the assembly the obtained polymer bound octapeptides were consecutively cyclized, phosphorylated, removed from the resin and purifi ed by HPLC. Based on elucidated side reactions the synthetic strategy was optimized. The obtained backbone cyclic and phosphorylated ligands were tested for their infl uence on the phosphatase activity of SHP-1. The found enzymatic activities are correlated to size, direction, hydrophobicity and conformational fl exibility of the lactam bridges. biology and medicine. In this context, we have devised a new family of compounds named \u00ab Polyamide Amino Acids \u00bb (PAAs), constituted by a PNA (Peptide Nucleic Acids) backbone mimicking RNA sugarphosphate backbone, onto which aminoacid residues are linked. Therefore, these PAAs could constitute a new type of RNA ligands, liable to specifi cally interact with an RNA target through an original interaction mode. To assess the ability of PAAs to be potential RNA binders, we fi rst prepared 8 tetra-PAAs (T1-T8) via solid-phase synthesis, starting from 4 PAA monomers deriving from Alanine, Phenylalanine, Lysine and Arginine residues. Interactions of the 8 tetramers with a HIV-1 TAR RNA fragment, taken as a target model, was investigated by fl uorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. To give insights about specifi city, binding affi nities to TAR were also assessed using an excess of a tRNA mixture. Results showed Kd values varying from 0.08 to 2032 M, indicating the importance of the aminoacid side chains in the interaction. Thermodynamic analyses revealed that even if electrostatic interactions play a part in the complex formation, the binding is enthalpy-driven, highligthing the importance of non-electrostatic interactions in the recognition process. These results are of special interest since RNA/ ligand association specifi city is typically assumed to be due to shortrange non-electrostatic interactions. Moreover, T1-T4 were shown to be specifi c to TAR in the presence of an excess of tRNA. All together, these results are encouraging and they highlight the potential of PAAs as RNA ligands. Indeed, the use of only four PAA monomers as building blocks leads to tetra-PAAs displaying both affi nity and specifi city for their RNA target.",

Furthermore, it is well established that APA substrate specifi city and enzymatic activity are calcium dependent. In order to render this model more accurate and so on to identify the amino acids residues involved in calcium binding, we have designed new inhibitors able to explore the APA S1 subsite to better understand its specifi city. We will report the synthesis of these new inhibitors, as well as an inversion of the specifi city of APA S1 subsite in absence of calcium. These results and the identifi cation of the amino acids implicated in calcium binding will be discussed on the basis of site-directed mutagenesis studies.

A colour test, which indicates the presence or absence of a functional group by visual detection, is a simple, practical tool to monitor the completeness of the reaction. Although the variety of colour tests for amines, there is still a need for a reliable and sensitive test in some synthetic approaches. Here, we wish to report a new simple, fast and sensitive colorimetric assay for the visual detection of solid-phase bound primary, secondary amines and solid-phase bound thiol groups using 1-alkyl-2-aryl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidinium salts. In the search for a new synthetic approach to polysubstituted 2-aminoimidazoles (1), we have reported a new procedure, employing substituted 2-aminopyrimidines and -bromocarbonyl compounds. The intermediate imidazo [1,2a] pyrimidinium salts in the synthesis of substituted 2-aminoimidazoles appeared to give a strong colour when reacted with primary and secondary amines. Due to the strong colour change of amino functionalised resins after reaction with the \"DESC\" reagent (2), a protocol for the detection of resin bound primary and secondary amines has been developed. The \"DESC\" test is a new, practically, simple, quick and reliable test for the visual detection of resin bound primary and secondary amines in a sensitive way. The \"DESC\" reagent is accessible from the cheap starting materials and can be prepared in two steps. Tetrafl uoroborates of chiral N-triazinylammonium salts were found stable and useful in enantioselective (ee up to 98%) peptide synthesis from racemic amino acids in solution. Several chiral N-triazinylammonium tetrafl uoroborates were obtained as stable L and/or D selective coupling reagents (1) . Broad range of common amines (strychnine, brucine, sparteine etc.) were found useful as a chiral auxiliary, opening access to amino acids of both required confi gurations. We have attempted to expand the scope of application of this family of reagents expecting their effi ciency in enantiodifferentiating reactions in solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). Tetrafl uoroborates of chiral N-triazinylammonium salts were obtained by treatment 2-chloro-4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazine with tetrafl uoroborates of appropriate tertiary amines in the presence of sodium bicarbonate (2) . Enantiodifferentiating reagents were used in synthesis on Wang resin under classic condition for triazine based coupling reagents (3) . The most important advantage of application of chiral N-triazinylammonium tetrafl uoroborates is the predictability of confi guration and repeatability of enantiomeric purity of incorporated amino acid.

Azaamino acid residues conserve the pharmacophores necessary for biological activity while inducing conformational changes and increased resistance to proteolitic degradation. These properties make azapeptides an attractive tool for structure-activity relationship studies and drug design. A general approach for solid phase synthesis of azapeptides has been developed based on the in-situ activation of N-2-(3,5dimethoxyphenyl)propan-2-yloxycarbonyl (Ddz), N \u20ac\u2122-substituted hydrazines, with phosgene, followed by introduction to N-terminus of resin-bound peptide. The Ddz-aza-amino building units include aliphatic, aromatic and functionalized side chains, protected for synthesis by the Fmoc strategy. Solid-phase azapeptide synthesis is demonstrated including selective mild deprotection of Ddz with Mg(ClO 4 ) 2 and coupling of the next amino acid with triphosgene. The mild Ddz deprotection is also orthogonal with Boc chemistry. We describe the synthesis of N \u20ac\u2122-substituted Ddz protected hydrazines which have wide applications in the synthesis of azapeptides as well as in general synthesis of substituted hydrazines and aza containing peptidomimetics. Ddz protected hydrazines offer the possibility to construct novel and unique drug-candidate structures such as branched and cyclic azapeptides.",

This method provides the successful synthesis of variety amides and dipeptides without preliminary protection of alfa-NH2 group of Lamino acids. The supposed mechanism displays the formation of Nphospholane carboxyanhydride (1-oxy-3-aza-2-phospholane-5-one), or an O-hydroxypropyl H-phosphonate salt of an amide of L-Phe. The Nphospholane carboxyanhydride is protected at the N-terminus, as well as is activated at the C-terminus. This pathway favors the desired reaction with a variety of nucleophiles from the N-to C-terminus. This method also allows the synthesis of different esters of amino acids employing alcohols as nucleophiles previously described by us (1). Formation of disulfi de bonds in synthetic peptides is one of the more challenging transformations to achieve in peptide chemistry, in view of possible formation of oligomeric by-products and other side reactions, as well as occasional solubility problems in aqueous oxidizing media. The recently introduced polymer-supported oxidant, CLEAR-OX\u2122, has proven to be a very valuable tool in the preparation of disulfi de-bridged peptides. [1, 2] Oxidations using CLEAR-OX were carried out at pH ranging from 4 to 7 in water/acetonitrile solutions, with concentrations 10-15 times higher than comparable solution oxidations. The latest progress in the preparation of various monocyclic and bicyclic peptides will be presented. The amyloid -peptide (A ) is believed to play a causal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the hypotheses of A neurotoxicity is that it induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) formation by binding to metals such as copper and iron. It is hypothesized that the sole tyrosine residue plays an important role in A -mediated toxicity, due to its ability to form a dityrosine cross-link from tyrosyl radicals generated in the highly oxidative environment in the brain. Hence, studies of the dityrosine cross-linked A peptide dimers would increase our understanding of the oxidative alteration and dimerisation of A in amyloid formation and AD related neurodegeneration. We are investigating the synthesis of the A peptide dimers containing the dityrosine cross-link. Dityrosine, suitably protected for solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), has been prepared from iodotyrosine using a Miyaura borylation-Suzuki coupling method. Studies on the synthesis of dityrosine-linked peptide dimers through incorporation of dityrosine in SPPS are underway. Initial model studies employing 2,6-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) have validated this approach. Preparation of the model DAPlinked A peptide dimers will be discussed, as well as progress towards the dityrosine-linked A peptide dimers.",

This transformation was further explored and developed, leading to several reactions of highly synthetic importance. Traceless Staudinger ligation is one example of such modifi cations, in which an ester moiety is placed within the phosphine structure to capture the nucleophilic aza-ylide, by intramolecular cyclization, leading to a stable amide bond. While the aza-ylide intermediate is known to be stable in organic solvents, it tends to hydrolyze rapidly under aqueous media to furnish the primary amine product. In the traceless Staudinger ligation, however, the reduction of the azide to amine is a competing side reaction, as it would reverse the capture step leading to two peptide fragments. We have found that such reduction step would be benefi cial if an electrophile and an azide (rather than the phosphine) are placed within the switch peptide system. Investigating various reducing reagents led us to the discovery that tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) is excellent azide reducing reagent. Both the reduction and the acyl transfer steps are rapid and occur in a few minutes. Applying the TCEP-mediated triggering in switch peptides, derived from the A to understand the currently unclear processes of pathological folding, self-assembly, and aggregation of amyloid peptide will also be reported.",

            "text": "Fast Fmoc-deprotection reagent for peptide synthesis Diffi cult sequences have long been known in solid phase peptide synthesis, theses sequences can experience sever aggregation both during synthesis and under purifi cation. The aggregation is believed to depend mainly on -sheet formation or/ and hydrophobic properties of the peptide. Now a days there are several strategies to circumvent theses problems, one of the most successful is to incorporate a backbone protective group as the Hmb group, develop by Johnson and co-worker(1), and thereby prevent aggregation due to -sheet formation. An additional charge will increase the solubility of peptides towards aqueous solutions and thereby facilitate the purifi cation by HPLC (using acetonitrile and water system) and analysis (by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer) of the peptide. Here we present the Nmec (N-methyl-N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl] carbamoyl) group(2) that is a orthogonal protective group for tyrosine side chain and the hydroxyl moiety of the Hmb group. The Nmec group is Fmoc compatible and is protected during the synthesis with a Boc group. The fi nal cleavage from the resin with TFA renders the amine of the Nmec group protonated and will increase the solubility of the peptide during purifi cation and analysis. The Nmec group can be easily removed with a mild alkaline treatment by a cyclization elimination reaction. The Nmec group has been employed in the synthesis of diffi cult and hydrophobic peptides as the membrane spanning sequence of the calciton receptor, amyloid (25-35) and amyloid (1-42) with success. [3, 4] . For example, Infl uenza A virus-related peptide (H-GILGFVFTL-H) with a diffi cult sequence was synthesized using O-acyl isodipeptide unit. Analysis of the crude peptide revealed high purity of the product with no by-product derived from the diffi cult sequence or epimerization. Using CH 2 Cl 2 as solvent in coupling the isodipeptide unit, A 1-42 was also synthesized with almost no major side reaction 5.. Racemization-free segment condensation method was developed by employing N-segments possessing a C-terminal urethane-protected O-acyl Ser/Thr residues 6.. The synthesis of long peptides/proteins by racemization-free segment condensation has thus become possible at Ser/Thr residues and not only C-terminal Gly/Pro residues. Growing interest to peptide substrates, inhibitors and other peptidomimetics required new highly effective synthetic techniques. The important goal of enzymatic peptide bond formation is the optical purity of the peptide, which facilitates the product isolation. Thus using enzymatic condensation as a last step in peptidomimetics production is preferable. Fixing of enzymes on/in suitable insoluble supports has many advantages: high operational stability, ease of separation, possibility of recycling and improved activity in low water media. Chitosan, natural hydrophilic polysaccharide, was used as a matrix as it has distinct advantages over the other supports due to (a) its renewable nature -it is available in large quantities as a waste product from fi shing industry and (b) its excellent fi lm-forming ability, allowing attachment to reactor walls for advanced processing. Serine proteases subtilisin and chymotrypsin, and cysteine protease papain were immobilized onto chitosan. The fi lms of biocatalysts were prepared by drying the mixed solution of chitosan and enzyme in acetate buffer pH 5.6. Treatment with glutaraldehyde was found to give material with high stability and good mechanical properties. The obtained biocomposites showed high amidase activity against specifi c chromogenic peptide substrates and protein substrate azacasein. Immobilized subtilisin and chymotrypsin also possess esterase activity against p-nitrophenyl acetate. The longterm storage in aqueous buffer and acetonitrile had a little effect on the hydrolytic activity of subtilisin-based biocomposite. The dependence of subtilisin/chitosan hydrolytic activity on temperature and pH was studied. Obtained samples possessed high synthetic activity and were capable to catalyze peptide bond formation in DMFA/MeCN mixture in reaction ZAALOMe+FpNA ZAALFpNA for subtilisin, ZAAOMe+LpNA ZAALpNA for papain. The product yield reached 60-100% in 24 h.

(1) A C-terminal peptide thioester reacts with an N-terminal cysteine. The requirement for this rare amino acid represents the major bottle neck to the synthesis of native proteins. Several strategies have been developed to overcome this limitation. In the extended ligation, N-terminally attached auxiliaries allow access to other ligation junctions by mimicking the cysteine-thiol moiety. The ligation-desulfurization approach employs -thiol amino acids for fragment coupling followed by sulphur removal. Herein, cysteine acts as precursor of the abundant alanine(2) and phenylalanine can be obtained by using its -mercapto derivative. (3) . We demonstrate the application of penicillamine in the generation of valine junctions employing the ligation-desulfurization approach. The , -dimethylcysteine building block is commercially available with various protecting group patterns suitable for routine solid phase synthesis of peptides. The ligation at penicillamine proceeded surprisingly fast despite the steric demand at the thiol group. Even Leu-Val ligation sites, which appear in hydrophobic peptide segments, are accessible. We also present an improved method for achieving metal-free desulfurization and show applications in the synthesis of valine-containing peptides.(4) References: 1. P. E. Dawson ",

In this work we focused on the elucidation of synthetic strategies for the preparation of multiple disulfi de containing peptide venoms regulating the ion channels of immune cells-Anuroctoxin and Tc32-, and a neuropeptide with regulatory functions-Orexin A. For the synthesis of these naturally occuring Cys-rich peptides we had chosen the oxidative folding being the most simple of the methods available. In the case of anuroctoxin we isolated the native form of the peptide toxin with high selectivity and we optimized the folding conditions, so within an hour the majority of the linear peptide folds in the cyclic form with all four disulfi de bonds in the correct form. The regioselectivity of the isolated isomer was verifi ed with biological measurements. For the synthesis of Orexin A we optimized the folding conditions and, using a polymer-supported oxidant-the Clear-Ox resin-, within two hours we could isolate the correctly folded isomer as the major reaction product. The correct structure was proven by coelution of the isolated isomer and the commercially available Orexin A. But oxidative folding does not always give the correctly folded isomer. The best proof for this is the Tc32 scorpion toxin which albeit our tryings always gave the misfolded isomers if we used the linear, unprotected peptide. Therefore a new chemical synthesis using different side-chain protection needs to be taken into consideration.

There are two main strategies for the synthesis of glycopeptides: the synthon and global (convergent) method. Both of them can be implemented in liquid or solid-phase. Since the glycosylation could appear on O and N atoms of the amino acid side-chain, due to the different reactivity of the glycosidic linkage different chemical strategies will necessitate. In this presentation we compare several chemical strategies for the preparation of two model peptides (Leu-Lys-Asn*-Gly-Gly-Pro, Gly-Val-Glu-Asp-Ile-Ser*-Gly-Leu-Pro-Ser-Gly,*site of glycosylation). As glyco-part several mono, di and trisaccharide including chitobiose, galactosilxilose, mannosil-N-acetyl-glycosil-N-acetyl-glucosamine were used and several of the used strategies led to successful preparation of these glycoconjugates.",

            "text": "Site-specifi c PEGylation of human IgG1-Fab using a rationally designed trypsin variant In the present contribution we report on a novel, highly selective biocatalytic method enabling C-terminal modifi cations of proteins with artifi cial functionalities under native state conditions. The approach is based on the fourfold trypsin variant K60E/N143H/E151H/D189K which was generated by site directed mutagenesis and initially specifi ed in terms of selectivity and activity using a peptide library of the general structure Bz AAX aa X bb X cc AAG-OH. The trypsin variant was found to bear a restricted proteolytic activity towards the rare recognition sequence YRH with an occurance of less than 0.5% in native proteins. The specifi city is zinc ion dependent due to an artifi cial metal binding site in the S2\u00b4-subsite (1). Placing of the recognition sequence at the Cterminal region of respective proteins via standard mutagenesis protocols provides suitable precursor targets for site-specifi c modifi cation via a transamidation reaction. Due to the great demand for polymer-modifi ed antibody fragments for pharmaceutical purposes we evaluated the function of the approach on example of the C-terminal PEGylation (PEG...polyethylene glycol) of the human IgG1 Fab fragment. The fragment itself was expressed with the recognition sequence and an additional Strep-fusion enabling effi cient purifi cation. The derivatization of the antibody fragment with 40 kDa PEG via the trypsin variant (MW ~ 24 kDa) proceeds effi ciently with a total yield of isolated modifi ed protein of 40%. Interestingly, no undesired cleavage reactions could be detected leading to fully active modifi ed antibody fragment. References: 1. Willett, W.S., Brinen, L.S. et al.

This is particularly acute in the case of protein synthesis where the crude product mixture contains capped (acetylated) truncates of comparable size and structure to the protein product. Such a common situation results in extensive, and expensive, purifi cation techniques such as large scale HPLC. To this end we designed a hydrophobic tag, Tbfmoc (2) , which incorporated the base-labile characteristics of the Fmoc (3) group. The Tbfmoc group causes retention on hydrophobic columns and hence separation from untagged impurities. Although this was effective, we were of the opinion that a complementary tag was required which would have the characteristics of metal-complexation and cleavage by -elimination for subsequent removal of the tag from the protein product after IMAC. Considerations implicit in the design of such an N -terminal protecting group, or tag, will be discussed , and applications to the chemical synthesis of chemokines will be dealt with in the presentation. In last few decades, acridines which are known as anticancer, antimicrobal and antiviral agents have been in the center of interest of scientists. The heterocyclic molecules demonstrate a noteworthy group of compounds which interact with biological targets e.g. topoisomerase I, II [1, 2] . We wish to pay our attention to a new group of tuftsin-acridine conjugates. Tuftsin offers a wide range of biological activities such as supporting of immune system, bactericidal, tumoricidal activity. However tuftsin is unstable in plasma which reduces its effi cacy. That is the reason for search of new analogues that were more resistance to proteolysis degradation (3). Tuftsin-acridine conjugates were synthesized using a Fmoc solid phase strategy. The elongation of peptide chain was based on twostep procedure: deprotection and coupling reaction with DIC and the additive of HOBt in DMF/DCM/NMP mixture. Tuftsin analogues were modifi ed at -amino group of lysine via introduction of the simple amino acids to obtain isopeptide bond. Tuftsin analogues were conjugated to the acridine molecule via fl exible linkers. The carboxylic group of linker was connected to N-terminal group of peptide-resin using standard method for amide bond formation. The coupling reaction was performed with peptide-resin and the 4-fold excess of 1-nitro-acridine derivative using TBTU, HOBt in the presence of DIEA in DMF for 24h. Simultaneous deprotection of peptide side chain and cleavage from resin was done with the TFA cocktail. Final products were purifi ed by SPE and characterized by elemental analysis, MS and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. The effect of microwave irradiation under controlled temperature conditions on the solid-phase synthesis of peptides was investigated. For optimization studies a model peptide (H-Gly-Ile-Leu-Thr-Val-Ser-Val-Ala-Val-OH) was selected which suffers from poor synthetic effi ciency under standard SPPS conditions. Synthesis of the nonapeptide was performed using various combinations of solid supports (polysterene, Tentagel, ChemMatrix) and solvents employing Fmoc/But orthogonal protection strategy. Applying controlled microwave heating, the reaction times were signifi cantly reduced while maintaining a high purity of crude product with no racemization being observed. The optimized microwave synthesis method was succesfully applied for longer, aggregated peptides. Microwave coupling and cleveage were accomplished in a dedicated reactor setup that allowed accurate internal reaction temperature measurment using a fi ber-optic probe system. Comparison studies between microwave-and conventionally heated reactions will be presented. During the last few years microwave assisted peptide synthesis has became popular and it was reported to be useful in some cases. There is also an ongoing discussion about an additional \"microwave effect\". Based on this background we have synthesized several model peptides on a microwave synthesizer and compared with the synthesis on conventional batch and continuous fl ow synthesizers with and without microwave irradiation. During this investigation we have also compared reaction rates and purity of the peptides synthesized under the infl uence of microwave irradiation or conventional heating on this different synthesizer systems by various conditions. In no case we can fi nd any additional postulated \"microwave effect\". The results of this investigation will be presented and discussed. Conotoxins form a large family of peptide toxins from cone snail venoms that act on a broad spectrum of ion channels and receptors. The subgroup -conotoxins specifi cally and selectively bind to subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs), which are targets for treatment of several neurological disorders. The aim of this work is to develop an improved method able to generate conotoxins in high yield and purity. This will overcome a key barrier currently preventing the effi cient synthesis of small focused libraries in order to investigate the structureactivity relationship (SARs) of those peptides. The development of general synthetic strategies for the preparation of conotoxins and analogues are essential to effi ciently approach important questions within the area of neurobiology and for the development of novel drugs for treatment of various neurological diseases. A new and highly effi cient synthetic strategy for the synthesis of alpha-Conotoxin-MII has been developed. This strategy combine solid phase synthesis with microwave assisted heating to produce the two disulfi de bonds peptide in high yield and purity. We fi rst report here the use of microwave assistance in order to form a disulfi de loop. This technique demonstrates the advantage of preparing the fi rst disulfi de bridge while the peptides are resin bound. This step is critical to provide the dicyclic native peptide, that was performed by a followed classical in solution oxidation by iodine strategy. An enhanced total procedure for the synthesis of CtxMII is recommended, which can be effi cient applied at several small disulfi de rich peptides of biological importance.",

A variety of common amino acids derivatives and coupling reagents have been studied in order to optimize coupling reactions in water by microwave-assisted heating.

In contrast to mucin-type Oglycan peptides which are present on the membrane of mammalian cells antifreeze glycopeptides (AFGPs) are a little investigated example of glycosylated peptides containing similar components. AFGPs usually consist of a varying number of repeating units of (Ala-Ala-Thr) with minor sequence variations and the threonine hydroxyl oxygen glycosylated with the disaccharide -D-galactosyl-(1-3)--N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. Antifreeze activity has been proven by different experimental observations like suppression of recrystallisation and ice nucleation, thermal hysteresis and change of the crystal habitus. Although it is known that the N-acetyl group at the C2 position of the galactosamine, the -confi gured glycosidic bond to the threonine hydroxyl group and the -methyl group are essential, the adsorption mechanism is not yet understood. (1) . In contrast to fragment condensation, solid phase peptide synthesis gives the possibility to prepare one defi ned product and to introduce structure inducing amino acids such as proline. The disadvantage of SPPS with the bulky glycosylated amino acids is the low coupling effi ciency. This problem was overcome by using more active coupling reagents and microwave-enhanced methods during coupling leading to suffi cient coupling effi ciency without having to apply great excess of the glycosylated amino acid. After purifi cation the peptide structure was examined by CD and NMR in water and DMSO at different temperatures. Additionally, the substances were microphysically analysed according to their recrystalisation inhibition activity and their infl uence on the crystal habitus. Microwave technology applied to SPPS has been recently proposed as valid support to the enhancement of coupling rates. We also used microwave energy in conjugation process between polyelectrolytepeptide bioconjugation with EDC, HBTU. The use of peptide epitops of viruses particles in the composition of polymeric conjugates as vaccine has several potential advantages over whole viral or bacterial preparation.

For autoimmune diseases, we proposed the development of synthetic posttranslational modifi ed peptides as antigenic probes for characterization of specifi c and high affi nity autoantibodies as biomarkers. By an innovative \"Chemical Reverse Approach\" we propose optimisation of antigenic probes by a statistically signifi cant screening of sera guided by autoantibodies circulating in patients' biological fl uids (1) . SPPS via the building block approach is the principal strategy leading to modifi ed peptides. High purity is a condicio sine qua non for effi cient biomarker detection. These syntheses can present several diffi culties as result of internal aggregation of resin-bound peptides during elongation steps, reducing reagents penetration, and signifi cantly decreasing reaction rates in both acylation and deprotection steps. Such events strongly affect purity of the crude peptides and therefore, fi nal yield. We demonstrated that application of microwave (MW) energy in SPPS of modifi ed complex peptide probes exhibits several advantages improving coupling rates, possibly because of the decrease of chain aggregation during the synthesis (2) .

This widespread structural motif is involved in many biological procedures like transcription, scaffolding or signalling. In addition, the most characteristic and important identifying feature of a Coiled-Coil is the recurrence of a periodic heptad repeat sequence. Coiled-Coils are able to form complexes up to heptamers of different orientation. Based on this signifi cant occurrence and also their structure Coiled-Coil peptides have the ability to function as molecular recognition molecules. Our goal is to use self-associating Coiled-Coil sequences as molecular building blocks (Lego brick). The ligation of desired functionalities on Coiled-coil sequences opens up the opportunity to add different functionalities on artifi cial complex peptide molecules that stick together via Coiled-Coil moieties. This makes Coiled-Coil sequences to useful tools during complex oligopeptide assembly. We want to present novel chimeric oligopeptides which are build up by two segments, one responsible for association the other for functionality. As a model for the association segment several GCN4-leucine zipper mutants (1) and as functionality segments amongst others WW domains were used. Both segments were linked by the native chemical ligation approach. We will present in detail the synthesis of a GCN4-leucine zipper mutant and also the following C-terminal thioester formation for the subsequent ligation step. Furthermore, we will present the synthesis of the functional device, a WW-domain with a N-terminal cystein residue and also the native chemical ligation of both synthesized peptide fragments supported by HPLC and Mass-chromatography. Dialysis-related amyloidosis, a disease arising from long-term dialysis is characterised by gradual accumulation of 2-microglobulin ( 2m) amyloid fi brils in bones and ligaments. Although 2-m is known to form amyloid fi brils in vitro under acidic pH conditions, seeding of preformed amyloid fi brils or as an effect of ionic strength, the mechanism underlying aggregation of soluble 2-m into insoluble fi brils under physiological conditions is largely unknown. Interestingly, Eakin and co. recently showed that the chemical basis of the amyloidogenesis process is a backbone isomerisation of the conserved Pro 32. Our aim is to understand the molecular mechanism associated with 2-m amyloidogenesis using Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and site-directed-isotope labelling, a method in which the vibration of the labelled residue is shifted from its original position in the spectrum. We already demonstrated that FTIR spectroscopy along with site directed-isotope-labelling is a promising approach to obtain information on the microenvironment of tyrosine side chain residues.2 To use this approach in the case of 2-m amyloidogenesis, we decided to synthesise an isotopically labelled 2-m at crucial residues such as Pro 32 that should undergo drastic variations in their microenvironments during the misfolding. With its 99 residues, 2-m is over the limits of a reasonable synthesis using SPPS but the two suitably positioned cysteines in its sequence offer the possibility of a chemical synthesis using native chemical ligation. Thus, we were able to realise the chemical synthesis of an isotopically labelled 2-m in a good yield using a three segments strategy with disconnections at the two cysteines and thiazolidine as a masked cysteine for the middle segment. The synthetic 2-m obtained was in full agreement with the characteristic 2-m FTIR spectra.",

A method, permitting the convergent synthesis of azapeptides starting from unprotected fragments, would offer the possibility to study aza amino acids effect in complex polypeptides or proteins. We have focussed our study on ligation reactions leading to the formation of an azaGly residue at the ligation point, as Gly is a frequent amino acid in peptides or proteins. The fi rst synthetic strategy relies on the reaction between a peptide thioester and a N-terminal azaglycine peptide. Experimental conditions were found which permitted the chemoselective formation of azapeptide but with racemisation of the C-terminal amino acid of the thioester fragment. Alternately, a synthetic strategy based on the chemistry of the phenylthiocarbonyl group, permitted the successful synthesis of azapeptide without racemisation. (2), native glycoforms are of therapeutic interest. Our retrosynthetic strategy implies sequential native chemical ligation (3) and the split of IL-6 into three fragments. An N-terminal fragment IL-6 (1-42) thioester and the cysteine fragment IL-6 (49-183) were expressed in E. coli. The carbohydrate carrying fragment IL-6 (43-48) was synthesized via SPPS. To obtain the recombinant fragments specifi c termini were required. The N-terminal IL-6 (1-42) was fused between two inteins and after expression and refolding from inclusion bodies the target peptide was released as a C-terminal thioester after dual intein cleavage. The cysteine fragment IL-6 (49-183) was expressed as a single intein fusion also leading to inclusion bodies. This enabled the release of IL-6 (49-183) with an N-terminal cysteine after intein cleavage of the refolded fusion protein. The central segment IL-6 (43-48) contains a sugar residue attached to the N-glycosylation-site at Asn44. This fragment features both a C-terminal thioester and an N-terminal cysteine protected as a thiazolidine. Sequential ligations leading to the full length IL-6 glycoprotein will be presented.",

Therefore DSM Pharmaceutical Products embarked on a research programme on chemo-enzymatic peptide synthesis. Important advantages of this technology are that no expensive stoichiometric coupling reagents nor side-chain protection are required and that no racemisation occurs. Focus is on elongation in the N \u00a8C terminal direction using novel enzymatic C-protecting group interconversion methods. One of the preferred building blocks are amino acid amides, but selective deprotection of peptidic C-terminal amides is a challenge. We discovered 1 that using a Peptide Amidase 2 C-terminal peptide amides can be directly converted to methyl esters in almost pure methanol. Thus, separate enzymatic hydrolysis and reactivation steps are no longer required. Other versatile building blocks are amino acid t-butyl esters. We discovered that peptide C-terminal t-butyl esters can be transformed, using commercially available proteases, to activated alkyl esters such as methyl-and benzylesters which can be directly used in another protease-mediated coupling reaction. 3 Furthermore, we found that using commercial enzymes side chain unprotected peptides with a free C-carboxyl terminus can be directly transformed to Cterminal thioesters 4 and C-terminal aryl amides 5 in the presence of the corresponding thiol and aniline, respectively. Finally, a real-life example of large-scale industrial chemo-enzymatic peptide production will be shown. It is known that chiral amino acids, as well as their dipeptides, may catalyze the asymmetric condensation of glycolaldehyde in water. On the basis of the particularly large erythrose enantiomeric excesses (ee) obtained when utilizing the chiral L-Val-L-Val catalyst and given the possibility of an abundant delivery of other types of amino acids to the early Earth, we have studied the catalytic effect on this synthesis of the peptides based on C -methylated -amino acids, such as Iva (isovaline or C -methyl, C -aminobutyric acid) and C -methylvaline, ( Me)Val, that are abundant in meteorites.",

However, the isolation from their natural sources is rather diffi cult and the desire to introduce modifi cations necessitates the development of novel methods to synthesize such polymers with repeating peptide sequences. Recently, we have shown that the microwave-assisted copper(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition can be used in the polymerization of the model dipeptide azido-Phe-Alapropargyl amide. By varying the reaction conditions we could either obtain small cyclic oligomers (4-20 AAs) or linear polymers which consisted up to 300 AAs residues (1). To broaden the scope of this polymerization reaction, two novel biodegradable monomers, azido-Phe-Ala-Lys-propargyl amide and azido-Phe-Ala-Glyc-Lys-propargyl amide were polymerized. Both monomers are water-soluble and contain recognition sites for the proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin; moreover, the tetrapeptide can be chemically hydrolyzed depending on the pH of the solution. The molecular weight of the polymers could be tailored between 4 -14 kDa (33 to 100 AAs residues). The enzymatic degradability of the polypeptides was monitored by a ninhydrin-based colorimetric assay and by MALDI-TOF. The results showed that the peptidic polytriazoles were smoothly degraded by trypsin and chymotrypsin. From these data we can conclude that the microwave-assisted copper(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction is an effective tool to synthesize biodegradable functional polymers which provides new opportunities to design (novel) biomedical materials. Details of monomer synthesis, polymerization reactions and degradation studies will be presented.

Macrolides are well known translation inhibitors, they bind to ribosomal tunnel (RT) in a way that their lactone ring is located orthogonally to the long axis of the RT, covering most of its cleft; hence, the mechanism of protein synthesis inhibition by macrolides relies on the mechanical obstruction they provide to the passage of nascent polypeptide chain through the RT. Recently we have designed and synthesized a number of peptide derivatives of macrolides where the peptide part modeled the growing chain, while the antibiotic served as an \"anchor\" for positioning the peptide at the specifi c site of RT. These derivatives are of interest both as antibacterial agents and as potential probes for investigation of the interactions of nascent peptide chain with the specifi c sites of the RT and their infl uence on the translation. Now we report a new type of peptide -macrolide conjugates in which peptide binds by its -amino function through a spacer to the 4'-hydroxyl group of the mycaminose residue of Des. Two proline-containing peptides are chosen: GP and GGP. Proline residues of these peptides are supposed to interact with the peptidyl transferase center region when the complexes of these 4'-peptidyldesmycosins with bacterial ribosomes are formed. The fi rst step of the synthesis was acetylation of 2'-, 2\"-, 4\"and 4\"'-OH-groups of Tyl by Ac2O in pyridine following by hydrolysis in 1N sulphuric acid resulted in Des with all protected OH-groups except 4'-OH-group of mycaminose. This free hydroxyl group was used for reaction with succinic anhydride leading to formation of reactive carboxyl group. The next step was a reaction between this carboxyl function with -amino groups of peptide methyl esters. The structures of new 4'-peptide derivatives of Des were proved by MS MALDI and NMR-spectroscopy.",

After synthesis and modifi cation of PC, its covalent conjugates with Hemagglutinin (HA 98-106) were obtained by carbodiimide activation. Its characterization was also performed. The peptide coupling reagent fi eld has clearly evolved in the last decade from carbodiimides to onium (phosphonium and uronium) salts. The era of industrial coupling reagents began in 1955 with the introduction of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), which at that time was already known and well studied, as a reagent for the formation of amide bond. Unfortunately, carbodiimides did not comply with the concept of ultimate coupling reagents because its high reactivity provokes racemization and side reactions during the coupling reaction. At the beginning of the 70's, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) was proposed as an additive to DCC to reduce racemization and from then on other benzotriazole derivatives such as 1-hydroxy-6-chlorobenzotriazole (Cl-HOBt) or 1-hydroxy-7azabenzotriazole (HOAt) have also been used. The OBt active esters are less reactive than the O-acylisourea, but are more stable and less prone to racemize. The use of the most reactive aminium salt, HATU , is inconvenient because of the price, which makes its use detrimental for industry. HCTU/TCTU, based on Cl-HOBt, are a good alternative to HBTU/TBTU, because of the presence of the chlorine atom that stabilizes the structure, hence, making these reagents less hazardous. Herein, PyClocK, the phosphonium salt of the Cl-HOBt is introduced P20100-001 N-Methylation of biologically active peptides is of interest because it results in increased conformational integrity and stability against enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, N-methylated peptides have a decreased ability to form H-bonds to water molecules and, consequently, a better ability to cross biological barriers. This is exemplifi ed by the naturally occurring peptide cyclosporine which is orally active. In an effort to improve the blood-brain barrier permeability of the cyclic enkephalin analogues H-Dmt-c[D-Cys-Gly-Phe-D(or L)-Cys]NH 2 (Dmt = 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine), we prepared analogues that were N-methylated at Phe 4 and/or Cys 5 .

Haemostasis is a key process whose correct functioning is an important defence mechanism of the human organism. It is a blood coagulation process activated in case of injury of the blood system. If it is functioning correctly vascular-motor and cell reactions are triggered and the blood coagulation cascade is activated. One of the most important enzymes in the blood coagulation cascade is Factor Xa. That's why its inhibitors are promising alternative against thrombotic disorders. In our previous work, we reported the synthesis of hybrid structure between isoform 2 and 3 of antistasin and the active sequences D-Phe-Pro-Arg; D-Arg-Gly-Arg; Phe-Ile-Arg and Tyr-Ile-Arg (1). Beside the analogues with C-terminal COOH group, the peptide D-Phe-Pro-Arg-Pro-Lys-Arg-NH2 was synthesized. The biological activity of the last one was 60 times bigger than natural isoform 3 of ATS and some times more active than all other synthesized analogues. In the current work we described synthesis and biological activity of C-terminal amide analogues of all early synthesized peptides in order to deduce the structure-activity relationship. The anticoagulant activity according to the APTT and IC50 was determined. The neo-angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from a pre-existing vasculature which enables the supply of the nutrients and oxygen necessary for tumor growth. Consequently, inhibiting the blood vessels sprouting in order to starve the tumour constitutes an attractive anti-tumoral therapy. The vascular endothelial growth factor or their receptors (VEGFR-1 and 2) are key mediators of neo-angiogenesis and constitute nowadays validated targets for anti-angiogenic therapies (1) . Despite this fact, strategies aiming to develop pure receptors antagonists and not inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase activity remain scarce. We have previously designed antagonists that interact with the extra-cellular domain of VEGF receptor 1 and thus prevent VEGF binding (2) . These antagonists were proved to be potent and able to interfere with the VEGF signalling pathway. Because these compounds were rationally designed by using the co-crystallized structure of VEGF with the immunoglobulin like fragment 2 of VEGFR-1, we raise the following question: do these antagonists really target the immunoglobulin like domain 2 of VEGFR-1? In order to respond to this question but also with the future aim of optimizing our antagonist in a rational way we need to co-crystallize at least one of our antagonists with the d2 fragment of the VEGFR-1. Furthermore, since human VEGFR-1 d2 is a potential target in the development of angiogenesis modulators, the availability of this protein domain, and mutants, should be useful in the screening and development of novel specifi c ligands.

            "text": "Chung, Nga N. 1 Different types of turns are important elements of secondary structure in peptides and proteins. The most common ones are different kinds of -turns involving four consecutive amino acid residues. The dipeptide unit containing the second and the third residues of such turns exists in the cis-conformation. Our cispeptide bond motif 4-aminopyroglutamic acid promotes the -turn type VI/VI', and can be treated as a hybrid of glycine and alanine. This feature prohibits its utilization as a replacement for any possible dipeptide unit. In order to convert our compound into a more valuable tool for probing the existence of a particular peptide bond in the cis-conformation, we have elaborated the synthesis of Nmonoalkylated derivatives of 4-aminopyroglutamic residue through a reductive alkylation reaction performed on solid support. Following this idea, we have obtained analogues with N-benzylated and N-(phydroxy)benzylated 4-aminopyroglutamic residues as scaffolds for the Phe-Ala and Tyr-Ala dipeptides units, respectively. Only one of 12 enkephalin analogues, [N(Bzl)-(R,R)-apy4-5]-enkephalin amide, possesses similar agonist potency as Leu-enkephalin in the GPI assay, indicating that the C-terminal part of this peptide may assume the cisconformation upon binding to the receptor. This is the fi rst active opiod analogue containing a 4-aminopyroglutamic acid residue. Supported by KBN (Poland) grant 2 P05F 00129 and NIH (U.S.) grant DA-04443 MIF-1 (L-Prolyl-L-Leucyl-Glycine amide, PLG) is a brain peptide, presented in hypothalamic tissue, as well as the C-terminal tripeptide of the neurohypophiseal hormone oxytocin and inhibits the release of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) in some systems. Recently, some chemical modifi cations of MIF-1 to enhance opiate agonist/ antagonist actions as well as binding activity of analogues have been reported. On the other hand, the concept of structural modifi cation in peptide fragments to confer them specifi c properties is of current interest in the study and design of new bioactive targets. A well known example is the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into the molecule of natural biologically active peptides leading to analogues with signifi cant theoretical and practical importance. With this idea in mind we studied possibilities of introducing unnatural amino acids canaline (Can), norcanaline (NCan), canavanine (Cav), nor-canavanine (NCav) and sLys into MIF-moiety in order to achieve a better analgesic effect. To obtain the peptide mimetics, both Fmoc-and Boc-based SPPS approach were used. Analgesic activity was determined by the paw-pressure (PP) and HP tests. The experiments were carried on male Wistar rats. The changes in the mechanical nociceptive threshold of the rats were measured by the Randall-Selito paw pressure test using analgesimeter (Ugo Basile). It was found that substitution of Leu in position 2 of MIF-molecule by unnatural amino acids increased the pain threshold. The analgesic effect with Cav-substitution was highest, whereas parent MIF-1 showed only a minute increase of pain-threshold. The compound M6 had the strongest effect on learning and memory and the compound P6 showed the strongest and fastest analgesic effect. The compound M6 and P6 were also able to modify the effect of the model CNS-drugs (hexobarbital and pentylenetetrazole). Theoretically and experimentally determined octanol/water logP values of the compounds correlate with their CNS-effects. M6 and P6 had higher logP than M3 and P3 and showed better antinociceptive and anticonvulsant activity in vivo. Compounds possessed also chelating activity towards Fe ions. The stronger chelating activity of the compounds with the 6-spacer clearly correlated with their better neuropharmacological activity in vivo (in comparison to the compounds with the 3-spacer). The position isomery may also contribute for the variations in their pharmacological activity. The limited number of the compounds does not allow derivation of well-defi ned structure-activity relationships, however, their 3D models show possibility for many low energy conformers with different atoms involved in formation of Fe chelating complexes. A major challenge in opioid peptide chemistry is the synthesis of novel compounds mimicking the endogenous peptide ligands. These new peptidomimetics should be biologically active and more stable against enzymatic degradation than their parent ligands. One of the possibilities is the introduction of -amino acids into the peptides sequence. Monosubstituted -amino acids ( 2 -or 3 -) due to their similarity in structure to -amino acids, moreover their tendency to give folded structures even in short peptides and to the stability towards mammalian peptidases may be very useful in the creation of the new potentially active compounds. We have developed simple and effi cient two step conversion of the cyanoacetate into fully protected 2 -amino acids. The procedure involves Knoevenagel condensation of the methyl cyanoacetate and aromatic aldehydes (for aromatic path) or alkylation of the methyl cyanoacetate with various alkyl halides (for aliphatic path) at fi rst then reduction and Boc-protection (performed in one pot) of the resulting fi rst stepproducts.",

It is well known that unnatural amino acids with guanidine functionality exhibit diverse pharmacological effects when introduced in biologically active systems. Our previous efforts were focused on the preparation and the characterization of unnatural amino acids, particularly those containing a basic functionality in the side chain. We have synthesized numerous unnatural amino acids, structural analogues of arginine and lysine, which demonstrated certain biological effects. Recently, as part of our ongoing research focused on the search of novel arginine mimetics, we developed an effi cient approach for solid-phase synthesis of unnatural amino acids nor-canaline (NCan) and nor-canavanine (NCav). Next we studied the possibilities of introducing NCan and NCav into the molecule of biologically active peptides. We also studied their antinociceptive effects using the paw pressure (PP) and HP tests. In the last few decades, considerable attention has been devoted on the potential role and activity of certain environmental pollutants (EDCs) in increasing anomalies that involve the endocrine system of wild species and Man. (1)The development of a fast high-throughput detection system for the quantitative analysis of EDCs requires the development of a novel sensitive solid phase EDCs extraction method. Because of the high affi nity of EDCs with the estrogen receptor, this has been greatly investigated. This study has leaded the recognition of the amino acids located in the ligand binding domain of the receptor which interact with EDCs. Use of a dipodal scaffold molecule and different combination of the crucial amino acids, will allow the generation of a library of small to medium size biomimetic receptors. In this communication, we will disclose our fi rst results in the preparation of a small library of biomimetic receptors, with and without the dipodal scaffold, to evaluate their affi nity towards EDCs and the role played by the scaffold structure.

A possible solution is the use of estrogen receptor mimics for affi nity chromatography. To this end, scaffold 1 will be synthesized and used for building a tetrapodal peptidomimetic library. Amino acids known to be important for the estrogen-receptor interaction will be preferably incorporated. First of all, we set out to prepare one dipodal peptide library member 6. The orthogonally protected scaffold 2 was synthesized in one single step starting from the commercially available 3amino-5-nitrobenzoic acid.2 Using Fmoc solid phase chemistry on Wang resin as the solid support, this dipodal scaffold allowed the attachment of two different oligopeptide chains.Employing this methodology the synthesis of a small library will be performed, and the affi nity of the different peptidomimetics for EDC's will be investigated.",

            "text": "In the search for potential antimicrobial drugs, we have been dealing with two microbial enzymatic systems: N \u00e1 -succinyl-L-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (dapE 1, 2 ) and N \u00e1 -acetyl-L-ornithine deacetylase (argE 3, 4 ), which might be promising targets for potent and selective enzyme inhibitors based on the modifi cation of N \u00e1 -succinyl-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) and N \u00e1 -acetyl-ornithine (Orn). The inhibition of both the enzymes would possibly interrupt the pathways leading to development of bacteria due to a role of meso-DAP as essential component of peptidoglycan based bacterial cell walls and Orn, as well, being a component of biosynthetic pathway for arginine that can serve as a source of both the carbon and nitrogen in microorganisms. Our effort was focused on the synthesis and characterization of two series of N \u00e1 -substituted derivatives of DAP and Orn, potentially interfering with the hydrolytic action of dapE and argE in the processes of bacterial growth. In this introductory study, the compounds prepared were also assayed against bacterial strains Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and inhibitory activity of Orn derivatives was found with regard to differences in the structure of N \u00e1 -substituent. The fi rst report on practically effective bradykinin (BK) antagonists for B 2 receptors was published in 1984. The key to conversion of bradykinin into an antagonist was replacement of Pro 7 with an aromatic D-amino acid; D-Phe was fi rst used. However, our studies demonstrated that the D-amino acid residue at position 7 of the bradykinin antagonist, until recently considered to be necessary for B 2 antagonism, can be replaced by suitable L-amino acid or achiral residue or, together with the amino acid occupying position 8, by a sterically restricted dipeptide unit. Having all this in mind we synthesized and bioassayed two new analogues of bradykinin. The peptides were designed by substitution of position 7 of bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist ([D-Arg 0 ,Hyp 3 ,Thi 5,8 ,D-Phe 7 ]BK), previously described by Stewart's group, with structural isomer of proline: 2 -iso-Pro or its homologue: 3 -homo-Pro. It's worth emphasizing that position 7 in bradykinin molecule is occupied by proline residue. Our previous results demonstrated the importance of the position in the peptide chain into which the sterically restricted 1-aminocyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid residue (Acc) was inserted. These fi ndings prompted us to investigate how introduction of L-pipecolic acid residue (L-Pip) in position 7 or 8 of Stewart's antagonist will affect pharmacological properties of resulting compounds. In comparison to the Acc residue, the ring of L-pipecolic acid also consists of six atoms, but includes the nitrogen atom. Bearing in mind that acylation of the N-terminus of several known B 2 blockers with a variety of bulky groups has consistently improved their antagonistic potency in the rat blood pressure assay, the aforementioned four analogues were also synthesized in the N-acylated form with 1-adamantaneacetic acid (Aaa). The activity of eight new analogues was assessed in isolates rat uterus and in rat blood pressure test",

The modifi ed protein thus, contains new or rare amino acids or new specifi c side groups that can have critical infl uence on the structure and function of the protein molecule. Conversion of arginine to citrulline, an important postranslational modifi cation, was fi rst described by Fearon. Arginine residues in proteins can undergo this modifi cation and the resulting citrulline remains part of the protein in the position of arginine. Citrulline is not a natural amino acid in proteins, and may induce immune responses. Such responses have been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune/infl ammatory diseases such as MS and rheumatoid arthritis 1.

We synthesized peptide analogs that map to the myelin basic protein ( . Analogs P4 and P5 resulted from the citrullination of the 91 and 97 arginine residues in epitopes P2 and P3.

Interestingly, this N-N turn promotes a well-defi ned -turn formation (hydrogen bond between the CO of the residue i-2 and the hydrazidic proton of the aza-3-moeity) when an -amino acid is foregoing.2 26RFa, a novel neuropeptide of the RFamide superfamily, exhibits high affi nity for GPR103 and induces a potent orexigenic effect in mice. 3 In biomimetic environment, 26RFa encompasses an -helix between Pro4 and Arg17 residues and a canonical -turn centered on Ser23. 26RFa(20-26), whose sequence is strictly conserved across species, is about 100 times less potent than 26RFa.

The problem of N-terminal formyl-Met removal from gene-engineered proteins, which are produced by bacillacae may be solved by introduction of specifi cally-cleaved insert after formyl-Met. Subsequent specifi c removal of such short N-terminal peptide results in mature protein. Moreover, the analysis of cleaved short peptides could characterize the process of mature protein formation. We suggest microbial enzymes with narrow specifi city to solve the mentioned problem. For this aim we have isolated the trypsin-like enzyme and postproline-specifi c endopeptidase from Aspergillus sp. and glutamyl-specifi c protease from B. intermedius. These enzymes have high specifi city approved by hydrolysis of short synthetic peptides and long polypeptides. For example, specifi city of postproline protease was established by hydrolysis of mellitin. The fi nal peptide mixture was analyzed by RP-HPLC and mass-spectra. The use of enzymes with narrow specifi city is demonstrated in the analytic method of detection of formyl-Met presence at the N-terminus of gene-engineered -interferon. Trypsine hydrolysis of -interferon leads to more than 14 peptides are formed including the 12-membered N-terminal peptide. Being hydrolyzed with glutamyl-specifi c enzyme -interferon is converted to 6 peptides, including 41-membered N-terminal peptide. Application of postprolinespecifi c enzyme for -interferon hydrolysis leads to formation of 1 short 4-membered peptide and 4 long fragments. Experimental data show that in case of analytic control of -interferon maturity the utilization of postproline-specifi c protease is preferable.

These include ADAM proteins, growth factors proIGF1 and 2 and hormonal protein PACAP. Lack of PC4 leads to impaired fertility in mice, suggesting its important role in reproduction. PC4 is thus considered an important target for development of nonhormonal contraceptive agents. PC4-inhibitors are expected to fi nd therapeutic, clinical and biochemical applications. A lot of interest has grown to develop specifi c PC4 inhibitors. Recently natural inhibitor of serpin family have been described for PC1, 2, and furin, but not for PC4. However, a new serpin, CRES, has been reported from epididymis fl uid, where PC4 may be found. So far, CRES has only been shown to inhibit PC2, which is not present in reproductive tissues. We propose that CRES may represent a natural regulator of PC4, based on localization and other studies. In this study we generated recombinant human CRES protein (139 aa), and its reactive-site loop (RSL) derived acyclic and cyclic 43-mer peptides with various S-S linkage combinations. CRES inhibited PC4 with IC50 ~50uM, while RSL-peptides were found to be more potent with IC50 50-250nM, depending on the S-S linkage locations. Furthermore, we noted that at lower concentrations, CRES and its peptides fi rst enhanced PC4 activity before any inhibition occurred. This bimodal behavior may be due to cleavage. Molecular modeling showed strong interactions between CRES and PC4 via some of their key residues. Overall, we noted that \"RSL\" is the most crucial element required for PC4 inhibition by CRES. Funds were from from CIHR (AB).",

            "text": "The de novo design of peptides and proteins has assumed considerable interest didehydroresidues, in particular alpha, in the recent years. alpha, beta-beta-didehydrophenylalanine (deltaPhe) are being considered important conformational constraints inducing tools in de novo peptide design. deltaPhe is a noncoded, achiral residue, an analog of the naturally occurring phenylalanine amino acid with a double bond between Calpha and Cbeta atoms. Introduction of deltaPhe in peptide sequences is known to induce conformational constraint, both in the peptide backbone as well as the side chain, and to provide the peptide with increased resistance to enzymatic degradation. In small peptides containing eta turn structure, and in peptides containing a single deltaPhe, a type II b more than one deltaPhe residues, helical structures are stabilized. A number of deltaPhe peptides varying in length, content and position of deltaPhe residues have been found to contain 310 helices of both screw senses. Following these design principles, we were able to design, synthesize and characterize super secondary structural motifs like helix-turn-helix, helical bundle and glycine zipper. We have extended this work to the de novo design of peptides with antibiotic and anti-fi brillization activity. A series of cationic peptides containing deltaPhe residues have shown remarkable antibiotic activity and are being developed further. deltaPhe containing peptides may have longer in vivo half life owing to their ability to resist enzymatic degradation. More recently, we have observed that small peptides containing deltaPhe self-assemble in nanotubular and nanovesicular structures. These nanostructures have also been used to entrap small drug like molecules. We have fully characterized these systems and are exploring their potential as delivery agents in biological systems. The synthesis and design of peptidomimetic oligomers that adopt designed, compact conformations (foldamers) have become a challenging task in recent years. Among them, -peptide foldamers exhibit rich diversity of secondary structures. [1, 2] A relationship has been established between the backbone chirality pattern and the prevailing secondary structure, which underlines the role of stereochemical control in the -peptide foldamer design.(3) An important challenge is to introduce proteinogenic side-chains to generate diverse anchor points on the molecular surface promoting their application in drug discovery. It has been proved that stable helices can be obtained when sequences were coupled with -amino acid enantiomeric pair motifs in a LEGO approach.(3) In this work, -amino acids and open chain functionalized -amino acids were inserted between the enantiomeric pair design element for 1 and 2, respectively. Confi gurations in the backbone were designed to promote helix formation. NMR and ECD measurements augmented with ab initio calculations revealed that 1 forms a H9-12 helix and 2 forms a H14/16 helix. These helices are unprecedented in the literature. To prove that the stereochemical patterning is crucial in the folding, we perturbed the confi guration motifs of the backbones by swapping the sequence of the central -amino acids. The peptides with exchanged residue order could not fold into helices. These novel structures can be useful scaffolds for biomedical applications. Introduction Small length synthetic peptides, based on SP C-terminal fragment, increase the secretion of TNF-and prevent the proliferation of several cancer cell lines. We have already shown the antiproliferative activity of tri-and tetra-peptoids in breast and prostate cancer cells. The aim of this study was the synthesis of hexa-peptoids, analogs of SP C-terminal region, containing the residues D-Trp and Tic and the peptoid ones NHN(R)CH2CO, NPhe and NAla in their sequence and their evaluation against cancer cells proliferation. Methods and Results All the syntheses were carried out stepwise using the Fmoc/ But methodology on the solid support 2-CLTR resin and DIC/HOBt as coupling reagent. All analogs were purifi ed (HPLC) and identifi ed ( Cyclotheonamides constitute a family of structurally related cyclic pentapeptides of marine origin that inhibit trypsin-like serine proteases. Their binding mode has been elucidated by the X-ray structure of cyclotheonamide A in complex with trypsin. An extended peptide conformation which is stabilized by macrolactamization allows to address in a substrate-like manner beside the S1 pocket also the S1' and S2 pocket. The S1 ligand, (S)-3-amino-6-guanidino-2-oxo-hexanoic acid, interacts via its guanido function with Asp 189 at the bottom of the S1 pocket. In addition, the ketone covalently modifi es the gammaoxygen of Ser 195 by hemiketal formation (1) . Recently, two novel cyclotheonamides have been isolated from a marine sponge of the genus Ircinia. One of them, cyclotheonamide E4, is a potent inhibitor of human beta-tryptase (2) . In this study, cyclotheonamide E4 was modifi ed at two positions: (i) the S1 ligand was replaced by beta-homolysine or as betahomoarginine to obtain reversible acting tryptase inhibitors, and (ii) the alpha amino function of (S)-2,3-diamino propionic acid, which is not part of the cyclic backbone, was used as anchoring point for basic P3 residues to exploit interactions with the negatively charged Glu 217 of tryptase. These analogs were synthesized by a combination of solid phase and solution phase chemistry 3.. Synthetic details as well as the inhibitory profi le of these novel cyclotheonamide E4 analogs will be discussed. ",

Peptomeric library consisting of 360 monocyclic analogues of SFTI-1 was designed and synthesized by the solid phase method with the intension of select chymotrypsin and cathepsin G inhibitors. All peptomers contained in positions 5 and 12 Nbenzylglycine (Nphe) that mimics proteinogenic Phe. In the synthesized library different peptoid monomers were introduced in the segment 7-10.

This analogue was even more active than the one with Pro in this position which is absolutely conserved in Bownan-Birk inhibitors. While, deconvolution carried out against cathepsin G indicated that analogue with Npiperonylglycine (Npip) in position 8 and 9 and with N-butylglycine (Norleu) in position 10 presents the highest inhibitory activity.

These libraries have been screened for antibacterial activity and eukaryotic cytotoxicity, and have led to the identifi cation of peptides with MIC values of 1.6-12.5 microM. Notably, cyclic peptides active against E. amylovora have been found, constituting the fi rst report of this type of peptides with activity towards this bacteria.

In order to identify new molecules able to selectively bind Flt-1 and neutralize its activity, a screening of a combinatorial tetrameric tripeptide library built with nonnatural amino acids has been carried out by a competitive ELISA-based assay. The library has been designed on a branched tetrameric structure in order to obtain molecules with a high recognition surface and, using 30 building blocks, a complexity of 27.000 different peptides has been achieved. Peptide mixtures composing the library have been utilized as competitors of the Flt-1/PlGF (placental growth factor) interaction and the most active components have been isolated following an iterative deconvolution procedure. The selected most active hit shows a selective binding to Flt-1 over KDR and inhibits in vitro its interaction with both PlGF and VEGF-A. The peptide is fully stable in biological environments, prevents Flt-1 phosphorylation and blocks HUVEC capillary-like tube formation stimulated by PlGF or VEGF-A.

Especially the synthesis of the required protein fragments in high purity and good yields demands for effi cient methods. Fragment condensation of protected peptides can reduce deletions in the crude product and thus facilitates purifi cation. Condensation of peptide fragments in CSPPS (2) is however subject to epimerization upon Cterminal carboxyl activation. To overcome this problem the use of Cterminal Gly or Pro is usually performed. Peptides containing C-terminal pseudoprolines can also be coupled without stereomutation because the serine or threonine residue has been reversibly protected as a prolinelike oxazolidine (3). This concept facilitates the synthesis of long peptides by epimerization-free fragment condensation at C-terminal Ser/ Thr residues in addition to Gly/Pro residues thus increasing the number of safe condensation sites. After solving several problems associated with the generation of peptide acids with C-terminal pseudoprolines the synthesis of the glycosylated RNase fragment was carried out as a racemization-free fragment condensation. Tuftsin is liberated from Fc-domain of the heavy chain of IgG by two specifi c enzymes. Being the tetrapeptide of biological origin is extremely important product because it can activate a few elements of immune system such as granulocyte and macrophage. Tuftsin indicates not only immunological stimulating factor but also antibacterial, antivirial and antitumor properties. In spite of its wide range of activity, the peptide is unstable in plasma and it has become the aim of the formation of novel analogues more resistant to proteolysis degradation.

A 23 amino acid peptide sequence (Phyl) from the Phyllopod protein has been identifi ed as the interaction site with Siah. The aim of this work was to show that a small peptide could mirror the activity of the transfected recombinant Phyllopod protein. To achieve this, Phyl was covalently attached to cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) and tested for its ability to inhibit Hif-1\u0192\u00d1 stabilization and hypoxic response in human U2OS cells. Both the TAT sequence and Penetratin were utilized as CPPs and attachment was via disulfi de, maleimide or through a Pro10 spacer sequence. The CPP\u00a1VPhyl constructs were found to have varying activities but a Penetratin-Pro10-Phyl was found to be inhibitory in the U2OS cell-line Hif-1\u0192\u00d1 stabilization assay.

The events surrounding this transformation are very poorly understood, but the mechanism of the detailed steps involved in this process is fundamental to the understanding of prion disease pathogenesis. In an endeavour to study the structure of polypeptide component of the N-terminal section of PrPc, synthesis of a range of PrP polypeptides were assembled on a CEM Liberty microwave synthesiser. These fragments ranged in length from 20 to 111 amino acids and span the protein sequence from position 1 to 144. Standard CEM synthetic coupling cycles were used, except when peptides were greater than 30 amino acids in length, whereby longer coupling cycles were employed. A number of purifi cation strategies were employed, such as C4 and C18 RP-HPLC at either 25C or 60C and size exclusion chromatography. The purifi ed peptides were characterised by RP-HPLC and ESI-MS.

An alanine scan of the molecule highlighted the residues critical for activity. In this work, we explore the relative importance of positively charged residues in different regions of the molecule to aid the understanding of the structural and biological basis of its nematocidal activity. A lysine scan has been conducted, in which each of the non-Cys residues in this 29 amino acid peptide has been successively replaced with lysine and the suite of peptides have been assayed against the two sheep nematodes. Substitution of residues in loop1, V10, G12, N15, T16, W23, V25, L2, P3, and V4 decreased or completely abolished the activity, suggesting that these residues are critical to the nematocidal activity of kalata B1. On the other hand, incorporation of a positive charge in positions G18, T20, T27, N29, and G1 signifi cantly enhanced the anthelmintic activity of the grafted peptides, up to fourfold, compared to native kalata B1. These increases in activity after lysine incorporation into the kB1 scaffold raise the possibility of being able to engineer greater anthelmintic activity into the peptides, further highlighting their potential as anthelmintic agents.",

Interaction of cells with substratum may be divided into cell adhesion and spreading. Following an initial cell attachment event, cell may or not spread depending on cell type and the nature of the molecular signals they receive.

Cyanobacterial culture collection in University of Helsinki contains over 1000 strains and this collection is used for screening of new bioactive compounds. Cyclic heptapeptides, microcystins are the best known cyanobacterial peptide family. Over 80 structural variants have been described from which most are strong hepatotoxins. Our research group have participated to the determination of the structure of many novel microcystins and other cyclic and linear cyanobacterial peptides. In recent years we have found highly toxic and novel microcystins from lichen associated cyanobacteria (1) and from Anabaena strains of Baltic Sea (2). In the structural analysis of new peptides from the known peptide families we have used liquid chromatography ion trap mass spectrometry which have proven to be very effective method and is in many cases the only method needed in the verifi cation of a new structure. With this LC-ITMS method we have found many new structural variants from Anabaenopeptin, Anabaenopeptilide and Spumigin peptide families. In collaboration with many research groups we have found cyanobacterial compounds/extracts which inhibit protein kinase C activity, inhibit/activate boar sperm motility, disintegrate cell membranes or are antidotes for microcystin toxicity. Structures of the compounds are under study except the microcystin antidote which structural analysis showed that it belongs to a rare peptide family containing imino bond in cyclic skeleton. ",

The highly potent oxytocin receptor antagonists Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a cyclic nonapeptide with multiple functions. The main peripheral physiological roles of AVP are the regulation of water balance, the control of blood pressure, and the release of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). Moreover, AVP also exhibits to some extent typical oxytocin (OT, a closely related neurohypophyseal peptide) activities such as the galactogogic and the uterotonic effects. All peptides were tested for the pressor, antidiuretic and uterotonic in vitro activities in the rat. cis-Apc 2 modifi cation at position 2 of AVP is suffi cient to change the pharmacological profi le of the peptides. Analogues I -IV were moderately potent antidiuretic agonists with prolonged action. In regard to the uterotonic activity, all peptides with cis-Apc were highly potent antagonists, except compound I. It supports our earlier hypothesis that an amino acid residue in position 2 has signifi cant impact on pharmacological activities. The incorporation of unnatural non-proteinogenic -amino acids into peptides has emerged as a novel and promising approach in peptide modifi cation. The conformationally restricted amino acid derivatives are of particular interest. This thesis are also supported by our already 12-years research focused on the effects of steric restriction and the presence bulky substituent in the N-terminal part of AVP molecule on biological properties of the resulting analogues. All peptides were tested for the pressor, antidiuretic and uterotonic in vitro activities in the rat. All the analogues were devoid of the pressor potency and exhibited only negligible antidiuretic activity. Interestingly, in regard to the uterotonic activity, the new compounds exhibited moderate (I) or high (II -IV) antioxytocic potency. It should be point out that single substitution e.g. replacement of Tyr in AVP molecule with Igl results in moderately potent and highly selective antagonists of oxytocin (I).",

Arginine vasopressin (AVP), a neurohypophyseal hormone and neuromodulator, is a cyclic nonapeptide with a disulfi de bridge between Cys residues at positions 1 and 6. As a hormone AVP exerts its biological effects upon binding to three receptor subtypes termed: V 1A , V 1B (V 3 ), and V 2 .

Temporins A (TA) and L (TL) are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the skin of Red European frog \"Rana temporaria\". Temporins are active against a broad spectrum of microrganism: TA (FLPLIGRVLSGIL-NH2) is preferentially active against Gram-positive bacterial strains; TL (FVQWFSKFLGRIL-NH2) has the highest activity against fungi, and bacteria, including resistent Gram-negative strains, but it shows haemolytic activity too. TA exerts its antimicrobial activity by its ability to form a transmembrane pore via a 'barrel-stave' mechanism or to form a 'carpet' on the membrane surface via the 'carpet-like' model. Recently we investigated the preferential conformation of TL and TA in SDS and DPC solutions which mimic bacterial and mammalian membranes, respectively. In SDS, the peptides prefer a location at the micelle-water interface; in DPC, they prefer a perpendicular location to the micelle surface, with the N-terminus imbedded in the hydrophobic core. TL shows higher propensity, with respect to TA, in forminghelical structures in both membrane mimetic systems and the highest propensity to penetrate the micelles (1). On these results we designed and synthesized new TA and TL analogues and found interesting differences in their effi cacy against microbial species, and fi nding a new potent antimicrobial agent without haemolytic activity. Arginine vasopressin (AVP), a neurohypophyseal nonapeptide hormone [cycle1-6 (H-Cys 1 -Tyr 2 -Phe 3 -Gln 4 -Asn 5 -Cys 6 -Pro 7 -Arg 8 -Gly 9 -NH 2 )], elicits a variety of responses both centrally and peripherally by acting on three distict G-protein coupled receptors: V 1a (vascular), V 1b (pituitary) and V 2 (renal). It also binds to the oxytocin (OT) receptor. In addition to its well-known antidiuretic activity, AVP has also complex cardiovascular actions and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) releasing activity. Binding of AVP to the V 1a receptor subtype also stimulates glycogenolysis in the liver and promotes platelet aggregation. It is generally accepted that the conformation of the N-terminal part of neurohypophyseal hormones analogues is important for their pharmacological activity. In continuing our work aimed at the design of selective AVP analogues, we synthesized twelve new analogues of AVP containing mercapto propionic acid ( We also studied the effect of modifi ed C-terminal amide on biological potency of the new AVP analogues. The analogues were synthesized by Fmoc/Bu t solid phase methodology and were tested for their rat uterotonic in vitro activity, rat pressor activity and antidiuretic activity using conscious rats. The modifi cations performed had a signifi cant impact on pharmacological activities of the analogues.

It is generated by proteolytic cleavage in response to a microbial challenge. Similarly, a C-terminal fragment of hemocyanin displaying antimicrobial activity has been isolated from crayfi sh plasma (2) . These peptides are believed to contribute to the crustacean defence. The phenomenon of in vitro antimicrobial peptide generation from a respiratory pigment already observed with hemoglobin thus appears not to be restricted to mammals (3). PvHCt displays a broad spectrum of antifungal activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in the range 3-50 M (12.5 M against the shrimp pathogen Fusarium oxysporum). Its activity would be based on the inhibition of spore germination (1) . To contribute to the elucidation of the mechanism of PvHCt antifungal activity, we determined its three-dimensional structure by circular dichroism (CD), NMR and molecular modelling and examined its effects on the F. oxysporum spore ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). CD and NMR data indicate that PvHCt is unfolded in an aqueous environment but adopts a similar helical structure in methanol solution and in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles used to mimic biological membranes. The structure consists of an amphipathic -helix spanning residues 8 to 18. TEM shows that PvHCt induces structural changes of the plasma membrane accompanied by a disorganization of the cytoplasm and a signifi cant decrease of lipid bodies. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon (Gcg), and oxyntomodulin (Oxm) are highly homologous peptide hormones derived from posttranslational processing of the preproglucagon gene. The sequence of Oxm in particular, is identical to the sequence of Gcg, with an 8amino acid extension at the C-terminus. Pharmacological doses of Oxm activate both the GLP-1 receptor (GLP1R) and the glucagon receptor (GcgR) albeit with lower affi nity compared to GLP-1 and glucagon, respectively. In order to understand the origin of this dual specifi city, we synthesized a number of Oxm analogs in which one or more of the native amino acids were replaced. First, a chimera was produced in which all the residues differing between GLP-1 and Gcg were grafted into the Oxm native sequence, yielding an analog with the same pharmacologic profi le as GLP-1. Further studies showed that surprisingly, the switch from GLP1R/GcgR co-agonism to GLP1R-selective agonism could be obtained by a single amino acid substitutions at position 3 of Oxm. In particular, the analog with Gln3 substituted by Glu (Oxm-Q3E) showed the same activity as native Oxm on GLP1R, but complete loss of activity on GcgR. Oxm and Oxm-Q3E were compared in a hyperglycemic clamp study performed in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Due to the short half-life of the peptides, both were infused intravenously at ~16 g/kg/ min in chronically catheterized mice. The amount of exogenous glucose required to maintain the hyperglycemic level was 2-fold greater with the selective GLP1R agonist Oxm-Q3E than with the GLP1R/GcgR coagonist Oxm, showing that abolishment of GcgR activity signifi cantly improves the glucose-lowering effect. We believe that these fi ndings could be useful for the development of a peptide therapeutic for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

Recently, we isolated a two-component bacteriocin, thuricin, produced by Bacillus thuringiensis that exhibits activity against C. diffi cile. We found that these peptides, called Trn and Trn , operate together in a synergistic fashion to inhibit bacterial growth. The peptide combination was found to be highly active against a wide range of C. diffi cile strains, including the virulent epidemic strain of the O27 ribotype, as well as most other clostridia and some bacilli and Listeria species. MALDI mass spectrometry revealed that both peptides have molecular weights that are lower than those predicted from their genetic sequences, indicating that they are post-translationally modifi ed. Sequencing of the mature peptides through tandem mass spectrometry showed that each peptide has three modifi ed amino acid residues near its C-terminus. These residues were found to be two units lighter than their expected natural amino acid masses, suggesting a loss of two hydrogen atoms through dehydrogenation or oxidation. In order to confi rm these proposed modifi cations, we are investigating the production of 13 C-and 15 N-labeled Trn and Trn for structure elucidation by NMR. Isolation of labeled peptides will be achieved by growing B. thuringiensis on defi ned media containing [U-13 C] glucose and ( 15 NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 . Subsequent NMR experiments will enable us to determine the three-dimensional solution structures of Trn and Trn , individually and bound together. By elucidating thuricin's structure, we aim to better understand its mechanism of action against C. diffi cile. The most potent peptidic human bradykinin (BK) B 2 receptor antagonist is HOE-140 (Icatibant). In this study we present the synthesis of nine new analogues of HOE-140 substituted at position 7, 8 or 9 with chosen D-amino acid residues and/or nonproteinogenic amino acid residues, e.g. N-cyclohexylglycine (Nchg), 1-aminocyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid (Acc), octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid (Oic), piperidine-3-carboxylic acid (Nip) and 4-phenylpiperidine-4-carboxylic acid (Ppc). In the next nine peptides we combined the above mentioned modifi cations with the placement of 1-adamantane acetic acid (Aaa) at position 0. All new analogues were tested on human umbilical vein for their antagonistic potency. Only three compounds containing Nchg 8 , Nchg 9 or Ppc 9 exhibited noticeable antagonistic activities on human bradykinin receptors thus still less potent then original HOE-140 sequence. Each of them with Aaa 0 showed lower activity then parent analogues. Peptides: D-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-D-Phe-Nip-Arg and Aaa-D-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-D-Phe-Nip-Arg, although strongly potent antagonists against BK-induced blood pressure lowering responses in rats, did not show noticeable antagonistic activity on BK-induced contraction of the isolated human umbilical vein, a well-established B 2 R bioassay system, suggesting a species dependent activity of the compounds.",

In order to elucidate the mode of binding between Glu and GluRs, we focused on the visualization of GluRs by complex formation with fl uorescentlabeled analogs of NPTX-594 (1), a spider toxin with the structure of N 1 -(2,4-dihydroxyphenylacetyl-L-asparaginyl)-N 12 -L-lysyl-4,8-diaza-1,12-dodecanediamine [Dhpa-Asn-Dada(12Lys)].

Their particular killing mechanism and their low toxicity against mammalian cells make them attractive for the development of new antibiotics. Structure-activity relationships studies have been carried out on short Pro-Arg rich antimicrobial peptides isolated from insects and the characterization of various natural isoforms of the 18-residues peptide apidaecin Ib allowed to identify an evolutionary conserved region in the C-terminal part of the molecule. Even a single point mutation in this region results in reduction or loss of antimicrobial activity. We recently described the synthesis of some apidaecin Ib peptoid-peptide hybrids in which each arginine was replaced by the corresponding N-alkyl glycine residue (1). The afforded modifi cation made the resulting peptoid-peptide hybrids more resistant to proteolysis but moving the [Narg]residue from the N-to the C-terminal end of the molecule progressively reduced the antibacterial activity. Here we report the synthesis of a series of novel analogues containing a N-homoarginine or N-norarginine residue in position 4, 12 or 17. The effect of the size of the side-chain of the peptoid residue on the antimicrobial activity is also reported. In order to strengthen the peptide resistance to proteolysis and by considering that enzymic cleavage of the Arg 17 -Leu 18 peptide bond yields a fully inactive compound, we also prepared the [Nleu 18 ]-apidaecin analogue. The conformational properties of the resulting peptoid-peptide hybrid, which is devoid of any antimicrobial activity, will be compared to those of apidaecin Ib and the other [Narg]peptoid-peptide hybrids. A wide variety of organisms produce antimicrobial peptides as part of their fi rst line of defense. However, antimicrobial activity is not the main function of some of these peptides. In the Cuttlefi sh Sepia offi cinalis we observed an antibacterial activity for the neuropeptide : H-ALSGDAFLRF-NH 2 (1). This decapeptide belonging to the FMRFamide family involved in regulation of reproduction and chromatophore function and is able to inhibit the growth of marine bacteria. Circular dichroism studies have revealed for this amphiphilic peptide a helical structuration in SDS micelles and in 50% TFE. To improve this antimicrobial activity, we fi rst introduce a Lysine residue instead of Aspartic residue, the antimicrobial activity of this new peptide has been improved by augmentation of the positive net charge (+1 to +3). Moreover preliminary results have shown that the incorporation of aza-3 -amino acids analogues could create original hybrid pseudopeptide with superior activity . The natural peptide is not effi cient against Staphylococcus aureus whereas the pseudopeptidic analogue revealed a Minimum Inhibiting Concentration (MIC) between 8-16 M. Therefore some -amino acids were replaced by aza-3 -amino acids. We will show in this communication that depending on the substituted residue and on the structuration, these modifi cations could lead either to no activity or to a drastic enhancement of the antimicrobial activity, demonstrating that aza-3 -amino acids can facilitate the burying in lipidic bilayer of antimicrobial peptides that acts on bacterial membranes(2) References: ",

Heterologous production of the lasso peptide in E. coli showed that the identifi ed genes are suffi cient for the biosynthesis of capistruin, which exhibits antimicrobial activity against closely related Burkholderia and Pseudomonas strains.

Until recently, little was known about the regulatory elements involved in the control of iron uptake and distribution within the body. The recently discovered peptide hepcidin has been shown to be a key regulator of iron metabolism within the body in response to a range of conditions, including infl ammation, hypoxia and anaemia (2) . This talk will focus on work towards elucidating structure/activity data for hepcidin with the aim of gaining a better undertstanding of the interaction between hepcidin and its receptor, ferroportin. We hope that this information will facilitate the design of synthetic agonists or antagonists of ferroportin to be used as potential drug leads. Three-dimensional structures of investigated analogues were determined using two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations with time-averaged restraints. The analysis of structural differences exhibited by different modifi cations provides the basis for understanding conformation -activity relationships and thereby the mechanism of interactions of the analogues with receptors.",

Its precursor encompasses several potential cleavage sites and thus may generate various mature peptides including an Nterminally extended form of 26RFa, termed 43RFa. Both peptides act as endogenous ligands of the G-protein coupled receptor GPR103. This receptor has been recently implicated in the bone metabolism regulation The determination of the 3D structure of such peptides is essential for the elucidation of their structure/function relationships and for the design of potent agonists or antagonists. Although structure elucidation of a ligand in the absence of the target receptor can deliver limited insight into the bioactive conformation, there is emerging evidence that interactions with the cell membrane is a key step required for receptor recognition. In this context, we have investigated the solution conformation of 26RFa and 43RFa by CD, NMR and Molecular Modelling in different media, in particular in one miming the \"free\" form of the molecule (methanol or mixture TFE/water) and in a cell membrane mimetic medium (DPC micelles). In an organic solvent, both peptides adopt the same conformation, i.e. an amphipathic alpha-helical structure, fl anked by two N-and C-terminal disordered regions. When bound to DPC micelles, the N-terminus remains fl exible and an helix is present at the same position as in the \"free\" form for both molecules. In contrast, the Cterminal extremity becomes structured adopting an inverse gamma-turn conformation. These data represent the fi rst step for the rational design of new molecules that might be used in the treatment of osteoporosis. Acknowledgements: Supports were obtained from INSERM and IFRMP 23.

We have also reported the synthesis of their analogues in order to investigate structure-activity relationship with respect to the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities (1). Here we report the activities of a few further analogues of one of the peptides called PMM (H-Ile-Asn-Trp-Lys-Lys-Ile-Ala-Ser-Ile-Gly-Lys-Glu-Val-Leu-Lys-Ala-Leu-NH2). The parent sequence or its truncated analogues were modifi ed on the N-terminus with 6-aminocaproic acid, glycolic acid, palmitoic acid, and 9-acridinyl and 9-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro)acridinyl groups. The new analogues were tested for their antimicrobial activity (determination of minimal inhibitory concentration values -MICusing broth dilution method) and hemolytic activity (determination of the IC50 value using suspension of rat erythrocytes). The palmitoylation unfortunately did not enhance antimicrobial activity against the tested microorganisms (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Substitution of amino acids Ser8 or Glu12 subsequently for alanine, serine or lysine did not infl uence the activity of the peptides signifi cantly. Gramicidin S, GS, c-(Val-Orn-Leu-D-Phe-Pro)2, was isolated from Bacillus brevis. It forms a two-stranded antiparallel -sheet fl anked by two II' -turns. It was found that the distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues on the opposite sides of the sheet is a structural feature required for GS antimicrobial (AM) activity. Despite its wide Gram+ and Gram-antimicrobial activity GS is useless in therapy because of its high hemotoxicity in humans. It was found, however, that the analogues of GS-14 (GS with Lys-Leu inserted into each strand) got more AM selective, when their amphipatic moments were perturbed by swapping adjacent Lys Leu/Val or confi guration reversal at Lys (1) . Here, we report on effects of similar perturbations put on GS original c-decapeptide, using the following examples: c-(Val-Lys-Leu-D-His-Pro)2, 1, 1. as the mother compound, and its three analogs, viz. c-(Val-D-Lys-Leu-D-His-Pro-Val-Lys-Leu-D-His-Pro) -Lys2 converted to D, c-(Lys-Val-Leu-D-His-Pro-Val-Lys-Leu-D-His-Pro) -Val1-Lys2 swapped, and c-(Val-Leu-Lys-D-His-Pro-Val-Lys-Leu-D-His-Pro) -Lys2-Leu3 swapped, 2-4; all having reduced ring-sequence symmetry. The peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods using 9-fl uorenylmetoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) methodology. Having solved their structures by 2D-NMR and having tested their activities/selectivities, we confi rmed that only 1 had relatively favorable bio-profi le, as already published (1) ",

It is insoluble in water, soluble in ethanol, methanol, DMSO, food oils. Cereulide exposure caused collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential in all tested human cells at low (ng/ml) exposure concentration (NK cells, T lymphocytes, Caco2, Calu3, neural Paju, Hela). Toxicity is caused by its action as ion carrier with a selectivity of K + : Na + = >1000 : 1. In various foods connected to human illness, concentrations of 0.01 to 3 g/g of cereulide were measured. In a case where the remains of a meal that had caused acute serious illness of two adult persons, were obtained for analysis, 1.3 g of cereulide was found /g of food. We undertook to explore the effects of purifi ed cereulide, and cereulide containing bacterial extracts, on porcine pancreatic islet cells in culture. Foetal porcine islet cells were exposed to heat killed extracts from food-borne B. cereus strains producing or not producing cereulide and to purifi ed cereulide. Effects were assayed using viability staining with fl uorochromes and cellular contents of DNA and insulin. Exposure to 1 ng/ml of purifi ed cereulide caused necrotic cell death of the islet cells impairing their insulin content within 2 days. Cell extracts of cereulide positive B. cereus strains connected to food poisoning or isolated from food items were toxic, corresponding to their measured cereulide content. Extracts of B. cereus strains producing or not producing the B. cereus diarrhoeal toxin, but not cereulide, were tolerated by the porcine islet cultures up to concentrations 1000 fold higher compared to extracts from strains containing cereulide, produced substance toxic towards porcine fetal Langerhans islets and beta cells.",

We focused on low molecular weight basic dendrimeric peptides, which mimic active conformations of recently discovered natural antimicrobial peptides. Structurally, natural compounds are linear cationic peptides consisting of 10-50 amino acids that kill a broad spectrum of microbes destabilizing ordered structure of their cell membrane. It is generally accepted that positive charge and an induced amphipathic conformation are necessary for their antimicrobial activity. The project is related to multi-drug resistance of numerous bacteria against conventional antibiotics and involves de novo design of 1-2 generation dendrimeric peptides, which mimic sequencerelated active conformations of natural compounds (non-sequential pharmacophore concept). Apparently, several groups of small peptide dendrimers were synthesized and structurally characterized (NMR, CD). They are potent antimicrobials, active against broad spectrum of species including MRSA and ESBL strains. Interactions between model membranes and peptide dendrimers of various structure will be discussed. Seawater desalination is most commonly done today by reverse osmosis (RO) using thin-fi lm composite membranes. A major problem in RO desalination is biofouling, caused by adhesion and growth of bacteria to form biofi lm on the membrane surface.",

In this study we screen AMPs capable of reducing biofi lm growth under conditions simulating seawater desalination, and search for mode of binding to the membrane without affecting the peptides bioactivity. A specifi c bioassay was developed for screening peptides activity in high salinity conditions in order to evaluate the inhibition of biofi lm growth, based on growing biofi lmforming bacteria in a 96-wells microtiter plate. We prepared various AMPs known from the literature by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) using Fmoc-chemistry. The bactericidal activity of AMPs was examined in fresh water and compared to high salinity water. Most AMPs lost their activity in high salinity conditions; yet, few peptides possessed their bactericidal activity and were used in subsequent experiments. Searching for mode of linkage was performed by evaluating the bactericide activity of AMPs modifi ed with numerous types of linker molecules. Based on literature studies that showed no decrease in bactericidal activity of AMPs upon N-terminal modifi cation, we prepared the corresponding peptides with modifi ed spacers on their amino-terminal and evaluated their antimicrobial activity in solution. Indeed, we obtained Gly 3 -spacers that retained activity, which were used subsequently as linkers to RO membranes. The mode of binding, as well as bactericide activity of the peptides and of the membranes will be presented and discussed. This study will lay the bases for a novel approach to decrease biofi lm formation on the surface of RO membranes during RO desalination.",

This effect can be attributed to the tripeptides. It has been suggested that one possible blood pressure lowering mechanism of the tripeptides could be angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. However, not all studies support this fi nding. The effect of tripeptides IPP and VPP on vascular function was investigated in vitro using rat mesenteric arteries. Superior mesenteric arteries isolated from male Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats were incubated in Krebs solution containing 1 mM of the peptide (either IPP or VPP) in +4 \u00baC for 48, 24, 12 or 1 h. After incubation mesenteric artery rings were mounted in an organ bath chamber and extensive vascular reactivity measurements were performed. Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation was better preserved (P < 0.05) in mesenteric arteries of both strains incubated with IPP or VPP compared to the control. Clear differences were not observed in sodium nitroprusside-induced endotheliumindependent relaxation. The ACE-inhibitory activity of IPP and VPP was studied by measuring the response to a single administration of angiotensin I and II in organ chambers. Proportioned to KCl-induced contraction, no clear reduction in angiotensin I -contraction was seen. Thus, ACE-inhibition may not be the main mechanism for the long-term effects of IPP and VPP in the protection of endothelial function. We suggest that the tripeptides do not affect smooth muscle but they protect endothelium during incubation indicated as preserved acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation.",

They all have certain conserved physical features including a net positive charge, contain approximately 50% hydrophobic amino acids and have sizes ranging from 12 to 50 amino acids. However, virtually any -sheet, loop including -helix, type of secondary structure can arise including -turn and extended. The multitude of cationic peptide sources, structures and a spectra of activity is matched by a number of complex and controversial models attempting to describe and explain their modes of action. Little is known about the sequence requirements of short host defense peptides like bactenecin (12mer). With help of our novel technique using a artifi cially created luminescence producing gram negative bacteria and peptide synthesis on cellulose we can investigate the sequence requirements of such peptides. Hundreds of peptides are tested for their ability to kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Complete substitutional analyses of different bactenecin variants as well as a semirandom peptide library with about 2000 members were measured. The complete substitutional analysis will give us information about the importance of each single position whereas the peptide library will give us broader information which composition of amino acids results in an active antimicrobial peptide. The data will be analyzed using the quantitative structureactivity relationship approach (QSAR) to identify sequence patterns that discriminate between superior activity cf. equivalently active and inactive. This will give us mechanistic cues for a better understanding of the mode of action of the short antimicrobial peptides. The results of these measurements and analyses will be discussed in detail. Here we propose a simple and rapid fl ow cytometric method to assess internalization of the peptides in bacteria. The method is based on the use of fl uorescently-labeled peptides and of the extracellular quencher Trypan Blue to discriminate between a cell surface and cytoplasmic localization of the tested molecules. To his aim, we used BODIPYlabeled peptides showing different modes of action. These included some fragments of Bac7, a proline-rich peptide known to penetrate bacterial and eukaryotic cells without membrane damage [1, 2] , and polymyxin B, a peptide antibiotic that binds to LPS and to the cell membranes. By using this approach coupled to fl ow cytometric analysis, we showed that the fl uorescence intensity of E. coli and S. typhimurium cells treated with sub-inhibitory BODIPY-Bac7 concentrations did not decrease despite extensive washing and addition of the quencher Trypan blue. In contrast, the fl uorescence of cells treated with BODIPY-polymyxin B, as well as that of bacteria treated with a fl uorescein-labeled anti LPS antibody, were promptly and almost totally quenched by addition of Trypan Blue, indicating their accessibility on the bacterial surface. These results confi rm the suitability of this method to rapidly infer the localization of labelled molecules in an accessible or inaccessible compartment of the treated bacterial cells. HP (2-20) is an antimicrobial peptide derived from the N-terminus of Helicobacter pylori Ribosomal Protein L1 (RPL1). In our previous study, several analogues of HP (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) , with amino acid substitutions that increased or decreased net hydrophobicity, were designed and showed that an analogue, A3 designed by substituting Gln and Asp with Trp at positions 17 and 19, respectively, caused increased antibacterial activity in minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) without having hemolytic activity. The peptide A3 acted also synergistically with known antibiotics including chloramphenicol against bacterial cells. Fluorescence activated fl ow cytometry showed that A3-treated cells had higher fl uorescence intensity than untreated cells, similar to that of melittin-treated cells. The peptide A3 showed a strong antimicrobial activity against antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa from otitis media, clinically isolated MRSA and VRSA including biofi lm-forming bacteria in vitro and in vivo. The ototoxicity of A3 was studied in vivo by topical application to the middle ear in guinea pig model. Twenty guinea pigs (5 groups, each group n=4) were each injected by transtympanic approach with 20ul of 8ug/ml,16ug/ml,32ug/ml, 128ug/ml of A3, and 0.4% gentamicin sulfate was instillated as a control. Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) to click were measured between 1st and 7th days after injection. Histologic investigation of cochlea was performed by scanning electron microscope and light microscope. The results showed that topical application of A3 to the middle ear is well tolerated without cochlear damage. The present study, therefore, demonstrates that the usefulness of antimicrobial peptides for multi-drug resistant bacteria including as a new ototopical agent for CRPA otitis media.",

Bacterial DNA gyrase is unique among the type II topoisomerase with ability to negatively supercoil DNA. The enzyme consists of two subunits, A (GyrA) and B (GyrB) and operates as an A 2 B 2 heterotetramer. The mechanism of the inhibition of the gyrase activity by CcdB is still an object of many debates, but is clear that R462 residue of GyrA and the C-terminus of CcdB (W99-I101) play a crucial role in the Gyrase-CcdB interactions. As an approach for a better understanding of this mechanism as well as for development of new gyrase inhibitors, we have synthesized peptide analogues of the CcdB protein and studied its activity by supercoiling assays and bacterial growth. Five fragments (CcdB ET1 , CcdB ET2 , CcdB ET3 , CcdB ET4 and CcdB SS1 ) of the natural CcdB were designed and synthesized by SPPS. For the design, we considered the 13 residue C-terminal -helix (residues E87 to W99), the loop that connects two strands of the wing sheet (residues R40 to L50) and an N-terminal region that includes the fi rst of the fi vestranded antiparallel -sheet. All peptides, except CcdB ET4 , showed inhibition of the supercoiling activity of the DNA gyrase, especially CcdB ET2 with a MIC = 15 M. Free Peptides not showed antimicrobial activity, but when encapsulated in Liposome (SUV) were able to inhibit the bacterial growth in liquid culture medium. The growth inhibition in vitro for CcdB ET2 was about 70% for Gram negative bacteria. Our fi ndings revealed a novel synthetic inhibitor of DNA gyrase and CcdB ET2 analogue is a good starting point for the development of a new and specifi c class of antibacterial agents based in the DNA gyrase inhibition.

The aims of this work were to improve a methodology of GPs synthesis and to study cytoprotective properties of some new GPs in culture of neuronal cells. GPs with a common structure (GP)n, (PG)n, and (PGP)n (n=1-3) were synthesised by consecutive growing of peptide chain and fragment's condensation. Synthesised peptides were characterised by HPLC, mass-spectrometry, element analysis etc. Cytoprotective activity of GPs was assessed on an increase of survival of cultivated \u00d0\u00d112 cells after \u00cd 2 \u00ce 2 -induced oxidative stress. It was shown, that from all tested peptides only (GP)n and PGP reveal cytoprotective activity. At the concentration 100 M these peptides reduced an amount of damaged cells 1.7-2.0 times in comparison to the control. Thus preliminary data received show that some GPs demonstrate a strong cytoprotective activity and therefore it is advisably to put them on further study on in vivo models. In preliminary investigations we found that all the peptides inhibited to a high degree the replication of HSV-1 in Vero cells. Moreover, these compounds did not show any cytotoxic activity against the Vero cells.",

The HLDF-6 peptide was shown to render protective infl uence directly on primary culture of hippocampal and cerebellar neurones, isolated from newborn male brain, under conditions of the beta-amyloid toxicity. Protective action of HLDF-6 peptide on newborn rat-male neurons is connected with Poster abstracts its ability to reduce 5-alpha reductase mRNA expression in more than 30 times, blocking testosterone metabolism into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and thus interfering hyper activation of NMDA receptors in CA1 areas of hippocampus. The protective action of HLDF-6 peptide was investigated also and on female-rats with experimental Alzheimer's disease. It was shown, that in contrast to males at which both forms of memory are broken: and long-term and working ones, in the case of females, injections of A (25-35) + ibotenic acid result in infringement of only working memory, at safety of long-term memory. Introduction of HLDF-6 peptide restored the broken working memory at females as effectively, as at males. However the mechanism of protective action of peptide on primary culture of hippocampal and cerebellar neurones, isolated from newborns female-rat brain, is connected not with the decrease in hyper activation of NMDA receptors, but with ABAD (17 beta-hydroxysteroiddehydrohenase of the 10th type) mRNA expression enhancement which is a target of beta-amyloid peptide action and blocking of progesterone conversion into 5 alpha-dihydroprogesteron due to 5-alpha-reductase mRNA expression inhibition.",

We systematically incorporated internal hydrophobic residues for a cationic, helical amphipathic structure effective for its high antimicrobial activity. It is also modifi ed C-terminally by a dehydro Leucine residue effective for its structural stability. The synthesis of dehydro amino acid was done by solution phase and other amino acids were coupled by solid phase peptide synthesis method. Anti-bacterial activity of the peptide was done by standard micro broth dilution technique against clinical isolates of GPC including methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), HLAR, Group A and Group B Streptococci cultured from pus, wound and throat swab. All these isolates were known to be responsible for nosocomially acquired infections. S. aureus ATCC 25023 was used as quality control strain. Invivo effi cacy of this peptide was also tested in a mouse model with epidermal lesions caused by MRSA. The MIC obtained for the peptide was 10 g/ml (average) for the tested strains. The peptide showed no hemolytic activity against human red blood cell. In the invivo studies the healing was induced early (after 72 hrs total healing was seen) in the experimental animals.

Inhibition of this process can be achieved by RGD peptide analogues that bind to \u00e1 \u00c9\u00c9b 3 receptor. However, this class of inhibitors upon binding to receptor cause an outside-in signaling which induces a further activation of the platelet.

The strain BMB4 was identifi ed as Acremonium exuviarum based on morphology, ITS sequence, and cycloheximide resistance. MS/MS analysis showed that acrebol is a mixture of two almost identical peptaibols composed of 16-17 amino acid residues with masses 1726 and 1740 Da, AcePhe-Iva/Val-Gln-Aib-Ile-Thr-Leu-Aib-Pro-Aib-Gln-Pro-Aib and AcePhe-Iva/Val-Gln-Aib-Ile-Thr-Leu-Val-Pro-Aib-Gln-Pro-Aib, respectively. The C-termini of the peptaibols was SerOH however the sequence (mass of 216 Da) between b13 and SerOH could not be interpreted. Both isoforms of acrebol had a strong toxic effect on boar spermatozoa, feline fetus lung cells, murine neuroblastoma, and mouse insulinoma MIN 62 cells. We found that, unlike other peptaibols, acrebol in toxic concentrations did not increase the ionic and solute permeability of membranes of isolated rat liver mitochondria. Acrebol did not disturb the ionic homeostasis and osmotic balance of mitochondria and induced no release of apoptogenic proteins (cytochrome c) from the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Acrebol strongly inhibited complex III of the respiratory chain (IC 50 ~ 110 ng/ml), presumably, the outer quinone-binding center and, similarly to myxothiazol but in contrast to antimycin A, decreased the production of superoxide anion in the outer compartments of mitochondria. In the boar spermatozoa, acrebol, blocking the respiratory chain, caused the ATP depletion due to the oligomycin-sensitive reversion of the reaction of ATP synthesis, which resulted in the inhibition of progressive movement. Acrebol induced necrosis-like death of mouse insulinoma",

            "text": "Identifi cation, chemical synthesis, and antimicrobial activity of TBD-1 -the fi rst -defensin isolated from reptiles Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and proteins have been discovered in single and multicellular organisms indicating the importance of this peptide class for the innate immune system. AMPs are active against bacteria, fungi and viruses by affecting either the microbial cytoplasmic membrane, thus increasing its permeability or interacting with specifi c targets. Defensins form one of the major subfamilies of AMPs, among which -and -defensins play a signifi cant role in bridging innate and adaptive immunity in mammals. The cationic -defensins are cysteine-rich and vary in length from 36 to 44 residues. The -stranded structure of -defensins is stabilized by a characteristic arrangement of three conserved disulfi de bonds between cysteines 1-5, 2-4, and 3-6. Although -defensins lyse the bacterial membrane at higher concentrations it has been shown that they modulate also the immune system, e.g. being chemotactic for T-cells. We have isolated a novel 40mer -defensin called TBD-1 from leukocytes of the European pond turtle and deduced its complete sequence de-novo by combining different tandem mass spectrometry techniques (MALDI, ESI; CID and ETD) and Edman degradation. It was also possible to identify the disulfi de pattern in a tryptic digest by MALDI-mass spectrometry. The deduced peptide sequence was afterwards confi rmed by solid phase peptide synthesis. Thus two fragments were synthesized by standard Fmoc/ t Bu chemistry using three orthogonal cysteine protecting groups (Trt, Acm, tBu) to selectively form the right disulfi de bridges. After native chemical ligation of the two peptide fragments the fi rst two cysteines were oxidized on air followed by iodide oxidation for the second and DMSO oxidation for the third disulfi de bridge. In antimicrobial activity assays, TBD-1 synthesized in -conformation was active against Gram-positve, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi similar to the native peptide. Trichogin GA IV (TrGA), an antimicrobial peptide of the lipopeptaibol family, continues to reveal peculiar properties since the time of its former identifi cation by Rebuffat and coworkers. X-Ray diffraction studies showed that TrGA is folded in a mixed 310/a-helix conformation, while NMR, CD and IR absorption experiments proved that this structure is predominantly populated in solution, although more disordered structures contribute to the conformational landscape of TrGA. We have recently shown by time-resolved experiments, that an equilibrium between helical conformers and more compact, folded conformers takes place in solution, with interesting transition dynamics in the microsecond time scale. In our conformational studies on TrGA we realized that the 3D geometry of the peptide chain reproduces the structural environment of the ion coordination site of Calcium-binding proteins. This fi nding urged us to investigate the binding properties of TrGA with respect to Ca(II), Gd(III) and Tb(III), because lanthanide ions have been widely employed in biochemical studies as best substitutes of Ca(II). The binding of Ca(II), Gd(III) and Tb(III) to TrGA gives rise to a conformational transition, monitored by CD spectra at different ionpeptide molar concentration ratios. At high r values, the CD curves of all the ion-peptide complexes show a positive maximum at ~214nm, typical of type II turns, suggesting the population of bent structures. The quasi-isodichroic point found for all systems between 198 and 202 nm, indicates that an equilibrium between extended helical and bent conformations actually takes place. Fluorescence experiments on the Tb(III)/TrGA adduct have shown that, upon ion binding, the fl uorescence quantum yield of Tb(III) markedly increases, due to the release of water molecules from the ion coordination inner shell. Molecular dynamics calculations on the peptide/Ca(II) adduct were also performed to obtain structural and dynamical information. Antibiotic resistant bacterial strains represent a global health problem with a strong social and economic impact. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action. Castros group isolated and determined the sequence of the peptide Hy-a1 (IFGAILPLALGALKNLIK) of skin secretion from the frog Hypsiboas albopunctatus which showed antimicrobial activity. The aim of the present work was evaluated 4 analogues to supply information Poster abstracts about the relationship structure-biological activity. The peptides were synthesized by SPPS using the Fmoc chemical approach. The biological activities were assayed by measuring growth inhibition of two types of Gram-positive bacteria and others two types of Gram-negative. The synthesis and purifi cation of peptides by HPLC was effi cient and a high purity level (96%) was obtained. The peptide containing Trp in position 6 (for fl uorescent studies) replacing Leu presented MIC values comparable to wild type sequence: 32 uM, 32 uM, 8 uM and 2 uM for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and B. subtilis, respectively. Two peptides with this modifi cation but containing at the N-terminal region one group acetyl or a residue of Asp showed MIC values of 128 uM for E. coli and P. aeruginosa, although 4 uM for Gram-positive bacteria. Different results were observed when the residue added was Lys. In this case, the activity against whole bacteria was sustained or increased. Conformational properties were investigated by CD techniques in water, TFE and in zwitterionic micelles (LPC). The CD experiments demonstrated that in water, the peptides have a random structure, but in TFE and LPC solutions they acquired an ordered structure, composed mainly by -helix. However, these data there is no relationship between the structure and activity against bacteria Gram-positive. These results showed that the N-terminal region of the peptide Hy-a1 develop key roles in its antibacterial action different types of bacteria. 4 ",

PRAMPs are thought to act in a permeabilization-independent manner, via energydependent internalization into bacteria followed by recognition and inactivation of internal molecular targets. With the aim of investigating their mode of action, we have isolated a number of E. coli clones showing increased resistance to the bovine proline-rich peptide Bac7 after transformation with a DNA library from Bac7-resistant mutants. Among the recombinant plasmids responsible for resistance, some of them harboured the gene coding for the oligopeptidase B (OpdB), a serine peptidase belonging to the prolyl oligopeptidase family (POP) broadly distributed among unicellular eukaryotes and Gram-negative bacteria, which has emerged as an important virulence factor. OpdB was cloned and expressed under the control of an inducible promoter and the transformants tested for susceptibility to a panel of antimicrobial peptides, including PRAMPs. Olipopeptidase activity of purifi ed OpdB was then tested in vitro against the same peptides. The results indicate that the clones overexpressing OpdB are more resistant to the PRAMPs and that the degree of resistance correlates with the expression level of OpdB. In addition, in vitro incubation of PRAMPs with the purifi ed peptidase, followed by mass spectrometry analysis, showed that it promptly hydrolyzes all the peptides assayed to short, inactive fragments. These results suggest that OpdB may contribute to cleavage and inactivation of antimicrobial peptides that are internalized into the target cells and support the notion that OpdB is a novel virulence factor.",

Studies on synthetic analogues demonstrated that substitution of the C-terminal leucinol by Leu-OMe, or substitution of one Aib residues by the EPR label TOAC do not perturb signifi cantly the biological activity of the peptide. On the other hand, removal of 3 or 7 N-terminal residues eliminated any antibacterial activity. Finally, studies of proteolytic degradation on trichogin GA IV and analogues where the 3 Aib residues are replaced by Leu demonstrated that the presence of several non-coded Aib residues endows the natural peptaibol with remarkable resistance to proteolysis.

The high affi nity interaction between INSL5 and the receptor RXFP4 (GPCR142) coupled with their apparent co-evolution and partially overlapping tissue expression patterns strongly suggest that INSL5 is an endogenous ligand for RXFP4.

Little, however, is known about in vivo effects of CRF-derived peptides. This study was aimed to investigate possible actions of a tripeptide CRF fragment 4-6 Pro-Pro-Ile (PPI). Tripeptide PPI was found to exert effects similar to fullsize CRF molecule after central administration. The tripeptide induces behavioral activation in home cage, but inhibits behavioral activity under stressful conditions. PPI increases blood pressure and heart rate, blood glucose level and body temperature, decreases pain sensitivity, increases EEG amplitude and large doses of PPI induce seizures. PPI inhibits sexual motivation and performance in mating tests in males. CRF antagonist -helical CRF 9-41 abolishes PPI infl uence on circulatory system, glucose metabolism, thermoregulation and pain sensitivity. Adrenalectomy does not interfere with hyperglycemic and hyperthermic actions of PPI, while pancreatectomy prevents hyperglycemic effect. Nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker obsidan prevents hyperglycemic and decreases hyperthermic effects of the tripeptide and ganglionic blocker hexamethonium abolishes both effects. Taken together effects of PPI correspond to stress-reactions, involving corticotropin-releasing factor and evidence that PPI is either 1) a part of a CRF molecule active site, or 2) physiologically active CRF derivative, realizing its effects through activation of CRF receptors, or 3) an independent regulator, affecting CRF-ergic neurons.

To date, inhibitors of beta-aggregate and fi bril formation have been polyphenols, mutants of hAM, or short peptide related to the hAM(22-29) sequence, NFGAILSS. We now report that stable beta-hairpin scaffolds displaying Trp and Tyr residues are effective inhibitors, delaying the onset of both the CD changes associated with beta structure formation and the nucleation time and net enhancement of the fl uorescence observed with added Thiofl avin-T (ThT). Under our test conditions (8 microM hAM, 2% HFIP in 5mM phosphate buffer, pH 7), hAM begins to display an increase in beta structure by CD at 40 min with a constant maximal value from 85 -220 min. ThT fl uorescence also indicates a circa 50 min onset time with a rapid (<20 min) rise to the full response. Inhibition (delayed onset and reduction in the maximal fl uorescence enhancement) has been observed with a number of hairpins; those with two Trp residues on a single face of the hairpin are more potent. Of these, our best inhibitor to date, KKLTVWIpGKWITVSA (p = D-Pro), increases the onset time more than 2-fold at equimolar concentrations. At 4 molar equiv., the onset time is greater than 320 min and ThT fl uorescence levels out at < 40% of the control value. In analogy to the report by Prof. Ghosh (JACS 2006, p. 14456) that a beta-sheet protein with added Tyr and Trp residues inhibits fi bril formation by the Alzheimer-related Abeta peptide; we expect that designed beta-hairpin scaffolds will be more generally applicable and will afford new insights into the recognition phenomena of amyloidogenesis.",

The stability and the activity of these replicators depend on the characteristics of the amino acid residues in the recognition interface. It has been suggested that it is possible to control protein structure and the replication process by external triggers such as light, and that the light can also be used to monitor the conformational changes and/or to follow the protein functionality(3). We show here our ability to control the folding stability of coiled coil peptides and their reversible or irreversible self replication effi ciency by light, and we demonstrate the possibility to exploit FRET couples to facilitate in-situ monitoring of the folding and reactivity. We use 'caged' mutants with a photo-switchable molecule in the recognition interface of the peptidewhich disrupts its coiled coil structure -as inactive species. Deprotection of the caged proteins is used as a mechanism to restore the self replication process. The ligation is followed by monitoring the changes in fl uorescence of either the Donor or Acceptor of the FRET couple. We will describe synthesis and structural characterization of caged and cage-free peptides and measurements that show, as expected, that the cage free peptides are more stable as coiled coils and better catalyst for their own formation than the caged analogs.

The -sheet breaking effect does not work up to an A peptide-small peptide ratio of 1:10. As a consequence, these compounds are not -sheet breakers, only they modify the surface of A fi brils and rather speed up the formation of -sheet structure. ",

Interactions between cationic or anionic porphyrins and polypeptide templates with charges that are opposite to those of porphyrins have been extensively investigated for their possible applications in biomedicine and photodynamic therapy (PDT). The infl uence of porphyrin on the conformation of the peptide part of the complexes is studied in this work. Non-covalent interactions of cationic tripeptide L-lysyl-L-alanyl-Lalanine (KAA) with anionic meso-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porph yrin (TPPS) and its copper(II) (without axial ligand), iron(III) (one axial ligand), and manganese(III) (two axial ligands) derivatives were investigated in aqueous solutions by vibrational (VCD) and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopies. Although both the CD spectroscopies are sensitive to conformation, particularly VCD is extremely sensitive to subtle conformational changes. The VCD spectra of pure KAA in the amide I' (C=O stretch vibration) region showed the spectral patterns typical for left-handed Polyproline II helical conformation (PPII). Interaction of KAA with non-metallated TPPS was accompanied by change of the amide I' VCD patterns -loss of VCD intensity and arising of a new negative band at ~1630 cm -1 -that was interpreted as a partial change of PPII into less compact conformation as extended helix or -sheet segment. In case of Cu(II)-and Fe(III)-TPPS, the loss of the amide I' VCD intensity of KAA was observed only. For Mn(III)-TPPS having two axial ligands, the VCD pattern was unchanged compared to the pure tripeptide indicating that this derivative is not able to change the conformation of KAA in peptide-porphyrin complex.",

They are able to interact with negatively charged functional groups of many biologically important molecules as DNA, polyuronic acids, and porphyrins and thus infl uence a broad range of biological functions. In this work, the solution conformation of synthetic oligotripeptides (Llysyl-L-alanyl-L-alanine) n [n = 1, 2, 3] was investigated at the different temperatures and pH using combination of vibrational (VCD) and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopies. VCD spectra of all the oligopeptides measured at room temperature show a negative couplet (positive to lower frequency) in amide I' region. This spectral pattern is indicative of left-handed Polyproline II helical conformation (PPII), which is stable at wide range of pH. The temperature dependence of the VCD spectra indicates that PPII conformation of all the oligopeptides remains stable even at 90\u00b0C, independently on length of oligopeptide chain. These results were confi rmed by temperature dependent ECD experiments, where the characteristic negative and positive bands at about 195 and 220 nm, respectively, were observed. Taken together, VCD and ECD results suggest that PPII conformation of (Lys-Ala-Ala) n sequence is the dominant conformation within the range of temperature from 20 to 90\u00b0C. All the results including spectral data analysis are discussed in detail. Acknowledgment: The work was supported by the research grant 203/06/P371 from the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic.

To extend the fi eld of -peptides towards the construction of possible new secondary structures, the replacement of the C and C atoms of the -amino acid with heteroatoms could be an attractive modifi cation, for example C -atom of -peptides by an NR moiety, leading to hydrazine peptides. In the literature, there are only a few studies about hydrazine peptides [1] [2] [3] , and hydrazine peptides with cyclic side-chain have not been studied yet. In order to determine the secondary structure preference of H-[(cis or trans)-ACPC-2S-aza-ACPC] 3 -NH 2 peptides (Figure 1 ), their potential energy hypersurface were probed at the ab initio B3LYP/6-311G** level. The cis (1R,2S) formed 10/12-helices, while the opposite ACPC enantiomer resulted 6 strand. The trans (1S,2S) formed 8-strand, while the opposite ACPC enantiomer resulted 12-helix. The hybrid-peptides in question were synthetized on solid support, and their high-resolution 3D assignments were made by using NMR, which was supported by ECD, VCD, QLS and TEM methods. The hydrazino modifi cation resulted in better water solubility than that of the ACPC homooligomers. This result is very important concerning the further biological applicability. ",

We have shown that the conformational response of the peptide in such systems is critically dependent on the manner of attachment of the cross-linker as well as the cross-linker structure. Cross-linkers can be introduced in which trans-to-cis photoisomerization leads of formation of helical structure, or conversely to loss of helical structure. These effects can be understood in a semi-quantitative manner by calculating the degree of mismatch between the steric requirements of the linker and the conformational ensemble of the peptide. Kinetic studies reveal that in general photoisomerization of the linker is fast (several ps) whereas subsequent peptide folding or unfolding occurs over hundreds of microseconds. Such cross-linkers are thus potentially useful phototriggers for studying protein folding processes, as well as for controlling the equilibrium stability of different conformational states. Applications to photo-control of bioactive peptides and proteins will be discussed.",

However, the Kampo medicines consist of several herbs, whose pharmacological mechanism is not clear. In western medical science, medical doctors usually treat patients according to disease diagnosis. In eastern medical science, treatment is based on diagnostics called gsho h, which is a unique concept in Kampo medicines and quite different from diagnosis. The concept of gsho h is diffi cult for non-professionals to understand, furthermore, there are responders and non-responders when nonprofessionals prescribe Kampo medicines. The concept of gsho h focuses on individuals, not diseases, therefore, it is diffi cult to gain a given effect for everyone by general clinical trials. In this study, we investigated the effects of prokinetic Kampo medicines on plasma levels of gut-regulatory peptides (somatostatin, motilin and gastrin) and compared with that of dopamine receptor antagonists, the western prokinetics. The fi ve Kampo medicines, including Pinelliae Tuber and Zingiberis Rhizoma, three dopamine receptor antagonists or placebo was orally administered. Venous blood samples were taken before and till 240 min after administration. Plasma peptide levels were measured using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay. The dopamine receptor antagonists and Kampo medicines caused signifi cant increase of plasma gut-regulatory peptide levels compared with placebo group. In recent years, chronic hypofunction without mechanical problem, such as non-erosive refl ux disease and functional dyspepsia, is diffi cult to cure using western medicines. The preliminary study indicated the plasma somatostatin levels of patients with any symptoms are high and plasma motilin levels of them are low compared with those of healthy subjects. To evaluate Kampo medicines using bioactive peptides as biomarkers, it may be possible to cure diseases that is diffi cult to treat by western medicines.",

Several short -MSH peptides carrying a DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10tetraacetic acid) metal chelator were designed and evaluated as potential diagnostic (e.g. with 111In, 67,68Ga) or therapeutic (e.g. 90Y, 67Cu) radiopharmaceuticals. The analogs tested to date showed high affi nity for the MC1-R in vitro, excellent internalization into the tumor cells, as well as a good incorporation in tumor xenografts and a low uptake in normal tissues in vivo, except the kidneys where considerable uptake is observed. Our current studies attempt to infl uence the pharmacokinetic parameters in order to address specifi c uptake (i.e. by melanoma) versus non-specifi c uptake (i.e. by the kidneys). As glycosylation had been shown to improve tumor-to-kidney ratios in the case of somatostatin and to reduce peptide re-uptake by the tubular system of the kidneys in general, we investigated glycosylated analogs of [Nle4, Asp5, D-Phe7]--MSH4-11 (NAPamide). Carbohydrate moieties such as glucose, galactose and maltotriose were introduced at various positions on the MSH peptide carrying the metal chelator DOTA for labeling with 111In. The peptides were evaluated in vitro in both murine and human cell lines for MC1-R binding and cellular localization, and in vivo in B16F1 tumor-bearing mice for tissue distribution. The tumor-to-kidney ratio for Gal-NAPamide (4-48 h AUCs) was superior to any of the previously published MSH peptides. Other glycopeptides showed very good binding affi nities but lower selectivity in vivo. In additional, a series of non-glycosylated dimeric derivatives, bearing one or two moieties of the chelator complex, were developed which displayed excellent receptor affi nity but tended to result in higher kidney accumulation. By contrast, at least one negatively charged DOTA-NAPamide showed excellent tumor-to-kidney ratios.",

Early diagnosis does enable treatment of less severe disease states, the use of less invasive techniques and could potentially reduce the costs of healthcare systems. However, it is most likely that peptides in tissue or blood -or their modifi cations -can be specifi cally associated with different disease states. The discovery and verifi cation/ validation of such disease markers are two distinct workfl ows. During the discovery phase, a relatively small number of samples with a high number of potential biomarker candidates are screened. The highthroughput provided by the iTRAQ\u2122 reagent strategy allows for simultaneous analysis of such samples. Once biomarker candidates have been identifi ed with initial statistical signifi cance, these have to be validated. This validation workfl ow involves analyzing a large number of samples with a relatively small number of candidates to establish the biological signifi cance of the biomarker candidates. Rather than switching to immunological techniques for this validation step, we suggest a mass spectrometry based approach. This orthogonal strategy is a novel targeted, high throughput quantitative multiplexed multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) approach. The approach relies on assay development using a combination of MRMs to target specifi c peptides identifi ed in discovery, followed by MS/MS to confi rm that the quantitative MRM signal results from the target peptide. In addition to being a quantitative method, this validation approach is extremely specifi c and sensitive.

The side effects related to the treatments that are available today have a great infl uence on the patients' quality of life. Therefore, the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies may have an important impact in the outcome of these cancers. Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptors are present in high quantities in a variety of cancers, prostate and breast tumors among them. Targeting of over-expressed GRP receptors with radiolabeled bombesin (BBS) analogues would offer an interesting tool for tumor imaging and therapy, depending on the radionuclide used. Some analogues of BBS, based on the fragment 7-14, were functionalized with the (N His)chelator for labeling with the 99m Tc-and 188 Re-tricarbonyl-core. Despite an increased metabolic stability, these analogues showed very low tumor uptake. Additional insertion of a Ala-Ala linker led to increased tumor uptake but still unfavorable in vivo properties. In order to further improve the biodistribution, novel polar linkers with different charge were introduced in the molecule. A positive charge resulted in increased kidney uptake, whereas one single negative charge led to a signifi cant increase in the tumor uptake and also signifi cantly higher tumor-totissue ratios. Co-injection with natural BBS importantly inhibited the uptake in the tumors and receptor-expressing tissues, which confi rmed the specifi city of the in vivo uptake. Moreover, imaging of the tumor xenografts by SPECT/CT was also much clearer with the analogues bearing one negative charge. Additional negative charges, however, resulted in a loss of binding affi nity and internalization, and unfavorable biodistribution. In conclusion, BBS analogues with one single charge in the linker hold a greater potential for imaging and therapy of GRP receptor-overexpressing tumors",

Formerly we obtained peptide derivatives of ML in which the peptide part modelled a growing chain, while an antibiotic moiety served as an \"anchor\" for positioning the peptide in the RT. The goal of this study was to synthesise tryptophan-containing peptide derivatives of 5-Omycaminosyltylonolide (OMT) to monitor location of the specifi c Trp binding site that modulate the activity of the peptidyl transferase centre of the ribosome. The peculiarity of compounds designed in this study lies in that of a Trp containing peptide fragment, connected to the primary hydroxyl group in position C23 of OMT, is oriented in the RT towards the hypothetical Trp binding site. The following peptides were used: Boc-L-Trp-Gly-OH, Boc-L-Trp-Ala-OH, Boc-L-Trp-Abu-OH, Boc-L-Trp-Ape-OH.

It is the most abundant neuropeptide in the brain and triggers a number of central activities, such as regulation of food intake as well as stress induced reactions [2] [3] [4] . NPY forms a selective interaction with at least three receptors, which are called Y1, Y2 and Y5. In the past it was shown that Y1-receptors are overexpressed in >90% of all breast tumors as well as in 100% of the derived metastases. Normal breast tissue expresses Y2-receptors, while the neoplastic tissue expresses Y1-receptors 5.. As a result, the NPY-Y1-receptor system can be used for tumor targeting and therapy. In the fi rst step we synthesized the truncated and modifi ed NPY analogue [Pro30,Nle31,Bpa32,Leu34 ]NPY(28-36) (Nle-norleucine; Bpa-benzoyl-phenylalanine) by solid Bioactive peptides phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc/tBu strategy. The NPY analogue was characterized with respect to in vitro binding affi nity and selectivity at Y1-receptor expressing human breast cancer MCF-7 cells and the metabolic stability in human blood plasma, respectively. Then we coupled different potential chelators to [Pro30,Nle31,Bpa32,Leu34]NP Y(28-36), which was N-terminally modifi ed by two \u00df-alanines as spacer between the peptide sequence and the chelator. Next, we determined their ability of metal conjugation of diverse metals, as Cu2+ and Re3+. Metal conjugated peptides were characterized by Maldi-ToF-MS (matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry), RP-HPLC (reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography) and IR-Spectroscopy (infrared). After optimization of the metal conjugation fi rst binding affi nity studies were performed. 2 chain is mainly expressed in skeletal muscles and peripheral nerves, and interacts with cell surface receptors such as integrin, dystroglycan, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Biological functions of the laminin 2 chain N-terminus including integrin binding and heparin/heparan sulfate binding were found previously. Here, we focused on the N-terminal region of the mouse laminin 2 chain (position 1-1566) and screened the biologically active sequences using 142 peptides. The synthetic peptides were generally 12 amino acids in length and overlapped with neighboring peptides by 4 amino acids. Cell attachment activity of the peptides was evaluated using a peptide-coated plastic plate assay and a peptide-conjugated Sepharose bead assay using HT-1080 human fi brosarcoma cells. Eleven peptides showed cell attachment activity on plate assay and fi ve peptides showed cell attachment activity on beads assay. Previously we screened active sites on the laminin 1 chain and identifi ed several active sequences. When we compared with active sequences of the 1 and 2 chains, A2-31 (YYDETVASRNLSLN) and A2-112 (GGKLKYAIYFEA) are unique active peptides only within laminin 2 chain. These results suggest that the biological activity of A2-31 and A2-112 are 2 chain specifi c and are useful for investigating the 2 chain specifi c functions of laminin 2 chain.",

The identifi cation of ligands from large biological libraries by phage display has now been used for almost 15 years. In a last few years several improvements have led to numerous high affi nity peptide ligands that express various biological activities. Phage-displayed peptide libraries have been used successfully to isolate peptide ligands directed to a functional site for which the natural ligand is or is not a protein or peptide. By using a modifi ed, in-house developed selection proctocol, we successfully selected several phage clones with high affi nity to pancreatic lipase, ghrelin and cysteine protease cathepsin K as target proteins. Based on their deduced animoacid sequences, twenty heptapeptides with the highest affi nity to target proteins were synthesized and characterized for their capacity to inhibit enzyme or acceptor function. The most succesful peptide candidates inhibited pancreatic liapase with the apparent inhibition constant of 16 uM, and cathepsin K with the apparent inhibition constant of 0,10 uM. A set of 22 peptidomymetic compounds were sinthesyzed based on the aminoacid sequence of selected peptides and their inhibitory activity was determined.

Several rounds of screening are performed, until the increase in phage output, or binding assays performed with phage pools, indicate that the population of binding phages has been adequately enriched. In cases where ligands of particular target are not known or available, targetbound virions are released by non-specifi c elution for example with acidic buffer, or competitively with free target molecule, or by addition of bacterial host directly to the target-bound phages. We used streptavidin, immobilized by adsorption, as a model target protein for affi nity selection of peptides from phage display library. The effi ciencies of a number of well-known typically used non-specifi c elution strategies in selecting and retrieving a phage clone displaying the tripeptide biotin mimetic (HPQ) from a streptavidin coated surface were compared. All the commonly used elution strategies have failed to elute and select high affi nity HPQ-bearing phage clones bound to streptavidin. The failure was shown to be due to the inability of eluants to break the interaction of high affi nity clones with the target, which is thus likely to be the cause for failed selection with other targets also. To surmount this, we have introduced a new elution strategy, combining low pH elution buffer with sonication which, in addition to loosening the peptidetarget interaction, also serves to detach the target molecule from the immobilization surface. This ultrasound-based method enabled single step selection of a high affi nity peptide from a library of diversity greater than 10 9 , and thus represents a dramatic improvement in searching for novel, specifi c peptide ligands. apoptosis to various tumor cells but not in normal cells.

Then, peptides of stronger effects were found through amino acid substitution, and the CNSCWSKD peptide induced >90% cell death in treated cells. Features of apoptosis, such as DNA fragmentation, activation of caspase, phosphatidylserine externalization, chromatin condensation, and competition with TRAIL for binding to the death receptor (DR) 4 or DR5 were observed, suggesting that this peptide is a TRAIL mimic. Caspase-3 activation was observed in various tumor cells treated with this peptide as well as with TRAIL, while no activation was observed in human normal fi broblasts.

Recently, there was an upsurge in the development of exendin-4 mimetic as potential therapy for type 2 diabetes. In this study, a receptor-binding region on the surface of RINm5F cell was used as the target to screen peptide ligands for the receptor in a phage 12-mer peptide library. DNA sequencing revealed a group of closely related peptides from the fourth round of selection. Through the activity of decreasing blood glucose assay in vivo, the cell proliferation assay and capability against DPPIV in vitro, one highest bioactivity peptide (QPSVGMKPSPRH, Ex-12PA) was acquired. The bioactivity of Ex-12PA was almost identical with exendin-4 on the promoting cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The decreasing blood glucose effect of Ex-12PA was up to 45 min after administration. The stability against DPPIV of Ex-12PA maintained good performance that 35% parent peptide remained after 48h.

Therefore, continuous development of antibacterial agents with completely novel modes of action accompanied by rationalization of chemotherapeutic prescription is the key strategy to adopt in a long-run struggle against the growing problem of pathogen resistance. Numerous indispensable antibiotics interfere with peptidoglycan cell wall biosynthesis making this unique metabolic pathway a well validated target for antimicrobials. While nearly all of these antibiotics inhibit late stages of murein synthesis occurring on the extracellular side of plasma membrane, initial cytoplasmic steps have not been extensively exploited as drug targets. We have performed affi nity selections from random linear and conformationally constrained (disulphide cyclized) peptide libraries displayed on bacteriophage particles against two essential bacterial enzymes MurD and MurE, involved in the cytoplasmic synthesis of peptidoglycan monomer precursor. Selected peptides were found to inhibit respective targets in an in vitro assay with IC 50 values of 140 M to 1.5 mM. Reported inhibitory peptides should be regarded as templates for design of low-molecular-weight peptidomimetics.

The CC is composed of at least two right-handed amphipathic a-helices that wrap around each other into a left-handed supercoil such that their hydrophobic surfaces are in contact. CC can associate up to heptamers, form homomeric and heteromeric complexes at different stoichiometries, and be aligned parallel and antiparallel. A characteristic of all coiled coils is the presence of heptad repeat sequences [abcdefg]i, where i denotes the heptad number. Although CC motifs can be predicted with a high degree of confi dence, predicting the association states and topologies is still a great challenge. We will report on synthetic peptide arrays useful to study CC associations at the amino acid level. In contrast to rational design, which mostly depends on short model peptides, our approach relies on the full-length homodimeric GCN4 -and the heteromeric cJun/cFos coiled-coil domain formation. The infl uence of amino acid substitutions on association is tested without restrictions and presumptions and the stoichiometry is examined by biophysical methods. Furthermore, we generate arrays comprising hundreds of (putative) CC sequences and subsequently probe them for association to a set of several native CC sequences. An interactome can be drawn for each of the investigated CC sequences, enabling one to interpret the biological functions. We will present: (i) association analyses of all single substitution variants of the GCN4-, cFos and cJun leucine zipper probed with the associated native leucine zipper; (ii) the exposure of a heteromeric CC-network deduced from GCN4 variants and the determination of the networkstoichiometry; (iii) the CC-interactom of several native coiled coils like the CC sequences of AKAP 18 , PQBP1 18, Orai1 and others. Almost two decades ago we used the spatial screening technology to optimize activity and receptor subtype selectivity among RGD recognizing integrins. This culminated in the avb3 selective superactive pentapeptide c(-RGDfV-) which gave rise to a number of peptidomimetic modifi cations. Among them we studied all retro-, inverso-and retroinverso peptides of this structure. Only one retro-inverso peptide exhibits full activity: the peptide c(-dGRvf-) strongly inhibits avb3/vitronectin binding (4 nM) but not aIIbb3/fi brinogen binding (>10 000 nM). All investigated retro-sequences show very low affi nity for avb3. Recently it was discovered that the NGR sequence in the fi bronectin domain FI5 after rearrangement into iso-Asp-G-R exhibits high binding affi nity for integrin avb3. This surprising result stimulated us to investigate cyclic peptides containing the iso-Asp-Gly-Arg sequence3.. After optimisation we obtained peptides which bind with high activity to integrin a5b1 and lower, but signifi cant activity for avb3. In the ongoing work we investigate if receptor modelling can help to understand these results. Selectivity and activities for these two integrins have been obtained recently in our group using two different peptidomimetic scaffolds Bioactive peptides (tyrosine based and diacylhydracine based) using a homology model of the integrin a5b1 for which no X-ray structure is known. Binding of integrin ligands involves binding of a carboxyl group to the metal ion (Ca or Mn) in the so-called MIDAS region of the integrin. So far all integrin ligands contain a carboxyl group and any attempt to substitute this group by an isoster failed. We recently found that hydroxamic acids (-CONHOH) allow for the fi rst time a substitution of this carboxyl group. The activities and selectivities for integrin subtypes avb3, a5b1 and aIIbb3 have been explored and give interesting results.",

There were remarkable differences between the distribution of POP protein and activity. The highest POP activities were found in the liver and testis while kidney had the lowest activity. In peripheral tissues, POP was present in various cell types both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cells, in contrast to the brain where no nuclear localization was detected.

            "text": "The rapid cytoplasmic entry of cationic cell-penetrating peptides In the past few years, our understanding of the cellular import of cellpenetrating peptides has evolved rapidly. The initial concept of cell entry by direct permeation of the plasma membrane, was followed by endocytosis as a major route of import at least for most cellpenetrating peptide-cargo conjugates. More recently, we and others observed a rapid cytoplasmic delivery of fl uorescein-labeled analogs of the cationic CPPs nonaarginine and Tat-peptide at subtoxic lower Poster abstracts micromolar concentrations (1). This import originates from spatially confi ned zones of the plasma membrane and depends on the presence of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. These molecules have been proposed to interact polyvalently with the guanidinium groups of the arginine residues. Moreover, the threshold for the induction of this import could be lowered by inhibition of endocytic routes of entry. Recently, it was reported that the absence of serum in the medium lowers the threshold for this uptake process (2) . In summary, these observations suggest that the concentration of peptide associated with the plasma membrane is a decisive trigger for this import process. Currently, it is not known, to which degree this cytoplasmic entry of labeled conjugates at higher concentrations is based on similar molecular mechanisms as the direct permeation of unlabeled conjugates that has also been observed at lower concentrations (3). Here we summarize the current knowledge on direct transport across the plasma membrane of cationic CPPs and present new data on the molecular events involved in this uptake process. Plasma membranes have numerous essential functions for maintaining cellular homeostasis. However, the membranes are also barriers to intracellular delivery of various therapeutic molecules. For improvement of their translocations, we developed a novel method using GALA peptide/cationic lipid complexes. GALA, a 30-residue amphipathic peptide with a repeat sequence of glutamic acid-alanine-leucine-alanine, was designed to mimic the function of viral fusion protein sequences that mediate escape of virus gene from acidic endosomes to cytosol (1) . When attached with bioactive cargoes, the GALA peptide may thus serve as intracellular vector bearing effi cient endosomal escape function. However, because of negative charges from glutamic acids (7-residues) in the GALA sequences, access of the peptide on negatively charged cell surface would be not so effi cient. To overcome this problem, cationic lipid was employed as an gadhesive h for pasting the GALA peptide onto cell surface to accomplish effi cient cellular uptake. We examined the ability of GALA peptide as a delivery vector using FITC as a model of membrane-impermeable low-molecular weight drugs. When FITC-GALA (1 \u0192\u00caM) was administrated to HeLa cells, co-addition of cationic lipid, Lipofectamine 2000 (LF2000), drastically increased the effi ciency in uptake of FITC-GALA. In a time-dependent manner, the FITC-GALA escaped from endosomes, and diffuse fl uorescent signals were observed in both cytosol and nucleus. Also the GALA/cationic lipid system was applied for the intracellular delivery of FITC-avidin protein (68 kDa). When FITC-avidin was mixed with biotinylated-GALA/ LF2000 complexes, FITC-avidin (250 nM) was internalized into cells effectively. In the absence of these complexes, internalization of FITCavidin was poor. These results suggest the usefulness of our approach for intracellular delivery using GALA peptide and cationic lipid. ",

Recent studies have suggested that there might be a direct penetration of peptides in parallel with different forms of endocytosis. However, the direct penetration of hydrophilic peptides through the hydrophobic plasma membrane is highly controversial. Three proteins involved in target cell apoptosis -perforin, granulysin and granzymes share many features common in uptake of cell-penetrating peptides e.g. they bind proteoglycans on the plasma membrane. The uptake of perforin activates the membrane repair response, a resealing mechanism triggered in cells with injured plasma membrane, due to extracellular calcium infl ux. Upon activation of the membrane repair response, internal vesicles are mobilized to the site of the disrupted plasma membrane resealing it within seconds. In this study we present evidence that the membrane repair response is able to mask damages caused by cell-penetrating peptides when they internalize cells, thus preventing leakage of endogenous molecules out of the cell.

The cells were treated with different concentration of synthetic dimers and after the treatment were analysed by fl ow cytometry in order to investigate their cellular uptake. The antiproliferative effect of symmetric GnRH-III dimers were studied on MCF-7, HT-29 and T47-D (human breast cancer) cell lines. HT-29 xenograft was applied for studying in vivo antitumor effect of GnRH-III dimers in different administration routes. The cellular uptake and the antiproliferative effect are cell type dependent as it can be found in the literature. We found that symmetric dimer derivatives of GnRH-III signifi cantly decreased the tumor volume in vivo (40%).

By screening a random peptide phage library, we identifi ed a certain peptide sequence bound to Geminin. Using a series of mutant Geminin, ELISA test revealed the amino acid residues 31-111 are responsible for the peptide binding. We found fewer BrdU positive cells following transfection of the Geminin-binding peptide than following that of the control peptide. This study suggests that the chemical peptidomimetics of this peptide might form the basis for the development of drugs that could be used to prevent tumor progression.

FMDP is transported into the cells when incorporated in a peptide chain and hydrolyzed by intracellular peptidase releasing free inhibitor as the \"warhead\" component, which can react with the target enzyme. The concept of utilizing of peptide transport system for delivery of toxic amino acids into the microbial cells is characterized by authors as \"illicit transport\". Unfortunately, peptides are not stable in physiological fl uids, due to activity of peptidases. Analogs with modifi ed amide backbone are more resistant towards enzymatic degradation. It has been shown that enzymatic hydrolysis of endothiopeptides is often signifi cantly slower than natural peptides. In our studies we synthesized Nva[CSNH]-FMDP, an analog of Nva-FMDP, which is a strong antimicrobial peptide. Because of the fact that the \"warhead\" component in this peptide",

            "text": "Neuroprotective effects of cortexin and cortagen in rats with focal brain ischemia and brain trauma There is a growing body of evidences that natural peptides and their smaller synthetic analogues have good outlooks for medical use. Three compounds were studied in this research -Cortexin, Cortagen and N\u00eeleylcortagen. Cortexin is a balanced combination of oligo-peptides isolated from calf/porcine cortex. The number of non-clinical and clinical studies confi rmed Cortexin effi ciency as nootropic and neuroprotective drug. In spite of benefi cial results the natural source of the drug implies some diffi culties for it general use. To overcome this issue a number of putative Cortexin synthetic analogues were developed. Among them is tetrapeptide Cortagen. In order to improve the peptide transport to the brain and lipophility the hydrophobic oleyl radical was added to the peptide chain. The aim of research was to study the effects of these peptides on recovery of conditional refl ex in Active Avoidance paradigm after heavy brain trauma and neurologic defi cit dynamics induced by focal brain ischemia in rats. 170 males albino rats were involved in experiment. Closed craniocerebral trauma was modeled by weight-drop method. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by cortical phototrombosis. Experimental therapy started in 0.5 hours after mechanical action and continued for 7 days. Synthetic peptides were administrated i.p. once-a-day in dose of 10 -1000 mcg/kg. Cortexin was used at the same schedule in dose of 150 mcg/kg. Cortagen and Cortexin administration in dose of 10 and 150 mcg/kg respectively resulted in pronounced neuroprotective effect in rats with focal cerebral ischemia. The observed effects were proved by Limb-Placing Test. Cortexin experimental therapy resulted in earlier restoration of conditional refl ex starting from the 3rd day after brain trauma. N\u00eeleylcortagen had weaker benefi cial effect with signifi cant improvement in conditioned response recovery by the 4th day. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG provide health benefi ts beyond their mere nutritive value, and are useful in the treatment and prevention of several diseases. Isolation and use of the anti-apoptotic factor(s) would ultimately culminate in the development of novel therapeutic agents in enteropathy resulting from chemo-and radio-therapy in the treatment of cancer patients, which could in turn be administered in a consistent and pharmacologically sound manner. In present study, intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from Wistrar rats (n=12), and were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C in a humidifi ed 5% CO 2 atmosphere. After 72 h, these cells were treated with bioactive peptides isolated from LGG (10-100 \u00ecmol/ Lit) for 2 h, and were incubated with camptothecin (20 \u00ecmol/ Lit) for 2 and 4 h, and cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Caspase activity assay was carried out to determine caspase 3 and caspase 9 activity. Moreover, cell lysates were also pretreated with caspase 3 inhibitor (200 \u00ecM). DNA fragmentation assay was carried out to determine the increase in DNA fragmentation. Bioactive peptides signifi cantly prevented camptothecin induced apoptosis in rat intestinal epithelial cells. The treatment of intestinal epithelial cells with camptothecin for 4 h resulted in fi ve-fold increase in DNA fragmentation, and resulted in three-fold increase in caspase 3 activity, compared with controls. Pre-treatment with bioactive peptides (10 \u00ecmol/ Lit) signifi cantly attenuated the Camptothecin-induced DNA fragmentation by 29% (P<0.001), and signifi cantly inhibited caspase 3 and caspase 9 activity by 35% and 39%, respectively, after 4 h of camptothecin exposure (P<0.001). Hence, it was concluded that novel bioactive peptide from LGG were found to be potential anti-apoptotic agents and hence could be administered as therapeutic molecule for treatment of enteropathy resulting from chemo-and radiaton-therapy. Cisplatin belongs to the most powerful and useful anticancer agents. It binds strongly to DNA in regions containing several guanine units, forming Pt-DNA links within strands. Through disrupting base-pairing guanine to cytosine cross-links lead to unwinding of the DNA. As a result cisplatin works against both types of cells, destroying cancer and normal type ones. Therefore more selective delivery system of platinum to cancer cells is still needed. Based on the evidence of the presence of -and -opioid receptor types in carcinoma cells we proposed to use opioid peptides as selective carriers for delivering platinum ions to the cancer cells. We designed hybride molecules which combine two fragments. One part of the molecule contains the opioid pharmacophore and the other fragment is designed to form a complex with platinum ion. Such molecule can serve not only as carrier for platinum, but also give a strong analgesic effect. As a result such hybride molecule should express analgesic properties and provide anticancer activity. We will present synthesis of a few opioid peptide-platinum(II) complexes, the binding affi nity at the opioid receptors and effect on the proliferation of the human glioblastoma cells. Peptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat region of the HIV fusogenic protein gp41 are potent inhibitors of viral infection, and one of them, T20 (enfuvirtide), is used for the treatment of therapy-experienced AIDS patients. The mechanism of action of these peptides is to interfere Bioactive peptides with the fusion of the viral and target cell membranes, and it is known that HIV entry takes place in membrane microdomains ('lipid rafts') enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Therefore we explored the advantage of targeting a peptide fusion inhibitor to membranes by addition of a lipid moiety, specifi cally a cholesterol group. Since derivatization with lipids is also known to improve the half-life of peptide therapeutics, we chose the antiviral peptide C34, which is more potent than T20 in cell-based assays, but unlike T20 has a very short half-life in vivo. We show here that attachment of cholesterol to C34 (C34-chol) dramatically increases its antiviral potency against a panel of HIV strains, including primary isolates: for strain HXB2, IC50 = 4 pM for C34-chol, versus 205 pM for C34, and 692 pM for enfuvirtide). Consistent with the anticipated mechanism of action, C34-chol accumulates at the site of action, since washing of the target cells after incubation with the peptide, but prior to triggering fusion, increases IC50 only 5-fold, relative to 400-fold for C34. Moreover, cholesterol must be strictly positioned at the C-terminus of C34, in line with the need of an antiparallel orientation of the C-peptide relative to N-peptide trimeric coiled-coil, present in the fusion-active conformation of gp41. In addition to boosting antiviral potency, derivatization with cholesterol has the expected benefi cial effect on the peptide pharmacokinetics. We believe that these fi ndings may be of general utility for viruses, which share with HIV the dependence on a type I fusogenic machinery. ",

            "text": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease mediated primarily by CD4+ T cells of the Th1 subset. The design of peptide mutants of disease-associated myelin epitopes to alter immune responses offers a promising avenue for the treatment of MS. We designed and synthesized a number of peptide analogues by mutating the principal TCR contact residue based on MBP83-99 epitope. The synthesis of the linear peptide agonist MBP83-99, as well as of the cyclic analogue was carried out by the Fmoc/tBu methodology, utilizing the 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin. Cyclization was achieved using Obenzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafl uoroborate (TBTU) and 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole, 2,4,6 collidine allowing fast reaction and high yield cyclization product. The purifi cation was achieved using HPLC reversed-phase chromatography and the peptide purity was assessed by analytical HPLC and by mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Agonist and antagonist (linear and cyclic) peptides were conjugated to reduced mannan. Immune responses were diverted from Th1 to Th2 in SJL/J mice and generated antibodies which did not cross react with native MBP protein. (1) . Due to its high effi cacy and specifi city, HN represents a potential lead to new therapeutic approaches of AD. However, the molecular mechanism(s) of HN function(s) are not yet fully elucidated. Wild-type HN and HN-derivatives were synthesized by SPPS and amino acid sequences and homogeneities of the RP-HPLC purifi ed peptides ascertained by ESI-and MALDI-mass spectrometry (MS). The complex formation between HN and A (1-40) was studied by affi nity-chromatography and high resolution MS (FTICR-MS), as well as by immunoanalytical (ELISA) techniques. The binding sites between the two peptides were identifi ed by applying proteolytic epitope extraction/excision procedures [2, 3] Integramide A, an effi cient inhibitor of the coupled reaction of HIV-1 integrase, is a 16-mer linear peptide characterized by 9 C -methylated -amino acids (5 Iva, isovaline, and 4 Aib, -aminoisobutyric acid, residues) that was isolated from fungal extracts of Dendrodochium sp. The amino acid sequence was fully elucidated by the Merck group a few years ago (S. B. Singh et al., Org. Lett. 2003, 4, 1431-1434) . On the other hand, the chiral sequence was only partially determined. In particular, the precise stereochemistry of the Iva 14 -Iva 15 dipeptide (known to contain one D-and one L-residue) near the C-terminus was not reported. To solve this unsettled issue and to assess integramide A primary structure-bioactivity relationship we performed by solution methods the total chemical independent syntheses of both L-D and D-L 16-mer diastereomers and compared their properties with those of the natural inhibitor. For an unambiguous, complete stereochemical assignment of integramide A we relied heavily on HPLC and NMR techniques. Our results clearly indicate that the chirality sequence of the Iva 14 -Iva 15 dipeptide of the natural product is L-D. The two integramide A diastereomers were also evaluated as inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase in the coupled reaction of proviral DNA into the host cell DNA. . A prototype peptide, R11-29, spanning RANTES residues 11 to 29, contains two hydrophobic clusters of fundamental biological importance connected by a nonessential hydrophilic linker. R11-29 has been rationally modifi ed to improve its CCR5 binding and its antiviral potency. NMR studies on the modifi ed peptides revealed important similarities and differences with the three-dimensional organization of RANTES. Although these peptides are consistently more active as dimers, an increase in anti-HIV-1 activity of the monomeric forms was observed in parallel with their molecular evolution. In addition, no tertiary interactions could be detected by NMR, indicating an autonomous folding of the monomers also in the context of dimeric peptides. The most potent peptide designed so far, Rmax, shows anti-HIV-1 activity in the low nanomolar range (Vangelista et al, in preparation). Strikingly, a similar potency was observed in the same assay with T20, an HIV-1 gp41-derived peptide currently licensed for use in AIDS therapy. These results provide a rationale for the use of RANTES-derived peptides as new candidates for treatment and prevention of HIV-1 infection. 10% of the population older than 65 years and 40% exceeding the age 80 years are affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD).(1) A factor in the pathogenesis of AD is the cerebral deposition of amyloid fi brils as senile plaque. BACE1 initiates the pathogenic processing of APP by cleaving at the N-terminus and the resulting C99 membrane bound C-terminal peptide can then be hydrolyzed by -secretase to form Apeptide (A 40 or A 42). BACE1 is not only a promising target cause it is a key player in formation of A but also because BACE1 knock-out mice are viable and free of the gross phenotypic changes. Our group was recently able to shown that the phosphino dipeptide (PDP) isostere is a suitable replacement of the hydroxyl ethylene isostere in OM00-3(2) resulting in pseudo peptidic inhibitors of about same potency. [2, 3] In our search for conformationally restrained PDP isostere BACE1 inhibitors we speculated that the P1 and P3 cyclization would lock the active conformation of the cyclic linear pseudo peptidic inhibitor in the N-terminal region. First the detail analysis of the crystal structure of OM00-3 bound to BACE1(2), revealed that the ideal macrocyclus should consist of a 13-membered heterocycle. On this basis we developed a macrocyclic inhibitor with P1 and P3 cyclized side chains containing a PDP isostere with improved serum stability. ",

The expression of TAA varies among different tumors and patients, resulting in highly variable response to tumor targeted therapies. Therefore, diagnosis should provide information on the expression of the targeted antigen in each patient, thus allowing to predict possible effi ciency of a therapy mediated by targeting agents directed to the same tumor antigen. In this approach, the molecule used for tumor cell tracing should be as close as possible to that used for therapy. The use of peptides as tumor targeting agents was envisaged years ago with the fi nding that receptors for different endogenous regulatory peptides are over-expressed in several primary and metastatic human tumors, and can be used as tumor antigens (Reubi JC. J Nucl Med 1995;36:1825-35). In previous works, we demonstrated that peptides synthesized in a branched form, result in molecules that are resistant to proteolytic activity and can retain (or even increase, through multivalent binding) peptide biological activity. A branched peptide that targets neurotensin (NT) receptors, known to be over-expressed in a number of tumors, including colon, pancreas and prostate carcinoma (Reubi JC. Endocr Rev 2003;24:389-427) and was conjugated to effector units and proved to be stable and active in vivo (Falciani C, et al. Mol Cancer Ther. 2007;6:2441-8). Here, we created new NT-based molecular tools conjugated to different fl uorophores and chemotherapeutics and demonstrated that branched peptides can be modulated either as tracers for measuring the presence of the specifi c target in primary tumor or metastasis on human surgical resections, or as specifi c drug-carriers, which use the same target to enter and eventually kill tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Aquaculture has become an increasingly important activity, as an immediate source of animal protein required for several countries growing population. Vaccination of fi sh against bacterial and viral diseases is one of the best strategy for controlling certain infectious Bioactive peptides diseases in aquaculture worldwide, thus decreasing the need for antibiotics, and increasing cost-effectiveness and net profi ts. Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is a pathogen of farm fi sh with a worldwide distribution. Peptides derived from IPNV Protein 2 (VP2), a major structural protein, could be used for development of effective vaccine against IPNV, According to a search of VP2 antigenicity we selected two peptide sequences, K 19 PYVRLEDETPQG 42 (VP2-19-42) and N 91 FSLAEQPANETK 103 (VP2-91-103), that are expected to be highly immunogenic. These peptide sequences were synthesized in their N-terminus iodoacetylated form and conjugated to Ac-(Lys-Aib-Cys) 4 -NH 2 , a cell penetrating sequential carrier (CPSC). Conjugation of four copies to Cys side chains of the carrier was realised by the chemoselective ligation method. The resulted constructs were purifi ed by HPLC and characterized by ESI-MS. Immunizations are in progress in order to test their immunoprotective potency. Acknowledgements to the GSRT (Greece-Egypt project 266-\u00e5) for the fi nancial support. ",

It is present in the natural ligands for these integrin receptors, as in Fibronectin, Vibronectin, or Fibrinogen. Recently, it was shown that Fibronectin in which the RGD sequence has been mutated into an RGE sequence (which is known not to be recognized by integrins) still has the ability to interact with its receptor. However, it forms FN fi brils only with a slightly different phenotype than wild-type Fibronectin (1). A hypothetical model for these unexpected results was proposed by Curnis et al. (2) . The NGR (Asn-Gly-Arg) sequence, present at four positions in the fi bronectin molecule, is able to undergo a rearrangement to isoDGR (isoAsp-Gly-Arg), which shows activity on v 3 and -with less potency -on 5 1. The mechanism of Asn-deamination is already known for a long time and has widely been considered to be a process of degradation, acting as a biochemical clock that limits protein lifetimes in vivo (3). Curnis et al. were the fi rst to show that the deamination process increases protein function instead (2). These fi ndings stimulated us to create a library of cyclic peptides containing the isoDGR sequence.

It is well known that essential activity of muramyl peptides -minimal structures of bacterial cell wall -are adjuvanticity. The comparison of the adjuvant effect of these compounds with the ability to activate NF-kB pathway through NOD2 was examined. The adjuvant activity of di, tetrasaccharide peptides and stearoyl containing derivatives has at least two peaks in dose-response curves and greater of them correlates with respective dose-response data for NF-kB stimulation through NOD2. Introduction of stearoyl moiety, with the aim of improving muramyl peptide interaction with the cell membrane and subsequent intracellular delivery, infl uenced the corresponding activities in vitro, but did not correlate with improved effects in vivo experiments. The comparison of the adjuvanticity in vivo and the NOD2 activation in vitro revealed clear correlation between two responses. These fi ndings confi rm the view that NOD2 pathway activation should account, at least in part, for the adjuvant effect of these compouds. The correlations of the NF-kB pathway induced by muramyl peptides with the aim of enhancing their adjuvant activity were investigated. The thymus gland plays an important role in overall immunomodulation. The studies in early 1960s by several authors have established that thymus is necessary for the normal development of immune response. It is thought to be responsible for the development and regulation of Tcell immunity, acting through endocrine mechanism (1). It is known that thymus peptides play an important role in the development, maturation, differentiation, and activation of T-lymphocytes. Investigation of the function and properties of this gland shows that the thymus contains pharmacologically active components with immunological properties. When the immune system is challenged, thymic peptides seem to regulate the expression of various cytokine and monokine receptors on T-cells and induce secretion of IL-2, interferon alpha, and interferon gamma. Up to date several thymic extracts have been isolated using different biochemical methods of extraction, homogenization and purifi cation. These are, usually, semipurifi ed aqueous and lipid calf thymus extracts. The goal of this study was to determine the biological activity of peptide components, isolated from the calf thymus. Extract of calf thymus was prepared and fractioned into lipid and nonlipid (peptides) fractions. The nonlipid fraction was isolated and characterised by biuret, IR , NMR and HPLC methods. Analyses of IR and NMR spectra indicated the presence of charasteristic bands and peaks for peptides. Results estimated from HPLC analyse showed that molecular masses of isolated peptides were below 1500 daltons.

The physiological effects of NTSR1 have been extensively studied but the functions associated with the NT binding to NTSR2 are less well defi ned. The C-terminal fragment of NT, Arg 8 -Arg 9 -Pro 10 -Tyr 11 -Ile 12 -Leu 13 -OH, has been long recognized as an essential and suffi cient segment for the effective interactions of NT with the receptors; a short peptide, Arg 8 -Arg 9 -Pro 10 -Tyr 11 -Ile 12 -Leu 13 -OH, designated NT(8-13), displays binding affi nity similar to that of the full-length NT at both NTSR1 and NTSR2. In this study, the role of Arg 8 in the interactions of NT(8-13) with the human NTSR1 and NTSR2 was examined through ligand structure-function studies. The side chain of Arg 8 was determined to not be critical for binding to hNTSR1 but essential for binding to hNTSR2. Several analogs of NT(8-13) are reported which are high affi nity hNTSR1 ligands (IC 50 = 0.1 to 3 nM) and more than 500-fold selective versus hNTSR2. ",

Using this model, we have previously shown that PSA (also known as KLK3) inhibits endothelial cell tube formation(1), indicating reduced angiogenic potential. Furthermore, we have shown that the antiangiogenic activity of PSA is related to its enzymatic activity [1, 2] . We have developed peptides that stimulate the enzymatic activity of PSA towards a small chromogenic substrate. These peptides also enhance the anti-angiogenic activity of PSA both in vitro and in vivo. This supports our hypothesis that enhanced PSA-activity by our peptides could be used to reduce tumor angiogenesis and, thus, to reduce tumor growth. The most extensively studied TADs are those that contain acidic TADs and one extremely important protein is the human tumour suppressor protein p53. Given the presence of repetitive stretches of acidic amino acids TADs are generally disordered in the free state and this has also been demonstrated for p53TAD. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry and site-directed mutagenesis studies we have recently characterized the interaction of the p53TAD with the Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain of the Tfb1/ p62 (yeast/human) subunit of TFIIH. The NMR structure of the Tfb1/ p53TAD complex demonstrates that p53 forms a short alpha-helix in complex with Tfb1 (1). This structure is an important step towards developing a sequence code for acidic TAD binding to the PH domain of Tfb1/p62. Such detailed structural information is essential to design molecules that modulate transcription activators such as p53. We will present the structure of the p53/Tfb1 complex, structural and biophysical characterization studies with peptides designed to mimic acidic TADs and compete with p53 for binding to TFIIH. ",

            "text": "RGD-containing peptides are an excellent starting point for the identifi cation, synthesis and development of selective integrin ligands. The affi nity and selectivity of the peptide ligands towards different integrins depend strongly on the secondary structure of the sequence and the overall three-dimensional shape. Cyclization is frequently used as a method to reduce the accessible conformational space. Additionally, the incorporation of non-natural conformationally constrained amino acids can greatly affect the secondary structure of the peptide, in such a way that the synthetic ligands prefer to adopt a particular conformation. The aim of this investigation are small cyclic peptides containing the RGD motif and constrained amino acids (such as -methylated amino acids, -amino acids or dehydroamino acids) that exhibit well-defi ned conformational properties. The present communication describes the synthesis of different cyclic RGD peptides with the general sequence c-(-Arg-Gly-Asp-Xaa-Yaa-) and the evaluation of their activity as ligands for the V 3 and 5 1 integrins, present on human cells.

In recent years there has been increasing interest in the design of chemical agents capable of inducing DNA interstrand crosslinking (ISC), which, shutting down the DNA replication process, represents by far the most cytotoxic of all the alkylation events. Quinone methides (QMs) are interesting compounds that have been proposed as intermediates in a large number of chemical and biological processes. The asymmetry introduced by the presence of two electronically different substituents, carbonyl and methylidene, on the cyclohexadiene ring imparts a strong dipolar character to quinone methides not found in benzoquinones and quinodimethanes. QMs have been successfully used to accomplish nucleoside alkylation and DNA ISC by photochemical and fl uorideinduced activation. Apart from their involvement in biological processes, o-QMs react with a variety of nucleophiles (Michael addition), resulting in substituted hydroquinones. They also function as effi cient heterodienes in Diels-Alder reactions and undergo a variety of self dimerization reactions. Here we present the synthesis of a new series of synthetic o-QMs (bis-napthalene type) conjugated with RGD analogue peptides. The biological activity of these compounds is under investigation.

Platelets aggregation causes clotting in the blood vessels during the blood circulation due to several reasons. Factor VIII (FVIII), a blood coagulation glycoprotein, is a key component of the blood coagulation system. FVIII in its activated form (FVIIIa) acts as a cofactor to the serine protease FIXa in the conversion of the zymogen FX to the active enzyme (FXa). The role of FVIIIa is to increase the catalytic effi ciency of FIXa in the activation of factor X (FX). The target of this research is the synthesis of biologically active peptides, which are expected to inhibit selectively the maximisation of thrombin production depended on factor IX (FIX) and accordingly the additional activation of platelets. These peptides are based on the regions in which the FVIII interacts with FIX. Glycoprotein FVIII is composed of three distinct domain types in the arrangement, A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. The sequence 558-565 of A2 subunit is the following: Ser558 -Val-Asp-Gln-Arg-Gly-Asn-Gln565 This work covers the synthesis and biological evaluation of linear and cyclic head to tail peptides, analogs of the loop sequence 558-565 of the A2 subunit, aiming at the inhibition of interaction of FVIIIa with FIXa. Substitutions have been taken place at Asn564, which are related to the pharmaceutical groups at the side-chain, like Asp(R)564. All the synthesized analogs are purifi ed (RP-HPLC) and identifi ed (ESI-MS). The synthesized peptides analogs were investigated for their inhibitory activity and tested for clotting defi ciency by measuring their activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in vitro. These results will be discussed in relation with their biological activity against the FVIIIa factor of blood coagulation. Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is an homodimeric protein that binds two different cellular receptors: 1) the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor trkA, a member of tyrosine kinase family; and 2) p75, a member of the tumor-necrosis-factor receptor superfamily. Both receptors are involved in the activation of different intracellular signal transduction cascades. Small peptides retaining the most essential elements of NGF may be useful either as agonist or competitive antagonist in the treatment of several neurodegenerative desease and nerve injuries. The N-terminal fragment of NGF was previously demonstrated to be an important determinant for affi nity and specifi city in the binding to trkA. Crystal structure of NGF-TrkA complex, site-directed mutagenesis studies and substitution of individual amino acids, contributed to identify within the NGF molecule the most relevant domains for its biological activity in the loop-1 (29-35), loop-4 (92-98) and in the Nterminal region (3-18). We synthesized twenty peptides mimicking the loop1 and 4 linked together with aminoacid-based spacers (n glycines) or with two unit of 8-ammino-3,6-dioxaottanoic acid with or without the N-terminal region. L1L1 and L4L4 homodimeric loops, moreover L1 and L4 were also synthesized, as single loop, and their biological properties were compared to L1L4 and N-L1L4 activity . The N-L1L4 (HPIFHRGEFSVADSVSVWVGDCTDIKGKCTGACDGKQC) and L1L4 (CTDIKGKCTGACDGKQC) peptides showed a good NGF agonist activity at concentration as low as 3 uM. Both were able to induce differentiation of chick dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA but not of TrkB receptor. In addition the L1L4 peptide was able to induce the PC12 cells differentiation into sympathetic-like neurons. Moreover the L1L4 peptide was shown to reduce neuropathic behaviour and restore neuronal function in a rat model of peripherical neuropathic pain, thereby suggesting a potential therapeutic role for this peptide.

Under these conditions the binding process of a proline-rich peptide with the SH3 domain shows unfavorable binding entropy, likely resulting from a loss of rotational freedom on the formation of the PPII helix. With the aim of stabilizing the PPII helix conformation in SH3 binding motifs, in the previous years, we replaced the proline residues of the HPK1 proline-rich decapeptide, PPPLPPKPKF (P2), either with 4-R-(Fp) or with 4-S-(fp) fl uoro-L-proline at different i, i+3 positions. The interactions of the fl uoroproline-peptides with the SH3 domain of cortactin protein were analyzed quantitatively by Non-Immobilized Ligand Interactions Assay by Circular Dichroism (NILIA-CD), whereas CD thermal transitions were measured to correlate their propensity to adopt PPII helix with their affi nity for SH3. Results show that although the introduction of the Fp residue stabilizes the PPII helix conformation of peptides in a position-dependent manner, the induction of a stable peptide conformation does not increase the ligand affi nity towards the SH3 domain of cortactin. To explore the effect of electron-withdrawing substituent in the Pro residue, the Fp residues of P2 were replaced by the natural amino acid 4-R-hydroxy-proline (Hyp). Unexpectedly, NILIA-CD and CD thermal transitions results showed that the Hyp-containing peptides exhibit a stable conformation in aqueous buffer and K d values lower than the corresponding Fp peptide-analogues. In particular, Hyp3 peptide containing Hyp residues at i, i+3 and i+6 positions adopts the greater percentage of PPII helix conformation over the entire studied temperature range and shows a K d value comparable to that of the parent P2 peptide. We are now searching for inhibitory peptides able to reduce Survivin function in breast cancer cells. We take advantage of the observation that Survivin forms homodimers in vivo and have derived short peptides representing the dimerization domain. To enable intracellular expression and visualization of these short peptides, they will be fused to a fl uorescent carrier protein. Alternatively, the peptides comprising the dimerization domain will be inserted into a scaffold protein. This allows the presentation of the peptides in a constrained and stabilized conformation. We will analyze the effects of lentiviral expression of these fusion peptides in cancer cells expressing high levels of Survivin. The peptides will be analyzed for their ability to inhibit proliferation, cell-cycle progression and/or to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. ",

Its ligands include fi brinogen, iC3b, LPS, collagen type I and denatured proteins as well as intercellular adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and ICAM-4. ICAM-4 is a red cell specifi c membrane glycoprotein that was fi rst described as anerythrocyte blood group antigen LW (Landsteiner-Wiener) and later it was found to belong to the family of intercellular adhesion molecules. The fi rst reported receptors of ICAM-4 were leukocyte integrins CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18. Later it has been reported to bind to several other integrins as well. Latest reported interaction is to CD11c/CD18. The binding of ICAM-4 to integrins expressed in macrophages might clarify some of the controversy concerning the recognition and uptake of senescent red blood cells in spleen. Another function of ICAM-4/ macrophage integrin interactions could be in retaining the maturing red cells in bone marrow until they are ready to be released in the circulation. Adhesion between ICAM-4 and integrins have also been found to be important in different pathological situations and inhibition of these adhesion events could be of important therapeutic value. We have studied the interaction between ICAM-4 and CD11c/CD18 using peptides derived from both binding partners using PepSPOT method and synthetised peptides. The inhibitory or activating role of these peptides could beof clinical importance in pathological conditions where abnormal red cell adhesion is observed. The regulatory effects of relaxin in mammals realize via receptors of the serpentine type. In this work we studied the relaxin activating effect on the adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity in the rat tissues and muscle tissues of invertebrates using a peptide strategy. The strategy involved the synthesis of the peptides 619-629 and 615-629, as well as the palmitatemodifi ed peptide 619-629, all corresponding to the C-terminal region of the third intracellular loop (C-ICL3) of the human type 1 relaxin receptor LGR7. The peptides 615-629 and 619-629-Lys(Palm) had a dose-dependent activating effect on the AC activity and GTP-binding in myocardium, brain and, to a smaller extent, skeletal muscles of rat. The 619-629-Lys(Palm) had a stronger AC effect than the longer peptide 615-629, because of the possibility to be anchored in the membrane by the hydrophobic radical and, hence, to interact with the G protein more effectively. In mollusks and earthworm muscles, the stimulatory effects of both peptides were weak. Competitive inhibition of the stimulating effects of relaxin by the LGR7-derived peptides indicates that the relaxin signal in myocardium and brain is transmitted to AC via LGR7 receptor. In skeletal muscles of rat and muscle tissues of invertebrates, the inhibition of AC and GTP-binding stimulating effects of relaxin by peptides was almost indiscernible. It can be concluded that relaxin controls the AC of these tissues via the receptor different from the relaxin receptor LGR7. The stimulating effects of LGR7-derived peptides also decreased in brain and myocardium in the presence of \u00d1terminal peptide 385-394 of mammalian G s -subunit and after cholera toxin treatment. Thus, relaxin stimulates AC via LGR7 receptor and G s protein in myocardium and brain, and the coupling between receptor and G s protein is mediated by the interaction of receptor \u00d1-ICL3 and \u00d1-terminal segment of G s .

Angiogenesis is a fundamental process by which new blood vessels are formed and which is highly regulated in healthy individuals. However, many diseases are driven by unregulated angiogenesis. Excessive angiogenesis is associated with cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, while insuffi cient angiogenesis results in ischemia or artherosclerosis. Many new angiogenic modulators have been developed in the last years, mostly to inhibit angiogenesis but only few peptide-based angiogenic stimulators have been reported. There are data in the literature suggesting roles of small peptides or basichexa peptides as angiogenic modulators like Ringseis et al. reporting effects on endothelial cell function (such as EC proliferation) and Fazekas et al. describing effects for the latter. Endostatin, an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis, among its proteolitic fragments contains both, an inhibitor and a stimulator of angiogenesis. We considered it possible that fragments of basic heptapeptide D-Phe-Cys(-)-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Cys(-)-Thr-NH 2 (TT-232), a strong antitumor agent, could also act as angiogenic modulators. The heptapeptide was developed in our laboratory and has been recently in a clinical trial (phase II).",

The biological activity of the compounds was tested in vitro using an immortalized Kaposi Sarcoma cell line to determine their pro-anti-angiogenic character. To test the angiogenic potential of the best compound, the aorta ring assay was used, which by using intact vascular explants reproduces more accurately the environment in which angiogenesis occurs. In this study we report the synthesis and angiogenesis modulating effects of the peptides. Somatostatin is a neuropeptide that regulates several functions of the endocrine and exocrine systems. It also affects cell proliferation and neurogenic infl ammation through a family of G protein-coupled receptors. Neurogenic infl ammation plays signifi cant role in the pathogenesis of numerous infl ammatory diseases (such as asthma, arthritis, allergy and migraine). Inhibitory effect of somatostatin on infl ammation is well known but the pharmaceutical use of the native peptide is limited due to its broad spectrum of anti-secretory effects and short plasma half-life time. TT-232, a heptapeptide analogue of somatostatin (developed by our research group and it is in Clinical Phase II trials) has selective antitumour and anti-infl ammatory effect without regulating other endocrine or exocrine processes. Receptor-ligand binding experiments with various analogues of the somatostatin as well as TT-232 [D-Phe-c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Cys)-Thr-NH 2 ] verifi ed that the side chains of Tyr, D-Trp and Lys are important pharmacophoric groups for somatostatin-like biological activity. Linear, cyclic and branching derivatives were designed and synthesised using above amino acids to selectively inhibit infl ammatory actions. Unnatural moieties also were applied to enhance their enzyme resistance. Linear and cyclic peptides consist Tyr and D-Trp, while ring closed ones contain Lys too. Branching peptidomimetics have the same, fl exible core [tris(2aminoethyl)amine] and three protected or unprotected amino acids situated in equal positions. The biological activity of the compounds was evaluated by in vitro assay of substance P release and in vivo assay of plasma protein extravasation.

We investigated different manners of GnRH molecule modifi cation; their infl uence on peptide/DNA complex formation and its penetration into cancer cells. Analogs, containing NLS from large antigen of SV40 were synthesized using combination of BOC-and Fmoc-chemistry. Depending on peptide structure (agonist or antagonist) NLS was attached via position 6 or 1 of the natural molecule. The competition experiments demonstrated that internalization of peptide/ DNA complex into HepG2 cells is mediated by specifi c receptor binding. Moreover, NLS/DNA complexes, lacking GnRH moiety were unable penetrate cellular membrane. Subsequent studies permit to identify the infl uence of analog structure on in vitro effi ciency of suicide gene therapy, followed by acyclovir treatment. It was shown that application of reference peptide gene delivery system damaged about 50% of tumor cells. Use of cationic peptide conjugated with RGDF sequence provides high effi ciency of treatment, however can not ensure selective action on cancer cells. GnRH analogs completely suppress tumor growth in vitro due to specifi c interaction of peptide/DNA complex with correspondent receptor. The effi ciency of suicide gene therapy depends on peptide structure and is in favor of agonists as compared to antagonists. Preliminary data of experiments in vivo on laboratory animals demonstrated practical utility of tested peptides in the course of intravenous administration. Thus, it was shown that GnRH analogs containing NLS moiety represent promising candidates for the delivery of HSVtk gene into the cancer cells. The structural-functional study of putative grape (Vitis vinifera) uncharacterized protein sequences was performed. We developed a special method of computer analysis (1) for this. This method has allowed to reveal new potentially active regulatory oligopeptide sequences yet not investigated experimentally. Information on grape amino acid sequences of public databases [2, 3] , computer database EROP-Moscow (Endogenous Regulatory OligoPeptides) 4. containing the information on structure and functions of known natural oligopeptides and specially created computer programs were used for this. Protein amino acid sequences were compared with all known oligopeptide sequences in this method. As a result several tens of grape oligopeptide sequences were elucidated. The similarity of their sequences with the known oligopeptide structures of other biological species was the basis for the prediction their potential functional properties. It has been shown that grape contain putative regulatory oligopeptides possessing functions of antibacterial and antifungal agents, enzyme inhibitors, calmodulin binding structures, rapid alkalinization factors, etc. The primary structure similarity of grape sequences was found not only with plant species but with bacteria, fungi, and animals also. Cyclotides are plant derived mini-proteins with compact folded structures and exceptional stability. Their stability derives from a headto-tail cyclised backbone coupled with a cystine knot arrangement of the three-disulfi de bonds. Taking advantage of this stable framework we developed novel VEGF-A antagonists by grafting a peptide epitope involved in VEGF-A antagonism onto the stable cyclotide framework.",

            "text": "No high resolution structure of this receptor is available and the binding site of ligands is not exactly known despite numerous site-directed mutagenesis studies. This suggests that the determination of structural aspects of mu-opioid activity should focus on the ligands. mu-Opioid ligands with similar affi nity and selectivity should possess at least one common structural feature in which they differ from other ligands of different affi nity and selectivity. Comparative structural analysis of such ligands, considering adequate representation of binding conditions may reveal key features of bioactivity. In this study ten mu-opioid receptor ligands, DAMGO, Tyr-W-MIF-1, morphiceptin, endomorphin-1 and 2 and their analogues, possessing different affi nity and selectivity were examined using molecular dynamics. Conformational preference of these molecules was determined in aqueous and DMSO media which were meant to model different possible binding environments. No structural trend, correlating with previously measured bioactivities was observed in aqueous media. In DMSO it was found, that a preference for trans orientation of the Tyr1 side chain and gauche (-) orientation of the third aromatic side chain, the free rotation of the Phe4 side chain and a high propensity of bent backbone structure is favorable for high affi nity binding to the mu-opioid receptor, while deviations from these criteria results in variable loss of bioactivity. Constellation of these four key conformational parameters may be a guiding principle in the future for the design novel mu-opioid receptor ligands.",

We have recently reported the synthesis and conformational analysis of the 1,4-disubstituted- [1, 2, 3] triazolyl containing cyclopeptide derived from the sequence of the potent i-to-i+4 side chain-to-side chain lactam-containing antagonist of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) 2.. The conformational properties of triazolyl-containg peptide were compared to those of the corresponding lactam analog. CD and NMR studies revealed that, despite a slight difference of the backbone arrangement, triazolyl containing cyclopeptide and lactam-containing cyclopeptide share a common orientation of the side chains (3). Here we present the structural study of a new library of disubstituted- [1, 2, 3] triazolyl containing cyclopeptides designed to obtain different cycle dimensions and different triazolyl-ring positioning. CD and NMR analysis in different solvent systems shows that both, the dimension of the cycle and the specifi c positioning of [1, 2, 3] triazolyl ring are critical to fully resemble the conformational properties of the potent lactamcontaining antagonist of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). The somatostatin (SRIF) is a cyclic tetradecapeptide, which exerts inhibitory effects on the secretory processes in the endocrine and exocrine systems, and the cell proliferation through somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-5). SSTRs are distributed throughout human body, not only in normal cells but also in tumor cells. Most of the somatostatin analogues developed for clinical use, such as Octreotide which act longer than somatostatin are being used in the diagnosis and treatment of endocrine tumors. The use of these analogues as antitumor agents has been limited because of their antisecretory effects and poor oral bioavailability. TT-232 [D-Phe-c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Cys)-Thr-NH 2 ], was reported by Keri et al. to have potent antiproliferative activity without antisecretory action 1.. Based on the above, we aimed to design and synthesize somatostatin analogues with more potent antiproliferative activity and high oral bioavailability. We synthesized pyrazinone ring containing cyclic peptides (2) and linear peptides which are substituted at the C-terminus Lys with hydrophobic and rigid groups. Our focus was on the active sequence: Tyr-D-Trp-Lys. We also examined their antiproliferative activity and found that Boc/H-Tyr-D-Trp-1-adamantylamide exhibited the most potent antiproliferative activity higher than that of TT-232. Furthermore, on the best analogues we studied DNA fragmentation by FACS analysis and cellular morphology. The results demonstrated that these somatostatin analogues induced cell death by apoptosis. 6 Kobe Gakuin Universit, JAPAN Background and aims: Endomorphin-2 (EM-2: H-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Phe-NH 2 ) has high affi nity and selectivity for the mu opiod receptor (1). We focus on the Pro residue, which imposes strong restraints on the conformation of the peptide chain or induces cis-trans isomerization of X-Pro bonds. We substituted the Pro with 2-Azetidinecarboxylic acid (Aze) or Piperidinecarboxylic acids (Pip) to increase or decrease the conformational fl exibility. In this paper, we deal with the synthesis of EM-2 analogues containing Aze and Pip and the evaluation of the biological functions of the analogues on the opioid receptors. Methods: The synthesis of peptides was achieved according to the procedure of Okada Y. et al. (2) The fi nal products were identifi ed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and elemental analyses. The receptor binding activity of peptides was assessed by radio-ligand receptor binding assay using mu and delta opioid receptors from COS-7 cell membranes expressing each opioid receptors. For the evaluation of the biological function of peptides, the GPI and the MVD tests were performed. The new analogue of CSF114(Glc) 1., [Pro 7 ,Asn 8 (Glc),Thr 10 ]CSF114 is characterized by a type I -turn around the minimal epitope Asn(Glc), and it was demonstrated to show the highest antibody affi nity in competitive ELISA in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients' sera and thus it appears as a promising tool for the detection in patients' sera of specifi c autoantibodies. In previous studies, we synthesized and tested different fragments of this new glucosylated peptide, [Pro 7 ,Asn 8 (Glc), Thr 10 ]CSF114, identifying the shortest sequence [Pro 7 ,Asn 8 (Glc),Thr 10 ] CSF114(5-11) able to detect antibodies by ELISA in MS patients' sera. This heptapeptide is characterized by Thr in position 10 generating a characteristic N-glycosylation consensus sequence. According to the results obtained with the linear heptapeptide in MS, we applied the Backbone Cyclicization method to develop two backbone cyclic libraries of glycopeptides based on the sequence of the linear hepta active peptide. Backbone Cyclization is a method that allows obtaining cyclic peptides without changing the natural sequence or the chemical character of the amino acid residues, in order to enhance activity, stability to metabolic degradation, selectivity and bioavailability (2) . The fi rst library contains a Gly building unit at the C-terminus and is connected to the N-terminus by linker of various lengths (n=2, 3, 4, 6) . In the second library, His 9 of the heptapeptide is replaced by Gly building units with various alkyl chains (n=2, 3, 4, 6) [Fmoc-N (N Alloc(n-alkyl))Gly-OH] that is connected to the N-terminus by linker of various lengths. Twenty cycloglycopeptides were synthesized, and screened by competitive ELISA s on MS patients' sera to select the most bioactive cyclic glycopeptide. ",

Owing to their high chemical stability and resistance towards nucleases and proteases, they are very attractive as antigene/ antisense agents, molecular biological tools and for genetic diagnosis. The lack of charge and polar groups in the backbone decrease their solubility in aqueous environment and their ability to cross cell membranes, reducing their performance in in vivo applications. In order to overcome these problems -to improve solubility, increase affi nity and specifi city of binding, a number of analogues were synthesized.

Due to the conformational fl exibility of the fragments forming the supramolecular structure, the shape and prosperities the binding cavities are adjusted the most effectively to requirements of the guest molecules. The previous studies documented that process of binding guest molecules is highly selective, reversible and competitive. Therefore, we supposed that under favorable circumstances the structures could operate as catalysts if suitable molecular fragment are included inside the binding pocket. In order to verify this hypothesis we prepared library of supramolecular hosts with catalytic triade: His Asp(Glu) Ser, incorporated into the binding pocket 1..

The results of the new screening method will be presented for peptides that specifi cally bind to human cancer cells. show increased biological activity in a dimeric form1. In recent years there have been signifi cant efforts to obtain minimized versions of naturally occurring proteins such as dimeric DNA binding proteins which retain their function. The GCN4 basic region peptides were connected trough a disulfi de bond to give a dimer which specifi cally bound the AP1-DNA sequence. Dimeric peptides and proteins were obtained also by non covalent interactions.2 In this work we propose a strategy for obtaining by Expressed Protein Ligation (EPL), one pot protein homodimers covalently connected at the C-terminus. The synthetic strategy was extended also to the synthesis of heterodimers. EPL is a protein engineering tool for the chemo and region-selective modifi cation of proteins based on the use of intein containing constructs.3 In this work dimers were obtained by reacting a new bi-functional linker with carboxyl-activated polypeptides. We synthesized a linker containing two cysteines in a N-terminal-like position, separated by an ethylendiamine spacer, and obtained thioester proteins by intein mediated splicing reactions. This strategy affords chemically stable dimeric proteins. The linker can be easily modifi ed at need, changing the lenght and rigidity of the spacer between the cysteines. This strategy has potential in biochemical and bioorganic applications, for obtaining minimized and/ or modifi ed natural proteins and for joining two different proteins at the C-terminus position. This technique will be extended to the synthesis of dimeric proteins mimicking the transcription factor AP-1. 1 Previous studies showed that CSF114(Glc), 2,3 a designed glycopeptide characterized by a -D-glucopyranosyl moiety, can detect and isolate specifi c autoAbs in sera of a signifi cant number of MS patients. This synthetic Ag could be considered a mimetic of aberrantly glycosylated myelin proteins triggering autoimmunity in MS. Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) is considered a putative autoAg in MS. 4 Our aim is to obtain MOG properly glycosylated to characterize the molecular mechanisms of Ab-mediated MS and to design new antigenic probes to detect autoAbs as biomarkers. Production of specifi c glycoproteins may benefi t from a chemical approach, such as Expressed Protein Ligation (EPL) a protein engineering strategy useful to introduce noncanonical amino acids and biological probes into proteins. 5 EPL allows synthetic and recombinant polypeptides to be chemoselectively and regioselectively joined together. The recombinant rMOG ED (1-97), obtained as C-terminal thioesther by protein splicing, will be ligated to the peptide fragment [Gly 103 ,A sn 104 (Glc)]MOG ED (98-117) bearing a Cys residue at the N-terminus. An alternative strategy exploits the selective reaction between a glucosyl iodoacetamide derivative and the Cys free thiol of a protein. 6 A site directed mutation has been performed on rMOG to introduce a Cys residue at its native site of glycosylation. The semi-synthetic proteins will be tested by ELISA using MS patients' sera. Automation is an identifi ed goal in the Peptides R&D at Lonza. This approach would facilitate and accelerate peptide production. This is highly desired within Peptides R&D, where the need exists for rapid synthesis of peptides to fulfi l Iso and GMP projects requirements. Automated peptide synthesisers are available on the market but many have limitations which make them inappropriate for Lonza (e.g., low scale, coupling systems limitation, pre-activation procedure at low temperature). Furthermore, there is no obvious standard instrument for scalable SPPS equipped with PAT. GE Healthcare provides scalable and complete solutions for automated solid-phase synthesis of oligonucleotides from small research amounts to full commercial production (1 mol-1mol) based on the \u00c4KTA, Oligopilot 400 and OligoProcess\u2122 platforms. The UNICORN\u2122 software provides control and monitoring of the processes. GE Healthcare synthesisers are designed around fl ow-through column reactors, giving faster kinetics and lower solvent and reagent Peptide biotechnology and diagnostics consumption compared to batch synthesisers. Based on experience with scale-up of oligonucleotides, GE Healthcare and Lonza are confi dent that the fl ow through-column technology can be scaled up for peptides to a cost effi cient process. This is a strong argument that the potential of the \u00c4KTA platform as a peptide synthesiser should be explored. GE Healthcare was approached by Lonza to develop a peptide synthesiser based on the \u00c4KTA platform instrument to compete with the state of the art in the peptide fi eld. The aim is to develop the fl uidics, programming and chemistry methods of the \u00c4KTA system to Lonza's needs for routine production of 0.4g to 2g of crude peptide, and later scale up to 2 kg. This synthesiser, controlled by the UNICORNTM software, has the capability to perform synthesis using on-line mixing or pre-activation at different times and temperatures of amino acids, coupling reagents, solvents and additives. Results from peptides will be presented. Neuropeptides are produced from precursor proteins by selective cleavage at specifi c sites. Classical biosynthetic cleavage occurs at basic residues due to the activity of a small number of well-known proteases. However, with the discovery and characterization of new neuropeptides, a new non-classical pathway has been described with cleavage occurring at tryptophane, leucine and other residues. Neuropeptide-processing peptidases involved in this new non-classical pathway are completely unknown but essential for correct processing of certain neuropeptides. Therefore, we are interested in identifying proteases involved in the non-classical pathway using activity-based proteomics. For this purpose, we fi rst designed and synthesized some peptides based on the sequence the mature neuropeptides described in the literature but with an active functional group able to bind the active site of the proteases of interest. Bound peptides were labelled with biotin or rhodamine by click chemistry, and the brain and pituitary proteome was then characterized by in-gel analysis and multidimensional nLC-MS/MS. Several proteases that may be involved in neuropeptide processing have been identifi ed in this experiments. Further studies concerning cloning, protein expression and activity assays will confi rm their role in biological tissues. The incidence of autoimmune diseases continues to increase. Although an enormous research effort has been directed in understanding this increment, etiology of human autoimmunity remains enigmatic. Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by destruction of bile ducts and the presence in the serum of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA positive in 90-95% of patients), directed against the E2, which is one of the three component enzymes of the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complex family chiefl y pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2). Environmentally induced co-or post-translational modifi cations of autoantigens are hypothesized to break immune tolerance leading to self reactivity in PBC 1.. In this context it is possible to take advantage of a unique technology that allows the monitoring of peptide epitope modifi cations that will lead to the identifi cation of altered autoantigens that the human host will recognize as foreign, similarly to what recently reported in multiple sclerosis (2) . Our approach will lead to new diagnostic tools that can be used in earlier stage patients and possibly to monitor disease activity. Herein we report the synthesis of lipoamide and glyco-peptides characterized by a -hairpin structure with the modifi cation on the tip of the -turn as peptidomimetic of native antigens involved in PBC. In order to identify the best synthetic antigens and to clarify the role of the -turn in exposing the modifi cation we compared the antibody recognition in PBC sera by ELISA using the modifi ed peptides in comparison with the proposed autoepitope of PDC-E2 [PDH (44-63) ]. The synthetic antigens were able to detect by ELISA autoantibodies in 30% of AMA negative sera of PBC patients confi rming that PTM-peptides are useful diagnostic/prognostic tools. ",

            "text": "Alzheimer fs disease is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of amyloid peptide (A ) into extracellular fi brillar deposits known as amyloid plaques. A can self-assemble into soluble oligomers, protofi brils, and amyloid fi brils, and all of these aggregated forms contain signifi cant -sheet structure. The core of A (14-23 residues) containing hydrophobic region is a key to promoting A aggregation. In the previous study, we constructed green fl uorescent protein (GFP) variants which have the core part of A sequence on the surface -sheets. It has been demonstrated that the GFP variants inhibit A aggregation 1.. In this study, we have utilized a small protein, insulin-like growth factor \u2021U receptor domain 11 (IGF2R-d11) as a scaffold, and a part of A sequence was incorporated into the -sheet surface of IGF2R-d11. IGF2R-KK and IGF2R-KA were designed by substituting two A derived sequences for some amino acids in IGF2R-d11 as parallel and anti-parallel -sheet models, respectively, of the A aggregates. These insoluble proteins expressed by E coli. were solubilized by denaturing buffer, and the denatured proteins were refolded in conditions permitting formation of native proteins. After refolding, the proteins were purifi ed as monomers by size exclusion chromatography. We have investigated the interaction between A and the designed protein variants by surface plasmon resonance studies. As a result, IGF2R-KK bound tightly to A more than IGF2R-KA. Inhibitory activities of A fi brillization in the presence of IGF2R-KK, IGF2R-KA, or wild type IGF2R-d11 were evaluated by thiofl avin T (ThT) binding assay. It was demonstrated that IGF2R-KK inhibited A fi brillization effectively. because of their high structural fl exibility. On the other hand, a 2stranded -structure is presumed to be more stable than a single strand as a fi bril forming intermediate. Therefore, the aggregation mechanism of prion protein remains to be further studied on their precursor structures. Recently, we have established a novel strategy to determine the amino acid sequence for amyloid formation, based on their essential interactions. A number of fi bril forming peptides at positions from 160 to 230 in the amino acid sequence were obtained by our calculation method. In order to confi rm whether aggregates of the candidate peptides consist of the 2-stranded -structure, a series of peptides consisting of g10 residues-turn-10 residues h were prepared. Several candidate peptides, of which regions are 166-187, 168-189, 170-191, and 178-199 , showed the typical enhanced fl uorescence intensities in the thiofl avin T-binding assay, suggesting the amyloid formation. IR spectra of these peptides showed the typical bands corresponding to the -structure. In addition, the peptide (178-199) exhibited a shoulder band at 1654 cm -1 in IR spectrum, refl ecting a turn structure. These results revealed that the amyloids of the peptide (178-199) are constructed with the 2-stranded -structure, which may be formed by intra-molecular hydrogen bonds. In conclusion, the results obtained here indicate that the sequence from 178 to 199 could be a key region for the transition from a normal to an abnormal structural state.",

A different approach measures forces required for breaking a bond in a differential format by comparison with a known reference bond of dsDNA (1). Here we apply this molecular force balance to the integrin v 3, which is over expressed in OVMZ-6 cells. This protein interacts with ligands containing an -Arg-Gly-Asp-(RGD) motive. Ligands containing the RGD sequence were made by peptide synthesis and linked to a GCN4-peptide using a PEG-spacer. For detection carboxyfl uoresceine was introduced to a lysine side chain between both peptides. The GCN4-peptide can be recognized by specifi c anti-body fragments (2) and can act as a reference bond. These force balances was linked to a PDMS-surface, whereas the reference bond is attached to the surface and the RGD-peptide is accessible to the integrin. When the PDMS-stamp gets in contact with the OVMZ-cells, the interaction of ligand and receptor can occur. By applying a force at the stamp the force balance is stretched and the weaker bond brakes. Investigation of the fl uorescence-level on stamp and cells enables the localization of the balance construct and thus an estimation of the bond force. First stamp-experiments on living cells showed that the GCN4anti body interactions are too strong to act as a reference system. Since the binding forces of DNA are well investigated by AFM and small DNA-molecules were already used as force sensor, DNA can act as a more sensitive reference. Thus in a further approach the RGD-Peptide was linked to a biotinylated PEG. This enables the application of short double-stranded DNA as a reference bond via a fl uorescence-labelled streptavidin. Using this system the force balance could be transferred to the v 3 integrines located in the cell membrane of OVMZ-cells. ",

The positioning of the synthetic or biological species inside the nanogap must be controlled to reach optimal electrical or detection properties.

Thin fi lms can be characterized by a variety of physical or chemical methods. However, the characterization of the chemical properties of nanogaps is complicated because of the small size of the substrate delimited by the electrodes. In this context, novel experimental tools are needed for probing rapidly the chemical reactivity of nanogaps. We show here for the fi rst time that a specifi c functional group in a 30-90 nm nanogap can be detected by combining peptidecapped gold nanoparticles and electrical detection.(4) A semicarbazide layer and semicarbazone chemoselective ligation was used in this proofof-concept study, which thus required the preparation of stable peptidecapped gold nanoparticles modifi ed by aldehyde groups and control GNPs derivatized by amide groups. The chemoselective insertion of gold colloids into the nanogaps led to current increases from 2 to 4 orders of magnitude, in accord with the number of gold nanoparticles in the nanogaps detected by scanning electron microscopy. 3 ",

            "text": "We present the electrical detection of immunoglobulin G (IgGs) from human serum using a nanogap-based biosensor. The detection method is based on the capture of IgGs by a probe immobilized between gold nanoelectrodes of 30 to 90 nm spacing. The captured IgGs are further reacted with secondary antibodies labelled with gold nanoparticles (GNPs). Insertion of GNPs into the nanogap resulted in increasing the conductance through the nanogap. The use of a chip with ninety nanogaps enabled the calculation of a quality factor for the detection which, coupled with a non-linear regression analysis of the data, easily discriminated specifi c and differential capture of human antibodies by arrayed probes. We obtained a 500-fold higher quality factor with protein A compared to goat anti-murine antibodies. This method can be applied, through these proof-of-concept experiments, to the detection of protein-protein interactions in biological samples. In the past several decades, hundreds of peptides have been identifi ed which have specifi c biological activity and are highly potent in in vitro assays but lack the prerequisite pharmacokinetics to become effi cacious human therapeutics. We have developed a novel antibody-based platform technology that provides an improved pharmacokinetic profi le for biologically active peptides, resulting in a long duration of action. One such Mimetibody\u2122, CNTO 528, is a novel erythropoietin (EPO) receptor agonist. Although CNTO 528 bears no sequence homology to erythropoietin, it is a potent erythropoietin receptor agonist, rescuing EPO dependent cells from apoptosis in vitro and stimulating erythropoiesis in vivo. Studies were done in normal rats to explore the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of CNTO 528 in normal rats and to demonstrate its effi cacy in rat models of anemia. In vitro, CNTO 528 was approximately 10 fold less potent than rhEPO in stimulating the growth of UT-7EPO cells. Despite this lower in vitro potency, when compared to rhEPO and darbepoietin in normal rats, a single subcutaneous dose of CNTO 528 resulted in a longer-lived reticulocytosis and longer-lived increase in hemoglobin. Also, CNTO 528 caused only minor changes in red cell distribution width (RDW) or mean cell volume (MCV) and led to the release of mature reticulocytes. We have also shown that CNTO 528 was effi cacious in rat models of anemia and in a rat model of pure red cell aplasia. Taken together, our data show that CNTO 528 is a novel stimulant of erythropoiesis in rats. This platform has been applied to other biologically active peptides as well and has proven to be a robust platform for enhancing the pharmacokinetics of peptides that would otherwise be rapidly cleared. Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been recognized as promising tools for the delivery of different therapeutic molecules. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the S4(13)-PV peptide accumulates inside cells very effi ciently through a rapid, dose-dependent and nontoxic process. Formulations based on the S4(13)-PV cell penetrating peptide presented great potential for the delivery of plasmid DNA, which may prove useful for gene-based therapies. In the present work, we aim to 1) investigate the relevance of the Dermaseptin-derived sequence and of the nuclear localization signal to the effi ciency of the overall process of plasmid DNA delivery by the S4(13)-PV and related peptides; 2) compare the potential of the S4(13)-PV peptide to mediate plasmid DNA delivery with that of the extensively studied Tat CPP. A comparative analysis of the transfection effi ciency mediated by the systems based on the S4(13)-PV, reverse NLS and scrambled peptides was performed in TSA and HeLa cells. In general, for both cell lines, the reverse NLS peptide mediated transfection at effi ciencies comparable to those observed for the S4(13)-PV peptide. However, transfection mediated by the scrambled peptide was signifi cantly less effi cient than that obtained for the S4(13)-PV and reverse NLS peptides. To compare the biological activity of the S4(13)-PV with that of the Tat peptide, we transfected TSA cells with various S4(13)-PV-and Tatbased formulations. Our results have shown that both peptides enhanced the activity of cationic liposome-based systems. Above a threshold peptide/cationic liposome/pDNA charge ratio (10/1/1), the enhancing effect was independent of the peptide used, although for the lowest charge ratios, this effect seemed to be more relevant in the case of the S4(13)-PV peptide.",

The RGDS sequence has been recognized as the cell attachment site of the natural extracellular matrix. The purpose of this study is to fabricate RGDScarrying nanoscaffords towards cell adhesion using a self-assembling technique.

            "text": "The role of deiminated protein antigens in the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis Autoantibodies directed against citrulline-containing peptide (ACPA) have high specifi city of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Citrullinated proteins are formed by posttranslational modifi cation, namely by deimination of arginine residues in protein sequences by peptidylarginine deiminase enzymes (PADI). Autoantibodies to deiminated (citrullinated) proteins are the most specifi c serological markers of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms develop gradually, and it is diffi cult to precisely date the beginning of the disease. These antibodies are detectable already years before the fi rst clinical symptoms of the disease. The aim of our study was to identify the epitopes of vimentin and fi laggrin derived-peptides targeted by RA specifi c antibodies to provide further information about the nature of the initial autoantigenic substance. We used conventional solid-phase peptide synthesis (Fmoc strategy) carried out on \"MULTIPIN NCP\" (Chiron Mimotopes Peptide System) non-cleavable kit. Identifi cation of epitope structure of antigenic proteins represents one of the major applications of these technologies. The peptides were prepared in duplicates. Citrullinated peptides and the nonmodifi ed counterparts containing arginine instead of citrulline residues were synthesized in order to compare their respective reactivities. In the \"indirect\" ELISA experiments the presence of ACPA was determined using serum samples of RA patients and healthy blood donors. This series of experiments effi ciently identifi es citrullinated epitopes of fi laggrin and vimentin as a potential antigenic target for RA specifi c antibodies. The determination of epitopes of these proteins could be important for the development of appropriate diagnostics in this most frequent human systemic autoimmune disease. At the present time the human lysosomal enzymes cathepsins B and L, cysteine proteinases of C1 family, attract great attention. They not only take part in protein degradation but also appear to play role in other important physiological processes, for example, antigen presentation, caspase-independent cell death and involved in different diseases such as osteosarcoma, acute pancreatitis, tumor invasion and metastasis. But selective detection of these enzymes is diffi cult because determination of their enzymatic activity is carried out using substrates also correspond to specifi city of trypsin-like enzymes. The chemo-enzymatic synthesis of selective substrates of cysteine proteinases of C1 family was developed. These compounds are chromogenic Glp-Phe-Ala-pNA (I), Glp-Val-Ala-pNA (II) and fl uorogenic substrates Abz-Phe-Ala-pNA (III), Glp-Phe-Ala-AMC (IV). Peptides were obtained in preparative quantities and were characterized by the data of amino acids analysis, HPLC, mass-spectrometry, spectrophotometry (I and II) and fl uorimetry (III and IV). The specifi c activities of cathepsins B, L and similar enzymes of plants papain, bromelain and fi cain were determined using synthesized substrates and commercial available substrates Z-Phe-Arg-pNA, Z-Arg-Arg-pNA and Bzl-Arg-pNA. The specifi c activities of enzymes of other classes -serine (chymotrypsin, trypsin and subtilisin), aspartic (pepsin) and metalloproteinases (thermolysin) -were also defi ned with these substrates. It was shown, that Glp-Phe-Ala-pNA, Glp-Val-Ala-pNA and Glp-Phe-Ala-AMC are not detectable cleaved by enzymes of other classes.

To implement a new electrochemical biosensor for autoantibody detection in MS we used CSF114(Glc) analogues, properly modifi ed at N-terminus with ferrocenyl and ferrocenyl-thiophosphine derivatives, as \"electrochemical probes\" in cyclic voltammetry (2) . The electrochemical properties of ferrocene, coupled to thiophosphine ability to build simple monolayers on gold surfaces, allow peptides to be anchored on the working electrode used for detection. In particular, 4-FcPhP(S)Abu organometallic amino acid was specifi cally designed to be used directly in solid phase peptide synthesis. The organometallic moiety introduced in the new glycopeptides did not affect autoantibody recognition as demonstrated both in SP-ELISA and in inhibition experiments. An electrochemical monitoring was able to detect interactions of the modifi ed glycopeptides with isolated antibodies from MS patients' sera. We demonstrated a detection sensitivity comparable to ELISA method. Therefore, the new electrochemical probes can be proposed to characterize autoantibodies as biomarkers of Multiple Sclerosis by a simple, rapid, and reproducible cyclic voltammetry-based diagnostic methodology. Troponin is a structural protein complex, located on the thin fi lament of the contractile apparatus. It is composed of three protein subunits: troponin I (24kDa), troponin C (18kDa), and troponin T (37kDa) and exists as isoforms specifi c to the cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, respectively. Cardiac troponins are released in the peripheral blood during irreversible cardiac muscle damage in a time-specifi c manner. Rapid troponin ELISA assays based on the production of specifi c antibodies against the whole complex or individual subunits have been shown to possess suffi cient sensitivity and specifi city for use in the emergency departments. However, their usefulness sometimes is limited by various factors, such as the selection of epitopes for antibodies production, derived from cardiac troponins representing high homology against the skeletal isoforms, interfering blood factors etc. Aiming to contribute in the fi eld of developing highly sensitive and specifi c reagents for the detection and isolation of cardiac troponins in the sera of patients with cardiovascular diseases, we selected epitopes derived from the cardiac isoforms for production of antibodies, mainly based on their predicted immunogenicity, the minimum homology against the skeletal isoforms and the lack of interferences of the produced antibodies with various blood factors. The selected sequences were conjugated to the tetrameric Sequential Oligopeptide Carrier (SOC 4 ), either by the classic solid phase step-by-step methodology or by chemoselective ligation reactions and the resulted conjugates were used as immunogens for releasing anti-troponin specifi c antibodies. The performed ELISA experiments revealed the high affi nity and specifi city of the produced anti-troponin antibodies against the native protein.",

Although the incidence and prevalence of individual autoimmune diseases are not high, the population burdens of the disease are large and underestimated. Thus, reliable diagnostic/prognostic tools are necessary for an early diagnosis and for monitoring disease activity. In this scenario, we proposed a 'Chemical Reverse Approach' based on the use of patients' sera to screen synthetic modifi ed peptides. We showed that this approach could lead to the effective identifi cation of specifi c probes able to characterize highly specifi c autoantibodies as disease biomarkers of highly relevant autoimmune diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and Rheumatoid Arthritis [1, 2] . Toscana Biomarkers is a R&D company involved in the application of the \"chemical reverse approach\" to different autoimmune conditions for the development of innovative diagnostic/prognostic tests. As a number of autoimmune diseases have been associated with posttranslational modifi cations, which alter the function and immunogenicity of protein/peptide antigens, we are synthesizing and screening focused peptide libraries based on post-translational modifi ed amino acid, conformational and minimal epitope diversity. Lead compounds can be thus used as antigenic probes for specifi c recognition of autoantibodies as biomarkers of diseases in the set up of diagnostic/prognostic assays (3). Autoimmune diseases are considered now as a plague. In fact some autoimmune diseases previously considered rare are actually increasing their frequency because of an earlier diagnosis (e.g. celiac disease).",

The idea we have been investigating for years and more recently proposed by others, is that aberrant post-translational modifi cations, i.e. glycosylation, deimination etc., create neoantigens triggering autoantibodies. This could explain why proteins (both recombinant and isolated), components of target organs or tissues, are failing. Anyway, it is evident that one single biomarker will never enable to reach successful diagnostic & prognostic tools. On the contrary, synthetic peptides specifi cally modifi ed (with sugars, citrulline, lipoyl moieties, etc.) are interesting tools to fi shing out of patients' sera these autoantibodies. We have recently reported that this can be effi ciently done following a \"Chemical Reverse Approach\" 1..

A wider application of our SAP is obtained by its citrullinatation and/or galactosylation (3) useful for rheumatoid arthritis or lipoylation for investigating primary biliary cirrhosis.

The peptide antigen was conjugated to gold particles and absorbed to a fabric ribbon and dried. In the test, a serum sample is added together with buffer, and the solution dissolves the conjugate. A positive result is obtained when the antibodies together with the gold conjugate bind to anti-human-IgG on the nitrocellulose, and form a specifi c coloured line which can be detected in the test window. Serum samples were collected from patients with acute B19 infection, and control samples were drawn many years after infection; additional control sera came from subjects devoid of B19 antibodies. The assay was shown to be stable in accelerated stability study. The conditions for industrial scale manufacturing were evaluated and the sensitivity and specifi city were addressed, whereby the assay proved to be highly specifi c for acute B19 infection. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of memory and cognitive decline, for which the aggregation and plaque-formation by the -amyoild (A ) polypeptide has been identifi ed as a key event. Recently, unpaired variable domains of llama single chain antibody (VHH) fragments against A have been found to exert considerable therapeutic potential for AD. VHH represents the smallest antigen-binding unit with a molecular size of ~15 kDa, compared to Ig-heavy and light chain variable domains, Fab fragments and complete IgG antibodies. Human cystatin C (hCC) is a cystein protease inhibitor present in all human body fl uids which has a propensity to co-associate with A -plaques/fi brils, and has plaque-inhibitory properties. Using proteolytic extraction and excision of the llama-VHH-A (1-40) immune complex (e.g., trypsin, Glu-C protease) in combination with electrospray ionization (ESI)-and MALDI-mass spectrometry, the A -binding epitope was identifi ed at the middle-carboxyterminal domain of A , A (17-28). An analogous mass spectrometric approach was employed for the identifi cation of the binding epitopes of the hCC-A -complex, using immobilized hCC and A -affi nity matrices. An almost identical minimal epitope to that of the VHH-anti-A -antibody ( A (17-24) ) was found, which binds to a specifi c C-terminal domain of hCC, hCC(101-117) 1.. The identifi ed hCC epitope peptide was found to specifi cally inhibit A -oligomerization in vitro, in agreement with the A -epitope domain interefering with the A -aggregation. The identifi ed A and hCC epitopes represent new lead structures for designing neuroprotective inhibitors of the A -aggregation process, and for molecular AD diagnostics. ",

The C-terminus of ASPP2 contains Ankyrin repeats and an SH3 domain (ASPP2 Ank-SH3 ), which mediate its interactions with apoptosis-related proteins such as p53 and Bcl-2. We have used a combination of membrane-bound peptide arrays and biophysical methods to study the protein-protein interactions of ASPP2 at the molecular level in order to reveal their possible role in apoptosis. Using peptide arrays, we have mapped the binding interfaces of ASPP2 with its partner proteins such as Bcl-2, NF-B and other proteins that are involved in apoptosis. We then applied the peptide array results to study profoundly the interactions of ASPP2 with proteins from the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family. We found that ASPP2 Ank-SH3 binds to Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bcl-W at two homologous sites in all three Bcl proteins tested: (i) The conserved BH4 motif (ii) A binding site for pro-apoptotic regulators. Quantitative biophysical analysis of the interaction with the free peptides revealed that the binding was selective, and the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 binds tightest to ASPP2. We propose a mechanism in which ASPP2 induces apoptosis by inhibiting functional sites of the anti apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. The array screening results also served as a basis for docking studies that resulted in binding model for the complex between the full length protein Bcl-2 and ASPP2 ANK-SH3 . We conclude that the use of combinatorial methods such as peptide arrays, combined with quantitative biophysical techniques, can signifi cantly contribute to better understanding of biological pathways.

The search for highly selective ligands to target the endothelial cell integrin aVb3 is currently the focus of many research groups as they may represent new therapeutics or valuable diagnosis in a number of areas such as metastasis, angiogenesis, arthritis and retinopathy.

For instance, the use of c(-RGDf(NMe)V-) is actually evaluated in several clinical trials. Therefore, we designed a new class of cyclic tetrapeptides. RGDK peptides were fi rst synthesized by solid phase synthesis then cyclized in solution through a urea bond using N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole. Using SkmeL28 and A549 cells, expressing and non-expressing aVb3 respectively, we demonstrate that one of our peptide showed a better internalization than the reference peptide cRGDfE.

As a model reaction, we investigated esterifi cation of sucrose -\" royal carbohydrate\" with cyanomethyl ester of benzyloxycarbonyl-phenylalanine.The difference of reactivity between the eight hydroxyl groups is a key factor in chemical exploration. In polar solvent as DMF or DMSO the primary positions might react faster than secondary ones if the reaction is essentially sensitive to steric interactions. On the other hand, the reaction might be more sensitive to the activity of the alcohol functions. In this respects, 2g-OH has been shown to be the most reactive among eight hydroxyl groups of sucrose. After removal of benzyloxycarbonyl group, the products possess groups which can accommolated in the hydrophobic S1 and S2 subsites of angiotensin I converting enzyme. The free amino group in the amino acid-carbohydrate esters can also serve as good ligands for Zn2+ in the ACE active site. Carbohydrates possess both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in their structure and could also bind with enzyme subsites. The measurements of IC50 value of newly amino acyl esters of carbohydrates are in progress. Synthetic polyelectrolytes (PE) have been widely used to modify proteins via complex formation and covalent attachment, increasing (or reducing) the immunoreactivity and/or immunogenecity of originally antigenic proteins and improving their in vivo stability with prolonged clearance times.

In the purifi cation of IgG, Protein A originated from bacteria is frequently used as a affi nity ligand, but several problems such as the contamination of endotoxin and the deterioration of protein A by the repeated use were pointed-out in the use of protein A. On this account, the development of low molecular ligands and mimic peptides which can be used instead of protein A has been performed. We have searched for the peptides which specifi cally bind to human IgG using a T7 random peptide phage library and, as a result, succeeded in isolation of two kinds of peptides called Type I and Type II. Type I peptide recognize normal structure of human IgG and can be used for the purifi cation and the detection of IgG. However, it not only binds to human IgG but also to mouse and rabbit IgG with comparatively high affi nity. On the other hand, Type II peptide is extremely specifi c only for human IgG. A more important thing is that Type II peptide does not bind to IgG in serum, but get possible to bind to IgG antibody purifi ed by a protein A column. From this result, we elucidated the abnormal structure of IgG is generated by acid condition used in the elution from a protein A column and Type II peptide recognizes this specifi c structure. In this presentation, we report the results that the type I peptides functioning as an affi nity ligand instead of protein A can be applied for the purifi cation system of the antibody by improvement by amino acid substitutions and chemical conversion. Furthermore, we also report the generation condition of an abnormal conformer of IgG structure by pH and the temperature and the effective removal of the generated specifi c conformer by the Type II peptideimmobilized column.

The isolation and detection of low abundant enzymes and proteins is one of the most challenging tasks in bioanalytical and pharmacological fi elds, especially if information about their state of activity is required. For this purpose tailored solutions for addressing the members of a protein family are required. Peptide chemistry provides established methods to assemble building blocks to construct such molecular probes. We chose matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) for validation of such an approach. This protein family processes and degrades various extracellular matrix proteins and possesses a highly conserved catalytic site with a zinc ion in its centre. Most of the known and potent inhibitors are peptidomimetics containing zinc chelating hydroxamate groups (e. g. marimastat).",

Three dodecapeptides were identifi ed to have signifi cant affi nity to ACE2; the best of them had a KD = 85 M . Further refi nement yielded a hexapeptide from Y438 to L443 (YKYRYL) of S that bound ACE2 at KD= 46 M. STD NMR spectroscopy reveals close contacts of the aromatic tyrosine residues to the receptor. The peptide was also analyzed for antiviral activity using an in vitro assay that measures SARS-CoV infection of Vero cells. At a concentration of 7 mM virus replication was reduced about 100 fold. No replication occurred at peptide concentrations above 10 mM. The peptide blocks the binding site on ACE2 that is necessary for the virus to infect the cells. It can be used to design peptidomimetic compounds as entry inhibitors for SARS-CoV. To exclude other effects that were due to unspecifi c inhibition of viral replication, the peptide was tested during an alpha virus infection of Vero cells. No signifi cant inhibition was observed.

Additionally, we have synthesized a hexapeptide library with amino acid substitutions of the chemical lead YKYRYL and measured their binding affi nity to ACE2 via SPR to analyze the importance of the individual amino acids. SPR studies indicate an important role of R441. Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies in men and is responsible for more deaths than any other cancer, except for lung cancer. In the last decade we have developed bradykinin antagonist peptides (B10234, B10238), peptide dimer (B9870, Suim-(D-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Igl-Ser-D-Igl-Oic-Arg)2, Suim: suberimidyl; Hyp: trans-4-hydroxyproline; Igl: -(2-indanyl)glycine; Oic: 2S,3aS,7aSoctahydro-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid) and four generations of our small molecule, BKM-570 which showed high inhibition against lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. Some of the compounds also showed inhibition against prostate cancer. It is well known that prostate cancer metastasizes into bones. While prostate cancer itself has many treatment options, no drugs currently exist for the treatment of bone metastatic prostate cancer. We modifi ed our potent anti-cancer small molecules by incorporating an aminobisphosphonate group to target these compounds to bone. BKM-570, F5c-OC2Y-Atmp (F5c: 2,3,4,5,6pentafl uorocinnamoyl; OC2Y: (O-2,6-dichlorobenzyl)-tyrosine; Atmp: 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine) is the fi rst generation of our small molecules. This compound consists of three parts: A, an acyl group; B, a tyrosine amino acid residue and C, an amide group. We introduced aminobisphosphonate or aminobisphosphonate derivatives at position C, and the new N-(bis-phosphonatoalkyl)amide small molecules had anti-cancer activity against prostate cancer metastases in mice. One of these compounds has been shown to be effective against the growth of pre-established human prostate tumors in mouse skeleton through the induction of apoptosis and blockade of survivin expression. The synthesis of these aminobisphosphonate small molecules, the structure relationship studies and the biological activity of these compounds in cultured human prostate cancer cells and animal models will be presented.",

It exerts its effects by binding to AT4 receptors, which are widely distributed across tissues. The AT4 receptor has been identifi ed as the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase or IRAP. It has been proposed that Ang IV exerts its action by inhibiting the catalytic activity of this enzyme. We have reported that the -homo amino acid containing analog H-2 hVal-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-3 Phe-OH (AL-11) is a potent, selective and stable Ang IV antagonist, in which the 2 hVal is responsible for stability and the 3 hPhe for selectivity. 1 In this study we report the new Ang IV short analogues. The incorporation of erythro-MePhe 6 or Tic 6 resulted in analogues which have great ability to inhibit the hydrolysis of Leu-p-nitroanilide by IRAP or by AP-N.

The serine proteinase thrombin cleaves and activates cellular PAR1 in many pathophysiological settings associated with hemostasis, tissue injury and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle and tumor cells. In the present study, we synthesized a novel non-peptide PAR1 mimetic, based on a conformational analysis of the S 42 FLLR46 tethered ligand sequence of PAR1 in order to inhibit the cellular actions of thrombin. The rational design, based on NMR constraints and Molecular Dymamics, led to compound 1 (Fig.1) containing the spatially closed key pharmacophoric guanidyl and phenyl groups, attached to cyclohexane as a template.

            "text": "The cyclic cystine knot motif, as defi ned by the cyclotide peptide family, is an attractive scaffold for protein engineering (1). However, to date the utilization of this scaffold has been limited by the inability to synthesize members of the most diverse and biologically active subfamily, the bracelet cyclotides. Here we describe the synthesis and fi rst direct oxidative folding of a bracelet cyclotide, cycloviolacin O2, and thus provide an effi cient method of exploring the most potent cyclic cystine knot peptides (2) . The linear chain of cycloviolacin O2 was assembled using Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis and cyclized by thioester-mediated native chemical ligation, and the inherent diffi culties of folding bracelet cyclotides were successfully overcome in a single step reaction. The folding pathway was characterized and included predominating fully oxidized intermediates that slowly converted to the native peptide structure. Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, is important in both physiologic and pathologic situations, and its inhibition can be useful in the fi ght against several diseases, such as tumor development, diabetic retinopathy, etc. One of the key factors in promoting angiogenesis is the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which exerts its biological activity through interaction with specifi c receptors, VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), VEGFR-2 (KDR, Flk-1) and VEGFR-3 (Flt-4) . VEGF is over-expressed in all examples of pathologic angiogenesis, and its effects on tumor growth are mainly mediated by KDR. Our approach to novel anti-angiogenic drugs is centered on the search for inhibitors of VEGF-KDR interaction. Directed mutagenesis studies allowed the identifi cation of a surface of VEGF recognized by KDR, with residues Arg 82 , Ile 83 , Lys 84 , His 86 and Glu 89 , located in a -hairpin of loop 3, identifi ed as essential for the interaction. Most residues in this region are also located in the interface of interaction between VEGF and some none-humanized phage-displayed antibodies with potent antiangiogenic activity, suggesting a binding to VEGF similar to that of VEGF receptors. Starting from VEGF 81-91 fragment (MRIKPHQGQHI), we have designed different hydrocarbon-bridged analogues to preserve the -hairpin native structure. This communication will describe the solid-phase synthesis of olefi n-bridged (C=C) peptides and their saturated (C-C) analogues. Considering that the -turn of native VEGF 81-91 is slightly distorted, due to the presence of an extra amino acid residue, in addition to the bridged undecapeptides, two series of decapeptide analogues have also been prepared, just by removing the residues Glu 87 or Gly 88 . The conformational behavior of linear and bridged-peptides has been analyzed by NMR (NOE, 1 H and 13 C chemical shifts). The ability of these peptides to adopt the native VEGF -hairpin structure will be compared with their anti-angiogenic activities. Integrins constitute a family of heterodimeric, transmembrane cell adhesion receptors which connect cells to the scaffolding proteins of the extracellular matrix. The pioneering observation that integrins -especially v 3 and 5 1 -are hallmarks of metastatic cancer and seriously involved in the process of tumor angiogenesis turned them into attractive targets for cancer therapy. Out of that, the inhibition of integrin function is a major challenge in medicinal chemistry. Potent ligands are currently in different stages of clinical trials for the antiangiogenic therapy of cancer and age-related macula degeneration (AMD). Especially the subtype 5 1 has recently been drawn into the focus of research due to its genuine role in angiogenesis.(1) In here, we describe the rational design and the synthesis of high affi nity 5 1 binders and the optimization of their activity and selectivity against v 3 by means of extensive SAR-studies and docking experiments.(2) Starting from a tyrosine scaffold(3) we succeeded in getting compounds with affi nities in the low and even sub-nanomolar range and selectivities of 400 fold against v 3. The insights about the structure-activity-relationship gained from the tyrosine based ligands could then be successfully transferred to ligands bearing an aza-glycine(4) scaffold to yield 5 1 ligands with affi nities of even sub-nanomolar range and selektivites exceeding 10.000 fold.",

Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) and Molecular Modeling Studies indicate close proximity of hydroxymethyl and tetrazole pharmacophoric groups of antagonist V8 and Losartan.

Furthermore, these different conformations were superimposed with Losartan, where a spatial correlation among the pharmacophoric groups is observed. Antagonist V8 showed similar potency with Losartan in our in vivo model with anesthetized rabbits and in vitro binding studies to AT 1 receptor. At specifi c concentrations compound V8 showed higher affi nity compared to Losartan indicating that reorientation of butyl and hydroxymethyl groups on imidazole template allows a better binding to AT 1 receptor. 1H-Benzotriazolium 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-5-chloro-,hexafl uorophosphate (1-),3-oxide (HCTU) is a non-toxic, non-irritating and non-corrosive coupling reagent [1] [2] .

No expensive coupling reagents or special techniques were used. Total peptide synthesis times were dramatically reduced as much as 42.5 hr (1.8 days) without reducing the crude peptide purities.

Three tryptophans on the 'rippled' strand form cation-stacking interactions with two arginines on the adjacent sheet, forming an extended cation-network. In addition its structural importance, it has been postulated that the surface formed by this interaction is a key site for protein-protein recognition. A synthetic approach to the generation of novel TSR analogs, utilizing SPPS and native chemical ligation, has allowed us to rationally introduce unnatural amino acids in an effort to probe the structural and functional landscape of this clinically relevant protein domain. We have synthesized analogs of the second TSR domain of human thrombospondin-1 (TSR2) designed to probe the importance of the cation-stack. The arginine residues have been replaced by ornithine and citrulline, and thermal denaturation experiments by circular dichroism have been used to estimate stability differences between the mutant TSR2 and the native. Taken as a set, these thermodynamic measurements provide insight into the stability afforded by a cationinteraction in the context of a native protein fold. Synthetic access to the TSR2 domain also provides the opportunity for the introduction of various modifi cations, including the introduction of aminooxy groups as chemical handles, PEGylation for in vivo stability, and biotinylation to create an affi nity caputure reagent for identifi cation of protein-protein interaction partners. The tetradecapeptide bombesin (BBS) has a high affi nity for the Gastrin-Releasing Peptide (GRP) receptor. These receptors are overexpressed in human tumors such as breast and prostate cancers. Therefore they can serve as targets for in vivo imaging and therapy of these tumors with 99m Tc-and 188 Re-radiolabeled BBS analogues, respectively. For the radiolabeling, a chelator is attached to the N-terminus of the BBS analogues. Our group developed the (N His)Ac chelator, which is easy to synthesize and has a very high affi nity for the 99m Tc-and 188 Retricarbonyl complexes. However, an important part of the injected radiolabeled BBS analogues accumulated in healthy organs, such as liver and kidneys. To improve the pharmacokinetic properties, a BBS analogue was glycated via the Lys side chain of the spacer using the Maillard reaction. Unfortunately, during glycation, overalkylation on the secundary amine of the chelator was observed. Therefore, two alternatives for this glycation were examined. The fi rst one was based on the chemoselective reaction between a hydroxylamine (incorporated into the spacer) and an aldehyde (glucose). The second alternative was the Cu(I) catalyzed cycloaddition between an alkyne (incorporated into the spacer) and an azide (azido-glucose). These approaches for carbohydration circumvented the problem encountered during glycation via the Maillard reaction. Glycation by the Cu(I) catalyzed cycloaddition was, by far, the easiest way to incorporate the glucose moiety. Moreover, after 99m Tc labeling, this analogue showed the best biodistribution and the best diagnostic properties of all glycated analogues.",

This is the basis of a fl uorescent protein assay [1, 2] . Fluorescamine is used in many sensitive detection methods, e,g., characterization of poly-L-lysine (pLL)/DNA complexes post-modifi ed with a multivalent hydrophilic polymer (3), or synyhetic peptide-polymer conjugates.

The novel preparative silica particle was successfully prepared by the new generation process, which allows the higher gel density than typical silica gel and the particle size distribution would be practically mono-dispersed character. For the effective reversed phase peptide separations, pore size and pore volume of these new particle were optimized depending on the molecular weight of peptides. To enhance chemical stability and selectivity under the typical peptide purifi cation conditions, the combination of chemical bonding method and functional group density was optimized for maximum performance. By repeated packing and unpacking of this synthesized gel with large dynamic axial compression column, it was demonstrated that no fi ne has appeared and no back pressure increasing has occurred comparing to commercially available packing materials.

The CGRP peptide signals through a seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) belonging to the secretin receptor family. Co-expression of the calcitonin-like receptor (CLR) with receptor activity modifying proteins-1 (RAMP1) forms a mature CGRP receptor on the cell membrane surface. CGRP is widely distributed in the peripheral and central nervous systems. In the later, CGRP is expressed in trigeminal ganglia nerves and when it is released has potent dilator effects on cerebal and dural vessels. Through this mechanism, CGRP is involved in the regulation of blood fl ow to the brain and painsensitive meninges. The pathology of migraine has been associated with the vasodilation effects of CGRP on cerebal circulation. It has been reported that the CGRP peptide consist of an alpha-helical N-terminal region, a fl exible center region, and two putative C-terminal beta-turns. Truncation of the fi rst seven residues in CGRP results in antagonists of the CGRP1 receptor (IC50 4 nM), however, CGRP(8-37) is rapidly degraded in plasma.

In addition to the classic hypophysiotropic action of GnRH-I, it has been shown that many malignant cells, such as prostate cancer cells, secrete GnRH-I and express the GnRH-I receptor/s. GnRH-III has no endocrine activity in mammals even at high doses, but has been shown to suppress directly the growth of breast and prostatic cancer cells in vitro. In a continuation of our previous work and in order to study the effect of modifi cations in positions 4 and 6 of Leuprolide, an agonist of GnRH-I, on prostate cancer cell proliferation, we synthesized ten new conformationally restricted analogues. D-Leu6 of Leuprolide was substituted by D-Lys, D-or L-Glu and Ser4 by N-Me-Ser. We also synthesized fi ve new analogues of GnRH-III and studied their effect on prostate cancer cell proliferation. Asp in position 6 of GnRH-III was substituted by Asn and Glu, Pro9 was substituted by \u00e1-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and Trp3 and/or Trp7 by D-Trp. Peptides were synthesized by the solid phase methodology and Fmoc/But chemistry in high yields. Results show that the inhibitory effect of GnRH-I analogues on the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells depends on the nature of the substituted amino acid in position 6. Incorporation of D-Trp in positions 3 and 7 of GnRH-III preserved its antiproliferative activity, whereas all other modifi cations reduced its activity. Mastoparan (MP) is an antimicrobial cationic tetradecapeptide with following primary structure INLKALAALAKKIL. This amphiphilic -helical peptide was originally isolated from the venom of wasp Paravespula lewisii. However some MP analogues (tetradecapeptides with different amino acids sequence) have been also isolated from the venom of hornets, yellow jackets and paper or solitary wasps. They are rich in hydrophobic amino acids such as Leu, Ile, Ala and commonly posses Lys residues. MP shows a variety of biological activities such as inhibition of the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, activation of mast cell degradation and histamine release, activation of phospholipase A2 and C or erythrocyte lysis. MP is also turned out to enhance the permeability of artifi cial and biological membranes and activate GTP-binding regulatory proteins by a mechanism analogous to that of G protein-coupled receptors. Nowadays many mastoparan analogues have been synthesized. Some of them contains in primary structure the mastoparan sequence but they loss some of the properties of MP, such as transportan (a cell penetrating peptide, consisting N-terminal fragment 1-12 of galanin and mastoparan at the C-terminus linked with Lys residue) or its truncated analogue, transportan-10. In present study we have designed and synthesized several new chimeric mastoparan analogues composed of MP and other biologically active peptides (e.g. galanin, RNAIII inhibiting peptide) and containing natural or unnatural structures. Next we examined each of these hybrid constructs as well as natural peptides for they antimicrobial activities.

They are a diverse class of biomolecules that exhibit exquisite selectivity and potency for a wide range of pharmacological targets in the central nervous system, making them valuable tools for studying the mechanisms of neurotransmission and pain. Despite their diversity, conotoxins have evolved from a relatively small number of rigid disulfi de bonded frameworks that give rise to a series of intervening loops of amino acids that project outwards from the framework and interact with the receptor binding site. Receptor targets are generally determined by the shape of the framework, with the amino acids within the framework infl uencing receptor subtype specifi city.

The disulfi de bond frameworks were formed by oxidizing each mixture in dilute aqueous buffer and their correct formation monitored by CD spectroscopy.

It is the active compound of bee venom and a powerful stimulator of phospholipase A2. Its antimicrobial effect was extensively studied in the literature, but little is known about its neuroactive properties. Melittin increases the cell membrane permeability in excitable and non-excitable tissues, as a result of its interaction with the negatively charged phospholipids. Our interest was focused on the algesic properties of melittin and on its potency against the electrophysiological parameters of sensory neurons from dorsal root ganglia. In our study, we have performed patch-clamp studies, by the whole-cell confi guration. Primary cell cultures were obtained from double transgenic mice TCR-HA+/INS-HA+ with type I diabetes. This animal model is well-suited for the study of neuropathic pain and it enables us to test the analgesic effects of melittin (0.1-5 M). Our recordings indicate that the active-peptide modifi es the algesic profi le of the sensory neurons, in particular by acting against the capsaicinactivated ionic currents. In addition, we have monitored the action of melittin on the I h currents, Na + voltage -dependent currents, delayed rectifi er K + currents. A particular interest was focused on the recordings of Ca 2+ voltage-dependent currents. The maximal effect was obtained at a dose of 1 M melittin, and at higher doses the active-peptide strongly disturbs the lipid membrane order. In conclusion, the algesic profi le of the sensory neurons from double transgenic mice is signifi cantly modifi ed by the neuroactive melittin in comparison with the profi le of neurons from Balb/c mice. These electrophysiological data are important, and are very well corroborated with the increased thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity induced by melittin itself and the bee venom extract, that have been proved their effi ciency in behaviour tests .",

The ability of some of these peptides to penetrate the microorganism's external membrane and to induce their death suggests that this class of molecules may represent a new generation of antibiotic pharmaceuticals. In our work, we focused on the AMPs side effects on mammalian cells. The target was to characterize the toxicity of several AMPs evaluated on in vitro cellular cultures. The following AMPs were used in our experiments: melittin, magainin I and II, cecropin A and mastoparan. The viability of cells in cultures was assessed by MTS test on Chinese hamster lung fi broblasts V79 and on human lymphocytes primary cultures. Concentrations in the range of 0.1 -100 M were used. The IC50 value for each type of AMP was evaluated from the viability versus concentration curves. Haemolysis assays were also performed for these active-peptides. Based on IC50 values, melittin has a stronger citotoxicity than magainin I and magainin II. On the other hand, magainins appears to posses higher haemolytic properties than melittin. The less cytotoxic peptide seems to be mastoparan. These types of results are very useful to characterize the ability of AMPs to induce toxic effects in human body during the treatment.

The melanocyte-inhibiting factor (MIF-1), which is the tripeptide Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2, was isolated in the conventional way from bovine hypothalamus tissue. MIF-1 represents a class of naturally occurring opiate antagonists with varying activities in independent situations. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the analgesic activity of MIF-1 and its analogues modifi ed at position 2 with unnatural amino acids Cav, sLys, sLeu, sIle and sNle. The experiments were carried out on male Wistar rats (180-200 g). The changes in the mechanical nociceptive threshold were measured by the paw-pressure test using an analgesiameter (Ugo Basile). MIF-1 and analogues (all in dose 1mg/ kg) were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). MIF-1 exhibits a weak analgesic effect and selective affi nity for the -opioid receptor. MIFanalogues -MIF-Cav, MIF-sLeu, MIF-Ile and MIF-Nle were found to have a naloxone-reversible analgesic effects. PACAP (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide) exists in two biological isoforms, i.e a 38-amino acid peptide and a shorter form of 27 residues corresponding to the N-terminal part of PACAP38. Previous structure-activity relationships studies revealed that the N-terminal segment is essential for the activation of the specifi c and selective type I PACAP receptor (PAC1). In order to clarify the molecular requirements for PAC1 activation, we initiated structure-activity investigations of the N-terminal part of both PACAP isoforms. In particular, an important library of analogs focusing on the fi rst seven residues (His1-Ser2-Asp3-Gly4-Ile5-Phe6-Thr7) was rationally developed and pharmacologically evaluated for their capacity to bind the PAC1 receptor and to induce Ca2+ mobilization in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the human PAC1 receptor. Ala scan demonstrated that the carboxylic acid function of residue Asp3 and the benzyl group of Phe6 are essential feature for proper PAC1 receptor activation. The inversion of chirality of residues Ile5, Phe6 and Thr7 caused a loss of affi nity whereas the incorporation of D-amino acids in positions 1, 2 or 3 did not affect the binding properties of PACAP. Moreover, using a N-methyl scan, we showed that the N-terminal domain of PACAP is not tolerant to back-bone modifi cations. However, replacement of Ser2 by Pro did not decrease signifi cantly the potency of the peptide while substitution of this same residue by D-Pro totally inhibited the biological activity of PACAP. Furthermore, other structural constraints reduced the potency of PACAP, suggesting that the N-terminal domain needs fl exibility to bind and activate the PAC1 receptor. Finally, residues 28-38 of C-terminally extended peptides played a favorable role for the binding affi nity towards the PAC1 receptor as PACAP38 analogs demonstrated highest binding affi nity compared to their PACAP27 counterparts.",

Besides Pseudomonas aeruginosa, there is increasing evidence that other multidrugresistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are implicated in the activation of the infl ammatory response in CF patients. Cationic host defence peptides, multifunctional mediators of the innate immune system, have been recognised as promising candidates for the development of novel antimicrobial agents (1). Most of these macromolecules are produced as inactive prepropeptides and are proteolytically activated to release a C-terminal cationic peptide with antimicrobial activity. We thought to mimic this natural mechanism to target CF pathogens with synthetic host defence propeptides. Saltresistant, all-D cationic antimicrobial peptides (2) were conjugated at their N-termini to a polyglutamic acid sequence to compensate the net positive charge of the parent peptide, through a linker selectively degraded by a disease-associated enzyme (neutrophil elastase). In Vitro effects of the all-D P18 peptide candidate on planktonic and biofi lm forms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates were assessed. Reactivation studies of the propeptide were performed in presence of purifi ed neutrophil elastase and in physiologically relevant conditions, using bronchoalveolar lavage fl uids from CF patients. The NMR structures of the propeptide and active P18 sequences were also compared. These studies confi rmed that the propeptide remains inactive in the absence of neutrophil elastase and that the latter enzyme can potentiate its antimicrobial activity. ",

Both 26RFa and GPR103 mRNAs are highly expressed in hypothalamic nuclei of rodents, and icv injection of 26RFa induces a potent orexigenic effect in mice. Recently, it has been shown that GPR103-defi cient mice suffer from osteopenia. Analysis of the 26RFa precursor reveals that it may generate several additionnal RFa-peptides including an N-terminally extended form (43RFa) and a truncated form (26RFa (20-26) ). 26RFa and 43RFa increase dose-dependently [Ca 2+ ]i in GPR103-transfected cells while 26RFa(20-26) is about 100 times less potent than 26RFa. Molecular modeling under NMR constraints of 26RFa shows that the N-terminal region encompasses an -helix and the C-terminal region adopts a -turn in DPC micelles. The C-terminal peptide 26RFa(20-26) exhibits major distortions of this turn that may be responsible for its weak potency. The aim of this work was to introduce an aza 3 residue in 26RFa(20-26) in order to stabilize the -turn. Sequential aza 3-counterpart substitution of amino acids at positions 20 and 21 enhanced by 2 and 7 folds the potency of 26RFa(20-26), respectively. The aza 3-Phe 22 analog was 2 times less potent than 26RFa(20-26). Replacement of the native Ser 23 by the aza 3 surrogate of (HO)homoThr (aza 3-Hth) to favor hydrogen bonding, generated an analog that was 2 folds more potent than 26RFa(20-26). In contrast, substitution of residues 24 to 26 led to analogs totally devoid of effect on calcium mobilization. As the -turn is centered on the Ser 23 of 26RFa, we can assume that the aza 3-Hth 23 moiety partially mimics the -turn in the 26RFa(20-26) sequence. These data constitute the fi rst step towards the development of new GPR103 analogs that could prove useful for the treatment of feeding disorders and/or osteoporosis.

It is well known that microtubule targeting agents (MTAs) are used in clinical treatments as anticancer agents. Recently, it has become clear that some MTAs also function as gvascular disrupting agents (VDAs), which induce tumor-selective vascular collapse. As one of such candidates, a natural cyclicdipeptide, phenylahistin (PLH) exhibiting colchicine-like anti-microtubule activity, has been our focus. We have succeeded in synthesizing PLH, and performed the structure activity relationship study of its derivatives. From the biological evaluations, According to these results, a highly potent derivative NPI-2358 (IC50 = 15 nM, HT-29) was selected, which is now in Phase I clinical trial as an anticancer drug in the US. Furthermore, we have established the synthetic route of NPI-2358 and its derivatives. About 100 analogs were prepared so far and screened by HT-29 citotoxicity assay. As a result, several highly potent derivatives ware developed. Although NPI-2358 and its derivatives are believed to be recognized around the colchicine binding site on tubulin, the three-dimensional structure of NPI-2358 could not be superimposed over that of colchicine. In order to understand the precise binding mode of NPI-2358, we developed a highly potent cytotoxic derivative, KPU-244 (IC50 = 3.9 nM, HT-29 cells) with a benzophenone structure. Because benzophenone is recognized as a photo-reactive group, we synthesized biotin-tagged KPU-244 derivative as a photoaffi nity probe. Since this probe has biological activity enough to function to tubulin, photoaffi nity labeling was performed to analyze the binding site. As a result, irradiation-time-dependent labeling towards tubulin was observed. The labeling was also dose-dependently inhibited by colchicines addition, suggesting that the probe specifi cally recognizes around the colchicine binding site on tubulin. Chemical biology study for determining the precise binding site is now in progress.",

We have recently investigated by spectroscopic means two members of this AMP family Temporin L (FVQWFSKFLGRIL-NH2) and Temporin A (FLPLIGRVLSGIL-NH2) (1).

Biological data indicate that Pro3TL has a higher antimicrobial activity and a lower hemolytic activity than the native peptide TL. In contrast, Gln3TA more hemolytic than the parent peptide TA. The conformational behavior of the new analogues was investigated in membrane mimetic environment (SDS and DPC micelles) by spectroscopic and computational methods. Diagnostic NMR parameters observed for Glu3TA and Pro3TL indicate a conformational propensity toward helical structure. For Glu3TA, Bturn structures are also observed along the N-terminal fragment of the peptide.

These bile acid-binding peptides are known to disrupt the micellar formation of bile acid for capturing intestinal cholesterol, and lead the aggregates pass the intestine without absorbance. Such effect also disrupts the hepatic circulation of bile acids, which accelerates the conversion of stored cholesterol into lacking bile acids. However, traditional extraction procedure of peptides form natural products is time-consuming. Therefore, to enhance the screening of such functional short peptides, we have combined the array-based screening strategy with bioinformatics strategy, to design effective experiments by prediction of physicochemical peptide structures. As a result, we resulted in signifi cantly higher screening effi ciency and high bile acid affi nity compared to random screening.

Adrenomedullin (AM) is a 52-amino acid peptide that shares structural similarities with regulatory peptides belonging to the calcitonin family (calcitonin, CGRP and amylin). AM is known to produce a potent vasodilation via the coupling to the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) associated with a chaperone protein, the receptor-activity modifying-protein (RAMP). Binding studies performed in mammalian tissues revealed that the largest distribution of AM binding sites was found in the heart and lungs. In fact, the pulmonary blood vessels display a vast abundance of AM binding sites that act as clearance receptors. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a condition associated with obliteration of pulmonary arterioles which carries a very poor prognosis, in part because of delayed diagnosis due to the lack of specifi c noninvasive diagnostic tools. Likewise, there currently exists no molecular imaging agent to diagnose pulmonary embolism, a pathological condition that occurs when a blood clot blocks a lung artery. Therefore, due to the high density and incidence of AM receptors in the cardiorespiratory system, AM could represent a key-target for diagnosis with radiolabeled AM-related drugs. In this study, we looked at structureactivity relationships and synthesized various AM fragments exhibiting high binding specifi city for AM receptors but reduced biological activity. Moreover, we introduced different chelating moieties into these AM peptides to evaluate the possibility of labelling those molecules for imaging purposes. Using cell binding assays, we observed that a cyclic moiety combined with the AM(22-52) sequence is able to maintain a good affi nity for AM receptors. Furthermore, we showed that the incorporation of a 4-amino acid sequence into the peptide chain was the best chelating moiety that allows high effi ciency labelling with 99mTc.",

After 99m Tc-labeling, radiopeptide internalization was studied in AR4-2J cells. Biodistribution of [ 99m Tc]Demotates was studied in healthy Swiss albino mice and for [ 99m Tc]Demotate 1, 2, 3 and 6 in AR4-2J tumor bearing mice. Results: Demotate 1 showed the highest affi nity binding for the hsst 2 and the rsst 2 , while introduction of one Asp linker(s) at the N-terminus diminished the affi nity for the hsst 2 and the rsst 2 and led to lower internalization rates. Substitution of Thr 8 by Asp 8 in Demotate 6 resulted in good affi nity for the rsst 2 and lower affi nity for the hsst 2 . Single (D)Phe 1 -substitution/5 or Thr 8 substitution by Asp 8 combined with Asp introduction at the Nterminus/7 led to inferior binding affi nity, poor internalization capacity and poor uptake of the respective radiopeptides in target-organs and, in the case of [ 99m Tc]Demotate 1, 2, 3 and 6, in AR4-2J tumors in mice. Conclusion: Introduction of Asp residues in the original [ 99m Tc]Demotate 1 chain exerted a negative effect on receptor affi nity, internalization capacity and targeting of somatostatin binding sites in mice precluding their use as hydrophilic pharmacokinetic modifi ers. The family of secreted aspartic proteinases (SAPs), which are encoded by ten distinct genes, is an important virulence factor of the human pathogen Candida albicans.(1) Due to an increase in the number of Candida strains that are resistant to the drugs currently used in therapy, these proteinases are highly promising new drug target candidates. Based on the knowledge of SAP2-substrate specifi cities(2)and X-ray structural studies of SAP2 in complex with inhibitors,(3) we designed and synthesized a series of SAP inhibitors by modifying the structure of the pentapeptide pepstatin A, which is a potent yet non-selective aspartic proteinase inhibitor. These inhibitors were synthesized manually via a SPPS methodology using a 2-Cl-tritylchloride resin and Fmoc-protected amino acids. In addition, the key residue of the designed peptide inhibitors, the -amino acid statine (Sta), which was prepared according to a slightly modifi ed literature procedure,5. was further protected at its hydroxyl group as a silyl ether for the purpose of avoiding competitive side reactions during amino acid couplings. We prepared 9 new inhibitors by varying the pepstatin A structure at the P3, P2, or P2' position. All variants showed effi cient inhibition when screened against the isoenzymes SAP1, SAP3, and SAP6, and some of them exhibit IC50 values similar to or even lower than that observed for pepstatin A. Peptide library is a general technique for screening specifi c peptides that bind to a target protein. But, in a standard screening method, peptide libraries need to be fi xed on large carriers like phage, beads and so on. The large carriers would affect the binding between peptides and the target protein. In this work, we develop a new method for screening peptide libraries without carriers. We attached a variety of fl uorescent amino acids to peptide libraries and the peptides that bind to target proteins were identifi ed through 2-dimensional fl uorescence spectroscopy in aqueous solution. In this presentation, 36-different fl uorescent amino acids were synthesized or purchased. Of those amino acids, we newly synthesized 30 fl uorescent amino acids. 2-D fl uorescence spectra of those amino acids were measured. They were different in fl uorescence excitation/emission wavelengths. Excluding those of weak fl uorescence intensities, 15 fl uorescent amino acids are selected. Those 15 fl uorescent amino acids are mixed in methanol/water (pH7.4) (=1/1(v/v)) and the 2-D fl uorescence spectrum was measured. Then, concentrations of the component amino acids were evaluated by a linear least-squares method. The results suggested that all fl uorescent amino acids can be quantifi ed. The set of fl uorescent amino acids combined with the 2-D fl uorescence spectroscopy technique will be a powerful tool for screening peptides and other drug compounds without using any carriers.",

The permeability of these compounds was studied by Parallel Artifi cial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA) and Immobilized Artifi cial Membrane chromatography (IAMC) so as to select the best peptides in terms of length, terminal groups and amino acid replacement to be used as carriers that pass through a model of blood-brain barrier (BBB) by passive diffusion for non-permeating agents. Furthermore, their enzymatic stability in human serum and their cell viability were tested by MTT assay. These peptide families showed great stability and nontoxicity. The three best peptides were coupled to levodopa and assessed. These peptides transferred levodopa through an artifi cial membrane and transformed it from a non-passive permeating drug into a compound able to cross the membrane by passive diffusion. The structure-activity study of insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) requires the design and synthesis of various analogues. In order to test these for their receptor binding affi nity, a high-throughput receptor binding assay is needed. We have therefore developed an effi cient solid phase synthesis protocol to prepare specifi cally mono-labeled human insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) for the study of its interaction with its G-protein-coupled receptor, RXFP2. A commercially available chelator, diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), was coupled to the N-terminus of solid-phase bound INSL3 A-chain and then a coordination complex between Eu 3+ and DTPA chelator was formed. After combination of the purifi ed Aand B-chains together with sequential formation of the three insulinlike disulfi de bonds, the labeled peptide was purifi ed at high yield using high-performance liquid chromatography with high pH buffer to prevent the liberation of europium from chelator. Saturation binding assays were undertaken to determine the binding affi nity (pK d ) of labeled INSL3 for RXFP2 in HEK 293 stable cell line expressing RXFP2. The binding affi nity of DTPA-labeled INSL3 (9.05 \u00b1 0.03) was comparable to that of 125 I-labelled INSL3 (9.59 \u00b1 0.09). The effi cient solid-phase synthesis has provided a novel lanthanide-coordinated, DTPA-labeled INSL3 with excellent sensitivity, stability and high specifi c activity and which is superior to the traditional 125 I-INSL3. This labeled peptide can be used in a high-throughput screening of INSL3 analogues in structure-activity studies. Multimodal tumor imaging using MRI and PET/SPECT provides comprehensive diagnostic information as it combines anatomical information (by MRI) and functional information (by PET or SPECT). Development of DOTA-derived imaging probes is advantageous for multimodal imaging as it accommodates many metal ions employed in different imaging modalities including Gd(III) for MRI. However, high relaxivity and enhanced specifi c up-take at the targeted site is important for the Gd-based MRI contrast agents. The DOTA-based prochelators required for the multivalent vectorization of targeting ligands were synthesized by functionalizing cyclen or DO2A-tertbutyl ester with modifi ed glutamic acid. Multivalent conjugation of bombesin peptides, which specifi cally target tumors expressing gastrinreleasing peptide (GRP) receptors, yielded the corresponding mono-, di-, and tetravalent bombesin analogues. The conjugates showed excellent chelating properties with Gd(III) (for MRI applications) and also with 111 In, 177 Lu and 68 Ga (for radiopharmaceutical applications). The 111 In and 177 Lu labeled divalent conjugates showed rapid internalization and slower externalization rate compared to their corresponding monovalent analogues as studied with prostate tumor cell lines. The gadolinium complexes of monovalent and divalent conjugates showed signifi cant relaxivities at 60 MHz ranging from 9.3 to 19.2 mM-1s-1 at 25\u00b0C. The values represent the 2 to 4 fold enhancement of relaxivity compare to clinically employed Dotarem\u00ae (Gd-DOTA). Further, the relaxivities increased signifi cantly from monovalent to divalent conjugates. This is highly promising as we would expect much higher relaxivities in case of tetravalent conjugates, which are currently under investigation. In conclusion, the work demonstrates the development of high relaxivity multivalent bombesin analogues, which could be employed for the multimodal imaging such as PET/MRI or SPECT/MRI with improved tumor targeting capabilities.",

The somatostatin receptors were successfully targeted with peptides labeled to -emitters ( 111 In, 67 Ga and 99m Tc) and positron emitters ( 18 F, 68 Ga, 86 Y) for diagnostic imaging. For tumor targeting, radiolabeled agonists were developed as they usually trigger the internalization of the peptidereceptor complex. We have recently shown that somatostatin-based radiolabeled antagonists may not only have a higher tumor uptake than equipotent agonists but also a longer lasting tumor uptake. Among the most promising receptors to be targeted, the bombesin receptors are of great interest as they are overexpressed in major human tumors such as prostate and breast. The aim of this study was to develop a radiolabeled bombesin-based antagonist conjugated to the macrocyclic chelator DOTA which allows effi cient and stable labeling with a variety of two-and three-plus charged radiometals for imaging (PET, SPECT). We compared its in vitro pharmacologic properties and biodistribution in the PC-3 mouse model side-by-side with the potent agonist [ nat,111 In]-DO3A-CH 2 CO-G-4-aminobenzoyl-Q-W-A-V-G-H-L-M-NH 2 (AMBA). In(III)-AMBA was shown to be a potent agonist by Ca 2+ fl ux and immunofl uorescence studies and In(III)-RM1 was effi ciently antagonizing the activity of In(III)-AMBA. The pharmacokinetics showed a distinct superiority of the radioantagonist with regard to the high tumor uptake as well as to all tumor to normal tissue ratios. [ 68 Ga]-RM1 showed similar pharmacokinetic than [ 111 In]-RM1 with a lower initial kidney uptake and a faster wash out from the kidney. The PET/ CT scintigraphic studies of [ 68 Ga]-RM1 in the animal model confi rm the signifi cant high tumor uptake and tumor to background ratio. As we found for somatostatin receptor-targeting radiopeptides,bombesin-based radioantagonists also appear to be superior to radioagonists for in vivo imaging and potentially also for targeted radiotherapy of GRPr-positive tumors Cell penetrating peptides (CPP) are a special class of peptides that possess the property to traverse the formidable barrier of the plasma membrane and deliver cargos into cells. Using CPP as vectors and DNA, mRNA or proteins/enzymes as potential intracellular targets, a new generation of intracellular contrast agents (CAs) can be developed. These agents have prospective use for molecular imaging (both optical and magnetic resonance imaging) by targeted labeling of cells. Aiming to image the presence of specifi c mRNAs or enzymes, two mRNA targeting (contains a PNA sequence antisense or non-sense to the target mRNA of DsRed) and one enzyme targeted (contains a unit cleavable by -galactosidase) CAs were tested for their activity in the presence and absence of respective targets. The antisense targeting CA, their nonsense derivative and the enzyme targeted CA were taken up effi ciently into cells by an exclusively endosomal mechanism as observed by fl uorescence microscopy. Cell free binding assays proved a specifi c interaction with a synthetic target for the antisense but not for non-sense CA. Magnetic Resonance studies showed a higher uptake in transgenic DsRed expressing cells than the parent cells. However, no difference was observable for antisense versus non-sense CA in DsRed cells, due to the vesicular entrapment which is preventing the specifi c interaction between CA and cytosolic target. Since a comparable cellular distribution was visible for the enzyme targeted agent, a specifi c accumulation in -galactosidase containing cells is also unlikely. The results show that even though the designed CAs were effi ciently taken up into cells, they can interact specifi cally with the target only if colocalization is achieved. However, a lack of specifi city is caused by the endosomal entrapment. Further modifi cations are required to achieve the release from endosomes or a direct uptake into the cytosol. ",

However, a biodistribution study revealed that the slow binding kinetics FROP-DOTA (H-Glu-Asn-Tyr-Glu-Leu-Met-Asp-Leu-Leu-Ala-Tyr-Leu-Lys(DOTA)-Cys-NH2) allowed the excretion to forestall a signifi cant tumor accumulation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the conjugation of PEG to FROP-DOTA results in a derivative with a prolonged residence time in the blood. FROP-1 bearing a C-terminal DOTA residue to allow labeling with In-111 and a cysteine to attach a maleimido-modifi ed 2000 Da PEG oligomer was obtained by solid phase synthesis. The conjugate was purifi ed by size exclusion chromatography. Several attempts to couple different PEG derivatives on the solid support did not proceed satisfactorily and therefore the PEG residue was attached in solution. The breast cancer cell line MCF-7 showed a relative low accumulation of the PEGylated peptide in the cells. In contrast, biodistribution studies of the labeled conjugate in mice bearing human FRO82-2 showed a time dependent increasing uptake of the PEGylated peptide with a high retention (at 24 h p.i. 76% of the maximal activity concentration persisted in the tumor). The highest uptake values were determined at 120 min. p.i. reaching 2.3 %ID/g tumor as compared to 0.06% %ID/g observed for the non-PEGylated derivative at 135 min p.i.

CooP peptide was conjugated with the DTPA (diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid) via amino terminus and labeled with 111Indium. Imaging was performed in four different time points (15 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours & 24 hours), and the organ and tissue specifi c radioactivity was measured after the scarifi cation of the animals.

The amount of the peptide increased with time and a clear radioactive accumulation was seen in 1 /3 animals at 1 hour and in 5 / 6 animals at 2 hours after injection. Due to the small size of the DTPA-peptide conjugate the majority of the molecules were secreted via the kidneys during the fi rst 15 minutes. At 2 h timepoint the tumorto-brain tissue ratio was 11,5.

The ability of the peptide to differentiate between responding and nonresponding cancers after treatment could be utilized for the development of promising tracers to monitor cancer therapy. The goal of this study was to investigate whether radiolabeled derivatives of the HVGGSSV motif can be used for the noninvasive determination of therapy response in vivo.

A glycine linker was placed at the N-terminus to separate the peptide motif from the chelator. In order to obtain derivatives accessible to radioiodination a tyrosine was introduced at the N-terminus (H2N-YGGGHVGGSSV-CONH2) of the second peptide. The third peptide was biotinylated at the N-terminal amino group and bound to radioiodinated streptavidin (SA-Biotin-GGGHVGGSSV-CONH2).

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a binary therapeutic modality which is currently under investigation for the treatment of several kinds of malignancies. It relies on the interaction of two individually harmless components: a photosensitiser and an external radiation. The interaction of the photosensitiser with light of the appropriate wavelength and molecular oxygen results in the generation of cytotoxic species, namely singlet oxygen and/or radicals, and localized destruction of tumours or infected tissue. In 5-aminolaevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT), exogenous administration of ALA is employed to generate elevated intracellular levels of the natural photosensitiser protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), via metabolism through the haem biosynthetic pathway. However this approach suffers from several drawbacks associated with ALA's lack of stability at physiological pH and its highly hydrophilic nature, which prevent it from crossing biological membranes and hence limit tissue penetration. ALA delivery with synthetic peptide prodrugs is a promising way to address these problems. In this work we report the synthesis and characterisation of a series of peptide prodrugs of general structure Ac-Xaa-ALA-OR, where Xaa is an alpha amino acid, chosen to provide a prodrug with appropriate lipophilicity and water solubility. The uptake of the compounds and metabolism to PpIX in PAM212 keratinocytes, relative to ALA is evaluated by fl uorescence spectroscopy, and further quantifi ed by recovery and chemical derivatisation of intact/ partially metabolised prodrugs. In a parallel study, we have also explored the possibility of coupling of ALA and ALA prodrugs to cell penetrating peptides (CPP). The conjugation of one or more molecules of ALA to a CPP sequence represents an interesting approach to enhanced topical delivery of ALA. Preliminary results of these studies are reported herein.

Temozolomide (TMZ) as an oral applicable chemotherapeutic substance has been proven to be effective and well tolerated with toxicity especially for brain tumors. Unfortunately TMZ was ineffi cient in the treatment of symptomatic progressive hormone-refractory prostate cancer. This may have different reasons like the short plasma half-life of TMZ, a non adapted application schema and as a result, an insuffi cient bioavailability. To improve the specifi city, we built our so called TMZ-BioShuttle-construct with cathepsin B (CTSB) mRNA specifi city. This complex combines, a transmembrane transporter molecule connected via a disulfi de bridge to an antisensepeptide nucleic acid (PNA) against a docking site in exon 1 of the CTSB mRNA. Furthermore this part is connected via a CTSB cleavable peptide substrate to a nuclear localization sequence coupled with TMZ. Inside the target-cell, the PNA recognizes the cytoplasmic CTSB mRNA and after annealing (the PNA/RNA hybride is not a substrate for RNAse H) results in a cell-specifi c retention of the TMZ in the cytosol especially of CTSB-expressing cells. Then, after the cathepsin B-mediated cleavage in the cytoplasm, the NLS-sequence is separated and activated for an RAN/importin-mediated transport of the TMZ-cargo into the nucleus of the target cells. This BioShuttle-mediated TMZ transfer could be a step forward to a successful therapy with higher specifi city, avoiding adverse reactions and circumventing the previous therapy limiting situation. The intracellular delivery of protein segments and other bioactive molecules using membrane -permeable peptides has been investigated in multiple aspects. Most of the currently recognized Cell Penetrating Peptides (CPP) are of cationic nature and derived from viral, insect or mammalian proteins endowed with membrane translocation properties. These peptides enter the cell by a receptor independent mechanism, which is poorly understood and carry only one epitope. Our target was to achieve a cell-penetrating carrier able to transport more than one bioactive molecule. To this aim we designed a Cell Penetrating Sequential Carrier (CPSC) formed by the repetitive -Lys-Aib-Cysmoiety, which incorporates the cysteine residue for anchoring the bioactive molecules through a thioether bond. The lysine free side chain possesses the cationic nature of the construct while the \u00e1-amino isobutyric moiety could induce a 3 10 helicoid peptide backbone with amphipathic characteristics. To test the ability of the CPSC to penetrate the cell membrane we synthesized the carboxyfl uorescein -labelled CPSC, CF-[Lys-Aib-Cys(-CH 2 CONH 2 )] 4 -NH 2 , while the CF-Tat-Cys(-CH 2 CONH 2 )-NH 2 analogue, which is a small basic peptide that has been shown to deliver a large variety of cargoes into the cells, was used as a positive control. The results indicated that CPSC had a homogeneous distribution into the cytoplasm suggesting that CPSC may provide a new powerful biological tool for drug transportation.

In 2004 our laboratory described a novel group of CPPs: amphipathic proline-rich peptides. The principal advantages of these compounds are non-cytotoxicity, nonviral origin and high solubility in aqueous media. The best candidate for CPP among the amphipathic Pro-rich peptides was SAP (Sweet Arrow Peptide), (VRLPPP) 3 .(1) Derivatives with hydrophobic moieties, such as fatty acids or silaproline, have shown highly improved internalisation effi ciency; an all D-amino acid version of the CPP SAP was shown to be completely protease resistant and was evaluated in a preliminary in vivo study. CD and TEM studies regarding the self-assembly properties of this family of peptides highlight the possible role of aggregated species in the internalisation process. Finally, these CPPs have shown to be internalised via caveolae or lipid-rafts mediated endocytosis, which circumvents the lysosomal route of degradation. In order to test a challenging cargo for SAP, gold nanoparticles were conjugated to SAP. Thereafter, the transport of Au Np by SAP in HeLa cells has been studied by TEM. While Np alone are not internalised, Np-C-(VRLPPP) 3 are clearly uptaken. Studies with QDs (quantum dots) and EGFP as SAP cargo are currently being done in our laboratory. 1.

            "text": "Introduction: Crossing the plasma membrane is a prerequisite for intracellular targeted drug delivery. Cell penetrating peptides are actively used as the delivery tool for intracellular delivery of various cargos. However, confi nement of biomolecules into endosomes limits their use for intracellular targeting. Therefore, there is a need for vectors capable of transferring cargo molecules directly into the cytoplasm. Herein, we focus on the development of a novel CPP (derived from polypeptide Crotamine 1.) which shows an effi cient uptake at low concentrations ( 2.5 M) and cytosolic distribution along with vesicular uptake. Methods: Series of peptides were synthesized by Fmoc strategy, introducing mutations in Cro (27-39) (proposed CPP sequence in Crotamine). All were N-terminally labeled with fl uorescein isothiocyanate for optical imaging. Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) studies were done by substitution and/or deletion of amino acid residues in the sequence observing the uptake behaviour by fl uorescence spectroscopy and microscopy. Results: Amongst 60 synthesized peptides, one of shorter length showed the best intracellular delivery and cytosolic distribution at lower concentration (2.5 M) when compared to other CPP. Replacing or deleting cysteines had negative impact on internalization. Results also displayed the involvement of tryptophans in cellular uptake indicating, along with cationic amino acids, the importance of each residue in this optimized sequence. Conclusions: SAR studies identifi ed a novel cell penetrating peptide showing, besides of endosomal uptake, also an effi cient delivery into the cytoplasm at low concentrations. Thus, this peptide might prove useful for effi cient transmembrane delivery of agents directed to cytosolic targets. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is a DNA mimic consisting of the four common bases of DNA on a pseudopeptide backbone that makes it extremely stable in biological fl uids. Antisense PNA is targeted against mRNA in cytoplasm in a sequence specifi c manner. However, the main hindrance to the effective use of PNAs has been their relatively poor uptake by cells. Endosomal release or direct uptake into cytosol of agents is mandatory for attaining mRNA based targeting. There are reports on the cell penetrating peptide (CPP) based delivery system. It has also been reported that conjugates of cholesterol and siRNAs facilitate cellular import (1) . The aim of this study was to synthesize different sequences of cholesterol coupled antisense PNA and to compare its uptake characteristics with a CPP-PNA conjugate. The synthesis of PNA (anti-dsRed PNA (agcgcctgtacc), specifi cally targeted to mRNA of dsRed, a red fl uorescent protein) conjugated to CPP (d-Tat) or cholesterol was performed in fully automated synthesizer (Prelude, Protein Technologies, Inc.) using continuous solid phase chemistry. To increase the solubility in water, linkers (AEEA) and additional charged amino acids were coupled or the sequence of peptide, PNA and cholesterol was changed. All compounds were labelled with FITC to confi rm the cellular uptake by fl uorescence microscopy and spectroscopy. Cell uptake studies showed that the CPP bound PNA was located predominantly in vesicles indicating an endosomal uptake mechanism and subsequent entrapment in vesicles. Cholesterol bound PNA was also effi ciently internalized. However, it was also located inside vesicles without detectable cytosolic distribution. PNA-Cholesterol has fewer synthetic steps than PNA-CPP. However, it was also located inside vesicles restricting its applicability for mRNA targeting. The effi cient uptake might make it a promising cellular delivery agent after further improvements. Opioids are gold standards in pain treatments. Unfortunately, fast development of tolerance and dependence creates limitations in application of these drugs in chronic pain treatment. Over twenty years ago we have proposed development of multitarget medicines as a new avenue of drug discovery. Identifi cation of numerous endogenous components that participate in the formation, transmission, modulation and perception of pain signals offers various strategies for the development of new analgesics. Neurotensin is an endogenous neuropeptide that play important regulatory role of pain transmission. Therefore, it was interesting to develop chimeric analogues that hybridize opioid and neurotensin active components. In such chimeric compounds the possible structural interference may signifi cantly infl uence on interaction of both components with target receptors and/or biological barriers transport systems. In this communication we present synthesis, pharmacological profi le and structural analysis of new potent chimeric compounds.

For instance, such molecules are used as structural probes for nucleic acids in solution, or in rational design of novel anti-infectives, since RNA is the genetic material of many pathogenic viruses. Here we represent design and synthesis of peptide-like molecules mimicking the catalytic site of natural ribonucleases (A and T1): Series F AA1 -AA2 -AA3 -Phe -OAlkyl; AA1 -Glu/Lys, AA2 -Thr/Ser/Lys, AA3 -Glu/ Lys/Thr/Arg; Series R Glu -X -Arg -Gly -OAlkyl; Series K Glu -X -Lys -Gly -OAlkyl; -Gly, -Ala, 4-aminobutyric acid, 6aminohexanoic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid; Series L AA3 -AA2 -AA1 -L1 (L2)-AA1 -AA2 -AA3 , L1 -4,9-dioxa-1,12-dodecanediamine, L2 -1,12-diaminododecane; AA1-AA3 -Glu, Lys, Ser, Arg. Ability of artifi cial RNases to RNA cleavage was shown in experiments with 96mer RNA HIV-1. The effi cacy of RNA cleavage depends on artRNases structure (for example, on location of negative and positive charged amino acids (Glu, Arg Lys) in peptide). The effi cacy of the most active compounds was 60-98 % at 18 h incubation. Anti-infl uenza activity in vitro of 12 such artRNases was investigated by inhibition of reproduction virus A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) in tissue cultures of chorioallantoic membranes (CCM) of 12-14 days age chick embryos.

FAP is over expressed on the surface of reactive stromal fi broblasts present in the stroma of human epithelial tumors. FAP is not expressed by tumor epithelial cells or by fi broblasts in other tissues, thus making FAP a pantumor target for pro-toxin development.

Different conjugates comparised each other. The synthesized bioconjugates analysized by choromatographic and fl uorometric methods. The fi nal product peptide was characterized by LC-MS and purifi ed by RP-HPLC. The bioconjugates were synthesized using different activation mechanisms and the different initial molar ratios (npeptide/npolymer = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) of the polyanions and the peptide. Also physicochemical properties of the bioconjugates were investigated. The structure and characterization of the synthesized conjugates was analyzed by various choromatographic and fl uorometric methods such as HPLC, GPC and Fluorescence Spectrometer. The reaction of high temperature solid-state catalytic isotope exchange (HSCIE)(1) between insulin and spillover tritium was studied. HSCIE reaction with the solid mixture containing 1 mg recombinant human insulin was performed for 10 min at 120o C using 5% Pd/BaSO4 catalyst. The product of the reaction was purifi ed by HPLC on Waters Delta-Pak C4 300A 3.9 x 150 mm column. Tritium labeled insulin with specifi c radioactivity 40 Ci/mmol and radiochemical purity of more than 98% was obtained. Performic acid oxidation of cysteine residues and subsequent acid hydrolysis were used to analyze the distribution of tritium. It was demonstrated that specifi c radioactivity of \u00c0 and B chains amounted to 8.2 and 31.8 Ci/mmol respectively. All the amino acids contained tritium and its content in His residues of the B chain was equal to 45%. Experiments for the evaluation of the biological activity of tritium labeled insulin were performed on CD-1 6-8-week-old awake male mice. Activity of labeled insulin was compared with the activity of standard insulin. Insulin was injected subcutaneously at a dose of 0.8 U/kg. Twofold statistically signifi cant lowering of glucose level was observed 40 min after injection (4,9 + 0,4 and 4,3 + 0,3 mmol/l for standard and tritium labeled insulin, respectively). Lowering of the glucose level in animals obtaining labeled insulin was the same, as in animals obtaining standard insulin. Thus, HSCIE reaction of insulin with tritium doesn't change its hypoglycemic activity. Cortexin is polypeptide (up to 10 kDa) brain extract accepted for clinical use in several countries including Russia due to its positive effects on memory, attention, and cortical processes. A synthetic peptide analog of Cortexin, Cortagen (Ala-Glu-Asp-Pro), was recently developed. The heptapeptide Semax (Met-Glu-His-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro) is an analogue of the ACTH(4-10) fragment, which is completely devoid of any hormonal activity associated with the full-length ACTH molecule. Both Cortexin and Semax are currently effectively used for treatment of brain hypoxia and ischemia with comparable clinical benefi ts. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the action in the brain are mainly unknown. In present work we studied effects of Cortagen, Cortexin, Semax, its analogue Pro-Glu-Pro (PGP) on glutamate-induced neuronal death and intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis deterioration in cultured cerebellar granule cells. Peptide drugs gain increased interest as a new supra-group of therapeutics between the classic-organic, small-molecule drugs and the large biotechnology-derived bio-drugs. They are used in different therapeutic areas like allergy, anti-infection, oncology, obesity, etc\u2026 Due to their particular structure and biochemical origin, pharmaceutical development of a peptide drug poses special challenges which will be discussed here, exemplifi ed by own research as well as literature data. Currently, there are about a dozen classical peptides described in pharmacopoeia, excluding the derived peptidomimetics like ACE-inhibitors. These pharmacopoeial peptide-drugs, together with the approved marketing authorisations of new peptidic entities, are a good starting point to look at the desired characteristics. Last, the regulatory developmental guidelines are in a general way seldom taken peptide drugs into account, leaving an interpretational gap between the two current main supragroups of therapeutics. After the initial active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) synthesis, analytical characterisation is aimed at integrity and purity evaluation of the API, which is also required for biomedical experiments. In this analytical characterisation, sample treatment issues like solubility and adsorption are considered as well. The chemical and plasma-metabolic stability, a critical parameter for peptides, is to be assessed to obtain kinetic and mechanistic information. Functionality is tested in vitro using cell-and organ-based protocols, including ligand binding studies, as well as in vivo encompassing ADME and target-organ confi rmation like brain. The pharmaceutical drugability information thus obtained allows further development decisions including required API modifi cations and proof-of-principle drug delivery formulations.",

CD analysis showed the small changes in the structure of the polymers upon metal binding.

The problem of anti-HCV vaccine development can be solved via a principally new approach, the creation of artifi cial synthetic immunogenic constructs with the help of bioinformatics and high-throughput screening technologies. Two approaches exist towards the development of anti-HCV peptide-based vaccines: one is to develop vaccines that stimulate cytotoxic T-cell response (peptides loading dendritic cells; the so-called \"cell vaccines\") and the second is to construct immunogenic peptides raising protective antibodies. However, the fi rst approach may lead to the massive hepatocyte death and the development of the heavy hepatic injury during HCV infection. In order to develop peptide immunogenic constructs able to raise antibodies against whole native HCV envelope proteins analysis of amino acid sequences of these proteins belonging to different HCV genetic variants has been performed. This analysis has allowed to choose the most conserved and presumably functionally important protein fragments. Immunogenicity of these fragments in the whole protein molecules has been determined and interaction sites for one of the putative HCV receptor, heparansulfate, have been revealed with the help of peptide scanning. Despite of the low immunogenicity of the most fragments inside the whole protein, antipeptide antibodies against them have been obtained via immunizing by conjugates of the peptides with certain carriers.

Nucleophosmin and survivin are overexpressed in tumor cells and exhibit an antiapoptotic activity. Their detection in tumor cells could be used for tumor differential diagnostics and selection of optimal chemotherapy scheme. Accumulation of pathogenic isoform of prion protein in brain causes the neurodegenerative prion diseases and antiprion antibodies as known could be used for immunotherapy of prion disorders. Alzheimer's disease (AD) development is accompanied by an accumulation ofamyloid peptides ( A) in brain and destruction of neurons . One of the AD development hypotheses assumed that A when binding to the alpha-7 AChR forms a complex that penetrates into the cells, resulting in the neurons death. We have proposed that alpha-7 AChR could be a new target in the AD therapy and antibodies against alpha-7 subunit could prevent its binding to A. Selected synthetic fragments of these four proteins were able in a free nonconjugated to a protein carriers state induce antibody response in experimental animals. Obtained rabbit antibodies against fragments of nucleophosmin and survivin were affi nity purifi ed. Antibodies against nucleophosmin detected monoand oligomeric forms of this protein in immunoblotting of HeLa cells lysates. Antibodies against survivin were able to detect this protein in immunohistochemical test of the breast cancer tumor samples. Rabbit antiprion antibodies interfered with patigenic prion isoform in ScN2a neuroblastoma cell culture. It was shown that synthetic alpha-7 AChR fragments induced the antibodies formation in mice with symptoms of AD which penetrated the blood brain barrier, regenerated the spatial memory and normalized the beta-amyloid level in animal's brain.

In this study we prepare carrier-protein (Bovine Serum Albumin Protein)-Synthetic peptide conjugates whit carbodiimide method by using 1-ethyl -3-(3dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). For one protein molecule we studied with different ratios of peptides (npeptid/ nBSA) and synthesized the conjugates at these ratios. Conjugates are purifi ed by using different column systems.

(1) . Several studies have revealed that it regulates cellular functions by binding components of intracellular transduction pathways. Recent reports also evidenced that it binds to phospholipase D (PLD1) and enhances its stability, resulting in increased intracellular levels of diacylglycerol(2), deregulating protein kinase C signalling and generating resistance to insulin action on glucose transport (3) . Thus, disrupting the interaction between these proteins by a cell-penetrating compound represents a novel strategy for improving insulin sensitivity in target cells. The expression of D4 domain, (the shortest PED-interacting region with PLD1) in L6 skeletal muscle cells stably overexpressing PED, reduces the interaction of this protein with PLD1 (4), suggesting that this region could bind PED preventing its interaction with the whole PLD1 and restoring insulin action. Aim of this work is the identifi cation of D4 crucial residues for PED interaction and the development of specifi c antagonists. We expressed three soluble truncated D4 domains, determining whether binds to PED like the D4 wild type, by carrying out dose-response ELISA. Only one of these regions exhibited an effi cacy similar to D4-wt and functional cellular data support this evidence. To further investigate the D4 residues involved in PED binding, we prepared a set of overlapping peptides covering the D4-region identifi ed. Our results suggest that the N-terminus region of D4 encompassing residues 762-801 is involved in PED/PEA15 recognition and, currently, cellular experiments on peptides are underway.",

A number of studies have adapted nucleic acids and proteins to the design of molecular logic gates and computational systems, while other works have affected computation in living cells via biochemical pathway engineering. We described recently the graph structure and experimental analysis of a self-organized synthetic peptide network (1-3).

In this study, we want to give a systematic overview on the possibilities of double helix formation in -peptides on the basis of ab initio MO theory. According to general principles, double helices with characteristic intermolecular hydrogen bonding patterns were generated and verifi ed as minimum conformations at the Hartree-Fock level employing the 6-31G* basis set. The calculations show several types of antiparallel and parallel double helices with different stability, which is strongly infl uenced by backbone substituents. The dengue virus causes a spectrum of clinical symptoms, ranging from mild dengue fever to the severe forms of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. There are four dengue virus serotypes (DEN1-4). The dengue virus NS3 protease is an attractive target for development therapeutics against dengue. The aim of the study was to investigate the prime side specifi city of dengue virus NS3 protease substrates using proteochemometrics, a new technology for drug target interaction analysis. A set of 48 internally quenched peptides were designed using statistical molecular design (SMD), synthesized and assayed with proteases of four subtypes of dengue virus for Michaelis (K m ) and cleavage rate (k cat ) constants. The obtained data were subjected to proteochemometrics analysis, concomitantly modeling all peptides on all the four dengue proteases, which yielded highly predictive models for both activities. The interpretation of the models suggested that considerably differing physico-chemical properties of amino acids (AA) contribute to K m and k cat activities. It was found that for k cat activity only P1' and P2' prime side residues played important role, while for K m all four prime side residues, P1'-P4', were important. High cleavage rate (characterized by k cat ) was obtained for peptides having small AA (Ser, Gly, Ala) at the P1' position and small or fl exible AA at the P2' position. For high affi nity (low K m ), at the P1' position AA should be small and moderately hydrophilic, while acidic residue is highly unfavorable. For the P2' position, the most favorable was Trp; however, this position allowed a broader diversity of AA. For the P3' position, Cys was more benefi cial than the AA present in native cleavage sites of the dengue polyproteins. For the P4' position, the best affi nity would be obtained with Ala, Gly or Cys. The models may be used to modify each P' substrate position to optimize separately substrate affi nity and cleavage rate for DEN1-4 proteases.",

To date, peptide studies typically derive sequences from a single identifi ed protein or (at the other extreme) screen random combinatorial peptides, often without knowledge of the signaling pathways targeted.

These proteins do not necessarily share a common fold since their three-dimensional structures can differ completely such that they are considered to be unrelated proteins. Surprisingly, we see on numerous occasions that similar ligands are often recognized in a very similar way by means of a common structural motif formed from main-chain elements of several consecutive amino acids within the ligand-binding site of the proteins. These short polypeptide segments can be found in many protein folds, and variations in their structure can often explain different elements of protein function. In particular, we have characterized the presence of a nucleotide binding motif present in more than 30 protein folds that function in part to recognize the adenine ring system in many essential biological ligands (e.g. ATP, NAD(P), FAD, FMN, CoA, etc.). Furthermore, a study of unrelated folds among pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzymes led to the characterization of a C NN structural motif for protein recognition of phosphate ions common to 104 fold-representative protein structures that belong to 62 different folds. Interestingly, amino acid side chains play little or no role in ligand recognition, explaining the evolutionary independence of such binding mechanisms (i.e. the motifs are found in unrelated folds), while possibly refl ecting the types of interactions that were characteristic of the earliest protein-ligand interactions during early stages of molecular evolution.",

            "text": "Bioinformatics meets medicine: Structure-based peptide design as a basis for drug development Here, we present different structure-based approaches on the design of peptides mimicking the whole surface, a specifi c region of a protein or even tumor markers. The potential of such methods stretches from the development of peptide-derived drug candidates to immunological screenings. Mimicry of binding sites: We have developed SUPERFICIAL, a program that proposes peptide libraries representing the entire surface or just regions of proteins. These peptides can be synthesised, e.g. using the SPOT-synthesis technique, and tested for their ability to mimic linear as well as non-linear binding sites. As a proof of principle, a library of peptides representing the surface of lysozyme was generated starting from a crystal structure of a lysozyme-HyHEL-5 complex. Adjacent sequence segments were linked by spacers to conserve local conformations. Disulfi de bonds were generated to tether the peptides. Binding assays against the HyHEL-5 antibody identifi ed several peptides representing the non-linear recognition site of the lysozyme. Translation of a tumor marker into peptides: The tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen GD2 is an established target for immunotherapy in neuroblastoma. We proposed peptidic mimics of this ganglioside for active immunisation against the tumor marker GD2 using molecular modelling. The ability of these peptides to mimic the carbohydrate moiety was verifi ed with in silico docking experiments. In a next step they were successfully tested as mimotopes in a mouse model. Design of switchable peptides: Photo-switchable compounds are becoming increasingly popular for a series of biological applications. Goal is the reversible photo-control of structure and function of biomolecules. A required death domain for the binding of proapoptotic proteins (e.g. Bak) to the hydrophobic groove of anti-apoptotic proteins is the BH3 helix. Inserting the photo-reactive compound hemithioindigo into this short peptide, stabilization towards proteolytic degradation is achieved. The identifi cation of peptides that bind to antibodies is an important step in characterizing antibody specifi city in order to study molecular recognition. Numerous approaches have been developed to select peptides that bind with desired specifi city and affi nity to antibodies of interest. In our study peptide arrays produced by Spot technology were used to develop and optimize binders to antibody derived by mutations from the anti-p24 (HIV-1) single chain Fv antibody, CB4-1. Three mutations were introduced in the complementarity determining region 3 of the light chain being in close proximity with epitope-homologous peptide. This mutated antibody had completely lost its affi nity for the epitope-homologous peptide. A substitutional analysis of epitopehomologous peptide was performed on cellulose, in which all positions of the peptide sequence were substituted by each of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. The peptides representing the binding activity in Spot membranes were synthesized using solid phase synthesis and their binding activity was confi rmed by fl uorescent polarization method. A substitutional analysis indicated that binding to mutated antibody could be restored and improved by combining favourable substitutions at the N-and C-terminal residues of the epitope-homologous peptide. This approach has allowed us to generate binders from non-binders to mutated antibody in high micromolar range. It is well known that physiological regulatory peptides that act as hormones and neurotransmitters are produced by the specifi c cleavage of their precursor proteins that per se have no biological functions. During these processes, many fragmented peptides are also produced from the same precursor proteins. It is expected that they may have various unexpected biological activities, but their biological functions have not been investigated in depth. The neutrophil-activating peptides we recently purifi ed turned out to be the peptides that are cleaved from mitochondrial proteins by proteolysis, suggesting that fragmented peptides produced by maturation and degradation of functional proteins may also have various biological functions [1, 2] . Therefore, we named such functional cryptic peptides hidden in protein sequences cryptides, and those cryptides that are derived from mitochondrial proteins \"mitocryptides\" in particular (3). We then identifi ed many mitocryptides by the combined investigation with \"dry\" and \"wet\" experiments, i.e., the sequences of mitocryptides that activate G proteins were predicted based on the distribution of charged and hydrophobic residues and their activities were examined on granulocytic cells. Receptors for these peptides were also characterized by the direct cross-linking experiments between peptides and their targeted proteins. Moreover, it is demonstrated the presence of a novel signaling mechanism involving mitocryptides. The comprehensive identifi cation of cryptides is expected to lead to the elucidation of various cryptic signaling mechanisms.",

We are carrying out detailed studies of this reaction in a series of fi ve, structurally rigid, hexapeptides of general sequences Boc-U x BU y MU z -OMe and Boc-U x MU y BMU z -OMe, where B = L-Bpa, U = Aib, M = L-Met, and U x +U y +U z = 4, with a view to determining the effects of spacer length (U y = 1-3) on the rate of the intramolecular excited state reaction and the chemical and 3D-structures of the resulting products. The triplet state lifetimes of the Bpa residues in the compounds, determined in a deoxygenated, dilute, acetonitrile solution by laser fl ash photolysis, vary in the following order: UBU 2 MU, = 60 ns; UMU 2 BU, = 190 ns; UBUMU 2 , = 350 ns; UBMU 3 , = 430 ns; and UBU 3 M, = 920 ns. In addition to the information these data provide on the structural requirements for intramolecular excited state quenching in the molecules, they also serve to defi ne the conditions necessary for optimal intramolecular reaction in preparative photolysis experiments. Accordingly, the products resulting from UBU 2 MU and UBUMU 2 have been prepared in high yields, isolated, and structurally characterized by HPLC, mass spectrometry, NMR, and CD techniques. For each of the two photoinduced macrocyclizations, two diastereomers, arising exclusively from the Bpa diradical regioselective attack on the Met S-methyl group, were found.",

How the backbone bound heteroatoms (OH, NH 2 ,F) infl uence the structure of a peptide is little known by now, both experimentally as well as theoretically. We performed several MD studies on the conformational behavior of centrally placed HAla( -Met) fl uoro and hydroxy analogues, HAla( -F) and HAla( -OH), as function of chirality and level of substitution to investigate the infl uence of these factors on secondary structure formation and stability. All -peptides were simulated in methanol solution at temperature of 340 K and a pressure of 1 atm using the GROMOS96 biomolecular simulation software and the GROMOS 45A3 force fi eld. The ensembles of trajectory structures were analyzed in terms of conformational space sampled by the peptide, folding behavior, structural properties such as hydrogen-bonding and in terms of the level of agreement with the available experimental NMR data, NOE's and 3 J-coupling constants.

Starting with backbone coordinates we found amino acid sequences by packing amino acid side chains with defi ned conformations (rotamers) into the core of -sandwich proteins. In a fi rst approach we have assembled four synthetic -hairpins on a cyclic peptide template (TASP) to form a -sandwich with two identical four-stranded antiparallelsheets. Improvement of surface residues reduced the aggregation of the proteins. Spectroscopic analysis shows a fold with a free energy near -25 kJ/mol and confi rms the -structure by CD and FTIR. We improved the design to a partial asymmetric -sandwich assembled from three different -hairpins. The synthesized molecule was the fi rst -sandwich molecule showing a defi ned fold in 2D-NMR. This data and results from the symmetric betabellins (1) suggest that symmetrical sheets do not fold into defi ned structures. To synthesize completely asymmetric sheets we simplifi ed the synthesis of -sandwiches by directed coupling of two four-stranded antiparallel -sheets. The computed proteins were selected for tight packing of the hydrophobic core and analyzed for a stable fold during dynamic simulations.

In these esters the site-specifi c group (charged amidinium) for the enzyme is included in the leaving group portion instead of being in the acyl moiety. Such a substrate is termed an inverse substrate (1) . Inverse substrates allow the specifi c introduction of an acyl group carrying a non-specifi c residue into the trypsin active site without recourse to a cationic acyl moiety characteristic of conventional substrates. We also showed in an earlier study that inverse substrates were applicable to enzymatic peptide synthesis. Therefore, a general method for the preparation of a variety of inverse substrates would be valuable. We designed two series of new type inverse substrates, p-(amidinomethyl)phenyl and m-(amidinomethyl)phenyl esters derived from N-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)aminoisobutylic acid, were prepared. We also analyzed the kinetic behavior of trypsin towards these synthetic esters (2) . They were found to be readily coupled with an acyl acceptor such as L-alanine p-nitroanilide to produce dipeptide. The optimum condition for the coupling reaction was studied by changing the organic solvent, pH, and acyl acceptor concentration. The optimum standard condition was selected as follow: acyl donor (inverse substrate), 1 mM; acyl acceptor (L-alanine p-nitroanilide), 20 mM; enzyme, 10 m; 50% DMSO-MOPS (50 mM, pH 8.0, containing 20 mM CaCl2); 25 \u017d.

Natural antimicrobial peptides, and their derivatives, have gained interest as potential anti-cancer agents. Under normal conditions, due to the asymmetric distribution of plasma membrane lipids across the bilayer, mammalian cells comprise phosphatidylserine (PS) only in the inner leafl et. In the case of malignant transformation inner leafl et PS can move to the outer leafl et and act as a surface marker. The surface exposure of negatively charged PS on various tumour cells makes these cells susceptible to killing by cationic membranolytic peptides such as NK-2 (1).The aim of this study is to develop short peptide sequences still acting selectively towards PS exposed on cancer cells without damaging healthy cells. In order to use this new strategy with PS-specifi c peptides it is necessary to analyze the lipid composition of mammalian cancer and non cancer cell membranes. Further as a basis for peptide activity studies the biophysical characteristics of cancer cell membranes and healthy counterparts with respect to lipid composition were determined by investigation of liposomal mimics composed of phosphatidylcholine and/or phosphatidylserine by DSC and X-ray. These model systems were also used to screen the activity of a series of peptides derived from NK-2. Fluorescence spectroscopy was applied to test the release of fl uorescence marker molecules from liposomes composed of solely PS, PC or PC/PS mixtures in the presence of various concentrations of peptides. Data revealed that some NK-2 derived peptides have a high affi nity towards PS causing signifi cant leakage of liposomal content, whereas healthy mammalian cell mimicking PC liposomes were not affected. Optimized peptides resulting from these experiments will be used for in-vitro studies on prostate cancer cell lines. In most moths, the sex pheromone production is regulated by pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide (PBAN), a 33-34 amino acid neuropeptide that is released from the subesophageal ganglion into the hemolymph in response to physiological and environmental cues. PBAN exerts its pheromonotropic effects by binding to PBANR, a member of the rhodopsin-like family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) that is predominantly expressed in the pheromone-producing cells of the female pheromone gland. The structure-activity relationship studies for Bombyx mori PBAN have revealed that the shortest peptide with pheromonotropic activity is the C-terminal pentapeptide-amide, PBAN(29-33)-NH 2 (FSPRL-NH 2 ), and that the C-terminal amide group is required for the pheromonotropic activity of PBAN.",

They are characterized by a conserved pro-region carrying individual, highly variable antimicrobial sequences, that become active only after proteolytic release, and with quite different structural and aggregational features that lead to differential biological effects on prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. LL-37 is the only human Cathelicidin, and displays a broad-spectrum, medium sensitive antimicrobial activity in vitro that is accompanied by some cytotoxicty towards eukariotic cells at antimicrobial concentrations, and a strong capacity to modulate host immune and healing processes at lower concentrations. These activities likely all involve interaction with biological membranes at some point, and are related to its amphipathic, helical structure and strong tendency to aggregate in specifi c conditions. The latter is an evolved feature absent in some primate orthologues, whose activities appear more limited to a direct antimicrobial action. The structural and aggregational behaviours of LL37 and selected primate orthologues were systematically investigated by biophysical and biochemical methods. These included CD spectroscopy in different buffers, SDS micelles or anionic or zwitterionic LUVs, transmission FTIR spectroscopy, dye release from liposomes, and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy on supported lipid monolayers, followed by atomic force microscopy to probe morphological effects on lipid order. Data was also collected from antimicrobial, cell lysis and cytofl uorimetric assays, giving a more complete picture of the possible mode of action of these helical peptides, and highlighting the importance of biochemical parameters such as structuring and dimerization/oligomerization processes in the selective interaction with biological membranes, leading to cytotoxic or immunostimulatory effects.",

Self-assembly of AMPs may result disruption of the membrane (outer/inner) structures of the microorganisms by forming pores or ion channels. However, high-resolution oligomeric structures of AMPs in lipid environments are diffi cult to obtain. To-date, oligomeric structure at atomic resolution of any antimicrobial peptide has not been reported. Secondary structures of AMPs are usually obtained in perdeuterated SDS or DPC micelles, as a mimic to the inner cytoplasmic membrane, by NMR spectroscopy. Cathelicidins comprise a major family of host-defense antimicrobial peptides in vertebrates. These peptides are synthesized as a part of large precursor proteins containing a well conserved cathelin domain and an extremely variable, in terms of length and amino acid compositions, Cterminal region. The C-terminal part of the cathelicidins is bestowed with antimicrobial and LPS neutralizing activities. Here, we report a tetrameric structure of a 22-residue active fragment of fowlicidin-1 or VK22, one of the fi ve cathelicidins found in chicken, in lipopolysaccharide by NMR spectroscopy. The tetrameric structure of the VK22 determined from trNOE is highly helical. A large number of trNOE cross-peaks were observed connecting residues far apart in the sequence. Calculated structures reveal an anti-parallel arrangement of four helices. The interface of the tetramer appears to be rich in polar or charged residues delineating a plausible pore or channel. Most of the non-polar residues are found to be exposed indicating plausible interactions with non-polar fatty acyl chains of LPS or with membrane in general. The oligomeric structure of VK22 peptide may be useful to understand structure/activity relationship, in particular pore formation, by the helical antimicrobial peptides.",

Charged as well as zwitterionic phospholipids have been used to study the adsorption of NK-2. The peptide adsorbs at the air-buffer interface due to its amphiphilic character. It also inserts into uncompressed phospholipid monolayers. The peptide reorients from random coil in bulk to -helix lying fl at at the interface. The incorporation of NK-2 into a DPPG monolayer leads to a different orientation (either -helix with an oblique orientation or random coil) and to the fl uidization of the aliphatic chains.

Fusogenic peptides (FPs) are active on membraneinterfaces and are instrumental in fusion of membranes which is vital for various fertilization and viral processes. Membrane fusion properties of short AMPs and CPPs have been seldom tested and have therefore eluded the attention of most investigators, instead only their cytotoxicity is investigated. There is general lack of understanding if these peptides are fusogenically active. We have investigated the ability of AMPs and CPPs to trigger membrane fusion. As an example, HIV-1-fusion peptide FP23 is used as benchmark to compare fusion activity of various AMPs and CPPs. Most FPs are believed to be unstructured or conformationally fl exible ( -helix or -sheet); therefore the secondary structure of the peptides before and after the fusion reaction is investigated and correlated to their respective ability to execute membrane fusion. Our results show that various AMPs and CPPs which are capable to switch their secondary structure are also able to promote fusion to an extent that is even higher than the known HIV-1 fusion peptide FP23.

Human GHRF is an amidated peptide consisting of 44 amino acids residues. A lot of studies has show that the residues N-terminal part are the active core of the peptide. We studied the interaction of human GHRF (1-29) with phospholipid membranes. The interaction of GHRF (1-29) with the liposomes was investigated fl uorescence spectroscopy. To detect a fl uorescence signal the peptide were labelled at fi rst, 15th, 24th and 29th position with Dansyl. The fl uorescence intensity of GHRF (1-29) at different lipid-peptide-ratios were analysed using a model, which includes the hydrophobic and the electrostatic interaction between the peptide and the phospholipid membrane. The hydrophobic binding constant of GHRF(1-29) and its effective charge were determined using this model. Further the peptides position in the membrane were investigated using spin labelled phospholipids, which are able to quench fl uorescence over large wavelength arrays. The quenching effi ciency will decrease by increasing the distance between fl ourophore and spin probe. The use of 15 mol% Tempo-PC, 5-Doxyl-PC, 10-Doxyl-PC and 16-Doxyl-PC in the phospholipid composition of the liposomes allows the determination of the peptides membrane penetration depth. All results indicate, that the binding of GHRF (AA 1-29) to phospholipid membranes is increased strongly by increase of the surface charge density of the liposomes.

Crafted by evolution into an extremely diversifi ed array of sequences and folds, AMPs do share a common amphiphilic 3-D arrangement. This feature is directly linked with a common mechanism of action that predominantly (although not exclusively) develops upon interaction of peptides with cell membranes of target cells. It is generally agreed that AMPs are essentially unstructured in the aqueous phase and fold upon contact with the membrane, adopting an amphiphilic fold. This favours absorption of peptides onto lipid bilayer and their subsequent integration into the membrane with expansion of the outer leafl et, which in turn leads to membrane thinning and permeabilization. However, recent observation suggest that things might be more complicated than previously believed. Indeed, MD simulations coupled to CD spectroscopy, studies with model membranes, and antimicrobial assays, have shown that, at least for some peptides, a signifi cant correlation exists between the conformation adopted by the peptide in solution, i.e. before the interaction with membranes, and its antimicrobial activity. The linear peptides we have studied following this approach include two members of the frog skin-derived temporin family, namely temporin A and temporin L, and two members of amphibian bombinins H, i.e. bombinins H2 and H4. We observed that the presence of a partially folded structure in water solution may facilitate, both thermodynamically and kinetically, the peptide folding in the microbial membrane, and thus favour biological activity. Looking for such built-in conformational characteristics could well help to rationalize the different spectrum and level of activity recorded for cationic alpha-helical AMPs on membraneenveloped targets, and assist the design of improved analogs and biomimetic synthetic peptides with antibiotic properties.",

We compared computational interaction models with measurements of antibacterial and haemolytic activity, Small Angle X-Ray and Surface Plasmon Resonance data, and structure predictions by Circular Dichroism (CD). All peptides were active against Escherichia coli (Gram negative) and Staphylococcus carnosus (Gram positive) bacterial cultures, but the haemolytic properties against human red blood cells were found to be poor and indicated the peptides' selectivity. CD studies of the peptide secondary structure confi rmed the prediction of peptide helicity. The antibacterial activity can be correlated with a change of the hexagonal phase transition temperature of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) as determined by Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). The calculated peptide membrane affi nity is not related in linear way with the antibacterial activity. The reason for this might be aggregation as shown by surface plasmon resonance. The inverse hexagonal phase transition temperature was increased by the peptides and this promotes a positive curvature of the membranes. We assume that this curvature fi nally leads to the disruption of the model membranes. In summary an over all helical structure, electrostatic and hydrophobic parameters as well as strong amphipaticity are good measures to describe antibacterial peptide interaction.",

            "text": "Kier, Brandon; Andersen, Niels University, UNITED STATES Over the last decade, -hairpins have emerged as excellent model systems for probing the intrinsic stabilities of portions of -sheet structure and for studying the sequence dependence of the folding dynamics of -strand association and alignment. For many decades, it has been established that peptide helices can be substantially stabilized (3 -7 kJ/mol) by starting the sequence with an N-cap (Acetyl, Asp or SEDE). No comparable strategy has appeared for reducing the end-fraying of -hairpins. Fully folded models of hairpins have typically been constructed by conversion to a cyclic system: inserting another turn favoring sequence (e.g. D-Pro-Gly, pG) at the end of the hairpin strands. We now report a set of favorable through-space interactions that can serve to cap -hairpins. The discovery followed from NMR studies of Ac-W-IXGK-WTG (X = p, N). These studies indicated a favorable face-to-edge (FtE) W1/W6 interaction which also allows for a G8-HN to W6 indole ring H-bond and the sequestration of the Thr hydroxyl by H-bonding to the Acetyl. These interactions produce spectroscopic diagnostics: a CD exciton couplet together with extreme upfi eld shifts for He3 of the C-terminal Trp (1.5 -2.1) and HN of the C-terminal Gly (2.7 -3.6 ppm). These feature disappear when X = L-Pro and the Gly-HN shift returns to its coil value (as in Ac-WTG) upon removal of the N-terminal Ac. In its most favorable application, CH3CH2CO-WIpGLWTGPS, we were able to establish that DGU at 280K was 8.9 kJ/mol (97.8% folded) by backbone HN H/ D exchange protection measures. We now report that these interactions are retained in longer hairpins. Peptides of the general formula, Ac-W-(ZZ)nINGK(ZZ)n-WTG (n = 1, 2, or 3) display enhanced fold stability. In each case, the Ac is essential to prevent end-fraying and to elicit the full set of chemical shift diagnostics of the \" -cap\". The unique structural features of polyproline peptides to adopt an extended, relatively rigid polyproline II (PPII) backbone conformation in aqueous solution, has led to their widespread application as a \"molecular ruler\" in biological and biophysical investigations. In the left handed PPII helix the peptide bonds show the all-trans conformation resulting in an interterminal distance, which increases by 2.8 to 3.1 \u00c5 per proline residue. The same backbone conformation has been identifi ed in important proline rich protein-protein recognition motifs involved in the regulation of physiological processes like transcription, cell growth, cytoskeleton rearrangement and postsynaptic signal transduction via modular SH3, WW or EVH domains. To investigate the structural features of polyproline and proline rich sequences by fl uorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and other spectroscopic methods, these peptides were labelled N-and C-terminally with different fl uorescent dyes. For synthesis of homopolymeric polyproline peptides with a sequence length of more than 20 amino acids a fragment condensation strategy has been applied to prevent the occurrence of shorter side products which can perturb distance measurement by FRET. Spectroscopic analysis of these peptides indicated that even for short polyproline sequences (< 5 residues) there is a remarkable deviation from the expected PPII conformation. FRET measurements revealed that polyproline peptides show an increase of the mean interterminal distance of about 1.7 \u00c5 per proline residue. Single molecule FRET measurements of polyproline peptides with a length of 21 amino acids point to a heterogeneous ensemble of different conformations caused by randomly distributed cis conformations resulting in diverse species with different interterminal distances. Similarly the structural consequences of the integration of non-proline amino acids in a polyproline sequence have been investigated by FRET.",

Peptide helix is a simple model system in which various contributions to helix formation can be dissected and understood qualitatively. Many strategies have been pursued to design peptide helices and notable results have been achieved even with very short sequences, but mainly these methods rely on the use of non natural amino acids or introducing constraints. In this communication, we report the stability characterization, via CD, NMR and MD studies, of a designed, -helical, 15-mer peptide, composed only of natural amino acids, which activates the VEGF-dependent angiogenic response (1). This peptide shows an unusual thermal stability whose structural determinants have been determined. Two factors, the N-terminal region and an hydrophobic interaction i, i+4, are found as playing a mayor role of this remarkable stability (2) . These results could have implication in the fi eld of protein folding and in the design of helical structured scaffolds for the realization of peptides to be applied in chemical biology. Adiponectin, a cytokine secreted by adipose tissue, which has been shown to affect lipid and glucose metabolism, attracts interest because it is a target for therapeutics in the metabolic syndrome. The molecule has a tendency to associate to form various multimers. Although this multimer formation could modulate its biological function, the details of this mechanism are still unclear. Thus studies on this system from the aspect of molecular assembly are interesting. The molecule consists of three domains, i.e. a variable (V), a collagen-like (C) and a globular (G) domain. The structure of the G domain determined by X-ray crystallography showed that it exists as a trimer but the remaining C and V domains have not been well characterized. We synthesized various parts of the molecule, C, G, VC, CG, and full length VCG in E. coli. The CD spectra of CG and VCG showed a positive peak around 230nm which is the hallmark of collagen structure. This may be attributed to the repeats of typical collagen type triplet, X-Y-Gly. The temperature dependency of these CD spectra showed the three states conformational changes of these peptides. The lower transition, where the positive peak disappeared corresponds to the melting of collagen like structure and the higher one corresponds to that of globular structure of the G domain. The apparent molecular weights determined by ultra-centrifugal analysis showed that these peptides exist in trimeric form at the intermediate state. However, neither C nor VC showed such transitions. These results showed that, contrary to our expectations, the contribution of the triplet of X-Y-Gly is not the dominant one for stabilizing the trimeric state. In order to explore the stabilizing factor, we are carrying out various experiments, such as mutation analysis, titration of Ca ++ , redox reaction of disulfi de bonds and so on. One result is that Ca ++ was shown to be a factor for increasing the thermal stability of the trimer.",

Jankowska, Elzbieta; Orlikowska, Marta; Radulska, Adrianna; Szymanska, Aneta University of Gdansk / Faculty of Chemistry, POLAND Cystatins are natural inhibitors of cysteine proteases -enzymes widely distributed in animals, plants and microorganisms. Human cystatin C (hCC) has been also recognized as an amyloidogenic protein directly involved in formation of pathological fi brillar aggregates which deposit in the brain arteries of elderly persons causing cerebral amyloid angiopathy (1). Our studies were performed to explore possibilities of preventing this lethal disease. The overall 3D architecture of monomeric human cystatin C is not known but its fold could be anticipated from the structure of the dimer which has been already determined (2) . The dimeric cystatin C is created through the exchange of 'subdomains' between two molecules (3D domain swapping) and consists of two identical subunits in great extent reconstituting the fold of the monomeric chicken analogue of hCC. It is possible that similar mechanism is involved in cystatin C oligomerization and fi brilization process. The most signifi cant structural changes during dimerization process are observed in the L1 loop (55-59, QIVAG). This loop occurred to be a hinge region in the 3D domain swapping event. With the aim to check implications of greater or decreased stability of this loop for dimerization and aggregation propensity of human cystatin C, we designed and construct hCC L1 mutants with Val57 residue replaced by Asp, Asn or Pro, respectively. The structural studies of these mutants and their thermal denaturation process have been performed by means of CD and FTIR spectroscopies. Results of these studies will be presented. ",

            "text": "Azobenzene-mediated photomodulation of a collagen triple helix monitored by IR spectroscopy (1), our most recent efforts were addressed to the design and synthesis of a photoswitchable collagen triple helix. By replacing in suitable positions of the Ac-(Gly-Pro-Hyp) 7 -NH 2 a Pro and Hyp residue with (4S)mercaptoproline, respectively, a side chain-to-side chain crosslinking of the collagen peptide was afforded with a purposely designed azobenzene derivative. As expected from modeling studies, self-association of the modifi ed collagen model peptide into a stable triple helix was observed with the trans-azobenzene clamp, while its photoisomerization to the cis isomeric state leads to unfolding processes as well assessed by NMR structural analysis (2) . Unfolding pathways can be studied by comparing FTIR difference spectra induced by temperature or light. We found the photomodulation of the triple helix to be reversible and the effi ciency of the photoisomerization increased with temperature reaching a maximum value shortly below the melting point. IR spectroscopy was thus used to identify the optimal temperatures required for structure destabilization at suffi cient extents to enable unfolding by the weak driving force of the azobenzene clamp. The results confi rmed the correctness of the design and the ability of the azobenzene switch to photocontrol this complex tertiary structure, thus allowing for time-resolved monitoring of the triple-helix unfolding process. Studies on various collagen model peptides (X-Y-Gly) 10 where X and Y are often imino acids, Pro or Hyp R (4(R)-hydroxyproline), have shown that Hyp R at the Y position plays an important role in stabilizing the collagen triple helix. However substitution of non-natural 4(S)-Hyp (Hyp S ) at both positions decreases the thermal stability of triple helix as (Pro-Hyp R -Gly)10 exists in a stable triple helical state, whereas (Hyp S -Pro-Gly)10 and (Pro-Hyp S -Gly)10 are in a single coil state. Similar effects on the stabilities of triple helices are provided by the substitution of fl uoroproline. However there is an exception that (fPro S -Pro-Gly)10 takes a triple helix at 4 C whereas the counterpart, (Hyp S -Pro-Gly)10, is in a single coil state. Although the difference could be explained by the steric hindrance of hydroxyl group in S confi guration, it is still controversial how much this hindrance could obstruct the triple helix formation. Therefore, even though apparently the tripeptide with the Hyp S -Pro-Gly sequence is not capable of triple helix formation, we could expected that (Hyp S -Pro-Gly) n forms a triple helix as n increases. The transition temperature of (Pro-Pro-Gly) n was shown to have the chain length dependency. Here, we synthesized (Pro-Pro-Gly) n and (Hyp S -Pro-Gly) n (n=10,15) and investigated their thermal stabilities. The CD spectra of (Hyp S -Pro-Gly)15 showed the conformational transition from collagenlike triple helix to random coil with the melting temperature at 21 C. The apparent molecular weight, determined by the sedimentation equilibrium method, showed that (Hyp S -Pro-Gly)15 exists as trimer at 4 C and as monomer at 37 C. The melting profi le was also clearly detected by DSC. @Thus, it is concluded that the existence of Hyp S at the X position is not essential to interfere the triple helix formation. We are on course to investigate the stabilizing mechanism of the collagen structure.",

            "text": "In this study we used -helical coiled coil based peptides as model systems to investigate the effects of serine-linked -galactose on both the secondary structure and amyloid formation tendency. Thehelical coiled coil structural motif consists of two to seven -helices which are wrapped around each other with a slight superhelical twist. Its simplicity and regularity have made it an attractive system to explore fundamentals of protein folding.(1) The importance of the coiled coil motif is obvious with the amount of 5% of all amino acid residues in the Protein Data Bank being part of a coiled coil motif. At fi rst we examined to which extent and at which positions a glycosylation is possible without destroying the coiled coil structure. Therefore, we systematically incorporated one to six serine-linkedgalactose units into several solvent exposed positions of a 26 amino acid long coiled coil peptide. The hydrophobic dimerization face was not modifi ed. The preformed L-Ser(Ac 4 --D-Gal)-OH building blocks were introduced by convenient solid-phase synthesis following the Fmocstrategy. Folding and stability of the glycopeptides were monitored by CD spectroscopy. The amyloid formation tendency was investigated by a ThT fl uorescence assay. Aging, associated with decreasing protein homeostasis (proteostasis) capacity and increasing oxidative stress, is a prominent risk factor for amyloid diseases. Alzheimer fs disease (AD), which is one of the most common amyloid diseases, involves intra-and extracellular amyloid formation by the amyloid bata peptide (Abeta). However, how Abeta can aggregate in vivo even though its physiological concentration (PC) is much lower than its critical concentration (CC) for aggregation is a mystery. We have proposed that covalent modifi cation of Abeta by small molecule oxidation products can explain how Abeta can form amyloid at PC. The aldehyde-bearing cholesterol oxidation product 1(2), which can modify Abeta by Schiif-base formation, is an example of the products that could affect AD onset. However, signifi cant questions about the modifi cation of Abeta by 1(2) persist, including: Does modifi cation by 1(2) lower the CC of Abeta aggregation into the PC range? And, is Abeta modifi ed by 1 (2) able to aggregate at low concentrations on a biologically relevant time scale? In this study, these questions are answered by studying chemically synthesized analogs of Abeta that are site-specifi cally modifi ed by 1(2) at Asp1, Lys16, or Lys28. Modifi cation at the different sites has a similar effect on the thermodynamic propensity for aggregation. In contrast, the effect of metabolite modifi cation on aggregation kinetics depended strongly on the modifi cation site. Abeta modifi ed at Lys16 formed amorphous aggregates fastest and at the lowest concentrations. In contrast, the appearance of thiofl avin-T positive aggregates at higher concentration was fastest for Abeta modifi ed at Asp(1). The infl uence of modifi cation site on the nature of the aggregates suggests that amorphous aggregation and fi brillization place different conformational demands on Abeta. Furthermore, these studies may partially explain how Abeta can aggregate at nM PCs when the CC of unmodifi ed Abeta is in the \u0192\u00caM range.",

The fact that the sequences of these AMPs are very different suggest rather non-specifi c mechanism to be involved. To pursue the latter in more detail we used F\u00f6rster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET) between labeled PLA 2 and temporin B. Interestingly, FRET coincides with concentration dependant activation of PLA 2 hydrolysis of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes. Accordingly, temporin B and PLA 2 interact forming a supermolecular complex terminating into amyloid-like fi brils (4). Homo-oligomeric fi bers are formed on a slower time scale when PLA 2 interacts alone on DPPC liposomes (5) .

Being random coil as initial state, a mixture of anti-parallel betasheet and alpha-helices emerges in time. In the presence of negatively charged phospholipids, hIAPP aggregates can be seen within a few minutes after titration. Also in absence of any free charges, as seen in water, fi brils grow and after an incubation for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C, some alpha-helices are twisted and after two weeks, no random coil is detected anymore.

The latter folding is very likely a consequence of the high local peptide concentration on the surface of nanoparticle that facilitates a -sheet fi brillation of peptide. Moreover, several factors such as pH, peptide concentration, and size of the nanoparticle have a strong infl uence on the nanoparticle-mediated folding. These results provide valuable information on pharmaceutical applications of nanoparticles and will help to reduce possible adverse effects.",

Those molecules are endowed with a broad spectrum of activity against pathogens. They can be divided into two classes differing in the mechanism of killing: membrane disruptive antibiotics cause a dysfunction of the membrane and subsequent cell lysis; non-membrane disruptive peptides are focused on the intracellular targets. In both situations the initial stage consists in the interactions with the cytoplasmic membrane, in most cases without the exploitation of any receptors. A non-receptor type of interactions decreases the possibility of development of microbial resistance and makes peptides a very potent alternative to conventional antibiotics. In the face of the reduced effi ciency of traditional drugs there is an urgent need for the design of new therapeutic agents with the optimized activity. Monte Carlo simulations of peptide-membrane interactions can be one of the strategies. That method takes in the account biophysical properties of a membrane as well as structural and physicochemical nature of peptides. In our work we are focused on the development of new analogues of NKCS, a derivative of potent antibiotic peptide NK-2. In the present study the outcome of Monte Carlo simulations is compared to experimental results of antibacterial tests performed against Escherichia coli. The insight into the molecular mechanism of peptides activity is obtained in vitro using SAXS method and artifi cial systems mimicking a bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. The results indicate that Monte Carlo modelling is a good tool to predict the peptide -membrane interactions and can be very useful for the design of novel antibiotics.",

Conformational and biological analyses were carried out on several different A fragments, to understand the role of the single residues in the fi brillation process. A 25-35, is considered the shortest fragment exhibiting large -sheet aggregates and retaining the toxicity of the full-length peptide. We recently reported the conformational analysis of the synthetic A 25-35 under several solution conditions, and analyzed the modulation of the conformational behaviour of A 25-35 peptide, by interaction with nicotine-like molecules. A 16-35 is the 20-mer A peptide, composed of the A 25-35 fragment, and additional N-terminal residues, known to be endowed with fi bril disaggregating activity. A 16-35 encompasses part of hydrophobic (1-28) and hydrophilic (29-35) A -regions. Due to the amphipathic character of this fragment, common to the full A 1-42 and A 1-40, a tossicological mechanism involving A -peptide-membrane interaction may be hypothesized. On these bases we decided to perform the structural investigation of the fragment A 16-35 in membrane mimicking systems including micelle and vesicles aggregates, differing for composition and structural complexity. High resolution three dimensional structure was solved by NMR spectroscopy in negatively charged SDS and in DPC/ SDS mixed micelles. Fluorescence and EPR spectroscopies were used to monitor the peptide lipid interaction.

The model peptide LAH 4 whose charge can be easily controlled by pH of the medium (1) is a very convenient tool to study the relationship between physical properties of peptide molecules and their membrane activity. It was shown that the changes in the charge of LAH 4 molecules result in changes in their orientation with respect to phospholipid bilayers (1). In the present study, effects of LAH 4 on the properties of phospholipid bilayers at different pH values are studied by several methods. Its infl uence on the lateral mobility of lipids within an SPB and on the stability of suspensions of large unilamellar vesicles were characterized by fl uorescence correlation spectroscopy, showing evidence of peptide induced aggregation of lipids at basic pH. Changes of hydration and local viscosity within the bilayer following changes in orientation of peptide molecules were measured by solvent relaxation technique. The effect of phospholipid charge was also taken into account in each case. Several bioactive peptides, such as antimicrobial, cell-penetrating or fusogenic peptides, exert their biological function by interacting with cellular membranes. Therefore, structural data on the location of these molecules inside lipid bilayers are very important for a detailed understanding of their mechanism of action. Fluorescence spectroscopic methods are particularly suited to the study of peptide-membrane association, but give only low-resolution information on peptide position in the lipid bilayer. Molecular dynamics simulations, on the other hand, can provide a very detailed picture of the peptide-membrane interaction, but need to be validated by quantitative comparison with experimental data. We applied several fl uorescence approaches, together with MD simulations, to the investigation of two antimicrobial peptides: the lipopeptaibol trichogin GA IV, and PMAP-23, a member of the cathelicidin family. To perform the spectroscopic studies, a variety of peptide analogues containing a single fl uorophore were synthesized. Fluorescence spectra, depth-dependent quenching experiments, and peptide-translocation assays were employed to determine the location of the two peptides inside lipid bilayers, in particular as a function of peptide/lipid ratio. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed by a \"minimum bias\" approach, starting from a random mixture of water, lipid and peptide, and following the spontaneous self-assembling of the lipid bilayer. The fi nal membrane-bound 3D-structure is in quantitative agreement with the position of the fl uorescent labels determined by depth-dependent quenching experiments. For both peptides investigated, the atomic details of MD simulations provide new insights on the mechanism of membrane destabilization.

Over the past 12 years, the amide linkage has become the quintessential motif to elaborate folding oligomers. Aliphatic and aromatic oligoamides (peptoids, -, -peptides) have provided numerous helical-folded structures, many of which have shown interesting biological activities (1). Interestingly, substituting urea for the CH 2 -CO-NH units in the 4 -peptide backbone represent a spectacular case of isosteric and iso-structural replacement. Detailed NMR studies of the resulting oligoureas revealed a helical fold very similar to that reported for the cognate 4 -peptides. Defi nitive confi rmation of this isostructural relationship came with the recent X-ray structure determination of the canonical 2.5-helix of oligoureas. How such isosteric and isostructural oligoamide and oligourea backbones compare in biomolecular recognition events is an interesting question that we attempted to address in the present work. Notably the two systems were compared for their antimicrobial activity, membrane interaction and disruption properties. Both -peptides and oligoureas designed to mimic globally amphiphilic alpha-helical host-defense peptides have been synthesized and tested. The results showed a surprising dichotomy in bactericidal activity between the two isostructural systems and enlightened the unique antibacterial of amphiphilic oligourea helices.

The discovery of a class of peptides, known as cell-penetrating-peptides (CPPs), with the ability to mediate translocation of various cargoes both in vitro and in vivo has provided new perspectives in the fi eld of delivery. We have designed a new secondary amphipathic CPP, Caddy, which can transfect siRNA. Many studies have tried to elucidate CPP internalization mechanisms and there is currently still much controversy between endocytosis phenomena and direct interaction with membranes. However, elucidating the interactions between peptides and lipid membranes is essential to understand how Caddy delivers cargoes in cells. To highlight these interactions, we have applied biophysical method to phospholipids monolayer and bilayer as model plasmic membranes. Regarding the increase of the phospholipids monolayer surface pressure in presence of Caddy, it is obvious that this peptide have high affi nity with lipids. While cholesterol presence does not induce anything in peptide insertion on a phospholipids monolayer, the cargo and a widely studied partner of the internalization: Heparan Sulfate of the GAG' s family, do not induce the same behaviour. The intrinsic probe of Caddy, tryptophan residues, and the FITC probe bound to the cargo allowed to follow and identify interactions between these two entities by fl uorescence spectroscopy. Adding a bilayer vesicular solution unsettle these interactions, tryptophan residues interact with phospholipids while FITC probe are less embarrassed by peptides. Caddy alone in solution is not structured but CD measurements show a typical spectrum of helical conformation in presence of phospholipids vesicles.

The activity and selectivity of these peptides could be attributed to a strong preference towards anionic membrane model systems, which mimetize bacterial membranes. Regarding the interactions with bacterial membrane models, there were marked differences in the interaction patterns, as well as in functional properties of the peptides at high peptide:lipid ratios. These differences occurred for both peptides, despite their being unrelated in sequence and in occurrence in nature. Such events at high membrane coverage could represent the equivalent at the molecular scale of the conditions at which the antimicrobial activity of the peptides is triggered. Although the lipid: peptide ratios at these transitions are lower than 10 phospholipids per peptide molecule, the plausibility of this hypothesis was demonstrated taking into account an estimate of the amount of lipid per bacterium, and the bacterial concentration in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. According to the partition constants obtained towards bacterial membrane models, these peptides are expected to reach, at the MIC, precisely those high concentrations in the membrane. In addition, surface charge neutralization was shown to occur in these conditions. Activity at high membrane coverage is thus likely not only for these peptides but also for any peptide displaying high membrane affi nity and micromolar MICs, which is common amongst AMPs. Biosensors based on artifi cial membrane system that permits the functional reconstitution of transmembrane receptors have been studied for the past decade. Immobilized liposome encapsulates intracellular chemicals in the internal water cavity and provides a potential advantage over supported planar lipid membrane. To prepare a stable liposome adlayer, we have proposed an immobilizing method based on small-peptide modifi cation of solid surface. In the present study, we investigated kinetics of liposome adsorption on the surface-bound synthetic peptides which have several alanine, lysine and tryptophan residues as amphiphilic segment with a cysteine at terminus. The quartz crystal microbalance studies showed that the peptide sequences can be divided into two groups according to liposome-size dependence of Langmuir adsorption constant. While the initial adsorption processes could be satisfactorily described by simple Langmuir adsorption kinetics, the amounts of liposome adsorbed irreversibly were increased as time advances. The results from AFM reveal that most of the liposomes are bound to peptidic surfaces as single fl attened particles without fusion together for several hours. We next performed the detection of ganglioside GM1-lectin interaction on the liposome surface. All the binding constants and binding amounts, as observed by QCM, were fairly consistent with each other and and showed the effectiveness of our approach.",

These molecules have been considered as targeting structures for the delivery of bioactive compounds into various cell types. Although the mechanism of uptake is still unclear, it is reasonable to assume that the relative contribute of each proposed mechanism could differ for the same peptide, depending on experimental protocol and cargo molecule composition. In this work we try to connect the capability to interact with model lipid membrane of CPP and their structural and chemical characteristics in order to obtain a biophysical classifi cation that predicts the behavior of CPP-cargo molecule in cell system. Indeed, the interaction with cell membrane is one of the primary step in the interaction of CPP with cells, and consequently the studies on model membrane could become important for understanding peptide-membrane interaction on a molecular level, explaining how CPPs may translocate a membrane without destroying it and how this interactions come into play in shuttling CPPs via different routes with different effi ciency. We analyzed by fl uorescence spectroscopy the binding properties of six different CPPs (KFGF, Antp and Tat derived peptides, and oligoarginine peptides containing 6, 8 or 10 residues) in absence or presence of the same cargo peptide (the [392-401]pTyr 396 fragment of HS1 protein). The binding properties were correlated to the conformational and chemical characteristic of peptides, as well as to the cell penetrating properties of the CPP-cargo conjugate. Results show that even if certain physico-chemical properties (conformation, positive charge) govern CPP capability to interact with the model membrane, these cannot fully explain cell-permeability properties. Great deals of data show that Alzheimer's pathology lead to the loss of neuronal functionality and synaptic plasticity. These effects seem to be the consequence of a toxic effect of A peptides related to their ability to modify cell membrane homeostasis. In particular, A peptides, as full length or in fragments, being in oligomeric or polymeric form, could alter membrane fl uidity and compromise its functionality. We have previously demonstrated that the 25-35 fragment of A peptide A (25-35) is able to penetrate into the outer leafl ets of the membrane. Furthermore, it is able to alter membrane fl uidity changing membrane response to cholesterol, and thus affecting its ability to form low fl uid membrane regions named lipid rafts. A (25-35) is considered the shortest fragment exhibiting large -sheet aggregates and retaining the toxicity of the full-length peptide.

NMR structures of P59 and lipo-P59 in mixed SDS/DPC micelles are reported; the positioning of P59 and lipo-P59 peptides with respect the lipidic surface is analyzed using 5-doxyl stearic and 16-doxyl stearic acid. EPR analysis is carried out in the zwitterionic dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine and the anionic dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol vesicles using several different lipid spin labels. Both peptides bind to lipid bilayers and Trp residues and lipidic chain of lipo-P59 show a important role in the process of peptide adsorption onto the membrane, to exert its antiviral activity. Studies on human cell membranes were necessary to further establish the role of membranes in these peptides mode of action. This interaction was assessed by evaluating the effects that these peptides have on the membrane dipole potential of human erythrocytes, using the fl uorescence probe Di-8-ANEPPS. In the presence of enfuvirtide or T-1249, a decrease in the di-8-ANEPPS fl uorescence excitation ratio dependent of peptide concentration was observed. These results show that T-1249 has ten times more affi nity to the erythrocyte membrane than enfuvirtide, a factor that can be associated with the adsorption of T-1249 on cholesterol rich membranes observed on the studies with membrane model systems. Moreover, as a fraction of HIV associates with erythrocytes in vivo, these cells can have a role in delivering these peptides to the viral surface. The improved clinical effi ciency of T-1249 relative to enfuvirtide may be related to its higher partition coeffi cient and ability to adsorb to rigid lipid areas on the cell surface, where most receptors are located upon membrane fusion. Moreover, adsorption to the sterol-rich viral membrane helps to increase the local concentration of the inhibitor peptide at the fusion site. The platelet receptor IIb 3 plays a critical role in the process of platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Upon platelet activation its conformation changes leading to an increased affi nity for fi brinogen, which forms bridges between adjacent platelets and assembles them into an aggregate. The IIb 3 activation is regulated by \"outside-in\" and \"inside-out\" signaling. Among the protein-protein interactions, which contribute to \u00abinside-out\u00bb signaling, that of talin with the 3 cytoplasmic tail is the most important. It has been recently suggested that talinmediated IIb 3 activation relies on the cooperative interaction of the membrane proximal (MP) and the membrane distal (MD) 3 regions with talin F3 domain and that the N 744 PLY 747 motif of 3 , which can be phosphorylated at Y 747 , plays a critical role in this process. To evaluate the interaction of talin with the 3 tail of integrin we designed and synthesized two peptides corresponding to the MD and MP parts of 3 in their carboxyfl uorescein-labeled form (MD: CF-R 736 AKWDTANNPLYKE 749 and MP: CF-K 716 LLITIHDRKE 726 ). Emission and anisotropy fl uorescence spectroscopy was used to quantitatively assess the affi nities of these peptides for talin. Furthermore, to challenge the role of the Y 747 phosphorylation in talin-IIb 3 interaction we also studied the binding of talin to the modifi ed analogue of MD, CF-R 736 AKWDTANNPL(pTyr) KE 749 . Our experiments revealed that the MD and MP parts of 3 bind tightly to talin and that Y 747 phosphorylation has an inhibitory effect on this binding. Finally, Circular Dichroism studies of all peptides in aqueous solutions and mixtures with TFE were also performed in order to characterize structure-affi nity relationships.

The infection of human cells with HIV requires two initial steps: binding of the viral glycoprotein GP120 to the receptor CD4 followed by the interaction between the V3 loop of GP120 and a seven helix transmembrane coreceptor (CCR5 on macrophages or CXCR4 on T cells). The N-type glycosylation at Asn301 of the V3 loop is assumed to play a crucial role in this process. In order to understand the interaction in detail, it is important to analyze the binding of V3-glycopeptides to the membrane integrated coreceptors on an atomic scale. Here, we present binding studies between multiple V3-peptides and -glycopeptides and the coreceptor CCR5 by STDD NMR and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). SPR experiments were carried out by immobilizing the (glyco)peptides on an SPR chip by amide coupling. Several concentrations of CCR5 overexpressing human osteosarcoma (HOS-R5) cells were passed over the sensor surface. The role of individual amino acids in the binding process to CCR5 can be analyzed by using different V3-peptides and -glycopeptides. Additionally, the observation of interactions between the glycopeptide ligands and the receptor proteins embedded in liposomes is possible by using the Saturation Transfer Double Difference (STDD) NMR technology. STDD NMR allows removal of all unwanted signals resulting from native binding processes in cells. (1) . We used CCR5 liposomes derived from HOS-R5 cells. Substraction of an STD spectrum of CCR5 liposomes from an STD spectrum of the same concentration of liposomes incubated with a ligand allows recording of clean STDD NMR spectra presenting only signals of protons of the ligand interacting with the transmembrane receptor.(2) K D values of the ligand with respect to CCR5 have been determined in series of experiments with varying ligand concentrations. We could show that the binding epitope between HIV and CCR5 is formed by the carbohydrate at Asn301 as well as the peptide. This knowledge is important for the design of new inhibitors.",

This kind of compounds, named metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), are new class of nanoporous materials and are very promising ones for applications in catalysis, pharmaceutical industry, etc. The stability and molecular structure of these complexes in some solvents is in the process of investigation. Peptide metalloconstructs often possess particular conformations and hence display increased activities and metabolic stabilities. We investigated new RGD peptide analogs cyclized through oxorhenium / oxotechnetium coordination. The RGD sequence is known to bind specifi cally to 10 of the 25 known integrins, a family of integral proteins that plays an important role in tumor neoangiogenesis, development and proliferation. Several cyclic RGD pentapeptides bearing an exocyclic Tc-99m oxotechnetium core have been proposed for molecular imaging, however few of them have displayed attractive selectivities and metabolic stabilities. Structure, biological activity and metabolic stabilities of metallated peptides cannot be predicted. Therefore, we preferred a combinatorial approach to generate a panel of tracers that may be evaluated by tumor imaging in mice. Tracers were constructed from a RGD model of general formula : NS2-X1-X2-X3-RS where X1,2,3 are respectively arginine, glycine and aspartic acid analogs and R is a series of linkers that feature various lengths and geometries (NS2 is a N-bis(ethylthio) moiety). First attempts for synthesizing these peptides by the versatile Ugi multicomponent reaction did not yield the peptides with suffi cient purities. A representative library of 64 peptides was obtained by standard parallel peptide synthesis and purifi cation of all members. Peptides were metallated either with rhenium or technetium using standard procedures. Their resistance towards mice serum, glutathione and tumor extracts was evaluated and showed that compounds containing an aminoethanethiol linker displayed higher stabilities.

As the complexity of synthetic peptides increases so the demands on the synthesis and purifi cation increase. Whilst improvements in synthesis resins and techniques enables higher purity peptides to be produced, 100% purity is not achieved. For many applications post-synthesis purifi cation is still required. Methods for the purifi cation at the mg level can be relatively straightforward but where there is a need to develop methods which may be used for larger scale production there are a number of additionly considerations. The method developed must be scaleable and the economics of the process must be compatible with the fi nal product costs. When looking to develop a purifi cation method the loading will be critical to the throughput and fi nal production costs. The selection of the purifi cation media and the purifi cation conditions are two of the major infl uences on loading as these determine capacity and resolution. However, it is also important to consider the the physical properties of the pepitide -especially its solubility. As part of the purifi cation method development a loading study must be performed -increasing the amount of peptide loaded onto the column. The most common way of doing this is to increase the concentration of the sample and keep the injection volume constant, concentration overload. But this does require that the peptide is readily soluble in a solvent compatible with the HPLC purifi cation conditions. Alternatively volume overload can be used where the concentration of the peptide solution is kept constant and the volume purifi ed increases. The most commonly used method is concentration overload. The work presented in this poster compares the two overload strategies, concentration overload and volume overload, for the purifi cation of synthetic peptides. The suitability of the two strategies for large scale manufacture will be explored.",

Increasing the selectivity of the anti-cancer agent will not only facilitate lower dosage for equal therapeutic effect, but also decrease the frequency of drug resistance. We have studied two different targeting approaches both based on cellpenetrating peptides. The fi rst approach is a chimera between cancer homing peptides and a CPP the other is a enzyme activated prodrug design. The cyclic peptide cCPGPEGAGC (PEGA) is a homing peptide that has previously been shown to accumulate in breast tumor tissue in mice. PEGA peptide does not cross the plasma membrane per se; however, when attached to the cell-penetrating peptide pVEC, the conjugate is taken up by different breast cancer cells in vitro. Additionally, the homing capacity of the PEGA-pVEC is conserved in vivo, where the conjugate mainly accumulates in blood vessels in breast tumor tissue and, consequently is taken up. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are over-expressed in a variety of tumor tissues and cell lines, and their expression is highly correlated to tumor invasion and metastasis. To exploit these characteristics, we designed a tumor cell-selective prodrug, by constructing modifi ed version of the already shown to be functional MTX-YTA4 conjugate. It is an inactive pro form of a cell-penetrating peptide (NOPE) conjugated to the cytostatic agent metothrexate (MTX), selectively cleavable and thereby activated by MMPs.",

Ion exchange chromatography (IEC) is a widely used for analysis and purifi cation of biomolecules. We have newly developed polymer-based IEC column, named YMC-BioPro series, specially designed for separation of proteins, peptides and nucleic acids. The completely spherical and monodispersed porous / nonporous beads (5 m), optimally packed with advanced technology, provide high theoretical plate number and symmetric peak shape. Excellent resolution is achieved from the high column effi ciency coupled with the excellent selectivity of QA and SP chemistries. In this paper, we will show features and benefi ts of YMC-BioPro series.",

            "text": "James P. Tam, School of Biological Science, Nanyang Technological University, 60 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 637551. Viral entry requires fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. In all Class-1 envelope viruses including HIV-1, fusion is mediated by envelope glycoprotein which has a homotrimeric quaternary structure which forms a hairpin-like assembly of six-helix bundle (6HB) during the fusion event. The 6HB employs a 3-on-3 locking mechanism in which 3 HRC (heptad repeating-carboxyl region) chains crosslink 3 HRN (heptad repeating-aminal region) chains to enable membrane fusion. This locking mechanism confers avidity due to multi-chain interactions and a high genetic barrier to mutations in the viral entry strategy despite the high mutation rate of their envelope protein. This mechanism also provides inspiration to our approach in designing mutation-resistant entry inhibitors of HIV-1. T20/enfuvirtide, a synthetic HRC-peptide monomer designed to interrupt membrane fusion, is the fi rst and only FDA-approved entry inhibitor against HIV-1. However, T20 becomes ineffective in 20% of AIDS patients due to acquired resistance to T-20 resistant during the treatment course. Our inhibitor design is based on a novel quaternary protein mimetic approach. Key elements include a covalent-link 3parallel-chain construct mimicking the quaternary structure of gp41 in its pre-fusion state and an inhibition mechanism mimicking the multimeric interactions found in the highly conserved 6HB formation. Our hypothesis is that covalent-linked, 3-chain quaternary mimetics (called 3 mimetics) of HRC peptides can confer multi-chain binding to the HRN region in a multi-chain locking mechanism that may lead to mutation-resistant HIV fusion inhibitors. We also extend our design to 2-chain HRC mimetics (called 2 mimetics) which may bind to the HRN as a 2-on-3 locking mechanism. In contrast, T20 and other single-chain peptide inhibitors with a 1-on-3 binding mechanism lacks the advantages offered by the quaternary mimetics and is susceptible to gp41 mutations. This report will describe all three types of inhibitors as a model to further our understanding of gp41 mutations and viral fusion mechanism in developing mutation-resistant entry inhibitors.",

In contrast, the SH2 domains of SHP-1 in addition to pY+1 and pY+3 depend on position pY-2 (3). It was further demonstrated that beyond this minimal consensus sequence the positions pY+4 and pY+5 also signifi cantly affect the binding affi nity and specifi city of the SHP-1 SH2 domains (4). For the investigation of SHP-1 mediated signaling pathways, inhibitors of this phosphatase are of great interest. Therefore, we focused our research on linear and cyclic peptide ligands based on the previous studies [3-5]. The new ligands were C-terminally prolongated according to the recognition determinants for pY+4 and pY+5. Except, an additional motif designed to occupy a basic gap on the surface of the PTP-domain was introduced. The latter was predicted to impair the N-SH2-PTP dissociation process",

By Edman degradation and ESI-QTOF mass spectrometry, the primary sequence of melectin was established as H-Gly-Phe-Leu-Ser-Ile-Leu-Lys-Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Lys-Val-Met-Ala-His-Met-Lys-NH2. In the same way three structurally related peptides were identifi ed in the venom of parasitic bee Lasioglossum laticeps and were named lasioglossin I, II, and III. Their sequences are: H-Val-Asn-Trp-Lys-Lys-Val-Leu-Gly-Lys-Ile-Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Lys-NH2, H-Val-Asn-Trp-Lys-Lys-Ile-Leu-Gly-Lys-Ile-Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Lys-NH2 and H-Val-Asn-Trp-Lys-Lys-Ile-Leu-Gly-Lys-Ile-Ile-Lys-Val-Val-Lys-NH2 respectively. Synthetic melectin and lasioglossins exhibit potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and low hemolytic activity against rat erythrocytes. Unlike the lasioglossins melectin degranulates the rat peritoneal mast cells. Lasioglossin III has a strong potency to kill different cancer cells. The CD spectra of melectin and lasioglossins measured in the presence of trifl uoroethanol and sodium dodecyl sulfate showed a high content of -helical conformation which indicates that these peptides can adopt an amphipathic -helical secondary structure in the anisotropic environment such as bacterial cell membrane.

Moreover, it is known that inhibitors of the uterotonic activity have been traditionally produced by introduction of -carbon substituents into position 1 and/or by substitution of L-tyrosine at position 2 of OT and AVP with aromatic D-amino acid. In this study, we present the results of the conformational analysis of four vasopressin (AVP) analogues modifi ed at position 2 with 3,3-diphenylalanine (Dpa) isomers, [Mpa 1 ,Dpa 2 ,Val 4 ,D-Arg 8 ]VP (I), [Mpa 1 ,D-Dpa 2 ,Val 4 ,D-Arg 8 ]VP (II), [D-Dpa 2 ,D-Arg 8 ]VP (III) and [Mpa 1 ,D-Dpa 2 ]AVP (IV). All the peptides are very potent antidiuretic agonists with signifi cantly prolonged action. Moreover, the analogues II, III and IV have high antioxytocic potency.

The programme of investigation of the biological properties of the octapeptide included the investigation of its properties using standard sets of reagents for immunoferment determination of concentration of the general class E immunoglobulin in the blood serum produced by closed jointstock company \"Vector-best\", Russia, catalogue number A-8660. The investigations showed that introducing only the WRNWDYYK-peptide labelled by horse-radish peroxidase in the holes of the plotting board containing the test system A-8660 with primary monoclonal antibodies against IgE leads to a dose-dependent increase of the optical density of the solution. The concentration of horse-radish peroxidase in the conjugate of the WRNWDYYK-peptide introduced in the holes was 0.01 mg/ml. 20.0 to 180.0 l of the conjugate was added to the holes. The minimum optical density of the solution at the working wavelength of 450 nm and background wavelength of 620 nm was found after adding 20.0 l of the conjugate and was equal to 0.33\u00b10.057 units of optical density, while the maximum, achieved after adding 160.0 l of the conjugate, was 1.694\u00b10.092 units of optical density. A strong correlation was found between the amount of added WRNWDYYK-peptide, conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase, and the optical density of the solution after adding the substrate chromogenic mixture (r=0.884). The experiments demonstrated a high binding activity of the synthetic WRNWDYYKpeptide with primary monoclonal antibodies against IgE, which allows us to conclude that antibodies against a certain epitope of IgE are able to bind to Fc R1A and can contribute to the development and course of a number of allergic illnesses.",

Cdc42 and Rac transmit signals through binding to effector proteins in a GTP-dependent manner. Wasp, an effector protein, is postulated to link activation of Cdc42 directly to the rearrangement of actin. Furthermore, several studies have shown the involvement of Rho GTPases secretion of Weibel-Palade bodies, which are storage organelles in endothelial cells, via reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The aim of this work was to defi ne the minimal conserved region of Cdc42 that induces the rearrangement of actin and its possible involvement in secretion of Wiebel-Palade bodies. Three peptides derived from the binding domain of Cdc42 (Cdc42(158-172), Cdc42(173-187) and Cdc42(181-187)) to Wasp were synthesized in their free state and conjugated to a recently developed Cell Penetrating Sequential Carrier (CF-Ahx-[Lys-Aib-Cys(X)] 4 -NH 2 , CF-Ahx-CPSC), where X represents one of the Cdc42 peptides. Direct labeling with carboxyfl uorescein allowed the assessment of the internalisation of the conjugates. Preliminary results suggest that the CF-Ahx-[Lys-Aib-Cys(Cdc42(181-187))] 4 -NH 2 conjugate strongly affects the rearrangement of actin.

These short peptides can be selected for their ability to recognize and inhibit a functional domain of a given target protein. Survivin, a member of the family of the inhibitors of apoptosis, is an interesting target molecule in this respect. It is highly expressed in most human tumor cells, whereas its expression is hardly detectable in most differentiated normal tissues. Survivin has an anti-apoptotic and a cell-cycle promoting function. Inhibition of Survivin by interacting peptides could possibly induce apoptosis and interfere with cell-cycle progression in cancer cells. To show that Survivin expression is required to maintain growth and survival of breast cancer cells, we downregulated the expression of Survivin mRNA with a lentiviral vector encoding a Survivin specifi c shRNA.

IN is an emerging target for the design of novel drugs against AIDS, and the fi rst IN-inhibitor, Raltegavir, was approved by the FDA in October 2007. Our research in the past few years focuses on the development of peptide inhibitors of IN. We designed inhibitors using two approaches: (1) Rational design based on protein-protein interactions of IN: Peptidic sequences derived from IN-binding sites of IN-binding proteins are already optimized by nature to bind IN and have the potential to inhibit it. Using this approach we developed several IN inhibitors: two peptides derived from the IN-binding loops of the cellular binding partner of IN, LEDGF/p75 (LEDGF 361-370 and LEDGF 401-412), and two peptides derived from the HIV-1 Rev protein, which we found to bind IN; (2) A peptide selected using combinatorial library screening using the yeast-2-hybrid system, revealed a 20-mer peptide, termed by us IN(1) All fi ve peptides bound IN with low micromolar affi nity and inhibited the DNA-binding of IN as well as its enzymatic activity in vitro. These peptides penetrated cells and consequently blocked HIV-1 replication in infected cultured cells due to the lack of integration. The most potent peptides in vitro and in cells were LEDGF 361-370 and Rev 13-23. These two peptides signifi cantly inhibited HIV-1 infection in mice model. We conclude that the fi ve peptides, particularly LEDGF 361-370 and Rev 13-23, are promising anti-HIV lead compounds. References: 1.

Biological activity was evaluated in vitro and anti-tumor effi cacy was investigated in vivo as a single agent and in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11). The fusion protein RGD-L-TRAIL, but not TRAIL or RGE-L-TRAIL, specifi cally bound to microvascular endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner and showed enhanced apoptosis-inducing activity (caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation) in \u00a6\u00c1V\u00a6 3 and \u00a6\u00c1V\u00a6 5 integrin positive cancer cells. In addition, RGD-L-TRAIL was more effective in suppressing tumor growth of COLO-205 tumor-bearing mice than an equivalent dose of TRAIL. The antitumor effect of RGD-L-TRAIL was further enhanced by combination with CPT-11 in both TRAIL-sensitive COLO-205 and TRAIL-resistive HT-29 tumor xenograft models. Our fi ndings suggest the novel fusion protein RGD-L-TRAIL can directly target tumor endothelial cells as well as \u00a6\u00c1V\u00a6 3 and \u00a6\u00c1V\u00a6 5 integrin positive tumor cells.

J. Physiol. Pharm.,80,[287][288][289][290][291][292] 2002). In an effort to further improve stability and pharmacokinetic properties of R-954 while retaining its high antagonistic potency, the latter peptide was extended by a lipid moiety at its N-terminal region. N-acylating lipidic moieties comprising either, a -amino fatty acids (C-6, C-8, and C-11) or cholic acid were coupled on the resin during the solid phase synthesis of the antagonist sequence. Antagonist potencies (IC50) of derived analogues were determined by classical in vitro rabbit B1R bioassay using the isolated rabbit aorta and compared to the parent peptide R-954. The results showed that the analogue N-190 with 6-amino caproyl acyl component was slightly more potent (IC50: 10.5\u00b10.8 nM) than R-954 (IC50: 14.8\u00b10.8 nM) while its counterpart comprising no -amino group, the peptide R-958, was signifi cantly less active (IC50: 35.5\u00b10.9 nM). All synthetic analogues were FITC-labelled at their N-terminal to probe surface B1R expression by fl uorescent techniques. On human B1R-transfected HEK-293 cells, both FR-954 and FN-190 showed a cell membrane staining by confocal microscopy; however, an intracellular labelling was also noticed with the FN-190. A positive fl uorescent signal with FN-190 as opposed to FR-954 was observed in untransfected HEK-293 cells using fl uorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) technique. Similar results were obtained with -amino fatty acyl and cholyl derivatives. These results can be explained by an increased membrane permeability of the lipopeptides that is unrelated to the presence of B1R. We developed more potent R-954 analogue by extending N-terminally peptide with 6-amino caproyl acyl. The lipidic moieties used; can be use as permeability vehicles to other peptides.",

The mode of action of cytolytic peptides is independent of the rate of cellular proliferation and such peptides are less prone towards drug resistance, since they target the lipid bilayer of the cell. One of the most studied cytolytic peptides is melittin. Melittin, a 26 amino acid amphipathic peptide, is the main toxic component in the venom of the honeybee Apis milefera. The ability of melittin to induce the lysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells has been well documented.

RRC Roentgenradiology, RUSSIAN FEDERATION The purpose of the work was investigate cytostatic and cytotoxic properties of the cell-penetrating chimaeric peptide are constructed from parts of two molecules: fragment of cyclin-kinase inhibitor p16INK4a and cell-penetrating sequences Antp. The action of peptide has been investigated on cell lines 293, A549, MCF-7 and HCT-116; on the shotterm cultures of human tumor cell received from surgical material. The concentration of peptides varied from 10 to 40 mkM in experiments with cell in vitro. The level of apoptosis and changes of a cell cycle was investigated by method of fl ow cytometry. In vivo experiments (nude mice) with tumor received by subcutaneous inoculation of 10 6 cells A549 or HCT-116 have been executed. Administration of the peptide starts when the tumors became palpable in quantity of 0,1 mg and 0,2 mg hypodermically into area of tumor. We observed that peptide pAntp_ p16INK4a in concentration of 40 mkM delay of transition G1-S phases of cells-cycle in cells for all investigated cell lines in vitro.The specifi city of effects was proved by investigation pRB phosphorilation and expression Cycline D and A on mRNA level. The concentration peptide 10 mkM and higher induce concentration-dependent apoptosis. The MCF-7 cell line was less sensitive to proapoptotic action of peptide. The shot-term cell cultures of renal cancer were more sensitive then the breast, bladder, gaster cancer and normal skin cells. The experiments with nude mice has been shown, that the injection of pAntp_p16INK4a in tumor node leads to decrease of tumor growth and death rate of animals. Thus, it has been shown, that investigated peptide has anticancer properties in vitro and in vivo and is a promising antitumor agent.",

However, the methods for introducing to the peptide side chains and deprotection (reduction) method have not yet been developed.

This peptide, which has 54 residues and a C-terminal amide, inhibits tumor metastasis. Two other biologically active peptides derived from the KiSS-1 gene, KiSS-14 and KiSS-13, have been isolated from human placenta. KiSS-10, a synthetic decapeptide amide from the C-terminus of KiSS-54, has a 10-fold greater affi nity for GPR54 than KiSS-54, identifying KiSS-10 as the pharmacophore for receptor binding. All these peptides are collectively named kisspeptins. In addition to described roles in cancer metastasis and placentation, the kisspeptin/GPR54 pair has received growing attention following the discovery that it acts as a molecular switch for puberty. The aim of this work was to study the Ca 2+ -mobilizing activity of Ala-substituted KiSS-10 analogs in GPR54-transfected cells. Administration of KiSS-10 induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca 2+ ]i with an EC 50 of 15 nM. Sequential Ala-substitution of the native residues 1-5 and 7, led to analogs which exhibited similar potency to KiSS-10. Conversely, [Ala 6 ], [Ala 8 ] and [Ala 9 ]KiSS-10 were 450, 6 and 11 folds less potent than KiSS-10, respectively. Whatever the Bioactive peptides dose, [Ala 10 ]KiSS-10 did not modify the basal [Ca 2+ ]i. On the other hand, [Ala 6 ]KiSS-10 (but not [Ala 10 ]KiSS-10) dose-dependently inhibited the KiSS-10-evoked [Ca 2+ ]i increase.Altogether, these data show that (1) the biological activity of KiSS-10 is located in the C-terminus, (2) the native Phe 6 residue is involved in GPR54 activation and the Phe 10 residue in affi nity, and (3) the introduction of an aliphatic residue in position 6 may lead to potent antagonists. This SAR study constitutes the fi rst step towards the development of ligands that will be used for the rational design of drug candidate useful for the treatment of reproductive disorders.

In this contribution we will present a new strategy for selectively incorporating several Osulfated tyrosine residues in peptides by Fmoc solid phase synthesis. We have applied this strategy to synthesize several peptide fragments representing the N-terminal portion of C5a Receptor (C5aR). The N-terminus of the C5aR contains two O-sulfated tyrosine residues at positions 11 and 14. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements and cell based calcium mobilization experiments we have demonstrated the importance of the O-sulfated tyrosine residues of the C5aR mimic upon binding of a natural inhibitor, the Chemotaxis Inhibitory Protein of Staphylococcus aureus (CHIPS)(1). Furthermore, we have shown that the sulfated C5aR7-28 peptide can be used as a close model of the C5aR for studying the inhibition by CHIPS. We have elucidated the structures of free CHIPS",

They either prevent the formation of the dimeric and enzymatically active PR within the precursor polyprotein, or disrupt already formed PR into inactive monomers. Good DIs are lipopeptides, e.g. palmitoyl-YEL, Ki ~5 nM (Schramm HJ (99) Biol. Chem. 380, 593. Dumond J (02) Biochem. Pharm. 65, 1097). Dform amino acids can replace some of the amino acids. Triterpenes also show activity (Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 L BBRC (96) 227, 484). By computer modelling, new modifi ed peptides and triterpenes have been identifi ed as possible DIs. The triterpene inhibitors have 2 carboxyl groups 10.4 A apart (at C4 and C28: medicagenic acid, quillaja acid, presenegine, gypsogenine, hederageneine). Modifi cation of the 3-OH group is possible, e.g. attachment of amino acids through dicarboxylic acid linkers. The C28 carboxyl group should be free. The triterpene scaffold binds to a hydrophobic cleft formed by the re-arranged PR terminal segments; there are three attachment points: 3-OH (+ 2-OH) to R8, 4-COO-to R87 (+ T26), 28-COO-to P1, H69. The \"maturation inhibitor\" PA-457 of Panacos (betulinic acid modifi ed at 3-OH) should also act as a DI! FDA approved PIs (darunavir, tipranavir) have recently been reported (Koh Y (07) JBC 282, 28709) to show DI activity in addition to competitive inhibition. This explains their activity against therapy mutants. It has already been shown that DIs act in synergy with active site inhibitors and may be valuable constituents of anti-AIDS cocktails.",

However, the putative involvement of HOXB4 in lymphopoiesis and particularly in the expansion of early lymphoid progenitor cells remained elusive. Based on the ability of the HOXB4protein to enter cells by way of a passive transmembrane transfer process (Derossi et al, J Biol Chem 269:10444; 1994), we previously designed a long-term co-culture procedure of human CD34+ immature hematopoietic cells with stromal MS-5 cells engineered to actively secrete the HOXB4 protein. This procedure allowed ex vivo expansion of primitive human hematopoietic cells (Amsellem et al, Nat Med 9:1423; 2003). More recently, we used the same method to investigate whether HOXB4 could support expansion of cells originating from CD34+ cells and committed at various levels toward the lymphoid lineages. We provided evidence that HOXB4 protein delivery does promote the expansion of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) that generate lymphoid progenitors. HOXB4 acts on lympho-myeloid HPCs and committed T/NK HPCs but not on primary B-cell progenitors (Haddad et al, Stem Cells 26:312; 2008). Moreover, HOXB4 improves the ex vivo generation of human NK-cell progenitors, resulting in high numbers of functional mature NK cells (Haddad et al, Leukemia 21:1836; 2007)",

However, most of the research that has been performed with CPPs restricted to in vivo studies. Preclinical investigations are rare and the clinical validation of potential of CPPs is required. A series of CPPs were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) on an ABI 433A synthesizer. The stability of these peptides in human serum was determined.

            "text": "Design and synthesis of a tripartate paclitaxel prodrug for melanoma therapy Therapy of melanoma continues to be a challenge since, regardless of the treatment used, long-term survival is quite uncommon. In an attempt to improve the effectiveness and decrease the toxicity of anticancer chemotherapy, one useful approach might be to administer a prodrug that specifi cally releases the active cytotoxic drug at the tumor site. In this work, we describe the synthesis of a peptide conjugate of paclitaxel potentially useful in the treatment of human melanoma, and characterized by the simultaneous presence of three functional domains: a \"targeting domain\", an \"activation sequence\", and the antitumor drug paclitaxel. The \"targeting domain\" of the prodrug is represented by an RGD-containing cyclic peptide, able to bind selectively to alpha-V beta-3 integrin, which is known to be highly over-expressed by both metastatic human melanoma cells, and endothelial cells of tumor vessels. The \"activation sequence\", responsible for the selective release of the drug, is a short peptide which is cleaved specifi cally by cathepsin B, a protease highly up-regulated in malignant tumors. The results of NMR conformational studies, as well as those of biological experiments aimed at evaluating the plasma stability of the prodrug and its ability to inhibit alpha-V beta-3-mediated tumor cell adhesion to vitronectin, will be also presented. Angiogenesis is a remodeling process characterized by the sprouting of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones. It occurs during embryogenesis and to a limited extent in the adult. VEGF is a homodimeric protein and has been characterized as a prime regulator of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis; when cells lose the ability to control the synthesis of VEGF, angiogenic disease ensues (1) . In vitro studies show that VEGF is a potent and specifi c angiogenic factor involved in the development of the vascular system and in the differentiation of endothelial cells (2) . VEGF biological function is mediated through binding to two receptor tyrosine kinases: the kinase domain receptor (KDR) and the Fms-like tyrosine kinase (Flt-1), which are localized on the cell surface of various endothelial cell types. This binding activates signal transduction and can regulate both physiological and pathological angiogenesis (3) . VEGF and its receptors are overexpressed in pathological angiogenesis, making this system a potential target for therapeutic and diagnostic applications (4) . The extracellular portion of VEGF receptors is comprised of 7 immunoglobulin-like domains; deletion studies have shown that the ligand binding function resides within the fi rst three domains of Flt-1 and in domains 2 and 3 of KDR. Actually, no structural data are known on the extracellular portion of these receptors except for the second domain of Flt-15.. So, our aim is the cloning and the expression of part of extracellular domains of both VEGF receptors for structural characterization and to be used in interaction studies with peptide ligands or small organic molecule. We are interested in an activation mechanism of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), especially, how the transmembrane (TM) and the intracellular juxtamembrane (JM) region couple ligand binding to tyrosine phopsphorylation. One of the RTKs that we are working on is Neu. Neu (ErbB2) is one of the four members of ErbB receptor family. This RTK with a mutation in the transmembrane region (V664E) has been recognized as a potent transforming oncogene product. Structure of the TM region dimer and its structural difference between the wild type and V664E mutant have been reported by Smith et.al. (1) , providing structural constraints for modeling the TM dimer. Recently, we have performed a structural study on a TM-JM region of EGFR (ErbB1) showing that the TM helix breaks at the membrane interface and the unfolded JM region binds electrostatically to the membrane. We also have shown that Ca2+ complex with calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) binds to the positively charged JM region and pulls this portion off the membrane. These results are consistent with an electrostatic engine model, postulated by McLaughlin and coworkers (2) , for the autoinhibition and activation of the EGFR. In this research, we are revisiting the structure of TM-JM region of Neu to see if we can apply the electrostatic engine model to Neu and to see if there is a structural difference between the wild type and the mutant TM-JM sequence. Here we describe structural studies on the TM-JM sequence, Neu(647-693), reconstituted into bilayer vesicles. A combination of solid state NMR, infrared and fl uorescence measurements are used to draw conclusions that the unfolded JM binds electrostatically to the membrane and binding of Ca2+ -calmodulin to the positively charged JM sequence can, under some conditions, reverse its charge and release it from the membrane. @The collagen triple-helix consists of three polypeptide chains, each of which takes the poly-L-proline II form in a left-handed helix and undergoes a transition to a single coil state as the temperature increases. This characteristic structure is ascribed to the unique amino acid sequence X-Y-Gly, where X and Y are commonly Pro or 4(R)-hydroxyproline (Hyp R ). @So far, various NMR studies have been done to explain the mechanism of folding and the thermal stability of the triple helical structure by using model peptides rich in imino acids. However, the complexity of NMR spectra imposed severe limitations on detailed analysis. The spectrum is complicated because of a large number of conformational isomers due to cis/trans isomerization around each imino acid causing various chemical shifts with small differences in 1H-NMR spectra. It has been demonstrated that the site directed 15N enrichment allows real time NMR monitoring of the folding of residues at specifi c locations of collagen model peptides (1) . @To approach this problem, we have applied 19F-NMR study on various collagen model peptides containing 4(R)-fl uoroproline (fPro R ). Compared to 1H and 13C, 19F chemical-shifts are extremely sensitive to small environmental changes around the nuclei and show a wide dispersion of chemical shifts. As a result, we not only distinguished the signals from the triple helix and unfolded states, but also differentiated the signals at intermediates states in 1D 19F-NMR spectrum of (Pro-fPro R -Gly) 7 . @Here, in this study, a combination of 2D NMR experiments including EXSY, HOESY, and TOCSY has been used to investigate detailed equilibrium properties of collagen model peptides. Especially, in the 2D 19 F-EXSY spectra, we successfully observed many exchange cross peaks at high temperature. The 19 F-NMR method shown here provides a clue to analyze the conformational transition, dynamics and stability of collagen triple-helix. By contrast to well-folded natural peptides, oligomers consisting of nonnatural building blocks, so-called foldamers, are highly stable towards proteolytic degradation which is a key feature in the development of peptide-based drugs. Aside from the fact that foldamers consisting ofand -amino acid building blocks are able to display different secondary structures, the combination of different homologous building blocks to hybrid peptides has recently shown some promising results. [1, 2] The ab initio MO theoretical studies have shown that / -hybrid peptides composed of alternating -and amino acid building blocks might be very well suited to mimic helical conformations. (3) Here we report the fi rst examples of -helical coiled coil formation with synthetic foldamers. Based on the computational studies, we synthesized heterogeneous peptides by automated Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). Purifi cation was carried out by HPLC, and products were confi rmed by ESI-ToF-MS. Furthermore, temperature-dependent CD spectroscopy was applied to investigate the stability of hetero-oligomers formed between, either / -or / / -hybrid peptides with a naturalhelical coiled coil peptide. In addition, the interaction potential with their natural -helical counterparts in aqueous solution were investigated by CD, and F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET).",

Exhibiting Ki value at low nanomolar range it was ranked among the most potent inactivators of LAP reported so far (1) . Recently, the compound has been also successfully employed to inhibit leucyl aminopeptidase of P. falciparum, a potential target protease for the development of new antimalarials (2) . Thus, its structure represented an attractive lead for the design and construction of next generations of modifi ed analogues. They were targeted towards both LAP as well as a related metalloprotease -microsomal leucine aminopeptidase (APM, E.C.3.4.11.2). These achievements, including recent results of studies on synthesis and activity, will be summarized here. We recently described the synthesis of some cyclic tetrapeptides bearing imidazole side chains and we analyzed, in detail, their copper(II) binding properties in aqueous solution. 1 The copper(II) species obtained are of interest in relation to copper-protein active-site biomimetics. In particular, a 13-membered ring cyclic tetrapeptide c(Lys-DHis-Ala-His) (DK13) was synthesized by the solid-phase peptide synthesis method and its copper(II) coordination properties were studied. 2 Surprisingly, all collected data strongly support the presence, at alkaline pH, of a stable peptide/copper(III) complex that is formed in solution by atmospheric dioxygen oxidation. In order to clarify the mechanism of the copper oxidation through the average Cu-N bond distance and to get information on the local geometry around copper, depending on the peptide sequence, we have collected experimental XANES and EXAFS spectra. The investigated cyclopeptide/copper complex shows pre-edge peak energy position and integrated intensity consistent with those of Cu 3+ model compounds. Also, edge energy is consistent with the presence of trivalent copper. Then, calculations performed on the EXAFS measures should give information on the local geometry, confi rming the square planar geometry proposed by us for this DK13/Cu(III) complex. ",

The role of prion is not yet completely known but PrPc seems to be involved in Cu (II) traffi cking from synaptic clefts and in preventing neuronal oxidative damage. Doppel is expressed in heart and testis and has been shown a regulator of male fertility. Therefore, despite a high sequence homology and a similar three-dimensional fold, it's possible to hypothesize that the function of the two protein is not correlated. In the literature is reported that both PrPc and of Dpl are able to bind Cu (II) but the characterization of the complex species is well defi ned only for PrPc. Several binding sites of Dpl are involved in the complexation with Cu (II). [1, 2] In the present work we have focused our attention to the third alpha-helix of the Dpl which is the preferential binding site for the metal ion. We have synthesized two peptide fragments relative to the 122-140 sequence of the Dpl. The fi rst peptide has the native sequence whereas in the second fragment the Asp 124 was replaced by a Asn residue. This substitution was performed to understand the role played by the carboxylate group of the Asp residue in the complexation of Cu (II). CD ad NMR spectra were carried out on the two peptides in absence and presence of Cu (II) to investigate conformational features upon Cu (II) binding. Finally, the complex species formed were completely characterized by using spectroscopic (NMR, CD, UV-Vis, EPR) and thermodynamic measurements (potentiometric titrations). Three-dimensional (3D) domain swapping of proteins is a phenomenon associated with formation of oligomers and fi brils of several amyloidogenic proteins (1) . The propensity of a particular protein to undergo domain swapping depends on factors like changes in environment or presence of specifi c mutations, but also on some topological determinants. It was proposed that domain swapping-prone proteins have some common \"hot spots\" in their structures that facilitate the process. One of these motives are so called \"hinge loops\" -turns showing enhanced propensity for unfolding due to conformational constraints (2). Cystatin C (hCC), main inhibitor of cysteine proteases in human body was shown to dimerize (3) and oligomerize (4) through domain swapping. hCC contains highly conserved throughout the cystatin family loop L1, connecting two beta strands which, together with the only helix in the protein fold create a structural unit that undergoes the 3D process.",

As it was expected, substitution of Val57 with either asparagine or aspartic acid residues abolished dimerization process almost completely. In contrast, V57P mutant shows enhanced dimerization propensity. Above observations are in good agreement with theoretical studies, performed on entire hCC and its fragment encompassing the hairpin structure centered on loop L1. The expansion of the CAG trinucleotide that produces polyglutamine (polyQ) segments in several proteins is responsible for at least eight neurodegenerative diseases. A possible therapeutic approach would be to inhibit the polyQ self-assembly process using disrupting agents. Although, screening studies have identifi ed several polyQ aggregation inhibitors, their mechanism of action remains unknown. This is due to the poor aqueous solubility and fast aggregation of uncharged polyQ peptides, which complicate their study. The most common strategy to resolve these problems is to produce polyQ stretches fl anked with charged residues. However, this strategy was found to modify the aggregation behaviour of polyQs, their aggregate structure and their affi nity for disrupting molecules. To circumvent these problems, polyQ peptides containing morpholine moieties, whose charge is pH-dependent, were produced using Fmoc-based chemistry on SPPS. Following an acid treatment, the designed peptides were soluble in acidic aqueous solutions and their aggregation rate could be controlled by pH variations and followed by dynamic light scattering. Furthermore, aggregation initiated at physiological pH provided uncharged fi brils allowing the evaluation of the effects of charged disrupting agents. The actions of known polyQ aggregation inhibitors such as polyQ-binding peptide 1 (QBP1), trehalose and Congo red were studied. Peptide-protein and protein-protein interactions play key roles in most biological processes, and therefore represent valuable targets for drug discovery. An approach in the search of new chemical entities able to interfere with these interactions is the use of small molecules able to mimic or to induce precise aspects of specifi c peptide secondary structures. Among the secondary structure elements, reverse turns have been shown relevant in many biomolecular recognition events. Thus, different efforts have been directed to the design of turn mimetics or inducers. In this sense, 2-substituted azetidine-2-carboxylates, synthesized by our group through a versatile procedure from amino acids, possess the dihedral angle restricted to approximately 70\u00ba or -70\u00ba, depending on the absolute confi guration at the asymmetric carbon. These values are similar to those reported for the central residues of main types of -and -turns, and in fact, recent studies have shown the ability of the 2,2-disubstituted azetidines to induce -turns when incorporated at the i+1 position of model peptides. To know if this conformational behavior is distinctive of these restricted amino acids, we now investigate the infl uence of the incorporation of these amino acids at the i+2 position of model peptides. With this aim, we have synthesized a series of simplifi ed tetrapeptide models, RCO-L-Ala-Azx-NHMe, in which the RCO and NHMe groups are simplifi cations of the i and i+3 residues of the turn, respectively. For comparative purposes, dipeptide derivatives incorporating azetidine-2-carboxylate, Pro and -MePro have also been prepared. The turn inducing capacities of all these model tetrapeptides have been analyzed by molecular modelling, \u00b9H RMN, FT-IR and X-ray methodologies. The results have shown the importance of the , -disubstitution at the heterocyclic amino acid for stabilizing reverse turns, and the infl uence of the ring size on the induced turn type",

According to the peptide's length and neighboring amino acid residues, dehydroamino acid exerts S-shaped, -turn or helical conformation in peptides [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) somatic form bears two catalytic domains with two Zn metal ions, while the testis form bears remarkable similarity to the aminoacid sequence of ACE C-catalytic domain and only one Zn metal ion. However, both exhibit their hydrolytic activity to vasoactive peptides such as angiotensin I (AngI) and bradykinin (BK), though with different effi cacy. In order to study experimentally the possible interaction and binding events between the ACE active site(s) and known ACE substrates or inhibitors, we constructed peptide-based catalytic site maquettes (CSM). 46-residue peptides were synthesized through solid-phase peptide synthesis having the aminoacid sequence that correspond to the ACE Val380-Ala425 N-domain segment and to the Val978-Ala1023 C-domain segment and enzyme's active sites were reconstructed through addition of zinc metal ion in solution. The resulting complexes have the metal ion bound in a native-like mode, as manifested by previously reported NMR data. The reconstituted peptides were titrated separately by Captopril and Angiotensin-I with a molar ratio ACE:Captopril/AngI 1:15 and 1:5, respectively. Titration was followed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and spectral changes (chemical shifts, line broadening, etc.) were recorded and analyzed. After the end of AngI titration the solution of interacting peptides was titrated with Captopril and the titration was followed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. At the end of each titration 2D homonuclear 1 H-1 H TOCSY and NOESY spectra were recorded. Analysis of high-resolution NMR data probes the conformational variation of ACE CSM and peptide substrates upon interaction, and in the presence of Captopril in ACE-AngI solutions.",

            "text": "Contemporary development in nanotechnology is fabrication of nanostructured materials using the peptide-based self-assembly. Importance of peptide as monomeric components is their capacity to be engineered to mediate spontaneous supramolecular self-assembly and their inherent chemical nature that facilitates chemical and biological recognition process. Tubular self-assembled peptide nanostructures are of special interest since these can serve in various applications including 'bottom-up' fabrication of molecular scaffolds, nanoelectromechanical systems and nanomachines. An important discovery by Gazit group revealed that the simple dipeptide molecule of phenylalanine which is core recognition motif of the Alzheimer's -amyloid polypeptide effi ciently self-assembles into well-ordered nanotubular structure (1) which could be controlled by relatively simple chemical modifi cations at its termini. Based on these observations and our interest in the synthesis of softmaterials for nanotechnology, we have successfully synthesized novel monomeric units of di-peptides with ureido functional group at Nterminal of various hydrophobic L-amino acids. These derivatives have been prepared by using solid phase peptide synthesis protocol with cost effective process retaining the chirality of molecule. These ureido dipeptide formed nanostructures with high yield under mild and controlled condition in aqueous media. To fully understand the molecular and supramolecular mechanism guiding the formation of nanostructures we have selected a multidisciplinary approach by combining spectroscopic studies with advanced electron microscopic techniques. The morphology of nanostructures can be controlled by using variety of L-amino acids. These novel ureido di-peptides nanotubes can be used in fabrication of biocompatible peptide-based nanostructures and they will undoubtedly have nanotechnological applications. Biomolecules are excellent in hierarchically organizing a characteristic structure by self-assembly. The spontaneous assembly of biomolecules has advanced a bottom-up approach for fabrication of nanostructured materials. We have developed fabrication of controlled nanofi bers through self-assembly of simple and short de novo designedsheet peptides with unique sequences [1, 2] . The single straight nanofi ber with high regularity constructed by -sheet FI peptide (sequence: PKFKIIEFEP) was functionalized with proteins by biotinylated peptides (3) and using functional anchors that have binding and functional groups. Conjugation of self-assembled peptide nanofi bers with biomolecules such as peptides and proteins will expand their potentialities of the nanofi bers for various applications. To identify peptides binding to the self-assembled FI peptide nanofi ber, a phage display combinatorial screening using a random peptide library was performed. After fi ve rounds of biopanning, phage pools with highly specifi c affi nities to FI nanofi bers were screened. As a result of DNA sequencing after phage cloning, 12 phage clones were identifi ed. Binding affi nities of these clones were quantitatively investigated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These clones showed specifi c affi nities to FI nanofi bers, as compared with FF and VI nanofi bers having slightly differences of amino acid sequences.",

Infrared spectroscopy studies by using chemically-synthesized peptides showed that the peptide binds specifi cally to the FI nanofi ber with structural transitions. Owing to their diversity in size and shape, easy access, and biocompatibility, peptides represent versatile units for the construction of H-bonded tubular assemblies and other biomimetic materials with potentially useful applications. So-called peptide nanotubes (PNTs) have been obtained through multiple and complementary approaches (1). Originally designed from -peptides made of D-and L-amino acids (2) , fl at macrocyclic systems forming cylindricalsheet like assemblies have diversifi ed to include oligoamides made from higher amino acid homologs as well as peptide hybrids (e.g. ,peptides). Tubular sheet-like assemblies however are not restricted to oligoamides. The urea group which shares a number of features with the amide linkage, i.e. rigidity, planarity, polarity, and hydrogen bonding capacity is an interesting surrogate. We and other have demonstrated that macrocyclic biotic and abiotic N,N'-linked oligoureas have a unique propensity to self-organize into polar H-bonded nanotubes (3). Partial peptide backbone N-methylation has been introduced as a general strategy to generate truncated stacks (i.e. H-bonded dimers) useful to gain access to the thermodynamics of nanotube formation (1). Herein, we describe biotic macrocyclic amide/urea hybrids with partially Nalkylated backbones as new candidates for the formation of H-bonded dimers. A cysteine branched PGA (polyglutamic acid) hydrogel is being investigated for therapeutic peptide and protein controlled delivery. Entrapment of hGH as a model protein in this hydrogel has been carried out in order to check its later release in different aqueous buffered media and stability. Different physico-chemical analysis (by MALDI-TOF, SEC-MALS-RI, 1H-NMR, CD, \u2026) of the released hGH showed no effect on destabilization of the protein. Controlled release systems of proteins involve important challenges such as maintaining the protein integrity. Researchers need an exhaustive understanding of protein stability issue in drug delivery formulations. Common degradative reactions in proteins involve: oxidation, deamidation, stability of disulfi de bonds and aggregation, which may affect secondary and tertiary structure of proteins and thus, their biological activity. The high water content which imbibes the polymer network of hydrogels enables a good accommodation for proteins. Polyamino acids have been already studied in some biotechnological applications, however, in spite of their potential, they have barely been taken into account for the development of controlled release microparticles. We show that proteins could be easily loaded into Cys cross-linked PGA hydrogels. The protein hGH has been loaded and released preserving its physico-chemical integrity. Thus, these hydrogels are promising for their use as therapeutic protein delivery systems.",

Here, we report the development of collagenlike gels by means of the intermolecular folding of chemically synthesized peptides. The peptides are disulfi de-linked trimers of collagenous Gly-X-Y triplet repeats with self-complementary shapes. The self-complementary peptides are able to form elongated triple-helix through spontaneous intermolecular folding. Upon cooling of the peptide solutions, hydrogels of peptide supramolecules formed. The gel-sol transition was appeared to be reversible, and the transition temperatures were found to be tunable by the design of the peptides. Our strategy for the totally synthetic collagen will offer possibilities for the development of innovative biomaterials. Recent advance in biotechnology enables us to fi nd the peptides with affi nity for nonbiological materials and with function of mineralizing inorganic materials. The use of the functional peptides is attracting a growing interest for bottom-up fabrication approaches of nanoscale devise. Zinc oxide (ZnO), a semiconductor with a wide direct band gap, possess unique optical, acoustic, and electronic properties, so that it is one of most widely studied metal oxides for solar cells, ultra violet nanolaser, blue light-emitting diode and so on. This wide variety of applications requires various fabrications of morphologically and functionally distinct ZnO nanostructures. Here, the peptides which are selected from the phage-displayed peptide library with a 12-mer on the surface, can bind ZnO particle but not other metal oxides particle, and further, the ZnO-binding peptides play an important role on the crystal growth of ZnO in its synthesis. The anti-ZnO peptide can assist the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles from a Zn(OH) 2 solution even at 4 \u00baC, and further, the peptide leads to the self-assembly of synthesized ZnO particles to fl ower-type morphologies. We describe the biomimetic ZnO synthesis using the artifi cial peptide with affi nity for ZnO. The design of nanoparticles suitably functionalized for applications in biology or medicine is an ongoing challenge for both chemists and biologists. Nanoparticles such as quantum dots, gold nanoparticles or carbon based-materials offer, in addition to their remarkable physical properties, the possibility to be functionalized by biomolecules, making them suitable for sensing, detection, diagnostic, and/or therapeutic applications. Recently, quantum dots have been designed for biological imaging owing to their unique size-dependent fl uorescence properties. However, their plausible toxicity still remains a major concern for in vitro and in vivo applications. Nanodiamonds, (NDs) are also candidates for biomedical applications considering their intrinsic or induced fl uorescence and biocompatibility. The work will describe: i) the functionalisation and the characterization of 35 nm non-fl uorescent cNDs and ii) their use in toxicity and transport studies in living cells after the grafting of a fl uorescent model peptide. We chose to introduce a nonpermeant fl uorescent peptide for the tracking of the nanoparticles on or inside the cells. Nanodiamonds (cNDs, 35 nm) coated by silanisation or with polyelectrolyte layers have been grafted with a fl uorescent thiolated peptide via a maleimido function, leading to aqueous colloidal suspensions stable for months. For each step of the preparation, the diameter of the NDs measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS), the zeta potential, the amount of amino groups grafted onto the surface, as well as the stability of the different NDs suspensions No cytotoxicity was observed up to 72 hours incubation with CHO cells with any of the prepared (40 g/mL). Their capacity to enter mammalian cells, and their localisation inside CHO cells, have been ascertained by confocal microscopy, refl ected light and fl uorescence.",

It is known that the use of proteins and peptide antigens as vaccines has several potential advantages over whole viral or bacterial preparations. To elicit the maximum immunogenic response from synthetic peptide antigens ,it is generally necessary to bind the peptide to carrier protein. Moreover, to realize the full potential of synthetic peptide antigens protein-peptide conjugate will have to be used with an adjuvant. We have developed new approches for obtaining highly immunogenic peptide conjugatessynthetic polyelectrolytes (PE) were used for the conjugation with peptide molecules in which PE carry out the carrier and adjuvant roles simultaneously. This concept drive us to create new immunogenic bioconjugates of Hepatitis B surface antigenic polypeptides (HbsAg) with synthetic PE. In this study we used the region 95-109 of the s gene. The synthesis of peptides was performed by Explorer PLS \u00ae Automated Microwave Synthesis Workstation (CEM), by using F-moc Chemistry. Copolymers of acrylic acid with different monomers were used as a PE for the conjugation with polypeptides. PE-peptide conjugates was synthesized by microwave assisted method. Composition and structure of bioconjugates werw characterized by HPLC, Spectrofl uorometry and different spectrophotometric methods. Protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions are among the few essential cell processes whose understanding provide us insights into fundamental events of the life cycle. Aside from in silico methods, natively folded proteins are an absolute prerequisite in all current biotechnological tools used for the study of these interactions. However, the recently developed IANUS peptide array has a potential to evolve in to a protein-free method for detection of protein-protein interaction sites. Using this assay, protein-protein interactions could be represented by and investigated as peptide-peptide interactions using peptide pairs immobilized on a solid support.(1) . Two main obstacles had to be overcome for successful implementation of this array: (i) the library size and (ii) identifi cation of interacting peptide pairs. If, for example, interactions between two small proteins of only approx. 100 amino acids each should be analyzed, a library of ca. 2500 peptide pairs would be needed to cover all possible combinations of overlapping peptides derived from these proteins. Although libraries of several thousand peptides were already successfully synthesized, the library size could be reduced drastically if the binding pocket of one protein is already known or if the protein-ligand interactions are studied. Up to date, two methods for the identifi cation of interacting peptides in a library have been developed in our group. Both methods will be demonstrated in studies of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. ",

            "text": "The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, ISRAEL Self-assembly of macromolecules into large complexes is often mediated by folding of disordered regions. We used peptides to investigate the role of the non-helical tailpiece from non-muscle myosin IIC (NM-IIC) in its self-assembly process. NM-IIC is a motor protein composed of a globular motor domain in the N-terminal region and a coiled-coil rod domain in the C-terminal region, which terminates with a non-helical 47-residue tailpiece (residues 1954-2000) . NM-IIC molecules undergo self-assembly into fi laments that are necessary for its contractile activity. The tailpiece has an unfolded character and participates in the assembly process of NM-IIC. The N-terminal region of the tailpiece (residues 1954-1968) has a net positive charge of +3 while its C-terminal region (residues 1969-2000) has a net negative charge of -10. We designed peptides that correspond to the entire tailpiece and to its negative and positive regions. These peptides were used to study interactions with the rod, their structures in the free and bound states, and structural changes they undergo upon binding to residues 1296-1854 of NM-IIC rod. Fluorescence anisotropy binding studies showed that a peptide corresponding to the positive region of the tailpiece (residues 1947-1968) bound the NM-IIC rod (residues 1296-1854) with an affi nity of 13 M. Circular dichroism studies showed that the positively charged peptide became folded upon binding the rod, indicated by a shift of the spectral minimum from 200 nm to 220 nm upon binding. A peptide corresponding to the negative region of the tailpiece (residues 1969-2000) did not bind NM-IIC (residues 1296-1854). Based on our results, we suggest that the positive region of the tailpiece is required for ordering and aligning neighboring molecules by electrostatic attraction, leading to fi lament formation. Our results provide molecular insight into the role of the structurally disordered tailpiece of NM-IIC in the selfassembly process.",

We hypothesized that a supramolecular complex, the leukemia cell invadosome, which contains certain integrins, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other as yet unidentifi ed proteins, is essential for tissue invasion and may be central to the phenotypic diversity observed in the clinic. Here we show that the specifi c binding of MMP-9 to leukocyte surface \u00e1M 2 integrin is required for pericellular proteolysis and migration of AMLderived cells. An effi cient antileukemia effect was obtained by peptide inhibitors that prevented proMMP-9 cell surface binding, transmigration through an endothelial cell layer, and extracellular matrix degradation. Notably, the functional protein anchorage between \u00e1M 2 integrin and proMMP-9 described in this study does not involve the enzymatic active sites targeted by any of the existing MMP inhibitors. Taken together, our results provide a biochemical working defi nition for the human leukemia invadosome. Disruption of specifi c protein complexes within this supramolecular target complex may yield a new class of anti-AML drugs with anti-invasion (rather than cytotoxic) attributes. The molecular mechanisms of action of the polycationic lysine homoand heterodendrimers on functional activity of adenylyl cyclase signaling system (AC system) in the myocardium and the brain of rats were studied. The lysine homodendrimers of the third (I), the fourth (II) and the fi fth (III) generations, as well as the lysine heterodendrimers of the fi fth generation -[(NH 2 ) 64 (Lys-Glu) 32 (Lys-Glu) 16 (Lys-Glu) 8 (Lys-Glu) 4 (Lys-Glu) 2 Lys-Ala-Ala-Lys(ClAc)-Ala-NH 2 ] (IV), [(NH 2 ) 64 (Lys-Ala) 32 (Lys-Ala) 16 (Lys-Ala) 8 (Lys-Ala) 4 (Lys-Ala) 2 Lys-Ala-Lys(ClAc)-Ala-Ala-NH 2 ] (V) and [(NH 2 ) 64 (Lys-Gly-Gly) 32 (Lys-Gly-Gly) 16 (Lys-Gly-Gly) 8 (Lys-Gly-Gly) 4 (Lys-Gly-Gly) 2 Lys-Gly-Gly-Lys(ClAc)-Ala-Ala-NH 2 ] (VI) stimulated by receptor-independent mechanism the activity of heterotrimeric G proteins, preferably of inhibitory type, and interacted with C-terminal regions of their -subunits. The homodendrimers II and III and heterodendrimer V were more effective G protein activators. The treatment of the membranes with pertussis toxin (inactivating G i protein), but not with cholera toxin, led to a decrease of G protein activation effect of the dendrimers. The lysine dendrimers disturbed the functional coupling of the receptors of biogenic amines and peptides hormones with G i proteins and, to a smaller extent, with G s proteins. It was illustrated by the decrease of regulatory effects of the hormones on AC activity and G protein GTP binding and by the decrease of receptor affi nity to agonists in the presence of the lysine dendrimers, as result of receptor-G protein complex dissociation. It was shown that the molecular mechanisms of the action and the G protein selectivity of the polylysine dendrimers are similar to those of mastoparan and melittin, natural toxins of insect venom, which also preferably activate G i/o proteins and inhibit G i/o -coupled signaling.

Transcription factors are able to recognize their cognate DNA sequences and regulate the expression of proteins. As a model system, the specifi c DNA binding of the transcription factor PhoB from E. coli is investigated in single molecule experiments. Structurally, PhoB belongs to the family of winged helix-turn-helix proteins. It is composed of a transactivation domain (amino acids 1-127) and a DNA binding domain (amino acids 123-229). After phosphorylation of the transactivation domain, the protein binds to specifi c DNA sequences containing a TGTCA consensus sequence. Different C-terminally modifi ed protein epitopes representing parts of the DNA binding domain of PhoB were chemically synthesized using microwave assisted solid phase peptide synthesis. The binding contributions of these molecules are compared to the complete DNA binding domain (127-229).

Using amenable databases, identifi cation in \"bottom-up\" proteomics is often straightforward but is highly complex in the absence of genome data, which typically requires \"de novo\"-identifi cation approaches. We present here a new approach for identifi cation of proteins from a bacterial strain, Desulfotignum phosphitoxidans, with unknown genomic background, using a combination of (i), inverted PCR of degenerate primers derived from N-terminal Edman sequencing, and (ii) high resolution MALDI-FTICR mass spectrometric peptide mass fi ngerprint-proteomics of expressed proteins. Desulfotignum phosphitoxidans is an anaerobic sulfatereducing bacterium from marine sediment in which phosphite oxidation was found crucial for energy metabolism. Culturing under different growth conditions provided 4 specifi cally expressed proteins with molecular masses of ca. 40 kDa in the presence of phosphate, which were subjected to 2D-gel electrophoretical separation for soluble and membrane fractions using PDQuest comparative analysis. N-Terminal sequences of the proteins, determined by Edman analysis were used for inverted PCR of degenerate primers, and provided a series of ORF candidates, one of which coded for a putative NAD-dependent dehydratase. In a complementary approach, protein spots from the 2D-gels were excised, digested with Lys-C protease, and digestion mixtures analysed by MALDI-FTICR-MS. The accurate peptide masses unequivocally matched to identify a new NAD-dependant epimerase/ dehydratase. The detailed functional characterization of the new protein, and further development and application of this approach to proteome analysis with unknown genomic background, are currently in progress. Based on specially treated large pore silica and enhanced with a proprietary bonding process, Vydac MS reversed-phase (RP) HPLC columns offer superior performance for peptides and proteins. The deamidation of human growth hormone (HGH) has been monitored for many years by RP using Vydac columns. The Vydac MS C4 column provides the best overall performance characteristics (recovery, resolution, and peak symmetry) for the common important assay of HGH and desamido HGH. Although hydrophobic membrane proteins are particularly diffi cult to separate, the Vydac MS C4 column provides better separation and recovery (up to 86% higher vs. other leading columns) for a reptilian reovirus p14 protein and myristolyated form, a component of a potentially new vaccine delivery system. Separation of the trypsin digest of fetuin, a glycoprotein, exhibits improved selectivity for peptide mapping on a Vydac MS C18 column compared to other C18 columns, revealing some peaks otherwise not seen. The improved selectivity for peptides on the Vydac MS columns results in better primary structure defi nition and easier identifi cation of degradation products and other protein characteristics.",

The extracts were prepared from snap-frozen organs both in the presence and in absence of protease inhibitors (10 -6 M pepstatin A, 10 -4 M PMSF, 2 mM EDTA) which stabilize the peptide composition of tissue acidic homogenates. The absence of inhibitors led to appearance of novel peptides and did not affect the concentration of predominant peptide components detected in samples prepared with protease inhibitors. Therefore, the latter were considered as present in the tissues prior to extraction, i.e. as endogenous. The majority of predominant peptide components were found common in the studied tissues. We believe that the presence of predominant (> 100 pmol/g) peptide components in the protease-inactivated tissue extracts can be reliably extrapolated to their in vivo presence in the tissues. The endogeneity of minor (< 10 pmol/g) components requires a separate consideration. Generally, the results of peptidomic studies strongly depend on sample preparation procedures involved, making diffi cult the straightforward comparison of the results obtained by different research groups. Urine is a promising source of endogenous peptide biomarkers, because the protein concentration is 1000-fold lower than in plasma but the peptide concentration is equal. Urine contains small metabolites that interfere with peptide analysis and urine fl ow varies between subjects and within a day. These variations pose a challenge to urine sample preparation, which, in case of serum, has been shown to be critical for reproducibility. We aim to optimize the enrichment method for urine peptides, to characterize these and to fi nd potential biomarkers. All methods resulted in good peptide recovery if the peptide concentration was normal and metabolite content low. Slightly different peptides were obtained with different methods. The DF preferentially recovered hydrophilic peptides, while SEC-SPE recovered high molecular weight peptides better than the DF-method. SEC-SPE provided the best peptide enrichment especially for samples with high metabolite concentration. Normalization was critical especially with very dilute samples. Without normalization the number of peptides detected was highly dependent on urine concentration. Normalization against specifi c gravity proved the most reproducible results.

            "text": "In order to improve the detection of phosphorylated peptides/proteins, we developed a novel protocol that involves the chemical derivatization of phosphate groups with a chemically engineered biotinylated-tag (biotintag), possessing three functional domains; a biotin group for binding to avidin, a base-labile 4-carboxy fl uorenyl methoxy-carbonyl (4-carboxy Fmoc) group, and a nucleophilic sulfhydryl moiety on the side-chain of cysteine. Using this approach, the derivatized, enzymatically digested peptides were selectively separated from unrelated sequences and impurities on immobilized avidin. Unlike previously published phosphopeptide enrichment procedures, this approach upon treatment with mild base, liberates a covalently bound Gly-Cys analog of the peptide(s) of interest, exhibiting improved RP-HPLC retention and MS ionization properties compared to the precursor phosphopeptide sequence. The results obtained for a model peptide Akt-1 and ovalbumin protein digest, demonstrated that the method is highly specifi c and allows selective enrichment of phosphorylated peptides at low concentrations of femtomoles/ l.",

            "text": "In search of physiological substrates of brain prolyl oligopeptidase. Prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) is a serine protease, which cleaves small peptides at the carboxyl side of an internal proline residue. Substance P, arginine-vasopressin, thyroliberin and gonadoliberin are proposed physiological substrates of this protease. POP has been implicated in a variety of brain processes including learning, memory, and mood regulation, as well as in pathologies such as neurodegeneration, hypertension and mood disorders. However, there is no defi nite information about the physiological substrates of POP in brain. We have determined previously that some POP inhibitors, when administrated orally or intraperitoneal, are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit POP ex vivo. In this work also inhibition duration according to the doses were determined. Using this system we studied the natural occurring peptide profi le in brain tissues from inhibited animals and compare it with the profi le in control tissue. We were able to design a method in which the background peptide level was importantly decreased which allowed us to identify, with high degree of confi dence, the peptides which were changed in rat hypothalamus upon POP inhibitor treatment. Conclusions about the physiological substrates of POP are discussed. [1, 2] . In the present work, we further studied the dependence of peptide production by the cells on their functional state. Using rat hepatocytes as a model, we compared peptide sets generated by: (1) primary hepatocytes in a differentiated state; (2) dedifferentiated primary hepatocytes with fi broblast-like phenotype; (3) rat hepatoma cells. Peptides were extracted from the cellular lysates and supernatants by solid-phase extraction and then separated by RP-HPLC. Peaks were analyzed with MALDI-TOF and/or MALDI-TOF/TOF.

Triostin A is a naturally occurring quinoxaline depsipeptide antibiotic originally isolated from Streptomyces S-2-210. With its two quinoxaline moieties it bis-intercalates into DNA in a GC selective manner. Triostin A contains N-methylated L-valine and L-cystein. The unmethylated analog TANDEM binds AT selectively due to a different hydrogen bonding pattern. Substitution of the disulfi de bridge of TANDEM by an azobenzene moiety leads to photoswitchable analogs. Their photoswitchability was investigated and quantifi ed using UV, CD and NMR spectroscopy as well as HPLC. In order to determine the three-dimensional structure, conformational analysis by NMR spectroscopy in combination with molecular dynamics calculations was carried out. In this process, distance restraints were obtained from NMR spectra measured in DMSO-D 6 and applied in distance geometry/simulated annealing followed by molecular dynamics calculations. As it is possible to distinguish between cis-and transisomer in NMR spectra due to the difference in the chemical shifts, structures of both isomers can be investigated. DNA binding studies were carried out using an optical tweezers setup with -DNA. Furthermore, UV melting curves were recorded for the TANDEM derivatives in complex with DNA. CD spectroscopy was applied to observe changes in DNA structure upon formation of the complex. In addition to structural investigations, the antibiotic activity of the TANDEM derivatives was investigated in minimal inhibition concentration assays against gram-positive Bacillus subtilis.

Cyclic peptide nanotubes are formed by self-assembly of cyclic peptides with alternating L-and D-amino acid. However, peptide nanotube selfassembly phenomenon had not yet been made cleared. Intermolecular electrostatic interaction is one of the important driving forces to assemble cyclic peptides to peptide nanotubes. Here in, a series of cycilc hexapeptides, cyclo(-L-Lys-Gly-) 3 , cyclo(-L-Glu-Gly-) 3 , cyclo(-L-Lys-D-Ala-) 3 , cyclo(-D-Glu-L-Ala-) 3 , cyclo(-L-Trp-D-Lys-) 3 , and cyclo(-L-Trp-D-Glu-) 3 , were designed and synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc strategy. Turbidity study revealed that the abilities of self-assembly formations of the 1:1 mixtures of cyclo(-L-Trp-D-Lys-) 3 and cyclo(-L-Trp-D-Glu-) 3 in aqueous solution are extremely higher than the abilities of each individual positively or negatively charged cyclic peptides. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) experiments showed that mixture of cyclo(-Lys-Xxx-) 3 and cyclo(-Glu-Xxx-) 3 formed fi brous structure. TEM images indicated that, the diameters of the nanotubes were approximately 2-5 nm. Diameter of similar cyclic peptides was found to be 1 nm approx. These results also supported that the bundle formation of peptide nanotube. Conformations of monomer cyclic hexapeptides were calculated based on NMR observation. Estimated formation of peptide nanotube is consisted with the bundle structure.",
