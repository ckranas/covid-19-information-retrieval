Our aim is to evaluate prognostic accuracy of SAPS II as compared with the predictive capabilities of its predecesor SAPS 1, and with the one of APACHE II, probably the most used prognostic method of the available ones. Patients and S~tting; 568 patients admitted in two medical-surgical ICUs of two Hospitals (III -A-and II -B-level) were consecutively admitted (A: 358 and B: 210 patients) and prospectively admitted in the study. Methodology: All patients outcome were predicted by SAPS I and SAPS, as well as APACHE II, using the worst values availables during the first 24 h of stay in ICU. For APACHE II diagnostic grouping according original description was also considered. In all cases, procedence, type of patient (surgical or not, emergency admission or not), sex, age, length of stay (LOS) and other epidemiological data were also collected. Mortality was considered at the end of the hospitalary stay. Non paired Student T test, Chi square test, and Regression methods were used in tha analysis. Overall performance of prognostic methods were compared by means of the calculation of the areas under ROC curves. Significative differences were associated to p < 0.05. Results; Mortality in the study was 21% (p NS A vs B) and there were not significant differences in LOS. SAPS I and SAPS II revealed significant differences in severity when studying A and B populations (p < 0.014 and p < 10 .4) and risk of death evaluation was greater in B population when using SAPS II. For the whole sample and at probability level of 50 %, accuracy of prediction was 83 % for SAPS I and 80 % for SAPS II. At probability level of 90 %, accuracies of prediction for both methods were respectively 79 % and 82 %.. When using APACHE II, accuracies were 82% and 80 %. There were not signinficant differences, at any of the considered probability levels (50, 70 and 90 %), between real mortality and predicted mortality when any of the three methodologies were utilized, Facing the evidence that SAPS II do not represent, in our population, predictive advantages in front of SAPS I, a regression equation has been developed between SAPS II and SAP I (SAPS II = 10.",

Mesenteric ischemia could be the reason for inmunologic damage, greater incidence of nosocomiai infection and the MOF syndrome appearance. Objective: To analize the existing relations between SatO2 and L levels in blood coming from the splachnic area through suprahepatics veins (S) and the ones from pulmonary artery blood (AP) in order to detect early markers of mesenteric isehemia. Material and Method: 13 patients whose situation coped with Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), under mechanical ventilation and in stable haemodynamic condition were included in the study. Floating balloon tipped catheters were situated both in pulmonary artery and in suprahepatic vein. Proper situation was assessed by fluoroscopic examination. Simultaneous blood samples were obtaines from S ( both balloon inflated -SH-and notinflated -SD-) and pulmonary artery. In these samples blood gases and Sat 02, biochemical parameters -L, amylases, bilirrubin and GPT-and free radicals production markers -MAD and CYS-, were analyzed. Results were analyzed by means of paired T test methods and significant differences were accepted if p < 0.05. Results: Seven patients died between days 7 and 8 after the study. SatO2 in SH blood samples were significantly lower in patients to die (p: 0.037), but these results were not found neither in SD nor in AP blood. Sat 02 SH [ SatO2 AP ratio was about 53 % in the group of non survivors and about 85 % in the survivors group. L was greater and pH lower in all the samples from non survivors. MDA was permanently higher and CYS constantly lower. Conclusions: SatO2 SH and SatO2 SH/SatO2 AP ratio, are both good predictors of mortality in patients with SIRS. Blood sampling with inflated balloon from S avoids contamination with mixed venous blood from inferior cava vein. There are no studies that define kinds of pathology on admission diagnosis among Intensive Care Units in a entire country. The PAEEC Project, in Spain rhaa tried, among other subjests~ to address these issues. Material and methods: We collected data of nearly 10.00(] patients belonging to 95 ICU's. In all cases we recorded kind of patient, admission diagnosis (physiopathological syndrome) and main diagnosis (traditional diagnosis). The classification of these diagnosis was specifically designed for this study.",

            "text": "Kind of patients (Over all-non urgents/urgents///amang deaths-non urgents/urgents): Medical Although Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are present in most of the Italian Hospital, the heterogeneity of the patients case-mix and the large variation in structural, organizational and staffing arrangements have limited the feasibility and precision of evaluation studies aimed at assessing the quality of health care delivered and its impact on patients outcomes. To best describe the Italian ICUs from the structural, procedural and patients outcome point of view, in 1992, we designed a mutticentric study involving 114 ICUs within the country with the objective of: 1) describing the baseline charactedstics of a group of patients admitted to the involved ICUs, with particular interest for the patients' outcome either at discharge from ICU or within three months after hospital discharge; 2) describing the structure of the participant ICUs; 3) describing the volume and the intensity of the treatments delivered to patients during thief stay in the ICU. Data collection began on May 11th, I992 and was completed on July 11th, 1992 Patients enrolled were 5111, ranging between 6 and 120 patients for single ICU, More than 40% of the admitted patients entered the ICU coming from the Emergency Department, 30% from the Operating Room, 25% from general hospital wards and only the last 5% were trasferred from other ICUs. The mean age of patients was 54 years, with 39% of them older than 65. The reason for admission in tCU was: respiratory failure in 26%; neurologic failure in 11%, cardiovascular failure in 6%; combination of the above reason in 21%; monitoring for expected clinical instability in 36%. More than 40% were admitted with a co-existent chronic disease while the mean SAPS was 10.6, with the great majority of patients (76%) with a SAPS score below 15. The overall ICU's mortality rate was 26% which rises to more than 40% during the follow-up period. As for the treatment, 65% required mechanical ventilation, 43% arterial catheterization and 7% pulmonary artedal pressure monitoring. Regarding the ICUs involved in the project, the mean number of beds is 7.5 (range 3-18) with an average number of patients admitted in 1 year of 320 (range 89W41). The most frequent structure of ICU includes a single room with one bed together with other rooms with two or more beds (56%). However, single room alone (19%) and rooms with two or more beds with no single room (19%) are also present. We believe that these findings give an accurate view of Intensive Care in Italy in order to start further ad hoc studies addressing more specific issues based on solid evidence. The occurence of fever in a patient of intensive care very often leads to the removal of a central venous catheter which is most of the time sterile. The aim of this prospective study was to compare differential blood culture (DBC) and quantitative catheter cultures (QCC) for the diagnosis of catheter related sepsis. METHODS: During one year, 174 central venous catheters were inserted in 113 adult patients hospitalized in two intensive care units (surgical and medical). All patients had the same dressing protocol (conventional occlusive dressing with polyvidone iodine). Catheters were removed because no longer needed or suspected infection. Immediately before removal, DBC were performed with blood drawn simultaneously from the catheter and a peripheral vein. After removal, QCC were performed according to Cleri modified Brun-Buisson technique. RESULTS: Patients mean age was 51 (SD:20). Initial SAPS was 12.4 (SD:4,6). Mean duration of catheterization was 8.5 d (SD:4.5). 26 catheters were positive (14.9% of catheters, 23% of patients). According to CDC classification, 5 were contaminated( less than i03 CFU/ml), 12 were colonized(more than 103 CFU/ml and no clinical sign) and 9 were infected ( more than 103 CFU/ml with clinical signs)(5.1% of catheters Conclusion: There is no clear evidence of benefit of this formulation of immunonutrition over that of an isocaloric, isonitrogenous placebo feed. This may reflect the difficulty of showing any difference in mortality from modification of nutritional formulations in such a critically ill group of patients.

In a recent study [2] , no significantly cardiovascular differences were found among supine and lateral positions in haemodynamically stable patients. We studied the haemodynamic effects of the continuous lateral rotation (Kinetic Therapy) in critically ill patients, t~quiring vasopressor therapy. Methods: Because of respiratory failure, 4 patients (mean APACHE-II:21) were ventilated (FIO2>0.5, PEEP>8 tabor) and placed in the Rotorest R Kinetic Treatment Table sm (KCI Mediscus). All patients had a femoral artery and pulmonary artery catheter (Baxter-Edwards) and needed vasopressor infusion (dopamine and dobutamine > 7 [ag/kg/min). We changed the patient's position from supine to left-dependend (LDP) and right-dependend (RDP) position (60 \u00b0) and measured intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV) by thenne-dye-method [3] , cardiac index (CI, thennodilution), heart rate (HR) and mean arterial (MAP) pressure, The mean values of 3 measurements were registered.

Measurement of cardiac output (CO) using a Swan-Ganz catheter is still time consuming and of possible hazard for the patient. Thus an uncomplicated method of monitoring CO would be of benefit for the critieaI ill patient. We developed a new method for CO detection which requires a central venous injection of a cold water bolus and a peripheral arterial detection of the thermodihitiou curve. For this purpose we introduced a 1.5 F artery thermodilutioe probe (PV2021) of the PULSION Inc. Munich/Germany into the radial artery. The measurements and signal analysis were performed by the COLD Z-021 system oftbe same company [1] . Several improvements of the conventional detection algorithms were necessary to calculate cardiac output from the obtained peripheral signal. So a better compensation of the baseline drift, an improvement of the signal/noise ratio, and a multiple regression analysis of the thermal dilution slope were suppleraanted before the common integration of the temperature signal. As a reference a Swan-Ganz catheter (Edwards Swan Ganz, Baxter Healthcare Corp.) was introduced into the pulmonary artery and cardiac output was obtained simultaneously with the thermodilution method in usual manner. The relationship between pulmonary and radial artery thermal dilution CO was investigated in i4 patients of our SICU with septicemia. About 150 measurements of CO with different probe sizes were undcrtaken in a range of 4.0 up to 15 L/rain. The results show a good linear regression of the CO values for a 10 ml probe with a temperature below 16 \u00b0C (r=0,978). The algorithm was good enough to detect a deficient signal/nolse ratio or a baseline drift. So a measurement was rather rejected than was a fault value calculated.",

Introdnefion : Gastrointestinal muensa is known to be early affected in shock, leading to an increase in intestinal permeability. This is one of the pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of bacterial tranalocation. The aims of this prospective study were : (i) to describe the evolation of gastric intramucosal pH (pHi) (ii) to evaluate the incidence, pattern and clinical importence of endotoxemia (ET) in septic shock (iii) to determine the association between pHi and systemic ET. Methods: All patients with newly diagnosed sepsis were included within the 24 hours of the onset of the shock (ACCP-SCCM Consensus Conference, 1992) . They underwent at 8 houri3, intervals for 3 days phi measurements ~RIP NGS, Tonomelrics, Inc.) and serial endo~oxin determinations (Kinetic-QCD'BIO-WHITTAKER). The lower limit of detection was 0.05 Endotoxin UniVml (EU/ml). ICU support included broad-spectrum anbltiotics, optimal fluid loading, vasoacfive drugs and mechanical ventilation. The relationship between pHi and ET was studied by analysis of variance followed by multiple comparison procedures. Results : Population : eighteen patients were included (16 M, 2 F), mean age = 64.2. Ten died (D group} and g sorvi','ed (S gavup). Overall, six pmients had a gram negative bacteria (ONB) documented shock : One aspiration pneumonia in the S group, two peritonitis and three pneumonias in the D group. There was no significant difference between both group regarding the age or the Apache II score (28.2 vs 25.8), I~Hi ; on inclusion, mean pHi was 7,27 in both groups, On each measurement time, phi values nearly reached 7.30 in the S group. On the other hand in the D group it decreased to 7.20 after the first ten hours following the inclusion. As previously reported, this drop preceded the first death. Meen values were 7,24 -+ 0.02 in the D group and 730 _+ 0.01 in the S group. Endotoxemia : ET w~s found in 10 patients, there was no difference between both groups for ET, expressed quantitatively or in totals of the overall percentage of positive determinations (20.6 % in the S group vs 23.3 % in the D group). The mean endotoxin concentrations were 21.45 EU/ml in the S group (range : 0.12 -679.5) and 0.78 EU/ml in the D group (range : 0.20 -24.8). Above all, 40 % of mu clinically diagnosed cases of septic shock with detectable ET did not have GNB -related sepsis. O vg~al,I there was no pHi difference between the ET positive and the ET -free patients, whether the outcome was death or recovery. Conelnalons : l) ET was found even in the absence of documented GNB infection during confirmed septic shock. The same results were previously reported by\" several authors (DAN~'gER el al., Chest, 199 I and CASEY et al., Ann.Int.Med., 1993) 2) El\" was not associated with an increased mortality in this study. 3) Antibiotic-induced release of ET should probably be discussed. 4) There was no clearly proved relationship between gut ischemia, reflected by tonometry, and serial ET determinations. However, extravascular sources of endotoxin such as the gastrointestinal tract may be important in causing detectable ET in some patients.",

As well endotoxemia, IL-6 release and consecutive acute phase reaction are observed as a host response to surgical trauma. We therefore focused on the effect of PG and TX liberated following MT on the induction of endotoxemJa. Methods: In a prospective, randomized double-blinded protocol 50 patients, who were scheduled for major abdominal surgery (pancreatic or infrarenal abdominal surgery), were studied, lbuprofen (400 mg i.v.) or a placebo equivalent was administered 15 minutes before skin incision. MT was applied in a uniform fashion. Baseline values were obtained before induction of anesthesia. Further measurements followed before the incision of the peritoneum (el) and 5, 30, 90, 180 rain, 6h and 24h after MT (t2-7). The plasma concentrations (pc) of 6-keto-PGF~, TXB~ andKI~-PGE 2 (stable metabolites of PGIz, TXA 2 and PGEz) were determined by RIA. We measured Endotoxin pc by Limulus-amoeboeyte-tysate test and IL-6 levels by ELISA. Data are given as mean+SEM (* p< 0.05 placebo vs. [ibupmfen] ). Results: Endotoxin plasma levels increased before incision of the peritoneum tl both in the ibuprofen pretreated and in the placebo group. Peak pc were observed 180 minutes after MT. Endotoxin pc we.re significantly higher in the ibuprofen treated group (t5 0.16\u00b10.02\"[0.32\u00b10.06] EU/mI). IL-6 pc demonstrated an increase continuously from t4 to t7 (t7 115___ 12 [91 + 15] ng/l) in both groups, After intentional abdominal mesenteric traction we observed a marked increase of 6-keto-PGF~ pc up to 6h after MT in untreated patients with a peak of 2450\" [60] ng/l at tl. Also TXB2 and KHzPGE2 pc showed a considerabe increase up to 6h after MT in the placebo group. In ibupmfen pretreated patients the PG and TX pc remained within the normal range. Conclusion: Our data clearly indicate a significant endotoxemia and IL~ release following major surgical trauma which is not initiated either by prostaglandin or thromboxane release. Moreover endotoxemia is accentuated by ibuprofen pretreatment. Therefore we hypothesize that in major abdominal surgery prostacyclin release after MT may play a crucial physiological role in maintaining local organ blood flow (e.g., splanehnie microeireulation).

Lamy 1 Fifty intensive care patients with documented infections were studied as soon as they presented signs of the sepsis syndrome defined by Bone (1992) . 23 Patients met the criteria of severe sepsis and 27, those of septic shock. Among the septic shock patients, 9 were in refractory septic shock with the following sings : hypo or hyperthermia, tachycardia, taehypnea, oliguda, hypoxemia (PaO~/FiO 2 < 200), lactacidemia > 4 mmoles/I, profound hypotension not responsive to vasoaetive drugs including norepinephrine; aII but one of these patients were transiently leucopenic (< 4,000 WBC/mm 3) and all had signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Highest vaIues of all the cytokines were found in group 3, and these were significantly different from the values of the two other groups. Groups and 2 were different from each other only by their TNF, level ( 000) was particularly interesting to observe that TNF,, tL G, IL a and LIF levels were correlated with each other and with early events such as lactacidemia, presence of shock, DIC and with Apache II score. Bacteremie patients (n=19) had significantly higher levels of TNFo, IL e, LIF but not of ILa. However only ILs correlated well with the occurence of severe hypoxia (PaO2/FiO2 < 100) or renal insufficency only; UF and IL s were related to mortality. Conclusion : 1, Septic shock and severe sepsis differ mainly by the presence of a subgroup of patients with very high levels of all the cytokines measured. 2. It is interesting to find correMtions between bioclinical \"events\" and serum levels of these molecules, despite their extremely short half-lives.

Dept Although dobutamine (DOB) is often used to increase whole body (WB) oxygen delivery (DO2) in sepsis, the effects of this agent on regional blood flow have not been well defined. We thus studied the effects of DOB during endotoxic shock in 15 pentobarbital-anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs. After splenectomy, ultrasonic flow probes (Transonic) were placed around the superior mesenteric (M), left renal (R) and femoral (F) arteries. A pulmonary artery (PA) catheter and an arterial line were inserted. Gastric intramucosal pH (pHi) was also determined (Tonometrics). Oxygen uptake (V02) was determined from expiratory gas analysis. Thirty min after administration of endotoxin 2 mg/kg, saline was infused to maintain the PA wedge pressure around i0 mmHg. For the next 2 hours, the dogs were randomly assigned to receive fluids only (n:5) or together with DOB at 5 #g/kg/min (n=5) or I0 #g/kg/min (n=5). Analysis of variance for repeated measurements was performed with Dost-hoc Neumann-Keuls adjustment. Introduction: In sepsis and Al~bS a mismatch between tissue peffusion and cellular requixements has been widely reported. Skeletal muscle presents a vast microvascular network that can play an important role in deterraming the VO2-DO 2 dependence shown in different pathological conditions. Recently a simple method for the simultaneous measurements of forearm blood flow and oxygen consumption (FVO2) has been realisod by near infrared spectroscopy (NIP, N), The purpose of this study is to evaluate the DO2-VO 2 relationship en skeletal muscle in critically ill patients compared to the that observed on total body. Methods: The study was performed on 8 consecutive patients meeting the entrance criteria for sepsis. Five non septic critically ill patients were studied as controls, All patients required inotropic end/ur vasepreasor agents. NIRS measurements were obtained using the NTRO500 (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). Quantification of Hb and HbO 2 changes was obtained by using the pathlength values measured separately. Systemic and forearm blood flow changes were obtained by varying the depamine infusion in a range from 3 to 10 tagKg'lmin \"1. Hemedynamic and oxygen derived values were obtained at the different dopamine infusiozas. For all patients systemic DO2(ml'min-l'm-2 ) and forearm DO 2 (FDO2: ml'min \"1-100ml \"1) were compared to the corresponding measurements nfVO 2 and FVO 2. Resnlts: The FDO2-FVO 2 relationship for each single subject is shown in the figure. Although intended as a measure of medical consumption, the TISS (Therapeutic Intervention String System -Cullen, 1974) is also used as an indicator of: (1) the patient's severity of illness; (2) the nurses' workload. However, little research has been carried out on the latter. This study that includes 18 Dutch ICU's tested the assumption that an experienced nurse is capable of delivering work equivalent to 40 to 50 TISSpoints per 8 hrs. shift (Reis Miranda, 1990) . The shortened 28-item version of the TISS (Reis Miranda, 1993) was used in this study. The time nurses spend on various tasks (e.g. primary care. secondary care, personal hygiene) was estimatedby employing a pamcular sampling method; the so called 'Multi Moment Recording' (MMR) technique. It appeared that IC-nurses collected slightly less than 40 TlSS-points per shift. Moreover, the pattern of time spend on the various tasks seemed to differ between shifts and between different TISS-levels. Previsional findings of the increase in percentage time spend on primary care in the day-shift are shown below. K.Dttmon, W Gross-Weege, S. Buscher, C Ohmann, H. Becker lntrodaetion: Because of the increasing complexity of patient presanlation,it has been recently suggested by the ACCP/SCCM to combine the use of new terminology such as systemic inflammatory response syndrom (SIRS) and multiple organ dysfimclion sydrom (MODS) with risk stratification or probability risk estimation techniques in order to measure the position of an individual patient along the continuum of severity. Methods: In order to do this, we designed a structural and easy-to-use computer program which allows simultaneous bedside assessment of the following available scores and definitions: SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, organ dysfimction (ODIN), MOF, APACHEII, APACHEIII, SAPS, APS, MPM, By using the Kruskal-Waltis 1-way analysis of variance test with survival as the grouping variable, survivors and nonsurvivors were compared for admission values.",

Aims: To evaluate the risk factors for CRT in ICU patients and to establish the relationship between CRT ans CRS. Methods: A prospective multicenter study was performed during a 18 monthperiod in three ICUs. CRT of subclavian or internal jugular vein was explored by duplex-scanning (Ultramark 9 \u00ae, probe 7.5 Mhz) performed just before or at the first 24 hours after catheter removal. Quantitative cultures were performed (Brun-Buisson Arch Int Mad 87) and CRS was defined as previously published definition (Farkas Am J Med 93). Results: 242 patients were incIuded. 54 were excluded: 3 catheter duration < 48h, 9 catheters without culture, 16 deaths before duplex~scanning, 26 duplex-scanning not available (n=24) or not contributive (n=2). 188 patients were therefore available for analysis, mean age 64+15 years, SAPS 12_+5, OSF 1_+1, mean duration of catheterization 9i-_5 days. 44 patients (23%) had a culture _>1000 cfu/ml. 20 patients (11%) had a CRS (11 bacteremic). 57 patients (30%) had a CRT at duplex-scanning. 11 of the 20 patients with CRS had CRT (55%) whereas 46 of the 168 patients without CRS had CRT (29%). Using ANOVA, CRT was associated with CRS (OR 3.24, 95% CI 2.92-3.60, p=0.01) as well as positive quantitative catheter culture (p=0.02), jugular (vs subclavian) route (p< 10 -4) and the absence of curative anticoagulation ~=0.03). CRT was not associated with severity scores, duration of catheterization, and hemostasis parameters. CRS remained a risk factor for CRT using multivariate analysis (p=0.04). Conclusion: Catheter-related thrombosis is a frequent complication of centrai venous catheterization (30%), and increases the risk of catheter-related sepsis in ICU patients. RESULTS: Hemodynamie responses (including an increase in left ventrieular stroke index-LVSWl) were similar for all groups, but cardiac index (CI) increased significantly more in group HES 10%.

INTRODUCTION: Adherence of leukocytes to endothelium is a crucial event in inflammatory processes in the pathophysiology of septic shock. This pilot study evaluated the safety and tolerability of CY-1787, a monoclonal murine antibody against human E-selectin in septic shock. METHODS: Septic shock was defined by abnormal temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and white blood count, positive blood cultures or documented source of infection, and hypotension requiring use of vasopressors within 6 hours. Eleven patients were enrolled but 2 patients who died during the first 24 hours were excluded. CY-1787 was administered as a single IV bolus at doses of 0.1 (n=3), 0.33 (n=3), and ] mg/kg (n=3). B~SULTS: CY-1787 was well tolerated. None of the 9 patients died during the 28 days follow-up.

Thus SAPS score of greater than 20, the dysfunction more than three of organ systems, persistent leucopenia, resistant malignancy to chemotherapy all point to a poor outcome.

HELLP syndrome, thrombotic thromboeytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) share common pathnphysiological mechanisms like thrombotic microangiopathy, consecutive hemolysis and imbalance of prostaeyelin metabolism. Therefore, it seems reasonable to treat complicated HELLP syndromes with methods successful in TTP and HUS, Plasmapheresis -originally introduced in the treatment of TTP and HUShas been established in the therapy of HELLP. Prostacyclin infusions are successful in TTP and HUS; but there is littfe experience in the therapy of HELLP, We report about an extreme severe case of HELLP syndrome with multi-organfailure (MOF) including necrotizing pancreatitis and successful treatment with plasmapheresis and prostacyctin infusions. Case report: A 24-year-old woman presented in the 361h week of her firm pregnancy complaining of dark urine, leg swelling and right abdominal pain. Clinical examination revealed jaundice of the sclere, generalized edema and blood pressure of 170/120 mm Hg, Laboratory assays showed the typical constellation of HELLP with hemolysis (bilirubin 3,9 mg/dl; LDH 983 U/I; hemoglobin (Hb) 11,4 g/dl), elevated liver enzymes (GOT 227 U/t; GPT 184 U/I) and low platelets (39 O00lgt), despite of cesarean section clinical condition and laboratory values worsened, The patient deve]opped severe MOF with respiratory, renal and circulatory insufficiency, requiring meehanieat ventilation, dialysis and catecholamines. Additfanally, ultrasound and CT showed necrotizing pancreatitis which is mentioned as complication of TTP and HUS, but -so far , not of HELLP syndrome, in parallel the HELLP specific laboratory values worsened: bilirubin 8,2 gtdl; LDH 6220 U/I; platelets 22 O00/~l. Complicated HELLP syndrome was diagnosed and a therapy with daily plasmapheresis (exchange of 2 I of plasma against 1 t FFP and 1 I human albumine 5%) and continuous prostacyclin infusions (5 ng/kg x min) was started. After 6 days LDH, bilirubin and GOT were reduced to 1376 U/I, 1,9 mg/dl and 32 U/I, respectively, These values were in the normal range after an addRional week (excepted a mild elevation of LDH to 332 U/I). Platelets raised up to 487 000gl. Conclusions: 1.) Promacyelin infusions may be an improvement of plasmapheresis in the therapy ef complicated HELLP syndrome with two wellcome \"side-effects\": Inhibition of platelet aggregation with regard to extracorporal circulation and antlhypertensive effect with regard to hypertensive gestation. 2.)

Introduction: With the increasing demands of contemporary intensive care medicine the traditional handwritten record has become woefully inadequate. New methods of data acquisition and data processing have to be employed to keep track of the current flood of data on the ICU, Methods: In June 1992 a commercially available, unix-based PDMS was installed on a 16-bed surgical ICU. The goal was a paperless documentation at the bedside. After 2 years clinical experience with the system two aspects were investigated: (a) Does the PDMS improve quality of treatment and care, and (b) is the PDMS cost-efficient? Results: The current implementation of the PDMS contains all parts of the patient record, including kardex, medication orders and plans of care, so that documentation is paperless at the bedside. 100% readability, automatic data transfer and calculations reduce the probability of errors. Documentation is more precise and more comprehensive; now an average of 350 out of 1000 available parameters are documented compared to a maximum of 140 parameters in the handwritten documentation. Statistical and retrieval functions facilitate an improved presentation of complex medical records and a rapid access to specific data. Automatic calculations, especially intake/output, and automatic data transfer result in time savings of up to 45 minutes per day per patient. Plan of Care and medication flowsheets provide standards for treatment and care, and provide the basis for consistent quality control. These tools also allow a more efficient use of the expensive resources of the ICU. On-line cost calculations for drugs and infusions are integrated in the I&O section. This allows accurate assessment of the effective medication costs for every individual patient. All patient data can be exported trite a secondary relational database and is available for complete accounting and for scientific research. The patient record is available at all places throughout the ICU and cannot be lost. It is also immediately available for later review and at readmission of a patient. Conclusion: Clinical information systems are commercially available and ready for clinical use on a broad scale. They can provide a major improvement in patient care and safety, without adding to the nurses' workload. Due to the increasing pressure of health care costs, expensive equipment such as CIS can only be justified if they can also be used for automatic accounting and costs analysis. Introduction, Whether the pathological O2 supply dependency is an artifact in DO2/VO2 evaluation or a real finding in the critically ill is still debated. The use of other parameters, mathematically unrelated, such as CI and O2ER computed from a-VSO2 differences, could improve the monitoring of DOs/VO2 mismatch. Methods: In 47 patients we studied the correlations (308 measurements) between DO2, VOw, CI, O2ER calculated with standard formula and with the a-VOs saturaticm (O2ERs), and their behavinttr before and after hemodynamic support (4\"1 comparisons). Results,' The C~ER and O2ERs were statistically different (t-Student test, p< 0.001). The percents of improvement, after support, of both CI and DOs were highly correlated 0inear regression: r \u20220.925, p<0.001). Conversely a low correlation of the percents of variation between CI and O2ERs (r = -0.390, p<0.02), DOs and VOs (r =0.417, p<0.01) and between VOs and O2ERs (r --0.526, p<0.01) was found.

Overall bed occupancy rates in the two ICUs were similar (63.8% vs 68.8%, ns) but at time of discharge for patients who died on the ward or who later needed ICU readmission, ICU bed occupancy rate >75% was significantly greater in ICU 1. Patients who died in the ward were significantly older, were more likely to have been ventilated and had spent longer in the ICU.

I Patients and methods : 22 patients with septic shock were included. We measured PMNzlastase (Y : 22 -+ l0 ggf!) and od-Pl (N : 1,9 a 3.5 g/l) daily for 4 days and on the 6th and 10th day. 3 groups of patients were determined : 1, receiving AT III concentrates (100 UI//Kg/d) during 4 days; 2, receiving placebo; 3, receiving one injection (100 rag) of HA-1A.

In this study the sptanchnic blood flow after open heart surgery was estimated by two different methods, measurement of hepatosplaechnic oxygen ~traction ratio (OERspl) and gastric lntramucosal pH(pHi). PATIENTS ~,tld METtIODS:The day before surgery intravenous catheter was inserted into the right hepatic vein in 22 patients including AVR, MVR, DVR and CABG. The pulmonary artery catheter was inserted in the operating room after induction of anesthesia. TRIP NGS catheter(Tonometrics, Inc.) was inserted into the stomach on admission to ICU. Hemodynamic data, blood gas analysis and oximetry data were taken at 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours after admission. Systemic and hepatosplanchnic oxygen extraction ratio, OERsys and OERspl, were calculated by the oximetry data. OERsys = (CaO2 -CvO2)/CaO2, OERspl ~ (CaO2-ChvO2)/CaO2 RESULTS;At 3 hours after admission, pHi was 7.237+/-0.02 and OERspt was 0.38+/-O.12. phi decreased further to 7.212+/-0.07 and OERspt increased to O.49+/-0.12 at 6 hours. They gradually restored to the fiormal level at 12 hours and reached 7.349+/-0.07 and 0.41+/-0.10 at 24 hours respectively.Throughout the study cardiac index was over 4L/rain/m2 mid OERsys was between O.23 and 0.26 which indicated that the systemic DO2/VO2 balance was maintained within the normal range during the study period. CONCLUSION:Low phi and high OERspl immediately after open heart surgery shewed that oxygen delivery to the visceral organs was inadequate for oxygen consumption. OERspl and pHi were restored to the normal level in 24hours. This study demonstrated that it takes 24 hours to restore normal blood flow to the splanchntc organs after open heart surgery. The changes of OERspl and pHi were similar. We conclude that pHi reflects the splanchntc DO2/VO2 balance.",

The patients studied ( mean hospital stay 18+-2) fell into two groups: with uncomplicated attacks ( n=20, groupt ) and with complicated attacks of AP ( n = 9, group2 ). Death occured in one attack at day 5. L1-AT, L2-MG and CRP serum levels were measured daily ( until day 9 ) by laser nephelemetty. AP I1 score profiles were available at admission and daily thereaffer. Our results showed a significant ( p less than 0.01 ) difference in the serum values for both antiproteases and CRP between the two groups. Consumption of L2-MG and the subsequantly significant decrease in the serum leveis correlates with the course of AP ( cut-off level of 1.2g/I ). L1 -AT values were significantly higher for the group 2 after day 4 ( cut-off level of 4.3g/I ). CRP-levels increased several fold and persist for longer in complicated attacks, thus providing the best discrimination of all the factors investigated between the two patients groups ( a cut-off level above 150g/I identifies a group of patients with severe pancreatitis ). AP II score profiles revealed significant discrimination between mild and severe groups, providing accurate identification ( mean vNue above 16 ) of major organ system failure and/or pancreatic collections at early stage of the disease -48/72h. We found a good positive relation between the peak CRP levels and the highest AP[I values\u2022 We conclude that: A.Both the reactants studied and APII score-profiles provide a useful clinical information for objectivation of the severity of an attack in AP. But they cannot permit specific identification of the concrete complicating factor, resp. they are not able to differentiate infected from sterile pancreatic tissue. B.The individual measurement of the factors tested appeared to limit their clinical value. Every parameter assessed is essential component of the overall monitoring of such patients C.The complex daily assessment ( incl. CRP, antiproteases, APII ) versus sequential monitoring appear to be of greater clinical value in the patient at risk-selection for investigation by expensive imaging techniques or for a ICU-treatment. On the basis of such complex approach the thera peutic strategy can be planned in a precise manner. Introduction: Early operative drainge has been shown to be associated with increased mortality in mild pancreatitis. However, early removal of toxic substances present in the peritoneal exsudate may result in decreased morbidity and mortality in patients with severe pancreatitis. Patients and Methods: 26 consecutive patients with severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis admitted to our ICU during the period 1991-1992 have been evaluated retrospectively. The diagnosis of pancreatitis was based on the clinical presentation, CT-and ultrasound findings, All patients had severe pancreatitJs (grade Ill) confirmed by CT-scan (grade D/E). Ranson's criteria and a MOF-score were recorded. Surgical procedures including laparotomy, peritoneal drainage and lavage were performed immediately after diagnosis. All patients were managed with continous peritoneal lavage in the ICU. Results: All patients had >-3 positive early prognostic Ranson signs. In 16 patients the operation was performed within the first week after onset of pancreatitis (early intervention). In 10 patients operation was done after day 7 (delayed intervention). Of the 26 patients evaluated, 12 patients died and an additional 8 patients required more than 2 weeks of treatment in the ICU. Independent from the time period of the operation, all patients with only 3 early prognostic signs survived. The incidence of multiple organ failure was high in both groups of patients. There could not be found any difference in morbidity and mortality in patients with eady and delayed surgical intervention (table) . Table: OP < day7 (n=16~ OP > day 7 (n=10) >3 + Ranson's signs 10 7 MOF 12 6 non surviver 8 4 surviver 8 6 surviver;> 2 weeks ICU 4 4 Discussion: Pancreatic digestive enzymes become activated intracellulady and are released locally and systemically\u2022 The removal of locally released activated pancreatic enzymes may be associated with less marked biochemical disturbances. However, we could not demonstrate any difference in the course of illness with early operative drainage and lavage in patients with very severe necrotizing pancreatitis. Once triggered by pancreatitis, the exposure of the necrotic tissue to bacterial contamination may possibly maintain ongoing MOF. In accordance with previous reports the present small study does not suggest a benefical effect of early surgical intervention.

            "text": "All Septic shock is one of the most frequent cause of death in neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies after chemotherapy. We analyzed the disturbances of blood coagulation in 31 neutropenic patients with septic shock (white blood cells < 0,5x109/1). During our research of hemostasis we discovered rough abnormalities characteristic for Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIe). DIC was diagnosed by the criteria established by clinical symptoms and laboratory data. 74 % patients had a hemorrhagic syndrome. All patients had multiple organ failure. Significant promotion of soluble fibrin monomer level (more than 0,1 g/l) was noted in 70% patients. Prothrombin time was prolonged in 80% and antithrombin ffI was decreased in 60% patients. All patients had significant depression of fibrinolysis. Deep thrombocytopenia was in all causes and was closely related not only to depression of haemopoesis but also to consumption coagulopathy. The common principles of the DIC treatment in the neutropenic patients with septic shock included: replacement of thrombocytes; fresh frozen plasma transfusions; synthetic protease inhibitors. We noted a positive dynamics of coagulogical figures in survivors. We suggest that the DIC plays the important role in the genesis of multiple organ failure and haemorrhagic syndrome in neutropenic patients with septic shock. Introduction: Albumin is considered to be the optimal colloid solution for expansion of the intravaseular compartment. However, albumin crosses the capillary basement membrane to a significant degree even in the normal subject [1] . Acutely ill patients frequently develop \"leaky capillury syndrome\" and it is assumed increase the volume of their extraoellular space. An intravenous bolus of albumin can be used to measure the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) of albumin which may increase in the critically ill. We set out to determine whether the Vd of atbttmm correlates with two recognised markers of sevetib, of illness, the APACHE//score and the sepsis score of Eiebute and Stoner [2] . Methods: 34 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit were given an intravenous bolus of 20Oral of 20% Hmnan Albumin Solution (4% of albumin). Plasma albumin levels were measured before, lwo hours and four hours after bolus administration. The Vd of albumin was determined for each patient at two and four hours from the formula Vd=bolus/rise in serum albumin. APACHE lI and sepsis scores were recorded for the same day. Results: Patients aged 3%g3 (mea n 68 years), with APACHE II scores of 3-30 (mean 16) and sepsis scores of 6-21 (mean 14) were investigated. The mean Vd was 6.0 litres at two hours and 6.7 litres at four hours. The correlation of Vd at two hours with sepsis and APACHE scores is shown below. Conclusion: The Vd of albumin in septic patients is markedly greater than the plasma volume. There is poor correlation between the APACHE ]I or sepsis score and the apparent volume of distribution. This may indicate that the change in Vd is not related to severity of illness as measured by these scores or more probably that these global scores are inappropriate to the measurement of this particular problem. An increase in cardiac output and sepsis must mean an increase in venou~ return which is determined by stressed vascular volume, venous compliance (Cv), venous resistance (Rv) and right atrial pressure (Pra): as well as cardiac function which is determined by preload, contractilit~ and afterload. To determine the relative importance of each, we studied pigs anesthetized with Na thiopentol and mechanically ventilated. Plasma volume was measured with Evans Blue and blood volume from 1/hct t Mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) was obtained by transientl~ stopping venous return by inflating a balloon in the right atrium. CV was l obtained by rapidly infusing 5 ml/kg then 10 ml/kg of dextran. Rv wa~ calculated from (MSFP-Pra)/Q. Endotoxemia was produced by infusin~ 10 lag/kg/hr of E coli endotoxin. Two protocols were followed: (a) flui~ was infused to maintain CVP constant; (b) no fluid was administered. Ir~ (a) the initial Q was 4.2 +_ .5 L/min, blood pressure (BP) 117 +-I(1 mmHg, Pra 5.3 -+ 0.5 mmHg and MSFP was 10.4 ---1.2 mmHg. After hours of endotoxin, Q increased to 5.3 + 0.9, BP fetl to 73 -+ 12, Pra wa~ 6.9 + 1.1 and MSFP increased to 13.3 -+ 1.7 mmHg. There was only small change in heart rate from I27 + 13 to 139 + 9 b/min. Vascula~ capacitance increased so that MSFP increased due to the infusion used tc~ maintain Pra. Rv and Cv did not change significantly and cardiac functi0r~ improved. In group 2, Q fell from 3.8 +-.6 to 2.2 -+ .4, BP from 115 -+[ tl to 56 -. 12, Pra did not change and MSFP increased from 9.9 4-1.1 tq 10.6 -+ 1.3. The Rv increased and cardiac function decreased, presumablg~ due to the rise in pulmonary artery pressure from 19 -2 to 34 + .~ mmHg. The response in group 2 was most likely due to sympatheti~ discharge as the heart rate increased from t39 -+-16 to 194 +-23. In I conclusion, volume infusion decreased the sympathetic response inducec~ by hypotension and allows the observation of generalized decrease ir~ vascular tone in sepsis. The nosocomtal pneumonia following esophageal resection is coraplicated with a high incidence because of dysphagia and regurgitation of contaminated contents from the reconstructed esophagus. This study is designed to evaluate clinically the effect of diluted HCL solutionId-HCL:pH2) on the colonization of organisms in the reconstructed esophagus with colon. llethods:ln control group ( 6 patients ), the patients were treated with the conventional mouth care every 6 hours with povidone iodine gargte and suction of the reconstructed esophagus lumen through the drainage tube. in treated group (6 patients), the patients were treated with 60~100 ml of d-HCL injection every 6 hours into the esophagus. Specimen s for the cultures were obtained through the drainage tube every morning just before the d-HCL injection or mouth care. Results: In control group, the species of organisms was increased in number, on 4th-PO0 over three different species were detected with high concentration. In treated group, however, the number and concentration of detected organisms were decreased rapidly, on 4th-POD only one species with very !ow concentration was detected in one patient. Conclusions: It has been recognized that pil under 4 has the suppressive or bactericidal effect on both bacteria and fungus. On preventing nosocomial pneumonia after esophageal resection, the injection of d-HCL solution (pH2) into the reco,sttuctad esophagus was a useful strategy to suppress the colonization o+ organisms without the induction of antibiotics-resistant strains and the toxic side e{fect agaist hepatic and renal function.",

METHODS -This work is a prospective, non-intervention study, in which we analyse 25 critically ill patients, who entered ICU in consequence of various pathologies. All patients presented high SAPS values on admission (~ 10); they were studied using Swan-Ganz pulmonary catheter and gastric tonommter. In this study, we considered the \" first pHi value (fpHi) \" and systemic variables as the means of the first 12 hours' parameters. The first values are the means of five data. The statistical analysis be.tw~a'z sur~vors and non-smvivoPs was performed using unpaired t-fast; chi-square test allowed to study differences in mo~Jity rate and f~equancy of sepsis. RESULTS -The follo~'h'.g ~athieu D, Neviere R, Chagnon JL, Millien JPL Wattel F. Introduction : Microvascular reactivity to hypoxia is attenuated in sepsis as evidenced by a diminution of reactive hyperemia (RH). The extra-blood flow during RH phase is a physiologic response of tissue ~icrocirculation that emphasizes the close connection between local blood flow regulation and delivery of nutrients to tissue and has been related to the capillary density regulation within tissue. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis whether or not RH is related to tissue oxygen avaibility. Methods : In a prospective study including 16 patients meeting the criteria of severe sepsis, we measured hemodynamics, 02 transport variables and basal skeletal muscle microvascular blood flow (MBF). MBF ~nd blood flow during reactive hyperemia (MBF-RH) were analyzed by continuous laser Doppler flo~n~etry (Periflux FP3, Perimed, Sweden). Reactive hyperemia, exploring microvascular reactivity to hypoxia was elicited by a 3 minute ischemia stimulus. Measurements were obtained before and repeatedly at the end of a l-hr period infusion of dobutamine (10~g/Kg/min) or fluid loading (500 ml of 4 ~ human serum albumin in 0.9 NaCl). Results are expressed mean C SD. Statistical analysis included ~NOVA, paired t-test and linear correlation. * indicates p<O.05 Results : 02 transport variables and microvascular blood flow data are resumed in Table A~l ,~or:~ LL Noe*, JP Pribbte*, H Levy, SM Opal, RA Balk, CJ Fisher, JF Dhainaut, BS Bloom, SL Barriere*, GS Gordon*, and thej~L-I ra Sepsis Syndrome Study Group lntroduetlon: New treatments for sepsis have the potential to reduce mortality and affect 3ospital resources used to care for patients.

We report resource efficiency with major procedures (MP) and mechanical ventilation days (MV) from a clinical trial of anakinra. Methods: The use of MP and MV days were prospectively collected from a 2g-day, phase lll clinical trial comparing placebo and anakinra for the treatment of sepsis patients. Two groups of patients were examined: 1) 370 patients with -> 10D at study entry, 2) 388 patients with a PRM _> 24%. In each group, patients received either placebo or anakinra 2.0 mg/kg/hr, in addition to standard sepsis treatment.

Further study are necessary to evaluate the ability of high serum IL6-1evels to predict a severe course in septic burn pts. Prutactine (PRL) has recently been suspected to be one of the modulating factor of the immunity in sepsis (*). We have studied the influence of low dose dopamine (DOPA) on PRL secretion. DOPA is a commonly drug in ICU patients (pts), used at low dose to perform a better renal and splanchnie perfusion. 20/CU pts were randomised after elective non complicated abdominal surgery; group I (10 pts -mean age 67_+9) (Dupa+) received low dose DOPA (continuous IV administration: 2mcg/kg/min) and group II (controll-10pts -mean age 73.8_+8) (Dopa-) were perfnsed with saline solution. These patients were surveyed from day 1 to day 4 after surgeD'; significant cardiac or pulmonary past history Justified the ICU admission. Determination of the PRL serum concentration as well as clinical and laboratory parameters related to sepsis (T \u00b0, WBC, CRP, llbrinogen .,.) was performed daily for 4 days. A statistical analysis (Wilcoxon test) demonstrated a significant higher PRL level in Group 1I (Dopa-) compared to Group I (Dopa+) (p <0.05) from day 1 to day 4 after surgery. Severe sepsis may produce dramatic endocrine dysfonction. 30 patients (Pts) with septic shock and need of increasing doses of cathecolamines were studied. Plasma cortisol pattern was compared to the severity of illness assessed by Apache II score, organ system failure score (OSF), cathecolamines doses and mortality. Plasma conisol was determined before, 30 and 60 miinutes after 0.25 mg of synthetic ACTH (Synacthen~). Pts were divided with regard to baseline cortisol (normal <600nM/L and high >600nM/L) and their response in plasma cortisol after ACTH (responder>200nM/L); non responder (<200nM/L). Mean values + SD of the ~aremeters studied are reported in Oxygen supply dependency has been described in patients with ALF. N-Acetylcystein (NAC) is demonstrated to increase VO2 and EO2r in these patients (pts). In 14 pts with ALF (age:48_+14, Apache II:17+7.6, Encephalopathy:3.3+0.7, Factor V:20.5+9.3%), VO2]IX)2 relationship has been studied by oxygen flax test using volume loading (VL). Before (TO) and after (T1) VL, DO2 (Thermodilution), VO2 (indirect calorimetry), EO2r (%) and Lactate (L) were determined (Table I ). In 7 pts, the same parameters were studied before and after NAC (150 mg/kg/l 5') and in 6 pts, astric intramucosal pH (pHi) was determined (Table 2) . Hyperlactacidemia in septic shock (SS) is considered as a marker of inadequate tissue oxygenation. In the presence of oxygen debt, Lactate/Pyruvate ratio (L/P) is expected to be increased and >10. In 9 patients (age:69_+12, Apache 1I:23.7+8.7) with S.S. and high blood lactate, VO2]DO2 relationship was studied in order to demask oxygen supply dependency and was compared to L/P. Pts were divided in 2 Groups (G) regarding the clinical control of the shock (S). GI (n=4pts.lO rues.) controlled shack(S), GII (n=Epts, 16 rues.) uncontrolled S, despite volume loading and cathecolamines. All patients survived in GI and only 1 in GtI. Before (TO) and after (T1) volume loading, DO2 (thermodilntion), VO2 (indirect cNorimetry), EO2r, Lactate and Lactate/Pyruvate were determined in the 2 groups. L/P was mesured in 4 postoperative patients as controls (L/P:6.9+l). In both groups, VL was associated with an increase in DO2 but no significant change in VO2. EO2r was reduced. Lactate was 2.6_+0.3 vs 3.9+1.7 mmol/L in GI and II respectively (NS), L/P was 9.4+0.6 vs 13.2+2.6 in GI and II respecliveIy (1~<0.05), Lactate and L/P relation in the 3 I~oDulations is shown in Figure I , Septic chock caused inadequate splanchnic oxygenation as documented by decreased gastric intramucosal pH (pHi) which is associated with morbidity and mortality. We investigated whether infusing prostacyclin (PGI) would improve splanchnic oxygenation supply and thereby restore phi. Sixteen consecutive patients with septic shock received PGI (10 ng/kg min) for 90 minutes each after no further increase in oxygen delivery could be obtained by volume expansion, red cell transfusion and dobutamlne infusion. Oxygen uptake was measured directly in the respiratory gases, pHi was determined bytonometry; the results were compared with those before and after conventional resuscitation for 3 to 32 days.",

We evaluated the cardiac output (CO) values obtained between this new device ,'rod s \"tandard cold bolus injection (Ice) in critically ill patients. Palients and methods : All patients without supra ventricular arrhythmia and tricuspid regurgitation who require a pulmonary artery calheter (PAC) were included. The catheter was a 10 cm heated filament wrapped around a PAC, to which current is applied intermittently (Intellicath\u00ae Baxter Corporation). This catheter was connected to a monitor (Vigilance\u00ae Baxter Corporation) arid CO was continuously and automatically measured. To obtain an instantaneous value the user cart perform a standard bolus injection through the same catheter. The value of CO0 is the average of CO0 perform just before and after Ice. Ice was obtained by 5 injections of 10 ml of 5% dextrose at the temperature < 10\u00b0C. The two extremes were eliminated and the average perform on the 3 remaining values. Data were analysed with regression analysis. Bias and precision were calculated for CCO mad Ice method using the method of Bland and Altman.

Endotoxin shock in rats is characterized by a low output state, and leads to early renal insufficiency indicated by a low renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without an increase in filtration fraction (FF). In another form of shock caused by low venous return, in which RPF fell as much as in endotoxin shock, we found a compensatory rise of FF, however (van Lambalgen et aL Circ Shock 35,1991) . In the present series of experiments we have studied, histomorfometrically, whether tubular effects of both shock types also were different. One group (ES; n=9) received endotoxin (8mg/kg, infused from t=-0 to t=60 rain). In a second group (BS; n=7) a balloon (below renal vein) was inflated in the vena cava (from t=30 to t=135 min) to cause comparable decreases in CO (50-60%) and RPF (70-80%) as in ES. A third group served as time matched control group (C; n=9). At t=135 experiments ended and the kidneys were fixed by perfusion (glutaraldehyde; via the abdominal aorta) at the prevailing mean arterial pressure, imbedded in methacrylate and ll, t sections the lumen of the proximal and distal tubules, the brushborder thickness and epithelial vacuolizafion were measured, using point or line matrices in 30 adjacent cortical high power fields at a 400x magnification. At t=135 we found no differences between the groups for cross sectional area (at the level of the papilla) of the kidney (no swelling). Between the control and the \"balloon-shock\" group there were no tubular histomorfometric differences. In the ES group there was a decrease in the lumen of the proximal ( with 15% with respect to C and B; P<.05) and of the distal (with 34% and 25% with respect to C and BS, respectively; P<.05) tubular lumen and the thickness of the brush border zone had slightly but significantly incerased (by 2.5 % with respect to C and BS), but vacuolisation was not different from the other 2 groups. Endotoxemia in rats thus caused an early decrease in tubular lumen diameter, which was not due to renal hypoperfusion and could indicate the onset of tubular damage. Introduction: Reported mortality rates of surgical acute renal failure (ARF) patients treated by intermittent hemodialysis exceed 75%. The aim of this study was to assess both renal and patient outcome in patients with surgical ARF treated by CAVHD in a single surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: Records of 60 critically-ill patients with ARF treated with CAVHD in a single surgical ICU between 1 January 1986 and -31 August 1993 were reviewed. Results: Mean age (:i:SEM) was 60-a:2 yr (800 males). Eighty-three percent required mechanical ventilation (MV) and 70% vasopresser support. Mean number of organ system failures (OSF) was 3.3-+-0.2 (range 1-6) and mean APACHE score was 26.5\u00b10.5 (range 19-32). Suspected or proven sepsis was present in the majority of cases (71%). CAVHD was hemodynamically well tolerated and allowed readily reversal of any existing overhydration (up to 5 l/day). Furthermore, within 72h, steady-state urea levels <30 mmol/l were achieved in patients of wifich 72% received full parenteral nutrition. In patients with severe metabolic acidosis (HCO 3\" < 20 mmol/1, n=14), bicarbonate homeostasis was restored within 48 h. \"The increasing incidence of morbidity and mortality caused by MOfS has paralleled improvements in the life-support technologim available to patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU)\"(1).The evaluation of the effectiveness of the treatment of thls syndromecannot be possible without an accurate estimation of the pretreatment risk.Such risk estimation can also be useful in monitoring the utilizatlon of new therapies,partieula~ ly when the patient is a candidate got,or a partecipant in,a clinical tm ial.For these reasons we have analyzed the pretreatment clinical informa tion in 256 consecutive surgicat critically itl patients admitted in the ICU after surgery,to determine epidemioioglc features of the MOFS patien ts and te estimate risk factors for MOFS development. An univariate ana1~ sis was performed and the odds ratio (OD) were done. In about 20 % of the patients right ventricular dysfunction induces insufficient left ventricular assist devbe (LVAD) performance. We developed a model of severe left ventricular failure with increasing grades of right ventricular dysfunction and performed our study on 20 dogs weighing from 8 to 10 kg. In all dogs ischemic dyslunction was achieved by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) for 20 minutes and subsequently after 5 minutes of reperfusion the circumflex coronary artery (CX) for 45 minutes. The last period of ischemia was followed by a 240 minute reperfusion period. We divided the animals in four groups. Group I as a control had no left ventricular assistance, in all other groups LVAD pumping was started five minutes after CX occlusion and was continued for 90 minutes. As LVAD we used the newly developed pediatric device HIA-VAD\u00ae with 10cc pumping volume. To increase fight ventricular dysfunction in group Ill the right coronary artery (RCA) was occluded simultaneously with the CX and in group IV high pulmonary resistance was added by injection of 100~tm glass beads into the pulmonary circulation. In group t and IV the outcome was lethal In groups II and Ill all animals survived the four hour reperfusion period in stable condition. Lactate was elevated in groups II and tli after the start of reperfusbn, 1,9+0,8 mmol/I (p>0,05 versus preischemic control value of 0,9_+0,2 ) and 2,2_+1,4 (p<0,05 vs. 0,6+0,2 ), respectively. At the end of the reperfusicn period lactate was 1,2_+0.2 (p>0,05) and 1,1\u00b10,3 (p<0,05). In groups I and IV it was significantly elevated (5,8_+2 and 5,1_+1,4, respectively, p<0,01). At start of reperfusion cardiac index (CI) was lower (2_+0,3, p<0,05) than preischemic control (3,4_+0,8 I/min.m2) in group II as well as in group Ill (1,8_+0,4 vs 3, 6\u00b10,9, p<0,05) . Also at the end of the observation period CI was significantly lower with values of 2,4_+0,4 (p<0,05) in 11 and 2,1\u00b10,7 (p<0,05) in III respectively. We conclude that left ventdcular mechanical assistance with the HIA-VAD\u00ae 10cc maintains sufficient circulation and enables myocardial recovery unless high pulmonary resistance hinders LVAD performance and induces lethal LVAD low output syndrome.",

The incidence of the latter is increasing, conditioned by more virulent stems. The mechanism of infection in TSS remains vague, probably streptococci, colonizing the skin as common flora, infect wounds, originating often from banal injuries. This may render the search for a focus more difficult. Fulminant septic courses are connected with increasing pathogen subgroups of streptococci, which can be determined by their M-and Tproteins. Especially M types M1, M3 and M18 are of importance in TSS, leading to a letality of 30 -50% (1). The sheckcascade may also be induced directly by the A and B toxins or streptolysin O, originating from streptococci. Until now, there are only few reports of septic courses after streptococci infections. Therefore, we demonstrate the case of a 28 year old male patient, who was transferred to our ICU in septic shock along with acute renal failure and ARDS. The cause for this TSS was an inconspicuous wound after a trifling trauma, leading to a necrotizing fasciltis of the right arm. Only by aggressive surgical proceedings, including amputation of the right arm and extensive dermatofasciotomia of the dght thorax, we succeeded in our intensive therapeutic measures to stabilize and improve the cardio-pulmonal condition. The patient could be discharged from our clinic one month later. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of instant interdisciplinary cooperation, regarding the microbiological monitoring for an adequate chemotherapy, and the surgical focus sanitation, which is a prerequisite for a successful intensive care therapy.",

One should expect that small molecules as dopamine (dopa), noradrenaline (nor) and adrenaline (adr), (M weight respectively 205, 189 and 182 Dalton) are easily removed by CWH. Dose adjustment may be necessary. No clear information on this subject is available. We undertook a clearance study in 6 patients (4 men, 2 women; aged 50-76 years). All patients received triple vaso-active therapy for severe septic shock and multiple organ failure and were treated with CVHH (16-36 liters/day) using a Gambro MPM 30 module and a FH-6hemofilter. One hour sieving coefficients for dopa, nor and adr were respectively: 0,52 \u00b10.21; 0,67 \u00b10,ii and 0,82 \u00b10,52. Clearances were 9,4 \u00b13,3; 15,2 \u00b12,7 and 16,4 \u00b18,7 ml.min, respectively. Conclusion: Seaving coefficients and clearances for vasoactive substances during CVHH were in the range of expected small-molecule clearances (compatible with urea and kreatinin clearances) and there seems no need for dosage adaptation in hemofiltered patients. Introduction: SIRS leading to multiple organ failure is known to be the major cause of delayed death after multiple injury. Cytokines and other mediators are involved in the development of SIRS, In part, this syndrome is eharacterised by a hyperdyuamic circulatory state and impaired oxygen utilisation. Hemofdtration is a welt estab/ished and safe treatmen~ in acute renal failure and has also been used in acute respiratory failure. There is evidence that early treatment of severe sepsis with haemofdtration may be beneficial, e.g. by elimination of circulating mediators. Because of the pathopbysiological similarity of infection-related and posttraumatie SIRS we investigated the influence of CWH on posttraumatic circulatory state, oxygen extraction ratio, circulating mediator levels and tissue injury.",

A variety of mediators, e.g, C3a, PMN-elastase, I1-6, were significantly reduced in CVVH group, indicating attenuation of SIRS. This was supported by reduced lipid peroxidafion products, suggesting limited membrane injury.

Tirilazad mesylate (U74006F) represents a new class of substances with effective antioxidant properties.We studied the effects of U74006F on 02 consumption (VO2)/O2 delivery (DO2) relationships when blood flow was progressively reduced by cardiac tamponade during endotoxic shock in 24 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs. Methods Group 1 (N=8) and Group 2 (N=8) received endotoxin (2 mg/kg i.v.) alone or combined with U74006F at an initial bolus of 80 #g/kg i,v. followed by an continuous infusion of 10 #g/kg.min, respectively. Group 3 (N=8) served as control. All animals were given saline infusion to restore baseline cardiac filling pressure. Tamponade was then induced in each dog. Regional blood flow in superior mesenteric, left renal and femoral beds was measured by ultrasonic flowmeter. Venous catheters were also inserted regionally. Systemic and regional VO2 was derived from the expired gases or calculated as the product of regional blood flow and the arteriovenous difference in 02 content. DO2 was determined as the product of blood flow and arterial 02 content. In patients with COPD pursed lips breathing (PLB) is known to reduce dyspnea and to improve gas exchange. These effects have been attributed to a decrease in small airway collapse. To study the principle of PLB in ventilated patients with COPD, we investigated the effects of an external resistance added to the expiratory port of the ventilator on respiratory mechanics. 5 patients who were paralyzed and ventilated in the volume controlled mode, were studied during unobstructed expiration and during application of an external resistance. The added resistance was chosen to lead to an external PEEP of 4 cm 1-120. In all patients intrinsic PEEP ~EEPi) was established during unobstructed expiration. The application of the resistance did reduce PEEPi-level; the total PEEP-level (sum of extrinsic PEEP and intrinsic PEEP) remained unchanged. Analysis of the expiratory volume displacement revealed that the added resistance did retard the expiration. Expiratory flow-volume curves revealed that compared with the unobstructed expiration the added resistance was associated with elevated iso-volume flows, indicating a reduction in the transpulmonary resistance. This reduction in transpulmonary resistance was probably due to the abolishement of expiratory flow limitation, which was demonstrated by the interrupter technique. Application of an external resistance added to the expiratory port of the ventilator can in ventilated patients ~$th COPD reduce transpulmonary resistance and abolish expiratory flow limitation, without increasing lung volume.

Little is known about the impact of the PP on the evolution of the patients. We report preliminary results on the influence of PP on oxygenation during five days. METHODS: Eight patients with severe ARDS were studied ( age:44+20, SAPS:I 1.2+-4.3).

NO inhalation improves oxygenation in ARDS. This is supposed to be related to vasodilation of the ventilated zones of the lung, inducing a \"pulmonary steal\" of blood from low ventilation/perfusion ratio zones to correctly ventilated zones. We hypothesized that, by increasing ventilation of hypoxic zones, PP may reinforce the NO effect on oxygenation. A 64-year-old man was suffering from severe ARDS (Murray's score:3) related to a bilateral pneumonia. He was ventilated with 100% oxygen (PEEP: 10 cm H20). A continuous low flow of NO was added (450 ppm tank; CFPO; Bonneuil/Marne,France) adjusted to administer 10 ppm.

A CESAR\u00ae ventilator (TAEMA TM) connected to our monitoring system was set in the controlled ventilation mode with constant flow inflations. It was connected via a conventional patient circuit, including an empty humidifyer (Model 3000 HPD Medical TM ), to a test lung (Model 2600i Dual Adult TI'L \u00ae, Michigan Instruments~). The airway resistance was set at various levels using 8 different combinations of resistors (PneuFlo TM Airway Resistors). As the PneuFlo resistors exhibit parabolic pressure change as a function of flow, we first calculated the true resistance (Rtrue) corresponding to each combination at the imposed flow, The mean value of 5 consecutive automatic estimations has been obtained for each resistor combination (mean variation less than 5%) and compared to the corresponding Rtrue. There is a significant correlation between measured and calculated values (Rint = 037 Rtrue+3.5 cm H20.l-l.s, p< 0.05). The intercept corresponds to the resistance of tubings between the ventilator and the test lung. The slope is well explained by a model of compressibility of air in the humidifier.

Eight sedated and paralyzed ARDS patients (LIS 3.01 _+0.12) were studied within the first 48 hours of controlled mechanical ventilation (Servo 900C, Siemens). We measured tracheal pressure (Ptr) and airflow (V3. Signals were analogic to digital converted for posterior data analysis. Respiratory mechanics was assessed by constant flow end-inspiratory (3.5s) and end-expiratory (3s) occlusions technique. After a PEEP level of 0,5,10 and 15 cmH20 we measured autoPEEP and calculated Crs, Rmax and Rmin. We also determined PaOJFiOz, Qs/QT and total respiratory system pressure-vofume (P-V) curve at PEEP 0 and with PEEP (range 10-15 cmH20). Values were compared using ANOVA and Scheffe F-test. Results.

Conclusion: These results indicate that the surfactant layer is also a rate* limiting factor for large molecules. The application of higher airway pressures in healthy ~ungs also resulted in increase of the clearance rates. A possible mechanism could be that the larger pressure-volume swings applied to healthy lungs lead to disturbance of the integrity of the pulmonary surfactant system. Gastric intramural pH(pHi) has been recently used to estimate splanchnic oxygenation in critically ill patients. In hypercapnic COPD patients, calculation of pHi with measurements of gastric luminal PCO2 (PgCo2) has not been reported. The objectives of this study were to determine if 1) PgCO2 is influenced by PaCO2, 2) phi and/or PgCO2 can be used to predict the success of weaning in COPD patients. METHODS : 9 COPD patients (receiving ranitidine), mechanically ventilated, having the criteria to be weanable from mechanical ventilation (Concensus conference; Rean Urg; 1992) were studied. Arterial blood gases and PgCO2 were measured 24h, just before, and after a weaning trial of 20min. Weaning failure was defined as the development of respiratory distress and/or arterial blood gases impairements during the first 2h of spontaneous breathing on T-piece, or reintubation within 24h after extubation (Yang,Tobin; N Engl J Med; 1991) . RESULTS : 1) Before the weaning trial : phi=7.38_+0.07, PgCO2=58.2+8.8mmHg and PaCO2=46,4_+6,6mmHg. For the overa]I measurements pHi is significantly correlated with pHa (r=0.5;p<0.005) and PgCO2 (~--0.8; p<0.0001). No correlation was found between pHi (or PgCO2) and PaCO2, HCO3-, base excess, PaO2 and SaO2. pHi during mechanical ventilation is _<7.32 in patients who failed weaning, and >_7.35 in patients who were successfuUy weaned (p<0.000t\" Se and Sp of 100%). PgCO2 and PgCO2/PaCO2 during mechanical ventila -~ t ion are significantly different (p<0.005) between patients who were I i successfully weaned and those who where not (respectively 67.4+4.7 ]vs 53.7+6.5mmHg and 1.5+0.2 vs 1.2_+0.1). 2) After 20 rain of the{ weaning trial : pHi=7.301-0.t, PgCO2=66.9+7.tmmHg and PaCO2= 1 53.9+4.8mmHg, without significant changes between patients who were successfully weaned and those who where not. I CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that 1) pHi measurement is re-I liable in hypercapnic patients 2) pHi (or PgCO2) seems to be a simple indice to predict weaning success or failure in COPD patients. ]",

RESULTS Results are shown in table below; all differences are significant (p<O.01}, except for t(AP=0) between high and low insplratory effort. Gasparetto Rez2nt studies suggest a bronchodtla\" tative effect of propofol in patients with chronic~y or acutely increased airway resistance. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of propofol on respirator3., system mechanics of 6 pts sedated~paralyzed and mechanically ventilated for S.A. All patients were refractor 3 ' to conventional treatment (ix. salbutamol +steroids+doxophylline) and required controlled mechanical ventilation for respirator3, acidosis. Respiratory. mechanics was evaluated with the constant flow endinspiratory and end-expiratory occlusion technique ill basal conditions (i.e. during diazepam sedation + parab/sis) and after propofol (1.5 mg/kg bolus dose followed by continuous infusion). Results:Propotbl administration produced the following effects: peak tracheal pressure decreased from 43 _+ 8.9 to 36 -7.8 cmH20 (p<O.05); total resistance of the respirator, system 28 \u00b1 6,9 to 23 _+ 6.4 cmH20/1/sec (p=ns); minimal resistance of the respirator3, system decreased from 20 i 6.6 to 13.8 :! 6.4 cm H20 (p<0,05); PEEP i decreased from 10.8 \u00b1 2.4 to 6.8 + 1.9 cmH20 (p<0.05). No siml~cant side effect was detected and respirator, mechanics further improved during the infusion. All patients were succesfully exmbated within 72 hours. Conclusion : Propofol induces a reduction in resistances of the respirator), ~stem, intrinsic PEEP and peak inspiratory tracheal pressure in S.A, patients alrea~ anesthetized and parab'zed thus excluding an aspecific effect due to sedation. Our results suggest the use of propofol for the sedation of S.A. patients requinng I mechanical ventilatory support. Prone position is used in Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) to improve arterial oxygenation. However the physiopathologicat mechanism determing changes in oxygenation has not been yet elucidated. We studied 7 ARF mechanically ventilated patients (Murray score>2.5), at constant tidal volume (10ml/Kg), respiratory rate (16-20 b/min), positive end-expiratory pressure (11+3 cmH20), and inspired oxygen concentration (0.58+0.12), by computed tomography (CT scan), both in supine and prone position. CT scan sections were taken at the lung base at end-expiration and divided into ten levels from ventral to dorsal. The gas/tissue ratio (g/t), as an index of regional inflation, was computed at each lung level. The rate of change of g/t with lung height was described by a constant (Kd), which can be considered as an index of regional inflation distdbution (higher Kd indicates a more homogeneous distribution of regional inflation). To describe quantitatively the lung shape, each CT section was divided into two compartments: an upper compartment (Uc) (level 1 to 5) and a lower compartment (Lc) (level 6 to 10), The lung shape (U%) was described as Uc/(Uc+Lc). The difference in Kd, U% and arterial oxygenation (PaO2) in prone and supine position were calculated (DKd, DU% and DPaO2, respectively). In figure the relationship between DPaO2 and DKd is shown. -20",

There is frequently a marked discrepancy between the morphology of radiological methods (x-ray, HR-CT, wedge-angiography) and the actual disturbance of g~s exchange in ARDS-patients. The aim of our present study was therefore to develope a bedside method to quantify the gas exchanging pulmonary compartment. The clinical relevance of such a method was examined in 24 patients suffering from severe eases of ARDS and 12 patient with normal pulmonary fimction. Methods Our method to quantify functional pulmonary paranchyma is based on a modified model after Riley. The mathematical connection of three compartments (shunt, dead-space and gas-exchange compartment) enables us to determine the ratio of intact to total pulmonary parenchyma [described as gas-exchange-coefficient (Gpv) in the following passages]. In the early stage of our study 24 ARDS-patients (LUNG INJURY SCORE > 2,5; Morell stage III-IV) and 12 pulmonary healthy patients received Swan-Ganz-Catheters. Their data combined with the results of eapnography helped to determine shuntfraction and shunt-corrected alveolar dead space and enabled us to calculate the gas-exchange-coefficient. Finally the means of the gas-exchange-coefficients of pulmonary healthy patients, surviving ARDS-patients and non-surviving ARDS-patients were determined. The findings were checked for significance using Wileoxon-U-Test.",

Objective: To evaluate 1.the ability of the physical examination to predict accurate placement of endotracheal tube (ETT), 2.the necessity for post-intubation chest radiographs (CR) in the I CU. Methods: Prospective study of 137 consecutive intubations (In). Fiberoptic In were excluded. The physician (Ph) described immediately after In the circumstances and technique of procedure and chose between 2 possibilities: 1.ETT supposed in adequate position (centimeter marks, breath sounds), 2.doubt about ETT position and clear need of CR. In all cases a CR was obtained and data were collected about ETT repositioning. Malposition was defined by ETT location < 20 mm above carina (Brunel Chest 1989; 96:1043-5) . The chi-sqaare test was used for comparison of categorical variables. Results: t00 patients underwent 137 In, all performed in the ICU. Mean age was 61,2y (SD18,8), SAPS 15,04 (SD5,75), weight 71,9kg (SD27), height 166,1cm (SD8,6). In was elective (55,47%), urgent (36,5%) or in case of cardio-respiratory arrest (8,03%). Orotracheal route 57,66%, general anesthesia 92,7%, visualization of the glottis 93,43%, Senior Ph 32,85%. 116 ETT (84,67%) were predicted to be in place and of these 116 cases, 12 (8,76% of the total) were too distal. It was a doubt about ETT position in 21 cases and of these 21, 7 (5,11% of the total) were too distal. Sensitivity of physical examination was 88%, specificity 37%, positive and negative predictive values 0,9 and 0,33 respectively. Of the 13,87% EFT which were too distal, 13,41% were pull up. ETT was too distal in 20,25% of orotracheal route and 5,17% of nasotracheal route (p=0,0025) There was no other significative difference, especially regarding to patient's sex and m0rphotype , circumstances of In, experience of the Ph. No ETT was above cords but 17,52% were considered by the Ph as too high and were push down. 30,93% of all ETT were repositioned after CR. Conclusions: Routine radiographs showed a clinically unsuspected too distal ETT in fast one case about ten. Physical examination is an unreliable indicator of ETT malposition in the ICU.",

The vasodilator effect of breathing NO on the arterial pulmonary circulation is well known in many cases of arterial ~ulmonary hypertension. The aim of this study is to evaluate the respiratory and hemodynamic effects of NO in patients with chronic obstructive ~ulmonary disease (CORD) and acute respiratory failure (ARF) Patients and methods : g patients (mean age 62~I0 years) with CORD and pulmonary hypertension are studied. They have ARF and controlled ventilation. Respiratory and hemodynamic data are collected before NO inhalation after 15 minutes of NO inhalation (40 ppm) and 30 minutes after the end of NO breathing. Statistic analysis use ANOVA. I PS) is a popular mode for assisting spontaneous breathing. In weaning patients with respiratory failure using IPS, we fou rid, however, that more than 50 % of the patients displayed desynchronisation, i. e. the ventilator did not detect and consequently did not support all the patients' efforts to breathe. The reasons for desynchronisation are 1 ) a prolonged ventilator response delay (e. g. due to t rigger mechanisms), 2) an imperfect criterion for the termination of pressure support, and 3) dynamic hyperinflation (e. g. due to expiratory flow limitation). Reasons 1) and 2) can be rectified with Proportional Assist Ventilation (PAV). Expiratory flow limitation can be reduced with a mode compensating for the flow-dependent resistance of the endotracheal tube. We combined PAV with ATC in a modified demand flow ventilator and applied this mode in a patient displayed desynchronisation. Under IPS the respiratory rate measured at the ventilator was 20/rain, however, the patient attempted to breathe 50/min. Under PAV with ATC each breathing effort was supported by the ventilator. The tigure shows volume, airway pressure and esophageal pressure of this patient in both modes. Ventilation with highpeak airway pressures (Peak-AP) can produce severe respiratory deterioration, with an increase in extravascular lung water (L~/LW). It is therefore possible that mechanical ventilation with high pressures can contribute to lung damage in patients with Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (APJ)S). This deterioration will often not be recognised, due to the severe pulmonary injuries that these patients already have.",

Chopin Introduction : The efficacy of fiberoptic bronehoscopy or physiotherapy using mechanical vibrations and posture drainage was compared in ICU patients presenting with acute lobar atelectasis (ATL). Methods end patients : 26 ICU patients with ATL were randomly assigned m receive one of the two following treatments: In group F (n =14): flexible bronchoscopy with bronchial washing and repetitive auctioning. In group P (n=12): one procedure of physiotherapy with lateral positioning, mechanical chest wall vibrations end bronchial aspiration. ATL involved three lobes in 16 cases, two lobes in 3 eases and 1 lobe in 7 cases. Both treatment groups were well balanced for all dernographie, radiologio end gas exchenge charaeteristlcs. ResuIts were independently evaluated at H0, HI, H6 and H24 by two trained physicians, as for radiologic c~teria of ATL, number of involved lobes end percentage of resolution, Statistical analysis used CHI2 test, ANOVA or Menn-Whitney's test, for p<0.05. Results : Complete resolution of ATL was obtained in 12/26 cases (46%); 8/12 in group P and 4/14 in group F (p--0.052). In group P, there was a trend to a more rapid resolution of radiologic criteria. The PaO2/FIO2 ratio increased in group P only at H24.

            "text": "The respiratory distress syndrome is an important cause of respiratory failure, and is associated with impaired surfactant function leading to atelectasis with severe hypoxemia. Application of exogenous surfactant, or increase in PEEP, increases arterial oxygenation by recruiting collapsed alveoli. Recently, it has been demonstrated that inhalation of nitric oxide (NO) can be used to produce selectee pulmonary vasodilatation leading to redistribution of the pulmonary perfusion followed by improvement of arterial oxygenation. In this study, we examined the benefits of inhalational NO in combination with surfactant therapy on blood gases in an animal model of acute respiratory failure. Methods: Adult New Zealand rabbits (n= 12; 2.7-+0.3 kg) were anesthetized, tracheotomized, paralysed and ventilated with a Siemens Servo Ventilator 300 (Siemens-Elema, Solna, Sweden). A new prototype of the Servo 300 was used, which was equipped by the company with an in-built computerized NO application system. After inducing respiratory insufficiency by lung lavage, animals were first ventilated for 45 mfn and were then randomly divided into three groups. The first group (n=6) received a natural surfactant (25 mg/kg) intratracheally. After 30 rain, different concentrations of NO (4, 8, 10, 16, 20 ppm) were inhalated for 30 min and blood gases were measured at 5, 15 and 30 min after inhalation. After each NO inhalation, NO was turned off for a period of 30 min and blood gases were measured accordingly. The second group (n =3) was not given surfactant but received NO treatment in the same way as group 1. The third group (n=3) received only suffactant (25 mg/kg). Results: In group 1, instillation of 25 mg surfactarrt per kg bw improved arterial oxygenation from 58-+12 to 302_+86 mmHg. Adding NO in concentrations between 4-20 ppm, PaO 2 could be further improved. After turning off the NO inhalation, arterial oxygenation decreased. There was no correlation between the NO concentration and the changes in artedal oxygenation. In group 2 (PaO 2 =63--10 mmHg), NO had no effect in improving gas exchange, independently of the NO concentration. In group 3 (PAO2=61 +-7 mmHg) arterial oxygenation increased to 280+-61 mmHg and decreased slowly over time.",

We hypothesized that the effect of Rett on the efficacy of PS could be overcome by utilizing tracheal (Ptr) rather than airway opening pressure (Pan) to regulate the preset pressure applied. Using an endolracheal catheter to sense Ptr and a specially modified ventilator (Drager Evita), this hypothesis was tested in 5 intubated COPD patients by assessing breathing pattern and inspiratory effort during separate trials in which Pan or Ptr were maintained constant at the preset level (0-15 cmI-I20 ).

The effects on breathing pattern were similar for Pan and Ptr regulated forms of PS.

In COPD patients mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure (AI~, we previously studed the effects of inspiratory flow (P) on respiratory mechanics (J. Appl.Physiol. 1993,74, 3570) . We observed that the interrupter resistance (Rint), which reflects airway resislance, increased with increasing F, and that, according to a four-parameter model, the additinnnal resistance (AR), which reflects time constant inequalities and/or viscoelastic properties of the tissues within the respiratory system (rs), decreased with increasing F. The aim of this work was to evaluate the clinical implications of these results. In I0 (9 men) informed consent COPD patients (mean +-SEM age 63_+2 years), intubated and mechanically ventilated for ARF, we randomly applied for 20 minutes the following three levels of constant-F : low ( 0.4-+0.1 L/s), medium (0.8_+0.02 I/s) and high (13\u00b10.03 Us). Pressure was measured distally to the endotracheal tube. Changes in F were done by regulating the inspiratory time, while tidal volume (0.70_+0.02 L), FiO2 (0.45-+0.03), frequency (13 breaths/rain) remained constants. All the measurements were done at end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to zero. At the end of each experimental period, we obtained respiratory mechanics from the rapid end-inspiratory airway occlusion technique (twice), hemodynamics from a Swan Ganz catheter, together with arterial and mixed venuous blood gases. End expiratory occlusions were performed to detect and quantify intrinsic PEEP (PEEPi).",

BiPAP can be described as super-imposition of time-cycled, pressure controlled mechanical ventilation pattern on spontaneous/support CPAP ventilation pattern. In contrast to the conventional 3MV modes of ventilation, where ventilation is provided by increasing lung volume above baseline functional residual capacity (FRC), in the BiPAP mode ventilation is provided by altering the baseline FRC between two levels.

Although the use of PEEP in mechanicany ventilated COPD patients is still a matter of debate, studies investigating its effect on respiratory mechanics have been done at a fLxed inflation flow (F) and volume (AV). Therefore we have studied 8 informed consent acutely ill COPD patients (7 men) (mean -+SEM age of 63+4 years) intubated and mechanically ventilated for 1 to 3 days. We used the technique of rapid end-iuspiratory airway occlusion during constant-flow inflation to assess respiratory mechanics of the respiratory system (rs).

Methodes: After approvel by the local institutional review board 10 artificial ventilated patients suffering from severe ARDS (LIS > 2.5, Murray et al, Am. Rev. Reap. Dis.1988: 130: 12-15 ) were included to the study. In the initial thoracic CT-soan before starting prone positioning dorsal dys-and atelectases were present in all patients. The patients were positioned between supine and prone position in 12 hours intervalls, for an allover time period of 6 days. Thoracic CT scans were repeated at the 6th day after admission. Quantitative analysis of CT scan data was based on the frequency distribution of the CT numbers. The CT number represents the linear attenuetlon coefficient of a X-ray in a given substance relative to the linear attenuation of water, and is expressed in Hounsfield Units (HU). Recruitment of atelectases after 6 days of intermittant prone positioning were quantified by defining 3 compartments within the lungs: a)normal inflated, b) poor inflated, c) non inflated lung (Rosenblum et al; Radiology 1980; 137: 409) . The frequency distribution of HU in each compartment was computed at the carina level (C) and 1 cm above diaphragm (P). Gas exchange was assessed by aterial blood gas analysis. Data were statistically analized by using ANOVA. Can a shift from carbohydrate (C) to lipid (L) calories decrease the carbon dioxide production (VCO 2) in critically ill patients? 16 patients with an ARDS and total enteral nutrition were divided in two groups. 8 patients received during a period of 6 days an enteral diet with 50% of the calories as C and 8 patients with identical conditions a enteral diet with 50% of the calories as L. All other components of the diet are comparable.

As perflubron has a specific gravity of 1.918 g/cm 3 at 25\u00b0C one could speculate that perflubron might block pulmonary capillary perfusion in large animals due to hydrostatic compression. Theffore the dose-related influence of perflubron on hemodynamics and gas exchange was investigated. Methods: Nine female Yorkshire pigs (50 \u00b1 3 kg BW) were anesthetised with a continuous infusion of ketamine and midazolam and paralyzed with pancuronium. All animals were tracheotomized, intubated and cannulated with a carotid artery catheter, a pulmonary artery catheter and a central venous catheter. During animal preparation volume controlled ventilation with a Servo 300 ventilator (Siemens, Solna, Sweden) (set at: freq. 20 b/min, insp. time 25%, pause time 10%, insp. rise time 5% PEEP 5 cm H20 and 100% oxygen) was adjusted to obtain a PaCt 2 of 40 \u00b1 3 mmHg. All animals were surfactant depleted by lung lavage to a Pat 2 below 100 mmHg and randomized to receive either perflubron (n=3) or saline (n=3) in 5 doses of 5 ml/kg at 20 min intervals, or to receive no instillation (n=3). In all animals heart rate, mean arterial pressure, mean pulmonary pressure (MPAP), cardiac output, and arterial oxygen tension (Pat2) were recorded at 20 rain intervals (in the treated groups 20 min after each dose). Results: Perflubron resulted in a significant (ANOVA p<0.01) increase in Pat 2 from 88.3 \u00b1 9.2 to 367.5 \u00b1 37.5 mmHg. Whereas the other groups showed no significant increase in Pat 2, There was no deleterious effect on any hemodynamic parameter in the perflubron group, even the MPAP showed a persistent decrease (7 \u00b1 3.6 mmHg) after the first 5 ml/kg of perflubron.

Although little toxicological research involving inhaled NO has been published, pulmonary surfactant activity has been proven to be a sensitive indicator for early lung damage. We speculated that the use of NO, due to its high reactivity with oxygen resulting in NO 2 formation, may interfere with the surfactant system. Melhods: Seven groups of 6 healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats (bodyweight 250-300 g). All groups were anesthetized, tracheotomized and paralyzed. Six groups were ventilated for eight hours using a modified Servo Ventilator 300 (Siemens, Sotna, Sweden) set to deliver pressure controlled ventilation with a frequency of 30/min, and I:E ratio of 1:2 and a PEEP of 3 cm H20.

The performance of the PO.1 controller was evalnated by calculating, the steady state P0.1 error (P0.1 SSE, target minus actnal P0.1) and the root mean squared error (P0.1 RMSE), during the last 160 cycles of each period. Results and conclusions. See Introdu~: Prone position has been repeatedly recommended for the treatment of severe ARDS. Especially in patients with major ventilation/perfusion mismatch this method has a great appeal from a pathophysiological point of view. Therefore, we investigated the treatment of ARDS with prone position in patient without thoracic trauma.",

As the suspected diagnosis was bleomycir~ toxicity, methylprednisotone lg/day for 3 days followed by tapered doses was administred but her pulmonary status continued to deteriorate so that she was considered for exlra-corporeal lung support ~2/FtO2 = 67 with a PEEP at 10 cm H20, peak pressure 40 can H20 and I.E. at 1.1). As the evolution of bleomycine induced fibrosis is unknown if the toxic effect of high pressure and O2 are removed and as the prognosis of her Hodgkin's disease was good,, she was placed on low flow vent-venous extracorporeal support (ECCO2R). After 35 days of support, no improvement was noted. A open lung biopsy showed massive interstitial fibrosis and disappearance of the nermal alveolar structure; As she was not candidate for lung transplantation, it was decided not to change the oxygenators when they would fail and the patient died on day 45 of support from progressive hypoxemia. This case illustrates the evolution of Neomycin-induced fibrosis if no response to steroids is observed : even if any possible toxicity of the ventilation is removed,the evolution is towards irreversible fibrosis. We conclude that extracorporeal lung support is probably contra-indicated in patients with suspected bleomycin toxicity. ",

DESIGN and SETTING: Prospective study with follow up to ICU discharge. A multidisciplinary adult ICU in a 650 beds hospital. PATIENTS: 100 patients (average age 58) were studied: 15 postsargical without cardio-pulmonary pathology who were selected for the control group, and 85 consecutive patients with VF from different causes. METHODS: Patients were intubated, adecuatcly sedated and paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated using a Serve 900C Siemens ventilator. Airway pressure (Paw) and Flow (V) were measured with pressure transducers incorporated into ventilator. All the RM measures and x-ray film were made immediately after the endotracheal intubation, except in the control group (3.5 + 1.5 hours after they were intubated). In each patient we obtained the static inflation compliance of the total respiratory system (Cst, rs), the total inspiratory resistence (Pit) and the \"intrinsic PEEP\" (ante-PEEP); also recorded the appearance of Paw and V forms. RESULTS: We found four patterns ofRM (A: Cst,rs ~ ; B: Ritlland auto-PEEP; C: Cst, rs ~ and Pit I and auto-PEEP; and D: RM normal, like control group). Using these patterns whithout knowing others clinic data from the patients, and after comparing with the final diagnostic, we had a mistake physiopathologic diagnosis in 5 (6%) eases (3 with pulmonary edema, 1 with pneumonia and septic shock and other with pneumonia and neuromuscular disease), in whom the x-ray let us to make the exact diagnostic.

The ability to breathe spontaneously depends on the respiratory drive and the load and capacity of the respiratory muscles. Intermittent mechanical ventilation (MV) has been shown to improve ventilatory function in hypercapnic patients. Thus, we studied changes in drive, load and capacity of the respiratory muscles during this therapy. Method: In 19 hypercapnic patients (9 COPD, 6 scoliosis, 4 neuromuscular), who were successfully treated by intermittent MV (2 via tracheostomy, 17 nasal mask) respiratory drive was assessed by CO 2rebreathing and by the CO 2-recruitment threshold Pco 2RT, defined as the lowest Pco 2, at which spontaneous respiratory activity could be detected in a mechanically hyperventilated patient. The demand on the respiratory muscles was determined by the mouth occlusion pressure P0.1 during spontaneous breathing in percent of its maximum (P 0.1 ma)} Results: The response in minute volume VE (0.36) and in occlusion pressure P0.1(0.2) to CO 2was markedly reduced compared to normal subjects (1.42 and 0.66). The P0.1 in percent of its maximum, however, representing the relative drive, was increased by at least 60% at any given Pco 2. The Pco 2RT decreased from 62+__10 to 44\u00b18mmHg during intermittent IPPV, while spontaneous Pco 2 decreased from 60~+9 to 41 +__6. The demand on the respiratory muscles was critically increased to 0.26, but decreased during therapy due to an increase in ventilatory capacity (p < 0.001 ).",

To evaluate VO2 as as a predictor, metabolic gas exchange (Deltatrac, Datex) was continously measured in a total of 150 days in 61 consecutive mechanically ventilated ICU patients in whom the APACHE-II score also was calculated for each day. Of the indices of metabolic gas exchange VO2 was the most powerful predictor of survival ( 314_+ 54 in survivors vs 266_+ 79 ml/min in non-survivors,p<0.0001), but also carbon dioxide production (VCO2) and energy expenditure were elevated in survivors (p<0.001). In a multiple logistic analysis, VO2 was found to be a more powerful predictor of survival than the APACHE-II score ( p<0.0001 and p<0.0005 respectively ), but these variables were independent and additative predictors of survival. Conclutions: Indices of metabolic gas exchange, especially VO2, were found to be predictors of survival in mechanically ventilated ICU patients.As the ability of VO2 to predict outcome was superior, and additative, to the APACHE-II score measurements of VO2 would provide an additional tool to evaluate the prognosis of critically ill patients.",

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of ACV and PSV on WOB,in intubated patients with mild ARF. Methods: We studied 12 patients, intubated between 24 and 72 h. earlier, first in ACV and then in PSV. Mean FiO 2 was lower than 0.5. During ACV, we chose a ~ (constant inspiratory flow) between 4 and 6 times the minute ventilation obtained during spontaneous breathing (SB). During ACV, V r was set at 8 mL/kg and I/E ratio between 1:2 to 1:3. The PSV level was adjusted so as to obtain the same respiratory rate (f) as during ACV. Measurements of WOB from Campbell's diagrams and other parameters of lung mechanics were done after 30 min of stabilization with each ventilatory mode. Signals of airway pressure (Paw) flow and esophageal P were digitized and acquired by a microcomputer in order to perform the calculations. Differences among ventilatory modes were analyzed by means of a two-way ANOVA. Results: (mean~SEM): Mean airway pressure was i0.3~0.7 cnff~o during ACV and 9.8~0.6 cmH20 during PSV (P:NS).

Reidemeister Introduction: After having already proved the beneficial effects of pressure controlled ventilation on cardiac function by a hemodynamical monitoring, we liked to demonstrate these effects by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). We have compared the flow reduced and pressure controlled ventilation (PCV) worked out by us with a volume controlled ventilation (VCV), Methods: 15 intubated and analgosedated patients (mean age 65 years) after cardiac surgery (3 aortic valve replacement, t2 anrtocoronary bypassgrafting or both) were examined with TEE (multiplane 5 Mhz probe). Four chamber view as well as hemodynamic parameters were noted after 2 hours of flow and pressure reduced ventilation (flow 24,5 l/miu, inspiration pressure 19,5 tuber), after converting to volume controlled ventilation (vcv; flow 40 l/rain, peak pressure 28,7 mbar, plateau pressure 21 mbar) and 30 minutes of adaptation. Left ventricular (LV) function was assessed additionally for both modes of ventilation from the gastric view in the midpapillary region. Results: Besides an increased Cardiac index (CI) and decreased pre-and afterload, we found during PCV an enlarged right atrium (RA) from 9,3 to 10,1 (us) and Eight ventricle (RV) from 11,6 to 12,6 (p< .03) cm 2, whereas left atrium (LA) decreased from 12,8 to 11,8 cm (p< .03) and left ventricle (LV) from 20,0 to 18,7 cm 2 (p<.03). LV-ejection fraction during PCV increased from 41 to 45% (p < .005), the LV-shortening fraction from 28 to 31%. The RV-ejection fraction increased from 40 to 45% (p< .001). Conclusions: During pressure controlled ventilation there is a minimized intrathoracic pressure, better relaxation of the right heart, increased left heart function within decreased pre-and afterload. Introduction. The possibility of changing Vl during PSV is a feature of some of the last generation ventilators. We aimed to study its consequences on the pattern of breathing and on the inspiratory work. Methods.We studied 9 patients on PSV (Drager Evita). A study of 3 level of PSV (increasing from PSV 1 to PSV 3) and 4 values of 41 (decreasing from 911 to 41 4) was designed. In all patients we measured flow and the esophageal pressure (Pes). The following were derived by flow and Pes traces: breathing frequency (f; breath/min)), lnspiratory tidal volume (Vt; ml), dynamic intrinsic PEEP (PEEPi; cm H20) WOB (mj), WOB per liter (WOB/I; mj/1) and pressure time product (J\" Pes; cm H20,sec).

During PSV most of COPD patients made several IE (inspiratory attempts unable to trigger the ventilator to inspiration), while this did not happen in group B. The application of an external PEEP (PEEPe) of 75% of the static PEEP\u00b1 caused a significative reduction of these IE; the pressure time product of the diaphragm (PTPdi) and the EMG (Edi), both reflecting the metabolic work of the diaphragm were also significantly reduced (59% and 64% of control,respectively). Minute ventilation remained constant but Vt decreased together with Te, maintaining the blood gases unaltered. We conclude that PSV may induce different respiratory patterns in patients with ARF, depending from the underlying pathologies. In patients with severe airflow limitation the addition of PEEPe may reduce the effort of the diaphragm and the amount of inefficient efforts, without altering gas exchange.

The preliminar study includes 58 Pts, all those who needed tracheal intubation during more than 48 hours, in ICU, since september of 1992 to september of 1q93. RESULTS: Death rate was 57% (33 Pts). Thirty Pts (51%) underwent tracheotomy. In 32 of 41 Pts was necessary to post-pone tracheotomy, 84% of them had neurologic lesions, in eleven of these Pts tracbeotomy was not performed. Thirty Pts had acute complications attributed to intubation and seventeen Its to tracheotomy; none of them was considered severe.

Its mortality remains high in patients with persistence / progression of their hematologic disease. Patients who are suncesfully treated for their underlying disease have better prognosis, Despite severe hrombocytopenia no majqr lung parenchymal hemorrhagic complications occured in patients treated by mechanical ventilation. The mechanical effects of HME's in patients under mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure (ARF) have not been thoroughly investigated. Methods.The problem was studied on 10 patients, assisted by pressure support (PS) ventilation for ARF. The following 3 conditions were randomly tested on each patient: the control condition, without HME, the use of a low volume HME (LV), the use of a high volume HME (HV). Continuous monitoring of P0.1 and close loop regulation of the PS level based on this parameter, were applied in order to maintain a constant patient inspiratory activity during the whole study. After 20 rain in each condition, measurements of ventilatory pattern, gas exchange and, in 5 patients, inspiratory mechanical work, were performed. Results, See 10.8 -+ 1.6 12_+ 1.6 0.01 Alveolar volume (Vt minus Vd), respiratory rate, minute alveolar ventilation (V'a), pit and PaCO2 did not show significant changes. The use of the HME's, and especially Of HV, significantly increased the dead space ventiIation (V'd). The constancy of V'a, pH, and PaCO2 despite the higher V'd depended from a compensatory increase of minute ventilation (V'e), and thus of total inspiratory work (Witot). The higher load due to the HME's was entirely compensated by the ventilator, which developed higher PS levels, being the servocontrol effective to maintain the constancy of P0A and hence of patient inspiratory work (Wipat). Conclusion. HME's have unfavourable mechanical effects due to the increase of Vd. This must be taken into account when assessing patient respiratory performance, and represents a centraindication in severe ARF. * Technical support by Hamilton Bonaduz AG, Switzerland * Partially supported by a grant of IRCCS Policlinico S.

We retrospectively evaluated the frequency and the magnitude of this effect in 20 consecutive mechanically ventilated ARDS patients, by analysing the changes of PaO2 observed during short tests of NO inhalation. The tests were performed in order to assess the interest for a terapeutical use of inhaled NO in each individual patient, Methods. 18 patients were assisted by controlled ventilation, and 2 by pressure support ventilation. The mean PEEP level was 8_+3.6 cmH20, and the mean FiO2 was 0.6_+0,2, The Murray lung injury score (LIS) was 2.8_-20.59. The concentration of inhaled NO averaged 14_+ 6 ppm. Two blood gas analysis were performed, one immediately before and one during NO inhalation, 15 min after the start. A pair of PaO2 data was therefore obtained for each patient, which were compared by the t-test. Patients were arbitrarily classified as responders when an increase of PaO2 from baseline was observed _>10%. Results. The baseline PaO2 averaged 75_+22 mmHg, and significantly increased to 94-+35 mmHg during NO inhalation (P=.0007). Considering the individual response to the NO (see picture), 12 responders could be identified, showing a mean increase of PaO2 from baseline by 41-+26%, while 8 patients were non-responders (mean change +t_+4%). No clinically significant decrease of PaO2 was observed during NO inhalation. The response to the NO did not con-elate with the LIS (r=0.039). Conelusions, Inhaled NO at the dose of 14+_6 ppm increased on the average the PaO2 in a group of ARDS patients, the individual response being however variable. A deterioration of oxygenation was never observed. Even if the criteria for predicting the response to NO still remain to be defined, a short test can easily identify the responders and the magnitude of the response. Recent studies have shown that acute lung injury (ALl) is characterized not only by altered lung compliance but also by increased lung resistance. We studied 16 mechanically ventilated patients with ALl (8 moderate and 8 severe (ARDS)) and 8 normals anesthetized paralyzed subjects (control) at the same tidal volume (0.5 L) and inspiratory flow (0.5 L/s). Lung compliance (Cpl,I), total lung resistance (Rmax,I), airway resistance (Rmin,I), additional lung resistance (DR,I) were measured using the esophageal ballon technique during costant flow inflation without positive end-expiratory pressure applied. Functional residual capacity (FRC) was measured by helium dilution technique. Specific (s) lung compliance (L/cmH20/L) and resistance (cmH20/L/s.L) were obtained standardizing lung compliance and resistance to FRC (L). Results (mean + SD) are shown in tn conclusion in ALl patients: 1)lung compliance is reduced and lung resistances (total, airway and additional) are increased; 2) specific lung compliance is normal. The main cause of the reduction in lung compliance and increase in lung resistance in ALl patients could be attributed to reduced functional residual capacity.",

Furthermore Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) is a therapeutic tool usually applied in ARDS to improve oxygenation and :lung mechanics, The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PEEP on regional compliance and ventilation distribution in ARDS. We studied g mechanically .ventilated ARDS patients (6 male, 3 female, mean age 37 \u00b1 14 yr, Murray score > 2.5) in supine position, by computed tomography (CT scan). CT sections were taken at the lu,ng base, both at end-expiration and end-inspiration, at constant tidal volume (10 mllKg). Each CT section was divided ,into 10 levels and the gas/tissue ratio (g/t), as an index of regional inflation was computed at each level. Regional ventilation was obtained, at each lung level, as the difference between g/t ratio at end-inspiration and end-expiration (Dg/t). Regional compliance (Cpt) was measured as (Dg/t)/Dp where Dp is the difference between end-inspiratory pressure and end-expiratory pressure. Measurements were obtained at 0, 10, 20 cmH20 of PEEP, At PEEP 0 cmH20, ventilation was mainly distributed in ventral regions, while PEEP induced a more homogeneous ventilation distribution along the vertical axis. In figure, regional Cpl at different PEEP is shown. We found that: 1)at PEEP 0 cmH20 both Cpl and Dg/t are higher in the ventral regions; 2)PEEP reduces both Cpl and Dg/t in the ventral regions; 3)PEEP reduces dishornogeneity of Cpl and Dg/t. We can conclude that regional ventilation depends on regional compliance, (1991) (1992) 27 patients with ARDS (Murray:>2.5, APACHE 11:>18, MOF:>6) were assigned to the study and underwent pump-driven CWHF. According to the sevedty of PAH patients were prospectively assigned to either group A (mean pulmonary artery pressure {MPAP]:>30mmHg: PGI2 and heparin) or group B (MPAP<30mmHg: no PGI2). During CWHF, PGI2 was continuously infused into the arterial limb of the extracorporeal circuit before the haemofilter, Overall, 18 patients received PGI2 (Sng/min/kg) and 9 patients heparin (50OlU/h) alone. Haemodynamics and oxygen kinetics were evaluated within four different phases (1: Before; II and Ill: during; and phase IV: end of CWHF). Results: Mortality was 61% within group A and 33% within group B+ 1138 complete evaluations of haemodynamics and oxygen kinetics were performed dudng the study period. MPAP was significantly higher in group A before CWHF, but no differences could be demonstrated dudng phases II -IV (29\u00b1t.8 vs 80\u00b10.TmmHg). No clinically relevanf differences between groups A and B could be demonstrated for cardiac index ((31:4.5+0.1 vs 4.4+0.11/min/m2), PaO2/FiO2 (164+7 vs 178,9.5), oxygen delivery(DO2: 658+12 vs 633+13ml/min/m2) and temperature (36\u00b10.1 vs 36.2\u00b10.1\"C). Oxygen consumption (VO2) of group A patients was significantly higher within all phases of ARDS (140\u00b14 vs 115:t:5ml/min/m2), and did not increase further after the initiation of PGI2. Discussion: We could not demonstrate any detrimental effects of CWHF with PGI2 on haemodynamics (MPAP, CI) as well as oxygen kinetics (PaO2/FiO2, DO2, VO2). Moreover, patients treated with CWHF and PGI2 demonstrated a higher tissue oxygen consumption, without any signs on of a covert oxygen debt. I, Pittet JF. Chest 1990;98:1467; 2.

Side-stzea~ spirometry can be contirmously monitored in ICU patients needing ventilatory support. The effect of the heat and moisture exchanger on the display values was to the same direction in the magority of patients (31:4-1). However, even the statistically significant differences are clinically of minor importance, and we suggest the heat and moisture exchanger can he used safely between the patient and the monitoring site. Improved ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) matching, is considered a major advantage of partial ventilator/support, compared to controlled mechanical ventilation, This study was designed to determine whether a difference in gas exchange exists between pressure-limited partial ventllatory support techniques that allow unsupported spontaneous breathing during any phase of the mechanical ventilatory cycle such as biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) (1) and those that provide mechanical support for each spontaneous inspiratory effort such as pressure support ventilation (PSV)+ After institutional approval, 10 dogs weighing 22-26 k 9, were anesthetized with pentobarbita} (2 mg/kg) and instrumented with femoral and the pulmonary artery catheters. VA/Q relationships were estimated with the multiple inert gas elimination technique using the 50.compartment model (2). Acute lung injury was induced by injection of oleic acid in the right atrial line, and titreted to a PaO2 of 45 to 55 mm Hg. Pressure-limited venti]atory support was then adjusted to produce a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg corresponding to the highest compliance. Inspired 02 fraction was set to 0.3, ]nspiratory to expiratory ratio to 1:1, and ventilator rate to maintain PaCe 2 between 45 and 55 mmHg. PSV and BIPAP with and without spontaneous breathing were tested in random order using equivalent airway pressure limits. BIPAP without spontaneous breathing is identical to pressureqcontrolled ventilation (PCV). Data were analyzed with ANOVA and Scheft6\"s F-test. Application of PEEP in ARDS patients may cause barotrauma, decreasing static compliance (Cst,,rs) and increasing static alveolar pressure (Pet,re) and may compromize hemodynamics, reducing oxygen delivery (DO2) throught the reduction in cardiac index (CI). We verified the hypothesis that lowering VT (permissive hypercapnia) allows to apply PEEP without causing hypefinflation. The effects of 10 cm H20 of applied PEEP on static compliance (Cst,rs), bemodynamics and gas exchange in 9 patients with ARDS during mechanical ventilation with standard VT (10-12 ml/Kg) and with low VT (5-6 ml/Kg) were studied. Representative results ~re showed. When VT was lowered of the 50%, applied PEEP increased Cst,rs and DO 2, This occurred at a value of Pet,re lower than 30 cm H20,( critical value for barotrauma) As expected, the reduction in VT increased significantly PaCe 2 and decreased arterial pH. This could explain the significant increase in mean pulmona D, artery pressure (mPAP) observed with low VT. In conclusion our data suggest that only associating low VT (5-10 ml/kg) and PEEP, a significant improvement in respiratory mechanics and gas exchange in ARDS patients is observed. However, the increase in PaCe 2 and the decrease in arterial pH may compromize hemodynamics. [1] showed that the time course of inspirafory pressure buildup, Le. how fast pressure rises to the set level, influences efficacy and comfort of ~ressurs support ventilation (PSV). The time course can be operator-set in some rands of ventilators while being fixed in most. Information is needed to determine the effects of variations of this parameter in different clinical situations. Because in human subjects or animals these effects are necessarily modulated by central regulation, simulations like the one performed here are needed to isolatedly analyze the interactions between ventilator settings and respiratory system (RS) mechanical properties. Methods: Data resembling digitized measurements of flow, volume, and pressure were generated by repeatedly solving the equation of motion of the RS for discrete points in time (interval 0.01sec). RS was modeled as a single linear structure (compliance (CRS) 0.1 or 0.05L/cmH20 , resistance 1 lcmH2OlUsec, including endotracheal tube). Patient muscular effort (PMus, simulated as sine half-wave) was fixed to -ScmH20 peak negative pressure. Parameters being varied included inspiratory airway opening pressure (PAOli, 3 to 24cmH20), duration of patient effort (TMusOn 0.5 or 1.0see), and expiratory trigger sensitivity (ETS, 12, 25, or 37% of peak flow) Respiratory Rate (RR) was set to 6/min to avoid dynamic hypednflation (DH) or to 20/min, which brought about DH in several settings, PAOli was set to reach the determined level either instantaneously or at the time of peak PMus (0.25 or 0.Ssec). Results: Effects of slowing the nss in PAO/I: Peak flow remained equal or increased slightly (max. 3%), and it occurred later (shortly after set PAO/I was reached). Inspiration lasted up to 0.34sec / 48% longer, the difference being largest when inspiration was terminated passively beyond patient effort. Tidal volume decreased by small amounts {max, 70mL / 12.7%), the decrease being most marked in inspirations terminated dunng patient effort, Patient respiratory work per volume increased n breaths terminated during effort up to 15.4% due to tidal volume reduction, in contr~st in breaths terminated later work per breath and per volume decreased up to 12.3~/~, ' as larger parts of the tidal volume were epptied later and thus passively. Dynamic hyperinllation and the loss in tidal volume asseei3.ted with it was aggravated n settings with late (= passive) termMation of inspiration. Raniefi PAV is a ventilatory mode in which pressure (Pao) is applied in proportion to patient generated flow and volume. It therefore differes from PSV since in the latter, the amount of pressure assistance is fixed on the ventilator. Aim of the stndy was to compare the patient-ventilator interaction in response to a sudden change in respiratory drive in patients ventilated with PSV and PAV. Flow, volume, and esophageal pressure (Pes) were measure in five patients with ARF of varied etiology. During PSV (Pao level sorted to obtain a respiratory rate of 12-15 breaths/ min) and PAV (flow and volume assistance set at 75% of respectively resistance and elastance) respiratory drive was changed by adding a dead space (DS) of 200ml. A representative case is shown below.",

Blood pH and gas analysis usually require intermittent arterial blood sampling tABS). The procedure can be limited in terms of turnaround time and number and frequency of data updates. The intra-arterial blood gas monitoring system PB 3300 (Puritan-Bennett), using a fluorescentbased sensor technology, is inserted via a 20 gauge arlerial catheter in the radial artery and allows a new measurement of pH, PaCt2 and Pad2 every twenty seconds. Of special interest is the accuracy of continuous blood gas analysis in situations of extreme abnormalities met in ICU (severe hypoxemia, permissive hypercapnia, COPD exacerbation...), as well as in the clinical settings where non invasive devices fall. To assess reliability of IABG in such situations l0 patients were studied : 6 ARDS (Peep : 10 + 4 cmH20, Fit2 = 100 %, permissive hypercapnia), 3 COPD exacerbations (2 spontaneously breathing patients), 1 infectious pneumonia. The lesults of 25 averaged ABS per patient were compared to IABG, obtained at the same time, by the method described by Bland and Altman (1) ",

Comparison between R and NR on the dillerent parameters studied are shown in the Introduction, Monitoring end-tidal CO 2 teflon (PetCO~) has become an available and important component of respiratory care in intensive care medicine. However, studies evaluating the utility of capnography during weaning raised opposite results. Therefore, the objective of the present investigation is 1) to evaluate the relationships between PetCO~ and arterial PCO 2 (PaCO2) and 2) the ability of PetCOz to identify clinically relevant episodes of hypercapnia during weaning. Methods. We studied 24 critically ill patients (mean age of 63+_7 yr.; APACHE II of 18\u00b19) who underwent a weaulng trial at the end ofacme respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) (11 \u00b1 5 days on MV). Weaning trial consisted of 2 h. breathing on 5 emHzO CPAP. We determined PaCt2 and simultaneous PetCO2 (HP78556A) in assist/control MV and after 1 h+ and 2 h. of CPAP (immediately before extubation) or immediately before returning to assist/control mode in those patients who failed the weaning trial. Clinically relevant episodes of hypoventilation were described as follows: 1) as an increment of PaCt2 > 42 mmHg in normocapnic patients and 2) as an increment > 8 mmHg from previous PaCO~ in hypercapnic patients. We analyzed the correlation between changes in PaCt2 and PetCO2 and, the sensitivity (SS) and specificity (SP) of PetCO2 to detect hypercapnia, A positive test was defined by both 3 or 5 mmHg increa~ in PetCOz. Results. Correlation between changes in PaCt2 and PetCGz could be observed in the figure. Note that changes between the first and second hour of CPAP were markedly reduced. Clinically relevant episodes of hypoventilatiou were detected by increments > 3 nmfflg in PetCO: with a SS of 86% and SP of 44%, while an increment > 5 mmHg in PetCOz sltowed a SS of 88% and SP 40%.

The technique of extracorporeal lung assist (ELA) in patients with severe ARDS for rapid improvement of gas exchange. Today this method is used when conventional management of patients with severe ARDS seems to fail. However, there is some controversy about the definition of entry cdteda and the comparison of patients treated with or without ELA, This I~aper evaluates the entry criteda of ECMO in patients with severe ARDS either treated with ELA or with conventional advanced treatment and presents a concept for a standardised protocol Using a computerised expert system, with fuzzy logics we retrospectively analysed 78 patients with severe ARDS treated either with (n=30) or without (n=48) ELA at the UKRV/Berlin. Survival in the with ELA treated group was 67%, survival in the conventionaly treated patients was 89%. We investigated the percentage of fulfilment of entry criteria from the following centers at timepoint I (=after admission at the tCU): center 1: PaO21FiO2<70, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP)>50cmH20, MOREL tV, minute volume (VE) >151fmin, 8vO2<60%; center 2:PaO2/FiO2<83 mmHg, PEEP>ScmH20, venous admixture (Qs/QT)>3O%, compliance ((3 L) <30mllcmH20; center 3:PaO2IFiO2<150 with PEEP 10 cmH20, PaCO2>60 mmHg, extravascular lung water (EVLW)>I5mltkg bw, (Qs/QT)>30%, CL<30ml/cmH20; center 4: MURRAY score >2.5, CL<50mllcmH20, PaO2<60 mmHg; center5: slow and fast ECMO-ent~ cdteda. By comparing ELA and non-ELA patients the most significantly different parameters were: PaO2/FiO2<70 in ELA 73% (vs 2,6% in non-El_A), EVLW was 90% (vs 66% in non-ELA), Q$/QT >30 94% (vs 60% in non-ELA) and PaO2<60 in 48% in ELA (vs 18% in non-ELA). There were no differences in the following criteria: PEEP>10, Compl.<50, PaCO2>80 and PCWP<18. From these preliminary results we conclude that investigation of larger patient collectives in different centers could be useful to obtain more relevant data. These four parameters with the most significant differences should be tested prospectively to discriminate patients for ELA therapy from those for conventional treatment. Further studies will be warranted to establish the validity of these entry criteria for a reliable decision in patients with severe ARDS.",

Steltzer, P. Krafft, T. Pernerstorfer, D. Koc, AF Hammerle Hypothermia might play an important role in the achievement of optimal values in oxygen delivery as well as consumption. However, the concept of moderate hypothermia induced by continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVHF) has gained only little attention for the therapy of septic ARDS (1,2). The goal of our investigation was therefore to test the hypothesis that moderate hypothermia enables the achievement of optimal va}ues in oxygen kinetics in patients suffering from septic ARDS. Methods: Over a 24 month period, 27 patients with ARDS and sepsis were recruited to the study, in all patients CVVHF was performed after fulfilment of the following criteda: a) Murray score >2~5, b) hyperthermia of > 38\u00b0C, c) cardiovascular instability requiring inotropic support and fluid resuscitation. Evaluation of oxygen delivery (DO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) was performed every 4 hours. Core temperature (Temp) measured by the pulmonary artery thermistor was targeted at 34,5 to 35,9\u00b0C by CVVHF therapy. Optimal resuscitation and oxygen kinetics ,,,/as defined according Shoemaker et al (3). Linear regression analysis was used to compare the relationship between temperature and oxygen kinetics. Results: Septic shock occured in 10 of 14 nonsurvivors and in 2 of 13 survivors. During moderate hypothermia, the incidence of optimal DO2 was 42 + 21% in nonsurvivors and 25 + 19% in survivors of ARDS (p<0.05). Optimal VO2 was found in 13 + 9% of nonsurvivors compared to 9 + 6% of survivors. The relationship between DO2 and Temp was in the range from 0.3% to 52% in nonsurvivors and from 0.1% to 45% in survivors. Overall mortality of our study patients was 52%. We conclude, that the concept of moderate hypothermia in septic ARDS does not result in either improved DO2 / VO2 relationship or improved survival rates. Moreover, supranormal values for oxygen delivery was attained even more frequent in patients ultimately succumbing ARDS. However, previous studies found both, responders and non-responders to these strategy (1,2). The goal of our study was to investigate the immediate response of oxygen kinetics (i.e. oxygen consumption and delivery) during this procedure. Methods: We investigated 12 patients (age 19-72; 3 males) after severe trauma (ISS 35-75) requiring mechanical ventilation for more than one week. Further entry criteria were: PaO 2 <100 with pressure limited IRV (max. 35mmHg, I:E=2:1) at Fie 2 > 0,5 and PEEP > 8mmHg and radiologic signs of ARDS for > 24 hours following admission to ICU. Immediately before and 30 minutes after each position change respiratory, haemodynamic and oxygenation data were recorded. All patients were monitored by pulmonary artery catheter providing cardiac output by thermodilufion and measurements of arterial (CaO2) and mixed venous (CvO2) oxygen content. Oxygen consumption and delivery were calculated according to Fick's principle. Results: Changing body position from supine to prone resulted in a significant increase in oxygen consumption in 3 out of 12 patients, in one patient a significant decrease in VO 2 eccured. Oxygen delivery increased significantly in 4 out of 12 patients.",

            "text": "CONCLUSION Laryngeal dyspnea, a rare but serious complication of intuhation (43 % of reintubation), appears to be favored by a long-period of intubation. There is no clear correlation between the severity of stridor and laryngeal damage. The failure of steroids given just before extubation has been well documented, but it would be interesting to evaluate their efficacy if administered 24 to 48 hours prior to a scheduled extubation in high risk population. We recently studied the effects of aerosolized prostaglandin (PG) 12 in 3 patients with acute severe ARDS. Doses between 17 to 50 ng/kg-min, nebulized into the afferent limb of the ventilator circuit, decreased the mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP; mean ~-SEM) from 40.3 \u00b1 13.5 to 32.0 \u00b1 3.8 mmHg, whereas the mean systemic arterial pressure (SAP) declined only marginally. Concomitantly, the ratio of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (paO2/FiO2) increased from 119.5 \u00b1 19.3 to 173 \u00b1 17.7 mmHg, largely due to a redistribution of blood flow from shunt areas to regions with normal ventilationperfusion ratios (multiple inert gas elimination technique). All effects were reversible upon withdrawal of the drug. We now extended this approach to patients mechanically ventilated due to severe community-acquired pneumonia. Group A included patients without preexisting tung disease (n = 6), and group B those with underlying chronic fibrotic interstitial lung disease (n = 6). In group A, low doses of aerosolized PGI 2 (mean 6.6 \u00b1 3.0 ng/kg.min) sufficed to decrease the mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) from 35.0 \u00b1 1.5 to 31.0 \u00b1 1.6 mmHg, to improve PO2/FiO 2 from 100 \u00b1 18 to 134 \u00b1 18 mmHg, and to decrease intrapulmonary shunt (36.9 \u00b1 4.7 to 27.5 \u00b1 4.5 %). Systemic arterial pressure (SAP) and cardiac output remained unchanged. In group B, aerosolized PGI 2 was ineffective up to 10 ng/kg'min. At a mean dosage of 33.6 \u00b1 12ng/kg-min, aerosolized PGI 2 reduced PAP (38.0 ~: 2.4 to 30.8 \u00b1 2.1 mmHg), but also decreased SAP (80.3 \u00b1 3.6 to 71.3 \u00b1 4.7 mmHg) and paO2/FiO 2 values (73.8 \u00b1 6.6 to 65.5 \u00b1 6.8 mmHg) and increased intrapulmonary shunt (44.7 \u00b1 3.0 to 49.4 \u00b1 5.0 %). A~er withdrawal of the PGI 2 aerosol, all gas exchange and hemodynamic variables returned to preaerosol baseline values within 60 min. We conclude that low doses of; aerosolized PGI 2 may reduce pulmonary hypertension and improve matching of ventilation and perfusion in the absence of significant systemic effects in patients with severe ARDS and pneumonia However, when interstitial fibrosis is present as underlying disease, manifold higher PGI 2 doses are required for induction of pulmonary vasoditation, then accompanied by systemic vasorelaxation and increased intrapulmonary shunt flow.

Value of alveolar pressure amplitude represents a degree of adverse mechanical effect on the lungs. Optimum ventilation parameters V.r, T~, f, for APA= rain. within the whole frequency spectrum were calculated for newborns with the acute lung failure of different etiology -RDS, meeonium asp., pneumonia. In these pathologic lungs the course of tracheal pressure was analyzed during inspiriual using the constant flow generator and the cuff intubation. The measurements recorded during a progressive increase in PIP showed that above the certain inspiratory pressure limit (P Jingo) a significant nonlinearity of the pressure curve occurred. This can be explained by multi-compartmental model of the lungs with diffuse inhomogenous pathology. Compartments are classified according to severity of injury and are mechanically characterized by different Cdy ~ and P~. A preliminary analysis of inspiratory curves indicates that a percentage of injured compartments might be calculated. The aim of optimum ventilation is to ventilate selectively healthy\" and less injured compartments only and to avoid iatrogenic injury\" due to h~2~erinflation.

This kind of polyneuropathy (PNP), which is characterized by normal nerve conduction velocity and pathological muscle activity can be diagnosed by electrophysiological investigations. Methods: During the period of one year (September 92 -August 93) 22 out of 64 patients of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) suffering from sepsis and MOF (according to the sepsis criteria of B. Montgomery) were included into this prospective study. They were investigated clinically and by electromyography (EMG) / nerve conduction velocity (NCV) at the end of their stay on the ICU and 2-3 months later. As in 42 patients PNP could have been caused by other underlying diseases as well, they were not enrolled into this study.",

Conclusion: Axonal PNP is a frequent complication of sepsis: 72.7% of our patients developed this kind of PNP. If patients recover from sepsis, the neurological prognosis is usually good. some concern for the benefit-risk ratio m the most severe subtypes of stroke. In a prospective pilot study 19 patients (mean age 60 years) were included on the following criteria: permanent hemiplegia within 4 hours before admission, Orgogozo score < 55, no hemt~hage, mass effect or lacune on CT, informed consent, angiographicaUy documented occlusion of relevant intracranial internal t~rotid or middle cerebral artery (excluding branches). Using a superselective technique, urokinase was infused through the thrombus (5000 U boluses ; 300.000 U/ 20 min ; maximal dose : 900.000 U). Results : Mean interval from stroke onset to fibrinolysis was 293~54 min. At least partial reperfusion was observed in t 1 (patients) (58 %) immediately after urokinase (Hi) ; on control angiography (H24) seven of them further improved their grade of reperfusion while the other patients had unchanged angiograms, compared to HI. A distal site of occlusion and leptomeningeal coUateral blo~xt flow were strong predictors of recanalization. Severe mass effect was observed in 12 patients (63 %). Asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation and limited brain hematoma developed in 2 patients respectively, one with clinical deterioration. The 9 patients who did not recanalize had total infarcts, whereas 9/10 recanalized patients developed partial infarcts. Nine patients died (8 of brain herniation including 6 non recanalized and 2 recanalized patients) ; outcome was considered poor in 2, fair in 3, and go~xi in 5 of the alive patients.

Cerebral CO~ vasoreactivity, an important physiologic determinant of cerebral blood flow can be evaluated by modifying PaCO2. Because changes in jugular venous return due to elevated intrathoracic pressure could influence cerebral blood flow, we compared the cerebrovasealar response to acute changes in PaCO 2 (25, 30, 35 and 40 mmHg) obtained by modifying either minute volume (VE, 13.8\u00b13.4 to 7.6-\u00b12.3 l/rain, mean\u00b1SE, p<0.001) or PICO z at constant VE (randomized order), without changing respiratory rate. The study included 33 mechanically ventilated comatose patients without COPD (age 47+3, Glasgow 5.5~-0.4). Cerebral measurements consisted of mean middle cerebral artery velocity (Vm) using transcranial Doppler, jugular blood flow (Qj) by continuous lhermodilution, and jugular bulb oximetry.

Within 30 days after ICH, 285 sterile samples and 35 with bacterial con-tam\u00b1nation were analyzed. Results: Lactate levels were hardly ever within normal limits. They were independent of the type of ICH, clinical grading, and intracranial blood flow velocities, but related to outcome. There was a significant correlation with CSF cell counts (red and white) which were responsible for about 25 % of lactate level variance. After ICH, cell counts dropped logarithmically with time, while the decline of lactate levels was linear. Secondary elevations of lactate levels appeared after aneurysmal rebleedin~ and with meningitis, but not with CSF bacterial contamination alone. Conclusion:",

In patients with supratentorial mass lesions, pupillary enlargement and especially bilateral mydriasis is aonsidered the surest sign of uncal herniation. Jugular bulb oximetry provides bedside continuous information on cerebral blood flow adequacy. In this paper we report on the clinical importance of jugular bulb oxygen saturation (sin2) monitoring in patients developping bilateral mydriasis. Twenty severely head injured pts (GCS<8, supratentorial lesions) develnpping bilateral mydriasis during jugular bulb oximetry monitoring will be discussed. Alt 20 pts developped intraeranial hypertension despite maximal therapy (CSF drainage/hyperventilation/mannitol and barbiturates). In 12 pts we noted a sudden and excessive decrease in jugular oxygen saturation (mean sin2 of 23%). In 4 pts this decrease was noted shortly (5-I0 rain) before pupillary enlargement, in 8 pts after (10-60 rain) pupillary enlargement. In all 12 pts, this sharp decrease in sin2 was followed (withira 5 mira) by an almost immediate increase in SjO2 to extremely high levels (all more than 90%). In 6 of the 8 other pts a slow increase (over 15-60 min) in sin2 was observed to levels of more than 90% . In all these 18 pts with SjO2 of more than 90%, brain death was ultimaltely (12 hours later) confirmed by cerebral angiography, tn 2 pts no change in sin2 occurred and angiography revealed adequate cerebral circulation. In both pts pupillary light reflexes returned to normal again (after 24h and after 3 days respectively). Both survived and had moreover a good neurologic recovery. These misleading pupillary findings may have been the result of treatment sideeffects. Ira one pt administration of catecholamines (a&enaline) may have been the cause. In the other pt, barbiturates in combination with catecholamines may be blamed. Both dangerously misleading situations were indicated by the absence of any change in NO2.",

Especially the side-effects of intensive treatment (cateaholaminas, barbiturates, narcotics, paralyzing agents) can confound the interpretation of pupillary light reflexes and cause misleading and dangerous situations. Jugular bulb oximetry seems to be a readily available bedside help for thesemisleading situations. ICIIT of traumatic or no traumatic origen is present in a high number of patients adnitted to Intensive Therapy Units. Its high 10rthlity and the severity of sequelae that it leaves makes necessary a precocious and energic treatment. Therapy includes, in a pr0toc01ized way, sedation, muscle relaxation, analgesia, hyperventilati0n, osmotic and 100p diuretics, barbiturates and surgery. We study in a retrospective way 174 patients. 100 were traumatized patients with crane0e~caphalic tralma (CET), and 74 patients had ICIIT with no craneouncapllalic trauma (NCET). All patients had intracranenl pressure (ICP) n0nitorized, and it was always over 20 llg en on admittance. Treatment was perf0rued according to ICIIT protocol of our service. We didn't fiM ally statistical difference in relation to age, sex, neur01ogyc structural lesion and therapeutical approach.

Awakaning was better (p<O.O01) and weaniag faster (p=O.O(~)4) in CET group. Couclusians: Our traumatized patientes showed psycholotor agitation at edmittance more frNuent than medical patients, although sedation, awakening weaning were better.

Six of 13 patients, who were operated on,. died. Four patients of the non-operated group died. We observed bleedings due to fibrinolysis in 14 patients (7 men, 7 women) aged 45 to 75. In this group 11 patients underwent an operation, 3 patients were treated conservatively. Four patients died postoperatively, one patie~x in the non-operated group died, The lethali V cau~d by-cerebral reasons was 48 % in the coumarin group and 36 % in the fibri~o!ysis group. The correlation between the neurological symptoms on admission and the postoperative state shows the dependance of the neurological deficits preoperatively and the c.linical outcome postoperatively. This holds true for the lethality. and the quality of Clinical vasospasm is still the greatest danger for patients with acute aneurysmal rupture.

The GCS value was determined by a physician at an average of 22 min and CT was received within 2h after trauma. GCS groups (I-IV) and their outcome were compared with morphological changes of CT: scullfracture (Fx), brain edema (BE), cranial space-occupying lesion (CL).

Fifty-five patients were registered in this period. Sex, age end seasonaldistribution followed the well-known pattern: two peaks in infancy (55~) and adolescence (40~), slight male preponderance and a typical winter/early springtime peak were found. The median incidence was 2.18 cases per lOO.O00 population/year, the annual incidence ranging from 1.1 (1991) to 3.02 (1989). Death rate was 7/55 (12.7%).

Conclusion: our results demonstrate the usefulness of multimodality cerebral monitoring, that represent a modern approach to the brain-injured patient in order to rationalize therapy. Introduction; Controlled hyperventilation serves as an adequate therapy in cerebral trauma patient and is often combined with intravenous administration of anaesthetics. By means of Positron Emission Tomotcraphy (PET) the influence of anaesthetic agents in cerebral blood flow BF) was examined in 20 head injured patients. Method; A determination of CBF in 20 ICU-patients under analgo-sedation of Fentanyl, Midazolam (Don~Jcum), and hyperventilation (COp,t =4%) was performed by means of the ['~O]-H20 PET-method. On the se'56nd course of examination an additional narcotic dose hypnotics was administered. Dosage: Thiopental 5 mg/kg bodyweight iv-bolus and 5 mg/kg bodyweight per hour iv-maintenance or Propofol 2 mg/kg bodyweight iv-bolus and 5 mg/kg bodyweight per hour iv-maintenance. On further examination normoventilation (CO2,~=5,5%) was maintained under continuous narcotic administration. On the-final course of examination the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMR~)1i~) the re-hyperventilated narcotised patient was measured by means Of'[ F]-FDG (Fluor-Desoxy-Glucose)-method. Results: The analgo-sedated and hyperventilated patients showed a mean value of 41.6 ml/100ml tissue/minute CBF. Under the maintenance of hyperventilation and additional administration of hypnotics, there was a mean decline of 18% (33 ml/100ml/min) Under these conditions a CMR of 15.7 ml/100ml t~ssue/mm was measured. Under the ma ntenance g~ narcosis with normoventilation there is a CBF-increase of 134% from baseline-value. Conclusions; The measured CBF-baseline values of analgo-sedated patients represents a reduction of 20% to not-sedated patients in literature. Although the significant decline of CBF under hyperventiIation with additional administration of narcosis in its mean value appeared to be tolerable, however, in particular patients critical values were achieved. The decline of CBF and the simultaneous decrease in glucose turnover is remarkable. The concept of hyperventilation in the management of head injury patients appeared to us to be questionable. The simultaneous application of intravenous narcotics and hyperventilation is obviously dangerous. ",

They got catheters in the femoral vein and artery for i.v. treatment and to measure the blood pressure. The body temperature was measured and regulated by a warming plate. After a lateral craniotomy the inferior cerebral vein was ligated and a very small clip was placed on the middle cerebral artery (MCA) near its origin. It is possible to induce an infarction in 100% of the animals. After removal of the clip the MCA was patent. For this study the animals were devided in three randomised groups. The control group, N=15, got 5 ml NaCI 0.9% during ischemia starting 5 min prior to clipping. The Mannitol group, N=15, got 5.4 ml/hour/kg bodyweight during ischemia starting 5 min prior to clipping. The U74389G group, N=9, got 4.5 mg/kg bodyweight prior clipping in a bolus injection and 1.5 mg/kg bodyweight after removal of the clip. We measured heartrate, blood pressure, extracellular potassium (Ks +) by ionselective microelectrodes. We estimated the regional cerebral blood flow rCBF by laser-doppler flowmeter. The MCA was clipped for 1 hour. After 1 hour reperfusion the brain was fixated and the volume of the brain and the infarction was measured in serial sections.",

Patients with a focal or shunt infection were excluded. CSF cultures were positive in 7 pts, and sterile in 17 (AM). CSF from 31 asymptomatic pts were used as controls. Bacterial DNA in the CSF was researched by PCR using procaryote 16S RNA-specific primers. All but one control gave no amplification with PCR (20 and 25 cycles). All artificially contaminated CSF yielded an amplification product(20 and 25 cycles). Eucaryotic DNA (candida; human placenta) was not amplified. The sensitivity of the technique was equal to 10 s bacteria.ml \"1 with 20 cycles and 10 e with 25 cycles. CSF from bacterial meningitis had a positive amplification at 20 and 25 cycles, although CSF from AM were positive at 25 and negative at 20 cycles. Southern blot hybridization of the amplification products was carried out with a procaryote specific probe: all amplified products from bacterial or AM hybridized, whereas none of the control CSF, negative control or human DNA did. According to this results we can speculate thatsome AM are of bacterial origine. The lack of cultivable bacteria could be explained either by a low amount of bacteria suggested by a positive amplification after 25 cycles only or by a non cultivable organism by conventional methods. The viability and infectious power of these bacteria remain uncertain. identification of the bacteria is on-going by sequencing of the PCR products.",

(study of 62 cases). The diagnosis of meningitis after neurosurgery may be difficult (poor value of the clinical symptoms except CSF leak or focal deficit and of the CSF biochemical and cytologic data). A high mortality is reported (20-50 p.cent) in bacterial meningitis (BM) requiring urgent antibiotic therapy, althought aseptic meningitis (AM) has a much better prognosis and may require corticosteroids. We studied 62 consecutive cases in adults in the neurological ICU (traumas excluded). Meningitisdiagnosis was based on the CDC criteria and a CSF polymorphonuclear (PMN) count over 100, BM was proven in 28 pts (A), CSF remained sterile in 32 (B). A and B were not different according to age (50_+18 y-o), sex ratio (1/2), ASA score (1.5_+0.5), immunosupression (21p.cent), exogenous materials (25 p,cent), emergency surgery (20p.cent), procedure duration (6.5_+2 h). Clinical symptoms were similar: fever>38\u00b0C (all pts), impaired neurological status (45 p.cent), neck stiffness (33 p.cent), agitation (30 p.cent). In group A, 21 p.cent had no symptoms except fever, in group B, 41 p.cent. Diagnosis and antibiotics beginning underwent earlier in group B (5 vs 8 d. after surgery). Symptomatic treatment and antibiotic regimen (2 or 3; 3 weeks at least) were not different. CSF data were not significantly different (A vs B): proteins= 2.5 vs 3 g/L, glucose ratio= .27 vs .29, PMN cells= 2480 vs 1723 G/L. Associated infections were more frequent in group A (78 vs 38 p.cent), mechanical ventilation duration longer (15 vs 9 d), neurological complications more frequent (60 vs 20 p.cent). Forty three p.cent ofgroup A pts died, 21 p.cent 'in group B. These data are consistent with the literature (Ross 1988). Some works gave biological arguments (high CSF levels of LDH 4&5, IL-4, CRP, IgM, GM-CSF, d(-)lactic acid) to the hypothesis of a bacterial origine in many post operative \"aseptic\" meningitis.Bacterial meningitis was more severe in our study. \"Aseplic\" meningitis may be related to:-the intlamatory response to surgery or material; -a bacterial origine (small inocu]um, previous antibiotics, difficulties in the culture). A prospective study to test this later hypothesis is performed: the aim would be to demonstrate the presence of bacterial DNA in the CSF of these patients. The effects of hypocapnia on MLAEP have been studied in 11 adults hospitalized in ICU in relation with neurosurgery or acute cerebral suffering. They were in a steady state (haemodynamics, ventilatory and metabolic status,central temperature) with impaired neurological status (Glasgow coma score: 3-I0). The study was divided into 3 periods: steady state (n\u00b0l; 30 min.), hypocapnia (n~2; 60 min.), back to steady state (n~; 120 min.). Hypocapnia was obtained decreasing the ventilatory dead space. Brainstem AEP and MLAEP were recorded and filtered continuously (Neuromonitor.INSERM 280). Haemodynamics, transcranial doppler velocimetry of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), arterial blood gases, central temperature were recorded every 15 min. Data were normalized and compared between periods using paired t test and F test. Hypocapnia was significant in 9 pts. Arterial PCO2 decreasing was -34.4 p.cent in period n~2 (vs n\u00b0l), and increasing value in period n\u00b03 was + 35.2 p.cent (vs n~2). CO2 rectivity was maintained in all subjects. In period n~2, MCA systolic velocimetry was significantly reduced (mean value per kPa: -16 p.cent}, diastolic velocimetry was greatly reduced ( -26 p.cent), A reverse effect was demonstrated in period n\u00b03. Period n\u00b0l and n\u00b03 were similar (gazometric and transcranial doppler data). BAEP (peak V) were not modified. On the opposite, MLAEP were improved, althought remaining abnormal. Na and Pa latencies were shorter, Pa and Pa-Nb amplitudes larger, with a reversible effect, This was remarkable in 6 cases and was not deleterious in the remaining 3.The reduction of ICP (blood volume reduction) may result in conduction (shorter latencies) and neuronal activity (higher amplitudes) improvement. Neuronal excitability may be increased by biochemical changings (local pH, CO2 and Ca++ concentrations). A vascular effect may be advokated in the activation of MLAEP generators (\"inverse steal\" effect). Mild hypocapnia for a short period slightly improved MLAEP in these patients. The effect was reversible. This effect has not been previously described. Normal subjects have to be investigated to determinate weither gazometric conditions have to be considered in MLAEP interpretation.",

Recently, the IV form of this drug was introduced in France, We describe 4 cases of metabolic acidosis (in the last 4 monthes) that may be related to IV.SV. The patients underwent intracranial surgery (malignant turner:2, hypophyse adenoma:l, aneurysm:l) without surgical or anaethesiciogic complication. They were in a steady state (ASA score=l-2), without metabolic or hepatic disease before surgery. Two already received oral SV preoperatively, two did not. IV.VS was introduced at the end of the surgical procedure by means of a continuous infusion,'The rateof infusion was: 15 mg,Kg -1 during 20 minutes and 15 mg.Kg-1 during the following 24 hours. All the patients had a delayed awakening with agitation and prolonged drowsyness, and were disadaptated from the ventilator. Mean arterial pH was below 7.26, S.Bicarbonates below 10 mmoLL-~, PaCO2 below 2.5 kPa. Hepatic enzymes and ammonium were in the normal range, lactate concentration was high (> 4mmeI.L-~ ) in 3 cases. Haemodynamics and respiratory conditions were stable and could not explain the acidosis. The mean delay for the diagnosis after the beginning of infusion was 4 hours. Two patients received no other treatment at this time; two had drugs without such a side effect previously described. Metabolic acidosis and clinical symptoms were cured in the following 4 hours by interrupting the infusion in all cases, plus bicarbonate infusion (42 g,L -1 ; 35 mI.Kg-~ ) in two,. The patients had a favourable evolution and were discharged from ICU 1 or 2 days later,Serum SV levels were below toxic concentrations. Although SV kinetics is well known, the effects and kinetics of its metabolites remain uncertain. A reduction of the lactic acid clearance has been discussed. Awaiting for further explanations, the prophylactic use of this drug in neurosurgical patients might be restricted. A prospective study of the metabolic effects of IV.SV will soon be conducted.",

However, clinical examination is often not sufficient to precise the individual prognosis in the first days. Ethical, medical and economical considerations may be involved in the decision to limit, withdraw or withhold therapeutics. During the last 5 years, 50 pts (age>15) were studied. They had a normal neurological status before the accident. All of them remained comatous (Glasgow coma score<6) 24 hours after a cardiac arrest and were in a steady state (haemedynamics, ventilation, metabolic status, central temperature). They were mechanically ventilated and did not receive any sedative drug. In order to have an idea of the prognosis, EEG, brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), middle latency AEP (MLAEP), and somesthesic EP (SEP) were performed at the bedside in the first 4 days. Patients were paralyzed during the procedure (2-4 hours). Twenty-one pts (42 p.cent) died within the fisrt 2 weeks after stroke. They had abnormal BAEP in all cases, and in most of them had no cortical responses of the MLAEP and SEP. EEG activity was diseontinuated in all, and nearly isoetectric in 2 patients. Twenty pts (40 p.cent) remained in a persistant or chronic vegetative state. They all had normal BAEP, abnormal cortical responses of the MLAEP and SEP, and unreactive EEG. Nine pts (18 p.cent) awoke from coma. They all had severe sequaelae according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale. BAEP were normal. MLAEP and SEP cortical responses were present; latencies were delayed and peak/peak to peak amplitudes reduced. In this study, early electrophysiological data were interesting in the prediction of death or persistant coma. On the opposite, when patients awoke from deep coma, the quality of neurological evolution was not accurately prognosed. Electrophysiotocal data reflect the severity of anoxic and ischemic cerebral suffering: cortical responses are always abnormal or lacking; when subcortical and brainstem responses are abnormal, severe mesencephalum lesions and bad prognosis are expected. Different procedures (cognitive potentials, cerebral blood flow evaluation or PET scan) may be proposed to improve the prediction.",

Uptake of intravenous radiolabelled fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) in the brain reflects the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRg).

Therefore we monitored the kinetics of plasma amino acids in neurosurgical patients during surgery to test for effects of the anesthetics used Method: During anesthesia blood samples were drawn from 28 patients (16 ?,12 c~) every hour: 18 were anesthesized with balanced anesthesia technique (BAL) (isoflurane, fentanyl, nitrous oxide; pancuronium, induction thiopentone) and 10 with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) (propofol, alfentanyl). The blood samples were drawn in a heparine-coated syringe, centrifuged, plasma was deproteinized with I-ICIO3, buffered with K2CO 3, stored at -70\u00b0C and measured by HPLC (OPA pre-column derivatization), Glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, asparagine, alanine, serine, taurine, leucine, lysine, arginine and histidine were determined. Glutamate and aspartate are excitatory neurotransmitters but also neurotoxins. A disturbed blood brain barrier permits the entry of these excitotoxins into the cere-\"--al parenchyma. Therefore we monitored the kinetics of plasma amino acids in ~arosurgical patients during surgery to test for effects of the anesthetics used Method: During anesthesia/surgery blood samples were drawn from 28 neumsurgical patients (16 ~, 12 e') every hour, starting at intubation. 18 patients were anesthesized using isoflurane, 10 using propofol. The blood samples were drawn in a heIrarine-coated syringe, centrifuged, plasma was deproteinized with HCIO 3, buffered with K2CO~, stored at -70~C until measm'ement by HPLC (pre-column derivatization with OPA). Glutamate and aspartate as well as glutamine, asparagine, alanine, serine, tanrine, leucine, lysine, arginine and hisddine were determined. Results: Isoflurane anesthesia caused an increase of most amino acids measured, hut significant only for glutamine (921.0 + 85.6 pM to 1144.56 -+ 110.7 pM), and leucine (187.1 + 17.9 pM to 286.8 + 38.3 pM) if compared to propofol or healthy controls. This effect was still present 8 hours after anesthesia. Glutamate, aspartate, asparagine, alanine, and serine showed a rising tendency during isoflurane anesthesia without reaching significance in the total population. In females, however, the increase of plasma glutamate was significant (66.3 + 10.5 ]aM to 116.6 + 9.2 ~lM). Female patients in general reacted stronger to isoflurane than men. Significant changes: glutamine (955.6 + 112.8 pM to 1421.0 -+ 71.9 pM); asparagine (58.3 + 11.5 pM to 127.7 -+ 45.4 pM); leucine (160.0 t: 31.9 girl to 343.8 + 83.55-,~D. With propofol no statistically significant increases in plasma amino acids re seen. If compared to healthy controls, however, glutamate levels were increased (controls: 49.4 + 5.4; propofol: 143.3 + 293; isoflurane: 122.96 + 13.1). The levels of histidine, arginine and tanrine were not influenced by both anesthetics. Conclusion: Compared to propofol, isoflurane leads to an increase in the concentration of various amino acids in plasma of neurosurgicaUy treated patients, among whom female patients are more susceptible. Isoflurane as well as propofol cause plasma glutamate to smpass the threshold of 100 }aM, a level claimed to be toxic for cultured neurons, and in particular in vivo as demonstrated in animal models. The enhanced effect in female patients remains to be further elacidated.",

Animal experiments have proven that even small elevations of the plasma level are accompanied by increased cerebral damage if the barrier is open, Therefore we monitored the kinetics of plasma amino acids (AA) in neurosurgieal patients who pestsurgically received total parenteral nutrition (TPN), either without glutamate, or with low concentrations of the AA. Method: Blood samples were drawn from 17 neurosurgical patients (5L 12o\") before, one hour after beginning of TPN, followed by sampling every four hours for 24 hours. 10 patients (4~, 60) were nourished with an amino acid infusion containing 3.75 g/I glutamate (25 g/I total AA content). 7 patients (t ~, 6#) received a glutamata-free preparation (50 g,'l AA).

CIP was diagnosed clinically and by electromyography. Patients with known diabetes, uremia, alcoholism or vitamin-deficiency were excluded.All patients proved to have CIP, as was demonstrated by axonal degeneration of peripheral nerve fibres. In 7 patients CIP was demonstrated 6-10 days after admission on ICU (mean 8 days), in 6 patients after 10-21 (mean 12) days. We conclude that: i) all patients with septic shock accompanied by multiple organ-failure develop CIP. 2) CIP is already demonstrable 1 week after onset of shock in 50% of the patients. 3) Our findings suggest that CIP is a substantial part and early event of the syndrome of M.O.F.",

Before being sedated for mechanical ventilation his muscular tone was highly increased with hy~erextension of the neck. Head ultrasound was normal. He had no infection of central nervous system. Laboratory data strongly suggested neonatal septicaemia, though repeated blood cultures and tracheal aspirates were negative. Thirty six hours after admission he became comatose having dilated and non reactive pupils. Blood ammonia level (BLA) was 1435 mikromol/L. For elimination af ammonia 1) exchange transfusion was performed reducing BLA to 836 mikromols/L, thereafter, 2) peritoneal dialysis was introduced immediately. There was a new increase in BLA to 1530 micromols/L next day. By that time we were able to start, 3) plasmapheresis and continuous vane-venous haemodialysis in combination with the ongoing peritoneal dialysis. The drop of BLA from 1530 micromols/L to normal was reached on day 5 of treatment. At the level of BLA 395 mikromols/L the first reaction of pupils to light was detected. The child had repeated convulsions and was on thiopental medication. EEG taken at BLA 1530 mikromols/L showed deeply depressed cortical activity with intermittent outbursts of spike and wave complexes, partially no EEG activity was to be found. Signs of significant neurological improvement and EEG tracing were noted four days after BLA level came to normal and after 6 days he was extubated. Now, at the age of 3 months he is making a good progress showing only moderate muscular hypertonia predominantly of the lower limbs. No long term therapy is needed. He is on normal feeding and repeated blood ammonia levels are within normal range. Method: premeditation is realised with atropine only. Laryngeal endoscopy is done firstly and then if the diagnostic is eonfirmed the laser treatment is effectuated in the same time. Induction of the laryngeal endoscopy is performed in spontaneous breathing with a modified Ayre's T piece. Halothane to 3% is used with nitrous oxide (FiN20 50%). During this induction, an intravenous catheter is inserted, connected to a dextrose 5% with ions. The glottis is always sprayed before any surgical stress with lidocaine 3mg/kg. Monitoring used: ECG, preeordial stetoscope, rectal temperature probe, pulse oximeter, invaalve arterial pressure in the first cases. Drugs used: pentothaI in perfusion in the beginning of the ENT laser surgery in children, propofoI in perfusion in 1990; now, propofol and alfentanil in perfusion and bolus of atracurium if necessary, tlFJV is realized with an Aeutronic 1000. We have realised a metal catheter of 1.8 mm of external diameter through the ENT laryngoscope. It permits good ventilation, and sufficient space for the surgeon. Jet ventilation don't suppress all the risks but we never had ignition or barotrauma. Surgical and anesthesia team must be with full attention. Inhalation mixture is composed of oxygen and air.

            "text": "Introduction: The incidence of fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) in hospitalised patients ranges from 0.14% to 0.4%. In 45% to 90\u00b0,/o of these patients, right heart failure occurs within 2 hours after the onset of symptoms. Cardiopubnonary resuscitation (CPR) in the absence of specific therapy is rarely successful in PE. Pulmonary embotectomy or catheter intervention during CPR can only be performed in larger hospitals. An alternative approach would be systemic thrombolysis. We report the case of a patient with fulminant PE successfully treated with thrombolysis during CPR. Case reoort: A 60-year-old female patient collapsed and became dyspneic and cyanotic 21 hours following exploratory laparotomy. Examination showed the systolic blood pressure to be 60 mmHg, heart rate 128 bpm, and arterial pO 2 59 mmHg (despite oxygen mask). The ECG revealed a new incomplete right bundle-branch block accompanied by an SIQII I pattern. Within 30 minutes, CPR had to be initiated due to ciculatory deterioration. Following 20 minutes of unsuccessful CPR, 2,000,000 units of urokinase were injected because of suspected PE. 10 minutes after induction of thrombolysis, the circulation could be stabilised. There was no evidence of bleeding complications despite the postoperative status of the patient. She survived showing temporary paresis of the right arm due to an ischemic cerebra[ focus. Discussion: In our opinion, thrombolysis made a definitNe contribution to this success of CPR in PE. Three years ago, we reported another case of successful thrombolysis during CPR in PE) Even if myocardial infarction is misinterpreted as PE, thrombolysis may be an appropriate therapeutic measure during CPR)2 We conclude, that high-dose thrombolysis is a generally available and promising therapeutic concept in fulm[nant PE necessitating CPR ( fig.) . presumingly results also in a increased pulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt). We investigated Qs/Qt and paO~ after traction on the mesentery root and the transpulmonary prostacyclin levels in a prospective placebo controlled study with intravenous ibuprofen. Methods: With approval of the Human Investigation Review Board we studied 52 patients in a prospective, randomized double-blinded protocol who were scheduled fbr major abdominal surgery. Ibuprofen (400 mg i.v.) or a placebo equivalent was administered t5 minutes before skin incision. Pulmonary artery thermodihition and radial artery catheters were placed after induction of anesthesia. MT was applied in a uniform fashion. Baseline values preceded the incision of the peritoneum (t0). Further assessments followed 5, 15, 30, 45, 90 and 180 minutes after MT (tl-6). The plasma concentrations (pc) of 6-keto-PGF~ (stable metabolite of PGIe) were determined in arterial and mixed venous blood by radioimmunoassay. At all points in time we measured arterial and mixed venous blood gases. Qs/Qt was calculated by standard formula. Data are given as median (p< 0.05 placebo vs.",

Conclusion: Our data clearly indicate that me,~nteric traction response includes a critical rise in Qs/Qt followed by aigrdfieam decrease of paO v Stable oxygen transport determinants following cyclooxygenase inhibition signify an action mediated by prostacycIin.

Sudden death is due to natural, rapid and unexpected cause and happens in a very short period from the beginning of the symptoms, in apparently healthy people. Up to now there is not a common accordance about the time intercorring between the first symptoms and the death, in order to define \"sudden\" the event. Materials & methods: people dead in the emergency ward of Pavia's main hospital (Policlinico S.Matteo) from I.I.90 until 31.12.92; people dead within 1 hour from the beginning of the symptomsl death verified also by ECG; no violent deaths considered; on all bodies autopsy performed in the medico-legal Institute of Pavia's University;casuistry data set in a data base personal computer; aspects considered: sex,age,identity code,origin,death time corresponding to arriving time in the emergency ward,date,macro-mi croscopic remarks,cause of death (cardiac or non-cardiacS. Results: 3 years: 211 cases of sudden death, 148 male (70,1%), 63 female (29,9%). 155 for cardiac cause(73,5%), 56 for non-cardiac cause(26,5%). Among cardiac cause: It7 male(75,5%) and 38 female(24,5%). Among non-cardiac cause: 14 cerebral pathology(25%), II lung embolism(19,6%),6 aortic aneurism rupture(tO,7%), 25 neoplastic-degenerative p_a thology(44,7%). In males the most incidence between 60-69 years of age; in females 70-79. Sudden cardiac death more frequent between 6 and 12 a.m. Conclusions: in accordance with Literature: sudden cardiac death is the most frequent cause of death among adults.

In a French Consensus Conference (CC), held in May 1990, the usefulness of SR has been redefined according to Masters' criteria.

In the shortest time after surgicaI intervention, the patients preserve ceils immunosuppression, which is manifested not only in decreasing of total pool of T-and B-tymphocytes. Immunosuppression is connected most probably with hyperproduction of coriisol and vasopersin. It must be also underlined that there were no intracellutar changes in metabolic processes, because the concentration of cyclic nucteotides, remained practically unchanged, tn the nearest postoperative period the necessity appears to homeostatic maintenance of arterial pressure level. The given process is realised by production rise of corfisol, angiotensin 2 and prostaglandin F2a with application point at the level of ar-terioIes and capillaries. Insufficient cAMP level also increases the sensitivity of vessels myocytes to angiotensln 2. Prostaglandin F2c t may intensify the releasing reaction and aggregation of thrombocytes, that provokes the increase of 13-thrombogtobulin synthesis and intensification of the secondary spasm of vessels. Further it may cause the disorders in microcirculation. The changes mentioned above are to be taken into consideration when prescribing the corresponding corregative therapeutics.",

Therefore, the aim of this clinical study was to elucidate the effects of unilateral lung.tissue injury on activation of various mediators during thoracic surgery, Methods: 29 patients were examined for the perioperative release of several prostanoids: prostacyclin (PG12) and thromboxane A 2 ((TXAa) representing pulmonary endothelial reactions; prostaglandin E~ (PGE~ and neopterin standing for macrophage activation; prostaglandin Fz~, (PGF~) and prostaglandin M (PGM) were used to determine lung metabolic activity, and PMN elastase as indicator of the activation of PMN granuloeytes. The patients were subdivided into 2 groups: group I (n=10, control) consisted of patients undergoing thoracotomy but without lung damage, whereas group II patients (n=19) had an additional lung tissue resection due to benign processes. Results: Unilateral lung lesions, surgically induced, lead to an activation of the PMNs; elastase levels were reversibly increased (p<0.01 group I vs: II). The thoracic trauma resulted in a release of PGI2 and TXA~ in both groups during operation. Lung injury, however, intensified those reactions (e.g. TXA 220-fold). The significant elevation of PGF~ concentration in group II was related to the lung tissue damage whereas the pulmonary' metabolic activity remained unimpaired, The surgical trauma per se induced an increase in PGEz but no marked release of neopterin. Conclusion: Though, there was only a small unilateral lung damage during selective surgery this tissue injury produced a release of various vasoactive as well as inflammatory and immunosuppressive mediators. This means that lung tissue laceration would cause a liberation and activation of mediators similar to that in polytraumatized patients, albeit to a less pronounced degree. Our results strongly emphasize the importance of any lung tissue injury regarding the outcome of those patients.",

We report data related to the efficacy of the triage criteria applied on scene, the level of prehnspital care and the trauma severity' after the admission. Methods -AIt the trauma cases were considered: the ambulance group were transported from the urban area, the helicopter from the rural area; the two environments had obviously played an important role in the difference showed by the severity indices of the two population. The data were collected, according to the American College of Surgeons (ACS) suggestions, \"on scene\" (TS, check list for the identification of major trauma), during prehospital care (ml infused, % of cases received >_1000 mI, % treated by IPPV) and after the admission (by ISS determination in the cases admitted to Maggiore Hospital). The triage criteria applied on scene (TS<13 and positivity for the check list) defined the Major Trauma Victims (MTV) to be addressed to the Maggiore Hospital (MH) considered as trar~ma center in our system: this was evaluated by the computation of the over and under-triage level. Results -The two groups are summarized in Tab. 1; the triage criteria based on the TS<13 created an overtriage ratio varying from 13,6% to 30,8% (group heiicopler and ambulance respectively) and undertriage level from 45 to 28%; the ratio due to the \"check list\" criteria showed a higher overtriage and a decrease in the undertriage ratio (70,3% and 22,9% in the helicopter group and 75.0% and 25,0% in the ambulance group)~ The intensity of the prehospital care increased in the groups identified by tire triage criteria: 75% and 40,2% respectively of the cases with TS<13 or with positive check fist received > 1000 ml of infusion; 80% and 20,7% respectively went under IPPV. Furthermore the group admitted directly to ICU showed: ISS>16: 78%; 70,2% infused >1000 ml and 45,2% received IPPV, Conclusions -We conclude that within the population considered the application of triage criteria by an ATLS equipe allowed a proper identification of MTV, with results similar to the ACS guidelines; these groups received more aggressive care since prehospital setting,. The lack of informatinns about the patients not assisted by ATLS equipes does not allow to conclude that these criteria are the co~ect triage tools in the Bologna EMS. Nevertheless these data emphazize the importance of dispatching ATLS teams in the events that need a more appropriate triage and treatment since \"on scene\". Tab The week direct current influence (polarization) on nervous tissue results in cytoskeleton stabilization, steadiness increasing in extremal situations. We have examined influence of polarization of brain cortex in cats after head injury (HI). Severe HI was modelled on 41 cats having been anaesthetised by pentobarbital sodium 50 mg/kg i.p. Animals of the ist (control) group (n=lS) were not treated after HI. Second group animals'(n=23) brain cortex was polarizated by direct current 5 mcA through intracerebral epidural electrode. Inborn reflexes restoration and ECoG-dynamic were studied during 14 days. Mortality in the polarization group was 33.3% vs 56.5% in the control one. Restoration of walking was registered accordingly in 1.7 and 3.2 days after HI. Food reflex restoration in the polarization group was occured in 1.86 day, in the control group -in 3.25 day after HI.

Five professional emergency physicians worked in the physicianmanned emergency care unit (PECU) on a 24 hours/day basis, For patients outside Helsi~ the emergency care system on scene was BLK Study hypothesis: As there existed two different emergency care systems for blunt trauma victims transported to the same trauma center, the eventual benefit of ALS on-scene by professional emergency physicians was analysed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 263 consecutive blunt injury victims with serious blunt injuries were reviewed for age, sex, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Revised Trauma Score (F-RTS) upon admission, accident type and location, total transportation time to hospital starting from the call receipt, level of prehospital care, the first pulse rate and blood pressure at hospital, initial laboratory values, the time of treatment at the trauma center and the short-term outcome. RESULTS: The mean age was 38.5 years (15-89), with 68% men and 32% women. The average T-RTS was 10.1 (0-12) and ISS 26.7 (4~75), Most of the injured were from MVA's (47%). 22% of the patients were already intabated and 5.7% had chest tubes upon admission. The average amount of i.v. infi,ions given before the hospital was 1490 ml. The first systemic blood pressure 0317) in hospital was 1t7 (0-170) mmI-lg and the first heart rate (FIR) was 90/rain (0-150), The first arterial BE was -4.0 (-18.6 to +3.2) and the first pH 7,35 (6.97-7.56). Most of the patients were either discharged home or transferred to another hospital after an average of 23 days of treatment. Total hospital mortality was 15.2%. The patients from inside Hdsiuld were older and more commonly intubated when compared to those transported from the outskirts. As the probability of survival correlates with T-RTS values the number of patients at different score levels was calculated, The total proportion of patients from inside Helsinki and outside Helsinki was 103/160 ~ 2/3. This proportion was reversed in T-RTS classes 4 to 8 in a statistically significant way (X%6,91; p =0,008) suggesting the PECU has been able to reach the hospital with 12 patients more (92%) than would be the case without it. When comparing patients treated by PECU with those not seen by the unit inside Helsiuld the T-RTS was lower 8.9 v. 10.5, ISS higher 296 v, 215, more patients were intubated 52% v. 9% and more had i.v. lines 98% v. 56%. No difference was seen in transportation times despite procedures done in the field. T-RTS, ISS, BP, pulse rate and BE could be used as prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: The PECU provides a chance for patients with multiple injuries to get into the trauma center for optimum care and to survive. This is a reasonable goal since we know that on the long run those who survive will de very well Deparlment of Oahopaedics and Traumatology, University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland Severe trauma causing heavy tissue damage affects on several ways the immune system, especially the regulatory cytokine network.

It is beyond doubt that the immune system is severely compromised by trauma, surgery and intensive care. Following major trauma, immunocompetent cells and their products interfere with mediators of stress and inflammation in a highly complex manner rendering the host highly susceptible to infective organisms. In order to reduce the risks of posttraumatic infection early enteral feeding has been advocated. This prompted us tc evaluate the beneficial use of an enteral diet supplemented with the immunomodulatory agents arginine, RNA and omega-3 fatty acid (IMPACT\u00ae) on cellular immune functions. 13 polytraumatized patients (median age 32.5 yrs, APACHE II scores ranging from 10 to 22) were admitted to the intensive care unit. They all required mechanical ventilation and total parentaral nutrition (TPNI. Entaral nutrition (EN) was started between days 4 end 7 after admission and continued for a minimum of 7 days. The application was by eontinous infusion (50ml/hr) via a nasogastric tube. Application rates were increased over a period of 2 days with a concomitant reduction of parse(oral nutrition. Peripheral blood was drawn at 09:00 a.m. on the day prior to starting EN (day O) and on days 1, 4 and 7 of complete EN. After density gradient centrifugetion peripheral blood mononuclear Iymphocytas (P[3ML) were incubated with various mitogens (PHA, Cm~A, PWM) and pulsed with tritiatad thymidine (3H-Thd). Polymorphonuclear leukocytas (PMNLI were sedimented over a dextran column and their capacity to generate reactive oxygen radicals in response to a stimulatary oligopeptide (fMLP) was measured using a fluorimetrlo assay. PBML harvested on day 4 showed a significantly (p<O.05) lower rate of 3H-Thdincorporation when compared to PBML harvested on day O. This effect was observed with both PHA and PWM as mltogen[c agents. A non-significant increase in the rate of 3-Thduptake was detectable when comparing PBML harvested on day 4 and on day 7. In parallel, the oxidative burst in PMNL harvested on day 4, was significantly reduced in relation to PMNL harvested on day O end on day 1, respectively. A significant increase of the oxidative burst rate occurred in PMNL on day 7 when compared to the preceding time point (day 4h During and shortly after transitioning from TPN to supplemented EN the proliferative capacities of both PHA and PWM sensitive PBML are reduced. The oxidative burst during that period is simiIadly affected. In the present set of data, the observed phenomena might as well be attributed to otherwise immunosuppressive conditions during that very period. Temporary exhaustion and/or delayed recruitment of functionally mature cell populations might be discussed as an underlying cause. On day 7 of supplemented EN both proliferative capacities of PBML and respiratory burst rates of PMNL exposed an increase ]n comparison to the preceding levels.",

No one has so far demostrated definitely which is better or to which protocol is is advisable to attain.We review the experience of our dispatch centre in the period 1990-92.

An helicopter is also available,flying in Visual Flight Rules. The rescue team is composed of 1 Medicine Doctor, Specialised in Anaesthesia and Intensive Care and 1 Nurse with long experience in Intensive Care: both are proficient in Emergency Medicine and Trauma Care.Patients are stratified in politrauma, trauma,neurosurgical and Intensive Care patients depending on the presumed main lesions and techniques used to sustain vital parameters;other variables are considered such as mechanism of trauma and aggravating factors;trauma sore was used as a global severity index whereas Glasgow Coma Scale scored conscience disturbances. Results: 698 patients were evaluated, 70% had a TS of 8 or higher, 28% of 7 or lower. 447 patients (64%) patients needed subsequent transl~3rt to an ED by ambulance or helicopter. 96 patients were dead before arrival of the team while 83 died despite resuscitation on the scene.

Glucose infusion increased VCO 2 aad consequently VE; VO 2 and MER were not significantly affected. The increase in VCO 2 was related to time with an increase of 1.7 mt/min,% for the first eight hours; stopping the infusion led to a reduction of VCO 2 of about 1.9 mt/min/h during the first eight hours a~er the stop, In conclusion, Prognosis and outcome of severe injured (polytraumatized) patients is determined by the possible development of multiorgan failure (MOF). It is caused, among the direct traumatic organ damage, by the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The development of SIRS could be triggered by an activation of the inflammatory mediator cascade after translocation of endotoxin from the intestine into the circulation. The goal of presen study was to answer following questions: 1. Is the endotoxin translocation measurable during the early phase after the trauma? 2.

At the end of the observation period, the frequency of measured endotoxin peaks in plasma was reduced.Thera was no significant correlation between the intensity of endotoxemia and the development of MOF during the later posttraumatic period. Also, there was no significant correlation between the existance of TNFc~ in plasma and MOF development.Interestingly, there was a strong correlation between observed plasma TNFc~ and 11.-6 peaks: TNF~ peaks were reflected by an increase in 1!_-6 plasma level after 6 hours.The intensity of plasma IL-6 increase corresponds to the later development of MOF: the patient group with higher MOF-Score (Gods) revealed more distinct plasma IL-6 peaks during the early period after traumatic injury. Gastro-intestinal bleeding (GIB) is still a serious complication in burn patients. To assess the efficacy of enterai nutrition alone in the prophylaxis of stress ulcersf a retro/prospective study was performed. The study included 526 patients with retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Two hundred fifty three patients received a pro-ph~laxis with H2/antacids, 273 received enteral nutrition alone. Both groups were comparable in TBSA (32~1%)~ ABSI (7,4), age, sex, days of ventilation: ICU treatment, and concomitant diseases. GIB was defined according to the Lacroix criteria. The frequency of clinically insignificant GIB in the prophylaxis group was 15,8%, in 2,15% a clinically relevant GIB was diagnosed.

Difficulties regarding the establishment of the required intravenous lines for this purpose are well known to all those dealing with the polytrauma patient in the field. The administration of small volume of\"hypertonic saline\" -NaCI 7.5%-in order to restore intravascular volume has been recently introduced, based on experimental data, in certain countries of the western hemisphere(1). We undertook this study in order to examine the efficacy of this method in the resuscitation of polytrauma patients on the site of accident. Methods. Forty polytrauma patients were included in the study assigned randomly to two groups of 20, comparable regarding their demographic data and trauma severity score. Within t0 to 50 minutes after the emergency call the resuscitative team had established an intravenous line and administered either 250ml of NaCI 7,5% {group A}, or Lactated Ringer's (LR) {group B} at the greatest possible flow. In group A, LR was subsequently administered as a routine. Measurements of systemic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), urine production, and clinical evaluation of the patients' condition, were obtained ini~ally and every lOminutes tilt the hospital admission. Results. A faster haemodynamic improvement was observed in group A, reported elapsing time less than 5minutes, compared to a greater than 20minutes time in group B. In both groups, successful resuscitation had been achieved, with the exception of 3 cases of uncontrollable bleeding, as it was judged by the hospital receiving team, No differences were mentioned, regarding patients' outcome, from both groups. Conclusions. Administration of 250ml NaCI 7.5% solution to multi-injured patients at the accute setting of the accident site provides a unique inexpensive volume replenishment within short time, does not require large-bore intravenous lines, and improves rapidly the haemodynamic profile. Final outcome does not seem to be affected by the kind of resuscitative fluids, at least under the conditions of the present study; the attainment of favorable haemodynamics remains the crucial factor.

Abdomen and thorax are searched for free fluid as an indirect sign of organ laceration and/or direct organ lesion. To evaluate the reliability of US concerning the indication:to operation in cases with BATT, we compared US diagnosis to intraoDerative findings, or clinical outcome in conservatively treated patients, in 1151 cases admitted between jannuary 1980 and jannuary 1990. Of 645 patients with pathologic US findings, 407 were operated on 238 were treated conservatively. \" Unnecessary \" laparotomies were performed in 12 cases (US=false positive In 503 of 506 patients with unremarkable initial US examination, clinical outcome confirmed US diagnosis.

US in the diagnosis of BATT showed a sensitivity of 99%, specifity of 98%, positive predictive value (ppv) of o,97 and negative predictive value (npv) of 0,99. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a Iack of a correlation between the degree of blood loss and the ET-1 level. This could be a consequence of: (a) the small total volume of blood in the rat used or (b) the insensitivity of the currently used test for ET-1 determination. Therefore further investigations of ET-1 in small animal models should be performed only when an ET-1 determination test with a higher sensitivity allowing a smaller sample volume is available.

HES~ILTO In the first 24 hours after admission we determined their APACHE If score anO administered a QL questionnaire that classifies critical p^Aatients into different bvels according to their score: a score < L point corresponds to level I (normality), i -5 points level If (pharmacologic dependence), 6 -10 pointe level Ill (work changes) and > 10 points level IV (dependence on environment). This questionnaire was administered again 12 aod 24 months after ICU discharge. RESULTS. On ICU admission the median scores were: Clinical alterations of imunological status following injury parallel quantifialble changes in lymphoid compartment morphology and cellSlar phenotype,T-cell dependent or cell -mediated imune functions,and alterations in B-production of imunoglobulins.The status of cell-mediated imunity appears to be reflected by the helper /inducer and suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocyte ratio.

We recommend the use of the \"classical\" Se, ldinger technique with a separate guidewire and the use of pul)a~rethane catheters in preference to Teflon to m~ximise catheter life after insertion. We compared percent changes in TCO and MD, pulmonary wedge pressure and corrected ejection time, systemic vascular resistance and ejection distance to peak. Measurements were recorded before induced hemodynamic changes and five minutes after each test. Statistical analysis consisted of correlation coefficient measurement, linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman method, P value less than 0,05 was considered statitically significant. During the study, TCO varied from -100% to +150%. Correlation coefficient (r) between percent change in MD and percent change in TCO was 0.588 (p<0.001). Bland-Altman method gave a bias (mean difference) of 8,67% with limits of agreements of 81%. There was no correlation between other variables. EAD can be used to monitor trend of changes in cardiac output. In the study, bias may be caused by the wide hemodynamic changes and CSA variations. (1) To define confidence intervals for these parameters, (2) to study their distribution and (3) to compare these distributions, I16 hemodynamic profiles (46 decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), 76 septic shock (SEP) has been studied. s~,q{ and ISVR units are respectively dynes.s/era5 and dynes.sm2/cm5. In CHF group, SVR have an anarchic distribution (mean=t084) which cannot be approximated by any distribution. tn return, ISVR have a uniform law distribution between 700 and 3800; RVS distribution peaks seem to be due only to corporeal area variations. In SEP group, RVS distribution can be adjusted with a logarythrnico-normal law (mode=650, 95% confidence interval [350, 1900] ). ISVR show a more outspread distribution from 400 to 3500; 2 sub-populations can be identified: patients with CI < 3 (n=27) and patients with CI > 3 (n=49). Each of these subpopulations has a logarythmico-normal distribution: in IC<3 group, mode=1750 and confidence interval=t1500,2700]; in IC>3 group, mode=850 and confidence interval=t750,2000]. These 2 subpopulations differ in significant differences in age, pulmonary systolic arterial resistances and indexed pulmonary vascular resistances. Conclusion: the use of indexed vascular resistances eliminates artefacts due to corporeal area and individualize sub-populations. Vascular resistances should be systematically indexed.

Bader Introduction: Pneumonia is still considered to be the infection most commonly causing death worldwide, In addition to symptomatic treatment, it is therefore of great importance to choose an antibiotic agent, wich is effective in ille treatment of all pathogens in question, is tolerated well and does not induce resistance during treatment. Tazobactam/Piperacfllin is a newly developed broad-spectrum antibiotic, in which the ureidopanicillin Piperacillin is protected by the betalactamase inlfibitor Tazobactam against inactivatio, by bacterial enzymes. Tazobacttun/Piperacillin has proven to be very effective in vitro and is marketed in a daily dosage of 4,5 g for treatmen~ of lower respiratory tract infections. Methods: The goal of this open, multicenter study was to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerance of Tazobactam/Piperacillin given 3 x 2,5 g i.v. for treatment of lower respiratory trao infections. 1 [9 hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract intections (96 community-acquired and 23 nosocomlal) were treated an average of 8,4 days with Tazobactam/ Piperacillin. Acute pneumonia was diagnosed in 53 cases (44,5%), acute bronchopneumonia in 48 cases (40,3 %) ,and acute purulent bronchitis in 18 (15,1%) cases. 84 (70,6%) suffered from one or mo~ underlaying diseases. Prior to treatment, 105 (88.2%t of the patients demonstrated anJ-or bilateral. pulmonary infiltrates. 25 patients had previously been treated with antibiotics for an average of 6.4 days without success. Results: Of the 62 pathogens isolated before therapy with Tazobactara/Piperacillin, predominant pathogens were streptococcus species (incl, streptococcus pneumoniae) 27,4 % and staphylococcus species (including cnagulase negative strains) 20.9 %. 42 patients and 75 pathogens were evaluable. Pathogens were era-dicated in 36 patients. In 4 patients pathogens persisted and in 2 patients a superlnfection developed. A clinical success was documented hi I01 patients (84.9%). No improvement in 3 patients (2.5%), 15 of the patients were not evaluable, 9 patients (7,6%) developed adverse reactions and 3 patients were withdrawn from the study (2 laboratory fiudings, 1 nausea)_ Conclnsinn: Tazobactam/Piperacillln at a daily dosage of 3 x 2.5 g has proven to be an effective and well tolerated antibiotic for the initial treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.

Gastric colonization has been assumed to be a risk factor of Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

We evaluated the influence of intragastrie acidity, as meausured with continuous intragastrie pH monitoring (CIpH), on colonization rates of stomach, oropharynx and trachea in 112 mechanically ventilated ICU-patients. Results: Colonization with Enterobaeteriaceas and Psendomonas aeruginosa was studied for the first 10 days in ICU (Table  1) , and all CIpH measurements were performed within this period. The median pI-I and % of time with pH<3.0 were calculated for colonized (col.+) and noncolonized (col.-) patients. All patients received sucralfate (S) or antacids (AA) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Conclusion: Intragastrie acidity influenced gastric colonization. However, colonization of oropharynx and trachea was not related to intragastric acidity.

Monitoring of every HELLP patient in an ICU facility is therefore advocated by some authors to prevent and treat ensuing complications (Giom It Obst Gin 1993;3:233-63). We will report our five },ears ('88:93) experience. During this period we observed 3 t HELLP cases; six patients (19%) required ICU admission. Mean maternal and gestational age in the ICU group were 29.5 \u00b1 3.0 years and 30.7 \u00b1 5.7 (range 23-39) weeks respectively. Four patients underwent cesarean section and two vaginal delivery with one perinatal death. Time interval between hospital admission and delivery was 38 his in average (range 1-90 hrs) and time between delivery and ICU admission ranged from 4 to 31 hrs. Trends of the most important laboratory parameters eh~'acterizing the syndrome are reported in the following Uncontrollable hypertension requiring aggressive treatment with rapid deterioration of the hematological parameters was the leading cause of admission in all patients. In addition, three patients had at least one organ dysfunction at ICU admission (left ventricular failure with shock and pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, eclampsia); these patients required hemodynamic monitoring with a Swan-Ganz catheter. DIC, easily corrected by FFP infusion, was presem in 4 patients. Three patients underwent plasmapheresis while all received FFP and PRBC. Mean ICU stay-was 7.1 \u00b1 6.6 days (range t.8-18.5 days). Two patients had a multisystem involvement with left ventrienlar failure, respiratory dysfunction requiting PEEP and acute renal failure (one treated with bemofiltration); one patient died. Obstetrical complications were one hysterectomy due to placenta acereta and the drainage of an infecled surgical hematoma leading to bacteremia.. Maternal complications of HELLP syndrome develop mainly in the early post partum period. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hematological parameters is therefore essential after delivery. ICU admission is required whenever an organ dysfunction ensues or there is u rapid deteriorution of hemolysis indicators. Plasmapheresis and FFP transfusions are still controversial. Continuous enteral feeding (CEF) has been associated with decreased gastric acidity, thereby stimulating gastric colonization and increasing the risk for Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in critically ill patients. Intermittent enteral feeding (IEF) could induce a temporary rise in gastric acidity, thereby decreasing both gastric colonization rates and the risk on VAP. We prospectively studied the influence of IEF (18 hour/day) and CEF (24 hour/day) on gastric and oropharyngeal colonization. Intragastric acidity was measured with computerized continuous intragastrie pH monitoring (CIpH). Patients were randomized to receive IEF or CEF. Cultures for microbiological analysis were performed daily. Patients wore deemed colonized when colonization, present on admission, persisted, or when colonization was acquired during study. ( Sueralfate (S), used for stress bleeding (SB) prophylaxis in ICU-patients, has been associated with decreased incidence of Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). In contrast to antacids (AA) or H2-antagonists, it has been claimed that S does not influence gastric acidity, thereby resulting in lower gastric pH-values and interrupting the gastropulmonary route of colonization. However, the efficacy of S has never been studied in a double-blind fashion, with accurate methods to study intragastric acidity and establish the diagnosis of VAP. We evaluated the effects of S (1 g/q.4h.) and A.A (30 ml/q.4h.) in a prospective randomized double-blind fashion. Patients were stratified on initial gastric pH (<3.0 or >3.0). Gastric acidity was studied with continuous intragastric pH-monitoring (CIpH). Bacteriologic cultures from gastric aspirates, oropharyngeal swabs and tracheal aspirates were performed on admission and twice weekly. VAP was diagnosed with PSB and/or BAL. Potential pathogenic microoganisms (ppmo) included Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas acruginosa. Results: Two groups, comparable regarding demographic characteristics on admission, were studied: 74 AA and 67 S. Measurements of intragastrie acidity, with CIpH, was performed in 112 patients (58 AA, 54 S), with a mean of+75 hours.",

Arterial blood gas analyzers can also measure some of the biochemical parameters, particularly electrolytes, besides the blood gases. However, blood gas analysis are potentially affected by several factors. Our aim was to determine some of the conditions inwhich arterial blood sample analysis were affected. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 50 patients undergone major operations under general anaesthesia were accepted. At least 20-30 minutes after the commencement of the artificial ventilation,arterial blood samples were taken from the patients. 8 samples of 1 ml were taken from each patient. 4 of 8 samples were collected to plastic and remaining to glass syringes. Those 8 groups of samples were stored in different conditions and then analysed. RESULTS: pH of the samples were decreased significantly during storage for both types of syringes. Although PO 2 was decreased slightly during storage, too, there wasn't any significance for both types of syringe. SatO2, Hct, and Na + didn't change. However K + decreased within glass syringes and increased within plastic syringes during storage insignificantly. While Ca ++ levels of samples within plastic syringes didn't change, there was a significant decrease during storage for glass syringes. DISCUSSION: During the last decade, with the developing technology, arterial blood gas analysers could be used for other biochemical measurements, particularly for electrolytes. Those are also important determinations in diagnosis and therapy of the critically ill. In our results, some of the blood gas analysis parameters changed with delaying insignificantly. It seems that type of syringe didn't affect the results, except some electrolytes. Particularly, Ca ++ levels were significantly affected during storage within glass syringes. In conclusion, blood gas analysis should be made bedside. If time delay is supposed to be, results, particularly electrolytes, may not be within reliable limits.",

The haemodynamic index of the human organism following massive haemorrhage and blood transfusion is in a direct relationship with the physical and chemical properties of the transfused blood. The~im of our study was to assess the vanat,ons m the haembdynamic parameters by two clinical groups of patients, undergo nge ect ve vascu ar surgery and massive transfusion of equivalent i volumes homologous (n=12) or autologous blood (n=t2). By all patients investigated, the following haemodynamic parameters (MAP, RAP, PAP, PcwP, CO, CI, SVRI, PVRI, RVWI, LVWI) have been monitored routinely, using Thermodilution catheter, S*W Monitor and Cardiac Output Calculator -Deseret 1000. The results from our comparative study allow us to conclude that the pulmonary vascular reactivity (PAP, PcwP, PVRI) has been preferentially influenced. We postulate that the summary and especially the functional characteristics of the changes and tendencies in the haemodynamic status are more adequate after reinfusion of autologous blood in comparison to homologous transfusion (r=O,72; p less than O,O5), The massive transfusion of homologous blood leads to overloading of the physiological compensatory mechanisms in the different compartments of the circulation and increases the incidence of posttransfusion complications. It is apparent that patients, underwent massive blood transfusion, need an intensive follow-up, including routine monitoring of the dynamic changes in basic haemodynamic parameters (PAP, PcwP) and this is of clinical relevance for adequate decision-making in the management of such patients. Objective : Evaluate the effect of IABP on regional splanchnic blood flow. Methods : In 8 critically [11 patients (mean Apache II score : 19 \u00b1 2) requiring IABP for postoperative support (7) and endstage congestive heart failure 11 ) we evaluated cardiac output (CO) (thermodiluSon technic) and coeliac blood flow velocity (pulsed wave doppler 2,5 MHz) before weaning from IABP. Selection of the patients was based on the possibility to obtain good visualisation (cotour-doppler) of the coeliac artery, using a subxyphoid approach. Coeliac artery was choosen because of the expected good alignement with the ultrasonic beam. Comparative doppler data (with and without diastolic counterputsation) were obtained during periods of 1:3 IABP while cardiac output measurements were performed during periods of standby (5 rain,) versus 1:1 IABP. Results : IABP does not modify peak systolic velocity (PSV), but increases significantly mean coeliac flow velocity (MFV) and systolo-diastolic flow velocity integral (FV~) (table I) without changing R-R interval. At the time of weaning stopping IABP does not significantly modify CO (table II) , Five patients eventually died (2 in overt eardiogenic shock); necropsy examination showed severe ischemic injuries of the digestive tract in 2 of the 3 \"succesfuWy\" weaned patients. ConcLusions : IABP increases the coeliac flow velocity integral by 33 %. Because 1) stopping IABP does not modify CO and 2) IABP does not modify the systolic component of coeliac flow velocity, this effect may be related to an IABP induced diastolic redistribution of the ejected blood volume. Similar improvement in coronary flow velocity integral has been recently proven, using a doppler technic (1). ",

Setting: University .inflated, tertiary level medical center. Patients: A series of 20 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of acute delirium tremens. Methods: Patients with severe delirium tremens and the presence of tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, hyperpyrexia and autonomic dysfunction were began on a continuous infusion protocol of propofol for sedation, cloaldine for autonomic control, and esmolol for control of tachycaxdia, Level of sedation assessed by the Ramsay Scale and computer processed cerebral function was monitored continuously. Results: The initial mean Ramsay score of 1.0 dropped between 4.45 -5.4 during the first three hours of propofol infusion and was maintained throughout the period of sedation. Mean total dose of propofol administered was 16.4 g +/-11.55 g (range 24,84g-459.54 g) and the mean infusion rate throughout the study was 2.73 +/-1.13 mg/kg/hour. The duration of infusinu varied from 29 to 129 hours (mean 70.85 +/-26.37). Moderate decrease in MAP was observed from 117.1 to 106.8 mm Hg (ns). Mean heart rate slowed from 125.6 +/-15.3 to 108.9+/-15.4. Cerebral function depicted easily interpretable brain wave patterns consistency with sedation that rapidly reflected neuronal activity changes with drug regimen titration. Conclusions: We present the successful use of multi-layer treatment for delirium treatment using propofol in a closely tltrated continuous infusion, the alpha-2 agonist clonidine and the ultra-short acting, cardioselective beta-adrenergie antagonist esmolol, and continuous cerebral function monitoring to assess impact of treatment at the neuronal level",

Introduction: The treatment of diabetic keto-acidosis (DKA) is well standardized (Walker, Diab Met Rev 1989; 5:651-63) and is applicable in emergency dpt. However, some patients (pts) will need more intensive surveillance and therapy. Objective: To access intensive care mortality and morbidity of severe (pH<7,25) DKA, and to define pts at risk of complicated evolution. Methods: Retrospective study of 70 consecutive episods of DKA (pH 7,04+0,t 1, HCO3-3,85_+2,17 and serum glucose 31,3_+12,5 retool/l). Group A was defined by one or more of: acute renal failure persistent after rehydratation (ARF), bacteremia (Bact), coma: GCS<12 persistent at the 6th hour, cardio-respiratory arrest (CRA), use of: mechanical ventilation (MV), Swan-Ganz catheter (SGC), vasopressors (VP), blood transfusion > 1/2 blood volume in 24h (BT), sedation -VM excluded (Sed), surgery. Group B was defined by none of these events. A and B were compared using a Student t-test. Results: ARF 2 pts;bact 3 pts; coma 7 pts; CRA 2 pts, of whom 1 died; MV 7 pts (mean duration 1 ld, range 1-27); SGC 3 pts; VP 2 pts; BT 1 pt; Sed 1 pt; surgery 6 pts. Group A covered 22 !0ts (31,4% of total population). A and B differed significantly from each other with respect to age (43,3_+16,1 vs 33,6_+15,3y, p=0,018) and SAPS (19,7-+5,2 vs 15,5_+4,5, p=0,0015) . There was no difference between A and B regarding at diabete history, hemodynamic and biologic parameters at the admission, except at hematocrit (41,54_-_7,1 vs 47,8_+5,9%, p=0,0005). The metabolic supportof the 12 first h was the same, except colloid infusion (432_+7t2 vs 106+294mt, p=0,0088). At the t2th h, serum glucose was higher in group A (20,9-+8,6 vs 12,9_+6,6mmol/1, p=0,0002) and tachycardia was more persistent (AHR 1, (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) 4_+21, p=0, 003) . Stay in ICU was longer in group A (8,55+_7,96 vs 3,12+_ 1,35d, p=0,0001 ). Conclusion: The need for ICU therapy is frequent in severe DKA (31,4%) and concern older pts, probably because of associated pathology. At this price, mortality is very low (1,4%) . To delineate the potential benefit of digestive prokinefie therapy in the prevention of endogenous nosccomial lmenmonia, we determined the bacterial count of the gastric contents (C-C) and the sequence of gastric, ~opba.,yngeal (OR) and tracheal (TR) colonization in patients treated with and without the motilln receptor agonist Erythromycin, whose potent gastrokmetle effect has been recently demonstrated m enneally 111 patients . 25 patients matched for age, admission Apache n score, immunosuppression, ongoing antibiotherapy and expected to remain under mechanical ventilation for >-3 days were randomized to receive either Erythromyein (200 mg IV every 6 hours) (n=12) or conventional treatment (Control) (n=13). Each patients received renitidine as stress ulcer prophyllaxis. Gastric cxxatents, OR and TR secretions were sampled daily for 5 days unless early extubation. Comparison between both groups was made on the semiquantitative microbial numeration (gastric contents) and on the sequence of colonization (GC-0R; 0R-TR) provided that a same germ was identified on two contiguous sites at any time.

No preferential sequence of colonization is observed (stomach, oropharym\u00a2, traehea); 3. The total gaatfie microbial numeration and the sequence of colonization are not modified by digestive prokinefie therapy with Erythromycin, The problem of medication therapy treating myocardial infarction is still a matter of controversy in spite of numerous field trials. In this study a series of 50 internists were approached to answer questions concerning the following condition as to their proposed treatment: a 60-year-old male suffering from anterior wall infarction without complication, delay of four hours, no contraindication in any therapy or arrhythmias, no previous disease as well as therapy; EF 50%, blood pressure 140/90. The questionnaire asked for decisions as to medication required and administration of the drugs covering the first 24 hours. The circulares returned by 34 colleagues came from 15 engaged at regional general hospitals with internal departments (group A) and 9 from reconvalescent centers treating heart diseases (group B) while 10 originated from members of a Medical University Clinic (group C). In group A streptokinase as thrombolytic agent was generally advised while group B and C preferred rtPA. Analgetics, sedatives, aspirin, heparin and nitrates were all used in both groups in similar doses, whereas antiarrhythmic agents as well as calcium antagonists were hardly ever administered in all three groups. Concerning the use of betablockers these are administered in group C i.v., in group B orally while in group A its use was avoided by the internists concerned. In group A ACE-inhibitors and magnesium are more often applied in the early phase of acute infarction compared to B and C. This study confirms a far reaching variation in therapeutic treatment of acute myocardial infarction as applied by hospitals with different orientation. f in patients (pts) with acute myocardial infarction morbidity and mortality are usually determined by early re-establishing and maintaining of infarct-related vessel patency, intravenous thrombolysis is considered standard therapy. The published patency rate of the infarct-related vessel is 50 -90 %, defined as TIMI-flow H or I~, re-occlusion rate is between10 -20 % and mortality rate between 3.7 % -10.7 %. We descri~ our experience in 216 consecutive pts treated with direct angioplasty in the setting of acute myocardial Infarction, especially the impact on re-occlusion and in-hospital mortality. Study population: 216 pts, 151 male, 65 female, mean age 58.3 years (range 31-80 yrs). Time from onset of pain to coronary angiography was 196 +_ 112 minutes (range 22-717 rain.). Initial labarotory findings revealed a creatinin-klnase (CK) from 5 up to 547 U/l, mean 98 U/I. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 57.5 % (range 23-90 %). 13 pts presented with contraindieations for thrombulysis, 18 pts presented in cardiogenic shock. Results: In 196/216 (91%) pts infarct -related vessel patency was received, rang~ from 75 % for venous bypsss ~fis up to 97.7 % for the circumflex artery (RCA 86.2 %, LAD 94.6 %).",

Therefore we favour clearly this therapeutic strategy in the setting of acute myocardial infarction compared to thrombolytic therapy. Cardiogenic shock in acute myocardial infarction developes in about 4-8 % of the patients (pts) reaching hospital alive. It is the result of dynamic process of ongoing myocardial necrosis. Several different therapeutic strategies did not considerably influence the outcome of these pts, mortality rate s~ remains up to 70 -80 %. Recently, Immediate mechanical recanalization has been proposed and seems to improve in hospital survival. Since 1990 we perform direct PTCA in acute myocardial infarction as routine therapy, up to nowin 225 pts. 18 (8 %) of these pts presented in cardiogenic shock, defined as systolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg, altered mental status, cool, clammy skin. Study population: 18 pts, 9 r~ale, 9 female, mean age 54.5 years (range 42 -79 yrs.). In 9 pts the infarct -related coronary artery was the LAD, in 6 pts the CX-artery and in 3 pts the RCA. Single vessel disease was documented in 9 cases, double vessel disease in 7 coses and triple vessel disease in 2 cases. 6/18 pts applied artificial respiration, rsn~ng from 3 hours to 62 days. All pts received eatecholamines intravenously. 1 pt survived three organ failure. Results: Infarct-related coronary artery could be recanalized in 17/18 pts. One man died of progressing cardlogenic shock, while recanAliz~tinn failed in part. Another man died with re-opened artery because of refractory cardiogenic shock affecting a great deal of the right ventflcular muscle mass. 16/18 pts left hospital alive. Couclusions: 1)Direct PTCAin pts with cardiogentc shock in the course of acute myocardial ~tion improves early prognosis in our study population. 2) It seems to be superior to most of the other therapeutic strategies. Acute coronary artery dissection in PTCA remains unpredictible. It is the primary cause of severe complications determining the incidence of emergency CABG, in-hospital myocardial |nf~rction and in-hospital death. It still occurs in approximately 2 -7 %.",

Our results show furthermore,that the use of autoperfusionballooncatheter technique in PTCA-bailout is similiar succesful than stenting, but seems to generate less complications. Acute renal failure due to several reasons including ischemia and application of nephrotoxic agents is a major problem in patients in an intensive care unit. One vasoactive factor likely to be involved in the development and maintenance of ARF is adenosine (Lin IJ; Kidney Int 1988; 33:24-28). Theophylline (TP) is well known as a direct adenosine antagonist (Osswald H; Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 1975; 288:79-86) and it has been used widely in animal models to prevent acute renal failure. To answer the question it\" theophylline is also able to prevent the development of ARF in clinical models we performed our prospective study using radiographic contrast media (CM) induced renal failure as an experimental model of acute renal failure (ARF).",

However, had a poor calibration, mainly in those patients with a lower predicted risk of death. Vasospasms leading to myocardial ischemia or infarction are well known adverse effects of numerous natural and semi-synthetic ergot alkaloids but have only rarely been reported for dihydroergotamine (DHE). As an intranasal formulation DHE is now frequently used in the treatment of migraine but thus far no reports about coronary events have been published after intranasal application. We followed a patient with chronic coronary artery disease who experienced an acute myocardial infarction shortly after starting treatment with intranasal DHE for severe migraine. This 51-year old male caucasian had a 3-year history of coronary artery disease (50% stenoses of RCX and RIVA) presenting with 1-2 episodes of vasospastic angina at rest and on exertion occurring on average every 3 months. He was maintained on oral nifedipine (20mg bid) and aspirin (100rag qd). Because nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs provided only partial relief of his migraine attacks he was started on intranasal spray of DHE mesilate. Within 24 hours he administered 4 sprays of DHE (0.5mg each); after the second 2 sprays angina occurred and within the following 48 hours he experienced an episode of unstable angina pectoris with numerous attacks at rest. He subsequently was admitted with an acute posterior myocardial infarction for fibrinolytic therapy. Coronary arteriography performed before discharge from the hospital revealed a slight progression of atherosclerosis in RCX and RIVA and a successful catheter angioplssty of a 75% RCX stenosis was performed. After oral and parenteral administration DHE has been shown to cause Ionglasting vasoconstriction in numerous vascular beds and to promote coronary vasospasms. The close temporal association of intranasal DHE administration and myocardial infarction in this patient with previously stable coronary artery disease suggests a causal relationship. As advised by the manufacturer intranasal DHE should be avoided in patients with coronary heart disease. ~'evious studies haw indicated tL~t the true cost of antibiotic therapy involves considerably more than the agent; however, every aspect associated with treatment (i.e., administration supplies, laboratory monitoring, pharmacy preparation time, nursing administration time) was not evaluated in the ICUs. The aim of this study was to compare the total costs of 2 antibiotic therapies, Vancomycin (V) and Teicoplanin (T) for treating severe infections due to MRSA. To do that, acquisition costs, preparation and administration costs, laboratory and monitoring charges, and labour costs were considered separately in 6 patients without renal failure randomly assigned to receive V (n=3 for a total of 96 infusions) or T (n=3 for a total of 74 injections). Preparation and administration costs included equipment to start and administer the drugs, nursing time for preparation and IV push (for T) or 1-hour infusion (for V). Central venous catheter costs included the number of catheter used multiplied by the cost per catheter, andfheoaverage -time-needed for 6 residents to cannutate a vessel (15 min) with the asssistance of 18 nurses (mean time, 27 min). Labour costs were calculated from the hourly rate of a 2nd-year staff nurse (16.7 USD) and a 3rd-year resident (15.7 USD). Cost of determining antibiotic concentrations was calculated from peak and through determinations actually performed in each patients. The 6 patients were successfulIy treated, and no side effects were observed. The total cost per day was 59.2 USD for V and 93.9 USD for T. Costs of drug acquisition constituted 52% and 89% of the total costs for V and T, respectively. Our results suggest that there are variable additional costs associated with administration of antibiotics; such total costs should be considered in comparisons of therapeutically equivalent products. duct in SD rats.

To evaluate the feasibility of vend-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) in advanced age, we examined the results obtained in the whole series of 22 pts (mean age: 68+11 yearsyrs) treated with this tecnique in the last two years for chronic CHF (C-CHF) and for severe left ventricular dysfunction following acute myocardial infarction (AMI-CHF). Pts were divided into two agegroups (A: <70 yrs, n=ll, mean age: 60d:7 yrs and B: >70 yrs, n=11, mean age: 765:5 yrs). There were neither age-related differences in indications (C-CHF: A=B=63.6%, AMI-CHF: A=B=36.4%) nor in mean values of blood concentrations of creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium, and of pH, pC 2 and pCO 2, always demonstrating metabolic acidosis and renal failure. CVVH lasted slightly longer in younger (137+140 vs 104+88 hours, NS) and sicker pts (dead: 137+138 vs survived: 101+79 hours, NS). Mortality was not significantly age-associated (A: 50.0% vs B: 72.7%, NS). Weight reduction was lower in aged pts when the treatment was stopped (B: 2.6_+4.3 vs A: 11.0-+9.0 Kg, p<0.002), according to the need of a lower volume depletion in elderly pts to reach a significant clinical improvement. tn conclusion, CVVH, if properly regulated, revealed itself as a very useful tool in treating CHF also in advanced age, allowing greater survival rates tha~ traditional medical therapies in conditions generally associated with very high mortality rates. Patients critically ill are usually submited to invasive procedures and become a high risk population of developing nosocomial pneumonia. The relation between the contaminated enteral nutrition, oropharynx and stomach colonization and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be better established. The study included mechanically ventilated patients without pneumonia.Specimens from orofarynx, tracheal secretion, gastric aspirate and enteral nutrition bottle were collected during the first 24 hours admitted at ICU and each 3 days and delivered to quantitative microbiology analysis unl~ patients developed pneumonia or were discharged. The gastric pH was analysed. Clinical and radiological evolution to pneumonia was documented by a 10' cfu / mL cut off from tracheal secretion. Twenty six patients were studied and 13/26 developed pneumonia. The quantitative analysis of tracheal secretion demonstrated a specificity and sensibih)y close to 62% and 77% respectively. Oropharyngeal colonization by germs tradittionally associated to nosocomial pneumonia preceded about 70% of the Cases. The results confirmed a closerelation between alkalinization and the number of germs presented in the stomach. Most(10/13) of pneumonia group patients were taking enteral nutrition wich were contaminated withmore them 10ecru / mL. Using the susceptibility tests to antibiotics as a typing systemit was shown and agreement of the bacteria found in the trachea and the enteral feeding, supporting a s~ong evidence of this food rote as a source of int'ection.",

(1992) Anaesthesist 42:213]. Enkephalin and serotonin are believed to block calcium channels in the membranes of the nerve terminals, that obviously result in presynaptic inhibition. It was aim of our study to investigate if there is a direct influence of fluvoxamine on the /z-receptor binding of sufentanil. Methods: Animal care commitee approach. 1) In 10 rats, receiving a jugular vene catheter, antinociceptive effects were measured by hot plate and tail flick test. In group 1 sufentanil (50~g/kg/d), in group 2 a combination of sufentanil and fluvoxamine and in group 3 fluvoxamine (20mg/kg/d) were continuously injected. 2) In another set of experiments, 5 rats were sacrificed, brain was removed and membranes were prepared as described [Bhargava H.N. and Gulati A. (1990) European J. Pharmacol. 190:305-311] . This membrane preparation was taken for receptor binding studies with opiates in addition of fluvoxamine. It has been shown that serum magnesium (Mgs) value on admission in ICU patients could have a prognostic significance (Crit Care Med 1993, 21, 203) . Therefore, we prospectively investigated 284 consecutive patients (179 men) admitted to our medical ICU over a 6-month period. Mgs was determined by a colorimetric method. The main end-point was the patient outcome during the ICU stay. Mgs values on admission led to partition the patients into the following three groups : low (Mgs<0,75 areolA), normals (0,75_Mgs_l maul/l) and high (Mgs>l mmolfl). Patient survival was determined by actuarial method and survival rates were compared with Mantel-Haentzel test. Cox multiple regression model was used to control patient survival for the following covariates : Mgs, age, sex, SAPS, organ system failure (OSF) on the day of admission, previous health status, medical or postoperative context, mechanical ventilation. 'l'he earacleristics of the sample were as follows : age (mean_SD) 55__.19 years, SAPS 10_+6, OSF number 1_+1 (_2 in 33% of the patients), medical context for 244 patients (86%) and emergency postoperative for 40 (14%); 50% were mechanically ventilated within the first 24 hours. Mgs value amounted 0,79_+0,15 mmolA in the whole group. 101 patients (36%) were in the low Mgs group (Mgs 0,65_0,08 maul/l), 161 (57%) in the normal Mgs group (0,84-+0,06 maul/l) and 22 (8%) in the high Mgs group (1,11 _+0,1 maul/l). The overall ICU mortality rate reached 16% (44/284). Actuarial survival curves were different between the three Mgs groups (p<0,01); mean survival time was 17 days in the high Mgs group (mortality 48%) vs 30 days for the normal Mgs group (mortality I2%) vs 29 days for the low Mgs group (mortality 15%). Cox's model extracted SAPS and age. as the two covariales explaining independently ICU death. This prospective study showed: 1-a 43% prevalence of Mgs abnormalities among patients admitted to our ICU; 2-the absence of a significant link between Mgs on admission and outcome in ICU.",

Case rej~ort: 1 hour after ingestion of 4g propafenone in suicidal intention a 48 year old woman was admitted to the emergency room. At home she was found unconscious (glasgow coma scale 7) but breathing spontaneously, hypotensive (80/30 mmttg) with a heart rate of 35 bpm. In hospital oral hrtubation was perfomaed and mechanical ventilatory support initiated. Because of persistent severe hypotension and bradycardia 0Amg epinephrine was achninistered. Subsequent ventricular flutter required several defibrillation and continuous rescueitation. After 20 minutes performing closed chest massage and additional drug therapy with dopamine and dobutamine sinusrhythm and a stable circulation could be established. For drug elimination a gastric lavage with instillation of activated charcoal and calcium gluconate was done. Furthermore the patient received an infusion of 0,5 g/h sodium-chloride and 250 mmol sodium bicarbonate to antagonize competetivly the sodium chmmel-blocker effect of propafenone and to balance the metabolic acidosis. Glucagon infusion was given to increase the cardiac inotropy. Retrospectively blood concentration of propafenone was elevated (2.98 mg/I; normal range: 0.25mg/1-2.0mg/1). 14 hours after admittance to the ICU the patient could be extubated without sigmes of neurologic deficits. The ECG-changes were completely normalised. Conclusion: Intoxication with the class Ic antiarrhytlm~ic drug propafenone is a rare but severe form of ingestion in suicidal intention. It may take a lifethreatening course because of the drug-induced dysrhythmias and the negative inotrop properties of the drug. Immediate rescuisitation, drug elimination and administration of sodium chloride is pivotal in treatment of propafenone intoxication. Infection is extremely common in the ICU and the EPIC Study has demonstrated a prevalence rate of 45 %. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the majority of critically ill patients die with or from infection. We have studied the incidence of infection (defined using the Centre for Disease Control [CDC] criteria) in our 13 bedded general adult ICU over a period of eight months and its relation to standardised mortality rate (SMR).",

Introduction: Urodilatin, a newly identified analogue of human ANP, has potent diuretic and natriuretic effects even in low doses in healthy subjects. Acute renal failure after major abdominal surgery is a severe complication with a high mortality in intensive care units (ICU). The aim of the study was to explore whether or not urodilatin improves postoperative acute renal failure and reduces the need of hemodialysis. Methods: This randomized study was approved by the local ethics committee, which requested to limit the number of patients to 12 subjects under double-blind placebo-controlled conditions. Twelve consecutive nonoliguric patients in the ICU after major abdominal surgery with no history of impaired renal function were admitted to the study, when serum creatinine had reached acutely 2.5 mg/dl or endogenous creatinine clearance was reduced to 15 ml/min despite low-dose dopamine (2,5/zg/kg BW/min) and furosemide (1000rag/24 h) therapy. All patients were ventilated artificially and monitored extensively regarding hemodynamic and biochemical parameters. Urodilatin (n=6) or vehicle (n=6) was infused continuously in a dose of 20 ng/kg/min for at least 4 in maximum 6 days additionally to the conventional diuretics therapy. Results: Serum creatinine was similar at the day before the onset of urodilatin infusion in both groups (2,93_+0.48 mg/dl, 2.80+0.24 mg/dl). During application of urodilatin/vehicle peak serum creatinine was reduced from 5.78+1.58 mg/dl in the vehicle-to 4.65_+0.57 mg/dl in the urodilatiu-treated groups (P=0.t48). Hemodynamic parameters were not altered due to urodilatin/vehicle treatment. The total number of hemodialysis because of oligoanuria and/or dramatic rise of serum urea, creatinine, and K +, was the same in both groups (14/15) during the trial (6 days).",

Two of the patients died on the 5th day and one of the patients died on the 12th day after taking the lethal dose of lithium. In one of the patients, autopsy revealed undissolved lithium tablets in the stomach and remainders of the tablets in the intestines in spite of gastric lavage which had been carried out. In another patient, high levels of lithium (34 and 11.3 mmol/I, resp.) were found in the gastric lavage returns on the 1st and 2nd days.",

A smaller group of up to 15% is initially admitted because of other diseases and develops \"secondary\" pancreatitis as complication. Among the reasons are disorders of coagulation and metabolism, medications, intoxications, infections, vasculitis and medical interventions as abdominal operations and ERCP. This paper presents three case reports in order to show the specific problems in diagnosis and treatment of \"secondary\" pancreatitis in ICU patients. Case 7: After 4 weeks of prodromi a 37-year-old woman was admitted because of ketoacidotic coma as first manifestation of diabetes mellitus. As sign of the preexisting diabetes, hemoglobin Alc was elevated up to 12%; pancreas enzymes were in the normal range. The course was complicated by pneumonia, sepsis and DIC. Atthough there were no abdominal symptoms, serum lipase increased up to 4926 U/L CT revealed subtotal pancreatic necrosis.

Arterial thrombosis in this setting may be unexpected and clinical detection difficult. Case report: A 61 year old female patient was initially treated for acute anterior wall infarction by successful acute PTCA under high dose heparin therapy. She developed first signs of right sided deep vein thrombosis (DVT) twelve days later confirmed by phlebography despite effective i.v. heparin. Platelct count dropped from initially 250,000 to 85,000 on day nine. Treatment regimen was changed to tow molecular weight (LMW) heparin and platelet count increased to normal levels. Despite this therapy she developed left sided DVT. CT scan revealed extensive thrombosis of the inferior vena cava, left sided pulmonary embolism and thrombi in the aortic arch, descending aorta and abdominal aorta. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed these findings. Control TEE 24 hours later after application of heparinoid instead of LMW heparin, lg/kg immunglobulin i.v. and a treatment regimen with 100rag of front loaded rt-PA revealed a further increase of the arterial thrombotic masses. The patient died 24 hours later. Clinical diagnosis of FL&TT was confirmed by a positive heparin induced platelet activation assay with erossreactivity to LMW heparin but not to heparinoid. Conclusion: HATT is a rare but severe and life threatening complication of routine heparin treatment. Progression of the disease occurs with LMW heparin due to crossreactivity despite normalisation of platelet counts. TEE is an easily applicable method for the detection of clinical silent arterial thrombosis and should be used extensively for early identification of this severe complication of HATT.",

The plasma concentration of reduced glutathione, malondialdehyde, and conjugated diens were measured on admission and the 3rd and 5th day of treatment.A bronchoscopy was performed on admission and the 3th day of treatment. The amount and viscidity of tracheobronchial secretions were examined and glutathione levels were measured in the BAL.Results. Both groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, APACHE II-score and diagnoses. We observed no significant differences in glutathione levels neither in the.plasma nor in the BAL. Plasma concentrations of lipid peroxidation products were similar in both groups and there were no clinical relevant differences in the tracheobronchiat mucus. Conclusions. The present data do not support the routinely use of NAC in ventilated patients. Intravenous administration of 3g NAC had no clinical relevant effect on glutathione levels, lipid peroxidation products, tracheobronchial mucus, and clinical condition. In general it is accepted that anaesthetic agents reduce urine volume and sodium excretion (reviewed by NIercatello, Anaesthesiology 1992). This sto.dy examined the effects of methohexital anaesthesia on renal fimction, lmemodynamics and hormonal parameters during controlled mechanical ventilation with 10 cm H~O positive end-expiratory pressure (C/vlV 10). Fomtenn expts, were performed ill seven trained, chronically tracheutomized female beagle dogs (body wt 13.8 to 17.8 kg) maintained on a controlled dietary sodium and water intake (sodium: 2.5 mmol/kg and water: 91 ml/kg body wt daily), two expts, in each. Control (C) : first bout spontaneously breathing with 4 cm t'~O continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP 4), second and third hour CMV 10. Methohexital ~ : ~t hour CPAP 4, second and third hour CMV 10 with iv methohexital, initial dose:6.6 mgfkg and sustaining infusion: 0.34 mg/min/kg body v,\u00a2. A balanced isoosmotar electrolyte solution (0.5 mJ/min&g body \"~,et) was given in both groups throughout, nurmoventilation was established and controlled by arterial blond gas analyses. Results: CPAP 4 values (heart rate HR, mean arterial pressure (carotid loop) = MAP, plasma osmolarity = P osm, urine osmolarity -U osm, glomerular filtration rate = GFR, urine volume = V, sodium excretion = UNaV, plasma sodium concentration = PNa, plasma retain activity = PRA, and antidiuretic hormone plasma concentration = ADH) were similiar in both groups. CMV 10 values (third bollr) are demonstrated on Table 1 (if\u00b1 SEM, * p < 0.05, Wilcoxon test). During the perioperative period, aspiration of gastric and intestinal contents often induced a deteriorate respiratory failure. We have already reported that the decreased PaO2 due to aspiration pneumonia was closely related to the decrease in peripheral white blood ceil (leukocyte) counts, and also found the leukocyte accumulation in the affected lung with severe pulmonary edema.",

During PTCA all patlents received an intracoronary bolus of 15.000 I.U. heparin,followed by an intravenous infusion of 15.000 -25.000 I.U. hepar~n.Anticoagulation assessment was performed by measurements of aPTT (Neothromtin,Behring, FRG) and HR-ACT (HemoTec,USA) immediately after PTCA and at the time of arterial sheath removal 13 \u00b1 4 h. after PTCA. [NTRODUCTION: CAVH, and its modifications have gained increasing popularity in the manegement of some critically ill Patients becsuse its effectiveness and good hemodynamic Tolerance. Ue have studied our experience with this technique MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 14 patients (9 Male, 5 Female~ aged 14-85 years).The following variables were studied:Income diagnosis, day of stay, day of evolution when the CAVH was started (DEHS), days on CAVH, daily ultrafiltrate volume (VF),fluid balance (FB),and the rote of survival. RESULTS: We obtained the following results:we diagnosis ARDS in 14.29%, Cardiogenic shock 14,2?%,septic shock 21, 43#,Congestive Heart Faileur (CHF) 28.57% and SMOF 21.43%. Age 62.5+20.5.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Six general intensive Care Units (ICUs) from the Public Health Network of the Spanish region of Valencia. PATIENTS: A total of 380 consecutive intensive care patients admitted with the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction were followed for a median time of 3.4 years. The follow-up was complete in 96.1% of the patients. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Most of the social factors considered in the study (educational level, marital status, employment status, income level, availability of car) were associated with short and/or long-terra prognosis in the crude analysis. After adjusting for main biological covariates (age, sex, Killip class, previous infarction and physical activity prior to admission) using Cox regression analysis, the social risk factors that showed an independently association with survival during the acute phase were a low degree of environmental confidence (adjusted relative risk = 1.82, 95%CI between 0.99 and 3.33) and to be never-married (adjusted relative risk = 2.09, 95%CI between 0.90 and 4.86). After the acute phase, the independent social prognostic factors were widowhood (adjusted relative risk = 2.17, 95%CI between 1.07 and 4.42) and the absence of a physician other than those in the ICUs that showed personal interest in the patient during his/her initial hospitalization (adjusted relative risk = 2.52, 95%CI between 1.01 and 6.25). CONCLUSIONS: Our study stresses the prognostic role of psycho-social factors of myocardial infarct patients.

La~\"gner, Introduction :The diagnosis and management of wide-complex tachycardia (WCT) is often difficult in emergency situations. We studied the effects of adenosine, which offers new aspects of antiarrhytmic treatment in patients with WCT. Methods: Hemodynamically stable patients with WCT first underwent vagal maneuvers, if unsuccessfully, adenosine was administered in incremental bolus doses of 6, 12 and 18 mg every 2 minutes until sinus rhythm (SR) or transient atrioventricular (AV) block, unmasking the underlying rhythm, was recorded. In the latter and in the non-responding cases other antiarrhythmics were applied. Results:This study includes 35 episodes of WCT (QRS>0.12) in 19 patients (1 lmale, 8 female) between 23 and 83 years of age (mean 48 years). Adenosine terminated WCT and restituted SR in 19 of 35 episodes (54%). A short lasting AV block after adenosine in 3 episodes (9%) revealed atrial flutter in two cases and atrial fibrillation in one case as the underlying mechanism. In 13 episodes (37%) no effect after adenosine administration could be observed. The onset of adenosine effect was rapid and within 25 sec, the duration of ventricular asystole 2.5 +_ 1.1 sec. We observed known, short lasting adverse effects like palpitations, chest pain and flush, but no hemodynamical deterioration after adenosine administration. Conclusion: Adenosine terminated WCT in 54 % of all episodes. In the remaining cases it was able to disclose the type of arrhythmia and help find the diagnosis. Due to these results, we use adenosine as the agent of first choice for wide-complex tachycardia. J.E. de La Coussaye, J.J Eledjam. Introduction: Central venous access by SV route is commonly used in ICU to monitor central venous pressure and to administer various drugs and nutrition. This procedure can lead to various complications such as arterial puncture or pneumothorax [1] . Aims of the study were to assess the accuracy and the interest of a new ultrasound device for SV cannulation and the influence of training on the rate of complicalions and the latency for successful cannulation. Methods: Approval of the local ethic committee and informed consent were obtained. Using continuous and pulsed-wave uhrasounds, the Doppler device ( Fig. 1 ) allowed to localize the SV and to measure its depth. To assess the influence of the training, we compared the first 20 to the last 20 patients. Number of punctures per patients, latency to SV cannulation and complication rate were reported (table1).",

MATERIAL AND METHODS Over a period of 1 1/2 years (June 1992-December 1993) a prospective and multicenter study (29 spanish ICUs) were engaged. All patients (183 cases) with infection HIV admitted in ICU, were recorder consecutively. The variables analyzed were age, sex, degree of severity (APACHE II), risk group, classification at admittance with respect to HIV (CDC classification, 1986) The pathogenesis of ascites formation in cirrhosis is uncertain. In a study by J.H.Henriksen central blood volume was found to be significantly smaller in patients with cirrhosis than in controls, the lowest values being in patients with gross ascites. Therefor central circulatory underfiiling is thought to be an integral part of the hemodynamic and homeostatic derangement observed in cirrhosis. In patients with TIPSS a decrease of ascites formation and increase of renal function couzld be shown. Therefor we wondered if TIPSS may also change central blood volume in patients with cirrhosis. Patients: n=6, 5 male, 1 female age 56 +6 a, Severity of disease: CHILD B: n=6 Statistic: paired t-test Methods: Hemodynamic measurements: Cardiac output, central blood volume and total blood volume were measured using a Swan Ganz catheter (Baxter REF) placed in the A.pulm. and an fiberoptic catheter in the A.fem. with Indocyane Green (COLD System Z-021 R, PULSION, Munich Germany). H,~matocrit was measured by a standard method. Results: Central blood volume increased from 1410 +_ 259 ml to 1475 + 390 ml (n.s,), while total blood volume decreased from 5951 + 835 ml to 4447 +_ 380 ml (p <0.001). The portion of central blood volume on total blood volume increased from 23.5 + 2 to 31 + 3% (p < 0.00I). H~imatocdt was decreased from 34 + 2% to 29 + 2% (p < 0.001) Discussion: Central blood volume (as portion of total blood volume) was found to be decreased in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, After TIPSS there was an tendency to an increase in central blood volume, but a significant increase in the portion of central blood volume on total blood volume. One reason for this discreapnacy might be a blood loss during the procedure leading to a decrease in total blood volume and central blood volume. Nevertheless it could be shown that TIPSS leads to change in distribution of blood volume with an increase of the central part. This might further lead to a normalization of the homeostatic derangement in these patients.. In vitro data generally demonstrate that acidosis decreases myocardial contractility and reSlx~siveness to cateeholamines, ttowever, the al/aity of sodium bicarbonate therapy to improve hemodynamics has not be proven in a controlled study. In clinical practice patients with poor contractile ftmcron and/or treated by beta blockers should be particularly vulnerable to acidosis. In order to test that h],~thesis, we tested the effects of bicarbonate infusion in patients D'ealabiy treated width beta blockers and presenting a cardingenic shock. Sixteen patients in cardiogettie shock after cardiac surgery were treated with 1 mmol/kg of molar sodium bicarbonate in 30 rains.

In 9 patients (age ranging from 28 to 76 years) with incessant VT and cardiogenic shock catheter ablation was performed, in 3 patients 2 ablation procedures were necessary to successfully ablate incessant VT. The underlying cardiac disease was coronary artery disease (n=7), dilative cardiomyopathy (n=l) and no organic heart disease (n=l). A complete mapping (activation mapping and pace mapping) of the right and left ventricle was performed during VT for localisation of the VT-origin. High energy DC shock or radiofrequency current was used for catheter ablation. Catheter ablation was successfull in all patients. As procedure related complication there occured an intermittent AV-block II \u00b0 in two patients with septal origin of the VT. In the follow up 2 patients died of non ablation related problems (I cerebral ischemia, lARDS). In 6 patients a sustained %~ was inducible two weeks after the ablation pocedure, 1 patient had no VT recurrence. Conclusion: Catheter ablation is an effective method in the acute treatment of incessant VT. Background and purpose of the study. Since the last '80s, Candlda spp, infections are considerably increasing in non-neutropenic critically ill patients and, currently, they account for about 5% overall nosocomial and 10% bloodstream infections, Although many risk factors for infection have been identified, the role of colonization has not yet been fully evaluated. The present retrospective study was carried out in order: 1) to estimate the rate of Candida spp. colonization of infection in patients admitted to a 8-bed multidisciplinary ICU over a 36-month period (from 1/1/1990 to 31/12/1992); 2) to evaluate whether colonization might be considered a risk factor for infection.",

Candida spp. infections were defined according to previously published methods. Colonization and infection were assessed on admission and, routinarily during hospitalisatlon, in patients requiring intensive care support for at least 72h. Results. Overall, 897 patients were admitted to our tCU throughout the study period. One hundred seven subjects (about 12%) carried fungi of the genus Candida spp. on admission, 102 being colonized and 5 infected with these agents. Eighty nine patients, neither infected nor colonized on admission, acquired Candida spp. in ICU, gendrally in the respiratory and urinary systems. ICU-acquired infection occurred in 7 subjects; in all bat m~e patient the infecting pathogen had been previously found as a colonizing agent. Although the number of infected patients was relatively small in the colonized and noncolonized group of subjects respectively, the rate of infection was markedly higher in the colonized group, the difference being statistically significant (P<0.001) at chi-square test with Yates' correction. Except for a higher rate of complicated surgery in the infected group, the distribution pattern profile of risk factors for Candida spp. infection did not differ in colonized and infected.patients,Overall, 12 Candida spp. infections occurred, In 8 occasions fungi were isolated from blood, together with concomitant bacteriemias in 2 cases, In the remaining 4 patients candidosis was diagnosed by tissue biopsy, in 3 occasions bacteria being isolated as welt. Persistant candidemias were observed in 4 patients. In 3 occasions a catheter-related eandidemia were identified; in one of these cases, secondary deep seated infection on a prosthetic aortic valve developed. The clinical picture of fungal infection did not differ from sepsis due to other pathogens, Fluconazole treatment was given as first drug th all cases; in 2 occasions therapy did not yield infection control and patients were started on amphotericin B. Four patients with candldemia died. In 2 occasions septic shock developed before blood cultures had been found positive. Pulmonary disorders occur frequently-in critically ill patients and are associated with high mortality. Objective: Our goal was temporal connection of xenolungs to correct respiratory disorders and detoxication function in postresus-citation period in experiment and in patients in critical states. Methods: To achieve the goal we developed and tested a method of temporal connection of xenolungs (XL) to organism of recipient. In experiments on dogs after 6-min clinical death caused by acute asphyxia resuscitation was carried out till cardiac activity was restored.Then extraoorporal perfusion was initiated.The maximum perfusion rate volume was 33 ml/kg/min; duration -40 rain.

In the postresuscitation period neurological deficit was less pronounced in experimental animals; in this group a more rapid restoration of neurological status was also noted. Mortality decreased from 90 to 30%. The application of XL in patients with septic complications in critical states also provided positive results and was more effective than xenospleen and its slices.

Empirically, most intensivists are convinced that CAVH is better tolerated than HD, but this has never been demonstrated. The aim of this work was to compare the haemodynamic tolerance of the two methods, All the ICU mechanically ventilated patients who presented with acute renal failure between february 1990 and august 1993 were included and received CAVH during 24h and a 4h HD in a 24h period, between which was an intermediate \"washout\" period. The order of the CAVH and HD periods was randomised. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), was measured each 30mn. The mean MAP, the difference between the highest and lowest MAP and the proportion of MAP decreases >10mmHg were compared between CAVIl and HD periods. In addition, in order to take into account the associated treatments (weight variation and use of vasoconstrictive drugs), 9 physicians were asked to give a global judgment on the best tolerated method, looking at the haemodynamic and therapeutic data in a blind fashion. Results: 39 patients were randomised, of which 12 were then excluded (11 deaths before 96h and one technical failure). The 27 included patients were on 15 times HFAV-HD and on 12 times HD-HFAV. Associated pathologies with ARF were: cardiac or aortic surgery (n=10), infection (n=7), cardiac insufficiency (n=5), miscellaneous (n=5). Age=62_+16, SAPS at day0=16-+5, mortality=37%. The mean metabolic values and SAPS before the period, the efficacy of epuration, the mean weight loss I24h and the amount of vasocenstrictive drugs are identical for HD and CAVH. The best tolerated method, from the blind analysis of lhe MAP curves is CAVH in 60% of the patients and HD in 40% (not significant).",

INTRODUCTION -It is known that the recording of central venous pressure (CVP) or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is of little help when deciding on an adequate circulating blood volume, These parameters depend not only on the vascular volmne, but on the vascular tone, the myocardial function and the intrathoracic pressure too (1), lntrathoracic blood volume (/TBV) was proposed as an indicator of pretoad and the most approlmate guide of volume therapy. ITBV is the sum of the end-diastolic volumes of the four heart chambers (that is global end,diastolic volume or GEDV), together with the pulmonary blood volume and part of the aortic blood volume, ha critically ill patients,there is a good correlation between ITEV and cardiac output (CO) or 02 delivery (1302) (2). ME/HODS -This work eonce~s 10 patients, who entered ICtJ in consequence of acute respiratory failure. The mean age of the group was 46 years (lira.: 28 -75); all patients needed mechanical ventilation in CMV, moreover they received a continue infusion ofpropofol and muscle relaxant drug. A Swan-Ganz pulmonary catheter and a 4 F femoral artery catheter equipped with fiberopfics and thermistor (COLD System; Palsion Medizinteehnik, Munchen, FRG) were pieced m each patient. This system, that uses the central venotks injection of two indicators, calculates indexed ITBV, GEDV, fight ventricle CO, left ventricle CO and many other parameters. The mean duration of the study was 32 hours (lira. 12 -96) and a total of 110 sets of data was collected. ~e statistical correlations, between C1 and haemodynamic and pralod parameters, were studied using Pearson con-elation coefficient (r), with two-tailed significance (accepting p < 0.05). RESULTS -In our stud3,, it was possible to find poor correlation between PCWP and left ventricle cardiac index (CIart) (r = -.21, p = n.s.), and a better one between CVP and Clart (r = -.38, p < .01). Strict correlations were present between indexed ITBV (ITBVI) and Clart (r = .82, p < .0001) or indexed GEDV (GEDVt) and CIart (r = .83, p < .000t). Finally, indexed DO2 03021) and ITBVt showed a good correlation (r = ~77, p < .000l). Apart :from immunologic reasons (e.g. HLA-or platelet specific antibodies) a lot of clinical factors are responsible for transfusion success. Aim of the present study was to evaluate clinical conditions responsible for refractoriness to platelet concentrates. Marerial and Methods: 401 single donor platelet concentrates were transfused to 46 patients ( most of them with hematologic-oncologic disorders ). The posttrauafusion platelet increment was compared retrospectively to characteristics of the platelet concentrates ( e.g. storage time, leucocyte-contamination ) and patient -specific data ( e.g. fever, antibiotics, splenomegalie etc.).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, multicenter (30 ICUs) study was performed during 1 year. In all patients who adquired NPn we analized: demographic data, underlying disease, APACHE II score, 26 predisposing risk factors, roetgenographic caracteristics, complications and outcome. Clinical diagnosis of NPn was made acording to the CDC criteria. NPn were classified in high probability pneumonia (HPPn) and low probability pneumonia (LPPn) according to the accuracy of microbiologic diagnosis. HPPn was considered if: tracheal aspirated with hemoculture or pleural fluid + for the same agent; lower respiratory tract secretions obtained by BAL (Zl05 cfu), protected brush (zl03 cfu) or percutaneus lung aspiration and histopathologic pneumonia, nnivariate analysis and stepwise logistic regression were done using BMDP software package. RESULTS: A total of 565 episodes of NPn were diagnosed; 182 episodes corresponded to HPPn and 383 LPPn. Both groups were comparables in demographic data, underlying disease, APACHE II score, predisposing risk factors and roetgenographic caracteristics. Only barotrauma and empiema were significantly more frequent in HPPn group. No statistical differences were found in overall mortality rates (37.9% HPPn vs. 31.8% LPPn, p=0.16) neither mortality related to the NPn (21.4% vs 20%, p=0.78). Of the 22 prognostic factors univariately associated with mortality only age > 65, hipoproteinemia, surgery, shock, barotrauma, progressive respiratory failure and multiorganic disfunction remained significant after stepwise logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy in the diagnosis of NPn was not associated with differences in mortality. The factors associated with mortality were: age > 65, hipoproteinemia, surgery, shock~ barotrauma, progressive respiratory failure and multiorganic disfunction. The sensitivity of Staphylococcus strains to antibiotic agents may vary over time and increasing emergence of methicillin resistant strains is reported in intensive care units. In the present study we compared the sensitivity of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from the cultures of patients in the Center for Intensive Internal Medicine in years 1991 and 1993. The testing was performed semiquantitatively by standardized disk diffusion method. The percentage of ampicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus approximates 70% while the resistance to cloxacillin ranged from 29 to 42% (Table) . The sensitivity to other antibiotic agents was 80% or more. The numerical differences between years 1991 and 1993 were not significant.

A cardiac (n=63), and a septic (n=37) group was evaluated besides patients with extracm-diac stmcmres (n=3). Four exanunatiou areas for TEE were defined (contractility, fiiling,vslvalar function and extracardiaa structures). Finally, the additional information acquired from TEE findings, beyond the PAC parameters, was noted. intervention 9 Conslusions : Besides evaluation of cardiac performance and filling status, TEE offers an insight in cardiac morphology and valvular function, resulting in a \u2022 50% change in management, independent of the presense of a PAC. The branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have properties whose administration may modify the response to metabolic stress in patients. The current study was undertaken to determinate if changing BCAA concentrations and/or N z supply could be beneficial in critically ill patients. Material and Methods: A prospective multicenter study was performed in 7 ICUs. Group A included septic patients and group B traumatic ones. Patients in each group were divided at random into three subgroups according to the total parenteral nutrition (TPN) administered. Subgroup I and II received 1.5 g AA/Kg.d with a calorie/N ratio of i00:I and a changing BCAApercentage (I:23% and II:45%). Subgroup III was treated with i.I g AA/Kg.d with a calorie/N ratio of 140:1 and 45% BCAA. All diets were isocaloric and the CHO/FAT ratio was of 60:40. Prealbumin (PA), retinol binding protein (RBP), nitrogen balance (NB), and plasma amino acid profiles were determined at baseline and after 3, 7, and ii days of TPN. Length of stay and mortality in ICU were recorded. Quantitative variables were assessed by uni-or multifactorial ANOVA, and qualitative variables by Chi-square test. Results: Group A included 69 patients and . At baseline no significant differences were found among groups and subgroups. In Septic Group PA, RaP and plasma BCAA increased and mortality rate decreased in subgroups of patients treated with 45% BCAA; NB improved in all septic subgroups, but no differences were shown among them. In trauma patients, the subgroups treated with 45% BCAA increased BCAA plasma concentrations, while PA only increased in subgroup III without associated changes in RBP; NB improved in subgroup I and less significantly in subgroup II; no changes in mortality rate were observed.

The obvious main advantages of this new oxygen sensor principle are the very short response time, no need of using a membrane, the very low energy consumption as a consequence of the pulsing method of measurement and the low oxygen consumption so that tissue is not damaged. Hence, by virtue of longterm oxygen sensing in blood, the pacing rate of cardiac pacemakers, for instance, can be adapted leading to the development of physiologically adapted or rate responsive cardiac pacemakers.

Incidence of nosocomial staphylococcal infections, e.g. due to methicillin-resistant strains of st. aureus and st. epidermidis, should be reduced by intranasaI application of this drug. Material and methods: In a pilot study, 20 patients (7 female, 13 male, 22-88 ),ears old), staying on the ICU for at least 10 days, were investigated. Patients were divided in 2 groups by randomization. In I0 patients mupirocin (Turlxin\u00ae) was applicated 3 x/day intranasally on both sides over a period of 7 days. The other 10 patients got no prophylaxis and served as control group. For microbiological examinations, samples were obtained from oropharynx, nose, anus, prepurium rasp. vagina, traeheobronchial secretions and urine. These samples were taken before the fLrst administration of mupirocin at the beginning of the ICU course and than in short intervalts. Further microbiological samples were obtained as necessary. All samples were microbiologieaUy differentiated and tested for resistance. Elevated epinephrine (EPI) causes hypoaminoacidemia. The aim of the present study was to address how EPI alters amino acid kinetics [rates of appearance (IRa) & disappearance (Rd)] to lower amino acid levels in humans. Eight healthy subjects (26 \u00b1 1 yr, BMI = 22.1) were studied by infusing EPI for 120 rain (40 ng/kg/min) and [1-13C]leucine and [2H5]phenylalanine for 3 hours before and during the EPI infusion. Plasma leucine (Leu), KIC and phenylalanine (Phe) levels and enrichments were measured before EPI infusion (-60-0 rain), during the fall of amino acid levels (20-8-rain) and after amino acid levels bad stabilized (100-120 min). Amino acid kinetics were calculated via non-steady state equations. Acute tolerance to the analgesic properties of opioids is still an unresolved clinical problem. The recent interest in the role of 2-agonists (a2) in anesthesia has demonstrated a potent synergistic interaction between a2 and opioids. Some clinical and experimental studies even indicated that a2 may interfere with the tolerance to opioids analgesia. In order to study the possible role of the a2 in the development of tolerance to opioid analgesia, we performed a series of experiments in rats using the tail withdrawal reaction test (TWR).The a2 clonidine, xylazine and dexmedetomidine were tested alone or in combination with fentanyl in naive and subchronic fentanyl treated animals. The snbchronic feutanyl treatment consisted of 6 SC. injections of 2.5 mg/kg/fentanyl.Using this treatment schedule, rats became tolerant to the analgesic effects of 0.16 mg/kg fentanyl; at higher doses of fentanyl, a clear reduction in the duration of analgesia was present. Cross tolerance was also seen to the analgesic properties of other opioids such as morphine and sufentanil. Neither in naive nor in subehronie fentanyl treated rots, analgesia was measured with the a2 tested. The synergistic interaction between the a2 and fentanyl in drug naive rats strongly reduced after the subchronic fentanyl treatment. The reductions in the duration of analgesia of the a2 plus fentanyl were similar to those observed with equipotent doses of the tested opioids alone. In order to test whether a2 could interfere with the development of tolerance to fentanyl, rats were tested with either 0.16 mg/kg fentanyl, 10 mg/kg xylazine or 10 mg/kg xylazine plus 0.16 mg/kg fentanyl after a subehronic treatment with 2.5 mg/kg fentanyl, 2.5 mg/kg fentanyl plus 0.63 mg/kg clonidine or 0.63 mgJkg fentanyl plus 0.63 mg/kg clonidine. Adding 0.63 mg/'kg clonidine to a subchronic treatment with 2.5 mg/kg fentanyl resulted in a complete tolerance to the analgesic effects of both fentanyl and fentanyl plus xylazine, After a subchronic treatment of 0.63 mg/kg fentanyl plus 0.63 mg/kg clonidine, a treatment schedule acutely comparable to 2.5 mg/kg fentanyl, less tolerance was seen to fentanyl and to fentanyl plus xylazine. These results can be described in terms of opioid receptor sparing and point to a limited role of the present tested a2 in the development of tolerance to opioid analgesia. Up m now, only a rather complicated non invasive method of predicting the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure (PCXVP) using the hemodynamic reaction to the Valsalva manoeuvre was reported. The aim of our study was to investigate, if a more simple manoeuvre without the use of any special equipment, that can therefore be performed in any intensive care unit, allows to estimate PCWP. 10 patients were investigated, all receiving mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube, all were monitored with a catheter in the arteria radialis and a pulmonary arterial catheter. The valsaiva manoeuvre was performed with a servo 300 ventilator, applying a intrathoracic pressure of 30 cm H20 tbr 15 seconds. The drop in arterial pressure during the strain phase of the Valsalva manoeuvre was documented. The ratios of systolic blood pressure before and during the inspiratory halt manoeuvre were calculated and this ratio was correlated to measured PCWP with the Swan Ganz catheter. Results: Measured PCWP was 8 to 25 mm Hg, correlation between the ratios of systolic blood pressure and measured PCWP was significant (r: 0,81; t: 3,94; DF: 8, p: 0,004). Conclusion: PCWP can be estimated by an uncomplicated non invasive manoet~vre in mechanically ventilated patients. It will need further work to prove whether the non invasive method of predicting PCWP is of value for critically ill patients with severe pulmonary disease or high doses of vasoconstrictory drags.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of the growth factors related proteins, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), pS2 and p185neu, in gastric mucosa of metabolically stressed patients. Methods: Gastric biopsies were obtained from a homogenous group of metabolically stressed patients on the fourth and seventh day after admission to the ICU. Gatric mucosa from gastectomy specimens were used as normal controls. EGFR, pS2 and p185neu proteins were measured by radioligand binding assay, RIA, and ELISA, respectively. Results: EGFR levels on day fourth and seventh were 22 foml/mg p., and 22 fmol/mg p., respectively, and they were significantly higher than controls (i0 fmol/mg p.). pS2 levels on day fourth and seventh were 1.3 #g/rag p., and 1.3 #g/mg p., respectively, and they were significandy higher than controls (0.49 #g/mg p.). p185neu levels on day fourth and seventh were 2.4 HNUt#g p., and 2 HNU/#g p., respectively, and they were significantly higher than controls (I HNU/#g p.). No significant differences were observed regardless whether or not erosive and/or ulcerative changes were present in gastric mucosa, Conclusions: Increased levels of EGFR, pS2 and p 185neu proteins occur in the gastric mucosa in response to metabolic stress in critically ill patients. Therefore, the impact of metabolic stress should be considered when evaluating increased levels of any of these proteins in gastric mucosa.

SDD prevents acquisition and eradicates Gram negative bacilli from oropharynx (Oph) and gut. Recently concern has been raised that it may select MRSA and thereby favor colonization and infection. We report our experience with SDD in our ICU, which is endemic for MRSA since shortly after opening in april'88. From aug.'89-jan.'92, period 1 (PI), we performed a placebocontrolled SDD trial in intubated patients (Pts) (29 months, 150 Pts). Based on favorable results, SDD, since then, is routinely given in exactly the same type of Pts, period 2 (P2) (14 months, 100 pts). Surveillance cultures of trachea (-r), (Oph), stomach (St), and rectum (R) were done during both pedods. Control measures began upon identification of MRSA (C+) (strict isolation, gown, gloves, and mask, nasal pseudomonic acid and chlorhexidine baths). The incidence of MRSA was 28% (42 Pts) during I\u00b01 and 8% (8 Pts) during P2 (P < 0.001). Mean number of days with C+/month were 5,6 days and 1.4, and mean C+/month: 16.4 and 2.2, respectively (Oph 4.7 and 1.1, T 4.3 and 0.5, R 3.8 and 2.1, St 3.4  and 0.3) . During ['1 in 3 mayor outbreaks MRSA reached monthly peak prevalences of 71, 40, and 66%, with an incidence of 35, 25, and 48% respectively. During P2 one minor outbreak with a peak prevalence and incidence of 33% was observed. Median and mean time of index cultures were identical in P1 and 1\u00b02. We conclude that the use of SDD is not associated with an increased incidence of colonization with MRSA. Department ",

            "text": "Physiology, UCL Medical School, London, UK commonly used drugs for stress ulcer prophylaxis in ICU-patients. CIM contains an imidazole structure. Similar drugs have been shown to inhibit steroid synthesis by blocking cytochrome P450dependent reactions in the adrenal cortex. It is suggested that bolus injections of CIM, but not RAN, could suppress the normal corticosteroid production. This might be deleterious since a decreased cortisol response seems to be associated with increased mortality during chronic severe stress. Methods : We designed a prospective, randomized and controlled study to assess the effect of CIM and RAN upon cortisol secretion in a cohort of hemodynamically stable ICU patients. 20 patients were consecutively enrolled : 6 controls, 7 CIM-treated and 7 RAN-treated patients. Both CIM (1200 mg) and RAN (200 mg) were administered by infusion pump over 24 hrs. A short corticotropin stimulation test (0.25 mg Synacthen R, Ciba-Geigy) was done within 24 hrs. after admission (dO) and repeated 7 days thereafter (dT). On both occassions, blood for cortisol dosage was drawn immediately before the test and 60 rain afterwards. Results : The increase of cortisol after stimulation at dO and d7 was significant for the 3 groups (Willcoxon signed-rank test : p < 0.05). Neither at d0 (396 + 102 gg/L vs 376 + 69 gg, respectively ; Mann-Whitney U test : p>0.05) nor at d7 (424 + 83 Ixg/L vs 391 + 66 gg/L, respectively ; Mann-Whitney U test : p>0.05), did the CIM and the RAN gToup show any significant difference in cortisol response. Moreover, this response at dO and d7 was also not significantly different from the one observed in the controls. Conclusion : A 7-day treatment with conventional intravenous doses of CIM does not induce significant alterations in cortisol response in critically ill hemodynamicatly stabte patients. VSR is a severe complication of acute myocardial infarction that warrants surgical treatment in virtually all patients. Urgent surgery is usually performed, in order to reduce overall mortality, despite higher perioperative mortality. The aim of our retrospective study was to determine the characteristics of patients with VSR who might tolerate and possibly benefit from delayed surgical treatment. During the last 5 years, 21 patients with VSR were treated in our ICU. In 5 of 9 surgically treated, surgery was delayed for >4 weeks. Some relevant clinical and therapeutic data of patients who underwent delayed surgery compared to patients who underwent urgent or no surgery are presented on the (6):864-874). The relevance of these dcfmifions for incidence and mortality, of severe infection was studied in a medical ICU. Methods: From April 1991 till the end of 1993 all patients of a medical ICU with fever, antibiotic therapy or suspected infection were registered. The3' were classified according to the sepsis-criteria of Bone till the end of 1992 and according to the consensus conference's criteria in 1993. APACHE-Score at the time of inclusion and clinical course till discharge or death were documented for each patient. Results: The Conclusions: Relative|y more patients meet with the consensus cenferelw.e's criteria for mere sepsis than do with Bone's (Incidence = 9% instead of 3%). This is due to the fact that only two of four physiological changes must be manifested in order to reach this status according to the conference. Bone wants all of three defined alterations to be fulfilled. As the incidence increases the mortality of sepsis decreases. Septic shock has almost the same incidence and mortality in both groups. The definition of Sepsis-Syndrome/Severe Sepsis as a link in the continuum between sepsis and septic shock remains problematic. It is evident that little changes in definition have an impact on the size of septic collectives and imply a change in prognostic significance. 1 Systemic hlllammatory Response Syndrome ~ c}inical alterations identical to those in sepsis, not caused by infection.",

To date studies dealing with sedation have focused on intubated patients whose quality of sedation was evaluated by doctors or nurses. In this study, we investigated the levels of anxiety and depression as well as the subjective quality of sleep in ICU patients. Patients & methods : After informed consent and institutional ethical committee approval was obtained, 44 non-intubated patients were prospectively included in the study and randomized to receive either midazolam (bolus 0.02-0.1 mg.kg -~ and 0.02-0.05 mg.kg-:.-hr \"~ for maintenance) or propofol (bolus 0.3 mg.kg -~ and 0.5-2 mg.kg'khr \"~ for maintenance) during 5 consecutive nights (from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) to maintain a Ramsay sedation scale between 3-4. The patients self-asscssed the quality of sedation by answering a questionnaire of HAD (hospital anxiety and depression scale, 0-21, 21 = most anxiety and depression), after the first, third and fifth night of sedation. Results : 36 patients completed the study. Both groups are similar for APACHE II score, demographic and surgical data. In the midazolam group (M), the level of anxiety is 6.7 :L 4.7, 6.5 + 4.5, 7.5 -+ 5.2, and 6.7 -+ 3.9, 6.8 -+ 3.1, 5.7 -+ 4.1 in the propofol group (P) at J~, J3, and Js respectively (ns). Similarly, the level of depression is 7.5 -+ 5.5, 6.8 +-4.8, 7.2 + 5.1 in M and 5.9 + 4.0, 6.0 + 3.0, 5.5 :L 3.0 in P (ns). 61% of the patients in M and 57 % in P (ns) have pathologic scores of anxiety on day 1 ( > 7 on the HAD scale). In both groups, the quality of s!ee p shows a comparable improvement from J~ to J5. Conclusion : This study shows that the choice of sedatives does not influence the levels of anxiety and depression in non-intubated surgical intensive care patients. Nearly half of the patients have pathological scores of anxiety and depression on Ja. On the other hand the quality of sleep improves during the course of the study.

One hundred and sixteen patients (aged from 27 to 85; 30 females and 86 males) were consecutively operated on for elective coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG, n=77), valvular replacement (VR, n=34) or combination of both (VR-CABG, n=5) and retrospectively included in the study. Patients with preoperative infections, and operated on in emergency were excluded. Each patient had preoperative invasive cardiac investigation with angiography and calculated ejection fraction (EF). Anaesthesia, cardiopulmonary (CPB) and cardiac arrest managements were similar in all patients. General body temperature was reduced to 28-30 \u00b0 C. ISR was defined as use of either dobutamine, adrenaline, dopamine or enoximone for weaning from CPB (post-CPB) and during the first 48 hours in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Demographic data, ASA and NYHA classifications, preoperative EF and treatments, type of surgery, CPB and aortic cross clamping (AXC) times, intraoperative and postoperative tranfusion, and postoperative incidence of complications were compared in patients with or without ISR using either Student's t test for repeated measures or ;~2 with continuity correction when appropriate. Multiple stepwise regression analysis was then used to identify predictive factors of ISR.",

These results suggest that patients with combination of VR-CABG surgery and need of inotropic support for weaning from CPB have a significant increased risk of postoperative mortality. In a attempt to identify patients with high risk of septic complications, this retrospective study analyses incidence of septic complications following uncomplicated-elective abdominal surgery. Sixty patients (aged from 63 to 92,19 women and 41 men) operated on for elective abdominal surgery (bowel, pancreas, or liver) were included in the study. Patients with preoperative infection were excluded. All the patients were intubated, ventilated and admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) just after surgery. Septic complications were defined according to Bone's criteria (Bone, Chest 100:802-08, 1991). The following factors : age, sex, type of surgery, type of anaesthesia, duration of surgery, and, at the time of admission in ICU, IGS and serum lactate level, were included in stepwise regression analysis to delineate predictive factors of septic complications. If any predictive factor has been identified, simple regresion analysis and ROC curves could be used to define a threshold value. Septic and non-septic patients were compared using Student's t test for repeated measures and X2 with continuity correction when appropriate. Data are expressed as mean+SEM. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Twelve patients (20%) had a septic complication during post-operative period in ICU. According to the stepwise regression analysis, age, sex, type of surgery, type of anaesthesia, duration of surgery, and SAPS were not predictive lactor. Serum lactate level was significantly higher in septic than in non-septic patients (3,91+_1,33 vs 2,77+-1,31, p=0,01) and was the only significant predictive factor (r=0,33, p<0,01). In this study, a serum level of 2,5 mmole/I has a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 61%. Incidence of septic complication was significanlty correlated with ICU stay (r=0,51, p<0,01) and ICU stay was longer in septic than in non-septic patients (10,8+4,6 vs 4,2+-4,7, p<0,01). Three out of 12 septic-patients died while no non-septic patients died (p<0,01). Serum lactate dosage could be used routinely at the time of admission in ICU to help in identifying patients with high risk of postoperative septic complications and perhaps preventing development of MOF.

NEJM, 329, 206,7,1993; 3, Ane~hesiology, 78,1028 3, Ane~hesiology, 78, -35,1993 Intra-and postoperative salvage is the process of the collecting blood lost from a wound or body cavity during and after surgery, processing it and reinfusing the blood into the same patient. Recent studies have shown it to be effective and safe. The suction of the blood from the operative field, the centrifugation and the washing of eryt/orocytes can mechanically damage the autologous red cells. This is the reason %~y the authors decided to search for the morphological changes. The morphology of the erythrocytes in the individual stages of the blood preparation was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. The eryt/qrocytes were classified according to ~nclature of red cell shapes (Bessis 1973) and the representation of their shapes in the both methods of blood preparation and at the individual preparation stages was estimated. At the start of the preparation were discocytes (normal shape erythrocytes), knizocytes and leptocytes the mostly represented cells. In the method I, (IAT with DIDECO, standard program), discocytes, leptocytes and knizocytes and in the method II, (IAT with DIDECO BQ~q) discocv~e, torocyte, stomatocyte, and knizocyte were the most freqalent cell shapes at the end of preparation. The resulting representation of normal red cells (disoocytes) was 44% in the method I and 63% in the method II. The other frequent cell shapes may be assumed to be reversible into normal discocyte shape under physiological conditions. No cell detritus or seriously damaged red cells ~re observed using any method. After cardiac surgery often there are polyuric phases and transient renal dysfunction. A regional diffeiemiation of these processes is possible by invasive techniques including renal biopsy. Approximately 30 different plasma protein components have been identified in the urine. The early detection of microalbuminuda for example has a high relevance for the diagnosis of a kidney damage in a reversible stage..The assay of ct-t-mieroglobutin in urine is considered to be one of the most efficient parameter for the diagnosis of tubular lesions. The activity of Tamm-Itorsfall-protein is mainly in the distal tubules of the loops of Henle. Methods: 34 patients were investigated before and after open heart surgery. They were derided into two groups with and without renal dysfunction. Group I consisted of 16 patients with a clearance of creatinine of 81,5 ml/min and without any symptoms of hyperhydratation and 16 patients with a mean clearance of ereatinine of 36,8 ml/min. The following clinical and labo-. ratory parameters were controlled: BUN, fractional excretion of sodium, volume of urine, application of diuretics and clinical indications of edema, cardiac insufficiency with increases in CVP and PCWP. Compared to these standards the excretion of albumin, Tamm-Horsfallprotein, [5-2 and ct-l-microglobulin were measured, Results: There were no significant differences in biometric data and diuresis between both groups. 0,73 17,0 13,5 12,7 1,9 2,9 82,4 199,0 (l) significant differences betv~een both groups: <2) significant changes within the study period",

Out of 740 cardiac operations under cardiopulmonary bypass we have observed 11 cases of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) (1.5%). In 9 cases there was bleeding from acute gastric and duodenal ulceration (81.8%). 72.7% patients belonged to the fourth functional class (NYHA). All these patients had a complicated postoperative course: cardiac arrest in 54.5%, prolonged massive inotropic support in 81.8%, mechanical ventilation (MV) (more then S days) in 63.6%. 90.9% patients due to paresis received no enteral nutrition. All the patients received standard anticoagulant therapy. The treatment consisted of: endoscopy (ES) with Focal hemostasis (application of glue and so on), the use of antacids, histamine H2 receptor antagonists. When if was necessary, red cell and fresh frozen plasma were transfused. 3 patients died (27%). The grave condition of the patient before the operation, the prolonged inotropic support, the protracted MV, the cardiopulmonary resuscitation in postoperative period, the absence of enteral feeding is an important factor of an increased risk of GIB. As far as this category of patients is concerned it is expedient to carry out a diagnostic ES before the operation, fo administer antacids, and to begin enteral nutrition in postoperative period as early as possible. Introduction: Cirrhosis increases the frequency of postoperative complications in patients with partial liver resections. Liver function tests such as ICG and MEGX-test are thought to be helpful as predictors for the operative outcome. Methods: Pre-and postoperative liver function was tested in 15 patients, including 6 patients with liver cirrhosis (Child A). Indications for operation included primary liver tumours (HCC, n=10), metastases (n=3), echinococous cyst (n=l) and liver abscess (n=l). Operative procedure in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients included lateral resections (n=4/ n=3, respectively), hemihepatectomies (n=2/ n=4) and trisegmentectomies (-/n=2). ICG-and MEGX-test were performed in all patients preoperatively and 1, 3 and 5 days post operatively. ICG elimination rate (\u00b0/drain) and MEGX level (ng/ml) 15 min. after bolus injection of lidocaine were compared in all groups calculating pre-and postoperative differences (%). Results: Preoperatively, both ICG elimination and MEGXlevels were significantly reduced (p< 0,05, Wilcoxon test) in cirrhotic vs. non cirrhotic patients (ICG: 5,49 +1,47 vs. 8,7 +4,0 and MEGX: 43,8 +30,3 vs. 90,1 _+42,3). On the contrary, ICG and MEGX values were not significantly different in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients suffering from HCC. However, postoperatively, ICG-elimination was increased constantly in patients treated with liver resection due to HCC and cirrhosis while decreased in non-cirrhotic patients who underwent liver resection. MEGX-levels decreased briefly after operation (p<0,01, day 3) while increasing progressively up to day 5 in all groups. Conclusion: Thus, the liver function tests examined did not seem to be of predictive value for the postoperative outcome in our study. Interestingly, liver perfusion measured by ICG elimination rate increased after resection of HCC in cirrhotic patients. Mechanisms may include the elimination of HCC as a shunt depot; the perfusion rate is consequently increased although the liver is partly resected, The relative contributions of cardiac index (CI) and oxygen extraction (02ER) to an increase in oxygen demand can be influenced by the underlying cardiovascular status of the patient. We studied this response during weaning from mechanical ventilation. We collected hemodynamic and arterial and mixed venous blood gas measurements before and 30 min after weaning (T-piece) in 75 patients after coronary or valve surgery (CS), heart transplantation (Tx) or abdominal aortic surgery (AS). The study focused on 38 patients (CS:23, Tx=8, AS:7) in whom V02 increased by more than 10%. In these patients, V02 increased by a combined increase in CI and 02ER in group CS and Tx but only by an increase in CI in group AS (figure}\u2022 These differences could be related to several factors, including the underlying cardiovascular status, the influence of cardiopulmonary bypass or the anesthetic technique. Inserting central venous catheters more ~equentiy and le.a-4 ng them in place for a loagar period of time implies an increasing rate of complications. A rare but potentially life -threatening event is the fragmentation and embolization o:fa eathete~:. ~ A 35 ~ year old alcohol -addict had a la~rotomy for perforation of a gastric ulcer. The postoperative recovery was complicated by ulcohol withdrawal syndrome and the develcromeat of acute edematous pancreatitis. On the 29th postoperative day ta~ratum rose up to 40 \u00b0 C and sepJieaemia due to the central venous catheter was st, specter. Tlie Ieft sided subclavlaa catheter (Lavafix Certo, B. Braun Melsuagen), which had been inse~,ed 9 da~ before, was removed. Thereby fragmentation of the catheter oecored and a 15 cm long fragment was embo~ed into the right heart. Blood cultures were taken and estimated antibinsls with vancomysin and gentamycin was started, as well as therapeutic heparintzation. Cardiologists of ct~r hospital attempted to retrieve the fragment under X -ray control. Unfortunately the fragment was further dislocated into the rigtht pulmonary artery. During a second session ~days later the embolized catheter fragment was succesfully removed applying a specially designed retrieving catheter (G. t~Itar, W. Cook, Europe). On the same da:y the patient was discharged from 1CU. Staphylococcus aureus being sensitive to our antibiotic regime was identified-in the blood cultures.",

Removal of a centrally wedged catheter fragatent is always indicated~ as the foreign body is a potential cause for many major complications.Amony these are arthythmias perforation of the atrium, myoardial necrosis, pulmonary embolism, lung infarelion and intracardial infection (2,4).

In these conditions ECA and BCA increased by 70-120% and 116-150% accordingly, and the level of MM decreased by 160-180% in comparison with initial values. The return of ~xfus~i pl&si~a ailer its pu,ii~cabon by indirect ele~tlochemical 3xidation was 70-80%. The remaining 20-30% of deficient 31asma were compensated by fresh cryoplasma and albumin ~olutions. I Indirect electrochemical detoxication of plasma provides '~ffective preservation of protein components and improves the ransport function of albumin. Recently the measurement of right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and right ventricutar enddiastNic volume (RVEDV) gain more and more clinical acceptance. Especially in cardiac surgery intensive care, RVEF and RVEDV have become useful tools for monitoring myocardial performance. Measurements of RVEF and RVEDV are performed by a pulmonary artery cathether (PAC) with rapid response thermistor, connected to a suitable Cardiac Output (CO) computer. The COLD system is a new, integrated monitoring system, that measures CO, RVEF and RVEDV not only by use of this cathether, but by use of a standard PAC also. In this study we compared CO, RVEDV end RVEF measurements with the COLD system (Pulsion Co.) to the EXPLORER (Baxter Co.), both in combination with a rapid response PAC. 486 measurements in 8 patients have been analysed. A rapid response PAC was applied to each patient and sets of 20 measurements were performed within 15 minutes. After each single measurement, cathether connction was changed to the other system. Measurements were done during stable circulatory conditions only. Patients and methods. Controls: 6 patients with uncomplicated courses after aortocoronary bypass grafting or single valve replacement. Examination groups: 6 patients each after similar interventions who could not be weaned from the respirator on the first postoperative day because of pulmonary diffusion disturbances or because of cardiocirculatory instability; a third examination group consisted of nine patients suffering from abdominal sepsis. Samples were obtained both from an indwelling Swan-Ganz-catheter and a radial artery cannula. Blood was drawn once in the morning for up to three days into chilled Na-EDTA tubes, immediately centrifuged and stored at -75 \u00b0 C. TEAC determinations are based on the specific absorption of a complex of ferryl myoglobin and the relatively long-lived ABTS \"+ radical cation. This absorption is quenched in the presence of antioxidizing agents the degree of which is related to increasing concentrations of Trolox TM, an a-tocopherol analogue. Results and dlsoussion\u00b0 There was no significant (ANOVA, p<O\u00b005) difference between controls and examination groups, respectively. However, within the group of septicaemic patients those who died within the sampling period exhibited significantly higher TEAC values as compared to survivors. Universit~tsklinik f.

However due to the advances in intensive care and the development of more effective and aggressive surgical anticancer therapy, intensive care in oncology has become even more important. Therefore it is necessary to reevaluate the role of intensive care in oncology. The hospital records of all patients admitted to the ICU of our hospital over a one year period (1.1.-31.12.1993) were reviewed. 511 admissions occured in 489 patients (m = 269, f = 220). The mean age was 57 years with 20 patients < 25 years and 34 patients > 75 years. Indications for intensive care in surgical oncology included postoperative recovery (458), complications of cancer and its treatment (21) and monitoring of aggressive anticancer therapy e. g. isolated limb peffusion (32). The mean duration of ICU stay was 6 days (max. 150d). Postoperative ventilation was necessary in 101 patients with a mean duration of 6 days (max. 94). Inotropic support and mechanical ventilation were more commonly required in non survivors. Reanimation was performed in 10 patients 6 of which subsequently died (60%), Overall 14 patients died on the ICU corresponding to a mortality rate of below 3%. However treatment related death occured in only 21% (sepsis, hemorrhage) of these patients while the others died of unrelated causes (lung embolus, myocardial infarction). Notably only 1 death oecured in the 32 patients admitted for monitoring of an investigative potentially toxic treatment. Interestingly autopsy revealed that clinical diagnosis of the immediate cause of death was correct in only 26% patients. Conclusively ICU-mortality of cancer patients in this specialized unit was comparable to patients with nonmalignant disease. There was no reliable predictive factor for survival, which enabled objective decisions about limitation of intensive therapy. In the future effective intensive care including specific monitoring techniques will play an important role for further development of anticaneer treatment.",

Results were as follows: From the results we conclude that : (1) in the ventilatory modes associated with lower intrathoracic pressure (IMV6-PSV10), cardiac index is increased due to a better RV preload (higher end diastolic volume without change in the tilfing pressure) whereas RV afterload is unchanged, (2) in spontaneous mode@reload is even increased (highest end diastolic volume with the lowest filling pressure) probably because of the removal of any positive intrathoracic pressure,(3) no significant difference is shown between IMV and PSV,",

Konrad, T. Schreiber, J. HNmel and M. Georgieff Some authors have shown that theophylline increases mucus transport in healthy subjects and patients with chronic bronchitis. However other investigators have found unconvincing or conflicting results. Therefore, we studied the influence of theophylline on bronchial mucus transport velocity (BTV) in ventilated patients. Methods.The study was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital. In a placebo-controlled double-blind study, the effect of therapeutic serum concentrations of theophylline on BTV in ventilated patients of a surgical ICU was investigated. Group 1 (n=10) served as controls and received placebo. The patients of group 2 (n=10) were given intravenous infusion of 5mg/kg theophylline over 20 rain, followed by lmg/kg per hour. Before administration of theophylline and lh after starting the infusion BTV, serum theophylline concentrations, and arterial blood gases were measured. Heart rate and blood pressure were registered every 5 rain. BTV was measured with albumin microspheres labeled with technetium-99m, which was deposited on the dorsal surface at the lower ends of the right and left main bronchi via a catheter placed in the inner channel of a bronchoscope.The movement was visualised and recorded using a scintillation camera. Results and Conclusions. The theophyllin treatment induced a significant improvement in BTV from 3.8 to 7.6 mm/min in the left main bronchus and from 0.5 to 5.4 mm/min in the right, while placebo was inactive. The increase in BTV, however, was associated with an increase in heart rate; in 3 patients the theophylline infusion had to be stopped because of severe tachycardia. Therefore routine application cannot be recommended but should be considered in risk patients (e.g. patients with chronic bronchitis and impaired tussive clearance).",

Sch6nfelder, N.Doetsch, JC.Reidemeister Introduction: A wide range of sedative agents are used after cardiac surgery to optimise patients' situation and avoid vegetative dysregulation. The ideal agent does not exist, but the properties were closely met by gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHA). Methods: In this open randomised study of 66 patients undergoing CBG, the hemodynamical and sedative effects of three different analgosedative regimes were investigated. We administrated midazolam (M), propofol (P) and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHA) for sedation. Boli of piritramid were used to provide analgesia. We noted the amount of analgetic drugs, time from the end of sedation until spontaneous breathing and extubation and the effects on gastrointestinal motility. Besides, a complete hemodynamical monitoring was performed by means of Swan-Ganz catheter and invasive arterial blood pressure measurement (HR, MAP, RAP, PAP, PCWP, CI, SVR, PVR) and serial blood samples were taken. Quality of sedation was estimated by Ramsay score. Results: The hemodynamical parameters, especially MAP and SVR were not influenced by GHA, but decreased in the beginning of administration of M and P. The duration of sedation was easily controllable during P and GHA, longer lasting during M. Shortest duration of postoperative mechanically ventilation we found in the P-group, followed by GHA. That time was significant prolonged after sedation with M. There was a good level of vigilance during P and GHA, worser during M. There was no influence on the gastrointestinal motility noted in P and GHA group, but restitution of gastrointestinal function was delayed in the M group. Furthermore, the need of analgetics was significant lower during sedation with P and GHA (30mg/15mg piritramid) than during M (75rag). Conclusions: Especially the physiological neurotransmitter GHA enables a sedation of high quality without any effects on the hemodynamical parameters and is therefore suitable for patients after cardiac surgery. Introduction: An increasing number of data indicates that cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is seriously impaired following open heart surgery (OHS). Objective of this prospective randomized study was to further delineate the mechanisms leading to these alterations. Patients and Methods: 20 patients (pts) formed control group A. 20 group B pts received 3x50 mg Indomethacin (lndo) from the first (dl) to the fourth postoperative day ((15) intravenously to block prostaglandin E2induced suppression of CMI response as well as 50 mg Thymopentin (TP-5) subcutaneously preop., on d2 and d4 to augment CMI reactivity. In vitro tests preop., on d] and d7 included measurements of the percentage of CD4+ T-helper (TH) cells, phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced synthesis of interleukin (IL)-2 as a cytokine primarily produced by TH1cells, and PHA-induced synthesis of IL-6 as a cytokine primarily produced by TH2-cells. Delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin response to an antigen skin test battery and specific antibody (AB) production following tetanus vaccination preop and on d7 were used as in vivo tests for TH1and TH2-induced immune response respectively. Results: Postoperatively, group A pts showed a persistent significant reduction of CD4+ TH cells, IL-2/IL-6 ratio, and DTH skin response as compared to baseline values (BL), while AB production increased (p<0.05 vs.BL). In group B pts no change in CD4+ TH cells, IL-2/IL-6 ratio, or DTH skin response was observed (p<0.05 vs.group A), and postoperative AB production increased significantly (n.s. vs. group A). Conclnsions: 1.These results clearly indicate a significant suppression of TH1 induced CMI response following OHS, while TH2 induced response remains normal. 2.These alterations may gain clinical significance whenever a postoperative infection requires a TH1 response. 3.The suppression of TH1 response can be effectively counteracted by administration of Indo and TP-5.",

Zerkowski, N.Doetsch, JC.Reidemeister Introduction: Intravenous (iv.) application of prostacycline leads to pulmonary vasodilatation besides decrease of the systemic blood pressure, and increase of intrapulmonary shunts with following hypoxemia. Methods: We have examined the effects of Epoprostenol (Epo) as an aerosol on pulmonary and systemic pressure and resistance and on oxygen content in 5 mechanically ventilated patients after cardiac surgery and compared with iv. application. In case of increase of the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) over 250 dyn*sec*cm \"5 the patients got 5 ng/kg KG/min Epo iv. opposite 5000 ng/5 mia as an aerosol. By means of Swan-Ganz catheter and intraarterial blood pressure measurement we noted among other things mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), right atrium pressure (RAP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), cardiac index (CI~, arterial oxygen partial pressure (.pO~) as well as the mixed arteriovenous oxygen content (SvOz), total peripheral resistance (TPR) and PVR. Results: During continuous iv. application of 5 ng/kgKG/min Epo PVR decreased from 278 (+/-18) to 204 (+/-18), TPR from 1113 (+/-121) to 670 (+/-173) dyn*sec*cm -5, whereas the arterial pO2 increased from 93.3 to 107 mmHg (Pie 2 0.5). The dose of 5000 ng/5 min led to a decrease of PVR from 300 (+/-31) to 150 (+/-21) and of TPR from 1109 (+/-98) to 928 (+/-104) dyn*sec*cm 5, whereas arterial PO2 increased from 84 to 99 mmHg. Conclusions: Especially the application of 5000 ng Epo as an aerosol achieves good results in decreasing PVR without considerably reducing systemic blood pressure. Due to the low number of patients no final statement can be made about the effects of Epoprostenol as an aerosol on hemodynamical parameters. Nevertheless, our results lead to the conclusion that this kind of application of prostacycline should become more important and that the effects in further clinical studies with higher case numbers should be controlled.

The removal of the emboli of supposed cardiac origin was performed under repeated direct intraarterial UH-injections. Postoperatively the antithrombotic medication was started with 600 IE UH par hour, and from the next day onwards changed to 5.000 IE UH s.c. every 6 hours despite platetet counts of 43.000 and 63.000 respectively. Without regaining normal platelet counts the patient suffered a second time emboli of supposed cardiac origin. Again the extraction was performed with repeated direct intrarterisl UH-injections.

Geroutanos Following bypass surgery, postoperative cardiac patients are ventilated for a short period of time. However, some patients require ventilatory support which may exceed 48 hours. In this study, we investigated factors associated with prolonged (>2 d) mechanical ventilation. 533 consecutive patients undergoing open heart surgery (July 15, to December 31, 1993) were included in this study. Among several other factors, preoperative ejection fraction, NYHA class, type of cardioplegia, bypass time, aortic cross clamp time, number of grafts used and blood transfusions were recorded.",

            "text": "Introduction: Commercial equipment dedicated to multichannel physiologic measurements is very expensive. Linking a personal computer (PC) to clinical monitors via RS-232C serial links lacks speed and flexibility in both setup and raw data processing. For bedside investigations, the device should be small, flexible in configuration, and allow for raw data transfer to PCs. We present a low cost solution for AT-type PCs. Methods: Disposable statham pressure transducers already in whitespread clinical use (DPT-2000, pvb, Kirchseeon, FRG) each are interfaced to the PC via a plug-in differential amplifier with integrated stabilized sensor voltage supply, and a common 16-channel analog-to-digital converter (A/D) board with 14 bit resolution (short slot). Custom software is written in PowerBasic (Spectra Publishing, USA). Results: The slope of the sensors is factory-adjusted. Stability is specified and excellent. By design, the gain of each amplifier is about 1200, and its frequency response is flat from zero to well above 3000 Hz. Zero-offset drift is negligible. The costs of the components of each amplifier are < 10 US$. The A/Dboard is standard at a cost of 200 US$. Maximum sampling rate is 1500/sec (386-SX, 16 MHz, 1 active channel) and inversely related to the number of active channels. Pressure resolution is 1/6 mm Hg, the range is 4-150 mm Hg. Data is stored on harddisk. Discussion: Zerooffset calibration is purely computational thus simplifying electronic circuitry. There is no need for range switching. The sampling rate can be varied according to individual demands, If anti-aliasing filtering was needed it could be easily incorporated. For purposes of longterm monitoring, an auto-sampling mode is provided with simultaneous sampling and data reduction. Dependent on the type of transducer used, monitoring is not restricted to pressures. The program performs well on a battery-powered laptop thus providing the required electrical insulation. Exogenous phosphooreatine (PCr) possesses the cardioprotective property as we have shown in cardiac surgery with 082dioplegi&",

In two boys (1.7 and 5.2 years, both with trisomy 21 and repair of a complete AV-canal), no apparent decrease of PHT during NO-application could be observed, and the NO admixture was discontinued.

The consumption of glutathione (GSH) and alfa-tocopherol (Vit El, endogenous antioxidam compounds, has been reported following isehemia and reperfusion (IR) during aortic surgery in man, suggesting a free radicals oxidative damage (I). An imbalance of microvascular permeability, leading to an increase of extravaseular lung water (EVLW), is associated with IR (2). The present study evaluated the effect of preoperative Vii E loading and intraoperative GSH administration on EVLW, in patients submitted to aortic cross-clamping during surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. METHODS. 30 male patients ( mean age 68.3 sd 4.2 years) were randomly assigned to: group 1 (GI, 10 patients), receiving Vit E 1200 mg p.o. for the 5 days before surgery; group 2 (G2, 10 patients), receiving intraoperative GSH i.v., 50 mg kg during aortic clamping, 50 mg kg during reperfusion; group 3 (G3, 10 patients), controls. EVLW was measured, by bioimpedonce, 5'(T2) and 45' (T3) after clamping, 5' (T4) and 45' (T5) after clamp release, as percent variation of the preclamping values (T1), assumed as baseline. Femoral venous lacmte (mg/dL), metabolic index of lower limb isehemia, was measured at T1, T3 and T5. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using ANOVA test (intragroup) and Wileoxon test (intergroup, G3 vs G1, G3 vs G2). A p value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS. Clamping times were similar (GI 81'; G2 77'; G3 74'; n.s.). In every group femoral venous lactate concentration was significantly higher at T3 and I\"5, showing a post-ischemia anaerobic metabolism (Tab 1). A continous increase of EVLW occurred during ischemia and reperfusion in the control group (G3 Introduction: Diabetic patients tmdergoing major surgery need delicate perioperative management of the carbohydrat metabolism. An anlomalic bkxxl glucose control (artificial pancreas) is not yet available lbr wide spread clinical use and the usual treatment is diffienh. The goat of this study was to dcveloped a new bedside semi-closed loop computer control system in order to maintain eaglycaemia. Methods: The equipment consists of a PC, two comurcrcial peristaltic infusinn pumps lbr insuli~ and glucose with a con~puter interlhce and a gluense measuring instrument. A blood sample masl be taken and the bleed glucose concentratian has to be detorrained within intetwals ranging from 10 minutes upto 2 hours and has to be entered into the computer. The principle of the control programme is to gain a prediction of blood glua~se value and also to obtain a predictive calculation of insulin and gluense inthsian rates used to maintain euglycaenfia. During the first stage of the control, the nnrmalization algoritlun is activated to ensure a stable normoglycaemic bl(~l glucose level, qbe .second and main stage is the euglyeaemic control phase, llere a split occurs restdting h~ two algorithms, a basal rate control algorithm and a bolus conUol algorithm. Results: The control system was uscd durialg the metabolic periopcrativc management of 13 unstable diabetics undergoing major surgery. We were able to maintain euglycaemia (4 -8 maul/l) during the perioperative peried (uplo 60 hanrs) in order to avoid hypo-atal hyperglycaemic complications and were able to shorten the convalescent period. Normoglycaemia was established pleoperalively within 2 hours. Itereby the preoperative stationary treatment was avoided where the actual insulin demand has to be manually monitored in case of a blood glucose elevation. The avoidance of this procedure was obtain tinough unmediate preoperative nmuahzation of rite blood glucose value. As the NEFA serum concentration was reduced to a subnouual level (< 0,4 mmoLq) and an increase of osmolarity was also prevented, we efl~ctively avoid an acute metabolic disturbance with the associated ctanplications. We achieved a gc~.,d metabolic control through discontinuous blood glucose measuring at freely chosen intervals. Upto 32 g of gluense were adininistored per hour. Conclusion: We devised a bedside semi-closed loop computer control system in order to nmintain euglycacmia during pea-ioperative period of 13 unstable diabetics. The ,system needs a discontinuous manual blood glucose measurement at fi-eety chosen intervals apto 2 hours by feeding the data into the computer. The computer control system is able to obtain a predictive calculation of insulin and glucose infilsion rates {o maintain euglycaanfia and In control directly the infusion puurps. ",

Acute lung injury and hectehemia are usual complications. Major resections of the colon may be associated with substantial morbidi%y in the postoperative period.In a prospective study of 33 patients suffering from acquired megacolon and requiring either anterior resection or pull-through operation,standard anthropometric and biochemical measurements as well as the P.N.I. of Buzby & Mullen were preoperatively assessed.Mean age of the population was 49 ~ 13 years,with 17 males/16 females.The combined nutritional score indicated 63.6% of malnutrition(21/33),whereas the PNI rev ealed 3 high-risk cases(9.1%),9 with moderate risk(27.3%),and reduced risk for all others.No mortality occurred in this series,but 39.4%(13/ 33) displayed surgical or septic problems.Chisquare analysis confirmed that both studied crit erie were significantly associated with complications (p <0.05),as morbidity was restPicted predominantly to cases with unfavorable PNI results or clear signs of nutritional deficit. Conclusions: l)Bo~h the PNI and conventional nut m tritional assessment are valuable tools for the screening of high-risk surgical candidates; 2)A_r tificial alimentation was not employed in this experience,but it deserves consideration in selected patients; 3)Although no mortality was observed.morbidity is still common a\u00a3ter colon resec~lon. Perioperative therapy of blood loss with albumin 5 % (ALB) is expensive. Medium-molecular-weight 6% hydroxyethylstarch 200/0.5 (MW-HES) is widely used but it is unclear wether HES affects renal function, when applicated in doses above 20ml/kg(bw)/24h. We evaluated the ability of MW-HES to replace ALB solely as colloid component for the treatment of large blood losses. Methods: In 2 randomized groups of each 25 patients undergoing large urological surgery (criteria of exclusion : anemia, coagulation or renal disorders) we treated intraoperatively following a substitution scheme and postoperatively following threshold values of bloodvolume, Hkt and PT, PTT with colloid solution, packed red blood cells (PRBC) and fresh frozen plasma. Group HES received MW-HES and group HA ALB as exclusive colloid component. During the study period we compared renal parameters before operation (M0), post op(M1) and 6h(M2) ld(M3) 2d(M4) and 3d(M5) post op. Statistics: (Wilcoxontest) Results: Reliable laboratory parameters are still lacking for accurate diagnosis of perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI). Our aim was to evaluate Troponin T (TnT; pg/I), a new protein marker, comparing it to ECG alterations and to the following enzymes indicating myocardial ischemia: creatine kinase (CK, U/I), CK4soenzymes (immunoinhibited; CKMB; U/I) and CKMB Mass (CKMB Stratus; #g/I). Nine standardized serum levels were measured preoperatively until 112 hours postoperatively in 51 patients submitted to the following procedures: 23 coronary bypass operations, 13 valve replacements, 9 complex cardiac repairs and 6 replacements of the infrarenal aorta. Age, gender and preoperative risk factors were not significantly different among the surgical groups. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery were divided in the following groups accoring to ECG criteria: h no ECG changes; I1: reversible ECG changes, Ilh silent ECG changes, IV: PMh * p < 0,05 vs group I and 111 n r\u00b0\u00b0ps ' 2,8 +_ TNT (pg/I) 5,9 +-7,0 5,9 + 3,9 13,2 +-0,8* Troponin*T was always elevated in cardiac surgical cases and was significantly higher when compared to the vascular cases (4,43 #g/I vs. 0,18 ~t g/I; p < 0,02). Furthermore a significant increase in Troponin-T levels was present in all cases with PMI (ECG-group, group Ill/IV; p < 0,05) and seems to correlate with the severity of the infarct. Using a multiple regression analysis the best non-invasive blood chemistry assay for detecting a PMI was Troponin-T (p < 0,02) followed by CKMB mass (p < 0,03) and CKMB (p < 0,04) and showed a sensitivity of 87 and a specificity of 92 %. In a multivariate analysis the following predictors for TnT elevation were significant: amount of defibrillations, degree of ECG-changes and dose of lidocaine given perioperatively. TnT was independent of age, aortic cross clamp time, type of operation, inotropic support and previous infarction.",

INTRODUCTION -The p~ary non fimction syndrome (PNF), after orthotopie hver tmusplantation, shows incrcscs of SGOT and SGPT, reduction or lack of biliary productio~ s\u00a2~e deteriorations in coagulation. It may develop into hypogly~crnia, hepatic enccphalopathy and rer~l failure. Usually, this syndrome is studied in four degrees ofinereasmg severity, in clinical and laboratoP.stic terms. The use ofptostaglandins is effective in patients with PNF, bemuse the drug can improve the hacmodynamic situation and, in particular, the splanchnic perfbsion METHODS -Prostagiandins (PGEI; Prostin VR, Upjohn) were used in 24 patients, affected with PNF, aRer o~otopic liver Wansplantation. The main indication for the use of the drug was a biliary production less than 40 mi/24 hrs, with modified physical characteristics. 10 patients showed PNF at degree t, 3 patients at degree 2, 6 patients at degree 3 and 5 patients at degree & PGE1 was given using a ~nahal venous catheter, at mean dosage of 0.043 meg/kg/min 0ira.-&02 -0.08 meg/kg/min). The mean lime of administration was 144 hours Oim: 48 -432 hours). In all patients, laboratorishe parameters concerning hepatic function and coagulation were studied. RESULTS -Among all patients, only one died for liver failure, three days after liver transplantation. In this case, PGE1 adrninlstmtion did not get any clinical effect_ In the other eases, it. was possible to get an increase in production of bile (biliary flux > 100 ml/24 hrs), usually after 48 hours of therapy 0L~aits: 24 hours in 3 patients and 120 hours in 1 patient). After a mean time of three days of treaanent, it was possible to observe a reduction (nearly 50 %) in the levels of SCOT and SGFT. In the following time, SGOT quickly reaches values in a range of normality. It is more difficult to study correctly the changes in coagulation, because all patients received large amounts of fresh frozen plasma daily. In a similar way, bilirubin levels (which showed a precociously decreasing trend) are influenced by infiasion of whole blood or red packed cells, during the ICU period. CONCLUSIONS -A precocious therapy with PGE 1 is helpful in the treahneat of PNF afrer liver ~ansptantation; this drug can get satisfactory results in short times. tt is possible that an tmsuecess.ful use of PGEI may represent a prognostic tmfavomable index in the evointiort of PNF syndrome, because non-responder pa~ents may develop a complete liver insufficiency. A t~scuriun besylate is a biodegradable conloetitive neur~nuscular blocking agent. Authors advieed to be more useful agent for transplantation because of it has short distribution and elimination half life.",

Many markers for PNF have been evaluated, but no one is optimal. Veeuroaium bromide, a neuromuscular blocking agent, is sequestered in and metabolized predominantly by the liver. This study was undertaken to determine if delayed return of NM function correlates with allogrdft primary dysfunction in humans.t Methods: With institutional approval and consent, twenty4wo adult patients undergoing OLTX were given identical general anesthetics. An initial dose of veenronium, 0.1 mg/kg, was given prior to the start of surgery. NM blockade was monitored by observing the motor response of the orbieularis scull muscle to supramaximal stimulation of the facial nerve with a Ministim MS-II peripheral nerve stimulator (Life-Teeh, Inc., Houston, Texas USA). The train-of-four mode was used} The time from attaining complete NM blockade to return of the 4th twitch was noted in order to ascertain that all patients had the pre-transptant ability to metabolize veeuronium. No additional NM blocker was given until the liver graft was implanted and reperfused. Fifteen minutes after reperfusion another 0.1 mg/kg veeuroalum was given. The time from attaining complete NM blockade to return of the 4th twitch (recovery time [RT]) was noted. The patients' outcome was followed, and the patients were divided into 3 groups according to postoperative liver function. Group I consisted of patients with immediate normal liver graft function. Group II consisted of patients with initiaUy poor functioning grafts (peak SGOT and SGPT > 2000 U/L, FW > 16 seconds, and poor quality and quantity of bile within 3 days pest.-op) which eventually recovered normal function. Group tll consisted ofpatients with non-life, sustaining liver graft function (uneorreetable coagulopathy, severe metabolic acidosis, rising transaminases, and minimal or no bile output), whose grafts never recovered. Results: Results are summarized in Table 1 . There was also a strong linear correlation between RT and peak SGOT (R=0.62, p=0.002) and RT vs. peak SGPT (R=0.696, p=0.0003). Other variables which may affect NM function (ereatinine, intra-op temperature, end-tidal eoncontratinn isoflurane) did not differ significantly between groups.",

In our unit, over a 6mouth period [may-ast] in 1991, seven renal transplant recipients developed PCP. This was a significant change from our past experience with this disease, since only 2 cases had been observed over the preceding 5-year period. All patients were HIVnegative. Since 1986 we have been using the same immunosuppressive protocoIs for renal transplantation. The seven patients received OKT3 for the first fourteen days associated with low-dose steroids and azathioprine, with a delayed introduction of cicinsporin in six patients. Acute graft rejection episodes were treated with three intravenous injections of methylprednisolone. No prophylaxis for PCP was used. All episodes of PCP were diagnosed by the presence of cysts of Pneumocystis carinii in broncbealvenlar lavage (LBA) specimens. PCP occurred 140 (41-578) days after renal transplantation. Six patients experienced 1 episode of acute rejection in 3 cases and 2 episodes in 3 cases. All patients were treated by trimethoprime-sulfamethoxaxole (TMX). Outcome was favorable in 5 cases, but 3 patients died from respiratory failure. When survivors were compared with non-survivors, differences were observed in Pa02 on admission (p<0.05) in serum LDH increase (p < 0,05), and in the use of mechanical ventilation (p<0.05). Cytomegalovirus co-infection was identified in 6 patients by isolation of the vires from blood and/or LBA. Four bacterial co-infections were also observed. After institution of routine prophylaxis with TMX, only one case of PCP has developed, in a patient who was not receiving adequate prophylaxis at the time PCP was diagnosed. In 1987 a new medical unit devoted to AIDS patients was located in the same building as our own unit. Each anit has its own medical staff, but RTR and HIV-infected patients, sometimes shared waiting rooms and some of the rooms used for various treatments including pertamidine aerosols. It is thus tempting to speculate that inter-human contamination could have been a cause of PCP, as suggested earlier in SwitzeNand and France. During the epidemic all infected RTR had been admitted in the transplant unit, with overlapping stays, and thus transmission of the disease between PCP RTR and non infected RTR could have been possible.",

Recent studies have been suggested that gut barrier failure may contribute to multiple organ failure (MOF) by allowing bacteria and endotoxin to escape the gut and enter the portal and systemic circulations, where they may help fuel the septic process. It is postulated that use of SDD to maintain colonization resistance and selectively eliminate potential pathogens in gastrointestinal tract may reduce exposure of the host to circulating bacteria and/or endotoxemia in circumstances in which gut permeability is abnormally high following major injury. The present study was performed to find out whether bacterial translocat{on and endotoxemia from the gut in rats with thermal injury (40% full-thickness scald ii~jury) could be prevented by SDD. t&eslllt~ In the SDD-treated group, Enterobactedaceae and yeasts were eradicated from the gut, while the mucosal flora consisting of mainly anerobes was well preserved, within three days, and the incidence of bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes and viscerae was significantly lower on postburn day 1, 3 and 5 (P<0.05-0.01). Meanwhile, pretreatment with SDD could markedly attenuate the increase of endotoxin concentrations in both portal and systemic blood (P<0.05-0.01), resulting in a reduction of the endotoxin levels of faecal supernatants to less than 0.5% of the untreated control. Intestinal diamine oxidase (DAO) activity returned to normal in treatment group 5 days later (622.8+170.4 vs 738.0+7g.2 DPM/mg, P>0.05). The five-day survival rate in the SDD-treated group increased 26.7% as compared with control group (x==4.57, P<O.05), Conclusion~;_The results indicated that selective decontamination was highly effective in preventing bacterial transiocation, and gut origin endotoxemia and mortality in rats following severe thermal-injury. It therefore was supposed that SDD might be of value in decreasing the risk of endogenous-derived infections and complications in patients with large burns. Infection after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) still is a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality. In contrast to immunocompetent patients, life-threatening pneumonias in patients aider OLT are often caused by opportonistic infections (OI) such as cytomegalovirus(CMV), legionelta, pneumocystis carinii, aspergillus and M.tuberculosis. Pneumonias in these patients often show a severe clinical course and high mortality rate. From September 1988 to February 1993 350 OLT's were performed in 325 patients with an actuarial 1-year patient survival of 90%, actually 275 patients (85%) are alive. The mean follow up time is 758 (I-1803) days. The charts of these patients were reviewed for pneumonias. 49 pneumonias occurred in 41 patients, 29 (59\"%) were due to OI. incidence (n) severe (n) mortality (n) 12 7 4/7=57% 5 5 3/5=6O% 4 4 2/4=50% 3 3 0/3=0% 5 5 4/5=80% 29 21 13/21=62% In 13 patients pneumonia was responsible or a major contributing factor for fatal outcome, all of them had an OI. The main cause of live-threatening pneumonia are the OI's, which achieve a great importance in transplanted patients because of their overall mortality rate of 62%. To prevent severe complications due to OI's an aggressive protocol of diagnosis and therapy should be applied as soon as infections occur.",

            "text": "Dept.of Surgery, Free University of Berlin, Augustenburger Platz, 13353 Berlin, Germany Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is defined as the development of eneephalopathy within 8 weeks of the onset of an acute liver disease. Despite sophisticated i~ltensive care, mortality rates for FHF range between 50% and 90%. At the university hospital of Vie.~na IM~ t~nsp~n1~ion has been applied as an ad~ional therapeutic intervention for FHF since 1987. In this study we examined the severity of disease and hospital mortality in patients with FHF before and after the establishment of liver transplantation in cases of FHF at our insgtation. November 1993, 48 patients with FHF (19 male, 29 female, age 36,6 + 2t,4) were 1teated at our [CU. The etiology was: hepatitis B infection (n=15); amanita intoxication (n=l 2); drug induced mac~ions (n=5); Morbus Wilson (n=4); heppt~is C infection (n=2); un~'~wn etiology (P.=~O)~ 16 patients had acquired FHF before the establishment of liver transptastation for FHF (group A) and 32 after that point (group 8) This study shows that the establishment of liver transplantation for FHF induces a tendency towards decreased hospital mortality. Thus, the duration of stay in our ICU was significantly decreased, although the two groups did not differ in severity of disease.",

PALACIO OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the causes of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) In obstetric patients, the coml>llcatlons end maternal and fetal outcome. METHODS: We review 38 obstetric patients with ARDS, admtttad to the surgical or medical intensive care units at our hospital, between Jan. 1986 and Jan. 1993. Crk~ for diagnosis of ARDS was defined as hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanicatventll~Jon, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure tess than 18 mrnHg and e tung Injury score > 2.5. RESULTS: There were 64250 deliveries with an Inddance of ARDS of 1 per 1691 deliveries. 79% ( n = 30 ) were in the third trimester. TIle prl~l~l ~ were infections ( n = 18), eclampsia ( n = 12 ), hemorlt,,age ( n = 4 ), trauma ( n = 3 ), and gastric a$pi~ation ( n = i ). infectious, (;auses Includ~ pr~monla ( n = 10 ), cherioarnnionitis ( n = 4 ), pyetortephrtt!s ( n = 3 ) and endocardt'ds ( n = 1 ). Mesh number of days In mechanical vsntlletion was 14.I -~ 8.6 ( range 4 to 45 days ). Only 4 patients had significant medical disease prior the pregnancy ( 10% ). Bacieriemla developed In 68% of the patients ( n = 26 ) and multiple organ failure In 55% of the patients ( n = 21 ), Maternal mortality was 47% ( n = 18 ). In 30 pregnancies that reschad viability ( >. 24 weeks of gestation ) there was a perlnatal mortality of 29% (n=tl). ~ONCLUSIONS: The main causes of ARDS In pregnancy are infection, toxsmla and hemorrhage.

The objectiveofthispaper is to analyse the frequency with whicb monitoring S~2 has originated changes in the treatment of patients with severe head injury. Material and Metheds: We mtudiedl3 patients with severe head ingurywhose management included the monitoring of S~O 2. The utility of Sj02menitoring was classified in three levels: A) Ma~or changes in treatment as a r~ult of S~O 2 monitoring (E,g.: withdrawal of hyperveatilation, or of Manito D . B) Control of the effectivenessoftherapeutic measures with minor changes in the treatment. C) The monitoring bad no influence on the ~eatment. Results: ~ patients were eiansifled in level A, ~th were on b~erventilatien (PaC02 26 and 28 m~Hg), and after'the placing of the SjO 2 catheter severe ischemia was detected (S~O~ of 46% and 49%). In both cases the S}O 2 zeturned to normal levels on the\u00b0withdrawal of byperventilation without-changes in cerebral perf~ion pressure. Seven patients were classified in level B, The greatest utility of the monitoring was in its Confirmation of the absen~ of isehemia from byperventilation, whose levels could then be modified. In the rest of the patients the monitoring of S]02 had no influence on the treatment. Conclusions: The inclusion of the monitoring of el02 in the management protocol of severe head injurypatients allows for a more rational therapeutic approach. SERVIClO DE I~EDICINA I~ENSI~.

Rhythmic variations of cerebral blood volume (CBV) and neurologic outcome in asphyxiated preterm infants. Elelm Syutkma, A.Abramian, M.Mitish, A.Grigoriev Perinatal cerebral ischemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurological abnormalities later in life. Near-infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS) [Reynolds E: Br. Med. BuLl. 44:1052, 1988], gives the possibility to observe in real time the changes of oxy-and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations (HbO & Hb) in the brain of newborn infants. The aim of tiffs study was to estimate the role of CBV variations in the development of brahl damage in asphyxiated preterm hafants. Methods: Hb & HbO were measured continuously during 25 h in 9 preterm infants (GA 30-35 wks; BW 1700-2100 g; Apgar score 4/5-6/8, age 2-14 d) by means of home-made NIRS instrument with wavelengths 740, 790, 830, 870 and 940 nm and used for calculations of CBV. Simultaneously blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation and blood gases were recorded by means of monitors BX5 (Colin) & TCM222 (Radiometer). All data were computer processed by Single Cosinor [Halberg F: Ann. Rev. Physiol. 31:675,1969] for quantification of amplitude (A), acrophase & rhythm-adjusted mean (M) of 24-h rhythm. Four infants were neurologically normal (gr. 7v) at the age of 11-12 months, 5 had moderate abnormalities (group Ab). Results: all infants had 24-h rhytlun of CBV (P<.001). The values of A were slightly higher and values of bathymetron (B=M-A; rrd/100g) were significantly lower in Ab 1 0(3.3-+0.8) than in N infants (6.0-+0.8; P<.01), Multiple regression analysis revealed that M & A of CBV rhytlml depended mainly on the same parameters of SBP & MAP rhythms. All infants with B<5 but only 1 of 5 infants with B>5 (20%) belonged to group Ab.Conclusions: Marked decrease of CBV as a part of its 24-h rhythm in neonatal period is cormected with the development of neurologic disorders later in life; quantification of B of 24-h CBV rhythm allowed to predict the neurologic outcome in asphyxiated preterm infants.Institute of Pediatrics, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences,",

Ftfleen healthy volunteers (10 males and 5 females, mean age 34 _* lg|were studied. An indwelling venous catheter was placed in a peripheral vein and lg ml of blood were drawn at different time in order to evaluate cytokines| IL6, TNF, ILl] levels and Malonyldlaideide (MDA] production [as index of lipid peroxidatton). Blood samples were collected at different times and condiffons: TO: subjects breathing room air;, T1:[2 ATA~; T2:12.8 ATA]; T3: 30 min after hyperbaric exposure. Eight subjects entered hyperbaric chamber in hyperoxic conditions [group /~, the remaining 7 without oxygen supplementation (group B). All blood samples after centrlfugation were stored at~80\"C and than analysed for cytokines by EUSA and MOA by spectrophotometrlc technique. Results were stattsttcagy evaluated by ANOVA. tTesu#s:lL6, TNF and ILl did not change significantly, over the study period, Independently from oxygen supplementation, On the other hand MDA significantly Increased daring time [basal vs T2:1.41 ~ 0.6 vs 2.22 \u00b1 1.13 mMol/L p<0,0O2 and basal vs T3 : 1.41 _* 0.6 vs 2.4|\u00b1 1.26 mMoI/L p<0,OOl|.

Iarmuzzi E., De Blasio E., Ferraro F., De Sio A., Mocavero P.E., D'Agostino A., Schiralcli F., Minichini A., Mignone A., Violante D. Introduction: Central venous blood is been used in evaluation of 02 delivery/consumption bMance instead of mixed venous to reduce the risks of invasivity. We have used a modified technique of temporary pace-maker positioning in the central venous catheterism to reduce the central-mixed venous BGA gap. Methods: We obtained an electrical bridge between the tip of the catheter and the lead of the EKG monitor using isotonic NaC1 (0.9%). Guided by intracavitary EKG modifications we have withdrawn 25 blood samples (12 pts.) in Superior Veua Cava (SVC), High Right Atrium (HRA), Mid Right Atrium (MRA), Low Right Atrium (IRA), and Right Ventricle (RV) for gas analysis.",

Using laser Doppler flowmetry capable of continuous evaluatio~ of blood flow in skeletal muscle (Sm) microcirculation , we tested ths hypothesis whether or not microcirculation and its reactivity to hypoxia are altered in septic patients compared with non septic patients. Methods : In a prospective study including 16 patients meeting th~ criteria of severe sepsis, we measured hemodynamics, 02 transport variables and basal (Sm) microvascular blood flow (MBF). MBF and blooc flow during reactive hyperemia (MBF-RH) were analyzed by continuous laser Doppler flowmetry (Per\u00b1flux FP3, Perimed, Sweden). React\u00b1v( hyperemia, exploring microvaseular reactivity to hypoxia was elicited b) a 3 minute ischemia stimulus.

To elucidate a role of different thrombin activities in development of multiple organ dysfunction (primary MODS) in early stage of the acute DIC we have studied effects of the acute systemic prothrombin activation in rats \"in vivo\". To conclude: in ongoing acute DIC the systemic conversion of FBG with the release of both A and B fibriuopeptides plays a key role in development of early MODS. Development of later MODS in acute DIC seems to be triggered by complex activities of thrombin, however, conversion of fibfinogen is net essential. A direct and induced injury of microvascular iutima is very likely the most important pathogenic mechanism. qnstimte for the Care of Mother & Child, Dept. of CCM, Prague, Czech Republic ZDept. of Pathophysiology, 2 \"~ Medical Faculty, Charles Univ., Prague, Czech Rep.

To evaluate the predictive performance of these systems in Portugal we studied a population of 3 ICUs in our University Hospital. METHODS: We collected prospective data on 640 consecutive patients admitted over a period of one year, SAPS (SPy, APACHE II (A2) and APACHE III (A3) scores were obtained over the first 24 hours of ICU admission; data also included age, sex, acute and chronic diseases, ICU and hospital length of stay\" (LOS), patient location prior to ICU admission and outcome. The relationship of hospital mortality, with SE A2 and A3 scores was analyzed using logistic regression, with the discriminatory power of these systems being assessed by the area under the ROC curve and percentage of cor-; mean scores were: SAPS=8+4 points, APACHE II=10_+6 points and APACHE III=37.4_+21 points. There was a significant relationship between ascending SR A2 and A3 scores and HMR. Table shows the diagnostic performance of the 3 systems. CONCLUSIONS: we conclude that: 1) the 3 scoring systems demonstrated a good outcome prediction in our population; 2) APACHE III showed the best predictive performance; 3) together with other clinical data, these system are useful tools lbr analysis of critical patients admitted to ICUs in our hospitalDepartment of Medicine 4-UCIM, S.

The effects were related to the level of ventilation needed by the patients. No significant changes were found in respiratory rate neither between DF and CF nor between high and low minute volume group. The workload associated with both CPAP systems was found to he related to the minute volume of the patients. Only in the patients with the high minute volume the DF system was associated with a significant increased WOBcir. In these patients the CF system did reduce both WOBcir and WOBres.

VAN BOS, F,VAN HILLE, D. YSEBAERT. P. VAN LAECKE, A. VANDERKELEN High frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV) is a recent ventilamry technique which combines advantages of conventional respiratory support with some of high frequency ventilation: high frequency cycles (400 to 800/rain) are associated with conventional cycles. 8 ICU patients were studied in steady state under conventional ventilation (CV-Dfiiger Evita) and under HFPV (at two frequency rates 400 and 800/rain) (VDR4, Percussionaire Corp. -USA) at similar conditions (FiO2, tidal volume, I:E ratio). Veatilatory pressures were measured by oesophageal transducer (Bicore). Under HFPV hemodynamic data are not significantly modified (IIeart rate (HR), Cardiac Output (CO), Pulmonary Wedge Pressure and mean arterial pressure). Peak Iuspiratory Pressure (PIP) is sigthcantly lower under HFPV and Menu inspiratory pressure (MIP) is unchanged. No significant intrinsic PEEP (PEEPi) was generated under HFPV Blood oxygenation and CO2 elimination were significautly im~pmved under HFPV. Conclusion: ItFPV could improve pulmonary gas exchanges under lower peak ventilatory pressures and without hemodynamic compromise. Crit Care Departement-Royal Military Hospital, Brussels -Belgium P, REPER. F. VAN HILLE, D. YSEBAERT, P. VAN LAECKE, A. VANDERKELEN Pulmonary atelectasis is frequently encountered in critically ill patients, specially under artificial ventilation. Persistent atelectasis leading to hypoxemia and pulmonary infection needs particularly an aggressive therapeutic approach. Ten patients (8 smokers) developed under artificial ventilatory support persistent lobar atelectasis resistant to current treatments including antibiotics, mucolytics, aerosols and physiotherapy (vibration, suction, postural drainage ...). All these patients developed a clinical respiratory deterioration with diagnostic of a lobar atelectasis on chest roentgenogram. Repeated fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed in all patients without definitive and complete resolution of the lobar atelectasis.Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV, delivered through a Volumetric Diffusive Respirator, combinated with a conventional ventilator) was applied every two hours leading in all cases to the normalisation of the pulmonary clinical and radiological status, within 8 hours after the first application of the high frequency percussions (100 to 400 cycles/rain). Tolerance was excellent in all patients; no side effects were noted. Sputum volume cleared after starting IPV was greater than before.This observation suggests that IPV can be a usefull therapeutic method to improve pulmonary drainage in intubated patients and to resolve persistent pulmonary atelectasis.Critical Care Departemem -CESM-Roy Military Hospital, Bmssets-Belgium VENO-ARTERIAL GRADIENT IN C02 IS NOT CORRELATED TO CARDIAC] INDEX IN SEVERE ARDS D.

Lachmaan.Introduction Paraquat (1,l-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridylium dichloride) is a widely used weed killer of the bipyridylium class which causes fatal pulmonary atelectasis in a variety of experimental animals and in humans. Up to now, no putative treatments of paraquat poisoning have proved clinical efficacy. Previous studies in rats suggested that paraquat poisoning is associated with qualitative and quantitative pulmonary surfactant defect, which results in lung edema, respiratory failure and finally fibrosis, Therefore a study was designed to investigate the effect of surfactant replacement therapy on gas exchange in rats with progressive respiratory failure due to paraquat intoxication. Methods Twenty female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected subcutaneously with paraquat, 35 mg/kg bodyweight. Conclusion These results indicate that exogenous surfactant instillation may help patients with severe paraquat intoxication to overcome an acute stage of respiratory distress.Department of Anesthesiology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.STANDARDISAT1ON OF ECMO-ENTRY-CRITERIA IN ARDS PATIENTS: EXTRACORPOREAL SUPPORT VERSUS MECHANICAL VENTILATION USING A COMPUTERISED PROTOCOL.

Weaning indexes may be inaccurate in predicting weaning outcome due to differences in patient population. The aim of this study is to analyse some weaning indexes in patients recovering from ARF of various etiologies. Methods: We studied 188 intubated patients judged ready to be weaned:32 COPD patients, 37 neurologic patients FIO2<0.4 and maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP)>-20cmH20]   were present and when the patients clinically tolerated a 2-hour of T piece trial (TT), extubation was performed. If clinical intolerance during MV at the end of TT or who required reintubation within 48h of extubation. Before TT, minute volume(VE), f/VT, PC.I, VC, MIP and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) were performed. Results were analyzed by means of ANOVA. Results: O5. After two hours of clinical tolerance of TTf there were no reintubations in COPD patients, while 12(32%) neurologics patients and 7(6%) acute patients were reintubated (P<O. 05 ). Conclusions : 1 ) Classic weaning indexes plus TT are very useful in deciding whether or not extubation should be performed. 2) The high incidence of reintubations in neurologic group was clinically due to an inability to clear respiratory secretions, possibly related to the low MEP.

Therefore, the effect of surfactant therapy on established influenza A pneumonia in mice was tested. Methods: 40 male NMRI mice were randomly divided in 2 groups (n = 20). On day 0 of the experiment both groups were infected with aerosolized live influenza A virus (nebulized virus suspension HA titer 1:8) On day 5 after infection, group 1 received 100 1~1 intratracheally of a bovine surfactant suspension (t 0 mg/ml). Group 2 was sham treated with 100 tsl of Hepes buffer and served as controls. Deaths were recorded every 12 hours till day 12 after infection. Statistical analysis was performed with product limited survival estimates. Results: During the instillation of fluid on day 5 after infection, one animal died in the surfactant treated group. Survival in the surfactant treated group was significantly increased compared to the control animals; p = 0.0055 (log-rank) In the control group, all animals (n=20) died of influenza A pneumonia between day 7 and 12 after infection. In the surfactant treated group, only 10 animals died between days 8 and 12. On day 12 after infection, 45% of the animals in the surfactant treated group were alive versus 0% in the control group. Conclusion: The results show that surfactant treatment improves survival in influenza A infected mice. Surfactant instillation seems, therefore, a promising approach in the treatment of viral pneumonia.

TaegerIntroduction: In intensive care units (ICU's), scoring systems serve to classify the severity of illness and to predict the outcome. In a recent study [1], 4 severity scores were found Io correlate statistically with the outcome of 70 head-tranmatized patients. We investigated the predictive value of 5 scoring systems in neurosurgical ICU-patients with traumatic and nontraumatic disorders.Methods: Mortality Prediction Model(MPM, 2 versions: 'admission' and '24 h'  [2]), Simplified Acute Physiology ScoreSAPS [3]  and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation5]) were calculated in 93 patients conseeutively~ The diagnoses were: intracranial tumor (33 pts.), intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage (26), head trauma (25), others (9). The mean and median values of the groups of survivors and nonsurvivors were compared by Mann-Whitney-U-test. Receiver-operating characteristics-(ROC) -analyses and the areas under the ROC-eurves were calculated. Results: 25/93 patients (= 26.8 %) died during hospital stay. In each score we found a statistically significant (p < 0.001) difference between the groups(table 1). APACHE-III and MPM-24-h showed the best prognostic capacity, expressed by the ROC-area.Table:Mean values and standard deviations of 5 scores; *** = p<0.001 Conclusions: In our study, 5 scoring systems were able to give an accurate prognosis of the hospital mortality after the admission of 93 neurosurgical patients at the ICU. Each score includes an assessment of the level of neurologic derangements. APACttE-III seems to be the best predictive system, using an expanded modification of the Glasgow Coma Scale.References: l.Rocca ] Trauma 1989 29:299. 2.Lemesbow Crit Care Med 1985 13:519. 3.LeGall Crit Care Med 1984 12:975. 4.Khans Crit Care Med 1985 13: 818.5.

Intracranial infection related to this technique has been found from 3.5% to 21.9 %. The treatment of catheter related ventriculitis includes change of the catheter and systemic as well as intraventricular antibiotic treatment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the predictive value of standard laboratory examinations for the diagnosis of bactedotogically documented CSF infection. the time of ventriculostomy or because of other indications. Daily CSF samples were obtained and examined for cellcount, total protein concentration, glucose concentration and bacteriological culture. Student t-test and Fisher exact test were performed. Results : The ventricular catheter was in place from 1 to 25 days. 38 Positive CSF bacteriological cultures were found ( the most frequent germs : Staph. epidermid., Staph. aureus). No significant relationship between drainage time and positive CSF culture was found. The only parameter significantly correlated with the result of the bacteriological study was the CSF cell-count (unpaired t-test, p<O.05). Conclusion : Despite a preceding surgical intervention as an influencing factor for CSF pleocytosis the CSF cell-count remains the most valuable parameter of a catheter related infection.",

Results: Glutamate containing AA-infuslons caused a statistically significant rise in plasma glutamate from an initial 51.3 +_ 7.9~ to 86.22 _+ 15.5 ~M 1 hour after commencing TPN with a continuously rising tendency to 98.7_+ 15.3 ~M at 22 hours. Aspa~te increases significantly from 11.2 _+ 1.5 v.M to 19.7 +_ 2.2 p.M followed by a drop to 13.9 +_ 3 p.M at 22 hours. Asparagine showed a rising tendency from 57.8 +_ 7.8 ~ to 83.2 _+ 11.4 #M at 22 hours. Treatment with gtutemate-free infusions revealed a decrease in plasma gtutemate: to 73.0% _+ 8.7% t hour after TPN was started, stabilizing thereafter. Aspartate increased significantly from 12.4 _+ 3.8 p.M to 17.1 _+ 4.1 #M at 22 hours, asparagine, however, decreased significantly from 82.8 _+ 12.1 #M to 59.2 + 13.5 p.M. Glutamine demonstrated a rising tendency among the patients treated with glutamate-centaining solutions but stayed stable within the group fed withoul glutamate. If compared to healthy controls glutamate was increased in bath groups (controls: 49.4 _+ 5.4 ,aM, glutamate-free: 78.9 -6.2 aM, wilh glutamate: 98.7 _+ 15.3 i.tM). Oonolesiofl: Compared to treatment without glutamate, a TPN preparation containing a low dose of glutamate (3.75 g/I) led to an increase in the concentration of plasma glutamate, aspartate and asparagine to nearly 200 % during the first 24 hours of TPN. Plasma glutamate came close or surpassed the threshold of 100 pM, a level claimed to be toxic for cultured neurons, and in particular for neurons in vivo as demonstrated in animal models. Inst.

This prospective study analyses prehospital airway management in trauma patients and their influence on outcome. Methods: Within an 18months time period all trauma patients treated on-scene were included. Intubation rates, complications, 02-saturation in flight and the position of the endotracheai tube by chest x-ray on admission were documented on a check list in addition to the standard flight logs. Survival of these patients was compared with the predicted survival as measured by TRISS (Boyd 1987). Results: 119 trauma patients were intubated on-scene by the helicopter staff. No patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale<9, an AIS Head or Thbrax)3 were transported without prehospital intubation. The overal! complication rate was 20 %, right main stem intubation was documented in 6 cases, no esophageal intubation could be noted. The average Sa02 of 113 transportet patients was 97.3 %.

The incidence seems to be related to both to the duration of administration and the total dose of the NMBD. Although, NMBD are widely used in the ICU, well documented dose recommendations in the critically ill patients are still lacking. The aim of the study was to determine the dose requirements of various aminosteroidal NMBD in the ICU. METHODS: This was a prospective, open clinical study in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with conditions necessitating mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours. Analgesia and sedation was provided by continuous infusion of sufentanyl or fentanyt and midazotam. For muscle relaxation bolus doses of either pancuronium (n=30), vecuronium (n=30) or pipecuronium (n=30) were administered intermittently, Neurornusclar function was monitored around the clock at 30-min intervals with a peripheral nerve stimulator in the train-of-four (TOF) mode, Maintainance doses were not given before the first two responses of the TOF reappeared, RESULTS: 80% of the patients studied were trauma patients with a mean injury severity score of 38,1, 41.6 and 37.3 in the pancuronium-, pipecuronium-and vecurenium-group, respectively. The course of illness was complicated in some patients by failure of one or more organ systems,Table 1. Dose requirements imean \u00b1 SD; rain-max). Dose (mg.h-1) Dose (mg.kg -1 ,h -1) Duration of treatment (h) CONCLUSIONS: Although, the dose requirements may vary considerably between individual patients, the data demonstrate that under adequate analgesia and sedation the dose of NMBD can be \"tailored\" to the individual needs of the ICU patients, however, regular neuromuscular monitoring throughout the treatment is mandatory.

It was our INTENTION to examine the iavivo influence of a defined HES solution with different C's on renal function. METHODS: We investigated 4 groups of each 10 pigs (weight 24 -26 kg) under general anesthesia. After rapid withdrawal of blood in 3 groups (20 ml/kgbw)) and bolus HES (MW:200000 DS:0.5) infusion (25 ml/kg bw) we infused continuously 3 ml/kg bw/h of HES during 6h. Group 1 received HES 3%, group 2 HES 6%, group 3 HES 10% and group 4 was used as control without bleeding or therapy. After 90, 120, and then each 60' up to 360' past hemodilution we destinated creatinine clearance and plasmatic HES levels using Anthron method. We tested the groups at p < 0.05 applying multiple Wilcoxontest. RESULTS:Conclusion: Ezatzept an increased creatinine clearance of group HES 6% at 90' we could not recognize any further influences of different HES plasma concentrations upon creatinine clearance. HES 6 % may be advantageous regarding glomerular function. During total study period renal function in general is not affected by HES 200/0.5 used as colloid solution for hemodilution compared to an untreated control group.Clinic for Anesthesiology, 89075 Ulm, Steinh6velstr. 9, Germany Effect of bicarbonate on the electrocardiogram and arrhythmias in severe amitriptyline poisoning H.-M.

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the influence of postoperative complications on the monocyte activity in patients suffering from cancer of the GI-tract. Eightytwo patients (n= 82) entered into the study and 62 patients have had an uncomplicated post-op follow-up. 20 patients suffered from complications like pneumonia, sepsis syndrome, peritonitis or anastomosis leakage. The monocyte-count and the ability of monocyte cells to express the HLA -DR antigen was determined with the FACScan (Becton-Dickinson). Interferon-y was measured with a modified ELISA assay after PHA stimulation. The tests were performed preoperativly, during the operation and on the postoperative days 1, 3, 7, 10 and 14. Statistical analysis was done by ANOVA and t-test.These data demonstrate tha the HLA-DR antigen expression and the interferon-y levels are decreased after major upper GIsurgery.

Darnas, P, Vanmunster, M. LamyInhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) has been reported to selectively promote pulmonary vasodilation and to improve arteriaI oxygenation in case of adlult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with pulmon~-'y hypertension (PHT) . However the clinical relevance of NO hemodynamic effects remains controversialZ,L We report data of 5 patients with end-stage right ventricular failure (RVF) which dramatically responaea to NO inhalation. Patients & Methods: 5 patients (3F/2M, age 57 + 7, Apache II 20.4 + 1, OSF 1.8 + 0.2) with acute RVF were included in the study. RVF occurred after mitral valve replacement for chronic mitral regurgitation (2 pts), heart transplantation for coronary arterydisease (2 pts) and postpneumonectomy ARDS. Infialed NO (15zu p, pm) was aaministered using a coupIed nebulizer, and chemiluminescence was useo to monitor inspiratory NO and NOX. Treatment was discontinued (5 min) to assess the effectiveness of NO on mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), carLliac output (Qc), fight ventricnlar ejection fraction (RVEF), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and capillary oxygen saturation (Spa2). RVEF was measured using thennodilution techfiique (TI3 and transesophageal echoeardiography (TEE). Data (mean +_ SEM) were analyzed by ANOVA for repeated measures. P<0.05 was considered as sigruficant. P<0.05; t P<0.01; \u00b0P<0.001 Results: Short interruption of NO inhalation resulted in a significant rapid dec re~e (< 3 min) in q~ (-48 %), RVEF, MAP and SpO 2 while PAP and PVR markedly increaseu uaole). Meanwhile, TEE reveme~ severe RVF, with dilated and almost akinetic fight ventricle. Readministration of NO reversed all these changes. In aU patients, attemRts to lower NO concentrations below 15 ppm were unsuccessful until resolution of the underlying disease, Two patients were weaned irum NO using PGE1, while one remained fully dependent and died from untmctable RVFafter more than 20 days of supportive therapy.. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that inhaled NO improves systemic hemodynan?, ics when RVF consequent to PHT is the limiting hemodynamlc factor. future smoies may connrm NO as a tlrst-choice agent for RVF treatment.

GOtl, H. Gornbotz, P. Rehak, J. Berger, H. Metzler Introduction: Stimulating dopamine-1 receptors and thus lowering SVR and improving renal perfusion may be a new approach in treatment of postsurgical hypertension. The goal of our study was to compare the hemedynamic effects of Fenoldopam (F) with those of the Ca channel antagonist Nifedipine (N). Methods: After approval by the Ethics Committee 2 x 31 CABG-patients (61+6yrs, 74_+10kg) with a MAP>110 mmHg at the ICU were studied in a prospective randomised study. Patients with compromised ventricular function, insufficient surgical repair, arrhythmias or an undiagnostic ECG were excluded. The study drugs (initial dosage: F: 0.8pg/kg/min; N: 0,3pg/kg/min) were given continuously to reduce and maintain MAP < 95 mmHg. Using thermodilution technique hemodynamics were determined at TWO WAY ANOVA ~* p.\u00a20,001 MEAN\u00b1SO --FENO ----\" NIFE Conclusions: Both drugs were effective, but the therapeutic goal can be achieved more quickIy with F. The stronger increase of HR and CI may be due to the rapid reduction of SVR after F. Furthermore F may have beneficial effects on renal function. Department of Anesthesiology, University of Graz, Austria Continuous monitoring of cardiocirculatury effects of isolated limb perfusion J.Haier, Th.Moesta, P.Hohenberger, P.Sehlag Isolated limb perfusion using Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is an investgative treatment for soft tissue sarcoma and melanoma. However, hemods, namic complications (septic shock, interleukin production) and cardiocircoJatory effects may occur and result in considerable morbidity and mortality. Systemic and pulmonary, circtdation and cardiac fimction are altered. Thus, invasive Swan Ga~, catheter monitoring is mandatory. We im,estigated a new method for continuous monitoring of eardio-pulmonary function parameters. Seventeen patients underwent ILP (leg n=15, arm n=2) with TNF or melphalan. Due to experiences of cardio-putmonary disfunction, all our patients now receive a continnous invasive cardioplumonary morritoring by a new' technique of thermal dilution (CCO catheter, Baxter, Munich). Perioperatively, and until 48h after the operation, arterial, pulmonary arterial and central venous pressure and cardiac output with corresponding indices were determined continuously. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was measured intraoperatively all 10 minutes and postoperatively ever 3 , hour. Simultaneously arterial and mixed venous blood gas analysis as well as conventional measurement of cardiac output were carried out. Technically, a good correlation between CCO-measurements and the results of conventional thermal dilution technique was demonstraled, however, with a systematic differences of 20%. Due to the continuous nature of the measurement, CCO was far better stilted to recognize acute changes in cardiopulmonary variables and to enable optimization of pharmaceutical intervention. Especialy the relative lack of intraindividttal variability is helpful as wilt be demonstrated in single case analysis. For the evaluation of short time hemodynamic changes we used a continuous monitoring of cardiopulmonary function parameters. The new method is capable of delivering precise results. Validation of the new method will be required in further prospective trials.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of PE/ SPS in internal critical i11 patients with life-threatening diseases. METHODS: 103 plasma exchanges were performed by membrane filtration, the plasma being substituted by human albumin or fresh-frozen-plasma. We treated 39 patients with cascade filtration (membrane filtration combined with immunoadsorber), 12 patients with plasmaperfusion (membrane filtration combined with charcoal adsorber). RESULTS: 52 male and 37 female patients were treated with PE or SPS, the average age was 49,9 years. Indications for PE or SPS were sepsis or SIRS (n=23), life-threatening intoxications (n=23), polyradiculitis or myasthenia (n=19), hyperviscosity syndromes (n=7) and acute pancreatitis or hepatitis (n=17). A significant improvement after PE/SPS was seen in 64 patients (71,9 %) , no improvement in 25 patients (28,1%) . The intoxicated and neurological patients showed the highest improvement (84,2 %, 91,3 % respectively), the septic patients the lowest improvement (52,2 %). Complications related to PE or SPS occured in 7 patients (7,8 %) . CONCLUSION: Therapeutic PE or SPS seems to be justified not only in patients with absolute indications (i.e. polyradiculitis or hyperviscosity snydromes), but also in patients with relative indications like sepsis, SIRS or intoxications -especially when there is no therapeutic alternative.Intensive care unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Leopoldina-Hospital Schweinfurt, Germany We estimated of 229 males with UA bY clinical observation, 8~-h Holier ECG-monitorlng (}~I), two deme~tiorlal echocaPdiography with co~Puter analysis of regiol]al wall motion, bicycle exerslse (IE) test, transesoPhageal stimulation (TF_S), coronary anglograPhy (CAG), invaslve programT~d ventricular stimulation (PVS).

CHOL changes and the relationships with plasma lipid and protein profiles are not simply related to the nutritional state, but reflect more complex interactions; CHOL in critically ill patients may provide useful diagnostic and prognostic information and may be used as a marker of severity of disease. Postoperative intensive care, ventilamry support and anatgo-sedation provide a major contribution to securing the therapeutic success after abdomino-thoracic resection of the esophagus. Since June 1990 an analgo-sedation with clonidin is employed in the post-operative management after esophagus resection. Clonidin dosage is varied according to heart rate. The efficiency of this approach was evaluated by comparing the current.treatment to a historic group of patients without clonidin. Method~: 142 consecutive patients (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) after abdomino-thuracic resection of the esophagus received clonidin (group A), whereas 45 patients (1988) (1989) (1990) were treated without clonidin (group B). Patients in group A were treated with a continuous infusion of clonidin at a rate of 1 to 4 mcg/kg/hr and of fentanyl at a rate of 0.5 to 10 mcg/kg/hr compared to group B with a continuous infusion of fentanyl and midazolam at 0.5 to 6 mcg/kg/l~ and 50 to 500 mcg/kg/hr respectively. All patients in group A were ventilated in pressure-controlled or BIPAP mode, in group B in volume-controlled or also pressure-controlled mode. Target criteria were overall letality, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay on the ICU, cumulative dosage of sedatives and rate of p~flmonary complications. Results: Both groups, though different in size, showed no significant differences in demographic data, surgical procedure and preoperative risk factors. Overall letality was reduced from 36% in group B to 4% in group A, as was the frequency of pulmonary complications from 56% to 12%. Patients in group A could be extubated much earlier (average lime of ventilation 54 hr vs. 96 hr in group B). The LOS on the ICU dropped from 18 days to 6,5 days and daily average dosage of midazolam could be reduced from 200 mg in group B to 0-20 mg in group A. Conclusion: In this investigation the additional application of clonidin for analgosedation and the exclusive use of pressure-controlled ventilation lead to a significant reduction of letality and morbidity after abdomino-thoracic resection of the esophagus. Our experience shows that even in the elderly patient major surgery including two cavity operations is feasible with an overall letality below 5% in a combined approach of optimized surgical technique and a differentiated post-operative intensive care. In the present study, the dynamics of oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) during the rewarming period were evaluated by continuous measured metabolic gas exchange in 30 patients subjected to scheduled major surgery. During the rewarming period (from 35.0 + 0.98 to 37.5 _+ 0.70 \u00b0 C) VO2 increased by 34 + 32 % and VCO2 by 42 + 32 % (both p<0.0001). The majority of the patients (70 %) either showed a gradual increase in VO2 up to a steady state level, with or without a proceeding peak probably as a consequence of shivering. In two of the patients, no steady state phase was achieved while 23 % of the patients showed a blunted rise in VO2. The two last patterns were related to prolonged length of stay in the tCU and increased therapeutic interventions implying postoperative complications (both p<0.05). The length of the rewarming period was increased (p<0.03) and the rise in VO2 was reduced (p<0.03) in the two patients who later expired. The length of the rewarming period was furthermore related to the severity of illness (r=0.47, p<0.03). Conclusion: Different patterns of VO2 and VCO2 during the rewarming period following major surgery was found being related to postoperative complications and to survical.Depts of Medicine, Uppsala and Anaesthsia, G~ivle,Sweden.

He required surgical therapy and mechanical ventilation, complicated by ARDS and multiple organ failure. NondepolmJzing muscle relaxants were used to improve mechauicat ventilatien. Beginning the weaning from the ventilator, the neurological examination showed flaccid quadriplegia and axeflexia; sensation was impaired in all tbur limbs distally. Spinal fluid showed a slightly elevated protein eonconlration. Muscle biopsy and electrophysiohigical cxamimtion wexe performed, consisting with polyneoropathy. Routine laboratory investigations were normal, After 6 months he weaned from the ventilator, sensation ~as normal and motor function was slightly improved.

Since CIP prolongs tl~ time on assisted ventilation, it has ~t impticatkms in the cost of medical care. Cisapride has been reported to enhance postoperative intestinal motility. Since intestinal oxygen supply is often decreased in critically ill patients, we were wondering, if enhancement of intestinal motility may worsen tissue oxygenation in the bowel by increased oxygen demand. Methods: Twenty critically ill patients following open heart surgery were enrolled in the study. They were randomized to receive 4x20ml Cisapride (Cisa-group) or NaC1 0.9% (NaCl-group) via gastric tube. During a study period of 96 hours gastral oxygenation was monitored indirectly by determination of the gastral mucosal pH (phi) via tonometry. Gastric reflux (Refl) was recorded as an index of gastric motility (positive value: output>input, negative value: input>output). Data are means _+ SEM. Results: In both groups phi dropped significantly 96 hrs. after admission to the ICU. A reflux of gastric content was present within the first 72 hours in the NaCl-group, while it occurred only on the first day in the Cisa-group. Postoperative bowel movement started earlier in the Cisa-group than in the NaCl-group. There was no difference between the groups with regard to serum lactate (Lac), hemodynamic parameters, catecholamine therapy, or ventilatory support. Reidemeister lmroduction: After cardiac surgery it is one of the main aims of postoperative intensive care to protect the myocardium and to avoid all hemodynamical changes that may increase oxygen consumption. Besides, it is important to prevent the almost pre-existing heart insufficiency from worsening. Methods: In an open pilot study we assessed the acute hemodynamical effects of intravenous (iv) ACE-Inhibitor (ACE-I) in 10 patients with anamnestic known arterial hypertension after coronary bypass grafting (CBG). Beside an hemodynamical monitoring (Swan-Ganz catheter, invasive arterial blood pressure measurement), we demonstrated the effects in the transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). All patients got 1,25 mg ACE-I iv / 15 min. Sereal recordings were made after each 5 rain for the first 30 min and then every 30 rain for a total of 2 hrs post-dosing. The multiplane 5 MHz-probe of the TEE was intubated and the gastric view was recorded on videotape until the therapeutic effect of the iv ACE-I. Results: A rapid onset of action was observed with changes being evident during the first 8-12 min following drug administration. Under ACE-I the MAP decreased from 126 (+_ 15) to 94 C~ 9) mmHg. RAP, PAP and PCWP decreased on an average of 27%, 1t % and 35%. CI increased on anaverage of 22%, whereas TPR and PVR decreased about 35% respectively 22%. There was no reactive tachycardia noted in any patient. By TEE we could demonstrate an obvious improvement of the global left ventricular (LV) wall motion attended by an increase of the LV-ejection and LV-shortening fraction. Conclusions: Oral ACE-I have an established place in the treatment of arterial hypertension. With Enalaprilhydrogenmaleat is now a good controlable iv ACE-I available for the physiological treatment of the arterial hypertension for avoidance of imminent myocardial ischemia because of increased afterload.

The 19% reduction in blood loss in CABG patients did not affect the frequency of homologous transfusion. To reduce homologous transfusion in this group of patients a higher dose of A will be required.We noted overall a very low frequency of transfusion. ROYAL NORTH SHORE HOSPITAL, SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA. Method: On 4 pigs two pairs of sandwiched st rain gauges were fixed on two small bowel segments in parallel to the longitudinal axis and in circumferential direction. In paravertebral position an amplifier for telemetric signal transmission was implanted subcutaneously. Drugs to be tested were injected intravenously once every two days via a chronic catheter. The motion signals were FFT-processed using commercially available data analysis software run on a personal computer. The signals were thus quantifiedfor comparison between various drugsin terms o! their frequency-power-spectrum.Results: The effect of bolus injections of 12.5 pg/kg Noradrenalin, 62.5 pg/kg Prostigmin, 12.5 pg/kg Fentanyl and 5 mg Atropine on the frequency-power-spectrum were studied. Small single doses of Noradrenalin are able to interrupt mechanical bowel activity for more than 20 minutes.Continuous Noradrenalin administration over several hours keep bowel motion arrested over the whole period of medication.Prostigmin even at very high doses seems notto be a potent stimulator of the unimpaired bowel. Fentanyl definitely depresses bowel motility. High doses of Atropine completely interrupt contractions of the bowel.Conclusion: Long-term measurement of the pig's bowel mechanical activity is a reliable pharmacological model to test any drug which is administered during the perioperative period. Furthermore it may offer new insights into the pathophysiology of the non-occlusive intestinal ischemic disease.University Clinic, Depts. of Heart and General* Surgery, MLinster, Germany Immunological Monitoring of Surgical High-Risk Patients With Immunoglobulin Prophylaxis K. Sehulze, Lj. Verner Patients with esophageal cancer, who undergo an abdomino-thoracal esophagectomy, are especially endangered by pneumonia and septic complications with a lethality up to 40%! Advancing preoperative therapy with cytostatics in these patients leads to a higher rate of pneumonia postoperatively (60%), Therefore, we evaluated whether a prophylactic application of immunoglobulins is able to reduce the incidence of pneumonia and septic complications and whether the determination of immunologic parameters is able to predict the morbidity in ICU. We enclosed 33 patients in our randomized prospective study. Group A received beside the usual application of albumin and fresh frozen plasma 3 ml/kg y-globulin (Intraglobulin\u00ae), group B, 5 ml/kg IgM enriched y-globulin (Pentaglobin\u00ae) for the first 3 postoperative days, whereas patients of group C stayed without y-globulin. In addition we determined perioparativety elastase, crp, endotoxin and antilipid A antibodies. During the stay at our ICU 8 out of 14 patients with chemotherapy developed a pneumonia (57%), while only 6 out of 19 patients without chemotherapy fulfilled all criterias for this diagnosis (32%). For these groups we could show no effect of both immunoglobulins on the incidence of pneumonia. 3 patients died within 28 days, a sepsis occurred in two patients of group C. We found following values on day 1 (1), maximum (2) and before dismission (3) Quantitative and qualitative assessment of intraoperative aspiration and reinfusion of autologous blood with the Solcotrans-Plus was carried out in 11 males (52-79 years) undergoing elective resection of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation parameters and complement activation were studied in the patients blood at the following time points: preoperatively, before and after heparinisation, after retransfusion of the first and last Solcotrans, 6 and 20 hours postoperatively. In addition the same laboratory tests were performed in the first and last Solcotrans unit blood.Results (mean values of 11 patients \u00b1 1 SD): Intraoperatively 2 Solcotrans units were salvaged (total 1'039 +_ 565 ml) of which 805 \u00b1 487 ml were retransfused to the patients. As a mean patients required only 1 unit of homologous RBC's (395 _+ 781 ml) intraoperatively. Patients intraoperative hemoglobin concentration amounted to 10 g/dl or more. Whereas the hemoglobin level in the Solcotrans attained only 8,2 g/dl. Thrombocyte counts 48 \u00b1 18 x 10 9/I) and ionized calcium (0,2 \u00b1 0,4 mmol/I) were significantly depressed when compared to the preoperative patient values (p < 0,05). The protein concentration remained within normal limits in the patients and in the Solcotrans blood. Complement activation (C4a, C5a) showed a significant increase after initiation of surgery but there was no significant difference between the Solco-or patient blood. Whereas plasma free hemoglobin, coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters showed a significant elevation in the Solcotrans blood when compared to the patient's blood (p < o,o5).In conclusion the Solcotrans-Plus offers a fast, efficient and simple method for salvage and retransfusion of intraoperative autologous blood in vascular surgery.Dept. of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Anesthesia, SRK Central Laboratory, University Berne, Switzerland.",

The flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (FFB) is a valuable tool for difficult airway management in anesthesia and critical care areas, As with any other procedure, the potential for failure may be minimized by adequate training. We therefore initiated a structured teaching program which includes fiberoptic nasotracheal (NT) intubation in anesthetized patients and developed a simple technique for continued ventilation. Methods. Forty consenting patients (scheduled for maxillofacial surgery, with obvious pathology suggesting difficult NT intubation) were enrolled in this study. Following 3 rnin preoxygenation, anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, continuous infusion and a supplemental bolus of propofol, and (after assuring ease of mask ventilation) vecumnium. Flexometallic tubes (usually a Mallinckrodi 6.0 and 7,5 mm ID) were inserted through both nares into the naso/oropharynx. A skilled assistant applied a jaw thrust, plugged airway leakages by hand, and continued manual ventilation with oxygen after connecting the smaller tube with the circle system. The FFB (Olympus LF-2, using a video system as teaching aid) was then advanced through the larger tube. FFB intrumcntation was started by one of the trainee residents; if he/she failed to enter and identify the trachea within 5 rain, the supervising instructor completed the intubation. Results. All NT intubations were performed by the residents within the time limit; mean duration of the procedure (from the beginning of tube insertion until midlrachcal positioning of the NT tube) was 185 s (range, 110 to 280). At entry of the FFB into the trachea, the arterial carbon dioxide tension averaged 35.9 mm Hg (range, 28.1 to 44.6) and the arterial oxygen saturation leveled between 98.4 and 99.9 percent. Conclusions. Maintenance of normocapnia and oxygen saturation provided a nou-stressful environment for teaching fiberoptic NT intubation. The unimpeded maneuverability of the FFB was favorable to gain experience and qualification for the next educational step of awake NT/orotracheal intubation techniques. Introduction. In previous studies ~-3, pooled data obtained over prolonged periods of time and/or at varying oxygen demand were used to evaluate the anaerobic threshold of DOll perioperatively. Variations in sedation level or anesthetic depth were not taken into account. This study was designed to determine the critical DO~I under standardized conditions. Methods. With IRB approval, 65 consenting ASA IlI patients scheduled for major vascular surgery were prospectively studied. Measurements of thermodilution cardiac output, arterial and mixed-venous oxygen saturation, hemoglobin, and plasma lactate were performed at 9 defined time points during premedication (stages 1-3), anesthetic induction (4-6), and maintenance of anesthesia (7-9). DO21 and oxygen uptake (VO=I) were calculated from standard formulas. Regression analysis was used to determine the critical DO=I from the inflection point of the DOzI/VOzl regression. Results. DOzl data (ml/min.m=) are shown in the table. Linear DOzI/VO21 relationships with slight slopes (range, 0.08-0.14) and without inflection points were fitting best (P <0.000l) at each separate stage. Plasma lactate remained within the normal range.",

            "text": "Staee 2 The goal of weaning from mechanical ventilation in patients following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is to mantain an optimal oxygenation, haemodynamic stability and reduce at minimum the work of breathing, METHODS : to achieve these goals we used, after 8 hours of CMV, CPAP + FB + PEEP ( 4cmH20 ) in group A (6 patients) ; CPAP+ P.Support (TcmH20) + PEEP (4 cmH20 ), in group B ( 6 pts). All patients were valutated also in T-Tube. During the study the Fit2 was maintained at 40%. An ejection fraction < 40% has been fixed for all. Work of breathing was calculated measuring aesophageal pressure(Pes) and volume, toghether with : respiratory frequency (f), DPes, Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP), Ti / Tot, Ve, via Bicore System. For 20 min. each of the patients were placed or in CPAP+PS or in CPAP+FB in random order and with the same ventilator ; measuring were collected affher 15 rain., for 3 rain. Swan-Ganz catheter for thermodiluition test had been used for computing haemodynamic. Data were collected in a Hewlet-Pakard computering system; means and standard deviation were calculated for each vadable. Analysis of variance was used for comparing means. Probability values less than 0,005 were considered significant. All patients had the same time of CPBP and internal mammary dissection. No preoperative lung diseases were diagnosed. The protocol was approved by the institutional committe for human studies\u2022 RESULTS : both CPAP+FB and CPAP+PS decreased WOBp. significantly, compared with T-Piece ( P< 0,001). All strength values MIP, Pc1 and DPes were reduced with CPAP+FB when compared with those CPAP+PS and T-Tube ( P< 0,002). The endurance was not signifincatly altered dudng the different modes of ventilation. Gas exchange, Fc, and mean BP were similar while PAP, PVC, Pwedge, RVSWl, LVSWl and CI were significantly lower in A group than in B group. CONCLUSION : in our study the flow triggered CPAP causes less imposed work than the pressure triggered CPAP, there is clinical equivalence of the use of CPAP +FB and T-Tube. Probably the less action of the flow on PAW and transpulmonary pressure determine best results in haemodynamic of these patients that are critical and instable during weaning \u2022 All filling parametres were best with the flow ventilation and this seem to indicate that it could be the best mode of ventilation in cardiac patients with high severity score index.",

            "text": "The continous monitoring of blood-flow is of special interest in transplantation surgery. Early diagnosis of detrimental postoperative complications like arterial thrombosis, acute rejection and low perfusion of the graft is not possible with conventio~ll techniques. In this studio a newly developed implantable Doppler ultrasound probe has been tested. An autofocusing ultrasound beam allows to register quick, safe and reproducible signals. The accuracy of the method has been proved with a circulation model. Flow data are absolute numbers, besides parameters of the perioperative monitoring like arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure and heart frequency are put into relation by computer processor. The time for implantation and calibration of the probes was about 10 min. So far no probe related complications have been observed. A vasospasm of thehepatic artery was seen in all patients after liver transplantation with a mean time of 16.06 h (SD.+/-11.81). An increase in blood supply was observed with a mean resistive index (R1) of 0.99 +/-0.31, mean pulsatilly index 0aI) of 2.5 +/-1.85 and mean hepatic blood flow index (HBVI) of 0.46 +/-0.12 on PODI. The mean flow was 4.2 ml/min (SD, +/-0.8) in the A hepatica and 9.8 ml/rain (SD. +/-1.5) in the V.portae. There was a significant increase in blood supply to the liver graft between POD 1 and POD 5. Different vasomotoric type of reaction was observed in either rejection episodes or hepatic failure due to prolonged preservation time.We conclude that graft monitoring with implantable Doppler probes is 8 safe and reliable method after liver transplantation to continously register graft perfusion. Postoperative changes in blood supply can be detected before manifestation in the graft is seen and therapy can be started, Acute renal failure (ARF) is a common problem after heart transplantation (HTx). Regarding this complication we analysed the data of 136 patients who underwent 140 orthotopic Htx between 198g and 1992 at our institution. Immunosuppressive therapy consists of cyclosporin A, azathioprine and prednisolon. In i0 patients acute renal failure occurred within 30 days after HTx (group A). The remaining 126 patients served as controls (group B). The following preoperative risk factors were found: I. More frequently Group A-patients showed renal dysfunction with a serum-creatinin level more than 1.2 mg/dl than patients of group B (70% vs. 52%; p<0.05). 2. More patients with ARF required haemodynamic support by either catecholamines or a mechanical circulatory assistance (80% vs. 50%; p(0.05).",

Giordano.Because of the shortage of organ donors, when a potential donor heart is defined \"functionally inadequate\", it has to be aggressively treated in order to recover it from acute but reversible conditions that could impair its function. Fulminant neurogenic pulmonary oedema [NPE] is a rare but dramatic process in young patients with massive, rapidly fatal brain damage. Moreover, NPE can acutely but reversibly hinder the performance of the heart considered for donation. Case Report. A ten years old girl with no history of cardiopathy, was admitted to our ICU because of deep coma due to massive spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage. The acute huge rise in intracranial pressure ( ICP ) was directly documented by ICP monitoring and indirectly reflected by the absent brain perfusion when angiography was performed. Following several hypertensive episodes [ mean systemic pressure (MBP) = 130 nun Hg ] associated with bradycardia [ heart rate (HR) 80 beat/min ], she became hypotensive (MBP = 60 mm Hg) and tachycardic ( FIR = 170 beat/rain ). Her electroencephalogram was flat and she was considered as a potential organ donor. The echocardiogmphy showed a marked global depression of cardiac function and its left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.20. Central venous pressure rose up from 5 to 18 man Hg, while arterial blood haemoglobin saturation ( SaO2 ) and oxygen partial pressure ( PaO2 ) fall down respectively from 100% to 70% and from 136 to 46 mm Hg, being the patient ventilated with the same air/O2 mixntre with FiO2 = 0.4. The chest X-ray was positive for acute pulmonary oedema and from the trachea it was aspirated abundant blood-tinged frothy fluid. Furosemide 20 mg and dobntamine (DBT) 37 mcg/Kg/min was administered i.v. while FiO2 was rised to 0.8; MBP became 75 mmHg, HR 140 heat/nlin and the urine output rose from 1-2 ml/h to 3-6 ml/h. Twenty' four hours later, SaO2 was 99% and PaOz was 100 mm Hg with FiO~= 0,3 and LVEF improved up to 0.5 with a DBT infusion rate of 18 mcg/Kg/min. The 12 hours procedures for brain death assessment was initiated. The weaning from DBT infusion was carried out and it was terminated before entering the operating room for organ excision. The heart was snccessfully implanted in a seven year old child after an ischemia of 135 minutes; the liver and the kidneys were also successfully implanted.Conclusion. The onset of NPE in brain-dead patients selected for organ donation, has to be considered; however, if promptly and aggressively treated, it does not contraindicates heart donation.Dept, of Anestesia and ICU 2 \u00b0. Ospedale Civile. 33100 UDINE (Italy), Immediate onset donor management after pronouncing brain death prevents loss of donor organs due to circulatory instability I.J. de Jong MD, Kranenburg J, Introduction. Despite an increasing knowledge about the effects of brain death on circulation and metabolism, still donors and donor organs are lost after pronouncing brain death due to circulatory instability, We studied the effects of immediate standardized donor management on organ retrieval, Patients and methods. In the period January 1 till December 31 1993 organ donors were treated with a standardized treatment protocol (STP). Treatment started immediately after pronouncing brain death. Basic steps were: intensive monitoring, rehydration (colloid infusions), infection prevention and specific organ care. As a control group donors harvested during 1991-1992 were taken. Results. 47 donors were treated (STP group) and compalred with the control group (n = 74 The COLD system is an advanced hemodynamic monitoring system, which enaNes not onty measurement of right (COps) and left (COart) ventficutar output, but also of Cardiac Function Index (CFI), Intrathoracic Blood Volume (tTBV), Global Enddiastolic Volume (GEDV), Lung Water (ETV), Excretory Liver Function and Right Ventriculer Ejection Fraction (RVEF). Thus, it could be ideal for monitoring patier~ts (!0ts), which are bridged to transplantation by a left ventricular assist system (LVA8) like the Novacor. Between 2/92 and 1/94 10 pts underwent bridging to transplantation by the Novacor LVAS wearable system. In 4 pts a complete COLD monitoring was performed. Pts suffered from ischemic (l) and dilative cardiomyopathy (3)and were bddged between 4 snd 53 days. The COLD system was used for hemodynamic monitoring during and after implantation of the LVAS asd during and after heart transplantation (HTx). After injection of iced Indocyeninegreen (ICG) dye solution via a pulmonary artery cathether (PAC), the COLD system determines the above mentioned parameters. COpa and COart are measured using thermal dilution method, GEDV and ITBV are calculated by multiplication of COart with the mean transit time of the dye. ETV is determined by calculating the differences of the transit times of the indicators. ICG removal from blood takes place exclusively in the liver, thus the plasma disappearance rate (PDR) of the dye is a sensible marker for the excretory liver function. RVEF is determined using a common PAC, no fast response thermistor cethether is required. COpa and COart did show a significant improvement after LVAS implantation and HTx, as could be expected. Despite partially instable hemodynamic conditions during the perloperative period, estimation of COpe and COart was reliable and showed a good correlation (r=0.96) to calculated mechanical pump output. Measuring ITBV and GEDV enabled better management and control of the volume status, because these parameters are not influenced by intrathoraeic pressure as are central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Direct measurement of ETV proved to be superior to aesesment by lung x-ray, though in this two pts ETV did show an increase only initially after LVAS implantation and HTx. PDR fell shortly after implantation and HTx but did raise to normal values within the first three days. It showed a good correlation to liver blood chemistry, as an further advantage it is bedside available. Measurement of RVEF gives at any time an actual report about the performance of the right ventricle without the need of an expensive fast response PAC. The COLD-System proves to be a reliable monitoring system which offers additional parameters, that are of importance for an exact monitoring of LVAS patients.",

One of the most hazardous complications after liver transplantation is vascular occlusion (10-20%), Early diagnosis and intervention is crucial for graft and patient survival. Duplex-sonography offers the chance for sensitive assessment of liver circulation and morphology with a minimum of risk for the patient. Duplex sonography was routinely performed on 25 liver transplants in 23 consecutive patients (9 male, 14 female) with a mean age of 42 years (range 4-65y). AII patients received a doppler and real-time ultrasound examination of the liver on the intensive care unit within 24 hours after transplantation and subsequently every second day using a transportable doppler unit (toshiba, sonIayer c% 3,5 MHz curved array). Additional examinations were performed if liver function tests took a suspicons course. Routine duplex ultrasound established the diagnosis of hepatic artery thrombosis in 6 of the 25 transplants 4 of which occured within the first 5 days after transplantation. Subsequent arteriograpy confirmed the diagnosis in all 6 cases and revealed the nature of vascular occlusion ( 3 dissections, 2 stenosis, 2 kinkings). Emergency operative revascularization resulted in 84% graft survival, while two patients died after retransplantation and no further therapy respectively. Only in 1 patient duplex-sonography failed to establish a relevant partial stenosis of the hepatic artery ( sensitivity 86%) while no false positive result occured in 123 examinations (specifity 100%). There was no correlation of the resistance index and acute rejection which has been suggested in renal transplantation. Real time examination revealed intrahepatic lesions in 5 cases (1 abcess, 4 hematoma) and 2 bilioma. In conclusion duplex sonography should be performed routinely in the early postoperative period after livertransplantation. This has major implications on therapeutic decisions and may obviate the need tot invasive procedures (biopsy, angiography) in these high risk patients.Dept. of Surgery, University of Heidelberg, Germany The effect of preoperative anticoagulant therapy on perioperative bloodless and changes in the hemostatic system after heart transplantation was examined in a retrospective study including 36 patients, ii patients (group H) received intravenous heparin preoperatively; 12 patients (group P) were transplanted under full phenprosoumon medication; 13 patients with no anticoagulation who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (group C) comprised the control group. In group H, intraoperative use of homologous red blood cells was increased (group H: 463\u00b1280, group P: 200\u00b1321 ml, group C: 46\u00b1i12 ml; p<0.05 vs group C) and 36hours postoperative chest tube drainage was highest (930_+670 ml) as compared to group P (580_+383 ml) and group C (416~286 ml); p<0.05 vs group C. The increase in activated clotting time after heparinization for cardiopulmonary bypass was leas\u00a3 pronounced in group H (461\u00b195 seconds) as compared to all other groups (group P: 1370~229 seconds; group C: 920\u00b1437 seconds); p<0.0025. To counteract the reduced coagulation, patients of group P received more units of platelets (1.5~2.7), frozen fresh plasma (3.8+_1.4; p<0.01), prothrombin complex concentrate (916\u00b1452 I.U.; p<0.05) and vitamin K (8.3+_9.3 ms; p<0.05) postoperatively, than patients in groups P and C. The data indicate, that heart transplantation is feasible under full phenprocoumon therapy without increase of perioperative bleeding complications. In additiont phenprocoumon medication seems to stabilize the hemostatic system perioperatively when compared to longterm preoperative heparin treatment. In this group the reduced heparin response maybe indicative for an increased risk of activation of coagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass.Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, University of Kiel, Germany",

Efficacy of PGEI in heart failure has been demonstrated with increase in cardiac output secondary to combined pre-and afterload reduction. Moreover, in patients requiring i.v. inotropic support, additional PGE1 infusion resulted in further hemodynamie improvement. We evaluated ambulatory PGE1 and / or standard catecholamine infusion in reducing pro-HTX morbidity and mortality.Setting: University hospital, ICU of the eardiologie department. Patients: 30 consecutive HTX candidates (27 mate, 3 female, age 51+12 yrs), LVEF<20%, NYHA IV, refractory to conventional oral or Lv. medication, were studied.Methods: During invasive hemodynamic monitoring, PGE1 was started at 5ng/kg/min and stepwisely increased. Individual dosage (10-20 ng/kg/min) was established at 50% of maximal tolerated dose. Dobutamine and dopamine were given at 5 and 3 pg/kg/min, respectively. In case of positive response to therapy (de, ned as maintained 20 % increase in stroke volume index), impIantatien of a dual lumen hiekman catheter into the internal jugular vein was performed under local anesthesia. Subcutaneous tissue was tunnelled 20 -40 cm to maximize patient comfort and minimize infection rate. Infusates were delivered by battery-driven micropumps fixed at the patient's belt. Patients and relatives were instructed for catheter and micropump handling. Ambulatory controls were performed weekly until clinical stabilisatien, transplantation or death.Results: PGE1 alone was given to 14 (group A), PGE1 + catacholamines to 8 (group B), and catecholamines alone to 8 patients (group C). Within 6 months, 11 patients underwent HTX, 9 patients died. 10 patients are currently on the waiting list, 3 of them weaned from i.v. support. Overall mortality was 30% However, subgroup analysis revealed significant differences in mortality (group A : 21%, group B : 12.5%, group C : 62.5%, p<0.01, chi-square test.) Regarding catheter complications, 1 patient developed ventdcular fibrillation during insertion, in 2 patients the catheter was displaced and had to be exchanged. None of the patients developed severe infectious or thromboembolie complications that would have prevented HTX.Conclusion: Ce~inuous ambulatory PgE1 and/or cateehotamine therapy delivered by a long-term venous access (Hickmen catheter) is a safe and effective way to reduce pro-transplantation morbidity and mortality. Complications related to catheter and micropump handling are rare and minimized by meticulous patient care.Dept. of Cardiology, Internal Medicine II; *Intensive Care Unit, Internal Medicine IV; **Dept. of Nephrology, Internal Medicine III; University of Vienna Morbidity and mortality of renal failure after liver transplantation with ciclosporine Immunosuppression Naumann U, Bechstein WO, Kahl A, Platz K, L0sebrink R and P Neuhaus Background: Renal dysfunction following liver transplantation (OLT) can lead to increased mortality and therefore can be a poor prognostic factor.",

Immunosuppression was a quadruple therapy based on cielosporine, predoisolone and azathioprin with either antithymocyte globulin (ATG, 71 patients) or an intedeukine 2 receptor antibody (BT 563, 33 patients) as a fourth immunosuppressive agent. Results: In the early postoperative period, 52 patients experienced no renal dysfunction with peak creatinine values < 1.4 mg/dl (group 1). Moderate renal dysfunction with peak creatinine values > 1.4 mg/dl but not requiring dialysis occurred in 43 patients (group 2). Nine patients required dialysis because of severe renal failure (group 3). Eddy mortality (4 weeks after OLT) in group 1,2 and 3 was 0%, 2% and 22%. The three goups were compared using univadate analysis. Relative dsks for factors with significant association to renal dysfunction were calculated with the help of Odd's ratio. Ranking of factors significantly associated with moderate renal dysfunction was: preoperatively increased creatinine > 1.4 mg/dl, retransplantation, postoperative hemolysis, preexistent renal disease or relaparotomy because of hemorrhage. Ranking of factors significantly associated with the need for postoperative dialysis was: antiinfective therapy with amphotedcin B and vancomycin, urinary tract infections, hemolysis, retransplantation or relaparotomy for hemorrhage, Conclusion: Patients with preexisting renal disease and/or with creatinine values > 1,4 mg/dl before OLT require special attention to perioperative renal function. To prevent early postoperative renal dysfunction an adequate infection prophylaxis, careful surgical technique to avoid postoperative hemorrhage and retaparotomies and the maintainence of a good postoperative liver function avoiding graft rejections and therefore prevention of retransplantations seem to be more important than other possible risk factors.

On day 32 post transplant, he experienced shock, renal insufficiency, hepatic failure with lactic acidosis : pH : 7,I0, lactate : 11, LDH, 13000, White blood cells was 57.109/L, with 60% of plasmocytoi'd cells. Liver biopsy revealed polyclonal lymphoplasmocyto~d proliferation. CsA and steroids were decreased. One month later the patient had no evidence of active disease. In these 3 cases PCR for EBV genome detection was positive in liver and blood starting with 103 PBL cells extracted DNA, suggesting that the lymphoproliferative disorders were EBV induced. The three patients received standard immunosupprcssive regimen and OKT3 before the occurence of PTLD. In all of them shock with hepatic failure and lactic acidosis were the predominant symptoms Conclusion : after solid organ transplantation EBV post transplantation lymphoproliforative disease with liver impairment may be a cause of shock, fulminant hepatic failure and lactic acidosis.Medical intensive care and transplantation uuits of CHRU -RENNES -FRANCE.

The initial postoperative immunosuppression including an IL2 receptor antibody, CsA, azathioprtae and methylpredinsolone was started immediately after OLT. The postoperative recovery of the patient was excellent. 24 days after OLT the patient developed fever, pancytepenia and was treated for CMVAnfeetinn (APAAP-positive) with foscanmt following ganeielovir. On post operative day (POD) 32 an erythematous macule-papular rash at the palms,the soles and the back developed. A drug induced toxic epidermal r~ulysis was suspected and treated with plasanepharesis for three days. Acute renal failure and respiratory insat~tc~iency oeeused while liver fimetian was not imparted. A skin biopsy at that time showed an epidermal nesrolycis so that Stevens-Johnson Syn&om or drug induced toxic epidermal necrolysis were suspected. Oit POD 42 HLA-typing of eireulatmg lympliecytes presented donor HLA pbenotype exclusively and GVHD was established as working diagnosis. Therapy with AT(} was started with a leucocyte count of 0.2 x 109 / L, and a platelet count of 11 x t09/1. Under therapie with ATG the liver tlmetion detotiaWal but the clinical status did not improve. Following administration of OKT3 on POD 48 a reduction of activated CD3 lymphocytes from 90 to 60 % could be achieved. However 80 % of the lymphoeytes were CD8+ and still donor origin. Due to the low platelets carrot untractabte bleeding from intestine and lungs ocenred and the patient died of intracerebral hemorrhage on POD 52.Conclusion: Even after thorough cold perthsiun at the time of organ procurement a large number of mononaclear cells may rest m the paranchyma of liver graft. These coils, from which the ]ymphocytes have been hypothesized to be mostly CD3/CDS, harbour the devetopemeut of GVH reaction, smca a full)\" daveloped GVHD is rare after OLT and the similarity of the cliinc~ findings to ~qral or drug induced pathologies is l'dgh, diagnosis is often made late in the causs\u00a2 of the disease. Fusthennore, therapeutic measures for GVHD are scarce and diagnosis has to be established as early as possible~ hence pretransplant prcourement of donor and recipient monoanclear cells for fonowing later studies should be considered to decrease the time period between clinical suspicion and diagnosis.Chimrgische Kl/mk nnd Polikliink (#), Kltaik for An,a.,ahesiologte (*), ln~dtut fitr Pathologie (+), Klini.kaun Rudolf Virehow dor FU, Augustenborger Platz l o 13353 Bertin, Crerrnany",
