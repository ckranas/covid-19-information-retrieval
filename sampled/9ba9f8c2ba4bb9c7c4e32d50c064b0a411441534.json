All patients with severe pneumonia who are treated in an ICU will receive therapy that consists of a combination of multiple different treatments. For many of these treatments, different options are available currently. For example, several antibiotics exist that are active against the microorganisms that cause pneumonia commonly but it is not known if one antibiotic strategy is best or whether all suitable antibiotic strategies have similar levels of effectiveness. Of all the treatments that clinicians use for patients with severe CAP, only a small minority have been tested in randomized controlled trials to determine their comparative effectiveness. As a consequence, the standard treatments that are administered vary between and within countries. Current conventional clinical trials methods to assess the efficacy of treatments for pneumonia generally compare two treatment options (either two options for the same treatment modality, where both are in common use; or a new treatment against no treatment or placebo where the effectiveness of the new treatment is not known). Using this approach, in a series of separate and sequential trials, it will take an inordinate length of time to study all the treatment options. Additionally, with conventional trial designs it is not possible to evaluate interactions between treatment options.",

Bayesian statistical methods will be used to establish the superiority, inferiority, or equivalence of interventions within a domain. Interventions determined to be superior will be incorporated into standard care within the ongoing REMAP. Interventions determined to be inferior will be discontinued. While a limited number of initial treatments and treatment domains have been specified at initiation, it is planned that this REMAP will continue to evaluate other treatments in the future. Furthermore, in the event of a future epidemic of a novel or re-emerging respiratory pathogen (which typically present as severe CAP), this REMAP would be adapted to evaluate the most relevant treatment options.

Although treatments will be allocated randomly, patients will preferentially be allocated to treatments that statistical models derived from trial data indicate are more likely to be the most effective treatments. The trial will \"adapt\" in multiple ways including answering questions as soon as sufficient data have accrued E19 to answer the question of the effectiveness of each treatment and by changing the treatments that are being tested over-time so as to progressively determine the best package of treatments for predefined categories of patients with severe pneumonia. Once a treatment is identified as being optimal it is subsequently routinely provided to all eligible patients within the REMAP.

Throughout the remainder of this protocol, we will use the term ICU for units that provide specialized care for critically ill patients, including HDU, Critical Care Units, and Intensive Treatment Units.

It is recommended that antimicrobial treatment be initiated promptly and at the point of care where the diagnosis of pneumonia is first made. Examples of commonly used therapies that support failed organ systems or prevent the complications of critical illness and its treatment include oxygen therapy, invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation, intravenous fluid resuscitation, vasoactive drugs, dialysis, provision of nutrition, sedation, physiotherapy including mobilization, diuretic medications, suppression of gastric acid production, and mechanical or pharmacological interventions to prevent venous thromboembolism. The exact combination of supportive therapies is influenced by the spectrum of organ failures that occurs in any individual patient. (Eccles et al., 2014 , Wiersinga et al., 2012 , Wilkinson and Woodhead, 2004 , Woodhead et al., 2011 These guidelines generally focus on recommendations related to assessment of severity, diagnostic evaluation, and empiric and guided antimicrobial therapy. Guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign are relevant to many aspects of the supportive care of the critically ill patients with CAP. There is a stark contrast between the substantial public health impact of severe CAP and the low quality of evidence that guides therapy. The number of treatment recommendations in guidelines that are supported by high quality randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence is 4 of 44 for treatment recommendations in the European guidelines (Eccles et al., 2014 , Woodhead et al., 2011 , 11 of 43 in the United States guidelines , and 7 of 93 in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines. (Rhodes et al., 2017) As a consequence of the limited evidence-base there are a number of inconsistencies and even complete contradictions among international guidelines.",

This necessitates adaptation of empiric treatment protocols or diagnostic procedures or both. Naturally, there will be no evidence base for the medical management of such a disease at the time of its emergence, and medical decisions will be mostly based on expert opinion with extrapolation from evidence derived from the treatment of analogous clinical syndromes. There is substantial unmet need to generate evidence about the most effective treatment approaches during a pandemic or regional outbreak.",

(Angus, 2015) A REMAP provides a strategy to address many of these problems by gaining economies of scale from a common platform, which allows for broad enrollment but retaining the ability to examine for heterogeneity of treatment effects between defined subgroups. A REMAP focuses predominantly on the evaluation of treatment options for the disease of interest that are variations within the spectrum of standard care (although testing of novel or experimental therapies is not precluded) and does so by embedding the trial within routine healthcare delivery. In this regard the REMAP seeks to replace random variation in treatment with randomized variation in treatment allowing causal inference to be generated about the comparative effectiveness of different existing treatment options. The use of RAR, which allows the allocation ratios to change over time based on accruing outcomes data, maximizes the chance of good outcomes for trial participants. The embedding of such a platform within the day-to-day activities of ICUs facilitates the translation of outcomes to clinical practice as a \"self-learning\"",

The broad objective of a REMAP is, over time, to determine and continuously update the optimal set of treatments for the disease of interest. The set of treatments that may be tested within a REMAP comprise the set of all treatments that are used currently or may be developed in the future and used or considered for use in the disease of interest. The design maximizes the efficiency with which available sample size is applied to evaluate treatment options as rapidly as possible. A REMAP has the capacity to identify differential treatment effects in defined sub-groups (termed strata), address multiple questions simultaneously, and can evaluate interactions among selected treatment options. Throughout the platform, patients who are enrolled in the trial are treated as effectively as possible. (Angus, 2015 , Berry et al., 2015 , Carey and Winer, 2016 , Harrington and Parmigiani, 2016 , Park et al., 2016 , Rugo et al., 2016 A conventional RCT (i.e. a non-platform trial) makes a wide range of assumptions at the time of design. These assumptions include the plausible size of the treatment effect, the incidence of the primary outcome, the planned sample size, the (typically, small number of) treatments to be tested, and that treatment effects are not influenced by concomitant treatment options. These assumptions are held constant until the trial completes recruitment and is analyzed. (Barker et al., 2009 , Berry, E32 2012 , Connor et al., 2013 Participants who are enrolled in a conventional RCT are not able to benefit from knowledge accrued by the trial because no results are made available until the trial completes. A REMAP uses five approaches to minimize the impact of assumptions on trial efficiency and also maximizes the benefit of participation for individuals who are enrolled in the trial.

(Institute of Medicine, 2013) Assuming at least some interventions are better than others, the total mortality within the trial population will be lower than would have occurred with a fixed randomization proportion. It is also particularly relevant to the ethical conduct of trials that enroll critically ill patients where unanticipated increases in mortality have been seen and to the conduct of trials during a pandemic in which there is in-built implementation of the therapies that are more likely to be beneficial during the trial. The simulations underpinning REMAP-CAP demonstrate that, in instances where particular interventions are indeed superior to others, the use of RAR will, on average, increase the odds of discovering the superiority not only with lower sample size, but with fewer participants exposed to the less efficacious therapies and, thus, fewer deaths.",

One disadvantage is that, for interventions that are provided without blinding, the treating clinicians may be able to draw inference about the RAR proportions and, as a consequence, draw inference about the interim standing of interventions that are being tested in the REMAP. This could have adverse consequences including that clinicians are influenced to not enroll participants within a domain but rather directly prescribe the treatment that E34 they believe to be doing better outside the trial. However, a number of factors mitigate this potential concern. First, it can be difficult to distinguish between patterns of sequential allocation status that are derived from fixed versus RAR. Second, extreme proportions will not be used (except where a Statistical Trigger but not a Platform Conclusion has been reached, see later). Finally, for many conditions, team-based management means that an individual clinician will directly observe only a small proportion of all participants enrolled within the trial at each participating site. Another disadvantage of RAR is that, under certain allocation rules, statistical power can be reduced. This concern is mitigated via pre-trial simulation to test the effects of different allocation rules.",

Frequent adaptive analyses will be performed to determine if an intervention is superior, inferior, or equivalent to one or more other interventions to which it is being compared, within a domain. A Bayesian analysis method will be used to evaluate superiority, inferiority, or equivalence, as well as to inform the adaptive randomization strategy within each domain. Where it is anticipated that interactions between interventions in different domains may be likely the statistical models will allow evaluation of such interactions. Where the statistical models evaluate such an interaction the models can incorporate the relative likelihood of such interactions, but with possibly low prior probability in cases where it is biologically implausible for interactions to occur. Each intervention within each domain will be evaluated within prospectively defined and mutually exclusive strata (sub-groups) of participants but information from one stratum may be used (via 'borrowing') to contribute to the analysis of the effect of that intervention in other strata. Interventions that are found to be inferior, for a specific stratum, are removed from use in that stratum, and will, typically, be removed from the REMAP allowing new interventions or domains or both to be introduced. An RAR algorithm will be used to preferentially randomize participants to interventions that appear to be performing better. Extensive simulation studies have been performed to define the type I error, power to detect specified differences, and demonstration of equivalence as well as a broad range of operating characteristics. It is planned that further simulation studies will be conducted in conjunction with consideration of the introduction of new interventions or domains or both into the REMAP.

Thus, it requires specific sample sizes, which in turn requires pre-experiment assumptions regarding plausible effect sizes and outcome rates. Although many clinicians are comfortable with this approach, the pre-trial assumptions are frequently incorrect, and the design lacks the flexibility either to easily address the complex questions more reflective of clinical practice or to make mid-trial corrections when the pretrial assumptions are wrong without concern that the integrity of the final analysis is violated.

It has been suggested that fluoroquinolone treatment may be optimal for pneumonia due to Legionella spp, but randomized clinical trial data are lacking. (Asadi et al., 2012) A summary of different recommendations in guidelines for the treatment of severe CAP is displayed in Table 2 . Clinical trials that tested the addition of a macrolide to beta-lactams have not demonstrated clinical benefit. One trial found a shorter time to clinical stability in patients with severe pneumonia although the difference in this small trial was not statistically significant. Additionally, there were no differences in other groups or outcomes including length of stay or mortality. A recent cluster randomized trial of beta-lactam monotherapy, beta-lactam and macrolide combination therapy, or fluoroquinolone monotherapy in patients with moderate severity CAP (who were not admitted to ICU at the time of randomization) did not find any differences in mortality or hospital length of stay associated with any strategy. A systematic review of antibiotic treatments recommended in the IDSA/ATS guideline did not find any conclusive evidence that \"atypical\" coverage was associated with better outcomes in clinical trials, although an association with better outcome was found for treatments that included macrolides or quinolones in lower quality observational studies. (Lee et al., 2016) Most of these studies were performed in hospitalized patients with CAP in whom mortality was relatively low and statistical power limited. Although the available evidence suggests that patients with moderate or severe pneumonia may benefit from atypical coverage, the choice of beta-lactam and whether atypical coverage should include a macrolide (in combination with beta-lactam) or a quinolone (as monotherapy) in severe CAP remains an open question.",

The majority of patients receive ceftriaxone, as recommended in Australian guidelines, but one third of ICU specialists use piperacillin-tazobactam (unpublished data from the REMAP-CAP investigators). Although piperacillin-tazobactam has wider microbiological coverage, it penetrates less well into lung tissue, is less potent against pneumococci (the commonest cause of severe CAP), and is predicted to impose increased selection for resistant organisms. (Sime et al., 2012) In New Zealand, IV amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefuroxime (both not available in Australia as IV formulations currently) are also used widely. A 2013 study found that both second/third generation cephalosporins (58%) and co-amoxiclav (36%) were used in patients with severe pneumonia defined by CURB-65 score. Studies suggest a wide diversity of antibiotic regimens are used for pneumonia in Europe; the most common antibiotics used included penicillin/beta lactamase inhibitors, macrolides, quinolones and third generation cephalosporins, broad spectrum penicillins and second generation cephalosporins 6.2.4.

Studies suggest a wide diversity of antibiotic regimens are used for pneumonia in Europe; the most common antibiotics used include penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitors, macrolides, quinolones and third generation cephalosporins, broad spectrum penicillins and second generation cephalosporins but there is little information available about the duration of macrolide therapy when macrolides are used. As such, all patients with severe CAP, both in usual practice or within this REMAP, will receive either a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. If a macrolide is included in the choice of empiric antibiotics it is typically continued if an 'atypical' cause of pneumonia is identified. The time interval for the results of microbiological tests to become available varies between sites, but at the vast majority of sites results for tests of Legionella and other atypical organisms are available before day 3 to 5. It is usual practice is to continue a macrolide antibiotic, until the results of such tests are available and to then cease the macrolide unless 'atypical' pneumonia is confirmed or strongly suspected.",

Interestingly, a more pronounced and aggressive inflammatory response has been shown in several studies to be associated with treatment failure and increased rates of mortality. In support of this hypothesis that an over-active immune response is deleterious, higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (i.e. IL-6 and IL-8) have been detected in patients with severe CAP and associated with increased rates of mortality. It has been postulated that a potential dampening of this 'abnormal' immune response to infection could improve outcomes. The immunomodulatory properties of macrolide antibiotics provide a rationale E186 for why an extended course may be superior to usual practice, in patients who do not have a microbiological reason (i.e. identification of an 'atypical' organism) to continue the macrolide. High profile reviews have identified the role of extended administration of azithromycin in patients with CAP as a high priority research question. (Dellinger et al., 2013, Wilkinson and Woodhead, 2004) 6.2.4. Macrolides have been associated with improved clinical outcomes in inflammatory lung diseases in some studies Additional supportive evidence of the potentially beneficial effects of macrolides, that are believed to be mediated by their immunomodulatory properties, comes from trials of macrolides in patients with various forms of chronic inflammatory lung disease. Clinical evidence for an anti-inflammatory effect of macrolides was first noted in patients with diffuse panbronchiolitis, a rare disease found exclusively in Japan. (Schultz, 2004) In Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), long term azithromycin has been resulted in improved outcomes in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (Albert et al., 2011 , Uzun et al., 2014 , non-cystic fibrosis associated bronchiectasis (Altenburg et al., 2013 , Valery et al., 2013 , and to prevent or treat bronchiolitis obliterans or chronic rejection in patients who have undergone lung transplantation. (Corris et al., 2015 , Vos et al., 2011 . 6.2.5. The use of macrolide antibiotics has been associated with improved outcomes in CAP even when the causative organism is resistant to macrolides.",

The HPA axis is central to maintaining homeostasis in the face of exogenous stress. Infectious disease is a common source of exogenous stress that is encountered by humans. As part of an integrated response to infection the host produces additional (above normal homeostasis) corticosteroids. It is speculated that this occurs to calibrate the innate and acquired host response to infection so as to protect the host organism from an excessive immune response, which can damage host tissues. Corticosteroids are immunomodulatory hormones that can stimulate, as well as suppress, immune function depending on the type of immune response, the immune compartment, E209 and the cell type involved. (Silverman et al., 2005 , Prina et al., 2016 Exogenously administered corticosteroid drugs (e.g. hydrocortisone) elucidate effects similar to endogenously produced cortisol on the host immune response. Furthermore, critically ill patients may benefit from corticosteroid administration due to the presence of relative adrenal insufficiency or inadequate adrenal function in some cases of severe CAP.

This recommendation is graded as a weak recommendation based on low quality evidence. There are two major trials that influenced this recommendation. In a study by Annane et al, hydrocortisone improved the duration of survival (within the first 28 days) but not the number of patients who survived; and resulted in more rapid reversal of septic shock in the (non-stratified) sub-group of patients with relative adrenal insufficiency. (Annane et al., 2002) In the CORTICUS study, septic shock was also reversed more rapidly but there was no difference in mortality although this result may have been influenced by inclusion of patients at lower risk of death. (Sprung et al., 2008) A more recent Cochrane metaanalysis suggests that corticosteroid treatment reduces mortality among patients with sepsis, but the quality of evidence was rated as low because of imprecision and inconsistency of results across trials, as well as the inclusion of trials with different study populations and the use of different doses E210 and duration of treatment.

These studies have been reviewed by Prina and colleagues (2016) , and are summarized in Table 2 (modified from Prina et al, 2016) . A 2011 Cochrane meta-analysis by Chen et al. (6 RCTs, n=437) suggested that corticosteroid therapy increased the speed of resolution of symptoms and shortened the time-interval to achieve clinical stability but did not demonstrate any effect to reduce mortality. (Chen et al., 2011) A more recent meta-analysis by Nie et al. (9 RCTs, n=1001) showed that administration of corticosteroids did not result in a demonstrable decrease in mortality, across all studies, but a beneficial effect on mortality may be present among the sub-group of patients with severe CAP when patients received more than 5 days of corticosteroid treatment. interventions (low to very high dose of steroids). Another meta-analysis by Cheng et al. (4 RCTs, n=264) , which included only patients with severe CAP concluded that, although corticosteroid therapy may reduce mortality for adult patients with severe CAP, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the instability of the pooled estimates. (Cheng et al., 2014) The authors concluded that reliable treatment recommendations could only be produced if additional multicenter studies with sufficient statistical power were conducted. (Cheng et al., 2014) Two recent relatively large high quality multicenter RCTs have been published regarding the use of corticosteroids in CAP that were not included in the meta-analyses of patients with CAP.

The trial reported that corticosteroids reduced the time to reach clinical stability and that hyperglycemia was more common in the corticosteroid group but that the mortality rate was not different between the two groups. (Blum et al., 2015) In the second study, by Torres et al, 2015, a multicenter severe CAP RCT (n=120), participants were randomized to receive either corticosteroids (methylprednisolone at a dose of 0.5mg/kilogram (kg) every 12 hours for 5 days) or not. Treatment with corticosteroids reduced treatment failure in comparison with the placebo group, but not hospital mortality. (Torres et al., 2015) As highlighted in Table 2 , the aggregate conclusion from these studies is that there is reasonable evidence to indicate that use of corticosteroids in CAP may result in the following benefits: reduced hospital length of stay (LOS), reduced time to clinical stability, and prevention of ARDS. However, none of these are patient-centered end-points and, as yet, there is no definitive answer regarding the effect of corticosteroids on mortality. This, combined with the huge heterogeneity in current clinical practice indicating clinical equipoise exists, makes now the time to conduct such a large adequately powered study examining patient centered outcomes.

Existing evidence is derived predominantly from observational studies. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, among patients admitted to an ICU, approximately one third of patients received corticosteroids (Falagas et al., 2010) as either a primary therapy or as a rescue therapy for patients with severe ARDS. (Kumar et al., 2009 , Dominguez-Cherit et al., 2009 This widespread use occurred despite the absence of any evidence from RCTs regarding the effectiveness of corticosteroids in CAP secondary to influenza. A systematic E214 review and meta-analysis (nine cohort studies, n = 1405, and 14 case-control studies, n = 4700) and a recent secondary analysis of a Spanish cohort study, using propensity matching, showed increased mortality with corticosteroid treatment in influenza H1N1 infection. (Zhang et al., 2015 , Moreno et al., 2018 However, it is likely that severity of illness will be a confounding factor in these studies and commonly, in studies enrolling patients who are critically ill, adjustment of confounding may be inadequate. As such, the role of corticosteroids in patients with severe CAP secondary to influenza remains uncertain and both beneficial or harmful effects are possible.",

Several studies have evaluated the effects of corticosteroids in patients with ARDS including patients with severe CAP. Meduri and colleagues conducted a small (n=24) double blind placebo controlled RCT where patients with severe ARDS who failed to improve by day 7 of respiratory failure were randomized to receive methylprednisolone versus placebo. (Meduri et al., 1998) This study demonstrated that corticosteroid treatment reduced ICU mortality, improved oxygenation and reduced the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS). (Meduri et al., 1998) , The sample size of this study was small and it is also important to note that there were marked differences in baseline characteristics between groups. (Meduri et al., 1998) A subsequent Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Clinical Trial Network (ARDSNet) study randomized (n=180) patients with late ARDS (day 7 to 28) to receive methylprednisolone or placebo. This study demonstrated no difference in 60-day mortality but an increased death rate in those commenced on steroids after 2 weeks. (Steinberg et al., 2006) There was no increase in nosocomial infections but a trend towards increased neuromyopathy and an increased number of ventilator-free days (VFDs), ICU-free days and shock-free days in the first 28 days after treatment. (Steinberg et al., 2006) . A recent single center randomized controlled trial (n=197) study of severe sepsis induced ARDS demonstrated that patients randomized to receive hydrocortisone (50mg, IV 6hourly) was associated with significantly improved pulmonary physiology (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood and fraction of inspired oxygen concentration ratio (P:F ratio), lung injury score) but had no survival benefit.

Introduction The conceptual approach to pandemic preparedness has been influenced substantially by the occurrence of the 2009 Influenza A H1N1(2009)pdm pandemic, outbreaks of SARS and MERS-CoV, the Zika pandemic, and Ebola virus disease outbreaks in West Africa 8 . A broad conclusion from these outbreaks is that it is likely that high quality research can change the incidence and consequences of the epidemic but that such research is extremely difficult because planning of research only commences after the discovery of the epidemic. As a consequence, researchers and organizations interested in developing improved processes for research have identified three key elements to facilitate time-critical research about an epidemic. These elements are that the research must be pre-planned, pre-approved, and practiced 9, 10 . REMAP-CAP and, in particular, the PAtC, is an attempt to establish these pre-requisites and to guide treatment for patients who may be critically ill with pneumonia as a consequence of infection with a pandemic organism.",

Although basic eligibility screening data is available for the reporting of patient flow consistent with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, it is important to understand some wider characteristics of excluded patients who have the disease of interest. This facilitates other aspects of general trial management and interpretation such as the generalizability of results, the identification of selection bias and to provide feedback to sites. For this REMAP, this additional observational data also assists in the refinement of the platform and its existing domains, and in the development of further domains. Furthermore, in combination with the data from participants assigned treatment within the domains, a full descriptive analysis of the entire population of patients receiving treatment in an ICU for CAP can be undertaken. Finally, as patients who are assigned to interventions within domains have individual follow-up to a maximum of 180 days, this additional data will facilitate the evaluation of the effect of allocation status on long-term outcomes.",

            "text": "design is built as a process -with the possibility of multiple interventions within multiple domains and multiple patient groups being investigated. The trial design is built prospectively to be flexible. These flexible aspects are designed and planned and are part of the protocol. In this report, we describe the details of the prospective statistical design. In contrast to many clinical trial designs, where there is a single intervention or a small number of interventions, this REMAP is designed generically so that it may incorporate a flexible number of interventions, with the possibility of these numbers evolving as the science evolves. This statistical analysis plan describes the statistical design in the most general way possible, and thus applies for all imaginable trial design states. The current trial design state is described a separate document, Current Statistical Modeling.Similar interventions are grouped within domains. Each patient is randomized to a single intervention from each domain. This set of randomized interventions across the domains is the patient's regimen. Patients are also grouped into strata and into disease states. The efficacy of the interventions may vary by strata. Optimal interventions will be identified by strata. Some interventions may only be administered to patients in certain disease states. The specific domains, interventions, strata, and states being investigated in REMAP are allowed to evolve throughout the perpetual nature of this trial. These evolutionary aspects are described. The adaptations in the design are controlled by a statistical model. This statistical model is described in the section entitled \"Statistical Modeling\" (Section 5). The modeling can expand and contract to accommodate the E100 number of domains, interventions, strata, and states being evaluated at any time. The section entitled \"Trial adaptation and stopping criteria and guidelines for interventions\" (Section 9) describes the adaptations in this REMAP. These include the timing of adaptive analyses, the Response Adaptive Randomization (RAR), and the requirements for declaration of superiority, inferiority, or equivalence of interventions. A separate document, The Current Statistical Modeling document, describes the current domains, interventions, strata, states and specifies the current statistical modeling. Another separate document, the Simulations Appendix, presents a range of simulation-based operating characteristics based on the current state of the trial. This includes simulating from various assumptions of treatment effects and observing the behavior of the trial design: for example, the number of patients assigned to each intervention and the probability of declaring interventions superior, inferior, or equivalent by strata.",

This differs from conventional (frequentist) analysis methods where inferences are based on a likelihood of observed outcomes against a null hypothesis. The statistical model takes into account the variation in outcomes by region, strata, disease states, age group, and time since the start of the trial. The model estimates treatment effects for each intervention as well as determines if these treatment effects vary by strata and if treatment effects of individual interventions in one domain vary when paired with interventions from other domains.

Part of the justification for its use, in the absence of a mortality benefit in outpatient studies of early oseltamivir treatment of uncomplicated influenza that were not powered for assessing impact upon survival, is in reducing viral transmission duration(Fry et al., 2015), reducing the frequency of complications(Venkatesan et al., 2017), and decreasing hospital resource requirements.(Muthuri et al., 2014) These benefits have mostly accrued to individuals who are treated early in their course, with effect sizes decreasing with delays in initiating therapy.Given its decades of widespread use, oseltamivir has a fairly well-known safety profile, with rates of nausea and vomiting in approximately 3-4% of patients, with possible increases in neuropsychiatric adverse events in some reports that are difficult to causally attribute.(Dobson et al., 2015, Heneghan et al., 2016, Jefferson et al., 2014 In the critically ill, its enteral formulation is generally well tolerated and well-absorbed, although randomized, placebo-controlled data in this population are lacking.(Lytras et al.,  2019) E160 Current guidelines vary in their recommendations for the use of oseltamivir in the severely ill patient with influenza. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend neuraminidase treatment for any patient hospitalized with influenza, regardless of illness duration prior to hospitalization (A-II). (Uyeki et al., 2019) European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC) expert opinion documents state 'Treatment during seasonal influenza epidemics should be recommended on an individual basis', acknowledging limitations in the available evidence base. (2017) Duration of therapy is additionally unclear, with a C-III recommendation from the IDSA for longer durations (beyond 5 days) of antiviral treatment for patients with severe disease. (Uyeki et al., 2019)Detection of antiviral efficacy is through both clinical and biologic endpoints. Determining a benefit on viral shedding after treatment is an important public health endpoint, with the hope that this leads to a decrease in transmissibility during outbreaks, both in the community and hospital settings.The impact on individual outcomes of duration of influenza viral shedding during treatment is unknown.(Ison et al., 2010) Ongoing surveillance for emergence of antiviral resistant influenza viruses due to treatment, as well as in circulating influenza viral strains and their impact on antiviral efficacy,",

The declaration of a Platform Conclusion will lead to appropriate modificationIn a clinical trial there are many different potential participant-level covariates. A covariate can be a demographic variable that remains unchanged throughout the trial (i.e. age or gender) or a variable representing the severity or course of the disease that can vary over time (i.e. it can be assessed at the time of enrollment and at other times after enrollment during the course of the illness). In this REMAP, there are two special roles for a subset of these potentially time-varying covariates.First, covariates determined at the time of enrollment that are identified in the design as possibly having differential treatment effect (i.e. interventions may have differential efficacy for the different levels of the covariate) are referred to as strata. Strata are used to define the unit-of-analysis for a domain within a model. Strata are a recognized element in Platform Trials.Second, within this REMAP, there is interest in studying domains that are relevant for a target population or defined disease state that, while it may be present at the time of enrollment for some participants, may only occur after enrollment for other participants and may never occur for another set of participants. This disease state could be identified by the same covariate that might also have been used to define a strata (but doesn't have to have been). In this regard, the concept of 'state' is used to define participants with characteristics that define a target population that will be evaluated by a domain, analyzed within the REMAP, and for which the characteristics can be present at the time of enrollment or may develop after the time of enrollment. State can also be used to define the unit-of-analysis for a domain within the model.The appropriate statistical handling of the analysis of patients who become eligible for a domain as a consequence of entering a state, after the time of enrollment, requires the use of models that take into account that the likelihood of entering the state after enrollment may have been influenced by E55 the allocation status for other domains that specified the initiation of interventions that commenced at the time prior to entry into the state.This evolution of Platform Trial design, to include 'state' is a new extension that has not been considered within Platform Trials conducted previously.",

Data submitted to the CMP Database includes information related to dates and times of ICU admission(s), admission diagnoses, physiological and treatment data from the first 24 hours of ICU admission used to calculate severity of illness scores, provision of organ support, survival status at hospital discharge, and, for survivors, discharge destination (corresponding to the data outlined in section 8.4.2). Patients meeting the entry criteria specified in this Appendix will be linked to the CMP Database record for the same patient by the submission to the REMAP-CAP database of the 'CMP ADNO' with linkage supplemented, where appropriate, by additional variables such as hospital and critical care admission dates and times. Patient's NHS number will be obtained from the CMP Database to facilitate identification of further admissions to a participating critical care unit and record linkage to other databases. 16.1.3. NHS Digital and NHS Wales Informatics Service NHS Digital has responsibility for collecting data from across health and social care in England. Data held includes civil registrations for England and Wales and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) for details of all admissions, outpatient appointments and Accident and Emergency attendances at NHS hospitals in England. The NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS) holds details of all admissions, outpatient appointments and Accident and Emergency attendances at NHS hospitals in Wales in the Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW). For REMAP-CAP registry patients, longer term survival including date of death after hospital discharge, will therefore be obtained through data linkage to NHS Digital. Subsequent hospital readmissions will be determined in England from data linkage to HES via NHS Digital and for Wales via data linkage to PEDW via NWIS.",
