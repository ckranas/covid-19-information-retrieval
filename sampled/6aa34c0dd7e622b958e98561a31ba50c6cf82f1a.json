Moreover, Klf5 is also acting on cellular processes such as cell migration, apoptosis, inflammation, angiogenesis and differentiation. Previous studies showed a novel role for Klf5 as a regulator of proliferation and differentiation in skeletal muscle stem cells. Detecting Klf5 at the protein level harbored technical obstacles. Commercially available antibodies exhibited low affinity, low specificity and failed to recognize post-translationally modified forms that are directly relevant to the function. Thus, these obstacles prevent further functional protein studies such as western blots, protein co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Therefore, we used CRISPR/Cas system to establish a stable cell line which carry V5 epitope tag into the N-terminal of Klf5 gene. Insertion into the target side of Klf5 gene via CRISPR-Cas9 system provided an opportunity to overwhelm the above mentioned obstacles. V5 epitope tag would not interfere with the function of the Klf5 and also enable us to recognize endogenous Klf5 via anti-V5 antibody in the mouse myoblast cell lines (C2C12). We confirmed the targeted insertion into the exon 1 of the Klf5 gene both at the DNA and protein levels.",

Hydroxiurea (HU) is an inhibitor of Ribonucleotide reductasethe enzyme that catalyzes the process of free dNTPs synthesis in living cells. Treating cells with HU causes diminishment of the nucleotide pool. As a result, single-stranded DNA regions are generated, which leads to S-phase checkpoint activation. The progression of replication forks is blocked and the completion of DNA replication is prevented. This results in S-phase cell arrest.",

Almost 100 Drosophila proteins with C2H2 zinc fingers also have Zinc finger associated domain (ZAD). Several proteins with ZAD (Zw5, Pita and ZIPIC) were found to interact with CP190 and act as insulator proteins. For some of the ZAD-containing proteins (for example, Weekle and Grauzone) it was shown that their ZAD domains can form dimers with each other. The ability of these proteins to dimerize appears to be especially important in the light of the model suggesting that DNA-binding insulator proteins can support genome looping and organization of chromatin structure via interaction with each other.",

Antipsychotics are administered over long periods in humans; therefore their possible adverse side effects should be taken into consideration. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of haloperidol and clozapine on plasma T3 and T4 concentrations in adult male Wistar rats. Fifty rats aged between 14 and 15 weeks (270 AE 30 g) were divided into five groups (n = 10 in each group), and drugs were administered each day intraperitoneally (IP) for 28 days. The first group was a sham group. The other four groups were considered as low and high treatment doses of the drugs. After a one-week habituation period, animals was administered haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg, n = 10 and 2 mg/kg, n = 10) and clozapine (0.5 mg/kg, n = 10 and 20 mg/kg, n = 10). The rats were anesthetized with ether, and bloods were collected by direct cardiac puncture 24 hours after the last injection. The T3 and T4 plasma concentration levels were analyzed with chemiluminescent immunoassay. Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS v20.0. Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni tests were used. T4 plasma concentration levels significantly differ between sham (median=8.25 mg/kg) and haloperidol (2 mg/kg) (median=7. 00 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg) (me-dian=7.70 mg/kg) and clozapine (20 mg/kg) (median=8.32 mg/ kg), haloperidol (2 mg/kg) (median= 7.00 mg/kg) and clozapine (20 mg/kg) (median= 8.32 mg/kg) groups (p < 0.05). However, no significant differences between the groups regarding to T3 plasma levels were observed. In conclusion, haloperidol and clozapine increased the T4 plasma concentrations, but didn't have any significant effect on T3 plasma concentrations. P-02.09.1-003 Isolation of lipase producing strains of bacillus obtained from olive wastewater and screening for substrate specificity In this work, wastewater samples of an olive factory from Yusufeli (Artvin, Turkey) were collected carefully. After a centrifugation period of samples, supernatants were applied to a 0.45 lm filter and incubated on LB agar medium for 24 hours. Based on differencies of colony morphologies, 13 isolates were selected and purified for identification. 16S Lipase activity assay was carried out by Rhodamine B. All of the 13 strains exhibited lipase activity. For determining the substrat specificity of isolates, 5 different substrates were used; 4nitrophenyl-butyrate, 4-nitrophenyl-caprylate, 4-nitrophenyl-laurate, 4-nitrophenyl-myristate, 4-nitrophenyl-palmitate. Results were measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. All of the strains hydrolyzed 4-nitrophenyl-butirat, while there was no activity with 4-nitrophenyl-palmitate. Bacillus sp. L3 was the most efficient strain that hydrolyzed all of the substrates. The gene encoding for lipase of Bacillus sp. L3 will be cloned and expressed for more analyses and industrial applications.

            "text": "In the course of stable hair growth the differentiation of hair bulb cambium cells to several layers with dissimilar cytochemistry and morphology takes place. This means the activation of different genes in the cells of different layers. Depending upon the hair diameter some layers may be absent (medulla in the thin hairs). The hair diameters of the Carpet sheep breeds vary widely even within the same square mm of the skin. We compared the different layers thicknesses proportions for the follicles with varying hair diameters. The follicle layers were measured on 155 microphotos of transverse histological sections of the follicles made under the standard magnification. All follicles belonged to the same skin biopsy. The measurements were made at the levels just below the fissure separating the hair and inner root sheath appeared. The empirical regressions of the layers thicknesses and of ratios of different layers against hair diameters were counted. The computer model was made on the basis of these regressions which allowed to obtain the absolute parameters of the layers as well as ratios of these parameters for every chosen hair diameter. Using this model we found an essential trend in changing the proportions in relative layers dimensions as we choose the follicles with more and more thick hair. When we change the follicles with 30 mcm hair diameter for those with the hair diameter 100 mcm the ratio of hair medulla diameter to hair diameter increases from 0.07 to 0.76. The ratio of hair diameter to the diameter of inner root sheath increased from 0.70 to 0.84. It means that the thicker is the hair the higher proportion of cells produced by cambium are spent to build innermost layers (medulla layer within the hair or hair within the complexinner root sheath + hair). These data may throw some light on positional information mechanism of layers differentiation. Lignin is a heterogeneous polymer that constitutes 30% of woody plant cell walls. Microorganisms that degrade lignin are fungi, actinomycetes and to a lesser extent, bacteria. In case of industrial applications, the use of fungi is not feasible due to the structural hindrance caused by fungal filaments, requirement of particular culture conditions such as humidity, aeration which are not compatible with industrial processing environments. Bacteria are worthy of being studied for their ligninolytic potential due to their immense environmental adaptability. Environmental concerns and increasingly stringent emissions standards have led the pulp and paper industry to devise ways to decrease the level of chlorinated lignin residues in its effluents through both production process changes and improved treatment technologies. Bleaching with the enzymes is the most promising because the enzymes may be very efficient, and can be used under industrial conditions.",

Beld\u20ac uz Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey Lipases (triacylglycerol acyl hydrolases, EC 3.1.1.3) are regarded as mild and environment-friendly biocatalysts for triacylglycerols hydrolysis. In addition to this hydrolytic reaction, they also catalyze reverse reactions of esterification, transesterification, and interesterification in non-aqueous environments. Substrate, stereo-, regio-and enantio-specificities, and chiral selectivity are certain unique attributes of lipases that make them industrially attractive. These properties are often exploited in the manufacturing of detergent formulations, synthesis of fine chemicals, useful esters and peptides, food processing, paper manufacturing, degreasing of leather as well as in bioremediation.",

            "text": "The Nuclear Factor One (NFI) proteins are important regulators of gene expression in the developing embryo and in adult stem cell niches. This transcription factor family has four members: NFIA, NFIB, NFIC, and NFIX. NFI proteins bind a consensus sequence on gene regulatory regions as homo or heterodimers. Each member of NFI family has a highly conserved N-terminal DNA binding and dimerization domain and a diverse proline rich C-terminal transcriptional activation/repression domain. As knockouts of NFI genes display distinct developmental phenotypes, we hypothesized that specificity of NFI protein function may arise from their interactions with binding partners. A yeast-two hybrid screen identified protein interacting with never in mitosis A1 (PIN1) as a potential NFIB interactor. PIN1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein that specifically recognizes and binds to a phospho-serine or a phospho-threonine followed by a proline (pS/pT-P motif), and catalyzes isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds. Interestingly, both N-terminal and C-terminal domains of four NFI isoforms contain several conserved putative pS/pT-P motifs and some of these are reportedly phosphorylated. We looked for NFI PIN1 interactions in vitro by GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays. While GST-PIN1 fusion protein interacts with all of four NFI isoforms, it binds NFIB most strongly, NFIA and NFIC moderately, NFIX most weakly. Moreover, deletion of the Cterminal domain leads to loss of NFI affinity for PIN1 implicating this domain in NFI-PIN1 interactions. Co-immunoprecipitation assays where we co-expressed various epitope tagged NFI and PIN1 proteins in HEK 293T cells showed that PIN1 precipitates NFIB, as well as other NFI isoforms and NFIB can, in turn, precipitate PIN1. We are currently carrying out site-directed mutagenesis on NFIB to identify the specific residues that PIN1 recognizes. We will further explore if this interaction regulates NFI function during embryonic development.",

Ondassynova al-Farabi Kazakh National University, Almaty, Kazakhstan Currently, the pollution of ecosystems by oil and oil products is increasing everywhere. The oil gets into water and ground during oil production, transportation and accidents. As a result, terrestrial animals and hydrobionts are exposed to oil contamination. Thus, populations of animals decline. It can be assumed that the most sensitive to the effects of pollutants are animals in early stages of development. Amphibians have established themselves as the most convenient bioindicator species. Since lake frog (Rana ridibunda) and green toad (Bufo viridis) are the bioindicator species in Kazakhstan, the study of the effects of oil on their larvae was carried out.",

P-02.09.1-014 Transcriptional regulation of CDO by nuclear factor one proteins B. Kutay, C. Lektemur, V. G\u20ac uler, A. Kumbasar Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey Nuclear Factor One (NFI) transcription factors play important roles in regulation of central nervous system development. Three of the four members of NFI family, NFIA, NFIB, and NFIX are expressed in neural progenitors, as well as neurons and glia in the embryo. Inactivation of these genes in mice show that they function in development of neocortex and hippocampus in the forebrain, cerebellum, spinal cord and precerebellar nuclei of the hindbrain, regulating neurogenesis, gliogenesis, as well as neuronal migration, axonal outgrowth and guidance. All three neural specific NFIs are expressed in precerebellar neuroprogenitors, however, only deletion of NFIB leads to a delay in development of precerebellar neurons. Investigation of misregulated genes in NFIB \u00c0/\u00c0 precerebellar neuroprogenitors identified cell adhesion associated, oncogene regulated (CDO) as a potential downstream target of NFIB. Interestingly, this gene has been reported to be upregulated in NFIA \u00c0/\u00c0 hippocampus as well. CDO, a cell surface glycoprotein of the Ig superfamily, has been found to regulate neurogenesis in vivo, is highly expressed in the developing brain and can induce neural differentiation by promoting heterodimerization of basic helix loop helix transcription factors with E proteins. Bioinformatic analysis of the 5 kb human CDO promoter region identified five NFI binding sites: one cluster in the first 1 kb region, another in the 3.5 kb upstream region. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays showed that NFIB binds to all five sites. Furthermore, NFIB, along with the other neural NFIs, inhibits the proximal CDO promoter driven luciferase activity by up to 85% in HEK293T cells. Preliminary data indicate that NFIs bind to sites in both clusters in human neural stem cells (hNSCs) suggesting that these sites are functional in vivo. We are currently investigating this possibility through NFI overexpression and silencing experiments that will examine regulation of CDO in hNSCs.",

Various dyes used in the textile industry are discharged in large quantities to the receiving environment in the manufacturing process. This is the beginning of a process that is difficult to compensate for environmental and human health. Therefore, contaminated areas should be cleaned. In addition, technologies with high polluting potential should be integrated with biological approach and thereby the impurities consisting of dyes should be reduced. In this experiment; Burdirect Black Meta Konz (C.I. Direct Black 38) was intended to decolorization using laccase. Firstly, enzymatic decolorization of the dye was determined using spectrophotometry. The wavelengths of maximum absorption of Burdirect Black Meta Konz (C.I. Direct Black 38) was determined between 200 and 800 nm. Then, optimization studies have been done. For optimization studies; dye concentration, laccase activity, pH, buffer concentration, temperature, mediator effect, mediator concentration and time parameters were determined. Lastly, in optimal conditions, ATR-FTIR and GC-MS analyzes of ensuring decolorization of dye were analyzed. Decolorization of Burdirect Black Meta Konz (C.I. Direct Black 38) was performed successfully and the absence of any metobolite in the decolorization medium has been provided by ATR-FTIR and GC-MS analyzes. Assessing in terms of application, it can be easily applied by provided the reaction conditions in textile factories. Laccase is a tool of decolorization of dyes in environmental friendly process. thus for the development of spermatids into mature sperm able to fertilize the oocyte.One of the causes of male infertility is in fact impaired sperm fertilization capacity due to sperm chromatin abnormalities and aberrant protamine replacement.Recent research has focused on protamine biology,including protamine gene and protein structure,mechanisms of protamine expression regulation and involvement of the protamines in male fertility.Various studies reported abnormal expressions of protamine (PRM) genes in sperm of infertile men.The aim of the study is to investigate the gene expression of PRM1, PRM2 and their relationship with defective spermatogenesis. Materials and Methods: This study has been performed on 50 infertile and 3 fertile Turkish men.Total RNA was extracted from the sperm pellet using Trizol reagent.After RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis,real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-QPCR) was used to determine the expression of PRM1 and PRM2. Results: Distinct levels of spermatozoal PRM1 and PRM2 mRNA were found in infertile patients compared to fertile control groups.We found that the mRNA levels of PRM1 was reduced in 23 (%47), and the mRNA levels of PRM2 was reduced in 33 (%64) out of 50 infertile patients.In the current study,we found statistical significant association between the PRM1 expression and infertility (p < 0.05).Although PRM2 gene expression was decreased in most of infertile patients compared to fertile control groups,the differences between the groups were statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). Discussion: The results of the study suggested that, the protamine expressions which were associated with spermatogenesis may be important in infertility treatment. Further studies are required in a large series of different populations to clarify the role both PRM1 and PRM2 themselves and their mRNA expression on male fertility. The study was conducted to characterize the processes of muscle growth in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) of different ages inhabited rivers Indera and Varzuga (Kola Peninsula, Russia) in summer and autumn. The expression levels of genes myosin heavy chain MyHC, myostatin (MSTN), and myogenic regulatory factors Myf5, myogenin) in white muscle were studied in salmon parr of age groups 0+, 1+, 2+ in June and October. The changes in expression levels of MRFs, MyHC and MSTN indicating the extent of hyperplasia, hypertrophy, and restriction of muscle growth at different ages of parr were revealed. The pattern of age-related changes differed between seasons. Especially, the expression of genes MyoD, myogenin and MyHC peaked in yearling parr (1+) in summer, that indicated the high rate of hyperplastic and hypertrophic muscle growth in yearlings (1+). At the same time, the MSTN expression level, the negative regulator of muscle growth, was highest in parr at age 1+. Possibly, it is the necessary regulation mechanism to attenuate hyperplasia and hypertrophy and control muscle growth. In autumn, the expression level of MyHC and myogenin were higher in salmon of age 0+ and 1+ then in 2+, indicating the higher intensity of hypertrophy in parr at both first ages in comparison to 2+. There was no differences in expression level of MyoD, Myf5 and MSTN between age groups in autumn. Moreover, the expression levels of genes studied were lower in autumn than in summer. Thus, it indicated the decrease of muscle protein synthesis and muscle growth rate in autumn. These findings expand knowledge on age-and season-related features of muscle development in young Atlantic salmon in their natural habitat.",

Ozbas Gerceker 2 1 SANKO University, Gaziantep, Turkey, 2 Gaziantep \u20ac Universitesi, Gaziantep, Turkey Introduction: The low molecular weight polypeptide 2(LMP2) and low molecular weight polypeptide 7(LMP7) genes are located in the class II region of the Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC) locus on chromosome 6. These genes encode peptides forming the large components of the proteosome complex which degrades short-lived cytoplasmic proteins. Due to the significant role of LMP products antigen presentation, these genes can be accepted as strong candidates of susceptibility factors for different diseases. Population genetic studies can also contribute to understanding of the possible role of LMP gene polymorphisms. The aim of this study was to determine the allele and genotype frequencies of the LMP2 and LMP7 gene polymorphisms in Southeastern Anatolia population and to compare these with the frequencies in other populations previously reported. Material and Methods: A total of 110 healthy and unrelated individuals participated in this study. Polymorphism analyses were done by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) method and allele/ genotype frequencies of LMP2 and LMP7 genes were determined. Results: A deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (v2 = 17.97,p < 0.05) was found for the genotype distribution of LMP2 gene polymorphism, while the LMP7 genotypes found to be distributed (v2 = 0.43,p > 0.05). Discussion: Available allele frequency data for different populations were used to calculate genetic distances and to construct a neighbor-joining tree. Among the included populations, Nahuas (Mexico) population was found to have the lowest genetic distance from the Southeastern Anatolia-Turkey population. Conclusion: It can be concluded that, more studies using different types of genetic markers are needed to clarify the filogenetic relationships of Southeastern Anatolia population with other populations and also the number of population studies on LMP2 and LMP7 genes should be increased to understand their effects as a genetic marker.

The effect of environmental enrichment on spatial memory and certain NMDARs, and 5HT2A expressions in rat pups Introduction: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of environmental enrichment exposed during whole childhood on spatial learning and memory and certain NMDARs, and 5HT2A in the hippocampi of pups. Materials and Methods: Four-weeks old, male, weaning rats were randomised into 2 groups as enviromental enrichment (EE, n = 12) and standard cage control (SCC,n = 12) groups. EEG housed in an enriched environment and SCCG were kept in standard cages for 8 weeks. Following the experiment the rats were trained and tested in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) , open field test (OFT) and forced swim test (FST) in order to assess the neurobehavioural effects of EE. NR2A, NR2B, 5HT2A protein levels were analyzed by western blotting from hippocampi of rats. Results: The positive effect of EE was seen at the learning phase in the MWM as 'latency to locate the hidden platform' between groups thoughout the 4 training days showed that EEG located the hidden platform significantly earlier than SCCG on days 2, 3 (p = 0.006, p < 0.0001). Also EEG significantly spent lower time in the outer zone of the maze on days 2, 3 which was the sign of low anxiety level (p = 0.011, p = 0.049). The parameters of OFT which indicated increased locomotion, exploration and low anxiety were significantly higher in EEG (p < 0.05), in FST comparison of groups showed no difference (p > 0.05). The levels of NR2B and 5 HT2A were significantly increased as compared to SCCG as well (p < 0.0001, p = 0.003).",

This study was aimed to describe the best cell line model for studying phase II xenobiotic metabolizing NQO1 and GST-pi enzymes. For this purpose, mRNA and protein expression of NQO1 and GST-pi enzymes were analyzed in HT29 and SW620 (colon); HEPG2 and HUH7 (liver); PNT1A and PC3 (prostate) cell lines by qRT-PCR and Western blotting techniques, respectively. Protein expression analysis revealed that NQO1 protein was expressed in all cell lines and relative protein expression is highest in the HEPG2 (100%) and PNT1A (97%) while HUH7 (31.9%) showed relatively low expression of NQO1. In addition, NQO1 mRNA expression was relatively high in HT29 (1.68 fold) and PNT1A (1.92 fold) when compared with liver cell line HEPG2 (1.00 fold). GST-pi protein expression was found very high in HUH7 (100%) while there was no expression in HEPG2. GST-pi mRNA expression was relatively higher in PNT1A (3.56 fold) and HT29 (2.47 fold) when compared with HUH7 (1.00 fold). According to these results, choosing the best cell line as model depends on the purpose of the research. For studying metabolism of a chemical by NQO1 and GST-pi or effect of a chemical on translational regulation of these enzymes, it is better to consider protein expression of the cell lines for choosing best model. However, if the aim is to study effect of a chemical on transcriptional regulation of these enzymes, it is better to choose a cell line that expressing highest mRNA of gene of interest. In conclusion, considering both mRNA and protein expression levels together, the best model cell lines for studying phase II xenobiotic metabolizing NQO1 and GST-pi are HT29 and HUH7, respectively.

Cancers can be classified according to cell type; in which they start. Carcinomas are the most prevalent types of cancer and start in epithelial tissues. They are also named as epithelial cancers (ECs) and make up about 85 out of every 100 cancers. Over the past few years, many studies are concentrated on miRNAs, which have emerged as important regulators of gene expression like transcription factors (TFs). TFs are regulators at transcriptional level while miRNAs are post-transcriptional regulatory key-elements. Otherwise the transcription of mRNAs and miRNAs are known to be regulated by TFs and TFs are the targets of miRNAs. Therefore, it is crucial to characterize the relation of TFs, miRNAs and their targets by building circuits in diseases such as in ECs. For this study, miRNA and mRNA expression studies including epithelial tumors and normal samples searched in GEO and Array Express microarray databases. 4 mRNA studies and 4 miRNA study, which were designed for 4 different ECs (breast, lung, ovary and colorectal) were selected to be analyzed. Differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs and miRNAs between epithelial tumors and normal samples were extracted (p \u2264 0.05, 2 fold change).

The dynamic data spanned both primary and secondary phases of the metabolism. Statistical results of transcriptome data were used for reporter metabolite analysis and reporter pathway analysis, which identify the metabolites (or pathways) with a significant coordinated transcriptional change in response to gene deletion perturbation in phosphate and nitrogen metabolisms. Further, the production of actinorhodin, a pharmaceutically important compound, was modeled in the two deletion strains by calculating the metabolic fluxes subject to transcriptional level constraints on enzyme-coding genes. The metabolic switch from primary to secondary metabolism was highlighted in terms of the activity of pathways and fluxes as a result of the computational analyses in this work, leading to a better understanding of the role of phosphate and nitrogen metabolisms in increasing production levels. Introduction: As a member of legume family Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) has been widely used by human kind for many years as food constituent. Especially by folks in rural sites licorice consumed widely. Beside food constituent Licorice has been used for medical purposes as well. Licorice found effective with scientific datas on peptic skin infections, ulcers, inflammation, eczema, Alzheimer disease, liver disease, and cancers. It also has been used as natural sweetener and food additive for preparing candies, chewing gum and beverage since ancient times. Like all other medicine it has not been free of adverse event or toxicological effects. Material and Methods: Alcoholic extracts of plant obtained by maceration process. For in vitro examination of anti-oxidant profile of licorice DPPH free radical scavenging, ABTS cation radical scavenging and cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity assay applied. Application of extract made by oral route to rats for a week. Anti-oxidant profile has been evaluated by Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Arylesterase (ARES), Total Oxidative Stress (TOS) and Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) of serum levels. Determination of toxicological effects ALT, AST, LDH and ALP values studied. Histological investigation applied on liver and kidney tissues. Results and Discussion: Results compared with control and standarts. Antioxidant potential of licorice has been observed by in-vitro assays. Serum MPO and ARES values also compared with in-vitro results and correlation between them has evaluated. Toxicological investigations made after evaluation of AST, ALT, LDH and ALP values. Conclusion: In vitro assays has showed that licorice has potential anti-oxidant effect. Investigation revealed that a mild toxic effect of licorice by biochemical tests. Toxicological profile compared with control group and ALT, AST values found slightly decreased and a mild elevation has been seen in LDH and ALP values.

In the present study, the genetic factors contributing to body weight and fatness were examined under energy rich feeding conditions. Growth traits, lean and fat weight, fat mass gain were analyzed to map QTLs in a set of BXD RI strains. Genome-wide analyses were revealed several genomic loci that control body weight and associated bodily changes in a sex and age-specific manner. The genetic data provided evidence for significant QTLs on chromosome (Chr) 4, 5, 14, and 16. Most likely candidate genes within or near the regions with the highest significance levels were identified. The genes 1700048F04Rik, Gbe1, A830060N17, and four genes Cenpc1, Stap1, Uba6, Gnrhr for example, are suggested as most likely positional candidates accounting for the QTL effects on Chr 5 for fat mass, on Chr 16 for fat mass gain and on Chr 16 for lean weight, and Chr 16 for body weight, respectively.

But measured 30 years earlier by Homer and Goodmanfar UV CD spectrum of Potato virus X (PVX) itself had anomalous character and differed strongly from the spectrum of isolated PVX CP. In the present work we measured far UV CD spectra for two more members of Potexvirusgenus: Alternanthera mosaic virus (AltMV) and Potato aucuba mosaic virus (PAMV) and their free CPs. The AltMV virion and AltMV CP spectra were similar to each other and to the spectra of PapMV and its CP. The PAMV spectrum resembled the PVX spectrum in anomalously low ellipticity of the negative band at 208 nm, but in contrast to PVX, did not have additional peak at 228 nm. Homologous modeling showed that CP of the three viruses is very similar in the core structure, and the observed difference may be explained by differences in disordered parts of proteins. Possible reasons of potexvirus structural variability are discussed and it is suggested that the intravirus potexvirus CPs may assume different conformations in different virions of the same preparation or even along the length of one virus particle.

Malatya is the third largest city in East Anatolian Region of Turkey and TB incidence rate is higher (28.5/100,000) comparing to the general population of the country. For this reason it is important to determine the factors that lead to TB in this population. Disease agent can stay in the latent phase for long periods of time after infecting the individuals. While some infected individuals show the symptoms some others never do and even 90% of these never develop clinical disease. Various mechanisms take place during the host response to infectious agents. Toll-like Receptor (TLR) genes are shown to be candidate genes in these responses. Materials and Methods: In this study 49 TB patients and 50 healthy controls were included. TLR 4 genotyping for rs4986790, rs4986791 was performed by using a commercial TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay kit. Data were summarized by count and percent. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested by chi-square distribution with 1 df. Differences between groups due to allelic and genotypic distributions were analyzed by Pearson's exact or Fisher's exact tests. In all comparisons significance level was considered to be 0.05. Results: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which were subject of this study haven't been screened in Turkish population earlier. No significant association was found between TB and the SNPs we screened in our group of patients. Discussion and Conclusion: Unlike other populations results we couldn't find a significant association between the disease and the genotypes of our patients. The study should be performed in bigger populations in order to confirm the results. P-04.01.1-007 Lytic action of bacteriophages as a tool for the obtaining of images P. Boltovets 1 , R.

The conservation of the sequence of antigen between species of B. burgdorferi complex is essential for the most successful serodiagnostic marker candidate. The presence of homologous proteins in Treponema species could lead to the cross reactivity in syphilis patients, and should be carefully evaluated. Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest challenges in modern medicine. There is a pressing need for better understanding of the specific mechanisms that contribute to resistance to optimize existing therapies. In 2013 in Georgia extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli strain was isolated from the post-surgical sample obtained from gallbladder of the patients with chronic calculous cholecystitis which belongs to the sequence type 23 (ST23) complexes with CTX-M 55 gene. Is this strain characterized by other differences on a proteome level? Are antibiotics against which the strain is resistant inducing the changes in bacterial proteome? The present work was aimed (i) to study the differences on a proteome level (i) between E. coli 92-1917/13-G and ATTC E. coli-reference strain and (ii) to compare the proteomes of 1917 strain at two conditions: with and without antibiotics. 1917 strain was grown in the presence of three antibiotics: Rocephin (Ceftriaxone), Fortum (Ceftazydym) and Claforan (Cefotaxime sodium) together. Proteomic expression was analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Significant differences were found for several proteins, including putative ABC trnsporter arginine protein 2, cystine-binding periplasmic protein, FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, Outer membrane protein A, D-galactose binding periplasmic protein and some others.

P-04.01.1-012 Impact of lactoferrin on the hydrophobicity and adherence to the inert substratum of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from patients with cutaneous drug reaction Skin healing is a complex biological process that requires the involvement of different cell types and humoral effectors. One of the main factors are aggravating and delaying the healing process is represented by the supra-infection with pathogenic or opportunistic microorganisms that grow in specialized consortia embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix, called biofilms, which are extremely resistant to any antimicrobials and host immune response. Lactoferrin (LF) is an ironbinding glycoprotein which promotes skin healing by enhancing the initial inflammatory phase, but also by inducing an overabundant immune response. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of LF, one of the main components of innate, humoral anti-infectious immunity on some microbial features, involved in the first steps of the infectious process, such as hydrophobicity and adherence of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from maculo-pustular lesions in patients with adverse reactions to epidermal growth factor inhibitors. For hydrophobicity measurement the bacterial suspensions were grown in the presence or absence of LF, and then, the \"microbial adherence to hydrocarbons test\" (MATH) was performed. The capacity to develop biofilms on inert substrata and the influence of LF on this feature was spectrophotometrically quantified using an adapted microtiter method, after crystal violet staining. Our results showed that LF decreased the hydrophobicity and limited the biofilm development of all 42 S. aureus tested strains, in a dose and time dependent manner. The decreasing effect on the microbial hydrophobicity was accompanied by a lowering effect on the adhesion of microbial strains to the inert substratum. In conclusion these observations indicate that LF exhibits a wound pro-healing effect, by limiting the microbial colonization and biofilm formation and thus, the occurrence of infectious complications of skin lesion.

The objective of the present study was to assess the presence of enterotoxigenic and methicillin-resistant S. aureus in water buffalo milk and dairy products. A total of 100 water buffalo milk and 100 dairy products (50 water buffalo cream and 50 water buffalo cheese) were collected from different dairy farms, smallholders and local bazaars in Samsun, Turkey. All samples were analyzed using the standard procedure EN ISO 6888-1 and isolates were confirmed for the presence of the 16S rRNA and nuc gene by polymerase chain reaction. S. aureus was identified in 30 of 100 water buffalo milk (30%), 9 of 50 water buffalo cream (18%), and 17 of 50 water buffalo cheese (34%). A total of 99 isolates were confirmed as S. aureus by PCR. Genotypic methicillin resistance was evaluated using PCR for the mecA gene. Out of 99 isolates, 9 (9%) were found to be methicillin resistant (mecA gene positive) by PCR. The enterotoxigenic S. aureus was identified in 12 out of 99 (12%) isolates by the mPCR technique. Five isolates produced staphylococcal enterotoxins SEA (5/12; 41.6%), two isolates produced SEC (2/12; 16 .6%), one isolate produced (1/12; 8 .3%) SED, one isolate produced (1/12; 8.3%) SEE and three isolates produced SEC+SED (3/12; 25%) . None of samples were positive for SEB. In conclusion, the presence of enterotoxigenic and methicillin-resistant S. aureus in milk and dairy products is of significant for public health concern and also these enterotoxin genes sea and sed are predominant toxins that can cause staphylococcus intoxication in humans.",

A family of bacterial proteins which share homology with the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain were identified. The structure of BtpA from Brucella showed that bacterial TIR proteins (BTP) mimick human TIR domain proteins and act on MyD88 signaling pathways to suppress TLR signaling.

            "text": "Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C (CpPLC) is the most toxic extracellular enzyme produced by this bacterium and it is an essential virulence factor in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. CpPLC may lead to cell lysis at concentrations that causes extensive degradation of plasma membrane phospholipids. However, at sublytic concentrations it induces cytotoxicity without causing evident membrane damage. The results of this work demonstrated that the cytotoxic effect of CpPLC requires its internalization and the activation of the MEK-ERK pathway. CpPLC internalizartion occurs through a dynamin-dependent mechanism and in a time progressive process: first, CpPLC colocalizes with caveolin both at the plasma membrane and in vesicles, and later it colocalizes with early and late endosomes and lysosomes. The results also showed that CpPLC requires endocytosis in order to activate MEK-ERK, because treatment with the dynamin inhibitor, dynasore, prevents CpPLC endocytosis, ERK 1/2 activation and cytotoxcity. Cholesterol sequestration as well as inhibition of actin polymerization also prevents CpPLC internalization and cytotoxocity, involving endocytosis in the signaling events required for CpPLC cytotoxic effect. Once internalized, CpPLC induces reactive oxygen species production through the activation of PKC, MEK/ERK and NFjB dependent pathways. Inhibition of either of these signaling pathways prevents CpPLC's cytotoxic effect. In addition, it was demonstrated that NFjB inhibition leads to a significant reduction in the myotoxicity induced by intramuscular injection of CpPLC in mice. These data provide new insights about the mode of action of this bacterial phospholipase C, previously considered to act only locally on cell membrane. Understanding the role of these signaling pathways could lead towards developing rational therapeutic strategies aimed to reduce cell death during a clostridial myonecrosis.

Araya-Castillo 1 , A. Alape-Gir on 1 Bacterial phospholipases are lipolytic esterases surface associated or secreted by a wide variety of bacterial pathogens. Clostridium perfringens, the most broadly distributed pathogen in nature, secretes a prototype phospholipase C (PLC), also called a-toxin, which plays a key role in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. This toxin causes death to cultured cells and extensive myonecrosis when injected intramuscularly in experimental animals. The results of the present study showed that C. perfringens PLC (3-5 ng/ml) induces morphological and biochemical changes characteristic of apoptosis in cultured cells, as determined by scanning electron microscopy. Nuclei condensation and fragmentation were observed by fluorescence microscopy and a typical ladder fragmentation pattern of genomic DNA was detected by DNA in agarose gels. Cell death was prevented by the caspases inhibitors Z-DEVD-fmk and Z-VAD-fmk. C. perfringens PLC induces oxidative stress in cultured cells as determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry using the membrane permeable probe DCFDA. Different antioxidants including the gluthation precursor NAC, several iron chelators and the free radical scavengers tiron and edaravone prevent cell death induced by C. perfringens PLC in cultured cells or in mice challenged intramuscularly with 1.2 lg of that toxin. Thus, this work provides compelling evidence that superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical are involved in the cytotoxic and myotoxic effects of C. perfringens PLC. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that edaravone, a clinically used hydroxyl radical trap, reduced the myonecrosis and the mortality caused by C. perfringens in a murine model of gas gangrene, induced by intramuscular bacterial injection of 10 8 bacteria. This knowledge provides new insights for the development of novel therapies to reduce tissue damage during clostridial myonecrosis.",

In clinical use for cancer therapy, the thermal effect was utilized for hyperthermia therapy with focusing US on cancer to rise the temperature from 41\u00b0C to 44\u00b0C, or further which could induce thermal ablation of cancers. Cavitation leads to a variety of mechanical stress such as shear stress, shock wave, high pressure, and chemical stress such as free radical formation, both of which have been inferred to act simultaneously on all biological materials. It has been indicated that US induces cell killing, cell lysis, loss of viability, and loss of clonogenicity. Recently, we found that heat stress as well as US without thermal effect induce not only DNA single-strand breaks but also DNA double-strand breaks, a most cytotoxic region of DNA, in chromatin DNA detected by both gammaH2AX staining and neutral comet assay. In response to the stresses which induce DNA damage, the DNA damage sensor protein kinase, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATM and Rad3 related (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) become activated form to initiate signal transduction pathways activating cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The molecules consisting of DNA damage response pathway were expected as therapeutic targets because defects in the response to DNA damage agents can be lethal. This work was designed to explore the possible therapeutic targets of the molecules in DNA damage response pathways for future US-aided therapy. Finally, several kinases (e.g., checkpoint kinase) on DNA damage response pathway seems to be the targets for hyperthermia and US therapy. (Ural Branch) , Ekaterinburg, Russia, 2 Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia Based on the recently synthesized (S)-(2-aminopurin-6-yl) amino acids (Gly, Ala, Val, Phe, Pro), we obtained a series of novel modified nucleosides using the transglycosylation reaction. For the first time, it has been demonstrated that the corresponding nucleobases are good substrates for the genetically engineered recombinant E. coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (conversion to nucleosides reached 90-98%). Nucleosides, such as ribosides, 2-deoxyribosides, and arabinosides were obtained in high yields (70-88%). It has been found that yield in the transglycosylation reaction does not depend on the structure of the amino acid fragment. The nucleosides synthesized are considered as potential inhibitors of intracellular adenosine deaminase (AD), the increasing activity of which is observed in hepatitis, cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, obstructive jaundice, prostate and bladder cancer, hemolytic anemia, rheumatic and typhoid fever, gout, and Cooley's anemia. Cytotoxicity of the synthesized nucleosides was tested in the Jurkat (model of human T-lymphoblastic leukemia) and EL-4 (model of mice T-lymphoblastic leukemia) cell lines. The compounds studied did not exhibit cytotoxic activity compared to the activity of the known antitumor agent Nelarabin. The work was financially supported by the Russian Science Foundation (grant 14-13-01077).

The rational design and synthesis of new Schiff bases and their metal complexes have been drawing great interest because of their diverse biological and pharmaceutical activities. So, exploring and designing novel molecules that have biological activities and capable of interacting with nucleic acids has a great significance for disease defence and to discover new DNA-targeted anticancer drugs for chemotherapy. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel Schiff base and its Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the compounds was screened in vitro against bacteria and yeast cultures using broth micro dilution test. DNA binding and DNA cleavage activity of the compounds were investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy and agarose gel electrophoresis. Antimutagenic activity of compounds were tested in the absence of microsomal enzymes (S9-). Also, cytotoxicity of the compounds against HepG2 cell lines was assayed by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthyazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) method.",

Zharkov SB RAS Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, Novosibirsk, Russia Oxidative lesions are abundant due to constant presence of reactive oxygen species in living cells. Repair of oxidative base lesions is initiated by DNA glycosylases. For example, bacterial Fpg and Nei DNA glycosylases excise oxidized purines and pyrimidines, respectively, from DNA. Their human homologs, NEIL1 and NEIL2, have been reported to show preference towards oxidized lesions in DNA bubbles. From these observations, it had been hypothesized that NEIL proteins may be involved in the repair of lesions in DNA bubbles generated during transcription. However, it is not presently clear how NEILs would behave on bubbles more closely resembling transcription intermediates (e. g., containing the RNA strand), and bacterial homologs Fpg and Nei had never been investigated with bubble substrates.",

This could be explained by the errors of polymerase during replication through secondary DNA structures. Furthermore, the SNVs occur much more often in loops of G4 motifs than in G blocks, without changing the motive. In addition, T>G(A>C) and T>C(A>G) substitutions occur significantly more likely in loops which in turn stabilize the G-quadruplex structure. The cancer-related mutations tend to increasing the length of G blocks. The conservation of G4 motifs may indicate an important functional significance of G-quadruplex structures in human genome.

Conclusions: It was concluded that synthesized compounds had considerable anticancer activity against C6 cell lines. However, compound 2, 9 and 10 including 4-methyl, 3-chloro and 3-floro substituents were the most active compounds against the C6 cell line. Also our study results showed that compound 2, 9, 10 induced apoptosis in C6 glioma cells. Rutin is a glycosided flavonoid and known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.TRAIL induces the apoptosis of tumor cells and has no significant toxic effect on normal cells. Although TRAIL is a promising anticancer agent, TRAIL resistance is a major barrier to effective cancer therapy. This study was conducted to examine the utility of the combined use of rutin and TRAIL in prostate cancer cells.",

P-05.01.1-030 Determination of antigenotoxic, proliferative and cytotoxic properties of ellagic acid Since ancient time, people use plant for traditional treatment. Plants or fruits are produced different type of secondary metabolites. Particularly phenolic phytochemicals from plants play an important role in the prevention and treatment of radical damage by inactivating the reactive oxygen compounds due to their antioxidant properties. However, the structure and the activities of many herbal products are not fully elucidated yet and there are several studies about the toxicity of herbal antioxidants and their possible risks to human health. Ellagic acid, phenolic compounds, is an important substance. Ellagic acid is a naturally occurring plant phenol found in numerous fruits, including blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, cranberries, walnuts, pecans, pomegranates and wolfberries. Different researchers give some information about the biological activities of ellagic acid.",

P-05.01.1-032 Analysis of molecular cytogenetic alterations in gastric and colon carcinoma by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (Array CGH) Introduction: Genomic DNA regions are frequently lost or gained during tumor progression. We aimed to evaluate tumor samples of patients with gastric cancer and colorectal carcinoma to show these genetic alterations by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (Array CGH) method. Materials and Methods: DNA isolation was performed from the tumor samples obtained from sixteen patients with primary gastric adenocarcinoma and twelve patients with colon adenocarcinoma. Then, agarose gel electrophoresis was performed in those DNA samples. Following electrophoresis of DNA, Array CGH procedure was performed to four patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and three patients with colon adenocarcinoma who had DNA breaks with 100-200 kb. Results: After Array-CGH study, many common genetic changes in gastric and colon cancer genome were determined. In gastric cancer DNA samples, common losses were detected in chromosome 1p34. 1, 1p13.3, 1q22, 3q29, 5p13.2, 6q24.1, 7q11.23, 7q22.1, 8q 12.1, 9p12, 11q13.1, 12 q24.31, 14q32.31, 16q22.1, 17q21.2, 19q13.3, and 20q11 .23, and also common gains were detected in chromosome 3p26.1, 6q27, 8q12.1, 15q11.2 and Xq25. In colon cancer DNA samples, common losses were detected in chromosome 1p34. 1, 3q29, 7p22.2, 7p11.21, 9q34.11, 12q24.31, 17q21.2, 17q25.1, 19p13.3, 19p13.33, 20q11.21, and 20q11.23 , and also common gains were detected.in chromosome 14q32. 33, Xp22.33, Xp22.11, Xp13.3, Xp11.1 and Xq25 . Both in gastric and colon cancer DNA samples, common losses were detected in chromosome 12q24. 31, 17q21.2, and 19p13.3 , and common gains were detected in Xq25. Discussion and Conclusion: We think that these common changes, generally in DNA loss areas harboring tumor suppressor genes and DNA gain areas harboring oncogenes, may important in gastrointestinal tumorigenesis. The DNA of every cell is under a constant attack by various mutagenic factors which damage the DNA and can cause cell cycle arrest and even cell death. Accumulation of DNA damage is the basis for cancer development and one of the reasons for aging of the organisms. In order to preserve the integrity of its DNA cells have evolved an impressive array of DNA repair pathways, which are precisely coordinated with the progression of the cell cycle. One of the first events at the site of DNA damage is Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) recruitment which is a sensor for single strand breaks in DNA. PARP1 catalyzes the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) or PAR which is needed for the recruitment of many other DNA repair proteins by means of PAR-binding domains.",

Introduction: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease associated with reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. BCR-ABL fusion gene which exhibits constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity has a main role in CML. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is used as a first line treatment in CML patients, but imatinib resistance leads to failure in therapy. The application of imatinib in combination with other anticancer agents may be a strategy to increase the antileukemic effect of imatinib. In this study, we have investigated the antiproliferative effect two novel agents: a benzamide derivative XT5 and a benzoxazole derivative XT2B in combination with imatinib. These molecules were investigated in imatinib-sensitive (K562s) and imatinib-resistant (K562r) CML cell lines. Materials and Methods: Antiproliferative and apoptotic effects were assessed by MTT assays and flow-cytometry, respectively. We also evaluated the effects of these compounds on the expression of apoptosis-related genes BAX, BCL-2, BAD, BIM, BCL-XL and MCL1 by real-time quantitative PCR. Results: Treatment of K562 cells with XT5 increased the expression levels of the pro-apoptotic genes BAX, BAD and BIM in both sensitive and resistant cells. However, XT2B was not found to have similar effects on K562r and K562s cells. Combined application of XT5 increased cell death in the MTT assay. MTT assay demonstrated that IC50 for XT5 treated cells in K562r with imatinib (IC50 = 3.5) is lower than K562r without imatinib (IC50 = 8.5). Discussion and Conclusion: Our results showed that combining XT5 with imatinib has more antiproliferative and apoptotic effect on a CML cell line. As a result combination of XT5 with imatinib can be an alternative approach to overcome imatinib resistance. Introduction: The MMR(Mismatche Repair) system recognizes base-base mismatches and insertion or deletion loops in doublestranded DNA, and it degrades the error-containing region of the newly synthesized strand, allowing the polymerase to correctly resynthesize the second strand according to the template sequence. The human MMR system includes the MLH1 and MSH2. Alteration in expression or a defect in MLH1 or MSH2 can cause resistance to anti-cancer drugs used in chemotherapy. The attempt of the MMR system to detect drug induced DNA damage, triggers the activation of apoptosis, a mechanism which may enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy. Loss of the MMR system would make the neoplastic cell less able to initiate apoptosis. Inability to initiate apoptosis could be a mechanism of resistance to drugs. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal disease originating from aberrations in hematopoietic stem cell. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor has significantly improved clinical outcome for CML patients. However, patients develop resistance when the disease progresses to the blast phase (BP) and there are several mechanisms involved in imatinib resistance. In this study we investigated the role of MMR system in imatinib resistance. Materials and Methods: K562s (sensitive) and K562r (resistance) were grown in RPMI-1640. K562r cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 5 lM imatinib RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, RT-PCR was performed respectively. Results: The results demonstrated that expression of MLH1 in K562r cells is dramatically lower than equal amount of imatinib treated K562s cells, whereas MSH2 expression level did not change in both cell lines. Conclusion: It can be suggested that alteration and down-regulation of MLH1 genes leads to imatinib resistance. P-05.01.1-037 Characterization of interaction between Rad51 inhibitor DIDS and human serum albumin D. Velic, S. Henry, C. Charlier, M. Popova, P. Weigel, J. Masson, I. Nabiev, F. Fleury CNRS/University of Nantes, Nantes, France 4 0 -diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2 0 -disulfonic acid (DIDS) has been largely used during the last 30 years for its inhibitory effect on anion transporters and channels. More recently, Ishida and colleagues have described a possible mechanism by which DIDS inhibits Rad51-mediated homologous pairing and strand exchange, key processes in DNA repair by Homologous Recombination. Thus, DIDS could act as a potential revertant of radioand chemo-resistance in cancer cells, which is the major cause of failure during therapeutic protocols. New drugs targeting Rad51 protein have since been developed with potential use for medical applications. In this context, we attempted to determine the behaviour of DIDS towards blood and plasma proteins such as serum albumins. Firstly, we analysed the effects of several environmental factors such as solvent polarity, which may affect the stability of the molecule. Secondly, we analysed the spectroscopic properties of DIDS in the presence of Human or Bovine Serum Albumin proteins. UV-visible absorption, Circular Dichroism, Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Isothermal Calorimetry were used. Here we show for the first time that DIDS can interact with both Serum Albumins. We have also determined the characteristics of these interactions. The comparison of several DIDS derivatives led us to identify the essential chemical moiety of this compound involved in the interaction. Moreover, by using site competition approaches we show that the main binding site for this molecule is in subdomain IB of the protein. These findings show that the binding of DIDS to serum albumin proteins may change the equilibrium between the free and bound DIDS forms, thereby affecting its bioavailability and efficiency against the Rad51 recombinase protein.",

It regulates many cellular processes, such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and senescence. In contrast to p53, p73 is rarely mutated in tumors and elevated p73 expression is observed in many types of cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma, neuroblastoma, and lung. Defining regulatory mechanisms which control p73 protein abundance and activity will be crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancers. MDM2 is known as the key player in regulation stability and activity of p53. In addition, p53 induces MDM2 transcriptional activity, and Caspase-2, 3 activations which cleave MDM2 N-terminal at Asp 367. Cleaved form of MDM2 binds p53 and promotes its stabilization. MDM2 suggested as a candidate to modulate p73 activity and stability too. However, an interaction between p73 and MDM2 has not defined well. In this study, we aimed to analyze the role of MDM2 in p73 stability. To define this relationship, firstly, we overexpressed the TAp73beta isoform using TREx system in Hep3B. TAp73 beta and MDM2 protein levels were determined by western blot. To examine whether MDM2 mediate TAp73 beta protein degradation by the proteasomes, cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor, MG132 for 4 hours prior to analysis. Previous studies showed that p53-induced Caspase-2 and Caspase-3 activation cleaves MDM2. Considering this, we firstly examined Caspase-3 activation by western blot in Hep3B TAp73 Beta cells. Then we analyzed expression of cleaved MDM2 and TAp73 beta levels following caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK treatment. As a conclusion, TAp73 beta-induced full-length MDM-2 expression. Furthermore, TAp73 beta enhanced cleavage of MDM2 via increased Caspase-3 activation. In addition, inhibition of Caspase-3 activation caused a decrease in cleaved-MDM2 levels in parallel with TAp73 Beta expression repression. Our results suggested positive regulation between MDM2-TAp73 beta. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common type of liver cancer and third leading cause of cancer related deaths in worldwide. Discovery of new targets is important in survival of HCC patients. p73 is a transcription factor which is the member of p53 family. It has two promoters; while p1 promoter expresses apoptotic TA isoforms, p2 promoter expresses anti-apoptotic DN isoforms. In addition, alternative splicing in C terminal creates many isoforms of TA and DN p73. It has been shown that both TAp73 and DNp73 isoforms are expressed in HCC patient tissue and cell lines. The ratio between TAp73 and DNp73 affects the apoptotic response, drug response and prognosis. Accordingly, identification of the role of p73 and its targets are important in discovery of new treatment strategies in HCC. To understand the role of p73 isoforms in HCC, firstly we performed MTT assays following DNA-damaging drugs and multikinase inhibitor, Sorafenib treatment to categorize HCC cell lines as resistant or sensitive. After that, we analyzed the expression levels of TAp73 isoforms via Western Blot in all HCC cell lines. Then we overexpressed the TAp73beta isoform using TREx system in Hep3B and SNU449 cells. These two clones were analyzed for DNA damaging drug response by MTT, cell cycle and apoptosis by Flow cytometry, and tumor formation by in vitro and in vivo experiments.",

There is no correlation between basal expression of p73 isoforms and drug responses in HCC cell lines. 3. There is no change in expression of p73 isoforms after treatment of drugs. 4. We showed that the ectopic expression of TAp73beta in Hep3B arrested the cell cycle in G1/ S and decreased the colony formation. Therefore, the capacity of tumor formation of the cells dramatically decreased in SCID mice. As a result, we revealed that TAp73 beta play role in tumor formation, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage responses in HCC.

Koshenov, T. Yeleussizov, M. Redrejo-Rodriguez, A. Ishchenko, B. T. Matkarimov, M. Saparbaev National Laboratory Astana, Astana, Kazakhstan Oxidative DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species is believed to be a major type of endogenous cellular damage. Oxidatively damaged DNA bases are substrates for two overlapping repair pathways: DNA glycosylase-initiated base excision (BER) and apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease-initiated nucleotide incision repair (NIR). In the BER pathway, an AP endonuclease cleaves DNA at AP sites and 3 0 -blocking moieties generated by DNA glycosylases, whereas in the NIR pathway, the same AP endonuclease incises DNA 5 0 to a number of oxidized bases. Majority of characterized AP endonucleases possess classic BER activities and about half of them are able to catalyze NIR activity. At present, the molecular basis of DNA substrate specificities of various AP endonucleases remains unclear. Here, we examined amino-acid sequence requirement of the NIR activity of human major AP endonuclease 1 (APE1). Amino acid sequence alignment of various AP endonucleases including E coli exonuclease III (Xth), human APE1 and archaeal Mth212 revealed conserved amino acid residues in the NIR-specific AP endonucleases APE1, Mth212 and ExoA that are absent in Xth. Based on these data, we constructed four APE1 point mutants Y128H, N174Q, G231S and T268D and examined their DNA substrate specificities. Results obtained from biochemical characterization of APE1 mutants are discussed in the light of the evolutionary conserved DNA repair functions of AP endonucleases and whether these functions can be mutationally separated from.",

P-05.01.1-043 ERCC2/XPD polymorphisms and colorectal cancer risk: a case control study in a north eastern Iranian population J. Mehrzad Islamic Azad University, Neyshabur, Iran Excision repair cross-complimentary group 2 (ERCC2) is one of the important DNA repair genes.ERCC2 codon 751 and 312 polymorphisms has been shown to modulate cancer risk. We therefore assessed the relationship between the ERCC2 polymorphisms and the susceptibility to colorectal cancer in a case-control study. There were 105 lung cancer cases and matched healthy controls in this study. Information concerning demographic and risk factors was obtained, each person donated 2 ml blood for biomarker testing. ERCC2 genotypes were determined by T-ARMS-PCR method. All of the statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (v 20.0). There was significant difference between the frequencies of ERCC2 polymorphism in cancer cases and controls (p < 0.05). The frequencies of ERCC2 751 Gln allele were 6.2% in controls and 13.8% in cancer cases. The individuals with Lys/Gln+Gln/Gln combined genotype were at an increased risk for lung cancer as compared with those carrying the Lys/Lys genotype (adjusted OR=2.80, 95%=CI 1.21\u00c06.48). The above findings indicate that the genetic polymorphism in the ERCC2 codon 751 is associated with the risk of colorectal cancer in an Iranian population (Neyshabur citizenship). Peptide pore blockers are potent tools to study structure and function of potassium voltage-gated channels (Kv). KcsA-Kv1.x chimeras, in which a ligand-binding site of eukaryotic Kv-channel is inserted into bacterial KcsA channel, mimic properly the pore domain of Kv-channels. A fluorescence-based approach to study the binding of peptide blockers with KcsA-Kv1.1-KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras was developed by us. This approach rested on high-level expression of KcsA-Kv1.x chimeras in E.coli inner membrane, binding of fluorescently-labeled toxin at the surface of the spheroplast and analysis of competitive binding of studied ligands by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM).",

Asparagus racemosus root extracts (AR) have been exhibited to show a wide range of pharmacological benefits. In this study, liposomes of AR were developed and assessed their physicochemical properties and anti-inflammatory activity in monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1). Liposomes containing ratios of AR to lipid and phosphatidylcholine to cholesterol ratio were synthesized by thin-film hydration (TF), reverse-phase evaporation (REV), and polyol dilution (PD). The in vitro anti-inflammatory activity was assessed in terms of inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) in lipopolysaccharide activated THP-1 by ELISA. The size of AR liposomes prepared by TF were larger, whereas those prepared by REV and PD were smaller. AR to lipid ratio was shown to have no influence on particle size, whereas zeta potential enhanced with increasing AR to lipid ratio. AR liposomes with lipid ratio of 1:5 achieved the highest value of entrapment efficiency and were at the highest with polyol dilution method. AR was found to have no toxic effects on THP-1 cells. The anti-inflammatory activities of AR and AR liposomes in terms of TNF-a in THP-1 cells were was exhibited to possess the highest values of around 52% at AR concentration of 1 lg/ml and % TNF-a inhibition tended to decline with the increasing amount of AR. This result may be attributed to the increased amount of liposomal particles being uptaken into the cells as a result of the increasing AR concentrations. It can be suggested that AR liposomes could be an alternative choice of topical/transdermal drug delivery for anti-inflammatory activity.

It was shown that inhibition of IRE1 leads to up-regulation of the expression of KRT18, CD24, MEST, CENPU, MYL9, ING1, ING2, MYBL1, and MYBL2 genes at the mRNA level in U87 glioma cells, with more profound changes for MEST, MYBL1, and CD24 genes. Hypoxia leads to up-regulation of the expression of CD24, ING1, and ING2 genes and to down-regulationof KRT18 gene in glioma cells. At the same time, inhibition of IRE1 modifies the effect of hypoxia on the expression of all studied genes: suppresses effect of hypoxia on ING1 gene, eliminates hypoxic regulation of KRT18, CD24, and ING2 genes in glioma cells. The present study demonstrates that inhibition of IRE1 enhances the expression of all studied genes and modifies the hypoxic regulation of these gene expressions in gene specific manner and thus possibly contributes to slower glioma cell proliferation, but several aspects of this regulation remain to be further clarified.",

Background: Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is an important health problem worldwide. Its pathophysiology is multicausal and involves environmental, genetic and acquired factors. Factor V Leiden (FVL), prothrombin G20210A (PT G20210A), and Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations are to predispose to venous thrombosis. The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of FVL, PT G20210A and MTHFR polymorphisms between patients with DVT and healthy controls. Methods: This study was conducted at the Bozok University Hospital. Total 220 participants were included in this study, 126 patients with DVT and 94 healthy blood donors. In order to identify FVL, PT G20210A, MTHFR C677T and MTHFR A1298C, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was utilized combined with the amplification refractory mutation system. Results: In 126 patients FVL was present in 54 (42.8%) patients while in controls FVL was present in only 18 (19.1%). Frequency of FVL was significantly higher in cases as compared to controls (p < 0.05). PT G20210A mutation was present in 13 patients (10.3%) and in 5 healthy participants (5.3%). MTHFR C677T and MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms were almost equally distributed among patients and healthy participants. However, the concomitant presence of FVL and double heterozygous polymorphisms of MTHFR C677T/A1298C was found in 11 patients (8.7%) and in 2 healthy controls (2.1%), showing significant association with deep venous thrombosis. Conclusion: In this study, the frequencies of FVL and PT G20210A polymorphisms were found significantly higher in patients with DVT than those in healthy participants. Thus, FVL and PT G20210A polymorphisms have a contributory role on the development of DVT In contrast, MTHFR C677T and MTHFR A1298C genotypes were not associated with a predisposition to development of DVT. But, a combination of double heterozygous polymorphisms of MTHFR C677T/A1298C with FVL may be associated with increased risk of DVT.

In this study, regional results of CH screening program in Turkey between 2006 and 2015 were assessed retrospectively. We have evaluated the results of Marmara, Central Anatolia, Aegean and Mediterranean regions in which our laboratories are located.",

Recall rate was 3.5%. CH cases of neonatal TSH levels greater than 25lU/ml were 26. The incidence of CH of this group was 1:2532. There were no significant differences in the number of congenital hypothyroidism between males and females (p > 0.05). The preliminary results of our study indicate that the incidence of CH in our region is higher than the worldwide reports as has been proved by preceding studies. Iodine deficiency, dyshormonogenesis, highly consanguineous population, may contribute to the high incidence of CH in Turkey. Newborn screening of CH must be developed for detecting true cases and TSH cut off point must be reviewed for decreasing redundant recall rate.",

Tsakalidou 1 1 Agricultural University of Athens, Athens, Greece, 2 Institut Pasteur de Lille, Lille, France Introduction: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) constitute a significant group of microorganisms for the food industry, as they play a key role in food fermentation and consequently in human health. Lactobacillus acidipiscis ACA-DC 1533 is a Gram-positive, motile, rod-shaped LAB isolated from traditional Greek Kopanisti cheese. Here we present the in silico analysis of the first complete genome sequence of L. acidipiscis in order to explore the biology of the species. Materials and Methods: Sequencing of L. acidipiscis genome was performed using the HiSeq 2000 and PacBio RSII sequencing platform technologies and the genome assembly was validated against an NheI optical map of the L. acidipiscis genome. Protein-coding sequences were predicted by Glimmer, rRNA genes by RNAmmer and tRNA genes by the tRNAscan-SE server. Potential genomic islands were detected using the Island-Viewer software tool, prophage regions by PHAST and the subsystem-based annotation by RAST server. Finally, the circular representation of L. acidipiscis genome keyed to the COG groups was constructed by CGView server. Results: The sequencing analysis resulted in one continuous genomic scaffold of 2,678,726 bp with a G+C content of 39.75%. The genome contains 2,525 protein-coding genes on the chromosome covering up to 82.09% of the genome sequence, 63 tRNA and 18 rRNA. According to the subsystem-based annotation, 1,562 protein-coding genes were assigned to 310 metabolic subsystems. The most abundant of the subsystems are related to carbohydrates (n = 287, 18.37% of total protein-coding genes) and protein metabolism (n = 173, 11.08% of total protein-coding genes). Furthermore, three prophage regions were detected; one intact (43.5Kb), one incomplete (14.7 Kb) and one questionable (29.3 Kb). Discussion and Conclusion: The whole genome analysis of L. acidipiscis ACA-DC 1533 provided interesting information about a not well-studied species.",

Analysis of the human genome reveals that potential G-quadruplex sequences are enriched in promoters of the oncogenes. Growing body of evidence suggests that G-quadruplexes (G4) may play putative roles in various biological processes, such as the regulation of gene expression. Consequently, targeting the oncogenic G-quadruplexes using small molecules is an alternative strategy for the potential treatment of cancers. Porphyrin derivatives are promising class of drug in this respect, being nucleic acids binders and generators of reactive oxygen species under visual light irradiation. Interaction between porphyrin derivatives and G4 DNA from oncogene promoter region has been studied in vitro. We applied chemical probing, circular dichroism spectroscopy and UV melting techniques in order to map the oxidized bases, monitor structural rearrangements and evaluate stability of the resulting DNA structures. Specifically, we observed that G4 DNA is considerably more susceptible to lightinduced modification than duplex DNA; 5 0 -terminal tetrads of the G4 DNA are preferably oxidized; structural changes induced by oxidation result in decrease of the thermodynamic stability of the G4 DNA. Irreversibility of these effects on DNA make porphyrin derivatives perspective lead compounds for rational design of ligands targeting human oncogenes.

TPW is one of the abundant available phenolic biomass among plantal wastes. In this study, black and green teas and their wastes were used. The aim of the study is to determinate the phenolic content and the radical scavenging activities of the samples, and to measure their effects on hydrogen peroxide-induced erythrocyte damage due to analyzing the reducing potential of erythrocyte involving glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. Total polyphenol content of samples was determined as mg catechine per dry mass by using Folin-Ciocalteau reactive and DPPH radical scavenging activity was estimated by Cuendet method as equivalent catechine standard. In erythrocyte, GSH level was measured by method of Sedlak and Lindsay while GR and GPx activities were assayed by the methods of Bergmeyer and Beutler, respectively. The highest phenolic content was observed in green tea and its wastes (p < 0.01) whereas black fiber waste had the lowest phenolic content. Therefore, the highest radical scavenging activity and GSH level were detected in green tea and its wastes (p < 0.01). Erythrocyte with the extracts of the teas and their wastes had the similar enzyme activities for both GPx and GR. In sum, the teas and wastes have antioxidant activity but, green tea and its leaf waste hade higher antioxidant activity than other samples. The tea wastes might be evaluated as many of protective health products, particularly in cosmetic fields thus, these by-products no application for any area is expected to become an economical value.

The aim of the work was to determine the metabolic parameters of blood serum of goats, expressed in terms of biochemical parameters and interfacial tensiometry and study their relationship to metabolic processes in the body goats depending on the age and the period of the reproductive cycle. The 90 healthy goats were divided into 5 groups. The dynamic surface tension (DST) parameters were obtained from dependences of a surface tension (r) vs. time (t): at t?0 (r 0 ), at t = 0.02 s (r 1 ), t = 1 s (r 2 ) and t?\u221e (r 3 ). This work was supported by the Russian Scientific Foundation (14-16-00046). All animals had 4-5% fat content. The contents of total protein (5.4%), albumin (8.4%) and urea (8.8%) are higher for the lactating animals as compared to the normal goat values.

Materials and Methods: This study consisted of 349 consecutive patients and controls who underwent coronary angiography. For each patient, the total Gensiniscore (GS) was calculated andthose with a GS of >20 were classified as the high GS group (HGG), and those with a GS less than 20 were defined as the low GS Group (LGG). The total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS) levels were measured using the Erelmethod. The OSI, which is an indicator of the oxidative balance, was calculated as the percentage ratio of TOS to TAS. Results: The TAS was lower in the HGG than LGG. The TOS and OSI were higher in the HGG than LGG. The correlation analysis showed that GS was negatively associated with the TAS and positively with the TOS and the OSI. The multivariate analysis showed that age, TOS, and HDL-C were independent variables for a high GS. The cut-off level of 10.9 lmol H 2 O 2 equiv./ L for serum TOS levels predicted high GS with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 56%.",

Sariyar Akbulut 1 1 Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey, 2 Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey Efflux by multidrug resistance (MDR) pumps is a common defense mechanism used against antimicrobials. By pumping the drugs out, these pumps significantly reduce the efficacy of drugs. One approach to overcome this limitation is offered by the combinatorial therapies where drugs are co-administered with together with pump inhibitors. By simply preventing the efflux of the drug, the presence of inhibitors enhance drug efficacy. (-)-Roemerine is an aporphine type alkaloid with significant antibacterial (against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli) and antifungal (against Candida strains) activities. Interestingly, (-)-roemerine was also found to enhance the cytotoxic response mediated by vinblastine in multidrug-resistant KB-V1 cells. In the same study, this finding was linked to its possible interaction with P-glycoprotein, a eukaryotic MDR pump. Taking this finding as the starting point, the current study investigates the potential of roemerine as an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein homologue pump, BmrA, in Bacillus subtilis 168. The antimicrobial agent berberine was used as the model agent since its efficacy is reduced by efflux through MDR pumps. To this end, Bacillus subtilis 168 cells were subjected to 100 lg/mL berberine, a value well below the MIC. This concentration only slightly retarded growth for 2 hours but then cells resumed their regular growth. Upon addition of 25 lg/mL (-)-roemerine to the Bacillus subtilis 168 cells treated with berberine, growth pattern changed, indicating possible interaction with BmrA. Further investigation for the change in the expression of BmrA was achieved with real time PCR analysis. Glucose oxidase is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to D-glucono-1,5-lactone and hydrogen peroxide. We hypothesized that enzyme would cause a double negative effect on cancer cells, by reducing the presence of glucose in cancer microenvironment and producing reactive oxygen species. To increase enzyme stability and enhance cellular uptake we encapsulated the enzyme with a thin acrylamide layer. The purpose of this work was to optimize the synthesis of these glucose oxidase nanoparticles and investigate their effect on cancer cells. Nanoparticles containing single glucose oxidase were synthesized in two steps; first by introducing the vinyl groups onto the surface of enzyme by acyloylation followed by polymerization step with acrylamide monomers. Encapsulated enzymes are approximately 150 nm in size and retain most of their activity. After the optimization of nanoparticles, the anticancer potency of these nanoparticles was in vitro tested in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line.",

Here we used fluorescence microscopy to study in meso crystallization process of bacteriorhodopsin. Several observations provide new insights into the in meso crystallization process. The crystallization starts with formation of microcrystals, followed by growth of a dominating crystal at the expense of smaller ones and formation of a depletion zone around it. These observations demonstrate an Ostwald ripening mechanism of the in meso crystal growth. The depletion zone formed around the growing crystal is consistent with the previously proposed analogy relating in meso crystallization with the crystallization in a microgravity convection-free environment.

Saatcioglu University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway Androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays a central role in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer (PCa), including when the disease progresses to castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). The second central signaling pathway in PCa, similar to various other cancers, is the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling. Importantly, these two oncogenic pathways cross-regulate each other in PCa cells by reciprocal feedback, thereby maintaining tumor cell survival even when one is suppressed. We have previously identified that the six transmembrane protein of prostate 1 (STAMP1) promotes PCa cell proliferation as well as inhibits apoptosis through, at least in part, regulating the ERK MAPK signaling.",

N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) that vasodilatory effect is known,may be considered as a suppressor agent for vasospasm developing during CABG. However, for the prevention of complications that may arise during or after CABG mechanism of these vasodilatory effects should be described. This study was aimed to investigate the role of ATPase enzyme on the vasodilatory effect of NAC. Materials and Methods: In this study, 28 adult male Wistar albino rats were used. Rats were separated into four groups as control rats (G1), 2 mM NAC (G2), 5 mM NAC (G3) and 10 mM NAC (G4). A portion of the thoracic aorta isolated from rats was used for the relaxation response recording, and the other portion was used for measurement of NaKATPase activity. Isolated smooth muscle rings are suspended in the 20 ml organ bath containing Krebs solution for relaxation responses. In all groups, level of smooth muscle contraction were allowed to reach a plateau by adding 60 mM KCl to the organ bath. Then, in the first 10 minutes of application relaxation responses which created by adding NAC to the medium were recorded and the maximum relaxation responses were measured. NaK ATPase activity was determined using the Mazzanti method. Groups means were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The threshold for statistical significance was set at .05. Results: The contraction force decreased in all NAC dose groups compared to control group and this reduction was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Similarly, NaK ATPase activity is also decreased in a dose dependent manner (p < 0.05).",

In the presented study, we isolated and characterized a novel feather-degrading bacterium that shows keratinolytic activity. A Bacillus UK69, which was isolated from the soil samples taken from farmland on Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University campus, showed high keratinolytic activity when cultured on feather meal medium. The enzyme activity was studied in the pH range of 5.0-12.0. The optimum temperature for keratinase activity was investigated by varying the incubation temperature between 20\u00b0C and 80\u00b0C. Optimum keratinolytic activity was observed at 60\u00b0C and pH 10.5. The enzyme was stable at 60\u00b0C. The activity was investigated in the presence of some chemicals, including SDS, Tween 80, DMSO, Triton X-100, EDTA, NaCl, ZnCl2, CaCl2, glucose. The keratinolytic activity was inhibited by all chemicals tested to some degree. The molecular weight of keratinase was determined by polyacrylamide gel (10%) using standard molecular weight marker and estimated about 37 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The keratinase isolated from Bacillus UK69 could be used in biotechnological processes i.e. feather degradation, wastewater treatment and in industrial processes, such as detergent, food and leather industries. Introduction: Hemoglobinopathies, including thalassemia, abnormal hemoglobins, constitutes a major group of inherited disorders of hemoglobin synthesis. The reduced or absent of the beta (b) or alpha (a) globin chains of the adult human hemoglobin molecule results beta or alpha thalassemias, leading to imbalanced a-globin/non a-globin chains. The aim of this study was to give a quik desicion with a/b-globin mRNA ratio for sequencing of a or b gene, when the anemia is not detectable. Materials and Methods: mRNA and cDNA extraction of 25 bthalassemia and 15 a-(including two of 3.7 Kb Del./HbS) thalassemia subjects and normal controls were accomplished using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit and Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit, respectively, following the manufacturer's instructions. We used cDNA as a template in the real-time PCR amplification using primers specific for a, b globin genes. Amplification was performed in a LightCycler \u00d2 480 instrument. The a/b-globin mRNA ratio of each sample was calculated based on the 2 \u00c0DDCT method. Results: a/b-globin mRNA ratios calculated in a-thalassemia subjects relative to normal control as a result of numbers of defective a-globin genes. The a/b-globin mRNA ratio was found higher in b-thalassemia subjects. Coinheritance of a-thalassemia in Hb S subjects concluded a stabile a/b-globin mRNA ratio as per a-thalassemia or b-thalassemia subjects. Discussion and Conclusion: Instability in a/b-globin chains is a significant factor of thalassemia disease severity and can be used before deciding type of gene sequencing when the anemia is not detectable. This study indicates that imbalance in globin gene expression could be demonstrated by measuring a/b-globin mRNA ratio, which was conveniently and accurately determined by qRT-PCR and give an information about globin gene function which gene should be correct to investigate an individual for globin gene mutation.

Guler 1 1 Bilkent University UNAM, Institute of Materials Science and Nanotechnology, Ankara, Turkey, 2 Kazan Federal University, Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan, Russia Supramolecular chirality is rooted in asymmetric spatial arrangement of structural elements (e.g. molecules or units with higher hierarchy). Self-assembled systems giving rise to this kind of chirality are of great importance because they closely resemble natural biological systems and potentially can lead to new advanced functional materials. In the process of self-assembly, both molecularly chiral and achiral structural units can organize into chiral nanostructures.",

            "text": "Chiral arrangement of chromophore molecules in space is known to result in emergence of chiroptical properties of a chromophore. Organization of pigment-protein complexes into macrodomains in green plants gives rise to biochirality emanating from long-range chiral order of complexes. Owing to this order, macrodomains start to absorb circularly polarized light intensively and thus exhibit huge circular dichroism (CD) signal. In our study, a simple approach which was aimed at mimicking the biochirality phenomenon makes use of self-assembling peptide amphiphiles and their interactions with pyrene chromophore. Designed peptide amphiphiles are capable of self-assembly into nanofibers with chiral interior, which in principle gives an opportunity to achieve long-range chiral order. Two modes of interactioncovalent and noncovalentwere utilized in order to induce supramolecular chirality. Covalent interaction mode included direct covalent attachment of pyrene to peptide sequence. Upon self-assembly of peptide amphiphile into nanofibers intense circular dichroism phenomenon was observed. Noncovalent interaction mode envisioned encapsulation of pyrene molecules in the hydrophobic core of nanofibers of another peptide amphiphile. Co-assembly of peptide amphiphile and pyrene molecules led to chiral order and intense CD signal. In addition, it was possible to control the sign of CD signals by using either of peptide isomers, L or D.

HDL3 subgroup was obtained by heparin-Mn-dextran sulphate precipitation method and cholesterol was measured with direct (homegenous) HDL-C method. HDL2-C concentrations were calculated with the subtraction of HDL3-C from total HDL-C. HDL3-C and total PON-1 activity were determined by using Eckerson method. Non-HDL3 PON-1 activitiy was calculated with subtraction of HDL3 PON-1 activity from total PON-1 activity. Results: Total HDL-C, HDL2-C and HDL3-C concentrations and the activity of total PON-1 and HDL3 PON-1 were found lower in obesity according to overweight and normal subjects (p < 0.001). Negative correlations were found between body mass index and HDL3-C, total PON-1 and HDL3 PON-1 (r = \u00c00.244, p < 0.005; r = \u00c00.247, p < 0.005; r = \u00c00.199, p < 0.05, respectively). Conclusion: Our findings indicated that HDL-C metabolism and lipoprotein associated antioxidant defense mechanisms were adversely affected with obesity. In conclusion we think that precipitation method using for separating HDL3 subgroup, is simple and cost effective for routine applications in clinical laboratories. Besides HDL3-C measurements, PON1 activity, measurement of total and HDL3-C subgroup might be helpful to evaluate the atherosclerotic process in obese subjects.

Its application has been supported by high structural similarity to human cystatin C as well as several common biological activities. As regard to biological activity, cystatins, including ovocystatin, are best characterized as inhibitors of cysteine proteases of papain family (C1), such as cathepsins B, H, L and S. These inhibitors participate in intra-and extracellular control of proteolytic events, both in physiological and pathological states. In the recent decade also new activities of cystatins, not assigned to inhibition of papain-like cysteine cathepsins, were found. These activities are associated with an alternative active center for legumain-type proteases in the molecule.

Materials and Methods: NBS results (n = 1863) were evaluated in dried blood samples which sent to our laboratory for the study between August 2014 and August 2015. Electrospray Ionisation (ESI)triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Shimadzu LC-MS/MS 8030,Japan) was used for NBS analysis,acylcarnitine and amino acid profile were screened with MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) spectrum within 2 minutes.Second-tier tests were performed as urine organic acid analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS),plasma and urine quantitative amino acid analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).Pathological NBS results were assessed in three separate groups as amino acid metabolism disorders, fatty acid oxidation defects and organic acidemias. Results: Metabolic diseases were found in 69 (3.70%) patients by the second-tier tests performed.There were detected amino acid metabolism disorders in 13,organic acidemia in 42,fatty acid oxidation defects in 14 patients. Conclusions: The reason of high positive results in our laboratory could explain that our study includes both screening and monitoring of previously diagnosed metabolic patients.NBS is performed in only a few centers in Turkey although there were the national screening programs included NBS in many foreign countries.More expanded NBS programmes in our country is required to start treatment of patients before irreversible damage is not occured.

Euthyroidism was defined as a normal level of TSH (range, 0.4 to 4.2 mIU/L), fT4 (range, 0.8 to 2.3 ng/dL) and fT3 (range, 2.3 to 4.2 ng/dL). Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevated serum TSH level associated with normal total or free T4 and T3 levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as low serum TSH levels associated with normal free T4 and free T3 levels. Results: Subclinical hyperthyroid group had significantly higher 25 (OH) vitamin D levels compared to the euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroid groups (p < 0.05). 25 (OH) vitamin D levels in subclinical hypothyroid group was not statistically significant when compared with the euthyroid group. Food processing wastes provide carbon sources in high amounts for fermentative microorganisms to produce energy. Converting carbon-rich biomass into bioethanol through fermentation by microorganisms both provides energy requirement for humankind and also decrease pollutant gases like CO 2 , NO x and SO x (Ghorbani et al., 2011) . Fermentation processes for bio-ethanol production could be achieved by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zymomonas mobilis, and Escherichia coli.",

The lignocellulosic wastes should be hydrolysed into fermentable sugars by using enzymes or dilute acids before microbial fermentation. Acidic hydrolysis methodology is cheaper than enzymatic hydrolysis but it can cause production of some inhibitors like aliphatic acids, which affect the growth of microorganisms. Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) is the first described prokaryotic hemoglobin. The recombinant strains carrying vgb gene (E. coli, P. aureginosa) which encodes VHb showed increased bacterial growth, productivity of metabolites compared to untransformant counterparts under low oxygen concentrations [Nasr et al., 2001; Geckil et al., 2004] . In this study, ethanologic E. coli strains FBR5, its derivative strains TS3 (vgb+) and TS4 (vgb+) were used. TS4 was constructed in such that it could express more VHb than TS3. Bioethanol production by these strains in presence of lignocellulosic hydrolysates derived inhibitors was investigated. Different acetic acid concentrations (2.5-10 mM) were used as inhibitors from lignocellulose hydrolysate. 10.0 mM acetic acid was used as an inhibitor. The growth of VHb expressing TS3 and TS4 strains was inhibited about 31% after 48 hours fermentation time. Strain FBR5 was inhibited as high as 76% by using the same inhibitor including growth medium. It was shown that the expression of VHb could improve growth and productivity in presence of lignocellulosic inhibitors. Differentiation of preadipocyte, also called adipogenesis, leads to the phenotype of mature adipocyte. However, excessive adipogenesis is closely linked to the development of obesity. Thus, any drug or chemical that can inhibit adipogenesis may have preventive and/or therapeutic potential against obesity and related diseases. AZD1208, an inhibitor of the family of Pim kinases, is known for anti-cancer activity. Here we investigated the effect of AZD1208 on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Notably, AZD1208 treatment led to a concentration-dependent inhibition of both lipid accumulation and triglyceride (TG) synthesis during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes with no cytotoxicity. On mechanistic levels, AZD1208 strongly reduced not only the expression levels of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-a (C/EBP-a), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c (PPAR-c), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and perilipin A but also the phosphorylation levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) during adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, AZD1208 largely decreased leptin, but not adiponectin, mRNA expressions during adipocyte differentiation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that AZD1208 inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and the inhibition is largely attributable to the reduced expression and/or phosphorylation levels of C/EBP-a, PPAR-c, FAS, perilipin A, and STAT-3.",

A mixture of nine food colours were given daily to FCG by oral gavage from preconception to birth. No adverse effect level (NOAEL) of artificial food colourings for each colouring was administered to FCG. Three months after the birth, 6 offspring from each group were selected randomly as control (CG) and experiment (EG) groups. Then they were sacrified under anesthesia. For performing the Alkaline comet comet assay leukocytes were seperated from whole blood samples. The alkaline comet assay was performed. The extent of DNA damage was assessed from the length of DNA migration derived by subtracting the diameter of the nucleus from the total length of the image and graded into 5 categories and these grades were converted into arbitrary unit (AU). Differences between the means of data were compared by Independent Samples T test. The results were given as the meanAESD, p values of less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Although the extent of DNA damage was higher in EG, the comparison of experiment (13.50 AE 1.76) and control (11.66 AE 1.36) groups showed no statistical difference (p = 0.072).",

Recent studies have found relationship between common glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene (NR3C1) polymorphisms and unipolar or bipolar depression. The NR3C1 gene is a candidate gene affecting depressive disorder risk and management. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relative distribution of specific polymorphisms of NR3C1 (Bcl1 and rs33388) in recurrent depressive disorder (rDD) patients. Methods: Our study included 100 volunteers with recurrent depressive disorder and 100 healthy individuals without any mental illness. Depression was assessed by Hamilton and MADRS depression scale. NR3C1 gene polymorphisms were detected by Real-Time PCR, with hybridization probe method. Allele and genotype frequencies at two loci (BclI and rs33388) were investigated in rDD patients and controls. Results: Genotype distribution among RDD patients and the control group for Bcl-1 (G/C) were as follows: CC 3% and 5%, GC 27% and 34%, GG 70% and 61%, respectively. There was not a significant difference when the frequency of the allele (p = 0.204) and genotype frequency (p = 0.382) were compared between the patients and the control. Genotype distribution in the rs33388region (A/T) of the patients and controls were TT 29% and 25%, TA 49% and 54%, AA 22% and 21%, respectively. Allele frequency (p = 0.841) and the genotype frequencies (p = 0.754) were not significantly different among the groups. Conclusion: Numerous NR3C1 gene polymorphisms were previously reported in association with modification of depressive disorders. The results of our study showed no association between GR genotype and recurrent depressive disorder. NR3C1 polymorphism does not play a role in the development of recurrent depressive disorder.

It is the fourth most important cereal crop after wheat, maize and rice and is among the top ten crop plants in the world. Talbina was used to be recommended for the sick and for one who is grieving over a dead person. Talbina is made by adding one or two tablespoon of barley flour (must be 100 percent wholegrain barley flour) to one-and-a-half cups of water and placed on low heat for 10-15 minutes (optional: add milk or yoghurt and sweeten with honey). The main objectives of this investigation were determine the a-tocopherol contents and antimutagenicity activity of Talbina (Hordeum vulgare L.). Our results showed that the total tocopherol content was in the range of 0.25 to 1.03 lmol/g FW. Talbina extract was shown to have greater antimutagenic activity observed in the 2500 lg/plate concentration S. typhimurium TA98.

The rate of biomass accumulation in all ecotypes decreased in the following order from inorganic phosphate to ATP to phytate. Lateral root formation was markedly reduced in the absence of any phosphorus source or in the presence of phytate. We also showed that phosphomonoesterase activity in intact roots increased when plants were grown on ATP and phytate. Overall phosphorus content in leaves and roots was similar when plants were grown on ATP or inorganic phosphate, but it was markedly reduced on phytate. Substantial differences between ecotypes were also observed in root length, P content in ash and phosphomonoesterase activity in intact roots. Our analysis of the ability of Arabidopsis ecotypes to grow on several different phosphorus sources provides a unique opportunity to investigate the degree of natural variation in this plant's ability to adapt to different nutritional environments. Analysis of many important morphological and physiological changes observed in these plants can further extend our understanding of the full range of plant responses to phosphorus availability.

Hereby, we aimed to investigate the effects of seasonal climate changes on urine density of children living in Mediterranean climate, Cyprus. 1700 healthy 0-18 year children's (850 girls, 850 boys) age, sex and urine density results were collected retrospectively for three consecutive years. The correlation of urine density with each seasonal and 12 months' average temperature and humidity has been analysed. The urine density results had a positive correlation with temperature (r = 0.083, p = 0.001) and a negative correlation with humidity (r= \u00c00.072, p = 0.003). Mean urine density in spring was higher than that of autumn (p = 0.02) and winter (p = 0.00). Mean value of summer was higher than autumn (p = 0.03) and winter (p = 0.00). 0-24 months age group had lower urine density. Evaluation of urine density based on gender and puberty revealed no statistically significant difference. Seasonal Mediterranean climate changes have an impact on urine density in children which may affect hydration status especially in infants < 2 yrs of age.

In the current study, we aimed to investigate the possible effect of two different mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) inhibitors in rats subjected to isoproterenol (ISO)induced myocardial injury. Materials and Methods: A total of 32 male Wistar-Albino rats were equally and randomly seperated into four groups as follows: Control, ISO, ISO plus SB203580 andISO plus TAK-715. Treatment agents were orally administered and myocardial injury was induced by subcutaneous injection of ISO. Serum cardiac troponin-I (cTnI), ischemia modified albumin (IMA), heart fatty acid binding protein (HFABP) levels and paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) activity, tissue TOS (total oxidant status), TAS (total antioxidant status), TT (total thiol), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity levels were measured. Tissue mRNA levels of NF-jB, p38 MAPK and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were analyzed. Heart tissues were also immunohistochemically and histopathologically evaluated. Results: Both compounds have led to a decrement in myocardial damage, apoptosis, cTnI, IMA, HFABP, TOS, and TNF-a levels, NF-jB, p38 MAPK, phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (pJNK 1/2) expressions. On the other hand, the applied treatment increased SOD, GSH-Px, TAS and TT levels, as well as phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK 1/2) and Nrf2 expressions. Conclusion: Data established from the current study suggest that administered agents have protective effect against cardiac injury induced by ISO, which was more prominent in rats received SB203580 treatment. p38MAPK inhibitors may constitute a useful choice as cardioprotective agents due to their antiinflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects.

It was determined that A.lamprocarpa var. chelikhii which is one of the two different varieties of A. lamprocarpa is actually a new sub-species. This fact was supported by molecular data obtained from the study we made after morphologic data. Introduction: Excessive production of androstenedione can becaused by defects of adrenal steroid biosynthesis, tumors of ovarian and adrenal origin, polycystic ovarian syndrome, increased peripheral sensitivity to androgens, and increased peripheral production of androgens. Most epidemiologic studies use enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay (ELISA) to measure sex steroid hormones because they have acceptable turnaround times and arerelatively inexpensive. Mass spectrometry-based methods are currently the most specific quantitative analytical methods for steroid determination. Mass spectrometry methods are independent of matrix effects or cross-reactivity. In this study, a new liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed. Materials and Methods: For serum androstenedione measurement, 50 lL of internal standard (d5-11 deoxycortizol) in methanol was added to 250 lL standart or serum and centrifuged at 4.500 rpm for 10 minutes to remove the precipitated proteins. Supernatant was transferred to clean tubes and this procedure was performed twice. The supernatant was collected and dried under a nitrogen gas flow at 60 \u2022 C and dissolved in mobile phase. 60 lL was injected in to the ultra performance liquid chromatography analytical column for chromatography.",

The regressione quation was ELISA= \u00c02.861782 + 4.905103 LC-MS/MS. Discussion and Conclusion: Method comparison study presented higher results in ELISA compared to LC-MS/MS. In our opinion, this might due to the interference in ELISA systems. Our LC-MS/MS method allows rapid, sensitive and specific determination of androgens in plasma and serum.The specificity of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/ MS) offers advantages over immunoassays. Heparins play an important role in cell growth, differentiation, migration and invasion. However, the molecular mechanisms of heparin mediated cellular behaviors are not well defined. To determine the effect of heparin on gene expression, we performed a cDNA microarray in a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line and found that heparin regulates transcription of genes involved in glucose metabolism. In this study, we showed a new role of heparin in the regulation of thioredoxin interacting protein, which is a major regulator of glucose metabolism, in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. We determined the importance of a unique carbohydrate response element located on its promoter for the heparin-induced activation of thioredoxin-interacting protein and the modulatory role of heparin on nuclear accumulation of carbohydrate response element associated proteins. We showed the importance of heparin mediated histone modifications and downregulation of Enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 expression for heparin mediated overexpression of thioredoxininteracting protein. When we tested biological significance of these data; we observed that cells overexpressing thioredoxininteracting protein are less adhesive and proliferative, however they have a higher migration and invasion ability. Interestingly, heparin treatment increased thioredoxin-interacting protein expression in liver of diabetic rats. In conclusion, our results show that heparin activates thioredoxin-interacting protein expression in liver and hepatocellular carcinoma cells and provide the first evidences of regulatory roles of heparin on carbohydrate response element associated factors. This study will contribute future understanding of the effect of heparin on glucose metabolism and glucose independent overexpression of thioredoxin-interacting protein during hepatocarcinogenesis.",

Y\u20ac ucel 1 1 Ankara Training and Research Hospital, Medical Biochemistry Department, Ankara, Turkey, 2 Ankara Training and Research Hospital, Chest Diseases Department, Ankara, Turkey Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a consequence of an underlying chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that is usually progressive and causes dysregulation in the metabolism of collagen. And Asthma is a disease where there is an accumulation of collagen in the reticular basal membrane of the airway leading to chronic inflammation. Prolidase has an important role in the recycling of proline for collagen synthesis and cell growth. We measured and compared prolidase activity in healthy individuals with COPD and asthma patients to find out that whether its activity might reflect disturbances of collagen metabolism in the patients.",

Due to key role in the purine sulvage pathway PNPs are attractive targets for drug design against some pathogens. They also used widely in biotechnology for the synthesis of nucleoside analogues as well as for the activation of the prodrugs in anti-cancer gene therapies. The acyclovir (ACV), acyclic derivative of guanosine, is antiviral drug for the treatment of some human viral infections. The crystalline complex of E. coli PNP with acyclovir was prepared by co-crystallization using counter diffusion in capillary through the gel layer. The set of X-ray data at 100 K from single crystal grown in space (sp. group P6 1 22) was collected on the Spring-8 synchrotron-radiation facility (Japan) and the structure was solved at 2.32 A resolution, using the molecular replacement method (pdb ID 5i3c). ACV molecule was located in the nucleoside binding pocket of the enzyme in two conformations. The phosphate binding site was occupied by SO4 ion. The hydrogen bonds network and hydrophobic interactions stabilising ACV molecule in the active site as well as the conformational changes upon ligand binding were described. The comparison of E. coli PNP/acyclovir complex and the similar complexes of Bacillus subtilis PNP (pdb ID 4da7) and human PNP (pdb ID 1pwy) allowed to establish the peculiarities of ACV binding of in the E. coli enzyme. Gonadotropins are glycoprotein hormones that regulate normal growth, sexual development, and reproductive function. These are large, up to 40 kDa proteins, which are synthesized and secreted by the gonadotropic cells of the anterior pituitary gland. These hormones may vary in the level of glycosylation depending on the tissue and the metabolism cycles. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and upon binding to FSH receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), regulates the development, growth, pubertal maturation, and reproductive processes of the body. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and luteinizing hormone (LH) act via a shared GPCR (LH receptor) and regulate mechanisms essential for ovulation, early pregnancy and placental function in females as well as spermatogenesis and testosterone production in males.",

It is commonly used to predict ovarian reserve and outcomes of fertility treatments. Recently, low levels of AMH have been shown to be related to hypertensive diseases of the pregnancy and the risk of preterm labor. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of AMH levels of mothers to predict poor neonatal outcome in term pregnancies and the relationship between AMH and birthweights of the newborns. Materials and Methods: 187 patients, having delivery beyond 37 weeks, and who did not have any other medical problems were included in the study. The patients had normal 50 g. oral glucose tolerance test results. They were divided as 3 groups, based on their newborns' birthweight as \"2500 g. and 4000 g.\". Level of AMH was determined by ELISA method. Results: There was not any relation with the AMH of the mothers and the poor neonatal outcome of the newborns, in all 3 groups. Also no siginificant difference was observed in AMH levels of the patients having delivery in early term and late term periods. When the patients of the same group were evaluated; AMH levels were irrelevant to age, gravidy, delivery week, body mass index, the weight gain during pregnancy, and poor neonatal outcome. Conclusion: AMH is not a predictive factor for poor neonatal outcome and it is not a determinant of the weight of the newborn. Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of differing amounts of hemolysis on serum high sensitvity troponin I (hs-TnI), CK-MB mass and myoglobin measurements. Materials and Methods: We prepared serum pools having troponin I, CK-MB and myoglobulin concentrations at low (5.33 ng/l,1.5 ng/ml and 34.3 ng/ml respectively), normal (39.25 ng/l, 3 ng/ml, 197.9 ng/l respectively) and high (7345 ng/l, 22 ng/ml, 574 g/ml respectively) values. The osmotic shock method was utilized to prepare a hemolysate. Hemolysate was added into serum pools increasing concentrations of hemoglobin (0.65, 1.3, 2.5, 5, 7.26 and 9 .42 g/l hemoglobin). Troponin I, CK-MB (mass) and myoglobin concentrations were measured in duplicate by Beckman Coulter Access 2 analyzer. The hemolysis indices were measured on Beckman Coulter AU 5800. A change of 10% from baseline results was taken as evidence of interference and the interfered tests were also evaluated according to total analytical error based on analytical imprecision and intraindividual biological variation. Results: We found a positive interference due to hemolysis for CK-MB (mass) at low concentrations (1.5 ng/ml), and a negative interference for myoglobin at low concentrations (34.3 ng/ml) and high concentrations (574 ng/ml). Conclusions: CK-MB increase and myoglobin decrease in hemolyzed samples with hemoglobin \u22659.42 g/l, but the bias might not be clinically significant (< total analytical error) in samples.",

Biopcy model of wound healing was created in the rat testis and ovary with PPD syringe where stem cells were delivered by injection. Rats were divided into four groups including controls, sham, wound healing and wound healing with stem cell. After the creation of the wound, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells from the tibia of the mature rats and medium were administered to ovaries and testes.

Tissues were analysed for these staining by H-score and H-score results were determined using One-Way ANOVA test statistically. Our results show the positive effects which clinic applications can bring by displaying the great contribution of the stem cell application in the treatment of testicle and ovary damage.

Here we report the effect of 2 (5H)-furanone derivative possessing sulfonyl group and l-menthol moiety (F105) on biofilms formed by S. aureus ATCC29213 and MRSA cells. While exhibiting relatively high minimal inhibiting concentration -MIC (16 mg/l), clear synergy with a number of antibiotics was found in the checkerboard assay. Thus, in the presence of 2 mg/l of F105 the MIC of kanamycin was decreased 4-fold, and the MICs of both erythromycin and ampicillin were lowered 2-fold. At the concentration of 80 mg/l F105 also completely inhibited the biofilm formation by S. aureus; the cell growth was suppressed by two orders of magnitude as judged by differential fluorescent staining with Syto9 and propidium iodide. The addition of F105 to preformed 24 h-old biofilms increased the fraction of red-stained (dead) cells of both S. aureus ATCC29213 and MRSA strains uniformly throughout the whole profile of the biofilm. The quantitative analysis of CLSM microphotographs revealed that F105 at concentration of 80 mg/l led to death of up to 98% of biofilm-embedded cells. This fact suggests that F105 efficiently penetrates into the biofilm matrix and kills the cells without visible damage of biofilm structure. In summary, furanone F105 seems to be a promising compound for drugs design to treat biofilm-embedded S. aureus.",

The aim of this study was to compare CRP and PCT levels in young and elderly patients with pneumonia. Recently diagnosed 43 young and 46 elderly patients with pneumonia and their respective aged matched controls (n = 41, n = 42) were enrolled this study. CRP and PCT levels were by immunoturbidometric and by ELISA methods respectively. CRP and PCT levels for young control and patients and elderly control and patients respectively are 2.32 AE 2.25 mg/l, 0.26 AE 0.13 ng/ml, 20.71 AE 34.61 mg/l, 0.64 AE 1.09 ng/ml, 2.32 AE 2.14 mg/l, 0.27 AE 0.07 ng/ml and 31.41 AE 31.0 mg/l, 0.49 AE 0.83 ng/ml. Young patients with pneumonia have significantly higher CRP and PCT levels than their controls (p < 0.001 and p < 0.028). Elderly patients with pneumonia have significantly higher CRP levels than their controls (p < 0.001). CRP and PCT are important markers in the diagnosis of pneumonia.",

Materials and Methods: A serum pool with low albumin (3.10 g/dL) and normal calcium (9.79 mg/dL) concentrations was prepared from leftover sera. From this serum pool, two parts, each of 10 ml were aliquoted. Purified albumin, 0.3 g, was added to one of these pools and albumin concentration was determined as 6.1 g/dL. The low and high albumin pools were mixed at different ratios and pools with 3.89, 4.78, and 5.37 g/dL albumin concentrations. Total calcium and albumin concentrations of these 5 pools were measured at a Beckman-Coulter AU5800 analyzer and ionized calcium was measured at a Radiometer ABL 800 blood gas analyzer in triplicate. Total and ionized calcium concentrations were evaluated as compared to those of the original pool with an albumin concentration of 3.10 g/dL. Results: Total calcium concentrations are increased with the increasing albumin concentrations: 1.2%, 1.58%, 2.85%, and 3.59%, respectively. Whereas, ionized calcium concentrations were decreased with increasing albumin: 3.0%, 6.1%, 7.4%, and 8.6%, respectively. Conclusions: When total allowable error limits based on biological variation were considered, total calcium concentrations are significantly increased at >5 g/dL albumin concentrations. Ionized calcium is significantly affected by 0.8 g/dL and over albumin concentrations. A regression equation based on albumin concentration may be useful for corrected ionized calcium concentrations.",

This study aimed to investigate antioxidant, cytotoxic, genotoxic and apoptotic effect of methanol extracts of AR activities on the human colon (DLD-1) and endometrium (ECC-1) adenocarcinoma cell line. Total phenolic, flavonoid content, and antioxidant activities were determined using suitable methods (ABTS, CUPRAC i.e). Cytotoxic effects of AR on cells were determined by MTT and neutral red uptake assays. Genotoxicity was evaluated by Comet assay and, apoptosis induction were detected by apoptosis ELISA and acridine orange staining methods at the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) levels. It was determined that extract have shown antioxidant activity in all tests and that they could be considered as a source of natural antioxidants. Cytotoxic effects were concentration-time dependent. Specifically, apoptotic and genotoxic effect increased at 100 and 200 lg/ml concentrations by 48 hours. We found that AR extract had antiproliferative, genotoxic and apoptotic effects on the human cancer cell lines DLD-1 and ECC-1.

The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction of nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 ) or nanoparticles fused with different antibiotics with cell membranes in order to reveal changes in the membrane organization. Endothelial cells were used to determine the effect of different antibiotics (gentamicin, kanamycin, amikacin, penicillin, polymyxin, neomycin, cefotaxime, bacitracin, moxicillin, erythromycin, streptomycin and vancomycin) on the membrane organization. For recording the anisotropy of cell suspensions treated with antibiotics or nanoparticles fused with antibiotics we used 1-4-trimethyl-6-phenyl 1, 3, 5 hexatrien p-toluenesulfonate (TMA-DPH). We decided to use nanoparticles fused with antibiotics because they contain small amounts of antibiotics which makes them less toxic than simple antibiotics,which is very important in patients with genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, that should be treated with antibiotics for a long time. Our results showed that at temperatures between 31 and 35\u00b0C simple nanoparticles decreased the membrane fluidity. At physiological temperatures (37-39\u00b0C) nanoparticles fused with antibiotics (gentamicin, vancomicin, cefotaxim, bacitracin, amoxicillin) increase more the membrane rigidity compare with simple antibiotics or nanoparticles.Erythromycin, polymyxin and penicillin increase the membrane rigidity at 37\u00b0C, and at 39\u00b0C the same effect was obtained in the presence of nanoparticles fused with these antibiotics,suggesting that the nanoparticles are dependent to temperature for penetrating the membrane. In conclusion the membrane fluidity does not depend on antibiotics types, the modification are present in many antibiotics irrespective of class type.The presence of nanoparticles fused with antibiotics is very important for long term treatment.

Moreover, in the absence of this enzyme we have observed a decrease in the amount of the 70S ribosomal subunit, concomitantly with the increase of 30S and 50S subunits. RNase R seems also to modulate the amount of the elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G transcripts. Nevertheless, preliminary results further suggest other roles of RNase R in translation. Modified nucleotides are present in many RNA species in all Domains of Life. The biosynthetic pathways of such nucleotides are well studied. However, much less is known about the degradation of RNAs and the salvage of modified nucleotides, their respective nucleosides or heterocyclic bases. Using an E. coli uracil auxotrophic strain, we screened the metagenomic libraries for genes, which would allow the conversion of 2-thiouracil to uracil and thereby lead to the growth on a defined synthetic medium. We show that a novel gene encoding previously uncharacterized Domain of Unknown Function (DUF) is responsible for such phenotype. We have purified this recombinant protein and demonstrated that it contains a Fe-S cluster. The substitution of cysteines, which have been predicted to bind such clusters, with alanines abolished the growth phenotype. We conclude that this domain is required for conversion of 2-thiouracil into uracil in vivo. This work is supported by the Research Council of Lithuania (LMT, MIP-103/2015 Modified nucleotides are present in almost all classes of RNA. They have great chemical diversity and are critical for RNA folding, stability, interaction with cellular proteins and thereby for various cellular processes such as translation, stress response, and signaling pathways. Biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides and their modified derivatives in RNA is well studied. Nonetheless, not much is known about the cellular degradation of these compounds and the enzymes catalyzing such processes. Using an E. coli uracil auxotrophic strain, we screened metagenomic libraries for genes encoding isocytosine deaminases. Three novel genes were obtained, one of which encodes a protein similar to 8oxoguanine deaminases. The other two encode proteins resembling hydroxydechloroatrazine ethylaminohydrolases. We confirmed that these proteins are functional in vivo, allowing growth of E.coli on minimal medium with isocytosine. We also demonstrated that such purified recombinant enzymes catalyze the conversion of isocytosine, but not cytosine, into uracil in vitro.

Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs are polyadenylated by a complex machinery that recognizes the poly (A) signal, cleaves the mRNA and adds the poly (A) tail. 70% of human genes harbor multiple poly (A) signals. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) generates transcript isoforms with different 3 0 UTR (untranslated region) lengths due to the use of proximal or distal poly (A) signals. Hence, tightly regulated APA has been observed in normal physiological settings as well as in diseases.

In this study, we aimed to detect the changes of global gene expression after spinal cord contusion in rats according to the time sequence. The spinal cord tissues at contusion site were sequenced after spinal cord contusion in rats using RNA-sequencing technology. For time sequence analysis, five time points was determined; 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 3 months after spinal cord contusion, and sham operated rats at each time point were used as controls. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was also performed to validate expression changes of candidate genes in each category. We found that the pattern of changes in gene expression at acute and subacute stages was quite different from that at chronic stage, especially genes associated with with neurotrophin signaling and apoptosis pathways. Most of gene expression levels of inflammatory cell markers were increased and peak during acute stage (1 hour to 1 week) and maintained until chronic stage. Some of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs) including brain derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell derived neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor were increased at 1 hour or 1 day after SCI.

Stefl Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic RNA polymerase II has evolved an array of heptad repeats with the consensus sequence Y1-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S7 at the C-terminal domain (CTD) of its largest subunit, Rpb1. Phosphorylation of serines (S2, S5, and S7) and tyrosine-1 orchestrate the binding of RNA processing and transcription factors in the site of transcription. Several recent studies showed that also threonine-4 site can be phosphorylated which has a number of functional consequences. To reveal the structural basis for the recognition of threonine-4 phosphorylated CTD, we set out to investigate several proteins factors that were implicated with a high levels of threonine-4 CTD phosphomarks using integrative structural biology. One of them, a factor involved in the 3 0 -end processing and transcription termination, showed a high affinity to the phosphothreonine CTD. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), we determined its structure bound to the CTD phosphorylated at threonine-4 that reveals a direct read-out of the phosphothreonine. Altogether, our data provides the first insights into the recognition of this poorly understood CTD mark that plays important role in the CTD code of RNA polymerase II.

Anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin (IND) mainly acting through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) has also anti-cancer activity including brain tumors. The aim was to investigate how IND effects an immortality enzyme telomerases' activity. Materials and Methods: Monolayer and spheroid cultures of T98G human GBM cell line were used to evaluate the effects of IND (100 lM) on cell proliferation, viability, apoptosis, cell cycle, cAMP levels, the levels of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins, morphology (SEM) and ultrastructure (TEM) for 72 hours. Results were analyzed using the Student's t-test. Results: IND decreased cell proliferation (p72 < 0.01), cell viability (p72 < 0.000001), cell rate at S phase (p72 < 0.000001) and G2 + M phase (p72 < 0.001), cAMP levels (p72 < 0.01), the levels of PDGFR-a (p72 < 0.001), MRP-1 (p72 < 0.05), nf-jB (p72 < 0.01) and COX-2 (p72 < 0.01) in comparison to control group. IND mildly increased apoptosis (p72 < 0.001) and caspase-3 levels (p72 < 0.01). Interestingly, IND increased hTERT levels (142%, p24 < 0.001; 154%, p72 < 0.0001). SEM evaluation showed that IND led to decreased and shortened microvilli, the lost of cell interactions and the conversion of many cell shapes from spindle to oval. Many cell remnants in the intercellular area, intact cell membranes, many dense lipid droplets and few autophagic vacuols in the cytoplasm were observed under TEM. Discussion and Conclusions: The effect of IND on telomerase activity can only be found in 8 publications at Pubmed research that they only showed its' inhibitory effect in colon, gastric, head and neck cancers. In contrast to previous studies, it was shown for the first time that IND increased telomerase activity in GBM cells and this increase was independent from COX-2 and other tested factors.

Human interferon gamma (hIFNc) is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in the regulation of nearly all phases of immune and inflammatory responses. Its abnormal expression is associated with the aetiology of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Recently we have been exploring the idea to counteract the over-expression of the endogenous hIFNc by competitive inhibition with inactive hIFNc mutants.

Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress-inducible protein and widely expressed in mammalian tissues. It has been identified as a secretory protein that protects cells against ER stress-induced damage. ER-stress is one of the main mechanisms that play a role in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced renal injury. Recent studies demonstrated that MANF can protect cardiac myocytes and cortical neurons against I/R-induced injury.

Glycosylation is not essential for hIFNc activity but is important for its stability, half-life and protease resistance in blood. The commonly used hIFNc in therapy and research is produced in E. coli and therefore is not glycosylated. Bearing in mind the above mentioned shortcomings of the non-glycosylated hIFNc we expressed it in mammalian cells and transgenic mice, however very low yields were achieved. To obtain glycosylated hIFNc, here we employed a secretory expression of N-terminal HIS-FLAG fusion protein in baculovirus-infected insect High Five \u00d2 cells. This small hydrophilic tag is designed to not affect the proper folding of the target protein and to facilitate the detection and purification procedures. In parallel the same fusion was expressed in E. coli cells. The fusion proteins were purified to high degree of purity by affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Bioassay carried out on WISH cells showed that the antiproliferative activity of both fusion proteins was 500 times lower than that of the native hIFNc. This result shows that, in contrast to the generally hold view, the N-terminal HIS-FLAG tag interferes with the biological activity of hIFNc despite of the protein glycosylation. In order to restore the biological activity we attempted to remove the HIS-FLAG tag enzymatically. Surprisingly, we found that the fusion protein obtained from insect cells was resistant to enterokinase, independently of the enzyme source and experimental conditions, whereas the protein isolated from E. coli was susceptible and the tag-free protein showed fully restored biological activity. We are prone to explain the enterokinase resistance of the fusion protein from insect cells with either the specific conformation of the glycosylated protein or with the interaction of the carbohydrate residues with the enzymatic activity of the enterokinase.

It has been recently shown that irisin immunoreactivity was altered in gastrointestinal cancers. As known hematological malignancies was one of the most common malignancies through world, but no study was present how irisin was changed in this type of cancers. Therefore, purpose of this was to investigate how immunoreactivity to irisin was altered in hematological malignancies (blood cancers). We used an antibody from Phoenix to demonstrate how a 12 kDa band after deglycosylation of irisin altered in hematological malignancies. Here we first time showed that irisin tissue immunoreactivity from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients was increased when compared with unaffected biological tissue parts. From the immune-histochemical (IHC) investigations it is concluded that hematological tissue and blood cells may be another source of irisin and increased with cancer, thus this finding might help to enlighten pathophysiology of hematological malignancies.",

Serdarevic Clinical Centre, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina Introduction: Renal dysfunction is very common in heart failure (HF) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is used as an early marker of acute renal tubular injury. Recent studies have been reporting that NGAL is inhibitor of inactivation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9) which results in enhanced proteolytic activity with prolonged effects on collagen degradation. Due to its relation to extracellular matrix degradation in myocardium and infammation, we hypothesized possible increased NGAL expression in HF besides it renal dysfunction etiology. Patients and methods: In study were included 30 patients hospitalised with signs and symtoms of AHF. Urine samples for NGAL analysis were collected at admission and analysed by the chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in human urine (Abbott, ARCHITECT Analyzer). Refferent range for urine NGAL is 0-135 ng/ml. On admission blood samples for BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) analysis were drawn and tested by ARCHITECT BNP chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA), Abbott Laboratory. Results: The mean age of the patients (male= 30, female= 30) was 68.86 years (SD 10.92 years). Among them 18 (30%) patients was diagnosed as a HF-PEF (HF with preserved ejection fraction) while 42 (70%) as a HF-REF (HF with reduced ejection fraction). Mean BNP values was 1616.71 pg/ml (SD 1511.15 pg/ml) and mean LVEF was 33.66% (SD 14.19%). Mean urine NGAL was 60.91 ng/ml (SD 78.72 ng/ml). We found significantly positive, but weak correlation among NGAL and BNP only by Pearson correlation test (r = 0.139, p = 0.464, Wilcoxon signed rank test Z = \u00c04.782 p < 0.5). Conclusion: BNP levels are elevated in HF with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. Urine NGAL is not elevated in acute heart failure, but it is slightly positively correlated with serum BNP values. Converging evidence implicates the intermediate and medial mesopallium (IMM) of the domestic chick forebrain in memory for a visual imprinting stimulus. A number of learning-related changes have been found in plasma membrane and mitochondrial proteins of IMM. For broader analysis of these changes we employed Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis/mass spectrometry approach and identified differentially expressed proteins in membrane-mitochondrial fraction of the IMM across chicks with different estimated levels of imprinting 24 h after training. We further inquired whether the amounts of those proteins in the IMM and a control region (posterior pole of the nidopallium, PPN) are correlated with memory for the imprinting stimulus.",

Until now, FOXP1 (Forkhead Box P1) has been identified as a tumor suppressor in several correlation studies in breast cancer. Although, FOXP1 is defined as a transcriptional repressor that interacts with other transcription factors in various mechanistic studies, there is no study that explains its repressor functions in breast cancer biology. Here we demonstrate the repressor function of FOXP1 on NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells) and the migratory effect of this repression in MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments for the investigation of protein-protein interaction between two transcription factors. Protein-protein interaction on DNA was investigated with EMSA and transcriptional effects of FOXP1 on NFAT, lusiferase reporter assay was performed. Wound healing assay was used to analyse the effects of overexpression of FOXP1 on tumor cell migration. Our results showed that FOXP1 has protein-protein interaction with NFAT on DNA and enhances breast cancer cell migration by repressing NFAT transcriptional activity and FOXP1 shows oncogenic function by regulating breast cancer cell motility. Introduction: Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) is one of Phosphodiesterase lead to hydrolyzing cGMP.The cGMP signaling pathway has an important role in proliferation of cells. Previous studies showed PDE5 was increased in cell lines cancers thus PDE5 inhibitors can used as efficacious therapeutic option for treatment of cancers. The current study was to investigation the effect of hydroalcoholic Achillea.Wilhelmsii extract (HAWE) on the PDE5 gene expression and cGMP signaling in the MCF-7 ER + and MDA-MB-468 ER \u00c0 . Methods and Materials: The ED50 of the HAWE on both cell lines were examined by using MTT viability test then the expression of PDE5 and cGMP concentration were measured in timedependent manner (in the ED50) by real-time RT-PCR and colorimetric assay respectively. Results: Treatment with the HAWE showed, 25 lg/ml is ED50 for both cell lines and the HAWE lead to reduction in PDE5 mRNA expression and evaluation of intracellular cGMP showed an increase pattern in the time-dependent manner. Conclusion: Our results showed that the HAWE has anti-proliferative property in the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468, cell lines of breast cancer through the cGMP pathway, these data suggested that the HAWE can be potential source for the isolation of effective anti-proliferative molecules.

Outer membrane protein G (OmpG) is a stable monomeric porin having 14-stranded beta barrel form from E.coli. Its exact function is not fully understood; however, it allows the passage of molecules up to 900 Da in neutral pH but the pore is closed by going through a conformational change under pH 5.5. As being monomeric and having pH-dependent gating characters, it is suitable for biosensor and targeted drug delivery applications.",

NAD is a key factor in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism. Besides its vital role as redox carrier, NAD serves as substrate for protein ADP-ribosylation and deacetylation, modifications which modulate enzyme activities in mitochondria. These functions depend on how NAD levels are maintained in this organelle. In human cells, mitochondrial NAD is segregated from the cytosolic pool and can be synthesized from NMN, which is probably imported into the matrix. Here, we tested whether the Nudix pyrophosphatase NUDT13 participates in the regulation of the mitochondrial NAD pool. This enzyme has a predicted NADH pyrophosphatase zinc ribbon domain and a mitochondrial targeting sequence at its N-terminus. However, it has not yet been functionally characterized.",

The orthologs of the two latter proteins are commonly found in mitochondria. However, mitochondrial IF3 could not been identified in several groups of organisms, including S.cerevisiae, for a long time. Recently we have shown that baker's yeast protein Aim23p possesses a function of mtIF3. However, the mitochondrial translation has not been stopped in the yeast strain without Aim23p which is surprising taking into account the fact that IF3 is obligatory for the translation in bacterial systems. Instead of blocking of mitochondrial protein synthesis in absence of Aim23p, we observed the translational imbalance: the synthesis rate of the complex V subunits was increased while the synthesis rate of the complex IV subunits was repressed. Thus, in addition to its general role in translation initiation, Aim23p might specifically affect the biosynthesis of individual mitochondrial-encoded protein species. Our genetic experiments have revealed that, indeed, Aim23p is almost indispensable for Cox1p synthesis, and that it affects the translation of COX1 mRNA through its 5 0 -UTR, like classical mitochondrial translational activators. This is in accordance with our measurements of complex IV activity which is several times less in yeast lacking AIM23 gene than in the wild-type. Taken together, our results point on the multiple role of Aim23p in mitochondrial translation: in addition to its function as mitochondrial IF3, it specifically regulates the amount of complex IV subunits and its activity.

Insulin resistance (IR) and obesity are common findings in patients with PCOS. Irisin is a recently identified myokine secreted from skeletal muscle in response to physical activity. Irisin has been postulated to induce the differentiation of white fat tissue into brown fat tissue. Betatrophin is a currently discovered new hormone proposed to stimulate b-cell proliferation. In this study we investigated the levels of irisin and betatrophin in PCOS patients. Materials and Methods: Our study group was consisted of 40 patients with PCOS and 20 healthy volunteers. Patients group was divided into two subgroups according to presence of IR. (PCOS+IR and PCOS-IR). The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) were performed to assess glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Irisin and betatrophin levels were measured by ELISA method. Results: Circulating irisin was significantly higher in the PCO-S+IR subgroup than the control group (p < 0.022). Circulating betatrophin was significantly lower in both patients subgroups than the control group (p < 0.008). There was no negative or positive correlation between irisin and betatrophin levels. Discussion: These data suggest that irisin and betatrophin may act a role together in the IR mechanism in PCOS patients. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) synthesized in liver has long been associated with hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes and obesity. There are also reports on BChE knockout mice becoming obese. The exact involvement of how BChE interacts with lipids is still not clear. Previously we displayed a correlation between leptin, waist circumference, fat mass and BChE levels. Recently, we have also shown that BChE overexpression in HepG2 cells is regulated by alpha linoleic acid.

However, these studies were performed on one particular erv1 mutant strain (erv1-1) that we discovered has additional defects in glutathione (GSH) metabolism.

We determined that the cause of GSH depletion in the erv1-1 strain is an additional mutation in the gene encoding the glutathione biosynthesis enzyme (Gsh1) that compromises Gsh1 protein folding and/or stability. To address whether GSH deficiency in the erv1-1 mutant is the underlying cause for the cytosolic Fe-S cluster defects and iron misregulation for this strain, we measured Fe-S protein activity, iron-regulated gene expression, and iron accumulation in erv1 and mia40 mutant strains.

Recently, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome human coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was found in patients with severe acute respiratory tract infections in the Middle East and South Korea. As is true for all coronavirus infections, there are no efficacious therapies currently available against coronaviral diseases, making the development of anti-coronavirus compounds a priority. The CoV genome consists of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA approximately 30 kb, and it contains several genes encoding several structural and non-structural proteins that are required for progeny virion production with a conserved order. The N proteins exist in the center of the viral particle and represent a helical structure complex. Nucleocapsid protein is most abundant structural protein of CoVs, binds the viral RNA genome to form the virion core, leading to the formation of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex or to a long helical nucleocapsid structure, that is important for maintaining the RNA in an ordered conformation for replication and transcription. The CoV N protein is also involved in the regulation of cellular processes, such as gene transcription, interferon inhibition, actin reorganization, host cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Two strategies to inhibit oligomeric N protein function have been reported. The first strategy is to discover antiviral agents that target the RNA-binding site. The second one is to impair normal N protein function by interfering with monomer-oligomer equilibrium. Our recent studies suggest that N proteins in infections caused by coronaviruses will be useful antiviral drug targets because they serve many critical functions during the viral life cycle.",

However, insufficient vascularization during bone regeneration, particularly with large bone defects, results in poor and unsustainable bone formation due to central necrosis. Therefore, vascularization following implantation in vivo is essential to the successful formation of new bone tissue. We evaluated the release profile of VEGF from BGs using a novel fluorescence-based retention assay, which revealed that VEGF loaded on BGs can be released in a sustained manner without an initial burst (near zero-order cumulative release) with a controlled release rate of 13.6% per week for up to 7 weeks. In contrast, an ELISA-based release assay showed VEGF to have an early burst-release profile for the first week. However, the biological activity of VEGF released from the BGs was preserved over the 7-week release period, which is consistent with the sustainedrelease profile observed in the fluorescence-based retention assay. We developed a novel fluorescence-based retention assay to evaluate the release of VEGF from BGs. This fluorescence-based retention assay, which detects the VEGF that remains on BGs, reveals that VEGF loaded on BGs can be released in a sustained manner, with a minimal initial burst, for up to 7 weeks. These results indicate that the sustained biological activity of the VEGF released from BGs over the full 7-week period promotes bone regeneration, and suggest its potential use for bone tissue engineering.

San Mart \u0131n Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile Introduction: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading a cause of end-stage renal failure whose pathogenesis must to be elucidated. The progression of DN has been associated with elevated levels of adenosine. Extracellular adenosine availability is regulated by the activity of the equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs). Due to the ENTs have putative sites of phosphorylation our objective was to evaluate the role of PKA and CK2 kinases on ENTs activity. Methods: Adenosine uptake (10 lM adenosine, 60s, 22\u00b0C) was assayed in HK2 cells preincubated with 5 mM or 25 mM D-glucose for 24 h and exposed to 10 lM 8-Br cAMP, 10 lMH89 or 100lM TBB for 1 h. Plasma membrane and intracellular proteins were fractionated by the biotinylation method and ENT1 and ENT2 contents were quantified by western blot. Results: High D-glucose in HK2 cells inhibited the uptake of adenosine. This effect was reversed using a PKA inhibitor (H89) through an increased ENT2 uptake activity. We noticed this PKA inhibitor did not regulate the plasma membrane localization of ENT1 or ENT2 under normal D-glucose (5 mM) or high D-glucose conditions (25 mM). Also, we saw that TBB (CK2 inhibitor) decreased the activity of ENT1 and ENT2 under normal glucose conditions, decreasing the localization of ENT1 at cell surface, while the membrane localization of ENT2 decreases under the effect of TBB and high D-glucose conditions. Conclusions: PKA inhibition reversed the effect of high D-glucose, increasing the uptake of adenosine mediated by ENT2. This could be a new target for the restoration of adenosine levels in DN.",

Follicular fluid is rich in peptides, which significantly influence the growing oocyte. Due to existence of a link between kisspeptin (metastin) cells and gonadal steroids kisspeptin might manipulate the gonadotropin axis and folliculogenesis. In this context, the study was planned to investigate for the first time that the follicular fluid (FF) and serum concentration of kisspeptin in high and poor responders undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Biological samples were collected from twenty infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and 20 poor responder participants undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol for IVF/ICSI treatment. Kisspeptin concentrations were measured in serum and follicular fluid by using ELISA, whereas FSH and LH levels were detected by routine laboratory methods. It was found that kisspeptin levels were significantly lower in serum and follicular fluid of infertile women with PCOS. Kisspeptin levels were correlated with FSH and LH level in infertile women with PCOS. It can be concluded that low level of kisspeptin might inhibit GnRH release that might cause to the inhibition of FSH and LH release and might disrupt folliculogenesis. Decline in serum and FF levels of kisspeptin might be possible cause of anovulation and subfertility in PCOS subjects. Cryptococcus albidus D24 is a newly identified yeast isolates from petroleum area in _ Izmir as a Lipase producer. The molecular weight of the enzyme is 36.31 kDa as found.

However, it shows significant pH stability at pH values 4.0 and lower. The existence of acetone in the solution as a solvent enhanced lipase activity. Cryptococcus albidus D24 lipase was able to catalyze the esterification reaction between fructose and palmitic acid to produce fructose palmitate using acetone as the solvent.

Introduction: The diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) is based on clinical symptoms and radiographic findings. It is known that the pathologic changes at the molecular level in the joint cartilage tissue start before symptoms appear in OA. C1q Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related Protein 1 (CTRP-1), C1q Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related Protein 3 (CTRP-3) and kallistatin are related to many different cellular processes including bone and cartilage tissue metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate any probable association between the serum CTRP-1, CTRP-3 and kallistatin levels and diagnosis and radiologic staging of knee OA patients. Materials and Methods: This study included 60 patients with knee OA and 30 healthy individuals for control purposes. The patient group was divided into four stages radiologically. CTRP-1, CTRP-3 and kallistatin levels were measured in serum samples of patient and control groups with ELISA method, and the differences between the groups were analyzed with statistical methods. Results: The levels of serum CTRP-1 in the patient group were significantly higher than in the control group (P = 0.001), serum CTRP-3 and kallistatin levels were not statistically different (in order of P = 0.251, P = 0.160). In the patient group, there was not a significant difference between serum CTRP-1, CTRP-3 and kallistatin levels and radiologic stages (respectively P = 0.811, P = 0.715, P = 0.202). There was a significant positive correlation between the radiologic stage and patient's age, body mass index, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index and Visual Analogue Scale values (respectively P = 0.001, r = 0.510; P = 0.010, r = 0.331; P = 0.001, r = 0.683; P = 0.001, r = 775). Discussion and Conclusion: Serum CTRP-1 levels were detected significantly increased in patients with knee OA, but there was no significant difference in CTRP-3 and kallistatin levels. There was not a significant association between the radiologic stage and levels of CTRP-1, CTRP-3 and kallistatin.

Three major types of phytases are recognized on the basis of the first phosphate group hydrolyzed by the enzymes: 3-phytase, 4/6-phytase, and 5-phytase. Due to the stereospecific way of phosphate release from the phytate molecule by the action of phytases, these enzymes by themselves and their composition may serve as a potential alternative for production of myo-inositol phosphate isomers with therapeutic properties. Chemical synthesis of these compounds is inefficient and costly.",

In this study the main objective was the cloning and expression of Pantoea sp. 3.5.1 phytase gene in E. coli. First, we amplified the phytase gene (agpP) from the genomic DNA of the bacteria using specific primers PhMH_dir and PhMH_rev. Size of phytase gene corresponded to 1729 base pairs. During the optimization of amplification conditions it was found that the optimum temperature for primer annealing was 66\u00b0C. This temperature increases the specificity and efficiency of annealing. Then the PCR-product of agpP gene was cloned into the pBAD MYC/ HIS vector first. On the next step we carried out subcloning of the agpP into a pET28a expression vector. Multicopy plasmid pET28a/agpP contained the sequence of the phytase gene of Pantoea sp. 3.5.1 under T7 promoter. The corresponding recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli as a fusion with a 6 His-tag and was detected by Western blotting. Recombinant phytase was purified via affine chromotography on the Ni-NTA column and displayed high phosphomonoesterase and phytase activities. BAG-1 (Bcl-2 associated athanogene) is a multifunctional protein that interacts with diverse array of cellular targets and modulates a wide range of cellular processes, including proliferation, cell survival, transcription, apoptosis, metastasis and motility. In human cells BAG-1 exists as three major isoforms (BAG-1S, BAG-1M and BAG-1L) derived by alternative translation initiation from a single mRNA, which allows interactions with various molecular targets such as Hsp70/Hsc70 molecular chaperones, components of the ubiquitylation/proteasome machinery, Bcl-2, Raf-1 kinase, nuclear hormone receptors and DNA. Our work aims to investigate how altered Bag-1 expression levels affect cell survival in MDA-MB-231 (ER, PR and HER2/Neu negative) breast cancer cell lines. We first cloned Bag-1L gene to a cloning vector, later we transfected MDA-MB-231 cells for overexpression of Bag-1. We also used Bag-1 siRNA to silence Bag-1 gene. Western blot analysis was applied to demonstrate relative expression levels of Bag-1, its interacting partners and certain proteins which are important for apoptosis pathway. We performed XTT cell viability assay for Bag-1 overexpressed cells to checkBag-1's impact on cell survival, and observed enhanced survival rates on cells compared to that of the untreated cells with Bag-1 overexpression. In addition, our study revealed that once BAG-1 forms a complex with C-Raf/B-Raf/Hsp70/Akt/Bcl-2, modulation of cell survival was observed. We believe that once the exact localization and involved molecular mechanisms of Bag-1 and its isoforms are found, the role of each Bag-1 isoform in cell survival can be understood better. This can further provide routes to study tumor development. The aim of this study is testing the recombinant GLP1 encapsulation into a biocompatible material. We also tested if it can be a therapeutic candidate drug for type 2 diabetes. The incretin hormones, which are also named as endogenic peptide hormones have become a more attractive therapy for type 2 diabetes because of different physiological effects. In circulation, GLP1 is cleaved by DDP4 in a very short time. If GLP1 can be protected from cleaving, the effective time of GLP1 would be increased and by this way it can replace the therapy of insulin. Chemical synthesis methods of peptides are limited because of low efficiency and high cost. The production of peptides by recombinant E. coli is an alternative way because of effective production, simplicity and low cost. However, the major disadvantage derived from the recombinant E. coli is the frequent formation of inclusion body. For that reason, extra methods are needed for obtaining soluble recombinant peptides. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag is commonly used as affinity and solubility tag to improve the solubility of recombinant peptides. In this study, we cloned and heterologously produced GLP1 using the GST fusion system in E. coli. Affinity purification of recombinant protein was achieved by using glutathione immobilized columns. Characterization of the GST-tagged GLP1 was performed by SDS-PAGE. The purity of fusion protein was found to be 65%, as confirmed by GLP1 ELISA kit. Then, the fusion protein was encapsulated in a chitosan coated polygalacturonic acid. The different pH stability and in vitro release tests also in different pHs was studied.

Among various bacteria belonging to Lactobacillus only some species have genes encoding PII protein in the genome. Here we report the preliminary characterization of PII-like protein LbrGlnK from Lactobacillus brevis. While the amino acid sequence alignment revealed only 50-70% homology of LbrGlnK with other well studied PII proteins, LbrGlnK also has the ATP binding motive GDGK. Trimeric structure of LbrGlnK was confirmed in vitro by size exclusion chromatography, suggesting possible similarities of LbrGlnK properties with PII proteins. The isothermal titration calorimetry revealed a preferential binding of ADP (Kd = 50 lM) over ATP (Kd = 357 lM) suggesting that they compete for binding to LbrGlnK. Neither 2-oxoglutaric acid nor other nucleotides were interacting with LbrGlnK in ITC measurements. The mutation Gly91Ala in the ATP binding motive completely abolished the interaction with both ADP and ATP. The pull down of LbrGlnK with L. brevis cell extract allowed identification of chaperonin GroL, transketolase and GlnR-like transcriptional regulator from MerR family as most probable partner proteins for interactions with LbrGlnK. This work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (Project No. 15-04-02583a Background: Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder due to the deficiency in coagulation factors VIII (hemophilia A) or IX (hemophilia B). Hemophilia patients are essentially treated with intravenous replacement of the missing or dysfunctional factors FVIII or FIX by recombinant proteins. These therapies often induce the generation of acquired antibodies, and thus, novel approaches are needed. Most recent hemophilia strategies target the Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI), which is the major inhibitor of the coagulation cascade, particularly of the extrinsic tenase complex. Anti-TFPI agents have been empirically developed such as aptamers, peptides, monoclonal antibodies. We have followed a structure-based strategy, to design a mutated FXa that would show more affinity for TFPI, and thus trap this inhibitor. TFPI exists as two isoforms are folded as multi-Kunitz domains related by linkers. The second Kunitz type domain of TFPI (TFPI-K2) is known to bind the catalytic site of FXa. Methods: The molecular complex of TFPI-K2-FXa was modeled and submitted to molecular dynamics (MD), allowing the identification of low-spots interaction. Modified FXa with theoretically stronger interaction with TFPI-K2 were predicted using MD. The mutants and wild type proteins were expressed in HEK cells, and their processing status was checked. They were tested by Western Blotting, by chromogenic activity using a specific substrate of FXa, by thrombin generation assay in FVIII depleted plasma. Finally, their binding to a TFPI-K2 peptide array was compared. Results: The mutants showed better efficiency to restore thrombin generation in plasmas from hemophiliacs and displayed stronger binding to TFPI-K2 than the wild type FXa. Conclusions: The proof of concept of the synergistic approaches of MD and mutagenesis was obtained and an efficient TFPI trap was designed. The mutated FXa is a candidate for a new hemophilia therapy. Organophosphorus acid anhydride (OP) nerve agents are potent inhibitors which disrupt the mechanisms of neural transmission. Organophosphorus acid anhydrolase (OPAA; E.C.3.1.8.2) is a class of enzyme that potentially acts on phosphorus anhydride bonds, reported intracellularly in diverse organisms, albeit notably the enzyme belongs to Alteromonas species are more extensively studied. Whereas mass-transfer problem is a major issue in native whole cell biocatalysis, new anchor system derived from the N-terminal domain of ice-nucleation protein from Pseudomonas syringe InaV (InaV-N) was used for the first time to display OPAA onto the cell surface. Tracing of the recombinant protein and its activity assay showed a successful presentation of OPAA and its significant ability for biodegradation of organophosphorus compounds. Further studies on bacterial fractions confirmed that OPAA is remarkably located on the outer membrane. The specific activity of recombinant bacteria to degrade diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) was measured at 260 U/mg of cell wet weight, which almost all was observed in the outer membrane fraction. Recombinant cells could also degrade chlorpyrifos (Cp) compound in 195.6 U/mg activity. It can be concluded that InaV-N anchor is efficient for targeting OPAA on the cell surface and can effectively eliminate the masstransfer problem in native whole cell bioconversion system. Proper spatial and temporal organization of proteins involved in cell signal transduction is crucial for the specific and efficient information transfer. Scaffold proteins coordinate the action of signaling molecules by their physical binding and organization in multiprotein complex assemblies. Multiple protein binding is often mediated through intrinsically disordered regions of the scaffold, where the interaction epitopes are defined by linear peptide motifs.",

Recently the 'reactibody' approach was developed based on the chemical selection of catalytic repertoires from immunoglobulin library followed by expression of these biocatalysts in eukaryotic system. In this study we structurally characterize the A5 antibody, its kappa and lambda variants, in order to understand the difference on the active site between A5 and A17 which although there are two antibodies sharing very high homology and sequence identity their active residues are located in a different region of the antibody. The structures of the A17 antibody kappa and lambda variants have been already determined, there was no structural information though about the A5 antibody. The structural analysis revealed dramatically different angle in position of nucleophilic residue Tyr33 and area of solvent accessible surface. The structural difference of active center reflects on kinetics of the A5 organophosphate modification. Both variants of antibody bind with organophosphate throw induce-fit mechanism, but rate of the step of induce fitting is different (K obs are 35 s \u00c01 and 16 s \u00c01 for A5kappa and A5lambda respectively).

It functions as a catalyst of GDP/GTP exchange in translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) restoring its active conformation appropriate for aminoacylated tRNA binding. eEF1Ba forms a tight complex with translation elongation factor 1Bc (eEF1Bc) via the N-terminal domain, while its C-terminal domain executes the catalytic activity. eEF1Bc has been shown to enhance the attributed to the C-terminal domain catalytic activity of eEF1Ba. This suggests that the eEF1Ba N-terminal domain may influence the guanine nucleotide exchange process. To test this hypothesis we prepared a set of N-terminal truncated forms of human eEF1Ba and checked their activity in the guanine nucleotide exchange assay on both isoforms of eEF1A, eEF1A1 and eEF1A2. We showed that recombinant eEF1Ba is a non-globular monomeric protein in solution with an elongated shape by analytical ultracentrifugation approach. The truncation of the dispensable for the catalytic activity N-terminal domain of eEF1Ba resulted in significant acceleration of the rate of guanine nucleotide exchange in eEF1A2 comparing to full-length eEF1Ba. Similar effect on the catalytic activity of eEF1Ba was observed after its interaction with eEF1Bc. In contrast, the effect of full-length eEF1Ba and its truncated forms on the rate of guanine nucleotide exchange in eEF1A1 was similar but relatively modest compared to eEF1A2. This can be explained by higher rate of spontaneous GDP dissociation from eEF1A1 comparing to eEF1A2 and lower affinity of eEF1A1 to eEF1Ba.",

Grinenko Palladin Institute of Biochemistry of NAS of Ukraine, Kyiv, Ukraine Introduction: Plasminogen interaction with specific binding sites in C-terminal D-domains of fibrin molecule initiates the activation process of proenzyme and subsequent fibrin clot lysis. The sites are exposed under fibrin polymerization. Plasminogen kringle domains ensure the proenzyme interactions with fibrin clot. In this study, we investigated the binding of human plasminogen kringle fragments K 1-3 and K 5 with human fibrin fragment DD and their effect on Glu-plasminogen interaction with DD. Results: Kringle-containing fragments K 1-3 and K 5 reduce plasminogen activation by tissue-type activator on fibrin fragment DD. The level of Glu-plasminogen binding to DD is decreased by 50-60% in the presence of K 1-3 and K 5. Fragments K 1-3 and K 5 have high affinity to fibrin fragment DD (dissociation constant is 0.02 lM for K 1-3 and 0.054 lM for K 5). Analysis of K 1-3 and K 5 binding to fibrin fragment DD with reduced disulfide bonds showed the interaction of both plasminogen fragments with c-c-chains of fragment DD. K 1-3 interacts with complex of fragment DD-immobilized K 5 as well as K 5 with complex of fragment DD-immobilized K 1-3. The plasminogen fragments do not displace each other from binding sites located in fibrin fragment DD, but can compete for the interaction. Analysis of K 1-3 and K 5 binding to fibrin fragment DD with reduced disulfide bonds showed the interaction of both plasminogen fragments with aand c-chains of fragment DD. Conclusions: Widely known specific plasminogen-binding site located in Aa148-160 region of fibrin molecule is not a single binding sequence of fibrin peripheral domains or plasminogenbinding site is not linear and contains amino acid residues from other polypeptide chains of fibrin D-domains. Fibrin fragment DD contains different binding sites for plasminogen kringle fragments K 1-3 and K 5, which can be located close to each other. Possible plasminogen kringle-binding sites are located in aand c-chains. P-02.02.2-081 Implementation of budded baculovirus particles for characterization of ligand binding to G protein-coupled receptors A. Allikalt, A. Rinken University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest class of membrane receptors involved in regulation of signal transduction into the cell in response to various extracellular stimuli. For that reason, GPCRs have become important targets for variety of drugs. As these receptors are present in native tissues at very low concentrations, efficient recombinant expression systems are needed to produce sufficient amounts of protein. We have shown that budded baculovirus particles, which display GPCRs on their surfaces can be used as a source of receptors for the investigation of ligand-receptor interactions.

This system has many advantages, for example good signal to noise ratio, homogeneity of the receptor, high expression levels and long-term stability of the receptor preparation. FA method allowed real-time monitoring of reporter ligand binding in the absence and presence of different dopaminergic ligands, giving information about their kinetic properties. Association, as well as dissociation of the Bodipy-FL-SKF-83566 itself were rapid with an apparent half-life of t 1/2 = 38.5 AE 0.3 s for association (2 nM) and t 1/2 = 73.4 AE 3.8 s for dissociation. We determined the pharmacological profiles of different dopaminergic ligands in displacement binding assays with membranes of Sf9 cells or budded baculovirus particles. The data were in good agreement for both membrane preparations tested in radioligand binding as well as in FA assay.

Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer includes a variety of cancer types affecting the structures and functions of the GI system, encompassing the GI tract and the accessory organs of digestion, from the esophagus, stomach, biliary system and pancreas to the intestine, rectum and anus. Despite the significant advances however, much remains to be learned in the spectrum of GI cancer. Several investigators have shown that both Gas6 and its receptors, Axl, Sky, and Mer are expressed in various types of cancers. However, the expression level of Gas6 in GI cancer remains unclear. The aim of the study was to determine and compare plasma Gas6 levels in GI cancer patients. 15 female and 27 male patients were included in the study (n = 42): 21 colorectal, 8 gastric, 4 pancreatic, 3 liver, 2 ampullary, 2 gall bladder and 2 esophageal.

Tooke University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom b-lactam hydrolysing enzymes, in particular carbapenem-hydrolysing enzymes, are an increasing clinical threat. Herein we show that Molecular dynamics (MD) and combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approaches are a predictive tool of carbepenemase activity in class A b-lactamases. b-lactam drugs are the most prescribed class of antibiotics worldwide, especially in the treatment of Gram-negative pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. These organisms produce b-lactamases, enzymes which hydrolyse the b-lactam ring, a key resistance mechanism. Class A b-lactamases have the ability to hydrolyse carbapenems, termed 'last resort' antibiotics. In particular, the KPC (Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase) family are the most clinically important, and recently identified natural KPC variants show increased hydrolytic activity against ceftazidime, a third generation cephalosporin.",

With the discovery of the presence of allosteric sites, these molecules attracted the attention of the pharmaceutical studies and became drug targets. As a result of the binding of small molecules to the dimeric interface, active site loops are shifted to an unfavorable position. This is associated with a network between distal allosteric sites and the active site loop. An energy dissipation model was applied in order to analyze this matter in further detail. Perturbation of specific residues enable us to determine a possible signaling network in proteins using external energy as an input, while focusing on the dispersion of this energy between residues throughout the structure. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with and without energy perturbation using NAMD software with CHARMM27 force field.

Optogenetics comprises biological methods to achieve gain or loss of function of well-defined events in specific cells of living tissue by means of targetable control tools that respond to light and deliver the effector function. Microbial rhodopsins (MRs) have been established as powerful light-sensitive tools for optogenetics. Acting as ion pumps or channels, MRs are used to induce cell (de)polarization to control neuronal activity in a wide range of living organisms. MRs are membrane proteins found in a large clade of organisms, including Eukaryotes, Bacteria, and Archaea. They share a common architecture of 7 transmembrane a-helices and a covalently linked retinal, which is employed to absorb photons for energy conversion or the initiation of cellular signaling. Major efforts are put into screening of natural and generating of synthetic MRs with desirable properties for optogenetics, e.g. ion selectivity.

Ras proteins mediate a wide variety of signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. These proteins are small GTPases that act as binary switches between GDP-bound 'off' and GTP-bound 'on' states. Oncogenic point mutations of Ras are associated with~15% of all cancers and up to 90% in specific tumors and many developmental disorders. Both experimental and in silico results showed that the membrane-bound Ras proteins form non-overlapping dynamic nanosized subdomains called nanoclusters in an activation state-/ isoform-dependent manner. We performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations in order to investigate the formation and evolution of Ras nanoclusters in mammalian model membranes. Ras proteins were inserted into the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane model (di-C16:0-phosphatidyl-choline: di-18:2-phosphatidyl-choline: cholesterol 5:3:2) where they formed highly dynamic nanoclusters, both in size and in composition. Furhermore, we found that the presence of Ras protein nanoclusters has a significant impact on the model membrane behavior. Properties such as phase behavior, diffusion coefficient, surface tension and lipid tails order parameter are also influenced by the temperature variation of the model membrane. We have investigated dynamics in three different crystal forms of ubiquitin, as well as ubiquitin in solution, with particular emphasis on (i) conformational exchange between b turn type I and II in the region 51-54 and (ii) rocking dynamics where protein molecules as a whole undergo subtle reorientational motion within the confines of the crystal lattice. Experimentally, both motional processes have been probed using relaxation dispersion techniques, including recently developed near-rotary-resonance dipolar relaxation dispersion experiments. Thereby it has been determined that rocking motion in one of the crystal forms (PDB ID 3N30) occurs on the time scale of tens of microseconds, whereas the conformational exchange has characteristic time constant of ca. 100 ls. Using Molecular Dynamics simulations, we have shown that the similarity of motional time scales is not accidental: bI\u2194bII exchange and rocking motion appear to be coupled. We have investigated the mechanisms of this coupling and predicted a number of point mutations that are expected to abrogate (or enhance) rocking. The crystals of ubiquitin containing these mutations have been modeled in silico. We have also investigated the interactions (in particular, crystal contacts) that control the balance between bI and bII conformations in different crystal forms. Finally, we have used MD simulations as a basis for chemical shift calculations and illustrated how relaxation dispersion effects can emerge as a function of bI\u2194bII exchange in conjunction with the rocking motion.

Flavonoids are highly bioactive plant secondary metabolites that are important in human health due to their antioxidant property. Quercetin, a natural flavonoid derivative, has been shown to regulate several signal transduction pathways and is in phase I clinical trial as an anticancer drug. This study explored the inhibitory potential of quercetin and its derivatives using in silico methods like molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Quercetin and its derivatives were observed to bind to several serine/threonine kinase family proteins with binding energy significantly better than other known inhibitors and commercially available drugs. This study thus sheds light on the atomic level interactions that define the polypharmacological nature of quercetin and its ability to interfere with a number of cancer pathways. Introduction: Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) of the fetal RhD status by RHD genotyping of the maternal plasma was initially applied in alloimmunized pregnant women. Fetal rhesus D status detection for management of RhD incompatibility using circulating cell-free fetal DNA from maternal plasma or serum is now accepted by many obstetricians in Europe as reliable and useful. The aim of the study was to detect fetal RHD specific antibodies in maternal plasma using a nanopolimer based electrochemical biosensor. Materials and Methods: A three-electrode system, consisting of a gold electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode, was accommodated in a 10-mL electrochemical cell. Anilin and jelatin were used for immobilization of RHD antibody. The polimerization was occured at 319 nm UV light. Antibodies of RhD antigen were detected using differential pulse method at between 0.4 and 0.6 V potentials by observing the differentiations in the current values. Results: The RhD status of the fetus was predicted in 20 RhDnegative pregnant women (8-36th week of pregnancy). RHD antibody were detected in maternal bood using biosensor in 15 of the fetuses. The results were confirmed with real-time PCR. The fetuses found RhD (+) for exon 5 and 7 of RHD gene by multiplex real-time PCR. Discussion and Conclusion: Biosensors based studies might be useful, because they allow to monitor the molecular interactions in real-time providing qualitative and quantitative information, through kinetics, affinity and concentration analyses. We found that more advantages in comparison to other methods reported in the literature so far; it was determined that the method is sensitive, specific, economic, practical and less time-consuming. Fetal RHD detection at low concentrations and in the early week of pregnancy is possible with this method.

Metagenomics is providing great help to explore world of unculturable microorganisms in the natural samples to enhance our knowledge about microbial diversity. Here, we have performed metagenomic analysis of fresh water lake bacterial community using 454 pyrosequencing techniques. We have observed a wide array of bacteria from phylum proteobacteria and family Enterobacteriaceae as well as very few viruses from Podoviridae, Siphoviridae and unclassified phages. We have conducted a metagenomics analysis with the primary focus on the examination of the community of bacteria in a fresh water lake ecosystem. Roche GS FLX Software gave us total 156 253 reads (with an average read length of 795.274 bp). There were 15 226 contigs having > 100 bp sequence length whereas 10 481 contigs with > 500 bp sequence length. For further analysis we have taken contigs with > 500 bp only. Further, we have analyzed the microbial community composition using BLASTN/BLASTX against NT/NR databases with E-value cutoff of 10 \u00c05 . \u226570% of total contigs were mapped to the reference with \u226560% contig match coverage. The community analysis revealed that domain bacteria is predominantly present (99.8%) in the water sample, followed by Eukaryota (0.02%), viruses (0.08%) and other sequences (0.02%). Most abundant phyla was proteobacteria (99.8%) and the most dominant family was Enterobacteriaceae (89%) followed by Xanthomonadaceae (10%), Vibrionaceae (0.4%), Pasteurellaceae (0.1%), Shewanellaceae (0.07%).

The great diversity of microorganisms present in the Lake may reflect the human activity in the area. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a ubiquitous and widespread tool for protein identification. Once the protein sequence is unavailable, unambiguous identification cannot be performed, and predictability is limited by the presence of sequenced homologous proteins. We present a statistical approach to predict a number of structural, localization and functional properties of unknown proteins by direct analysis of mass distribution shapes of their post-cleavage fragments obtained from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data. Secondary structure of proteins is best predicted by their specific cleavage at the inertial hydropathy group amino acid residues (FILMV), with Thermolysin (AFILMV) being the closest commercially available reagent, leading to distinguishing between proteins with presumably ahelixes or b-sheets with 90% accuracy. Cellular localization of proteins is best predicted by their specific cleavage at the external hydropathy group amino acid residues (DEHKNQR), exemplified by GluC(phosphate)+LysC(DEK) cleavage. Protein location in the cell membrane and its localization character (monotopic/ transmembrane, single-pass/multi-pass transmembrane) are predictable with~75% accuracy by this single cleavage, with optimal combination of 3-4 cleavages improving the accuracy t\u00f5 80%. Functional prediction of proteins is the best among membrane-associated proteins with characteristic structural conformations. We attribute the differences in the mass distribution shapes to the characteristic clustering of amino acids residues with respective hydropathy properties that are involved in the formation of 3d structural conformations of proteins. The suggested approach allows for a non-parametric statistical prediction of uncharacterized proteins from their MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data without knowledge or reconstruction of their primary sequence. Potential applications include proteomic studies of organisms with unavailable genomic sequences and highly variable proteins analysis.

RNase overproduction is brought about by non-specialized mechanism since other hydrolases are also overproduced in mutant strain. Genes encoding extracellular serine protease, sporulation initiation phosphotransferase F, GNAT-family acetyltransferase and cell wall modifying enzymes are reported previously to increase production of degradative enzymes. The action of encoded by them proteins lead to increase of stability and release of secreted proteins to environment and to derepression of their transcription from negative regulators Bacillus pumilus strain 7P has been identified on its ability to produce ribonuclease and different extracellular proteases. In order to increase inherent biosynthesis of proteases the 7P strain was screened on culture medium supplemented by streptomycin. Derivative B. pumilus strain 3-19 gains the resistance to streptomycin and also shows the increased ribonuclease activity. We used genomes of both these strains to explore streptomycin susceptibility and increased activity of hydrolytic enzymes.",

We calculated average nucleotide identity (ANI) values between the genomes of our strains and 9 completed B. pumilus genomes deposited in NCBI database. Two B. pumilus strains (SH-B9 and SAFR-032) revealed the max. ANI value (95.17% and 94.65%, respectively). B. pumilus SH-B9 strain has been used as a reference for SNP calling in strains 7P and 3-19. 3828 SNPs for the 7P strain and 862 for the 3-19 strain were classified as nonsynonymous variants. 20 radical nucleotide substitutions from the 3-19 genome were not found in 7P genome. Among them, the mutation in the 56 codon of rpsL gene (coding 30S ribosomal protein S12) is probably associated with resistance to streptomycin. Also, two mutations in rpoB and nusA genes (coding RNA polymerase and transcription termination factor Rho, respectively) may be related to increased enzymes activity. Both our strains contain 143 protease-coding genes. Twelve of them are encoding extracellular proteases. Here we propose an algorithm that can predict an antibodies mutant forms with desired specificity. This algorithm allows to determine the position and type of amino acid residue for mutagenesis. Approach is based on a hybrid method of quantum and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) that allows to understand the reaction mechanism and the role of active center amino acids. Catalytic antibody A17, that is able to hydrolyze pesticide paraoxon, was selected as a model. However, the hydrolysis efficiency of paraoxon by A17 antibody is only 9 M \u00c01 min \u00c01 , that is insufficient for using this antibody as antidote. The main fundamental goal of our study is to determine the necessary conditions for improving the binding reaction of paraoxon by catalytic antibody A17.",

The key step of the reaction is the proton transfer from the catalytic residue Tyr-37 to paraoxon. QM/MM approach determines position for mutagenesis -Leu-47 in light chain. For one of the mutant in this position -Leu47Argwere predicted (i) increased probability of formation of a hydrogen bond between the catalytic moiety and paraoxon compared to the wild type antibody and (ii) smaller value of the diffusion coefficient, which reflects the best positioning of paraoxon in the active center. Steady-state kinetic analysis shows that Leu47Arg exhibits a 70-fold increase in k 2 /K D compared to A17 (90 M \u00c01 min \u00c01 vs. 1.35 M \u00c01 min \u00c01 ). Double mutant Leu47Arg/Ser35Ala also has improved constants of interaction with paraoxon in comparison with the wild type antibody, however, a single mutant Leu47Arg still binds paraoxon three times better, that may be due to the fact that the serine in 35 position increase the nucleophilicity of Tyr37. Thus, our results are in line with our computed predictions.",

In the retrospect of the studies for evaluating and detection of unwanted tissues in the sample is basic histological examination. The light microscopy techniques are very strong method if a researcher qualification is enough. A new researcher-independent method must be developed. Therefore, different tissues and organs constitute of unique mRNA and protein. Our method is based on this event, so the antigenic sites of the tissues can be detected by selected antibodies. The first set of the antibodies are for detecting muscle and adipose, consist on Muscle Actin and Adipose Triglyceride Lipase. This set is used for calibration on standard meat sample. The second set of the antibodies are detecting of offal tissues, consist on TRRAP and Casein. Anti-Casein antibody is selected because the mammary gland usage in grinded-meat is very common. Immuno-staining started with HIER (Heat mediated epitope retrieval), then classical IHC method applied to slides with DAB-chromogen. After all process completed the slides were photographed by LAS (Leica Application Suite) on microscope. The capture settings were remained same on both sets. Image capture size is 1392x1040 pixels and field of view (FOV) is 449 9 335 lm. All the image files were converted to binary for threshold operation.

Reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) contributed to pathophysiology of several diseases. Aliskiren (ALS) inhibits the renin on the first step of this system. Our aim is to investigate the protective effect of aliskiren on unilateral testis damage caused by experimental testis torsion and detorsion. The forty-eight rats were separated into eight groups of six animals: SHAM, SHAM+ALS 200 mg/kg (oral) group, Torsion group (TOR), Torsion/Detorsion group (TOR/DET), TOR+ALS 100 mg/kg (oral) group, TOR+ALS 200 mg/kg (oral) group, TOR/DET+ALS 100 mg/kg (oral) group, TOR/DET+ALS 200 mg/kg (oral) group. In the TOR and TOR/DET groups, the left testes were rotated 720\u00b0clockwise together with the spermatic cord and tunica vaginalis in the scrotal space.

The study was aimed at investigating hepatoprotective role of D 3 in VDR-mediated regulation of pro-inflammatory factors in diabetic liver. Materials and Methods: Type 1 diabetes was induced in male C57BL/J6 mice by i.p. injection of high-dose STZ (150 mg/kg b.w.). After 2 weeks of STZ-induced diabetes animals were treated with/without D 3 (15 IU/mouse per os) for 8 weeks. Blood serum 25OHD 3 was assessed by ELISA. Rel-A, VPF, iNOS and VDR expression was measured by qRT-PCR and/or Western-blot. Results and Discussion: Diabetes caused two-fold reduction of serum 25OHD 3 level, indicative of D 3 deficiency. Significant alterations in D 3 -endocrine system were found as is evident from reduced expression of CYP27A1, CYP2R1, VDBP and VDR at transcriptional and translational levels. These changes were accompanied by a marked increase in mRNA and protein levels of inflammation markers Rel-A, VPF and iNOS in hepatic tissue of diabetic mice. Diabetes also led to structural lesions in liver tissue. Complete restoration of 25OHD 3 content and partial normalization of liver tissue structure were achieved after D 3 treatment. D 3 administration partially normalized expression of cytochromes involved in D 3 metabolism and hepatic pro-inflammatory factors. D 3 treatment prevented overexpression of Rel-A and phosphorylated p65/Rel-A translocation to hepatocellular nuclei that is most likely mediated through 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and VDR. Conclusion: Study confirmed that diabetes-induced liver abnormalities are associated with chronic inflammation that can be linked to impaired D 3 metabolism and deficiency. Our findings demonstrate protective VDR-mediated effect of vitamin D 3 against diabetes-induced liver injury.

            "text": "Introduction: The aim of this is to identify remedial effects of Lavandula stoechas, Anatolian traditional medicine, against metabolic disorders developed on the ground of insulin resistance. Ethyl acetate extract (EAE) of L. stoechas was investigated in C2C12 myotubes which were made insulin resistant by free fatty acid (FFA) treatment, for its effects on glucose uptake and as well as on the activation of AKT-1 (by pAKT/ AKT ratio) molecule which plays a central role in insulin signaling through Serine (473) phosphorylation. In addition, the protein level of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) enzyme was also evaluated. Material and Methods: C2C12 cells were made insulin resistant by palmitic acid (FFA) and effects of EAE on p-AKT (Ser473)/AKT ratio and LPL level were determined by SDS-PAGE/Western Blot. The effect of EAE on glucose uptake in insulin resistant cells were determined by the 2-deoxyglucose uptake assay. Results: EAE at 25 and 50 lg/mL significantly increased the glucose uptake 120 and 182% compared to insulin resistant control cells. Metformin at 2 mM increased this parameter up to 132%. EAE increased pAKT Ser473/AKT level 43-37% and LPL expression 50-92% for 25 and 50 lg/mL, in insulin resistant myotubes, respectively (P < 0.05). Discussion: EAE of L. stoechas improved impaired insulin sensitivity through both enhancing glucose uptake and activation of AKT1 molecule through Ser473 phosphorylation. In addition, it also considerably increased LPL level which has very important function in lipid metabolism. Conclusion: Overall, results demonstrated that L. stoechas contain phytochemicals which can be effective for the prevention and also treatment of insulin resistance and associated conditions. Our research group is on the way for the identification of these 'bioactive' molecules with bioassay guided fractionation studies. TUBITAK (ProjectID: 112T442) supports this study. Achievement of complete pain control is very difficult task, which requires a search for new molecular targets during the analgesic substances development. Considering the importance of glial cells and their signaling molecules, development of new gliotropic therapeutic methods is a promising direction in pain treatment.

Methods and Results: Eighty-six CHC patients and 60 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study. Circulating levels of hs-TnT, NT-proBNP, AOPPs-albumin (the ratio of AOPPs to albumin content), EMPs (CD144 +/ CD31 + ), hs-CRP, and TNF-a were assessed. Compared with CHC patients, the CHC patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) had higher levels of EMPs (CD144 +/ CD31 + ) and AOPPs-Alb, which were associated with elevated hs-TnT levels (\u226513.3 pg/mL). NT-proBNP positively correlated with TNF-a level in all CHC patients and this correlation was stronger in diabetic patients. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the independent factors associated with the presence of elevated hs-TnT levels were the presence of DM (P < 0.001) as well as high levels of AOPPs-Alb, apoptotic EMPs (CD144 + /CD31 + /AN-V + ), and NT-proBNP (P = 0.04, P = 0.03, P = 0.04 respectively). Conclusion: The prevalence of elevated hs-TnT were increased significantly in the diabetic patients with chronic hepatitis C. hs-TnT was related to non-standard risk factors for cardiovascular events, and circulating endothelial-derived apoptotic microparticles (CD144 + /CD31 + /AN-V + ) level was an independent predictor for elevated hs-TnT levels, potentially indicating some abnormalities in the myocardium.

The patients, who were diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea with the examination and sleep tests, were assessed according to the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria in terms of FMS. Serum D vitamin level was measured by using the Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Method. Findings: When the Fibromyalgia Syndrome and Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Pure Obstructive Sleep Apnea patient groups are compared with the Control Group, the vitamin D level was found to be low at a significant level (P = 0.038, P = 0.001, respectively). No significant difference was found between the Vitamin D levels in Fibromyalgia Syndrome, Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Pure Obstructive Sleep Apnea patient groups. A negative correlation was found between the number of the sensitive points and Vitamin D levels in Fibromyalgia Syndrome patients (P = 0.013). Results: It has been concluded that the Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Fibromyalgia Syndrome Patients have low Vitamin D levels, and this situation must be considered in treatment modalities. On the other hand, the results obtained in the study make us consider that Vitamin D metabolism is not influential in the pathogenesis of the Fibromyalgia Syndrome and Obstructive Sleep Apnea togetherness.

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the relationship between vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus metabolism with graft function and to measure 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 levels with LC-MS/ MS in renal transplant recipients. Design and Methods: This study included 30 renal transplant recipients (10 female, 20 male; mean age: 40.30 AE 12.86) from living related donors were transplanted. Blood samples were collected immediately before and after transplantation at month 6. Serum creatinine, BUN, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, albumin, PTH, 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 levels were measured. GFR values were estimated by CKD-EPI. Plasma 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 levels were determined in a LCMS-8040 triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) by MRM. SPSS 20.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: Although plasma 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 levels significantly increased (P = 0.0001), we did not find any significant differences for serum 25(OH)D levels after transplantation. When posttransplant levels of serum phosphorus, PTH, creatinin, BUN and ALP levels were found to be significantly decreased (P = 0.0001, P = 0.011 for ALP), we observed significantly higher calcium and GFR values (P = 0.0001). Vitamin D insufficiency was present 13.3%, deficiency 36.7%, severe deficiency 50% before transplantation, insufficiency was also seen 26.7%, deficiency 50%, severe deficiency 23.3% after transplantation at month 6. Conclusions: In our study, all patients were found to vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency. Determination of vitamin D deficiency and consequently treatment with vitamin D supplements could lead to better graft surveys.

An extensive inflammatory response occurs due to inflammatory mediators synthesized and secreted during SAP. Since preventing the inflammation in SAP is important in the prognosis of the disease, new drug candidates having strong antiinflammatory effects will provide a new concept for therapeutic strategies against acute pancreatitis.

Arterial immune mediated inflammation participates centrally in all stages of the development of atherosclerosis, from the initial lesion to the end-stage thrombotic complications. Although emerging evidence supports augmented cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in cutaneous psoriasis (PsC) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) as compared to the general population its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we analyzed the inflammatory burden in recent onset of PsA patients without traditional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) in a transversal study measuring carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) (measured with ecodoppler), and proatherogenic inflammatory molecular markers like C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) in comparison with control patients. cIMT values are similar in PsA (0, 59 AE 0.045*) and PsC (0, 62 AE 0.10) patients. However, both of them were significant increase compared with control (0.436 AE 0, 05). Regarding inflammatory markers IL-6 serum levels in patients with APs was higher than PCs (18 AE 2.9) and healthy controls (16, 3 AE 2.5) but the difference did not achieve statistical significance (*P > 0.05). On other hand mean of sICAM-1, value from patients with recent onset of PsA is significant higher than controls. PsC remain without significant changes compared to control (*P > 0.05). In addition mean value from patients with recent onset of PsA is significantly higher than in controls (*P < 0.05) and PsC group. Overall, preliminary findings suggest for the first time that patients with early PsA, without evident traditional CVRF have significant increased values of cIMT, sICAM-1 CRP against the general population control group. This data strongly supports that early CV molecular markers are increased after the first symptoms and signs of this disease even in the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, this give new windows for a proper treatment.

Lower levels of Decoy Receptor 1 (DcR1) expression detected prior to treatments increased significantly in contrast. Discussion: The fact that TRAIL co-treatment with TNF-a, IFN-\u1d5e and IL-1b increased cell viability in NIT-1 beta cell lines along with reduction in DR5 death receptor expression and an increase in the decoy receptor DcR1 expression, points out to a possible protective effect of TRAIL in insulitis, and strengthens its potential as a putative therapeutic molecule in prevention of beta cell loss.

Objectives: Lung cancers are divided in two main groups as Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) . Docetaxel (DTX) and Cisplatine are chemotherapeutic that has an anti-tumor activity against various solid tumors. The growing resistance against DTX and Cisplatine (Cis) still continues to be the biggest obstacle for the treatment success of NSCLC patients. Deguelin (Deg.) is a natural plant derivative and has an encouraging activity against a lot of human cancers. The comparison of the treatment activity of the separate and combined usage of Deg., which is a potential chemotherapeutic agent, and DTX, Cis which are used in standard treatment, is aimed in this study. Material-Method: The IC50 doses of DTX, Cis and Deg. on the A549 and H1299 NSCLCcell lines were determined via the cell vitality tests in our study. The active concentrations determined were applied to NSCLC cell lines as Deg., DTX, Cis and their combinations. The impacts of the medicine are studied by applying flow cytometric analyzes (apoptosis, cell cycle), glutathione and reducted glutathione, colony formation, migration and angiogenesis analyzes on the treated cells and measuring the Oxidative Stress Index (OSI). Statistical analyse program, Rstudio (v.0.98.501) and the R-script language were used to examine the differences between the agents. The states in which the Pvalue was lower than 0.05 were accepted as statistically meaningful. Results: We found that Deg. has pro-apoptotic, anti-migratory and cytotoxic potential on lung cancer cells. Deg. amplified Cis and DTX-related anti-cancer efficacy (increased apoptotic cell content and cytotoxicity, reduced migration). Also, Deguelin pretreatment sensitized the cells DTX-treatment (reduced IC50 values). These effects were remarkable in p53-mutant cells. Conclusion: Deguelin, solely, has anti-cancer potential on NSCLCcells. Both Deguelin pre-treatment and combinantion with standart chemotherapeutics result in enhanced anticancer efficacy. The 83% of the lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Despite Docetaxel (DTX) and Cisplatine (CDDP) are agents used in the standard treatments of these patients and the recent improvements in the treatments, the response and remission rates observed on the patients are relatively nominal. Selenium (Se) is an essential diet component and is introduced to have a preventive impact on different levels of cancer. The aim of our study is to investigate the impacts of Selenium addition on anticancer feature and tumor prevention before or/and during NSCLC standard treatment.",

Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy worldwide. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in 30% of breast cancers in association with aggressive phenotypes. The prognosis of metastatic breast cancer remains poor in spite of advances in therapy. As such, HER2 has long been studied as a potential target for anticancer drugs. The modulation of intracellular signaling pathways leads to altered cell metabolism that triggers tumorigenesis and adapts cells to cancer cell metabolism. This characteristic hallmark of cancer metabolism is known as Warburg effect meaning energy production via enhanced glycolysis. Despite of several studies in breast cancer metabolism, little detail exists on the link between HER2 overexpression and Warburg effect. We have committed examining the nature of aerobic glycolysis in HER2 overexpression. In breast cancer cell line MCF7, HER2 overexpression (MCF-HER2) results in mitochondrial dysfunction with low mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u1d2am) and ROS accumulation. Intracellular iron levels are also higher in MCF7-HER2 cells than vector control (MCF7-vec). Additionally, MCF7-HER2 cells show enhanced levels of ATP and lactate in association with increase in glucose levels. We have found that complex I activity increases in MCF7-HER2 and decreases in knockdown of HER2 in HCC1954 cells that is HER2 positive breast tumor cell line. Based on these results, we conclude that there is a link between HER2 overexpression and metabolic indicators of Warburg effect.",

Because of difficulty in diagnosis and treatment HC is a clinical problem: early symptoms of HC are often non-specific and surgical resection is the only curative treatment for HC. It is well known that epigenetic alterations are linked to cancer development. The purpose of this study was to determine potential mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of genes related to energy metabolism in HC. We have performed bioinformatics analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project RNA-seq data with CrossHub software and found a number of genes involved in glycolysis and differentially expressed in cholangiocarcinoma. qPCR analysis revealed significantly decreased expression of PGM1 and ENO3 genes in a majority of HC samples which were known as up-regulated in other human cancers according to the literature date. On the basis of TCGA methylation dataset (450k Illumina microarrays) we supposed that CpG methylation of PGM1 and ENO3 promoters may play a role in their inactivation. Using bisulfite sequencing study we identified several regions within the gene promoters (PGM1:~750 bp and 330 bp upstream TSS; ENO3:~750 bp downstream TSS) that are frequently methylated in HC samples (up to 60%, 12/20) with down-regulated PGM1 and ENO3 expression. Thus, we demonstrated frequent and significant PGM1 and ENO3 down-regulation associated with hypermethylation of the specific regions within the gene promoters in HC. The pattern of PGM1 and ENO3 gene promoter methylation suggests a possibility of ones to be used for the HC diagnosis and development new strategies for therapy.

Introduction: The development of stomach cancer is a multifactorial and complex process and includes multiple epigenetic, genetic alterations and dietary/non-dietary factors. Iodine as an antioxidant may play a protective role against gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in iodine level in rat with stomach cancer induced by N-methyl-N 0 -nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Materials and Methods: A total of 62 Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups. 55 rats were administered with MNNG (200 lg/ml) by oral gavage on days 0, 14 and 21 to initiate stomach cancer. During the experiment, 28 rats died and those surviving were sacrificed in the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th and 12th months of the experimental period (Group I, II, III, IV, V, respectively). The control group (Group VI) contains 7 rat which are given only food and water for 12 months. The stomach tissue was examined histopathologically. And also, iodine levels in stomach tissue was determined using the Foss method. Results: A decrease in iodine level was determined in stomach cancer tissue of rats in Group I-V compared with normal healthy stomach tissue in Group VI. When the control (Group VI) iodine level was taken as % baseline, the % iodine levels of all groups were determined as follows 71.78, 52.79, 40.76, 25.33 and 11.96 for Groups I-V, respectively. The pathological diagnosis of gastric cancer was adenocarcinoma. Discussion and Conclusion: The iodine levels of Group I were higher than those of Group II (P < 0.01) and of Groups III, IV and V (P < 0.001) and also were lower than in the control group (P < 0.001). Iodine deficiency as one of the risk factors of stomach cancer strongly supports the necessity for the application of effective iodine prophylaxis in the areas with iodine deficiency. Iodine supplementation might be useful in stomach cancer therapy and therefore, further research is warranted. This study was supported by Ataturk University (project number: 2005/147).",

Genetic and epigenetic aberrations can lead to the activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) followed by the development of malignant tumors. In the present work we evaluated the frequency of alterations of CpG island methylation and DNA copy number in 47 paired (tumor/normal) breast cancer (BC) samples using comparative DNA hybridization on NotI-microarrays and original NIMAN software. The microarrays contained 180 NotI-clones associated with 188 chromosome 3 genes. Expression alterations were assessed with the use of qPCR technique, DDCt method and original ATG software. In total, 35 NotI-sites with high (15-38% of cases) hypermethylation/deletion (HM/D) frequency were revealed in BC. Among genes associated with these sites, there are both known TSGs and TSG-candidates (ALDH1L1, VHL, CTDSPL, etc.) as well as genes, which involvement in breast oncogenesis was shown for the first time (LRRN1, FOXP1, PRICKLE2, etc.). NotI-microarray data were verified selectively using bisulfite sequencing for VHL, NKIRAS1, ITGA9, LRRC3B, and CTDSPL genes. Several genes with high HM/D frequency (ALDH1L1, EPHB1, ITGA9, and ROPN1) were tested for expression alterations using qPCR. Frequent (57-90% of cases) and significant (> 2-fold) down-regulation was shown for all of them in BC. The most significant expression loss was observed for ALDH1L1 geneon the average 50-fold mRNA level decrease in 90% of samples. The involvement of the majority of genes with high HM/D frequency in breast oncogenesis was shown for the first time. These genes are novel TSG-candidates in BC. Functional hypermethylation associated with expression loss was shown for ALDH1L1, EPHB1, ITGA9, and ROPN1 genes thereby strengthening the speculation on tumor suppressor abilities of these genes.

Vitex agnus-castus has been used since ancient times as a remedy. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro anticancer activities of Vitexagnus-castus oil. For this purpose, the cytotoxicity of Vitexagnus-castus oil in SH-SY5Y cells was investigated by crystal violet staining. EC50 was found to be 0.5%(w/w) Vitexagnus-castus oil for this cell line. This dose was applied to the cell for 24 h, and the cells were harvested for further studies. Vitex agnus-castus oil treatment increased Bax and p38 mRNA levels. On the other hand, Bcl-2, Bcl2 l1, Erk-2, JNK, caspase 3 and 8mRNA expression levels were reduced significantly withVitexagnus-castus oil treatment while P53 and PTEN remained unchanged. These results indicate that another effector caspase such as caspase 6 or 7 may be involved apoptosis process which remains to be elucidated. Moreover, MAPK pathways, P38 and Erk, may be involved in Vitexagnus-castus oil induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells.

Holmboe] is distributed throughout southern Mediterranean Europe from Spain to the eastern Mediterranean on Anatolian peninsula of Turkey. Present study was designed to investigate the in vitro anti-cancer activities of Turkish Black Pine essential oil. The essential oil was extracted by steam-hydrodistillation and its chemical composition analyzed by GC-MS. The major components of the essential oil were a-pinene, b-pinene and trans-b-caryophyllene, respectively. The crystal violet staining method was used to investigate the cytotoxicity of essential oil in SH-SY5Y cells. EC50 was found to be 0.75% (w/w) essential oil for SH-SY5Y cells. Neuroblastoma cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. After 24 h, cells were harvested for further studies. Bax and p38 mRNA levels were significantly elevated in essential oiltreated cells. On the other hand, Bcl-2, Bcl2 l1, Casp-3, Casp-8, Erk-2 and JNK expression were significantly downregulated. Unlike these proteins, p53 and PTEN mRNAs were not changed. In this study, apoptosis was enhanced by Turkish Black Pine essential oil treatment which was activated by the involvement of another effector caspase subfamily, like Casp-6 and Casp-7. Additionally, Erk and p38 MAPKs may be associated with upregulation of the level of bax.

Methods: Totally, fifty six male Wistar albino rats were equally divided into eight groups as follows: control; Cis treatment (7 mg/kg b.w., i.p.), NG and NG-Ox (20 mg/kg b.w., i.p daily for 10 days) alone treatment; Cis + NG (20 or 40 mg/kg b.w., i.p daily for 10 days) and Cis+NG-Ox (20 or 40 mg/kg b.w., i.p daily for 10 days) combination treatment. At the end of the study total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels, total oxidant status (TOS), lipid peroxidation (LPO), total thiol, catalase (CAT) were studied in homogenate kidney. Peripheral lymphocyte cell DNA damage was investigated with comet assay Results: The results suggest that Cis induces oxidative stress resulting in increased TOS and LPO reduction thiol, TAC and CAT in kidney and increased Peripheral lymphocyte cell DNA damage. The treatment with naringenin and naringenin oxime alone or with Cis treatment showed a protective effect against the toxic influence of CP on peroxidation of the membrane lipids and an altering of the total thiol status in the kidney of rats. From our results we conclude that naringenin and naringenin oxime functions as a potent antioxidant and suggest that it can control CP-induced nephrotoxicity and genototoxicity and NG-Ox was found more protective than that of NG on cisplatin induced toxicity in rats.

Introduction: Oxidative damage is considered to play a pivotal role in ageing, several degenerative diseases, and carcinogenesis. Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer, resulting in over 1.3 million deaths each year worldwide. Accurate and reliable determination of superoxide radicals has been widely investigated using spectrophotometric, electrochemical, amperometric, polarimetric, piezoelectric technologies. Among these methods, electrochemical detection is a most promising approach to achieve accurate, separate and rapid superoxide radicals monitoring with using biosensor system. Materials and Methods: We used a new technic for detecting superoxide radicals in samples. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme immobilized on the surface of gold electrode with the help of gelatin, bovin serum albumin (BSA) and glutaraldehyde (GA) crosslinker. For the biosensor preparing benzoquinone selected as a mediator in working buffer and measurements were carried out at \u00c00.7 V. Result: For the optimization studies, effect of the BSA, gelatin, glutaraldehyde, pH, buffer concentration on biosensor response. Characterization of the biosensor commitment to the work process and answer reproducibility were evaluated. The analytical characteristic of the biosensor were evaluated by measuring the steady state current response to superoxide radical concentrations. The electrochemical response of the enzyme electrode was linearity gradually leveled of at higher concentration. We found that crosslinking of the SOD (E.C.1.15.1.1) with glutaraldehyde could be achieved over a wide range of relative mole ratios in 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.5, glutaraldehyde concentration of %2.5. Discuss and Conclusion: In this study, a new technique for developed SOD biosensors has been developed, which features effective combination of SOD/Gelatin/BSA/GA modified electrode, trapping of SOD and glutaraldehyde cross-linking. This technique is reliable and cost effective.",

We have identified possible IRF4 binding regions in loci with known key roles in development of melanocytes from neural-crest cells. One such key factor is MITF, which is the master regulator in melanocyte development and also plays critical roles in melanoma. Integrating ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data suggests IRF4 as a transcriptional regulator of genes related to progression of melanoma. Objectives: Aim of this study was to evaluate prognostic importance of selected laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein (CRP), Gama GlutamilTransferaz, ferritin (FER), potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, Aspartat aminotransferaz, Alanin aminotransferaz (ALT), IFN-c, IL-6, TNF-a) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Material and Methods: 20 patients with NSCLC who were treated with Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) prospectively evaluated. All patients were newly diagnosed tumour. Heparinized blood samples were taken from the patients before and after the completion of CRT. FER analyzed by chemiluminescence method on Beckman Coulter DxI 800; IFN-c, IL-6, TNF-a were analyzed with ELISA kits (Boster Biological Technology) and other biochemical parameters analyzed on Abbott Architect c16000. Post-CRT and pre-CRT levels compared with survival. Results: The LR Cox regression analysis revealed that Pre-CRT Ferritin was significantly associated with survival of patients with NSCLC (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.007, P = 0.023, 95%CI; 1.001-1.013). It was also demonstrated by LR Cox regression analysis, high levels of Pre-CRT CRP was associated with worse outcome of patients (HR = 1.017, 95%CI;1.001-1.032, P = 0.035). After CRT, mean ALT level was determined as 16.71. There was survival difference in NSCLC patients with high Post-CRT ALT (HR = 0.912, 95%CI; 0.841-0.990, P = 0.027). Conclusions: There exists a clinically relevant relationship between Pre-CRT FER concentration and the prognosis of survival in patients with NSCLC. Elevated FER is the result of inflammation rather than body iron overload. Ferritin showed negative correlation with survival so it could be a useful biomarker to indicate bad prognosis of the patients with NSCLC. Additionally, CRP which is easy to detect and feasible for the use in the routine clinical practice should be considered in the prognosis of NSCLC patients.

Epigenetic therapy tries to reverse the aberrations followed to the disruption of the balance of the epigenetic signaling ways through the use of natural and synthetic compounds, active on specific targets, such as DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). We previously synthesized some benzoxazole and benzamide derivatives which might have anticancer activities on account of their heterocyclic structure. Our studies showed that not only these compounds caused selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells (HeLa) with little or no toxicity on normal cells (L929) but also were not genotoxic.

Cancer-related inflammation leads to the miR-NAome and epigenome shifts contributing to the tumour promotion and progression. Lysine acetylation is one of the key mechanisms to regulate chromatin structure and transcriptional activation. Acetyl-lysine modifications are recognized by bromodomains, which are small interaction modules found on diverse proteins including histones. Among these acetyl-lysine reader proteins is the family of the BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) proteins which contain tandem bromodomains (BD1 and BD2). The recent discovery of potent and specific inhibitors for the BET family proteins has stimulated intensive research activity in diverse therapeutic areas, especially in oncology, where BET proteins regulate the expression of key oncogenes and anti-apoptootic proteins. Several BET inhibitors are currently in clinical trials and reported to exhibit promising clinical activities. However, pleiotropic nature of BET proteins regulating tissue-specific transcription has raised safety concerns and suggested that attempts should be made for domain-specific targeting. Here, we report the recent progress in the development of BET inhibitors in Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT). We have identified the BET inhibitors with a novel scaffold different from the previously reported diazepine and azepine scaffolds and specific for first bromodomains (BD1s). A medicinal chemistry effort is currently made to optimize the pharmacokinetic properties of these lead compounds for further drug development. The experimental data from the biochemical and cell-based assays for these BD1-selective BET inhibitors will be presented. Family of small C-terminal domain serine phosphatases (SCP), which includes CTDSPL, CTDSP1, and CTDSP2, plays a regulatory role in a number of vital processes. In particular, it is shown that CTDSPL is capable to activate the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) which is well-known tumor suppressor and one of the key cell cycle regulators. Although the question on whether CTDSP1 and CTDSP2 dephosphorylate Rb is open, high similarity of sequences and three-dimensional structures of phosphatases may indicate the similar function of these enzymes.",

Cancer is a disease that includes heterogenic and complex molecular changes. Anti-carcinogenic effects of Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, have been proved in a variety of cancer cells. Considering the effects of Resveratrol, the influence of the signal transduction pathways in the presence or absence of p53 of colon cancer cells is gaining importance. Our aim was to investigate the effects of Resveratrol in the presence or absence of p53 on cell viability, apoptotic cell death ratio and fold changes of proliferative or anti-proliferative gene expressions, which may have important effects on colon cancer, in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells. IC50 doses of Resveratrol were determined by WST-1 assay. The apoptotic cell death ratios in treatments of Resveratrol were determined by Annexin-V-FITC/PI assay for flow cytomety . The changes of CCND1, FRA1, PPARD, EGFR,  BIRC5, PCNA, MCL1, STAT3, FOS, JUN, P27, ATF4,  TRAIL, PUMA, GADD45A, RB1, FASLG, TNF, SOCS3 , STAT1 gene expressions were evaluated by Real Time PCR. All data were statistically analyzed by Student's t test. Our research has revealed that Resveratrol (60 lM) causes decrease in cell viability and increase in apoptotic cell death in HCT116 p53(+/+) and HCT116 p53(\u00c0/\u00c0) cells significantly (P < 0.05). The fold changes of the gene expressions have shown that Resveratrol has significant (P < 0.05) and different effects on the expressions of the genes related with the existence of p53 in HCT116 cell lines. Therefore we proposed that Resveratrol might show proliferative or apoptotic effects related with p53 mutation of colon cancer cells and we predicted that unconscious consumption of Resveratrol in colon cancer patient might cause adverse effects. Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. Alterations in methylation profiles of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) have been recognized as a key mechanism in colorectal cancers. In the current study, we investigated the hypermethylation status of 25 TSGs in colorectal cancer tissues. Materials and Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples obtained from patients with CRC. Methylation specific-multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) technique was used to assess the methylation status of 25 TSGs. The findings were evaluated in terms of age, mortality, survival, positive lymph node status, lymphovascular invasion, and perineural invasion. Results: Hypermethylation-detected patients and hypermethylation-undetected patients were called as group 1 and group 2, respectively. Hypermethylation was detected in ATM, CDKN2A, and GATA5 genes. Mortality rate was (12.5%) in group 1 and group 2 (P > 0.05). Mean 5-years survival rate in group 1 was 45 AE 3 months and mean 5-years survival in group 2 was 44 AE 3 months (P > 0.05). Positive median lymph node count was 10 AE 2 for group 1 and 5 AE 1 for group 2 and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Frequencies of perineural invasion and lymphovascular invasion rate in two groups were 25% (P > 0.05). Discussion and Conclusion: Our findings suggest that TSG hypermethylation found in CRC patients may increase the lymph node metastasis. Further investigations with larger sample size are required to support our results. Boron (B) is known to be important for cell replication and development, but the underlying mechanism remains obscure. Recently B has also become important in some specific anticancer processes. Some recent reports advise using of some Boron compounds for the treatment of specific forms of cancer. For instance, Boron-based drugs (Bortezomib) are now being developed for use as therapeutic agents with anticancer activities and several other boron-based compounds are in various phases of clinical trials. It has been shown that Bortezomib disrupts the regulation of cell cycle and induces apoptosis in both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies except for colon carcinoma. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and the second in women, accounting for 10% of all tumour types worldwide. Cytotoxic effects of boron compounds on CRC cells and changing of its effects related with p53 mutation, which is mutated 50% of cancer cases, have not take part in literature yet. For this purpose; the aim of the study was designed to investigate the effects of Borax pentahydrate and Disodium pentaborate decahydrate compounds on cell viability, apoptotic cell death ratio and PARP protein expressions in p53 (+/+) and p53 (\u00c0/\u00c0) HCT116 colon carcinoma cells lines. The effects of the Boron compounds on cell viability were assessed by XTT assay and apoptotic effects and PARP protein expression of the compounds were evaluated by flow cytometry and western blot analysis respectively. Our results showed that Borax pentahydrate (6 mM) and Disodium pentaborate decahydrate (12 mM) significantly causes nearly 50% reduction of cell viability at 48 h (P < 0.05). Apoptotic cell death ratios and PARP expressions revealed that both of the compounds might have a potential for a candidate of anticancer agent. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a significant event for metastasis, and could be mediated by several pathways such as PI3K/Akt, MAP kinases and many epigenetic regulators. SATB2 is an epigenetic regulator involved in EMT and osteoblastic differentiation. Since preliminary results indicate that there is a crosstalk between p38 and Akt pathways in NSCLC cells, we aimed to determine whether this crosstalk has a regulatory effects on EMT and SATB2 expression in NSCLC cells.",

The most common causes of lung cancer are tobacco smoke, radon gas, asbestos, air pollution, and genetic factors. Nitric oxide (NO) has potential mutagenic and carcinogenic activity and may play important roles in lung cancer. Endothelial NO, synthesized from L-arginine by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), inhibits apoptosis and promotes angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. The aim of the present study was to examine the possible relationship between eNOS gene intron 4 VNTR and exon 7-G894T (Glu298Asp) The stressful ecosystems exert strong adaptive pressure and proteins that facilitate these adaptation processes are candidate drug targets. Nucleotides are the core of biochemical pathway required for cancer cell growth and replication and genetic changes will lead in oscillation in their pools. Although it is questionable whether the Warburg effect actually causes cancer, impairing Dglucose uptake and metabolism induces oxidative metabolism. Lproline (Lproline) homeostasis is critical in a constellation of human diseases, in parametabolic linkage between cancer, epigenetics (Phang et al. 2013 ) and bioenergetics (Pallotta 2013) where degradation and biosynthesis are robustly affected by oncogenes or suppressor genes that can modulate intermediates involved in epigenetic regulation. Lproline-fueled mitochondrial metabolism involves the oxidative conversion to L-glutamate by a flavin dependent Lproline Dehydrogenase/Oxidase and a NAD +dependent L-D 1 -pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae an important test tube, Put1p and Put2p respectively help cells to respond to changes in the nutritional microenvironment by initiating Lproline breakdown after mitochondrial uptake (Pallotta 2014) . In this preclinical study, low molecular weight compounds were tested for inhibiting Lproline mitochondrial transport and Put1p/Put2p catalytic activities. Thus, in seeking for natural bioactive compounds targeting Lproline pathway and its substrate channeling (Becker's group 2016), we report data using in silico screening and in vitro researches in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with genetic background ATCC18790 but different phenotypic landscape induced by nutritional stress/ pH changes. Cells vitality, D\u03a8 measurements, NAD(P) + /NAD(P) H pool and flavine turnover were determined in spectrofluorimeter microplater reader and via HPLC (Pallotta et al. 1998 (Pallotta et al. , 1999 (Pallotta et al. , 2004 Pallotta 2011; Di Martino Pallotta 2011) thus in supporting of future cancer therapies with decreasing side effects.",

The Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify the influence of factors related to survival. (TNM stage, tumor differentiation, age, tumour size and LMR) Results: Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that LMR was superior to PLR and NLR as a predictive factor in patients with colorectal cancer. The cutoff value for LMR was 1.82. Cancer-specific survival was not significantly different between the high-and low-LMR groups (P = 0.786). Age was identified as independent prognostic factor in colorectal cancer (hazard ratio: 3.50; 95% confidence interval: 3.14-351.82; P = 0.004). Discussion and Conclusion: Our preliminary study showed that the LMR was not an independent prognostic factor in CRC patients, but additional large sample sized prospective studies will be needed to confirm these findings. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of luteolin treatment on enzymatic activity of arginase, and ornithine and polyamine levels (putrescine, spermidine spermine) in serum and cancer tissues of Ehrlich ascites breast cancer model. Balb/c female mice were divided randomly into following groups: healthy control, healthy treatment, cancer control, treatment 1 and treatment 2. 0.2 mL Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was inoculated subcutaneously to medial part of left hind leg. Healthy treatment and treatment 1 groups, and the treatment group 2 were given 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose of luteolin, intraperitoneally, for a 12 days period, respectively. Luteolin has a hydroxylated flavonoid structure and shows potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties. Luteolin not only leads to cell death in various tumors by suppressing cell survival pathways and stimulating apoptotic pathways, but also sensitize them to cytotoxic therapy. Supporting various previous studies, tumor implantation to healthy mice resulted in statistically significant elevation of serum arginase and polyamine levels (P < 0.05) indicating the tumor cells as the main source of this production. Furthermore, luteolin treatment abolished this increase in serum arginase and polyamine levels (P < 0.05).",

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Around 30-40% of HCC patients are diagnosed at an early stage of the disease. Hepatic resection, liver transplantation are common strategies in HCC treatment. Even if, most of the patients present advanced-stage tumors and have a restricted survival rate. For the reason, resistance against existing tumor stress conditions have been demonstrated in HCC. Hypoxia, hyperglycemia are general stress sources in HCC and result in aggressive cell phenotype, resistance to apoptosis and therapeutic drugs. Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) regulates cellular responses under stress conditions. Over-expression of TXNIP results activation of oxidative stress and apoptosis. In cancer models TXNIP is considered as a tumor suppressor gene. However, its role in the development, progression of HCC and mechanisms behind it warrant further investigation.",

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes and Huntington are the most important types of this disease. Understanding the mechanisms of fibril formation and ways of treatment can be useful in reducing this type of disorder. In this project, the fibrillation of carbonic anhydrase protein was investigated as a model. Carbonic anhydrase creates two stable intermediated known as pre-molten and molten globule, in different pH solution. This protein at pH between pH 3-4 molten globule structures was formed while the pre-molten form took place under pH 3. In our tests at pH 3.5 when the protein in molten globule structures only the amorphous aggregates were formed. Instead, at pH 2.4 in pre-molten globule structure amyloid fibrils formed in the protein. There some reports, indicated the protein from pre-molten globule structure go toward amyloid assembly. Even intrinsically unstructured proteins such as alpha-Synuclein first took a structure similar to pre-molten globule and then made amyloid fibrils. It seems pre-molten globule structure have the major role in promoting to amyloid fibrils. Perhaps drugs that prevent the formation of premolten globule structure have an important role in inhibiting amyloid fibrils. Identification of compounds preventing the biochemical changes that underlie the epileptogenesis process and understanding the mechanism of their action is of great importance. We have previously shown that myo-Inositol (MI) daily treatment for 28 days prevents certain biochemical changes that are triggered by kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE), [1, 2] . However in these studies we have not detected any effects of MI on the first day after SE. In the presented study we broadened our research and focused on KA induced other early molecular and morphological changes and influence of MI treatment on these changes. The increase in the amount of voltage-dependent anionic channel-1 (VDAC-1), mitochondrial-plasma membrane cofilin and caspase-3 activity was observed in the hippocampus of KA treated rats. Administration of MI 4 h later after KA treatment abolishes these changes, whereas under the same time schedule diazepam treatment has no significant influence. The number of neuronal cells in CA1 and CA3 subfields of hippocampus is decreased after KA induced SE and MI post-treatment significantly lessens this reduction. No significant changes are observed in the neocortex.",

Neurobiol. vol. 33, no Extracellular deposits of amyloid-b peptide (Ab) in brain parenchyma via proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) are one of the typical characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These aggregates mainly occur as a result of an increase in Ab production or a decrease in its degradation. It was found that the neurotoxicity of Ab aggregates is accelerated by acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Besides, Ab-AChE complex has a prominent neurodegenerative effect in brain. Thus, cholinesterase inhibition and preventing Ab production are current treatment strategies for AD. Recent studies have shown that methylene blue (MetB), a cholinesterase inhibitor with phenothiazine structure, inhibits the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Azure B, the major metabolite of MetB, has been shown to inhibit AChE and BChE with IC50 values of 0.486 lM and 1.99 lM, respectively. In the present study, we tested whether azure B, may effectively lower the levels of Ab 40/42 . We treated Chinese hamster ovary cells, which stably express human wild type APP and presenilin-1 (PS70) with 0-15 mM azure B or vehicle for 24 h. To determine the effect of azure B treatment on Ab 40/42 levels, we used separate sandwich-based ELISAs and normalized to total protein levels, determined by BCA protein assay. Azure B treated PS70 cells were also assessed by propidium iodide in flow cytometry for cellular toxicity.",

Molecular chaperones are a family of proteins that are believed to have ability for inhibiting protein aggregation. In the present study the effect of different concentrations of green synthesis silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from Pulicaria undulate L. on the amyloid formation of a-lactalbumin (a-LA) and chaperone action of a-casein have been investigated. The effects of the AgNPs were determined using light scattering absorption, ThT binding assay, intrinsic fluorescence assay, ANS binding assay, CD spectroscopy and SDS-PAGE. Light scattering and ThT assay results showed that AgNPs have the ability in preventing aggregation of a-LA in a concentration-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, SDS-PAGE results represented that by increasing the concentration of AgNPs the adsorption and interaction between AgNPs and protein have increased. Light scattering and ThT assay results, also, revealed that the amyloid fibrilation decreased in the presence of both AgNPs and a s -casein compared to presence of a s -casein alone. Fluorescence results, however, show that AgNPs have no effect on the chaperone ability of a-casein and in fact they perform their protection of protein aggregation action independently. Consistent with the above experiments, CD spectroscopy also revealed that AgNPs have decreased structural changes in reduced a-LA in absence and presence of a-casein, both the tertiary and the secondary structure of the proteins. Our finding represented that AgNPs have preventing effects on protein aggregation and have no effect on the chaperone ability of a s -casein. In the main, results of this study show that biosynthesized AgNPs mediated by >Pulicaria undulate L. maybe could be affective as a therapeutic agent for inhibiting aggregation in treatment of amyloidosis disorders. PINK1 is a mitochondrial kinase with multiple cellular functions. While loss-of-function mutations of PINK1 gene lead to early onset Parkinson's disease, its over-expresion is associated with cancer development. Parkinson is a multifactorial neurogenerative disease, with a complex aethiology including various cellular stressors. It is now known that genotoxic stress also triggers the release of soluble factors able to induce changes in neighboring cells enhancing the initial lesions, process known as bystander phenomena. Althrough the mechanisms are still unclear, recent studies point towards a role for mitochondria in this process.",

Synthetic peptides were intranasally administrated into olfactory bulbectomized (OBE) mice with neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's type. We have found that only administration of RAGE fragment (60-76) effectively prevents the OBE murine memory from impairment, leads to decrease of beta-amyloid level and blocks the development of neuronal pathology in the brain of experimental mice. Six overlapping fragments of RAGE (60-76) peptide were synthesized in order to find a site, responding for the therapeutic effect. Tests in OBE mice carried out with these fragments showed that only the N-terminal part of the molecule is responsible for preventing OBE mice memory from impairment. All fragments which do not include N-terminal 60-61 dipeptide have been fully inactive in these experiments. We have proposed that active peptides can interact with beta-amyloid or S100B protein preventing these ligands from binding with RAGE. This interaction can inhibit the development of neurodegeneration. The aim of this study was to examine effects of social isolation, enriched environment and exercise on learning in rats. The study included 36 female 25 day old Wistar rats. The rats were randomly divided into four different groups; control, exercise, social isolation and the enriched environment groups. The social isolation group and the enriched environment group were housed under their specific conditions and the exercise group and the control group were housed in standard conditions during 6 weeks. The rats in the exercise group swam for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, the rats were evaluated in the Morris water maze. Brain and blood samples were taken and the hippocampus tissue was dissected. BDNF and NGF levels were measured in these samples. In conlusion, while enriched environment was a positive effect on spatial learning, social isolation was a negative effect on spatial learning and increase thigmotactic behaviors. According to the analysis results NGF and BDNF levels in the hippocampus and plasma did not change with environmental conditions and exercise. Time of exposure to social isolation, procedures of the enriched environment, time of exposure to the environment, type and duration of exercise and gender may affect the results. Alzheimer's disease (AD) was characterized by dementia that typically begins with subtle recognition failure and poor memory. It slowly becomes more severe and, eventually, incapacitating. The cholinergic system seemed particularly susceptible to synapse loss, especially in cortical regions associated with memory and executive function (1) . Recent studies showed that the main cause of the loss of cognitive functions in AD patients was a continuous decline of the cholinergic neurotransmission in cortical and other regions of the human brain (2) . Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are hydrolytic enzymes that act on acetylcholine (ACh) to terminate its actions in the synaptic cleft by cleaving the neurotransmitter to choline and acetate. Both enzymes are present in the brain and detected in neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques. It was suggested that AChE predominates in the healthy brain, with BChE considered to play aminor role in regulating brain ACh levels. However, BChE activity progressively increases in patients with AD, while AChE activity remains unchanged or declines. Both enzymes therefore represent legitimate therapeutic targets for ameliorating the cholinergic deficit considered to be responsible for the declines in cognitive, behavioral, and global functioning characteristics of AD (3). We initiated a study to screen their acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) inhibitory activities, which are the key enzymes taking place in pathogenesis of AD. Newly synthesized chiral benzimidazole derivatives with thioure structure showed IC 50 values in the range of 11.55-36.00 nM for AChE.",

Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative progressive brain disease with increasing prevalence in aging population. The etiopathogenesis involves many cellular procesess, but is not fully elucidated yet. Treatment of PD is based on levodopa and dopamine agonists, but MAO-B inhibitors, COMT inhibitors, amantadine or anticholinergics may be used as initial monotherapy or as adjuvant therapy. Treatment related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are frequent, but cannot be predicted and/or prevented. Non-motor ADRs, such as nausea, somnolence, hallucinations and hypotension are frequent in dopamine agonist therapy, while dyskinesias along with motor fluctuations are the most common late ADRs with levodopa. The aim of our study is to combine clinical data with genetic and epigenetic biomarkers in the algorithm for personalized approach to PD management. Materials and Methods: We are planning a clinical study to assess the combined impact of selected clinical, genetic and epigenetic factors on the progression of PD, ADRs and treatment response. Our study will have a retrospective and prospective arm. We will collect peripheral blood samples of PD patients and clinical data. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes involved in dopamine, neurotransmitter and drug metabolism and transport, receptors and signalling pathways will be genotyped. SNPs within inflammatory, neurodevelopmental, antioxidative defense, synaptic transmission and immune response pathways will also be analysed. In the prospective arm we will isolate the exosomes and check their miRNA content at the time of diagnosis and after the treatment initiation. The combined effects of clinical, genetic and epigenetic factors will be analyzed using lasso penalized regression analysis. Conclusions: We hope to identify genetic and/or epigenetic biomarkers that may predict progression of PD, ADRs and treatment response and may support personalized tratment of PD. Most evidence indicates that G protein-coupled receptors form heteromers between them and with other receptors. By allosteric mechanisms, them acquire a multiplicity of unique pharmacological and functional properties. Recently, we discovered that dopamine D1 receptors (D1R) and histamine H3 receptors (H3R) form heteromers through which H3R ligands can inhibit D1R function. D1Rs also physically interact and modulate ionotropic glutamate NMDA receptors (NMDAR). In the present work, we investigated if NMDAR, D1R and H3R form a heterotrimeric complex in brain.",

Defects of mitochondrial trafficking are common problem in many neurodegenerative diseases. Its dysregulation can contribute to changes in bioenergetics profile of the cell and can lead to cell death. In our study we investigate distribution of mitochondria and their transport in primary fibroblasts derived from patients with sporadic form of Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases. Our data revealed that in the most cases the velocity of mitochondrial movement is lower in AD and PD cells in comparison to the control. The most intense differences between AD, PD patients and control group are observed in the case of movement of large mitochondria. Owing to the fact that mitochondrial trafficking depends on mitochondrial state, we investigated the 'age' of mitochondria. We observed a diminished mitochondrial turnover in AD and PD fibroblast. Evaluation of the mitochondrial distribution within the cell in all 3 groups (AD, PD and control) showed that in the perinuclear area are accumulated 'old' and 'worn out' mitochondria, probably dedicated to remove from the cell. Because mitochondrial biogenesis, shape and size depends on fusion/fission proteins we assessed their level within the cell. To summarise, our results revealed alterations in mitochondrial trafficking in fibroblasts derived from patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases in comparison to the healthy control cells.

We compared different stress conditions on brain BDNF levels, in social isolation (SIT) and predator scent tests (PST) in rats. BDNF levels in cortex, hippocampus and amygdala were compared, effects of chronic fluoxetine (FLU) treatment were evaluated. Methods: 128 rats were used. For SIT, animals were kept individually for 1 month and for PST, rats were exposed to dirty cat litter for 10 min at the first day of 1 month stress. FLU was given (5 mg/kg, ip) through stress. Controls, stress and treated groups were evaluated in elevated plus maze (EPM), anxiety scores were calculated. Brain BDNF levels were determined in cortex, hippocampus and amygdala by Western blot. P < 0.05 were considered significant. Results: SIT and PST induced anxiety in both male and female rats, females having greater anxiety scores than males (P < 0.05). FLU restored anxiety scores in both sexes (P < 0.01) in two settings. Male and female rats exhibited reduced cortical BDNF levels in SIT (P < 0.001). PST reduced cortical BDNF in females, but increased in males. Hippocampal BDNF expression was lowered in SIT (P < 0.01) and PST (P < 0.001) in both sexes. Female rats had 40% lower BDNF expression than males in amygdala in SIT. FLU did not restore cortical BDNF in females in both tests, but reduced incresed BDNF levels in males (P < 0.001). FLU did not restore reduced brain BDNF in males in hippocampus and amygdala, but restored in hippocampus, in females. Discussion: Our findings indicate that sex differences must be considered in studies related to mood disorders of animal models, and suggest that BDNF expression in different brain regions are altered differentially in a gender-dependent manner in rats. Antianxiety effect of FLU is not mediated through increasing BDNF activity in cortex in both genders. Increased BDNF in hippocampus and amygdala may reflect its antidepressant effect in female rats, but not in males. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are special forms of neural extracellular matrix found around neuron bodies and neurites. Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein1 (HAPLN1) is one of the major elements of PNNs. HAPLN1 interacts with tenascins and aggrecan which are other essential PNNs components. In most of neurodegenerative disorders caused by neuritogenesis defects, disrupted PNNs structure and decreased expression of HAPLN1 were observed. However, the role of HAPLN1 in neural differentiation is unknown.",

The risk of malignancy is increased in NF1, wound healing is delayed and keloid formation is frequent. Because multiple tissues are involved in malignant and non-malignant manifestations of NF1, we considered the mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) carrying the NF1 mutation might play a role in the microenvironment. MSCs affect the biological behaviour of other cells: they alter their proliferation, apoptosis and migration through various secreted growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, or by direct contact. We examined the MSC of NF1 patients. Methods: The adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential of MSCs from NF1 and healthy subjects was examined in vitro and by RT-PCR. MSC's migration potential was measured in the scracth assay. MSCs' interaction with Schwann cells and their effect on tumorigenesis was examined in co-culture by apoptosis markers on Flow Cytometry. Results: NF1-MSCs' adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential was lower than healthy controls as assessed by staining Aizerin Red S and Oil Red O and RT-PCR for osteopontin and collagen1. MSCs cultured from dermal neurofibroma showed faster closing of the scratch compared to the same patient's normal and caf e au lait skin. On the other hand, MSCs obtained from plexiform neurofibroma healed late, while MSCs derived from the same patient's caf e au lait skin showed the fastest healing. Hepatic encephalopathy with ammonium ions accumulation is accompanied by some disorder in the brain due to toxic material concentration being usually detoxified in the liver.

There are a number of programs for electronic media that emphasize laboratory-related skills. Some of these are appropriate for medical students in the clinical years. Programs that teach skills in common laboratory procedures, such as interpretation of peripheral blood smears and microscopic examination of urine sediment, have been shown to improve student performance.",

In our study, different concentrations of rat spleen homogenates (25, 50, 75 lg/well) and 50 lg protein/well of human lung and ovary cancer cell lysates were used. The proteins were seperated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, incubated with specific b-actin antibody and then with HRP-conjugated antibody. Protein bands were detected with ECL and densitometric analysis of proteins was quantified by ImageJ software. Differences in protein band intensities were compared using one way ANOVA.A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

It has been proved that its mutants are involved in development of neurological diseases and some types of tumor. Directed drug design needs knowledge of details of the threedimensional channel structure. The members of the Kv10-12 subfamilies are characterized by extremely long N-and C-terminal intracellular tails, which possess a number of structural domains. The N-terminal PAS domain in Kv10 plays an important role in activation, and is thought to alter the rate of deactivation, possibly by binding at or near the S4-S5 linker at the inner mouth of the pore. Here we present an improved 3D structure of the truncated human Kv10.2 channel, obtained by single particle EM. This channel lacks its cytoplasmic PAS domain but it still forms tetrameric particles. Earlier we showed that the full length Kv10.2 channel is build according to the 'hanging gondola' type, and its cytoplasmic and transmembrane parts are connected by linkers. The cytoplasmic part includes the interconnecting PAS and cNBD domains. Deletion of the PAS domain leads to the conformational change in the cytoplasmic part of the channel. For interpretation of the 3D structures we used homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation. There are several templates available to the moment including eag domain-CNBHD complex of the mouse EAG1 channel, full-length Shaker potassium channel Kv1.2, C-linker/CNBHD of zELK channels and others. But there are still no templates for many fragments that led to necessity of partial de novo modeling. Analysis of molecular trajectory allowed estimating dynamical characteristics of channel, supposing interdomain interactions. Results of the conducted investigation have a great interest at both the academic and the industrial levels. The objective of this task program is to enable students to gain scientific attitude and skills for them to be able to deal with the problems they'll confront in future research careers. It's been emphasized in various studies that medical students are keen on conducting scientific research, and it's been stated that they need to be supported in this respect, as they lack the adequate fund of knowledge.",

For miR-181 transfected cells, we found 25-40% decrease of expression of ITSN1-S 3 0 UTR-bearing construction. For other miRs we did not obtain strong reproducible effect in luciferase assay. These data may confirm miR-181 target site in 3 0 UTR of ITSN1-S mRNA but needed additional research. Objective: Stroke is an acute neurological disorder that is mostly caused by ischemia in central neural system. 30% of stroked patients lose their life in 1 year, and remaining 1/3 of the living patients continue to their lives as dependent to others. NIHSS and mRS are two scales which are used in prognosis studies because they can show stroke intensity and after stroke functional recovery. microRNA's which have effects on transcription and posttranscription gene regulations are small RNA molecules. Their roles have been investigated on pathophysiology and treatment of diseases. In this study, it was aimed to detect changes in blood serum levels of mir-146a, -155, -210, 181b, -31, 126, -92a and let-7f of ischemic stroke patients and to investigate role in predicting prognosis Methods: 21 patients diagnosed by acute ischemic stroke admitted to neurology service of G\u20ac oztepe Hospital and 16 healthy individual were included in the study. After stroke patients' blood samples were taken periodically in 1st day, 1st week, and 3rd month, and at the same time NIHSS and mRS scores were determined. Set 8 miRNA blood serum levels were measured by RT PCR Results: When compared to the control group, we found that after stroke 1st day peripheric blood levels of miR-146a,-31,-92a and let-7f were significantly low; when 1st week and 1st day serum records were compared there was a significant increase in miR-126 level; and when 1st week and 3rd month records were compared we noted that there was a significant increase in miR-146a,-126 and let-7f levels. From prognosis point of view; after ischemic stroke measurements showed that miR-181b in the 1st day, miR-146a and miR-210 in the 1st week showed positive significant correlation with 3rd month mRS scores (P = 0.002, P = 0.05, P = 0.002, respectively) Conclusion: According to the outcomes of this study, after stroke 1st day miR-181b, 1st week miR-146a and 1st week miR-210 levels can be stipulated to use in predicting patients' 3rd month prognosis P-01.03.3-004 Inhibitory RNA aptamer against lambda cI repressor showed the transcriptional activator activity S.

The present study was designed (i) to investigate the miRNA expression profile in human atherosclerotic plaques from peripheral arteries aorta as compared to non-atherosclerotic left internal mamary artery (LIMA); (ii) to examine the expression levels of miRNA in whole with correlation miRNAs of aorta tissue. Material and Methods: Thirty-one patients with CAD were enrolled in study. LIMA and aorta tissue samples were obtained during coronary artery bypass surgery. Whole blood samples were collected before CABG surgery. Each patient with CAD was obtained from whole blood, aorta and LIMAs tissues. These tissue samples were immediately soaked in RNALater solution and homogenized using a MagnaLyser. The RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent and the miRNEasy\u00d2 Mini-Kit. The expression profiles of 738 miRNAs were evaluated using highthroughput qRT-PCR. Results: We found that miR-497-3p was expressed only in aorta. miR-431-5p and 433 were expressed both aorta and whole blood. 6 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in aorta when compared to LIMA tissue (FC > 2). 59 miRNAs were significantly down-regulated in aorta compared to LIMA. Conclusion: In conclusion, our study suggests that miR-497-3p, miR-431-5p and 433 might be a potential for cardiovascular disease development.

It is important to exhibit the miRNA combinations should be effective on cancer cells' viability. The prospect combinations were determined which is crucial to develop new strategies for cancer treatment. Competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) act as molecular sponges for the same pool of microRNAs through their miRNA response elements (MRE), titrate miRNA levels and thereby regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. SMAD interacting protein 1 (SIP1), a member of the ZEB family is a regulator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, which is active during embryogenesis and tumor invasion and metastasis. Hence, we investigated the regulation of SIP1 by ceRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Among hundreds of SIP1 ceRNAs listed at Competive Endogenous mRNA Database (ceRDB), 14 transcripts (PTEN, ZEB1, PTCH1, CREB5, ACVR2B, ENAH, ROBO2, ERBB4, E2F3, FOXO1, RICTOR, KLF3, ETS1, CDK6) sharing at least 9 common MRE sites with SIP1 were selected and their expression in 9 HCC cell lines were determined by qRT-PCR. ETS1 was found to be highly correlated with SIP1 in HCC. Furthermore, repressing SIP1 expression by shRNA in HCC cells resulted in decreased expression of ETS1, PTEN and ZEB1. Our results suggest a possible bidirectional and post-transcriptional regulation of SIP1 and its ceR-NAs in HCC.",

Background: Noncoding RNA are known to be crucial molecules with diverse regulatory roles in neural oncology and neurodegenerative disease. The recent study suggested that lncRNA ANRIL play role in the development of neuroblastoma and Alzheimer disease via binding disease-specific microRNAs. Material and Methods: We used LncRNADisease, HMDD v2.0, Mir2disease to predict lncRNA-and miR-associated disease in our study. In addition, we utilize TardetScan to search lncRNA-miRNA interaction. Results: Disruptions of lncRNA ANRIL expression (also named as CDKN2B-AS, locus CDKN2a/b (INK4/ARF), chromosome 9p21) have been associated with the development of neuroblastoma and Alzheimer disease. Here, we predicted interactions between noncoding transcripts encoded by locus CDKN2a/b and their molecular partners -microRNA. ANRIL can act as decoy while containing sequences that mimic miRNA target sites to titer these miRs away from their primary targets thereby act as molecular sponge. Using TargetScan 7.0, we predicted target sites for hsa-mir-15-p/16-p/195-p/424-p/497-p/6838-p and hsa-mir-125-5p/4319 in ANRIL 3 0 UTR. Then, we used HMDD v2.0 and Mir2Disease databases to define if any of these miRs participate in Alzheimer disease and neuroblastoma. According to both databases, miR-125 is implicated to Alzheimer disease and miR-15 to neuroblastoma. As soon as ANRIL participate in the development of both abovementioned disorders and can have microRNA sponge activity, it could potentially positively regulate miR-125 and miR-15 targets by competing with them for micro-RNA binding sites thus restoring the expression of target genes. In our further research we plan to experimentally validate predicted microRNA sites in ANRIL 3 0 UTR. Conclusions: We predicted sites for miR-125 and miR-15 in 3 0 UTR of ANRIL lncRNA that could uncover its possible sponge activity in the development of neuroblastoma and Alzheimer disease. Aim: Matrine excracted from saphora flavescens root and demonsrated that indicates pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effect in many types of cancer. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an acute form of leukemia, or cancer of the white blood cells which characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of lymphoblasts. miRNAs play important roles in deregulated cell death mechanisms. We aimed to investigate the effects of critical miRNAs during the development of matrine resistance on ALL cell line CCRF-CEM. Material-Method: CCRF-CEM cells were treated with different (0.5-3 mg/ml) concentrations for 72 h and cell viability measurements were carried out with xCELLigence device to determine the cytotoxic effects of Matrine. miRNAs were extracted from treated and untreated CCRF-CEM cells using the miRNA Isolation Kit. cDNA was synthesised using Allin-One First strand cDNA Synthesis Kit. Expressions of 44 selected miRNAs were analysed with miProfileTM Custom miRNA qPCR Array using the Applied Biosystem 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. Results: According to the cytotoxicity assay, it was determined that 'treatment with increasing concentrations of Matrine, decreased the viability of the CCRF-CEM cell line. Expression levels of 44 different miRNAs were studied for indicated passages in two replicates. Our results showed that hsa-miR-376b-3p (-37,099 fold, P = 0.008), hsamiR-106-3p (-16,6795 fold, P = 0.028), hsa-miR-20a-3p (-15,926 fold P = 0.0148), hsa-miR-519a-3p (-11,7398 fold, P = 0.00534), hsa-miR-204-5p (-10,9536 fold, P = 0.0012), hsamiR-30b-5p (-9,0631 fold, P = 0.0221), hsa-miR-15b-5p (-8,8971 fold, P = 0.0339), hsamiR-106b-5p (-8,8561 fold, P = 0.021), hsa-miR-885-3p (-8,6139 fold, P = 0.00006), hsamiR-30a-5p (-8,594 fold, P = 0.009) expression were decreased during the development of matrine resistance. Conclusion: These data suggested that especially hsa-miR-376b-3p plays a critical role in the matrine response. ERICD (E2F1-Regulated Inhibitor of Cell Death) is a newly found lncRNA. It is located at 8q24.3. It has two exons and its transcript size is 1745 bp. ERICD is regulated by E2F (transcription factor 2) and modulates the cellular response to DNA damage. ARID3A is a family member of the AT rich interaction domain (ARID) DNA-binding proteins that participate in diverse biological processes like development, cell cycle control, chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation. Both, ERICD and ARID3A have just opposite roles in apoptosis in case of DNA damage indicating a probability of reciprocal interaction between each other.

Wheat is an important agricultural crop with an over 615.8 million metric tons harvesting capacity annually. Drought and salinity are environmental stress factors that affect yield and quality of wheat, dramatically. There are different defense mechanisms against these stress conditions in plants. Altering gene expression profiles by microRNAs at post-transcriptional level is one of the most conserved mechanisms among plants. microRNAs are an extensive class of noncoding RNAs, approximately 22 nucleotide length which regulates the expression of genes by binding to the 3 0 -untranslated regions of specific mRNAs. microRNAs implicated under salt and drought stress have widely been reported in numerous plant species and wheat genomes in the last years; however, studies on einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum spp. monococcum) are not yet available. The goal of this study is identification of conserved microRNAs from einkorn wheat using next generation sequencing technology and bioinformatic analysis. In this study, small RNA molecules were extracted from pooled plant samples grown under normal, drought and salinity conditions. Sequencing analysis revealed 75 164 unique small RNA sequences obtained from 15 139 448 raw reads. After bioinformatic analysis based on comparative genomics approaches, we identified 168 putative mature microRNA sequences belonging to 142 distinct microRNA families. Since chromosomal sequence data is not available for Triticum monococcum spp. monococcum, we used available sequences from Triticum urartu, a close relative, as template to extract precursor microRNA sequences. 111 of precursor sequences showing 100% homology to Triticum urartu genome were analyzed for secondary structure prediction using Mfold software. Data provided in this study is critical to investigate transcriptional regulation of genes involved in stress metabolism in einkorn wheat.",

In the present study, we aimed to determine tissue and cell line distribution of VIM-AS1. Materials and Method: For the tissue expressions analysis, Human Total RNA Master Panel II (containing 20 different human tissue samples) was used. Total number 14 cancer cell lines and 5 normal cell lines included in the study. For the expression analysis RT-PCR and qPCR methods were used. Results: As a result, expression levels of VIM-AS1 were found to be tissue specific. Particularly, while VIM-AS1 was highly expressed in lung and thyroid gland tissues, its expression was not observed brain, stomach and adrenal gland tissues. Also, VIM-AS1 was also found to be differentially expressed in cancer cell lines. VIM-AS1 expression was found to be lost in CAL29, PC3, and HCT116 and highly diminished A549 cancer cells. Also, it is found to be highly expressed in BCPAP, PANC1 and BEAS2B cells. Discussion: Results of the current study suggest that VIM-AS1 may have significant role in the regulation of VIM gene in thyroid gland tissues, as it is highly expressed in both thyroid gland tissues and BCPAP thyroid cancer cells. Moreover, VIM-AS1 and VIM axis can be involved in the formation of lung tumors because VIM-AS1 was highly expressed in normal lung tissues and BEAS2B cells and expressed very low levels in A549 lung cancer cells.

To understand of the molecular mechanisms of cellular invasion is very important for fight against cancer mechanisms and first step of invasion is EMT. Cells change phenotypical and genotypical in EMT progress. In this study, we focussed on the explore molecular mechanism of TNF-alpha induced cellular invasion of NSCLC. We use western blot, qRT PCR and miRNA transfect methods for this purpose. We find that TNF-alfa treatment reduce the expression of PTEN and induce E cadherin expression in A549 cells. When we inhibit NF-kB activity by p65 targeted siRNA TNF-alpha can not reduce PTEN expression means that TNF-alpha inhibits PTEN expression through on NF-kB. Because TNF/NF-kB pathway change the transcriptional level of miR-548as and PTEN 3 0 untranslated region has recognition site for miR-548as. Therefore; we transfected A549 cells by miR-548as. miR-548as transfection leads to inhibition of PTEN expression.

Introduction: The corpus luteum (CL) is an ephemeral tissue whose regulated secretion of progesterone is essential for maintenance and/or timely termination of pregnancy in rodents. Our previous finding that CL of pregnant rats does not possess Fas/ FasL system suggests that this tissue may undergo autophagic, but not apoptotic, cell death during regression. We here investigated the presence of autophagic system in CL and its any implications in rodent pregnancy and parturition. Materials and Methods: LC3 (-I and -II) expression in CL was estimated by Western blot analysis in comparison with progesterone secretion and luteal mass throughout pregnancy. LC3 was also tested by immunocytochemistry. Functional implication of autophagy in this tissue was examined by local treatment with Bafilomycin A1 (autophagy and V-ATPase inhibitor, 6.23 pg/ 0.1 ml/ovary) on day 19 of pregnancy. Reproductive, biochemical, and morphological outcomes were evaluated. Results: While the expression of cytosol-associated LC3-I was not significantly altered throughout pregnancy, that of autophagosome-associated LC3-II increased significantly from day 15, showed a peak on day 21, and decreased on day 23 (day of normal parturition). LC3-II / I ratio had positive correlations with steroidogenic activity and cell size. Immunoreactive LC3 was found to be present in the cytosol of steroidogenic cells and showed marked aggregation in cells on day 21. In vivo treatment with Bafilomycin A1 resulted in unaltered delivery, but in significant reductions in steroidogenic cell size and neutrophil infiltration compared to vehicle-treated control groups. Discussion and Conclusion: The ratio of LC3-II / I in CL was markedly up-regulated in the late phase of pregnancy. Manifestation of this autophagy parameter was temporally matched with further structural and functional activation of CL. Autophagy may contribute to activation, but not regression, of rodent CL and thus their female reproduction.",

P-02.07.5-011 Changes in the specific extracellular matrix proteins and expression of ADAMTS proteinases and effects of hypoxia in the adriamycin-induced renal fibrosis model Renal fibrosis is a common cause of renal dysfunction with chronic kidney diseases. This process is characterized by excessive production of extracellular matrix (ECM) or inhibition of ECM degradation. ADAMTS proteinases, which are widely presented in mammals, have very critical roles in ECM remodeling. We aimed to study the role of ADAMTS proteinases in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis and the effets of hypoxia by studying ADAMTS expressions in rat kidney after adriamycin (ADR) administration. ADR was administered intravenously in consequtive two doses (2.5 and 4 mg/kg) to the rats. In addition to control and ADR groups, another rats were assigned into three groups as sham, 15 min and 45 min ischemia-reperfusion. After 2 months following the first dose, the expression of ADAMTSs were determined in the renal tissues using Western blot analysis. Additionally, renal nephropathy and fibrosis were assessed pathological and immuno-histochemical staining methods. In the ADR group rats developed renal dysfuntion and tissue damage in favor of renal fibrosis pathologically. It is observed that occurred remarkable changes in the expression of ADAMTSs. It is showed that hypoxia and hypoxia time enhanced tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the rat kidney tissues. Expression differences were absorved also in the hypoxia groups, and especially the expression of ADAMTS-1 and -15 genes were showed an increase in various rates. The restricted and different expression pattern of ADAMTS protein profiles in the ADR-induced renal fibrosis suggest that ADAMTS family members are related with development and progression of fibrosis. Moreover, our findings raise the possibility that the hypoxia promotes renal fibrogenesis. The monitoring of ADAMTS proteinases might contribute to the early diagnosis of renal fibrosis and chronic kidney disease. ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteas) are transmembrane proteins that contain a pro-domain, a metalloprotease, a disintegrin, a cysteine-rich, an epidermal-growth factor like and a transmembrane domain, as well as a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail.

AEBP1 is the short isoform that acts as a transcriptional repressor by targeting the AP2 promoter and ACLP, which is the long isoform that harbors a leader sequence that directs the peptide to the extracellular compartment. The latter is known to be associated with development of the connective tissue, injury repair and fibrosis in certain pathological conditions. AEBP1/ACLP displays a moderate expression in skeletal muscle where the role is not known. We have investigated the spatial and temporal expression of AEBP1/ACLP in defined models of skeletal muscle differentiation, injury repair and fibrosis. AEBP1/ACLP expression is present in steady state dividing myoblasts. This basal expression is upregulated 4 folds upon the induction of differentiation in C2C12 cells. Considering that differentiation and post-natal injury repair share several common aspects, we also investigated the expression of AEBP1/ACLP in acute injury-repair model. In the course of cardiotoxin induced injury, AEBP1/ACLP expression peaks up to 5 folds in the 6th day of regeneration. This time point concomitantly corresponds to tissue remodelling. Since AEBP1/ACLP is also known to be associated with fibrotic events in chronic pathological conditions, we also have investigated its expression in tenotomy induced skeletal muscle degeneration which mimics endomysial and perimysial fibrosis. AEBP1/ACLP expression is upregulated up to 10 folds in early time-point samples. These results depict a novel role for AEBP1/ACLP in extracellular remodeling of the skeletal muscle during injury repair as well as fibrotic degeneration. The source of this expression might come from fibroadipogenic precursers which reside in endomisial area of muscle. Our current efforts are focused on presenting of this endomysial expression. The mprBp gene from B. pumilus 3-19 encoding a novel secreted metalloproteinase was identified. Based on the primary structure the enzyme has been classified as metzincin metalloproteinase that combines the features of two families: astacin and adamalysin. Representatives of the adamalysin family previously have not been described for bacilli. The aim of the work was to elucidate the mechanisms of the gene expression regulation of a new Bacillus pumilus 3-19 extracellular metalloendopeptidase. Promoter region analysis revealed the presence of potential binding sites for transcription factors Spo0A (sporulation) and DegU (biodegradation). Study of mprBp expression in strain defective in regulatory proteins DegS and DegU shows that the productivity of metalloproteinase biosynthesis decline in average 60% compared with the strain with a complete DegS-DegU system. We also studied mprBp expression in strains with a mutation in the gene degU, leading to stabilization of Degu~P protein. It is known, that this mutation leads to a multiple increase in the gene expression level, positively regulated by DegS-DegU system. Our data shows a 10-fold increase in metalloproteinase productivity in the recombinant strain. Thus, Deg-system participates in control of the proteinase synthesis but not only in the regulation of mprBp gene expression. The mprBp expression in the strain deficient in regulatory protein Spo0A remained at the level with expression in the strain with the complete spo0A. A similar pattern we observed in the study of mprBp gene expression in strains defective in other spore-specific regulatory proteins (Spo0B, Spo0F, Spo0K, Spo0J, SigF, SigH, SigK). These data indicate that mprBp gene expression is free of Spo-regulatory proteins. On this basis, we concluded that the expression of metalloproteinase gene is not correlated with the sporulation. P-02.07.5-019 Paricalcitol attenuate activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinases in a rat model of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are endopeptidases involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix. They have been postulated to have a role in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). In the present study, we investigated the effect of paricalcitol, a synthetic vitamin D analog, on MMPs in renal IRI. 21 wistar albino rats were divided into three groups: sham operated, ischemia-reperfusion, and paricalcitol-pretreated. IRI model was induced by bilateral clamping of renal arteries for 45 min followed by 24 h of reperfusion. The analysis of serum creatinine levels and activities/expressions of MMP-2 and -9 were performed after 24 h of IRI. The effects of paricalcitol on activities and expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were investigated by gelatin zymography and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The pathological examinations were performed to score tubular damage by light microscopy. Creatinine levels increased significantly in the IRI group. Rats in the paricalcitolpretreated group showed significant decrease in expressions and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 during IRI. Moreover, pathological examinations displayed significantly lower score of tubular damage in paricalcitol-pretreated group. In conclusion, Paricalcitol attenuated IRI by downregulating the expressions and activities of MMP-2 and -9. P-02.07.5-020",

A disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase domain with thrompospondin-1 repeats (ADAMTS) are a large family of proteoglycanase that show proteolytic activity towards proteoglycans like aggrecan, brevican, neurocan, and versican. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an IL-1 cytokine family member that uniquely plays a role as a cytokine and nuclear factor. It is released by necrotic epithelial cells and activated innate immune cells as an alarming danger signal. ADAMTS and IL-33 implicated in brain cancer pathogenesis. We aimed to seek the amount of ADAMTS15 in U118 Proteolytic enzymes are able to speed up wound healing by removal of the necrotic tissues and fibrin. Several investigations have reported that proteases damage also the microbial biofilms formed by opportunistic bacteria including Staphylococci on surfaces of chronic and acute dermal wounds. Therefore, proteases are seemingly perspective enzymes for biofilm eradication by hydrolysis of both matrix proteins and adhesins, proteins providing cells attachment onto solid surface and other bacteria, as well as by the cleavage of signalling peptides of intercellular communication of gram-positive bacteria. Here we report that ficin, a plant protease, efficiently degrades the structural components of biofilm matrix formed by S. aureus and S. epidermidis at concentrations of 10 lg/ml while trypsin and chimotrypsin are used as 1-2 mg/ml solution. The spatial structure of the biofilm was analyzed by atomic force microscopy. After ficin treatment, the biofilm structure became porous, with reduced viscosity. The congo red staining of the treated biofilms confirmed the hydrolysis of the protein component of the matrix. Moreover, the biofilm treatment with ficin increased the antimicrobial efficiency of ciprofloxacin against biofilm-embedded cells of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. While 24 h antibiotic treatment did not lead to the increase of dead cells of neither S. aureus nor S. epidermidis embedded into the biofilm matrix, in the presence of ficin the fraction of viable cells decreased significantly. Accordingly, soluble ficin appears beneficial for outer wound treatment biofilm eradication and reduces the reinfection risk. The wound-healing activity of ficin requires further investigations. This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (project No 15-14-00046). Resveratrol (Resv) is an antioxidant that belongs to the group of plant compounds, called polyphenols. Resv is defined as an antimicrobial substance that is produced by several plants (red grape skin, peanuts and berries) to protect them from rough environments like excessive ultraviolet light, infections and climate changes. As an antioxidant, this polyphenol protects the body against cardio-vascular and cancer diseases. Besides, Resv has anti-inflammatory, neuro-protective, anti-diabetic and other pharmacological effects. Although the positive pleiotropic effects of this polyphenol are well documented, there is a huge need to understand its influence on the biophysical properties of lipid bilayer. In the present work, the interaction of Resv with membranes composed of palmitoyl-docosahexaenoyl phosphatidylcholine (PDPC) or palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol (Ch) was investigated by means of fluorescence spectroscopy. Generalized polarization of the fluorescent probe Laurdan (GP) as a function of temperature was used to probe the changes in the fluidity of lipid bilayer induced by different Resv concentration. The obtained results showed decreased lipid ordering from 50 to 100 lmol Resv and opposite effect from 200 to 500 lmol in PDPC/SM/Ch mixtures as compared to the control without Resv. The interaction of Resv with POPC/SM/Ch mixtures caused only an increase in the lipid ordering as a function of Resv amount. POPC and PDPC have the same head group but different fatty acid chains at sn-2. Since Resv changes the physicochemical properties of lipid bilayer by different ways one might suggest that the interaction of polyphenol with the membrane depends on the level of fatty acid unsaturation. This specific effect of Resv on lipid organization could be related to its unique properties to prevent the cell from oxidative stress.",

The human endothelin system, which includes endothelin receptors types A and B (ETB and ETA), plays a highly important role in the blood pressure regulation. Endothelium cells produce peptides, known as endothelins 1-4, which activate endothelin receptors and launch cascades of reactions that lead to vasoconstriction or vasodilatation depending on the receptor subtype and the tissue. Additionally, endothelin receptors take part in such processes as transmission of nerve impulses, development of neural crest, and regulation of acid-base-salt balance in kidneys.",

Intake of foods that contain fructose, glucose and starch-based sugar is a potential risk for metabolic syndrome. Obesity and diabetes are important effects of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). We aimed to research, activity of Na + /K + -ATPase in addition to glucose transporter (GLUT) 2, resistin, adiponectin and other biochemical markers in rats fed glucose, fructose and starch-based sugars. Materials and Methods: Study was performed on rats and 3 groups were included in the study. Rats were fed with chows that were given either normal diet for control group (70% carbohydrate, 20% protein and 10% fat), high fructose (70% carbohydrate (87% fructose and 13% starch), 20% protein and 10% fat), or high sucrose (70% carbohydrate (87% sucrose and 13% starch), 20% protein and 10% fat). Rats were fed with chows for 8 weeks. In this process, the weight of the rats were followed. At the end of the experiment, blood is taken in all groups. Level of HbA1c, glucose, resistin and adiponectin were studied. GLUT2 and Na + /K + -ATPase activity were studied in the liver tissue. Results: A significant increase in adiponectin levels were determined in rats fed both HFCS and sucrose (P < 0.001). A significant decrease in level of Na + /K + -ATPase activity were determined in rats fed both HFCS and sucrose (P < 0.001). There was no significant differance level of HbA1c, glucose, resistin and GLUT2 in rats fed sucrose or HFCS (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Fructose-rich diet has an effect on changes in the ATPase activity and is a major risk factor for obesity.

While alcohol and smoking play an important role at pathogenesis of disease, deregulation of some signaling pathways, genes and protein levels related to these pathways are considered as important at contribution of development of HNSCC. Materials and Methods: In this study, protein and phosphoprotein expression levels of the frequently phosphorylated sites (EGFR, pEGFR, IGF-IR, pIGF-IR, PDGFRB, pPGDFRB, PTEN, pPTEN, AKT and pAKT) were investigated by using a western blot to confirm the expression of mRNA in the context of protein levels at normal-tumor tissues of HNSCC and SCCL-MT1 that is a HNSCC tumor cell line and HEK-293 that is a normal cell line. Results: As a result of western blot analysis EGFR, PDGFRB and IGF-1R were detected as highly overexpressed cell surface receptors in tumor tissues of HNSCC. Discussion and Conclusion: The findings of this study revealed the overexpression of other cell surface receptors as well as EGFR in HNSCC. In conclution, potential pathways were identified by determining the cell surface receptors overexpressed in HNSCC, these data support each other and may be important in pathogenesis of HNSCC. Introduction: The investigation of final products of lipid peroxidation is considered as the main mechanism involved in development of pathogenesis, diagnostics and prognosis of various parasitic illnesses. Materials and Methods: The concentration of LP-AP in the blood was determined in the study group considered of 129 women (65%), and 69 men (35%).",

Aim: Behc \u00dfet's disease (BD) is a systemic autoimmune disease. Recurrent oral and genital mucosal ulcers, uveitis, and skin lesions are characteristic findings for BD. Platelet-lymphocyte ratio reflects a novel marker for romatological diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the platelet/lymphocyte ratio in Behc \u00dfet's Disease. Methods: Whole blood samples were collected from 50 healthy control and 21 patients with Behc \u00dfet's disease. The mean age for controls and patients were 40 AE 1.0 and 37 AE 13, respectively (P = 0.639). Patients with chronic disease and inflammatory disorders were excluded. Thrombocyte and lymphocyte counts were analyzed with Abbott Cell Dyne heamotolgy analyzer. Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS v20. Results: Platelet counts were higher but not statistically significant in patients with Behc \u00dfet's disease compared to control group (289 AE 100 vs. 257 AE 57) (P = 0.088). Lymphocyte counts were lower in patients with Behc \u00dfet's disease compared to control group (2.56 AE 0.58 vs. 2.69 AE 0.85) (P = 0.513). Platelet/Lymphocyte ratio was higher but not statistically elevated in patients with Behc \u00dfet's disease compared to control group (118 AE 41 vs. 106 AE 49) (P = 0.344) Conclusions: Platelet/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and mean platelet volume (MPV) as inflammatory markers recently became popular because of their simplicity, cost effectivity and their advantages to predict clinical prognosis of specific diseases. According to this study's results, platelet/lymphocyte ratio must be analyzed in vast scale patient populations to identify the disease. Objectives: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic relapsing autoimmune disease characterized by production of autoantibodies against a series of nuclear antigens and by chronic inflammation. In recent years, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was determined to be a good indicator of inflammatory status. NLR can be easily calculated from a whole blood count. Introduction: Neuroblastoma, an embryonal malignancy, is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. Untreated neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines are reported to have reduced HLA class I expression, rendering them potentially susceptible to natural killer cell killing due to lack of engagement of HLA class I-specific inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). The aim of this study was to investigate whether KIR genes could influence the risk of neuroblastoma and prognosis of the patients. Materials and Methods: Study group consisted of 50 neuroblastoma patients (15 male, 21 female, median age: 36 months) followed at the Pediatric Oncology Clinic of C \u00df ukurova University Medical Faculty. Control group consisted of 100 healthy children. 14 patients had stage 1, 2, 3 or 4S disease, 36 patients had stage 4 disease. 16 different KIR genes were analysed by sequence specific oligonucleotide probe (SSOP) analyses. Statistical analysis were done using Fisher's Exact test. Results: Compared to the control group, neuroblastoma patients had lower expression of activating KIR gene, KIR2DS3 (P = 0.005), and higher expression of inhibitory KIR gene 2DL3 (P = 0.038). Additionally KIR2DS3 genes were more common in patients with early stages (stage 1, 2, 3 or 4S) (P = 0.023) and KIR2DL3 genes were more common in patients with stage 4 (P = 0.044). Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences between the rate of AA and Bx genotypes and their centromeric/ telomeric regions of patients and controls. Discussion: KIR2DL3 gene can have a triggering effect in neuroblastoma pathogenesis; whereas KIR2DS3 can have a protective role. Investigating NK cell infiltration and KIR receptors in neuroblastoma tissue samples will give more insight to the pathogenesis P-04.03.3-008 Neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects of Urtica urens S.

Demirtas 2 1 Department of Biology, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Pamukkale University, Denizli, Turkey, 2 Deparment of Chemistry, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, C \u00df ankiri Karatekin University, C \u00df ankiri, Turkey Urtica urens (Small Stinging Nettle) has been used for medical purposes in Turkey as an alternative therapy. It has been used in the treatment of inflammation that is early, non-specific immune reaction to tissue damage or pathogen invasion, plays an important role in the initiation of neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple sclerosis. However, there are limited studies that investigate anti-inflammatory activity of urtica. Therefore, aim of this study is to find out theanti-inflammatory effect of chloroform extract in Caco-2 cell line. For this purpose, firstly, chloroform extract of urtica leaves was prepared. Chemical composition of extract was determined by LC-MS. The effect of chloroform extract on selected pro-inflammatory and inflammatory proteins such as Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB), C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), and 11 (CXCL11) were determined. Whole genome transcriptome analysis was performed by using Human HT-12 V4 BeadChip. Extract treatment caused 35% and 40% increases in protein and mRNA levels of NF-jB, respectively. On the other hand, TNF-a protein and mRNA levels decreased significantly (24% and 12%, respectively). Similarly, CXCL10 and CXCL11 mRNA levels decreased 45% and 38%. Transcriptome analysis showed that 233 probes were significantly changed (P < 0.05). Pathway analysis revealed that the extract altered a group of genes involved in immune response, calcium ion homeostasis and transport, potassium channel complex, G-protein coupled receptor protein signalling pathway, etc. It is well established that calcium is very critical for brain cell death and formation of many brain disease including multiple sclerosis. These observations suggests that urtica maybe used in neurodegenerative diseases. In order to further test this hypothesis experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis experimentsand activity guided fractionations have been still continuing. This work is supported by TUBITAK 111T515.

During abscission of the ICB, the ingression of the cleavage furrow is formed, and the central spindle microtubules are compacted into the structure known as midbody (MB). The MB is situated within the ICB, with the abscission usually occurring at one side of the MB. As a result, only one daughter cell inherits the post-mitotic MB.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib is the first-line treatment for patients with CML. Unfortunately drug resistance is one of the main problems observed. While secondary resistance is associated with Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations, oncogene amplification and mechanisms interfering with intra-cellular drug concentrations; primary resistance mechanisms haven't been elucidated. We generated high dose imatinib-resistant K562 subclones (K562-Ir) by clonal selection to study primary resistance mechanisms in vitro. Drug resistance was shown by caspase 3 and annexin V/PI assays. We also showed cellular uptake and function of imatinib with Western blot technics. K562-Ir cells are not only resistant to imatinib but also to 2nd, 3rd generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We demonstrated that K562-Ir cells have a highly adherent character, proliferate slowly and are resistant to drug-induced senescence. Microarray analysis revealed that K562-Ir cells differentially express tissue/organ developement and differentiation genes at high levels. We showed that K562-Ir cells forms intact tumor spheroids in 3D cell culture conditions which is a marker of tumor initiating potential. Cell surface maker analyses and protein analyses of K562-Ir cell population, points towards an epithelial-mesenchymal plastic cell capable of adopting different morphologies. We hypotizied that imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors may cause the gain of phenotypic plasticity potential in leukemic cells, by interfering with signalling pathways; which in itself may lead to therapy resistance.",

Apigenin dose dependently inhibited CSCs and PC3 cell viability, and this was accompanied with a significant increase of the cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27 (KIP1). The flavonoid significantly induced apoptosis via an extrinsic caspase-dependent pathway by upregulating the mRNA expressions of caspases-8, -3 and TNFa, but failed to regulate the intrinsic pathway as determined by the Bax, cytochrome c and APAF-1 in CSCs. In contrast to CSCs, apigenin induced intrinsic apoptosis pathway as evidenced by the induction of Bax, cytochrome c and caspase-3 while caspase-8, TNF-a and Bcl-2 levels remained unchanged in PC3 cells. The ability of apigenin to inhibit the proliferation of CSCs through apoptosis was confirmed by Tali image-based cytometer. The flavanone strongly suppressed the migration rate of CSCs compared to untreated cells. Significant downregulation of MMP-2 and -9 exhibits the ability of apigenin treatment to suppress invasion. The expressions of PI3K/Akt and NF-KB p105/ p50 were significantly decreased after 48 h apigenin treatment. Taken together, these data demonstrated that flavonoid apigenin is an invaluable chemopreventive compound that inhibits proliferation, invasion and the stemness properties of CSCs.",

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Metastasis is associated with the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood of cancer patients. CTC cut-off values have been shown to predict for poorer overall survival in metastatic breast (\u22655), prostate (\u22655), and colorectal (\u22653) cancer based on assessment of 7.5 ml of blood. In our study, CTCs were detected in blood samples of colorectal cancer patients, using with our modified convenient method for the strategies of CTC enrichment and detection. 7.5 mL peripheral blood samples were firstly collected and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the fresh blood samples by ficoll gradient separation. Next, the leukocytes in PBMCs were removed by magnetic microbeads conjugated with CD45 for a negative selection. Finally, the retained cells were labeled with anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule (anti-EpCAM), cytokeratins (CK8, CK19) and the leukocyte-specific marker as anti-CD45. All samples were analyzed by BD FACS Aria III flow cytometry. In total, 10 patients and 7 healthy people were included in this study. The results showed that CTCs were not detected in the blood samples of healhty volunteers, but 3-13 CTCs were detected with CK14, 15, 16, 19-based gating strategy in the blood samples of colorectal cancer patients. It is accepted that the cut off value is 3 CTCs for colorectal cancer and CTC is negative if it is below this value or CTC is considered as a positive, if it is equal to or above this value, which might be an indication for poor prognosis. Thus CTC's detection may serve a representative surrogate tumor biomarker for real-time monitoring of disease status and tailoring personalized therapy. Cells were grown in culture flasks in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 and were used at the proliferation and confluent stages. Cultured cells were exposed to the PEMF and PRFE. The proliferations of the cells are measured by MTT assay for the effect of EMF on the cancer cells. On the other hand the wound healing was investigated by closure of the wound by the cell proliferation with cell morphology using inverted microscope images.",

In our cell culture study, the appropriate EMF applications were found to be effective though the inhibition of proliferation of cancer cells even in invasive cancer but with lower effect. This means that EMF applications may support the existing treatment methods of cancer patients and even people who suffer from invasive cancer. Metastasis is the one of the most known causes of death in patients diagnosed with cancer. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are shed from primary tumors and circulating in the bloodstream, and thought to play a key role in metastasis. A hypothesis that CTCs may contribute to metastasis was first introduced in the mid 19th century by Thomas Ashworth, an Austrilian pathologist. In today's research, identification and molecular characterization of CTCs are thought to be a novel target for treatment of cancer and a key factor to understand the metastatic process. Existing methods of CTC capture based on the Cell Search system, flow cytometers, laser scanning cytometers instruments, fiber-optic array scanning technology (FAST), isolation by size of epithelial tumor cells (ISET), and definition fluorescence scanning microscopy. CTCs are increasingly considered as a 'liquid biopsy' and when liquid biopsy is compared to tumor tissue biopsy, liquid biopsy for CTCs detection can be carried out routinely in patients due to accessibility and ease of blood collection. Also, primary tumor sampling may not reflect the actual metastatic conditions, CTCs are thought to be a novel tumor biomarker for real-time monitoring of disease status and tailoring personalized therapy. With futher works, CTCs may be used as liquid biopsies and it might provide better understanding metastatic process, new approaches in cancer diagnostics and treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are distributed all over the organism as a source of tissue formation and regeneration. Glucose is vital for the proliferation and differentiation of MSCs. Glucose uptake is mediated by specific glucose transporters of two families, the Na-coupled glucose transporters (SGLT) and glucose transporter facilitators (GLUT). The presence and function of GLUT proteins in human placental amnion derived MSCs (hAMSCs) is unknown. We aimed to investigate the presence of GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT4 proteins and genes in hAMSCs isolated from term placentas.",

Further studies are required to clarify the complex mechanisms regulating the relationship between glucose and mesenchymal stem cells. Disclosure of this relationship may provide a better understanding of glucose-related pathologies such as diabetes. Tumors have hierarchically organized heterogeneous cell populations and a small subpopulation of cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), is responsible for tumor initiation, maintenance as well as drug resistance. Therefore, killing the CSCs along with the other cancer cells is gaining an importance. In the present study, it was aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic and apoptotic activity of a novel Platin (Pt) (II) complex [Pt(Hepy) 2 Cl 2 ] on mammospheres obtained from MCF-7 human breast cancer line.

Cancer is a disease which arises from destruction of growth and proliferation mechanisms in cells and is the second leading cause of death worldwide [1] . In the development of primary cancers, the head and neck cancer is accounting for approximately 550.000 new cases annually around the world [2] . Laryngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer in which malignant cells arise from the mucosal tissues of the larynx [3] . Cancer might spread from primary tumor by getting into the lymph and blood vessel system and forms secondary tumor. Greater than 90% of deaths in cancer patients are attributed to metastasis [4] . Circulating tumor cells (CTC's) provide an opportunity to understand the metastatic process of cancer patients. Identification and molecular characterization of CTC's in the peripheral blood of cancer patients is a promising research area in the field of biomarker development and novel treatment targeting in today's cancer research [5] . The detection of CTC methods include Cell Search system, flow cytometry, high-definition fluorescence scanning microscopy, fiber-optic array scanning technology, isolation by size of epithelial tumor cells, and laser scanning cytometers [6] . In our study, 7.5 ml of peripheral blood samples were collected from larynx cancer patients and healthy volunteers and the samples were analyzed by BD FACS Aria III flow cytometry via biomarkers EpCAM, CK19, CK8 for positive selection and CD45 for negative selection [7] . According to the results of our study; CTCs were detected in larynx cancer patients by our newly modified method whereas there was no CTC's detection in the samples of controls. Thus, this study may provide us monitoring of the treatment process of larynx cancer and this method might be used as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers in cancer therapy as a liquid biopsy. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of death from cancer in men 1 . Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) present in the peripheral circulation of cancer patients with different solid malignancies including prostate cancer and have a potential as a liquid biopsy to monitor disease progression and response to therapies at cell and molecular level 2 . One of the general methods in CTC detection is flow cytometry 3 . Radical prostatectomy is the most frequently applied procedure in the surgical management of localized prostate cancer. In this surgical operation, the surgeon removes the entire prostate gland with the seminal vesicles. A radical prostatectomy procedure can be done using the da Vinci robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) 4 . Robotic surgery has been suggested to have fewer complications, lower risk of infections and shorter recovery period following robotic radical prostatectomy 5,6 . In this study, our aim was to detect CTCs before and after robotic radical prostatectomy in clinical localized prostate cancer patients. The CTC detection study was performed with our modified method in which 7.5 ml of peripheral blood samples were collected from each prostate cancer patient and healthy individual; the samples, using with biomarkers EpCAM, CK19, CK8 for positive selection and CD45 for negative selection, were analyzed by BD FACS Aria III flow cytometry 7 . According to our results, we detected CTCs in the peripheral blood samples of prostate cancer patients before robotic radical prostatectomy. However, following this surgical procedure no CTC or decreased number of CTSs was detected. Our study might contribute to understand disease progression after robotic radical prostatectomy in clinically localized prostate cancer patients that warrants further research.

Furthermore, we found that modulation of paucimannose function by application of a specific antibody regulated cell proliferation and the capability of cells to form colonies in soft agar. These data support a functional role of paucimannosidic epitopes in tumorigenic processes. Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal type of malignant brain tumors. Recently, GBM stem cells (GSCs) have been studied in great deal and accepted that they have a legitimate role in tumor formation, development, chemo-resistance and recurrence. In this study, it is aimed to investigate new therapeutic targets within apoptosis related molecules to select and eliminate CD133+ GSCs effectively.",

It stabilizes microtubules and causes catastrophic cell cycle arrest in G2/M. It also initiate signaling through cell death pathways that result in programmed cell death. In this study, it was aimed to investigate apoptotic and cytotoxic effects of docetaxel has on the MCF-7 breast cancer cells line. In this study, MCF-7 breast cell line was applied different doses docetaxel (10 nM, 100 nM, 1 lM, 10 lM, 100 lM) as 24 h and 48 h. MTT analysis was performed to the MCF-7 breast cancer line in control group and groups of docetaxel. Afterwards, evaluation of apoptosis by TUNEL and levels of P53, sin3A and MDM2 gene expression by Real-Time PCR were determined in an order. It was observed cell variable was significant lower in docetaxel groups compared to control group (P < 0.05) in 24 h as MTT analysis. The lowest cell viabilty was determinated in group applied 100 lM docetaxel. While the lowest positive cell density was determinated in control group, it was observed apoptotic cell density gradually increased with increasing docetaxel concentration in groups treated docetaxel (P < 0.05). The highest P53, Si3A and MDM2 expressions were apperared in 100 nM docetaxel group compared to control group. Human alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and AFP receptor binding domain (AFPRbd) are able to bind and internalize effectively by wide range of human tumor cells and tissues. As other vector molecules AFPRbd has insufficient quantity of chemical groups which can be conjugated with drugs or diagnostic agents. Conjugation of vector molecules with macromolecular polymer carriers like dendrimers aims to solve this problem. Our study describes influence of AFPRbd-dendrimer-doxorubicin conjugate surface charge on intracellular trafficking routes and toxicity. The amineterminated (G2) and acetyl-terminated (G2 12 ) 2nd generation PAMAM dendrimers carrying doxorubicin (Dox) were used to synthesize conjugates with AFPRbd. Unmodified by AFPRbd G2 and G2 12 dendrimer derivates labeled with Dox were absorbed by the cells at 37\u00b0C with different efficiency. G2 12 -Dox derivate characterized much slower internalization rate than nonacetylated G2-Dox. Only G2 12 -Dox shown partial colocalization with lysosomal marker LAMP2 after 4 h of incubation. Internalization of AFPRbd-G2-Dox and AFPRbd-G2 12 -Dox did not show significant difference. At the same time, both conjugates contained AFPRbd wy\u043ay almost fully associated with LAMP2 already after 30 min of incubation. Cytotoxicity results revealed that IC50 levels of G2 12 -Dox and AFPRbd-G2 12 -Dox coincided and demonstrated a bit higher activity against sensitive to Dox SKOV3 and resistant SKVLB cells than AFPRbd-G2-Dox conjugate after 72 h of incubation. At the same time, after 1 h of incubation AFPRbd-G2-Dox and AFPRbd-G2 12 -Dox were much more than G2 12 -Dox and G2-Dox. We may conclude that there is significant difference in ways of dendrimers internalization by tumor cells depending on nature of surface chemical groups. On the other hand, chemical modification of dendrimer conjugated with does not AFPRbd influence dramatically on the protein trafficking and resulting cytotoxic effect.

Introduction: Leukemias are neoplasms that arise from hematopoietic cells initially proliferate in the bone marrow, and then disseminated in the peripheral blood, spleen, lymph nodes and eventually to other tissues. Lymphomas occur primarily in the lymph nodes, but can be extended in peripheral blood and bone marrow infiltrate. Aim: To determine the values of haematological parameters the control and test groups. To determine the prevalence of types of chronic leukemia in relation to the experimental group. Compare haematological parameters in relation to the type of chronic leukemia. Materials and Methods: A prospective-retrospective study included subjects who were made laboratory hematology in OJ Clinical chemistry and biochemistry UKCS. Blood tests conducted on the hematology analyzer Siemens ADVIA 2120 Hematology System and Abbott Cell Dyn 3700 and microscopic analysis of the peripheral blood smear. Results and Discussion: According to the age of respondents test group was established mild form of anemia, a red blood cell count is totaled 3.69 AE 1.13x10 12 , which is signifycantly lower compared to the control group.

The late passage of hESCs isolated with non-enzymatic and trypsin methods showed the highest proliferation rate in comparison to the hESCs obtained via collagenase type 1 isolation method at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. The three isolation methods for the early passages of hESCs had a resemblance in their MSC profile with no significant difference. On the other hand, late passage hESCs isolated using trypsin non-enzymatic method showed a higher CD31and lower CD44 profile. Moreover, late passage of hESCs isolated with non-enzymatic method displayed a significant reduction in their cell surface CD90, CD73, and CD105 surface expression levels. Only hESCs isolated with collagenase type 1 did not present a significant shift in their mesenchymal CD marker profile from early to late passages, Taken together results from this study suggest that the longterm maintenance of mesenchymal markers can only be achieved in cell isolation with collagenase type 1, while non-enzymatic method is more suitable to obtain higher MSC cell yield for immediate use. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) abundantly arises on the viral and/or chemical-induced cirrhosis in liver. Cirrhosis is defined as one of the premalignant stage HCC in which microenvironmental changes occurred such as uncontrolled production of collagen type I and activation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-met signaling. It has been shown that EpCAM+/CD133+ subpopulation of cells isolated from HCC tissue can initiate tumor at very low concentration in xenograft model and behaves as hepatic cancer stem cells. However, the molecular mechanisms supporting hepatic stem cell activation are not well understood and knowledge about the role of HGF/c-Met pathway in this process is not clear. In this study, we aimed to define effect of collagen type I and HGF induction on the cell behaviours of EpCAM+/ CD133. EpCAM+/CD133+ cells were sorted by magnetic separation from HuH-7 cells. Then proliferation and invasion of cells were analyzed under the HGF induction as well as branching morphogenesis in vitro. After HGF stimulation, phosphorylation level of c-Met increased in EpCAM+/CD133+ subpopulation. Moreover, presence of collagen type I enhanced significantly effect of HGF stimulation in the invasion of EpCAM+/CD133+ cells.

Endometriosis is defined by the migration of endometrial mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs) into the peritoneal cavity or other site of body rather than uterus in a retrograde fashion. Its previously known intracellular crosslinking enzyme called tissue transglutaminase (TG2) was shown to play important roles in the extracellular matrix (ECM) modelling, fibrosis, cell adhesion and migration. We have hypothesized that TG2 might be expressed in eMSCs and take part in the formation of endometriosis.",

Metabolic reprogramming and glucose uptake of cells may be an early indicator of the differentiation process in WJ-MSSCs, supporting the view on their metabolic plasticity. Store-operated Ca 2+ entry (SOCE) activated by depletion of intracellular Ca +2 stores has been shown to control intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis in many physiological and pathological events. Stromal interactive protein, STIM1, as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca +2 sensor and Orai protein as pore-forming subunit of SOC channels play crucial roles in the activation of SOCE channels. STIM1 and Orai were reported to have pathophysiological roles especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Anticancer chemotherapy frequently falls back because of these tumor-initiating subpopulations, tentatively called 'cancer stem cells'. The purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of STIM1 and Orai on SOCE in differentiation of Huh-7 HCCs expressing EpCAM and CD133 surface adhesion molecules (EpCAM + CD133 + ). EpCAM + CD133 + subpopulations in Huh-7 cells were separated via flow cytometry and transfected with STIM1 and Orai-1 over-expressing (OE) plasmids. Expression levels were confirmed by RT-PCR. Changes in intracellular Ca 2+ concentration were monitored via dual wavelength spectrofluorimeter in fura 2-loaded cells. In EpCAM + CD133 + cells, ER Ca 2+ release increased without any change in SOCE compared to that of EpCAM \u00c0 CD133 \u00c0 cells. Similar results were observed in STIM1-OE EpCAM + CD133 + cells. On the other hand, increase in Orai1 has no effect on either parameter. Cancer is globally one of the most death causes. Recently, huge improvements occurred in the cancer diagnosis and treatment due to advanced technology, however recurrence occurs almost 30-40% of patients and their survival times decreases. In this study, we aimed to investigate of relationship between the cancer stem cells which are strongly associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance and recurrence with the non-classical MHC I antigens which have immunosuppressive properties. For this purpose, we immunohistochemically evaluated the expression patterns of CD133, CD44, Nanog, Oct3/4, HLA-G and HLA-E in the advanced stage colorectal, gastric and breast cancer and also non malign biopsy samples. We detected that the cancer stem cell markers CD133, CD44, Nanog and Oct3/4 significantly increased in the advanced stage cancer tissues. However, the immunosuppressive HLA-G and HLA-E expressions increased only in the colorectal and gastric tumor tissue. In addition to the presence of cancer stem cell like cells in the tumor tissues, increased expressions of HLA-G and HLA-E may indicate an immune evasive adaptation of tumor cells. According to our findings, the HLA-G and HLA-E may be potential therapy targets to elimination of cancer stem cells of colorectal and gastric cancers. However, more detailed studies are needed to support our findings and also to determinate of clinical values of these markers.",

            "text": "Lipid-structured endocannabinoids are endogenous morphine ligands and present widespread receptor-mediated effects at physiological and pathological levels on the nervous system as well as many other systems. These effects are partially realized through mechanisms affecting cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and migration at the molecular level. The hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) form a distinct niche in bone marrow where they interact with each other in harmony. The stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) is a chemotactic factor in bone marrow and is released from MSCs and their receptor CXCR4 is found in HPCs. With these rationale in mind, we asked if HPCs and MSC interaction mediates SDF-1 release via endocannabinoidal system. Bone marrow MSCs obtained from healthy donors and passage 3 MSCs were induced with 200 ng/ml lipopolysaccaride (LPS) for 4 h. Antagonists for CB1 (AM281) and CB2 (AM630) receptors were added to cultures for 4 days. After incubation with antagonists MSC culture supernatants collected and processed with human SDF-1 beta in ELISA medium. Analyses demonstrated direct decreasing effect of endocannabinoid receptor antagonists on SDF-1 beta release from bone marrow MSCs. In conclusion, endocannabinoidal system regulates SDF-1 release on MSCs and directly act on HPCs mobilization in bone marrow microenvironment (niche). This may have a clinical implication on therapeutic mobilization strategies for HSCs in hematology clinical applications. Implantation is invasion of the embryo into the endometrium and occurs in three stages apposition, adhesion and invasion, via the complex cellular and molecular mechanisms. During these stages, both of maternal endometrium and embryo should be appropriate for the implantation which is the beginning of pregnancy. Receptivity of uterine consists in the existence of growth factors such as TGFbeta-1, IGFR1, VEGF. It is indicated that damages of factors relesead from endometrium and blastocyst prevent implantation. Recently, stem cells can be obtained from many sources to use for therapeutic purposes and mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow are the most studied. In our study, it was aimed to investigate molecules play a role in blastocyst implantation after bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell application into the rat endometriyum. Female rats were divided into three groups which were saline (SF, n:7), media (M, n:7), stem cell in media (M+BMSC, n:7). After vaginal smear technique, female rats in estrous cylcle were injected into the uterine and periton 200 lL saline, 200 lL culture media and 1 9 10 6 cell/200 lL culture media. The pregnant female rats on the 7 day were sacrified and uterine samples removed and were stained with heamatoxylin-eosin histochemically and anti-TGFbeta-1, anti-IGFR1, anti-VEGF and anti-PCNA immunohistochemically and obseved under light microscope. H-score results were determined using One-Way ANOVA test statistically. It was found that intraperitoneal administration of stem cells with media, was increased TGFbeta-1, IGFR1, VEGF and PCNA parameters when compared with the intrauterine administration of stem cells. In this study, it was revealed that distribution of molecules play role in implantation were changed due to stem cell application. It is supposed that stem cell treatments can be cured the molecules caused infertility. Many unconventional biochemical factors remain to be investigated for their potential effects on stem cells. Among others, endogenous gasotransmitter H 2 S, generated from L-cysteine and organosulfur-compounds (OSCs) metabolisms, plays very important roles in the central nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular system. Slow-releasing H 2 S donors are viewed as powerful tools for basic studies and innovative pharmaco-therapeutic agents for cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Exogenous H 2 S administration is able to promptly scavenge ROS, activate myocardial K ATP channels and increase pro-cell survival signaling, very likely activating ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. The effects of H 2 S-releasing agents on the growth of stem cells are not yet widely investigated. Therefore, stem cell therapy combined with H 2 S may have great clinical relevance in cell-based therapy for regenerative medicine.",

            "text": "The different spatial arrangement (isomery) of carboxyphenylsulfid substituents in clathrochelates causes the distinctions in both their CD-signal induced by interaction with proteins and their effect on the protein fluorescence. The geometry of ribbed substituents is important for their binding to biomolecules (particularly proteins) and is suggested to determine the structure of the formed guest-host complex. 3D Bioprinting is a new technology that revolutionized the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, allowing reconstruction of living tissue and organs preferably using the patient's own cells. Using a 3D printer we can design biological structures by controlling exact deposition of cells, growth factors and extracellular molecules in a spatially-controlled manner. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differentiation of human amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSC) into endothelial progenitor cells using a BioInk\u00d2 hydrogel photopolymerized in a 3D network resembling vascular tissue. Characterization of AFSC was performed by flow cytometry, followed by sorting of the CD177 + stem cell subpopulation. CD117 + stem cells were stained with cell tracker Red CMTPX and then mixed with BioInk\u00d2 hydrogel. Printing was done using a 150 lm diameter needle, under 1 bar pressure, and 150 mm/min speed. The network models with define distance apart were printed and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. MTT test was used to evaluate the viability of the CD117 + stem cells. Our results showed that AFSC remained viable as shown by MTT assay. The fluorescent microscopy images confirm the viability biochemical test showing that the CD117 + cells viability is maintained after 7 days of cultured in BioInk\u00d2 hydrogel. Furthermore, histological section of hydrogel showed that cells have a relatively uniform distribution forming network interactions between cells. Flow cytometry assay showed that CD117+ cells expressed endothelial markers such as CD31, CD105, CD133, CD144 and VEGFR2. In conclusion 3D printers are useful tools for creating three-dimensional scaffolds that mimics the cell microenvironment where different types of cells could proliferate, differentiate and crosslink with each other forming tissue-like structures. This study aims to reveal the biocompatibility, biodistribution and immunomodulatory impact on the production of inflammatory citokines of magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles functionalized with natural compounds with proved antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects. Co-precipitation synthesized Fe3O4 were functionalized with plant-derived compounds: eucalyptol, carvone, limonene and b-pinene. Characterization was done by IR, SEM and HR TEM, while in vitro biocompatibility was tested using endothelial human cells (fluorescence microscopy and proliferation assay). In vivo biodistribution was tested in a balbC mouse model at 2 and 7 days post-intraperitoneal injection, followed by experimental organ removal. Tissue sections obtained from vital organs were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Production of inflammatory cytokines was assessed by ELISA. Results demonstrated that, at concentrations of 500 lg/mL, all prepared nanosystems have a good biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo, allowing the development of cultured cells and also not affecting any visible behavior and organ morphology of the mice. Microscopy evaluation of the organs sections revealed that nanoparticles are not present in vital organs such as brain, heart, kidney and liver, but aggregates were visible in the lungs and spleen. At 7 days post-injection no visible aggregated were found in the lungs, few dark-brown nanoparticles clusters being visible in the red pulp of spleen. ELISA results revealed that Fe3O4 functionalized with carvone and limonene significantly stimulated the production of IL-2, IL-10 and IL-6, while reducing the production of TNFa. Other nanosystems din not impact significantly on the cytokine production. Functional Fe3O4 nanoparticles are efficient drug delivery shuttles, able to stabilize pharmacological compounds, such as plant-derived bioactives, and their biocompatibility, specific biodistribution and limited immunomodulatory effects recommend their use in pharmacological formulations. P-07.01.3-004 New approach for cell imaging with fluorescent carbon nanoparticles M. Dekaliuk, K. Pyrshev, O. Demchenko Palladin Institute of Biochemistry, Kiev, Ukraine In the nanotechnology field, much interest was focused on the new carbon nanomaterials for cell imaging. Recently discovered inorganic carbon nanoparticles ('C-dots') due to their excellent fluorescence characteristics and biocompatibility have ample opportunities for their use in imaging and functional transformations in living cells. Their distinctive features, such as high brightness, small sizes, high biocompatibility, small negative charge on the surface and very easy methods of their preparation present a good alternative to other nanoscale materials. The focus of our research was to determine the possibility of using C-dots as the easily available probes for apoptotic cells detection.",

The application of such cheap and easily accessible nanoparticles provides more opportunities to simplify the popular methods of cell labeling and detection. Previously, our studies showed the possibility of using these nanoscale fluorophores for super resolution method SOFI. A new electrochemical microbial biosensor for the fast detecting of dopamine and epinephrine based on Candida tropicalis immobilized in a carbon paste electrode (CPE) modified with single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) was described in this paper. The immobilized cells were used as a source of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) to develop voltammetric epinephrine and dopamine biosensor. Voltammetric determination of phenolic compounds like epinephrine and dopamine is a simple technique available. Direct oxidation of phenols can be used, but the oxidation potentials of this compounds are similar and they can not be detected distinctively. Another possibility is the use of biosensors based on the polyphenol oxidase (tyrosinase) enzyme that oxidises the phenolic compounds into their corresponding quinones. By this way phenolic compounds that epinephrine and dopamine that used in this study were detected at the different potential. The effect of varying the amounts of SWCNT and microorganism on the response to epinephrine was investigated to find the optimum composition of the sensor. The effects of pH and temperature were also examined. Increases in biosensor responses were linearly related to dopamine concentrations between 0.1 and 1.0 mM and epinephrine concentrations between 0.01 and 1.0 mM. Limits of detection of the biosensor for dopamine and epinephrine were calculated to be 0.021 and 0.0029 mM, respectively. Finally, proposed systems were applied to epinephrine and dopamine analysis in pharmaceutical drugs. Objective: It has started a long time ago to search for a material that can replace blood. This material does not require special storage conditions, independently of the recipient's blood group and can be applied to all individual.

Conclusion: The nanoparticles were obtained in accordance with the intended desired method. It is determined that the hemoglobin molecules give the same potential with natural blood even after 3 weeks of immobilization and carrying oxygen as natural blood. There are statistical differences between results of MTT tests due to used concentration. But, It is considered that decantation advantage of the artificial blood minimized cytotoxic effects. Proteoglycans are among the most abundant molecules of the inter-cellular structure and they are present in extracellular matrices of connective tissues. These glycosylated proteins contain one or more (GAG) chains that are covalently attached to the core protein and their hydrodynamic function is mainly due to the physicochemical characteristics of this GAG component which provides hydration and swelling pressure to the tissue. GAG levels excreted via urine are used as a marker to monitor different diseases (chronic renal disease, renal fibrosis, glomerular filtration abnormalities, bladder stones, breast and lung cancers, hypertension and diabetes, etc.) besides the well known mucopolysaccharidoses. However, their detection by using chromatographic methods is hard, because of the high polarity of negative charges and different functional groups such as acetyl sulfates that generate microheterogenity. In this study, we developed molecularly imprinted chromatographic HPLC columns for specific Heparan Sulfate (HSA), Chondroitin Sulfate (CS) and Dermatan Sulfate (DS) detection in urine. Positively charged acrylamide monomers were first polymerized by precipitation polymerization, to produce polymers which will show specific recognition for GAG's via electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bond formation. These GAG selective polymers were then filled in the steel HPLC columns and columns eluents were chemically degraded. Degradation products of GAG's were examined offline column coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that our imprinted columns separated GAG's specifically and sensitively. Thus, urine GAG's can be specifically determined by using a GAG specific molecularly imprinted column. In this study internal standart weren't used because the matrix effect was lower than 5% for each urine samples. %CV of DS, CS and HSA was calculated as; Supported lipid bilayers (SLB) were started to be used for cell culture studies to focus on cell adhesion, cell signaling etc. Testing the stability of SLBs is essential to utilize them as cell culture platforms. In this study, the stability of phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid bilayers on glass was investigated under Milli-Q water, phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium culture (DME) medium supplemented with/without serum. The stability was also checked by enriching SLB with different lipids. PC-liposomes were prepared by hydrating the dried thin lipid film with PBS and then by extruding the suspension through a polycarbonate membrane. A negatively charged phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (PS, 25%); a positively charged phospholipid, DOTAP (50%) and cholesterol (25%) were also used for liposome preparation. Liposomes were fluorescently labelled and series of SLB imaging were taken for a week.",

LL-37 is an important antimicrobial peptide in human skin and exhibits a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and viral pathogens. Using lignin which is an abundant carbohydrate polymer in nature and a polyacrylic acid, we prepared a polymer film by plastifying caprolactone and polyacyrlic acid. Films were actified to immobilize LL-37. The structure was elucidated in terms of its functional groups by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and the morphology of the film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before and after the immobilization process. The amount of LL-37 immobilized was determined by ELISA method. 99.9% of LL-37 peptide was successfully immobilized onto the films. Antimicrobial activity was determined in the film samples by quantitative antimicrobial activity method. According to the results, LL-37 immobilized film samples were effective on test organisms; Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. In bio-compatibility assays, the ability to support tissue cell integration was detected by using 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Samples were examined under transverse microscope, non-immobilized sample showed a huge cellular death, whereas LL-37 immobilized film had identical cellular growth with the control group. This dual functional film with enhanced antibacterial properties and increased tissue cell compatibility may be used to design new materials for various types of biological applications. P-07.01.

Dupont-Gillain 1 1 Universit e catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, 2 J. Haber Institute of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Krakow, Poland Smart polymer brushes are made of macromolecules that are sensitive to stimuli from the external environment, including pH, ionic strength, temperature, etc. When stimuli-responsive polymer brushes are introduced onto material surfaces, their properties can be adjusted by tuning the environmental stimuli. These brushes can find promising applications across many areas of research, including surface science, nanotechnology, and biotechnology. In our work, the adsorption of human serum albumin (HSA, molecular weight of 66.5 kDa, isoelectric point Ip at pH 4.7) and lysozyme (Lys, molecular weight of 14.3 kDa, Ip~11) was studied on polymer brushes composed of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly (2-(dimethylamine) ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA). PEO is a protein-repellent polymer and PDMAEMA is a polyelectrolyte bearing a variable density of positive charges depending on pH. A gold substrate was modified by these thiolated polymers according to the 'grafting to' method. The obtained polymer brushes were characterized by Xray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, static Contact Angle Measurements and Atomic Force Microscopy. Polymer brush formation and protein adsorption were monitored by Quartz Crystal Microbalance. Surface characterization of the mixed brushes revealed the presence of both polymers at the surface. Conformational changes of PDMAEMA/PEO brushes were experimentally evidenced, and the results indicated that the brushes collapse at pH 9.00 (PDMAEMA is neutral in such conditions) and were swollen at pH 3.5 (PDMAEMA is positively charged). Protein adsorption was performed at different pH values (3.5-9 .0) and salt concentrations (0.001-0.15M). It was shown that PDMAEMA has a high affinity to HSA at pH above its isoelectric point. However, the adsorption of positively charged lysozyme in a wide range of pH was not observed. These results indicate that PDMAEMA/PEO brushes are promising candidates for selective adsorption from a mixture of proteins. Clay-polymer nanocomposites (CPN) developed in recent years as a new type of inorganic-organic hybrid materials that were conceived for medical uses such as tissue engineering or drug delivery [1] , [2] . The understanding of the structure and physico-chemical properties of CPN is a first step in the investigation of biomaterials, but their potential in this respect is determined by their interaction with living tissue components. In this study, pure kaolinite was intercalated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then intercalated kaolinite was modified pyridine, 2-amino pyridine and 2,6-diamino pyridine to expand the interlayer basal spacing. Modified kaolinite samples as filler and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) polymer as matrix were used in the nanocomposite synthesis. Nanocomposites of PVC have been prepared by solvent blending method using THF as a solvent. The material characterizations were carried out by XRD, AFM, FTIR-ATR, DTA/TG and DSC. The XRD results reveal the formation of intercalation/exfoliation of modified kaolinite in the PVC matrix. FTIR and AFM results confirm the presence of nanomaterial in kaolinite/PVC nanocomposites. TGA data show that the modified kaolinit/PVC nanocomposites have significant enhanced thermal stability. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of PVC nanocomposites is higher than that of pure PVC. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of clay-polymer composites were also determined. Introduction: Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biocompatible and biodegradable materials obtained from microorganisms. They are produced in the cytoplasm of several bacteria as energy reserve. The physical properties of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), which is from the group of PHAs, make it a competitive source to petrochemical plastics. PHB has potential in order to be used in a variety of application fields such as packaging industry, printing materials, agriculture and food industry. Furthermore, PHB meets expectations for tissue engineering applications, since it is biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic and has good mechanical properties. Although its many advantages, blending approach could be needed in order to fulfill all expectations of a material. Due to its flexibility, polycaprolactone (PCL) is a promising candidate to be blended with PHB.",

PEI (polyethyleneimine) and RANK complex was loaded into poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanocapsules which are bound to hydroxyapatite (HAP)-specific elastin-like protein (ELP) for targeting to bone tissue. PLGA nanocapsules were prepared by w/o/w double emulsion technique. Affinity of ELP to HAP was determined by FTIR. ELP was coated on the nanocapsules by using the transition temperature of ELP. ELP on PLGA nanocapsules were crosslinked by genipin and binding of ELP on PLGA nanocapsules were studied by XPS and TEM. The optimum ratio of N (PEI) to P (siRNA) in the complexes to be loaded into PLGA nanocapsules were studied by EtBr staining and zeta potential measurements with varying N/P ratios and finally PEI-DNAoligo encapsulation efficiency of the capsules was determined by PicoGreen Reagent.",

The zebrafish exposed to LC50 doses of VD12-09 and VD11-4-2 showed fewer phenotypic abnormalities and less morphological changes compared to the zebrafish treated with the corresponding dose of EZA. VD11-4-2 exhibited 10-25 nM IC50 for both intracellularly and extracellularly expressed CA IX in Xenopus oocytes while exhibiting strong selectivity over CA II, CA IV and CA XII. Discussion: Interestingly, the compounds exhibited 10-fold lower toxicity, induced fewer side effects in zebrafish than EZA and the amount of VD11-4-2 needed to cause complete inhibition of CA IX enzymatic activity in Xenopus oocytes was 30-fold lower than EZA. Conclusions: VD compounds did not lead to deleterious effects on the zebrafish embryonic development and reached the IC50 of 10 nM for CA IX in Xenopus oocytes. The compounds could be further developed as anticancer drugs. CacyBP/SIP is present in various cells and tissues, both normal and pathological. In normal tissues, e.g. stomach or colon, CacyBP/SIP is weakly or barely detected whereas in gastric or colon cancer this protein is expressed at a high level. There are also data indicating that the level of CacyBP/SIP expression correlates with tumor metastatic potency and multidrug resistance. Taking into consideration data that suggest association of CacyBP/SIP with many vital cellular processes, in this work we decided to investigate the possible mechanism involved in regulation of CacyBP/SIP gene expression, mainly by transcription factors and, on the other hand, the influence of CacyBP/SIP on the expression of other genes. We have shown that NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells) influences the CacyBP/SIP gene expression and that overexpression of CacyBP/SIP has an effect on the level of AP-1 and on the activity of NFAT and AP-1 transcription factors. By analyzing the CacyBP/SIP gene promoter sequence we also found potential binding sites for transcription factors from the STAT family, which are involved in interferon signaling. Microarray data indicate that indeed overexpression of CacyBP/SIP affects levels of the STAT proteins as well as of some interferons and interleukins. Based on functional analysis we have found many genes the products of which are involved in immune response. To analyze in more detail the influence of an altered level of CacyBP/SIP on interferon signaling pathways as well as on factors involved in expression of interleukins, including NFkappaB, we plan to apply methods such as luciferase assay, real-time PCR or immunocytochemistry. One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the neuritic plaques occurred as a result of the extracellular accumulation of A\u00df peptides formed from amyloid precursor protein (APP) via the \u00df-amyloidogenic pathway. A\u00df42 is more prone to aggregation to form plaques and more toxic to neurons than A\u00df40. In addition to change in APP metabolism, the decline in levels of neurotransmitter acetylcholine and cholinergic dysfunction are also observed in AD. Thus, current strategies for AD treatment focus on compounds with inhibitory effect on cholinesterases as well as preventive effect on A\u00df aggregation.",

Mavrogonatou, D. Kletsas NCSR 'Demokritos', Athens, Greece Introduction: Intervertebral disc cells are faced with a harsh extracellular milieu characterized by hyperosmotic conditions, nutrient and oxygen deficiency because of the absence of vascularization and oxidative stress due to the accumulation of their metabolism's by-products. We have previously shown that high osmolality is anti-proliferative for disc cells through the activation of the G1 and G2 cell cycle checkpoints by p53 and p38 MAPK, respectively. In addition, we have shown the participation of nine solute transporters, with the a1 subunit of Na + /K + -ATPase being central in this response. Here we assessed the changes in the expression of these key osmo-regulatory molecules during in vitro stress-induced senescence. Materials and Methods: Changes in cell cycle progression were assessed using flow cytometry; overall transcriptional alterations were assessed by whole-genome arrays; differences in expression at the mRNA and protein level were revealed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively; knocking-down of selected proteins was performed by siRNA. Results: High osmolality led to the differential expression of > 200 genes, including nine genes encoding transporters. p38 MAPK and p53 were demonstrated to differently participate in the regulation of the aforementioned transporters, while knocking-down of three selected transporters had a distinct outcome on the overall cellular response towards hyperosmotic stress. These molecules were found to show differences in their expression in senescent cells. Discussion: Given that the presence of senescent cells has been demonstrated in the intervertebral disc in vivo and could most probably attributed to the prevailing stressful conditions, here we showed differences in the expression profile of known key molecules for osmo-adaptation during senescence. Conclusion: Understanding disc cells' physiology is of outmost importance when designing cell-based therapies for disc degenerative disorders.

This study was designed to evaluate follicular fluid (FF) and serum levels of glucoregulatory hormones, amylin and preptin, in infertile women with PCOS and poor responders undergoing IVF/ICSI. Human follicular and serum were obtained from 20 infertile women with PCOS and 20 poor responder participants undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) with gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocol for IVF/ICSI treatment. FF and serum amylin and preptin levels were measured by ELISA. It was found that FF and serum amylin and preptin were lower in infertile women with PCOS when compared with poor responder participants. FF amylin and preptin concentrations were lower than that of the serum amylin and preptin concentrations. Decreased follicular fluid amylin and preptin levels suggest that amylin and preptin may have a physiological role in follicular maturation via controlling local glucose homeostasis. Despite high serum levels of amylin and preptin in PCOS their low concentration within the follicle may be main culprit of defective folliculogenesis seen in PCOS subjects. Similar to insulin resistance in PCOS subjects existence of amylin and preptin resistance support the critical role of both peptides in follicular maturation in PCOS.

Oncolytic viral therapy is based on the capabilities of selective lysis of tumor cells and is a prospective trend in cancer disease treatment. In vitro experiments showed that plant Rhabdoviruses does not have any direct cytotoxic effect upon Sarcoma 37 cells, causes induction of apoptosis in these cells and does not pose any threat to somatic cells of warm-blooded animals, which makes it possible to use this virus for therapy of malignant neoplasms. Buckwheat burn virus (BBV), the prototypic member of the family Rhabdoviridae, contains surface glycoprotein and which is lectin-active. Its carbohydrate branch can aid adhesion of lymphocytes to tumor cells. The present study has addressed the effect of BBV on cancer cell viability. All studies were carried out after 1 week of inoculated with Erlich Cancernome (2 9 10 6 cells/animal, i. p.) in 2 months male Balb/C mice treated at once with or without plant extract with BBV (15 mg/kg, i. p.). By fluorescent microscopy and using two due staining by acredine orange and propidium iodide it was found that in the 3rd day of administration of BBV lead to increasing of necrotic and apoptotic cells on 45% and 4% respectively versus to untreated group. At the same time the viability of investigated cells was impaired too and according to flow cytometry analysis using propidium iodide the amount of dead cells was elevated by fivefold (17.7% versus 3.5% in untreated group). Also as was shown in previously reports BBV decreased activity of macrophages in the early stages after injection and it may have a positive effect when using this drug in tumor therapy. When using this drug appears to slow down the possibility of a sharp activation of macrophages, and as a consequence of the development of cytotoxic effect will be prolonged.",

(Ranunculaceae) (NS) is traditionally used to treat many conditions such as inflammation. This study evaluates the effects of NS seeds ethanol extract in paracetamol-induced acute nephrotoxicity in rats. Material Method: Forty-eight female Wistar Albino rats were divided into eight groups: I = sham; II = sham + 1000 mg/kg NS; III = sham + 140 mg/kg (N-acetyl cysteine) NAC; IV = 2 g/ kg paracetamol; V = 2 g/kg paracetamol + 140 mg/kg NAC; VI, VII and VIII = 2 g/kg paracetamol + 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg NS, respectively. Paracetamol administration (oral) was carried out 1 h after NS and NAC administrations (oral), and all animals were sacrificed 24 h later. Result: Urea and creatinine levels were determined in serum, while glutathione, malondialdehyde levels and superoxide dismutase activity were determined in the kidney tissues. There were significant increases in the serum levels of urea and creatinine in the paracetamol-administered group. Serum levels of urea and creatinine were decreased in all groups administered NS with paracetamol. NS administration dramatically restored SOD, GSH, and MDA levels in the kidneys. Conclusion: The results suggest NS has a significant nephroprotective activity on paracetamol-induced nephrotoxicity. It may be suggested that the antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects of NS ethanolic extract originated from different compounds of its black seeds. P-02.08.5-006",

P-02.08.5-008 Alternative splicing regulation of SR proteins in response to environmental stress in Chinese cabbage Serine/arginine-rich protein (SR protein) family, which acts as RNA-binding protein, plays a major role in post-transcriptional regulation of pre-mRNA, such as alternative splicing (AS). These proteins cause pleiotropic effect by regulating AS of pre-mRNA in a tissue and developmental stage-specific and stress-responsive manner in Arabidopsis. Here, we identified 31 genes encoding SR proteins in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa Chiifu-401) from Brassica database and analyzed their phylogenetic relationship. B. rapa has 31 types of SR protein that are classified into common (SR, RSZ and SC) and plant specific (SCL, RS2Z, RS and SR-like) subfamily similar with Arabidopsis. Interestingly, the AS pattern of most SR genes changed at the late stage (14 and 21 days after germination). To verify the correlation between SR genes and environmental stress, we screened the AS pattern of SR genes to various abiotic stress using RT-PCR and a microarray analysis. In particular, the expression level and the AS pattern of Bra015576 and Bra018581 were affected significantly by heat stress. These results suggest that the AS regulation by SR protein correlates with adaptation mechanism to the environmental stress in Chinese cabbage.

Proteomic analyses were performed using an LC-MS-based analyses and an UHR q-TOF mass spectrometer. The candidate peptides were targeted via Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) and Triplestage quadrupole (TSQ) mass spectrometer. In total, 4092 proteins were identified, which represents a three-to four-fold increase compared with the standard shotgun analysis of the same sample. Out of these, 2240 were only accessible by one of the techniques and, besides, the detection limits were not similar. We hypothesized that an SRM-based targeted analysis will allow detection and quantitation of most of these proteins, even without the application of proteome fractionation. We can conclude that all peptides from the library with MS/MS spectra of the total intensity above 10,000 are easily detectable in the total protein extracts. P-02.08.5-012 Transcriptome sequencing based identification of alternative oxidase genes in white waterlily, Nymphaea alba Alternative oxidases (AOXs) are the terminal oxidases in the respiratory electron transport chain of plants. They reduce molecular oxygen to water with low proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane. In plants, AOXs increase local tissue temperature to release volatile compounds thereby attracting pollinator insects and regulation of mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway. Regulation of retrograde signaling pathway is currently under investigation to improve cultivation studies in many plants. Water lilies are aquatic ornamental and economically valuable plants classified under Nymphaea family. Nymphaea alba, white water-lily, has a special focus since its applications in landscaping of parks and gardens, farming as vegetable and medical applications. However, cultivation of N. alba is a challenging process. We hypothesized that by controlling alternative oxidases, success rate can be increased for N. alba cultivation. To identify alternative oxidase encoding genes in N. alba, we performed transcriptome analysis. By using transcriptome analysis data, AOX gene sequences, subcellular localization of AOX proteins and structural modelling of AOX proteins were predicted. In 272934 transcripts, database search with Trinotate tool revealed 77 transcripts with AOX domains characterized in known alternative oxidases. Blast analysis of these 77 sequences with known AOX proteins revealed three distinct AOX genes (Nalba-AOX1, Nalba-AOX2 and Nalba-AOX4). After subcellular localization analysis of three identified AOX proteins by using TargetP server tool, Nalba-AOX1, Nalba-AOX2 are predicted as mitochondrial while Nalba-AOX4 is localized in chloroplasts. Template based structural modelling results showed that all identifed proteins are statistically similar to known structure models of corresponding AOXs. Most environmental contaminants have toxic and mutagenic effects on living organisms as a result of the activation of free radical formation and inhibition of reparation activity.

In this work we focused on comparison of inhibitor of the cytokinin degradation INCYDE (2-chloro-6-(3-methoxyphenyl)aminopurine) and exogenous application of trans-zeatin on Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Transcripts of genes regulating cytokinin metabolism were analysed by RT-qPCR analysis. Classical cytokinin root essay revealed that INCYDE effect is comparable to that of trans-zeatin in a similar concentration-dependent manner. Besides a negative effect on the primary root length, both substances induce flavonoid accumulation and an increase in the root hairs formation. Histochemical staining of transgenic plants expressing glucuronidase (GUS) under cytokinin-responsive promoter of ARR5 gene revealed increased GUS activity in cotyledons following INCYDE treatment suggesting diverse localization of cytokinin modulation upon trans-zeatin and INCYDE treatment, respectively. Possible molecular differences originating in different cytokinin population and distribution following trans-zeatin or INCYDE treatments were monitored on the level of gene expression and via an LC-MS proteome analysis in roots and shoots of 14-day-old plantlets. RT-qPCR analysis revealed an alteration in cytokinin metabolism that could explain observed differences on the proteome level between INCYDE and trans-zeatin treated seedlings. Pharmacologically inhibited cytokinin degradation could be very efficient tool for modulation of cytokinin levels. Interestingly, the application of INCYDE and trans-zeatin shows a contrasting spatial and temporal pattern on molecular levels.

Kinetic parameters were also measured; Vmax was 1.998 U/ml min and Km was 3.998 mg/ml. It is concluded that the elevated expression extent of recombinant alpha-amylase together with appropriate qualifications could make the clone a good choice for various industrial applications. Flax seedlings of cultivars TMP1919, Lira and lines G-1071/ 4_o, G-1071/4_k were treated for 4 and 24 hours with 500 lM AlCl 3 solution or distilled water (control).

The molecular determinants of seed response to these treatments are not established and no genomic studies of plant seed response to NR have been reported. We studied the effects of pre-sowing seed treatment, using vacuum (7 min), radio-frequency EF (5-15 min) and CP (2-7 min), on germination and growth of non-oilseed Helianthus annuus. To gain an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying effect of NR on sunflower seed germination and dormancy, we estimated changes induced in the balance of plant hormones and differential protein expression. The results of the germination tests and estimation of seedling morphology showed that response develops in time and is stronger when sowing is performed in 7 days in comparison to 3 days after seed treatment. The 2D DIGE analysis revealed 38 differentially expressed proteoforms in kernels of seeds treated with CP or EF. Proteins involved in biological processes of seed maturation, response to stress, response to abscisic acid stimulus, processes of organonitrogen compound metabolism and glucose catabolism were identified. While expression patterns for majority of the proteins were highly specific to CP and EF treated seed kernels, accumulation of several proteoforms of seed storage proteins (SSP), including vincilin-like, miraculin-like protein and albumin-8 were common for both experimental groups. This suggested that response to NR treatment could be at least partially associated to function of SSPs in response to oxidative stress that protects proteins required for seed germination and seedling formation. Variation of abundance of distinct proteoforms of helianthinin, vicilin-like and 11s globulin-like SSPs suggested that post-translational modifications are involved in regulation of the function of SSPs.

The B3 TFs constitute a large, plant-specific protein family (approx. 10% of all TF proteins in the flowering plants), which is characterized by the presence of one or several small (approx. 110 amino acids) B3 DNA binding domains. Currently the B3 TFs are divided into four groups (LEC2-ABI3/VAL, ARF, RAV and REM). The preferred recognition sites were identified for representatives of all groups except the REM family. Currently, only a single structure of a DNA-bound B3 domain (ARF1, ARF family) is available, thus the mechanism of site-specific DNA recognition by the LEC2-ABI3/VAL and RAV B3 domains remains poorly understood.",

P-02.08.5-027 Immunohistochemical analysis of inhibitory effects of Origanum hypericifolium oil on Dipeptidyl peptidase IV in streptozotocininduced diabetic rats P. Ili 1 , A. Zeytunluoglu 2 1 Denizli Health Services Vocational High School, Pamukkale University, Denizli, 2 Denizli Vocational School of Technical Sciences, Pamukkale University, Denizli, Turkey Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious metabolic disorder with micro-and macro-vascular complications that result in a significant morbidity and mortality. GLP-1 and GIP have significant role in pancreatic beta cells and prevention of inactivation of them by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) inhibition is a novel approach to treatment of DM. Origanum hypericifolium (Lamiaceae) is an endemic Turkish plant and its essential oil is mainly composed of monoterpenes including carvacrol and thymol. Streptozotocin (STZ) is used to induce diabetes in rats. The aim of this study is to investigate the inhibitory effects of O. hypericifolium essential oil on the DPP IV in STZ-induced diabetic rats. The animals (female Spraque-Dawley rats) were assigned to four groups (Group 1: Control, Group 2: STZinduced diabetic, Group 3: O. hypericifolium injected, Group 4: STZ-induced diabetic and O. hypericifolium injected). DM was experimentally induced in Groups 2 and 4 by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ at a dose of 45 mg/kg body weight. In Groups 3 and 4, rats were intraperitoneally injected with O. hypericifolium oil at a daily dose of 1 ml/kg body weight for 42 consecutive days. At the end of the experimental period, all animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under ether anesthesia and liver and kidney tissues of each animal were rapidly excised. Tissues were fixed in Sainte-Marie fixative. After routine histological processes, samples were embedded in paraffin, immunohistochemical staining for DPP IV was performed on sections and then they were photographed. The immunohistochemical reaction intensity differences were observed between the groups. In conclusion, the immunohistochemical distribution of DPP IV in the tissues that the test oil was applied in the diabetic rats may be important for the investigation of the inhibitory effects of oil on the enzyme. Moreover, our findings suggest that O. hypericifolium oil may be used for prevention of diabetic diseases. Introduction: All eukaryotic cells need microtubules for purposes of nuclear and cell division, organization of intracellular structure, and intracellular transportation, as well as ciliary and flagellar motility. Microtubules are made of polymerized a/btubulin subunits. MEC17 is important for microtubules, because it encodes the enzyme that adds acetyl groups to Lysine 40 (K40) of tubulin. K40 is largely conserved in a-tubulins of many eukaryotes, and acetylation is thought to stabilize microtubule structure. In algae, the effect of acetylation by MEC17 on flagellar motility and phototaxis has not been tested previously. Materials and methods: In this study, mec17 mutant Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells were compared to wild-type cells to see the effect on flagellar motility and phototaxis. We tested phototaxis, eyespot size and quantity under the microscopy. In addition to this, we fixed cells and examined them by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies to tubulin, acetylated tubulin, and photoreceptor. Results: We observed that some mec17 mutant cells contain more than one eyespot.",

The disease can cause up to an 80% yield loss in sunflower production. Downy mildew Resistance genes (R) denoted as Pl has been discovered to date in sunflower. In recent years, Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers have become widely used in plant breeding programs. In this study SNP markers have been currently developing for Pl 6 , Pl 8 , Pl 13 , Pl arg genes by Competitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assay which enables bi-allelic scoring of SNPs and insertions/deletions (Indels) at specific loci. In total 66 Sequence Tagged Site (STS) sequences from NCBI were aligned for Pl 6 , Pl 8 , Pl 13 , Pl arg genes to identify conserved regions for each gene. Based on the conserved regions, specific PCR primers were designed in order to make sequencing of these genes in five crosses and their F 2 progenies. Sequence data will be used to design an allele specific primer maches the target SNP and amplifies the target region with the common reverse primer provided by KASP Genotyping Assay. SNP markers linked to Pl genes which are being developed in this study, have the potential to be used in Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) for sunflower breeding programs.

Some of the DNA sequences located on different sub-genomes showed polymorphic nucleotides including C/T and G/A polymorphisms. In silico analysis indicated that some alleles located on different sub-genomes of cotton have C/T and G/A polymorphisms. C/T polymorphisms between the sub-genomes could be thought as unmethylated cytosine using the bisulfite sequencing technique. This indicated that an extra attention needs to be paid in DNA total cytosine methylation studies in polyploid species such as cotton using bisulfite sequencing, methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP), whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Otherwise, T in C/T polymorphism between the subgenomes could be thought as unmethylated cytosine.

Minisatellites, also called variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), are composed of arrays of longer repeats mostly dispersed throughout heterochromatin (centromeres and telomeres). Direct amplification of minisatellite regions of DNA using a single core primer is a powerful method to amplify minisatellites (DAMD-PCR). Although the DAMD-PCR technique has been applied to many plant species, the level of polymorphisms in cotton (Gossypium L.) is very low due to very narrow Turkish cotton genetic base.

Karaca Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey Assignment of genes and DNA markers on chromosomes is very important in life sciences, especially for plant breeding and medicine. There are several methods for the assignment of a gene or DNA sequence to a specific location on a chromosome. For example, the most widely used technique is the assignment of fluorescently-labeled gene or DNA sequences (markers) on chromosomes using the fluorescently-labeled gene (for instance, FISH technique). Another example is the construction of a genetic map (linkage map) which orders the targeted genes along the DNA strand based on recombination frequency. Sequencing is the most precise technique in which coding (gene-containing) and noncoding DNA region of genes could be located on a chromosome molecule. Aneuploid lines could also be used to locate genes in a specific chromosome, but maintenance of these lines is difficult.

Drought-related genes were investigated in leaves and roots of three wheat genotypes after different drought stress treatments by RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) technology and de novo assembly was performed before comparative transcriptome analysis. Analyzing 311 gigabases of 100 bp paired end Illumina reads from a hexaploid wheat poly(A) RNA library, we identified common and new differentially expressed transcripts. Selected differentially expressed genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR. We also performed root proteome analysis with nano electrospray ionization source coupled to a high-performance liquid chromatography system (nanoUPLC\u00c0ESI\u00c0qTOF\u00c0MS) to identify drought-related proteins. Totally 191 proteins were differentially expressed in root tissues of tolerant and non-tolerant wheat genotypes. Responses of antioxidative defense system to drought stress were comparatively studied in the same wheat cultivars. Similarities between protein and RNA levels help increase our confidence in novel biomarkers, differences may also reveal other post-transcriptional regulatory junctures. All these analyses will allow us to get a better idea about the possible role of these genes in the drought-response mechanism. The drought-related genes that are functionally characterized could be introduced into agronomically important wheat cultivars. This work offers a resource for accelerating drought-related gene discovery and improving this important crop. P-02.08.5-048 Isolation and characterization of a hexose converter from olive S.

The aim of this study was to identify and characterize the key biochemical and genetic components of oleocanthal biosynthesis. To determine the biochemical components of the pathway, multiple olive cultivars along with their spatial and temporal points were determined. The expression levels of multiple candidate genes were also aimed via real-time PCR. Nucleotide BLAST and protein BLAST (for comparison of the similarity of the candidate genes with that of other organisms) were conducted on NCBI web page. Phylogenetic tree construction, amino acid composition analysis, nucleotide composition analysis, hydropathy analysis and translations through ExPASY were conducted. Primer3 was used to design forward and reverse primers to amplify the target genes from different olive tissues at different times. Analysis of the first candiate gene with BioEdit program revealed that A+T ratio was more than G+C according to the nucleotide composition analysis. According to amino acid composition analysis isoleucine, lysine and leucine were more than other amino acids while Kyte&Doolittle hyddropathy analysis revealed that the protein was hydrophilic. Abundance of hydrophobic amino acids (leucine and isolecine) along with an abundant hydrophilic amino acid (lysine) suggest the existance of hydrophobic pockets in the protein which may mean a membrane bound protein or a sitoplasmic protein with a strong hydrophobic core.

Serine/arginine rich splicing factors are essential in seqeunce specific splicing of pre-mRNAs. In this study we report molecular characterization of an serine/arginine rich SC35 splicing factor (OeSARsc35SF) that was isolated from a cDNA library constructed from olive pedicels. Nucleotide BLAST and protein BLAST (for comparison of the similarity of the candidate genes from other organisms) were conducted on NCBI web page. Amino acid composition analysis, nucleotide composition analysis, hydropathy analysis, open reading frame determiantion, through, molecular weight and the isoelectric points calculations were conducted using online ExPasy software. Primer3 was used to design forward and reverse primers to amplify the target gene from different olive tissues at different times. Analysis with BioEdit program revealed that A+T ratio was more than that of G+C. OeSARsc35SF was a protein consisting of 267 amino acids. As expected, amino acid composition analysis revealed that serines and arginines were more than other amino acids. Kyte&Doolittle hyddropathy analysis revealed that the protein was hydrophilic. The molecular weight of the protein was 30 kDa with an isoelectric point (pI) of 11.5. The protein was found to have a signal peptide. According to the Predotar analysis results, intracellular localization was found to be in the mitochondrial. The combined results suggest OeSARsc35SF might function as splicing factor as its homologs from the other plants. Confirming this hypothesis with futher experimental characterization including biochemical function analysis continues.",

However, any of the application doses showed an apoptotic effect on MCF-7 cells. They exhibited a necrotic effect rather than the apoptotic effect. Although alterations in expression levels of these genes were determined, this alterations was statistically insignificant.

Chemists call it a plant sterol ester. It is found in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. It is used to make medicine. Beta-sitosterol is used for heart disease and high cholesterol. The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows manufacturers to claim that foods containing plant sterol esters such as beta-sitosterol are for reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Centranthus longiflorus (CL) is used in alternative medicine for sleep disorders. A plant of Turkish origin, CL used as folk medicine have remained uninvestigated for familial hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease and preventing colon cancer for their in vitro biological activity despite their use for sleep disorders. We investigated of the chemical constituents from dried aerial parts of Centranthus longiflorus. Material and method: Aerial parts of CL were collected in Erzurum province. Hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol extraction were done by Soxhlet extractor. The plant extracts obtained from the aerial parts of CL was analyzed using a Perkin-Elmer GC-MS system. Results: Ten compounds were obtained and identified as Butanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid), 7-Methyl-Z-tetradecen-1-ol acetate, octadecanoic acid (stearic acid), diisobutyl Phthalate, 9-octadecenamide, octacosane, nonacosane, alfa amyrin and beta sitosterol. The latter two were obtained in all extraction (hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol). Discussion and conclusion: All of these compounds are isolated from Centranthus longiflorus for the first time. These findings may shed light on the design of new drugs, the cholesterollowering effect.

            "text": "Photosynthetic reactions taking place in thylakoid membranes of higher plants are extremely sensitive towards different environmental stress conditions such as high and low temperature, high light intensity, UV radiation etc. Carotenoids are intrinsic component of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes and are involved in performing multiple important functions. Their role of accessory pigments in absorbing sun light, participation in photoprotection via dissipation of excess absorbed light, deactivating of stress-induced reactive oxygen species and structural role are well documented and recognized. The role of lack of lutein in high light-induced alterations in structural organization and functional activity of the main pigment-protein complexes was evaluated using isolated thylakoid membranes of Arabidopsis thaliana, wt and mutant lut2, deficient in lutein, subjected to photoinhibitory treatment for different periods of time. Alterations in photochemical activity of photosystem I and photosystem II were determined by a Clark-type electrode in the presence of exogenous electron donors and acceptors. Activity of oxygenevolving complex and of the grana and stroma situated photosystem II reaction centers was evaluated by determination of flash oxygen yields and initial oxygen burst under constant light without donors and acceptors. Low-temperature (77K) fluorescence was applied for unraveling of light-induced alterations in energy transfer and interaction between the main pigment-protein complexes. Maximal quantum efficiency of PSII was registered by Pulse Amplitude modulated fluorescence method. Results obtained are discussed in respect to the importance of lutein for the organization and sensitivity of photosynthetic apparatus towards high light intensity treatment. Modern agriculture relies heavily on phosphate rock fertilizer to improve phosphorus availability in many soils, but this approach is not sustainable long-term. Phytate (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) is an organic phosphorus compound often present in many soils. However, phytate can not be utilized by most plants, and its accumulation in soil leads to substantial ecological problems. Phytases are enzymes that hydrolyze phytate and release inorganic phosphate. Many microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi synthesize highly diverse phytases which are suitable for plant biotechnology. Generation of transgenic plants expressing phytases of bacterial origin has been proposed as one option to improve plant phosphorus nutrition.",

            "text": "Photosynthesis of higher plants is the principle process to transform light energy into biochemical usable energy. In nature, plants are exposed to the environment where light, temperature, UV-B radiation varied and very often their extreme values that are unfavorable for effective performance of photosynthetic reactions. Plant are developed various strategies to cope with stress including radical scavenging enzyme system, accumulation of protective compounds, etc. Pigment-protein complexes of photosystem I and photosystem II and their light harvesting antenna, situated within thylakoid membranes, are involved in the primary reactions of photosynthesis -absorption of light, charge separation and electron transport. Photosynthetic process is sensitive towards higher than optimal temperatures, the photosystem II and oxygen evolving complexes being extremely sensitive to elevation of temperature. In present work PAM fluorescence was applied to evaluate the effect of long term action of elevated temperature (38/30\u00b0C) on the quantum yield of photosystem II, non-photochemical quenching and Rdf, the latter quantifying the photosynthetic process. In addition, the activity of oxygen evolving complex was determined polarographically in the presence of exogenous electron acceptor 1,4 -benzoquinone. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blot were applied to determine the damage of D1 -reaction center protein of photosystem II. Alterations of mutual organization within photosystem II complex and its antenna and of energy interaction between them were followed by analysis of 77K steady state chlorophyll fluorescence spectra. The simultaneous application of high temperature and high light intensity resulted in a well pronounced reduction of non-photochemical quenching that restore to the initial values after recovery for 5 days at optimal conditions. D1 was also restored while quantum efficiency of photosystem II did not recuperate to initial values. P-02.08.5-068 Reorganization of the main pigment-protein complexes in thylakoid membranes from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) during long term exposure to elevated temperature The changes of Earth climate resulted in unfavorable environment for plants. Depending on the duration of influence of stress factors, the response of plants includes short and long term acclimation. The population, structure and organization of pigmentprotein complexes within thylakoid membranes are dynamic and flexible, thus providing for the acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus to the changed environment. The main pigment-protein complexes, involved in energy transduction, are photosystem I, photosystem II and light harvesting complexes. They are separated in grana and stroma regions of thylakoid membranes but it is well established that they can rearrange as a result of alterations of light intensity, temperature increase and decrease in order to balance the perception and utilization of excitation energy. In present work the effect of long term action of elevated temperature on organization and stoichiometry of main pigmentprotein complexes in the thylakoid membranes from tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum cv. M82) was investigated. Three weeks old tomato grown at optimal conditions (22/20\u00b0C day/ night temperature and light intensity 250 lmol/m 2 /s) plants were exposed for 2 and 6 days to elevated temperature at 38/30\u00b0C. By means of blue-native electrophoresis the effect elevated temperature on the populations of PSII (dimmer and monomers) and LHCII (monomers and trimers) was estimated and compared with the same parameters for control plants. The ability of plants to recover from this treatment was checked after 5 days under optimal conditions. The changes of content of chlorophylls and carotenoids were determined at every stage of treatment. Based on the results obtained it can be concluded that one of the mechanisms for regulating the energy balance and maintenance of efficient photosynthetic process involves a change in the organization and stoichiometry of the photosystem II and oligomer state of light harvesting complex II. Aim of the study, was to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of Silymarin, Curcumin and Propolis on leptin-induced MCF-7 cells.",

P-02.08.5-070 Investigation of some lichen-derived substances' cosmetic potential for skin protection against ultraviolet B Due to the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer and chronic exposure, the occurrence of various skin diseases have been increased in recent decades. Thence, people and cosmetic companies have progressively given more importance natural sunscreen products for the protection from harmful sun rays, especially ultraviolet B rays. We, therefore, isolated some lichen-derived substances; 3-hydroxyphysodic acid and protolichesterinic acid from Hypogymnia tubulosa and Cetraria aculeate, respectively. Chemical characterization and identification of the isolated lichen substances were accomplished by using FTIR, 1 H-NMR and melting point analyses. The theoretical UV-vis spectra and 3D conformations of the isolated compounds were determined by using the Gaussian 03 software with HF theory at the B3LYP/3-21G level. The dark toxicities and ultraviolet B protection capacities of the substances were lighted up as previously described [1, 2] on HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line by using MTT cell viability and LDH cellular membrane degradation assays. The obtained results from the assays showed that protolichesterinic acid has a more dark toxic activity on keratinocyte cells than 3hydroxyphysodic acid, and the toxic activities were found sufficient as much as 80% at the highest doses of the substances; 400 lM. However, it was observed that the cytotoxicity of the substances were reduced at the rate of approximately 15% by the irradiation. Consequently, we think that the substances block the ultraviolet B rays but their cytotoxic feature is an important limitation to their usage in cosmetic industry.

The testing of naturally produced compounds seems to be the best and inexpensive way to search for potentially photoprotective substances. On the other hand, as photo-resistant species, lichens are still poorly exploited. Norstictic acid was, therefore, isolated from the acetone extract of Pleurosticta acetabulum. FTIR, 1 H-NMR and melting point analyses were performed to identify the chemical features of norstictic acid. Gaussian 03 software with HF theory at the B3LYP/3-21G level was also performed to determine the theoretical UV-vis spectrum and 3D conformation of the isolated compound. The dark cytotoxicity and ultraviolet B-protection capacity of norstictic acid were comparatively tested as previously described [1, 2] by using MTT cell viability and LDH cellular membrane degradation assays. As a result of the experiments, it is observed that norstictic acid has a dark-cytotoxicity as less as 25% at the highest dose of the substance; 400 lM. However, ultraviolet B-induced damage on human keratinocytes was blocked by the lower concentrations of norstictic acid as 25, 50 and 100-lM, and 20% of cells were protected according to the control experiments of irradiated cells. Consequently, we think that norstictic acid might be employed as a sun protection factor at the low concentrations, and further studies should be performed.",

Zizania aquatica L., Zizania palustris L. and Zizania texana Hitche are found in North America, whereas Zizania latifolia (Griseb) Turcz) is native to East Asia. CWR mainly grows in the areas along the Yangzi River and the Huai River in China without any cultivation and domestication. CWR was an ancient grain that has been used in Chinese herbal medicine to treat a variety of ailments associated with nutrition, including gastrointestinal disorders and diabetes. Our previous studies have demonstrated that consuming Chinese wild rice can significantly improve blood lipid profiles and ameliorate high-fat/cholesterol diet-induced insulin resistance. However, compared to the well studied common dietary white rice, active composition and the associated proteomic information of Chinese wild rice have yet to be investigated. In this study, we compared and analysed the different proteins between Chinese wild rice and white rice by proteomics method. Our study provides insights and experimental evidence for further exploration of this ancient medical food in disease prevention and therapy. The homology between CWR and N22 is 64%, but significant differences also exist between the two. We gained new insight by analyzing the biological function of the high reliability (credibility score 67 or higher, p < 0.05) peptide mass fingerprint of CWR2-DE electrophoresis revealed differences in protein composition between CWR and N22. Information obtained from the PMF indicates that glutelin precursor, caffeoyl coenzyme A (CoA) Omethyltransferase and putative bithoraxoid-like protein can provide gene evidences for its biological function. P-02.08.5-075 Mir396 and growth-regulating factors interaction during maize leaf growth under low-temperature stress G. Aktug, F. Aydinoglu Gebze Technical University, Kocaeli, Turkey MicroRNA (miRNA) genes are a class of non-coding small RNAs about 21 nucleotide-long which are revealed as regulators of plant growth and stress responses. The miRNA miR396 targets and regulates Growth-Regulating Factors (GRFs) which are plant specific transcription factors family and this regulation machinery is conserved among plant species. Plant growth is a result of cell division and expansion which took place as spatial gradient zones throughout maize leaf which are meristem, elongation and mature zones. Cells proliferate in meristem, migrate to elongation zone and finally reach to mature zone to get its final size. It has been shown that miR396 affects cell division by regulating GRFs and changes leaf size which are determined by cell number and cell size of leaf. This study aims to investigate the role of miR396 and GRFs interaction during maize leaf growth under low-temperature stress.",

P-02.08.5-077 Cytotoxic effect of fractionated triterpenoid glycosides from Holothuria polii in human cancer cells Sea cucumbers are the members of class Holothuroidea and they have more than 1100 described living species all around the world. Sea cucumbers secrete special secondary metabolites from their body walls and they are called triterpene glycosides (TGGs). In this study, cytotoxic activity of fractionated TTGs from H. polii on different cancer cell lines were carried out. H. polii Delle Chiaje, 1824 samples were collected from Dikili-_ Izmir. The semipurified extracts were fractioned by using HPLC. Four different fractions (fraction A-D) were obtained. In order to characterize the fractions, MALDI-TOF/MS was used. The cytotoxic activity of the fraction A-D were tested on HT-29, T84 and UPCI-SCC-131 cell lines by using xCELLigence RTCA SP system. The cells were treated with three different concentrations of the fractions for 48 hours. The cell index data were compared with the control group. IC50 values of the fractions for three cell lines were calculated. According to the results, the fractions have Holothurin A (1243.50 m/z), 24-dehydroechinoside A, Scabraside A or Fuscocinerosides B/C isomer (1227.50 m/z). The fraction D was the most effective on all cell lines with IC50 value of 10.46 AE 0.18 mg/l, 11.24 AE 0.57 mg/l and 11.13 AE 0.29 mg/l for HT-29, UPCI-SCC-131 and T84, respectively.

Glycogen is a multi-branched polysaccharide that serves as the main form of glucose storage in the body, where the main reserves are in the liver and muscle. It has been observed that glycogen metabolism is altered in many tumor types, and that glycogen content is inversely correlated with proliferation rate. In addition, it has recently been described that when glycogen accumulation is forced in glioblastoma U87 cells in hypoxia, senescence is induced and tumor growth is inhibited in vivo. Our laboratory has various animal models with different parts of the glycogen metabolism pathway affected. Most notably, we have two animal models lacking glycogen: muscle glycogen synthase (GYS1 KO) and liver glycogen synthase (GYS2 KO) knockout animals. We isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from GYS1 KO to perform replicative senescence assays. In addition, we induced hepatocellular carcinomas in GYS2 KO animals via N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) injections in order to track tumorigenesis in animals lacking hepatic glycogen. Lastly, we performed partial hepatectomies (PHX), which involves the resection of two thirds of the liver, on GYS2 KOs to evaluate the effect of the lack of glycogen on hepatocyte proliferation. Interestingly, we have observed that glycogen levels are increased in human and mouse fibroblasts under replicative senescence, and that MEFs depleted of glycogen bypass senescence and immortalize faster than WTs. We have also demonstrated that senescence pathways are down regulated in MEFs lacking glycogen. Furthermore, GYS2 KOs treated with DEN show higher tumor burden and mortality than controls. We also evaluated the effect of glycogen on hepatocyte proliferation after PHX. GYS2 KO mice present faster proliferation and liver regeneration rates, when compared to WT counterparts. Collectively, our preliminary data suggest that glycogen metabolism plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell cycle in both physiological and pathological states. It is established that pineal is involved in circadian regulation of testosterone secretion from Leydig cells. However, the precise routes of this regulatory involvement are still unknown. As cGMP has been also regarded as modulator of steroidogenesis we sought to study the effects of pineal removal on the circadian pattern of cGMP variations and expression of the genes that encode elements of NO-cGMP signaling pathway in adult rat Leydig cells.",

The transcription of Prkg1, the main effector in this signaling pathway was not affected with pineal abolition. Additionally, pinealectomy did not influence the circadian transcription profile of Coxi2 or other investigated genes (Coxi1, Nrf1, Nrf2a, Pgc1a) related to mitochondrial function and biogenesis.

Further studies based on these data are needed to better understand the relationship between pineal and circadian rhythm of testosterone production. Influenza is a contagious respiratory infection caused by a variety of influenza viruses. Neuraminidase inhibitors is a new class of antiviral drugs that inhibit influenza viruses. The most popular antiviral agents is Oseltamivir, having a commercial name of Tamiflu, within anti-influenza antivirals. As well as Tamiflu is a member of neuraminidase inhibitor group drug. Therefore, this study was performed to determine the effect of Tamiflu on cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Material and methods: For examining the presence of the indirect mutagenic effect of oseltamivir in iver S9 fraction mix was used. Cells were treated with 0.5, 1 and 2 lg/ml oseltamivir, the Tamiflu capsule ingradient, for 24 or 48 hours in the absence or presence of an exogenous metabolic activation system. The test chemical did not demonstrate any genotoxic effect dose-dependently but it showed a weak cytotoxicity on cells in this study. On the other hand, some concentrations of Tamiflu induced SCE and also decreased significantly the proliferation index (p \u02c2 0.05) in the absence of S9 mix. Result: Tamiflu did not induce significant increases of CA or micronucleated cells in vitro in cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes under the treatment conditions used but week SCE induction was observed. On the other hand, the weak cytotoxic effects observed disappeared in the cultures treated in presence of the S9 mix. Discuss and conclusion: Tamiflu weakly induced SCE at the highest concentration with/without added S9 mix in cultured human peripheral lympocytes. It could be assumed to be a SCE inducer. SCEs can be increased by several agents that attack DNA. Tamiflu decreased the proliferation index and nuclear division index at some concentrations thus interferring it as being weakly cytotoxic, though this effect disappeared in the presence of S9 mix applications. This finding is important for showing the inefficiency of Tamiflu metabolites on the cell cycle. Introduction: Chronic renal failure as a result of the progression of diabetic nephropathy is the main cause of mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes. Chronic hemodialysis is a life-saving therapy for patients with strong renal disorders. The main goal of hemodialysis is toxins removal from the patient. The monitoring of hemodialysis is the best way for biomedical evaluation of correctness and efficiency of this clinical treatment.",

However, these methods are complex in application, have low selectivity, and require pretreatment of samples. Materials and Methods: We propose for levels of glucose, urea and creatinine detection the potentiometric multibiosensor based on pH-sensitive field-effect transistors and immobilized enzymes developed in our laboratory. Results: We developed a potentiometric multibiosensor and studied its main analytical characteristics. Linear dynamic ranges of determination of substrates were following: 0.08 -1 mM of glucose, 0.1-10 mM of urea, and 0.02 -2 mM of creatinine. It was shown that the potentiometric multibiosensor had good reproducibility, and its bioselective elements were working independently from each other, because test of substrates cross-selectivity was negative. Discussion and conclusion: Very sensitive, fast and selective multibiosensor for simultaneous measurement of three metabolites in a single cycle based on pH-sensitive field-effect transistors and immobilized enzymes is developed. The developed potentiometric multibiosensor was verified by quantitative analysis of glucose, urea and creatinine in blood serum of patients with diabetic nephropathy. P-03.04.4-002 pH-dependent interaction of asymmetrically charged peptides with a protein nanopore Over the past two decades, the ability to use natural or artificial nanopores to probe at uni-molecular level the structural and kinetic features of various bio-molecules (peptides, DNA, RNA) was successfully achieved. The operating principles of the nanopore-based single-molecule technique are simple: the single macromolecule capture, entry and subsequent translocations through a free-standing, voltage-biased nanopore, depend upon the physico-chemical and topological features of the analyte. The concentration, identity volume and charge of the analyte are then deduced from the analysis of the stochastic current blockade events caused by the trafficked analyte across the nanopore. Herein, we used the a-hemolysin (a-HL) nanopore and set up an experimental model providing efficient control of a-HL-peptide interactions, in the presence of a pH gradient across the nanopore. For this, we engineered a 36 amino acids long peptide containing a neutral asparagines-containing sequence, flanked by oppositely charged aminoacid patches at the N-(glutamic acids) and C-termini (arginines), whose length was set as to span a single a-HL protein. When the pH of the solution in contact to the a-HL's b-barrel opening is changed from neutral to acidic values, the electrostatic interactions between the protein's mouth and either the N-or C-terminus end of the peptide occurs, and this influences strongly the dynamics of a peptide translocating the nanopore. We further proved that during the same experiment, peptide entry into the nanopore can be set to occur with either N-or C-terminus end head on, by simply changing the sign of the transmembrane potential across the nanopore. Nanopores are emerging as a powerful and broadly applicable tool in biophysics, which allows one to study the features of charged macromolecules under confinement. A few noteworthy examples are: determining the electrophoretic mobility, effective charge and diffusion coefficients of charged molecules; exploring the folding and unfolding of peptides and proteins; analyzing biopolymers trafficking, protein transport, DNA translocation, RNA and DNA sensing and sequencing.",

Definition of the b-globin genotype is necessary for genetic counselling in the carriers, and for predicting prognosis and management options in the patients with thalassemia. DNA-based diagnosis of b-thalassemias routinely relies on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis. The aim of this study is to develop a new procedure, a DNA-based piezoelectric biosensor, for the detection of b-thalassemia IVSI-110 mutation, the most common b-thalassemia mutation in Turkey. Materials and methods: b-globin gene of genomic DNA isolated from whole blood, was amplified by PCR. Bioactive layer was constituted by binding 2-Hidroxymetacrilate Metacriloamidoscystein (HEMA-MAC) nanoploymers on the gold electrode's surface. Single oligonucleotide probes specific for IVSI-110 mutation of b-thalassemia were attached to the nanopolymer via reactive cross-linker glutaraldehyde. The measurements were executed by piezoelectric resonance frequency which is caused by binding of PCR products in media with single oligonucleotide probe on the electrode surface. The results were confirmed by the conventional molecular method as ARMS. Results: The piezoelectric resonance frequencies obtained by hybridization of the PCR products on bioactive layer were found 216 AE 12, 273 AE 6, and 321 AE 9 Hz for the samples of normal b-globin, heterozygote, and homozygote of IVSI-110 mutation, respectively. Discuss and conclusion: The developed biosensor serves as a specific result to IVSI-110 mutation. It could accurately discriminate between normal and IVSI-110 mutation samples. Because of low costs, fast results, specificity and high detection/information effectiveness as compared with conventional methods, we can be offered this techique as an alternative to conventional molecular methods. The increasing use of nano-sized materials in the last several years has compelled the scientific community to investigate the potential hazards of these unique and useful materials. One of the most widely used nanoparticles is titanium dioxide.",

            "text": "Much evidence of hazardous health effects of Nps has been reported. In this study, viability was reduced under the exposure to TiO2. Oxidative stress was elevated by the treatment with TiO2 NPs. Oxidative stress can also trigger inflammation signals. Induced by exposure to nanoparticles they may cause the translocation to the nucleus of transcription factors, which regulate proinflammatory genes, such as TNF-a, Il-1b, Il-8. Background: Endothelial cells (EC) represent one of the primary targets of the major pro-inflammatory cytokinetumor necrosis factor (TNF). Development of the new approaches for the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, including the strategies aimed to TNF neutralization, requires the usage of the adequate cellular models closely resembling the properties of the endothelium. The endothelium-derived Ea.hy926 cell line expresses several inflammation and neoangiogenesis markers in response to activation factors however their expression can differ from the patterns demonstrated by primary EC. The aim of the current study was to compare the expression of the known endothelial cellular markers including receptor of vascular endothelial growth factor-2 (VEGFR2) and a v b 3 -integrin on 2D and 3D cultures (spheroids) of Ea.hy926. Methods: The Ea.hy926 cell line was used with permission from Dr. Edgell. The cells were cultivated in the presence of TNF (25 ng/ml) or VEGF A (25 ng/ml) for 5 hours. mRNA was isolated using RNeasy kit from Qiagen and reverse-transcribed with RevertAid kit (Fermentas). RT-PCR was performed with specific primers. Expression of VEGFR2 and a v b 3 -integrin was visualized by confocal microscopy using specific monoclonal antibodies and previously developed fluorescent hybrid proteins. Results: The expression of a v b 3 -integrin and VEGFR-2 increased on the 3D culture compared to 2D according to confocal microscopy and RT-PCR. The aforecited methods revealed elevated expression of a v b 3 -integrin in the 3D culture of the Ea.hy926 cell line activated with TNF. Also increased expression of VEGFR2 in the 3D culture activated with VEGF A. Then by confocal microscopy, we analyzed our fluorescent hybrid proteins that bind a v b 3 -integrin and VEGFR2 on the surface of 2D and 3D cultures as well as antibodies with fluorescent label. Conclusions: 3D cultures of the Ea.hy926 cell line represent a promising model for the inflammation studies. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is a trimeric cytokine associated with the inflammatory response to tissue injury and found to possess a key role in Rheumatoid Arthritis pathogenesis. SPD 304 is a highly toxic recently discovered TNF inhibitor that promotes trimer dissociation and lead to the inactivation of the protein.",

More complicated approaches are expected to focus on molecular proteins as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily. BMPs associated with many cellular functions, such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. BMP-6 is significantly important for the endochondral bone formation. Inflamation can induced serum BMP levels in OA patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical findings of OA patients after the isokinetic exercise together with the serum levels of BMP-6 to sustain the molecular approaches for treatments. A total of 36 patients were included in this study. The groups are formed as follows: Group 1, OA patients before the exercise; Group 2, OA patients after the exercise; Group 3, OA patients before the isokinetic exercise; Group 4, OA patients after the isokinetic exercise Clinical and biochemical findings were evaluated before and after 3 weeks of the exercise programme. Self reported severity of pain was measured using the 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS), WOMAC scores were calculated and isokinetic knee muscle strength testing was measured using Cybex dynamometer that a standardized protocol previously described was applied in a subject-specific range of motion. Serum BMP-6 levels of all patients were studied by ELISA method. Results represented a better VAS and WOMAC scores for all exercise groups after treatment. The serum BMP-6 levels were significantly decreased in Group 2 compared to Group 1 (222.94 AE 44.66; 246.49 AE 38 .15 respectively, p < 0.01) and in Group 4 compared to Group 3 (246.74 AE 32.26; 256.23 AE 33.11 respectively, p < 0.05). There is not any statistically differences between Group 2 and Group 4 (p > 0.05).

Material and methods: Thirty newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups as NEC, NEC+ infliximab, and control. NEC was induced by enteral formula feeding, exposure to hypoxia-hyperoxia and cold stress. Pups in the NEC+ infliximab group were administered infliximab at a dose of 10 mg/kg daily by intraperitoneal route from the first day until the end of the study. All pups were sacrificed on the 5th day. Proximal colon and ileum were excised for histopathologic, immunohistochemical (TUNEL and caspase-3), and biochemical evaluation, including, total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), malonaldehyde (MDA), and myeloperoxdase (MPO) and TNF-a activities. Results: We observed better clinical sickness scores, weight gain, and survival rate in the NEC+ infliximab group compared to the NEC group (p < .05). Histopathological and apoptosis examination (TUNEL and immunohistochemical evaluation for caspase-3) revealed lower damage in the NEC+ infliximab group compared to the damage in the NEC group (p < .01). Tissue MDA, MPO, TNF-a levels, and TOS were significantly decreased in the NEC+infliximab group, whereas TAS was significantly increased in the NEC + infliximab group (p < .01). Conclusion: TNF-a blockade with infliximab efficiently reduced the intestinal injury and preserve the intestinal tissues from severe intestinal damage by its complex mechanisms on NEC.

Inflammation is a protective mechanism elicited by the host in response to infection, injury, and tissue damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intraperitoneally resveratrol administration on cardiac and vascular function in diabetic rats. Materials and methods: Diabetes was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by using injection of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg, i.p.). Rats were divided into group I: control, II: control/20 mg/kg resveratrol; III: diabetic/vehicle; and IV: diabetic/20 mg/kg resveratrol. Histopathological examinations with Masson's trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson staining were carried out to reveal cardiac and vascular tissue damage and inflammation. In addition to plasma glucose and cardiac & vascular MDA levels were measured by standard enzymatic kits while TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-18 (MBL) were analyzed by ELISA kit. Results: Final body weight decreased in all groups compared to control. In the diabetic rats, plasma glucose and vascular MDA levels were enhanced while cardiac MDA was unchanged compared to control. Vascular TNF-a, IL-1b and MBL and cardiac MBL were increased in the diabetic groups compared to control. Discussion and conclusion: It has been found that resveratrol has greatly normalized altered parameters. Taken together, resveratrol partly improved cardiac and vascular inflammation induced by diabetes. This may be due to the healing activity of resveratrol on pro-inflammatory markers.

A pituitary-derived hormone, Growth Hormone (GH) play role in elongation and differentiation of ductal epithelia into the breast terminal and buds. In this study, our aim is to determine the role of inflammation in curcumin induced apoptotic cell death via acting on JAK/STAT/SOCS pathway in wt and GH+ MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. According to MTT cell viability assay curcumin triggers cell viability loss in time and dose dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 wt and MDA-MB-231 GH+ breast cancer cell lines, respectively. Selected concentrations of curcumin as 20 lM (for MCF-7) and 25 lM (for MDA-MB-231) decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis through causing JAK2 dephoshorylation, STAT1, 3, 5 dimerization and acting on SOCS proteins expression in each cell lines. In addition, activated JAK/STAT/SOCS pathway, via forced GH expression has been suppressed following curcumin treatment for 24 hours. 20 lM curcumin-induced apoptotic cell death via dephosphorylating JAK2 at Tyr1007/1008 residues and decreased phospho-STAT1, 3 level in both breast cancer cell lines. Although curcumin dephosphorylated STAT5 in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 wt cells, no significant effect has been observed in MDA-MB-213 GH+ and MCF-7 GH+ cell lines. In consequence, although forced GH expression induced cell proliferation in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, curcumin overcame GH-mediated resistance mechanism via acting on JAK/ STAT/SOCS signaling, which is related to PPARg-induced inflammation.",

Various enviromental and genetic factors such as age, gender, family history, metabolic diseases and gene mutations are involved in the breast cancer pathogenesis. Growth hormone (GH), a pituitary derived hormone, has essential role on postnatal growth and development. It is also established that signalling route of GH and its receptor (GHR) activity is increased in different cancer types. Curcumin, a nutraceutical deriatives from rhizomes of turmeric (Curcuma longa), has potential therapeutic activity against cancer cells, including breast cancer. Curcumin inhibits proliferation of cancer cells such as prostate, colon, melanoma, cervical and breast cancer via induction of apoptosis and inflammation. STAT5, a major downstream target of GH/GHR signalling, is related to survival, proliferation and differentiation. In this study, our aim was to investigate curcumin-induced apoptotic cell death in GH overexpressed MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells via JAK-STAT/SOCS signalling and inflammatory response profile. According to MTT cell viability assay, curcumin decreased cell viability in time and dose dependent manner in wt and GH+ MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cell lines. We found that 20 lM curcumin-decreased in apoptotic cell death through inactivity at JAK2 which led to dimerization of STAT1, STAT3, STAT5. Concomitantly, curcumin affected STAT regulating SOCS proteins in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cell line. In addition, we demonstrated that 20 lM curcumin induced PPARg expression and altered inflammatory cytokine signalling cascade. Consequently, although GH overexpression led to agressive profile in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, curcumin overcame this resistance.",

The aim of our study is to reveal pro-inflammatory messengers at the cutaneous barrier (keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells), simulating the dermal impact of active principles, especially polyphenols and flavones from vegetal sources: Salvia officinalis, Asculum hippocastanum and Calendula officinalis. We focused on IL6 and IL8 cytokines as main mediators of inflammation progression, correlated in keratinocytes with IL1a as skin irritation indicator and VEGF as pro-angiogenic factor, as well as in endothelial cells with ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 adhesion molecules expression. In order to in vitro mimic the inflammatory conditions, we used targeted stimuli for each type of cells: for fibroblasts and endothelial cells -TNFa, a systemic stimulus, single or combined with PMA that activates protein kinase C and up regulates NADPH oxidase, which lead to superoxide anion production; for keratinocytescontrolled UV-A and UV-B radiation, simulating the solar damages or potential UV interactions with active principles in light exposed skin. The main analysis technique was flow cytometry: beads bases assay for soluble factors and fluorescent antibodies staining. Our results prove the different involvement of polyphenols and flavones in the anti-inflammatory mechanisms, depending of the vegetal source: active principles from Salvia officinalis induce a strong inhibition of IL6 and IL8 in TNFa stimulated keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells, reduce the ICAM-1 over-expression but have no effects on irradiated keratinocytes; biocomplexes from Asculum hippocastanum inhibit only IL8 release in stimulated fibroblasts, but protect keratinocytes from UV-A and UV-B radiation; compounds from Calendula officinalis are active on IL8 signaling in fibroblasts and counteracts only UV-B inflammation. Ischemia and/or reperfusion injury is one of the most common causes of acute renal failure. Ischemia-reperfusion associated with thrombolytic therapy, organ transplantation, coronary angioplasty, aortic cross-clamping, or cardiopulmonary bypass results in local and systemic inflammation. Within the endothelium, ischemia produces expression of proinflammatory gene products (e.g. cytokines) and bioactive agents (e.g., endothelin), while preventing other \"protective\" gene products (e.g., thrombomodulin) and bioactive agents (e.g. nitric oxide). Therefore, ischemia induces a proinflammatory state that increases tissue vulnerability to further injury on reperfusion. This experimental study was designed to investigate the protective effect of Salvia L. extracts on kidneys from I/R injury.

No significant differences were found for COX, PGE2, ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 levels between acne vulgaris patients and controls. The results of this study reveal the presence of a proinflammatory state in acne vulgaris as shown by significantly increased serum sPLA2 activity. Increased LPL activity in serum of acne vulgaris can be protective in patients through its anti-dyslipidemic actions. To our best knowledge, this is the first study investigating sPLA2, LPL, ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 levels in acne vulgaris. Future studies are aimed to understand the regulation of sPLA2 and LPL expression in acne vulgaris patients.

Sen, H. M. Okuyan Mustafa Kemal University, Hatay, Turkey Acne vulgaris is a skin disease that characterized by comedones, papules, pustules, nodules and cysts at face, back and body skin. Isotretinoin is one of the treatment agents in acne vulgaris. About 4 weeks after drug treatment, the amount of sebum which is produced by sebaceous gland reduces keratinization disorder and the number of Propionibacterium acnes normalizes. However, isotretinoin is known that has a wide range of side effects. In recent studies, isotretinoin treatment has been shown to increase the oxidative stress. 8-hydroxy-2 0 -deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an important indicator of oxidative DNA damage, hydroxyl ion is bound at the 8th carbon of guanine. This structure is repaired through a base excision repair mechanism and the human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) plays a key role in this processes. In this study we aimed to evaluate the DNA damage and it's repair in acne vulgaris before and after 6 months of isotretinoin treatment by measuring 8-OHdG and hOGG1 levels.",

The pineal gland is a circumventricular organ which serves as a major neuroendocrine gland in the brain. Its primary function is the production of melatonin which is controlled by signals from the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Melatonin codes the length of the night and it is well recognized for its anti-inflammatory effects. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the essential component in the outer surface membrane of gram-negative bacteria and act as a strong stimulator of natural and innate immunity in all eukaryotic species. Furthermore, LPS reduces melatonin synthesis and induces the expression of the serine protease inhibitor 3 (SPI-3) in the STAT3-mediated manner in pinealocytes. However, the precise function of STAT3 in the cell signaling in the pineal gland is not yet known.",

Further studies are needed on a larger population in order to confirm these results. The water extract of Capparis ovata (COWE) has been shown to be used as an alternative medicine for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). COWE was further fractionated and studied for additional anti-neuroinflammatory effects in SH-SY5Y cells. For this purpose, the dichloromethane sub-fraction of the COWE extract was tested for its anti-inflammatory effects on selected anti-inflammatory genes believed to be important in MS pathophysiology using SH-SY5Y cells. Cell viability was assessed using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the media conditioned by the crystal violet cell staining. In these cells, levels of the tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa), nuclear factor kappa-lightchain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-jB1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), C-X-C motif chemokine 9 and 10 (CXCL9, CXCL10), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), chemokine (C-C) motif 5 (CCL5) and tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11) were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR assay (qRT-PCR). We have found out that the dichloromethane sub-fraction of COWE effectively inhibited the expression of all of the genes given above in SH-SY5Y cells. Thus, phytochemicals present in the dichloromethane sub-fraction of the COWE extract could be beneficial in preventing/treating neurodegenerative diseases in which neuroinflammation is part of the pathophysiology.

Rather than worldwide use of its essential oil in aromatherapy, specifically the aqeous portion as decoction has been traditionally used in Anatolia against the components of metabolic syndrome, all of which share a state of chronic inflammation as an underlying cause. The anti-inflammatory constiutents of L. stoechas were isolated using a bioassay guided fractionation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inflammed RAW 264.7 macrophages. Materials and methods: An aqeous extract was partitioned into ethyl acetate (EAE) and n-butanol fractions. The EAE, determined as bioactive extract was seperated into 12 subfractions by column chromatography. E6 was identified as active subfraction subjected to sephadex column to get pure compounds which were then applied to NMR, IR, and UV analyses for structure determination. In RAW 264.7 cells, the effects of extracts/fractions/subfractions/compounds on LPS induced NO production was determined by using Griess method. The potential inhibitory effects of each compound on LPS induced iNOS expression were determined by qPCR and Western blot. Results: p-coumaric acid, apigenin and luteoline were found in the E6, and the first two compounds appeared to be primarily responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity. Apigenin and luteoline at 50 lM decreased NO production 66 and 80%-IC 50: 56 and 26 lM-by inhibiting iNOS gene expression 84 and 88% as well as protein expression 94 and 99%, respectively (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This is the first time that luteoline and apigenin have been found in EAE of L. stoechas, and the anti-inflammatory properties of the EAE can be attributed, at least in part, to the presence of these two compounds. We are on the way to gain further insight for the action mechanism of these two active principles as anti-inflammatory agent.",

IL-6 (Interleukin 6) is one of the pro-inflamatory cytokines and its expression increases during the infection to activate the JAK/ STAT pathway. JAK/STAT pathway is regulated by Hamp (hepcidin antimicrobial peptide). Our previous study, we reported that Hamp gene expression was decreased in liver-specific Tip60 conditional knockout mice, so we thought that TIP60 may have a direct or indirect role on inflammation mechanism. TIP60 (Tat interacting protein, 60 kDa) is a member of the MYST enzyme family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and plays an important role in multiple function including cellular signaling, DNA repair, cell cycle and apoptosis. In this study, the quantitative gene and protein expression of IL-6 were investigated by using TaqMan real time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis in control group, LPSinduced inflammation group and liver-specific Tip60 conditional knockout group mouse liver. According to our preliminary results, the gene and protein expression of IL-6 was increased in LPS-induced inflammation group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001) and liver-specific Tip60 conditional knockout group mouse liver (p < 0.05, p < 0.01).",

The secondary structure of and three-dimensional of the protein were analyzed by Psipred and FFAS server. NetCGlyc 1.0 and NetPhos 2.0 program were used for post-translocation modifications. The web apoptosis database was also used for the lists of domains, proteins containing these domains and their associated homologs. Results and conclusion: Humans TNF ligands have 17 genes encoding proteins that contain a conserved carboxy-terminal domain. This family of proteins is highly conserved between humans and mice. Humans contain 29 genes encoding TNFfamily receptors. Sequence data from the NCBI databases demonstrated the presence of 24 mouse TNF-family receptors with orthologs in humans and one additional receptor found only in mice. The differences and similarities in the TNFs genes in humans and mice will provide information for understanding the utility and limitations of the mouse models of disease and comparing of immunology outcomes.",

Especially three elements, the heat shock elements, were in the focus of this work. In first place parts of the promoter were multimerized and combined with different reporters, like luciferase, by cloning. Also mutations in the natural promoter were designed by cloning. The focus now is on the heat shock elements, where HSF1 can bind as a trimer. The idea is that these different elements have various effects on different stressors like heat, chemicals (geldanamycine as HSP90 inhibitor, MG132 as proteasome inhibitor) or heavy metals (cadmium, arsenic, zinc) . This was tested on cells transiently transfected with those promoter variants. For promising variants stable cell lines were created. In these stable cell lines further experiments on mRNA level can be conducted. In the last months experiments with the CRISPR/Cas9 system were started. Furthermore, experiments on transcriptional (qPCR) and translational (dual-luciferase assay) levels were done as well. In the end we hope to get a clear picture on the regulation of the HSPA1A promoter by different stress factors. Invasive cancer cells form membrane protrusions, invadopodia, that facilitate cell invasion and metastasis. Key players invadopodia include the adaptor proteins TKS4 and TKS5, the actin regulators cortactin, WIP and N-WASP, the kinase Src and others. In spite that in the last two decades significant advances in our knowledge of the structure and development of invadopodia have been made, detailed mechanisms they are functioning is not yet available. We have identified a series of new TKS4 binding partners including adaptor proteins ITSN1, ITSN2, CRK and GRB2, kinase SRC, AMPH1, BIN1, PLCg1 and also another member of the TKS family -TKS5. It may indicate the possible role of TKS4 in transport and sorting of cell vesicles. Current data are supported by interaction with the proteins of AMPH1 and BIN1, as their main functions are membrane trafficking and remodeling. Adaptor proteins CRK, GRB2 and ITSNs are important for the actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, endocytosis and signal transduction. Moreover, we have identified and characterized new TKS4 isoform -TKS4-beta. We suggested that an active state of TKS4 is regulated via intramolecular interactions between its proline-rich motifs and own SH3-domains. We have shown the interaction between ITSNs and other prominent component of invadopodia WIP. Data from immunofluorescent analysis revealed co-localization of ITSN1 and WIP at the sites of invadopodia formation and in clathrin-coated pits. We have also demonstrated that the key protein ITSN1 and WIP and N-WASP can form a complex in cells. Together, these findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of invadopodia formation and identify ITSNs as scaffold proteins involved in this process. We have shown the interaction between ITSNs and other verprolin family members CR16 and WIRE which play an important role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.",

This data opens possibilities for targeted changes in the methabolic pathway in order to obtain phenazine compound with required biological activity. Insulators are genomic elements which block enhancer-promoter interaction and prevent spreading of heterochromatin. CP190 protein is an integral component of most known Drosophila insulators, it interacts directly with CTCF and Pita DNA-binding insulator proteins using dimeric BTB-domain, but function of CP190 within insulators still remains to be elucidated. Recently we described an interaction between CP190 BTB-domain and Cterminal domain of CTCF insulator DNA-binding protein, subsequent deletion analysis allowed us to isolate 50aa fragment within CTCF C-terminal domain sufficient for interaction with CP190 BTB, but deletions of flanking regions also lead to the loss of interaction with CP190 in vivo. At the same time crosslinking experiments suggest that a dimer of BTB interacts with one molecule of CTCF, presuming that it could recognize two peptide fragments within CTCF C-terminal domain. We solved crystal structure of BTB-domain from CP190 insulator protein at 1. 3 A resolution. Overall structure is similar to other BTB-domains. CP190 BTB-domain has peptide-binding groove similar to that previously found in Bcl6 BTB domain. Inspection of BTB-domain surface revealed several possible binding sites for polypeptide fragments from CTCF protein. Based on these observations a set of point mutations within peptide-binding groove of BTB-domain has been designed and we tested CTCF-interaction abilities of these mutants using GST pull-down assay and yeast two-hybrid assay. The most significant impact was found with alanine-substitutions of hydrophobic residues whereas substitutions of hydrophilic amino acids were less effective. Therefore our results support that CP190 BTB-domain recognizes CTCF protein using peptide-binding groove. This study was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (project \u211614-24-00166).

The objective of our work was to study the chemical compositions of raw meat samples obtained from domestic (group I -purebred Romanov sheep) and hybrid sheep (group II -F 3 hybrids of Romanov sheep with 12.5% of argali blood). The significant changes in fatty acid composition of the lipid fraction from the fat and muscle tissue of the hybrid sheep as compared to the control were found. The content of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in the fat samples of the hybrid animals was by 12.16% lower (55.12 AE 2.30%, p < 0.01), but polyunsaturated (PUFAs) or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) contents were by 0.64% and 9.43% higher (10.10 AE 0.43 and 28.78 AE 1.77 (p < 0.01), respectively) as compared to purebred Romanov sheep. The most pronounced changes were found for palmitic acid (decreased from 27.70% to 14.24%) and for oleic, linoleic, arachidonic acids (increased from 20.37%, 5.58%, 0.35% to 29.98%, 6.10%, 0.70%, respectively). The last two acids together with the linolenic acids belong to the so-called essential acids and very important for the animal metabolism. A similar trend was observed on the composition of the lipid fraction of muscle tissue. SFAs, PUFAs and MUFAs content in muscle tissue of hybrid sheep was 53.38 AE 0.34, 9.39 AE 1.00 and 34.16 AE 0.39%, that was 11.17% lower (p < 0.001), and 4.13% and 4.67% higher (p < 0.01) compared to purebred Romanov sheep. These results emphasized the difference of the PUFAs/SFAs ratios in fat and muscle tissues, respectively) and characterized the biological value of the lipid fraction of fat and muscle tissue. The obtained data gave evidence of the positive changes in the fatty acid compositions of the lipid fractions for the hybrid animals as compared to the purebred sheep.

Postnatal growth is under control of pituitary derived hormone, growth hormone (GH) that triggers bone, fat tissue growth and development via acting on protein, carbohydrate and fat metabolism. GH functions on postnatal development by JAK2/STAT5 signaling following GH:GH receptor (GHR) dimerization. Isolated Growth Hormone Deficiency (IGHD) is a medical condition of insufficient production of growth hormone (GH) that is caused by mutations on GH-N gene in different ethnic origin children. Various mutations within GH has been determined in different populations so far, and Glutamic acid to Glycine (E33G), Asparagine to Aspartic acid (N47D), Threonine to Alanin (T-24A) missense mutations, Alanine to Serine (A13S) substitution, Tryptophan to stop codon (W-7X), GAAA insertion in intron 1 of GH-N gene and both intron 1 (+83C) and deletion of 166. amino acid of GH protein phenylalanine (F166Del) mutations were detected in Turkish IGHD children.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cardiovascular emergency and affects a large number of patients. Acute PE-induced oxidative stress can lead to the accumulation of specific nitroproteins that may play a role in disease progression. The impact of nitration of a single tyrosine residue often has broad implications on the activity of biologically critical proteins, which has become increasingly related to pathological conditions. In this study, we used a proteomic approach to analyze nitrated serum proteins in patients diagnosed with acute PE and healthy controls. Nitrotyrosine (NO2Tyr)-containing proteins were immunoprecipitated from serum with a NO2Tyr affinity sorbent. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting with mouse monoclonal anti-NO2Tyr antibody. Among the numerous immunoreactive bands observed in disease patients, the 138 kDa protein band was in-gel digested and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). Mass fingerprint data sets obtained from the peptide fragment ions matched human collagen alpha-1 (III) chain (CO3A1_HU-MAN) with Mascot algorithm analysis giving a score of 65 (p < 0.05). Collagen alpha-1(III) chain is a fibrillar collagen that is found in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung, and the vascular system. Altered metabolism of collagen and its excessive deposition in the matrix of the connective tissue is a hallmark of chronic interstitial lung diseases. Collagen can be measured in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with numerous chronic interstitial lung diseases. Given these considerations, future studies are aimed understand the relevance of NO2Tyr modifications in CO3A1 relating to changes in protein structure and function.

Further studies in larger cohorts are needed in order to explore these possible interactions and confirm our findings. Smad-Interacting Protein 1 (SIP1), also known as ZEB2 is a member of ZEB family transcription factors and was shown to regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cell cycle, cellular senescence and cancer stemness. Bipartite zing finger motifs at amino and carboxyl termini of the SIP1 mediate its binding to Ebox sequences in the genome. However, there are only limited data about SIP1 target genes. By using a home-made anti-SIP1 monoclonal antibody, clone 6E5, we conducted ChIP-seq in three hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, namely SNU398, PLC/PRF/5 and SK-HEP-1 and found Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-Like Orphan Receptor 1 (ROR1) as one of the targets. SIP1 DNAbinding consensus motif CACCTG was found at +1 kb, +30 kb and +50 kb from ROR1 transcription start site. ChIP experiments validated SIP1 binding to all consensus motifs in the ROR1 gene region. Interestingly, the strongest enrichment was at +50 kb suggesting that long-range interactions play an important role in the regulation of ROR1 by SIP1. SIP1 knockdown by shRNA in high-SIP1 expressing SNU398 cells resulted in the repression of ROR1 expression. ROR1 is expressed in embryogenesis and fetal life, and is absent within most of adult normal tissues. However, overexpression of ROR1 was observed in many human cancers, from hematological malignancies to solid epithelial tumors. ROR1-positive cancer cells have enhanced proliferation, invasion and metastasis capacities, show resistance to apoptotic stimuli and display cancer stem cell characteristics. Therefore, SIP1 and ROR1 act in similar pathophysiological processes. Our finding that ROR1 is regulated by SIP1 at least in hepatocellular carcinoma cells adds another level of complexity to the molecular mechanisms of proliferation, invasion and stemness of cancer cells. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary liver cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths. SMAD interacting protein 1 (SIP1), a member of the ZEB family of EMT inducers, is involved in cellular proliferation, senescence, invasion and metastasis in human tumors. However, genes regulated by SIP1 in HCC are yet to be identified. We conducted a ChIP-Seq study in high-SIP1 expressing HCC cell line SNU398 by using a home-made anti-SIP1 antibody, clone 6E5. Among 509 annotated genes, we selected SIX1 for further studies because of its increased expression in multiple cancers and its association with poor prognosis. SIP1 DNA-binding motif CACCTG was found at -3 kb from transcription start site of SIX1 gene. ChIP qPCR experiment validated SIP1 binding to this region with 19,7 fold enrichment. Compared to healthy liver, SIX1 transcripts were upregulated in 8 of 9 HCC cell lines included in this study. Knockdown of SIP1 by shRNA in SNU398 cells caused upregulation of SIX1. Immunohistochemistry studies in HCC tissue arrays showed increased expression of SIX1 in tumors and inverse association with SIP1 expression in a tumor grade dependent manner. Therefore, our results strongly suggest an inverse correlation of SIP1 and SIX1 in HCC Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover are under genetic control and variations in the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) are related to BMD.

Aksoy 1 1 C \u00df ukurova University, Adana, 2 Nigde University, Nigde, 3 Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey Introduction: Hemoglobinopathies are most commonly seen hereditary blood diseases worldwide. Our aim was to compare the HbA1c values measured on cation-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in beta thalassemia cases. Materials and methods: We collected 3 ml of whole blood K 3 EDTA containing tubes from forty-nine cases. ARMS, RFLP and DNA sequence analysis methodologies were carried out for determination of beta thalassemia mutations. Hb A1c values were measured using the Agilent 1100 HPLC system. Results: Forty-nine diabetic and non-diabetic patients were diagnosed with beta thalassemias: twenty-one IVS1-110/IVS1-110, one IVS1-1/IVS1-1, one IVS1-5/IVS1-5, two IVS1-6/IVS1-6, two IVS2-1/IVS2-1, one Fsc5/Fsc5, one Fsc44/Fsc44, two -30/-30, two Cd8/Cd8, one Cd36-37/Cd36-37, one Cd8-9/Cd8-9, two Cd82/Cd83-G/ Cd82/Cd83-G, two IVS1-110/ IVS1-6, one IVS1-110/ IVS2-1, one IVS1-110/Fsc44, one IVS1-110/Cd39, one IVS1-110/Cd8, one IVS1-110/Cd8-9, one IVS1-110/IVS1-5, one IVS1-6/ IVS2-1, one IVS1-6/ IVS1-25, one IVS2-745/Cd8 and one Fsc5/Cd37. Cases were classified as diabetic (6), prediabetic (11) and non-diabetic (32) Introduction: Members of Aurora kinase family Aurora A, B and C are conservative kinases of cell cycle which are encoded by genes AURA, AURB and AURC respectively. Overexpression of AURA and AURB was found in human cancers, especially in prostate cancer. Moreover, there is the evidence that AURB interacts with one of the major oncogenic kinases -BRAF. Little is known about implication of AURC in cancer, but it was demonstrated, that it can overlap AURB function and shares its location. We studied expression of genes of these kinases in urine of prostate cancer patients aiming to evaluate their involvement in this disease and their potential as tumor markers. Materials and methods: 22 urine samples from patients with prostate cancer were gathered after prostate massage before surgical invasion. We used urine samples from 6 healthy men as control. We obtained cells from each urine sample by centrifugation and isolated RNA using standard approach with phenol and guanidine thiocyanate. cDNA was synthesized and taken to qPCR reactions. Data was statistically analysed. Results: Expression of all studied genes was detected in urine of patients with prostate cancer and of healthy men. Expression of AURB and AURC in cancer samples each was higher than expression of AURA. The cumulative expression AURB and AURC was higher than expression of AURA in 13 samples from 22. We observed positive correlation between expression of AURC and BRAF (rs = 0.548, p = 0.01). Discussion and conclusion: Previous investigation showed, that for normal prostate tissue 90% of Aurora family expression was presented by AURA. We suppose that presence of AURB and AURC cumulative overexpression means presence of cell cycle deviations in prostate tissue of these patients and might be further studied as prognostic marker. In this study we first showed the correlation between AURC and other carcinogenic kinase BRAF expression, which opens the perspective for investigation of role of AURC in carcinogenesis. Bacillus marmarensis sp. nov. is an extreme obligate alkaliphile isolated from mushroom compost near Marmara Region of Turkey. It can survive at extreme pH values up to 12.5. Based on its genome sequence, metabolic pathways for 7 proteases, 6 amylases, 2 cellulases, 1 lipase, n-butanol and a biodegradable plastic poly-b-hydroxybutyrate were annotated. In addition to being a potential extracellular hydrolase producer, its ability to survive in the high pH range of 8.0 to12.5 makes it an attractive microorganism for different industrial applications. In the current study, the adaptation strategy of B. marmarensis sp. nov. to alkaline conditions was investigated using proteomic tools. The organism was grown at two different pH values, 10.0 and pH 12.0. For extraction of whole cell proteins, cells were disrupted with MP Bio Fast Prep device. Protein extracts were treated with protease inhibitors and a nuclease mix. Salts were removed using a cleanup kit. Obtained proteins were separated based of their isoelectric points in the first dimension and then based on their molecular weights in the second dimension. Proteins maps of cells grown at these two extreme pH values showed significant differences in protein expression for alkaline adaptation.

Cimen Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive malignant tumor composed of astrocytes in brain tissue. GBM cells utilize glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation to support rapid growth rate which is called Warburg effect. Dichloroacetate (DCA) is an antiglycolytic agent that inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activity and induces apoptosis via normalizing the mitochondrial activity.

Background: Development of atrial fibrillation (AF) during the course of chronic primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is common and represents complex molecular mechanisms. However, the gene expression profile of human atrial fibrillation (AF) in the setting of chronic primary MR remains uncharacterized. In the current study, we aimed to compare the gene expression profiles of patients with severe degenerative MR in sinus rhythm (SR) and AF. Methods: Left and right atrial tissue samples were obtained from patients with chronic primary severe MR in permanent AF (n = 30) and sinus rhythm (n = 30). We performed a novel micro-dissection technique for thin sections of atrial tissue samples and immediately fresh froze intra-operatively. Transcriptomes of left and right atrial appendages of degenerative mitral regurgitation patients with SR versus AF were compared by microarray analysis on Affymetrix HGU-133 Plus 2 platform. Bioinformatics, data mining and pathway analyses were conducted on Partek GS and WebGestalt. Genome-wide gene expression profiles were compared between AF and SR groups among 54.675 transcripts representing 38.500 well-characterized human genes. Differentially regulated genes were evaluated according to fold change (FC \u2265 1.5) with a p-value \u22640.05. Results: Most remarkable pathways altered in AF atrial tissues compared to SR group, were extracellular matrix-receptor interaction; MAPK, adipocytokine, and calcium signaling; apoptosis and cardiac muscle contraction pathways. Conclusions: This is the first human study of comparative transcriptomics in left and right atrial tissues of patients with AF versus SR associated with severe degenerative MR. The main findings of this multidisciplinary translational research provide novel candidate targets for the treatment and prevention of AF. In order to acquire iron under iron-limiting growth conditions, bacteria employ specific mechanisms such as production and secretion of siderophores. Siderophores are low molecular metalchelating compounds that contribute not only to iron scavenging, but also participate in other important processes including oxidative stress response and cell signaling.

In response to diverse environmental cues bacteria form complex structured communities called biofilms. The metabolic pathways activated by these cues are remarkably different depending on the species studied. However, they all lead to the formation of an extracellular matrix that holds the cells together. Non-pathogenic gram-positive spore-forming soil B. subtilis strain is recognized as a model system for the study of biofilms. To discover the pathways regulating biofilm formation in B. subtilis, we studied the natural isolate of B. subtilis strain 168, and constructed the recombinant strains with knocked out genes of following regulatory proteins: AbrB (global transcriptional regulator), DegU (two-component response regulator of signal transduction system DegS-DegU), CcpA (regulator of carbon catabolism) and SpoOA (regulator of sporulation). In the minimal medium broth B. subtilis 168 wild-type strain forms biofilm with its maximum on 48th hour of culture growth. pH-Optimum for biofilms formation by the wild-type strain is in the range of 7.4-8.0. The temperature optimum is in the range from 22\u00b0C to 45\u00b0C. This corresponds to the natural conditions of the B. subtilis habitat in rhizosphere. The level of biofilm formation by regulatory mutant strains with deleted abrB, degU, ccpA, spoOA genes is on average 40% lower than by the wild-type strain. This indicates that global regulatory system controlls biofilm formation process. Statistically significant differences in the levels of biofilm formation between regulatory mutants haven't been identified. pH and temperature optima of mutant strains are the same as for the wildtype strain -7,4-8 and 22\u00b0C -45\u00b0C respectively.

The Yarrowia lipolytica species (Yl) is nonconventional yeast widely used for recombinant protein expression due to its system of post-translation protein modification, which is the most similar to that of higher eukaryotes. Yl appears the promising producer of recombinant proteins with much more complicated molecules compared to those of prokaryotic producers. However, an important feature for a producer strain of recombinant proteins is the genes, the expression of which undertakes under controlled conditions, and consequently, search of new effective inducible promoters in the Yl genome is of great interest. Proteome analysis of the Yl cells grown at different pH values (4.0, 5.5, 9.0) showed that under alkaline conditions the amount of mitochondrial porine VDAC (voltage dependent anion channel), one of the most abundant protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane, increased significantly. VDAC is supposed to let reactive oxygen species out of mitochondria protecting the cell against oxidative stress. Therefore, the POR1 gene expression, encoding VDAC should increase in the stress conditions. The promoter of the POR1 gene was used to construct some new expression systems based on Yl W29. A new genetic construct bearing a reporter bgalactosidase gene under control of the POR1 promoter. b-galactosidase activity was assayed in the cells grown in various pH conditions and exposed to exogenous oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, menadione, and methyl viologen. It was shown, that in H 2 O 2 and methyl viologen treated cells b-galactosidase activity increased 1.5-2.0 -fold reaching its maximum in the cells, grown at pH of 9.0. Thus, we demonstrated high inducibility of the POR1 promoter, which is essential for effective action of the expression system based on it and potency of application for transformed lines of producers.

P-08.02.5-003 Functional polymorphisms of EPHX2 in a Turkish population H. Pinarbasi, I. Sari Cumhuriyet University, Sivas, Turkey Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH; EC 3.3.3.2) is encoded by EPHX2 and catalyses the degradation of endogenous fatty acid epoxides generated by CYP450 epoxygenases. These fatty acid epoxides such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) have been shown to posses vasodilator, anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet, anti-hypertensive, anti-apoptotic, anti-thrombotic and natriuretic effects. It has been reported that EET levels are associated with hypertension, stroke and cardiovascular diseases. Individual differences in the EPHX2 gene that affect the sEH activity may alter the circulating levels of EETs. K55R and R287Q polymorphisms have been known to cause increased and decreased sEH activity, respectively. Therefore we aimed to determine the genotype frequencies of these two polymorphisms in a Turkish population. K55R and R287Q polymorphisms were determined by the real time PCR using double-dye hydrolysis probes or PCR-RFLP method. The observed genotype frequencies for K55R polymorphism were 80.8% wild type (AA) and 19.2% polymorphic genotype (AG+GG) and for R287Q polymorphism 81.4% wild type and 18.6% polymorphic genotype (GA+AA). The genotype distributions for both polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Pregnancy is one of manifestations for thrombophilia factors, which in its turn leads to various complications of its course. One of the markers of hereditary thrombophilia is mutations in the folate cycle MTR, MTRR and MTHFR genes. Insufficient intake of folate during pregnancy disrupts the functioning of the genome, leading to miscarriage, violation of embryogenesis and various fetal malformations. However, results of studies on the role of hereditary thrombophilia in the occurrence of complications during pregnancy are rather contradictory.",

PES prevalence is 11.3% above the age 40 in Turkey. Since PES is characterized by excessive synthesis of elastic microfibrillar components throughout the body, growth factors can have important roles in the pathophysiology of PES. Human Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) is a protein expressed in a variety of tissues, including the anterior chamber of the eye. CTGF coding gene has several genetic polymorphisms. rs6918698 G/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is found at position \u00c0945, in promoter region. The presence of a C allele for rs6918698 is critical for transcriptional suppression of the CTGF gene which would reduce CTGF production. Aim of this study was to investigate if there is any association between PES and rs6918698 polymorphism of the CTGF gene.",

First, we identified BCR/TCR rearrangements specific for the leukemic clones in initial bone marrow samples of 10 ALL patients. For this, we used Sanger sequencing of the products of 19 multiplex PCR, performed with BCR/TCR specific primers combined according to the optimal frequency distribution of V/J-genes in healthy donors. Second, we analyzed concentration of malignant clone rearrangements, identified at the first step, in DNA samples obtained from bone marrow after 36 days of treatment. For this purpose, we performed NGS of 10 libraries for each identified leukemic rearrangement. Four libraries were amplicons of BCR or TCR gene rearrangements generated using characteristic V and J segment specific primer combination. Six additional libraries were amplicons of the same primer combination from the same DNA sample which contained initial leukemic DNA spike-in (in concentrations corresponding to 1 per 100, 1000 and 10,000 cells) for a calibration curve generation. Using this approach, we analyzed 7 ALL clone specific rearrangements for three patients and calculated concentration of the leukemic clones by using the calibration curve. For one patient we didn't find any leukemic cells and for two patients we found 1 leukemic cell per 100,000 analyzed cells.

Based on that we aim to investigate the potential anti-diabetic effects of circilineol and circiliol isolated from Teucrium alyssifolium extract, using in vitro cell culture models. For this purpose, the anti-diabetic actions were investigated by applying model Caco2 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) cell line. We determined the level of AG (alpha-glucosidase), SGLT1 (sodium-glucose transporter-1) and GLUT1-5 and glucose transport. Neither AG activity nor SGLT1 activity was increased with either circiliol or circilineol treatment in CaCo2 cells compared to positive control.

Ozcelik Y\u20ac uz\u20ac unc\u20ac u Yil University, Van, Turkey Introduction: Physical activity elevates creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) levels which have been considered to be an indirect marker of skeletal and cardiac muscles damage. Purpose: Impact of physical activity performed on different times of day on serum levels of CK and CK-MB were investigated in trained and untrained male subjects. Materials and methods: Trained (n = 10, 18.3 AE 0.1 yr, 61.4 AE 2.3 kg) and untrained (n = 10, 18.6 AE 0.1 yr, 63.2 AE 2.4 kg) subjects performed three soccer matches (60 min) in field (30 m versus 50 m) in morning (M), afternoon (A) and at night (N) on separate days. The study protocol was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Venous blood samples were taken at onset and at end of match. Serum CK and CK-MB levels are measured using autoanalyser. Data are expressed as mean AE S.E., compared by Wilcoxon-signed rank and Mann-Whitney U-tests. p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Results: CK and CK-MB levels increased in three matches in both groups (p < 0.05). Importantly, there were significant increases in CK-MB levels in A and N exercises compared to M exercise (p < 0.05) in trained (10.6 AE 1.6 U/l versus 14.2 AE 1.9 U/l, 35% (M) 9.7 AE 1.3 U/l versus 18 AE 2.6 U/l, 66% (A) 9.5 AE 1.1 U/l versus 16.3 AE 2.0 U/l, 103% (N) and also untrained groups (8.6 AE 0.8 U/l versus 11.5 AE 0.8 U/l, 42% (M), 7.3 AE 0.5 U/l versus 11.9 AE 0.9 U/l, 85% (A) 7.9 AE 0.9 U/l versus 13.8 AE 0.9 U/l, 76% (N). Discussion: Increased metabolic stress or muscle damage during physical exercise elevate serum CK and CK-MB levels. However, higher percentage of increase in CK-MB levels in A and N exercise may reflects additional increases in cardiac muscle stress despite the similar skeletal muscle stress as indicated by CK levels. Conclusion: Considering the observation of higher percentage increase in CK-MB levels in untrained and also trained subjects, the caution should be taken while performing an exercise in A and N time especially in subjects who has cardiac weakness.

Among all the BA under investigation, BKM-570 appeared to be the most effective, with IC50 values of 4 lM and 3.3 lM in rat glioma C6 and human glioblastoma U251 cell lines, respectively. BKM-570 suppressed ERK1/2 and AKT1 phosphorylation in U251 cells. Temozolomide (TMZ), the firstline anti-gliomic drug used in clinics, has only a temporary positive effect and severe side effects in GB patients. We showed that the combination of BKM-570 and TMZ led to significant potentiation of TMZ cytotoxicity at sub-therapeutic concentrations. Recombinant proteins with cytotoxic properties are promising agents for complex therapeutic applications. We revealed that the glioma-associated protein CHI3L2 inhibited the viability of U251 cells more effectively than TMZ. Furthermore, the combination of CHI3L2 and BKM-570 resulted in an additive cytotoxic effect. CHI3L2-mediated decrease of cell viability was associated with a G1/S transition arrest. CHI3L2 provoked the dramatic reduction of pRB phosphorylation and a significant decrease of cyclin D1 expression, as well as a substantial increase in p53 level. In addition to the accumulation of p53, we observed the upregulation of CDK inhibitor p21. Therefore, G1/S arrest in CHI3L2-treated cells could be realized via activation of pRB, downregulation of cyclin D, and activation of p53.

P-08.02.5-025 Inhibition of the recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase with paraoxon and coumarin analog of soman Organophosphorus compounds (OP) represent a class of extremely toxic chemicals that are used as warfare agents. Uncontrolled utilization of OP is highly dangerous due to their high potential to be efficient poisons in terrorist attacks. Current therapy of OP poisoning include intravenous administration of atropine and acetylcholine reactivators however, it does not completely eliminate brain damage effects. Alternative experimental therapy against OP poisoning is utilization of bioscavengers that irreversibly react with OP and rapidly inactivate them. Recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase (rhBChE) is one of the most promising candidates as bioscavenger due to its pharmacokinetic characteristics and broad spectrum of OP neutralizing activity. Here we investigated in vitro inhibition of rhBChE with two model OPpesticide paraoxon (POX) and coumarin analog of soman (GD C ). Both OP lead to rapid and irreversible inactivation of rhBChE that was monitored using Ellman assay and fluorescence measurements. Bimolecular inhibition rate constants dramatically differ between POX and GD C that could be explained by steric hindrance in soman analog. The next steps forward creation of catalytic bioscavengers based on rhBChE should be done based on mechanisms of OP-rhBChE interactions. This work was performed in frame of grant RFME-FI60414X0069.

To increase the efficacy and safety of therapeutic B-lymphocyte depletion in lymphomas and leukemia's it would be preferable to induce the death of pathological B cells without affecting normal B cells to prevent side effects. Similar to other types of cancer, NHLs arise by a multistep accumulation of genetic aberrations that induce a selective growth advantage of the malignant clone.

For this purpose we designed new lentiviral peptide library screening technique based on fluorescent reporter cells system. Herein 7aa peptide library was used for screening of NHL's malignant receptor agonist. Patients' lymph nodes biopsy samples mRNA was used as a source of malignant BCR nucleotide sequence. Variable domain of the lymphoma BCR was used for chimeric receptor generation, where BCR VH/VL part responsible for agonist recognition and bottom part of receptor was retranslate signal to the reporter gene. In this embodiment of the method, very large numbers of candidate 7aa peptides expressing lentivirus and eukaryotic reporter cells are packaged together in a format where each is capable of replication, thereby forging a direct link between genotype and phenotype. After four rounds of screening we discover peptides specifically interacted with malignant BCR's. Selected peptide ligands were fused with chimeric antigen receptor for expression on T-cells. Modified Tcells selectively eliminate NHL's malignant cells ex vivo. This work was supported by grant RFMEFI60714X0061. Introduction: Pesticides are used to prevent damage of unwanted insects, rodents, plant, moss and other pests. Excessive use of pesticides may cause adverse effects in animals and humans. Chlorpyrifosethylene (CPE) is an organophosphate pesticide, used in many agricultural products such as figs, cherries, olives worldwide; caused acute poisoning and chronically oxidative stress. Rosadamascena Mill (Rosaceae) is a rose, used for production of rosewater (RW) and rose oil worldwide. Rosaceae products are consumed in food and cosmetic industries. Materials and methods: In this study, we investigated that CPE and RW effects on kidney tissues of rats. This study was included 32 adult male rats, divided into 4 groups. Each group included 8 rats. I.group: control (regular feed), II.group: CPE (0.3 mg/kg/day), III.group: RW (100 mg/kg/day) and IV.group: CPE (0.3 mg/kg/day) + RW (100 mg/kg/day). Following 15 days, kidneys were taken after sacrificed. Analyzes were performed that malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) as oxidant; superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR) as antioxidant parameters. Results: As compared with control, MDA and NO levels in CPE were a significant increase was determined (p Conclusion: CPE is shown that significant increase on oxidant parameters, but significant decrease on antioxidant parameters. RW occurs opposite situation. Similarly results of CPE, RW + CPE increased oxidant parameters, but decreased antioxidant parameters. These changes are lower than only CPE. These results showed that positive effects both RW and RW + CPE increasing on antioxidant parameters, also decreasing on oxidant parameters. We provide the comparative analysis of the reduced glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), a-tocopherol levels, an intracellular labile Zn 2+ pool and esterase activity of red blood cells of patients with diagnosed components of the metabolic syndrome (MS)arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus type II (Ah + DM + ). As the comparison groups were selected patients with one diagnosed component of MSarterial hypertension (Ah + DM \u00c0 ) or without any diagnosed component of MS (Ah -DM -). Patients of all investigated groups were at the hospital treatment with a diagnosis coronary heart disease (CHD) II degree.",

This fact confirms our assumption concerning the important role of zinc homeostasis in the etiopathogenesis of diabetes mellitus type II. A direct relationship between the intracellular Zn 2+ level modification and erythrocytes esterase activity of patients with CHD II degree was observed. Moreover, in Ah + DM + group of patients this relation was more marked. The unidirectional alteration in the erythrocytes redox state (GSH and a-tocopherol levels reduction, ROS formation activation) was revealed at the whole of investigated CHD patients groups (Ah + DM + , Ah + DM \u00c0 , Ah \u00c0 DM \u00c0 ). However, the pathological erythrocytes response on in vitro action of the different antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, a-tocopherol, quercetin) had a diverse character that can be a significant test under antioxidant therapy prescription. It is known that long-term social isolation and the disorder of natural circadian rhythm is considered an important stress factors, which cause a variety of metabolic and mental disorders. It should be noted that the impact of the stresses takes up a larger area, according to, review of the action of their mechanism is one of the topical issues of modern science. It is estimated that as a result of stress the metabolic processes change in the organizm. Because of this, we've studied the functionality of the antioxidant system in laboratory rat heart muscle cells and blood under psycho-emotional stress. It was found that quantitative changes of nitric oxide (NO) was initiated the process of LPO, which caused oxidative stress in the cells and decreased antioxidant enzymes activity, such as catalase,SOD, GPx and GR. The results suggested that psycho-emotional stress was accompanied by oxidative stress, causing a reduction in the intensity of energy metabolism in cardiac muscle cells, which was further strengthened by the fact that the activity of the enzymes involved in ATP synthesis in mitochondria was reduced. Also, we've studied exogenous creatine positive and negative affects on energy metabolism and blood lipid spectrum. Based on this, we proposed that psychological stress is one of the factors contributing to the development of various cardiac diseases. The importance of free radical lipid transformations, which differ from the peroxidation processes, was pointed out for the first time in our laboratory studies. We have found that ROS can induce free radical destruction processes of sphingolipids with C-C-bond cleavage [Lipids, 2011, 46:271-276; Lipid insights, 8, 1-9] . In case of acylated sphingolipids, they can undergo decomposition with C-C-bond cleavage upon direct UV irradiation [Photochem. Photobiol., 2012, 88:899-903] . It was of interest to establish the possibility of photosensitized decomposition reactions of not acylated sphingolipids, which do not absorb an ultraviolet.",

Introduction: Thymoquinone (2-methyl-5-isopropyl-1,4-benzoquinone, TQ) exerts a great antitumor activity against different types of cancer cells. A growing body of evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation followed by modulation of the AKT and MAPK pathways is a general mechanisms underlying the TQ antitumor action. However, the data of TQ effects on the MAPK pathway are conflicting. To date, the activation or inhibition of the MAPK protein family seems to depend on the cell type and on the TQ concentration used. In order to elucidate the antitumor potential of TQ against gliomas and the underlying molecular mechanism, TQ influence on C6 rat glioma cells functioning was studied. Results: It has been shown that the cultivation of C6 cells with TQ in concentrations of 10 -100 lM during 24 hours strongly inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell death with ID 50 of 60 lM. At the same time, TQ induces ROS generation and intracellular GSH depletion in a dose-dependent manner, that is followed by the mitochondrial potential decrease. Interestingly, ROS production has only cytoplasmic, but not mitochondrial origin in cells challenged with TQ at the concentrations up to 100 lM. Two-electron reduction of TQ by DT-diaphorase attenuates TQ anticancer efficiency whereby inhibition of DT-diaphorase by dicumarol increases TQ-induced C6 cell death by 25 %.",

Conclusion: Antitumor effects of thymoquinone on C6 glioma cells is a result of ROS generation and intracellular GSH depletion, that is followed by mitochondria disfunction, and growth arrest via PI3K pathway.

P-09.04.4-008 Acute different doses of malathion induce cholinesterase inhibition, glucogenic enzymes and histopathological change in rat liver Malathion, which is an organophosphorus compound, is a widely used pesticide all over the world. Despite its benefits, Malathion has many toxic effects on many tissues including liver. We designed to evaluate the acute different doses of Malathion on cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition, gluconeogenic enzymes and histopathological change of rat liver. For this purpose 4 groups were formed. Rats in Group 1 served as control group animals which were only given corn oil. Group 2, Group 3 and Group 4 were administered 100, 200, 400 mg/kg of Malathion, respectively, dissolved in corn oil by oral gavage. The rats were sacrificed after 24 hours following administration and the livers of rats were removed. The liver ChE, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were studied using autoanalyzer. Histopathological investigation was performed using microscope. The liver ChE activities of Group 2, Group 3 and Group 4 were inhibition percentage of 53%, 43%, and 51% respectively, comparison of Group 1's ChE activity. The liver ALT, AST and LDH increased in Group 3 and Group 4 compare to Group 1 and Group 2 (p < 0.013). We also observed that there was vacuolar and hydropic degeneration in liver of Group 4. According to our result, acute administrations of Malathion result in hepatotoxic effects with increasing doses. Background and aims: An imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants is closely linked to the onset of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant status and the lipid peroxidation in patients admitted to hospital immediately after AMI. Methods: The study population comprised 19 patients with AMI and 14 healthy subjects. Patients that had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) less than 72 hours since onset were selected for this study. Antioxidant status was assessed by lactonase activity of paraoxonase (PON1 DHC), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and plasma uric acid level. Malondialdehyde was used as marker of lipid peroxidation. Results: Compare with the control group, the levels of MDA and PON1 DHC were significantly higher in group with AMI (p < 0.005, respectively p < 0.001). Elevated levels of MDA (p < 0.005) were found in patients with AMI compare with the control subjects. AMI patients had also statistically significant reduced levels of TEAC (p < 0.005) comparative with healthy subjects. No statistically significance was found for plasma uric acid level in subjects from our study. Conclusion: A high lipid peroxidation correlated with a decreased TEAC activity suggest an exacerbated oxidative stress in subjects admitted to hospital immediately after an AMI.

However, we found that a strain lacking FET3 is more sensitive to Cu surplus conditions than a strain carrying the AFT1 gene disrupted. This finding suggests that under such conditions another regulator came into play and controls FET3 gene expression. We next evaluated whether Ace1 could be the alternative regulator of FET3 under Cu excess. To test this hypothesis we first constructed the double mutant aft1ace1 and assayed its fitness under Cu surplus. As expected, the double mutant is much more sensitive to Cu than the single aft1 or ace1 mutants. We next monitored the expression of FET3 gene in cells lacking ACE1, using yeast-one hybrid and qRT-PCR approaches. Our data clearly indicates that FET3 expression is dependent on Ace1 when Cu is overly abundant.",

Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss, cognitive impairment. Oxidative stress is a contributory factor in AD pathogenesis. Glutathione (GSH) is the main antioxidant cellular defence. The ratio of GSH/GSSG shows the redox status of GSH, and plays important role in maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis. The current study was carried out to determine oxidative DNA damage and ratio of GSH/GSSG which plays an important role in protection of target molecules from oxidation in the patients with AD. Methods: The study subjects were consisted of patients with AD (n = 67) and age matched control group (n = 42) who were treated and followed in the Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty Hospital, Department of Neurology and Department of Internal Medicine/ Geriatrics. DNA strand breaks and H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage were determined in lymphocyte DNA with comet assay. The GSH and GSSG levels in the erythrocyte lysates were measured by using a commercial spectrophotometric kit. The ratio of GSH/GSSG were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 22 software package. Results: DNA strand breaks and H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage were found to be higher (p = 0.000 for all), the ratio of GSH/GSSG was found to be lower (p = 0.024) in the AD group than control group. There was no significant difference between male and female for DNA strand breaks and H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage in the AD group, but ratio of GSH/GSSG were higher in male when compared with female (p = 0.045). No significant difference was found between the men of AD group and men of the control group for GSH/GSSG ratio whereas women of the AD have a lower GSH/GSSG ration than those in the women of the control group (p = 0.009). Conclusion: Increased systemic oxidative DNA damage and DNA susceptibility to oxidation may be resulted from diminished GSH/GSSG ratio in AD patients. This finding shows the importance of antioxidant support in AD management.

P-09.04.4-015 Synergistic anticancer effects of sulforaphane and cisplatin through the induction of apoptosis and autophagy following oxidative stress in malignant mesothelioma cells Malignant mesothelioma is characterized by poor responsiveness to current chemotherapeutic drugs, usually owing to high resistance to apoptosis. Here, we investigated chemosensitizing effects of phytochemical resveratrol, in combination with cisplatin, on malignant meothelioma cells. Cell viability was evaluated using MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was detected with DAPI staining, caspase 3/7 activity assay and flow cytometry. Cell cycle distributions, ROS levels and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined using flow cytometry. The expression of cell cycle-, apoptosis-, and autophage-related proteins was measured with Western blotting. The combination treatment of cisplatin and resveratrol (Cis/Res) synergistically induced apoptosis, as evidenced by typical cell morphological changes, the appearance of a sub-G 0 /G 1 peak, an increase in the Annexin V(+) cells and the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. Cis/Res increased ROS production and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential with an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. These changes were attenuated by pre-treatment with N-acetylcysteine, suggesting that Cis/Res induced apoptosis through oxidative mitochondrial damage. Compared with MSTO-211H cells, Cis/Res was less efficient in killing H-2452 cells. H-2452 cells exhibited an enhanced autophagy to Cis/Res, as observed by an increase in viable cells exhibiting intense LysoTracker Red staining and up-regulation of Beclin-1 and LC3A. Inhibition of autophagy by bafilomycin A1 rendered cells more sensitive to Cis/Res-induced cytotoxicity and this was associated with induction of apoptosis. These data indicate that the increased resistance of H-2452 cells to Cis/Res is closely related to the activation of self-defensive autophagy, and provide the rationale for targeting the autophagy regulation in the treatment of malignant meothelioma. Stress oxidative induced by chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (CP) causes vulnerability in sperm and decline of fertility. This study was aimed to evaluate the role of ethyl pyruvate (EP) in the amelioration of fertility and growth of primitive embryo in animals that received CP. 24 adult male mice (6-8 weeks) were randomly divided into 3 groups: Control group received normal saline (0. 2 ml/day, IP), CP group received CP (15 mg/kg/week,\u00ac IP), the CP+EP group received EP (40 mg/kg/day, IP) along with CP, were treated for 35 days. 8 mice from each group were arranged for evaluation of sperm quality and in vitro fertilization (IVF) too.

Thus, there is a need for revealing novel cytophysiological effects of low doses of phytochemicals towards cancer cells. In the present study, we have considered thirty one nutraceuticals and selected four phytochemicals acting at low micromolar range (5 to 20 lM) against phenotypically different MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells, namely diosmin, sulforaphane, ursolic acid and betulinic acid. Nutraceuticals inhibited cell proliferation and caused changes in the cell cycle that was accompanied by elevated levels of p53, p21, p16 and/or p27. Apoptosis (Annexin V staining, multicaspase and mitopotential assays) was observed exclusively when nutraceuticals were used at the concentration of 20 lM, whereas at the concentration of 5 lM, stress-induced premature senescence was noticed (SA-b-gal activity). Nutraceuticals diminished the levels of GLUT-1 and selected glycolytic enzymes. Nutraceuticals promoted oxidative and nitrosative stress as judged by increased production of total reactive oxygen species, total and mitochondrial superoxide, nitric oxide and protein carbonylation. Nutraceuticals also stimulated DNA single and double strand breaks that was accompanied by ATM phosphorylation and to a lesser extent by histone H2AX phosphorylation and 53BP1 foci formation.",

Group 2 (IR+CAPE) received total cranium irradiation plus CAPE, was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) just before giving to the rats, intraperitoneally (IP) every day. Group 3 (IR) received 5 Gy of gamma irradiation as a single dose to total cranium plus 1 ml saline daily. Group 4 received daily plain DMSO. Group 5 received daily plain saline. At the end of the 10 day time period, xanthine oxidase (XO), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities, nitric oxide (NO\u2022) and peroxynitrite (ONOO -) levels were significantly higher in IR group compared to all other groups. In conclusion, the results suggest the radioprotective ability of Propolis and CAPE involving prevention of radiation-induced oxidative/ nitrosative damage.

            "text": "Objective: Increased oxidative stress is one of the major characteristics of obesity and obesity-related complications. Adipokines also induce the production of reactive oxygen species and generating oxidative stress in physiological and pathological conditions of obesity. The aim of this study was to determine the association of leptin and adiponectin levels with body mass index, lipid parameters and oxidative stress biomarkers in obesity. Methods: The study included 150 obese and 120 non-obese subjects. Plasma leptin and adiponectin levels (ng/ml) were measured using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Serum lipid, superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde and antropometric parameters were measured. Results: Obese and non-obese subjects did not differ in age, while plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and leptin levels were significantly higher and mean HDL cholesterol and adiponectin levels were significantly lower in obese than non-obese subjects. The plasma leptin (p < 0.001) and adiponectin (p = 0.003) levels were significantly correlated with BMI in both obese and non-obese subjects. In obese subjects, leptin levels were significantly correlated with superoxide dismutase (p < 0.01) and malondialdehyde (p < 0.01). Strikingly, adiponectin was significantly correlated with superoxide dismutase (p = 0.02) and malondialdehyde (p = 0.0012) levels in obese group. Conclusion: Our results suggest that leptin and adiponectin levels are associated with defective antioxidant status and increased lipid peroxidation which may have implications in the development of obesity related health problems. Clinical trials of biologically active plant substances show a significant preventive effect in cancer, cardiovascular diseases and peptic ulcer disease in the form of both nutritional supplements and therapeutic intervention. Anthocyanins contained in dark berries show great antioxidant potential, with the most important including a reduction in oxidative degradation of lipids or tyrosine oxidation by peroxynitrite. Our previous studies of the antioxidant properties of extracts from Vaccinium corymbosum, Aronia melanocarpa and Sambucus nigra, however, indicated that their activities largely depend on the method of extraction. While quantitative determination of anthocyanins pointed to a disproportionately larger content of anthocyanins in isolates from lyophylized berries, their scavenging activities against hydroxyl radicals was surprisingly the lowest. Inflammatory processes, vascular damage, atherosclerosis and others are caused by oxidativenitrosative stress, so we tested their efficiency to scavenge NO degradation products. We found that only purified extracts of lyophilized berries showed the most significant effects against NO degradation products, with efficacy of around 50%. An extract from aronia showed greater than 60% efficiency, and a net ethanol extract from all the berries showed a 30% effect. Cleaned ethanol extracts showed the lowest effects, while aronia initiated production at a concentration of 25 mg/l. Conversely, all acetone extracts consistently initiated NO degradation products. These findings are in complete contrast to their determined action against reactive oxygen species. In summary, it follows that a particularly adjusted lyophilized extract of the berries could be responsible for the increased biological activity of NO and the observed biological and pharmacological activities of anthocyanins in circulatory disorders. The study was supported by grant VEGA 1/0782/15 and 1/0018/16.

The leaves, fruit and bark of Annona muricata, a member of the Annonaceae family, are commonly used in the traditional medicine of tropical and subtropical regions. In recent years, many studies have shown their anti-cancer, anti-convulsant, antiarthritic, anti-parasitic, anti-malarial, and anti-diabetic activities. It should be noted that these characteristics have been described using different types of extracts from different parts of the plant. Our studies have focused on the systematic characterization of activities most easily accessible from an aqueous extract of leaves, with hitherto documented antihypertensive and hepatoprotective effects. We found that the extract shows almost 54% efficiency against hydroxyl radicals. With increasing concentrations, the effectiveness weakened, reaching a second peak (40%) at a concentration of 50 mg/l. The scavenging activity against NO degradation products maintained a continuously increasing trend with a maximum at a concentration of 100 mg/l. Surprisingly, the extract initiated peroxynitrite production in a similar trend, except at 50 mg/l, where it scavenged peroxynitrites with relatively high efficiency, up to 34%. These findings are consistent with the elevated levels of reduced glutathione detected after incubation of liver mitochondria with extract to a maximum concentration of 50 mg/l, with subsequent sharp decline. The activity of glutathione S-transferase was decreased, although not significantly. This indicates a reduction of metabolic processes of compounds, allowing their action over a longer period of time. In a live system, even antihypertensive effects can be observed. However, a significant outflow of GSH to create the GSH adducts of active substances, and particularly S-nitrosoglutathione from increased production of peroxynitrites, can cause liver toxicity.

Polyamines (PAs) play an essential role in cell cycle, proliferation, growth and carcinogenesis of various cancer types such as prostate, colon and breast cancer. ODC (ornithine decarboxylase) is the key enzyme in the PA biosynthetic pathway that is under control of Antizyme (AZ) and Antizyme Inhibitor (AZI) activity. PA catabolic enzymes polyamine oxidase (PAO) and spermine/spermidine acetyle transferase (SSAT) by-products triggers reactive oxygene species (ROS) generation and apoptotic cell death. Curcumin decreased cell viability in dose and time dependent manner in T47D wt and GH+ cells. Although forced GH expression induced cell proliferation, 20 lM curcumin inhibited cell invasion. Curcumin (20 lM) induced apoptosis by acting on intrinsic and extrinsic pathway in both cell lines. Moreover, curcumin supressed ODC, AZI expression in wt and GH+ T47D cancer cells. Although curcumin decreased AZ expression in T47D wt cancer cell, increased AZ expression was determined in T47D GH cancer cell. PAO and SSAT expressions were upregulated in T47D GH+ cells. Concomitantly, putrescine levels were increased in T47D GH+ cancer cell compared to wt cells and curcumin depleted spermidine and spermine levels in wt and GH + T47D cells. Curcumin induced-apoptotic cell death via ROS generation and co-treatment of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) overcame curcumin effect. Conclusion, forced GH expression triggers cell proliferation and growth via acting on polyamine metabolism and curcumin-triggered ROS generation was prevented by NAC treatment in T47D wt and GH+ breast cancer cells.

Bakir 2 1 Ankara Universty Faculty of Medicinel, Ankara, 2 Zekai Tahir Burak Research and Training, Hospital Genetic Center, Ankara, Turkey Introduction and aim: Down sydrome (DS) can be diagnosed at high-risk of down syndrome pregnancies by invasive prenatal testing. In this study we aimed to demonstrate antioxidant/oxidant system markers, IL6 and IL10 levels in amniotic fluid samples of pregnancies affected by DS. Materials and methods: For this purpose we collected amniotic fluid samples from 18 pregnancies affected by down sydrome and 36 normal healthy pregnancies who applied to Zekai Tahir Burak Research and Training Hospital Genetic Center and were proceeded with amniocenthesis. In the amniotic fluid samples; malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathion peroksidase (GSH-Px) xhantine oksidase (XO), catalase (CAT), adenozine deaminase (ADA), nitric oxide (NO), nitric oxide senthase (NOS) enzymatic activities were evaluated by spectrophotometric methods, IL6 and IL10 levels are evaluated by ELISA. For statistical analysis Student's t-test and Spearman corralation analusis are used. Results: It was found that SOD levels are significantly elevated in study group compared to control group (p < 0.05). Besides this, in study group, CAT and IL-6 levels are found singnificantly lower than control group (p < 0.05). We couldn't find any significant difference between two groups in terms of MDA, GSH-Px, XO, NO, NOS, ADA ve IL-10 levels (p > 0.05). Discussion and conclusion: There is an important decrease in inflammation compared to normal pregnancie in the amniotic fluid of pregnancies having DS. Based on these results, SOD enzyme may be used as a marker for prenatal diagnosis of DS. For this purpose these experiments should be tried on larger sample groups.

P-09.04.4-050 Investigation of ischemia-modified albumin levels in patient with acute limb ischemia Introduction: Acute limb ischemia commonly occurs as a result of embolus caused by cardiac origin and which may end up with limb loss or even death if left untreated. Thrombosis are usually seen where the arteries give branches and tendency to atherosclerosis is more serious at these sites. Involvement of several arteries in either embolus or in situ thrombosis limits the adequacy of collateral circulation. Restriction of blood flow due to arterial stenosis or occlusion often leads patients to complain of muscle pain on walking. Any further reduction in blood flow causes ischemic pain at rest, which affects the foot. Early recognition may prevent limb loss or death. Ischemia can alter the capacity of the amino terminus of the albumin to bind free metal atoms such as cobalt, copper and nickel. This new, chemically changed albumin is called ischemia modified albumin (IMA). IMA is a sensitive marker of myocardial ischemia, skeletal muscle ischemia, pulmonary embolism, mesenteric ischemia and stroke. Therefore, in this study it was aimed to investigate the IMA level in acute limb ischemia. Materials and methods: In this study, 24 patients with acute limb ischemia (LI group; mean age 62 years) and 34 healthy individuals (control group; mean age 42 years) were included. IMA levels were detected in control and LI group by ELISA (Organo Teknika, Avusturya) using IMA EL _ ISA kit. Results: IMA values were compared with nonparametric methods Mann Whitney U test, and significantly decreased IMA level was statistically significantly different between LI group and control group (p < 0.001). Conclusion: There is a significant increase in serum IMA in limb ischemia, so that alterations also might be clinically useful in the diagnosis of limb ischemia, but should be supported with further studies. Object: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multifaceted disorder with a pathogenetic pathway that is not fully understood yet. Apart from hormonal derangements, insulin signaling defects and adipose tissue dysfunction, oxidative stress, defined as an imbalance derived from excessive formation of oxidants in the presence of limited antioxidants defenses, has been actively implicated in the etiology of the syndrome. The aim of this study was to determine of serum myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), paraoxonase 1 activity (PON1) and arylesterase activity (ARE) in patients with PCOS. Material and methods: The study was carried out on 150 women consisted of 103 patients with PCOS and 47 healthy ones as control. Serum PON1 activities were measured spectrophotometrically using diethyl-p-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate. Phenylacetate was used as substrate for ARE measurement, and ARE activity was determined by measuring absorbance of the resulting phenol at 270 nm. Molar absorptivity coefficients were used in the calculation of PON and ARE activities as 1 nmol phenol/ml serum/min. Result: The MPO and ARE activities were significantly lower in the patient groups when compared with the control group (72.09 AE 60.66 -119.74 AE 90.81 U/ml p < 0.001, 47.43 AE 12.21 -83.93 AE 26.38 U/ml p < 0.001, recpectively). The PON1 activities are higher in the patient group (145.55 AE 98.23 U/ml) compared to the control group (153.33 AE 101.90 U/ml) are found, but are not statistically significant. Conclusion: Lower serum MPO and ARE activities might contribute to the increased susceptibility for the development of diseases risk in women with PCOS. Because free oxygen radicals are thought to contribute to the complication of many chronic diseases, the PCOS may be related to oxidative stress. Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated serum thyroid stimulating hormone level associated with serum thyroid hormone concentrations within the reference range. Free radicalmediated oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of thyroid disorders. The ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) has been proposed as a marker of protein oxidative damage, which has been found to reflect hypoxic stress. This study aimed to investigate the influence of subclinical hypothyroidism on serum IMA levels.",

P-09.04.4-067 Relative contribution of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms to oxidative/nitrosative stress in the cerebral cortex of rat with acute liver failure (ALF) Acute liver failure (ALF) is associated with deregulation of NMDA/cGMP/NO signaling and oxidative/nitrosative stress in the brain. However, the relative roles of the different NOS isoforms and the mechanisms underlying alterations in their activities during ALF are not fully clear. Here we investigated gene and protein expression of NOS isoforms, NOS activity, eNOS uncoupling and total NO production in cerebral cortex of rats with thioacetamide (TAA)-induced ALF. Sprague Dawley rats (250-280 g) received three i.p. injections of TAA (300 mg/kg) at 24 hours intervals. The brain cortex expression NOS isoforms (eNOS/iNOS/nNOS) was measured by Real-time PCR and Western Blot, NOS activity was tested by monitoring the conversion of radiolabeled arginine to citrulline. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified in the presence of NOS substrate L-arginine, using the carboxy-H 2 DCFDA probe. NO was measured with the Griess procedure. The eNOS expression was decreased, whereas the eNOS dimmer/monomer ratio and nNOS/iNOS expression were elevated in TAA treated rats. While the total NOS activity was decreased, the iNOS activity was elevated and NO concentration tended to increase. ROS production was elevated by TAA. Unspecific NOS inhibitors L-NAME and L-NNA attenuated ROS production in both control and TAA rats, but with higher efficiency in the latter case. Ca 2+ chelation had almost the same effect as pharmacological NOS inhibition suggesting that Ca 2+ -independent iNOS activity is not the main source of ROS. Incubation with high dose of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) with which is critical for eNOS dimerization and subsequent NO production also reduced ROS production indicating the eNOS uncoupling phenomenon in TAA cortex. The study points to eNOS downregulation due to lowered protein expression and uncoupling as a novel mechanism contributing to enhanced superoxide O 2 anion formation, and confirms the role of iNOS/nNOS in enhancing NO synthesis in ALF-affected brain. Introduction: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an endocrine disorder of world which is characterized by altered blood glucose levels and related complications including hepatic injury. Myrtus communis L. (MC) is widely used by diabetic patients in the folk medicine of Turkey as well as they are used worlwide. It is known that of leaves, oil and fruit of Myrtus communis L. (MC) have therapeutic effects on diabetes mellitus (DM). This study was aimed to analyze the possible antidiabetic and hepatoprotective effects of MC berries in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. Materials and methods: A total of thirty rats composed of six groups as each included five rats were used. 40 mg/kg STZ was injected once to animals to induce DM. After STZ injection, rats were exposed to three different ethanol extracts of MC berries (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg) by oral gavage during 14 days.",

Background: Human serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a calcium dependent esterase that hydrolyzes organophosphates and also arylesters such as phenyl acetate. PON1 prevents LDL oxidation by hydrolyzing lipid peroxides. PON1 is inhibited by various chelating agents, heavy metal ions, and sulfhydryl reagents. In our study we investigated the effect of calcium on LDL oxidation of purified PON1 Q192R isoenzymes. Methods: PON1 Q192R isoenzymes were partially purified from human serum. Both allozymic forms were treated by preincubation with 1 mM EDTA for 15 minutes. LDL oxidation was induced by copper ions. Formation of thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS) was used as a measure of lipid peroxidation. Homocysteine thiolactonase (HTLase activity) and arylesterase activities were measured spectrophotometrically by using homocysteine thiolactone and phenylacetate as the substrates.",

Synaptosomal fractions extracted from pooled rat brains were incubated with different doses of ethanol, aspirin and betaine, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, an important indicator of cellular damage, were measured. A significant increase (p < 0.05) was observed in MDA level of 200 mM ethanol group compared to control group. Different doses of ethanol (50 mM, 100 mM ve 200 mM) + aspirin exposure significantly increased (p < 0.001) MDA levels compared to controls, whereas betaine administration significantly decreased (p < 0.001) lipid peroxidation caused by ethanol + aspirin treatment. We conclude that ethanol and ethanol + aspirin administration increases lipid peroxidation in rat brain synaptosomes while betaine helps prevent this peroxidative membrane injury.Keywords: Aspirin, betaine, ethanol, malondialdehyde (MDA) P-09.04.4-081 Analyses of mitochondrial biogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma treated with berberine F.

            "text": "Objective: Berberine (BBR) has been demonstrated to have anticancer activities against various cancer types, particularly hepatoma. In this project, we aimed to reveal the effect of BBR treatment on mitochondrial biogenesis through sirtuins and HIF-1a in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HEP3B under hypoxia. Method: HEP3B cells were subjected to normoxia (21% O 2 ) and hypoxia (1% O 2 ) in the presence or absence of BBR treatment. The amount of BBR was optimized via cell viability (MTS) assay under normoxia. Then, immunoblotting experiments were performed to identify the effect of BBR on HIF-1a, PGC-1a, and sirtuins involved in mitochondrial stress. The variation in the OXPHOS complexes and the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also measured to investigate the effect of BBR on mitochondrial energy stress state. Results: Here, we present that cell viability was significantly decreased at 25 lM. BBR treatment has shown significant reduction in HIF-1a and SIRT6 which responsible for up-regulation of glycolysis. Also, succinate dehydrogenase (CII) and cytochrome c oxidoreductase (CIII) of the OXPHOS complexes were downregulated without any change in NADH dehydrogenase (CI) or ATP synthase (CV). BBR significantly abolished to oxidative stress under hypoxia, which was demonstrated as a reduction in the level of reactive oxygen species by decreasing on SIRT3 expression. BBR induces the overexpression of SIRT1 and its deacetylated-PGC-1a, which might be an indicator of being a potent protective agent against hypoxia by normalizing mitochondrial function and inducing mitophagy in impaired mitochondria caused by deficiency of glycolysis and OXPHOS. Conclusion: Detailed information about the communication between HIF-1a and sirtuins and their relation to mitochondrial energy production was provided with the alteration of their activity by BBR treatment. It is highly expected that BBR and its derivatives might become important during the development of supplemental therapies. Introduction: Reactive oxygen species are involved in a variety of biological phenomena, such as carcinogenesis, inflammation and aging. Among the targets of ROS, DNA appears most important in tumor biology since it is firmly established that cancer is a genetic disease. ROS induce several kinds of DNA damage, including strand breakage and DNA-protein cross-linkage. Fruit of Zizyphus jujuba, a traditional Chinese herb widely consumed in Asian countries, has been reported to possess several vital biological activities. This study intends to evaluate their antioxidant activity on glioblastoma cells. Materials methods: Cell survival was quantified by colorimetric MTT assay. Human gliblastoma cells were pretreated with 100 lM H 2 O 2 after 30 minutes 100 lM Ziziphus jujuba essential oil was added to the cells for three hours. Then, the cell homogenates were taken and glutathione, Total oxidant and total antioxidant capacity and nitric oxide levels were estimated using spectrophotometric methods. Results: Ziziphus jujuba treated cells could prevent intracellular glutathione from being depleted following an exposure of H 2 O 2 . Also our data suggest that Ziziphus jujuba is effective in preventing H 2 O 2 induced oxidative stress and nitric oxide levels.",

            "text": "Discussion: Some research showed that H 2 O 2 was over produced in the pathological process of acute and chronic neuronal toxicity, the toxicity effect of b-amyloid on the cultured neuron and neuronal cell line was mediated by H 2 O 2 . The traditional medicine recommend several medicinal plants for providing relief from various inflammatory diseases. Many research has been reported that the essential oil from seeds of helping to prevent the oxidative stress and neuronal diseases in brain. Introduction: Toxicity by oxygen radicals has been recommended as a major cause of cancer, heart disease, and aging. Oxygen radicals and other oxidants appear to be toxic in large part because they start the chain reaction of lipid peroxidation. Most of the analytical techniques for peroxide determination are generally time consuming and not very suitable for routine or on line analysis. We aimed to design a new biosensor for rapid determining of oxidant agent hydrogen peroxide. Materials and methods: All reagents were of analytical grade unless stated otherwise, and were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Firstly, the 2-Hidroxymetacrilate Metacriloamidoscystein nanoploymers were immobilized by binding covalently with sulphur atoms on the gold electrod's surface. Free NH 2 groups of catalase enzyme make Schiff bases between nanopolymer's carbonyl groups, then immobilization was actualysed with cross linking reagent glutaraldehyde. We developed a biosensor system preparing ferrociyanide, selected as a mediator, in the buffer solution. Results: PolyHemaMac nanopolymer and catalase complex were immobilized by glutaraldehite to construct a hydrogen peroxide biosensor. The responses of the biosensor are therefore proportional to the oxidation peaks of the complex at +0.019 V potential. The cyclic voltammograms obtained from the experiments showed that, pottasiumferrociyanide mediator complex positively affected the biosensor responses for hydrogen peroxide determination. Discussion and conclusion: As a result of this study, the method developed by the catalase enzyme electrode was found to be more advantageous in comparison to other methods reported in the literature so far; it was determined that the method is sensitive, economic, practical and less time-consuming. Since biosensor technology provides economical, practical, specific and sensitive results for the determination of hydrogen peroxide, it was improved very efficiently.

P-09.04.4-089 Effect of Nigella sativa on biliary obstructioninduced oxidative stress and apoptosis in rats human safety concerns, since that these agents may not only cause acute toxicity via inhibition of acetylcholinesterase but they can also induce delayed toxicity in the nervous system. A key interest to the current work is the potential correlation between gene expression and cytoskeletal protein changes in differentiating neural cells exposed to sub-lethal neurite outgrowth inhibitory concentrations of specific OPs, which was addressed by analysing the underlying changes in the levels of cytoskeletal gene expression and protein levels. To assess the molecular effects of OP exposure, phenyl saligenin phosphate (PSP), chlorpyrifos (CPF) and its metabolite chlorpyrifos oxon (CPFO) were applied at the point of induction of differentiation of rat C6 glioma and mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells and incubated for 24 hours. At sub-lethal concentrations (1, 3, 10 lM) all three OPs used in this study were able to inhibit the development of neurites with no significant effect on cell viability, as determined by neurite outgrowth and MTT reduction assays. To understand the possible effects of OPs on cytoskeletal gene expression, primers for genes encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), bIII tubulin, growth associated protein 43 (GAP43) and neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) were optimized for qPCR analysis and the levels of the corresponding proteins were detected by western blot analysis. Exposure to OPs caused in most cases a reduction in the levels of cytoskeletal proteins, and the results from qRT-PCR analysis also indicated reductions in the gene expression of GFAP in C6 cells, and of NEFH and bIII tubulin in N2a cells, in a dose dependent manner. Thus, the observed changes in protein levels are at least partly due to altered gene expression. Curcumin is extracted from a perennial herbaceous plant known as Curcuma longa.

P-09.04.4-093 Relationship between serum ceruloplasmin levels and coronary blood flow Background: There is growing evidence that oxidative stres plays an important role in the development of the slow coronary flow (SCF) phenomenon. Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a copper containing metalloenyzme which has antioxidant functionthrough its ferroxidese 1 activity and is associated with cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to investigate the relationship between SCF and serum Cp level. Methods: Patients who underwent elective coronary angiography and had no significant epicardial coronary disease were included in the study. Patients who had Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction frame counts (TFCs) above the normal cutoffs were considered to have SCF and those within normal limits were considered to have normal coronary flow (NCF). A total of 90 patients (55 subject as SCF and 35 subjects as NCF) were analyzed. 5 ml blood samples were taken from the groups to study ceruloplasmin activity. Serum ceruloplasmin levels were determined spectrophotometrically. Results: The serum Cp levels were statistically lower in SCF group than in the NCF group (414 AE 79 versus 469 AE 99 ng/ml, p = 0.009). Also there was a significant correlation between serum Cp levels and TFCs (r = \u00c00.378, p = 0.013). Conclusion: The findings of this study suggests that patients with SCF had lower serum Cp levels correlated with TFCs. We concluded that reduced serum Cp levels might represent a biochemical marker of SCF. Introduction: Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has been used for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity, as a first step or definitive treatment. Alterations of thyroid hormones in gastrointestinal surgery were previously studied. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of triiodothyronine (T3) supplementation on oxidative stress parameters in anastomotic tissue level. Materials and methods: Twenty-four male Wistar albino rats were divided into control (n 12), and experimental (n 12) groups. Rats were underwent a SG, with a hand-sewn suture. Experimental group rats received a single dose of T3 (400 mg/100 g) in postoperative day. Rats were sacrificed on postoperative day 7. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3 (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4) were analysed using ELISA. Each tissue was homogenized in ice-cold PBS (pH: 7.4) and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 minutes (4\u00b0C) to avoid contamination with cellular debris. The supernatants were used to measure total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. All tissue parameters were analysed by spectrophotometric methods. Oxidative stress index (OSI) values were calculated. Results: Rats given T3 hormone had not decline in FT3 levels compared with the control groups. A significant decrease in FT4 levels was found in T3 given rats on postoperative day 7. Whereas tissue TOS levels did not alter by thyroid hormone treatment, TAS levels significantly decreased. OSI values were not statistically different in tissues. Tissue NO levels were also similar in both groups. MDA levels increased in T3 given rats compared with the control group. Discussion and conclusion: This study showed that anastomosis after sleeve gastrectomy is associated with decreased FT4 level. Although TOS levels and OSI values were similar in both groups, T3 supplementation induced lipid peroxidation by increasing tissue MDA levels that might deplete tissue antioxidant level. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are reactive chemical molecules, which are produced by living organisms as a natural byproduct of the normal metabolism and environmental factors. Although intracellular ROS level is essential molecules for the signal transduction pathways, elevated intracellular level of ROS leads to oxidative stress that causes damage to DNA, proteins and lipids. Therefore, excessive ROS levels have to be eliminated by antioxidant defence systems. TIP60 (Tat interacting protein, 60 kDa) is a histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that catalyses multiple functions in metabolism such as DNA repair, apoptosis, etc. We thought that if TIP60 has a role in signal transduction and apoptosis, it might have direct or indirect relationship with the antioxidant system.",

P-09.04.4-100 Effect of overexpression of Bacillus catalase on Lactococcus lactis nisin production Z. Girgin Ersoy, S. Tunca Gedik Gebze Technical University, Kocaeli, Turkey Nisin, has been used commercially (E234) in food preservation for approximately 40 years. It's the only bacteriocin which is approved by World Health Organization as a food additive. The fundamental problem that limits nisin usage in food preservation is low product yield by producer strains. Because of high commercial potential of nisin, studies about increasing the production efficiency of nisin is kept in the forefront in recent years. Since nisin biosynthesis and bacterial growth are occuring in parallel to each other, conditions that promote growth are also expected to encourage nisin production. It is known that, when supplied with exogenous heme, Lactococcus lactis cells can respire under aerobic conditions and produce higher energy which in turn cause higher biomass. However, aerobic conditions also cause oxidative stress since catalase enzyme, which detoxify hydrogen peroxide, is absent in L. lactis.",

Materials and methods: Thirty-five Sprague Dawley male rats (weights ranging 180-220 g) were randomly divided into 7 groups, as each composed of 5 rats. After Hippophae rhamnoides L. leaf ether extracts of 100 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg doses and 20 mg/kg doses of famotidin orally administered, 25 mg/kg doses of indomethacine were orally applied to rats in order to make ulcer. On the sixth hour of indomethacin administration all rats were sacrificed using thiopental (50 mg/kg). The stomachs were removed, and ulcer areas were evaluated macroscopically. Superoxide dismutase activity (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in stomach tissues of rats were determined by ELISA method with respective kits",

            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by systemic features and joint involvement which affects 1% of the world's adults. It can give rise to important morbidity and mortality. Vitamin D might be one of the environmental factors relevant with RA. Vitamin D is a steroid hormone precursor that undergoes chemical conversion in the liver and kidney: the first reaction produces 25OHD3, an objective indicator of vitamin D status, and the second produces the main bioactive form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). The aim of this study was to investigate the serum vitamin D levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective observational study; evaluating the vitamin D values of 47 healthy control and 109 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The mean age for controls and patients were 50, 89 AE 9.22 and 53.87 AE 13.44, respectively. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed using an Shimadzu LC-20-AD (Kyoto, Japan) coupled with a ABSCIEX API 3200 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (USA) equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) operating in positive mode for determination of vitamin D. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v16.Results: The mean of vitamin D values in patients with RA (15.44 AE 8.04) were significantly lower compared to control group (21.18 AE 12.89) (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Vitamin D plays an immunomodulatory role in inflammatory arthritis. Our results suggest that Vitamin D supplementatiton is recommended to patients with RA.

Over a billion people worldwide are vitamin D deficient or insufficient. Both vitamin D and thyroid hormone bind to similar receptors called steroid hormone receptors. Our aim was to examine the serum vitamin D levels in patients with hypothyroidism. Material and Methods: This is a retrospective observational study; evaluating the vitamin D values of 47 healthy controls aged 37.5 AE 13.1 years and 1104 patients with hypothyroidism aged 36.3 AE 16.5 years. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed using an Shimadzu LC-20-AD (Kyoto, Japan) coupled with a ABSCIEX API 3200 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (USA) equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) operating in positive mode for determination of vitamin D. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v16. Results: The mean of vitamin D values in patients with hypothyroidism (14.67 AE 7.28) were significantly lower compared to control group (21.18 AE 12.89) (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Vitamin D has various effects on body's metabolic pathways. Besides bone mineral homeostasis, Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with a wide range of non-skeletal effects. According to this study's results, decreased vitamin D levels may be related to thyroid function disorders.P-MIS-037Co-encapsulation of curcumin and piperin in zein-chitosane nanocapsules by electrospray M. \u20ac Ust\u20ac undag, Y.

MPV levels calculated with Abbott Cell Dyne Hematology analyzer, AT-III levels calculated with Sysmex CA-1500 analyzer, Homocysteine levels calculated with SHIMADZU-HPLC. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v16. Results: The Homocysteine values was 14.16 AE 8.24 lmol/L. MPV values was 9.16 AE 1.6. AT-III vasues was 100.08 AE 16.04.Our study has showed us AT-III and MPV values has a negative correlation (p = 0.016). When MPV values increase in patients with Behcet Disease, AT-III levels were decreasing. Homocysteine levels and AT-III levels is not correlated in Behcet Disease (p:0.24). Conclusions: Our analyses showed that; homocysteine levels and AT-III levels is not correlated in Behcet Disease, and increase in MPV values with patients Behcet Disease, AT-III levels decrease and this finding might be useful and valuable in the etiopathogenesis of Behcet Disease.",

Aim of this study was the evaluation of Lactobacillus lactis effect on AKT gene expression in HT29 cell line. Method: Lactobacillus lactis bacteria and HT29 cancer cell line were cultured and the MTT assay was used for cytotoxicity evaluation of bacteria onto HT29 cancer cell line culture. The total cell RNA was extracted for cDNA synthesis after coculture of bacteria and cancer cell line, then AKT gene expression was evaluated using Real time PCR. Results: MTT assay test showed that bacteria had cytotoxic effect on HT29 cell line after 24 h. Real time PCR results showed that AKT gene expression was decreased after bacteria and HT29 coculture. Conclusion: The reduction of HT29 cancer cell line proliferation may be related to effect of bacteria onto AKT gene expression.

Probiotic bacteria present in the intestine directly related to reduce colorectal cancer, that in the context, researchers opinion is involve several of cell signaling in this process.In order to, in this study the effect of Lactobacillus lactis in PTEN gene expression was evaluated. Method: The Lactobacillus lactis and HT29 cancer cell line, each separately cultures in specific media, then the bacteria was added to HT29 cell line culture. To evaluate the toxicity of these bacteria on HT29 cancer cell lines MTT assay was perform. Total RNA was extracted from HT29 cell line and cDNA synthesized, followed by performation the Real time PCR. Results: The results of MTT assay indicated that Lactobacillus lactis has toxic effect on HT29 cell line and reduced proliferation. Analysis of the results of the Real time PCR was shown that there was positive effect on PTEN gene expression .Conclusion: overexpression of PTEN gene in the presence of Lactobacillus lactis reduced the proliferation of HT29 cancer cell line, the possibility that this could be done through inhibition of AKT gene.

The mean age for controls and patients were 44.9 AE 3.8 and 40.8 AE 10.6 years, respectively. Patients with chronic disease and inflammatory disorders were excluded. NLR levels were calculated with Abbott Cell Dyne heamotolgy analyzer. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v16. Results: The NLR values in patients with SLE disease [2.05 AE 0.80] were significantly higher compared to control group [1.76 AE 0.42] (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our analyses confirmed previous studies; Although it has not been considered as a spesific marker, NLR might be a useful and valuable inflammatuary marker in patients with SLE.

Materials and methods: Serum samples were collected from 67 healthy control and 20 patients with Ovarian Carcinoma. The mean age for controls and patients were 51.71 AE 14.02 and 59.00 AE 9.31 respectively. MPV levels measured with Abbott Cell-Dyn 3700 Hematology Analyzer. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v21 by using independent sample t test. Results: MPV values in patient with Ovarian Carcinoma [7.31 AE 1.25] were higher compared to control group [7.02 AE 0.81] but it was not statistically significant (p = 0.69) Conclusions: Although MPV is a inflammation marker, our analyses showed that MPV cannot be used for a inflammatuary marker in patients with Ovarian Carcinoma.

The aim of this study was to invesigated the values of HbA1c in hemoglobin variants presence using High Performance Liqued Chromatography (HPLC). Materials and methods: Blood samples were obtained from 59 patients with twenty-seven Hb SS, five SS(F), one Hb D _ Iran, one Hb D-Los Angelas/A, two Hb O Arab, one Hb E-Saskatoon, two Hb G-Coushatta/A, twelve Hb AD, six Hb AE, one Hb EE, one Hb SE. Whole blood samples (3 ml) were collected K 3 EDTA tubes. Levels of HbA1c of these cases were measured by Agilent 1100 HPLC systems. Results: We found that the HbA1c values for all hemoglobin variants were below the reference range using a HPLC method. Especially, HPLC method gave a zero HbA1c result for all patients with Hb SS, Hb SS(F), Hb D Iran, Hb EE and Hb SE. Discussions: Accurate and precise measurement of HbA1c is extremly important. We observed that measurement of HbA1c in patients with hemoglobin variants may give misleading HBA1c results. Conclusions: HLPC method can be adversely affected by the presence of hemoglobin variants. P-08.01.4-021 Effects of ADRA2A genetic variants on type 2 diabetes-related traits N. Hamad 1 , T.

            "text": "Background: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with several conditions and/or diseases like inflammation, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease and mortality. Several studies showed that lower vitamin D levels were associated with high serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers. YKL-40 is a glycoprotein, secreted by macrophages, neutrophils and different cell types. It is also associated with inflammation and pathological tissue remodeling. In this study, we aimed to evaluate relationship between the vitamin D deficiency and YKL-40 levels. Methods: Our study group includes 45 subjects with vitamin D deficiency (Group 1) and 40 age and sex-matched healthy subjects with normal serum levels of vitamin D (Group 2). Plasma 25 (OH) vitamin D levels were measured with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. Plasma YKL-40 analysis was performed by ELISA. Serum hs-CRP levels were measured with nephelometric method. Results: Plasma vitamin D levels below 20 ng/ml were accepted as vitamin D deficiency. Although we could not find any significant differences by means of serum hs-CRP levels between groups (p > 0.05), plasma YKL-40 levels were significantly higher in group 1 than group2 (p < 0.05). Conclusions: In literature, vitamin D deficiency is associated with inflammation. In our study, we found similar hs-CRP levels between groups and higher YKL-40 levels in group 1. Vitamin D deficiency may be related to increased YKL-40 levels in terms of causing chronic inflammation.Keywords: Vitamin D deficiency, YKL-40, inflammation.",

Apelin is a novel endogenous peptide with inotropic and vasodilatory properties and is the ligand for the angiotensin receptor-like 1 (APJ) receptor. We aimed to determine genotype and allele frequencies of APJ receptor A445C gene polymorphism in Turkish patients with CAD and healthy controls by RFLP-PCR. This study was performed on 159 unrelated CAD patients and 62 healthy controls. We obtained AA, AC and CC genotype frequencies in CAD patients as 41.5%, 49.1% and 9.4%, respectively. In the control group, frequencies of genotypes were found as 35.5% for AA, 48.4% for AC and 16.1% for CC. We did not observe difference in APJ receptor A445C polymorphism between CAD patients and healthy controls (v 2 = 2.178; df = 2; p = 0.336). The A allele was encountered in 66% (210) of the CAD and 59.7% (74) of the controls. The C allele was seen in 34% (108) of the CAD and 40.3% (50) of the controls. Allele frequencies were not significantly different between groups (v 2 = 1.57; df = 1; p = 0.225). The frequencies of APJ receptor A445C genotype were not significantly different between control and patients. Individuals with CC genotypes had significantly higher weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels and systolic blood pressure than other genotypes, p \u2264 0.05. In addition, HDL-C level was found decreased, but this reduction was not statistically significant. Contrarily, the low levels of weight, SBP, DBP and TC were statistically significant in the subjects with AA genotype in CAD. In conclusion, CC genotype carriers may have more risk than other genotypes in the development of hypertension in CAD. We suggest that this polymorphism may not be a marker of CAD, but it may cause useful in function of the apelin/APJ system and may be a genetic predisposing factor for diagnostic processes and can be helpfull in finding new treatment strategies. P-08.01.4-032 Comparative genomics/proteomics analyses of single amino acid repeat containing proteins across different vertebrate taxa A. G. Keskus, O. Konu Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Bilkent University, Ankara, TurkeyConsecutive runs of single amino acids lead to overrepresentation of certain physicochemical properties in protein sequences. Researchers also demonstrated a link between single amino acid repeat (SAAR) containing proteins and neurodegenerative diseases as well as biological functions. Moreover, SAAR frequencies were shown to vary across species based on selected orthologous proteomes and/or proteins. Hence, analysis of whole proteomes across multiple vertebrate taxa may provide additional species-and sequence-specific trends for SAARs. In addition, there is a need for testing the observed SAAR occurrencesThe aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of quercetin (Q) on liver injury secondary to cerulein induced-acute pancreatitis (AP). For this reason, rats were randomly divided into four groups (8 rats for each group) Control group received physiological saline, four time and dimethyl sulfoxide, two time, at 1 hours intervals, intraperitoneally (i.p.). Cerulein group received cerulein (50 lg/ kg-rat weight, in physiological saline), four times, and dimethyl sulfoxide (1%), two times, at 1 hour intervals, i.p. Quercetin pretreatment (Q+Cer) group received quercetin (100 mg/kg-rat weight, in dimethyl sulfoxide) one time, one hour before cerulein treatment and physiological saline, one time, six hour after cerulein treatment. Quercetin post-treatment (Cer+Q) group received dimethyl sulfoxide, one time, one hour before cerulein treatment and quercetin, one time, six hour after cerulein treatment. Cerulein treatment increased significantly vascular congestion in hepatic cells. Quercetin treatment also decreased significantly vascular congestion. The liver MDA and carbonyl levels in cerulein group were significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.01, p < 0.001, respectively). The MDA and carbonyl levels in Q+Cer group decreased significantly compared to the Cer group (p < 0.001). The MDA, Carbonyl, MPO levels in Cer+Q group were significantly lower than the Cer group (p < 0.001). The GSSG/GSH ratio of Q+Cer and Cer+Q groups were significantly lower than the Cer group (p < 0.05, p < 0.001, respectively). The SOD activity in Cer group was significantly lower than the control group, but the SOD activity in Q+Cer and Cer+Q groups was significantly higher than the Cer group (p < 0.05).This study shows that quercetin treatment was reduced the severity of liver injury secondary to cerulein induced-AP as reflected by changes in the parameters of hepatic oxidant and antioxidant. P-09.04.4-029 Identification of water extract of propolis components by using different columns in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry Propolis is a natural material obtained by honey bees from various plants. Protective effect of propolis against damages of free radicals is due to different compounds within propolis. The aim of this study is to identify qualitatively and quantitatively the chemical composition of water extract of propolis (WEP) provided by Erzurum region using Rtx-1 and Rtx-5 ms column of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and to compare with two columns.In this study, WEP of 25 mg/ml was prepared, cleared by membrane filter of 0.45 lm and freezed at \u00c080\u00b0C. Then, it was lyophilized up to dry form and derivatized to apply for gaseous form. 7 mg of dry extract was reacted with 350 ll pyridin + 700 ll bis-trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) mixture including 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) and incubated for 30 minutes at 100\u00b0C. All analyses were performed with Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra by using a flame ionisation detector (FID). Rtx-1 and Rtx-5 ms capillary columns and helium for carrier gas at a flow time of 1 ml/minute were used. Injection was applied on split mode at 250\u00b0C. Derivatized propolis sample was injected as 2 ll, initial column temperature was adjusted as 60\u00b0C, then increased to 240\u00b0C with increments of 3\u00b0C. Total analysis time was determined as 62 minutes. Relative percent amount of separated compounds was calculated from total ion chromatogram with computerised integrator. All components were defined by using Nist and Wiley libraries.Peaks obtained from Rtx-1 column were much more than those of Rtx-5 ms. On the other hand, analyses performing with both two columns have similar carbohydrate, aromatic acid and other acid contents.Consequently chemical constituents of WEP were determined qualitatively and quantitatively with GC-MS. It was concluded that Rtx-1 column among both columns differentiating for polarities may produce more compounds in the propolis analysis. Introduction: Aquatic environment can be mostly contaminated by mixtures of metals. Biochemical parameters have gain importance to characterize the effects of metals on aquatic organisms. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and its substrate glutathione (GSH) are important parameters of antioxidant defense system of fish metabolism due to their vital role in xenobiotic conjugation. Objective: The goal of the current study to evaluate the changes in GST and GSH levels in response to Cd, Zn and Cd+Zn effects after 14 and 28 exposure days. Materials and methods: Fish were obtained from Cukurova University fish culturing pools (Turkey). Fish were exposed to 1.0 lg/ml of Cd (CdCl 2 .H 2 O) and Zn (ZnCl 2 ), and their mixture, for 0, 14 and 28 days. At the end of the exposure period, liver tissues were dissected and homogenized in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 g (30 min, +4\u00b0C). Supernatants were stored at \u00c080\u00b0C until the analysis. One-way ANOVA was used to compare data (Mean AE SE) followed by Duncan's test (p < 0.05). Results: GST and GSH changes were recorded as decreases after all metal exposures at day 14. Although 28 day exposure was found as less effective, combined effects caused significant decreases in GST and GSH levels. Also longer exposure durations were appeared to be more effective in that situation. Conclusions: Significant decreases in GST and GSH levels could be occurred due to increased reactive oxygen species caused by metals particularly their combined effects. Metal type, their single and combined effects and also exposure duration should be also taken into account when considering the antioxidant system response. GST and GSH might be considered as sensitive biomarker in toxicity assessment of metal mixtures.Financial Support: This study was supported by a grant from C \u00df ukurova University (Turkey).Background/Aims: The activation of lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) on endothelial cells leads to intracellular oxidative stress and inflammation and a feed-forward cycle of injury in diabetes, since both oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDLs) and glucose increase LOX-1 expression. Quercetin (QR) is part of a subclass of flavonoids called flavonols. Polyphenolic compounds affect the development of atherosclerosis not only through antioxidant properties but also by modulation of serum lipids, thereby influencing the immune and inflammatory processes associated with the development of atherogenic diseases. We investigated the effects of dietary QR on endothelial dysfunction mediated by oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL)/lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) in animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: We compared 4 groups of male adult Wistar albino rats: a control group, an untreated diabetic group, diabetic groups treated with QR, and QR group. Diabetes was induced by a single injection of STZ (50 mg/kg). Animals were kept in standard condition. In 30 day after inducing diabetic, serum was collected for biochemical parameters. Glucose, lipid profiles, microalbuminuria, oxLDL and LOX-1 levels were determined. Results: Serum triglyceride, LDL, VLDL levels in diabetic control group (without treatment) was significantly higher than control group (normoglycemic untreated group). Supplementation with quercetin decreased serum total cholesterol and increased HDL-cholesterol compared with the control group. Serum oxLDL and LOX-1 levels in diabetic control group (without treatment) were significantly higher than control group (normoglycemic untreated group). Conclusions: Consumption of quercetin reduced oxLDL and LOX-1 levels. Thus, quercetin could be effective in improving hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and endothelial damage in type 2 diabetes. P-09.04.4-055 Investigation of some oxidative stress parameters in Bdnf heterozygous mice liver tissue A. Bodur 1 , I. Ince 1 , I. Abidin 2 , A. Alver 1 Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible protective effects of Nigella sativa (NS) against cholestatic oxidative stress and liver damage in the common bile duct ligated rats. Methods: A total of 24 male Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups:sham control, bile duct ligation (BDL) and BDL+received NS; each group contain 8 animals. The rats in NS treated groups were given NS (0.2 ml/kg) once a day orally for 4 weeks starting 3 days prior to BDL operation. Results: The changes demonstrating the bile duct proliferation and fibrosis in expanded portal tracts include the extension of proliferated bile ducts into lobules, mononuclear cells, and neutrophil infiltration into the widened portal areas were observed in BDL group. Treatment of BDL with NS attenuated alterations in liver histology. The alpha smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b1) and the activity of TUNEL in the BDL were observed to be reduced with the NS treatment. BDL significantly increased the tissue hydroxyproline (HP) content, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and decreased the antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)) activities. NS treatment significantly decreased the elevated tissue HP content and MDA levels and prevented the inhibition of SOD and GPx enzymes in the tissues. Conclusion: The data indicate that NS attenuates BDL-induced cholestatic liver injury, bile duct proliferation, fibrosis, apoptosis and oxidative stress. The hepatoprotective effect of NS is associated with antioxidative potential. Organophosphorous compounds (OPs) are used widely as pesticides for agricultural purposes, as oil additives or as flame retardants. However, due to their widespread use, there are major Introduction: In this study, the antiulcerogenic effect of a water extract (CAWE) obtained from a spices sample, Cinnamomum aromaticum, was investigated using indomethacin-induced ulcer models in rats. Materials and methods: Experimental groups consisted of six rats. Antiulcerogenic activities of 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg body wt. doses of the CAWE were determined by comparing the negative (treated only with indomethacin) and positive (famotidine) control groups. Results and discussion: Although all doses of the CAWE showed significant antiulcerogenic activity as compared to negative control groups, the highest activity was observed with 400 mg/kg body wt. doses (45%). The CAWE showed similarly antioxidant activity when compared with trolox and ascorbic acids used as positive antioxidants. In addition, the activities of catalase (CAT) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzymes were determined in the stomach tissues of rats and compared with those of the negative and positive control groups to expose the effects of these enzymes on antiulcerogenic activity. The enzymatic activities of CAT and MPO and lipid peroxidation (LPO) level in indomethacin-administrated tissues were increased significantly by indomethacin in comparison to control groups. These enzymes and LPO level were decreased, however, by the CAWE. In contrast to LPO level, CAT and MPO activities, glutathione (GSH) level was decreased by indomethacin and increased by all doses of CAWE and famotidine. The present results indicate that the CAWE has a protective effect in indomethacin-induced ulcers, which can be attributed to its antioxidant potential. Introduction: Thiol groups (-SH) are important anti-oxidants and essential molecules protecting organism against the harmful effects of oxidative stress. The aim of our study is to evalute thiol-disulphide homeostasis with a novel and automated method in patients with prostate cancer (PC) before and after radical prostatectomy (RP). Material and methods: 18 patients with prostate cancer and 17 healty control subjects were enrolled into the study. Plasma samples were collected from patients before RP and 6 months after the RP operation. Thiol-disulphide homeostasis was determined with a recently developed novel method. Prostate specific antigen, albumin, total thiol, native thiol, disulphide and total antioxidant status (TAS) were evaulated and compared between the groups. Results: Native thiol levels were 419.8 AE 54.87 lmol/l in the control group, 350.7 AE 46.35 lmol/l in the patients before RP, and 364.3 AE 46.88 lmol/l in patients after RP. Native thiol, total thiol and TAS levels were significantly higher in the control group than the patients before RP (p values < 0.001). Native thiol, total thiol and TAS levels were higher 6 months after RP compared to before RP in patients, but these changes were not significant statictically (p values 0.3, 0.3 and 0.09 respectively). Discussion and conclusion: Our study demonstrated that antioxidant defense mechanism was weakened as indicated by the decreased thiol levels in the patients with PC. Increased oxidative stress in prostate cancer patients may cause metabolic disturbance and have a role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.

            "text": "The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that any degree of antepartum screening for gestational diabetes mellitus with oral 50 g glucose challenge test (GCT) should be associated with oxidant-antioxidant status.In this prospectif study, oral glucose challenge test was applied to 25 pregnant women aged 25-40 years and at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Plasma glucose concentrations were measured initial, 1 hour and in addition to test 2 hours after ingestion of 50 g glucose. At the same time serum insulin, cortisol, total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS) levels were measured and the oxidative stress index (OSI) was calculated.Ten pregnant women (forty percent) had a positive glucose challenge test (GCT). A positive moderate relation with initial and 1 hour serum total antioxidant status (TAS) levels (r = 0.68) and the oxidative stress index (OSI) (r = 0.67) was found. There was a positive weak correlation with initial and 2 hours total oxidant status (TOS) levels (r = 0.22) but statistically significance difference was not found (p > 0.05).In this study after ingestion of 50 g glucose serum total antioxidant status (TAS), serum oxidant status levels (TOS) and serum oxidative stress index (OSI) levels were higher than the initial levels.The results of this study suggest that antepartum screening for gestational diabetes mellitus with 50 g oral glucose challenge test (GCT) weakly associated with oxidant-antioxidant status and to confirm this results the longer follow-up studies with more participants are necessary.Wheat (Triticum ssp.), cultivated for centuries in the Middle-East, Central Asia, Europe, and North-Africa, is one leading staple crops around the World, and its marginally grown ancestor einkorn (Triticum monococcum ssp. monococcum), possesses rich gene resources for wheat improvement and have bioactive compounds reducing and preventing chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, alzheimer, and cardio vascular diseases, beside their nutritional properties. However, as more attention has been given to wheat cultivars with strong gluten, protein content, starch composition, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses in bread wheat and yellow-colored pasta product in durum wheat health compounds such as fibers, phytochemicals, and bioactives have been underestimated so far. The aim of this study was, then, to examine the total phenolics and flavonoids, quantify their phenolic acids, a-tocopherol by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and their 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity of bread (Triticum aestivum L.), durum (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum Desf.) wheat cultivars and einkorn (Triticum monococcum ssp. monococcum) wheat populations collected from different provinces (Bolu and Kastamonu) of Turkey. Ferulic acid (148.67-764.04-lg/g), p-coumaric (5.06-54.09-lg/g), and total phenolic content (ranged 2.06-8.11-lmol GAE/g) of einkorn populations were significantly higher than bread and durum wheat cultivars. Results suggested the possibility of production of einkorn wheat populations, and hopefully cultivars rich in particular health beneficial component(s) may provide benefit to the consumers. In addition, higher phenolic content of einkorn may offer novel wheat genetic resources for the improvement of new wheat cultivars and the development of wheat-based functional foods. Oxidative damage due to ischemia and acute kidney injury (AKI) after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are the leading complication during this process. In the kidney, ischemia/ reperfusion injury contributes to AKI that is a clinical syndrome with rapid kidney dysfunction and high mortality rates. Some animal and clinical studies have demonstrated an increase in serum and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) expression after renal ischemic injury.In this study, our aim was to investigate the relationship betwwen NGAL and oxidative stress parameters due to ischemia caused by total perfusion time (TPT) in patients who have undergone on-pump CABG. Materials and methods: The study was conducted in 30 patients who received on-pump CABG at University of Istanbul, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Department of Cardiovascular Surgery. Blood samples were collected prior to surgery and after 2 hours following the termination of cardiac pulmonary bypass (CPB) . Following centrifugation, serum samples were separeted and stored at -80 C until analysis. Serum NGAL, IMA (Ischemia modified alb\u20ac umin), PCO (Protein carbonyl), NT (Nitrotyrosine), LPD (Lipid peroxide) levels were determined by ELISA procedure. Results and discussion: Serum NGAL, PCO, NT levels in after 2 hours following CPB were significantly higher than the before surgery (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p Serum NGAL levels in after 2 hours following CPB was found to have positive correlation with IMA, PCO, NT, and LPO levels (r = 0.59, p < 0.01; r = 0.77, p < 0.001; r = 0.68, p < 0.001; r = 0.77, p < 0.001 respectively). NGAL levels were positively correlated with total perfusion time after CBP (r = 0.37, p < 0.05).The results of our study show that, increased NGAL levels 2 hours after CPB were positively correlated with oxidative stress parameters and total perfusion time.",

            "text": "Investigation of the effects of thymoquinone against indomethacine induced gastric damage in rats Introduction: Incidence and high cost of acute stomach mucosa damages make this issue a very interesting issue for study. For this reason, it is aimed to investigate the effects of different dosage of thymoquinone (TQ) against indomethacine induced gastric damage in rats. Material and method: In our study, six groups of 36 Wistrar male rats were used. Groups are named as healthy, IND control, Famotidine (40 mg/kg) and three different doses of TQ (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg). While any treatment or drug administration will done on healthy group, model was generated to other groups by giving FAM or TQ with tap water via oral gavage. 5 min later, 25 mg/kg IND administrated to each rat. Animals were sacrified about 6 hour later and stomach samples of each groups were collected for macroscopic study and GSH levels measurements. Results: Lower doses of TQ is more effective and all TQ groups exhibit reduced ulcer region with respect to the IND control group. GSH level of IND control group is lower than healthy group. The GSH level of TQ, especially in lower doses, and FAM groups statistically exhibit an increase in GSH level. Conclusion: It is observed that IND induced gastric damage cause ulcer and increase in free radical. It is determined that lower doses of TQ (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) is also exhibit a protective effect on IND induced model. It is tought that quinone in TQ structure have a strong redox feature and this feature clean up the free radicals caused by IND, it reduces the oxidative stress and protect the stomach from ulcer. Anzer honey is the most famous honey in Turkey with many endemic species flowers. The Anzer Plateau is located Rize province of Eastern Black Sea Region. In this study, antioxidant and anti-hyaluronidase and anti-urease activities were investigated of the plateau bee pollen. The antioxidant capacity was determined by total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoids contents (TFC), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,2diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, and as a chronic inflammatory disease, caused by a complex interplay between inflammatory and oxidative events.Quercetin, a plant derived flavonoid and a well-known antioxidant, has shown great promises with regards to its protective effects against oxidative stress.However due to its physicochemical properties, the optimum pharmacokinetic behavior is a challenging issue.Herein, we aimed to fabricate quercetin loaded solid lipid nanoparticle (Quer-SLN) to improve the bioavailability and therapeutics efficiency. Furthermore the in-vitro capacity of Quer-SLN for ameliorating TNF-a induced oxidative stress in human endothelial vein cell (HUVEC) was evaluated. Quer-SLNs were prepared by simple hot homogenizing method and characterized by means of drug loading (DL), encapsulation efficiency (EE), cytotoxicity, size, zeta potential and morphology. Antioxidant activity of plain quercetin and Quer-SLNs were then investigated using intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection method (DCFH-DA assay) by FACS flowcytometryIn conclusion, the results here showed superior control of oxidative stress by quercetin nanosystem as compared to plain quercetin. Precirol based SLNs as a biocompatible/biodegradable lipid, may provide a novel drug delivery system for quercetin with improved beneficiary impact in atherosclerosis. Objective: Zinc is known as an antioxidant essential trace element. We aimed to evaluate the dose-dependent effects of zinc on the oxidant-antioxidant system in liver, kidney and brain tissues of rats and the histological alterations in the absence of oxidative stress (OS). Material and methods: Thirty-nine female weighing about 150 gr Wistar albino rats were divided into four experimental groups as ad libitum (AL) diet (control), AL diet + 3 mg/kg Zn sulfate (low dose; group 1), AL diet + 12 mg/kg Zn sulfate (middle dose; group 2) and AL diet + 25 mg/kg Zn sulfate (high dose; group 3). Zn sulfate solutions were administered 0.2 ml/day orally for 13 days and in day 14 rats were sacrificed and tissues were excised for detecting malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities. Histological evaluation was also performed to confirm the effects of zinc. Results: In liver tissues AOPP levels decreased in all groups receiving zinc as compared to the control group. Liver MDA levels were increased in group 1 and 3; SOD and GSH-Px levels were both increased while GST levels were decreased in all groups compared to control. GR levels were increased only in Group 2. In kidney; AOPP level was decreased only in Group 1 and SOD level was only decreased in Group 2 as compared to control while GR levels were increased in all doses of zinc. In brain; AOPP, GSH-Px and GR levels were decreased in all groups receiving zinc as compared to control group. SOD activity in brain tissues was increased by the administration of middle dose of zinc (Group 2). GST level was decreased in only group 1 Conclusions: The biochemical and histological findings of this study suggest that zinc has various effects on liver, kidney and brain tissues in the absence of OS.Key Words: Zinc, liver, kidney, brain Introduction: This study aimed to investigate the effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) on oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity in humour aqueous (HA) and venous serum using total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidative stress (TOS) levels in serum and HA in cataract patients. Materials and methods: In this study patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 was composed of patients with type 2 DM and cataract and group 2 was composed of patients with cataracts who are not accompanied by DM and cataract patients who are not accompanied by systemic diseases. Each group consisted of 20 patients, totally 40 patients were included in the study. The HA which was collected from the eyes at the beginning of the cataract surgery and venous blood serum collected from the same patients were analyzed. In both groups, HA and serum TAC and TOS levels were measured with ELISA. Results: : Serum TAC levels in the DM group were significantly lower than in the control group (p < 0.05). TOS serum levels in DM group was statistically higher than the control group (p < 0.05). Differences between TAC and TOS levels were not statistically significant when compared the two groups' HA results (p > 0.05). Group 1, divided into two subgroups according to their HbA1c levels, there was no statistically significant difference between the subgroups when HbA1c levels were compared with the relationship between serum and HA's TAC and TOS levels (p > 0.05). There was not an association between the gender, age and the levels of TAC-TOS in both groups (p > 0.05). Discussion and conclusion: Presences of DM is the only risk factor for increase of oxidative stress and decrease of anti-oxidant capacity in patients without a systemic complication of DM and diabetic retinopathy. In our study, diabetic patients without retinopathy showed similar HA TOS and TAC levels to healthy individuals, this finding indicates that blood-aqueous barrier is protected in these patients.",

Ural 2 1 Department of Histology and Embriyology, School of Medicine, Dokuz Eyl\u20ac ul University, Izmir, 2 Department of Molecular Medicine, Health Science of Institute, Dokuz Eyl\u20ac ul University, Izmir, TurkeyTestis torsion is one of the urologic emergencies occurring frequently in neonatal and adolescent period. Testis is sensitive to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and, therefore, ischemia and consecutive reperfusion cause an enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that result in testicular cell damage and apoptosis. Ferulic acid, known as an antioxsidant, is a phenolic acid found in seeds and leaves of the plants. We aimed to investigate potential protective effect of ferulic acid against testis I/R injury.Thirty five Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups; control, ethyl alcohol, ischemia, I/R, I/R-ferulic acid groups. Animals were exposed to 2 hours of ischemia followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. Ferulic acid was administered (100 mg/ kg) before reperfusion intravenously. Testicular cell damage was examined by H-E staining and PAS. TUNNEL, active caspase-3, iNOS and MPO were evaluated by immunostaining. Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) levels, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were assessed by biochemical methods.Histological evaluation showed that ferulic acid pretreatment reduced significantly testicular cell damage and decreased TUN-NEL, caspase 3 positive cells; iNOS and also MPO expression. In addition, ferulic acid administration decreased significantly the MDA levels increased by I/R. Morever, ferulic acid increased significantly the SOD activity levels, which was decreased by I/R. There were no statistically significant differences in the levels of GSH and GPx activity in all groups.The present results suggest that ferulic acid is a potentially beneficial agent in protecting testicular I/R. Background: In heart failure (HF), angiotensin antagonists (AA), beta-blockers (BB), spironolactone, diuretics and acetylsalicylic acid are often used. Top 3 pharmaceutical groups reduce mortality. On the increased oxidative stress (OS) in patients with HF, it is known to have beneficial effects of certain groups of drugs. However, the net effect of these drugs in OS is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of drugs used in HF on OS. Materials and methods: 133 patients were included in the study. All of the patients had systolic heart failure and all of them were under treatment. Drugs used by the patients were recorded. The levels of total antioxidant status (TOS), total oxidant status (TAS), the enzymatic activity of ceruloplasmin, paraoxonase-1 and arylestherase were measured according to Erel's method. Serum total thiol levels were measured with SH Modified HU method and the lipid hydroperoxide levels were measured with the ferrous ion oxidation xylenol orange assay. The percentage TOS / TAS was determined as OSI. Results: In patients treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), spironolactone, beta blocker and furosemide, there were increased TOS, decreased TAS and OSI (p < 0.05). In patients treated with angiotensin blockers, increased TAS and LOOH, and decreased SH were found (p < 0.05). In patients treated with nitrates and CCB, TOS and OSI were found decreased. Correlation analysis showed that increased TAS correlated with the use of angiotensin blockers, ASA, furosemide and beta blocker positively; and with the TOS and OSI level correlated with the use of spironolactone, ASA spironolactone and furosemide (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Current medical agents that are being used in HF are effective in reducing OS in HF patients. One of the effective mechanisms to reduce the mortality of some of these drugs may decrease OS.Key Words: Heart Failure, drug use, oxidative stress P-09.04.4-119 Across adjacent ring formed titanium phthalocyanine-mediated photodynamic therapy alters and degrades filamentous actin cytoskeleton and internal membranes Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is widely accepted as a promising and minimally invasive treatment strategy due to its applicability on a wide range of cancer diseases. This clinically approved treatment method relies on the dramatic production of singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in target tissue to evoke apoptotic cell death [1] . We, therefore, focused on the intracellular ROS accumulation, internal membrane degradation, filamentous actin cytoskeleton alteration and nucleus morphology changes induced by PDT-mediated across adjacent ring formed titanium phthalocyanine which was previously synthesized Bis(ethane-1,1p-phenol-2,2-p-phenoxy) phthalocyaninatotitanium (IV).Characterization of the synthesized metallophthalocyanine was accomplished by using UV-vis, IR, 1 H-NMR and MALDI-TOFmass spectroscopies. The dark and PDT-mediated activities of bare and phosphonolipids (max. 5%) charged titanium phthalocyanine (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10 lM) were determined on A549 human lung carcinoma and HaCaT human keratinocyte cell lines by using intracellular ROS assay, DIOC(6), TRITC-phalloidin and DAPI staining protocols. Waltmann PDT 1200 l was used as the non-toxic light source at 100 J/cm 2 fluence and 150 mW/ cm 2 fluence rate. The experiments showed that PDT-mediated titanium phthalocyanine leads to significant and concentration dependent reactive oxygen species accumulation. Moreover, internal membrane degradation, apoptotic bodies on nucleus and filamentous actin cytoskeleton alteration were observed. Consequently, the activity mechanism of PDT-mediated titanium phthalocyanine seems to be in a tight relationship with ROS accumulation-mediated internal membrane degradation, filamentous actin cytoskeleton alteration and apoptotic pathways activation. Introduction: Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a common retinal vascular disorder that can affect visual acuity and cause blindness in elder population. Sulphur containing aminoacids such as cysteine (Cys), cysteinylglycine, glutathione, homocysteine and c-glutamylcysteine are reported to be associated with the pathogenesis of RVO. Thiols are organosulfur compounds that are formed of a carbon-bonded sulfhydryl group. Sulphur containing aminoacids slightly contribute the composition of plasma thiol pool. Thiols can undergo oxidation reaction via oxidants and form disulphide bonds Our purpose is to research the relationship between a novel oxidative stress marker serum dynamic thioldisulphide homeostasis and retinal vein occlusion. Materials and methods: 22 RVO patients and 22 controls were included in the study. Native thiol, total thiol, disulphide levels are measured in the serum samples of RVO and control group by using an automated method described by Erel et al. Also disulphide/native thiol and disulphide/total thiol ratios were calculated.",

Further large sample sized studies investigating the levels of sulphur containing aminoacids may additionally be planned to verify this study. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate markers of systemic oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity in subjects with severity of OSAS. Methods: A total of 106 OSA patients were included in the study (18 controls, 14 with mild, 14 with moderate, and 60 with severe OSA). Patients were grouped according to apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) as mild, moderate and severe OSA. Patients with AHI<5 served as control group. Known risk factors for oxidative stress, such as age, sex, obesity, smoking, hypelipidemia, and hypertension, were investigated as possible confounding factors. Plasma arylesterase, total oxidative stress (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total thiol, catalase (CAT) levels were measured for all patients. Results: The mean age was 52.49 AE 12.9 years and 40.6% (43/ 106) of the study population was female. Plasma arylesterase, TOS, TAC, total thiol, and CAT plasma values were not different between mild, moderate, severe OSA groups and controls (p > 0.05). Catalase levels were significantly lower in women patients with severe OSA compared to healthy women controls (p < 0.05). There was a negative correlation between AHI and serum total thiol levels (r = \u00c00.289, p < 0.05) in severe OSA groups. ConclusionThe present prospective study provides evidence that OSA might be associated with decreased antioxidant burden possibly via catalase way. Results: The sera 8-OHdG, MDA and IL-6 were significantly higher in diabetic group than control group (P < 0.05). Although there was a notable positive correlation between MDA and 8-OHdG, there was no a relationship between 8-OHdG or MDA with IL-6. Discussion: In agreement with previous studies our data illustrated that high levels of oxidative stress is associated with increased production of oxidized lipids and nucleobases in diabetic patients compared to control group. Also enhanced proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6, induced inflammmation in these patients.Conclusion: Oxidative stress and inflammation play pivotal roles in the development of diabetes and can cause major complications in DM. So we suggest that early detection of these measurable indicatores can help to diagnosis the severity or presence of some complication in diabet.",

The control group (n = 6) received physiological saline. The quercetin group (n = 7) received quercetin (120 mg/kg/ day) via i.g. route The Alcohol Group (n = 7) received ethanol (80% v/v, 1 ml/day) via i.g. route. The Alcohol + Quercetin Group (n = 5) received 1 ml of Ethanol (80% v/v) 2 hours after quercetin treatment (120 mg/ kg/day). Experimental procedures were peformed for 30 days. Erythrocyte G-6-P-D activity was found to be higher in the Quercetin Group than those in the Alcohol Group (p < 0.001). In the Alcohol Group, the erythrocyte G-6-P-D activity was found to be significantly decreased than those in the Control Group (p < 0.001). Statistically significant differences were observed in erythrocyte G-6-P-D activity between the Alcohol Group and the Alcohol + Quercetin Group (p < 0.001).As a conclusion, our results demonstrate that ethanol decreased erythrocyte G6PD activity and quercetin was found to be beneficial in the prevention of toxic effect raised by ethanol.Key words: Erythrocyte, ethanol, G6PD, oxidative stress, quercetin P-09.04.4-126 Effects of the sulphasalazine to the cerebral hypoxia reperfusion injury in rat Background: Cerebral ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) injury is still a difficult process to treat and rehabilitate today. This study was designed to investigate beneficial effects of sulfasalazine in cerebral I/R injury in rat. Methods: Except CONTROL group (n = 5), 20 Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups for acute and chronic stage investigation of I/R injury, and temporary aneurysm clips were attempted to both internal carotid arteries for duration of 30 minutes. Four hours later, except CONTROL, SHAM-A, SHAM-C groups, 40 mg/kg once a day sulfasalazine was administered to animals, orally. Animals were sacrified and then necrotic neuronal cells of hippocampal CA1, CA2, and CA3 region, and cortical necrotic neurons, perivascular edema, pyknotic neuronal cells, irregularities of intercellular organization (IIO) were counted and scaled histopathologically. Tissue IL-1b, IL-6, malonyldialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidation (MPO), NO, and TNF-a levels were measured by using ELISA, too. Results: Sulfasalazine could reduce perivascular edema, IIO, cortical and hippocampal neuronal cell death in both stages. It could decreased MDA in acute stage, but not reduce IL-1b, IL-6, MPO, NO, and TNFa levels. It could increased IL-1b levels in chronic stage but not affect to IL-6, MPO, MDA, NO, TNF-a levels.Conclusion: Sulfasalazine could improve histopathological architecture of hypoxic tissue in both stages of I/R injury. It could inhibit lipid peroxidation cascades in acute stage but not affect to tissue MPO, NO, IL-6, and TNF-a levels in any stage in rat. These results suggested that therapeutic mechanisms of sulfasalazine should be investigated by using more specific laboratory methods in future studies.Key words: antiinflamatory, cerebral hypoxia reperfusion injury, sulfasalazine, stroke. Camel and horse milk xanthine oxidase (XO) was found to catalyze the reduction of nitrate and nitrite to nitric oxide (NO) under aerobic condition. To date, mammalian nitrate reductase (NaR) and nitrite reductase (NiR) have not been identified. NO, a gas, is found to control a seemingly, limitless range of functions in animals.One assay was used to determine NaR and NiR activities of milk XO: (1) nitrite formation from nitrate by NaR, and (2) nitrite utilization by NiR. Nitrite concentrations were determined by using sulfanylamide and N-(1-naphtyl)-ethylenediamine, which form red color measured at 485 nm.These activities of the milk XO require NADH as a physiological electron donor. High XO, NaR and NiR activities are detected only after heat treatment (80\u00b0C, 5 min) of the fresh milk in the presence of molybdate. In both camel and horse milk NaR activity of XO was almost two times higher than its NiR activity. It is well known that XO can be reversibly converted from the dehydrogenase form to the oxidase through the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups. Cysteine and, to a lesser extent, glutathione increased NiR activity of milk XO but not its NaR activity. The mechanism of this increase of NiR activity remains unclear and is currently under study. Substitution of tungsten for molybdenum under above conditions gave no detectable NaR and NiR activity of milk XO. The molybdenum site-directed inhibitor, tungsten inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, nitrate and nitrite are clear to interact with Mo center of XO.Camel and horse milk are traditional drinks in Central Asia and Kazakhstan. Therefore, it is very important that XO provide a mechanism for generation of NO in camel and horse milk where nitric oxide synthase, NO producing enzyme, does not exist. P-09.04.4-128 The influence of phytomedicine on metabolic processes of white rats undergone to ionized radiation The study of Peroxide lipids oxidation (PLO) process is used as one of stability parameters of organism's changes and as a key mechanism for understanding of adaptation reactions and of pathogenesis of different diseases. It's determined by high biological activity of products which are formed in the PLO reactions, in this relation lipids with high contents of fat acids play important role. To investigate the influence of phytomedicine Eminium Regelii on the metabolic processes (Peroxide lipids oxidation) of white rats' organism in conditions of ionized radiation.The animals were exposed to ionizing radiation (gamma-radiation 60 Co) on the radiotherapeutic equipment Teragam in a dose of 6 Gy and received phytomedicine Eminium Regelii in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg orally within 14 days following the ionizing radiation exposure. Gamma-rays caused the increase of lipid peroxidation (LPO) primary (DC) and secondary products' (MDA) concentrations in spleen, liver, thymus and adrenal glands.Treatment by phytomedicine resulted in contents of DC decreased in 3 times in spleen, in 7 times in thymus, in 5 times in adrenal glands, in liver in 4 times, in lymph nodes of small intestine it in 3 times. MDA decreased in liver up to 6 and 3 times, in spleen in 3.2 times, in thymus in 9 times, in liver in 6 times, in adrenal glands in 12 time, no changes in lymph nodes of small intestine.The effect of phytomedicine treatment of organisms exposed to sublethal dozes of gamma-radiation results in the LPO primary and secondary products concentrations decrease in spleen, liver, thymus and adrenal glands. P-09.04.4-131 Evaluation of serum levels of ischemia modified albumin (IMA) in bipolar disorder patients K. \u20ac Unal 1 , C. Topc \u00dfuoglu 2 , M. Cingi 3 1 Clinic of Biochemistry, Ankara Polatli Duatepe Public Hospital, Ankara, 2 Clinic of Biochemistry, Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, 3 Clinic of Psychiatry, Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey Introduction: Bipolar disorder is one of the most debilitating psychiatric disorders characterized by disruptive episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. Considering the complex role of biological and environmental factors in the etiology of affective disorders; recent studies have focused on oxidative stress, which may damage nerve cell components and take part in pathophysiology. Aim of our study is to contribute these data about oxidative stress in bipolar disorder, by detecting Ischemia Modified Albumin (IMA) levels of bipolar disorder patients in remission and also by comparing these results with healthy controls. Methods: Study population consisted of 35 patients meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for bipolar disorder I. 36 healthy subjects were included as control group (HC). Serum Ischemia Modified Albumin (IMA) levels of all participants were determined. Results: Statistical analysis on serum Ischemia Modified Albumin (IMA) levels did not show any significant difference between bipolar disorder patients in remission and healthy controls.Conclusion: Studies on oxidative stress in bipolar disorder have reached controversial results up till now. In this study, no statistically significant difference was detected between oxidative parameters of bipolar disorder patients in remission and healthy controls. In order to evaluate oxidative stress in bipolar disorder comprehensively, further studies are needed. Keywords: Bipolar disorder, Ischemia Modified Albumin (IMA), oxidative stress P-09.04.4-133 Xanthine oxidase and adenosine deaminase activity in patients with familial mediterranean fever (FMF) Objective: FMF is an autosomal recessive dissease which is characterized by recurrent fever and inflammation of serous membranes. In this study we measured serum adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XO) levels in FMF cases. Method: Serum ADA levels were measured with a sensitive colorimetric method described by Giusti and XO levels were analysed by the method of Worthington in 30 FMF patients and 30 healthy controls. Results: There was a significant difference in XO and ADA levels between controls and cases. ADA and XO levels were higher in patents with FMF. Humic acid (HA) is a natural product which is forming during decomposition of organic matter in humus. In recent years, there are some resarches on the medical use of HA. The present study was undertaken in order to evaluate the anticancer properties of the HA using a prostate cancer and osteosarcome cell lines PC-3, SJSA1 as an in vitro model system.HA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown in petri dishes in a humidified atmosphere containing at 37\u2022C. Five different concentrations (100 ug/ml, 50 ug/ml, 25 ug/ml, 10 ug/ ml, 5 ug/ml) were prepared using a stock solution of HA. We measured cell proliferation and migration to understand of progression effects of HA in PC-3 and SJSA1 cell lines in vitro.According to our results, HA treatment caused cytotoxicity and induced cell death in vitro in PC-3 cells with an IC50 value of 67.9 lg/ml. Contrary to this, HA induced proliferation of SJSA1 cells in dose dependent manner. HA demonstrated the highest proliferatif activity against SJSA1 cells with an IC50 value of 100 > lg/ml. On the other hand, cell migration was reduced in PC-3 cell line and interestingly, migration was accelerated in SJSA1 cell line.Our study may provide new insights into the regulatory effect of HA in cancer, but further studies are needed to clarify the role of HA in cancer pathogenesis.",
