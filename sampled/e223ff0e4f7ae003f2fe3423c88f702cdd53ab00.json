Its natural abundance of almost 100% and its ubiquitous occurrence and the high mobility of water protons in living matter are further prepositions for using low-sensitivity NMR method for imaging in human subjects. This low sensitivity compared with other imaging methods-e.g., positron emission tomography-cannot be emphasized enough. The sensitivity difference of this both methods is several orders of magnitude (~10 5 -10 6 ). This fact has to be taken into account when magnetic resonance imaging is envisioned for specific probe imaging, nowadays known as molecular imaging.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Overview"}, {"text": "In spite of the abovementioned low sensitivity of MR, proton imaging is possible in humans because of the high magnetic moment, ~ 100% abundance, high concentra- tion, and high mobility of protons in tissue. The following consideration will be restricted to the hydrogen nuclei only. The basis of the magnetic resonance imaging is a simple resonance phenomenon. In a magnetic field, free environmental magnetic moments of a specimen are not oriented at all; however, in an external magnetic field the magnetic moments are no longer randomly oriented. The application of an external magnetic field B0 forces the magnetic moments \u00b5 to align along the magnetic field. Due to basic physics principles, the orientation has two quantum states with respect to the external magnetic field: first the parallel, and second the antiparallel state, both of which have different magnetic energies Em, and its energy difference being \u2206Em = \u03b3 \u00b7 \u0127 \u00b7 B0, and \u03b3, \u0127 being the gyromagnetic ratio and Planck's constant, respectively. In thermal equilibrium, both states possess different occupation numbers, with the low-energy parallel state having higher probability of occupation than does the low-energy antiparallel state, resulting in a macroscopic and therefore measurable net magnetization parallel to the orientation of the external magnetic field. This thermal equilibrium state can be distorted by irradiation with alternating electromagnetic field having a radiation energy ERF identically to the energy-splitting \u2206Em caused by the magnetic field, and the radiation energy being ERF = \u0127 \u00b7 \u03c90, and \u03c90 being the resonance frequency of the spin system-the so-called Larmor frequency. Due to the resonant irradiation, the spin system takes up additional energy that can be dissipated only if the system is coupled to its microenvironment. This coupling strength is described by the so-called T1 relaxation time (also known as longitudinal or spin-lattice relaxation time). An equivalent for the coupling of the spins to each other is the T2 relaxation time (also known as transversal or spin-spin relaxation time). For tissues, typical T1 relaxation times for tissues are between 100 and 2,000 ms and T2 relaxation times between 10 and 1,000 ms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Overview"}, {"text": "MR imaging utilizing pulsed NMR-this means the alternating electromagnetic field, the so-called radiofrequency (RF) field-is applied only for a short period of time (in general, pulses are some milliseconds). The short RF pulse excites the spin system via a transmitter coil. After irradiation of the nuclear spin system, a receiver coil can detect a damped time-dependent signal with a frequency of \u03c90. This signal is called the free induction decay (FID) . The damping of the signal is ruled by the T2 relaxation times, and the period by the strength of the external magnetic field (constant magnetic moment assumed). In practical terms, not only does the T2 relaxation time influence the damping of the signal, but also the technically related inhomogeneity of the external magnetic field. The signal damping caused by the inhomogeneity is called T2* relaxation time, and is in general much stronger than that caused by T2 relaxation times. Only special pulse sequences (e.g., spin-echo sequences) can eliminate the influence of the inhomogeneity of the external magnetic field and thus allow the measurement of the T2 relaxation times specific to the substance/tissue. The influence of T2 relaxation times is mainly limited to the amplitude of the signal.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 451, "end": 456, "text": "(FID)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Overview"}, {"text": "Preposition for the image reconstruction (Sect. 2.3) is the exact information about the MR signal's origin. This spatial information can be generated by space-dependent magnetic fields additionally applied along the three space coordinates. These space-dependent magnetic fieldscalled magnetic field gradients-are small as compared with the main external field and are generated by special coils mounted in the bore of the magnet. Due to these additional magnetic field gradients, the total magnetic field is slightly different in each volume element (voxel) and in turn, so is the resonance frequency of the spin system in each voxel. As a result, irradiation with a RF pulse of defined frequency \u03c9\u2032 excites only those nuclei in such voxels where the Larmor frequency \u03c90 given by the field strength matches the resonance condition. Suitable changes of the field gradients allow moving a volume element in space, fulfilling this condition. Keeping in mind that the signal intensity of a volume element is given by the number of the spins in the volume element, the relaxation times of the tissue and the specific measurement parameters (e.g., pulse repetition time, echo time etc.), this signal intensity is assigned to the corresponding picture element (pixel). In this manner, the region of interest can be sampled by moving the volume element through space, and successively, an image with respect to pixels can be constructed. This method requires a long time to acquire images, assuming every experiment needs about 1 s to measure a voxel and a pixel, respectively.

In contrary to X-ray contrast agents, where absorption is the dominating physical effect producing the contrast, MR contrast media are based on other principles. The paramagnetic and/or super-paramagnetic properties of the contrast media influence the relaxation times of tissue, or change contrast by obliterating the signal of protons and thus increase contrast. Whereas in X-ray the contrast is proportional to the concentration of the contrast medium, in MR the dependency on the concentration is in general much stronger than linear -most often exponential.

In MR imaging, motion, in particular flow, is often recognized as artifacts. However, these phenomena can be used to measure flow and/or represent the vascular system. Two effects are used for these kinds of measurements, the time-of-flight phenomenon (or the wash-in/wash-out effect) or the spin-phase phenomenon. In time-of-flight measurements, moving spins are excited at one location (in the vessel), and detection of the spins is performed downstream at another known location (slice). The delay time between excitation and detection can be used to calculate the flow velocity. Several modifications of the method exist (e.g., presaturation, bolus tracking), and are used depending on the setup of the measurement and sequences used. The spin-phase phenomenon can be used for angiographic imaging as well. The phase of the transverse magnetization of moving spins along a field gradient changes according to the Larmor equation. These phase-shift effects are observed for flow in all directions. The phase changes are prone to different flow parameters (e.g., velocity, turbulences, acceleration, etc.) and on the pulse sequences used. The signal variations produced by the two effects can be used to produce images of the vascular structures. Using phase-sensitive effects, magnitude subtraction is a common procedure: dephased and rephrased image are acquired sequentially and are subtracted. Using time-offlight effects, mostly maximum-intensity projection is used to construct images of the vasculature.

If the structure of tissue has a preferred direction, diffusion will no longer isotropic; the diffusion will have higher components in the preferred direction of tissue. This kind of diffusion is called anisotropic diffusion. In mathematical terms, the anisotropic diffusion can be represented by a tensor.

Whereas the parallel component exclusively contributes to T2 relaxation, the perpendicular component influences both T1 and T2 relaxation: \u2022 The field component perpendicular to the B0 field induces-in analogy to the external RF field B1(t) -transitions between the energy levels (precession cones) of an individual spin. The probability of these transitions depends on the intensity of the frequency component of the fluctuating fields that oscillates at the Larmor frequency \u03c90: the higher the spectral density J(\u03c90), the more transitions are induced.

The described relaxation process allows the excited spin system to emit and absorb photons of energy \u0127\u03c90 until the Boltzmann distribution of the energy levels is reached.

Moreover, it contributes to T2 relaxation, as the locally induced transitions between the precession cones destroy the phase coherence between those spins which form, as a spin-package, the macroscopic transverse magnetization (cf. Fig. 2.2 .12). \u2022 The component of the fluctuating field Blok(t) oriented parallel to the z-axis locally modulates the static field B0 at the position of a nucleus and thereby changes the precession frequency \u03c90 of its nuclear magnetic moment \u03bc. Since the local fluctuations seen by the nuclei are spatially uncorrelated, the precessing magnetic moments within a sample lose their phase coherence, which causes the transverse magnetization to decay (see Fig. 2.2.12) .

In SE imaging, the T1 contrast is improved by placing an inversion pulse prior to the acquisition of the Fourier line. This approach is not feasible in GRE imaging, since the inversion time would be much larger than the commonly used repetition times. In fast GRE imaging, an inversion pulse is used prior to the whole imaging sequence (Fig. 2.4.47) . That concept has been introduced as turboFLASH (snapshotFLASH (Haase et al. 1989) , fast SPGR (FSPGR) or turbo Field Echo (TFE)).

This relaxation process also takes place during data acquisition. The various measured Fourier lines will have different T1 weightings.

The application of an inversion pulse prior to a 3D acquisition scheme is not very promising, since the preparation of the longitudinal magnetization would vastly diminish during the relatively long measurement time and the significant number of low angle excitation pulses. A feasible alternative is to repeat the preparation of the longitudinal magnetization in either the partition-encoding loop, or the phase-encoding loop. Although the timesavings would be larger for placing the inversion pulse prior to the longer phase encoding loop, fortunately at the time it was only possible to place the inversion pulse prior to the partition-encoding loop. Fortunately, because the previously described turboFLASH-artifact based on the overand under-representation of k-space lines is now omitted. The phase-encoding gradient is prepared; the inversion pulse is set followed by a rapid execution of the partitionencoding loop, during which the amount of longitudinal magnetization will change according to the course of the T1 relaxation (recovery influenced by the low-angle excitation pulses). After this, the next phase-encoding line is prepared, the inversion pulse set, and again the whole partition loop executed. The amount of signal within each partition is identical for all phase-encoding steps and the k-space is again symmetric, resulting in artifact-free images. This technique has been introduced as magnetization prepared rapid acquired gradient-echoes (MP-RAGE, Mulger and Brookeman 1990) (Fig. 2.4 .48).

The sequence had some promise to replace the conventional T1-weighted spin-echo imaging of the brain, since it allows the gapless coverage of the whole brain in less than 6 min. But, it is a gradient-echo sequence. Susceptibility gradients especially at the base of the skull will cause geometric distorted representation of the anatomy or even signal voids.

The choice of an individual magnet type is determined by the requirements on the magnetic field. Important characteristics are the field strength B0, spatial field homogeneity, temporal field stability, patient accessibility, as well as construction and servicing costs. As outlined in Sect. 2.2 a high magnetic induction is desirable as the MR signal S is approximately proportional to B0\u00b2, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases approximately linearly with B0. It is thus expected that with increasing field strength the measurement time can be substantially decreased. The field strength is limited however for the following reasons: \u2022 For tissues in typical magnetic fields of 0.5 T and higher, the longitudinal relaxation time T1 increases with field strength. If the same pulse sequence with identical measurement parameters (TR, TE, etc.) would be used at low field and high field, the T1 contrast would be less pronounced in the high-field image, since image contrast typically depends on the ratio of TR over T1. To achieve a similar T1 contrast with a conventional SE or GRE pulse sequence, TR (and thus the total measurement time) needs to be increased. \u2022 The resonance frequency \u03c90 increases linearly with field strength according to \u03c90 = \u03b3 B0. At higher frequencies the wavelength of the RF waves are of the order of or even smaller than the dimensions of the objects to be imaged. Under these circumstances, standing waves can be created in the human body, which manifests in areas of higher RF fields (hot spots) and neighboring areas of reduced RF intensity. These unwanted RF inhomogeneities are difficult to control, as they are dependent on the geometry and the electric properties of the imaged object. \u2022 The power that is deposited in the tissue during RF excitation rises quadratically with \u03c90 (and thus with B0). To ensure patient safety at all times during the imaging procedure the specific absorption rate (SAR), i.e., the amount of RF power deposited per kilogram of body weight, is monitored and limited by the MR system. With increasing field strength, the RF power generated by a pulse sequence increases, and thus the flip angle needs to be lowered to stay within the guidelines of SAR monitoring. Since most pulse sequences require certain flip angles (e.g., a 90-180\u00b0 pulse pair for an SE), the RF pulses need to be lengthened at higher field strength to reduce the RF power per pulse. Additionally, the time-averaged power can be lowered by increasing the TR. \u2022 At field strengths above 1 T, only superconducting magnets are used for whole-body imaging systems. These magnets become very heavy and expensive. A typical 1.5-T MR magnet weighs about 6 t, whereas a 3-T magnet already has a weight of about 12 t. Shielding of the stray fields, which is, e.g., necessary to avoid (1) that is filled with liquid helium. The cryotank also houses the primary magnet coils (4) together with the shielding coils (2) that create the magnetic field. The cryotank is embedded in a vacuum tank (3). In a separate tubular structure in the magnet bore, the gradient coil (5) and the RF body coil (6) are mounted. An MR measurement is initiated by the user from the host computer. The timing of the sequence is monitored by the hardware computer, which controls (among others) the RF transmitter, RF receiver, and the gradient system. During the measurement, the RF pulses generated by the transmitter are applied (typically) via the integrated body coil, whereas signal reception is done with multiple receive coils. The digitized MR signals are reconstructed at the image-reconstruction computer, which finally sends the image data to the host for further post-processing and storage interference with cardiac pacemakers, becomes increasingly difficult. \u2022 The absolute differences in resonance frequency between chemical substances increase with field strength. This effect is beneficial for high-resolution spectroscopy, as high field strengths allow separating the individual resonance lines. During imaging, however, a substantially increased chemical shift artifact (i.e., a geometric shift of the fatty tissues versus the water-containing tissues) is seen, which can only be compensated using higher readout bandwidths. \u2022 Differences in magnetic susceptibility between neighboring tissues create a static field gradient at the tissue boundaries. The strength of these unwanted intrinsic field gradients scales with B0. Therefore, increasingly higher imaging gradients are required at higher field strength to encode the imaging signal without geometric distortion; however, gradient strengths are technically limited. On the other hand, in neurofunctional MRI (fMRI) the increased sensitivity at higher field strengths is utilized to visualize those brain areas where local susceptibility differences in the blood are modulated during task performance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 165, "text": "(Oppelt 2005;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 166, "end": 188, "text": "Vlaardingerbroek 2002;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 189, "end": 199, "text": "Chen 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Magnet"}, {"text": "In the clinical environment, magnetic field strengths between 0.2 and 3 T are common.

The maximum gradient strength is limited by the capabilities of the power supply of the gradient system-modern gradient systems use power supplies that can deliver voltages up to 2,000 V and currents up to 500 A. Another limiting factor for Gmax is gradient heating: With increasing current through the gradient coil, the windings heat up to levels at which the gradient could be destroyed. Therefore, to remove the heat from the gradient tube, pipes are integrated in the gradient coils for water-cooling.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gradients"}, {"text": "The maximum slew rate smax is the ratio of Gmax over the shortest time required to switch on the gradient (rise time). When the current in the gradient coil is increased during gradient switching, according to Lenz's law the coil will produce a current, which opposes the change. Thus, it counteracts the switching process, and the rise time cannot be made infinitely short. During MR imaging, however, it is desirable to have very short rise times (i.e., high slew rates), as these times only prolong the imaging process. Clinical MRI systems have slew rates between 10 mT/m/ms and 200 mT/m/ms. If the gradient coil is connected to a capacitance via a fast switch, very short rise times can be achieved, as the inductance of the gradient coil and the capacitance form a resonance circuit. Such a resonant gradient system has the disadvantage that the characteristic frequency of the resonance circuit determines the possible rise times. Additionally, gradients can only be switched on after the capacitances have been charged. Resonant gradient systems have nevertheless been successfully applied to EPI studies, in which the sinusoidal gradient waveforms are beneficial, and multistage resonant systems have been utilized to approximate the trapezoidal gradient waveforms (Harvey 1994) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1274, "end": 1287, "text": "(Harvey 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gradients"}, {"text": "When the gradient is switched on, the maximal rate of field change is observed at the ends of the gradient coil (i.e., FOVmax/2): dB/dt = smax FOVmax/2.

To avoid these parasitic currents (eddy currents) in the cryostat, which in turn create magnetic fields counteracting the gradients, often a second outer gradient structure is integrated in the gradient tube. The inner and outer gradient coils are designed so that their combined gradient field vanishes everywhere outside the gradient coil, whereas the desired gradient amplitudes are realized on the inside.

Such a system can be used, e.g., to rapidly image the beat-ing heart with the small coil, or to acquire image data from the surrounding anatomy at lower frame rates. When the gradient system is mounted in the MR magnet, strong mechanical forces act on the gradient tube, which are proportional to the gradient current. These forces are generated by the interaction of the gradient field with the static magnetic field and thus increase with B0. The permanent gradient switching creates time-varying forces that lead to acoustic noise. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce noise generation, which in some cases can exceed dangerous sound pressure levels of 110 dB. The wire paths in the coil can be designed in such a way that the forces are locally balanced, the gradient tube can be mechanically stabilized, the gradients can be integrated in a vacuum chamber to prevent sound propagation in air, or the gradient system can be mounted externally to reduce acoustic coupling to the cryostat (Pianissimo gradient, Toshiba).

Unlike MR angiography, which depicts the blood flow within larger vessels, perfusion-weighted MR techniques are sensitive to perfusion on the level of the capillaries. The technique is based on the intravenous injection of a T2*-relaxing contrast agent and subsequent bolus tracking using a fast susceptibility-weighted imaging sequence. After converting voxel signal into concentration values, parametric maps of regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and blood flow (rCBF) can be calculated by unfolding tissue concentration curves and the concentration curve of the feeding artery. The contrast agents used for dynamic susceptibility-weighted MR perfusion are usually standard Gd chelates; however, the dosages of Gd per kilogram of body weight as well as the value of higher concentrated agents have been widely discussed. During the first pass of the Gd chelate, the high intravascular concentration of Gd causes the T2* effects, which can be measured by rapid imaging techniques. The length and the peak concentration of the bolus seem to have influence on the resulting measured signal with a highly concentrated small bolus of contrast agent being advantageous for MR brain perfusion imaging (Essig et al. 2002; Heiland et al. 2001) . In between the standard Gd chelates, no notably different behavior of the available agents has been published up to now. The recommended dose for DSC perfusion MRI is in the range of 0.15-0.30 mmol/kg body weight, with most authors preferring a value of 0.2, because the volume of the bolus gets too high when higher dosages are applied (Bruening et al. 2000) . Therefore, the use of higher concentrated contrast agents or agents with higher relaxivity are also interesting for cerebral perfusion MRI. Again, studies were able to demonstrate the value of the 1 M gabobutrol and gadopentate dimeglumine. Tombach et al. (2003) showed that 1 M gadobutrol resulted in a significantly improved quality of the perfusion examination in comparison to 0.5 M gadobutrol at the same dosage of 0.3 mmol/kg body weight. The results were explained by the sharper, more concentrated bolus, which could be achieved due to the smaller injection volume. Essig et al. directly compared 1 M gadobutrol and 0.5 M gadopentate dimeglumine at 1.5 T with a similar dosage of 0.1 mmol/ kg body weight and found no significant differences between the two agents (Essig 2006) . The benefit of a double dose of 0.2 mmol was observed only as a trend; however, it was not considered to be of clinical relevance. Similar results in a comparison between the two agents were recently obtained also on a 3-T system (Thilmann et al. 2005) . For both agents sufficient high-quality perfusion examinations can be achieved with an acceptable injection volume, which is helpful for their clinical application in daily practice and can be considered superior to standard Gd chelates (Essig et al. 2004; Thiman et al. 2005; Tombach et al. 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 196, "end": 217, "text": "(Parsons et al. 2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 280, "end": 299, "text": "(Essig et al. 2004)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 334, "end": 354, "text": "(Bozzao et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1575, "text": "(Essig et al. 2002;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1576, "end": 1596, "text": "Heiland et al. 2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1936, "end": 1958, "text": "(Bruening et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2217, "end": 2223, "text": "(2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2734, "end": 2746, "text": "(Essig 2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2979, "end": 3001, "text": "(Thilmann et al. 2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3241, "end": 3260, "text": "(Essig et al. 2004;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3261, "end": 3280, "text": "Thiman et al. 2005;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3281, "end": 3301, "text": "Tombach et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Contrast Agents in Neuroimaging"}, {"text": "In a limited number of proof-of-concept studies, USPIO were also used in neuroimaging (Corot et al. 2004; Manniger et al. 2005) .

Better delineation of arterial morphology was reported especially for small vessels, but no statistically significant difference in image quality could be seen. Two different options for injection have been described: reduction of the injection rate by 50% compared to injection protocols using 0.5 M ECF (equimolar dosing) or reduction of the injection time by 50%. The equimolar dosing mainly exploits the higher relaxivity potential of gadobutrol. In this case, the injection duration is identical to a corresponding protocol using a 0.5M contrast agent a similar bolus geometry, and contrast delivery in the ROI is obtained (e.g., in a 70-kg-weighing patient 7 ml of gadobutrol are injected at 1 ml/s compared with 14 ml of gadopentetate dimeglumine injected Fig. 2.6.1 Whole-body MRA of a healthy volunteer after bolus injection of gadofosveset (0.025 mmol/kg body weight).

Steady-state imaging shows an enhancement of both arteries and veins. Due to the higher concentration of the contrast agent during first-pass imaging the absolute level of enhancement is higher (a) at 2 ml/s). Hence, well-known protocols can be adopted with good results. The second option keeps the injection speed unchanged in comparison to the 0.5 M agent protocol, resulting in shortening of the initial bolus duration by a factor of two (Fink et al. 2004 ). The philosophy is to use a very compact, high-relaxivity bolus and to fully exploit the potential of 1 M gadobutrol. This approach is particularly recommended in conjunction with very fast acquisition techniques, e.g., time-resolved (often referred to as 4D) MRA.

The longer acquisition period can be used to decrease voxel size, to repeat measurements, or to trigger acquisitions by ECG and/or respiratory gating. The second limitation of currently used MRA is the quantification of artery stenoses, which still seems to be inferior to invasive catheter angiography.

The amount of angiogenesis and contrast agent extravasation is considered different for several benign and malignant lesions; however, the visible phenomenon of different enhancement is usually too small to be analyzed only visually. The discrete changes of contrast-agent enhancement are usually evaluated by using a semiquantitative evaluation with region-of-interest measurements at different time-points (Kuhl et al. 2005) . The thereby achieved enhancement kinetics, as represented by the time-signal intensity curves, differ significantly for benign and malignant enhancing lesions, and are used as an aid in differential diagnosis.

Therefore, the experimental studies mainly focus on contrast agents which show no or only minor physiological extravasation. Different studies-mainly in the animal-experimental stage-were able to show that characterization in benign and malignant tumors, evaluation of angiogenesis, and even tumor grading is feasible with blood-pool contrast agents (Daldrup et al. 1998; Kobayashi et al. 2001; Preda et al. 2004a, b) .

Thus, the use of an intravascular contrast agent may be particularly convenient due to the T1 relaxation time reduction in blood. The application of ECF agents has proven to be most effective for breath-hold acquisitions. However, the concentration of ECF agents declines rapidly as they extravasate into the interstitial space, thereby reducing the contrast between blood and myocardium. Newly developed strategies use high-resolution free-breathing MR sequences for coronary MRA. In this situation, ECF agents are less beneficial due to the relatively long acquisition time of these free breathing 3D sequences. This problem can be solved by the use of intravascular contrast agents. An additional benefit from application of a blood-pool agent is a longer acquisition window, which may be used to further increase both the signal-to-noise ratio and/or image resolution (Nassenstein et al. 2006) .

Therefore, a slice-selective RF excitation is applied in a (typically parallel) saturation slice, so that the magnetization of the inflowing blood is significantly reduced.

This motion depends on the size, the temperature, and in particular on the microscopic environment of the examined molecules. Diffusion measurements can therefore be used to derive information about the microstructure of tissue. In MRI, stochastic molecular motion can be observed as signal attenuation. This was first recognized in the NMR spin-echo experiment by E.L. Hahn in 1950 (Hahn 1950 , long before the invention of actual magnetic resonance imaging. A number of more sophisticated experiments were described in following years that allowed the quantitative measurement of the diffusion coefficient (Carr and Purcell 1954; Torrey 1956; Woessner 1961) . Of particular importance is the pulsed-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) technique proposed by Stejskal and Tanner in 1965 (Stejskal and Tanner 1965) that is described in detail in Sect. 2.8.3.1. Diffusion as an imaging-contrast mechanism was first incorporated in MRI pulse sequences in 1985 (Taylor and Bushell 1985; Merboldt et al. 1985 ) and applied in vivo in 1986 (LeBihan et al. 1986 ). Its great potential for clinical MRI became evident in around 1990, when diffusionweighted images were recognized to be extremely valuable for the early detection of stroke (Moseley et al. 1990a,b; Chien et al. 1990 Chien et al. , 1992 . Areas of focal cerebral ischemia appear hyperintense in diffusion-weighted images only minutes after the onset of symptoms (see also Chap. 3, Sect. 3.4) . Having thus been pushed into publicity, diffusion-weighted imaging was evaluated in many other applications such as the characterization of brain tumors (Tien et al. 1994; Sugahara et al. 1999; Okamoto et al. 2000) and of multiple sclerosis lesions (Cercignani et al. 2000; Filippi and Inglese 2001) , but none of these reached the clinical significance of stroke diagnosis. Mainly due to limitations of image quality, there are considerably fewer publications about diffusion-weighted imaging outside the central nervous system.

Since diffusion is a stochastic process, the diffusion distance after the time t is not the same for all molecules but is described by a Gaussian probability distribution as illustrated in Fig. 2.8.2 . As shown in this illustration, after a diffusion time t most molecules are still found at or close to their original position; the diffusion distance s, corresponds to the standard deviation of the shown distributions.

Due to additional collisions with these obstacles, the mean diffusion distance of water molecules in tissue is reduced compared to that of free water, and a decreased effective diffusion coefficient is found in tissue called the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).

Such an arrow can be mathematically described by three independent numbers: either by its length and two angles defining its orientation or by three coordinates (x-, y-, and z-component of the vector).

These data sets are used to calculate a single image corresponding to a fully sampled k-space during post-processing. Reducing the number of phase-encode steps shortens the EPI echo train, decreases the minimum echo time as well as the total acquisition time, and increases the effective receiver bandwidth in the phase-encode direction.

Pulse sequences known as CE-FAST or PSIF sequences (the acronym PSIF refers to a reverted fast imaging with steady precession, i.e., FISP, sequence) have been adopted to diffusion-weighted imaging by inserting a single diffusion gradient (LeBihan 1988; Merboldt et al. 1989) . However, in contrast to all previously described sequences, the diffusion weighting of this technique cannot be easily determined quantitatively. The observed signal attenuation does not only depend on the diffusion coefficient and the diffusion weighting, but also on the relaxation times, T1 and T2, and the flip angle (Buxton 1993) . Since these quantities are usually not exactly known, the ADC cannot be determined. Instead, these sequences have been used to acquire diffusion-weighted images that are evaluated based only on visible image contrast. A general advantage of diffusion-weighted PSIF sequences is the relatively short acquisition time due to short repetition times of about 50 ms. Thus, they exhibit only low motion sensitivity. The most important application of this sequence type is the differential diagnosis of osteoporotic and malignant vertebral compression fractures (Baur et al. 1998 (Baur et al. , 2003 .

By introducing diffusion gradients, the pulse sequence is made sensitive to molecular motion in the micrometer range, but it also becomes susceptible to very small macroscopic motions of the imaged object since the diffusion gradients do not distinguish between stochastic molecular motion and macroscopic bulk motion. Hence, even very small and involuntary movements of the patient, e.g., caused by cardiac motion, cerebrospinal fluid pulsation, breathing, swallowing, or peristalsis, can lead to severe image degradation due to gross motion artifacts. Typical appearances of these artifacts are signal voids and ghosting in phase-encode direction. Several techniques and pulse-sequence modifications have been proposed to reduce the motion sensitivity of diffusion-weighted MRI. On the one hand, any kind of motion should be minimized. Depending on the body region being imaged, this can be achieved by improved fixation of the patient to the scanner, by imaging during breath hold, or by applying cardiac gating. Effects of motion can also be reduced by decreasing the acquisition time of a pulse sequence, i.e., by using fast acquisition techniques. This is particularly effective if singleshot sequences such as echo planar imaging techniques are applied. Most motion artifacts in diffusion-weighted imaging arise from inconsistent phase information in the complex-valued raw data set. This is caused by different states of motion in the repeated diffusion preparations of the acquisition. In single-shot sequences, only a single diffusion preparation is applied, and thus inconsistent phase information is avoided. It should be noted, however, that even single-shot sequences might be affected by inconsistent phase information if complex data of several measurements is averaged.

The navigator echo is an additional echo without phase encoding acquired after each diffusion preparation. In the absence of motion, all navigator echoes should be identical. Thus, by comparing the acquired navigator echoes, bulk motion can be detected, and degraded image echoes can be discarded or a phase correction can be applied. More advanced navigator-echo techniques acquire several navigator echoes in different spatial directions (Butts et al. 1996) or use spiral navigator readouts (Miller and Pauly 2003) . Certain pulse sequences are self-navigated, i.e., a subset of the acquired raw data can be used as navigator echo without the need for an extra navigator acquisition. Examples are pulse sequences with radial or spiral k-space trajectories that acquire the origin of k-space in every readout (Seifert et al. 2001; Dietrich et al. 2001b ).

Eddy currents are induced electric currents in coils that occur after switching magnetic fields on or off. These currents then create unwanted additional gradient fields resulting in shifted or distorted images and in incorrect diffusion weightings. Whereas most MRI gradient systems compensate very well for eddy current effects after the switching of short gradients typically used for imaging, the longer diffusion gradients are often not well compensated. Hence, diffusion-weighted images are sometimes distorted depending on the diffusion weighting and the direction of the diffusion gradients, resulting in artifacts on ADC maps such as enhanced edges. To avoid these artifacts, several techniques have been suggested. Diffusion gradients can be shortened by using bipolar diffusion gradients (Alexander et al. 1997) or by adding additional 180\u00b0 pulses during the diffusion preparation (Reese et al. 2003) ; eddy currents can be partially compensated for by an additional long gradient before the 90\u00b0 excitation pulse (Alexander et al. 1997) ; or diffusion-weighted images can be acquired twice with diffusion gradients of opposite polarity (Bodammer et al. 2004) .

Molecular motion perpendicular to this direction does not contribute to the signal attenuation. In general, the diffusion displacement of spins depends on the considered spatial direction; e.g., protons of water molecules in nerve fibers move more freely parallel to the fiber direction than they do in perpendicular directions. This dependence of the diffusion on spatial orientation can be measured by applying diffusion gradients in different spatial directions, e.g., separately in slice, readout, and phase direction as demonstrated in Fig. 2.8.11 . The resulting diffusion-weighted images show substantial signal differences in areas with strong anisotropic diffusion such as the corpus callosum. The signal intensity of the corpus callosum is decreased if diffusion gradients in the left-right direction (readout direction in the example) are applied, but increased for diffusion gradients in the head-foot (slice) direction or the anterior-posterior (phase-encode) direction. This finding is explained by the fact that water molecules diffuse more freely in the left-right direction (parallel to the nerve fibers) than they do in perpendicular directions, i.e., the effective diffusion coefficient is greater in the left-right direction than it is in other directions, and thus the signal attenuation is increased. This orientation dependence is visible in the ADC maps as well: the ADC in the left-right direction of the corpus callosum is increased compared to the ADCs in perpendicular directions.

Because no ionizing radiation is used in MRI, it is generally deemed safer than diagnostic X-ray or nuclear medicine procedures in terms of health protection of patients. In this context, a fundamental difference between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation has to be noted: radiation exposure to ionizing radiation-at least at the relatively low doses occurring in medical imaging-results in stochastic effects, whereas biological effects of (electro)magnetic fields are deterministic. A stochastic process is one where the exposure determines the probability of the occurrence of an event but not the magnitude of the effect. In contrast, deterministic effects are those for which the magnitude is related to the level of exposure and a threshold may be defined (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection [ICNIRP] 2002).

The data, which are listed and reviewed by Reilly (1998) , reveal that magnetic stimulation is most effective, when it is delivered during the T wave of the cardiac cycle. Moreover, excitation thresholds for the heart are substantially greater than that for nerve as long as the pulse duration is sufficiently less than the chronaxie time of the heart of about 3 ms. Therefore, the avoidance of peripheral sensations in a patient provides a conservative safety margin with respect to cardiac stimulation. Bourland et al. (1991) determined a mean value of 14.1 \u00b1 6.7 for the ratio of cardiac (the induction of ectopic beats) to muscle stimulation in dogs for a pulse duration of 530 \u00b5s, which is quite close to the theoretical heart/nerve ratio of 14.0 estimated by Reilly (1998) . Various studies yielded that the cardiac threshold variability of healthy persons is surprisingly low, which is confirmed by experimental and clinical experience that pacing thresholds are rather uniform (Schmitt et al. 1998 ). Drugs and changes in electrolyte concentrations can lower thresholds, but not below about 80% of the normal value (Schmitt et al. 1998 ). Peripheral nerve stimulation has been investigated in various volunteer studies. A systematic evaluation of the available data was presented by Schaefer et al. in 2000 . They recalculated published threshold levels-often reported for different gradient coils and shapes in different terms-to the maximum dB/dt occurring during the maximum switch rate of the gradient coil at a radius of 20 cm from the central axis of the MR system, i.e., at the border of the volume normally accessible to patients. In Fig. 2.9 .6, the recalculated threshold levels are plotted for the y- (anterior/posterior) and z-gradient coils (superior/inferior) as compared to model estimates by Reilly. As expected, y-gradient coils have lower stimulation threshold for a given ramp time than x-gradient coils since the x-z cross-sections of the body are usually larger than are x-y cross-sections. By fitting the hyperbolic strength-duration relationship defined in Eq. 2.9.6 to mean peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds measured by Bourland et al. (1999) in 84 human subjects, Schaefer et al. estimated the following values for the rheobase/chronaxie: 22.1 T/s/0.365 ms for the y-gradient and 31.7 T/s /0.378 ms for the z-gradient. As shown in Fig. 2.9 .6, the dB/dt intensity to induce a sensation that the subject described as uncomfortable or even painful was significantly above the sensation threshold. Bourland et al. (1999) also analyzed their stimulation data in the form of cumulative frequency distributions, that gives for a dB/dt level the number of subjects that had already reported on perceptible, uncomfortable, or even intolerable sensations. They found that the dB/dt level needed for the lowest percentile for uncomfortable stimulation is approximately equal to the median threshold for perception.

The most relevant quantity for the characterization of physiological effects related to RF exposure is the temperature rise in the various body tissues, which is not only dependent on the localized SAR and the duration of exposure, but also on the thermal conductivity and microvascular blood flow (perfusion). In case of a partial-body RF exposure, the latter two factors lead to fast temperature equalization within the body (Adair 1996) . Based on the bioheat equation, it can be shown (Brix et al. 2002) that for this particular exposure scenario the temperature response in the center of a homogenous tissue region, which is larger in each direction than the so-called thermal equilibration length, \u03bb, is given by a convolution of the exposure-time course, SAR(t), with a tissue-specific system function, exp (-t/\u03c4), (2.9.10) where \u03c4 is the thermal equilibration time, Ta the constant temperature of arterial blood, and c the specific heat capacity of the tissue. For representative tissues, equilibration lengths and times are between 1.5 and 12 mm and 0.2 and 25 min, respectively (Brix et al. 2002) . Both parameters are inversely related to tissue perfusion and thus vary considerably. In case of a continuous RF exposure, the temperature rise even in poorly perfused tissues is less than 0.5\u00b0C for each W/kg of power dissipated. Using a simple model of power deposition in the head, Athey (1989) showed that continuous RF exposure over 1 h is unlikely to raise the temperature of the eye by more than 1.6\u00b0C when the average SAR to the head is less than 3.2 W/kg. More complex computations were performed by Gandhi and Chen (1999) for a high-resolution model of the human body using the finite-difference time domain in order to assess SAR distributions in the body for different RF coils.

Furthermore, patients with certain implants that have relatively strong ferromagnetic qualities may safely undergo MR procedures when the object is held in place by sufficient retentive forces, is not located near vital structures, and will not heat excessively (Shellock and Sawyer-Glover 2001) . However, such examinations should be restricted to essential cases and should be performed at MR systems with a low magnetic field strength.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 744, "end": 759, "text": "Shellock (2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF247"}, {"start": 951, "end": 984, "text": "(Shellock and Sawyer-Glover 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF248"}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1282, "text": "(Shellock and Sawyer-Glover 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF248"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Special Safety Issues, Contraindications"}, {"text": "Examinations of patients with active implants or lifesupport systems are strictly contraindicated at conventional MR systems, if the patient implant card does not explicitly state their safety in the MR environment.
