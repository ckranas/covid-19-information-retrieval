Progesterone acts via the sperm-specific, pH-sensitive CatSper Ca 2+ (Calcium) channel that control intracellular Ca 2+ concentration and thereby swimming behavior of sperm 3 . In human sperm, CatSper is directly activated by progesterone and prostaglandins, which stimulate a rapid Ca 2+ increase and motility response. It has recently been demonstrated that endocrine disrupting chemicals activate CatSper channels and evoke motility response and acrosomal exocytosis in human sperm.

Once infected, dogs can develop canine leishmaniasis (CanL); infected humans can develop visceral (VL) and/or cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Molecular tests (mainly PCR) have high accuracy in the diagnosis of CanL. However, the options that are currently available are technically demanding, and the reagents require a cold chain, limiting their use in peripheral settings. In addition to this, and because most of the current PCR protocols are designed in-house, their standardisation across laboratories is challenging.

Targeting the highly abundant 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules increase the sensitivity of molecular detection of bacteria in blood. However, there is no standardized protocol for field applicable blood collection for subsequent RNA analysis. The PAXgene Blood collection system (PreAnalytix) is currently used for storing up to 2.5 ml blood at -80\u00b0C for subsequent human RNA analysis, but has never been applied to bacteria. Aim Our aim was to investigate the efficiency and biosafety of storing Salmonella cells in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes and to develop a Salmonella specific 16S rRNA reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for the detection of Salmonella stored in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes.",

These types of parasite infections are frequent in underdeveloped countries as consequence of the climatic, economic and social conditions suitable for the prevalence of these type of pathogens. The warm and humid weather as well as annual cycle of rain have permitted the multiplication of the vectors; however, the lack of diagnostic has allowed the dissemination and persistence of this type of illness. So the use of extracellular vesicles as exosomes in these type of illness could be an handful tool in the prediction, diagnostic and tracing, due to their principle role in cellular communication and exchange of genetic material, Thus, the release of these vesicles from these eukaryotic pathogens is a process that can be produce in every stage of their life cycle that can be recognized by the hosting cell for the activation of the immune system.",

It is then possible that the current dosing regimen of 40 mg/kg may provide suboptimal concentrations in low-weight patients such as children, due to smaller total amounts of drug administered, and consequently results in lower cure rates as already shown in some clinical studies. Therefore, we propose that the selection of paediatric doses for PZQ should not be based on a standard PK approach but rather on efficacy. Among more than 190 healthy subjects tested in our Pf IBSM studies with NCEs and approved antimalarials, 8 participants showed ALT/AST elevations of up to 10 x ULN. These cases were reported in four distinct studies with three NCEs that were not identified as hepatotoxic in the initial Phase 1 studies. A liver safety review of 16 Pf IBSM studies (14 completed and 2 ongoing with 5 approved antimalarials and 7 NCEs) and 44 published sporozoite challenge studies was performed. For sporozoite CHMIs, moderate/severe LFT elevations were also reported in a mosquito-bite study with a NCE (pafuramidine) in 6/19 subjects (4 active/2 placebo). Most of these subjects (including placebo) received paracetamol with a highest cumulative dose of 17.5 g. ALT elevations were generally higher than AST. For IBSM studies, only one subject showed bilirubin > 2xULN (potential Hy 0 s law reported as serious adverse event).",

Because these laboratory findings are not uncommon, specific safety provisions for the conduct of CHMI studies with NCEs during drug development are proposed.

Extracts of Schistosoma (S.) haematobium include estrogen-like metabolites termed catechol-estrogens that down regulate estrogen receptors alpha and beta in estrogen responsive cells. In addition, schistosome derived catechol-estrogens induce genotoxicity that result in estrogen-DNA adducts and cause hormonal imbalance.

In the Mediterranean area, sand flies of the species P. perniciosus are considered to be the principle vector of L. infantum. When an infectious sand fly bites a host, sand fly saliva is injected into the host skin where it elicits a humoral immune response. By using salivary proteins in antibodydetection assays, host exposure to P. perniciosus can be determined. Previously, rSP03B salivary protein was proposed as a universal exposure marker for P. perniciosus across regions where CanL is endemic. In this study, a prototype of an immunochromatographic test (ICT) with rSP03B as antigen is being presented. The use of an ICT to detect host exposure to P. perniciosus is a new tool that will facilitate and speed up the screening process of sera samples in large-scale epidemiological studies, hence more sera samples can be tested and a rapid indication of vector presence is given.

The mouthparts, salivary glands and mid-guts were microscopically examined for the presence and identification of trypanosomes according to the distinct differential morphology. Conclusion This study shows the importance that these pathogens could have in the food chain in Ecuador. Reports in the region show different rates of S. Infantis and C. coli in broiler farms which could be attributed to differences in environmental conditions and specific risk factors for flock contamination. High resistance rates of the 3 bacteria could be linked to the common usage of antibiotics in poultry production. Bacterial genetic types common to different farms indicate the possibility of cross contamination between farms. This evidence suggests that a stricter biosecurity should be put in place to control these microorganisms in the primary sector. Our data shows that Ecuadorian poultry production is an important hotspot of antimicrobial resistances. This novel study in Ecuador gives insights on the epidemiology of these bacteria that will be used by policy makers and researches in the future 1,2 .",

Introduction: Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the bacterial genus Brucella. The bacteria are transmitted from animals to humans by ingestion through infected food products, direct contact with an infected animal, or inhalation of aerosols. The disease is an old one that has been known by various names, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, gastric remittent fever, and undulant fever. Humans are accidental hosts, but brucellosis continues to be a major public health concern worldwide and is the most common zoonotic infection. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Durood city, Lorstan province, to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with human brucellosis (2014). A questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics and human brucellosis related risk factors.",

With cellular automata (CA) simulation, epidemic models can be combined with time series of geo-referenced data, to produce more fine-tuned predictions and to derive further insights on risk factors. Also, CA simulation performance scales well with both CPU and General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) parallelism, thus enabling fast simulations.",

Longipalpis, are eclectic in their blood-feeding habits, and readily bite a wide range of peridomestic hosts, but also exhibit complex aggregation dynamics in association with hosts (lekking).

Introduction While Schistosoma mansoni was the dominant parasite at the onset of the Senegalese epidemic in the early nineties, the urinary species, S. haematobium, was mostly absent. Nowadays this pattern is almost completely reversed. In addition, recent molecular analyses revealed that Senegalese children were infected with hybrid crosses between S. haematobium and S. bovis, the latter being a livestock parasite. This species uses a different freshwater snail host to complete its life cycle. However, nearly nothing is known about the distribution of this snail host and whether it can act as an intermediate host of the hybrid crosses. ",

So far, none of the tested specimens appeared infected with the hybrid species, suggesting that B. globosus is the most important host in the transmission of human schistosomiasis. A detailed comparison between host and parasite distribution will be made in order to better understand the driving factors behind schistosomiasis epidemiology. The Ebola Response Consortium (ERC) rapidly implemented, during the EVD West Africa Outbreak 2014-2015, an ongoing national IPC program in PHC facilities in Sierra Leone. The International Rescue Committee (IRC), the organization leading the ERC, carried out participatory research including a daylong workshop where IPC challenges identified in baseline data collection were discussed in order to develop improvement plans. Preand post-workshop data collection on adherence to IPC measures included observation and in-depth interviews. Biosafety challenges, e.g. lack of glove changing between patients and poor handwashing habits, were identified during observations and interviews explored the acceptance of IPC measures and beliefs regarding infection.",

Introduction Chronic Chagas' heart disease (CCHD) is a dilated cardiomyopathy with chronic inflammation, usually in low intensity, but incessantly, that causes progressive tissue destruction and extensive fibrosis in the heart. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-c and TNF-a, anti-inflammatory such as IL-10 and IL-17 have a fundamental role in the immunopathogenesis of Chagas heart disease and its evolution. Interleukin 17 (IL-17) has been linked to the pathogenesis of several inflammatory activity, tumor, parasitic diseases and autoimmune diseases.

A high prevalence of epilepsy was observed in health areas in the 3 provinces: 6.8-8.5% in Bas-Uele, 0.8-7.4% in Tshopo and 3.6-6.2% in Ituri. Median age of epilepsy onset was 9 years. Different species of anthropophilic blackflies belonging to a vector complex were identified: Simulium damnosum in the Bas-Uele, S. damnosum and Simulium neavei in the Tshopo province. In the Logo health zone in Ituri, on the Lendu plateau west of Lake Albert, despite active searching we were unable to identify the vector. S. vorax larvae were found in rivers but no flies were collected actively biting humans. The Lendu plateau is historically a S. damnosum focus but the Albert lake shore of Uganda was a S. neavei focus. It may be that deforestation lead to the disappearance of the Albert lake onchocerciasis focus, and that seasonality plays a crucial role in the maintenance of Simulium populations. In Logo health zone 55.9% of persons with epilepsy had Onchocerca volvulus positive skin snips but an OV16 serosurvey among children 8-9 years old showed a prevalence of 7.8%, suggesting that there is currently limited transmission of onchocerciasis.",

            "text": "Conclusions The prevalence of epilepsy in onchocerciasis endemic regions in the DRC was 2-10 times higher than in most non-onchocerciasis endemic regions in Africa. Different species of blackflies are responsible for onchocerciasis transmission in the DRC. In Logo health zone the vector transmitting onchocerciasis remains to be determined. It is becoming increasingly clear that the propensity to develop allergies is determined not only by environmental but also by maternal factors to which the unborn is exposed in utero. Such factors include helminthic infections where an inverse correlation between infection and allergies is observed in people living in endemic countries. In this context, we previously demonstrated that experimental maternal infection with the tropical parasite Schistosoma mansoni during pregnancy leads to suppressed allergic airway inflammation in offspring. The underlying mechanisms were partly attributed to the inflammatory environment and cytokines such as IFN-g which were observed systemically as well as within the fetomaternal interface. Here, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) acts as an essential anti-inflammatory gatekeeper to ensure the maintenance of healthy pregnancy. Interestingly, during infection, we found the VDR to be strongly downregulated. Whether this observation is cause or consequence of the pro-inflammatory environment instigated by the systemic immune response towards the helminth is still unclear. To investigate whether maternal helminth infection in humans elicits similar effects at the fetomaternal interface, i.e. whether maternal inflammation is correlated with placental VDR downregulation, we initiated a pilot study. We compared inflammatory and antiinflammatory placental gene expression between healthy German and healthy Gabonese women to determine an influence on placental gene expression by geographical or genetic factors. Gene expression levels of genes related to Vitamin D metabolism (VDR, Cyp27b1), immunologically important genes (e.g. IFN-g, IL-10) and pregnancy related genes (Hsd3b1) were analyzed. In addition, serum levels of Vitamin D, C-reactive protein and calcium serum levels from mothers and children at the time of birth were determined. Results from 22 German and 13 Gabonese mothers revealed distinct differences in placental gene expression and correlation patterns such as significantly lower VDR and Hsd3b1 expression in placentas of Gabonese women with enhanced levels of inflammation. Those results will be expanded by a larger cohort study in Gabon, to investigate the effects of helminth infection. In summary, these preliminary results indicate that the tight regulation within the fetomaternal interface could be indeed influenced by environmental or genetic factors whereby helminth infections might have an yet unknown impact. Methods From 2012 to 2015, a prospective clinical study was conducted by the consortium Neglected Infectious Diseases Diagnosis (NIDIAG) in the 350-bed rural hospital of Mosango, province of Kwilu. All consenting patients >5 years admitted with recent and/or ongoing (non-traumatic) neurological disorders were evaluated by a neurologist, submitted to a systematic laboratory workup and clinically followed-up until six months after discharge. Neither electroencephalogram nor neuroimaging was available in the study hospital. All available stored sera were in 2015 subjected to the B158/B60 ELISA detecting circulating T. solium cysticercus antigen. A test was considered positive if the ratio (optical density sample/cut off) was \u22651.0, and strongly positive when the ratio was \u22652.0.",

Epidemiological studies reported prevalences ranging from 0.05% to 0.27%, while prevalence estimates based on anthelmintic sales, ranged between 0.02% and 0.67%.

Theoretically, urban YFV cycles are possible in Brazilian large cities, including those not far from the present outbreak, Belo Horizonte, Vitoria and Rio de Janeiro, all of them infested by Aedes aegypti. To prevent this fearsome threat is important to massively vaccinate urban populations with the 17DD yellow fever vaccine. In these large cities, probably, less than 50% of the population is vaccinated while at least 80% immunized are formally required to block urban transmission and prevent large outbreaks of YF. Method The cuban Aedes aegypti control programme carries out three main activities: inspection of premises for detecting and eliminating immature mosquito stages and larviciding, indoor fogging and outdoor spatial spraying. During 2015 we collected in Santiago de Cuba data on the resources consumed per month in urban (n = 10), semi-urban (3) and rural (3) areas. We used forms and spreadsheets specially designed for the purpose. We valued recourses at 2015 prices. Costs were classified by activities and further as recurrent and capital. We calculated average costs per 1000 premises, per 1000 premised treated (revised, sprayed) and per house block sprayed. We ran a GEE population average model to quantify the influence of the geographic area, entomological infestation and coverage of activities on cost. for urban, semi urban and rural areas, respectively. Spatial spraying costed per house block was US$1.75, 0.81US$ and US $0.24 for urban, semi urban and rural areas, respectively. In the multivariate model the geographic zone (P < 0.02), indoor spraying coverage (P < 0.026) and spatial spraying coverage (P < 0.03), but not month and entomological infestation by itself were independent determinants of total cost.

The sociology articles emphasised that TB is as much a social as a biological disease and supported the use of developed scales as means to measure levels of TB-related stigma among the health care workforce. Provincial-level record reviews provided clear indications of delivery system, programme, clinical, geographical, and socio-demographical risk factors for TB treatment default and mortality. Subsequent microbiological studies have confirmed the existence of diverse molecular genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis circulating in the province, endorsing the current emphasis on rapid diagnosis of new cases.

Introduction In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria in pregnancy (MiP) is a major public health problem causing significant maternal and infant morbidity and mortality 1 . Plasmodium falciparum infections during pregnancy rarely result in fever and therefore remain undetected and untreated. In areas with high malaria transmission, MiP is a known risk factor for maternal anemia, low birth weight (LBW) and perinatal and infant death 2 . Low birth weight associated with MiP is estimated to result in 100 000 infant deaths in Africa each year 3 Aim To establish that in HIV negative pregnant women, cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is non-inferior to sulfadoxinepyrimethamine prophylaxis with respect to birth-weight at delivery or within 24 hr of delivery.

Thirdly, the doctor-patient hierarchy consisting of limited communications between health professionals and patients due to language barriers and the perspectives on minority patients further enhances the difficulties during the health encounter.

Diagnosis of gHAT is complex. Suspects identified using serological tests have to be confirmed by parasitology and the stage of disease determined before treatment. This requires a network of laboratories and an efficient referral system. The Ministry of Health in Uganda, in collaboration with FIND, has improved access to gHAT diagnosis by deploying rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for HAT, and equipping strategically located laboratories in the endemic region. The goal during the 'last mile' of gHAT elimination in Uganda, is to ensure cases are diagnosed and treated quickly.",

Trachoma is caused by an obligate intracellular bacterium chlamydia trachomatis and is spread through contact via hands, clothes, beddings and flies that has been in contact with discharge from an infected person. The two types are; the Active Trachoma in 1-9 age group and Blinding Trachoma (15 years and above). Conclusion Given the STH prevalence <1%, PC delivery in the surveyed areas was no longer recommended and the Bolivian program decided to interrupt it.

Zero or low-risk exposure, one high-risk exposure and 2 + high-risk exposures were estimated at 4%, 59% and 37%, respectively. Complete serology was available for 674 contact persons: 15 (2.2%) had antibodies to GP+NP or GP+NP+VP, and are strongly suspected to have been infected with EBV. In addition, 39 (5.8%) patients had antibodies to NP+VP40 or GP+VP40 and 146 (22%) to a single antigen, GP (n = 117, 17.4%), NP (n = 20, 2.9%) or VP40 (n = 63, 9.3%). An history of vaccination was associated with antibodies to GP (24.0% vs 12.3%, P < 10 -3 ). Exposure was marginally associated with antibodies to GP+NP (zero-low risk = 1.0% vs \u22652 high exposures = 3.6%, P = 0.08). EBOV RT-PCR was negative in semen of the 11 tested men. In the Central African Republic (CAR), influenza-like illnesses are the most common causes in consultation. The Institut Pasteur of Bangui (IPB) set up a surveillance network in 2008 to monitor the circulation of the influenza viruses. The first step of this surveillance network was achieved in Bangui city (capital of the CAR) and its neighboring areas. Epidemiological data of syndromes similar to influenza-like illnesses and throat and nasopharyngeal swab samples are weekly transmitted to IPB. A multiplex reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method was used for detecting and subtyping influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B viruses. Between January 2010 and December 2015, a number of 5,385 throat samples were collected. Age <5 years was the most infected (61.1% or 275/450). A proportion of 8.3% samples (n = 450) yield at least one influenza virus and a total number of 454 strains of influenza virus were identified (coinfections, n = 4). The InflB was the most frequent with a proportion of 56.2% (n = 201), while proportions of H3N2 and H1N1pdm09 were 39.0% and 16.7%, respectively. In conclusion, it is clear that this step of implementation of sentinel surveillance shows important findings about circulating influenza virus. A nationwide implementation of sentinel sites for this program is suggested.",

Results International aid and local health care mainly focused on the Ebola outbreak while the regular burden of disease was left unattended. Health care workers were more likely to get infected, resulting in absenteeism that could ultimately lead to the close down of health facilities and collapse of routine care. Utilization of maternal health services decreased for deliveries and Caesarea, ante-and post-natal care and family planning, resulting in rising maternal fatality. Consultations at hospitals and health centres due to diarrhoea and respiratory infections of children decreased indicating a reduction of health care utilization. Decrease of vaccination coverage increased the risk of Measles outbreaks. Fever cases seen at health facilities and paediatric admissions for malaria fell. The number of children <5 years receiving treatment and intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy dropped. Two models suggested a massive morbidity and mortality due to malaria during this outbreak. Less patients visited HIV facilities, prevention of mother-to-child transmission services as well as diagnosis and treatment of new cases went down.

This is counterproductive in reducing mortality and morbidity. Uganda scrapped user-fees in public sector resulting in increased usage of public facilities, but with subsequent increase in out-of-pocket health spending over a 4-year period. This shows that user-fee abolition had no effect on out-of-pocket spending in absence of sustainable health financing alternatives. To ensure financial security and improve access to affordable quality health services in rural communities, the Uganda Protestant Medical Bureau (UPMB) with support from Health Partners and Save for Health piloted a community health insurance (CHI) scheme in 15 network facilities between 2010 and 2015.

Health systems are known to be complex systems and the understanding about the dynamic interaction of the different systems is lacking generally and specifically for this region. Results Managers' perceptions of the goals of the CHS reach well beyond the merely curative aspect and include also a balancing social effect. The service delivery by the CHS is perceived to be equitable and accessible. The role of the CHS is seen as complementary to the government health system with an advantage of perceived higher quality of services by the CHS. The internal management of the CHS is perceived to have improved substantially over the years although some bottlenecks are perceived to exist still.

Implementation of BS requires a commitment from partner countries towards credible progress in public finance management (PFM) reforms and, in this case, towards better allocation of resources and more efficient provision of public services. It seems to have had also relevant implications for PFM performance, both at national and regional/local levels. Results Central-level PFM performance analysis allowed for BS to be disbursed from Belgium to Peru. Within the overall macroeconomic and fiscal reality, health financing, although still insufficient, is directed to priority populations and used more efficiently for negotiated service outputs and outcomes. Budget execution rose, and accountability and transparency increased on decentralised level. Closer cooperation between health and finance officials increased the health sector budget allocation in most years since the introduction of BS, but other tangible benefits of this association have been, amongst others, increased budget predictability and execution and lower funding fragmentation. Hence, improved public services. However, sector, regional and programme challenges remain. Increases in health spending aim mainly at expanding coverage while control and quality mechanisms are still weak or uncoordinated.

Smoking, physical inactivity, harmful alcohol consumption and an unhealthy diet increase the (avoidable) risk to die from NCDs. 1 NCD mortality has continuously increased over time. The UN Political Declaration of 2011 underlined the importance of NCD prevention and control on the global health policy agenda. 2 Guided by the WHO Global action plan (2013-2020), considerable efforts are being undertaken to improve prevention and treatment of NCDs worldwide. Low-and middle-income countries bear three quarters of the global NCD mortality burden.

We conducted the 6 scoping reviews. At the end, we held a workshop where VERDAS researchers (n = 14) and decision-makers (n = 8) collaborated in a concept mapping exercise to identify research gaps and priorities and writing a series of policy briefs. The exact outcome of CC on human schistosomiasis, a bloodfluke affecting more than 200 mill. people, is likely to vary with the snail-parasite species investigated, the spatio-temporal scale of investigation and geographical location. Although, studies that explicitly investigate the CC-schistosomiasis relation are relatively rare, a wealth of studies use the known, estimated or observed correlation with climatic factors, to predict the current risk and distribution. Such studies can implicitly give indications about the expected direction and outcomes of CC on schistosomiasis given changing climatic conditions. Aim Here, we provide an updated synthesis of current knowledge about the climate change-schistosomiasis relation. Specifically this review is driven by asking the following questions: 1) what is the current scientific \"evidence\" (if any) about the effect and direction of CC on schistosomiasis? and 2) is there consensus about the CC-schistosomiasis relation across parasite-snail-species, spatial scales, geographical location and applied methods?

Research Topic/Background Like most countries in southern Africa, Malawi is at the epicenter of the HIV epidemic. In 2016, an estimated one million people were living with HIV, which included 40,000 children (0-14). 1 Approximately 90% of childhood HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa occur due to mother-to-child transmission of HIV. 2 In 2011, Malawi developed and adopted a novel Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) Option B+ approach that provides lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV-infected pregnant and breast feeding women irrespective of clinical or immunological status. Along with Option B+, Malawi started implementing a program of HIV early infant diagnosis (EID) using DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at 6 weeks after birth to improve infant HIV detection and subsequent enrolment to care. 3 Unfortunately, programmatic challenges persist in implementation of EID program in Malawi along critical points in the infant cascade. In 2013, a sizeable portion (13.5%) of infants failed to receive a PCR test and 25% were tested after 2 months of age. Furthermore, no change was observed post Option B+ in the median time to delivery of test results, proportion of infants started on ART or age at ART start. 4 A pooled analysis on the mortality of untreated, African HIV-infected children reports that 52% of children with peri-partum infection and 26% of those with postnatal infection die at 12 months post-acquisition of HIV infection. 5 Malawi embarked in 2015 on the training and deployment of a dedicated cadre of providers, known as HIV Diagnostic Assistants (HDAs) to address the implementation challenges and scale-up of overall HIV diagnostic services, including EID and linkage to Antiretroviral Treatment (ART). To our knowledge, this is a novel approach designed by Malawi Ministry of Health (MOH) and its effect on early infant diagnosis of HIV-exposed infants and their enrolment to care has not been evaluated.",

To this end, the classic average plus standard deviation method (AV+SD) is commonly utilized. However, this approach relies on extensive antecedent data, which is often missing due to fragmented surveillance and fragile operational contexts, such as in malaria endemic South Sudan.

Hence, male elders, traditional healers, TBAs and pregnant mothers were invited to the hospital compound in several meetings to explore these issues more and expand the cultural knowledge of the hospital staff. With their help, a construction plan for building a maternity ward was developed in 2009. The new maternity wing for 24 patients was be opened in 2011. Complications can be handled better with new equipment. TBA meetings were held quarterly since 2009 at the hospital and were attended by up to 60 women. A local artist painted the walls of the maternity ward with culture sensitive illustrations. Inspired by these illustrations a German artist developed an educational broschure to be used in teaching sessions dealing with birth complications and the potential danger of home deliveries.

Alcohol consumption reveals gender rituals such as \"becoming a man\" and \"female liberation\" and also ways of reinforcing social bonds between communities. Smoking behaviour has changed after the introduction of laws banning smoking in indoor public areas. Cultural perception of \"a fat body as healthy-wealthy body\" rejects the biomedical discourse of overweight, or at least re-signifies it.

The genus Bulinus contains most of the snail intermediate hosts of Schistosoma haematobium. The adult worms of S. haematobium inhabit the veins of the vesical plexus of the humans, although some parasites may live in the portal vein and its mesenteric branches. Oviposition normally occurs in the small terminal venules of the vesical plexus, but occasionally in the rectal venules, the mesenteric portal system and ectopic sites. Eggs (with prominent terminal spine) are partly mature when laid, and migrate through the bladder wall to be discharged in the urine. S. haematobium is causal agent of urogenital schistosomiasis which cause high morbidity in endemic countries. S. haematobium infection was categorized as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in association with the World Health Organization.

The progress made in its fight is threatened by rapid development and spread of mosquito resistance to insecticides in the context of universal use of LLIN. Between 2013 and 2016, the National Malaria Control Program of Niger conducted a longitudinal follow-up of insecticide resistance of malaria vector in line with WHO recommendations. Method Larvaes of Anopheles gambiae s.l were collected from 2013 to 2016 in fourteen localities selected based on different use of insecticides and environment. WHO susceptibility tests in tube were used on females to detect insecticide resistance. Eight insecticides were tested and two synergists in 2016. Percentages of knock down during the time of exposure for pyrethroid and DDT, and mortality after 24 hr observation for all insecticides tested was determinated. Polymerase Chain Reaction and biochemical tests carried out to species identification and to determine mechanisms of resistance (Kdr and Ace-1 allelic frequencies and activity of detoxification enzymes). Results Anopheles gambiae s.l. was resistant to pyrethroid and DDT all years, but susceptible to Bendiocarbe and Malathion in 2013, partially susceptible in 2014 and resistant in 2016. Kdr and Ace-1 mutations were present and increasing in Niger. In 2005 the average frequency of Kdr was 36%. It was 56% in 2013, 48% in 2014 and 50% in 2016. This increase is seen in the years following LLIN distribution campaigns. Heterozygous form of Ace-1 was found in 3/7 sites in 2014 and 8/9 sites in 2016. Biochemical tests showed the existence of enzymatic activities (Esterase, Oxidase and Glutathione S Transferase) every year.",

Tuberculosis is the most common opportunistic infection and leading cause of death in HIV-infected patients (Swaminathan and Narendran 2008: 527). Tuberculosis and HIV combined are responsible for the deaths of over 4 million people annually. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that from 9.2 million new cases of TB in 2006, 7.7% were HIV infected and of the 1.7 million deaths from TB in 2008, almost one third were people co-infected with HIV or AIDS (WHO, 2009: 2). In 2009, 380,000 people died of HIV associated Tuberculosis. It is the most common presenting illness among people living with HIV including those who are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). At least one third of the 33.3 million people living with HIV worldwide are infected with Tuberculosis. (WHO 2011: 1-3).",

Until now, control and eradication efforts against P. vivax have been delayed due to its particular biological features like the reactivation of hypnozoites and the early gametocytes apparition in bloodstream. Further knowledge on the parasite dynamics at individual and population level is key to design more efficient malaria control programs.Aim We aim to elucidate the dynamics at individual and population level of P. vivax infections detected in a 2-year monthly follow up cohort in the Peruvian Amazon.Methods During March 2008 to February 2011 we have followed up 302 participants from 29 communities in and around Iquitos city and along the Iquitos-Nauta road (Loreto region, Peru). Blood samples were obtained on the recruitment day (CQ + PQ was administered) and afterwards weekly within the first month and monthly up to month 24. All samples were diagnosed by light microscopy and afterwards by PCR-based molecular diagnosis. All positive samples to P. vivax were later genotyped using a panel of 14 neutral microsatellites. A longitudinal genetic-relatedness analysis was performed to assess and compare the dynamics at individual and population level.",

Since 2008, annual mass drug administrations (MDA) of praziquantel have been rolled out targeting school age children, in 11 (out of 45) districts at high risk of schistosomiasis.Aim To assess whether schistosomiasis cases reported by health facilities via the national health management information system could be used to verify the impact of MDA in those districts where annual treatment was performed.MethodsFrom the aggregated data available by district from 2011 to 2015, number of schistosomiasis cases, diagnosed by direct smear of stools, was collected. Schistosomiasis trends were assessed by Poisson regression by comparing years 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, to year 2011. To verify whether changes in schistosomiasis trends over time were due to MDA of praziquantel and not to other potential factors, like environmental factors, a comparison with schistosomiasis trends in districts without MDA (1) and with malaria burden as a disease representing general morbidity in these 11 districts (2) was done. Results The number of schistosomiasis cases decreased significantly each year (b 2012 = \u00c00.267, P = 0.000; b 2013 = \u00c00.356, P = 0.000; b 2014 = \u00c00.760, P = 0.000; b 2015 = \u00c01.172, P = 0.000) in the 11 districts where MDA was performed.

Lutumba P et Coppieters Universit e Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium Objective To evaluate onchocerciasis control activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in the first 12 years of community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI). Methods Data from the National Programme for Onchocerciasis (NPO) provided by the National Onchocerciasis Task Force (NOTF) through the annual reports of the 21 CDTI projects for the years 2001-2012 were reviewed retrospectively. A hypothetical-inputs-process-outputs-outcomes table was constructed. Results Community-directed treatment with ivermectin expanded from 1968 communities in 2001 to 39 100 communities by 2012 while the number of community-directed distributors (CDD) and health workers (HW) multiplied. By 2012, there were ratios of 1 CDD per 262 persons and 1 HW per 2318 persons at risk. More than 80% of the funding came from the fiduciary funds of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control.

Studies carried out to determine the costeffectiveness of the various first-line ARV regimens in Nigeria remain limited. Aim This study aimed to provide the gap in ARV costeffectiveness studies in Nigeria. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of all those enrolled into the HIV clinic of ABUTH, Zaria from 2009 to 2013. Demographic and clinic data were retrieved from the electronic database, case notes and supplemented with literatures. Direct medical costs were calculated while the utility measures were derived from published literature. Results The combination therapy AZT/3TC/EFV provided the most utility of 0.913 among the first-line drugs, followed by TDF/ 3TC/NEV (0.901) while TDF/FTC/NEV provided the least utility (0.848). Overall, AZT/3TC/NEV (ICER per QALY = $815.6) is the most cost-effective of the first-line ARVs, followed by AZT/ 3TC/EFV (ICER per QALY = $1173.7) while TDF/FTC/EFV is the least cost-effective (ICER per QALY = $2397.8). A one-way sensitivity analysis showed that varying the QALYs gained has an overall impact on the ICER/QALY. Conclusion HIV programme managers, authorities and payers for HIV medications should focus on the use of AZT/ 3TC/EFV, AZT/3TC/NEV and TDF/3TC/ NEV as the fulcrum of their first-line ARV drugs in their programmes.",

Objective To describe and discuss an innovative holistic training and research capacity building program supported by the Belgian Development Cooperation in Guinea. Methods Program documents will be used to describe and present the main activities, preliminary results and the potential effects of the program. Results Following an initial needs assessment involving all stakeholders in Guinea (April 2016), a scientific collaboration program (2017-2021) was developed between the Maferinyah National Training and Research Centre (Guinea) and the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) of Antwerp (Belgium). First, Maferinyah Centre's training capacities will be improved through eLearning Courses for young health professionals. Second, the research capacities of Maferinyah Center are strengthened through a \"learning by doing\" approach Reproductive Health, Human Resources for Health, Management of febrile illness and Patient Centred Care. Third, the Centre's management capacities are strengthened and its young staff trained (at least two PhD). A synergy with a local NGO (Fraternite Medicale Guin ee) has been developed within the training and research components of the Program. The development and running of three e-Courses (Primary Health Care, Sexual and Reproductive Health and Antiretroviral Therapy) is on-going. The process along with preliminary results of the program will be presented. Conclusion This innovative Capacity Building Program is likely to make Maferinyah as the leader in continuing medical education and research in Guinea. 1 The Program is funded by the Belgian Directorate-General for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid (DGD) and additional funding from the Belgian Technical Cooperation (BTC) supports e-Courses development and running.

The methodology used in this health awareness campaign did not promote the permanent knowledge and preventive practices associated to the exposure of Toxocara canis.Background Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii. It is transmitted to humans from vegetables and fruit contaminated with cat feces. Often asymptomatic in the pregnant women, it can result in the fetus, severe neurological effects, and infant, eye injuries, neurological and death. If care is not early in pregnancy, the risk of MTCT is %30%. Seroconversion, only diagnostic means, in Africa is estimated at 60%. In tropical countries of Africa, high prevalence, up to 80% in humid regions. While cats are among the highest Pets Lubumbashi, no data exist on the extent of the disease in the population; accordingly, there is no integrated public health measure to ANC activities. This study was initiated to determine the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in pregnant women in Lubumbashi.Conclusion Toxoplasmosis is a common zoonosis in pregnant but is not systematically sought during prenatal visits despite his serious fetal and neonatal unknown consequences for health personnel and women. Ensure, at home, the management of feces of cats and integrate screening and early treatment of toxoplasmosis with ANC activities are public health measures to reduce the impact of disease on human health.Keywords Toxoplasmosis, maternal-fetal transmission.

We analyzed data by Stata Software and maps were created using Quantum GIS software Results A total of 21 humans were suspected with a majority of cases (n = 13; 61.9%) being from Selela Ward. A total of 131 wildlife, 10 cattle, 26 goats, and 3 sheep died following this outbreak with a high mortality of wildebeests (n = 109; 83.2%). The laboratory results indicated that, three blood smears from wildebeests tested positive by Giemsa staining and another two specimen were confirmed by qPCR. Five human's blood samples tested negative for anthrax Conclusion We confirmed anthrax outbreak in wildlife from Selela Ward using both Giemsa stain and qPCR techniques. Since clinical forms of anthrax were also observed in humans and livestock, this shows that wildlife plays a significant role as reservoir for anthrax which is easily transmitted to humans and livestock. The prompt response by using a One Health approach managed to contain the outbreak.

Cats and dogs are known to harbour a zoonotic strain of Brugia malayi in the Southeast Asian region, but the role of reservoir hosts in the recent cases of Brugian filariasis discovered in Sri Lanka has not been established to date. To study the prevalence of filarial parasites in cats and dogs in an area with known previous transmission of Brugian filariasis to human.Conclusions There is a very high prevalence of Brugia species and D. repens among cats and dogs in the SA in Madampe. Species identification of canine and feline Brugia parasites and their association with human infections requires further investigation.Objectives To study the epidemiology of brugian filariasis in Gampaha district, identify the most vulnerable age groups affected and characterize the periodicity pattern of the microfilariae (mf). Ethical clearance for the study was obtained from the Ethics Review Committees of the Faculty of Medicine University of Kelaniya and Medical Research Institute. A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in selected areas of the Gampaha district in December 2016. Selection of study areas (SA) were based on distribution of past positive cases. Areas with two or more positive cases within a 500 m radius were defined as a SA. An age stratified population was selected. Criteria for enrolment of study population were residence in a SA for more than one year and age above one year. Thick night blood smears (NBS) and a rapid dipstick test (Brugia Rapid, Reszon Diagnostics International, Malaysia) were used for detection of mf and IgG4 antibodies to Brugia malayi respectively. To study the periodicity of mf, counts were done periodically over a 24-hour period using Nuclepore Membrane Filtration.Conclusions Low grade transmission of bancroftian and brugian filariasis continue to occur in Gampaha district. The Brugia species exhibited nocturnal sub-periodicity indicating a probable zoonotic origin. Definitive species identification of the Brugian parasite by molecular methods is envisaged.Aim To assess the dynamics of ZIKV in several fluids of infected individuals through RNA detection and to determine the risk of sexual transmission to non-traveler sexual partners. Their sexual contacts were offered to participate. Nine out of 11 patients had a ZIKV IgM or PCR positive. One out of four women (25%) had a positive PCR in the vaginal swab 45 days after symptoms onset and 20% of men in semen up to 24 days. All patients with positive PCR showed positive IgG, while some patients with positive IgM never converted IgG. ZIKV RNA detection was positive in genital fluids of 25% women and 20% men. Time for clearance was 37 and 24 respectively. No sexual transmission was found among sexual contacts. Diagnostic algorithms should be updated to include genital tract fluid specimens in the process.

Appropriate control strategies are needed to better fight malaria in this region.Methods Triatomines were collected in southern and coastalEcuador(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012). PCR amplification of the Cytb was performed with the DNA of the intestinal content and sent for sequencing. Identification of the blood source was assessed by BLAST (> 95% of identity). Infection with T. cruzi was detected by amplification of the kDNA.Conclusion Detection of human blood in triatominescirculating in all environments, together with the elevated infection rate with T. cruzi, constitutes an important warning sign of the high risk of Chagas disease transmission in Ecuador. Our data suggests that prevalence is underestimated. Although previous studies reported a seroprevalence from 1% to 5.7% 1 , and the presence of all the conditions for active transmission, the official data report no active transmission since 2007 2 . Furthermore, finding peridomestic and, especially, sylvatic triatomines fed with human blood raises the possibility of transmission related with outdoor activities, such as farming and challenges the effectiveness of insecticide spraying of houses as the main control strategy. Instead, it reinforces the importance of investing in long-term strategies to reduce the probability of transmission of T. cruzi to humans, such as home improvement.

Using routinely collected program data from M edecins Sans Fronti eres' (MSF) HCV program, we aimed to describe the prevalence of HCV co-infection among patients from three different HIV outpatient departments (OPDs) with varying risk profiles in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. We retrospectively reviewed routinely collected program data of HCV test orders and results of adult patients (age 18 or above) receiving HIV care in three different OPDs in Phnom Penh between May 2016 and January 2017one OPD with low-risk general HIV patients and two high-risk OPDs with FEW (female entertainment workers), MSM (men who have sex with men), TG (transgender), and PWID (people who inject drugs). We described the prevalence of HCV by age groups, and used multivariate logistic regression with age, sex, and risk status (FEW/MSM/TG or PWID) as covariates in the model to identify the odds being anti-HCV antibody positive. Conclusion Although this study is not generalizable, results of HCV testing from three unique HIV OPDs suggest that HIV programs aiming to screen HCV patients in Cambodia may consider targeting testing to older patients and PWID if resources are limited. Future prevalence studies targeting highrisk populations are warranted. Introduction Long-lasting digestive disorders, such as persistent abdominal pain (\u22652 weeks) and persistent diarrhoea (\u22652 weeks), are frequently encountered clinical syndromes and cause considerable morbidity worldwide. Individuals living in resource-constrained areas with poor hygiene and inadequate access to clean water and improved sanitation are prone to such syndromes. The aetiology of digestive disorders includes bacterial, parasitic and viral pathogens. In Mali, treatment is usually empirical and a detailed laboratory work-up to identify the causative agent is rare. Aim To identify infectious pathogens giving rise to digestive syndromes in a selected area of Mali and to develop treatment guidelines for the management of symptomatic patients with persistent digestive disorders. The study was embedded in a multi-centric study by the NIDIAG research consortium (www.nidiag.org) and was conducted in a reference health centre of Niono, located around 330 km from Bamako, the capital of Mali. Patients presenting with persistent digestive disorders (abdominal pain and/or persistent diarrhoea) were enrolled, clinically examined and subjected to a suite of microbiological techniques on urine and stool specimens, including stool microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests and bacterial stool culture. Results Between August 2014 and November 2015, 553 symptomatic patients with persistent digestive disorders were recruited; 97.6% had abdominal pain, while the remaining 2.4% had diarrhoea. Among all stool samples examined by direct faecal smear, 89.0% were positive for at least one intestinal protozoa or helminth species. Using the Kato-Katz technique, 66.9% of the samples were positive for either Schistosoma mansoni or Hymenolepis nana. Other frequently detected parasites included the protozoal species Entamoeba histolytica/ E. dispar, Giardia intestinalis and Trichomonas intestinalis. Based on these results, a combination of metronidazole and praziquantel was proposed for the management of digestive disorders in the study area. This study provides data on the most prevalent parasitic pathogens detected in patients with digestive symptoms in the Niono area. Infections with G. intestinalis and S. mansoni were the most frequently encountered treatable conditions in these patients. Hence, metronidazole and praziquantel are suitable treatment options for individuals with persistent digestive disorders in this Malian setting. Digestive disorders in Mali: assessment of a neglected public health issue Introduction Diarrhoea, abdominal pain and other digestive disorders are common reasons for healthcare consultations in resource-constrained settings. The patient's medical history and a thorough clinical examination can provide valuable information regarding the need for additional examinations. Helminths and intestinal protozoa are common infectious agents giving rise to abdominal pain in tropical areas, but the extent of their contribution to the development of digestive disorders is insufficiently described. NIDIAG (www.nidiag.org) is an international research consortium aiming to elucidate the aetiology of digestive disorders in the tropics.",

Brown Department of Emerging and Infectious Diseases, United States Army Medical Research Unit-Kenya, Kenya Medical Research Institute/Walter Reed Project, Kisumu, Kenya; Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Nairobi, KenyaBackground Persistent parasitemia occurs in at least 25% infections in sub-Saharan Africa despite continued efficacy of artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) across Africa. As there are no validated markers of ACT resistance in Africa to-date, surveillance of changes in these polymorphisms is useful in establishing their role in ACT treatment outcome.Methods Each of the 118 P. falciparum sample from a 2013-15 ACTs clinical efficacy study was screened at three or fourtime points; day zero before start of treatment then days 2 and 3 after initiation of treatment plus the day of subsequent parasitemia by microscopy prior to day 42 for some of the subjects. Sequence analyzers were used to genotype for frequency of drug resistance polymorphisms, genetic diversity typing of the 12 microsatellite loci. Worldwide Antimalaria Resistance Network's (WWARN) parasite clearance estimator (PCE) was used to determine parasite clearance rates.ResultsThe most polymorphic loci of Pfap2mu and pfcubp-1 genes were S145C at 18% and E1528D at 19%. Pfmdr1 86,184 and 1246 had significant increase in wild type alleles at timepoints 3 and 4. Multiple copies of the Pfmdr1 gene were observed in 4.55% of the samples analysed. Microsatellite profile analysis show that the mean number of alleles in all the loci across the 8 populations ranged from 9.250 to 1.000. Poly a was the most polymorphic with 35 alleles. The mean unbiased heterozygosity (H e ) was 0.672 while Shannon diversity index for the 8 populations was ranging between 0.182-0.000, none of the parasite analyzed had matching haplotypes. The mean parasite clearance half-life was 2.63 hr (IQR), 95% confidence interval) and the median clearance. Low clearance rate attained in this study suggests that ACTs are still effective treatment in Kenya. However, increased wild-type Pfmdr1 86,184 and 1246 as well as polymorphisms in pfap2mu and pfcubp-1 in post day zero suggest that these genes could be responding to ACT dosing and require continued monitoring. Samples with multiple copies of the Pfmdr1 did not indicate any effects on parasite clearance.Methods The EQA consisted of (i) 10 high-resolution printed photographs displaying cassettes with real-life results and multiple choice questions (MCQ) addressing individual health worker (HW), and (ii) a questionnaire on RDT use addressing the laboratory of health facilities (HF). Answers were transmitted through short message services (SMS). The EQA comprised 2344 HW and 1028 HF covering 10/11 provinces in DRC. Overall, median HW score (sum of correct answers on 10 MCQ photographs for each HW) was 9.0 (interquartile range 7.5-10); MCQ scores (% of correct answers for a particular photograph) ranged from 54.8% to 91.6%. Most common errors were (i) reading or interpreting faint or weak line intensities as negative (3.4%) respectively. HW who were trained less than 12 months ago had best MCQ scores for 7/10 photographs as well as a significantly higher proportion of 10/10 scores, but absolute differences in MCQ scores were small. HW who had participated in a previous EQA performed significantly better for 4/10 photographs compared to those who had not. Except for two photographs, MCQ scores were comparable for all levels of the HF hierarchy and non-laboratory staff (HW from health posts) had similar performance as to laboratory staff. Main findings of the questionnaire were (i) use of other RDT products than recommended by the national malaria control programme (nearly 20% of participating HF), (ii) lack of training for a third (33.6%) of HF, (iii) high proportions (two-thirds, 66.5%) of HF reporting stock-outs.Conclusions The present EQA revealed common errors in RDT reading and interpretation by HW in DRC. Performances of non-laboratory and laboratory staff were similar and dedicated training was shown to improve HW competence although to a moderate extent. Problems in supply, distribution and training of RDTs were detected.References 1. Rennie W, Phetsouvanh R, Lupisan S, Vanisaveth V, Hongvanthong B, Phompida S, et al.

Results Overall, 183 PW were screened, 21.3% (39/183) had a probable or confirmed ZIKV infection, 43.6% of them (17/39) were primiparous, returning from Dominican Republic 33.3% (13/39), Honduras 23.1% (9/39), Colombia 12.8% (5/39), Bolivia 12.8% (5/39), Ecuador 7.7% (3/39), Venezuela 8.2% (2/ 39), and El Salvador 7.7% (2/39). Median [IQR] mother's age and gestational age for diagnosis were 30.5 [23.5-34.4] years and 20.6 [15.5-28.5] weeks, respectively. Most of them were asymptomatic 56.4% (22/39); in symptomatic cases, rash was the main clinical manifestation 76.5% (13/17). Amniocentesis was performed in 38.5% (15/39), with positive ZIKV RT-PCR in only one case (6.7%; 1/15), which was the only foetus with neurologic abnormalities.ZIKV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR in 20.5% (8/39), and was probable by positive ZIKV-IgM in 10.3% (4/39) or positive ZIKV neutralization test in 69.2% (27/39). One of the three elective abortions tested positive ZIKV RT-PCR in placental tissue. Co-infections with dengue (positive IgM) were observed in three cases, one of them in the woman with the microcephalic foetus. Prevalence of ZIKV infection was of 21.3% (39/183). After birth, all the children born-to-ZIKVinfected mothers tested negative for ZIKV RT-PCR and IgM.Conclusion This is the largest series of traveller ZIKVinfected PW in Europe. One third returned from Dominican Republic, most of them were diagnosed in the second term (20.6 weeks), and were asymptomatic (56.4%). ZIKV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR in 20.5% of cases.

The majority of patients have no access to healthcare and >80% are irregular migrants. To increase knowledge on risk factors for HIV we gathered data on demographic and behaviour factors. Methods We started offering HCT through Opt-In in December 2015. A short introduction on HIV and testing is given in the waiting area. All patients are free to take up HIV testing. When giving their consent, they receive counselling, Alere HIV Combo RDT and referral for further STI screening if necessary. During 2016 we conducted anonymous questionnaires to patients receiving HCT. We used Microsoft Access and Excel for data entry and analysis. Results Up to submission of this abstract 385 patients received HCT. 1 patient tested positive for HIV. During 2016, 269 patients received a questionnaire. 59% were male, 61% female. Median age was 36. 261 (97%) patients originated from outside of Western Europe (32% Sub-Saharan Africa, 27% North-Africa/Middle-East, 25% Asia, 9% Eastern Europe, 5% Latin-America). 41% were residing in Belgium >5 years. 42% had no fixed housing. 89% had no access to healthcare. 56% never received HIV testing. Previous testing varied between regions (14% Asia up to 80% SSA). 14% reported an STI in the past. During the previous year 49% had 1, 30% \u2265 2 sexual partners. Of these patients 18% reported using a condom consistently. 4% were MSM. 13% reported receiving money or gifts in exchange of sexual intercourse. The proportion of no fixed housing was higher in this group (61% vs. 42% (P = 0.03 Chi-square test)). 3% reported sniffing or injecting drugs in the past. Conclusion 385 patients received HCT.

This is notably the case in low income countries and seems a grate challenge for the future with emergence of resistance to antiretroviral therapies and to antituberculosis drugs. Using stratified sampling, the required number of individuals from each occupational category was selected for every institution, proportional to their percentage in the total staff population.

STH control programmes based on preventive chemotherapy (PC) are endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In Bolivia, a program based on 6-months single-dose mebendazole delivery to school-aged children achieved a dramatic decrease in STHs prevalence from 1987 to 2013: hookworm from up to 50% to 0.4-1.3%, Ascaris lumbricoides from up to 19% to 0.9-1.5%, Trichuris trichiura from 19% to 0%.Aim To further assess STH prevalence among school-aged children in the Chaco Region, in order to inform the Bolivian STH control program policy decision. In September 2016, 548 school-aged children were enrolled in a cross-sectional study involving 9 sentinel sites, randomly selected among the rural communities of the Cordillera Province (Santa Cruz Department) and the Gran Chaco Province (Tarija Department). Stool sample for direct microscopy and Kato-Katz technique were collected. Haemoglobin levels (Hb) were assessed by HemoCue, as surrogate indicator of STH-related morbidity.ResultsOf 426 stool samples collected and analysed, only 3 cases of hookworms infection were detected, and none with A. lumbricoides or T. trichiura observed. The overall STH prevalence was 0.7 (95% CI 0.2-2.1).

Medical management is difficult due to lack of enough evidence to determine the best strategies for diagnosis and treatment, there is also often intermittent supply of antidotes. This study was aimed at assessing prevalence and management of acute pesticide poisoning in public and private hospitals in Kampala. We carried out a retrospective cross sectional study that involved reviewing of 739 patient records from 5 hospitals in Kampala. Descriptive analysis was carried out to assess prevalence, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of pesticide poisoning. Crude and adjusted logistic regressions were carried out to obtain odds ratios and 95% CI to identify demographic and poisoning characteristics associated intentional poisoning. Out of the 739 patients involved in the study, 28.8% (212/739) were due to pesticide poisoning giving a prevalence rate of 28.8. Majority of the cases were due to organophosphate poisoning 91.4% (191/210) taken intentionally 63.3% (133/210) by ingestion 98.1% (206/210). Males were (AOR 2.60; 95% CI 1.11-6.09) were 3 times, person aged 13-19 year olds (AOR 9.35; 95% CI 2.24-38.93) were 9 times; 20-30 year olds (AOR 13.40; 95% CI 3.63-49.51) were 13 times; 30 years above (AOR 6.57; 95% CI 1.67-25.91) were 7 times more likely to suffer from intentional pesticide poisoning. Diagnosis was based Conclusion The prevalence of acute pesticide poisoning was high among cases admitted to hospitals in Kampala with majority being managed based on physical and clinical examination.

Only 9.0% (34) of families in the lowest socio-economic quintile received free circumcision services compared to 27.9% (171) of the highest income families. The Government of Ghana and Non-Government Organisations should consider additional support to poor families so they can access high quality free infant male circumcision in rural Ghana.Introduction Birth weight is vital in the development of every newborn hence, influences child health and survival. Causes and adverse effects associated with Low Birth Weight (LBW) deliveries are well documented. Yet, newborns weighing less than 2.5 kg at birth are on the ascendancy particularly in resource constraints countries. In Ghana, LBW constitute 11% of all deliveries with the neonatal mortality rate at 28 per 1000 live births (1). This study explored the understanding, knowledge and beliefs of mothers on LBW infants, the type of care given to them in the home environment, how they are perceived in the community and the factors that contributed to their survival.Method A retrospective qualitative study employing the phenomenology design, which describes detailed experiences, was used to collect data from October 2016 to January 2017 in the Hohoe Municipality, Ghana. Using a topic guide, after 20 semi-structured interviews and three focus group discussions involving 18 purposely-selected participants, thematic saturation was reached. The computer-assisted Atlas.ti (version 7.5.16) was used to code and theme the data.Results LBW babies were described and identified based on size, helplessness and activity levels. Mothers did not perceive LBW babies as vulnerable and required special care compared to their normal weight counterparts. Cause of LBW was linked to poor diet intake, gestational ailments, hereditary, heavy work load and ordained by destiny. Apart from feeding, adult female relations deemed experienced in newborn care were the primary caregivers providing mainly bathing, thermal, cord and circumcision care. Male involvement was minimal due to fear of causing harm to the baby. This led to spousal role neglect and conflict. Societal reactions regarding LBW babies were similar as for normal weight newborns but where the newborn weighed <2 kg, attitudes regarding acceptability and handling differed. Both health promoting and negative deep-rooted cultural beliefs influenced the knowledge, practices and understanding on LBW care. No difference exists in the care rendered to LBW and normal weight infants. Cultural elements influenced caring practises. In-depth and culturally-adapted counselling provided before discharge from the health facility, targeted at mothers and their primary caregivers could improve child health. Two years after initial assessment, 76 of 123 DR Congo children with konzo (Mean age 10.5 yrs) were compared to 41 of 87 nonkonzo children from konzo-affected households on the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd edition (KABC-II), and the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, 2nd edition (BOT-2). At 4-year follow-up, 55 konzo and 33 nonkonzo children were evaluated.Findings Konzo boys did worse than non-konzo on the KABC-II Mental Processing Index (MPI) at 2-year follow-up (P = 0.01), but girls did not. At 4-year follow-up, the difference in MPI between konzo and nonkonzo was attenuated in boys and amplified in girls. Consistent with baseline, both konzo boys and girls were lower on BOT-2 at both follow-up times (P < 0.01). Both konzo and non-konzo boys declined on BOT-2 fine Motor proficiency (P < 0.02) and KABC-II MPI performance at 2-and 4-year follow-up (P < 0.01), but not the girls. For the boys, increases in urinary thiocyanate levels, an indicator of exposure to toxic cassava, was significantly related to decreases in BOT-2 motor proficiency (P = 0.03). This was not the case for the girls or for the relationship between thiocyanate and KABC-II MPI cognitive ability performance. Motor and cognitive performance continues to be significantly impaired in konzo male children at follow-up, perhaps from pervasive developmental risk or from neurocognitive impairment from continuing exposure to poorly processed cassava.

Introduction Knowledge is a valuable asset for individual as well as organizations to be successful in this demanding global economy. The change of information into knowledge is mainly due to the effort of human cognitive capacity. Knowledge Management (KM) is therefore a conscious strategy of getting the right knowledge to the right people at the right time and helping people share and put information into action in ways that strive to improve organizational performance. KM includes processes like knowledge capture and/or creation, knowledge sharing and dissemination, and knowledge acquisition and application.Aim The major aim of this project is to explore the knowledge sharing status and design knowledge sharing technology platform for health professionals working on maternal and child healthcare unit.

Aim We present findings from a nested evaluation that was guided by a modified realist framework, seeking 'contextmechanism-outcome' configurations.Methods Mixed methods were used including document review, in-depth interviews with Ministry (11) and prison facility (6) officials, focus group discussions (12) with male and female inmates in six prisons, and participant observation during project workshops and meetings. Ethical clearance and verbal informed consent were obtained for all activities. Analysis incorporated deductive and iterative inductive coding.Results Outcomes: Improved knowledge of the prison health system and service needs among key stakeholder groups was translated into stronger political and bureaucratic will. This found expression in a tripartite Memorandum-of-Understanding between Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Community Development, and in the appointment of a permanent liaison between MOH and ZCS. Capacity building workshops for members of ZCS Health Directorate and Command resulted in strengthened health planning and management outcomes including: doubling the ZCS health-professional workforce from 37 to 78 between 2014-16; introducing pre-service basic health training for all incoming ZCS officers, and formalisation of facility-based Prison Health Committees with a mandate for health promotion and protection (11 committees trained/appointed by 2016). Mechanisms: continuous and facilitated communication among major institutional stakeholders and the emergence of strong inter-organisational trust were critical to the project's iterative successes. Enabling contextual factors included a permissive political environment; a shift within ZCS from a 'punitive' to 'correctional' organisational culture; and prevailing political and public health concerns about the spread of HIV and TB in prisons.Conclusion Findings demonstrate how a \"systems\" approach to seemingly intractable problems of weak governance in the Zambian prison health system enabled both short-term 'tactical' and long-term 'strategic' progress. Many challenges remain but context-sensitive application of these principles to other settings may yield positive outcomes. Introduction Health in All Policies (HiAP) is an intersectoral approach that facilitates decision making among policy makers to maximize positive health impacts of other public policies. Health is a devolved function in Kenya with policies drafted at national government level but implemented at county government level. Kenya has committed to implement HiAP in the policy document for 2014 to 2030 with no specific strategy on how it will be implemented at the counties.Aim The aim of this ongoing PhD study is to find out how best HiAP can be implemented in Kenya especially at county level Methods This is a qualitative study with data being collected through interviews and policy documents review.Results So far 40 interviews with key informants from government, academia, development partners and NGOs in Kenya has been conducted. Policy documents have also been collected from the current 20 Ministries of Kenya. Preliminary results indicate that HiAP implementation is in its early stages in Kenya with the draft frameworks in place. It is viewed Aim This study aimed at evaluating the capacity of community health workers (CHW) to provide accurate estimates of deaths occurring in a community through a household survey in a postwar region. Methods This retrospective cross-sectional survey was conducted in two rural health zones in South-Kivu province (Mulungu and Idjwi) between 20 th January and 15 th February 2016. Community health workers primarily enrolled in a mosquito net distribution campaign were trained to collect global mortality data on the number of deaths occurring between January and December 2015, using a semi-structured questionnaire. We used stata 13 to generate prevalence estimates and odds ratios using the \"cci\" command.Results Overall, 23810 (77.7%) households were surveyed in Mulungu (total population = 139964) and 36058 (92.9%) in Idjwi (total population = 197305). The CHW were able to identify up to 1800 deaths in Mulungu with a global mortality rate of 12,86 per 1000 inhabitants and 1743 deaths in Idjwi equivalent to a global mortality rate of 8.83 per 1000 inhabitants. Bivariable analysis showed that the odds of death were 45% higher in Mulungu than in Idjwi (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.36-1.55; P < 0.001).",

Inappropriate use of drug may be one of the factors of this below-average performance.Aim To assess the use of drugs in the management of uncomplicated malaria in Public Health Centres and General Hospital of DR Congo.Methods In each of the former 11 provinces of DRC, one Rural Health Centre, one Urban Health Centre and one General hospital were selected. In each of them, 100 patient's files containing treatment with antimalarials were randomly selected among the files of patients treated from January to December 2013. Among them, all of the files with diagnosis of uncomplicated malaria were selected. Descriptive statistics were used to describe usual prescription habits for malaria case management.Results A total of 3254 (98.6%) files were usable, of which 2300 (71%) concerned uncomplicated malaria. Biological confirmation of malaria was requested in 63% (1448/2300) of cases. Malaria treatment was initiated following negative results in 11% (252/2300) and positive results in 52% (1185, /2300) of cases. Thirty-one different treatment regimen were used. The drugs recommended by National Malaria Control Program (Artesunate-Amodiaquine or Artemether-Lum efantrine) were used in 55.1% (1267/2300) of cases. A part from antimalarial, 7143 drugs (average of 3.1 drugs per patient) were prescribed, among which antibiotics including Chloramphenicol, antalgics and NSAIDs including Dipyrone, vitamins, antihelminthics, corticosteroids, iron, and blood transfusion. Indication for theses concomitant medication was not available in 51.4% (3672/ 7143) of cases.Conclusion Management of uncomplicated malaria in DRC is characterized by numerous treatment regimen with low adherence to treatment policy and abundant concomitant polymedication. Determinant and consequences of this irrational use of drugs need to be assessed.",

Oliver 2 1 UCL Institute of Education, London, United Kingdom; 2 EPPI Centre, London, United Kingdom Introduction Health outbreaks are usually given in developing countries where there is not enough capacity to confront it, and there is a high risk of spreading and become a global threat. After the experience of Ebola, the United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization (WHO) created the Global Response to Health Crisis and the Health Emergencies Program respectively, in order to lead the creation of rapid responses and collaborate to strengthen health systems for future health outbreaks with humanitarian consequences. However, evidence shows that gender inequality increases during the outbreak situating women at higher risk.So, this study aims to make a systematic review of the research generated in relation to the gender inequalities in healthcare access during the last epidemic outbreaks that were considered as Public Health Emergencies of International Concern: Ebola and Zika. I will compare both outbreaks considering that Ebola was the breaking point for the improvement of the rapid responses among the international institutions and governments, and that Zika affects directly to pregnant women and newborns. This comparative analysis will give a panorama of how health access and care was considered for women-or notin the rapid response.Aim I aims to answer how well are rapid responses considering gender inequalities in access to healthcare during health emergencies?Methods It is a Systematic Review with a configurative (qualitative) and aggregated (quantitative) approach. This methodology provides evidence to help policy makers and practitioners in their decisions as it systematize all the information that already exists. It helps establish what is already known and what is not known from research.

It has a broad spectrum of clinical presentations and exposures; traditionally risk is linked to water-related incidents or activities (e.g., floods, rafting), but often no clear exposure risk is identified. Since the 1950's, an increasing incidence of imported leptospirosis has been observed in the Netherlands; from 2005-2008, 51.3% of all cases was imported.Aim To characterize the epidemiological characteristics of returned travellers with leptospirosis in the Netherlands in the period 2009-2016, and to describe the clinical profile of returned travelers with confirmed leptospirosis presenting at a tertiary referral center in the Netherlands (AMC) in the same period.Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed. In the Netherlands, leptospirosis is a mandatory reportable disease; the Leptospirosis Reference Center (NRL) confirms~99% of all suspected cases in the Netherlands. Epidemiologic and diagnostic data of all import cases diagnosed at the NRL between 1 January 2009 and 1 September 2016 was analysed; clinical features of patients diagnosed with travel-related leptospirosis at the AMC were retrieved, anonymised, and analysed. The data is currently being updated to cover the whole of 2016.Results Out of 344 cases of leptospirosis diagnosed at the NRL, 181 (52.6%) were travel-related. The majority of patients was male (76.2%), with a median age of 31 (8-77). The majority of patients had visited Southeast Asia (64.1%), or Europe (12.2%). Thailand (40.9%) was the most visited country; other 'hot-spots' were Malaysia, Indonesia, Cuba, Costa Rica, and France. Exposure risks were known in half of the cases; 96.7% (n = 88) reported exposure to fresh water. In the AMC, 33 patients were diagnosed with travel-related leptospirosis. Common symptoms at presentation were fever, headache, myalgia and nausea; one patient presented with an orchitis. Severe manifestations were pulmonary haemorrhage (n = 1), meningitis (n = 4), and renal failure (14 patients, 42.4%). No patients needed dialysis, none died.Conclusion Leptospirosis occurrence in returning travelers in the Netherlands continues to increase. In any traveler presenting with unspecified febrile illness, it should be considered. Early treatment can reduce the risk for adverse outcomes. Methods Retrospective analysis of data collection using childhood TB registers (0-13 years old) and treatment cards in a rural Ethiopian hospital. Information was collected on number of cases, type of TB and treatment outcomes using standardized definitions. 40.1% of the patient were admitted to the hospital and the rest were managed as outpatients. Under five patients are admitted more often than the older child (58% vs. 42%; P = 0.01) The percentage of treatment defaulters was 13.5%. The mortality rate was 4.2% and was the same for under or over five. Material and Methods It is a crosssectional study which took place from September 2015 to February 2016 in the city of Kinshasa. In the first part of this study, we analyzed 184 serums of children aged from 0 to 10 years old by Elisa Technique. Serum was obtained from INRB (National Public Health Laboratory) serum bank and screened for IgG to H. pylori. In the second part, we analyzed by immunochromatography technique on cassette (SD Bio line), 417 samples of saddles collected in Kinshasa households with children aged from 0 to 10 years and screened them to look for H. pylori antigens.",

Socio-demographic and health information was collected with a questionnaire administered to the child's primary caregiver. Cognitive development was assessed in a random sample of 880 children with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III (WPPSI-III).Results Standardized IQ scores from the WPPSI-III at five years of age were much lower than the reference population (whose scores follow a normal distribution (mean = 100; standard deviation = 15)). The mean (sd) IQ score in our cohort was 77.1 (10.8) with 87.8% of children considered to be below average and 20.6% considered to have extremely low development. In multivariable linear regression analyses, earlylife variables that were associated with decreased WPPSI-III scores include: low socio-economic status (b (95% confidence interval (CI)) = \u00c01.54 (\u00c02.24, \u00c00.85)), stunting at one year of age (b (95% CI) = \u00c02.59 (\u00c04.51, \u00c00.68)) and continued breastfeeding at one year of age (b (95% CI) = \u00c03.38 (\u00c05.89, \u00c00.87)).

Similarly, around 20% children of Tamil Nadu compared to around 50% children of Bihar and Jammu & Kashmir were stunted. We found a significant geographical clustering in childhood undernutrition across north part of the country. This clustering is associated with underdevelopment of the area, agricultural productivity, and environment.Conclusion Despite the ambitious \"mid-day meal\" program to reduce undernutrition among school going children -India remains home of huge number of undernourished child. Moreover, there is considerable geographical variation across the states and districts. While the SDG 2 calls for improving nutrition and ending hunger; this study timely provides evidence on extent of undernutrition in the country. Addressing the undernutrition, India needs area specific intervention to improve childhood nutritional status.

            "text": "The Adolescent Health Policy outlines a holistic approach and stresses the need for youth friendly services, training of teachers and health workers to teach sexuality education. However, there was no evidence of policy implementation in Mbarara district. Non-implementation appears to arise primarily, but by no means exclusively, from the socially-embedded cultural-religious norms that are hostile to \"comprehensive\" sexuality education, which is widely deemed to be socially alien, culturally unacceptable; or even injurious to the African value systems. Indeed, public discussion of sexuality is still considered \"taboo\". While field research suggests that the inadequacy of finances; the poor coordination between the relevant ministries; the weak monitoring and regulatory frameworks, and the short-term oriented donor support, are important, they seem to be secondary explanations -. The primary explanation we contend lies in the deeply embedded social norms and values. Result Women were not only housewives, but also active members of the labour force on the sugarcane plantations, working throughout their pregnancies up to their due dates. Although home deliveries were mainly conducted by Japanese/ Okinawan TBAs up to the 1940's, by the second generation births were generally overseen by professionals at hospitals. This transition of delivery started nearly 20 years earlier than in Japan and 30 years earlier than in Okinawa. These members of the diaspora were generally well adapted to Hawaii possibly because a few Japanese/Okinawan health professionals also migrated and integrated traditional practices with modern healthcare for the immigrants.With limited financial resources, the mothers depended on the support and protection of their communities to get through the perinatal period and to raise their babies.Conclusion One of the elements that contributes to the first generation of a diaspora successfully settling in the newly habituated community might be the presence of health professionals from their home-country, with whom they can use their mother tongue when asking about health problems and who can harmonize the health-related habits of the immigrants, i.e., Japanese and Okinawan immigrants in Hawaii. In such circumstances, mothers could more easily survive the lifethreatening maternal life stage even in non-habituated settings. Methods In this study, all patients with scorpion sting reviewed and our needed data recorded. A questionnaire including demographic, epidemiologic and clinical data was completed for the patients. The frequencies of entomoepidemiological and medical parameters were converted to the percentage rank.Results There were 780 scorpion victims. Scorpion stings were more prevalent in July (19.4%). The most relative frequency of scorpion stings were in rural areas (58.1%). The most stung organs were hands, with 50%. Most of the cases were males (55%) in the 21-30 age groups (25.2%). About 73.7% of the sufferers slept indoors and on the ground. Nearly 74.1% of envenomed cases were due to yellow scorpions. Clinical signs and symptoms were both local and systemic. The majority of cases (43%) were housewives. The stings mainly occurred at night between 12-18 (28%) when the victims were asleep.Conclusion Due to dangerous complication of scorpion sting, it is suggested that members of families especially these families residing in villages and around of cities be in instructed about taking care people, observing immunity measures and using suitable clothes and shoes at night. Introduction Pediculosis (louse infestation), a parasitic disease, used as an important factor to determine health status of a community. It mainly affects schoolchildren aged between 3 and 12 years. Head lice infestation prevalence rates of 5.8% to 35% have been reported from different regions in different institutions. In Iran, its prevalence was reported between 1.6% and 13.4% from some cities with various sociodemographic backgrounds.Aim This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on the patients with head lice infestation who referred to the health Methods The kind of research was descriptive-cross sectional and the manner of sampling was cluster random sampling. This descriptive-practical research was done in Zarrin-dasht County for bio ecology of scorpions. The specimens of scorpions were captured by rock-rolling, black light and also burrow excavation methods. Methods The genotyping of HCV strains was conducted by amplification of a partial NS5b and/or the Core/E1 Junction gene by nested RT-PCR, followed by nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic study. We also compared our strains by blast with other Tunisian strains previously published in GenBank.",

At each of the three different facilities surveyed, 158 respondents were interviewed. Data was collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square, Logistic regression were used to analyse quantitative data at 5% level of significance.Results About 82.5% of respondents used IPTp. Reasons given for non-use include, the drug not being offered or prescribed 34.9%, late/poor attendance to ANC 15.7%, \"just don't want to use\"18.1%, being afraid of complications 9.6%, non-availability of the drug at the ANC 9.6%, forgetfulness 9.6% and the drug could cause weakness 2.4%. Non-use of IPTp was highest among the THC attendees (21.5%) followed by the PHC attendees (18.%). About 50.8% had a poor perception on IPTp-SP and 42.6% had good knowledge on malaria and IPTp-SP. Good knowledge about IPTp-SP (OR = 6.0, 95% CI = 2.52-14.27) and irregular keeping of ANC appointment (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.17-0.76) were found to be statistically significantly associated with IPTp-SP use.Conclusions The use of IPTp-SP among many pregnant women in this study is encouraging. However, for Oyo state to achieve the Roll Back Malaria target of 0% non-use, the providers' practices must change positively and access as well as acceptability should be improved.

Prevalence varies across rural-urban dwellings with a tilt towards rural. There is paucity of data on the prevalence of anemia in most rural settings of northern Ghana.Aim We set out to determine the prevalence and factors associated with anemia among pregnant women at first antenatal care visits to the Navrongo War Memorial Hospital in 2014.Methods Records of pregnant women initiating antenatal clinic were systematically extracted analyzed and described. Maternal hemoglobin levels of pregnant women are measured to the nearest 0.1 g/dl using the SYSMEX KX-21N, Germany hematology analyzer at the hospital laboratory. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with anemia while adjusting for confounding effect of socio-demographic, anthropometric and relevant maternal obstetric characteristics.The study protocol was approved by the department of Community Health and Family Medicine, School of Medicine and Health Sciences (SMHS) of the University for Development Studies, Tamale.Results More than half (80%) of the 506 pregnant women were within the age groups 20-34 years, 13% were within the 35 + years and 7% were teenage pregnancies. Most of the pregnant women had their first antenatal clinic visit in the second trimester (49%) while 4% had their first visit in the third trimester. The prevalence of anemia among 506 pregnant women was 43% (95%CI 38.4-47.1) The median hemoglobin level was 11.1 g/dl (IQR 7.3-13.8). Prevalence of anemia was highest among mothers who booked at third trimester (55%, 95%CI 33.6-74.7), teenage pregnancies (52% 95%CI 34.9-67.8) and among grand multiparous women (58% 95%CI 30.7-81.6). Factors associated with anemia from logistic regression analysis included higher parity (OR = 0.7, 95%CI 0.44-1.03), higher gestational age (OR = 2.3, 95%CI 0.87-5.89) and higher BMI (OR = 3.2, 95%CI 1.19-8.32) at time of booking.Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality in eastern Sudan.Aim To investigate the prevalence rate of latent tuberculosis (LTB) and its associated factors during pregnancy using gamma interferon (IFN-c) release assay (IGRA).",

Organized screening programmes have contributed to lower the incidence of CC in countries where they have been established. In DRC, the prevalence of CC is still high due to the lack of effective screening programme.Aim This study aims at evaluating pitfalls at trying to implement a cervical cancer screening and HPV testing programme in a resource-constrained area.Methods We will review all human, logistical and environmental difficulties encountered during the conduct of Introduction Antenatal care (ANC) is recognized as an important determinant of pregnancy outcome. Studies in Vietnam showed that there is a high percentage of pregnant women attending ANC at least one time, but an inappropriate utilization of ANC services still remains. The evidence to which these services affect pregnancy outcome is not documented in South Vietnam.Aims The purpose of this study was to investigate the misuse of ANC services and its association with adverse outcomes.Methods We conducted a prospective community based cohort study in 17 communes in the district of Trang Bom within the Province Dong Nai, during 12 consecutive months. Data of pregnant women and their use of ANC services were collected using a structured questionnaire and medical records. Women were followed up to delivery. Misuse of ANC services, related factors and its association with adverse events were assessed using logistic regression.Results Out of 3301 pregnant women, 91% initiated ANC visit within first trimester, 95% attended at least 3 ANC visits, but a low percentage of pregnant women underwent blood test and urine test at least once (20% and 39%, respectively). Pregnant women who didn't undergo blood test and urine test were more likely to have an adverse outcome. Other factors significantly associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes were parity \u2265 3, ANC visits <3, history of adverse outcome, and having a clinical condition such as hypertension, diabetes. Blood test and urine test were less frequently undergone by young women, women from ethnic minority, women using only private facilities for ANC attendance, and a low number of ANC visits.Conclusion Despite a high percentage of early entry into ANC and of at least 3 ANC visits as recommended by Vietnam National Guidelines, misuse of ANC services still exists and contributes to adverse outcomes. There is a need to increase the awareness of women on the benefits of ANC services by educating young women as well as women having several children. Health workers should be encouraged to proposed suitable ANC services to pregnant women. Health insurance should consider the fee of each ANC services.",

The genotypes of HPV found were in order of importance as follows: HPV 53, 68, 45, 67, 18, 52, 58, 35, 66, 16, 51, 31, 39, 59. There are large discrepancies between these results and those for the Flanders community where the most prevalent genotype was HPV 16 and HPV 18 was only the 7th most frequent genotype.Conclusion HPV strains circulating in Kinshasa are different from those in Flanders. Taking into account that current commercially-available HPV vaccines target mainly the 16 and 18 genotypes, future vaccination dedicated for the Sub-Saharan Africa Region in general should integrate the most prevalent strains of the region if this tendency is finally confirmed through systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Introduction Uttar Pradesh (UP), India's most populous state, is also among the poorest performing on a number of critical reproductive and maternal health indicators. Despite a significant shift towards institutional deliveries and widespread access to 'proven' best practices, maternal mortality continues to remain alarmingly high. Currently the state is implementing several schemes to improve quality of care with proven implications on maternal and neonatal outcomes.Aim This study was undertaken to understand the status of provider and systems-level challenges in achieving quality of care.Methods We conducted 37 non-participant observations in two primary and seven secondary level public health facilities across 2 districts of UP. Observations were conducted at five stages -admission; pre-procedure; procedure; post-procedure and discharge -using a structured checklist by a team of two clinically trained nurses and one social scientist. The notes and completed checklists from each observation were thematically coded and analyzed to create a narrative description of the status of maternal and family planning care practices, gaps and challenges.Results Prominent themes appearing across most facilities included non-compliance with standard clinical procedures; compromised privacy on account of multiple procedures in a single designated labour room; demand for informal payments; patients forced to buy medical supplies from outside; verbal abuse during delivery process; lack of prompt attention, minimal interaction with patients and little or no counseling. Inadequate infrastructure and care led to patients leaving soon after delivery/procedure, thereby affecting post-procedure care.Conclusion Government and health professionals must address quality of care in order to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes. We recommend staff training and supervision to improve compliance with clinical procedures, patient-provider interaction and respectful care. Facility level quality improvement teams can be constituted to identify solutions tailored to facility needs. Patient helplines are essential to capture feedback on their experience of care. Evidence shows that quality has been assessed either from the users' or providers' perspective. A comprehensive understanding of expectations and perspectives of both users and providers respectively is essential for holistic improvement in quality of health care. In India, as far as public health facilities are concerned the quality of care has not witnessed as impressive improvements as with coverage and access to institutional care for delivery.Aim This study aims to assess the user's and care provider's perceptions of quality care to understand the common focus areas for quality improvement in public health facilities in India.",

The experience of two coffee cooperatives in the DR Congo Introduction For decades the eastern provinces of the DR Congo have been affected by massive and wide-spread sexual violence (SV). Two cooperatives in the South-Kivu took the initiative to actively identify members who survived rape, sexual slavery and abduction with the aim to refer them for medical care, psychosocial support and legal aid as well as to support their social reintegration. The SV initiatives were developed with support of a local NGO using a participatory approach for assessing the needs and the strategy to be followed. The SV interventions disposed of a limited budget, provided by a Belgian donor, and had a duration of one year.Aim To highlight the importance of a community-based approach to sexual violence as a prerequisite for ensuring aid effectiveness.Methods This paper is the result of the qualitative evaluation of the SV initiative of the coffee cooperatives.

Support for income-generating activities largely contributed to the recovering of self-esteem. 33 women received legal aid, but none of the cases were withheld by the court. The cooperatives keep on identifying new cases in need of support, but cannot attend them because they are not eligible for support by the running SV programmes in the region.Conclusion Proximity appears to be a key factor in breaking the silence and building a relationship of trust and respect with the survivors, their family and the community. In order to increase aid effectiveness in the area of SV prevention, donors should rethink their approach and be more flexible in the identification of local partners and beneficiary organisations.",

This study will contribute to better understand the process of monitoring maternal deaths at the operational level and to identify barriers to the compliance with the national standards. The factors that influence the utilisation of MDSS data could also be identified and the recommendation for optimal utilisation will be developed.Introduction There have been enormous improvements in maternal and child mortality and in utilisation of facility-based health care services in Cambodia during the last decades. Maternal mortality ratio drops from 484 (2000) to 161 (2015) per 100,000 live births. Deliveries assisted by skilled birth attendants was 89% (2014) at the national level, therefore, it is practically 100% in urban areas. However, quality of care during delivery process in public health facility is still not clearly described yet. Our main concern is to what extent potentially harmful practices, which negatively alter physiological process of childbirth, is performed.Aim We aim to describe practices during labour and delivery and to evaluate if there is any relationship between the acts and conditions of newborn infants immediately after birth.Methods Direct observation of pregnant women and health care providers from the admission until birth in eight public first-line health centres in Phnom Penh city was carried out. We employed eighteen external midwives as the observers. All the care and medical interventions from health care providers to the women were recorded. Umbilical arterial blood samples were collected by the observers for pH measurement (UA-pH) in order to assess foetal acidosis.Results 304 singleton delivery cases were observed. UA-pH data was obtained from 251 cases. 68% of women did not receive foetal heart rate check-up during the observation. Potentially harmful medical acts were frequently observed: Valsalva manoeuver (79%) and supine position during the second stage of labour (100%). These may disturb uteroplacental blood circulation and ultimately cause foetal acidosis. Median and inter-quartile range of UA-pH were 7.264 and 7.211-7.296, respectively. Proportion of acidosis (UA-pH less than 7.20) was 20.5%.",

Patients discharged against medical advice were excluded. We considered as cause of hospitalization the diagnosis related to the symptoms on admission. Diagnostic criteria were based on criteria described in WHO guidelines. ADE were defined as diseases corresponding to WHO stage 4 or category C of CDC classification.Results 252 hospital admissions of PLHIV out of 6187 (4.07%, 95%CI: 3.6-4.6) were recorded during the study period. Hospital admission of PLHIV increased from 0.7% (95%CI: 0.2-1.2) in 2010 to 11.2% (95% CI: 8.8-13.6) of total admission in 2016. 236 hospital admissions matching to 178 PLHIV were included in the study. Median age at admission was 37 years (IQR: 30-45) with 63.6% (n = 150) of men. HIV was diagnosed during hospital admission in 93/236 (39.4%). Duration of symptoms before admission was \u2265 4 weeks in 32.2% (n = 76). Median CD4 at admission was 119 per mm 3 (IQR: 58-222.75).

Non-ADE were mostly caused by infections (n = 22). In multivariate logistic regression, ADE were associated with patients who were not on ART at admission (OR = 2.2, 95%CI: 1.0-4.5), persistent fever (OR = 4.3, 95% CI: 2.1-9.0), duration of symptoms\u2265 4 weeks (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.3-5.5) and CD4 < 200/mm 3 at admission (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.7-7.4).

Methods We investigated key obstacles for expanded ART initiation and retention in care in WCA, focusing on contexts where MSF provides HIV services, including three in-depth case studies (DRC, CAR, Guinea). Systematic review of key indicators for ART coverage, enabling factors and alternatives strategies was done, an overview of acceleration plans of key countries in the region and the international support provided to them.Results Effective, timely and quality HIV-services continue to be hampered by frequent stock-outs, financial barriers and lack of staff motivation. Relatively lower HIV prevalence decreases priority for government and international actors, with low interest from bilateral donors, in particular European member states, Global Fund being the main or only funding source. Reluctance to task shifting, longer periods of drug refills, community service monitoring prevails but figure as priority measures in the acceleration action plans.Conclusion Governments and international actors need to step up fast track responses to close treatment gaps by adapting existing approaches. Urgent mobilization of all health actors is needed to mitigate barriers to ART initiation and adherence, including ensure HIV testing and treatment free of charge for all PLHIV, decentralized & simplified ART provision, task-shifting, guaranteeing uninterrupted supply of HIV-commodities. Methods Two hundred and nine (209) blood and faecal samples were collected for four months. The serum samples were tested for anti-toxoplasma antibodies using Enzyme linked Immunosorbent assay while the faecal sample were examined for enteric parasites by microscopy.

Associations were observed between seropositivity to toxoplasmosis and age, occupation, education, marital status, HAART status, raw meat consumption.Conclusion There is a high burden of coccidial infections among women in Lagos and routine screening for these infection is recommended.Introduction Malawi has a high maternal mortality rate and unsafe abortion is one of the top five causes of maternal death. Incomplete abortion is a common complication after abortion, which can be treated surgically or medically. In the first trimester, manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) is the preferred surgical method because it is safer and cheaper. Still, many hospitals in Malawi continue using curettage, which requires more resources and leads to more complications. Some hospitals in Malawi use little or no MVA in spite of recommendations from WHO and Malawi Ministry of Health.Aim The aim of this study was to investigate if an intervention of training health staff could increase the safer and cheaper method of MVA by 15%. Methods A prospective cross sectional assessment of the pre/ post use of MVA was performed at three public hospitals in Malawi. Health personnel at these hospitals were trained in MVA using theory and practice in April 2016. Two hospitals served as controls. Ethical approval was obtained from Malawian and Norwegian Ethics Committees.Preliminary results In two of the hospitals, nearly no MVAs were done before the intervention. It increased shortly after training to 6.4% in one and 25% in the other. The referral hospital had fluctuations in the use of MVA. No MVA was done in the control district hospital, while data collection in the referral hospital is yet to be done.Conclusion This study investigated the treatment of incomplete abortion after an intervention. A significant increase has been achieved so far in one of the smaller hospitals. A limitation is that the intervention could have been extended, including more handson patients' training. However, the training was planned as a refresher, as all health personnel should have been taught MVA during their education. There may be other factors influencing the results. Focus group discussions were conducted with staff to understand their perceptions of the intervention. A constant rotation of staff and lack of equipment has been mentioned as major limiting factors to doing MVA.",

Together with the shift among women towards medical abortion practices health workers in Dar es Salaam reported experiencing fewer and more manageable abortion complications. However, the illegal context prohibits an open and informative sale of the drug and problematic access to post-abortion care.Conclusion In Dar es Salaam misoprostol has rapidly been adopted by women and abortion providers, offering women access to safe abortion and providers a tool to better meet women's needs. Access to misoprostol shifts power from clandestine abortion providers to women who gain greater control over their own body and fertility, but the unregulated market simultaneously leaves women to themselves with little guarantee for safety, and thus of unsafe abortion practices and post-abortion complications.

Inclusion criteria were \u22654 cm cervical dilatation and provided informed consent. Medical records including partographs were photographed. Quality of recording was determined through assessment of administrative and medical data. Administrative data concerned date, use of alert line, time intervals and line adherence (i.e. examinations and actions reported at one time are on the same line). Reliability of medical data was determined by comparing partographs with observations for assessment of completeness (sensitivity) and correctness (positive predictive value) of recorded time, examinations and actions. Sub-analysis by type of examinations was performed. Ethical approval for this study was obtained.",

DRC, the largest Sub-Saharan country, has many inaccessible regions due to geographical obstacles, lack of communication and other logistical issues. For outcome expectancies, all field and laboratory activities have to successfully overcome many challenges.Aims The aim was to produce and carry out a consistent, coordinated plan for all activities in the field, and attempt to replicate in various conditions. Methods From September 2015 to August 2016, we conducted 5 field trips for an Ebola antibody study in Boende, Bumba, and Yambuku. Challenges were to successfully conduct research activities under field constraints: rainy forest and harsh conditions such as natural obstacles, flooding, insect bites, lack of passable roads and bridges, lack of transport means, lack of electricity to run and charge electronic devices, and many others.Results Despite very challenging situations faced, we were able to construct a fully functional laboratory (including refrigerators, centrifugesrefrigerated, dry shippers, portable deep freezer (\u00c080C), tablets for data collection, and required materials) in 4 different places covering an area of 16,954Km 2 . The outcome was: 49 isolated viable PBMCs from Ebola survivors and HCW, and serum, plasma and buffy coat from over 1200 HCWs and questionnaire data.Conclusion Research and public health activities can reduce morbidity and mortality in resource-limited settings such as the DRC. Although DRC's size and geographical obstacles do not allow for easy field deployment, it is possible to deploy high quality field activities by creating consistent and sustained global plan. Once the plan is completed and replicated, valuable data can be produced despite suboptimal work conditions. Conclusions Cognitive and behavioural factors were found to be predictors of risky sexual behaviours for HIV. This highlights the importance of considering personal perception and reasoning when attempting to understand and influence individual's sexual behaviours. This could be done through enhancing awareness of HIV risk in the general population and other cognitive behaviour change interventions through community mobilization, advocacy and creating activities to improve self-esteem.
