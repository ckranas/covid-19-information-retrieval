Congenital defects (nasal septal deviations, choanal atresia, subepiglottic cysts, and hypoplastic lungs) are typically evident at birth, whereas other conditions, such as chronic bacterial pneumonia (Rhodococcus equi), may not be evident until the foal is older (1 to 3 months of age). Viral and bacterial upper respiratory tract infections tend to occur in the weanling and yearling, whereas conditions such as inflammatory airway disease, pleuropneumonia, or exercise-induced epistaxis are found more commonly in performance horses 2 years or older.

Does the farm have a history of endemic infections, as often occur with Streptococcus equi outbreaks? Has the horse been exposed to pastures grazed by donkeys? This, along with information regarding the diet (hay, pelleted rations, or pasture), the nature of the bedding materials (straw, peat, or shavings), and the amount of time the horse is stabled are important considerations in establishing the risk factors for some respiratory disorders such as recurrent airway obstruction or lungworm infections. One also should obtain the deworming and vaccination schedules. Young horses are at risk for developing verminous pneumonia resulting from Parascaris equorum migration. Nematode eggs can survive for prolonged periods on a pasture. Thus establishing whether the foal was exposed to pastures grazed by yearlings or 2-year-olds may help in establishing the diagnosis and treating the problems. If the horse is a performance animal and is at an increased risk for developing upper respiratory tract infections, one should determine how frequently equine influenza and equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV1) and type 4 (EHV4) vaccinations are administered.",

            "text": "The clinician should examine the horse during eupneic and hyperpneic (by use of a rebreathing bag) breathing patterns. Normal breath sounds are those produced by turbulent air movement through the tracheobronchial tree and vary in intensity and quality depending on the portion of the lung field auscultated. The vesicular sounds, over the middle and diaphragmatic lung lobes, are the quietest sounds; the bronchial sounds, over the trachea and the base of the lung, are the loudest. [4] [5] [6] In the normal horse one can hear breath sounds more easily on the right side than on the left. Considerable variation exists between normal patients in the intensity of the breath sounds. For example, vesicular sounds are often barely audible during eupneic (normal) breathing in the obese patient and are perceived as soft rustling sounds. However, one may hear breath sounds easily in the thin or young animal because of less attenuation of lung sounds by the chest wall. The intensity of breath sounds also increases with increased airflow. Thus breath sounds are accentuated in febrile or excited animals or in animals hyperpneic from a variety of causes (exercise, hypoxia, pain). However, auscultatory findings do not always correlate well with the degree of alveolar ventilation. 5 For example, in horses with lung consolidation the transmission of breath sounds from adjacent areas gives the false impression that that region is well ventilated. Breath sounds also may become more difficult to hear in cases of (1) alveolar overinflation in which the aerated tissue of the lung is a poor conduction medium of sound or (2) pneumothorax and pleural effusions in which the sound is reflected at the pleural surface (acoustic impedance). 5 Adventitious lung sounds are abnormal sounds superimposed on the normal breath sounds and have been described as crackles or wheezes. Crackles are short, explosive, discontinuous sounds that have been likened to the sound of salt thrown in a hot frying pan or the sound of cellophane being crumpled. They are usually of low intensity and are audible during the inspiratory phase of respiration. Their production has been attributed to the sudden equalization of pressure in two compartments after airways have reopened. Crackles are audible in cases of interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary edema (restrictive pulmonary diseases) and in cases of bronchopneumonia or airway diseases (obstructive disorders). Breathing 100% oxygen also may produce crackles because the nitrogen stent maintaining alveolar distention is eliminated. 7 Crackles are also audible in cases of subcutaneous emphysema. Wheezes are musical sounds thought to arise from the vibration of airway walls or tissue masses in close contact with the airway walls and may be audible during inspiration or expiration. Wheezes may be monophonic or polyphonic, the latter indicative of multiple sites of airway obstruction. Pleuritic friction rubs have been described as sandpaper-like sounds generated by the movement of the visceral and parietal pleurae across each other. One may detect them (infrequently) in the early stages of \"dry\" pleuritis, before the effusive stage.",

The cranial limit is the shoulder musculature, the dorsal limit is the back musculature, and the caudoventral limits are the seventeenth intercostal space at the level of the tuber coxae, the sixteenth intercostal space at the level of the tuber ischii, the thirteenth intercostal space at the midthorax, the eleventh intercostal space at the level of the scapulohumeral articulation, and the sixth intercostal space at the olecranon. 8 Thoracic percussion should not be painful: resentment by the horse may indicate pleuritis or rib fractures.

The site of the collection sample (tracheal versus bronchoalveolar) depends on the nature of the respiratory disorder. The appropriateness of using tracheal samples to evaluate chronic inflammatory disorders has been challenged, because little correlation exists between tracheal and bronchoalveolar lavage cytologic findings or between tracheal and pulmonary histopathologic findings. 18, 19 In contrast, a good correlation exists between bronchoalveolar lavage cytologic findings and pulmonary histopathologic findings. 20 Bronchoalveolar lavage is indicated in the investigation of chronic inflammatory diseases but may be performed with collection of transtracheal aspirates if one cannot dismiss an infectious process. Table 7 -1 shows representative cytologic findings from bronchoalveolar lavage studies of normal horses. Sedation of horses before bronchoalveolar lavage is recommended. Using a fiberoptic endoscope (permitting direct visualization of the lung segment to be lavaged) or using a thickwalled flexible tube with a cuffed end (which is passed blindly into the distal airways), the clinician instills 100 to 500 ml of physiologic saline solution within the pulmonary segment. One can retrieve 50% to 75% of the fluid and examine it cytologically. Before lavage, one may instill 20 to 40 ml of 2% lidocaine to desensitize the airways.",

The tracheobronchial aspirates of approximately 8% of normal horses (pastured or stabled) were found to be culture-positive for Klebsiella, \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci, Pasteurella species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For a microorganism to be implicated in a lower airway disorder, one would expect (1) to obtain a moderate to heavy growth of the organism on culture (\u22651 \u00d7 10 3 colonyforming units); (2) to identify organisms within phagocytic cells; and (3) to have evidence of degenerative neutrophils. In contrast, anaerobes, which are a normal component of the oropharyngeal flora, normally are not isolated from aspirates of healthy horses, emphasizing their importance in diseased processes when recovered from respiratory cases. Based on their studies, Sweeney, Beech, and Roby 24 also have described a group of transient bacterial flora of questionable pathogenicity such as Enterobacter, Bacillus, Acinetobacter, \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci (except for Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3), and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which may be isolated from tracheobronchial aspirates.

However, compared with human or small animal medicine, in which correlations between the pulmonary disorders and the radiographic findings are well-established, the radiographic changes in equine respiratory disorders tend to be rather nonspecific. In addition, many pulmonary diseases such as inflammatory airway disease, exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, lungworm infections, and recurrent airway obstruction may be associated with normal radiographs. 29 Four types of radiographic patterns have been described: an alveolar (airspace), an interstitial, a bronchial, and a vascular pattern. In the alveolar pattern, opaque areas coalesce and completely obliterate the vessels and bronchi. Air bronchograms may be notable. This pattern occurs with pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, lung consolidation, or neoplastic infiltration. Interstitial patterns are found most commonly and are associated with a variety of conditions. This pattern causes a blurring of the edges of the pulmonary vessels, a diffuse increase in lung opacity, and variable reticular, linear, or nodular opacities. 29, 30 A reticular pattern occurs with viral, bacterial, or parasitic pneumonia; pulmonary edema; interstitial pneumonia; and pulmonary fibrosis. An irregular linear pattern occurs with resolving bronchopneumonia, and a nodular pattern occurs with abscesses, granulomata, or neoplasms. Bronchial patterns alone are not found commonly but usually occur in association with interstitial patterns. Paired linear opacities or numerous small circular opacities represent thickening of the large-and mediumsized airways or of the septa around the lobules. This pattern occurs in cases of equine bronchitis and bronchiolitis. Variations in the size, shape, and number of the pulmonary vessels cause a vascular pattern and may be visible in horses following exercise or in horses with left-to-right cardiac shunts. Extraparenchymal disorders that are evident radiographically include the presence of free pleural fluid or of free gas (pneumothorax) represented by the separation of the right or left or both caudal lung lobes from the dorsal and dorsolateral body wall by a free-air density.",

Abnormal pleural fluid accompanies numerous respiratory disorders, including pulmonary abscessation (pleuropneumonia), chronic pneumonia, systemic mycoses, neoplasia, pulmonary granulomata, and equine infectious anemia. One may perform the technique easily at the sixth or seventh intercostal space approximately 10 cm dorsal to the olecranon by aseptically inserting a teat cannula through an anesthetized site in the intercostal space, just cranial to the border of the rib. To reduce the amount of air aspirated into the pleural cavity, one attaches a three-way stopcock to the cannula. The clinician should take samples from both sides of the thorax and submit the aspirate for cytologic and microbiologic examination. One may obtain up to 100 ml of pleural fluid, although smaller amounts (10 to 30 ml) are more routine. 34 Normal pleural aspirates contain less than 10,000 nucleated cells per \u00b5l (60% of which are neutrophils) and less than 2.5 g/dl of protein. Samples should be cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Fluid with a putrid odor is associated with anaerobic bacteria and carries a less favorable prognosis for the horse. 35 ",

Using \u03b3-emitting radioisotopes such as krypton-81m or technetium-99m, the clinician can assess pulmonary ventilation and perfusion in the horse. 36, 37 The horse, breathing through a closed circuit, inhales aerosolized technetium particles generated by a nebulizer. Aerosolized particles are of sufficiently small diameter to be deposited in the alveoli and small airways. Thus their distribution mirrors ventilation. A gamma camera records the sites of deposition within the lung fields. For the perfusion scan, one injects technetium-labeled macroaggregated albumin intravenously. The large protein particles lodge in the blood capillaries of the lung, enabling imaging of the pulmonary perfusion by the gamma camera. Hence lung scintigraphy permits evaluation of the ratio of regional ventilation to perfusion (V . /Q . ) not possible by radiography or ultrasonography. Scintigraphic images may provide additional insights into the diagnosis and pathogenesis of such disorders as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) or in the evaluation of the horse with poor performance. 38, 39 For example, horses with EIPH appears to have a perfusion deficit in the caudodorsal lung lobe that results in a high V/Q area. 38 Horses with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may produce several patterns, including V/Q deficits in the costophrenic angle (caudoventral diaphragmatic margin), ventilation deficits in the middorsal lung area, or patterns similar to those seen in EIPH. 40 In addition to assessment of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion, scintigraphy can show tracheal mucus transport after intratracheal injection of technetium. One performs the technique by timing the movement of the radioactive bolus over a given tracheal distance. 41, 42 Normal values for the unsedated horse range from 16.6 to 20.7 mm/min. Further studies are needed to examine alterations in tracheal mucus transport during disease. For further information, the reader is referred to additional reviews. 40",

            "text": "Measurements of lung volumes, pleural (esophageal) pressure changes, and airflow, coupled with nitrogen washout studies and arterial blood gas determinations, have been used to assess horses with pulmonary disease. Pulmonary function testing requires that the horse wear a breathing apparatus to which an airflow meter has been attached. Pleural pressure changes occurring during each breath are estimated by catheters placed in the midesophagus, exteriorized through the nares, and attached to pressure transducers. By integrating airflow relative to time, one obtains the inspiratory and expiratory volumes. Additional parameters obtained from measurements of airflow include inspiratory and expiratory times, breathing frequency, and peak airflows. In general, the simple measurement of tidal volume, breathing frequency, or minute volume (the product of tidal volume and breathing frequency) provides limited information regarding the functionality of the lung, because these values tend to be maintained near normal limits until the respiratory disease is advanced. 43 Measures of lung distensibility (dynamic compliance) and airway obstruction (pulmonary resistance) provide more meaningful information regarding pulmonary health. One measures dynamic compliance (C dyn ) by dividing the tidal volume by the change in pleural pressure occurring between the start and end of inhalation. One measures pulmonary resistance by several different techniques, depending on whether one measures the resistance at peak airflow or at specific ventilatory volumes (e.g., 50% tidal volume), and calculates it by dividing airflow by the change in pleural (esophageal) pressure. Alterations in these two values can provide information on the nature of the lung disorder. For example, in obstructive disorders of the tracheobronchial tree, dynamic compliance decreases and pulmonary resistance increases. A decrease in dynamic compliance in the absence of a change in pulmonary resistance suggests that the lung parenchyma has been stiffened by alveolar disease or by obstruction of the peripheral bronchioles. (One may recall that peripheral bronchioles, because of their immense cross-sectional area, contribute little to the resistance of breathing until the disorder is well advanced.) Conversely, an increase in pulmonary resistance in the absence of a change in dynamic compliance suggests that the obstruction exists in the upper airway, trachea, or bronchus. 44 Currently, measures of airway hyperreactivity in horses are becoming more routine at referral centers. [45] [46] [47] In this technique, one determines the dosage of a nebulized bronchoconstrictor agent, such as histamine or methacholine, that causes a 35% increase in baseline respiratory resistance or a 35% decrease in baseline lung compliance. As might be predicted, the dosage to achieve this in a horse with inflammatory airway disease or recurrent airway disease is much smaller than that needed to achieve a similar effect in a healthy horse. Measurement of airway hyperreactivity requires that the horse be sedated and outfitted with an airtight breathing mask. Laboratory assistants should wear protective masks to prevent inhalation of the bronchoconstrictor agent.",

            "text": "Anatomic Considerations Six pairs of sinuses communicate with the nasal cavity in the horse: the dorsal, middle, and ventral conchal and the maxillary, frontal, and sphenopalatine. 52 The conchal sinuses, extensions of the turbinates, communicate with the frontal (dorsal conchal) or maxillary sinuses (middle and ventral conchal). However, most clinically important conditions involve the maxillary and frontal sinuses. The sinuses are lined by a respiratory epithelium-pseudostratified ciliated columnar-interspersed with goblet cells and underlying serous glands. 53 The maxillary sinus is divided into a rostral and caudal compartment by a bony oblique septum. In most horses the division is complete so that no communication exists between the two compartments. Each compartment communicates with the middle nasal meatus by the nasomaxillary opening, a narrow slit that is occluded easily during inflammation of the mucosa. This process leads to retention of exudate within the sinuses. In horses less than 5 years of age, the last three cheek teeth-the first, second, and third molars-occupy most of the maxillary sinus. As the horse ages and the residual root decreases, the sinus cavity enlarges. The larger frontal sinus communicates with the caudal compartment of the maxillary sinus via the frontomaxillary opening, thus establishing a natural drainage route of the frontal sinus with the nasal cavity. 54 Causes Primary sinusitis or empyema reflects accumulation of exudate within the sinus cavities and is a sequela of viral or bacterial upper respiratory tract infections. Streptococcal (and rarely staphylococcal) organisms are the usual bacterial isolates. Secondary sinusitis (empyema) of the maxillary sinus usually is associated with dental disorders such as fractured teeth, patent infundibula, and alveolar periostitis. The first molar is the most commonly involved tooth. However, secondary sinusitis may follow traumatic head injuries or the development of congenital paranasal cysts. The latter usually are found in the maxillary sinus but also have been identified in the frontal sinus. 55, 56 Neoplasms associated with secondary sinusitis include squamous cell carcinoma (most common), osteogenic sarcoma, lymphosarcoma, myxoma, osteoma, sarcoids, neurofibroma, and mast cell tumor. 57, 58 Although rare, fungal granulomata induced by Cryptococcus neoformans and Coccidioides immitis may cause secondary sinusitis. 59, 60 Progressive hematomas also may occur in the maxillary sinus. 57 Clinical Signs Clinical signs depend on the inciting agent, its location, and the chronicity of the disorder. A unilateral nasal discharge suggests unilateral sinus involvement; a bilateral nasal exudate suggests that the right and left sinuses are involved. Sinusitis following dental disease or invasive neoplastic masses is characterized by a purulent foul-smelling and persistent nasal discharge, whereas a serosanguineous exudate is more typical of sinus cysts, slowly growing neoplasms, and certain stages of mycotic granulomata and hematomas. Inflammatory reactions of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, teeth, and bones may produce facial asymmetry. When sinus inflammation extends into the periorbital region, exophthalmos may ensue. Other clinical signs associated with sinusitis include breathing difficulties, epistaxis, epiphora, headshaking, weight loss, and neurologic signs if the sinusitis extends through the cribriform plate and causes meningoencephalitis. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on the history of the disorder, the age of the animal, and the nature of the clinical signs. Percussion of the sinuses may reveal dullness. Endoscopic examination helps to eliminate other potential sources of nasal discharge and demonstrates the presence of an exudate from the nasomaxillary opening, visualized from the middle meatus just proximal to the ethmoids. This visualization confirms that the exudate originates from the sinus compartment. One may further define the sinus disorder by sinuscopy or computed tomography scan. The clinician always should conduct a thorough oral examination of the upper dental arcade even if it requires short-acting anesthesia. The presence of fractured or displaced teeth, receding gum lines, exudate around a specific tooth, or patent infundibula suggests that dental disease is the cause of the disorder. Lateral and dorsoventral radiographs are helpful in diagnosing sinusitis and may demonstrate single or multiple horizontal fluid-air interfaces, abnormalities of the teeth, lysis of alveolar bone, or a combination of these (Figures 7-6 and 7-7). Nuclear scintigraphy may indicate increased uptake of radioisotope around an infected tooth root. 61 Neoplastic lesions may be visible radiographically as loculated or diffuse soft tissue densities. Culture and cytologic examination of the sinus fluid or biopsy of the tissue mass is helpful in the diagnosis, although differentiating between a neoplastic or dysplastic process or inflammatory reaction may be difficult. Tumors may vary in consistency but usually have gelatinous areas mixed with combinations of cysts and solid tissue (fibrous tissue). 62 Treatment Treatment requires surgical removal of the affected teeth or tumorous or granulomatous tissue and establishment of adequate drainage. Extensive flushing of the sinuses has been recommended until the trephine sites have healed. Surgical removal of paranasal cysts has been associated with a favorable prognosis, 56 whereas fungal granulomata and neoplasms have a poor prognosis. With neoplastic lesions, surgical resection or ablation apparently achieves a low rate of success because of extensive infiltration of the neoplasm or recurrence of the tumor. 58, 62 Ethmoid Hematomas Definition Ethmoid hematomas are encapsulated, expansive angiomatous masses that appear to develop from the mucosal lining of the ethmoid conchae but also may originate from the walls of the maxillary and frontal sinus. The inciting factor in their development is not known. Some have speculated that ethmoid hematomas develop following chronic infection, repeated episodes of hemorrhage, or congenital or neoplastic conditions. 63 They appear bilaterally in 50% of the cases and are more prevalent in older horses. 64 Clinical Signs Clinical signs include intermittent unilateral discharge consisting of frank blood or serous or mucopurulent exudates. Stertorous breathing because of obstruction of nasal air flow also may occur. 63 Clinical signs also may include facial swelling, exophthalmos, malodorous breath, headshaking, and coughing. 59 Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on the clinical signs, endoscopic examination, radiographic evaluation, and in some cases computed tomography scan. Confirmation of a diagnosis is by histopathologic study of the removed tissue. Endoscopy (see Figure 7 -2) reveals a yellow, yellowgreen, yellow-gray, red to red-purple smooth glistening mass originating from the ethmoid region. 63 One also may note petechial hemorrhages or surface erosions. The mass may protrude beyond the nasal septum (and in those cases may cause a bilateral nasal discharge). Radiographs reveal a space-occupying soft tissue density with smooth margins. Single or multilobular rounded opacities may be visible radiographically in the ventral aspect of the caudal maxillary sinus superimposed on the ethmoid turbinates. The ethmoid hematoma in some cases may extend dorsally into the frontal sinus (Figure 7-8 ). Treatment Treatment options include surgical resection, cryosurgery, laser ablation, and formalin injection. Surgical removal is associated with extensive hemorrhage, and surgery may require blood transfusions. A preoperative crossmatch is warranted, and the horse may require a postoperative tracheotomy if one uses extensive packing of the nasal cavity to effect hemostasis. Antimicrobials and antiinflammatory agents are indicated. Following surgical removal, approximately 20% to 50% of the hematomas recur. 63, 64 Postoperative complications may include facial wound dehiscence, suture periostitis, facial bone sequestration, persistent nasal discharges, fungal sinus plaque formation, and encephalitis. 65 Transendoscopic injection of lesions with formalin is an alternative to surgical resection, particularly for smaller lesions. Most cases require multiple injections. 66 Severe complications also may ensue if the cribriform plate is fenestrated, allowing communication of the ethmoidal hematoma with the cranial vault. 67",

            "text": "Definition Tympany is a nonpainful distention of the guttural pouch by air that may produce an external swelling in the parotid region. Congenital tympany occurs in young foals (predominantly fillies), and acquired tympany usually affects older horses. 70 Pathogenesis The cause of congenital guttural pouch tympany is unknown. An abnormal mucosal flap at the pharyngeal orifice has been proposed to function as a unidirectional valve, trapping air or fluid within the pouch. Tympany is more likely a functional defect rather than an anatomic defect because no abnormality is visible endoscopically or during surgical exploration. Acquired tympany typically is associated with upper respiratory infection and is thought to be caused by swelling of tissues around the pharyngeal orifice, causing a one-way valve effect. This problem is transient, and rarely does pouch distention become severe. Clinical Signs Clinical signs depend on the degree of pouch distention and hence the degree of compression of the nasopharynx. If distention is significant, the foal may exhibit stertorous breathing, respiratory distress, dysphagia, nasal discharge, or evidence of pneumonia caused by aspiration. Regurgitation of milk from the nostrils also may be evident. 71 Endoscopic examination may reveal significant compression of the nasopharyngeal area because of distention of the pouches. Diagnosis Confirmation of diagnosis is by the presence of tympanitic swelling in the Viborg's pouch area. Radiographs reveal a large, air-filled guttural pouch with or without fluid accumulation (Figure 7 as to whether the problem is unilateral or bilateral can be difficult. Catheterization of one guttural pouch should correct the problem if a unilateral tympany exists. Dorsoventral radiographic views may help in diagnosing bilateral involvement. Treatment Guttural pouch tympany requires surgical correction. For unilateral tympany, one performs fenestration of the median septum separating the two guttural pouches by conventional surgery or transendoscopic laser surgery. Bilateral involvement may necessitate resection of the excessive plica salpingopharyngeal flap. 72 Because many cultures of the pouches yield \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci and the potential for the development of aspiration pneumonia exists, administration of antimicrobials is justified. 70 The prognosis for uncomplicated cases of guttural pouch tympany is favorable.",

The condition may be unilateral or bilateral. Clinical Signs Clinical signs include a white nonodorous nasal discharge (unilateral or bilateral), lymphadenopathy, painful distention in the parotid region, stertorous breathing, dysphagia, and occasionally epistaxis. 71 Inspissation of the material may occur with chronic infections, forming masses called chondroids.

Treatment may entail medical and surgical modalities. Aggressive lavage of the guttural pouch with saline solutions and the administration of systemic antimicrobials is a first step in therapeutic management. 73 One may attempt removal of chondoids with an endoscopic snare, avoiding the complications or risk of surgery and minimizing the cost of treatment. 74 Surgery may be necessary if medical therapy is unsuccessful. 71",

The plaques are associated closely with the underlying vascular structures, the internal and external carotid arteries, or the external maxillary artery. 75 Pathogenesis The events leading to the formation of fungal plaques are not known.

            "text": "Definition Acute inflammation of the lymphoid (and surrounding) tissues in the pharynx is termed pharyngitis. The condition occurs with equine influenza, EHV1, EHV2, and EHV4 and with Streptococcus equi infections. Acute pharyngitis also may develop with prolonged nasogastric intubation. Chronic inflammation of the pharynx, also termed pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphoid follicular hyperplasia, and pharyngeal folliculitis, is a condition frequently observed in weanlings to performance horses 2 to 3 years of age. 86 Causes The cause of chronic pharyngitis is not known but probably is multifactorial. Many horses have a history of upper respiratory tract infections, causing some clinicians to speculate that lymphoid hyperplasia is a sequela of chronic antigenic stimulation. The condition has been reproduced experimentally with inoculation of EHV1 and EHV2. 87, 88 The severity of the pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia does not correlate with EHV1 titers or with the isolation of EHV2. 89 Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Moraxella species have been isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs of horses with lymphoid hyperplasia, but their role in the development of the lymphoid hyperplasia is also unknown. In one study the pharyngeal flora was similar in normal control horses and in those exhibiting grade I lymphoid hyperplasia. As the severity of the pharyngitis increased, the number of bacterial organisms that were isolated (colony-forming units per gram of swab material) also increased. 90 The contribution of husbandry factors to the development or maintenance of lymphoid hyperplasia also has been examined. Young horses that are stabled indoors have a more severe pharyngitis than when kept outdoors with access to a three-sided shelter. 91 Epidemiology An inverse relationship appears to exist between the age of the horse and the prevalence of pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia. Approximately 60% to 90% of 2-year-olds exhibit a grade II or more (Box 7-2). Between 35% and 65% of 3-and 4-year-olds and 10% to 20% of 5-year-olds still show grade II or greater lymphoid hyperplasia. With aging, lymphoid follicles regress and tend to disappear. Clinical Signs Some horses may show a nasal discharge and mild submandibular lymphadenopathy. Manipulation of the larynx may induce a cough. Unless severe, lymphoid hyperplasia has not been associated with poor performance or alterations in arterial blood gases. 92 Diagnosis Endoscopically, one observes raised hyperemic and edematous follicles distributed throughout the nasopharyngeal walls. Some follicles may have an ulcerated edge to them; others may appear thickened and fibrotic. Raker 93 proposed a gradation scheme based on the severity of the nodule formation, as outlined in Box 7-2. Histopathologic examination reveals lymphocytic proliferation and necrosis, the degree of which does not correlate with endoscopic findings. Treatment In the absence of a clear understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder, the most appropriate therapy has not been determined. One treatment that has been tried is nebulization (30 min/day) using an antiinflammatory solution (350 ml nitrofurazone, 125 ml dimethyl sulfoxide, and 500 mg prednisolone acetate). Stabling changes to reduce dust and mold exposure may be helpful.",

            "text": "Definition During respiration, the caudal free border of the soft palate normally occupies a position ventral to the epiglottis. This position reverses abruptly during swallowing as the palate moves dorsally and the epiglottis covers the adducted arytenoid cartilages and vocal folds. These motor activities ensure that food or saliva is directed dorsally into the esophagus and not into the trachea. 94 The positioning of the palate is complex, controlled in part by the palatine, the tensor, and the levator muscles, which are innervated by the trigeminal, vagus, and glossopharyngeal nerves, respectively. Intermittent or persistent malpositioning of the soft palate dorsal to the epiglottis is termed dorsal displacement of the soft palate (DDSP). 95 Causes On occasion, persistent displacement is evident endoscopically at rest. This finding may be associated with pharyngeal paralysis of numerous causes, but in the absence of signs of dysphagia, the condition often is caused by mechanical or inflammatory mechanisms that obliterate the subepiglottic space (subepiglottic cyst, epiglottitis, epiglottic entrapment, subepiglottic fibrosis, etc.). In most cases of DDSP, palate position is normal on resting and displacement occurs only during strenuous exercise. The cause of displacement in such cases is unclear. Formerly suggested mechanisms including excessively negative intrapharyngeal pressures, 96 excessive poll flexion, 97 epiglottic shortening, 98 and caudal retraction of the larynx by the sternothyrohyoideus 94 now appear largely unfounded. Recent studies have focused on palatal innervation and on factors controlling the relative positions of the larynx and hyoid apparatus as potential causes of palate displacement. Bilateral blockade of the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve with local anesthetic has been shown to cause DDSP, implicating a dysfunction of the palate musculature or its innervation as the cause. 99 Furthermore, the observation that some horses with displacement have lymphadenopathy of retropharyngeal nodes that lie in close proximity to the pharyngeal nerves supports the hypothesis that a neuropathy is contributory. 100 Other investigators have evaluated the effects of altering the relationships between the larynx and hyoid apparatus through denervation or transection of various muscles inserting on those structures. Selective transection of the thyrohyoideus muscle causes intermittent dorsal displacement of the palate in some horses, leading to speculation that neuromuscular disorders of this muscle may predispose to displacement. 101 Recent observations that DDSP and nasopharyngeal collapse were observed in horses following desensitization of the laryngeal mucosa with local anesthetic suggests that receptors within the laryngeal mucosa may be important in maintaining upper airway patency in exercising horses. 102 Pathogenesis Along with dorsal displacement of the soft palate is a reduction in the cross-sectional area of the nasopharynx. This increases the resistance to airflow and may occlude the passageway completely, temporarily inducing asphyxia (choking down). The displacement creates a stertorous noise most obvious during expiration as the soft tissues vibrate. Because of the obstruction, airflow may be diverted through the mouth during expiration. A study of 10 horses exercising on a high-speed treadmill found that the time of displacement relative to exercise intensity varied, occurring in two horses at peak speed, in two horses before obtaining peak speed, and in six horses as they started to slow down during the exercise protocol. 96 The time of displacement relative to the breathing-swallowing cycle also varied, with displacement occurring during inspiration in three horses, during expiration in three horses, and being associated with a swallow in four horses. 96 Clinical Signs The cardinal signs of DDSP are respiratory noise and decreased exercise tolerance. Signs are often dramatic, leading to the descriptor \"choking down.\" Affected horses typically make an inspiratory and expiratory noise, but the latter is much more prominent. The noise often is described as snoring, rattling, or gurgling. Occasionally, a horse may show an expiratory noise at rest or while eating. Clinical signs are ordinarily apparent only during strenuous exercise. In racehorses, a history of acute onset of noise and respiratory embarrassment is frequent. Normal respiratory function returns immediately when the horse swallows. Diagnosis Given the intermittent nature of the displacement, diagnosis is often difficult to confirm. Definitive diagnosis is by observation of displacement during endoscopic examination while the horse is exercising rigorously on a high-speed treadmill. With displacement the caudal border of the palate moves dorsal to the epiglottis, obscuring its shape. The caudal free border of the palate is evident, as is dorsal billowing of the palate on expiration. Before the actual displacement, a lowering of the pharyngeal roof, an elevation of the rostral portion of the soft palate, and a caudal retraction of the larynx are apparent.",

A deformation of the thyroid cartilage, a lack of the cricothyroid articulation, and often an absence or agenesis of the cricothyroid and cricopharyngeal muscles occur. 107, 108 Abnormal pharyngeal configurations prevent normal deglutition, predisposing horses to develop aspiration pneumonia. Clinical Signs The condition may be present from birth. In most cases, abnormal respiratory noise and poor athletic performance are the presenting complaints. In severe cases, horses may exhibit dysphagia, nasal discharge of food material, persistent coughing, and belching. 106, 107 Diagnosis The diagnosis is based on the clinical signs and history confirmed with endoscopic examination. The rostrally displaced palatopharyngeal arch obscures the normal view of the apices of the arytenoid cartilages. Postmortem examination or surgical exploration of the larynx confirms the presence of developmental defects. Treatment Rostral displacement of the palatopharyngeal arch is an endoscopic sign representing a major deformation of the laryngeal structures. Resection of the arch by conventional surgery or laser surgery has not enabled successful athletic performance. 109 Severely affected horses are euthanized.",

            "text": "Definition The aryepiglottic fold is the mucous membrane that extends from the lateral aspect of the arytenoid cartilages to the ventrolateral aspect of the epiglottis, where it blends with the subepiglottic mucosa and the glossoepiglottic fold. In epiglottic entrapment, this membrane envelops a portion of or all of the epiglottis. 95, 110 Causes The cause of epiglottic entrapment is not understood completely. In most cases, the epiglottic cartilage and associated soft tissues appear normal. In occasional cases, congenital epiglottic hypoplasia or inflammation of the upper respiratory tract structures appears to contribute to entrapment. Epidemiology Epiglottic entrapment occurs predominantly in Standardbred and Thoroughbred racehorses, with males and females equally affected. 111 Pathogenesis Billowing of the entrapping membranes during respiration decreases the cross-sectional area of the pharynx and effectively obstructs the airflow, particularly during expiration. Clinical Signs Most horses show exercise intolerance and respiratory stertor. Horses occasionally may cough during exercise or while eating. Because entrapment may be an intermittent finding, one should confirm the persistence of the entrapment during exercise by endoscopic examination during exercise or immediately following completion of exercise. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on endoscopic examination. The membrane obscures the normal serrated margin of the epiglottis and its dorsal vasculature. In contrast to dorsal displacement of the soft palate, one still can appreciate the shape of the epiglottis. Ulceration of the free margin of the fold and erosion of the entrapped epiglottis may be apparent. 95 Epiglottic length may be determined radiographically. 98 One also may visualize the entrapment on lateral radiographs (Figure 7 -12). Treatment Entrapment requires surgical correction. A number of different approaches have been advocated. One may accomplish resection or division of the tissue (1) under general anesthesia via pharyngotomy, laryngotomy, or by an oral approach; (2) transendoscopically, using a contact Nd:YAG laser; or (3) transnasally, using a hooked bistoury. 111, 112 Augmentation of the hypoplastic epiglottis by Teflon submucosal injections has been advocated to increase the bulk of the epiglottis and thus offset some of the structural defects that may predispose to entrapment. 103 One performs this procedure through a ventral laryngotomy.

Racehorses in active training are affected most commonly. Suggested causes include respiratory tract infection, allergens, palate displacement, epiglottic entrapment, inhaled foreign material, poor quality hay, and the stress of race training. 113 Clinical Signs Primary clinical signs include exercise intolerance, respiratory noise, and coughing. Dysphagia and respiratory distress are less common signs. Diagnosis Diagnosis is by endoscopic examination. Signs include epiglottic thickening and ulceration, edema and discoloration of the epiglottic mucosa and aryepiglottic folds, and dorsal elevation of the epiglottic axis. Ulceration may expose the cartilage at the tip of the epiglottis or may be evident as granulation tissue on the underside of the epiglottis. Dorsal displacement of the soft palate is a frequent accompanying finding and may obscure visualization of the epiglottis. In such cases, lateral pharyngeal radiographic or transoral endoscopic evaluation of the epiglottis is of diagnostic value. Epiglottitis frequently is misdiagnosed as epiglottic entrapment on endoscopy. Treatment Treatment is conservative, consisting of stall rest, systemic antiinflammatory drugs, and topical treatment with antiinflammatory drugs and antibiotics. Most horses respond satisfactorily to treatment, but some occasionally require surgical resection of fibrotic or abscessed subepiglottic tissues. Long-term complications include epiglottic deformity, intermittent or persistent palate displacement, and epiglottic entrapment.",

The cysts usually are considered congenital. Acquired cysts are associated with secretory cells and may occur following obstruction or inflammation of the mucous glands. 95, 115 Pseudostratified cuboidal or columnar epithelium or squamous epithelium usually line the cysts, which often contain thick, yellow mucus. Clinical Signs A foal affected with a large pharyngeal cyst may exhibit signs of respiratory obstruction or dysphagia in the immediate postnatal period. Cough, nasal discharge, nasal milk reflux, and signs of pneumonia may be evidence of accompanying aspiration pneumonia. More typically, the affected horse is asymptomatic until rigorous training begins and signs of abnormal respiratory noise and exercise intolerance become evident. Horses may cough occasionally as well. Dorsal displacement of the soft palate may coexist. Diagnosis Confirmation of diagnosis is by visualization of smooth-walled structures 1 to 5 cm in diameter. Subepiglottic cysts may distort the appearance of the epiglottis, causing it to assume a more upright position in the pharynx. Endoscopic differentiation between subepiglottic and soft palatal cysts may be difficult. Lateral radiographs of the pharynx and larynx or transoral endoscopic examination of the epiglottis may be useful in distinguishing cysts from conformational defects of the epiglottis. Treatment Treatment is surgical resection of the cyst via a ventral midline laryngotomy. Some cysts may be accessible via Nd:YAG laser techniques, eliminating the need for general anesthesia. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials are indicated because of the potential for development of aspiration pneumonia, and the clinician should initiate therapy immediately. A course of 7 to 10 days may be indicated postoperatively, depending on the involvement of the lower respiratory tract structures.",

            "text": "Definition Arytenoid chondritis is an abnormal enlargement of the arytenoid cartilages associated with chronic inflammation. 116 Epidemiology The condition is primarily a disease of horses performing at high speeds. Although the racing Thoroughbred or Standardbred primarily is affected, the condition has been described in other breeds. 117 Pathogenesis The cause of arytenoid chondritis is unknown, but trauma, inflammation, and infection have been cited as potential causes. In most cases the onset of clinical signs is insidious and progressive, but occasionally, arytenoid chondritis may follow an acute episode of laryngeal infection. Histopathologic findings in this condition are consistent with a chronic recurrent inflammatory process. Involved cartilage is greatly thickened and laminated with fibrous connective tissue. Intralumenal granulomata and sinus tracts are observable in some cases. Airway obstruction is caused by physical enlargement of the affected arytenoid cartilage and axial movement of the cartilage as it enlarges. The condition is typically unilateral, though often secondary contact damage (\"kissing lesion\") occurs to the contralateral cartilage. In most cases the condition is progressive and debilitating, and thus the clinician should give a guarded to poor prognosis. 115 Clinical Signs Clinical signs include exercise intolerance and inspiratory stridor during exercise. In some horses one easily can elicit a cough with tracheal compression. Palpation of the larynx suggests that the cartilages are less resilient than normal. 118 In severe cases of chondritis, dyspnea at rest may be evident. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on endoscopic examination. Mildly affected horses retain arytenoid mobility yet have ulcerations of the body of the affected cartilage or granulomata that project into the laryngeal lumen. In more advanced cases, the affected arytenoid cartilage is immobile and deviated axially. Such cases may mimic laryngeal hemiplegia, but most have additional findings of ulceration, granuloma, deformity of the corniculate process, or a kissing lesion on the contralateral cartilage. 117 Other abnormalities, such as aryepiglottic entrapment or dorsal displacement of the soft palate, may be evident. Radiographs may reveal excessive mineralization of laryngeal cartilages. Treatment Treatment includes medical and surgical approaches. Rest, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory therapy, antimicrobials, and throat sprays or nebulization may be helpful in some cases. 117 In horses that retain arytenoid mobility yet have an intralumenal granuloma, transendoscopic laser debulking is indicated. More advanced cases require surgical resection of the affected cartilage. Several techniques have been advocated. Arytenoidectomy involves removal of the corniculate and arytenoid cartilages, including the muscular process. Partial arytenoidectomy (with ventriculectomy and cordectomy) involves resection of the laryngeal saccule, vocal fold, and arytenoid cartilage, excluding the muscular process and the rostral strip of the corniculate. 119 Subtotal arytenoidectomy involves removal of the arytenoid cartilage except for the muscular process. 120, 121 Laryngeal Hemiplegia Definition Laryngeal hemiplegia is a failure of abduction of a structurally normal arytenoid cartilage because of decreased or absent motor activity in the cricoarytenoideus dorsalis muscle, the primary arytenoid cartilage abductor. The fundamental defect is neuropathy of recurrent laryngeal nerve that innervates all of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx with the exception of the cricothyroideus. Paralysis of the cricoarytenoideus dorsalis prevents phasic abduction of the arytenoid cartilages during inspiration or maintained abduction of the cartilages during exercise. Denervation of the arytenoideus transversus, cricoarytenoideus lateralis, ventricularis, and vocalis also prevents adduction of the arytenoids and slackening of the vocal folds. 94 Causes In the majority of cases no cause for the laryngeal paralysis is found; thus it has been termed idiopathic laryngeal hemiplegia (ILH). Most of the clinically detectable cases of ILH involve the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. ILH is a manifestation of a generalized distal axonopathy affecting all long nerves in large-statured horses. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve is the longest nerve in the horse and typically the only one in which axonopathy leads to a clinically evident deficit. Other theories advanced to explain the recurrent laryngeal neuropathy include (1) mechanical compression or stretch of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve as it courses over the aortic arch, (2) bacterial-or viral-induced neuropathies, and (3) vitamin deficiencies. 122 In occasional cases, laryngeal hemiplegia has been known to occur following perivascular or perineural injections, organophosphate intoxication, 123,124 lead poisoning, plant poisoning, guttural pouch mycosis, neoplasia, traumatic accidents to the neck, and paralaryngeal abscessation. 123, 125 Epidemiology ILH generally is considered to be a disorder of larger-breed horses and rarely is reported in Arabians and ponies. Clinical signs usually occur after 3 years of age at a time when work begins. However, left laryngeal asymmetry has been observed endoscopically in foals. 125 Males are reported to be affected more commonly than females, although the physical size difference may be an important consideration in this regard because ILH occurs more frequently in larger horses (>160 cm in height) with long necks and narrow chests. 122 ILH has been reported more frequently in certain family lines of horses, thus causing some to propose it to be a heritable disorder. 126, 127 However, the exact mode of transmission remains uncertain. Pathogenesis In ILH, distal degeneration of the nerve fibers in the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and subsequent atrophy of the intrinsic laryngeal musculature occur. 128, 129 Similar, although less severe changes also occur in the right recurrent laryngeal nerve of hemiplegic horses. Mild involvement of other peripheral long nerve fibersfor example, of the distal hindlimb-also occurs. The finding of bilateral recurrent neuropathy, along with changes in other peripheral nerves, is inconsistent with the hypothesis that neuropathy is a sequela of compression or stretching of the nerve as it courses along the aortic arch. The findings, however, are not inconsistent with the development of a distal axonopathy following an energydependent disorder, an antioxidant disorder, or a filamentous neuropathy. 130 Pathophysiology Inadequate abduction of the arytenoids provides an inspiratory resistance to air flow. In experimentally induced hemiplegia, a significant increase in inspiratory or expiratory resistance at rest is not evident. However, during moderate exercise intensities, a significant increase in inspiratory resistance and a subsequent inspiratory airflow limitation develops. 131 The effect of this limitation on gas exchange has been evaluated. During eupneic breathing, no detectable alterations in gas exchange occur. However, during exercise, the physiologic hypercapnia and hypoxemia normally found worsens. 132, 133 The ensuing hypoxemia may contribute to the exercise intolerance. The inspiratory resistance increases the work of breathing and may predispose to the development of respiratory muscle fatigue. Clinical Signs Most horses with unilateral laryngeal hemiplegia have a history of exercise intolerance and the production of an inspiratory noise described as a whistle or a roar. In contrast, horses with bilateral laryngeal paralysis may show respiratory distress and require emergency tracheostomies. In cases of bilateral paralysis secondary to toxins (e.g., organophosphate overdose), clinical signs may not be apparent for several weeks following the toxic insult. 134 Diagnosis Physical examination and palpation of the larynx may reveal atrophy of the cricoarytenoideus dorsalis muscle. The slap test has been used to evaluate the adductor function of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles. In normal horses, when one slaps the saddle area of the horse, contralateral arytenoid cartilage adduction occurs. This adduction is detectable endoscopically or by palpation of the larynx during the procedure. The reflex is absent in horses with idiopathic recurrent laryngeal neuropathy. 135 However, the demonstration of a normal laryngeal reflex when the horse is at rest does not indicate that the horse is completely free of laryngeal hemiplegia. 126 Ultimately, the clinician usually makes the diagnosis by an endoscopic examination wherein one observes asymmetric positioning or range of motion of the arytenoid cartilages and relaxation of the vocal folds on the affected side. Box 7-3 provides a proposed grading scheme and may aid in the decision for surgical intervention. For example, horses with grade IV can be expected to benefit from surgery, whereas horses with grades I and II usually are not compromised during exercise and thus are not good surgical candidates. Horses with grade III are considered suspect, some of these horses demonstrating dynamic collapse of the airway and thus requiring surgical intervention. Ideally, one should perform endoscopic examination of the horse during treadmill exercise to ascertain the importance of slight asymmetry at rest in the production of exercise intolerance. A recent study documented progression of laryngeal hemiplegia, as judged by clinical signs and endoscopic examination, in 15% of horses. 136 The mean age of onset of progression was 7 years. Treatment Surgical correction of the airflow obstruction is necessary. Laryngoplasty, a prosthesis that maintains the affected arytenoid in abduction, is implemented most commonly. Complications associated with the surgery include failure to maintain abduction of the arytenoid cartilage, dysphagia leading to coughing while eating or rarely aspiration pneumonia, chronic infection of the prosthesis leading to a suture sinus, ossification of cartilage, esophageal obstruction, intralaryngeal granulomatous polyps, right-sided laryngospasm during exercise, laryngeal edema, and chondritis. 137 Ventriculectomy, surgical ablation of the lateral ventricles in an effort to induce adhesions between the vocal cords and laryngeal walls, also has been performed, singly or with the laryngoplasty. Prosthetic laryngoplasty prevents the increase in inspiratory resistance and flow limitation during moderate exercise. 132 However, ventriculectomy alone fails to alleviate the increased inspiratory impedance during exercise. 133 Surgical procedures that attempt to restore innervation to the cricoartyenoideus dorsalis muscle minimize the risk of serious postoperative complications. Described techniques include transplantation of a nervemuscle pedicle into the cricoartenoidus dorsalis muscle, implantation of the cut end of the second cervical nerve into the left cricoarytenoideus muscle and anastomosis of the first cervical nerve to the abductor branch of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. [137] [138] [139] A modest improvement was notable in the experimental models but a report of nerve-muscle pedicle graft in racehorses revealed results comparable to those of prosthetic laryngoplasty. 140 Reinnervation of the cricoarytenoideus muscle following nerve-muscle pedicle grafting takes 6 to 12 months depending on the amount of muscle atrophy and thus is used primarily in young, unraced horses or in horses in which a rapid return to athletic performance is not necessary.",

The disease was recognized in the thirteenth century and occurs worldwide. 141 Recent multilocus enzyme electrophoresis studies have confirmed a close genetic relationship of S. equi equi and S. zooepidemicus, indicating that the former is a clone derived from the more genetically diverse S. zooepidemicus. 142 This finding has led to the recommendation that S. equi equi be reclassified as a biovar of S. zooepidemicus. 143 Although isolates of these two organisms show greater than 92% DNA homology, immunity is species specific: immunization with S. zooepidimicus does not protect against challenge by S. equi equi. S. equi equi (hereafter referred to as S. equi) is not a normal inhabitant of the equine upper respiratory tract and does not require prior viral infections for successful colonization and infection. 144 Based on morphologic features of the bacterial colony, three strains of the organism occur that differ in virulence. The typical and highly virulent encapsulated S. equi strains produce golden, honey-colored mucoid colonies on blood agar. Atypical S. equi colonies exhibit a matte appearance within 24 hours of incubation. Nonencapsulated colonies are glossy, dry, and small. 145 Differences in the hyaluronic acid content of the capsule are responsible for the morphologically distinctive features of S. equi colonies.",

Typical S. equi isolates fail to ferment any of these sugars, whereas atypical S. equi isolates may ferment lactose or trehalose but not sorbitol. 146 In some laboratories, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays aid in confirming S. equi isolates. 147 Epidemiology The infection occurs primarily in horses 1 to 5 years old but is not restricted to this age group. Foals up to 3 months of age born from immune mares are known to be resistant to the development of strangles. 148 In susceptible equine populations, morbidity is nearly 100%, whereas mortality is low (up to 10%) if appropriate therapy is instituted. 149 Once having been infected, approximately 75% of the horses are immune to the organism for 4 years. 150 In another study, 83% of young horses affected with clinical strangles as foals were resistant to co-mingling exposure 6 months later. 151 Immunity is not lifelong: epidemiologic studies report attack rates in horses greater than 3 years of age of 18%, 29%, and 35%. 149, 152, 153 The organism is transmitted (1) via direct contact with nasal secretions or lymph node discharges from infected horses or (2) via exposure to fomites such as contaminated equipment, pails, halters, leads, brushes, clothing, horse vans, or stalls. Recent additions to a stable are most often the cause of a strangles outbreak because a recovering horse may shed the organism for several weeks. In closed herds, epidemics have been attributed to exposure of horses to asymptomatic chronic carriers of the organism. Such horses harbor the organism in the guttural pouches for as long as 39 months in the absence of clinical signs. Other sites of long-term carriage of the organism include the paranasal sinuses. 154 The organism also can survive for long periods in the environment depending on the temperature and the substrate. Jorm 155 found that S. equi survived for 63 days on wood at temperatures of 2\u00b0C and for 48 days on glass or wood at temperatures of 20\u00b0C. A 1:200 dilution of phenol and disinfectants such as povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, and glutaraldehyde kill the organism within 90 minutes.",

Within hours of adhesion, the organism has translocated below the mucosa and gained access to the local lymphatics and lymph nodes where replication occurs extracellulary. 141 Spread of the organism to sites other than the upper respiratory tract lymphoid tissue may occur by hematogenous or lymphatic pathways.",

            "text": "At least three virulence factors of S. equi contribute to its pathogenicity and include the hyaluronic acid capsule, the M-like protein, and a leukocidal toxin. 158 The hyaluronic acid capsule possesses a strongly negative charge and apparently repels phagocytic cells. Nonencapsulated strains of S. equi are able to colonize the surface of the upper respiratory tract and stimulate production of serum antibody but are unable to induce detectable pathologic changes in the retropharyngeal and submandibular lymph nodes. 159 The second virulence factor, the M-like protein (SeM), is a 58-kd cell wall antigen. This protein functions by limiting deposition of complement components (C3b) on the bacterial surface and preventing activation of the alternative complement pathway. SeM also binds fibrinogen and impairs neutrophil killing of the organism. 142 The M-like antigen also appears to be important for adherence of the organism to the oropharyngeal epithelium. Another recently identified M-like protein, SzPSe, exhibits antigenic cross reactivity with the M-like proteins of S. zooepidemicus. Its contribution to the virulence of S. equi is currently unknown. 142 Additional factors that may contribute to the pathogenicity of S. equi include extracellular proteins that are mitogenic for peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 160 These mitogenic factors have been hypothesized to induce release of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 from antigen-presenting cells (macrophages, monocytes) and to contribute to the development of fever, malaise, neutrophilia, and hyperfibrinogenemia. 160 Clinical Signs The incubation period ranges from 2 to 6 days. In typical cases, horses are febrile, exhibit malaise, and develop a serous nasal discharge that becomes mucopurulent. Submandibular and retropharyngeal lymph nodes are initially firm but become fluctuant before rupturing 7 to 10 days after the onset of signs. Lymphadenopathy may be asymmetrical and may become so severe that dysphagia and respiratory distress ensue. Swelling of the throat-latch area or of Viborg's triangle may be apparent. The affected horse may stand with its neck stretched out and be reluctant to swallow. A soft moist cough may be heard. The average course of the syndrome is 23 days. 144 In atypical S. equi infections, a mild inflammation of the upper respiratory tract occurs and is characterized by a slight nasal discharge, cough, and fever. Abscessation of the lymph nodes occurs only in a small number of the cases. 145, 146, 161 Clinical Pathology A marked neutrophilic leukocytosis, hyperfibrinogenemia, and an anemia of chronic infection are found in typical strangles cases. Diagnosis Diagnosis usually is based on clinical signs and the isolation (culture) or detection (PCR) of S. equi from a lymph node, a nasopharyngeal swab, or lavage fluid from the guttural pouches. Blood cultures may become positive for S. equi on days 6 to 12 following infection. 162 Identification of chronic asymptomatic carriers can be difficult. In one recent study, endoscopic abnormalities in the guttural pouches were evident in most asymptomatic carriers. 163 However, the absence of visible pathologic signs in one asymptomatic carrier emphasizes the need to obtain samples for microbiologic studies. When PCR and culture results from asymptomatic carriers were compared, many more samples were found to be positive using PCR than with culture alone. 164 Treatment Treatment is a function of the stage of the disease. Sweeney, Benson, Whitlock, et al. 165 suggested a treatment protocol that is outlined next. Penicillin is the drug of choice, although S. equi is sensitive to oxytetracycline and the potentiated sulfonamides. 141, 154 The treatment plan is as follows: 1. For horses exposed to the organism, penicillin therapy is indicated to prevent seeding of the pharyngeal lymph nodes. Antimicrobial therapy should continue for as long as the horse remains exposed to the organism. Once the therapy stops, a risk exists that the horse may develop strangles. 2. For horses exhibiting signs of infection in the absence of lymph node abscessation, penicillin G therapy can arrest the progression of the disease. One should isolate the horses during their treatment protocol.",

            "text": "3. For horses exhibiting evidence of lymph node abscessation, administration of penicillin slows the progression of lymph node abscessation and generally is contraindicated. Hot-packing the area(s) promotes abscess formation. Once achieved, the clinician should lance the abscess and flush it with a 2% tamed iodine solution. One should treat horses in isolation. 4. For horses that are systemically ill or that develop complications such as dysphagia and respiratory distress require supportive care in addition to high levels of intravenous penicillin. This therapy may entail intravenous fluid therapy, a tracheostomy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and feeding via the nasogastric tube. Sequelae Complications most frequently result from metastasis of the organism to other organ systems with the formation of purulent foci. 165 These complications include the following: 1. Internal abscessation of the mesentery or of parenchymatous organs. The causes of internal abscessation are not known, although inadequate antimicrobial therapy during respiratory catarrh and lymphoid abscessation may be contributory. 166 The horse may have a history of intermittent colic, periodic pyrexia, anorexia, depression, and weight loss. The clinician should direct diagnostic techniques, including rectal palpation, thoracic radiography, thoracocentesis, abdominocentesis, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and nuclear scintigraphy, 167 at determining the location of the abscess. Cases of internal abscessation can be difficult to differentiate from neoplastic causes of weight loss and colic because both processes may induce similar abnormalities in the peritoneal fluid (leukocytosis and hyperproteinemia). Differentiation between the two processes may not be possible unless exfoliated neoplastic cells are identified. 168 Hematologic and serum biochemical abnormalities in cases of internal abscessation include (1) a neutrophilic and monocytic leukocytosis, (2) hyperfibrinogenemia, (3) hyperglobulinemia and hypoalbuminemia, and (4) hypocalcemia. 166, 168 However, these changes are not unique to abscesses and may not be found in horses with intraabdominal neoplasms. 168 Thus the diagnosis of internal abscessation represents a medical challenge. Once one confirms the diagnosis, long-term penicillin therapy is indicated and may be required for several months. Clinical signs, rectal palpation, repeated abdominocentesis, and multiple complete blood counts (CBCs) are useful to monitor the progress of therapy. 2. Purpura hemorrhagica. This aseptic vasculitis occurs following reexposure to S. equi by natural infection or following vaccination. In horses with purpura hemorrhagica, IgA titers to the SeM and to nonspecific proteins in the S. equi culture supernatant (SC-P) are significantly greater than those titers found in horses with uncomplicated strangles. 169 Furthermore, the isolation of immune complexes consisting of IgA and M-like proteins in the sera of horses with purpura hemorrhagica has led to the suggestion that this isotype is involved in the development of purpura. 169, 170 The immunologic basis for the increase in serum IgA levels is not known: possible explanations include uncontrolled expansion of B cell populations that produce IgA against antigens of S. equi or failure of IgA removal mechanisms because of hepatic dysfunction. In the horse, purpura hemorrhagica has been likened to Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, an immune complex-mediated disease of human beings. 170 The clinical signs of purpura vary and range from a mild transient reaction to a severe and fatal form. Horses with purpura develop pitting edema of the limbs, head, and trunk and petechiation and ecchymoses of the mucous membranes. Horses also may have colic following edema and hemorrhage of the bowel. The vasculitis may cause skin sloughing and infarcts of skeletal muscle. Death may ensue as a result of pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmias, renal failure, or gastrointestinal disorders.",

Parenteral (killed) vaccines induce strong serum bactericidal activity, but these antibodies are not necessarily protective because mucosal immunity plays a significant role in the resistance to infection. 178 In contrast, mucosal immunization induces a combination of systemic and local responses associated with the production of a greater variety of immunoglobulin isotypes and specificities that closely mimic those induced by natural disease. Although intranasal vaccines are expected to produce fewer adverse reactions than parenteral vaccines, lethargy, inappetence, fever, lymphadenopathy, lymph node abscessation, purpura hemorrhagica, and intramuscular abscesses have occurred after vaccination. One should not administer intranasal vaccines concurrently with other parenteral injections because of the risk of abscess formation at the site of the intramuscular injection. One should wash one's hands thoroughly following vaccination. Vaccination of infected horses during an outbreak on a farm may be associated with the development of purpura hemorrhagica. Because of the lack of scientific studies, whether the clinician should implement vaccination in the face of an outbreak is uncertain. During vaccination, effective immune response takes 7 to 10 days to develop.",

            "text": "Causes The influenza viruses are enveloped myxoviruses containing single-stranded RNA. Based on the internal nucleoproteins and matrix antigens, influenza viruses have been classified as three types: A, B, and C. Types B and C infect only human beings, but type A infects many different species, including human beings, horses, swine, and avian species. 178 Natural cross-species infections have occurred between human beings and swine, and experimental infection of human beings with equine influenza virus (subtype 2) is possible, although natural infections do not occur. 179 Type A is classified further into subtypes based on the surface antigens, the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Two subtypes are recognized as infectious for the horse: subtypes H7N7 and H3N8. Subtype H7N7 was first isolated in Prague in 1956 and has been called equine-1 influenza (A/equine/ Prague/56). Subtype 1 is thought to have disappeared from horses worldwide because an isolate has not been confirmed since 1980. Subtype H3N8 was first isolated in Miami in 1963 (prototype) and was designated as equine-2 influenza (A/equine/Miami/63). Several variants of subtype 2 (antigenic drift) have been identified and include A/equine/Fontainebleau/79, A/equine/ Kentucky/81, A/equine/Saskatoon/90, and A/equine/ Newmarket 2(N2/93). 178, 180, 181 Compared with the human influenza virus, the equine influenza virus is stable antigenically, not experiencing major antigenic shifts. This stability has been postulated to result from the shorter life span of horses relative to human beings and the lower mutation pressure placed on the equine influenza viruses because of low specific antibody titers. 179 Epidemiology Influenza most commonly affects 2-and 3-year-old horses and may be the most common cause of respiratory illness in racehorses, with some tracks experiencing influenza outbreaks 2 to 3 times within a racing season. [180] [181] [182] This phenomenon may reflect poor ventilation systems (closed shedrows), lack of adequate immunization protocols, and rapid transmission of the virus from exercise ponies to racehorses. 180 The reservoir of equine influenza virus between epizootics remains unknown. Some speculate that the virus is maintained in the horse population itself and that asymptomatic carriers shed virus when stressed. Alternatively, the virus may be harbored in other species such as birds, which are asymptomatic but shed the virus in their feces. 179 Pathogenesis The incubation period is 1 to 3 days, with the virus infecting the upper respiratory tract and the lungs to a lesser extent. Healthy respiratory tract epithelium is ciliated and contains mucus that forms a protective layer over the cell surface. The mucus normally acts as a mechanical barrier between air and tissue and contains antibody and protein substances that deter the attachment of viral particles to the epithelium. 183 Neuraminidase activity of the viral particles alters the efficiency of the mucociliary apparatus, allowing the virions to attach via hemagglutinin antigens to sugar groups (sialic acid) on the surface of the epithelial cells. The epithelial cell internalizes the bound virus and surrounds it with an endosome. However, in the mildly acidic conditions of the mature endosome, the hemagglutinin antigen protein becomes activated and promotes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, leading to release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. 184 Cell necrosis and desquamation follow viral replication within the respiratory tract epithelium. Exposure of irritant receptors causes hypersecretion of submucosal serous glands and further damage to the mucociliary apparatus. Inflammation leads to massive lymphocyte infiltration and edema. Recovery of the normal epithelial architecture can require more than 6 weeks. 185 Humoral and cellular immunity are important in providing protection against viral disease: IgA blocks viral penetration but is not bactericidal; certain IgG isotypes, IgGa and IgGb, opsonize the virus particles and enhance phagocytosis. 186 Clinical Signs Signs of influenza appear 3 to 5 days following exposure to the virus. Horses exhibit a sudden onset of fever (103\u00b0to 105\u00b0F), which may be biphasic; a serous nasal discharge; anorexia; depression; and a dry, deep cough. Some horses exhibit myalgia, myositis, and limb edema and are thus reluctant to move. 179 A mild form of azoturia (myoglobinuria) occurs in some cases. One may find submandibular lymphadenopathy, as well as endoscopic evidence of pharyngitis and tracheitis. A mild bronchitis with minimal changes in lung sounds may occur. From experimental studies, inoculation with A/equine-1 produces a milder (subclinical) syndrome unless the animal is stressed before infection, whereas A/equine-2 usually generates the typical clinical signs. The course of the infection usually lasts 2 to 10 days in uncomplicated cases. Exercise exacerbates the clinical signs. 187 Secondary bacterial infections may occur, and donkeys and mules appear to have greater susceptibility to secondary infections than horses. 188 Horses remain infectious for 3 to 6 days after the last signs of illness.",

            "text": "In young foals, influenza is severe, producing signs of viral pneumonia, which may lead to death within 48 hours. Clinical Pathology Horses initially may exhibit a lymphopenia followed by a monocytosis. Diagnosis The clinician may diagnosis equine influenza by two methods: 1. Detection of virus. Based on studies of influenza outbreaks, viral culture and isolation alone from nasopharyngeal swabs appears to be the least sensitive method for diagnosing influenza, 180 probably because the chances of viral isolation are greater when samples are collected within the first 24 hours. 182 However, a stallside assay (Directigen Flu-A test, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey), allows rapid detection of influenza antigen and an immediate diagnosis. 185 Detection of viral particles in materials obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs via PCR permits diagnosis of influenza infections within 48 hours of sample submission. 2. Serologic testing. Several diagnostic methods for detecting influenza virus antibodies in the horse are available and include complement fixation, hemagglutination inhibition, single radial hemolysis, viral neutralization, and enzyme immunoassay. 189 Acute and convalescent serum samples are needed to establish a definitive diagnosis, and although viral neutralizing antibodies may be detectable within a week of infection, the horse may take up to 28 days to exhibit a rise in hemagglutination titers. 179 Serologic testing has been considered to be a sensitive method for diagnosing influenza outbreaks, although in one epidemic, approximately 24% of horses with clinical signs of influenza failed to seroconvert. 180 Treatment Treatment is primarily symptomatic, ensuring that the horse continues to maintain adequate hydration and is not subjected to undue stresses. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be indicated to reduce the fever, eliminate the myalgia, and improve the appetite. The risk is that the owner will return the horse to strenuous exercise before the horse has rested a sufficient time.",

            "text": "Causes Currently, five equine herpesviruses are recognized as causing disease in horses. Three are classified as \u03b1-herpesviruses (EHV1, EHV3, and EHV4), and two are grouped with the \u03b3-herpesviruses (EHV2 and EHV5). EHV4, formerly called EHV1 subtype 2, serologically cross-reacts with EHV1 but is genetically distinct from that virus. 196 EHV1 and EHV4 share many common clinical features. EHV1, in addition to causing respiratory disease, also causes abortions, myeloencephalitis, and neonatal deaths. EHV4 is associated predominantly with respiratory disease in young horses but sporadically causes abortion, neonatal deaths, and neurologic disease. [197] [198] [199] [200] Epidemiology EHV1 and EHV4 may persist within a herd because of recrudescence of latent infections during periods of stress or immunosuppression. Dexamethasone or cyclophosphamide administration is a reliable reactivation stimulus for viral shedding in experimental studies. 201 For some years the site of viral persistent was unknown. However, in a study of 40 abattoir horses, EHV1 and EHV4 were detectable by PCR methods in the bronchial lymph nodes of 88% of the horses examined. Of the trigeminal ganglia examined in nine of the horses, one was found to contain only EHV1, four had detectable EHV4 in the ganglia, and three had evidence of EHV1 and EHV4. 202 EHV2 also was isolated from all of the horses examined, leading some researchers to speculate that EHV2 activates the promoter gene of EHV1. 203 In addition to the clinical trials, experimental studies of EHV1 and EHV4 also have provided data supporting the fact that lymphoid and neural tissues are sites of viral latency. 201, 203 Realizing that virus can establish latency, one easily can understand why respiratory infections by EHV1 or EHV4 can develop in foals, weanings, and yearlings in closed herds. Immunity to EHV1 or EHV4 is short-lived (3 to 5 months) so that most horses are reinfected during their breeding or racing careers. Reexposure usually results in mild or inapparent infections, except in the case of broodmares in which reinfection may lead to abortion in the last trimester. Immunity following abortion is generally of longer duration, and in the field, repeat abortions rarely occur in the same mares. No clear relationship exists between gestational age or the level of virus-neutralizing antibody and the incidence of virus-induced abortion. 204 Perinatal disease characterized by weakness and respiratory distress is usually evident within 18 to 24 hours of birth, with foals dying within 24 to 72 hours. 205 Pathogenesis Infection occurs via inhalation of the virus or contact with infected tissues. The virus is delicate and does not survive in the environment; thus close contact appears to be important for transmission. 205 Kydd, Smith, Hannant, et al. 206 have suggested that EHV1 enters the upper respiratory tract and, in the absence of mucosal antibody, immediately infects the epithelium lining of the nasopharynx and tonsils. Subsequent events depend on whether EHV1 becomes a productive or limited infection. Productive infection results in the intercellular spread of EHV1 through susceptible cells (including leukocytes) in the stroma until the vascular or lymphatic endothelium becomes infected. Thereafter infection spreads via leukocyte adhesion to infected endothelium, leading to the development of cell-associated viremia. As a result of viremia and of inhalation of viral particles, the virus disseminates to the lower respiratory tract. In a limited infection, infected cells are phagocytized and viral antigens are processed and presented to lymphocytes in mucosal lymphoid nodules or lymph nodes. The studies of Burrell 89 and Sutton, Viel, Carman, et al. 207 have demonstrated lower respiratory tract involvement in which hyperemia and mucous accumulations develop 2 to 12 weeks after the initial infection. EHV1 also has a tropism for lymphocytes and is reported to cause immunosuppression.",

            "text": "The pathogenesis of EHV4 has not been investigated completely and may be similar to that of EHV1. Clinical Signs Clinical signs of rhinopneumonitis appear 1 to 3 days following infection and are indistinguishable from influenza. Horses are febrile and exhibit a cough and a serous nasal discharge, which may become mucopurulent with secondary bacterial infections. Horses develop rhinitis, pharyngitis, and tracheitis detectable endoscopically. A severe disseminated EHV1 infection that caused fever, depression, respiratory distress, and eventual death has been described in yearlings and 2-year-old horses. 208, 209 Clinical Pathology An epidemiologic survey by Mason, Watkins, McNie, et al. 210 during an outbreak of EHV1 infection on a racetrack in Hong Kong documents a monocytosis in infected horses (>500 cells/\u00b5l) during the first 5 days of clinically apparent infections. In experimental infections of EHV1, a decrease in neutrophils and monocytes occurs on day 3 after infection, but the absolute values of both cell types remain within normal limits. 207 Diagnosis One may attempt viral isolation from citrated blood samples. Virus has been recovered from mononuclear cells for up to 2 weeks after infection or from nasopharyngeal swabs. PCR on clinical materials is rapid and enables distinction between EHV1 and EHV4. 211 Serologic diagnosis is made by demonstrating a fourfold increase in titers. Virus neutralization, immunoassay, complement fixation, and a radial immunodiffusion enzyme assay can detect antibodies against EHV1. 212 Postmortem examination of foals who died from EHV1 or EHV4 infection revealed interstitial pneumonia, pleural and peritoneal effusions, hypoplasia of the thymus and spleen, focal necrosis of the liver, and viral inclusion bodies within the hepatic parenchyma. Similar pathologic findings are observed in aborted fetuses. Treatment Treatment is supportive, minimizing stresses and ensuring adequate rest. Limited trials using antiviral drugs experimentally or clinically have been described. Acyclovir, is an acyclic nucleoside analog that inhibits viral DNA polymerases. Acyclovir is activated by virus-induced thymidine kinase before being converted to acyclovir triphosphate by cellular kinases. During outbreaks of EHV1 involving neurologic disease or neonatal deaths, acyclovir has been administered at doses ranging from 8 to 16 mg/kg orally 3 times daily to 20 mg/kg orally 3 times daily. 213, 214 The efficacy of acyclovir in treating respiratory disease has not been demonstrated. One potential drawback of acyclovir use is the development of viral resistance in strains lacking thymidine kinase. Another antiviral drug, (s)-1-[(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonyl methoxy)propyl]cytosine, or HPMPC, has been shown to be efficacious when given before EHV1 challenge in na\u00efve foals but has not been used clinically in North America. 215 Because evidence of immunosuppression during herpetic infections exists, the clinician should give horses broad-spectrum antimicrobials for 7 to 10 days and order rest for 4 to 6 weeks before the horse commences light exercise. Prevention Currently available vaccines are produced from EHV1 and EHV4, and although the vaccine does not prevent infection, it reduces the severity of clinical signs.",

            "text": "EHV2 is a slowly replicating virus, often referred to as equine cytomegalovirus. Opinions as to the role of EHV2 in producing equine respiratory diseases have been equivocal because the virus can be recovered from various sites from ill and apparently healthy horses. 87, 216 Foals that are infected experimentally with EHV2 develop pharyngitis and lymphoid hyperplasia, thus implicating this as a causative agent of chronic lymphoid hyperplasia in young horses. 87 The virus also has been isolated from young horses in race training with pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia. 89 EHV2 has been isolated from 2-to 3-month-old foals during outbreaks of pneumonia in Hungary, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and in the United States. [216] [217] [218] [219] [220] In some of these outbreaks, EHV2 was the sole infectious agent isolated from the respiratory tract, whereas in other outbreaks, bacterial agents-Streptococcus zooepidemicus and Rhodococcus equi-complicated the pneumonitis. 219 This has led some to speculate that if the foals are stressed or infected with a large dose of virus during a period in which maternal antibodies are waning, then the virus may invade the cells of the immune system and cause further immunosuppression. Blakeslee, Olsen, McAllister, et al. 87 reported a dose-related immunosuppression following in vitro infection of lymphocytes with EHV2, and this effect has been documented in vivo using a rabbit model. EHV2 also has been isolated from ocular, nasal, and tracheobronchial swabs of horses with keratoconjunctivitis, implicating it in the production of this clinical sydrome. 221 The suggestion has been made that most foals are exposed to EHV2 at 2 to 3 months of age and shed the virus for 2 to 6 months until a humoral antibody response develops and eventually is associated with low viral recovery. 216 Nearly 100% of older horses are seropositive for EHV2. 222 After natural exposure, EHV2 is recoverable from nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs, from the kidney, bone marrow, spleen, mammary gland, salivary gland, vagina, tracheal mucus, neural tissue, and from the cornea and conjunctiva. 222, 223 Leukocytes and lymph nodes draining the respiratory tract are major reservoirs of EHV2 DNA. 222 Diagnosis of EHV2 depends on isolation of the virus, serologic evidence of an active viral infection, and the presence of clinical signs. Treatment is symptomatic. Efficacy of antiviral agents has not been examined in EHV2 infections.",

EAV is genetically similar to coronaviruses (also a member of Arteriviridae) but has a dissimilar viral structure and complement-fixing antigen. 224 Only one strain has been identified, the Bucyrus strain, but isolates vary in virulence. 225 Epidemiology Before the 1984 epizootic of equine viral arteritis (EVA) in Kentucky, little attention was paid to this virus. 226 Most infections were assumed to be transmitted by inhalation until the important role of venereal transmission was demonstrated in those outbreaks. The virus is maintained in the equine population by longterm and short-term carriers in stallions. The duration of the carrier status ranges from several weeks to years. Testosterone is essential for maintenance of persistence. Long-term infections do not occur in colts exposed to the virus before the onset of peripubertal development or in mares. [226] [227] [228] During the carrier state, the virus is present solely in the reproductive tract, principally in the ampulla of the vas deferens. Primary exposure to the virus is presumed to be via the venereal route. Susceptible mares bred to carrier stallions almost always become infected with EAV. Viral shedding into the respiratory tract allows secondary horizontal transmission of the virus to occur.",

Diagnosis EVA is a reportable disease. Although virus may persist in the buffy coat for up to 36 days after infection, viral isolation can be difficult. 230 The clinician should submit citrated blood samples and should attempt isolation of virions from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs, vaginal swabs, and semen from an infected stallion. 233 PCR enhances viral detection and specificity. One also should attempt serologic diagnosis. Virus neutralization, complement fixation, immunodiffusion, and immunofluorescence are techniques used to demonstrate changes in antibody titers. A fourfold or greater rise in titer or a change in status from seronegative to seropositive may indicate a recent infection. Postmortem examinations of aborted fetuses do not show signs of arteritis as seen in adults. Fetuses do have evidence of edema, excessive pleural fluid, and petechiation on the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, but focal necrosis of the liver or intranuclear inclusions are not features of the disease. 225 Treatment Treatment is primarily symptomatic, keeping the horse hydrated and providing analgesics (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) as needed. Fever in stallions can lead to sperm damage and temporary infertility, so one should administer nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The clinician should isolate horses for 3 to 4 weeks to minimize the chances of transmission. Prevention Vaccination of seronegative stallions with a commercially available modified live vaccine is credited with preventing the establishment of carrier states in the stallion or with further increases in the carrier state during the 1984 epizootic in Kentucky. Stallions were bred only to mares that were vaccinated or seropositive from previous natural exposure to EVA. Following vaccination, clinical immunity was found to develop rapidly and to last for 1 to 3 years. 226 Primary vaccination does not prevent reinfection and limited shedding of virus. Clinicians should vaccinate mares 3 to 4 weeks before breeding to an EAV carrier stallion and should isolate such mares for another 3 weeks after being bred to a carrier stallion for the first time. 231 Vaccination is not recommended for pregnant mares or in foals less than 6 weeks of age. Passively derived antibodies to EAV decrease to undetectable amounts by 8 months postpartum for foals born to seropositive mares. Vaccination should be effective at this time if necessary. 234",

Serotype 1 recently has been renamed equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV) and has been reclassified as a member of the genus Aphthovirus. The reclassification is based on (1) homology of the nucleotide sequence of the ERAV genome with that of foot-and-mouth disease virus, (2) the physicochemical properties of ERAV, and (3) the production of viremia and persistent shedding following ERAV infection. 235 Serotype 2 has been renamed equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV) and has been reclassified as the sole member of the genus Erbovirus. A third serotype designated P313/75 also has been identified and currently is assigned to the family Picornaviridae. However, based on sequence similarity and serologic data, investigators have proposed that P313/75 be classified as a distinct serotype of Erbovirus and tentatively have named it ERBV2. 236 Infection of horses with ERAV causes acute fever, nasal discharge, coughing, anorexia, pharyngitis, laryngitis, and submandibular lymphadenitis. 237, 238 Infection produces moderate increases in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (from 50:49 in healthy horses to 57:43 in infected horses) and in plasma fibrinogen. 238 The importance of ERAV as a cause of respiratory disease has not been recognized previously because clinical signs may be mild and because viral isolation is difficult. 239 The incubation period is 3 to 8 days, with shedding of viral particles from pharyngeal secretions, urine, and feces a feature of the infection. Young horses are infected more commonly and in one study, 73% of 2-year olds showed serologic evidence of ERAV infection. 238 Equine rhinovirus A has a broad host range that includes rabbits, guinea pigs, monkeys, and human beings. Experimental and epidemiologic evidence of ERAV infection of human beings exists. High antibody titers were found in the sera of 3 of 12 stable workers, whereas no ERAV antibody was found in the sera of 159 non-stable workers. 240 One can attempt diagnosis of ERAV infection by serologic testing (fourfold changes between acute and convalescent titers) or PCR identification of the virus in nasopharyngeal swabs. 239 Equine rhinovirus B is also an equine respiratory tract pathogen. In a survey of horses with acute respiratory disease, researchers isolated ERBV from 30% of the horses sampled. Of the 28 horses from which the virus was recovered, a serologic diagnosis was made in only 6 horses. Researchers attributed the low diagnosis rate to the difficulty of initially collecting samples during the acute phase: antibody levels rise rapidly from day 6 after infection to peak between days 14 and 18. 241 Thus in contrast to ERAV, viral isolation may be the more successful diagnostic method.",

            "text": "Definition Inflammations, obstructions, compressions, lacerations, and containment of foreign bodies are the predominant disorders of the trachea in the horse. [243] [244] [245] [246] Tracheitis often accompanies viral upper respiratory tract diseases (see previous discussion) and manifests as areas of hyperemia and epithelial desquamation. Lacerations usually result from trauma, whereas compressions may result from extraluminal masses such as streptococcal abscesses or neoplasms such as lymphosarcomata or lipomata. Intraluminal obstructions may follow fibrotic stricture formation following trauma, tracheostomy, or pressure necrosis from inflated cuffs of endotracheal tubes or may be caused by granulomatous reactions within the trachea. 243 Foreign bodies, such as twigs, probably are inhaled during deglutition. Tracheal collapse may represent a congenital defect in miniature horses and ponies. 247, 248 Clinical Signs Clinical signs vary and range from stertorous breathing and dyspnea to chronic and persistent coughing and bilateral nasal discharge with a foul odor. Mild manipulation of the trachea also may induce paroxysmal bouts of coughing. Diagnosis The diagnosis is made on physical examination or endoscopic evaluation of the trachea. A history of a tracheal surgery or traumatic episode should alert the diagnostician to the possibility of an intraluminal obstruction or stricture. The clinician may visualize foreign bodies on examination but may need radiographs to delineate the extent of their involvement. One also should perform radiographic examination of the thorax to determine if a concomitant pneumonia, pneumomediastinum, or pneumothorax exists. Treatment One directs treatment at the primary cause. One does not treat primary inflammations following viral infections unless a persistent fever and a secondary bacterial tracheitis and pneumonia develop. The clinician may extract foreign bodies but may require tracheotomy to retrieve them if the endoscope is not long enough. In the adult horse a 2-m endoscope is necessary to reach the level of the carina located at the fifth to sixth intercostal space. Extraluminal masses require careful drainage or excision, with the potential for spread of infection into the mediastinum. The clinician should isolate horses with Streptococcus equi infections from other equids. Rupture of the trachea may require temporary tracheotomy distal to the rupture to ensure patency of airflow. A 2-week course of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy may be indicated, especially if the mucociliary clearance mechanism is compromised. Complications such as subcutaneous emphysema, cellulitis, and pneumomediastinum usually resolve over 2 weeks. Horses with tracheal defects have a poor to guarded prognosis for return to athletic potential.",

Postsynaptic fibers course from the sympathetic ganglion to airway smooth muscle where released norepinephrine interacts with \u03b1and \u03b2-receptors. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers also innervate parasympathetic ganglia. The released norepinephrine inhibits cholinergic neurotransmission. 259 However, numerous \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptors are distributed throughout the pulmonary parenchyma that lack innervation by the sympathetic fibers. Circulating catecholamines are probably important in activating these receptors and in causing subsequent bronchodilation. It is of interest that \u03b2 2 -adrenergic stimulation does not alter airway diameter in the healthy horse 262 but does increase airway caliber in horses with recurrent airway disease. \u03b2-agonists also promote ion transport and water secretion across human airway epithelium (in vitro) and may cause similar effects in vivo in the horse. This effect would benefit mucociliary clearance by increasing the sol component of the mucus. In addition, \u03b2-agonists stimulate surfactant secretion by type II pneumocytes, inhibit antigen-induced mast cell degranulation, and modulate cholinergic neural transmission. 258 Such effects remain to be demonstrated in the horse, however.",

Strenuously exercised horses exhibit a ten-and a 100-fold increase, respectively, in the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from transtracheal aspirates relative to preexercise samples. 284 The bacterial contamination, along with exercise-associated increases in bronchoalveolar cortisol concentrations, decreased pulmonary alveolar macrophage viability, and impaired phagocytic function, enable bacteria to proliferate and cause pneumonia. 274, 275, 283, 285, 286 Transportation remains one of the most common causes of pneumonia and pleuropneumonia in the horse because physically restraining the head of the horse and preventing postural drainage enhances bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract. 283, 287 Inflammation and increased numbers of bacteria are found in the transtracheal aspirates of horses within 6 to 12 hours of confinement with the head elevated. 288 Another hypothesis is that dehydration, associated with reduced fluid consumption before or during transportation, reduces mucociliary clearance and contributes to bacterial proliferation. Neither the prophylactic administration of antibiotics nor the intermittent release from the confined head posture reliably reduces tracheal bacterial numbers or prevents the accumulation of purulent tracheobronchial secretions in horses confined with their heads elevated. 288, 289 Horses undergoing general anesthesia may develop pneumonia when endotracheal intubation introduces oropharyngeal contaminants to the lower respiratory tract.

One may remove as much as 30 to 50 L. If blood discoloration of the pleural fluid is caused by the underlying disease, the fluid remains blood-tinged throughout the drainage. 305 The clinician should place indwelling chest tubes (1) if large volumes of foul-smelling fluid with microorganisms are obtained; (2) if the pleural fluid has a pH less than 7.2 or a glucose concentration less than 40 mg/dl; or (3) if the horse responds poorly to intermittent drainage. [298] [299] [300] [301] [302] [303] [304] [305] One should avoid the rapid removal of large volumes of fluid from the chest to guard against the development of hypovolemia. To the end of the indwelling chest tube one should attach a Heimlich valve or a nonlubricated condom with its tip snipped off. Complications of chest tube placement include pneumothorax; lung laceration; hemothorax; cardiac arrhythmias; bowel, liver or heart puncture; and localized swelling. 305 Appropriate antimicrobial therapy is based on the results of the culture and sensitivity. Pending microbiologic test results, one should administer broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics in most cases of pleuropneumonia because the infections are polymicrobic. Penicillin is one of the drugs of choice, for it is efficacious against Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and many anaerobes. Metronidazole is added routinely to the penicillin to broaden bactericidal activity against anaerobes, especially Bacteroides fragilis. Aminoglycosides lack efficacy against anaerobic bacteria and have poor penetration into respiratory tract secretions but still are administered with penicillin. Third-generation cephalosporins such as ceftiofur sodium, with activity against gram-negative aerobes and facultative anaerobes, showed excellent efficacy in the treatment of spontaneous clinical and posttransport pneumonia associated with Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Actinobacillus spp., and Pasteurella spp. 307 Depending on the clinical response of the horse, 10 to 14 days after the onset of initial therapy, the clinician usually replaces parenteral antimicrobials with oral antibiotics. Chloramphenicol, a bacteriostatic drug, has excellent broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic bacteria and can be given orally. (One must use caution when handling the drug.) Enrofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, has excellent antibacterial action against aerobic gram-negative bacteria, many gram-positive bacteria, and mycoplasma bacteria but has limited activity against Streptococcus spp. and anaerobes. 308 Concentrations of the enrofloxacin in lung tissue are similar to those in serum. 309 Erythromycin and rifampin attain good concentrations in the lung and pleural fluid and within phagocytic cells, but rifampin is expensive and erythromycin may induce a fatal colitis, precluding their use in adult horses. 310 Antimicrobial therapy should continue for 2 to 4 months until the horse is gaining weight, hematologic and serum chemistry values have normalized, and no evidence of respiratory tract disease exists. One should implement limited exercise (hand walking) and avoidance of stress. One should reevaluate refractory cases using the techniques of ultrasonography, thoracocentesis, or transtracheal aspiration to determine if drug resistance has developed, if additional pathogens are involved, or if untoward sequelae have occurred (see the following discussion).",

As described previously, pleural effusions in the horse most commonly occur with bacterial pneumonia or lung abscesses. 316 (See the section on treatment for parapneumonic effusions.) Pleural effusions also may accompany a number of thoracic neoplasms such as fibrosarcoma, gastric squamous cell carcinoma, hepatoblastoma, hemangiosarcoma, melanoma, mesothelioma, and metastatic mammary or ovarian adenocarcinoma but most commonly are associated with lymphoma. [317] [318] [319] [320] [321] [322] [323] [324] [325] [326] Pleural effusion also develops in a number of other conditions, including thoracic trauma; pericarditis; peritonitis; viral, mycoplasmal, and fungal infections; congestive heart failure; liver disease; diaphragmatic herniation; hypoproteinemia; equine infectious anemia; pulmonary granulomata; and damage of the thoracic duct. 298, [327] [328] [329] Pathogenesis Pleural fluid is really the interstitial fluid of the parietal pleura. A pressure gradient driving its formation exists because the parietal pleura is supplied by the systemic circulation and because the pressure of the pleural space is more negative than that of the subpleural interstitium. 330 Pleural liquid and protein exit the pleural space via the parietal pleural stomata. Fluid production in the pleural space increases if any of the following occur: (1) an elevation of the hydrostatic pressure gradient (congestive heart failure, portal hypertension); (2) a decrease in the colloid osmotic pressures (hypoproteinemia); (3) an increased permeability of the capillary vessels (infection, malignancy, inflammation); or (4) a decreased removal of fluid because of impaired lymphatic drainage (neoplasia) or a decrease in the pleural space (atelectasis). 331 Excessive amounts of peritoneal fluid may accumulate in the pleural cavity as the fluid moves through diaphragmatic defects or through diaphragmatic lymphatics. 330",

Adapting protocols from human medicine 332 (as successful management of malignant effusions in equine medicine has not been described) requires that the horse first be sedated.

Fungal pneumonia and pleuritis result from inhalation of windborne arthrospores. Lymphohematogenous dissemination of the organisms may lead to the development of lesions in the bones, skin, and meninges. 335 Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeastlike fungus that reproduces by budding, forming cells 4 to 7 \u00b5m in diameter. The organism has a predilection for the respiratory tract and for the central nervous system. The proposed route of infection is via inhalation with secondary hematogenous spread to the central nervous system. When C. neoformans replicates within the host or on culture media, the organism forms a large polysaccharide capsule that appears as a clear halo around the cell when organisms are stained with India ink. 336 The capsule is antiphagocytic and immunosuppressive: secretion of capsular antigens into the body fluids binds opsonizing antibody before it reaches the organism. Based on the capsular antigens, two varieties of C. neoformans exist: C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotypes A and D) and C. neoformans var. gatti (serotypes B and C).",

Electron microscopy has revealed two parasite forms: trophozoite and cystic. The trophozoite is an ameboid form 2 to 5 \u00b5m in diameter with filopodia that attach to the surface of the type I epithelial cells. The trophozoite is visible with hematoxylin and eosin stains. The mature cyst is 4 to 6 \u00b5m in diameter and contains eight uninucleate intracytic bodies. The cyst stains with Gomori's methenamine silver stain and periodic acid-Schiff stain. In keeping with the new taxonomic classification, some authors recommend replacing the terminology of the different parasite forms by the terms yeast cell (trophozoite), sporangia (cyst), and spores (intracystic bodies). 348 The infective stage or source of P. carinii is unknown, although several studies have reported discovery of P. carinii DNA in water and air samples, suggesting that these are environmental reservoirs. 349 In rodent models, P. carinii can be transmitted from one animal to another via the airborne route. Researchers also believe that once the organism enters the lower respiratory tract of an immunocompetent host, it remains as a lung saprophyte only to be reactivated during periods of immunosuppression. 347",

For example, Blastomyces dermatitidis is endemic to the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio River basins; the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba; the Great Lakes region; and the Eastern seaboard. 334 Although Histoplasma capsulatum is also endemic to the Mississippi, Ohio and St. Lawrence River valleys, it also is found in the southern United States. 338, 352 Coccidiodoes immitis is endemic to the arid and semiarid regions of North America, including the states of California, Texas, Arizonia, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah. 335, 353 In contrast, Cryptococcus neoformans is widespread, being found in high concentrations in the soil and in avian manure (C. neoformans var. neoformans). In Australia, an epizootiologic relationship of C. neoformans var. gatti exists with the eucalyptus tree (Eucalyptus camaldulensis). Environmental dispersal of the fungus coincides with flowering of the eucalyptus tree in the spring, resulting in greater exposure and more cases of disease during that time. 354 For the opportunistic fungus Pneumocystis carinii, human clinical infections develop only in immunodepressed subjects, those individuals with low CD4 + counts, with certain viral infections (cytomegalovirus), or in weakened nutritional states. 347, 348 To date, all reported cases of equine pneumocystosis have occurred in foals 1.5 to 4 months of age. Predisposing factors include the existence of a combined immunodeficiency disorder, 343 Rhodococcus equi or chronic bacterial pneumonia, 344, 355 low CD4 + counts, 356 and chronic debilitation or weight loss. 357, 358 In two reports of equine pneumocystosis, predisposing factors could not be identified. 359, 360 The occurrence of pneumocystosis in young foals may reflect an age-dependent maturation of the immune system. Cell-mediated immune responses (in vitro) of foals less than 2 months of age are reduced relative to those of adult horses, perhaps increasing the susceptibility of the foal to pneumocystosis. 361",

Nevertheless, pulmonary aspergillosis also has been reported in horses with pleuropneumonia, myositis, renal failure, pituitary adenoma, and myelomonocytic leukemia. 342, 345, 346 Horses with pulmonary aspergillosis suddenly may become febrile and tachypneic and may exhibit adventitious lung or pleural sounds and have a nasal discharge. Other horses with pulmonary aspergillosis may show only mild respiratory signs or fail to demonstrate any abnormalities of the respiratory tract. 342, 374, 375 Pneumocystosis is a rare clinical entity. In the majority of cases, foals have evidence of chronic respiratory disease that has progressed to respiratory distress. Weight loss, dehydration, and inappetence also may be evident. 344, [356] [357] [358] 360 Diagnosis Tracheobronchial aspirates may reveal degenerated neutrophils, yeast cells, and bacteria. In the case of aspergillosis, the diagnosis may be difficult because one may recover fungal elements from the tracheal washings of normal horses. 24 Definitive diagnosis may require repeated isolation of the Aspergillus organisms or histologic demonstration of hyphal elements in the pulmonary parenchyma. Transtracheal aspirates may be of limited usefulness in diagnosing pneumocystosis because the organism rarely is isolated by this method. For horses not in respiratory distress, isolation of the organism may be possible by bronchoalveolar lavage or endobronchial brushings. 344, [356] [357] [358] In horses with fungal pneumonia, radiographs may reveal circular masses with or without fluid lines and an accentuated interstitial pattern. Radiography or ultrasonography may detect pleural effusion.",

In cryptococcosis, serologic detection of capsular antigens (serum latex agglutination test) also has proved effective in the diagnosis. 364, 370 However, the histoplasmin skin test is of little diagnostic value: in one endemic area, 73% of horses had a postive skin test. 376 Serologic diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis can be difficult because titers are detectable in healthy and diseased horses. 342 Nevertheless, Moore, Reed, Kowalski, et al. 377 reported the existence of two precipitin bands against Aspergillus antigens in a horse confirmed to have an Aspergillus mediastinal granuloma. Precipitin bands were not evident in the eight control horses sampled. Recently, Guillot, Sarfati, DeBarros, et al. 378 reported the usefulness of an immunoblot analysis for the diagnosis of aspergillosis, detecting reactivity to low-molecular-mass antigens (22 to 26 kd) in the sera of diseased horses that was not evident in clinically healthy horses. The investigators suggested that these antigens were released during mycelial growth in the tissues, a phase that would not develop in clinically healthy horses. However, until this experimental assay is commercially available, one should use serologic diagnosis cautiously in suspected cases of pulmonary aspergillosis. One may confirm the diagnosis with lung biopsy and by the presence of other systemic alterations.",

The consensus at the International Workshop of Equine Chronic Airway Disease was that the term chronic obstructive pulmonary disease not be used to describe this condition in horses, because the pathophysiologic and morphologic aspects of the equine disease are different from human chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 395 Pulmonary function testing demonstrates a decrease in lung compliance, an increase in lung resistance, an increase in the work of breathing, and the development of arterial hypoxemia, usually in the absence of hypercapnia. 396, 397 During airway obstruction, affected horses are hyperresponsive to nonspecific stimuli such as histamine, methacholine, and water. 398",

One hypothesis is that inhalation of the organic molds, dusts, and endotoxin induces an immune response, the nature of which is controversial. A T helper cell type 2 response (TH2), involving IgE-mediated degranulation of mast cells, has been proposed as the inciting cause because of the findings of (1) increased anti-Micropolyspora faeni and anti-Aspergillus fumigatus IgA and IgE concentrations in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of asymptomatic and symptomatic heavesaffected horses, 403 (2) increased histamine levels in the BAL fluid of heaves-affected horses 5 hours after natural challenge, 404 (3) increased serum IgE levels against recombinant Aspergillus antigens in heaves-affected horses, 405 and (4) increased numbers of BAL cells that are positive for IL-4 and IL-5 messenger RNA in heaves-affected horses. 406 A T helper cell type 1 immune reaction with secondary neutrophil influx and release of cytokines also has been implicated in the pathogenesis of heaves because (1) correlation of antigen-specific IgE levels with expression of disease is not absolute, 405, 407 (2) pulmonary eosinophilia, as occurs in the TH2 disorder of human asthma, is not a feature of heaves, 408 (3) increases in BAL fluid allergenspecific IgGa and IgGb noted by Halliwell, McGorum, Irving, et al. are more compatible with a TH1 rather than with a TH2 response, 403 and (4) quantitative PCR analysis of BAL lymphocytes demonstrates an increase in TH1 (interferon-\u03b3) but not TH2 (IL-4, IL-5) associated cytokines. 409, 410 In horses with heaves, IL-8 concentrations in the bronchoalveolar fluid are increased relative to levels found in healthy horses. 410, 411 This cytokine may be derived from macrophages, neutrophils, or airway epithelial cells and is one of the primary chemoattractants for neutrophil migration into the airways. Interestingly, in murine models of obstructive airway disease, airway epithelial cell production of IL-8 is upregulated by interferon-\u03b3 and IL-17. 412 Because the mRNA levels of IL-17, a T cell-derived cytokine, also increased in airway lymphocytes isolated from heaves-affected horses (Ainsworth, unpublished data), a link between the airway TH1 responses and epithelial-derived chemokines may exist.",

Art, Kirschvink, Smith, et al. 413 suggested that an oxidative stress caused by the release of reactive oxygen species from granulocytes and macrophages develops in the airways of heavesaffected horses. Their conclusion is based on the finding that oxidized glutathione levels and glutathione redox ratios (the ratios of oxidized glutathione to total glutathione levels) are elevated in the pulmonary epithelial lining fluid of heaves-affected horses relative to controls. They further suggested that the oxidant stress does not incite but rather exacerbates the existing inflammation. Interestingly, oxidative stress 414 has been found to activate NF\u03baB, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules including tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. 415 Recently, Bureau, Bonizzi, Kirschvink, et al. 416 demonstrated that levels of NF\u03baB in the bronchial brushing cells of heaves-affected horses were increased many times, the magnitude of which correlated with the severity of the clinical disease. Furthermore, the airway epithelial cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, a protein required for migration of neutrophils from the pulmonary vasculature into the lung parenchyma, paralleled the expression of NF\u03baB, suggesting that this protein, along with IL-8, enhances the airway neutrophilia.",

Unless pasture exacerbates the condition, the owner should keep horses outside, blanket them in the winter, and allow access to a three-walled shelter affording protection from the wind and rain. If the horse is stabled, the stall bedding should be shredded paper, shavings, peat moss, or clay to eliminate dusts and molds. The surrounding stalls should be bedded similarly. Although such stabling changes improve lung function somewhat, airway hyperreactivity still remains. 426, 427 Medical management also has been indicated in clinical cases because stabling alone takes several weeks to quiet the pulmonary inflammation. Corticosteroids are efficacious in reducing the inflammatory reaction in the lungs, whereas nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs provide no benefit. The clinician initially may give prednisolone (not prednisone) at 2.2 mg/kg orally once daily in the morning for 7 to 10 days, 1.1 mg/kg once daily for 7 to 10 days, 0.50 mg/kg once daily for 7 to 10 days, and 0.50 mg/lb every other day for 7 to 10 days. Alternatively, one may give a course of dexamethasone parenterally. For the 500 kg horse, the course is 40 mg intramuscularly once daily every other day for three treatments, followed by 35 mg intramuscularly once daily every other day for three treatments, 30 mg intramuscularly once daily every other day for three treatments, etc., until the horse is weaned off of the dexamethasone.

Experimental investigations with clenbuterol suggest that when given at a dose of 0.8 \u00b5g/kg once daily by mouth, the drug may be efficacious in alleviating some of the signs of heaves. In addition to a direct smooth muscle effect, clenbuterol also may stabilize mast cells, increase mucociliary clearance, and improve airway secretions. 428 Albuterol is absorbed poorly from the gastrointestinal tract, so inhalation is the recommended method of administration. Some suggested dosages of \u03b2 2 -agonists that can be administered by metered dose inhalers through the Aeromask are these: albuterol, 720 \u00b5g 3 to 4 times daily; fenoterol, 1 to 2 \u00b5g 3 to 4 times daily; and salmeterol, 210 \u00b5g once or twice daily.

Atropine provides clinical improvement when administered intravenously at 0.02 mg/kg, but the duration of effect is short-lived (2 hours) and atropine may be associated with the development of ileus, abdominal pain, tachycardia, mydriasis, and thickening of airway secretions. 430 Atropine generally is used for emergency relief of airway obstruction. Glycopyrrolate has been reported to be efficacious at a dose of 0.007 mg/kg, but it also may cause colic.

In an experimental study, Tyler, Pascoe, Aguilera-Tejero, et al. found that instillation of blood caused a neutrophilic pulmonary inflammatory reaction in the lungs, leading them to conclude that pulmonary hemorrhage may contribute to IAD. 442 Evidence that inhaled environmental allergens from hay or straw contribute to IAD is supported by the observations that episodes of IAD are shorter in horses bedded on shredded paper 434 and that stabling is associated with an increase in the proportion of BAL fluid neutrophils and a decrease in the percentage of lymphocytes. 91 Hare and Viel 443 also have suggested that a type I (IgE-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction to inhaled environment allergens could be the cause of IAD. They studied young Standardbred racehorses with a history of poor performance and found evidence of peripheral blood and BAL fluid eosinophilia (12% eosinophils). Normally the percentage of eosinophils in BAL fluid is less than 2%. Because they found no evidence of pulmonary or intestinal parasitism in this group of affected horses, the investigators attributed the eosinophilic IAD to an allergic reaction.",

When the sporangia rupture, the infective larvae disperse with the fungal spores. After the infective larvae (0.4 mm) are ingested, they migrate through the gut wall and are carried to the lungs via the lymphatics. In hosts in which infections are patent, the larvae mature to egg-laying adults in the peripheral bronchioles. The prepatent period is approximately 2 to 3 months. Eggs are transported out of the lungs by the mucociliary apparatus, swallowed, and excreted in the feces where they become infective by 4 days. 450 First-stage larvae have survived for at least 49 days but do not survive over the winter. 451 In horses and ponies, larval development in the lungs is arrested (fifth stage), but airway inflammation still occurs.",

Thus in the caudodorsal lung, these mechanical forces would be borne over a narrow area, leading to parenchymal tearing or rupture of capillaries during inspiration. However, evidence of widespread hemorrhage in the dorsal portions of the lung suggests that the distribution of extremely negative intrapleural pressures is more complex and not simply restricted to the region in close proximity to the caudal dorsal lung. An alternative mechanical theory has proposed that forelimb locomotory impact forces are transmitted through the chest wall, setting up waves converging caudodorsally in the lung parenchyma. 465 Experimental evidence supporting the mechanical theories is currently not available.",

Stress failure is thought to occur following development of high transmural pressures, the pressure difference between the pulmonary capillary bed and the adjacent alveoli. Pulmonary capillary pressures (which may exceed 70 mm Hg in strenuously exercised horses) disrupt capillary endothelial and alveolar epithelial tight junctions leading to hemorrhage within the interstitium and alveoli. The pulmonary hypertension is a consequence of the high cardiac output, the lack of sufficient pulmonary vascular vasodilation and the increased blood viscosity during exercise. Evidence supportive of the stress failure theory is provided by electronmicrographs prepared from lung segments taken from strenuously exercised horses. These demonstrate a breakdown of the endothelial and epithelial tight junctions and exudation of red blood cells into the alveoli. 466 Although some investigators have found no correlation between pulmonary capillary pressures in exercising horses and the development of EIPH ascertained endoscopically, 467 others have found a correlation between mean pulmonary artery pressures in exercising horses and the number of erythrocytes in postexercise bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. 468 A combination of these three mechanisms likely may contribute to the development of EIPH.",

The most common primary lung neoplasm is the granular cell tumor, with a prevalence rate of 0.15%. Most granular cell tumors involve the right lung, may be multiple or single masses, may be associated with airway obstruction, and are visible with endoscopic examination. 491, 492 Based on immunohistochemical staining, granular cell tumors are thought to be composed primarily of myelinating Schwann cells with lesser numbers of scattered nonmyelinating Schwann cells. 501, 502 Metastatic lung tumors include adenocarcinoma (primary sites of origin are in the kidney, uterus, thyroid, ovary, and mammary gland), 323,324 hemangiosarcoma (primary sites of origin are in the skeletal musculature or are undetermined), 326,503-510 and lymphoma. 326, 500 Hemangiosarcoma remains a rare tumor, occurring in 2 in 1322 horses in a study by Sundbery, Burnstein, Page, et al. 487 and in 1 in 4739 cases in a survey reported by Hargis and McElwain. 506 Many of the reported cases of hemangiosarcoma involve horses less than 7 years of age. 503, [507] [508] [509] [510] Typically, horses exhibit pallor of the mucous membranes because of anemia, have evidence of pleural effusion (hemorrhagic fluid) or pulmonary hemorrhage, 508 and exhibit rapid clinical deterioration.",

Transtracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavages, cytologic aspirates, histologic examination of biopsy specimens, and thoracocentesis may aid in the diagnosis. Radiographic or ultrasonographic evidence of multifocal interstitial densities (2 to 3 cm in diameter), tracheal elevation, or mediastinal densities also suggest neoplasms.",

Tracheal compression following abscessation of the cranial mediastinal lymph nodes. Tracheal compression has been reported. The horse may show respiratory distress or exhibit stertorous breathing. Laryngeal hemiplegia may be an additional complication if the abscess compressing the trachea involves the recurrent laryngeal nerves. 174 8. Endocarditis or myocarditis following abscess formation. 9. Agalactia in periparturient mares. 10. Suppurative necrotic bronchopneumonia, which may result in death. 11. Abscess formation in the central nervous system. 175 12. Myopathies. Two types of muscle disorders associated with S. equi infection have been described recently. One fatal form is characterized by a vasculitis and infarction of skeletal muscle and pulmonary and gastrointestinal tissues. Horses typically have signs of colic and usually are euthanized because of unrelenting pain. Postmortem examination reveals muscle infarctions that are compatible with purpura hemorrhagica. The second type of muscle disorder affects Quarter Horses that have malaise, significant muscle atrophy, and chronic active rhabdomyolysis. Immunocytochemical stains of fast-twitch fibers are positive for equine IgG. Horses responded to treatment with penicillin and dexamethasone with the muscle mass normalizing within 2 months. 176 The clinician should follow these control measures to reduce transmission of S. equi during an outbreak 177 : 1. Prevent spread of infection to horses on other premises and to new arrivals immediately by stopping all movement of horses on and off the premises. 2. Identify symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers by sampling nasopharygneal or guttural pouch regions at weekly intervals and testing for S. equi by culture and PCR. 3. Isolate infectious horses from those screened negative for S. equi. Cordon off the isolation area and have infectious horses looked after by a dedicated staff wearing protective clothing and footgear. Disinfect stalls, aisles, and equipment. 4. Once clinical signs have disappeared, perform at least three consecutive swabs or lavages for S. equi culture, coupled with endoscopic examination of the guttural pouches to confirm that horses are noninfectious. Prevention Vaccines currently available include Strepguard with Havlogen (S. equi extract); Strepvax II (aluminum hydroxide adjuvanted S. equi extract), and Pinnacle I.N. (an attenuated live culture of S. equi).",
