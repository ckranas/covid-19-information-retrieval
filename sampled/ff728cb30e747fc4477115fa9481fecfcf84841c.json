            "text": "The incidence of invasive fungal infections has increased dramatically over the past two decades, mostly due to an increase in the number of immunocompromised patients. l -4 Patients who undergo chemotherapy for a variety of diseases, patients with organ transplants, and patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome have contributed most to the increase in fungal infections. s The actual incidence of invasive fungal infections in transplant patients ranges from 15% to 25% in bone marrow transplant recipients to 5% to 42% in solid organ transplant recipients. 6 ,7 The most frequently encountered are Aspergillus species, followed by Cryptococcus and Candida species. Fungal infections are also associated with a higher mortality than either bacterial or viral infections in these patient popUlations. This is because of the limited number of available therapies, dose-limiting toxicities of the antifungal drugs, fewer symptoms due to lack of inflammatory response, and the lack of sensitive tests to aid in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. I A study of patients with fungal infections admitted to a university-affiliated hospital indicated that communityacquired infections are becoming a serious problem; 67% of the 140 patients had community-acquired fungal pneumonia. 8 There is also an increase in nosocomial fungal infections. 9 Fungi are eukaryotic, unicellular to multicellular organisms that have chitinous cell walls, and reproduce asexually, sexually, or both ways. Fungal cells are larger and genomically more complex than bacteria. Their cell wall contains polysaccharides, proteins, and sugars, and their antigens are rich in complex polysaccharides and glycoproteins. Plasma membranes of fungi contain ergosterol, which is the primary target for antifungals such as amphotericin B. Although there are more than 1.3 million fungal species in the environment, only about 150 are known to be pathogenic to humans. For detailed taxonomy of the fungi, several texts are available. W- 12 The virulence factors of fungi resemble those of bacteria, such as possession of a capsule, adhesion molecules, toxins, free radicals, etc.",

Pathogenicity of fungi depends on the virulence of the particular fungus, the infecting dose, the route of infection, and the immune status of the host. Other factors that influence the pathogenicity include the coexistence of other infections in the host, the organs affected, and other underlying diseases. There is no clear-cut evidence that fungal infections are contagious, with the exception of dermatophytoses, pityriasis versicolor, and candidiasis of the newborn. However, accidental inoculation or direct contamination of an open wound can result in transmission of the etiologic agent of infection. 13 Hence care should be taken to avoid direct contact when handling contaminated bodily discharges and tissues.",

Fungi that cause invasive pulmonary infection can be divided in two main groups: (1) primary or true pathogens, and (2) opportunistic pathogens. The primary or true pathogenic fungi (also referred to as endemic fungi) infect healthy, immunologically competent individuals. 15 , 16 These fungi can be very aggressive, and produce severe disseminated and fatal infections in immunocompromised patients. While endemic fungi such as Histoplasma capsulatum and Coccidioides immitis are the most common, a number of other fungi have emerged as important, though less common pathogens. Penicillium marneffei, Fusarium species, Scedosporium species, and Malassezia species are increasing in incidence as opportunistic infections in immunocompromised hosts, especially in those with 350 AIDS. 17 ,1 8 Each of these fungi can cause systemic life threatening infections. In contrast, the opportunistic fungi cause infections in critically ill or immunosuppressed patients. Almost all opportunistic fungi gain entry through the lungs, except endogenous Candida spp. The most common opportunistic mycoses include candidiasis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, zygomycosis, pseudallescheriasis, fusariosis, and trichosporonosis.",

Other conditions that predispose to opportunistic infections include malignancies, especially leukemia and lymphomas, chronic lung diseases, abdominal surgery, burns, diabetes mellitus, Cushing's syndrome, malnutrition, uremia, alcohol abuse with cirrhosis, drug abuse, congenital immunodeficiency syndromes, and AIDS. 5 ,18.21 Epidemiologic factors such as an increasing aging population and migration of susceptible persons into highly endemic areas also contribute to the increase in opportunistic infections, 22 Host factors responsible for increased susceptibility to fungal infections include (1) a decrease in the number or functional impairment of mature granulocytes and mononuclearphagocytes, (2) depressed B-Iymphocyte (humoral) immunity resulting in decreased production of immunoglobulins and impaired opsonization, (3) depressed Tlymphocyte (cell-mediated) immunity, (4) abnormal host immune-regulation,20.23.24 and (5) neutropenia. Other factors include disruption of mucosal and skin barriers, disorders of complement system, and hereditary immune dysfunctions. 23 .24 Fungal infections in severely immunocompromised patients present with clinical features that are often different from immunocompetent patients. The tissue response is also different. There may be little or no inflammatory response with even massive infection, and there may not be granuloma formation.

One of the major advancements over the past two decades has been in the culture and recovery of fungi from blood.1.26 Biphasic systems were the first advancement in the broth-based culture system, This was followed by the development of lysis centrifugation, involving the incorporation of a tube containing an anticoagulant and a lytic agent, centrifugation, and placement of the pellet on solid media. Although labor intensive and relatively expensive, this method has become the \"gold standard\" for recovery of fungi from blood.27.2 8 Automated blood culture systems have been developed, that are superior in their recovery of yeast from blood. 29 Despite these advances in technology, isolation of fungi from blood cultures is an insensitive marker for invasive fungal infections, and often takes several days to weeks for growth, resulting in delays in treatment. Fungemia was found in only 28% of patients with autopsyproven invasive candidiasis in one series, and only 58% of patients with two or more visceral infections had fungemia. 30 Most of the fungi that cause invasive pulmonary infections can be cultured on standard media; however, culture and characterization may take up to 2 to 4 weeks.",

Histology also provides evidence of host response to invasive infection or allergic reactions, for example invasive vs. allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Because of their size, chemical composition, and morphologic diversity, many fungi can be identified in tissue sections by either conventional microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections, or by the use of special stains. In tissue, fungi usually occur either as hyphae, budding yeast-like cells, endosporulating spherules, or a combination of these forms. 31 Certain fungi can be specifically identified because they have a distinctive morphology in tissue. When classic forms are observed, an etiologic diagnosis can be made: for example, adiaspiromycosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis capsula tum, histoplasmosis dubois ii, paracoccidioidomycosis, penicilliosis marneffei, protothecosis, rhinosporidiosis, and sporotrichosis. In this group of fungi only one species of fungus is the cause of each particular mycosis. Other mycoses are caused by any of the several species of a genus, all of which appear morphologically similar in tissue sections. Although these mycologic agents cannot be identified as to species by conventional histologic methods, the disease that they cause can be diagnosed generically; for example, aspergillosis, candidiasis, and trichosporonosis. Still other mycoses are caused by any of a number of fungi belonging to different genera. These fungi appear similar, if not identical to one another in tissue, and although it is not possible to identify the etiologic agent, the mycosis can be named. This group includes diseases such as phaeohyphomycosis and zygomycosis.",

            "text": "The main disadvantage of special fungal stains is that they mask the natural color of pigmented fungi, making it impossible to determine whether a fungus is colorless, hyaline, or dematiaceous (pigmented). Such a determination is crucial in the histologic diagnosis of mycosis caused by dematiaceous fungi such as phaeohyphomycosis.lO As a rule special fungal stains do not adequately demonstrate the inflammatory response to fungal invasion. To counteract this, a GMS-stained section can be counterstained with H&E for a simultaneous study of the fungus and the host response. Calcific bodies that are sometimes found in caseous granulomas are also stained with H&E, and can be mistaken for yeastlike fungi. This is especially true when calcific bodies are apposed to give the false impression of budding yeasts, or when the bodies are laminated to give the appearance of a capsule or thick cell wall. Best stains to avoid this misinterpretation are GMS and GF, because the chromic acid used as an oxidizer in these stains dissolves the calcium, leaving the calcific bodies unstained.",

This staining reaction usually differentiates Cryptococcus from other fungi of similar morphology. In some cases, however, poorly encapsulated cryptococci in tissue sections may not stain positive with mucicarmine mucin stains. 3 Furthermore, mucin stains are not specific for C. neoformans; the cell walls of Blastomyces dermatitidis and Rhinosporidium seeberi are often colored to varying degrees with the mucin stains. However, the latter two fungi are nonencapsulated and morphologically distinct, and not ordinarily mistaken for cryptococci. The cell wall of C. neoformans contains silver reducing substances, possibly melanin precursors, and can be stained with the Fontana-Masson silver procedure for melanin.40 This stain is especially useful in those cases of cryptococcosis with invasive yeast forms that do not have readily detectable capsules, the so-called dry variants. Such forms could possibly be confused with nonencapsulated yeasts of similar morphology. Fontana-Masson and Lillie's ferrous iron stains for melanin can also be used to confirm and accentuate the presence of melanin or melanin-like pigments in the cell walls of poorly pigmented agents of phaeohyphomycosis in tissue sections. 41 The cytoplasm of certain fungi in tissue sections, especially the yeastlike cells of B. dermatitidis and H. capsulatum var. capsulatum is variably acid fast. 42 However, these staining properties are inconsistent and should not be used for diagnosis. The cell walls of fungi, in general, are not acid fast. The morphologic features, size, and staining characteristics of some of the common fungi are presented in Table 10 .1. bright yellow fungal autofluorescence against a deep red-orange background was observed. 4s Autofluorescence may help delineate sparse or poorly stained fungi in H&E-stained sections; however, this property is inconsistent and should not be used for definitive diagnosis. Most fungi in frozen or paraffin embedded tissue sections also stain nonspecifically with CaIcofluor white, a cotton whitener that fluoresces under ultraviolet light. 46 This rapid and simple fluorescence procedure can be routinely used in the intraoperative examination of fresh-frozen tissues for fungi.",

Rare hyphae and large irregularly shaped yeast forms have been described on or near the surface of valvular vegetations in histoplasma endocarditis. llS The yeast stains strongly with the GMS stain, often seen with narrow-based budding, in the center of the granulomas ( Fig. 10.8 ). Nonviable yeast forms within necrotic debris are also strongly positive. In fact, within the central area of old coin lesions, the cell walls of the yeast are often visible with GMS stain.",

In contrast, yeast cells are relatively sparse in mild, self-limited, chronic, progressive pulmonary infections. In the very young and in persons who are immunosuppressed, the host response is predominantly histiocytic and characterized by intracellular multiplication of the fungi. The dispersed infiltrates of yeast-laden histiocytes often efface the normal architecture of an organ, and widespread involvement of the mononuclear phagocyte system can occur ( Fig. 10.9 ). In patients with profound cell-mediated immunodeficiency, for example in AIDS, the yeast forms multiply profusely and sometimes form extracellular \"yeast lakes\" associated with bland necrosis. In immunocompetent hosts and patients with the adult form of disseminated disease, the fungus usually elicits an epithelioid and giant cell granulomatous response with or without caseation ( Fig. 10.8 ). Slowly evolving permanent granulomas may be followed by cavitation, fibrosis, emphysema, and calcifications ( Fig. 10.7) .",

Lung section with blastomycosis has multiple tan nodules, some adjacent to airways. lar macrophages or neutrophils. The initial reaction of the tissues to blastomyces is by neutrophils, which are later replaced by monocytes and macrophages. Histologically, the lesions are characterized by abscess-like neutrophilic collections that are rimmed by epithelioid or palisaded macrophages or multinucleated giant cells ( Fig. 10 .12). 184 Yeast cells are usually numerous in the edge of the abscess. Around these foci may be nonspecific chronic inflammation. In contrast to tuberculosis and histoplasmosis, caseous necrosis and calcification are not usually seen. Chronic pulmonary lesions show fibrosis and hyalinization of the nodules, similar to that seen in other chronic granulomatous diseases, and may be accompanied by cavitation ( Fig. 10.13 ). The host response in early pulmonary and disseminated lesions is often exuberant, with distention of the alveolar spaces sometimes with an enormous number of proliferating yeast cells that elicit minimal host response, resembling the paucireactive picture often seen in cryptococcosis ( Fig. 10 .14).185 Within days to weeks of inhalation, a granulomatous response develops around the fungi with epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and multinucleated giant cells of both A.K. Haque and M.R. McGinnis foreign-body type and Langhans' type surrounding the foci of suppurative necrosis and caseation ( Fig. 10.12) . A primary pulmonary-lymph node complex is sometimes found, but is much less frequent than seen in histoplasmosis capsulati. 185 In chronic pulmonary blastomycosis, fibrosis is common and is often accompanied by cavitation.

Once isolated, the identity of the isolate as B. dermatitidis can be confirmed with DNA-based methods. This is necessary because fungi such as the Chrysosporium species are morphologically similar to B. dermatitidis in culture. Because B. dermatitidis and the other dimorphic fungi are not sensitive to cycloheximide, cultured media containing this antifungal agent can be used. More rapid diagnosis is achieved by demonstrating classic yeast cells with broadbased buds in clinical specimens from patients with either acute or chronic infection. Diagnosis of blastomycosis by direct microscopic examination of Papanicolaou stained smears of respiratory secretions is well documented; the fungi are seen as large pink or red, thick-walled yeasts. 153 .189.190 When fungal elements are atypical or sparse, direct immunofluorescence using a specific conjugate directed against fungal cell wall polysaccharide antigens is valuable for identifying B. dermatitidis in smears 365 or tissue sections. 184 Serologic tests using the purified B. dermatitidis (A) antigen are rapid, specific, and provide presumptive evidence of infection. 179, 191 The differential diagnosis of B. dermatitidis includes H. capsulatum var. duboisii, which is of similar size and shape; however, H. capsulatum var. duboisii has narrowbased budding. Also included in the differential diagnosis is Cryptococcus, from which Blastomyces can be distinguished by being negative with mucicarmine stain. H. capsulatum is much smaller and lacks the broad-based budding and double contoured cell wall. Blastomyces can be mistaken for Coccidioides immitis, especially in KOH preparations of tissue. l92 The presence of a coccidioidal spherule distinguishes these two fungi. Ancillary tests that may help in tissue sections include direct immunofluorescence antibody studies. Molecular methods are not contributory toward the pathologic diagnosis in tissue sections at this time, but PCR shows promise.",

The disease occurs predominantly in males after the age of puberty.245-247 This clinical feature is related to the glucans in the cell wall of the fungus that are influenced by female hormones. The disease is caused by a single species, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Primary infection begins in the lungs; dissemination occurs eventually in most patients and may involve the mucosa of the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract, and the skin, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, adrenal glands, intestines, and other organs?48 Although some cases occur in Mexico and much of Central America, paracoccidioidomycosis is found primarily in South America, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions of Brazil, Columbia, and Venezuela.245-247 Cases diagnosed in the United States have been acquired in Latin America, and most of the cases diagnosed in the United States represent reactivation of quiescent pulmonary disease following long latent periods of up to 3 to 20 years.

Most of the yeast-like cells in pulmonary or extra thoracic lesions have single to multiple blastoconidia. However, unless confirmed by direct immunofluorescence, the specific histologic diagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis is warranted only when typical multiple budding cells are identified ( Fig. 10.23 ). Two patterns of budding are found: the large teardrop blastoconidi a (attached to the parent cell by narrow necks), and smaller oval or tubular blastoconidia ( Fig. 10.23 ). Hyphae and pseudohyphae are rarely produced. Yeast cells with fractured walls, so-called mosaic forms, are almost constantly present in chronic pulmonary lesions. Although characteristic, they are not specific for this disease (Fig.  1O .23B). Small yeast cells 2 to 4f.lm in diameter are occasionally predominant in the lesions and can be mistaken for the cells of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum. 266 Confusion with H. capsulatum and other yeast in tissue sections can be resolved by direct immunofluorescence, or by the identification of typical multiple budding cells and wide variation in cell size in the lesions of paracoccidioidomycosis. In active granulomatous lesions, the cells of P. brasiliensis are found within the cytoplasm of histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells. In necrotic granulomas, the yeast cells are found within necrotic material and are concentrated peripherally at the interface between necrosis and granuloma.",

Defective cell-mediated immunity may result in severe, progressive, but localized lymphocutaneous infection, as seen in chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, or in invasive bronchopulmonary candidiasis, as seen in some patients with AIDS and with bone marrow transplant. 325 -327 Factors that impair host defense mechanisms predispose to invasive candidiasis. Thus, breaks in the barriers such as trauma, burns, peritoneal dialysis, gastrointestinal surgery, mucosal ulcers, and indwelling venous catheters permit mucosal invasion or provide direct access to the vascular system. 318 ,319,328,329 Neutropenia, induced by acute leukemia and chemotherapy, and defective leukocyte function caused by corticosteroid therapy impair phagocytosis and killing of the Candida species.33O-332 Broadspectrum antibiotic therapy promotes local overgrowth and mucosal colonization by C albicans. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids, and neutropenia are a potent predisposing combination and account for the high incidence of candidiasis in patients treated for acute leukemia and lymphoma. Other predisposing factors include parenteral hyperalimentation, prematurity, diabetes mellitus, and associated bacterial infections. 328 ,333 In a study of 325 premature infants, 8.6% developed C albicans or C parapsilosis infection. 334 The presence of premature rupture of membranes and duration of ventilation were significant risk factors.

Positive cultures of sputum, bronchoscopy specimens, urine, and feces are usually diagnostically inconclusive. Blood cultures, widely considered to be diagnostically insensitive, are negative in 50% to 60% of patients with disseminated candidiasis. However, a positive blood culture may indicate only transient candidemia and does not prove that an actually invasive infection is present. Immunohistochemical studies suggest that invasive Candida pneumonia can be distinguished from noninvasive aspiration, colonization, or specimen contamination by C. albicans on the basis of the character, extent, and distribution of Candida antigen in histologic sections. 345 At present, the demonstration of typical budding yeast cells and pseudo hyphae in a lung biopsy specimen from an immunocompromised patient is evidence of candidiasis. 379 Although conclusive evidence of pulmonary candidiasis often requires histologic demonstration of pulmonary parenchymal invasion or isolation in culture of a Candida species from material obtained by transthoracic needle aspiration of a pulmonary lesion, molecular techniques are now available for definitive diagnosis. Candida species can also be diagnosed generically in deparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue with direct immunofluorescence or by immunoperoxidase staining. 345 ,352 Many special techniques including autofluorescence, whitening agents such as Calcofluor white, direct immunofluorescence (IF), immunohistochemistry using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, DNA or RNA probes, and PCR techniques are now available. 353 -356 Molecular analysis using Southern blotting with Ca3 probe hybridization is available for definitive diagnosis of different strains of Candida. 322 Aspergillosis Aspergillosis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients, and has become an increasingly serious problem with the use of corticosteroid, immunosuppressive, and antineoplastic drugs, and for those with organ transplants.362-364 Aspergillosis, however, is not a common infection associated with AIDS. The cause of this paradox may be related to the relative preservation of neutrophil and macrophage function in AIDS. 363 ,365 In a large retrospective study of patients with aspergillosis, the most common predisposing factors were hematologic disease, particularly those with bone marrow transplantation, leukemia, and lymphoma, in 61 % of patients. 366 In later studies, the majority of fungal infections were caused by Aspergillus species, with an incidence of 4% to 10%?

Antifungal therapy is unnecessary in these cases. These patients may rarely develop specific antibodies and symptoms of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (see above and Chapter 15). Upper airway aspergillosis resulting in sinusitis is not uncommon, and has an incidence of approximately 3 %.377-379 Aspergillus tracheitis, bronchitis, and laryngitis are uncommon. 363.380 Aspergilloma (fungus ball) develops when aspergilli colonize a preformed pulmonary cavity, often secondary to tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, or as a result of other fibrocavitary diseases such as histoplasmosis, asbestosis, lung abscess, pulmonary infarct, bronchial cyst, bronchiectasis, bullous emphysema, or necrotic neoplasms?81-383 An aspergilloma may also develop secondary to invasive aspergillosis and chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (see below).

Underlying disease or conditions associated with chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inactive mycobacterial infection, sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, postradiation fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, anergy, and previous pulmonary resection.

Profound granulocytopenia (less than 500 neutrophils per square millimeter), and treatment for hematologic malignancy, particularly acute leukemia, are major risk factors for the development of IPA.374J93-397 Other factors that may predispose to development of IPA include corticosteroid therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, concurrent or recent bacterial infection, immunosuppression following organ transplantation, and exposure to large doses of aerosolized conidia. 366 ,370,392,398-401 Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis has been infrequently reported in patients with AIDS. One study reported an incidence of 0.69% among 2611 patients with AIDS, with poor survival despite treatment. 364, 383 In another series of patients with AIDS, clinical symptoms, risk factors, and radiographic findings in this group were found to be similar to those in non-AIDS patients. 362 Interestingly, patients with AIDS, however, were found to sustain the whole spectrum of Aspergillus-related lesions, a feature not seen in other risk groups. It was also found that Aspergillus infections occurred predominantly in patients with an advanced stage of AIDS. 363 Mononuclear phagocytic cells are the single most important line of defense against invasive aspergillosis; these cells ingest and kill the conidia of Aspergillus, whereas neutrophils damage the hyphal forms, probably by nonphagocytic microbicidal mechanisms. 402 Therefore, persistent granulocytopenia was found to be the only independent risk factor predisposing to IPA in patients with acute leukemia. 375 Corticosteroid treatment is another predisposing factor. 375 ,394-397 Humoral and cellular immune mechanisms appear to playa minor role in host defense against invasive aspergillosis. 375 ,402 The symptoms of IPA, like those of many other opportunistic pneumonia, are nonspecific. Patients typically develop fever unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics and new or changing pulmonary infiltrates in the setting of granulocytopenia and corticosteroid therapy. Nonproductive cough and dyspnea occur less commonly. Sputum cultures are positive in only one third of cases, and false-positive culture results are common. 376 ,394 Nevertheless, isolation of an Aspergillus species from respiratory secretions must be regarded as strong presumptive evidence of IPA in the proper clinical setting, and confirmation by other means should be aggressively sought. Blood cultures are almost always negative, and serodiagnosis is notoriously unreliable. 394 ,403 Chest radiographs show a variety of abnormalities including patchy, multifocal or diffuse bilateral areas of consolidation; nodules; peripheral wedge-shaped, pleuralbased infiltrates in an infarct pattern; and rarely bilateral miliary nodules.394-396 The nodules and infarcts may cavitate following recovery from granulocytopenia, and later develop fungus balls within the cavities. 372 ,394 Up to one third of patients have a negative chest radiograph. In a pathoradiologic correlative study, approximately 50% of patients had concurrent pulmonary infection that obscured or mimicked the radiographic lesions of IPA. 395 ",

The hyphae are 3 to 6 ~m in width, uniform in shape, regularly septate, and hyaline, with parallel walls. Branches arise at acute angles from the parent hypha, and the pattern of branching is progressive and dichotomous (of the same size as the parent hyphae) (Fig. 10.31 ; see also Figs. 10.42C and 10.53B, below). The viable hyphae are basophilic, whereas necrotic hyphae' are hyaline or eosinophilic. Although visible with H&E, hyphal morphology is best demonstrated with special stains such as GMS. The hyphae may exhibit atypical or degenerative features under certain circumstances. For example, in an aspergilloma ( Fig.  10 .32) the hyphae may appear bizarre, swollen, varicose, or globose, up to 15 ~m in diameter with irregular contours, inconspicuous septa, and abortive branches (Fig.  1O.32B) . Calcium oxalate crystals, which are recognizable by polarization, are occasionally deposited within aspergillomas or invasive disease, particularly that associated with A. niger ( Fig. 10 Nime and Hutchins. 406 It is postulated that A. niger produces oxalic acid via citrate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, followed by combination of oxalate with tissue or blood calcium resulting in precipitation of calcium oxalate. Invasive A. niger infection with oxalosis has been associated with a false-positive cytoplasmic-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (C-ANCA) leve1. 407 In fungus balls or chronic granulomatous lesions, the hyphae may be surrounded by a radiating, eosinophilic corona of proteinaceous material, referred to as the 10 . Fungal Infections Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon (Fig. lO.32C) . Aspergillus terreus may produce pyriform or globose aleurioconidia, 3 to 6!lm in diameter, on short conidiophores that arise laterally from the hyphae. 408 These can be confused with lateral blastoconidia arising from C. albicans hyphae. Occasionally conidial heads produced by Aspergillus species in cavitary lesions exposed to ambient air may be found in aspergillomas and in the lesions of necrotizing tracheobronchitis (Fig. 1O.32D,E) . The conidial heads, specialized for asexual reproduction, are structures that arise directly from vegetative mycelium. The conidial heads are composed of a vesicle, which is the terminal bulbous dilatation of the conidiophore, upon which are borne one or two layers of phialides. Conidia arise in chains from the distal ends of the phialides. A definitive histologic diagnosis of aspergillosis can be made when conidial heads are present, and their distinct morphology often may suggest which species is present (Fig.l0.32D,E) . Because the hyphae of some other opportunistic pathogens resemble those of the aspergilli, a specific histologic diagnosis of aspergillosis solely on the basis of hyphal morphology is not justified unless confirmed by culture or direct immunofluorescence.",

Aspergillomas may occasionally be multiple or bilateral. The walls of the cavities, 1 to 5 mm thick, are grayish-white and fibrous with smooth or shaggy inner surfaces. If close to the surface, the adjacent pleura is thickened and fibrotic. Microscopically the walls of the cavities are composed of vascularized fibrous connective tissue infiltrated by lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes, and occasionally neutrophils and eosinophils. Granulomas may be found occasionally, particularly in the walls of tuberculous cavities. The internal surfaces may be lined by respiratory or metaplastic epithelium that is often extensively eroded, accounting for the frequency of hemoptysis. Bronchial artery branches are usually prominent around cavities and richly vascular granulation tissue is prominent adjacent to the lumen.",

Microscopically, the fungus ball is composed of concentric or convoluted layers of radially arranged and intertwined hyphae. Variation in the density of hyphae in adjacent layers, produced by alternation of rapid and slow phases of hyphal growth, sometimes resembles the zonation that may be observed in colonies cultured on solid media. 409 In the center of the fungus ball, the hyphae are often nonviable and eosinophilic, whereas those at the periphery are baso- philic. The morphology of degenerated hyphae can be quite atypical, and these may be mistaken for other pathogens, such as the zygomycetes. Conidial heads, produced in some cases, emerge from the surface of the fungus ball and cavity wall, and are shed into the cavity. Although hyphae can be found along the surface and within the fibrous wall of the cavity, invasion into the adjacent lung parenchyma does not occur unless the host is immunocompromised. Most examples of \"invasive aspergilloma\" previously reported in the literature actually represent aspergilloma developing in IPA or CNPA. Fungus balls that develop within the lesions of IPA following restoration of bone marrow activity differ in their histogenesis from those that develop in preformed cavities, since the fungus balls are in fact autoamputated spheres of necrotic lung tissue (\"lung balls\") that contain invasive hyphae (Fig. 10.34 ).399.411 The margins of these hyphae and of lung tissue forming the cavity walls contain an unusually large number of degenerated neutrophils; these neutrophils are believed to produce the cavitary lesion and fungus ball by enzymatic digestion of the necrotic lung.",

These asymptomatic individuals can be recognized by a positive skin test reaction to coccidioidin. The remaining 40% of patients develop a spectrum of symptoms ranging from a flu-like illness to frank pneumonia following an incubation period of 1 to 4 weeks. Symptoms most often include cough, fever, headache, chest pain, dyspnea, and malaise. About 10% of symptomatic patients develop allergic manifestations such as erythema nodosum, erythema muItiforme, and arthraigias, which signify the development of hypersensitivity to C. immitis; these usually have a benign clinical course. Chest radiographs are normal in up to 20% of symptomatic patients or show predominantly soft, hazy, patchy, or segmental pneumonic infiltrates, and less commonly solitary or multiple nodules, cavitary lesions, hilar lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. 487 ,488 Chronic Progressive Coccidioidal Pneumonia Chronic progressive coccidioidal pneumonia (CPCP) develops in less than 1 % of patients hospitalized for primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. This chronic infection mimics chronic tuberculosis both clinically and radiographically. Symptoms persist for several years and sputum cultures are positive for C. immitis, complement fixation titers are often high, and skin test reactivity is usually negative, signifying loss of delayed type hypersensitivity to the fungus. Conversion of a positive skin test to a negative one indicates a poor prognosis. 486 Chest radiographs usually show biapical fibronodular lesions and multiple cavities with retraction of pulmonary parenchyma. Since host defenses in CPCP cannot successfully overcome the infection, patients must be treated with amphotericin B.",

The sexual form of the fungus is Pseudallescheria (formerly Petriellidium boydii or Allescheria boydii). 518 When the fungus is introduced by trauma into the subcutaneous tissues it may cause a mycetoma, which is a localized process characterized by tumefaction, draining sinuses, and sclerotia (grains, granules). The fungus has caused occasional cases of otomycosis, keratitis, endophthalmitis, meningitis, septicemia, and disseminated infection. It is also a common cause of fungal pneumonia in near-drowning, and associated with high mortality.519",

The special stains, however, mask the natural brown color of the fungi, which is easily detected in H&E-stained sections.
