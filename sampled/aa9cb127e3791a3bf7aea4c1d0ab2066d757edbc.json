            "text": "Telomeres are specialized DNA-protein complexes that cap the ends of linear chromosomes and protect them from degradation and end to end fusions. Due to the ''end replication problem,'' telomeres undergo progressive shortening with each cell division. Shortening to a critical length triggers cell growth arrest and cellular senescence pathways, thereby acting as a means for regulating cellular lifespan. The enzyme telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex that adds nucleotides to the 3\u0408 end of telomeres, thus maintaining telomere length and bypassing cellular senescence. Telomerase activity is absent from most adult somatic cells, with expression limited to activated lymphocytes, germ cells and stem cells. In contrast, up to 90% of cancers possess telomerase activity, suggesting that telomerase activity within cells represents the acquisition of an immortal phenotype. Telomerase is composed of an RNA component, TR, a reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit, TERT, and associated proteins. Whilst TR is present in some somatic cells, the finding that TERT is only present in those cells possessing telomerase activity and that telomerase activity can be induced in telomerase-negative cells through the addition of TERT alone suggests that telomerase activity is regulated primarily through regulation of the TERT catalytic subunit. Our group has recently sequenced and characterized the canine TERT gene and identified approximately 5Kb of the upstream regulatory region. The purpose of this study was to sequence the promoter of the canine TERT gene and to identify the core region of the promoter essential for activity.",

            "text": "PCR amplification and cloning of selected regions of the canine TERT promoter followed by luciferase assays revealed that core promoter activity is contained within a region extending approximately 300bp upstream of the ATG codon. Transient transfections in telomerase-positive canine cell lines and telomerase negative fibroblasts showed that the promoter is only active in telomerase positive cell lines. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the 5\u0408 regulatory region is GC-rich and contains no TATA or CAAT box, similar to the human TERT promoter. Motif searches revealed the presence of multiple transcription factor binding sites common to both the human and canine TERT promoters, including a single E-box, Sp1, AP1, MZF-2 and ER/Sp1 binding sites. These findings suggest that the canine TERT gene shares similar transcriptional control to the human TERT gene. Identifying the core promoter necessary for activity will enable the development of telomerase-targeted therapies in canine cancer patients similar to those investigated in human patients. ACVIM Abstracts were tapered from heparin based on improvement in anemia and resolving inflammatory leukogram, and one dog died prior to a dose adjustment. The highest heparin dose any dog received was 375 IU/kg SQ every six hours. The highest measured plasma anti-Xa activity was 1.1 U/mL. No complications due to hemorrhage occurred. Necropsies were performed in three of four dogs that died. Thrombi were identified in two of the dogs. One dog had an iliac thrombus and one had micro thrombi noted in alveolar capillaries. The last measured anti-Xa activity in these dogs was 0.33 U/mL (16-hr) and 0.4 U/mL (40-hr) respectively. Thirteen of the 15 dogs survived to be discharged and 11 dogs were alive one month after diagnosis. Patient survival to discharge (P \u03ed 0.37) and one-month survival (P \u03ed 0.43) were not statistically significantly different from control data.

Thromboembolic (TE) events are an important cause of mortality in dogs with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA). Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is often given empirically to canine IMHA patients, However, few clinical studies have evaluated the efficacy of UFH for preventing thrombosis in this population. The objectives of this study were to develop a dosage regimen of UFH for canine IMHA based on attainment of a predetermined in vitro anticoagulant activity, and to determine whether this protocol improved patient survival. IMHA dogs were prospectively enrolled in the study and their survival was compared to historical controls. A target heparin Factor Xa inhibitory range of 0.35-0.7 anti-Xa U/mL was chosen based on human heparin efficacy studies. An initial UFH dose of 300 IU/kg SQ every six hours was administered. Fifteen dogs with primary IMHA were enrolled in the study. Plasma anti-Xa activity was measured at 0, 4, 16, 28, and 40 hours after initiation of UFH therapy. No dogs had activity in the target range (TR) at 4-hour, five dogs attained TR values at 16 and 28 hours, and four dogs had TR values at 40-hours. One dog died prior to the 40hour sample. The dose of UFH was increased by 17%-25% in five dogs having values below TR at the 40-hour sample. Two of the five dogs subsequently attained TR values after the increase in their heparin dose. The mean plasma anti-Xa activity was 0.2 U/mL at the 40-hour sample (n \u03ed 14). The mean UFH dose was 318 IU/kg at the time dogs (n \u03ed 8) attained TR values.

These data may be applicable to dogs undergoing thoracotomy for thoracic disease and should be further investigated. The relation between expiratory flow rate and expired volume during forced expiration (forced expiratory flow-volume curve) provides important insight into the severity and nature of lung diseases and especially of small airway obstruction and is the basic test of lung function in humans. More than 20 years ago a thoracic compression technique was developed for use in human infants who cannot actively cooperate with breathing tests, in which forced expiratory flow is produced by the brief application of pressure from a thoracic compression jacket. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether this technique could be applied to measure lung function non-invasively in small animals.",

Vaseline was smeared around the mouth and nose and silicone putty was used to reduce the dead space and seal the mask to the face of the cat so that the animal breathed naturally through its nose with the mouth closed. Thoracic compression was applied from an inflatable bag extending over the sternal surface of the chest and abdomen held in place by a non-expandable canvas jacket totally surrounding the trunk of the animal. The bag was suddenly inflated at end-inspiration by a computer initiated pulse sent to a solenoid controlling the connection of the inflation bag to either room air or an appropriately pressurized chamber. From the signals recorded from the pneumotachygraph we determined the maximum forced expiratory flow at a lung volume equivalent to the resting lung volume (end-expiration), which is termed V'maxFRC. The test was repeated with different compression pressures and the highest value obtained from a technically satisfactory flow-volume loop was taken as the result in conformity with human infant practice.",

Measurements of compliance (a measure of stiffness) and resistance are basic tests used to evaluate lung function in humans and to some extent in veterinary practice, although in animals the measurements have almost always been performed in anesthetized and intubated subjects. In lightly sedated human infants the compliance of the total respiratory system (Crs) can be determined by measuring the airway pressure during brief occlusions which inducing the Hering-Breuer inflation reflex and relax the expiratory muscles at different expired volumes. Furthermore, a plot of expired volume against flow during the relaxed expiration after release of the occlusion yields the time constant (rs) of the respiratory system from which total respiratory resistance (Rrs) can be calculated since rs \u03ed Crs \u03eb Rrs.

The slope of the plot of lung volume above resting lung volume against the airway pressure during the occlusion for all the breaths yielded Crs. The lungs were briefly inflated manually above normal end inspiration to induce relaxation for each of 3-4 breaths.

In addition, we believe that trephination allows better debridement of fungus within the sinus, as well as direct placement of drug delivery catheters into the frontal sinus for topical therapy. Therefore, sinus trephination and sinuscopy should be considered as a diagnostic and therapeutic method in dogs suspected of aspergillosis. Diagnosis of nasal aspergillosis relies on a combination of imaging abnormalities (turbinate destruction, hyperostotic bone lesions, frontal sinus involvement), detection of fungal plaques on rhinoscopy, and histologic evidence of fungal hyphae. Dogs are often diagnosed late in the disease process due to the need for invasive and expensive tests. Aspergillus serology and nasal fungal culture have not been considered useful in the diagnosis of nasal aspergillosis due to the presumption that they have low sensitivity and specificity, however, no recent studies have investigated the utility of these tests.

In a randomized, blinded, cross-over study eight Arabian or mixed breed horses (age range: 9 to 17 years, average 11.8 years; weight average: 441.5 kg, range: 383-529 kg) participated in two 50 mile endurance races. Four horses received 0.22 g/kg NaCl and 0.074 g/kg KCl (high dose, approximately equal to losses in 30 L sweat, HD) and the other four received 0.07 g/kg NaCl and 0.02 g/kg KCl (low dose, approximately equal to losses in 10 L sweat, LD) orally before and at 25 miles of the first ride. Horses received the alternate treatment in the second ride 28 days later. Rides were run over the same course. Body weight, blood for measurement of serum electrolyte concentrations, and estimated water intake were measured, collected or recorded with an interview form within 30 minutes of the start, 25 miles into the ride, within 30 min of finishing and 2 hours after finishing. Data were analyzed by 2-way repeated measures analysis of variance (P \u0545 0.05, mean \u03ee SEM). There was a significant effect of treatment on serum sodium and chloride concentrations and water intake, but not body weight. Serum sodium concentrations were significantly higher at 50 miles in horses receiving HD (149 \u03ee 1 vs 143 \u03ee 1 mEq/l), but were not different before or during recovery. Serum chloride concentrations were significantly higher at 50 miles in horses receiving HD (110 \u03ee 1 vs 102 \u03ee 1 mEq/l), but were not different before or during recovery. Serum potassium concentration was not affected by treatment (P \u03ed 0.053) and was 2.9 \u03ee 0.1 vs 2.4 \u03ee 0.1 mEq/l for HD and LD at the end of the ride. Water intake was significantly greater at 25 and 50 miles in horses receiving HD (47.3 \u03ee 2.8 l vs 24.6 \u03ee 2.8 l at 25 miles, and 36 \u03ee 2.8 vs 30.3 \u03ee 2.8 l at 50 miles). Overall water consumption was different between treatments (100.3 \u03ee 9.5 vs 75 \u03ee 8.5 for HD and LD, respectively). There was no difference in percentage of body weight lost during the race by HD or LD treated horses (p \u03ed 0.36, \u03ea3.8 \u03ee 0.3 vs \u03ea4.0 \u03ee 0.3% immediately after racing). Time to complete the ride was not significantly different between treatments (534 \u03ee 24 and 540 \u03ee 22 min, HD and LD, respectively). HD caused hypernatremia, hyperchloremia and increased water intake, but did not attenuate body weight losses or improve performance compared to a lower dose of electrolyte supplement. Based on the results of this study, supplementation of horses during endurance racing with dosages of NaCl of 0.22 g/kg is not warranted, as this dose may induce abnormalities in electrolyte concentrations without providing any apparent competitive advantage. With pulmonary disease second only to lameness as a cause of decreased performance in saddle horses, accurate measurements of respiratory function are essential for thorough evaluation of the underachieving equine athlete. Forced oscillatory mechanics (FOM) is a non-invasive, sensitive, and user-friendly technique to measure baseline respiratory system resistance (R RS ), and can easily be coupled with nebulized histamine bronchoprovocation to evaluate airway hyperreactivity in the horse with suspected Inflammatory Airway Disease. Although the testing is non-invasive, sedation is essential to ensure the compliance of most patients who undergo evaluation. In vitro data indicates that \u2423-2 agonists have a bronchodilatory effect on pre-constricted airways. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of intravenous detomidine on R RS at baseline and after histamine bronchoprovocation in horses without Recurrent Airway Obstruction (RAO).",

Several recent clinical studies demonstrate that the administration of low dosages of theophylline have a steroidsparing effect in human asthmatics.

The results of the diagnostic test (model) when combined with the clinician's initial assessment can provide clients with an adjusted probability of survival. Medical records of foals from one university and two private equine hospitals for years [2000] [2001] [2002] were reviewed, and 1,026 of these included a foal \u05457 days of age and had an outcome (died, euthanized or discharged alive) recorded. Historical, physical and laboratory information were extracted from each foal's medical record along with historical information for the mare. Foals that were euthanized were excluded from the study leaving 910/1,026 (89%) for further analyses. Univariate analyses were used to identify those characteristics of the mare and foal that were associated with foal survival. Using the p-value associated with the univariate comparison, combined with the biological plausibility of the association of the characteristic with outcome, individual characteristics were entered into a logistic regression model in a forward stepwise manner. The final logistic regression equation included six variables; presence or absence of a suckle reflex, ability to stand, temperature, white blood count, serum creatinine and anion gap. The ability of the model to predict survival in hospitalized foals \u05457 days was validated on a group of foals (n \u03ed 145) admitted to five equine hospitals, other than those used to generate the original model, during 2004. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the retrospective model to predict survival in foals were 90%, 74%, 95% and 60%, respectively. Likelihood ratios were also generated from this model. When applied to foals in 2004 the sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values to predict survival were 87%, 54%, 91% and 45%, respectively. A positive predictive value of 91% in the population of foals on which the model was validated indicates that the model is useful to predict survival; however, a 45% probability of non-survival, given a negative test result, implies that the owner be should be cautioned as to a substantial risk of non-survival. This model can be used to assist clinicians in providing quantitative information on the probability of foal survival to the client prior to referring the foal to a hospital or within a short time after hospitalization.",

Many of the foals had significant additional medical problems, including gastrointestinal disease (4/6), other musculoskeletal abnormalities (4/6), hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (2/6), sepsis (2/6), renal disease (1/6), and congenital cardiac malformation (1/6). Treatment specific for gastrocnemius rupture was attempted in 3/6 foals, and consisted of limb stabilization using splints, bandaging, and exercise restriction. In one foal, splinting was associated with significant additional morbidity. Four foals were euthanized, two due solely to the gastrocnemius rupture, and two due to the combination of this and other significant problems. For the two survivors, treatment of the gastrocnemius rupture necessitated protracted hospitalization beyond that predicted for the other problems, resulting in considerable additional cost to the owner. Both of these foals were broken to ride. One of these foals has a mechanical lameness associated with damage from the splint (four years later) and is kept at pasture. The other foal raced twice as a 2-yearold, but has not raced as a 3-year-old.",

            "text": "The outcome of neonates with a ruptured gastrocnemius is often complicated by the presence of other significant abnormalities. Mild tears may be an incidental finding and may heal well without intervention. Moderate to severe tears require specific therapy, including placement of appropriate splints and exercise restriction. In our experience the best method of splinting for this problem is a custom fit hemicircumferential fiberglass splint placed on the dorsal aspect of the leg. Pressure sores can develop rapidly and any splinting regimen requires diligent adjustment and careful monitoring of the underlying soft tissues. The prognosis for elite athletic use in surviving foals appears poor. Interest in lactate concentrations ([LAC] ) as a predictor of survival or indicator of response to therapy in equine neonates admitted to Equine Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) has increased with the availability of blood gas (BG) analyzers that report lactate concentrations. [LAC] increases under anaerobic conditions, with sepsis associated hypermetabolism, cytokine induced pyruvate dehydrogenase blockade, inflammatory cell metabolism and sepsis induced epinephrine surge. Lactate also serves as a carbohydrate substrate and energy source. Lactate clearance occurs primarily in the liver and muscle. The sensitivity and specificity of a single lactate measurement as a predictor of outcome is debated, while evidence is accumulating that persistence (\u03fe24hr) of increased [LAC] is associated with increased mortality rates in foals and humans. Conversely, early lactate clearance is associated with improved outcome. We hypothesized that failure to resolve increased [LAC] within 48 hours of admission to a NICU is associated with poor outcome. [LAC] was measured at admission using a commercial BG analyzer in \u03f3200 neonatal foals admitted to the Graham French Neonatal Intensive Care Unit between 2002 and 2004. [LAC] was also determined in foals surviving at 24 and 48 post admission that had additional BG. Foals were categorized by condition as either alive (A), died (D) or euthanized (E) for each sampling period. Ninety-seven surviving foals did not have additional BG at 24 hours and an additional 36 survivors did not have BG at 48 hours, all due to good clinical progress not requiring further BG determinations. Foals euthanized for purely economic reasons or due to poor perceived prognosis on the part of the clinician or owner have been included in this data set.",

In critically ill horses, low serum ionized calcium (Ca 2\u03e9 ) and ionized magnesium (Mg 2\u03e9 ) concentrations are frequent findings. High serum Ca 2\u03e9 is common in horses with chronic renal failure, hypercalcemia of malignancy, hyperparathyroidism, and vitamin D intoxication. There is evidence that the renal reabsorption of Ca 2\u03e9 is also regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH)-independent mechanisms, primarily by the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) that affects the transepithelial transport of Ca 2\u03e9 and Mg 2\u03e9 . Because extracellular Ca 2\u03e9 can affect other electrolytes, the goals of this study were to evaluate the effects of experimental hypercalcemia on the serum concentrations of electrolytes and their urinary excretion in healthy horses. By the direct effects of Ca 2\u03e9 on CaR, we speculated that hypercalcemia will result in hypomagnesemia and increase the urinary excretion of electrolytes.",

Diarrheic and non-diarrheic calves less than one month of age from the same farms were matched for a blinded paired casecontrol study. A second objective was to explore genetic similarities between bovine and pathogenic human and other animal isolates. 102 dairy farms in Southern Ontario were visited during May-September of 2004 to obtain single fecal samples from calves between four and 28 days of age. Surveys were used to identify basic farm management practices. Samples were code-blinded and processed for presence of toxins A/B using a commercial immunoassay, and cultured using a C. difficile-selective protocol. PCR-based ribotyping analyses were conducted on the C. difficile isolates. The presence of the toxin genes was also investigated.

Statistical analysis of this paired data revealed a significant association (p \u03ed 0.004) between the presence of fecal toxins and diarrhea (OR \u03ed 2.38; 95% CI \u03ed 1. 30-4.48) .

At least five different ribotype patterns were present. Two of these patterns, identified in calves from at least six different farms, were indistinguishable from common human and canine isolates. The results of this study suggest that C. difficile might be an important pathogen in neonatal calf diarrhea and that a potential risk of zoonotic transmission might exist. Cytokines are soluble polypeptides and are produced by cells of both the innate and adaptive arms of the host immune system following antigenic stimulation. They regulate and mediate immune and inflammatory reactions and their role as effectors of the immune system is widely described. In this study we evaluated the effects of lactoferrin (LF) on cytokine and prostanoid expression by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein, a characteristic that bears specific implications to lymphocyte proliferation and subsequent effector mechanisms following antigenic exposure. It also has a high affinity for LPS. High concentrations of LF exist in colostrum and in the secondary granules of neutrophils. Lactoferrin plays protective and regulatory roles in mammary gland health and superoxide production in neonatal bovine neutrophils. We hypothesized that LF inhibits cytokine expression by bovine PBMC through prevention of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding. Since lymphocyte proliferation is iron dependent we evaluated cytokine and mediator expression in the presence and absence of supplemental iron (Fe).",

It is believed that the mechanism here is one of iron sequestration as well as inhibition of LPS-cellular interaction. Differences were noted between the extracted and non-extracted LF treatments. Cytokine expression in the latter may be related to LF reagent contamination with LPS. Corticosteroids are commonly administered to dairy cows with ketosis to lower milk production and enhance gluconeogenesis, but their use may be complicated by the development of hypokalemia and profound weakness.

Third compartment (stomach) ulcers are a common cause of sickness and death in camelids of all ages. Although the exact pathogenesis of third compartment ulceration in camelids is not completely understood, stress appears to be the most common predisposing factor. Unfortunately, many of the accepted medications for treatment of gastroduodenal ulcers in other species have proven ineffective in llamas, alpacas, and camels. Intravenous administration of omeprazole has been shown to significantly increase third compartment pH in llamas, but is impractical for routine use by owners. Following IV administration, plasma concentrations between 25 and 60 ng/ml are associated with suppression of gastric acid production. Omeprazole is an acid labile drug and oral absorption is often poor due to degradation of the drug in the acid environment of the stomach. The purpose of this study was to examine the systemic absorption and pharmacokinetics of a commercially available oral omeprazole paste (Gastrogard, Merial, Duluth GA) in llamas.",

In cattle, pericardial disease is most frequently caused by traumatic penetration of the pericardium by a foreign body originating from the gastrointestinal tract and prognosis is poor. Clinical signs include anorexia, pyrexia, reluctance to move, decreased milk production and signs of congestive heart failure. Cytological analysis of the pericardial fluid reveals elevated white blood cell counts and protein concentrations. This study describes a further cause of pericardial effusion in five Friesian cows that we have termed idiopathic hemorrhagic pericardial effusion. The five cows from four different farms presented with a history of decreased milk yield (4/5 cows; one cow was dry) and/or fever (3/5) between Feb 2003 to Nov 2004 . All cows had tachycardia (103 \u03ee 13 bpm), tachypnea (42 \u03ee 8 bpm), muffled heart sounds, signs of congestive heart failure and diarrhea. CBCs were normal and serum chemistry revealed decreased albumin and Mg and increased CK, GGT and SDH. Thoracic radiographs of three cows revealed no evidence of traumatic reticulopericarditis. Ultrasound examination of all cows revealed marked fibrinous pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, pleural effusion, ascites, hepatomegaly and edema of the intestinal wall. Pericardiocentesis resulted in large quantities of red fluid (up to 30 liters) with a PCV of 12.6 \u03ee 5.2% and TPP of 3.3 \u03ee 1.2g/dl and no cytological evidence of infection or neoplasia. Bacterial and mycoplasma cultures and virus isolation were negative from pericardial fluid. Coagulation profiles and toxicological analysis for ionophores, mycotoxins, anticoagulants and selenium showed no abnormalities. Two cows were negative for BVD, and 2/4 cows tested for BLV were positive. No cows showed lymph node enlargement consistent with lymphosarcoma. Transtracheal wash in two cows showed intracellular cocci but cultures were negative. Four cows were treated with pericardiocentesis, pericardial lavage, antibiotics and NSAIDs and clinical signs resolved. Two cows died six months and one year later from unknown causes and two cows are still alive (3m and 2 yr after discharge). One cow was euthanatized at presentation after a diagnosis was established. Necropsy revealed myocardial necrosis, epicarditis and pericarditis and Streptococcus bovis was isolated from lung, spleen, and myocardium from the euthanatized cow. No growth was obtained from her pericardial fluid.",

In dogs and humans hemorrhagic pericardial effusion can be ''idiopathic'' or can result from neoplasia, trauma, bleeding disorders or vascular abnormalities. The cause of this syndrome in the cow is currently unknown. But, more importantly, it should be differentiated from traumatic reticulopericarditis due to the potential for a successful outcome with treatment. Manipulation of photoperiod during the dry period impacts milk production and immune function in dairy cows. Cows housed under short-day (SD; 8 h light, 16 h dark) conditions produce more milk in the subsequent lactation and have enhanced cellular immune responses at calving compared to cows housed under long-day (LD; 16 h light, 8 h dark) conditions. One aim of the study reported here was to determine the effect of photoperiod during the dry period on the volume and IgG concentration of colostrum harvested at the first milking after calving. A second aim was to determine if serum protein concentrations at dry-off or calving are associated with colostral IgG concentration or IgG mass.",

Colostral [IgG] decreased by 0.11 g/dl per hour and 0.14 g/dl per kg colostrum. The interaction between colostral weight and the interval between calving and milking was more important than either factor alone. If calves are routinely fed 4 L of colostrum after birth, results of this study indicate that a 12-h delay in milking after calving would result in 53g less IgG than if colostrum were harvested immediately. The difference in [IgG] between 4 L of colostrum harvested from a cow producing 5 L and one producing 15 L would be 60 g. These findings demonstrate that cows should be milked as soon as possible after calving. Failure to do so will increase the risk of failure of passive transfer in calves. Staphylococcus aureus mastitis continues to be a major problem for the dairy industry of the United States. Cows with chronic S. aureus intramammary infections are often culled from the herd. However, many producers are either unwilling to cull these cattle or have so many animals infected that it becomes impossible or uneconomical to cull them all. Therefore, it is important to develop treatment methods to eliminate chronic intramammary S. aureus infections. Both vaccination and antibiotic therapy have been used with limited success in an attempt to eliminate these infections. However, it is possible that the use of a combined therapeutic approach using both vaccination and intramammary antibiotic treatment would be successful.",

The abrasive walking surface resulting in a faster rate of sole horn wear as compared to growth could be responsible for the significantly higher incidence of thin soles between 60 and 350DIM. The higher incidence of thin soles in all three lactation groups during the summer could be associated with a higher claw horn moisture content resulting in softer and more flexible horn with a more rapid rate of wear. The seasonality observed also suggests that heat stress contributed to lameness either through alterations in cow comfort (that is, more standing and less lying time), influences on rates of laminitis (by virtue of increased rates of rumen acidosis) or both. Distance walked and nutritional influences and were not studied but may have also contributed to thin soles as a consequence of increased sole wear rumen acidosis and laminitis. Approximately 44% of US dairy cattle and 10% of US beef cattle are infected with bovine leukosis virus. Up to 5% of infected animals will die due to lymphosarcoma. Clinical manifestations of tumor formation depend on the affected organ systems. Spinal tumors have been associated with weakness and ataxia, especially in the rear limbs. Downer cows also are commonly associated with this manifestation of lymphosarcoma.

Holter recordings are analyzed by a wide variety of commercial laboratories, academic institutions, and individual veterinary practices.

Percent change ranged from 0% to as high as 100%. By definition, cases in which a percent change of 100% was identified occurred only when one recording identified zero VPCs. In these cases, the highest recording was limited to 2 VPCs. None of the differences between laboratories exceeded what was considered clinically significant or within the limits of spontaneous biologic variability. The discrepancy in the grade of arrhythmia between labs was minimal, and never exceeded more than 1 grade, and was usually associated with a grade 0 vs grade 1. These results suggest that evaluation of Holter recordings by trained technicians in an academic institution and those performed by commercial laboratories are comparable. Therefore, inhouse Holter analyses performed by academic institutions are a reasonable alternative to analysis by commercial facilities.

In a pilot study to evaluate atrial repolarization we sought to determine the effective refractory period (ERP) of the atria. These attempts failed because of the unexpected induction of atrial fibrillation (AF). The vulnerability of the GSD to the induction of AF in our specific protocol afforded us the opportunity to determine the spatio-temporal organization of AF. In other species such as the sheep, spatio-temporal organization is higher in the left atrium (LA) than the right atrium (RA). Spectral entropy (SEn) can be used to quantify temporal disorganization. We studied induced AF in GSD to determine if SEn was higher in the RA than the LA.

Pericardial effusion (PE) in dogs can be caused by several etiologies including cardiac tumors such as hemangiosarcoma (HSA) and chemodectoma (CH), pericardial mesothelioma (M), and idiopathic pericarditis (IP). The approach to treatment and prognosis of dogs with PE is dependent on accurate identification of the underlying etiology of the effusion. Biopsy specimens obtained during thoracotomy, can provide a definitive diagnosis, but are expensive to obtain and result in substantial patient morbidity. In contrast, pericardiocentesis and cytology of pericardial fluid are readily performed, but are limited by current cytological techniques that do not reliably differentiate between neoplastic and nonneoplastic causes of PE.",

We performed a preliminary study to evaluate immunohistochemical staining of common neoplasms and IP. Using banked tissue samples, we characterized the staining patterns of cardiac HSA, CH, and M and compared these patterns with normal and reactive pericardial tissue samples using a panel of immunohistochemical stains. Specifically, we evaluated the staining patterns for antibodies specific to CD31, desmin, cytokeratin, vimentin, synaptophysin, chromogranin and endothelin. Our results indicate that common cardiac tumors and pericardial diseases demonstrate differential staining characteristics. The antibody for CD31 was specific for HSA. Synaptophysin and chromogranin demonstrated high specificity but only moderate sensitivity for CH. Vimentin was occasionally useful in differentiating HSA from CH. Cytokeratin was specific for mesothelial tissue, and desmin occasionally differentiated reactive mesothelium from M. This study suggests that immunohistochemical stains may be useful in determining etiology of PE. Further work is required to determine the ability to distinguish M from IP as well as the clinical value of these stains employed during cytological (vs. histological) examination of pericardial effusates.

Echo may offer insight into diastolic dysfunction associated with increasing age and CVD. In a model of mitral regurgitation (MR) induced by chordal rupture, we have demonstrated that MR is associated with infiltration of LV by mast cells, increased activity of MMPs, decreased TIMPs, and increase chymase activity, which results in a rapid loss of extracellular matrix collagen, increased LV compliance, increased myocyte integren adhesion, myofiber slippage, myocyte hypertrophy, and decreased total LV contraction. In experimental and spontaneous MR in dogs, the LV collagen loss allows LV dilation and dysfunctional contractility. The myocardial remodeling in volume overload is distinctly different than that observed in pressure overloads and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Blockage of ACE activity and Ang II receptors failed to attenuate the collagen loss and myocardial dilation and hypertrophy.",

            "text": "Caudal occipital malformation syndrome (COMS) is the canine analog of human Chiari I malformation. As with human Chiari I malformation, dogs with COMS can display a variety of clinical signs; these include cerebellovestibular dysfunction, myelopathy (usually cervical), and seizure activity. Foramen magnum decompression (FMD) is usually performed for humans with symptomatic Chiari I malformation; results are favorable, with better outcomes being attained with early surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to describe clinical results of a FMD procedure in 16 dogs with COMS. Cases were restricted to dogs with MRI evidence of COMS and no other neurologic disorders. All dogs underwent a FMD procedure that included either meningeal resection or marsupialization to the surrounding musculature. Fifteen of 16 dogs were receiving medical therapy for COMS prior to surgery. Breeds included Cavalier King Charles spaniel (9), Maltese (2), Yorkshire terrier (1), and Pomeranian (1). Mean age was 3.86 yrs. Neuroanatomic localization included multifocal CNS dysfunction (7), isolated cervical myelopathy (6) , isolated cerebellovestibular dysfunction (2), and L4-S1 myelopathy (1). All dogs with multifocal CNS signs had evidence of both cerebellovestibular and cervical spinal cord disease. Other specific abnormalities included cervical hyperesthesia (13), diminished menace responses (7), positional strabismus (7), excessive scratching behavior (6), torticollis (3), abnormal mentation (2), ''fly-biting'' episodes (2), head tilt (2), chewing at the paws (2), excessive licking (1), eye rubbing (1), and generalized seizures (1). Mean duration of clinical signs prior to surgery was 32.19 wks (1-208 wks). Syringohydromyelia was evident on MRI in 15/16 dogs (93.75%). No intraoperative complications occurred. Postoperative complications occurred in two dogs. One dog had worsening of a head tilt, which resolved in three weeks. Another dog experienced neck pain after the initial FMD (resolved in four wks), and was nonambulatory tetraparetic following repeat FMD. Resolution of clinical signs occurred in seven dogs (43.75%), and improvement occurred in six dogs (37.5%), for an overall positive result of 81.25%. One dog did not improve, one dog worsened and was euthanized, and one dog died nine days following repeat FMD (the tetraparetic dog), due to a suspected ruptured viscus. Repeat surgery was performed in 4 dogs (25%), due to constrictive scar tissue formation at the original FMD site. Drugs were discontinued in all dogs with resolution of signs. Four of the 6 improved dogs remained on medical therapy. Five of 6 dogs with scratching behavior prior to FMD continued to do so postoperatively; two of these five dogs required medical therapy to control scratching. Mean duration of signs prior to FMD was 3.8 wks for the resolved group, and 78.08 wks for the improved group. Results suggest that FMD is often an effective treatment for COMS, especially if performed early in the disease course. The pathogenic factors responsible for the progression of signs in the caudal occipital malformation syndrome (COMS) are not well understood. The development of secondary syringohydromyelia appears to coincide with the onset of clinical neurologic deficits but the CSF flow abnormalities that lead to syrinx formation have not been described in dogs with COMS. The purpose of this study was to characterize and compare CSF flow dynamics in normal dogs and in dogs with COMS using cine phase contrast MRI. Dogs with COMS were grouped according to severity of syrinx formation. Cine flow MRI imaging was performed in the mid-sagittal and axial planes using a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner (GE Medical Systems) equipped with a retrospectively graded phase contrast sequence to measure CSF flow velocity throughout the cardiac cycle. Velocity encoding was cranial to caudal. Sixteen image frames per cardiac cycle were evaluated for cranial and caudal flow velocities using a GE Medical Systems software program. Regions of interest were drawn manually to encompass spe-cific areas of subarachnoid space, syrinx cavities, and cord parenchyma. CSF velocities, ratios of diastolic to systolic flow times, and parenchymal movements were measured.",

In severely affected dogs, reversal of CSF flow was observed during diastole. Caudal movement of the caudal brainstem and cerebellum was significantly greater and more prolonged in dogs with COMS. CSF flow in the ventral subarachnoid compartment was minimally affected. Increased flow gradients were found between more cranial and caudal dorsal subarachnoid spaces in dogs with COMS. In the areas of syrinx formation, flow of CSF in the dorsal subarachnoid space was less impaired but exhibited a longer duration of caudal versus cranial flow.

The purpose of this study was to compare the resolution of fast spin-echo (FSE) and conventional spin-echo (CSE) MRI sequences with maximized resolution parameters and a limited acquisition time to determine if the benefits afforded by FSE are significant enough to warrant replacement of CSE for imaging the canine brain. T2-weighted FSE and CSE are two MRI sequences used to define pathologic brain lesions. Given the same imaging parameters the resolution of FSE images is inherently inferior to that of CSE. However, FSE images can be acquired in a shorter amount of time allowing resolution parameters to be increased. The ability to obtain higher quality images in less time has lead to the replacement of CSE by FSE in human medicine.",

This study supports the replacement of T2-weighted CSE with FSE when imaging the canine brain due to higher resolution capabilities in a shorter acquisition time. Cervical stenotic myelopathy (CSM) is a complex disorder of the cervical spine in large and giant breed dogs. Spinal cord compression occurs as a result of proliferation of the dorsal portion of the annulus fibrosus, the dorsal longitudinal ligament (large breed dogs), the articular facets and the ligamentum flavum (giant breed dogs). It is theorized that underlying instability between congenitally malformed vertebrae causes proliferation of these aforementioned structures, ultimately compressing the spinal cord. We hypothesized that progression of signs in giant breed dogs is due to both repeated concussive injury to the spinal cord and progressive spinal cord compression. We proposed that fusion of the cervical vertebrae would address underlying instability, thus preventing concussive spinal cord injury, and causing regression of excess bone and soft tissues alleviating compression of the spinal cord. The goals of this study were to determine whether cervical fusion of giant breed dogs with CSM results in regression of excess bone and an improvement in neurological status.",

The skin was marked with indelible ink corresponding to the laser localizer at this position (transverse plane). Several barium marks were applied at 90\u040a along the ink line. We then scanned the target area with four to five slices of 3mm thickness each. These images displayed the lesion in the brain as well as the barium lines over the skin. The barium line best aligned with the intracranial lesion was chosen as a reference point for the skin incision and the craniotomy. After a sterile scrub a small skin incision was made. The underlying muscles were incised and dissected from the calvarium, and a hand drill was used to make a small hole in the calvarium. The apparatus holding the biopsy needle was then mounted over the patient's head, the table was re-positioned at the same point of the previous chosen target area, and the needle was aligned to the lesion by using serial transverse CT scans. A 2.1mm diameter Sedan Side-Cutting Biopsy Needle was used. The distance from the tip of the needle to the center of the lesion was measured by using CT, and the needle was then advanced. A gentle negative pressure was created with a 10ml syringe applied to the proximal end of the inner needle to introduce the sample to be collected into the needle window, and the inner biopsy needle was rotated 180\u040a to cut the collected sample. The inner needle was then removed (the external needle was left in place), and the sample were extracted by flushing the needle with air and with sterile saline. Three samples were collected and submitted for cytologic and histologic examination, bacterial and fungal culture and antimicrobial sensitivity testing.",

Eight adult (four male and four female) dogs were studied following single (6.9 mg/kg) and multiple dosing (10.25) using a randomized crossover design. Blood samples were collected intermittently for 48 hours and then dogs were dosed orally (10 mg/kg) twice daily for eight weeks. Blood samples were collected weekly and at discontinuation of the drug. Additionally, urine was collected to determine 24 hour urine ZNS clearance following IV administration. Safety was based on clinical pathology, thyroid and urine testing during both studies. ZNS was measured using HPLC validated in canine serum, plasma, erythrocytes (RBC) and whole blood. Data were subjected to standard non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis (WinNonLin) and compared using one-way ANOVA. Safety parameters at study beginning and end were compared using a Student t-test. ZNS (mcg/ml) oral maximum concentration (Cmax) was greatest in RBC (28.73g/ml) and least (14.36g/ml) in plasma. The unbound portion was 60 \u03ee 13%. Volume of distribution also was greater (1L/kg) in plasma and least (0.4 L/kg) in RBC. Clearance was 7.55 ml/hr/kg from plasma and 5.06 ml/hr/kg from RBC. Elimination half-life in plasma was 16.4 hr in serum and 57.4 hr in RBC. Bioavailability was 126.8% for RBC and 189.6% for plasma. Following multiple dosing, at steady-state (by 7 days), Cmax averaged 65.8g/ml with fluctuations of 17.2% between Cmax and Cmin dosings. Concentrations did not differ among blood compartments at the end of multiple dosing. Although differences did occur across time in clinical pathology tests, all were within normal limits at study end except for T4 (at 8 weeks 1 \u03ee 0.4 ng/dl total; 1 \u03ee 0.3 ng/dl free and 0.18 ng/dl TSH). Urine citrate and calcium were greater at study end but not when corrected by urine creatine. In conclusion, ZNS dosed at 10 mg/kg twice daily for dogs should maintain therapeutic levels (10 to 70g/ml) recommended in human epileptic patients. Therapeutic monitoring should be based on serum or plasma; the impact on potential stone formation should be further assessed. Zonisamide (ZNS) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) recently approved for human use in the United States. The drug has been used in Japan to treat humans with epilepsy since 1984, and has been utilized by veterinarians in this country for approximately 10 years. Limited clinical studies have shown the efficacy of the drug for canine epilepsy in the absence of significant adverse effects. Despite these promising results, only minimal pharmacokinetic data is available and a standardized dosage regimen has not been established. Moreover, potential drug interactions with other AEDs have not been evaluated. This may be of significance when phenobarbital (PB) and ZNS are used in combination, as PB is known to induce hepatic enzymes, one of which is responsible for the metabolism of ZNS. The objectives of this study were to determine the pharmacokinetics of ZNS before and after chronic administration of PB and to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of ZNS when used to treat naturally occurring epilepsy in dogs.",

The mean dose was 5.6 mg/kg (range, 2.5 to 8) q 12 h and the mean trough concentration was 14.4g/ml (range, 5.3 to 27.9). No adverse effects were attributable to ZNS. Serum levels were relatively proportional to dose (r \u03ed 0.78, p \u03fd 0.01). The minimum dose required to attain a reported minimum therapeutic concentration (12.5 g/ml) was 6 mg/kg q 12 h.

The purpose of this study was to refine the mapping of the locus for canine multiple system degeneration (CMSD). CMSD is a fatal, hereditary movement disorder of Kerry Blue Terriers and Chinese Crested dogs characterized by degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells, substantia nigra, and caudate nucleus (deLahunta & Averill 1976; O'Brien et al 1996) . Breeders refer to the condition as PNA (progressive neuronal abiotrophy). The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive necessitating breeding trials to identify carriers. We previously used a 51-dog three-generation family of both breeds and their crosses, including 18 dogs diagnosed with CMSD based on characteristic signs and confirmed at necropsy, to demonstrate that the disease is allelic in the two breeds and to map CMSD to a 30 Mb region of canine chromosome 1.

Trilostane is thought to be a competitive inhibitor of the 3\u2424-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u2424-HSD) enzyme system. In research animals it has been shown to inhibit the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone and of 17\u2423-OH-pregnenolone to 17\u2423-OH-progesterone. This leads to changes in steroid precursor and steroid concentrations, especially an increase in pregnenolone and 17\u2423-OHpregnenolone and a decrease of progesterone, 17\u2423-OH-progesterone, cortisol, and aldosterone. In dogs it is known so far, that trilostane therapy leads to a decrease of cortisol and aldosterone.",

The significant increases of 17\u2423-OH-pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrostenedione confirm an inhibitory effect of the 3\u2424-HSD enzyme system. Unexpected was the failure of 17\u2423-OH-progesterone and androstenedione concentrations to decrease. This could indicate an incomplete inhibition of the 3\u2424-HSD with an additional inhibition of the 21-hydrolase or the 11-hydroxylase. However, an up-regulation of the conversion of cortisol to cortisone by 11-\u2424-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase could also lead to the same steroid precursor profile. To completely understand the activity profile of trilostane further studies on a larger group of dogs with analysis of further precursors (especially cortisone) and evaluation in cell culture are needed. In humans, urine catecholamine concentrations may be useful to diagnose pheochromo-cytoma (pheo).

Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is a labile hormone that is highly sensitive to temperature degradation. Sample handling is critical for this hormone. We recently validated in dogs an assay allowing quantitative determination of plasma ACTH precursors (pro-opiomelanocortin, POMC, and pro-ACTH) and obtained data indicating that the use of this assay may be of value in the characterization of tumor size in dogs with Cushing's disease (J Vet Int Med, 2005, 19:23-28) . These data were obtained with blood collected into pre-cooled EDTA tubes, immediately centrifuged at 4\u040aC and after immediate freezing of plasma. Thus, the question arises as whether to POMC and pro-ACTH have the same properties as ACTH and whether similar sample handling conditions are necessary to preserve canine ACTH precursors.

There was no difference between insulin types in regard to treatment response or remission rates. The results of the study suggest that Glargine in combination with a high protein, low carbohydrate diet represents a viable option for treatment of feline diabetes mellitus. Insulin glargine is a synthetic insulin analogue that is very long-acting in human patients.

Certain dog breeds such as Samoyeds and Tibetan terriers are predisposed to developing diabetes mellitus (DM), suggesting that the disease has a genetic component. The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes, coding for Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II proteins, are the major susceptibility genes for Type 1 DM in man. It has also been reported that human diabetics expressing certain HLA alleles are more likely to produce anti-insulin antibodies (AIAb) following insulin therapy. The aim of this study was to determine whether particular Dog Leukocyte Antigen (DLA) haplotypes are associated with an increased risk of canine DM and to evaluate whether development of anti-insulin antibodies in insulin-treated diabetic dogs is associated with specific DLA alleles.",

Obese cats show alterations in lipoprotein metabolism. They also have increased lipid deposits in muscle. These changes suggest that lipase activity, in particular that of LPL, is altered with obesity because modulation of tissuespecific LPL expression determines the partitioning of triglycerides between tissues. Increased lipid deposition in muscle has been associated with insulin resistance in cats and many other species.

Twelve lean and 12 obese adult cats (six neutered males and six neutered females each) were used. Postheparin plasma activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL), and fat and muscle activity of LPL were measured using glyceroltri[9,10(n)-3 H] oleate (triolein) as triglyceride substrate. LPL and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA expression were measured in muscle and fat tissue with real-time PCR using primers for feline LPL and HSL. Feline beta actin was used as control. LPL plasma and fat activity and fat mRNA expression were significantly lower (50%, 80%, and 50%, respectively) in obese cats, whereas muscle LPL activity and mRNA tended to be higher leading to a higher fat/ muscle ratio in obese compared to lean cats (p \u03fd 0.001).

The decrease in LPL activity and mRNA expression in fat and the increase in LPL and HSL mRNA expression in muscle favors a redistribution of fatty acids from fat to muscle tissue in obese cats where they can either be deposited or used for energy in times of caloric need because glucose uptake is diminished.

Immunohistochemistry was then performed on sections of skin samples from control horses in order to compare laminar results with those from another dermal structure. In the normal skin, a marginal pool of CD13-positive leukocytes was present around dermal venules. Interestingly, no CD-13 positive cells were present in normal laminar tissue. At the developmental time point post BWE, mild to marked CD13-positive cell infiltration into the laminar perivascular tissue was found. A marked infiltration of perivenular leukocytes was present in laminar sections from animals at the onset of acute lameness post BWE. Upon staining of serial laminar sections at the developmental time point for cell identification, the CD13-positive cells were found to be mainly PMNs; some CD13-positive cells in the affected laminae were monocytes/macrophages. The distinct lack of CD13-positive cells in the normal laminae when compared to skin samples suggests that the laminar vasculature does not have a marginal perivascular pool of leukocytes, possibly due to the protective barrier that the hoof wall provides when compared to normal skin. The marked infiltration of leukocytes noted (particularly at the developmental stage) suggests that, similar to organ damage in sepsis, an initiating factor in laminar injury may be the emigration of circulating leukocytes into the laminar tissue in the early stage of laminitis.",

The duration of Stage II labor impacts fetal survival in cases of equine dystocia. Institution of an organized, protocol driven approach to equine dystocia has been reported from a large private equine referral hospital located in central Kentucky, where the hospital and the patient population are proximate. We instituted a coordinated dystocia management protocol (CDMP) at our hospital in 1997 in an effort to improve time from presentation to dystocia resolution. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of instituting this CDMP on time to resolution and outcome in mare and foal, for both emergent cases (EM) and dystocia occurring in mares enrolled in a high-risk pregnancy (HRP) program, at a referral hospital where location of the hospital and the EM patient population generally results in longer transport time.",

Of the fetuses thought to be alive at the time of presentation, 82% were alive at delivery prior to 1997. This improved to 88% following CDMP implementation, although the change was not statistically significant. Survival of foals delivered alive remained low overall, with 9% of foals delivered from EM mares prior to 1997, and 13% of foals delivered from EM mares post-CDMP, surviving to discharge; again the difference was not statistically significant.

However, no significant difference in outcome for EM foals was observed, primarily related to longer duration of Stage 2 labor prior to referral after 1996. For HRP mares, the small change in time to resolution was not unexpected as most of these mares had a clear plan developed for approaching dystocia prior to the onset of Stage II labor The large and significant difference in foal survival between EM and HRP groups underscores the importance of minimizing time to resolution in cases of dystocia in mares. Where the hospital and patient are not proximate, referral should be instituted as soon as it become clear that dystocia will not be rapidly corrected, if fetal survival is important. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the types of myopathies that occur in Warmblood (WB) horses and determine their response to written diet and exercise recommendations provided after a diagnosis was established. Records of 1,400 muscle biopsies submitted to the Neuromuscular Diagnostic Laboratory were searched to identify 65 horses that were WB or WB crosses. The signalment, history, clinical abnormalities and muscle biopsy diagnoses were tabulated for each case. A questionnaire was administered to owners regarding their horse and an additional control horse to identify management factors prior to and after biopsy diagnosis, compliance with recommendations and response to treatment. Fifty % of owners responded. The data set contained 32% mares, 60% geldings and 8% stallions with mean age of 8.3 \u03ee 0.7 yrs. The primary presenting complaint was muscle soreness of the hind quarters and back, as well as stiffness, with 18% of horses showing overt signs of tying-up and 18% showing signs of Shivers. 60% of horses were diagnosed with polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM), 6% with recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis (RER), 5% with myofiber atrophy, 5% had nonspecific myopathic signs and 24% had no abnormalities. 44% of horses with reported Shivers were diagnosed with PSSM. Owners of all horses received similar written recommendations that included feeding grass hay and replacement of dietary grain with a high fat supplement combined with a gradually increasing daily exercise program and maximal turnout. Prior to diagnosis, 87% of WB horses received a concentrate without additional fat and 13% received a fat supplement. 8% of control horses were fed a concentrate without additional fat and 20% received a fat supplement. Prior to diagnosis, 54% of WB horses were getting no or light exercise only (30% in controls). After receiving our recommendations, 46% of owners followed the exercise, turnout and diet recommendations, 19% changed the diet, increased turnout without an increase in exercise, 31% changed the diet only and 4% of owners did not comply. Significant improvement in original clinical signs was noted in 54% of horses (46% changed diet, exercise, turn-out, 8% changed diet and turnout).",

Immune-mediated myositis (IMM) is commonly reported in human beings and dogs, however, there are few detailed reports of IMM in horses. The purpose of this study was to characterize the signalment, history, clinical signs, muscle biopsy findings and response to treatment of 31 horses with potential IMM. A retrospective study was done by reviewing records of 797 biopsies submitted to the Neuromuscular Diagnostic laboratory at the University of Minnesota. Biopsies from 31 horses were selected for inclusion based on the presence of lymphocytic vasculitis or myositis. Age and signalment were compared between horses with putative IMM and the 765 horses in the Neuromuscular Laboratory database with other diagnoses. Information was obtained from biopsy submission sheets and augmented by a standardized questionnaire administered to horse owners regarding the horse's health prior to muscle disease, course of the muscle disease, treatment given and response to treatment.

Shivers represents a common confounding disorder in Belgian Draft horses (BDHs) characterized by muscle tremors and hyperflexion of the hindlimbs, which may progress to weakness, atrophy and recumbency. Some horses with Shivers have been diagnosed with polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM) based on accumulation of abnormal polysaccharide in muscle biopsies.

The aim of this study was to look for evidence of platelet activation in horses with recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) in response to a controlled antigen challenge. Five RAO and five healthy control horses were maintained at pasture and received no medication for a minimum period of two months prior to the study. The investigation was carried out under a UK Home Office licence. The antigen challenge comprised placing each horse in a closed loose box for five hours with poor quality hay and straw, shaken hourly. Pleural pressure measurements were obtained immediately before, and at five and 24 hours post challenge. Venous blood samples were also collected at these times for measurement of platelet numbers (Coulter counter), PAF-induced platelet aggregation and thromboxane (Tx) production (Radioimmunoassay [RIA]), protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Western blotting) and plasma Tx (RIA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentrations (High Performance Liquid Chromatography).

To determine whether, similar to exercising human subjects, strenuously exercising horses exhibit intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunting which may con-tribute to arterial hypoxemia, experiments were carried out on seven healthy Thoroughbred horses at rest, and during submaximal (8 m/s on a 3.5% uphill slope) and maximal (14 m/s on a 3.5% uphill slope) exercise.",

Our observation in going from 30 to 120 s of maximal exertion that arterial O 2 tension remained unchanged despite significant reduction in the mixed-venous blood O 2 tension, O 2 saturation and O 2 content, also discounts the importance of intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunts in causing arterial hypoxemia. The importance of intrapulmonary shunts is discounted because, assuming that a constant fraction of total pulmonary blood flow bypasses the gas-exchange areas of the lungs via intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunts during 30 to 120 s of maximal exertion, the observed significant reductions in mixed-venous blood oxygenation should have caused further significant reductions in the arterial O 2 tension, which was not the case in our horses.",

These findings suggest that species differences may exist between humans and Thoroughbred horses regarding exercise-induced intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunting. Fluid exchange across the capillary endothelium is believed to obey Starling's law. Exercise at near peak VO 2 causes a marked increase in cardiac output with a less prominent increase in pulmonary vascular pressures. These adaptations coexist with redistribution of blood flow across the lung through the capillary recruitment and increase in the pulmonary surface area. Hence, changes in pulmonary hemodynamics during exercise contribute to increase in fluid movement across the alveolar-capillary barrier. The purpose of the study was to determine fluid movement across the alveolar-capillary barrier at rest and during exercise in horses.",

Findings presented herein should help in future research on specific airway conditions. Quantitifying pulmonary hemorrhage associated with exercise (EIPH) is important for determining the efficacy of various EIPH therapeutic modalities. Despite numerous studies, such quantification has proven difficult and controversial, with no consensus as to the most accurate/reproducible method. In addition, a commonly utilized method, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is not feasible in many settings. Most commonly, EIPH is detected by visual endoscopic evaluation of the upper airway and trachea. This study was performed to compare right and left-sided quantification of erythrocytes (RBC) in BAL fluid with RBC counts from tracheal wash fluid (TW) and to determine how well the common methods of detecting EIPH correlate with each other and with visual endoscopic scoring of hemorrhage in the trachea and/or bronchioles.",

Striking differences in magnitudes of proteinuria were observed among the dogs.

Different ratios of random inactivation of the normal or the mutated COL4A5 allele in cells that synthesize GBM collagen in these dogs probably account for much of this diversity of renal disease severity. Urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPC) is an index of magnitude of proteinuria that is widely used to assess dogs with proteinuria due to renal disease. Greater magnitude of proteinuria (ie, higher UPC) is associated with worse clinical outcomes, and serial UPC evaluations are used to monitor changes in disease severity and responses to treatment. Especially when serial UPCs are used for monitoring, clinical decisions hinge on distinguishing differences that reflect real changes in the prevailing magnitude of proteinuria from differences that may occur due to day-to-day biological variation of UPC in dogs with unchanged magnitudes of proteinuria. Such decisions currently are hindered by a paucity of data regarding day-to-day variation of UPC in proteinuric dogs.",

An alternative method used for evaluating the rate of decline in GFR entails plotting 1/SCr versus time, however, the relationship between 1/ SCr and GFR is not a perfect linear relationship.

Chronic HD was defined as HD therapy performed for longer than 2 weeks, and only data collected after this time were analyzed. Dogs and treatments (tx) were stratified as non-HK (K \u0545 5.3 mmol/L), mild HK (5.4-7.0) and severe HK (\u03fe7.0), according to preHD K \u03e9 ; the highest preHD K \u03e9 for the whole period analyzed was used for stratification of individual dogs. Data are presented as median [interquartile range].",

The cause is not determined from this study, but could involve dialysis induced events, alterations in potassium load, or altered potassium regulation associated with chronic uremia. There are multiple infectious causes of anemia in cats and the anemia can be regenerative or non-regenerative depending on the agent and the timing of laboratory testing. FeLV, FIV, feline infectious peritonitis, Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), and 'Candidatus M. haemominutum' (Mhm) historically are common causes of anemia in cats. Recently, an Ehrlichia canis-like organism and A. phagocytophilum infections of cats have been documented but only small numbers of cases have been reported. Anemia has been detected in humans infected with Bartonella henselae and dogs infected with Bartonella vinsonii, but to our knowledge the association of Bartonella spp. infection with anemia in cats have not been assessed. While Mhf and Mhm are thought to be the most common causes of feline infectious anemia, many cats submitted for testing are negative. The purpose of this study is to report the prevalence of select infectious agents in cats submitted for Mhf and Mhm PCR assay.",

Samples from anemic cats for which an obvious cause of anemia could not be detected were thawed and assayed in previously validated PCR assays that amplify the DNA of Mhf, Mhm, Ehrlichia spp., A. phagocytophilum, and Bartonella spp. To date, a total of 58 cases have been analyzed.

If cats in the treatment group had a relapsing infection or if they received a placebo, they were re-treated with RDZ at a higher dose of 30 mg/kg (n \u03ed 3) or 50 mg/kg (n \u03ed 7) orally twice daily for two weeks.

The TF isolated from these cats remained susceptible to RDZ. At 30mg/kg or 50mg/kg twice daily 9/ 10 cats have been cured after monitoring for 13 weeks and 4-6 weeks posttreatment, respectively. Spontaneous remission, adverse drug events or clinicopathological abnormalities were not noted. We concluded that oral administration of RDZ at 30-50mg/kg twice daily for two weeks is capable of resolving diarrhea and eradicating infection (on the basis of PCR) in cats infected with TF. We first reported B. henselae associated chronic uveitis in a cat with B. henselae antibodies in serum, local ocular production of B. henselae antibodies, and response to administration of doxycycline. In a follow-up study, we amplified B. henselae DNA from aqueous humor and demonstrated ocular production of B. henselae IgM and IgG antibodies in some cats with uveitis, but not healthy cats. In one other clinical study, several additional cats with uveitis and B. henselae serum antibodies were reported. However, numbers of cats with proven B. henselae associated uveitis are small to date because of difficulties associated with making a definitive diagnosis. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of B. henselae antibodies in cats with and without uveitis.",

Cases were classified as idiopathic uveitis (n \u03ed 75) if serum was negative for T. gondii antibodies, FIV antibodies, and FeLV antigen and aqueous humor was negative for Toxoplasma gondii DNA and FHV-1 DNA. Cats that were positive in one or more of these tests were classified as non-idiopathic (n \u03ed 34). Two groups of control cats were used in the analysis. Control group 1 consisted of serum samples from 109 clinically ill cats that were sent for infectious disease testing during the same time period; samples were excluded if ocular abnormalities or abnormalities consistent with feline bartonellosis (fever, lympadenopathy, stomatitis, or seizures) were mentioned. Control group 2 consisted of serum from 64 healthy cats. Age was recorded for each cat and the cat categorized as high or low risk for flea exposure by state based on previously published work. IgG antibodies against B. henselae were measured in all sera by a previously validated ELISA. Samples were categorized as being positive for B. henselae using cutoff points of \u05461:64 and \u05461: 128. The association between Bartonella status and uveitis was analyzed using logistic regression in two separate analyses accounting for age and risk of flea exposure in the model. While serological evidence of exposure to B. henselae was common in cats with uveitis (53.2% at the 1:64 cutoff), results were not significantly different between any of the groups regardless of which serological cutoff (1:64 or 1:128) was utilized.",

Over the past 20 years, prevalence of FeLV has decreased, presumably as a result of widespread test and removal programs and immunization against FeLV. Testing for FIV is less common than for FeLV, and the recently introduced FIV vaccine is not widely used. Whether prevalence of FIV is changing is unknown. Because testing is voluntary and results are not collected into a central database, determining the true prevalence of FeLV and FIV is difficult. A large national study published more than a decade ago reported a prevalence of 13% for FeLV and 7% for FIV in 27,976 diseased and ''high-risk'' pet cats. In contrast, the prevalence of infection in 1,876 unowned feral cats was reported to be only 4% for each virus. Prevalence was lowest in healthy pet cats in which 1.3% of 1,763 cats recently studied were positive for FeLV and 0.9% of 1,757 cats were positive for FIV.

In addition, all dogs interacted with other dogs on a regular basis, whether during exercise or as part of a multidog household.

At this point, all that can be said with certainty is that dogs can carry many organisms of potentially pathogenic consequence without displaying clinical signs. In light of this, veterinarians are in a unique position to protect the health of their patients, the owners, and the people they visit through health certification and education programs. Further, veterinarians and physicians should work together to better evaluate the risks of these potential pathogens and develop objective criteria for screening of hospital visitation dogs. The results indicate that the overall seroprevalence to these tick borne pathogens in southeastern Canada is low. Thus, veterinarians in this region should actively pursue the travel history of dogs visiting endemic areas for evidence of exposure to tick borne infections. In human patients elevated and sometimes extreme serum cobalamin concentrations have been reported in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, promyelocytic leukemia, polycythemia vera, hypereosinophilic syndrome, acute hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and metastatic liver disease. In contrast, no clinical significance has previously been reported for elevated serum cobalamin concentrations in dogs. Therefore, the goal of this study was to identify dogs with extreme serum cobalamin concentrations, record their clinical diagnoses, and also to measure serum cobalamin concentrations in a group of dogs with a variety of neoplastic diseases.",

The gut maintains a delicate balance between the downregulation of inflammatory reactions to the commensal bacteria and the capacity to respond to pathogens with vigorous cellular and humoral immune responses. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) possess many properties of cells of the innate immune system, in particular their ability to recognize and respond to microbial antigens. IEC recognition of microorganisms is based upon recognition of signature molecules on microorganisms called microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMP-LPS, PGN) by pattern recognition receptors (PRR-TLR4, TLR2, Nod2).",

CyA was effective in reducing clinical signs of severe steroidresistant IBD in a majority of dogs in this pilot study. The determination of serum cobalamin concentrations has been shown to be useful in diagnosing and characterizing intestinal and pancreatic disease in feline and canine patients. Mucosal pathology of the ileum, possibly due to severe chronic inflammation or neoplastic infiltration, leads to defects of the receptors for cobalamin/intrinsic factor complexes in the ileum. The lack of functional receptors subsequently results in malabsorption of cobalamin, utilization of cobalamin body stores, and low serum cobalamin concentrations. Also, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) can lead to cobalamin deficiency in cats. Thus, a decrease in serum cobalamin concentration in dogs and cats that do not have EPI indicates the presence of longstanding and severe small intestinal disease. In dogs, low serum albumin concentrations are commonly associated with chronic gastrointestinal disease. In cats, however, subnormal serum albumin concentrations have been rarely described in the context of chronic gastrointestinal disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of subnormal serum albumin concentrations in cats and dogs with low serum cobalamin concentrations.",

Bacterial infection is thought to accompany canine and feline hepatobiliary diseases, although there are few actual studies of common organisms, susceptibilities, or clinical predictors of a positive culture. The purpose of this retrospective study was to characterize the results of bacteriologic cultures of liver and bile in dogs and cats with hepatobiliary disease, referred to the Univ. of Wisconsin VMTH between 1998 and 2003. In 190 dogs, 7% of hepatic and 28% of biliary cultures were positive for bacterial growth; in 61 cats, 14% of hepatic and 36% of biliary cultures were positive. In patients in which both liver and bile cultures were performed, bile was more commonly positive. Most cats had a single organism identified (82% of feline cultures), whereas most dogs had multiple organisms cultured (61% of canine cultures). The most commonly cultured organisms were Eschericia coli (18% of positives), Enterococcus spp. (16%), Bacteroides spp. (11%), and Clostridium spp. (6%). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was a common contaminant. A positive liver culture was correlated with leukocytosis, but not with fever, left shift, toxic change, hyperbilirubinemia, or degree of increase in ALT or SAP activities. Samples from liver obtained by laparotomy or laparoscopy were more commonly positive (19%) than those obtained by needle biopsy (5%; P \u03ed 0.004). Susceptibility profiles indicated that 6/11 E. coli isolates (55%) were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, 7/11 (64%) to first generation cephalosporins, and 9/11 (82%) to fluoroquinolones; for enterococci, 10/10 (100%) were susceptible to penicillin.

All other components, including total protein, total fat, nitrogen-free extract, vitamins, and minerals were the same. All puppies used in the study were healthy, suckled normally, and ingested colostrum. The puppies were weaned beginning on day 29 to their respective mothers' diets. Prior to sampling, puppies were separated from their mothers for 2-3 hours (days 4, 10, 28) or fasted overnight (day 84). No other source of nutrition was provided to the dams. Bitches' milk supplied sole nutrition for each litter during suckling. As expected, enriching the canine gestation/lactation diet with n-3 LCPUFA using fish oil resulted in statistically significant increases in 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 and a decrease in 20:4n-6 both during suckling and after weaning. Plasma PL 22:5n-3 was unchanged. Visual function was assessed via electroretinography (ERG) in 84 day-old puppies. AN-OVA revealed significantly better visual performance in the high n-3 LCPUFA diet group. Puppies in this group demonstrated an increased rod response as measured by the amplitude and implicit time of the a-wave. A novel parameter devised in this study was the threshold intensity, which was measured as the initial intensity at which the a-wave was detectable. Again, puppies in the high n-3 LCPUFA diet group responded significantly sooner thereby exhibiting greater rod sensitivity, than the control group. These findings underscore the importance of preformed n-3 LCPUFA in the diet as a means of enriching plasma and neural tissues in DHA during the development. Moreover, dietary DHA appears to be related to improved visual performance in developing canines. HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and HDL apolipoprotein A-I (HDL-apo A-I) play a major role in the reverse cholesterol transport. This process includes a hepatic selective uptake of HDL-cholesteryl esters (HDL-CE) and is known to have significant antiatherogenic properties. In humans, insulin resistant states and type II diabetes are characterized by a low plasma concentration of HDL-C and impaired HDL-apo A-I metabolism. In dogs, obesity is a clinically important problem. In this species, as in humans, insulin resistance is associated with a low HDL-C. In humans, this low concentration is explained by an impaired HDLapo A-I metabolism.

Statins decrease plasma lipids but it has been shown that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis could upregulate intestinal cholesterol absorption. Thus, inhibition of both synthesis and absorption could be an emergent therapy for a more efficient cholesterol lowering. The hypothesis of an enhanced cholesterol absorption has only been tested using the measurement of plasma phytosterol as a marker of cholesterol absorption, but labeled cholesterol has never been used. Hypercholesterolemia has been described in dogs. Moreover, as obesity is becoming an important clinical issue, more information on cholesterol absorption and metabolism is needed.

However, whereas multiple dosing has proven effective for methimazole, no study of single dosing has demonstrated therapeutic drug concentrations of any drug in cats. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of the PLO to deliver in the cat two opioid analgesics that vary in lipophilicity: morphine (MOR) and fentanyl (FEN). Our laboratory previously has demonstrated ineffective delivery of either drug in the dog following PLO TD administration.

Blood was collected intermittently via pre-placed catheters for seven (MOR) or 72 (FEN) hours. Data was subjected to standard noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis.

Cardiac output (CO) is the best available parameter to assess overall cardiovascular function. Cardiac output monitoring would be valuable in critically ill and anesthetized neonatal foals. Because measurement of cardiac output is currently considered impractical for routine use in foals, arterial blood pressure is commonly used as an estimate of blood flow.

The results of this study underscore the importance of obtaining age-matched controls when evaluating clinical pathology values in the neonatal period. Neonatal isoerythrolysis (NI) is an alloimmune disease of foals that results in hemolytic anemia. The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical, hematologic, biochemical, and blood gas data from foals with NI over the last 15 years. The 18 foals included in the study had a diagnosis of NI: hemolytic anemia with a positive direct antiglobulin test (Coombs' test) and/or identification of anti-erythrocyte antibody in the dam's serum or colostrum. These consisted of five Quarter Horses, eight Thoroughbreds, one Standardbred, one Warmbloodcross, two Paints, and one mule, and 66% were fillies.",

Two crossmatch-compatible DEA 1.1 positive blood transfusions were administered without incident within a two-day period. Because of progressive anemia and failure to respond to recombinant human erythropoietin, the dog required additional transfusions by week 4, but a compatible donor was not readily available; all major crossmatch tests to 50 non-Dalmatian dogs were incompatible. In addition, the two initial donors were now also incompatible, suggesting the development of an alloantibody to a common antigen on the red cell membrane. All auto-controls performed were consistently negative, and a direct Coombs' test at 37 o C was also negative. No siblings of the anemic Dalmatian were available for compatibility assessment. However, 3 of 13 randomly crossmatched Dalmatians were compatible suggesting that they were also missing the same antigen. One of the compatible red cell units was transfused with the expected beneficial effects. The canine patient was found to be DEA 1.1, 3, 4, as well as 5 positive, but DEA 7 negative (reagents to other blood types are currently not available). Further blood typing and crossmatching results did not support an association to any of these known blood types. Thus, the red cell antigen recognized by this antiserum was called Dal. This Dalmatian's serum had a 1:8 anti-Dal titer (37\u040aC) which, based upon dithiothreitol exposure, was of the IgG class.

However, this pilot study revealed prolonged responses to thalidomide in some patients, which prompts a Phase 2 investigation of thalidomide in canine hemangiosarcoma. The optimal dose and schedule of administration in dogs remains to be determined but absence of myelosuppressive and significant adverse effects suggests thalidomide could be used with combination chemotherapy. We conclude that thalidomide (or its analogues) could open the possibility for novel treatment that targets tumours and their microenvironment. Antimicrobials are widely used in veterinary medicine. Previous studies in humans and animals have indicated that certain antimicrobials cause a disturbance in hemostasis, including thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction and disorders of secondary coagulation. The most commonly implicated antimicrobials include those in the \u2424-lactam family, however disturbances associated with sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, imipenem and metronidazole have also been identified. Many of the previous studies have used dosages of antimicrobials far in excess of published therapeutic dosage ranges, and very few in vivo studies assessing the effect of antimicrobials on hemostasis in veterinary medicine have been performed.

Digestion, absorption, and re-assembly of dietary fatty acids as triglycerides is a complex post-prandial (P-P) process in which hydrolysis of ingested triglyceride (TG), absorption of free fatty acids, and de novo re-synthesis of TG in intestinal mucosal cells occurs prior to chylomicron assembly. We have previously shown in dogs that dietary vegetable oils enriched in 1,3 diacylglycerol (DAG) decrease the extent of P-P hypertriglyceridemia. Studies in rodent species have found increased \u2424-oxidation and decreased de novo TG re-synthesis in mucosal cells with dietary DAG which help explain these phenomena. It was hypothesized that along with decreased P-P triglyceridemia, feeding a low glycemic index/DAG meal would also modify plasma lipolytic activities. Also, in spite of TG lowering, plasma fatty acid profiles seen with DAG vs. triacylglycerol (TAG) meals of similar fatty acid composition would be equivalent. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of DAG vs TAG meals on plasma hepatic (HL) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activities 6 hours after feeding and to evaluate P-P fatty acid profiles of plasma TG and phospholipids (PL) at 2, 3 and 4 hours after a single meal.",

Four different meals were fed containing cooked chicken breast combined with either DAG or TAG in the presence of either high or low glycemic index carbohydrate sources. High amylose corn starch (low glycemic index) and waxy corn starch (high glycemic index) were used. The meals were fed in random fashion to each of 12 Beagles and P-P blood samples were collected via jugular catheters at 0, 0.5, 1., 2.3, 4 and 6 hours. At 6 hours, 100 I.U. Na heparin was injected and post-heparin plasma collected 15 minute post-injection from the alternate cephalic vein. Plasma TG was determined using an enzymatic technique. Plasma TG and PL were fractionated via lipid extraction, thin-layer chromatography; methyl ester derivatives were prepared for gas chromatography of fatty acids. LPL and HL of postheparin plasma were assayed by differential radiolableled substrate techniques. No significant differences in LPL were found. However, HL was greater when the high amylase (low glycemic index) meals were fed. As expected, no alteration of fatty acid profiles was found in either TG or PL fractions during the post-prandial period with any of the meals. We conclude that glycemic index modifies HL activity more than dietary acylglycerol type. HL is involved in hepatic lipopoprotein uptake and helps to scavenge circulating TG via hepatic HDL-TG fatty acid uptake with low glycemic index meals. Also fatty acid profiles when DAG meals are fed are equivalent in to typical dietary oil responses. D-dimer is formed by degradation of cross-linked fibrin by thrombin and plasmin. In human beings and dogs, increased D-dimer concentrations are found with DIC and thromboembolic disease. Using a semiquantitative latex agglutination assay, Nelson et al. found significantly higher median D-dimer concentrations in dogs with either hepatic or thromboembolic diseases when compared with clinically healthy dogs.

MDS is considered to be a clonal hematopoietic disorder in a pluripotent stem cell, since monoclonal hematopoiesis was confirmed by clonality analysis of hematopoietic cell population. Diagnostic criteria of MDS in cats and dogs were delineated (Jain N et al., 1991) based on the French-American-British (FAB) classification system for the human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and MDS. Furthermore, Weiss et al proposed criteria for subclassification of MDS. But because reports of canine MDS are limited, hematological abnormalities and prognosis have been unclear.

Thrombocytopenia (TP) is commonly reported in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) and is frequently associated with macrothrombocytosis. Dogs do not appear to be at increased risk for bleeding and generally have normal platelet function. Most recently, pedigree analysis suggested an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and similarities to inherited macrothrombocytopenias in humans which are not well described. Mitral regurgitation (MR), secondary to myxomatous valvular disease, is also common in CKCS and has been shown to affect platelets including a reduction in number, increased size, altered aggregation, increased markers of activation and reduced survival time in humans. There also appears to be an increased risk for arterial thromboembolism in humans with MR which may be due, at least in part, to platelet activation. This study measured leukocyte-platelet aggregates with flow cytometry as biomarkers of platelet activation in 44 normal CKCS (24 male, 20 female) who presented for a cardiac screening clinic. Dogs were divided into two groups (presence of murmur, and TP where platelet count estimated from peripheral smear was \u03fd200,000).

It is also possible that some dogs without murmurs may have had mild MR as echocardiographic studies were not performed. Evaluation of a larger number of dogs with MR including echocardiographic evidence of MR is warranted. It is also possible that difficult blood collection could have resulted in platelet activation obscuring a difference between groups. The data suggests that some biomarkers of platelet activation may be increased in CKCS with TP which could result in reduced platelet survival and may be a possible explanation for the TP. Further flow cytometric analysis of platelets from CKCS with TP, including surface glycoprotein density, may be helpful in further describing this clinical condition. With the increasing popularity of retired rescued Greyhounds, veterinarians are likely to evaluate dogs of this breed more frequently in their practice. Therefore, it is important that they recognize the physiological peculiarities of this breed. For instance, mean PCV, hemoglobin concentration, RBC, and whole blood viscosity are higher, while white blood cell, neutrophil, and platelet counts are lower than in other breeds. In vitro platelet aggregometry has not been extensively studied in Greyhounds due to the difficulty in obtaining platelet-rich plasma, and the bucal mucosal bleeding time has marked inter-and intraobserver variability, so it is not clinically reliable. The PFA-100 is a novel point-of-care platelet function analyzer which is considered one of the most sensitive methods to assess primary hemostasis and to diagnose von Willebrand's disease in humans.

Comparison of these DNA sequences to the normal cFVII DNA sequence revealed a G to A missense mutation in exon 5 in the affected Beagles, resulting in substitution of glycine 96 (GGA) to glutamic acid (GAA) in the second epidermal growth factor-like domain. This novel FVII mutation has not been previously reported in human patients, although a different substitution (glycine to serine) at this residue results in human FVII deficiency. To investigate the effect of this mutation on FVII activity, site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to introduce the same mutation into the normal cFVII cDNA, and both normal and mutant cFVII constructs were transiently transfected into HEK cells. After a 48 hour incubation period, FVII activity in the supernatant from cells producing mutant cFVII was markedly reduced when compared to cells producing normal cFVII in a PT assay.",

In the two dogs receiving CRT for an additional six months, the QRS duration was less prolonged and both FS and D were much higher when compared to dogs paced from a single right ventricular site. CRT appears to confer significant benefits to both physiological (QRS duration, left ventricular FS) and clinical (distance walked) parameters in dogs with heart failure and prolonged QRS caused by RVP. These data may be relevant to comparative studies of CRT, to pacemaker therapy of spontaneous canine bradyarrhythmias, and to advanced management approaches for dilated cardiomyopathy in dogs.

The LV was divided into four quadrants including the anterior free wall, interventricular septum, posterior free wall, and lateral free wall. Regions-of-interest were manually traced within the quadrants of five mid-LV slices at end-systole. Myocardial contrast enhancement percentage (MCE) was calculated from summed weight-averaged data from all slices. Three-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed to identify whether cats with HCM have different MCE than normal cats. Simple linear regression was used to assess whether MCE was correlated with LV mass, LV mass index (LVMI), or diastolic function assessed by Doppler tissue imaging (DTI). A Student's T test was used to compare the standard deviations of the post-contrast myocardial signal intensity in cats with HCM compared to normal cats in order to evaluate the heterogeneity of the signal intensity of the myocardium.",

Delayed enhancement CMRI may not be a useful indicator of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in cats with HCM. The purpose of this study was to develop an in vitro model of resistance artery function in the dog, using tissues removed during ovariohysterectomy, to study the signalling pathways involved in vasoconstriction. Resistance arteries and arterioles influence peripheral blood pressure and may differ in their function from larger conducting vessels. Rho kinase may influence the response to vasoconstrictors by enhancing the sensitivity to intracellular calcium. Uterine tissue was obtained from healthy female dogs undergoing routine ovariohysterectomy. First and second order uterine arteries (normalised internal diameter 650 \u03ee 98 m) were dissected from the tissue and mounted between wires attached to the jaws of a Mulvany-Halpern wire myograph. Resting tension was applied to the blood vessels and after an equilibration period of 30 min, a contractile response was obtained to a standard depolarising Krebs solution (DKS; 118 mM KCl). Following washout and re-equilibration, contractile responses were then obtained to cumulatively increasing concentrations of the \u2423 1 -adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine (10 \u03ea8 -10 \u03ea4 M) in the presence and absence of the Rho kinase inhibitor, fasudil (3 M; 30 min pre-incubation).

A correction factor may be necessary for samples stored for prolonged intervals from populations of cats before batch analysis. However, the variability identified in this study makes any correction factor impossible to identify and use in individual cats. Spironolactone is an aldosterone-receptor blocker that acts at sites in the distal nephron of the renal tubules. While it is commonly used as a diuretic for the treatment of pulmonary edema, ascites, and for edema associated with nephrotic syndrome, there is no evidence of its diuretic efficacy when used in this manner. In a recent study presented at the 2004 ACVIM forum, spironolactone failed to induce diuresis when used alone in adult healthy dogs. However, because the diuretic efficacy of spironolactone is dependent on sodium delivery to the distal nephron, the use of other diuretics in conjunction with spironolactone may increase its diuretic activity. As spironolactone is most often used in conjunction with furosemide in the treatment of heart failure, it is important to determine its diuretic activity when used in conjunction with furosemide.",

Further studies will be necessary to determine if and to what extent renal function, especially glomerular filtration rate, is altered in heart failure due to MVD. Atrial fibrillation (AF) often accompanies and undoubtedly accelerates progression of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in large and giant breed dogs, including Irish wolfhounds. Lone AF is known to be heritable in Irish wolfhounds and is now suspected to cause DCM by unrelenting tachycardia. Medical therapy for AF, whether primary or secondary, is directed at control of tachycardia by decreasing ventricular response rate to control clinical signs and prevent long term complications. Medical therapy is guided by intermittent in-hospital ECG, however periodic measurements may not reflect adequacy of heart rate control over a 24-hour period. Holter monitoring may more accurately reflect the adequacy of rate-control therapy for AF, especially during exercise and excitement. Thus, we compared in-hospital ECG (two minutes) with heart rate data obtained with 24 hour Holter monitor in 32 Irish Wolfhounds with AF. Study participants were evaluated by complete blood count, serum biochemistry, thyroid panel, Doppler echocardiographic examination, standard ECG and 24-hour Holter monitoring. The study population was 63% male and included dogs with lone AF (68%) and concurrent DCM. ECG average HR did not significantly correlate with Holter-determined average HR (r \u03ed 0.302, 95% CI \u03ea.073 to .602), maximum HR (r \u03ed \u03ea.013, 95% CI \u03ea.378 to .355), or hours of tachycardia (r \u03ed \u03ea.356, 95% CI \u03ea.639 to .013). Mean ECG average HR (157 \u03ee 36 bpm) for all dogs was significantly higher (p \u03fd .0001) than mean Holter average HR (103 \u03ee 27 bpm). Mean Holter peak HR and hours of tachycardia for all dogs was 262 \u03ee 36 bpm and 9.438 \u03ee 7.845 hours, respectively. In dogs with lone AF verses dogs with DCM there was no significant difference between ECG average HR (p \u03ed .88), mean Holter HR (p \u03ed .82), peak Holter HR (p \u03ed .15), or hours of tachycardia (p \u03ed .40). In summary, in-hospital average HR tended to overestimate average HR determined over a 24 hour period, and more importantly, did not predict mean HR, peak HR or hours spent in tachycardia. Further, the ventricular response rate of AF was not different in dogs with lone AF and DCM. Thus, in-hospital HR is probably not an adequate guide to medical therapy in Irish wolfhounds with lone AF or DCM and AF. An inherited form of HCM has been described as a potential cause of heart failure, sudden death and arterial thromboembolism in Maine Coon cats. The early preclinical diagnosis of HCM in Maine Coon cats could have important implications since it should allow the early institution of medical treatment. Reference values for TDI parameters in this breed of cat are however needed for this. The aim of this study was to describe and analyze the left ventricular free wall (LVFW) motion in healthy non-sedated Maine Coon cats using quantitative 2D color TDI.",

For such, six adult female mongrel dogs, with mean weight of 15.93 Kg, were evaluated before (M0) and at 5 (M1), 15 (M2), 25 (M3), 35 (M4), and 45 (M5) minutes after the infusion of dipyridamole (0.5 mg/Kg diluted to a 10-mL volume, intravenously over 4 minutes). Dogs underwent two-dimensional echocardiographic evaluation with simultaneous EKG recording. Left-ventricular short axis images were acquired from the right parasternal view at the pappilary muscles level. We evaluated the left-ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), fractional shortening (FS), ejection fraction (EF), end-systolic left-ventricular volume index (ESLV-VI), stroke index (SI), and cardiac index (CI). Care was taken to obtain the same views at every moment of evaluation.",

Furthermore, the mild increase in heart rate was short-lived and did not result in ST segment shifts. Thus, DST was concluded to be a safe and feasible stress test to be performed in dogs. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia affecting racing performance in horses. Diltiazem is used for heart rate control in the treatment of AF in other species and its hemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects have been reported in normal horses. The goal of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of diltiazem in horses. Diltiazem, 1 mg/kg IV over five minutes, was administered to eight healthy horses. Venous blood samples were collected before and 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 360, 480, 720 , and 1440 minutes after administration of diltiazem. Plasma was harvested, snap-frozen, and stored at \u03ea80\u040aC until analysis. Plasma concentrations of diltiazem and its major metabolite (deacetyldiltiazem) were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares regression with relative weighting (1/y 2 ). A biexponential equation Cp(t) \u03ed A\u00b7e \u03ea\u2423t \u03e9 B\u00b7e \u03ea\u2424t , representing a two-compartment model with first-order drug elimination, best described the data. Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated: Diltiazem concentration at time 0, C 0 \u03ed A \u03e9 B; distribution half-life, t 1/2\u2423 \u03ed 0.693/\u2423, elimination half-life, t 1/2\u2424 \u03ed 0.693/\u2424; area under the plasma concentration time curve, AUC \u03ed A/\u2423 \u03e9 B/\u2424; area under the first moment curve, AUMC \u03ed A/\u2423 2 \u03e9 B/\u2424 2 ; total plasma clearance, Cl t \u03ed Dose/AUC; volume of distribution of the central compartment, V c \u03ed Dose/(A \u03e9 B); volume of distribution during the terminal phase V t \u03ed Dose/(AUC\u00b7\u2424); volume of distribution at steady state V ss \u03ed Dose\u00b7AUMC/AUC 2 ; mean residence time, MRT \u03ed AUMC/AUC; distribution and elimination constants, k 21 \u03ed (A\u00b7\u2424 \u03e9 B\u00b7\u2423)/(A \u03e9 B), k 10 \u03ed \u2423\u00b7\u2424/k 21 , and k 12 \u03ed \u2423 \u03e9 \u2424 \u03ea k 21 \u03ea k 10 . The AUC for diltiazem and its major metabolite deacetyldiltiazem were compared using the trapezoid method. Intravenous administration of diltiazem was well tolerated. The median peak plasma concentration was 727 (539-976) ng/mL. The median (min-max) pharmacokinetic var-iables of diltiazem were: C 0 696 (472-853) ng/mL, t 1/2\u2423 12 (6-23) min, t 1/2\u2424 93 (73-161) min, ) g\u00b7min/mL, AUMC 8, 185 (5, 296) g\u00b7min 2 /mL, Cl t 16.0 (11.5-21.0) mL/kg/min, V c 1.4 (1.2-2.1) L/kg, V t 2.2 (1.8-3.2) L/kg, V ss 2.1 (1.6-2.8) L/kg, MRT 126 (100-208) min, k 12 0.018 (0.006-0.035) min \u03ea1 , k 21 0.046 (0.022-0.071) min \u03ea1 , k 10 0.010 (0.008-0.014) min \u03ea1 . The ratio of the AUC of deacetyldiltiazem to that of diltiazem was 0.08 (0.06-0.16). A second metabolite was detected, but could not be identified and quantified due to the lack of an authentic standard. Plasma concentrations were similar to those required in healthy horses to produce consistent hemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects, but higher than therapeutic concentrations for treatment of AF in dogs and humans (60-300 ng/mL). The disposition of diltiazem dosed at 1 mg/kg IV to healthy horses is characterized by a rapid distribution and an elimination phase with a terminal half-life shorter than reported in humans (2-5 h), dogs (2.2-4 h) and cats (2 h). Due to the low plasma concentrations and reported low pharmacologic activity, drug metabolites are not considered clinically important. Ventricular arrhythmias are a common problem in certain dog breeds with cardiomyopathy, such as Boxers and Doberman pinschers. These arrhythmias can complicate the underlying cardiac disease and can cause sudden death. There is growing evidence for a relationship between specific types of dietary fat intake and arrhythmia in people and animal models, as well as for the therapeutic use of certain fatty acids in cardiac disease. Although fatty acid abnormalities have been documented in dogs with heart failure, a relationship between fatty acid concentrations and arrhythmia has not been demonstrated in dogs with naturallyoccurring disease. This is of particular interest in dogs at high risk for ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death. The purpose of this study was to determine whether 1) there is a difference in fatty acid concentrations between Boxers and Doberman pinschers; 2) there is a relationship between fatty acids and the number of VPCs; and 3) this relationship is different between the two breeds. Boxers and Doberman pinschers being evaluated by 24-hour Holter monitor recording and for which a blood sample was available were included in the study. The total number of VPCs per 24 hours was counted. A circulating fatty acid profile was performed for each dog using gas chromatography. Fatty acid concentrations are reported as the percent normalized concentrations, and were compared between the two breeds using independent t-tests. Spearman correlations were used to compare fatty acid concentrations to the number of VPCs/24 hours.",

In addition, the relationship between fatty acid concentrations and the frequency of VPCs may be different in these two breeds. Studies to further investigate these relationships are warranted. uretic peptide (BNP), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) may provide an attractive alternative to conventional screening. A threshold value of these substances would identify a subset of dogs with a high likelihood of occult disease and trigger the performance of additional diagnostics, such as ECG and echocardiography.

Blood-based detection of occult DCM can be accomplished using BNP assay and further work should be performed to optimize this test to assist in the screening of canine patients. The goal of this study was to determine the gene transcription of selected cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of healthy horses and horses with cervical stenotic myelopathy (CSM), West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis and spinal cord trauma using TaqMan PCR. The study material consisted of CSF collected at necropsy from 30 horses (12 healthy horses, eight horses with confirmed CSM, four horses with confirmed WNV encephalitis and six horses with confirmed spinal cord trauma). Total RNA was extracted from the spinal fluid nucleated cells, transcribed to complementary DNA and assayed for equine GAPDH, TNF-, IFN-\u2425, IL-2, IL-6, Il-8, IL-10, iNOS and TGF-\u2424 by TaqMan PCR. Final quantitation of cytokine transcription was done using the comparative C T method and was reported as relative transcription or the n-fold difference relative to a calibrator (weakest value across all target genes for normal CSF samples).",

Ehrlichia canis is a highly prevalent infectious agent in South America causing systemic illness in dogs. Infected dogs may show cardiac involvement, but its importance and prevalence are not known. Circulating cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is a highly specific and sensitive marker for myocardial cell damage in many mammalian species. Thus, we investigated serum cTnI concentration in dogs naturally infected with E. canis, clinically ill dogs not infected by E. canis, and healthy dogs. One hundred ninety three consecutive dogs seen at a Veterinary Teaching Hospital population in Botucatu, southeast Brazil, were selected. Dogs were included when showing at least three of the following inclusion criteria: presence of ticks, hyperthermia, bleeding, neurological signs, inflammatory ocular disorders, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and hyperproteinemia. Patients were excluded if they had a previous diagnosis of heart disease, had received anti-rickettsial medications within 30 days or cardiotoxic drugs, or have undergone cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Ehrlichia canis DNA was amplified in 109 dogs by nested PCR. These dogs were negative for Babesia canis (seminested PCR), Leishmania chagasi (indirect fluorescent antibody test) and for eight different serovars of Leptospira interrogans (microscopic agglutination test). The remaining 41 clinically-ill dogs were negative for E. canis, B. canis, L. chagasi and L. interrogans. Twenty healthy dogs were used as controls. Serum cTnI was measured using human cTnI kits (Dade Behring Dimension RxL clinical chemistry analyzer). Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Magnitude of association of risk for myocardial injury was determined by odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Differences were considered significant if p \u03fd 0.05. The cTnI concentration in E. canis infected dogs was 0.36 \u03ee 1.11 ng/mL (mean \u03ee SD; median \u03ed 0.06 ng/mL, P 25 \u03ed 0.02; P 75 \u03ed 0.18 ng/mL) being elevated (\u03fe0.07 ng/mL) in 44% of those dogs. cTnI concentrations in clinically-ill dogs without ehrlichiosis was 0.28 \u03ee 0.93 ng/mL (mean \u03ee SD; median \u03ed 0.04 ng/mL, P 25 \u03ed 0.0 and P 75 \u03ed 0.11 ng/mL) being elevated in 32% of those dogs. The cTnI concentration in controls was 0.02 \u03ee 0.05 ng/mL (mean \u03ee SD; median \u03ed 0.0 ng/mL, P 25 \u03ed 0.0 and P 75 \u03ed 0.01 ng/mL). cTnI was higher than in controls in both groups of ill dogs (p \u03fd 0.05). Dogs with ehrlichiosis (OR 7.08; 95% CI 1.57-32.03; p \u03ed 0.016) are more likely to have increased cTnI than healthy dogs, whereas systemically ill dogs without ehrlichiosis were not (OR 4.18; 95% CI 0.84-20.7; p \u03ed 0.604). Our results show that almost half of dogs with ehrlichiosis and no apparent heart disease had increased concentration of cTnI suggesting myocardial involvement. They are also seven times more likely to have myocardial injury than healthy dogs. It cannot be inferred if myocardial damage is a direct effect of the organism, a consequence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome or a bias of selection from our inclusion criteria. Long-term administration of benazepril (BNZ), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, has already been shown to improve quality of life, increase exercise tolerance and extend life expectancy in dogs with naturally acquired NYHA class II-IV heart failure due to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MVD) or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Pimobendan (PIMO), an oral inodilator compound, has been demonstrated to result in significant improvement in heart failure class when added to standard therapy in dogs with DCM and is also registered in many countries for use in canine congestive heart failure due to MVD. The cardiac effects of both BNZ and PIMO on dogs with asymptomatic (class I) MVD are however unknown. The aim of this study was to compare the cardiac effects of long-term monotherapy with PIMO or BNZ in dogs with asymptomatic MVD and mild mitral valve regurgitation.",

The major collagen types present in normal and diseased hearts include types I and III. Excessive deposition of collagen resulting in fibrosis causes reduced myocardial compliance and potentiation of arrhythmias. Progressive fibrosis generates an increase in serum products of collagen turnover. Procollagen type III aminoterminal peptide (PIIINP) is one biomarker of this process. Increased serum PIIINP concentrations were initially identified in patients with fibrotic diseases of the liver and lung, osteoarthritis, neoplasia, renal failure, and several cardiac diseases including systemic hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), primary valvular disease, and coronary artery disease. In human heart failure patients, elevated PIIINP correlates with functional heart failure class and is associated with an increased mortality.

Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM) is generally associated with the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype. Experimental studies and postmortem findings suggest that abnormal orientation of left ventricular papillary muscles with or without concurrent structural abnormalities of the mitral valve leaflets predispose to SAM. It is believed that SAM results when abnormal drag forces act on the mitral valve causing anterior displacement of leaflet tissue with potential consequences of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) narrowing and mitral valve regurgitation. It is established that SAM is labile and factors that provoke or augment SAM include diminished preload, diminished afterload and increased inotropic state.",

Relative to body-weight, the end-diastolic left ventricular dimension was subnormal in all patients. Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic performance was identified in all patients.

Based on the results of this study, secondary intracranial tumors are more common than primary intracranial tumors in dogs. Signalment and presenting clinical signs are similar for dogs with primary and secondary intracranial neoplasia. Thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasonography are indicated to look for metastatic disease or extracranial neoplasia prior to advanced imaging of the brain. Inflammatory myopathies characterized by extensive infiltration of histiocytes into endomysial and perimysial connective tissue have recently been described in humans. Such disorders have been named macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) or inflammatory myopathy with abundant macrophages (IMAM). MMF has been linked to the administration of aluminum hydroxide-containing vaccines. IMAM has similar histological features without the vaccine association and is a more aggressive disease. In addition to the characteristic histiocytic infiltrates, there are CD8\u03e9 lymphocytic infiltrates and a lack of muscle fiber damage. Similar histological features including lack of myofiber damage and endomysial and perimysial infiltration of dendritic cells expressing CD1c/CD11c/CD4 and macrophages expressing CD11b have recently been identified in five dogs.",

Three dogs were Rottweilers, one was a Rottweiler mixed breed, and one was a Labrador retriever dog. The average age at presentation was 4.2 yrs (range, 3-6 yrs); there were four female spayed dogs and one male neutered dog. Historical/clinical findings included generalized muscle atrophy (two dogs), lethargy (two dogs), unilateral facial swelling in the temporal (two dogs) and masseter (one dog) regions, jaw pain/difficulty opening the jaw (two dogs), abnormal pelvic limb gait (two dogs), apparent myalgia (two dogs), fever (two dogs), appendicular stiffness/lameness (two dogs), and dysphagia/hypersalivation (one dog). Creatine kinase levels were measured in three dogs; results were normal in two dogs and elevated in one dog. Electromyography was normal in the dog for which it was performed. Two dogs were tested for serum antibody against type 2M fibers; both were negative. Contrast enhancement of the epaxial and temporalis musculature was demonstrated on MRI in one dog. Four dogs were treated with immunosuppressive doses of prednisone, to which three responded favorably.

This is also the case in human heterozygous carriers of recessive myotonia congenita. However, the myotonic discharges in Miniature Schnauzers are shorter in heterozygotes than in homozygotes. In homozygous dogs, the duration of the myotonic discharge is not improved by the administration of procainamide or phenytoin, despite anecdotal evidence of clinical improvement in some patients receiving these drugs. The only anticonvulsant known to be safe and effective for use in cats with seizure disorders is phenobarbital (PB). Bromide has been demonstrated to be fairly ineffective as an anticonvulsant drug in this species, and often causes an idiosyncratic allergic pneumonitis. Oral diazepam, though often effective in controlling seizures in cats, occasionally is implicated as the cause of acute fatal hepatic necrosis in this species. Veterinarians are understandably reticent to try some of the newer anticonvulsant drugs currently used for dogs for feline seizure disorders, due to the potential for severe side effects. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a new anticonvulsant drug that does not undergo any hepatic metabolism in people or dogs. It has been shown to be effective as an add-on anticonvulsant in both species, with no apparent side effects at recommended dose regimens. Four cats with seizure disorders that were poorly controlled with PB alone were treated with oral LEV as an add-on drug at a dose regimen of 20 mg/kg body weight, q 8 h. Three of the four cats were suspected to have idiopathic epilepsy. One cat had an intracranial meningioma (removed surgically) and subsequently developed a pancreatic insulinoma. Surgery for the insulinoma was declined; the cat's hypoglycemia was managed with prednisone and diazoxide. The mean PB level prior to LEV was 35.8 ug/ml. After receiving LEV for a minimum of one week, serum samples for LEV concentrations were drawn at times 0, 2h, 4h, and 6h post-administration. These samples were assayed for LEV via HPLC at a commercial laboratory. The seizure frequency after LEV institution was estimated and compared with the estimated pre-LEV seizure frequency for an equal time period. Owners were questioned about side effects, and all patients were re-examined by one or more of the authors at regular intervals. Follow-up CBC and blood chemistry evaluations were performed for all four cats for a minimum of three months. None of the four cats exhibited any side effects attributable to LEV therapy. With the exception of the cat with the insulinoma (mildly increased ALT), bloodwork abnormalities were limited to slightly elevated SAP in two cats. LEV serum concentrations were within the reported therapeutic range for people (5-45 ug/ml) for all samples in all cats. The overall average serum LEV level for all cats was 16.5 ug/ml (range: 6.9-24.3 ug/ml). The median serum half-life (t \u00bd) of elimination for LEV in cats was 5.3 h. Seizure frequency was reduced by an average of 30.5% in 3 cats, and increased by 33.3% in one cat. The results of this pilot study suggest that levetiracetam is a safe drug for cats that may provide some therapeutic benefit when used as an add-on to phenobarbital. Microglial cells are the immune effector elements of the brain. In response to pathological changes in the central nervous system (CNS) they become activated and can exert multiple functions in order to regain homeostasis such as cell to cell interaction, phagocytosis, and generation of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This microglial response has long been believed to follow a uniform unspecific reaction pattern which is irrespective to the underlying pathology. Various studies point to an important role of ROS generation in the pathogenesis of demyelination. In vitro studies in humans suggest a central role of microglia as effectors and regulators of demyelination.",

Despite severe diffuse spinal cord axonopathy, no proprioceptive ataxia was observed. The clinical signs reflected the motoneuron loss. Genetic studies are being conducted to determine the inheritance mode of this disease. Intravenous (IV) catheter associated infections (CAI) are one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections documented in human patients resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay and financial costs to medical institutions. IV CAI and potential associated risk factors have been researched and well documented in human medicine leading to the development of practices, protocols and instrument advances aimed at decreasing the risk of CAI. Prospective studies in veterinary patients evaluating CAI and the relation of possible associated risk factors are lacking. The study reported here is a prospective surveillance study aimed to assess the CAI rate in our ICU patients, as well as attempt to identify potential risk factors that might be associated with increased infection rate in veterinary patients. Dogs and cats admitted to the ICU in which a peripheral or central venous catheter (CVC) was placed and maintained for a minimum of 48 hours were included. 16 or 18 gauge 28 cm Venocath catheters were placed in the jugular or saphenous vein, or 22 and 20 gauge 1 inch or 18 gauge 1\u00bd inch Terumo Surflo catheters were placed in the cephalic or saphenous vein. Strict protocols were followed regarding catheter placement and re-moval. Catheter tips were submitted in sterile saline for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Any growth was considered a positive culture. All positive cultures underwent bacterial identification and antimicrobial sensitivity testing. A total of 151 catheter tips were submitted for culture with a positive culture rate of 24.5% (37/151). Enterobacter was most commonly cultured representing 45.95% (17/ 37) of positive cultures. Potential risk factors were statistically evaluated with the chi-squared or Fisher exact test. Risk factors analyzed included catheter use, type of infusate (blood products, TPN, dextrose, hetastarch, and PPN), corticosteroid administration, catheter location, catheter type, and duration of catheterization, as well as catheter associated complications. Placement of a Venocath central venous catheter was associated with increased risk of CAI (P \u03ed \u03fd0.05). No other risk factor was statistically significant. Venocath catheters were then assessed alone. 101 Venocath catheters were submitted for culture with 24.75% (25/101) positive culture rate. Each previously mentioned risk factor, as well as multiple risk factors affecting the same catheter were assessed and no statistical significance was found. In conclusion, CAI rate was similar to CAI rates previously reported in human and veterinary medicine. Enteric pathogens were more commonly isolated in our study compared to human studies. Venocath CVC were associated with increased risk of CAI in cats and dogs in our ICU.",

Nociception and respiratory function appeared normal. Case 2 was a 6-year-old, neutered male Beagle mix referred for severe progressive tetraparesis. Neuroanatomic localization of both cases was to the C1-C5 segment of the spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis prior to myelography in Case 1 was within reference range. In both cases, a myelogram was performed by lumbar injection of iohexol [Omnipaque] . A ventral extradural compressive lesion was identified over the C3-C4 disc space in Case 1, and C4-C5 disc space in Case 2. Both dogs underwent ventral decompressive surgery to remove herniated disc material from the epidural space. Both surgeries were uneventful; however, the dogs failed to recover consciousness or spontaneous respiration following anesthesia. Absence of papillary light reflex, oculocephalic reflex, response to painful stimuli, and brainstem auditoryevoked potentials suggested loss of brainstem function, and the dogs were euthanized.",

Presenting neurological signs included seizures, blindness and mentation changes from five days to 6.5 months duration. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid from three dogs indicated total nucleated cell counts ranged from normal to 180/ul and protein levels from 52mg/dL to 72 mg/dL. with a final interpretation, supported by the differential cell count, of an inflammatory disease. Magnetic resonance imaging showed loss of normal grey/white matter demarcation multifocally throughout much of the cerebral cortex, with cortical hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging. Two dogs were administered anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive medications (prednisone and/or cytosine arabinoside) with no significant clinical response. All dogs were necropsied. Multifocal asymmetrical areas of necrosis, primarily confined to both grey and white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, were identified grossly in all brains. Overlying gyral collapse was seen with some cavitatory lesions. Microscopically, there was a severe necrotizing non-suppurative meningo-encephalitis sometimes with cystic cavitation. Two dogs also had small lesions in the medulla. Immunophenotyping of inflammatory cells defined consistent populations, but varying in density, of CD18, CD3, CD20, CD45 R and CD 79a positive cells in the lesions. In fresh frozen sections of lesions, there were some CD1 c and CD11 c positive dendritic antigen-presenting cells. Immunocytochemical staining for CDV antigen was negative in all cases.

In addition, cell membrane receptors may have a decreased sensitivity to serum ionized calcium (iCa) in the presence of low serum iMg concentrations. Some patients with hypoparathyroidism appear refractory to therapy with calcium and vitamin D preparations, and a deficiency or excess serum iMg may in part play a role. The objective was to determine the serum iMg status in dogs and cats with hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism was diagnosed in 357 dogs, and in 27 cats over a two year period. A diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism was made based on clinical signs, a low serum iCa concentration, and an inappropriately low PTH concentration in response to hypocalcemia. Dogs and cats already undergoing treatment for hypoparathyroidism were excluded from this study. PTH, iMg and iCa concentrations were determined using the same serum sample. Mixed-breed dogs accounted for 25% of the cases, with 13% Schnauzers, 7% Labrador Retrievers, 5% Dachshunds, 4% Yorkshire Terriers, 4% poodles, 3% Golden Retrievers, and 3% Scottish Terriers. Fifty nine other dog breeds were represented with an incidence of less than 3% each. Of hypoparathyroid cats, 59% were domestic shorthairs, 22% were an unspecified breed, and 15% were Siamese. In dogs with hypoparathyroidism, mean iCa concentration was 0.79 \u03ee 0.19 mmol/L (reference range 1.25-1.45 mmol/L), mean PTH concentration was 1.9 \u03ee 1.6 pmol/L (reference range 2-13 pmol/L), and mean iMg concentration was 0.45 \u03ee 0.09 mmol/L (reference range 0.43-0.60 mmol/L). The iMg concentration was below the reference range in 39%, within the reference range in 55%, and above the reference range in 6% of dogs with hypoparathyroidism. Of the 55% of dogs with iMg within the reference range, 69% had an iMg concentration within the lower half of the reference range, and only 31% had an iMg concentration within the upper half of the reference range. In cats with hypoparathyroidism, mean iCa concentration was 0.72 \u03ee 0.14 mmol/L (reference range 1.0-1.4 mmol/L), mean concentration was 1.5 \u03ee 0.9 pmol/L (reference range 0-4 pmol/L), and mean iMg concentration was 0.47 \u03ee 0.11 mmol/L (reference range 0.43-0.70 mmol/L). The iMg concentration was below the reference range in 37%, within the reference range in 59%, and above the reference range in 4%. Of the 59% of cats with iMg within the reference range, 88% had an iMg concentration within the lower half of the reference range, and only 12% had an iMg concentration within the upper half of the reference range. These results suggest that a large number of dogs and cats with hypoparathyroidism have a subnormal or marginal circulating concentration of iMg which may decrease cell membrane receptor sensitivity to iCa and hinder PTH production. Future studies to evaluate the impact of magnesium supplementation in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism should be investigated. Burmese cats in Australia, New Zealand and the UK have an increased risk of developing diabetes, but the underlying pathological cause is unknown. Some predisposing factors in Burmese cats have been identified, such as chronic or recurring medical problems, dental disease, repeated corticosteroid treatment, confinement indoors and lower physical activity. Islet amyloidosis and pancreatitis have been ruled out as primary causes of diabetes in Burmese cats. The aim of this study was to compare glucose and insulin parameters between matched Burmese and non-Burmese cats before and after a glucose challenge, to better understand their predisposition to diabetes.",

Early detection and treatment of diabetes is essential to halt progression of the disease. Specific proinsulin assays are required for the early detection of beta cell dysfunction because a change in the proinsulin secretion, and therefore a change in the ratio of insulin or C-peptide and proinsulin, is one of the earliest markers of the disease process in man.

Primers were designed based on alignment of known proinsulin cDNA sequences from other species. The cDNA was transcribed from feline pancreatic messenger RNA using a non-specific T-tailed primer, then amplified by routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a specific sense primer. The resulting PCR product contained the sequence of the entire coding region for the mature form of feline proinsulin, which encompasses the coding sequence for the A, B, and C chain. This proinsulin sequence was functionally organized similar to other mammalian proinsulins as follows, from the 5\u0408 to the 3\u0408 direction: 5\u0408-nontranslated region (NTR)-signal peptide coding region with intron, followed by the B-chain coding region, followed by the C-chain coding region with intron, followed by the A chain coding region, followed by a stop codon, followed by 3\u0408NTR. A synthetic feline proinsulin DNA sequence was then prepared to reflect optimization of the codons for the subsequent expression in E. coli. After routine PCR of the entire synthetic feline proinsulin coding sequence, the amplified DNA was cloned into an expression vector and transformed into competent cells. Proinsulin was purified as described (Protein Expression and Purification 27:210-219, 2003) . Primers for C-peptide were designed based on the known proinsulin sequence. Cloning procedures, and expression in pET vector was similar to that described for proinsulin. The protein was purified using HPLC. Feline proinsulin and human proinsulin have 72 amino acids out of 86 in common, for an overall percentage identity of about 84%. It has the same number of amino acids as human proinsulin, whereas pork and beef proinsulin both have deletions in the C-chain compared to human and feline proinsulin. Feline and human C-peptide differ at 10 positions. Purified feline-specific proinsulin and C-peptide have been used to produce antibodies which will allow the early detection of changes in beta cell function. This work describes for the first time the full coding sequences of feline proinsulin, insulin, and C peptide and has produced DNA constructs for its in vitro expression and purification of the recombinant peptides. These purified recombinant proteins allow the development of standards and immunoassay reagents for the measurement of these peptides to assess pancreatic beta cell function. The pathogenesis of feline hyperthyroidism is not understood at the cellular or molecular level. Previous studies from our laboratory have identified a specific decrease in expression of the inhibitory G proteins (Gi) in hyperthyroid cells (Hammer et al, AJVR 61, (874) (875) (876) (877) (878) (879) and have further determined that Gi2 is the specific subset of Gi proteins that is decreased (Ward et al, JVIM 15, 298) . Moreover, stimulatory G proteins (Gs) were determined to be present in normal levels in hyperthyroid cells. We postulate that this decrease in expression of Gi2 is part of the pathogenesis of feline hyperthyroidism. Although the expression level of Gi2 is decreased, the activity of Gi and Gs proteins has not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine whether G protein activity is altered in feline hyperthyroid cells.",

The feline common pituitary alpha gene was cloned from the total RNA extracted from the feline pituitary gland by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The gene fragment that encodes mature TSHbeta was cloned from the feline genomic DNA by direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Following the experience with improved expression of the human TSH beta subunit, the second intron was included to produce a fTSHbeta mini-gene construct. For both subunits, primers were based on consensus sequences from TSH in other species. The resulting 510 bp PCR product for the alpha subunit included the full coding sequence of the 96 amino acid mature subunit preceded by that of a 24 amino acid signal peptide. The predicted amino acid sequence of the mature \u2423 subunit had the following species homologies: to canine (98%), bovine (95%), tiger (97%) and human (69%). The 850 bp sequence of fTSHbeta genomic DNA consisted of two coding exons, an intron of 418 bp and a 60 bp signal sequence. The mature fTSHbeta subunit is homologous to canine (94%), human (88%), bovine (91%) and equine (95%) TSHbeta subunits. An immunoaffinity tag FLAG was added to 3\u0408 end of the alpha gene to facilitate detection by Western blot and purification. In human pituitary glycoproteins, single chain or yoked analogues have been shown to have increased stability and bioactivity. In the current study, yoked fTSH (yf-TSH) was developed by fusing the nucleotides encoding the C-terminus of the beta subunit to the N-terminus of the alpha subunit by using DNA encoding the C-terminal peptide (CTP) of human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit of 26 amino acids as a linker peptide. The yoked fTSH construct encoded from Nterminus to C-terminus: beta-CTP-alpha-FLAG. The construct of 1260 bp was cloned and sequence confirmed. This work describes for the first time the full coding sequences of the two subunits of fTSH and has produced DNA constructs for its in vitro expression and purification. One out of every three hundred cats is now diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. A diagnostic tool that can sensitively detect changes in thyroid status is essential to understand thyroid pathology in the cat and also to diagnose this condition at an earlier stage. Lacking an available source of pituitary-derived fTSH, previously cloned fTSH alpha and beta subunits were ligated into the expression vector PEAK and expressed in modified human embryonic kidney cells (PEAK). As the alpha subunit has two and beta has one N-linked glycosylation sites, expression in a mammalian cell is critical for appropriate post translational modifications and folding. The fTSH alpha and beta subunits were cloned separately downstream of the EF-1\u2423 promoter of the PEAK expression vector, and transiently co-transfected into PEAK cells. Similarly, a previously cloned and sequenced yoked fTSH (yfTSH) gene was ligated into the PEAK vector, transfected into PEAK cells with puromycin selection generating a stable cell line expressing yfTSH. The alpha subunit was also stably transfected into PEAK cells to generate a stable cell line expressing the feline pituitary alpha protein.",

The glycoproteins were purified in one step using anti-FLAG immunoaffinity column chromatography to high purity based upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver stain. All glycoproteins were standardized by protein assay. The purified alpha-FLAG glycoprotein had a molecular weight of 20.4 kDa and that of yfTSH-FLAG was 45 kDa. Both were recognized by anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody in Western blot. The glycosylated beta subunit had a molecular weight of 16.2kDa. Both heterodimeric and yoked glycoproteins were recognized by an in-house canine TSH ELISA employing a capture monoclonal antibody previously selected for ovine/canine TSHbeta and a polyclonal antibody generated previously against pituitary canine TSH, as well as by the commercially available canine TSH assay (Diagnostic Products Corp.). However, both assays detected only 33% of the recombinant fTSH as standardized by protein assay. The yoked glycoprotein exhibited parallelism with the heterodimeric form in the in-house ELISA. The recombinant heterodimeric fTSH exhibited 30% of the potency of a pituitary-source bovine TSH (bTSH) standard at inhibiting 125 I-bTSH binding by JP09 cells expressing the human TSH receptor [IC50 (ng/ml; mean \u03ee SD) fTSH: 43 \u03ee 2; bTSH: 13 \u03ee 3]. Discrepancies in immunological detection and biological potency remain to be clarified. This work constitutes the first report of in vitro expression and purification of recombinant feline thyrotropin. The demonstration of immunological recognition by antibodies generated against pituitary-source TSH, and of bioactivity confirms that the recombinant glycoprotein may be used to standardize and improve clinical assays for feline TSH.",

Additional studies are warranted to assess the value of MA screening for dogs with early Lyme nephritis. We found no association between B. burgdorferi exposure and MA in asymptomatic young Labrador Retrievers. Therefore MA screening is likely to be a valuable test for identifying dogs with early ''Lyme nephritis''. A positive MA result may identify dogs with true renal pathology and will not just be an incidental result of B. burgdorferi exposure. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important cause of hospital-acquired infections in human hospitals worldwide and is increasingly being identified as a community-associated pathogen. The structural gene responsible for methicillin resistance, mecA, encodes a penicillin-binding protein (PBP) that facilitates decreased affinity to \u2424-lactam antibiotics and MRSA isolates are frequently also resistant to a variety of other antimicrobial classes. MRSA infection is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in humans and there are increasing reports of serious, including fatal, MRSA infections in pets. Transmission of MRSA between pets and owners in households and veterinary clinics has been identified. Although risk factors and transmission patterns for MRSA infection in humans have been heavily studied, there has been minimal investigation into the prevalence or clinical implications of MRSA colonization in dogs. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of subclinical MRSA colonization in a canine population that presented to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) at the Ontario Veterinary College.",

The use of either method is acceptable for clinical practice. Trichomonads are occasionally observed in feces of dogs with diarrhea. On the basis of superficial morphological appearance, these infections have been attributed to opportunistic overgrowth of the commensal, P. hominis. However, molecular characterization of canine trichomonads has never been reported. This study was performed to determine, by means of rRNA gene sequence analysis, the identity of trichomonads observed in feces from dogs with diarrhea. Total DNA was extracted from fecal samples obtained from a three-month-old mixed breed dog and litter of German Shepherd pups having profuse liquid diarrhea containing numerous trichomonads. Total DNA was subject to PCR amplification of rRNA genes using species specific and universal primers respectively. PCR products were cloned and bidirectionally sequenced. The three-month-old mixed breed dog had clinical signs of profuse watery diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, and lethargy. The dog was born into a closed research colony and had no history of contact with cats, swine or cattle. In addition to copious numbers of trichomonads, fecal samples tested positive for Giardia sp. antigen, and contained numerous Clostridium sp. spores and low numbers of inflammatory cells. Feces were negative for Cryptosporidium antigen and helminth ova. A 642 base pair product of the 18S rRNA gene was amplified and cloned from DNA extracted from feces. The sequence shared 100% identity with T. foetus (AY754332). The pup was treated with metronidazole and fenbendazole. Diarrhea gradually resolved and feces were negative for T. foetus by PCR 15-mos after diagnosis. The litter of German shepherd pups (n \u03ed 6) were four weeks of age and had clinical signs of acute-onset profuse liquid diarrhea, weight loss, and weakness. Feces contained numerous motile trichomonads and Isospora canis ova and were negative for Giardia sp. and parvoviral antigen. An 1864 base pair product of the 5.8S, ITS1, ITS2, partial 18S and 28S rRNA genes was amplified and cloned from DNA extracted from feces. The sequence shared 100% identity with P. hominis (AY758392). The pups were treated with fenbendazole and four of six died within four days. For the remaining two pups, diarrhea gradually resolved and the dogs were reportedly healthy six months later. The present study is the first to establish the molecular identity of trichomonads infecting dogs with diarrhea. These studies validate the longstanding assumption that canine trichomoniasis may be attributed to P. hominis. Importantly, these studies additionally recognize that canine trichomoniasis may be caused by infection with T. foetus. This report is consistent with prior studies in suggesting that trichomonads flourish in young dogs having diarrhea associated with co-existing intestinal infection. Whether there is any prognostic significance to the identity of trichomonads or whether trichomoniasis contributed directly to diarrhea in the present cases cannot be resolved by the present study. A number of different infectious diseases cause morbidity and mortality in the domestic feline population with some infectious agents being of zoonotic concern. Infected cats can serve as reservoirs and directly transmit infectious agents or can carry infected flea and tick vectors into contact with other animals including humans. Fleas and ticks are common in Arizona. An Ehrlichia canislike organism is known to infect cats, but documented cases in the literature are few. Because E. canis infection is common in dogs in Arizona (12% seroprevalence rate), we hypothesized that it would be a logical state in which to perform a prevalence study in order to identify more E. canis infected cats to study. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Ehrlichia sp., A. phagocytophilum, Mycoplasma haemofelis, 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum', and Bartonella sp. DNA in blood of cats in Arizona.",

Feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) infection is very common in cats, is extremely contagious between cats, and frequently results in severe clinical disease. In a recent prevalence study at a humane society in north central Colorado, FHV-1 DNA was amplified from throat swabs or nasal discharges collected from 52 of the 61 cats (85.2%) tested. Thus, it is important to induce immunity in kittens by vaccination quickly, particularly in populations at high risk for exposure.

Changes in the B. gibsoni mitochondrial DNA sequence for cytochrome b, which binds atovaquone, were also studied. Three dogs were experimentally infected with B. gibsoni isolated from naturally infected dogs in Aomori Prefecture, Japan. Once parasitemia reached 10%, atovaquone was administered orally (30 mg/kg twice daily for seven days). Although the parasite disappeared from blood smears within two days of atovaquone treatment, by 33 \u03ee 2 days after the last treatment, parasites reappeared in blood smears. An in vitro sensitivity test was performed using peripheral blood collected from two dogs at the time of recurrence. For the original parasites, complete growth inhibition occurred at 1000 nM of atovaquone, whereas the recurring parasites were inhibited by only 39.5 \u03ee 8.3% and 31.3 \u03ee 8.1% of this concentration after 48 hour of incubation, respectively. DNA isolated from recurring B. gibsoni in the three dogs was sequenced for the cytochrome b gene and compared with that from the original parasite. A single nucleotide mutation resulting in one amino acid replacement (methionine to isoleucine) was common to all three dogs. This mutation was seen only in recurring parasites after atovaquone treatment, but not in pretreatment parasites, using restriction length fragment polymorphism analysis. These results indicated that the use of atovaquone therapy alone allows the recrudescence of parasites and decreases parasite susceptibility to this drug. Point mutations in the sequence for mitochondrial cytochrome b might be associated with this. Feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) infection is common in cats and disease manifestations can be severe. Protection against FHV-1 is mediated in part by cellmediated immune responses. A FVRCP vaccine (Feline UltraNasal FVRCP Vaccine, Heska Corporation) for intranasal administration (FVRCP-IN) was recently licensed in the United States.

First PCR-RFLP and or gene sequencing can be used to screen B. gibsoni isolates for mutations that could result in resistance to atovaquone. Secondly cytochrome B is present with Babesia organisms as a multi-copy extrachromosomal molecule with some species having over 100 copies/organism. Making it an attractive target for molecular diagnostic test development that should provide improved sensitivity over the currently available tests. When considering bacteria as a cause or cofactor in a disease state, culturing one or more organisms from tissue samples is frequently used to support causation. Unfortunately, certain bacteria, such as Bartonella, fail to grow consistently with traditional culture techniques. This is particularly true with B. henselae (Bh), which has only been isolated once from a dog. Currently, Bartonella presence in dogs is determined by serology and amplification of bacterial DNA in blood samples. The following study demonstrates that these methods may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect Bh infection in dogs, possibly because of low bacteria/mL of blood. By utilizing a pre-enrichment Bartonella alpha Proteobacteria growth medium (BAPGM) followed by real-time PCR (RT-PCR), dogs initially lacking serological and PCR evidence of Bh infection were found to be bacteremic. BAPGM is a modified insect growth media formulated by our laboratory to enhance the growth of alpha Proteobacteria, which includes all species of Bartonella. A convenience sample of serum and EDTA-anticoagulated blood submitted to the NCSU Vector Borne Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (VBDDL) between August and November 2004 was used in this prospective study. The only inclusion criterion was the attending clinician's request for Bartonella serology and/or PCR. Seven samples from dogs with endocarditis, polyarthritis, thrombocytopenia, cyclical fever and general malaise were tested. Serum from 5/7 patients was used for detection of Bh and B. vinsonii berkhoffii (Bvb) IgG antibodies using immunofluorescence assays (IFA). Concurrently, for all cases, one aliquot of EDTA anti-coagulated blood was used for RT-PCR targeting the Bartonella 16S-23S intergenic spacer region. A second aliquot was inoculated into BAPGM and maintained at 35\u040aC for seven days, at which time an aliquot was sub-inoculated onto blood agar plates and another aliquot was again processed for RT-PCR. If bacterial growth was obtained on the plate, colonies were cloned and sequenced. Bh IFA titers ranged from undetectable to 1:1024. All seven samples tested negative for Bartonella spp. DNA when initially screened by RT-PCR. After seven days of pre-enrichment, 4/7 samples were RT-PCR positive for Bartonella spp. DNA. Bacterial colonies grew from only these four pre-enrichment samples following sub-inoculation. Based upon DNA sequencing, two isolates were Bh, whereas the molecular identification of two isolates is pending. In only 3/5 dogs did the evidence for exposure to Bh or Bvb via serum titers correlate with the RT-PCR results post enrichment.",

Chamber contents were then fed to each of the two Mhm-na\u00efve cats as follows: one cat was fed 93 viable fleas (43 female, 50 male) and 0.274 gram of flea by-products, including feces, larvae and eggs. The other cat was fed 90 viable fleas (41 female, 49 male) and 0.354 gram of flea by-products. These items were mixed into 71 grams of a commercially available chicken-based human baby food to facilitate feeding.",

Prior to the development of PCR assays for the amplification of DNA of M. haemofelis (Mhf) or Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum (Mhm) from blood, prevalence studies were based on cytology. Since PCR assays are generally more sensitive than cytology, it cannot be determined whether prevalence rates of Mhf or Mhm have changed over time. While our laboratory has thousands of stored feline serum samples, prior to PCR assay development, blood was generally not saved. Since Mhf and Mhm can disassociate from the surface of red blood cells, we hypothesized in this study that organismal DNA could be amplified from serum of infected cats by use of a currently available PCR assay.",

Since its introduction in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has become endemic in the U.S. This mosquito-borne virus causes serious, and often fatal, disease in several animal species, including humans. The prevalence of WNV and risk for exposure is monitored by detection of infection in sentinel animals. Prior to availability of a vaccine, horses served as sensitive sentinels for WNV prevalence because of high risk of mosquito exposure, susceptibility to virus infection, easy serological detection of infection, and close proximity to humans. Widespread vaccination has confounded serological identification of infected horses, so other species that live in close proximity to humans and other at-risk populations should be evaluated as sentinels. Since unowned free-roaming (feral) cats have a high risk of vector exposure and live in close proximity to humans and their companion animals, they may be a suitable sentinel species for WNV surveillance and prediction of exposure risks. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of WNV in feral cats in Alachua County in north central Florida, and to identify risk factors that predispose feral cats to WNV infection.",

Uveitis, defined as inflammation of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid, is a clinical ophthalmologic condition noted commonly in the cat. Feline uveitis has many causes; a clinical diagnosis of feline idiopathic uveitis is generally made if there is no systemic or ophthalmic explanation for the ocular inflammation. In these cases, lymphocytic-plasmacytic inflammatory cell infiltrates are usually detected histopathologically, suggesting an immune-mediated process. In humans, vaccinations have been linked to several suspected immune-mediated conditions including thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and uveitis. In dogs, vaccinations have been associated with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, and corneal edema.

There are no reports documenting the cause of these acute respiratory disease outbreaks in racing greyhounds. The objective of this work was to identify the etiological agent(s) involved in the January and June 2004 outbreaks.",

The normal intestinal bacterial flora in dogs has not been well defined. Previous studies have focused on the enumeration and identification of bacterial species by direct culture of intestinal content. Recently, it has been recognized that the majority of microbial species cannot be identified using standard culture techniques. Reasons for this inability to culture many bacterial species include non-viable or stressed microorganisms, obligate requirements for coexisting flora or host-derived products, bias due to selectivity of culture media, and a lack of knowledge regarding essential nutrients for some bacterial species. Thus, a culture-dependent approach may underestimate the bacterial diversity of complex microbial communities such as those found in the intestinal tract. The aim of this study was to describe the intestinal microflora in healthy dogs by direct sequence analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA; gene encoding 16S ribosomal RNA).",

Furthermore, two thirds of the cats investigated had hypoalbuminemia. These data would suggest that, in contrast to common clinical impressions, chronic gastrointestinal disease can be associated with gastrointestinal protein loss in the cat. Cats with hyperthyroidism commonly show vomiting and/or diarrhea, which are believed to be clinical signs due to direct effects of thyroid hormones on the gastrointestinal tract. However, signs of gastrointestinal disease do not resolve in some cats after 131 I treatment. The goal of this study was to objectively assess intestinal function in cats with hyperthyroidism by measuring serum concentrations of cobalamin and folate.",

Also, serum folate concentrations were either decreased or in the low end of the reference range in 61.5% of hyperthyroid cats evaluated in this study. These findings suggest the presence of significant malabsorption of both cobalamin and folate in cats with hyperthyroidism, although hypermetabolsim may lead to increased vitamin requirements. Hyperthyroidism may directly or indirectly lead to vitamin malabsorption, or some hyperthyroid cats may have concurrent small intestinal disease. Whatever the mechanism, concurrent intestinal dysfunction and vitamin deficiencies appear to be common in hyperthyroid cats. is a valuable tool that enables the identification and collection of specific individual cells from heterogeneous tissues or cultured cells with submicrometer precision through the process of laser microdissection. Although the laser microdissection is a powerful and advanced technique, the precision of cutting and collecting micro-sized areas from tissue or cultured cells yields only a small amount of total RNA (pico-to nanogram) that is generally not sufficient for analysis of gene expression (e.g. Northern Blot, Microarrays). The focus of research in our laboratory is the innate immune defense mechanisms of intestinal epithelial cells. A major barrier of canine enterocyte gene expression analysis has, however, traditionally been the significant challenge in culturing these cells. The goal of this study was twofold: 1) Develop a rapid and precise method to collect a target group of cells from a specific tissue of interest, and 2) Expand minuscule amounts of RNA isolated from these cells to obtain enough material (i.e. micrograms) for gene expression analysis. A primary cell micro-culture of canine jejunal enterocytes was used for the microdissection technique. Canine enterocytes from adult beagles were seeded onto a P.A.L.M. LPC-membrane slide located at the bottom of a sterile Petri dish filled with supplemented culture media and allowed to attach for three hours at 37\u040aC, 5% CO 2 . After 24 hours the cells were switched to 34\u040aC, 5% CO 2 to delay differentiation. Once clusters of attached cells covered the membrane, the slide was removed from the Petri dish and immediately fixed in 100% ethanol for three minutes at \u03ea20\u040aC and then transferred for laser micro-dissection. The slide was then transferred to the P.A.L.M. MicroBeam System for micro-dissection and pressure catapulting spending less than 15 minutes on this step of the procedure to reduce RNA degradation. Groups of enterocytes were microdissected using a 20\u03eb objective and catapulted into a cap (positioned directly above the collection site) containing 35l of lysis buffer to protect the RNA from degradation. The cap was removed and placed on ice for total RNA isolation using the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIA-GEN) and manufacturer's protocol. An amount of 20ng total RNA was isolated from the microdissected enterocytes and then amplified via MessengerAmp II aRNA Kit (Ambion). This novel and crucial in vitro transcription technique allowed us to amplify the extracted RNA up to 2,000 fold, thus enabling complete analysis of canine enterocyte gene expression via Microarray and Northern Blot studies. Our findings suggest that the combination of the described newfangled molecular techniques has the potential of becoming a revolutionary tool in gene expression studies of not only canine enterocytes, but also of numerous other types of cell lines. The purpose of the study was to confirm that dogs with megaoesophagus due to myasthenia gravis (MG) display less oesophageal dilatation radiographically than those with megaoesophagus due to other causes.",

Radiographs were examined without knowledge of final diagnosis. Correlation of thoracic inlet size (in mm) with weight and body surface area was evaluated with Pearson's correlation coefficient and maximum oesophageal diameter (in mm) was transformed to a 'relative oesophageal diameter' (ROD) by use of a ratio with thoracic inlet size. The dogs were divided into two groups according to 'MG' or 'non-MG' status and nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney, Kruskal Wallis, Spearman rank correlation coefficient) were used to compare median ROD values between groups and to evaluate the relationship between ROD and age, weight and sex. A P value of \u03fd0.05 was considered significant. Breed-specific risk of MG was calculated using an Odds Ratio from the study population where there were a minimum of five dogs from one breed.

Median values of ROD for the MG and non-MG groups were 0.58 and 0.66 respectively and a statistically significant difference between the two groups was shown (P \u03ed 0.029). There was no association between ROD and sex, age or weight. An increased odds ratio for MG existed in Golden retrievers and German Shepherd Dogs. ROC calculations showed an optimum cut-off value for ROD of 0.652 (sensitivity 80%, specificity 52%) in distinguishing MG from non-MG dogs with megaoesophagus. Dogs with megaoesophagus due to MG in this study had a significantly lower relative oesophageal diameter than those dogs with megaoesophagus due to other causes. A single radiographic measurement ratio between maximum oesophageal diameter and thoracic inlet size may help distinguish dogs with megaoesophagus due to MG from those with other diseases. Over the last decade many motility disorders have been described in human patients. However, little is known about motility disorders in dogs. This may be due, in part, to a lack of simple diagnostic modalities for assessment of gastrointestinal motility. Recently, use of a 13 C-octanoic acid breath test for estimation of gastric emptying (strictly duodenal filling), in dogs and horses has been reported. Also, a 13 C-lactose ureide breath test has been used to estimate oro-cecal transit time in humans. The goal of this study was to study a combined 13 Coctanoic acid and 13 C-lactose ureide blood test in healthy dogs before and after 4 weeks of tylosin (TL) administration.",

Horses with murmurs and no arrhythmias (n \u03ed 3) included tricuspid insufficiency (0.05), mitral insufficiency (0.07), and aortic insufficiency (0.02). One foal with an atrial septal defect and signs of congestive heart failure had cTnI of 0.53 ng/ml. Horses with ventricular arrhythmias (VPCs or ventricular tachycardia) and documentable toxicities (n \u03ed 5) had cTnI of 0.05, 0.21, 0.31, 15.18, and \u03fe100 ng/ml. Toxicities included Streptococcal myositis (n \u03ed 3), white snakeroot poisoning (n \u03ed 1) and red maple leaf exposure (n \u03ed 1). Horses with ventricular arrhythmias but no documentation of myocardial toxicity (n \u03ed 3) had cTnI of 0.34, 0.46, and 80.42 ng/ml. It was concluded that horses with myocardial toxicities and ventricular arrhythmias often had severe elevations in plasma cTnI, with concentrations decreasing gradually as the cardiac arrhythmias diminished in frequency and character. Horses with more benign conditions such as uncomplicated valvular insufficiencies or atrial fibrillation also often had cTnI falling outside the normal range, but these were not nearly as elevated as in horses with ventricular arrhythmias. Equine pars intermedia pituitary adenoma (PIPA) is often characterized by a paradox: high concentration of plasma ACTH (\u03e910-fold) concurrent with normal concentrations of cortisol. Dogs, cats, and ferrets exhibiting clinical signs of Cushing's with normal cortisol concentrations and increased adrenal intermediate steroids are considered to have aberrant or atypical Cushing's syndrome. Atypical Cushing's syndrome has been reported in dogs, cats, and ferrets and opens the possibility that steroid intermediate imbalances may be present in horses with Cushing's. The objective of this work was to initiate a database of reference values for the adrenal steroids progesterone (P), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), androstenedione (ANDRO), cortisol (C), and aldosterone (ALD), and the sex steroids testosterone (T) and estradiol (E), during dexamethasone (Dx) suppression and after TRH and ACTH stimulation.",

TRH did not stimulate secretion of any steroids; ACTH stimulated secretion of 17-OHP (1.5-fold), ANDRO (2.2-fold), and C (3.5-fold). This data provides for the first time comprehensive information on blood steroid levels in horses. The study of the effect of PIPA on adrenal steroid profiles is underway and intermediate steroid hormones are expected to have diagnostic value. Aberrant or atypical Cushing's syndrome is a condition in which plasma concentration of cortisol is normal, however clinical signs of hypercortisolism persist. Cortisol biosynthesis intermediates are known to have intrinsic glucocorticoid activity and cause atypical Cushing's in dogs, cats, ferrets, and humans, when cortisol concentration is normal. Equine Cushing's disease or pars intermedia pituitary adenoma (PIPA) is characterized by a paradox: high concentration of plasma ACTH, normal level of plasma cortisol, and clinical signs of hypercortisolism. Often steroid biosynthesis imbalances are expressed under ACTH stimulation or dexamethasone (Dx) suppression, not in resting or baseline conditions. The objective of this research was to optimize the ACTH dose-response relationship in horses undergoing dexamethasone suppression for the purpose of further development of testing protocols for equine Cushing's disease based on intermediate steroid analysis. Twenty-four horses divided into eight groups of three each were used. A Combined Dx suppression/ACTH stimulation test protocol was used. Blood samples were collected at 0-time; then, Dx (40 g/kg, IM) was injected and blood collected at three hours; then, ACTH (Cortrosyn) (various dosages 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, 60, 125, 250 g/horse, IV) was injected and blood collected at 0-time, 60, 120, 180, and 240 minutes.

There was a linear (r \u03ed 0.87) ACTH dose-response relationship until the 60 g ACTH dose. Horses were highly sensitive to ACTH injection, since the smallest dose of 2.0 g/horse caused a cortisol net gain (P \u03fd 0.05) of 10 ng/ml at 60 minutes. A dose of 60 g/horse maximally stimulated adrenal glands and caused a cortisol gain (P \u03fd 0.05) of 85ng/ml at 60 min., then, cortisol concentrations declined linearly (r \u03ed \u03ea0.93). Duration of ACTH effect was directly correlated (r \u03ed 0.97) to dose size. At 240 minutes, concentrations of cortisol were still 60%, 40%, 36%, 9% and 9% above baseline value (250 g, 125 g, 60 g, 20 g and 10 g dose, respectively). ACTH response was similar (P \u03ed 0.05) in the group of nine horses, with and without Dx suppression. It was concluded maximal diagnostic stimulation of cortisol can be attained with 60 g Cortrosyn/horse, which is significantly less than what is reported in the literature. The above provides a basis for exploring the usefulness of combined testing and steroidal panel analysis in the diagnosis of equine Cushing's disease. Equine Cushing's disease (ECD) results from hypertrophy, hyperplasia or a functional adenoma in the pars intermedia of the pituitary gland and is frequently recognized in older horses. Recently, a combined dexamethasone suppression/ thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation (DEX/TRH) test was introduced to diagnose ECD, but this test has not been validated. The purpose of this study was to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the test for the diagnosis of ECD by comparing test results with histopathologic findings.",

Approximately 10% of horses suffer a bout of colic each year with 0.7% of the cases resulting in death, indicating colic is a serious disease syndrome in horses. Much of the mortality is associated with ischemic-injured intestine during strangulating obstruction, yet there is limited understanding of the molecular events associated with ischemic injury of the intestinal epithelium. Identification of differentially expressed genes during ischemic injury will expand our understanding of colic and may lead to novel targeted therapeutics in the future. The objective of this study was to isolate and identify differentially expressed genes in equine jejunum following a two-hour ischemic event compared to normally perfused jejunum. We utilized Suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH-PCR) to clone genes that are differentially expressed between equine jejunum injured by two hours of complete ischemia as compared to time-matched control jejunal tissues. Our method is based on the PCR-select (Clonetech Lab, Inc.). Positive clones from each subtracted cDNA population were selected for sequencing and BLAST analysis.

Duodenitis proximal enteritis (DPJ) is an acute sporadic syndrome in horses characterized by inflammation and edema of the duodenum and jejunum. The cause of this disease remains unknown, however, clostridia, Salmonella spp and mycotoxins have been suggested as being the initiating cause.

Mean intragastric pH was not significantly different between the three groups for the first hour. There was a statistically significant increase in mean hourly pH relative to untreated foals during hours 2-24 after IV or IG pantoprazole administration.

However, further studies are required to investigate the use of this drug in critically ill patients. Intragastrically administered pantoprazole had poor bioavailability, but administration by this route also caused a significant, prolonged elevation of intragastric pH versus untreated foals.

Resting neutrophils were isolated from ice-cold heparinized blood, at 4\u040aC as follows: (i) by dextran (1.5% wt)-facilitated rouleaux of erythrocytes, (ii) recovery of leukocytes from plasma (250 \u03eb g, 10 min) (iii) selective pelleting of neutrophils and monocytes by centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque (400 \u03eb g, 20 min), (iv) selective banding of neutrophils by centrifugation of the resuspended pellet over 90% Percoll (60,000 \u03eb g, 40 min). The majority (\u03fe95%) of isolated cells had the characteristic nuclear morphology of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and no discernable intracellular reactive oxygen intermediates as determined by staining with DCFH-DA dye (the fluorescent intensity of which is elevated in the presence of H 2 O 2 ). Isolated resting neutrophils strongly expressed EqCD44 and EqMHC Class I, expressed EqCD11a/18 at an intermediate level, and weakly expressed EqCD13 as determined by staining with mAb. The resting neutrophils did not express EqMCH Class II or lymphocyte-associated differentiation antigens namely, EqCD4, EqCD5 or EqCD8. Resting equine blood monocytes/macrophages expressed EqMHC Class II as well as CD13, while resting equine blood lymphocytes did not express EqCD13. Purified equine blood neutrophils retained their resting phenotype when incubated for 2 hours at 37\u040aC and at a density of \u03fd10 6 cells/ml medium in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5 mg bovine serum albumin (BSA)/ml and in ''Costar'' culture-ware that was pre-coated with BSA.

Equine serum activated the neutrophils only to a minor degree in the absence of LPS, whereas activation of equine neutrophils by LPS was significantly reduced in the absence of serum (consistent with a role for serum LPS-binding protein). Irrespective of the method of activation, activated equine neutrophils exhibited: 1) uniform, intense staining with DCFH-DA dye indicating that the cells had mounted a respiratory burst, and 2) an elevated level of the aminopeptidase EqCD13 in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface in approximately 60% of the cells resulting in clear biphasic staining of the population. The distribution of EqCD13 was punctate on resting and activated neutrophils, suggesting a raft-distribution; activation was associated with coalescing of the putative EqCD13\u03e9 rafts into larger aggregates.",

The objective of this study was to compare the innate immune response of foals to the intracellular pathogen R. equi with that of their adult Dams. Two in vitro cell culture systems were used. Primary alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), differentiated from peripheral blood mononuclear progenitors, were infected with a virulent strain of R. equi (33701\u03e9) and its isogenic, avirulent plasmid-cured pair (33701\u03ea). Total RNA was reverse transcribed and real time RT-PCR (TaqMan) was used to quantify mRNA transcripts for pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines. Infection of alveolar macrophages with R. equi induced the up-regulation of IL-1\u2424, IL-6, IL-8, IL12p40 and TNF-\u2423. When compared to their adult dams, foals showed a significantly smaller magnitude up-regulation of IL-6 and IL-8 at six hours and a significantly larger magnitude up-regulation of IL-12p40 at 24 hours. The presence of bioactive TNF-\u2423 was confirmed by bioassay using WEHI-13VAR cells as early as six hours after infection. In contrast to the observed up-regulation of several cytokines, infection with R. equi resulted in a dramatic decrease in transcription of natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1) in foals and adults. Infection of equine DCs induced variable upregulation of IL-1\u2424, 1L-6, IL-8, IL-12p40 and TNF-\u2423 in foals and adults. Detection of bioactive TNF-\u2423 in DC culture supernatants six and 24 hours after infection confirmed secretion of this cytokine by R. equi infected DCs. Suppressive subtractive hybridization was performed using mRNA from R. equi infected and uninfected alveolar macrophages from foals and adults and 30 genes were found to be differentially expressed. Differentially expressed genes were from a number of gene families including chemokines, endosome/lysosome trafficking, SLAM family (activating receptors) and STATs (signal transducer and activator of transcription).",

Moreover, differences in IL-12 synthetic capacity were observed among the different cell types. Most strikingly, lower levels of IL-12 p40 were detected in stimulated juvenile PBMC compared with adult PBMC. However, in vitro-derived juvenile DC were functionally capable of generating IL-12 p40 to the same level as adults. These results suggest foals may have a deficiency in the number and/or function of DC that predisposes them to devel-opment of disease caused by intracellular pathogens. Also, our data suggest that the in vivo functional deficit may be overcome by propagating DC in vitro. More studies are needed to further characterize these differences. Sepsis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in newborn foals. Several studies have documented a positive correlation between failure of passive transfer of immunity (FPT) and bacterial sepsis in foals. FPT is typically defined as serum IgG concentrations of less than 400 mg/dl after 24 h of age whereas partial FPT is defined as serum IgG concentrations between 400 and 800 mg/dl.

Guttural pouch mycosis is a well-known disease in horses that can lead to devastating consequences due to uncontrollable haemorrhage. Several surgical treatments have been described to treat successfully the disease. However, these treatments are sometimes expensive and may involve radiation exposure for the surgeons and for the clinical staff. Moreover, in the case of neurological damage, the neurologic deficits seldom fully recover after surgery. The purpose of this case series was to demonstrate the efficacy of a medical treatment for guttural pouch mycosis when surgery in not an option.",

Two horses (horses 1 and 2) were presented for mild unilateral bleeding. The other two horses (horses 3 and 4) were presented only for dysphagia, but displayed other subtler neurological deficits. Horse 3 had a unilateral lesion, in horse 4 both pouches were involved. None of these cases were surgical candidates, mainly for financial concerns. The owners were warned of the risk of life threatening haemorrhages, but elected for an attempt with a medical treatment. Treatment consisted in daily administration of miconazole in the affected pouch during one week, followed by every other day administration during the following two weeks. On Horses 3 and 4, twice a week administrations were performed for three more weeks. The administration were performed under endoscopic control, using a equine female urinary catheter, mild sedation was required. The pouches were endoscopicaly assessed prior treatment and after treatment except for Horse 1 that was not re-examined post treatment due resolution of clinical signs and lack of compliance of the owner. Horses 1 and 2 were treated with a diluted solution from the injectable form (70 mg of miconazole diluted with isotonic saline to reach a 10 ml volume for each treatment) the dosage was minimized due to the cost of the injectable form. Horses 3 and 4 were treated with gynaecological preparation of miconazole (400 mg per treatment) administration of the ointment through the catheter was facilitated by warming the filled syringe in warm water. This molecule was chosen because of a good activity against Candida spp and Aspergillus fumigatus, the later being a very common cause of guttural pouch mycosis.",

An 18 gauge catheter was place in the median artery of this limb using ultrasonographic guidance. A CT image was obtained at the same location every other second for 90 seconds before, during and after intra-arterial iodinated contrast administration. Contrast material was administered into the artery for a total of 30 seconds (3mL/sec) beginning five seconds after image acquisition. After the images were acquired the horses were recovered in a routine fashion. Automated software was used to evaluate these images and develop a time density curve for an artery within the image, the dorsolateral, dorsal and dorsomedial lamina. Density measured in Hounsfeld units has a linear relationship with iodine concentration in tissue, therefore, the Patlak equation using the arterial input function can be used to calculate the perfusion and the vascular permeability in mL/min/mL for each of the specified areas of interest.",

Alterations in blood supply to the foot, including arteriovenous anastomoses, regional perfusion deficits are implicated in different disease processes and may play a role in the development and propagation of laminitis in the horse. There is significant variability in the values obtained in this study that may be in part due to blood pressure changes under anesthesia and the normal vascular physiology of the foot. Further investigation of this technique in horses with laminitis may show a significant variation from the above stated normal values which may have both clinical and research applications. Acyclovir is virustatic drug commonly employed in treatment of alpha-herpes virus infections in humans and some veterinary species. Equine herpes myelencephalopathy (EHM) results from infection of horses with equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1), an alpha-herpes virus, and preliminary investigation of EHV-1 isolates from recent EHM outbreaks suggest that: (1) EHV-1 is sensitive to acyclovir and (2) acyclovir may be a rational therapy for the treatment of EHM.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that glucose delivery from the gastrointestinal tract limits the rate of muscle glycogen storage in horses when carbohydrate is administered during the early postexercise period. Specifically, we predicted that muscle glycogen storage would be enhanced when glucose was administered IV but not when an equivalent glucose dose was given orally. In a randomized crossover design, seven mature horses completed a twohour bout of treadmill exercise on three occasions to deplete muscle glycogen by \u03f350%.

Mean values and average interday CV for Sg and AIRg calculated from the 12-sample data set were similar to corresponding values derived from the complete data set. However, the ICC for repeat determinations of Sg was lower for the 12-sample (0.22) when compared to the 30-sample (0.55) data set. It is concluded that minimal model analysis of the insulin-modified FSIGT provides repeatable estimates of insulin sensitivity and glucose dynamics in healthy horses. However, the repeatability of Si estimates is greatly reduced when the FSIGT protocol is simplified by decreasing the number of samples to 12.

A second objective was to determine which measure(s) of glucose and insulin obtained at rest or during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the strongest correlate of insulin sensitivity measured directly using the EC. The EC, FSIGT and OGTT were administered in all horses with a minimum of three days between procedures. The ratio of glucose infusion rate to mean serum insulin (M/I) was the measure of insulin sensitivity in the EC. For the FSIGT, insulin sensitivity (Si) was quantified by the variation in glucose disappearance rate due to unitary increases in insulin. Minimal model analysis also yielded AIRg, the acute (0-10 min) insulin response to glucose, and an estimate of glucose-mediated glucose disposal (Sg). Area under the glucose (AUCg) and insulin (AUCin) curves, the product of AUCg and AUCin, and the sum of the insulin to glucose ratios (Sum I/G) were calculated from the OGTT. From resting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI; 1/ [log glucose \u03e9 log insulin]) and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA \u03ed glucose \u03eb insulin/22.5) were calculated.

This difference was statistically significant (p \u03fd 0.05). The median [BNP] in dogs with sub-clinical heart disease was 3.03 \u03e9 7.59 pg/ml. Normal healthy dogs with no evidence of heart disease had a median [BNP] of 0.96 \u03e9 1.53 pg/ml. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve when [BNP] was used to differentiate CHF from other causes of cough/dyspnea was 0.91. In conclusion, this canine ELISA [BNP] assay was helpful in the diagnosis of CHF in dogs presenting with cough or dyspnea. ABSTRACT #68 EVALUATION OF A NEW BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE ASSAY IN DOGS.

Infectious diseases transmitted by ticks and other vectors are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in both dogs and people throughout North America. While numerous studies have described the prevalence and geographic distribution of tick-transmitted diseases throughout the United States, little comparable information is available on the veterinary importance of these diseases in Canada. The purpose of this study is to describe the seroprevalence of vectortransmitted diseases in Canada based on samples submitted to the Vector Borne Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (VBDDL) at the North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine. All available serum samples from southeastern Canadian dogs submitted to the VBDDL between August 9, 2000 and September 19, 2003 were included in the study. Serology for E. canis,R. rickettsii, B. canis, B. vinsonii berkhoffii, B.  burgdorferi, A. phagocytophilum, and B.  hensalae was determined by IFA. B. burgdorferi serology was performed using a commercially available test (SNAP 3Dx, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.). Information regarding breed and the city or province from which the sample originated was recorded; however, travel history was unknown for the majority of dogs.A total of 288 samples were submitted to the VBDDL from southeastern Canada throughout the period of study; serologic results are shown in the table below.",

            "text": "The use of human recombinant alpha Interferon (rHuIFN-\u2423) and of recombinant feline omega Interferon (rFeIFN-) have been reported for treatment of FHV-1 in cats. Minimal data is available concerning the efficacy of these treatments. Recombinant HuIFN-\u2423 and rFeIFN-are type I interferons, which act as mediators of the innate (nonspecific) immune response. Anti-proliferative and immune modulating properties, and direct antiviral effect are considered major functions of type I IFN. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antiviral efficacy and to compare the inhibitory effects of rFeIFN-(Virbagen Omega) and rHuIFN-\u24232b (Intron-A) on FHV-1 replication in vitro. Viral titers were assessed by plaque reduction assay. Briefly, confluent monolayers of Crandell feline kidney cells in 24-well culture plates were treated with either rFeIFN-or rHuIFN-\u24232b over concentrations ranging from 100U/ml to 500,000U/ml. A reduction in the number and size of plaques were used as indicators of antiviral activity. Assays were performed in duplicate and repeated. An MTT assay of cellular enzyme function was used to exclude possible cytotoxic effects of IFN that could confound interpretation of the antiviral effects. A one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's test were performed to assess the significance of the data.A significant reduction in plaque number was observed for rFeIFN-at 100,000U/ml (54.7%) and at 500,000U/ml (59.8%) (p \u03fd 0.05). Plaque size was significantly reduced by 47.5% at 100,000U/ml, by 81% at 250,000U/ml and by 70.5% at 500,000U/ml (p \u03fd 0.05) rFeIFN. Recombinant HuIFN-\u24232b treatments did not produce any significant reduction in the number of plaque. However, significant reduction in plaque sizes was measured 56% at 100,000U/ml, by 75.7% at 250,000U/ml and by 69% at 500,000U/ml (p \u03fd 0.05). None of the high-dose treatments of either interferon caused significant cellular toxicity in the MTT assay (p \u03fd 0.05).Both interferons were shown to have anti-FHV-1 effects at high concentrations. Treatment with rFeIFN-was more effective than treatment with rHuIFN-\u24232b. The results showed for the first time that antiviral efficacy for interferon can also be measured in terms of a reduction of plaque sizes indicating the ability to inhibit viral cell-to-cell spread. This ability may be relevant for clinical applications such as the topical treatment of FHV-1. Chlamydophila felis is a common cause of conjunctivitis in the cat but little is known about the immune response to infection. Cytokines are known to play an important role in mucosal humoral and cell mediated immunity. A pilot study was performed to assess if it was feasible to detect mRNA encoding feline cytokines on ocular swabs taken from cats infected with C. felis. Quantification of cytokines using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was then performed to detect trends in cytokine levels before and during infection.",

            "text": "Eight specific-pathogen-free cats were bilaterally inoculated with 3 \u03eb 10 3 units of a field isolate of C. felis onto the conjunctiva (day 0). Conjunctival swabs were taken at regular intervals prior to infection and following infection. Four cats were followed for 11 days post-infection (dpi), 1 cat for 35 dpi and 3 cats until day 42 dpi.Following extraction of RNA from the conjunctival swabs, reverse transcriptase real-time PCR was performed using gene specific primers and probes for G3PDH and IL-2, \u03ea4, \u03ea5, \u03ea6, \u03ea10, \u03ea12p35, \u03ea12p40 and \u03ea18, TNF\u2423, TGF\u2424 and IFN\u2425 mRNA.All swabs were positive for G3PDH mRNA. The amount of mRNA present for each cytokine was quantified relative to the amount of G3PDH mRNA on the same swab. Each swab was then assigned a relative copy number (RCN) for each cytokine and trends in RCNs observed.IL-2, IL-6, TGF\u2424 and IFN\u2425 were undetectable in most cats prior to infection. RCNs of these cytokines increased and peaked at 4-14 dpi. IL-2, IL-6 and IFN\u2425 levels then decreased by 10-1000 fold, and in some cats IL-2 and IL-6 became undetectable once more. However, TGF\u2424 RCNs tended to remain high, close to peak levels. IL-4 was intermittently detected in three cats prior to infection, and post infection only low RCNs were detected in seven cats. IL-12p40 and TNF\u2423 were intermittently detectable in all cats prior to infection, and IL-10 was detectable in four cats prior to infection. Following infection RCNs of these three cytokines increased by 10-10000 fold or more, peaking at 7-11 dpi. Thereafter, the RCNs decreased by 10-1000 fold and remained at approximately 10-100 fold higher than prior to infection. IL-5, IL-12p35 and IL-18 were frequently detected in most cats prior to infection, and rapidly returned to similar RCNs after peaking approximately 10-1000 fold higher a 4-7dpi.This study demonstrates that it is possible to detect mRNA encoding feline cytokines from ocular swabs from cats using real-time RT-PCR. General trends in cytokine responses following C. felis infection were observed. This study prospectively compared in vitro resistance and potential efficacy of five fluorinated quinolones (FQ) toward aerobic canine or feline isolates (n \u03ed 246) submitted to diagnostic laboratories. Microtube dilution was implemented at concentrations ranging from 0.03125 to 32 g/ml. Drugs studied were (dose mg/kg) ciprofloxacin (CIP; 5-20), enrofloxacin (ENR; 5-20), difloxacin (DIF; 5-10), marbofloxacin (MAR; 2.5-5) and orbifloxacin (ORB; 2.5-7.5). Percent resistance of each organism to each FQ and pharmacodynamic indices were determined. Potency was measured as MIC 50 or MIC 90 and susceptibility as inhibitory quotient (IQ), defined as peak plasma drug concentration at the low or high dose of each FQ to MIC mean (mean is the geometric mean). The organisms most commonly cultured and % resistant to all FQ were, for Gram negative (GN; n \u03ed 180; 20 \u03ee 3%), Eschericia coli (n \u03ed 61; 39 \u03ee 5%; at least 55% from the urine), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n \u03ed 58; 16 \u03ee 3%), and Gram positive (GP; n \u03ed 66; 17 \u03ee 3%), Staphylococcus sp (n \u03ed 17; 2 \u03ee 1%) including Staphylococcus intermedius (n \u03ed 19; 6 \u03ee 5%) and Streptococcocus (n \u03ed 20; 17 \u03ee 10%). Percent resistance did not differ among the FQ for any organism. For GN, the MIC mean and MIC 50 , but not MIC 90 , were lower than the breakpoint (MIC BP ) of each drug for all organisms. In general, potency for GN was ranked as CIP \u0546 ENR \u0546 MAR \u0546 DIF \u0546 ORB. However, the susceptibility (magnitude of IQ) was ENR \u0546 CIP \u0546 MAR \u0546 ORB \u0546 DIF. An IQ of 10 was achieved at the low dose only for ENR and MAR and only against Proteus. At the high dose, an IQ of 10 was achieved by ENR for all drugs and by DIF and ORB for none. For GP, potency was CIP \u0546 ENR \u03ed MAR \u0546 DIF \u0546 ORB. However, the magnitude of IQ were ENR \u0546 CIP \u0546 MAR \u03fe ORB \u03fe DIF. Only ENR was able to achieve an IQ of 10 for GP organisms although CIP could for S. intermedius. This study of a limited number of organisms demonstrates ENR is the FQ most able to achieve targeted IQ for concentration dependent drugs and that the high dose of any FQ may be the more prudent dose for susceptible organisms. The use of generic CIP may not meet judicious antimicrobial use guidelines.",
