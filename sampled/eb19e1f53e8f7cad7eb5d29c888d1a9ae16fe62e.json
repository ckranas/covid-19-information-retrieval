The human PIF1 shares 31%, 30% and 86% homologies in DNA sequences with S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and mouse PIF1, respectively and is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. Human PIF1 protein is exclusively expressed in the nucleus and dose not show distinct changes in its distribution upon DNA damage.

The overexpression of human PIF1 in the S. cerevisiae Pif1 strain reduced the enhanced GCR rate by about half, although the lengthened telomere size was not restored. The reduced expression of human PIF1 by shRNA increased telomere size in general. However, there was an increase of breakage of chromosomes followed by short telomere sequence addition similar to what observed in yeast de novo telomere addition. Lastly, we found a homozygous mutation and three polymorphisms in the human PIF1 gene by sequence analysis of 113 cancer cell lines and 411 normal control populations.

We demonstrate that ALT is unexpectedly characterized by increased pericentromeric instability leading to spontaneous emergence of mitotically functional human neo-acrocentric chromosomes. Molecular and conventional cytogenetics in a panel of 10 telomerase positive and 5 ALT human cell lines showed that ALT recombination break-points were clustered at pericentromeric regions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, centromere specific and M-FISH, indicated that ALT neo-acrocentric chromosomes were mainly produced by true centromeric fissions. We focus on an interesting subgroup of ALT neo-acrocentric chromosomes, composed of DNA entities that are 2-5 times smaller in size than HSA21. These ALT minute chromosomes exhibit a two-chromatid structure, carry non-heterochromatic genomic DNA, centromeric and telomeric repeats, they associate with CENP-A, and display regular mitotic functionality. The frequencies of ALT minute chromosomes were elevated by clastogenic c-irradiation, and suppressed by reconstitution of telomerase activity or inhibition of the RAD50 and MRE11. Continuous growth after telomerase inhibition/depletion in two telomerase positive human cancer cell lines was followed by increased rates of telomeric sister chromatid recombination and the emergence of minute chromosomes. Together our data suggest that in the ALT pathway, pericentromeric instability, chromosomal Breakage/Fusion/Bridge cycles and stochastic recombinatorial telomere capping, are capable to generate in vitro mitotically functional human minute chromosomes.",

Mavrogonatou and D. Kletsas Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Ageing, Institute of Biology, National Centre For Scientific Research 'Demokritos', Athens, GREECE Nucleus pulposus intervertebral disc cells experience a broad range of physicochemical stimuli in their native environment including osmotic fluctuations. Here we show that hyperosmotic treatment reduced nucleus pulposus cells' proliferation by activating the G2 and G1 cell cycle checkpoints. p38 MAPK was found to participate in the manifestation of the G2 arrest under conditions of increased osmolality, since inhibition of its activity released the cells from G2 phase into mitosis. High osmolality resulted in the ATM-mediated phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15, the up-regulation of p21 WAF1 and the hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein in accordance to the observed G1 arrest. Furthermore, comet assay revealed the presence of DNA damage after hyperosmotic treatment, possibly attributed to the abrupt alterations in chromatin configuration observed early after exposure of the cells to this stress. Under these conditions, the MRN complex remained in the nucleus and H2A.X was phosphorylated on Ser139. In addition, nucleus pulposus cells residing within a hyperosmotic environment clearly retained their ability to sense newly introduced DNA damage, as confirmed by the re-activation of p53 by ionizing radiation. Even more, when the DNA repair efficiency of the cells was directly measured by a host cell reactivation of luciferase activity assay, it was found to be significantly increased under hyperosmotic pressure. Overall, our data provide the first evidence that high osmolality delays nucleus pulposus cells' proliferation and affects their DNA integrity triggering an enhanced DNA repair response.",

            "text": "Introduction: Male infertility is a common health problem. Microdeletions of the human Y chromosome (AZF region) are associated with spermatogenic failure. CFTR gene (chromosome 7) also is related to male infertility. In males without cystic fibrosis, mutations in CFTR gene phenotypicaly look like obstructive azoospermy, with results CBAVD -lack of vas deferens. The aims of our research were: to detect Y chromosomal microdeletions in AZF region, and to detect poly-T, poly-GT polymorphisms and delF508 mutation of CFRT gene in infertile male. Material and Methods: Objects for analysis were 79 individuals (DNA isolated from the blood cells) with different spermatogenic arrest and normal kariotype. Microdeletions in AZF region were determined by multiplex STS based PCR reactions. Mutation delF508 in CFTR gene was determined by appropriate PCR reaction. Polymorphisms poly-T and poly-GT were detected by sequencing. Results: Out of 79 analysed samples microdeletions were found in five cases (6%). Three of five patients had deletions of AZFc region and two had deletion of all three AZF regions. Mutation delF508 was not found in analysed 79 samples. Analysis of poly-T and poly GT polymorphisms in CFTR gene showed interesting results. In infertile males more common variant was 11GT/12GT heterozygous form. However, it does not give statistically valid interpretation. Conclusion: The frequency of Y-chromosomal microdeletions is low (6%) in Latvian infertile male population. Analysis of mutation delF508 and polymorphisms poly-T and poly-GT does not show correlation with infertility. However, Y chromosome microdeletion screening and CFTR gene analysis is important in case of genetic counselling. (1) . The function of human Par14 is still elusive. In consequence hereof, the theme of this work is devoted to unravel its sub-nuclear localisation and function. Methods and Results: On the basis of sequence similarity of Par14 to the well known mitotic regulator Pin1 and Par14's enrichment in the cellular nucleus with a dsDNA binding ability, Par14 has been posited to play a role in cell cycle regulation and chromatin remodelling. Different biochemical sub-nuclear fractionation methods were applied to study the localisation of the endogenous Par14 protein within the cellular nucleus. In an orthogonal approach, indirect immunofluorescence was used to establish the localisation of Par14 in polythene chromosomes. Immunoblots for the biochemical fractions revealed that Par14 was associated with both the nuclear matrix and chromatin with a higher affinity to the latter. In a similar light, chromosome bands were observed in polythene chromosomes. Conclusion: Taken together, these experiments show the sub-nuclear localisation of Par14. Proteins which are chromatin and/or nuclear matrix bound have been shown to be involved in a variety of DNAdependent activities such as transcription, replication, recombination, DNA-repair and genomic stability. The attachment between the two large architectural units of bacterial cell, the membrane and the nucleoid, is presumably brought about through RNA-protein bridges resulting from concurrent transcription/ translation and insertion of integral proteins into the membrane, the 'transertion' process. The transertion model proposes an evolutionary reasonable mechanism for DNA-membrane interaction and consequent membrane domain formation. The hyperfunction of this mechanism is its participation in spatio-temporal organization of the bacterial cell. Coupling between the first two points of the transertion was directly demonstrated by visualizing acting polysomes. The aim of this project is to test the transertion model regarding the nature of the connection between the nucleoid and the membrane in the third point. According to the model, membrane domains should be enriched with Sec translocation machinery proteins and their preferred phospholipids. Plasmids encoding fusions of green fluorescent protein (eGFP) with different components of the translocation machinery (SecA, SecY and SecE) were constructed. We observed a heterogenic localization of SecA-eGFP and eGFP-SecE fusion proteins in E. coli membrane. Examination of nucleoids released from such cells revealed regions of eGFP florescence attached to the nucleoid body. These regions presumably represent membrane patches enriched with SecA-eGFP, eGFP-SecE and eGFP-SecY. Our results confirm the existence of a continuous connection between the nucleoid and translocation complexes in the bacterial membrane through nascent mRNA and peptides.",

Burlibasa, O. Zarnescu and L. Gavrila University of Bucharest, Faculty of Biology, Bucharest, ROMANIA Spermatogenesis is an extreme case of chromatin reorganisation in somatic cells with a view to differentiating the respective germ line in highly differentiating gamete cells like spermatozoa. This structural dynamics is controlled both at the level of genetic information and at the one of epigenetic information (chemical modifications of chromatin components-DNA and histones). Our studies were focused on molecular architecture of chromatin during mouse spermatogenesis. The dynamics of histone H4 hypercetylation during spermatogenesis has been investigated. The transmission electron microscopy analysis, immunohistochemistry technique and specific molecular investigations were employed for deciphering some peculiar aspects of chromatin organization and evolution in spermatogenesis of Mus musculus . An increasing chromatin condensation in final stages of spermatogenesis has been encountered. Spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes and spermatids contained hyperacetylated H4, whereas no acetylated H4 was noticed in leptotene or pachytene spermatocytes. In order to gain an insight into mechanism cotrolling histone hyperacetylation during spermatogenesis we treated the mouse with Trichostatin A a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Ultrastructural and molecular analysis of the mouse testicular tissue after TSA treatment indicated a major chromatin remodelling in sperm nuclei, evidenced by chromatin decompactation and the absence of protamines and an obvious increase of histone acetylation in round spermatid. Thus, histone acetylation could be interpreted as an early signal of histone replacement by highly basic sperm-specific proteins a process tightly linked to nuclear condensation. Our investigations suggest that the regulation of histone deacetylase activity appears to play a major role in modulating histone hyperacetylation and perhaps histone replacement during spermiogenesis. Institute of Virology, 'Stefan S. Nicolau', Bucharest, ROMANIA, 2 'Coltea' Hospital, Bucharest, ROMANIA Introduction: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects nearly all humans and then persists for the life of the host. EBV has been associated with various types of cancer, including non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL and HL) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In the current study, we analyzed EBNA1 (EB viral nuclear antigen-1) gene expression and Cp promoter in different subtypes of NHL. Methods: Peripheral blood samples from 50 patients diagnosed with different types of NHL in 'Coltea' Hospital were collected. DNA was extracted and then EBV presence was investigated by EBNA1 gene expression using TaqMan real time PCR. We also studied the methylation status in the Cp region of EBNA1 gene using methylation specific PCR analysis in the same DNA samples. Results: Methylation of CpG is an important mechanism of promoter regulation and EBV latent gene expression. EBNA gene expression has been shown to be inversely correlated with the methylation status of the promoter Cp in 15 patients (30%) of the total NHL cases. Methylation may inhibit transcription by a number of mechanisms, either by direct blocking of the binding of transcription factors to DNA or through mediation of methyl-CpG-binding proteins, which recruit histone deacetylases to the DNA, leading to the remodeling of chromatin into an inactive configuration. Conclusions: Hypermethylation in the Cp region occurs in various degrees regardless of the phenotypic difference in NHL. So far, no differences are discernible between lymphoma types and further studies on a larger cohort of patients are required.",

Fleming, Athens, GREECE Set9 (KMT7) is a member of the SET domain-containing methyltransferases, that can specifically methylate lysine 4 residue of histone 3. Recent studies suggested that histones are not the sole substrates for Set9, implying that Set9-mediated transcriptional activation involves methylation of other proteins as well. The non-histone substrates for Set9 identified so far are TAF10 and p53. Set9-mediated methylation of TAF10 enhances its interaction with RNA pol-II at specific promoters, while methylation of p53 leads to an increased stability of the protein, which contributes to p53-mediated apoptosis. In this study we show that E2F-1, a key factor regulating S-phase specific as well as several apoptotic genes, is a bona fide substrate for Set9. Set9 monomethylates E2F1 at lysine 185 residue, located in the DNA-binding/DP heterodimerization domain, both in vitro and in vivo. We provide evidence that Set9 prevents DNA damage-induced accumulation of E2F-1. The results point to a novel role of Set9 in regulating E2F-1-induced p53-independent apoptosis.

Kouidou 1 1 Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, School of Medicine, Thessaloniki, GREECE, 2 Theageneion Anticancer Hospital, Thessaloniki, GREECE Introduction: Analysis of silent mutations in p53 sporadic mutation databases reveals that genetic instability in p53 is frequently related to the loss of methylation and exonic splicing-regulatory sequences. Furthermore, the presence of asymmetric non-CpG cytosine methylation in an oligoC sequence (codon 177) is also commonly detected in lung carcinomas. Methods and Results: We presently report that direct methylation sequencing analysis of 20 lung carcinomas shows frequent non-CpG methylation in CCs, CAs and CGCs in most lung carcinoma specimens but not in adjacent non-cancerous tissue; methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis of the same specimens also shows frequent presence of several asymmetric methylation sites in the vicinity of codon 133 (start codon of D133p53 isoform), (sequences 131-137, and 141-147) in addition to methylation in codon 177 (sequences 176-178). RT-PCR analysis reveals correlation of methylation in codons 177 and 133 with truncated p53 transcripts missing exon 5 and carrying frequent C > T transcriptional single base aberrations at CCs and CAs as well as A > T transversions at CAs in all carcinomas tested. Analysis of the p53 sporadic mutation databases reveals that the C > T mutation distribution in sporadic cancers is related to the loss of SC35 splicing protein binding sites (p = 0.194), while computational evaluation of germline mutations shows that the same aberrations (i.e. splice-site introducing mutations in codon 257) are frequent in the Li Fraumeni, cancer-related syndrome. Conclusion: Non-CpG epigenetic modifications of p53 in lung carcinomas is probably associated with the frequently observed C > T transcriptional aberrations resulting in splicing anomalies.",

The Xist RNA is thought to recruit specific protein partners which are responsible for the transcriptional silencing of the genes on the inactive X chromosome. Genetic evidence has established the absolute requirement for the silencing process, of an approximately 500-nt long conserved region in the 5'-terminal region of the Xist RNA called the 'A-repeat'. This region composed of 7 or 8 repetitions of a 24 nt long GC-rich element separated by U-rich spacers. By using chemical and enzymatic probes of the RNA structure, we found that the A-repeat region of both mouse and human Xist RNAs can be folded into two long irregular stem-loop structures. The repeats are involved in base-pair interactions either with another repeat or with nucleotides of the spacer sequences. However, most of the second element of each repeat is in a single stranded conformation. Bulges and loops in each stem loop mostly correspond to U-rich linker sequences and the 3' termini of the repeated sequences. By using an affinity chromatography method, we identified several nuclear proteins from human and mice that can interact with this region. We show that the Polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) has a strong affinity for this region and may participate to the establishment of its peculiar structure.",

Pintzas Laboratory of Signal Mediated Gene Expression, Institute of Biological Research and Biotechnology, National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, GREECE Introduction: Cancer develops through a collaboration of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Epigenetic abnormalities are manifested in global changes in chromatin packing and in localized gene promoter changes that regulate gene transcription. Covalent modifications in histones can be considered as active or repressive markers of gene expression. Activation of ras signaling pathways through oncogenic Ki-ras or BRAF mutations is a hallmark of colorectal cancer. Phosphorylation of H3 at Ser10 is involved in gene transcription and it is elevated in ras transformed cells (1) . We focused on the role of histone H3 epigenetic modifications in ras and raf signal transduction pathway and oncogenic transformation. Methods: Two systems have been used to assess H3 covalent modifications, a cell model created by selecting commercially available cell lines that beard different combination of genetic mutations and0 reflect different tumor stages and a system based in stable transfected cell lines with oncogenic Ki-, Ha-ras (2) and BRAF proteins. Western Blot, chromatin immunoprecipitation, siRNA technology and inhibitors for ras oncogenic activated pathways were used to study the role of histone modifications in ras mediated gene expression. Results: Ras oncogenic affects, through ERK/MAPK pathway, covalent modifications in H3 that lead to gene expression changes. Further, acetylation and methylation patterns of lysine in H3 are altered from early adenomacarcinoma cell lines to late colorectal tumor stages cells lines. Conclusion: Our results show that some histone covalent modifications play a role in progression of colorectal cancer in a ras dependent manner and may be useful as molecular markers. Introduction: The histone H3 demethylase Ndy1/KDM2B is a physiological inhibitor of replicative senescence and proposed to have protective effects from DNA damage. Based on these data we investigated whether Ndy1 protects from DNA damage by regulating redox homeostasis. Methods: Primary MEFs were infected with retrovirus constructs of Ndy1, and deletion mutants or transfected with Ndy1 siRNA. Cell survival, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were studied using the MTT assay, TUNEL and Et.Br nuclear staining, respectively. DNA oxidation and damage were analyzed by immunofluorescence and the Comet assay. Reactive Oxygen Species accumulation, antioxidant activity and the expression of redox regulatory genes were assessed by FACs, the antioxidant assay kit and RT 2 -PCR array, respectively. Ndy1 binding to the DNA and histone methylation were studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Results: Ndy1 overexpression protects cells from H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest and inhibits ROS-mediated signaling and DNA damage, whereas knockdown of Ndy1 has the opposite effects. Ndy1 promotes H 2 O 2 detoxification through the up-regulation of the antioxidant genes Aass, Nqo1, Prdx4 and Serpinb1b, whereas Ndy1 knockdown has the opposite effects. The induction of at least Nqo1 and Prdx4 depends on the binding of Ndy1 to specific sites within their promoters and the demethylation of promoter-associated histone H3 dimethylated at K36. Knockdown of Aass, Nqo1, Prdx4 and Ser-pinb1b in Ndy1-expressing cells to levels equivalent to those in control cells was sufficient to suppress the Ndy1 redox phenotype. Conclusion: Ndy1 epigenetically regulates several redox genes, thus modulating H 2 O 2 levels and the resistance of Ndy1-expressing cells to oxidative stress.",

To better comprehend the molecular mechanisms of gas1 transcriptional regulation at chromatin level, we studied gas1 promoter performing Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assays (ChIPs). This gave us information about the recruitment of transcriptional factors, chromatin modifying and remodeling complexes implicated in such regulation. Our results suggest the presence of the transcriptional factors C/EBPb, NF-jB, pELK1 and SRF, as well as GCN5 and PCAF containing histone acetyltransferases complexes in the transcriptionally active state. On the other hand, the remodeling complex NuRD, generally implicated in generating chromatin suppressive structures, is present when the gene is silenced and, concomitantly with the activation of the gene, it is released from the promoter while the remodeling complex SWI/SNF is recruited to it. These results suggest that structural changes of the chromatin at the promoter of the gene are also relevant in controlling gas1 transcriptional state.

Sekeri-Pataryas 1 Introduction: Epigenetic changes, such as posttranslational histone modifications, affect gene expression during ageing. Acetylation is the most studied histone modification and is associated with transcriptionally competent chromatin. The H1 histone subtype, H1 0 , is known to accumulate during terminal differentiation and has also been shown to accumulate during cellular senescence. Moreover, the acetylation of the promoter of this gene has been shown to be regulated during development and differentiation. In light of the above, the focus of this study is to investigate changes in histone acetylation levels that may occur in the H1 0 gene region during cellular ageing. Methods: The systems used were isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes in the quiescent state or activated in vitro with phytohemagglutinin and skin fibroblasts from young and elderly donors. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out with primers designed for the H1 0 gene region and the PCR products were analyzed using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: Histone acetylation levels of the H1 0 gene region up to 11 kb upstream were found to be higher in both activated and non activated lymphocytes from elderly donors as compared to those from young donors. The same age-related changes in acetylation levels were also detected in skin fibroblasts. Conclusions: Acetylation loosens the interaction between core histones and DNA and as such is a prerequisite for transcriptional activation. The elevated acetylation levels in the lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts from the elderly donors reveals that epigenetic changes may play a role in H1 0 accumulation previously found to occur during cellular ageing. Methods: Here, we induced neural differentiation of an embryonal carcinoma stem cell line (N-Tera 2) by retinoic acid (RA) treatment and analyzed histone variants and modifications. Results: We observed significant changes in histone variants as well as histone modification patterns of the differentiated cells, during differentiation. Western blot analysis of histone extracts has shown that beside a global change in acetylation/methylation pattern of histones especially histone H3, the expression of some histone variants such as H3.3, H2A.Z and H1.0 has changed after RA treatment of the cells. The histone variants were further identified by mass spectrometry. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technique coupled with real-time PCR analysis, we have also shown that these epigenetic changes occur on the regulatory regions of the genes involved in stemness (Oct4, Nanog) and neural differentiation (Pax6, Nestin). Conclusions: This report demonstrates the dynamic interplay of histone variants in regulating gene expression during stem cell differentiation. To study the in vivo role of TFIID in the transcriptional regulation of hepatic genes we generated mice with liver-specific disruption of TAF10 gene. Inactivation of TAF10 in hepatocytes resulted in the dissociation of TFIID into individual components. This correlated with the down-regulation of most hepatocyte-specific genes during embryonic life and a dramatic defect in liver organogenesis. Unexpectedly however, the transcription of less than 5% of active genes was affected by TAF10 inactivation and TFIID disassembly in adult liver. The extent of changes in transcription of the affected genes was dependent on the timing of their activation during liver development, relative to that of TAF10 inactivation. Interestingly, TFIID dissociation from promoters correlated with the re-expression of several postnatally silenced hepatic genes. The results point to the functional plasticity of TFIID and suggest that TFIID is required for the initial activation of genes, but is dispensable for maintaining ongoing transcription.",

The dADA2b-containing dSAGA complex acetylates histone H3 tails and in the lack of dADA2b H3 K9 and K14 acetylation is seriously reduced. However, there are two isoforms of dADA2b (dADA2bS and dADA2bL) that are differentially expressed during development. To characterize dADA2b function in dSAGA complexes we generated dAda2b mutations which eliminate the production of either or both dADA2b isoforms. Genetic studies showed that neither dAda2b isoform alone could provide a complete restoration of dAda2b function, suggesting that both are required for development. On the other hand, either dADA2b isoform can productively participate in dSAGA com-plexes and render those at least partially active in histone H3 acetylation. To study the molecular consequences of the loss of H3 K9 and K14 acetylation we compared the mRNA profiles of wild-type and dAda2b mutant animals by cDNA microarray. Global gene expression profiling indicates that the expression of less than 5% of the genes is significantly changed in dAda2b null mutants. More than half of the affected genes are up-regulated, of which the high number of defenserelated genes is particularly striking. Our data support the notion that different dADA2 proteins contribute to the functional versatility of multiprotein complexes and demonstrate that the loss of dSAGA specific H3 K9 and K14 acetylation affects (up-or down-regulates) the expression of a rather small subset of genes but does not cause a general transcription deregulation.",

CYP1A1 and CYP2A6 play important key role in phase I metabolism and metabolize several important toxins and procarcinogens. Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEPH) is mainly involved in the detoxification of wide variety of endogenous or exogenous carcinogens. Genetic differences in CYP1A1, CYP2A6 and mEPH genes have been reported to be associated with susceptibility to various cancers. In the present study, we determined the genotype frequencies of the main CYP1A1*2, CYP2A6*1 and *3, mEPH*3 and *4 polymorphisms in a group of 114 healthy volunteers representing Turkish population. For this purpose, whole blood samples were collected from and genomic DNA was isolated and was used to determine the frequency of CYP1A1*2, CYP2A6*1 and *3, mEPH*3 and *4 allelic variants by the PCR-RFLP. The genotype frequency, for CYP1A1*2 was determined as 0.95 for homo-and hemi-zygous wild type and 0.05 for homozygous mutants, respectively which was statistically different (p < 0.05). The CYP2A6*1 and *3 frequencies were not found in the population studied. Regarding the mEPH*3 and mEPH*4 genotypes, we found frequencies of 0.94 and 0.96 for homo-and hemi-zygous wild type (p < 0.05) and 0.06 and 0.04 for homozygous mutants, respectively (p < 0.05). This preliminary study presents CYP1A1, CYP2A6 and mEPH mutant allele distribution in the Turkish population and will provide understanding of the etiology of several cancers in Turkish patients. Down syndrome (DS) is a chromosomal abnormality (trisomy 21) associated with mental retardation and Alzheimer-like dementia, characteristic change of the individual's phenotype and premature aging. Oxidative stress is known to play a major role in this pathology since a gene dose effect leads to elevated ratio of superoxide dismutase to catalase/glutathione peroxidase. Accumulation of uric acid, the end product of purine metabolism, is another feature of DS and this might also be associated with genomic instability via overexpression of GARS-AIRS-GART, the gene coding for the protein complex that catalyzes different steps in de novo purine synthesis. Hyperuricemia has an interesting relationship with oxidative stress since it represents an important free radical scavenger and ROS themselves could influence its increase since, under oxidative stress conditions, xantine-dehydrogenase (XDH) is converted in xanthine oxidase (XO) which leads to concomitant production of free radicals. ROS might finally represent an important modulator of gene expression of non trisomic genes affecting penetration and expressivity of the pathology. Oxidative stress could be therefore an important pharmacological target to be addressed in this important genomic abnormality syndrome. Here we report that plasma sample from DS patients in pediatric age despite an increased total antioxidant capacity, largely due to elevated uric acid content, do not differ from healthy control plasma samples in terms of susceptibility to peroxidative stimuli. Instead, they present significantly elevated markers of oxidative stress such as increased allantoin levels. Moreover by treating the patients with CoQ10 (4 mg/kg/die) for two moths we were able to decrease markers of oxidative stress such as uric acid conversion to allantoin and oxidative DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes.",

Endothelial dysfunction is the common denominator in erectile dysfunction (ED). To date very scarce data exits about the relationship between the eNOS polymorphisms and ED. Our aim is whether the three potential polymorphisms in the eNOS gene (T786C in the promoter region, 27 bp repeat in intron 4) were associated with an increased risk of ED in Turkish population. Methods: Seventy-three patients with ED and 41 healthy controls were analyzed.

Patients who has an IIEF score greater than 26 consisted the control group. Genotypes were determined through polymerase chain reaction with or without restriction endonuclease digestions. Multilocus haplotypes tested to overcome the problems caused by using single polymorphisms in genetic association studies. Results: Although genotype distribution was not significantly different between patients with ED and controls statistically (p = 0.106), for 27 bp repeat in intron 4 the presence of a deletion seems to have 2.0 times (95% CI for OR:0.9-4.9) protective effect.

Livaditis Division of Medicine, Department of Biology, University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, GREECE Introduction: A 44 bp indel at the promoter region of the gene encoding serotonin transporter has been the focus of several association studies of mood disorders, showing a modest association with bipolar depression and suicidal behaviour. Allele S has been previously shown to result in lower levels of mRNA and protein as well as slower reuptake of serotonin from the synapse. Moreover, patients with the S/ S genotype respond worse to SSRIs. We attempted to study the relation of the serotonin transporting gene L/S polymorphism with depression-related trait scores in a group of University students. Methods: One hundred eighty one volunteer students were genotyped for the L/S polymorphism and were evaluated with a battery of psychological tests (Zung Depression Rating Scale, Symptoms Check-List-90-R, Eysenck Personality Inventory). They also answered questionnaires regarding adverse experiences. The group of carriers of the S allele were compared to non-carriers. We used MANOVA to evaluate the effect of the genotype and its interaction with both adverse life events and scores in the psychological tests. Results: We did not detect any significant association of genotype with the measured psychological scores. However, an interaction of adversities and genotype was detected: Among carriers of the S allele, students having faced adverse life events showed higher depressionrelated trait scores compared to those with no adversities. Among stu-dents without adversities those with no S allele scored higher than the S allele carriers. Conclusions: The S and L alleles may contribute differently to geneenvironment interaction that leads to psychological vulnerability.",

To investigate whether polymorphisms of CYP19 gene are associated with the risk of breast cancer, we analysed the frequency and distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms a tetranucleotide (TTTA) tandem repeat polymorphism and a 3 bp insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism in intron 4 of CYP19 gene. Methods: We studied 70 patients with breast cancer and 102 healthy control women. Results: The distribution of the genotypes of the (TTTA)n polymorphism of CYP19 was not significantly different groups, but high copy number of repeat (over 10) was increased in ER negative patient and low copy number of repeat (under 10) was increased in ER positive patient (p = 0.019) . On the other hand an increased frequency of the D allele was observed in the breast cancer group as compared with the control group (p = 0.001). When the control and patient group compared for there insertion/deletion (I/D) genotype, the frequency of patient with ID was significantly higher than the frequency of the healthy group with the same genotypes (p = 0.005, OR = 2.62) and DD was significantly higher, too (p = 0.004, OR = 12.81). Conclusions: These results suggest that the 3 bp I/D polymorphism of the CYP19 gene would be useful for selecting Korean women at a high risk of breast cancer. And the repeat number of (TTTA) polymorphism of CYP19 is associated with ER-positive and negative patient, it would be useful in the selection of candidate for chemoprevention with tamoxifen.",

The results show that in the presence of idarubicin the absorbance of histone H1 at 210 nm is decreased and the binding induces hypochromicity in the absorption spectrum of the molecule. Fluorescence emission data shows that the interaction of idarubicin with histone H1 decreases the emission intensity at 308 nm which corresponds to the fluorescence emission intensity of tyrosine in the histone H1.

However, potential mechanism of RNA cleavage by this nuclease has not been explored so far. Here, we performed a detailed study on the specificity of DFF40/CAD nuclease using synthetic single-stranded and double-stranded ribo-and deoxyribo-oligonucleotides as substrates in vitro. In addition, correlation between DFF40/CAD activation and integrity of RNA was analyzed in cells undergoing apoptosis in vivo. We have found that neither singlestranded RNA, single-stranded DNA, double-stranded RNA nor RNA-DNA heteroduplexes are cleaved by DFF40/CAD. Noteworthy, all types of oligonucleotides that are not cleaved by the nuclease inhibit cleavage of double-stranded DNA. We have observed that neither the activation of DFF40/CAD nor oligonucleosomal chromatin fragmentation was temporally correlated with total cellular or nuclear RNA degradation, indicating lack of a relationship between integrity of RNA and activity of the nuclease in vivo. We conclude that DFF40/CAD is exclusively specific for double-stranded DNA. In addition, although the nuclease is inhibited by RNA in vitro, the activity of DFF40/CAD is unlikely affected by the integrity of cellular RNA in vivo in cells undergoing apoptosis.",

            "text": "Analyses of the polymorphic Dmc-1-M200V variant In many cancers, different types of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) are observed including translocations, interstitial deletions, terminal deletions with de novo telomere additions, and chromosome fusions. In order to study the roles of essential genes for GCR suppression, we chose Smc5-Smc6 complex, which is involved in structural maintenance of chromosomes and required for interchromosomal and sister chromatid recombination. The Smc6-Smc9 temperature-sensitive mutation increased the GCR rates up to 76-fold compared to wild type. The inactivation of Smc6 with mutations in different GCR mutator genes synergistically increased the GCR rates. The breakpoint analysis of individual GCRs showed that loss of Smc6 resulted in mainly the translocation types of GCRs. These results point towards a role for the Smc5-Smc6 complex in suppressing gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCR formation) and ensuring the proper chromosome structures. DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) can arise during DNA replication or after exposure to DNA-damaging agents, and their correct repair is fundamental for cell survival and genomic stability. Here, we show that the Smc5-Smc6 complex is recruited to DSBs de novo to support their repair by homologous recombination between sister chromatids. Our findings show that the Smc5-Smc6 complex is essential for genome stability as it promotes repair of DSBs by error-free sisterchromatid recombination (SCR), thereby suppressing inappropriate non-sister recombination events. The eukaryotic Rad51 protein, a homologue of the bacterial RecA protein, plays a central role in mitotic recombinational repair of double strand DNA breaks and meiotic homologous recombination. Rad51 is known to catalyze homologous pairing and strand exchange during the recombination process. In human, the conventional Rad51 has a Lys residue at position 313(Rad51-K313). But the Rad51-Q313 that has Glu at position 313 was reported as an isofrom. In this study, we purified the Rad51-K313 and the Rad51-Q313 isoform as recombinant proteins, and performed their biochemical analyses in vitoro. Interestingly, we found that the strandexchange activity of Rad51-Q313 was significantly higher than that of Rad51-K313 under conditions with Ca 2+ , although the difference was not observed under conditions without Ca 2+ . To know their filament-formation ability, we performed a double-stranded DNA unwinding assay and that result showed the filament-formation ability of Rad51-Q313 was also enhanced. From mutational analyses, the positively charged residues (Lys and Arg), but not negatively charged, polar, and hydrophobic residues (Glu, Gln, and Met, respectively), at position 313 reduced the strand-exchange and DNA unwinding abilities of the HsRad51 protein. These findings suggest that the recombinase activity of HsRad51 is regulated by the electrostatic environment around position 313. The major apoptotic nuclease DFF40/CAD is primarily responsible for internucleosomal DNA cleavage during the terminal stages of programmed cell death. It has been reported that several proteins, including chromatin proteins histone H1, HMGB1/2 and topoisomerase II, can stimulate activity of this nuclease. Here, we investigated the mechanism of stimulation of DFF40/CAD by major non-histone chromatin protein HMGB1. Naked DNA was used as a substrate for recombinant DFF40/CAD nuclease in the presence of HMGB1 and other HMG-box containing proteins, including truncated forms of HMGB1. Efficiency of DNA cleavage, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions were then analyzed in such in vitro experimental model. We have observed that HMGB1 significantly stimulates naked DNA cleavage by DFF40/CAD nuclease in a dose-dependent manner. However, we show that HMGB1 neither binds to DFF40/CAD nor enhances its ability for stable binding to DNA. Comparison of the stimulatory activities of different HMG-box-containing proteins indicates that a structural array of two HMG-boxes is required for such stimulation. HMG-boxes are known to confer specific local distortions of DNA structure upon binding. Interestingly, the presence of DNA strand cross-links formed by cisplatin or transplatin, which may somehow mimic distortions induced by HMG-boxes, also affects DNA cleavage by the nuclease. The data presented suggest that changes induced in DNA conformation upon HMG-box binding makes the substrate more accessible to cleavage by DFF40/CAD nuclease and thus may contribute to preferential linker DNA cleavage during apoptosis.",

Kurosawa and N. Adachi Yokohama City University, Yokohama, JAPAN Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) are two major pathways for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs); however, their respective roles in human somatic cells remain obscure. Here, we generate human knockout cell mutants genetically deleted for the HR protein Rad54 and/or the critical NHEJ factor DNA ligase IV. We show that although NHEJ and HR are both important for repairing ionizing radiation-induced DSBs, NHEJ repairs nearly all of the topoisomerase-II as well as low-dose irradiationinduced DNA damage. Intriguingly, we find that DNA ligase IV negatively affects survival of cells treated with genotoxic agents capable of causing replication-associated DSBs (i.e. the topoisomerase I poison camptothecin and the PARP inhibitor NU1025). These results indicate that replication-associated DSBs are deleterious to cells when dealt with by the NHEJ pathway. Loss of Artemis, an NHEJ factor with endonuclease activity, also conferred resistance to camptothecin and NU1025. However, this effect was independent of DNA ligase IV deficiency, as the LIG4/ARTEMIS double-mutant was even more resistant to these agents than either single mutant. We also show that loss of Artemis significantly alleviates hypersensitivity of LIG4 null cells to radiation-and topoisomerase II-induced DNA damage. Based on our data, we propose a novel model for DSB repair, in which NHEJ tries to repair virtually all DSBs, with HR only active when NHEJ is missing or abortive, and Artemis is involved in pathway switching from incomplete NHEJ to HR.",

The Dmc1 protein is only present in meiotic cells, but the Rad51 protein is expressed in both meiotic and mitotic cells in yeast and vertebrates.

Biochemical analyses revealed that the OsDmc1 proteins promoted robust strand exchange between ssDNA and dsDNA over five thousand base pairs, even in the absence of RPA, which is an essential factor for strand exchange by the human and yeast Dmc1/Rad51 proteins. The strand-exchange activity of the OsDmc1A protein was obviously higher than that of the OsDmc1B protein.

Kurumizaka Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, JAPAN Homologous recombination is important for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks caused by DNA-damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation and DNA cross-linking reagents. The human Rad51 protein is a homolog of the Escherichia coli RecA protein, and plays a key role in Homologous recombination. However, previous biochemical studies indicated that the homologous DNA pairing activity of the Rad51 protein is extremely lower than that of the RecA protein in vitro. To find novel Rad51-interacting factors, in this study, we performed the yeast two-hybrid screening with human cDNA pools, and the human polypyrimidine tract-binding protein associated splicing factor (PSF) protein was identified as a candidate for the novel Rad51-interacting protein. The PSF protein was originally identified as a component of spliceosomes, suggesting a role in pre-mRNA splicing. In addition, previous studies have shown that the PSF protein promotes homologous DNA paring by itself. We purified the human Rad51 and PSF proteins as recombinant, and found that the PSF protein directly interacts with the Rad51 protein. The PSF protein enhanced the Rad51-mediated double-stranded DNA unwinding, which may depends on the Rad51-filament formation. These results suggested that the PSF protein may function in the Rad51-filament formation step.

We wished to investigate the mRNA and protein expression levels of Cdt1 and Geminin in cancer. Quantitative analysis of Geminin and Cdt1 mRNA levels was performed in human tumour cell lines and primary fibroblasts by Real-Time PCR. Cdt1 mRNA showed a 3-4 fold increase in breast cancer derived MCF7 cells and cervical cancer derived HeLa cells compared to primary cells, while 3-4 fold increase in Geminin mRNA levels was observed in HeLa cells compared to MCF7 and primary human fibroblasts, indicating that different tumour-derived cell lines exhibit different ratios of Cdt1/ Geminin levels. In order to determine Cdt1 and Geminin protein expression in breast cancer, immunohistochemistry was performed in a panel of breast cancer specimens. Both proteins exhibit higher expression levels in tumour cells in comparison to adjacent normal tissue. Cdt1 expression levels were evaluated at different stages of tumor progression, and correlated with HER2/neu, cyclin-A, ki67 and p53 expression.",

Kurumizaka Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, JAPAN Homologous recombinational repair (HRR) is an important pathway for the repair of double-strand breaks. The eukaryotic Rad51 protein plays a central role in the HRR pathway, but many other proteins are required for this pathway. In vertebrates, five proteins (the Rad51 paralogs; Rad51B, Rad51C, Rad51D, Xrcc2, Xrcc3) that share homology with the Rad51 protein are found as factors involved in the HRR pathway. The Rad51B protein reportedly interacts with the Rad51C protein, and the Rad51B-Rad51C complex functions in the Rad51 assembly onto the double strand break (DSB) sites during an early stage of the HRR pathway. On the other hand, we previously showed that the Rad51B protein preferentially binds to the Holliday junction DNA substrate in the presence of authentic double-stranded DNA and the Y-form DNA, suggesting that the Rad51B protein may also function in the late stage of the HRR pathway. Therefore, these facts suggest that the Rad51B protein have multiple functions in the early to late stages of the HRR pathway. To identified novel Rad51Binteracting proteins, we performed the yeast two-hybrid screening with human cDNA pools, and obtained seventy-three positive clones. Thirty clones contained DNA fragments from the Evl gene. We found that the purified Evl protein directly bound to the Rad51B protein in vitro. Therefore, the Evl protein may be a novel Rad51B-interacting protein. Results: In the absence or overexpression of Rad9, the transcripts of 1-2% of the yeast genes was found to change significantly and at least twofold compared to the corresponding wild type strain. In the former case, among the significantly up-regulated genes were a group with role in telomere maintenance via recombination and a group with helicase activity and among the down-regulated were genes with role in gene regulation such as RPB1 and CLN3. In the latter case, genes implicated in metabolism and carbohydrate transport along with HSP30 were found significantly up-regulated, while genes concerning nucleolus, ribosome biogenesis and assembly and cohesin complex were down-regulated. Conclusions: The genome-wide expression analysis showed for the first time, under physiological conditions implication of Rad9 in the expression of an appreciable number of genes belonging to particular functional categories. Under these unchallenged conditions, Rad9 seems to have an effect in pathways distinct from the known DNA damage check point. This role of Rad9 in gene regulation may reveal new aspects of signalling pathways cross-talking with cell cycle regulation. Whether Rad9 effect is direct or indirect is being examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and remains to be elucidated.",

            "text": "The new criteria to investigate internal ribosome entry initiation mechanism for cellular mRNAs The two major and principally different mechanisms of translation initiation in eukaryotes are cap-dependent scanning and internal ribosome entry. The latter one requires specific structures known as internal ribosome entry sites (IRES). IRESes were initially found in the 5' untranslated regions (5' UTR) of some cytoplasmic viral mRNAs. Later, the presence of IRES elements were also suggested for some cellular mRNAs. However, the existence of 'cellular IRESes' is still questionable. The conventional approach to identify IRES-elements is the method of di-cisrtonic constructs. The only criterion used so far is the comparison of various di-cistronic constructs, i.e. second cistron translation driven by the sequence tested with one driven by known (previously characterized) IRES element. This criterion is rather subjective. Moreover, in natural conditions all cellular mRNAs are monocistronic and possess m7G-cap, and theoretically are able to use the conventional cap-dependent way. Here we suggest new criteria to evaluate an actual mechanism of mRNA translation: 1) comparison of translation driven by the 5' UTRs in monocistronic context versus dicistronic one; 2) comparison of capped mono-cistronic RNA translation versus uncapped transcript. We applied these criteria to several human mRNAs with complex 5'UTRs previously reported to contain IRES elements: c-myc, Apaf-1, L1 and Hsp70. For all of them the translation was much more efficient for mono-cistronic mRNAs. Moreover, it was strongly depen-dent on the presence of the 5'-cap. These data lead us to conclude that mRNAs with long structured 5'UTRs are able to translate efficiently by the cap-dependent mechanism, at least under normal conditions. Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is a poly(A)-specific and capinteracting 3'-exoribonuclease that efficiently degrades mRNA poly(A) tails. Although many strategies have been proposed for the regulation of PARN activity, very few is known about the modulation of PARN activity by small molecule effectors, such as nucleotides. Based on the enzyme's preference for its natural substrates and regulators, we examined the role of purine nucleotides as potent effectors of human PARN activity. Detailed kinetic analysis revealed that RTP nucleotides tested behave as non-competitive inhibitors, while RDP and RMP exhibit competitive inhibition. Mg 2+ can release inhibition of RTP and RDP but not that of RMP. The same inhibitory effect was observed when the same analysis was performed for cytosine nucleotides. We further synthesized and used modified purine and pyrimidine nucleoside analogues with known anti-tumor growth effects. These compounds bear a six-membered ring carbohydrate moiety and purine or pyrimidine modified on the amine with a benzoyl-group. Two of the modified nucleotides tested, one with modified adenine and one with modified cytosine could effectively inhibit PARN activity. The six-membered sugar ring compound alone, or the nucleosides lacking the benzoyl-modified purine or pyrimidine had weaker or no effect on the enzyme. Our data imply that PARN activity can be modulated by natural nucleotides in vitro, thus providing a simple regulatory mechanism. Moreover, the analogues used in this work can serve as leading compounds for development of novel inhibitors of PARN. The Negative Regulator of Splicing (NRS) is a 230 nt, cis-acting RNA sequence contained within the gag gene of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). This intronic element inhibits splicing between an uptream 5\u00a2 splice site and the 3\u00a2 splice site. It appears to function as a non-productive 5\u00a2splice site that forms abortive splicing complexes with the 3\u00a2-splice site. NRS contains at least two functional regions: overlapping U1 and U11 binding sites at the 3\u00a2 end and an SR protein binding region in the 5\u00a2 part. By using chemical and enzymatic probes for RNA secondary structure we investigated the 2D structure of the NRS element. We provide evidence that NRS adopts a cruciform 2D structure where the SR (SLS2) and U1/U11 (SLS6) binding sites form individual stem loops. Gel shift and footprint analyses showed that hnRNPA1 binds the SLS2, SLS6 and H III structures, therefore the hnRNPA1 sites overlap the SR protein binding sites. By using an affinity purification technique and mass spectrometry we identified HeLa nuclear proteins that bind the NRS element. We confirmed that the SR proteins ASF/ SF2, 9G8 and SC35 bind this element. By using deletion mutants we showed that elimination of SLS2 and SLS6 strongly influences the binding of the SR proteins but not the binding of hnRNPA1 and hnRNP H. Thus, we propose that binding of these antagonist splicing factors on NRS strongly modulates its inhibition action on RSV RNA.",

To this extent, the auxiliary domain of hnRNP A3 was expressed as a GST-fused product and applied, in parallel with a GST-fused hnRNP A2, in pulldown assays using nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from human (HeLa, A549) cell lines. These studies revealed the unique ability of this domain of hnRNP A3 to form an extensive network of protein-protein interactions, not only with the other A/B, but also with hnRNP M and L proteins, in both cellular compartments. All interactions, with the exception of A1, were highly enhanced by previous RNase digestion of the extract. Furthermore, immunochemical studies applying a commercial and a home made rabbit polyclonal antibody provided clear evidence for the existence of two discrete hnRNP A3 isoform types, one common to human and rodent and the second comprising a major isoform unique to rodent cells. Evidence is also provided for an increased expression of hnRNP A3 in human lung cancer, in common to other A/B type proteins.

Kim Department of Anatomy, Embryology Lab Brain Korea 21, Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University, College of Medicine, Seoul, KOREA Introduction: Hox genes encode homeodomain-containing transcription factors that pattern an anterior-posterior body axis and regulate gene expression during vertebrate embryogenesis. Homeodomain proteins regulate specific genes either activator or repressor when they bind DNA binding motif (TAAT/ATTA, TTAT/ATAA) in target genes. However the specific DNA-Hox protein interaction has not been well defined. The present study we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) system to identify responsible transcriptional targets of Hoxc8, a member of Hox genes. Methods: In order to screen for downstream target genes of Hoxc8, we performed ChIP cloning. First, we prepared the murine E11.5 embryo because Hoxc8 expression is somewhat high. The embryo's chromatin DNAs were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and then sonicated, immunoprecipitated with Hoxc8 monoclonal antibody. Secondary ChIP DNA fragments were cloned into pBluescript vector and then sequenced to analyze cloned DNA. NCBI blast search were performed to collect gene information. For functional study luciferase reporter assay was performed. Results: We found 12 putative downstream genes of Hoxc8. Cloned genomic fragments are located in intron of seven genes individually. Four cloned genomic fragments are situated in intergenic regions as non-coding regions. One fragment is spread from intron 5 to exon 6. Among them Msh5 and Ttbk2 genes were found five or four times repeatedly. Luciferase reporter assay showed that Msh5 and Ttbk2 were up-regulated by overexpressed Hoxc8 in F9 cells. Conclusions: ChIP cloning method using Hoxc8 specific antibody suggested new 12 putative downstream target genes of Hoxc8. Among them Msh5 and Ttbk2 might be responsible for Hoxc8 directly. The chemical compound of early earth atmosphere such as oxygen species and nitric oxide play role of signaling molecules in biological processes. Methanol of modern earth atmosphere is generated by ubiquitous pectin methylesterase (PME) from plant cell wall pectin. PME gene transcription is increased by stress impact. We suggest that PME and methanol may take part in regulation of plant mRNA stability. To check this hypothesis we isolated and sequenced the full-size tobacco proPME cDNA. Intracellular PME targeting was studied in transient expression experiments by agroinjection of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Our results showed that PME activity depends on proPME leader part providing mature PME delivery to cell wall pectin. Co-agroinjection of N. benthamiana leaves with proPME gene and crTMV: GFP vector resulted in stimulation of virus-induced RNA silencing. Conversely, co-expression of crTMV: GFP with either antisense PME construct or with enzymatically inactive proPME restored synthesis of viral RNA. Furthermore, expression of proPME enhanced GFP transgene-induced gene silencing accompanied by relocation of the DCL1 protein from nucleus to the cytoplasm, activation of siRNAs and miRNAs production. Then it has been shown that mechanical stress, transgene expression and even spontaneous transcription resulted in activation of PME gene expression. We showed on plants stored in hermetically isolated boxes that (i) methanol evaporation stimulated gene silencing and (ii) methanol donor plants agroinjected with proPME had inhibitory effect on crTMV: GFP reproduction in methanol accepting plants. We concluded that methanol is likely to be silencing signal molecule.",

Liu Molecular Signalling Laboratory, Department of Immunology, Monash University, Prahran, VIC, AUSTRALIA Introduction: Telomerase maintains telomeres and underlies continuous cell proliferation in up to 90% of cancers. However, the mechanisms of telomerase activation remain to be elucidated. The regulation of telomerase activity takes place at multiple levels, most pre-dominantly transcriptional regulation of the telomerase catalytic subunit (human telomerase reverse transcriptase, or hTERT). The family of Ets transcription factors has been implicated in regulating hTERT gene expression. Hitherto, the roles and underlying mechanisms of specific Ets members in regulating hTERT gene remain to be investigated. Method: RNA interference technology was exploited to silence the Ets transcription factors, Ets-1 and Ets-2, in various types of cancer cells. Gene expression of hTERT and telomerase activity was determined in the cells in parallel with cell proliferation and apoptotic analyses. Results: Silencing Ets-2, but not Ets-1, resulted in significant repression of the hTERT gene and inhibitions of telomerase activity, in association with increased apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines. The apoptosis induced by silencing Ets-2 was inhibited by either transducing Ets-2 protein or gene expression of hTERT, suggesting that Ets-2 gene silencing-induced cancer cell death was telomerase inhibitiondependent. Furthermore, Ets-2 bound the hTERT gene. Mutagenesis identified two non-canonical Ets binding sites in the hTERT promoter; mutation of each Ets-2 binding site resulted in depressed hTERT gene promoter activity. Conclusion: The transcription factor Ets-2 is required for hTERT gene expression, thereby telomerase activity and cancer cell proliferation. Ets-2 may be a potential target for inducing telomerase inhibition and cancer cell death.",

However, the aspect of current concern is the validity for human risk assessment. The present investigation was conducted to better explain the molecular aspects of its toxicity. Methods: Using human hepatoma cells (HepG2), we tried to elucidate the regulation process involved in some proteins and genes expression by OTA using western blotting and RT-PCR analysis. The oxidative status was analysed by measuring the reactive oxygen species (ROS) using DCFH-DA as a fluorescent probe. Results: Our study demonstrated that, there is a down-regulation for Hsp 70, Hsp 27 mRNAs, and proteins levels. We showed a slight timedependent increase of ROS, which was sufficient to provoke Heat shock proteins induction. To verify this apparent transcriptional inhibitor potential of Heat shock protein genes expression by OTA, we have studied the regulation of some targets of the transcriptional factor p53: p21, mdm2, Bax and PUMA. We have demonstrated that OTA increased p53 stabilization and phosphorylation, in these conditions p21 and mdm2 mRNAs levels decreased remarkably. Similar results were observed with p21, Bax and PUMA protein levels. This suggested that OTA may acts as an inhibitor of genes transcription. This hypothesis was confirmed by expression of a metabolic enzyme, gapdh and we found that gapdh mRNA level decreased significantly in presence of OTA. Conclusion: These data might suggest that this inhibition of transcriptional process in response to OTA treatment seems to be a general mechanism.",

Fujita, I. Piuz and W. Schlegel Fondation Pour Recherches Medicales, University of Geneva, Geneva, SWITZERLAND Introduction: The transcription rate of immediate early genes (IEGs) is controlled strictly by positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and negative transcription elongation factors, negative elongation factor (NELF) and 5,6-dichloro-1-b-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), at critical steps of transcription elongation. We herein addressed whether NELF and DSIF functions for IEG transcription are stimulation-dependent. In addition, we examined whether IEG transcription controlled by NELF and DSIF affects hormone production in neuroendocrine cells. Methods: The expression of NELF (NELF-E) and DSIF (Spt5) was knocked down using RNA interference (RNAi) in neuroendocrine GH4C1 cells. Effects of the knock-downs on expression of IEGs (c-fos, MKP-1, junB) and hormone genes (prolactin and growth hormone) were evaluated by using real-time PCR, Western blotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Results: In cellular resting condition, either knock-down increased basal levels of IEGs transcription. NELF-E knock-down reduced thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-induced IEGs transcription. In surprising contrast, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced IEGs transcription was unaltered or even slightly increased by NELF-E knock-down. Conversely, Spt5 knock-down reduced both TRH-and EGF-induced IEGs transcription. Dynamic analysis of pol II distribution revealed that NELF-E knock-down reduced TRH-induced IEGs transcription by slowing down pol II elongation rate. As for hormone production, knockdown of NELF-E strongly induced prolactin production while that of Spt5 strongly suppressed growth hormone production. Conclusions: NELF regulates IEG transcription in a stimulation-specific manner by modulating pol II elongation rates. NELF-E and Spt5 knock-down alters hormonal transcription pattern possibly as a result of indirect regulation via transcription factors encoded by IEGs.",

Its participation in the splicing process, however, was not studied in detail. We identified a conditionally lethal allele, prp45 , which exhibits temperature sensitivity and cell wall-and cell cyclerelated phenotypes at permissive temperatures. Comprehensive synthetic lethal analysis of this mutation revealed genetic interactions with the alleles of the Nineteen Complex (NTC) members and the factors acting in the 3' splice site recognition and during the second catalytic step. Furthermore, tandem affinity purified Cwc2-associated spliceosomal complexes from the prp45 (1-169) strain contained significantly less Prp22 than the wild-type complexes. Prp22 is an ATP dependent DEAHbox RNA helicase involved in mRNA release, which was recently shown to affect the fidelity of 3' splice site usage. Based on these observations, we tested the efficiencies of both steps of splicing in vivo using various ACT1-CUP1 fusion constructs mutated in the consensus nucleotides of 5' and 3' splice sites or branch-point sequences. We found that while prp45 (1-169) did not affect the splicing of canonical ACT1-CUP1 template it lowered the splicing efficiency of various first and second step limiting reporters. The data suggest that Prp45 contributes to the interactions between the substrate and the spliceosomal active site during both steps of splicing. These interactions may affect the splicing efficiency of pre-mRNAs nonconforming to the consensus. The role of Prp45 in modulating splicing efficiency is intriguing because of the involvement of human SNW/SKIP in the regulation of elongating RNA Pol II and in the expression of alternately spliced genes. In Staphylococcus aureus at least four isoacceptor tRNA Gly molecules have been identified that, besides their prominent role in protein synthesis, they participate also in cell wall synthesis. All tRNA Gly molecules are aminoacylated by a single glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS), but they follow different pathways depending mainly on idiosyncratic structural features. The S. aureus cell wall consists of more than 20 layers of linear glycan chains that are cross-linked via characteristic pentaglycine bridges. Glycine is incorporated by the non-ribosomal peptidyltransferases FemX, FemA and FemB and glycyl-tRNA Gly molecules serve as glycine donors. In the present study, we identified through genomic survey a pseudogene encoding an atypical tRNA Gly , apart from the four tRNA Gly coding genes that have been reported that exist in S. aureus. Initial screening of S. aureus cultures with RT-PCR showed that this pseudogene is expressed and subsequent cloning and in vitro transcription showed that the pseudo-tRNA Gly is suitable substrate for aminoacylation by GlyRS. Moreover, bioinformatic and structural analysis strongly suggests that this pseudo-tRNA Gly carries specific identity elements that do not favour the interaction with EfTu and protein synthesis machinery. In contrast, this tRNA molecule more likely serves solely the incorporation of glycine residues in the cell wall of S. aureus. The identification of a pseudogene that encodes a functional tRNA Gly is important towards the elucidation of the essential biochemical events that take place during the tRNA-dependent cell wall synthesis pathway in S. aureus, which represents a novel molecular target for inactivation.",

Herrera, C. E. Flores and A. Gonzalez Instituto de Fisiologia Celular, Universidad Naciona Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, MEXICO Introduction: Chromatin organization at promoters determines the dynamics of transcriptional state of eukaryotic genes. In the course of transcriptional repression, promoter-resident nucleosomes serve as substrates for a variety of modifying and/or re-modeling activities that have their reorganization as a result. This process is often facilitated by the presence of specific proteins such as repressors, co-repressors, histone modifiers and chromatin remodelers. The expression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae GDH3 gene is strongly repressed in the presence of glucose and is enhanced in ethanol. However, the mechanism does not involve the classic glucose repression mediated by Mig1p. Methods: We tested the involvement of histone deacetylase Hda1p, corepressor Tup1/Cyc8 and several putative repressors in the repression of GDH3 promoter using reporter (-gal and RT-PCR assays. Further, we analyzed the chromatin state by chromosomal MNase assays. Results: In the presence of glucose, expression of b-gal under GDH3 promoter was incremented about eightfold in hda1D, tup1D, cyc8D, and hda1/tup1D strains, and about threefold in each nrg1D and nrg2D strains, as compared to WT. The result was consistent with RT-PCR for the endogenous GDH3 expression. A particular cleavage pattern by MNase was observed for GDH3 promoter under glucose, and particularly changed under ethanol at the TATA box. S change was also observed under glucose for the above deletion strains. Conclusions: The particular chromatin organization of GDH3 promoter under repressive conditions is dependent on Hda1p. Hda1p is recruited by the co-repressor Tup1p-Cyc8p complex which in turn is recruited to the GDH3 promoter via Nrg1p or Nrg2p.",

Tanaka 1   1 The University of Tokyo, IMCB, Tokyo, JAPAN, 2 Rikkyo University, College of Science, Tokyo, JAPAN Although ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription is the integral step for ribosome biogenesis, the underlying regulatory mechanism in plant cell remains unclear. As a first step to understand the rRNA synthesis in plant cell, we investigated transcription factors that are involved in nuclear and plastid rDNA transcription in a unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis with a polyclonal antibody against CmRRN3, of which homologues in yeast and mammals is key transcription factors to assemble RNA polymerase I (Pol I) pre-initiation complex, showed that CmRRN3 specifically occupied the 18S rDNA promoter region. Pol I occupation was also observed at the same region, suggesting that RRN3 function is conserved in plant cell as well as in other eukaryotes. To identify an RNA polymerase sigma factor for rDNA transcription in the plastid, we prepared polyclonal antibodies against each four RNA polymerase sigma factors, SIG1-SIG4, and subjected to ChIP analyses. Results indicated that SIG1 was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with the rrn16 promoter region, and the level was increased upon light exposure of the dark-adapted cells. Those occupancies were proportional to de novo rrn16 synthesis rate estimated by run-on transcription assay. These results suggested that SIG1 is positively involved in the rRNA synthesis in the plastid. We also present data obtained by run-on transcription analyses suggesting how the cell coordinates transcription of three kinds of rDNA in nucleus, plastid, and mitochondria.",

This catabolic system is composed of the dmp-operon encoding the pathway enzymes and the divergently transcribed regulatory dmpR gene product. Transcription of the dmpoperon from the Po promoter is dependent on the activity of dmpR, which binds pathway substrates to take up its transcriptional promoting form. Because the Po promoter is dependent on r 54 while the Pr promoter of dmpR is dependent on r 70 , this regulatory circuit is controlled by two different forms of RNA polymerase. Utilization of phenolics via the dmp-system is dominated by global regulation that leads to inactivity of the Po promoter even in the presence of pathway substrates under high energy conditions such as rapid growth on rich medium. However, robust transcription occurs under conditions that result in synthesis of the alarmone ppGpp, which has been proposed to ultimately control the cellular r 54 -RNA polymerase levels and thereby Po promoter occupancy. Using specific mutations and in vitro and in vivo transcription assays, we present evidence that the activity of the r 70 -Pr promoter is regulated by a novel mechanism in which r 54 -RNA polymerase occupancy and activity of the Po promoter stimulate Pr output. Thus, dmpR auto-stimulates Pr activity through its action on the nonoverlapping and divergently transcribed Po promoter. We propose a model in which this positive feed-forward loop reinforces both silencing in the presence of alternative carbon sources with robust transcription when the dmp-encoded catabolic enzymes are needed.",

Flytzanis Department of Biology, University of Patras, GREECE COUP-TFs are transcription factors, members of the steroid-thyroidretinoic acid receptor super family. Studies in a plethora of species have shown that COUP-TFs are extremely conserved genes preferentially expressed in the developing nervous system. They also play an important role in organogenesis, homeostasis and cellular differentiation during embryonic development. The sea urchin COUP-TF is expressed in oogenesis and the stored maternal mRNA is spatially localized in the egg. The early embryonic COUP-TF protein represses transcription of the CyIIIb actin gene in the aboral ectoderm and relocates from the nuclear periphery to the condensed chromatin in a cell cycle depended manner. At the final stages of embryogenesis (pluteus), COUP-TF transcripts accumulate in the neurogenic cell layer of the oral ectoderm. To study the transcriptional regulation of the sea urchin COUP-TF gene we cloned and sequenced a 2000 bp up-stream region and determined the transcription initiation site. This up-stream region was inserted in a vector containing the green fluorescence protein gene (GFP) and the basal promoter of the sea urchin gene Endo16. The Endo16 promoter is unable to drive expression of the GFP gene without the presence of additional regulatory elements. In addition to this vector, a series of up-stream deletions were constructed, as well as insertions of isolated small fragments from the COUP-TF up-stream region in front of the Endo16/GFP cassette. All constructs were microinjected in fertilized Paracentrotus lividus eggs and resulting transgenic embryos were let developed to gastrula and pluteus embryonic stages. Analysis of GFP fluorescence in series of transgenic embryos, indicate the presence of a regulatory module that is sufficient to drive expression of the GFP cassette in the oral ectoderm, where the endogenous gene is also expressed. A number of putative response elements were recognized within this module and using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the corresponding binding factors were detected in nuclear protein extracts from developing embryos. Methods: Interactions between AP-1 proteins and TAFs were studied through immunoprecipitations in nuclear extracts of different colon adenoma cell lines. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA), migration assays, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Confocal microscopy were performed. Results: An interaction between c-Jun and TAF4b was identified, while both proteins co-localize in the nucleus. An increased cell migration and a change in cell morphology after the use of TAF4b siRNA, indicate an involvement of TAF4b in cell transformation and EMT. Furthermore, c-Jun and TAF4b bind on the AP-1 binding sites of EMT markers, while the expression of these genes is up-regulated when c-Jun or TAF4b are down-regulated through siRNA. Conclusion: Cells undergo the final steps of tumor progression leading to metastasis via a complex and not yet fully characterized transcriptional network. We suggest that TAFs together with AP-1 members are implicated in cancer and further on in metastasis through a synergistic action.",

Our observation that does not influence a basal transcription level suggests, that this region is no functional core element. The data has shown that the jhbp gene. For characterization of jhbp promoter we cloned the 90 bp located at position -39/+51 relative to transcription start site (tsp) into the promoterless pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter plasmid and reporter constructs containing wild promoter fragment or deletion mutants were generated. Up until now, the jhbp gene structure has only been described for M. sexta and G. mellonella. (In order to show which of the potential regulatory elements are functional) DPE is not required for the core promoter activity of jhbp. Our earlier sequence analysis and EMSA studies revealed the presence of the following putative elements in jhbp promoter: +29TATAAA-24, +14TCAGTA+19 and +38AGGTG+42, corresponding to TATA box, Inr, and DPE, respectively. Moreover, TATA box play a key role in a regulation of basic transcription level. Inr element seems to cooperate with TATA box increasing the basic transcriptional activity. Introduction: Clinical data suggest that iron is a negative factor in chronic hepatitis C; however, the molecular mechanisms by which iron modulates the life cycle of hepatitis C virus (HCV) remain elusive. Likewise, little is known on how HCV affects cellular iron homeostasis. Methods and Results: We utilized Huh7 hepatocytes expressing a HCV subgenomic replicon as a well-established model for viral replication. We demonstrate that iron administration to replicon cells dramatically inhibits the expression of viral RNA, while iron chelation elicits opposite responses. Pulse-chase experiments show that this is not due to alterations in viral RNA stability. Rather, tryptophan fluorescence emission spectroscopy with purified recombinant HCV RNA polymerase (NS5B) reveals that iron binds specifically and with high affinity (apparent K d : 6 and 60 lM for Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ , respectively) to the protein's Mg 2+ -binding pocket, thereby inhibiting its enzymatic activity. Analysis of expression profiles of iron metabolism genes suggests that replicon cells undergo a genetic reprogramming to support subgenomic viral replication, resulting in reduction of intracellular iron levels.",

A highly sensitive quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method for KLK4 mRNA quantification was developed using the SYBR Green chemistry. GAPDH was used as endogenous control gene. Relative quantification analysis was performed using the comparative C T method 2 -DDC T . Results: A statistically significant elevation of KLK4 mRNA expression was observed in the malignant (mean \u00b1 SE: 73.6 \u00b1 18.1 mRNA copies of KLK4/mRNA copies of GAPDH, c/Kc), compared to benign tumour specimens (mean \u00b1 SE: 2.8 \u00b1 1.3 c/Kc).

Introduction: The Elavl/Hu family of RNA-binding proteins is composed of the ubiquitously expressed HuA/HuR and the neuronrestricted HuB, HuC and HuD. All members share similarities towards the post-transcriptional regulation of their target mRNAs. Thus it is currently unclear whether they share functional properties in neurons or they have distinctive functions. In this report we aim to identify the potential role of HuR in CNS neurons and correlate it with expression of the neuronal Hu proteins. Methods: We utilize immunohistochemical and immunoblotting methodologies to identify the expression of HuR in different CNS compartments. We further aim to identify the functional role of HuR in the CNS using a transgenic system of HuR-ablation in murine neurons in the hipoccampus and frontal lobe. Results: We found that HuR is expressed in the nucleus of many neuronal and glial CNS compartments, albeit at lower levels than the neuronal Hu's that appear to have a cytoplasmic expression pattern. Mice with a HuR-deficient neurons develop with no gross defects in the CNS. In a model of kainate-induced excitotoxicity a partial protection was observed in stages proximal to kainate administration; however at later stages neuronal death was much more severe in the absence of HuR. In addition, HuR-deficient neurons exhibited increases in the expression of neuronal Hu's suggesting potential compensatory effects. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a differential role for HuR in kainate-receptor instigated signals versus apoptotic neuronal damage. They further demonstrate a potential interplay between HuR neuronal Hu's towards the modulation of neuronal gene expression. Post-transcriptional processes that include splicing, polyadenylation, transport, stability and translation of mRNA, are important events in regulating gene expression in higher eukaryotes. These are brought about by an extensive network of interactions of a large number of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), operating within diverse multifactorial RNP complexes. We focus here on interactions between hnRNP proteins, having a major role in RNA splicing, and the HuR and TIA-1 proteins with an established role in stability/translation of target mRNAs. Both groups of proteins have a major nucleoplasmic localization and ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, as well as an apparent increased expression in cancer (mainly, in colon and lung). Currently, a likely functional interaction between HuR and AUF-1/hnRNP D is most considered. We report here our findings on additional interactions between hnRNPs and HuR that were obtained by an extensive application of immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays on nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts prepared from human and mouse cell lines. We have identified specific associations between hnRNP A1, A3 and C1/C2 with HuR (but not TIA-1) and have ascribed discrete biochemical properties with respect to nuclear/cytoplasmic presence, stability to RNase and salt. We presently apply fractionation studies to look at their presence in specific RNP complexes. The biological significance, if any, of these interactions will be tested under conditions related to stress or to cellular transformation. These initial findings on the association of specific hnRNPs with HuR implicate a discrete role in RNA processing events, operating in the nucleus and/or the cytoplasm that remains to be established.",

            "text": "Resetting of the mammalian clock by TSA has phase-dependent effects on the expression levels of c-myc and wee1 genes in N2A murine cells A. Repouskou 1 , K. E. Sekeri-Pataryas 2 , T. G. Sourlingas 2 and A. Prombona 1 1 Laboratory of Chronobiology, Institute of Biology, National Centre For Scientific Research 'DEMOKRITOS', Athens, GREECE, 2 Laboratory of Histone Biochemistry And Ageing, Institute of Biology, National Centre For Scientific Research 'DEMOKRITOS', Athens, GREECE Introduction: Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, causes changes in the acetylation status of histones and other cellular non-histone proteins. Especially in malignant cells, this has dramatic effects on the expression levels of cell cycle genes, on cell cycle progression and/or the induction of apoptosis. Recent reports have shown that circadian clock component proteins regulate the expression levels of cell cycle genes, like cyclin D1, wee-1 and c-myc. In this investigation, we apply TSA in N2A murine neuroblastoma cells at peaks and troughs of per1 rhythm, in order to study how circadian phasing influences the expression levels of the cell cycle-related genes, wee1 and c-myc. Methods: The circadian clock in N2A cell cultures is synchronized by 100 nM dexamethasone and TSA (100 ng/ml) is added to the medium for 2 hours at various circadian times. Expression levels of per1, c-myc and wee1 are monitored by reverse transcription and qPCR. Results: Our results show that TSA causes an acute response in per1 transcription in all cases examined. Moreover, the circadian phase of per1 is critical in modulating the effect of TSA on the expression levels of the cell cycle genes c-myc and wee1. In particular, wee1 expression is suppressed when cells are treated with TSA at per1 peak levels only. Conclusions: We conclude that circadian phasing is important for TSA-induced changes in the expression levels of cell cycle genes. Therefore, circadian timing may modulate the effect of drugs (e.g. TSA) on cell cycle progression in cancer cell lines. NPAS is a transcription factor that regulates the mammalian circadian rhythm and contains a heme-binding site in each of two PAS domains (A and B). The heme domain has been suggested to act as a sensor for gaseous molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO). To characterize the role of the heme domain in this function, we overexpressed mouse NPAS2 and mouse BMAL1 with a reporter gene in NIH3T3 cells, and investigated the effects of PASA domain mutants, in the context of full-length NPAS2, on the transcriptional activity of the mouse Period 1 (mPer1) gene. H138A, H148A, and C170A mutants with 6-coordinated low-spin ferric heme acted as a transactivator formPer1 like the wild type. In contrast, H119A and H171A mutants at the endogenous ligands for heme showed remarkably reduced transcriptional activity. In gel-shift assays, H119A or H171A mutations in the isolated basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PASA domain impaired heterodimer formation with BMAL1, resulting in loss of DNA binding to the canonical E-box (CACGTT). The other mutants such as H138A, H148A and C170A had significant binding activities similar to that of wild type. These results indicate that the transcriptional activities of the mutants correlated well with their DNA binding activities, suggesting that local conformational changes near the axial ligands of the PASA domain are responsible for its regulation of transcription. The similar results were also observed in the ferrous forms, suggesting that the DNA-binding activities of the mutants are independent of heme redox states. Placental type glutathione transferase (GST-P) is not expressed in normal liver but is highly induced during rat haptocarcinogenesis, and has been used as a reliable tumor marker for experimental hepatocarcinogenesis in the rat. The molecular mechanism of any tumor marker, once elucidated, may shed a light on the mechanism of the particular tumorigenesis. This idea in mind, we have been pursuing the mechanism of specific induction of the GST-P gene during hepatocarcinogenesis. Making use of advanced technologies of molecular and cellular biology, including proteomic analysis, gene cloning, analyses of specific interaction between enhancer element and regulatory proteins in vitro and in vivo, production of specific transgenic rats etc. We were able to identify the enhancer element (GPE1). We also identified the activator and repressor proteins that interact with GPE1 and responsible for this tumor marker expression. In particular, C/EBP was required for the suppression of GST-P gene in normal liver, whereas the Nrf2/MafK heterodimer was required for the activation of this gene during hepatocarcinogenesis. The DNA damage response is a complex signaling network that is induced by DNA lesions and vigorously activated by double strand breaks (DSBs). The DSB response is mobilized by the nuclear protein kinase ATM that phosphorylates key players in the damage response pathway. ATM deficiency leads to the genome instability syndrome ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). Here, we show that Matrin 3 (Matr3) is an ATM substrate. Matr3's function is unknown, but its functional link with the proteins p54 nrb and PSF implies a role in RNA processing. We found that Matr3 phosphorylation is important for proper activation of the DSB-induced cell cycle checkpoints. Using proteomic analysis we demonstrated that the RNA helicase DHX9 and the p53 co-activators hnRNP K and DDX5 interact with Matr3. Importantly, hnRNP K is known to be induced following DNA damage in an ATM-dependent manner and both hnRNP K and DDX5 are involved in activating the cell cycle checkpoints. DHX9 plays an active role in gene expression by bridging CREB-binding protein (CBP) and BRCA1 with RNA polymerase II. CBP and BRCA1 are known ATM substrates and we found that DHX9 was an ATM target as well. The emerging picture is that of a protein complex whose members are ATM targets in the cell cycle checkpoint pathway. Further investigation of the role of Matr3 and other members of this complex in the checkpoint pathway is underway.",

Kontoyiannis 1 1 Institute of Immunology, B.S.R.C. 'Alexander FLEMING', Vari, GREECE, 2 Genomic Engineering Technologies, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY, USA Introduction: AUF1 (hnRNPD) is a member of the hnRNP family and exists as four protein isoforms (p37, p40, p42, p45) produced as a result of alternative splicing. The molecular effects of AUF1 are deciphered by its primary involvement in posttranscriptional regulation of several mRNAs (maturation, N/C shuttling, stability/degradation, translation) relating to a pleiotropy of cellular responses from survival to senescence. However the in vivo role of AUF1 remains unclear, although indications for its involvement in inflammation and neoplasia have been provided. Methods: We created a 'functional knock-out' for AUF1 using gene targeting and application of the Flp/FRT and Cre/loxP systems of recombination. The induced mutation abolishes the functions of the central RNA-recognition motifs (AUF1 DRRM ) in all AUF1 isoforms. Results: Obligatory homozygous AUF1 DRRM showed multiple phenotypes. Specifically, 50% of the mutant embrya die past midgestation relating to defects in fetal growth. Similarly, the mutant mice born are growth retarded and more than 60% of those succumb at the age of 4 weeks from unknown aetiology. The remaining mice survive but both male and female carriers appear sterile. With respect to inflammation, we also generated an innate immune-restricted system for AUF-1 ablation which demonstrated a pro-inflammatory role for AUF1, which did not relate to any effects on the biosynthesis of key cytokines. Conclusion: Our studies demonstrate a pleiotropic role for AUF1 in a number of cellular responses supporting embryonic growth, fertility and inflammation.",

Chen State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBS, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, CHINA Candida albicans is a commensal fungus of mucosal surfaces that can cause disease in susceptible hosts. Its ability of morphological transition is associated with the virulence of this human pathogen. Many transcription factors have been proved to regulate morphogenesis of C. albicans. Cas5 is a putative zinc finger transcription factor which was reported to have a role in the C. albicans cell wall damage response, but its role in morphogenesis of C. albicans remains unknown. To determine its transcriptional activity, we fused different Cas5 domains to the lexA DNA binding domain and measured the transcriptional activities of the fusion proteins in a lacZ reporter system. Beta-galactosidase activity assay showed that the N-terminal polyQ domain is necessary and sufficient for the transcriptional activity of Cas5. Through homologous recombination using a hisG-URA3-hisG cassette, we sequentially knocked out both alleles of CAS5 gene and examined the phenotype of the cas5/cas5 mutant under different growth conditions. The cas5/cas5 cells showed severe growth defect and formed wrinkled colonies on several solid media. In yeast growth conditions, the cas5/cas5 mutant cells enhanced filaments formation.

In addition, utilisation of alternative cell type promoters generates CIITA isoforms that are distinguished by different N-terminal regions: Types I and III are constitutively expressed in dendritic and B-cells respectively and Type IV is IIFN inducible in various cell types. We investigated the ability of those variants to regulate different MHC class II isotypes. Methods: Rj2.2.5 (CIITA-deficient B-cells) and HeLa cells (in which CIITA is not normally expressed), were used. Different CIITA isoforms were transfected in each cell line, and total RNA isolated was analysed by real-time PCR for MHCII transcripts. The CIITA isoforms were also co-transfected with different MHCII gene promoters fused to the luciferase gene. Results: We found that each CIITA isoform has a different preference in the MHCII genes that it activates, resulting in different ratios of these genes in each cell line. As expected, the observed total levels of transcription vary significantly, in the order Type IV<III<I. Conclusion: MHC class II genes show a differential response to the CIITA isoforms. This may be the basis of differential MHC isotype expression patterns, as well as quantitative and/or qualitative cell type preferences in antigen presentation function in various cell types.",

Neagu, A. Georgescu, G. Butur and C. Ardeleanu 'Victor Babes' National Institute of Pathology, Bucharest, ROMANIA Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease involving the breakdown of cartilage and juxtaarticular bone, which is often accompanied by decreased bone mineral density (BMD), deformity of synovial joints, and increased risk of fracture. Several lines of evidence indicate that an imbalance in the OPG/ RANK/RANKL system that controls osteoclast activity contributes significantly to the skeletal erosions that are characteristic of RA. OPG is a soluble osteoblast-derived protein that influences bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and activation. Methods: Formalin fixed paraffin embedded synovial tissues, surgically removed from knee joints of patients with RA were analysed using standard HE and the indirect tristadial ABC-peroxidase immunohistochemical technique for OPG. mRNA for OPG was detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from fresh tissues. Results: Strong immunohistochemical staining for OPG in synovial tissue from patients with RA was detected in samples with mild inflammatory infiltrate and patients with mild osteolysis as evaluated by DEXA. Levels of OPG mRNA detected by RT-PCR correlates significantly with protein expression and severity of bone loss. Conclusions: In this study, high levels of OPG reflect a protective mechanism of the skeleton, preventing most of the bone loss that develops in immune-mediated arthritis. These results suggest that RANKL-RANK-OPG system is an excellent therapeutic target, and OPG could represent a potent new agent for treating human patients with RA. Introduction: Earlier studies from our laboratory have shown that DNA/RNA methylation inhibitors block murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell differentiation and promote cytoplasmic accumulation of discrete non-poly(A) RNA transcripts. These RNAs were hybridized with DNA fragments derived from 3\u00a2-flanking sequences of b major globin gene locus in which a 235bp silent region was found to contain a B1 repetitive element and structural elements with potential capacity to regulate gene transcription. In this study, we have attempted to characterize the region of 235bp for its structural elements, ability to recruit transcriptional factors and encode RNA transcripts. Methods: Mobility shift banding, reporter gene assays to assess the promoter-like activity, RT-PCR and Northern blot hybridization analysis were employed. Results: The data obtained thus far has shown that the examined region of 235bp at the 3\u00a2-flanking b major globin gene sequence: (i) recruits the binding of several proteins; (ii) possesses promoter-like activity that is developmentally regulated; and (iii) encodes at least one RNA molecule encoded at mouse chromosome 3 that contains short direct repeats (SDR) at its 5\u00a2-and 3\u00a2-ends. Moreover, this RNA transcript shares the same identical 108bp sequence previously identified at the 5\u00a2-end of a B1 element located within the 235bp region. Conclusions: Overall, the results presented indicate that the 235bp sequence contains structural elements with potential to drive gene transcription, whereas treatment of MEL cells with methylation inhibitors activates the transcription of a region at chromosome 3. The role of these events in the blockade of commitment to erythroid differentiation of MEL cells is discussed.",

Fukami Kobe University, Kobe, JAPAN Introductions: Bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP) has found the widest applications in molecular biology and biotechnology. It is universally used for in vivo and in vitro transcription of genes put under the control of T7RNAP promoter. Recently, T7RNAP is increasingly employed for high-throughput protein expression aimed at establishing protein structure and structure-based drug development. Methods: To facilitate quantification of T7RNAP activity, we developed a highly sensitive, luciferase-based coupled-enzyme assay. Chemiluminescence in this system was dependent on the amount of T7 RNAP in a range extending over three orders of concentration magnitude (0.05-50 ng/assay). Results: Using this assay, the studies have been performed to evaluate the stability of T7RNAP in Xenopus oocytes and Xenopus cell-free system. It has been demonstrated that not only T7RNAP is remarkably stable in the oocyte cytoplasm, but also it can be stimulated, under certain conditions, in the cell-free oocyte and egg extracts. We found that the T7RNAP stimulator is a low molecular weight, thermo-stable substance, which increases the affinity of T7RNAP for DNA template. It is inactivated by proteinase treatment of the extracts, suggesting the presence of a peptide moiety in the stimulator molecule. MALDI TOF mass-spectrometry of the His-tagged T7RNAP incubated in Xenopus egg extracts revealed the presence of several specific peaks in the region of 900-1,700 Da. Currently, their molecular identification is being carried out. Conclusions: Identification of T7RNAP stimulator(s) will help to develop the novel experimental conditions favorable for enhanced transcription with T7RNAP, resulting in more efficient protein production. Methods: Cells were grown in glucose M9 minimal media at 37\u00b0C. CspE levels were estimated by western blot analysis. Results: The CspE expression was found to be considerably lower during stationary phase than in the exponential phase. A drastic reduction in cellular CspE levels was observed when Dibutyryl-cAMP (Db-cAMP) was added to the growth medium during the early exponential phase. Conclusions: cspE is regulated in a growth-phase-dependent manner with the cellular levels of the protein being considerably lower during stationary phase. This down regulation could be due to the increased cAMP levels caused by glucose depletion during stationary phase. Further, the presence of a putative CRP (cAMP receptor protein) binding site in the upstream region of cspE, supports this possibility. This is the first report demonstrating the role of cyclic AMP in the regulation of a cold-shock protein.",

The activation mechanism of 2-5A synthetases in sponges seems to be different from that known for mammals; the known sponge 2-5A synthetase primary structures are highly variable. In this study 2-5A synthetase primary structure of the marine sponge Geodia barretti was determined. Methods: Primers designed against 2-5A synthetase cDNA from the marine sponge Geodia cydonium were used in suboptimal conditions to amplify 2-5A synthetase fragments from G. barretti. The resulting PCR products were sequenced and used to design primers specific to G. barretti 2-5A synthetase. The full-length sequence of G. barretti 2-5A synthetase was elucidated using the RLM RACE method. Multiple sequence alignment with sponge 2-5A synthetases was performed by using ClustalW program. Results: It was possible to obtain the sequence covering the full functional cDNA of the 2-5A synthetase from G. barretti by starting from the primers specific to that from another member of the genus Geodia. Compared to the corresponding sequence from G. cydonium, the coding sequence had approximately 75% identity on the amino acid level, the nucleotide substitutions being randomly distributed. Conclusions: The comparison of the coding sequences from two species of Geodia revealed their degree of similarity, close to that between higher vertebrates, e.g. human and pig. The further studies of gene regulation and activation mechanisms of sponge 2-5A synthetases will lead us to understanding the role(s) of these enzymes in sponges which may be totally different from that in higher vertebrates.",

While it is known that loss of APE1 expression is associated to significant biological effects, the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes are still not completely known. By using an unbiased approach, we combined both mRNA expression profiling and proteomics to define the molecular changes associated with APE1 loss-of-expression by siRNA technology. This approach identified the influence of APE1 on apoptosis, cell growth, intracellular redox state, mitochondrial function and cytoskeletal structure. To dissect both direct and indirect effects, we performed knock-in experiments with wild type and different APE1 mutants. Two of them (i.e. C65S and C310S) were able to rescue mitochondrial depolarisation and cytoskeleton perturbation but not cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These findings indicate that the wild-type APE1 protein has structural components that function in several distinct central cellular roles and strongly support the notion that, besides its DNA-repair activity, additional functions of APE1 are important for cell viability. Our data highlight the molecular reasons for the multifunctional nature of APE1 protein, providing the basis for future studies on the comprehension of the causal role played by APE1 in regulating different biological mechanisms through the control of signal transduction and gene expression.",

In response to cold stress, Arabidopsis thaliana induce the expression of COR genes by the action of the CBF transcription factors. CBFs might require the function of co-activators ADA2b and GCN5, members of the histone acetyltransferase SAGA complex (Vlachonasios et al., Plant Cell 2003; 15: 626-638). Here, we investigated the role of ADA2b in the induction of COR genes upon salt stress. Methods: RT-PCR analysis used to determine the expression levels of several COR genes in ada2b-1 mutants in response to salt stress. Moreover, we performed ChIP assays, using H3Ac antibodies, at the promoters of COR genes to examine histone acetylation patterns in ada2b-1 mutants upon salt stress. Results: COR genes were induced at a high level 3 hours after onset of the stress in wild type plants. In ada2b-1, RD29b, RAB18 and COR6.6 were induced at a lower level. At the promoters of RD29b, RAB18 and COR6.6 genes, H3 acetylation levels remained constant or slightly increased upon salt stress in wild type, while in ada2b-1 were generally lower, suggesting that ADA2b is required for the H3 acetylation in salt-induced gene expression. Conclusions: For some of the COR genes studied, there was a positive correlation between H3 acetylation and expression levels upon salt stress. ADA2b could act as a positive regulator of H3 acetylation in response to salt stress.",

Although in yeast TAF5 is an essential gene, in Arabidopsis, homozygous taf5-1 mutants are viable and exhibit developmental phenotypes. All three heterozygous mutants showed folded cauline leaves and reduced length of inflorescence compared to wildtype plants. Moreover, taf5-1 homozygous plants dipslayed a terminal flower phenotype; characterized by a shoot meristem convertion to a terminal flower in long and short days unlike the wild type plants, where they grow indefinitely, never differentiating and only finally senescing.

Biol., Sch. of Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, GREECE Introduction: Carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) intoxification in mice is a widely used model for acute liver injury. Mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow (MSCs) might have the potential to ameliorate CCL4 effect into hepatocytes. This study aimed to investigate the effect of MSC supernatant on primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes after CCL4-induced acute liver injury. Methods: Mice were treated intraperitoneally with 2 ml/kg CCL4 and after 24 hour intact viable hepatocytes were isolated by liver perfusion and were cultured for 6 days in defined medium. MSC from bone marrow were cultured to passage 4 and their supernatant was collected and was supplemented to the hepatocyte primary cultures. RT-PCR of albumin, HNF4 and GDF15 were performed. Apoptosis was detected by FCM analysis of annexinV-FITC staining of hepatocytes. Results: Expression of the hepatic markers albumin and HNF4 was observed in the hepatocytes cultures. Flow cytometric analysis of hepatocytes stained with annexin-V demonstrated that hepatocytes from CCL4-treated mice supplemented with MSC supernatant exhibited lower levels of apoptosis at day 3 of culture as compared to non-supplemented (0.14% vs. 0.99%, p = 0.037). Furthermore the expression of growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a member of the TGF-b family, which is upregulated in liver injury and its role has not yet been elucidated, was detected in culture day 1 in CCl4-treated hepatocytes independently of the presence of MSC supernatant. Introduction: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) acts as the central angiogenic factor in both physiological and pathological conditions through binding to its cell surface receptors. Soluble VEGF receptors, soluble Flt-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble neuropilin-1 (sNRP-1), are potent angiostatic factors, which trap extracellular VEGF. We previously found that human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) express sFlt-1 and sNRP-1 and they have crucial roles in the autocrine regulation of angiogenesis [1] . sFlt-1 and sNRP-1 mRNAs are produced by alternative 3'-end processing from the same genes that produce the cell surface receptors. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of alternative 3'-end processing of VEGF receptor pre-mRNAs are poorly understood. Methods: The cleavage/polyadenylation sites of sFlt-1 mRNA were determined by 3'-RACE method using HMVEC RNA. The Flt-1 minigene was constructed by inserting a DNA fragment containing exon 12-exon 14 of human Flt-1 gene into a pCIneo expression vector. Results: We determined the alternative 3'-end processing sites in the intron 13 sequence of sFlt-1 pre-mRNA and established an assay system for sFlt-1 pre-mRNA alternative 3'-end processing with the human Flt-1 mini-gene. Using this system with site-directed mutant minigenes, we identified cis-acting elements on sFlt-1 pre-mRNA, which can be involved in the regulation of alternative 3'-end processing. We also identified RNA binding proteins that can affect the generation of the soluble-type RNA. Conclusions: The present study unveiled a molecular mechanism for the regulation of alternative 3'-end processing of VEGF receptor pre-mRNAs in vascular endothelial cells. Introduction: The mammalian complement system is a phylogenetically ancient cascade system that has a major role in innate and adaptive immunity. Activation of component C3 is central to the three complement pathways, leading to the terminal Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) and results in inflammation and elimination of self and non-self targets. Recent evidences have shown that C3 is also implicated in tissue regeneration and cell differentiation. Methods and Results: In order to study the spatial and temporal mRNA expression profile of MAC components (C6, C7, C8a, C8b, and C8c) and MAC regulatory genes (CD59, clusterin and vitronectin) as well as the potential developmental regulation of C3 gene, chicken (Galus gallus) was used as a model organism. Concerning the MAC components, our results show a full expression of MAC genes in the heart, brain and liver, while their developmental expression patterns show that all of them are expressed in both 12 and 17 day embryo, while no expression was observed in early embryo (day 6) and the neonatal individual (day 2). On the contrary, both MAC regulatory genes and C3 are expressed in whole embryo (day 4 and 6) and in the liver of a 12 and 17 day embryo, as well as in postnatal individual (day 2 and 5) and adult organism. Further studies by in situ hybridization show a highly differential distribution of C3 mRNA in chick embryo. Conclusion: This is the first report on the spatial and temporal expression of complement genes (C3, C6-C8, CD59, clusterin and vitronectin) in chicken. Introduction: Survivin belongs to the family of the inhibitors of apoptosis and has a role in cell division and proliferation. There are at least five isoforms of survivin which seem to have opposing roles regarding apoptosis and may be necessary for the regulation of the action of survivin. In the present study, the relationship between the expression of four of the isoforms of survivin and the promoter polymorphism -31G/ C was assessed in colon cancer. Methods: Blood and colonic tissue (neoplastic and normal) was obtained from 46 patients with primary colon cancer. Survivin, survivin-2B, survivin-dEx3 and Survivin-2a mRNA levels in tissue samples were assessed with quantitative RT-PCR. The promoter polymorphism -31G/C was detected in DNA from the blood samples with real time PCR. Results: All isoforms were expressed in higher levels in neoplastic tissue compared to normal (P < 0.001). Regarding the -31G/C polymorphism, 52.2% (24/46) of the patients were heterozygotes and 43.4% (20/46) homozygotes GG, while CC were only 4.4% (2/46). In neoplastic tissues, the presence of the C allele correlated with higher levels of expression of the isoforms studied (not statistically significant for survivin) although there was no difference in the levels in the normal tissue. Conclusions: All isoforms are over-expressed in neoplastic tissue. The G allele was more frequently detected than the C and it correlates with lower expression levels of survivin-2B, -dEx3 and -2a in neoplastic tissue. Introduction: The transcription factors peroxisome-proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) were recently identified in fish and, like mammals, may to be involved in lipid homeostasis and also in the innate immune response. Herein, we investigate the regulation of the expression of PPARs in immunological and metabolic challenges in fish. Methods: PPAR expression was studied after an in vivo 72 hours lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection (6 mg/kg body weight) in sea bream (Sparus aurata). Moreover, sea bream PPAR expression was studied after a 24 hours insulin (17 U/kg body weight) administration and after a fasting/refeeding experiment. The expression of PPARs was studied by Real-Time PCR. Results: In most tissues, LPS administration resulted in an overall decrease in the expression of PPARs. Most prominently, LPS decreased the expression of PPARa, b, and c in liver and gills and of PPARa and PPARb in red and white muscle. In contrast, the expression of all three PPARs was up-regulated in adipose tissue. Insulin increased the hepatic expression of PPAR a and diminished PPARc, while in anterior intestine PPARa expression was decreased. Fasting decreased the expression of PPARc and refeeding reversed this effect in liver, red and white muscle. However, fasting increased the expression of PPARb in white and red skeletal muscle but decreased after refeeding. Conclusions: The expression of PPAR isoforms in fish is regulated by immune, nutritional, and hormonal factors, indicating that PPARs may play a role in the innate immune response and metabolic regulation in fish.

Emma Department of Nephrology and Urology, Nephrology Division, 'Bambino Gesu' Children's Hospital, Rome, ITALY Introduction: The human CTNS gene encodes for the cystinosin protein that mediates the efflux of cystine from lysosomes and cause, when mutated, nephropathic cystinosis. In this work, we have studied the role of the CTNS gene in the redox pathway using the HK2 Human Kidney cell line. Methods: GSH/GSSG and Cys/CySS ratios were measured by HPLC, ROS production by FACS/Flow cytometry and CTNS gene expression by RT-PCR. Results: Cystine and methionine deprivation resulted in decreased GSH/GSSG (from 64 \u00b1 5.7 to 13.5 \u00b1 0.7) and Cys/CySS (from 35.6 \u00b1 5 to 9.9 \u00b1 3.1) ratios, in increased ROS production (from 33.7 \u00b1 0.5 to 57 \u00b1 5) and in increased CTNS gene expression (from 0.41 \u00b1 0.07 to 0.91 \u00b1 0.14), at 24 and 48 hours. The same effects were obtained with tert-butyl hydroperoxide and buthionine sulfoximine, which oxidate glutathione or inhibit its synthesis, respectively. CTNS over-expression and RNA silencing did not influenced cell redox state. Conclusions: These results show that changes of thiol/disulfide couples induce the transcription of the CTNS gene. We speculate that CTNS plays a crucial role in supplying cells with cystine, directly for the Cys/CySS redox couple, or indirectly for glutathione synthesis. This is also supported by the presence of ARE sequences (Antioxidant Responsive Element) in the CTNS gene.",

Wieser Department for Medical Genetics, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, AUSTRIA The EVI1 gene codes for a zinc finger protein with important roles in embryonic development and in myeloid leukemogenesis. It is transcribed into several mRNA species with variable 5\u00a2-ends. One of these mRNA variants, MDS1/EVI1, gives rise to an EVI1 protein with an extended N-terminus and with functions partially different from those of the shorter EVI1 protein type. The other EVI1 5\u00a2-end variants are most likely translated into the same protein, i.e. the short EVI1 protein variant, but their variable 5\u00a2-UTRs can be expected to affect the regulation of protein expression. So far all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is the only known physiological regulator of EVI1 in mammalian cells. Using the teratocarcinoma cell line NT-2, we have investigated the induction of EVI1 by ATRA. Time course analyses showed that ATRA rapidly induces the EVI1 mRNA in NT-2 cells. A maximum is reached after approximately 48 hours, except for the MDS1/EVI1 mRNA, which was noticeably induced only after 48 hours. This response was already detectable with as little as 10 nM ATRA and affected all EVI1 mRNA variants, albeit to variable degrees. Using reporter gene assays, an ATRA responsive region of 200 bp was identified within exon 1a of EVI1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments confirmed the binding of retinoic acid receptors RAR and RXR to a retinoic acid response element (RARE) in this region. We conclude that the EVI1 gene is a direct target of retinoic acid signaling and that its regulation via this pathway is mediated through an intragenic RARE. Chitosanases catalyze the hydrolysis of chitosan, a polymer of beta-1,4 D-glucosamine (GlcN). Chitosanases from Streptomyces sp. N174 (CsnN174) and Kitasatospora sp. N106 (CsnN106) were extensively studied. They are efficiently produced in the industrial heterologous host Streptomyces lividans. However, few works were dedicated to the regulation of csn gene expression. A palindromic sequence is observed up-stream the coding sequences of CsnN174 and CsnN106. Similar boxes are present in the genomes of several actinomycetes, mostly upstream genes encoding other chitosanases, such as sco0677 in S. coelicolor A3(2) and its ortholog in S. lividans but also up-stream the gene sco2657, encoding a transcription regulator belonging to the ROK family. sco2657 is the first gene of a six-gene operon probably involved in the transport of GlcN oligosaccharides. To find if the ROK protein was involved in csn gene regulation, we performed gene disruption of the sco2657 homolog (W2657h) in S. lividans. An electrophoretic shift of the palindromic box was observed with crude extracts from GlcNinduced cultures of S. lividans while it was absent using extracts from disruption mutants. An N-terminal His 6 -tagged version of the ROK protein was expressed in E. coli and purified. The recombinant ROK exhibited binding to the palindromic box as tested by EMSA. Binding of the ROK protein to the palidromic box in vitro is affected by the presence of GlcN or chitosan pentamer indicating that ROK is probably a repressor. Binding of ROK is also observed to the palindromic boxes of the heterologous genes encoding CsnN106 and CsnN174.",

However, much data have been published recently pointing to a key role of the progesterone receptor (PR) in normal and breast cancer formation.

BRCA1 also inhibits the transcriptional activity of endogenous PR. Using RNAi against BRCA1 we enhanced the transcription of several PR-target genes and the over-expression caused their down-regulation.

Introduction: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women in the western world. Plants are important sources of active natural products which differ widely in terms of structure and biological properties. They have a remarkable role in the traditional medicine in different countries. Pistacia atlantica wih local name of Baneh (Annacardiaceae) is growing in parts of Iran, which has been used traditionally in the treatment of peptic ulcer and various diseases. In this study we evaluated the effects of extract on gene expression of p53 and Men1 as tumor suppressor genes and CCND1 as an oncogenen in T-47D cell line. Methods: Cytotoxicity of extract on T-47D cells was determined by MTT assay in comparison to RPMI and Doxorubicin (DOX). In addition, total cellular RNA was isolated from T-47D treated cells with Baneh 1 mg/ml (EC 50 ), DOX (250 nM) and RPMI using Trizol. RNA samples were reverse transcribed to cDNA and PCR amplified using thermal cycler.Results were then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Results: Baneh extract at 1 mg/ml showed significant growth inhibitory effects on proliferation of T-47D cells. Extract also showed significant decrease in mRNA levels of CCND1, Men1 and p53 in comparison to RPMI and DOX when data normalized to b-actin. Conclusions: The extract of Baneh has significant anti-proliferative effect (time and concentration dependent) against T-47D cells. Growth rate of cells significantly reduced following treatment with Baneh extract similar to DOX in comparison to RPMI. The level of gene expression (CCND1, Men1 and p53) showed significant decrease.",

In the present study, we further examined the molecular mechanism involved. Using various deletion mutants of a luciferase reporter driven by Glut1 promoter and enhancer 1 and 2, we identified a specific region on enhancer 2 as essential for the synergistic effect of ET-1 and cAMP on Glut1 transcription. By employing inhibitory agents to suppress the activities of corresponding putative transcription factors in this region, mutation of the putative responsive sites, chromatin immunoprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we were able to demonstrate that a ternary complex containing Sp1, pCREB and AP-1 was mediating the synergistic effect of ET-1 and cAMP on Glut1 transcription. The results also suggest that while an increase in nuclear Sp1 is induced by ET-1, the accumulation of nuclear pCREB is only found in the presence of cAMP. An increase in nuclear AP-1, on the other hand, can be achieved by both ET-1 and cAMP. Of interest is the finding that ET-1 alone may induce the formation of NF-jB/Sp1/AP-1 complex; however, in the simultaneous presence of cAMP, NF-jB in the complex is replaced by pCREB. In concord, ET-1 activation of NF-jB was suppressed by cAMP. Taken together, our results indicate that ET-1 and cAMP together provide a circumstance favoring the formation of nuclear Sp1/AP-1/pCREB complex that may facilitate the transcription of Glut1 gene.",

Coombes and J. Stebbing Department of Medical Oncology, Imperial College, Hammersmith Campus, London, UK Introduction: Approximately half of estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancers develop resistance to tamoxifen, usually caused by its phosphorylation. Transcriptional activation occurs through at least two distinct transactivation domains located in the amino-terminal A/B region (AF-1) and the carboxy terminal E region of the receptor (AF-2). The AF-1 domain is hormone-independent, whereas the AF-2 domain is ligand-dependent. Both AF domains are required for maximal ERa transcriptional activity. It has been shown that ERa can be phosphorylated at serine residues (Ser104, Ser106, Ser118, Ser167, Ser236) by protein kinases, (including MAPK, Rsk, Cdk2, Akt, PKA) which influence the recruitment of co-activators resulting in ERmediated transactivation. Methods: Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), using RNA interference (RNAi), has become a useful technique for targeted gene knockdown by introduction of siRNA into cells. A systematic mediumthroughput RNAi screening, has been performed in order to search for prospective protein kinases that are able to phosphorylate and/or modulate ERa. Results: We have identified a novel kinase that is able to phosphorylate ERa in vitro and up-regulate its transcriptional activity in a direct and/or indirect way. Interestingly, inhibition of this kinase resulted in stabilisation of ERa protein levels and decrease of proliferation as demonstrated in MCF7 cells. Conclusions: Since phosphorylation of ERa has been shown to be important for the stimulation of its transcriptional activity, focusing on the role of kinases and the influence of site specific phosphorylation events in modulating ERa's activity is considered essential.",

Chromatin immunoprecipitations show that bile acids promote the recruitment on CYP7A1 promoter of a repressive complex containing the histone deacetylases (HDAC) 7, 1, 3 and the corepressor SMRT, that affects the transcriptional activity of HNF-4, a strong activator of CYP7A1. By laser confocal microscopy we found that bile acids increase the nuclear localization of HDAC7. By siRNA assays we found that HDAC7 is the key factor required for the repression of CYP7A1 transcription. In vivo administration of the HDAC inhibitors, valproic acid (VPA) or trichostatin A (TSA), to hypercholesterolemic Lld-r KO mice derepresses Cyp7a1 transcription and increases cholesterol conversion to bile acids consequently reducing total plasma and LDL cholesterol. HDACs inhibitors also display effects in extrahepatic tissues: VPA and TSA increase the number and the oxidative activity of mitochondria in skeletal muscle cells, in adipocytes and in hepatocytes, thus favoring the catabolism of fatty acids in these cells. In conclusion our study highlights the importance of HDACs in the regulation of CYP7A1 gene transcription and identifies HDACs as potential targets to modulate bile acid synthesis and lipid homeostasis. HER2/ErbB2 over-expression is associated with tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor a (ERa)-positive breast tumors. This is thought to be due to modifications of ERa activity leading to alteration of estrogen/ antiestrogen-triggered changes in the expression of estrogen target genes. However, since the link between estrogen effects on cell proliferation and on gene expression is still a matter of debate, we evaluated in detail the effects of HER2 over-expression on the growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and correlated these effects with changes in the expression of three estrogen-target genes regulated by ER through different mechanisms: pS2, involving direct binding of ER to Estrogen Responsive Element (ERE), cyclin D1 (CCND1), involving Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) and IEX-1 (linked to apoptosis), involving Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NFjB). HER2-over-expressing cells displayed higher proliferation rate, estrogen-independent growth and reduced sensitivity to estradiol and tamoxifen. Furthermore, while the regulation of the CCND1 and IEX-1 genes in HER2 over-expressing cells exhibited consistency with the growth characteristics of these cells, this was not the case for EREdependent gene regulation. Our results point to the IEX-1 gene as a potentially interesting marker of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells. They also suggest that HER2-associated tamoxifen resistance is not likely to be only due to alterations of classical ERE-dependent gene transcription, but also of the activities of other transcription factors co-operating with ERa, such as AP-1 and NFjB, which might thus be considered as potential new targets for breast cancer treatment.",

Met is one of proposed and very probable candidate for this function. It has been shown that Met belongs to the family of bHLH-PAS transcription factors. Their functional activity often is correlated with shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm according to the masking and unmasking, by interacting partners, signals directing this proteins to nuclear or cytoplasmic compartment of the cell. The first report concerning Drosophila melanogaster Met has informed about localization of this protein in cytoplasm. Later on it has been shown as nuclear protein by in vivo immunostaining of Drosophila tissues and by using chimeric proteins with GFP in S2 cells. Till now, no NLS and NES motifs has never been elucidated for Met. Methods: In order to determine the sequences of nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and nuclear export signals (NESs), series of deletion and point mutants tagged by yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) were prepared by cloning in to EYFP-C1 vector and expressed in mammalian cells. Mithramycin is one of the oldest chemotherapy drugs used for decades. It is a DNA-binding agent and has been found to play a role in the increase of foetal haemoglobin (HbF) in erythroid Burst Forming Units (BFUe) in normal individuals. Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is a transcription factor involved in gene expression in the early development of an organism. It is generally known as a ubiquitous activator; however increased binding of Sp1 to the c-globin gene promoter upon site-specific cytosine methylation indicates the possible functional role of Sp1 as a repressor of c-globin synthesis. Some correlation has been found between Mithramycin and Sp1 since both seem to bind at GC rich sites on the genome. Activation of the c-globin gene by Mithramycin and repression by Sp1 has lead to the theory that these two may act as antagonists. With the goal to dissect the molecular mechanisms of action of Mithramycin, in the current study we used chromatin immunoprecipitations to identify whether a direct effect was involved in activating the c-globin gene, or if activation was induced through suppression of Sp1. This was assessed by exploring the binding activities of Sp1 in BFUe cells that were not treated and BFUe cells that were treated with Mithramycin. Our results indicate that treatment of cells with Mithramycin reduces or even suppresses the binding of Sp1 on the c-promoter, thus revealing a new mechanism of c-globin gene activation and subsequent production of foetal haemoglobin which may lead to an improvement in the treatment of b-thalassaemia and other haemoglobinopathies.",

Focussing on elucidation of the ecdysteroid structure-activity relationships, this work contributes to improve our understanding of the structural features determining the molecular recognition between the EcR and ecdysteroid ligands, and therefore may be useful for a rational design of novel EcR-based gene-switch actuators. GILZ is an ubiquitous protein whose expression is induced by glucocorticoids in thymocytes and peripheral T-lymphocytes. We showed that GILZ expression is rapidly and transiently induced upon IL-2deprivation of the T-cell line CTLL-2, protecting these cells from the onset of apoptosis. This protection is conferred through inhibition of FoxO3 transcriptional activity, resulting in down-regulation of proapoptotic Bim expression. Nuclear import of FoxO factors follows stress signals such as oxidative stress or growth factor-deprivation, leading to up-regulation of target genes (bim, fasl), whereas nuclear export mainly results from Protein Kinase B phosphorylation. The aim of this work was to determine the mechanism of FoxO factors inhibition by GILZ. First, we showed that GILZ inhibits FoxO1, FoxO3 and FoxO4 transcriptional activities in the acute promyelocytic leukaemia cells HL60 independently of PKB phosphorylation, suggesting that GILZ is a general inhibitor of FoxO factors with an original mechanism of action. We demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy that GILZ is mainly cytoplasmic in HL60 cells and identified a Nuclear Export signal which appears to be functional and Crm-1-dependent. Experiments using cytoplasmic and nuclear GILZ mutants suggested that GILZ cytoplasmic localization is a pre-requisite for FoxO3 inhibition.",

PPAR-gamma plays a key role in adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitivity. In the present study, we show that amorphastilbol leads to adipocyte differentiation through the trans-activation of PPAR-gamma in 3T3-L1 cells. Methods: An established luciferase reporter gene assay system was used to test trans-activation of amorphastilbol to human PPARgamma. Fluorescence polarization (FP) ligand binding assay was based on purified recombinant human PPAR-gamma ligand-binding domain and a selective fluorescent PPAR-gamma ligand. EC 50 values (concentrations at which 50% of the fluorescent ligand is displaced) was determined for amorphastilbol by measuring millipolarization values for a series of concentrations. To further characterized the effects of amorphastilbol on differentiation, cellular triglyceride content and GPDH enzyme activity were measured. And we observed the changes of C/ EBP alpha, PPAR-gamma, aP2, adiponectin and resistin mRNA by using RT-PCR and Real-time PCR. Results: Amorphastilbol was determined to be a novel PPAR-gamma agonist because it strongly induced luciferase activity on human PPARgamma and directly bind to PPAR-gamma LBD (EC 50 = 1.26 uM). Amorphastilbol enhances adipocyte differentiation as evidenced by increased triglyceride accumulation, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity. Using RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR analyses, we also confirmed that amorphastilbol increased the expression of genes critical for acquisition of adipocyte phenotype. Conclusions: We suggested that amorphastilbol is a novel agonist of PPAR-gamma and may be beneficial for reducing insulin resistance through its potency to regulate adipocyte differentiation.",

Methods and results: Gene expression profiling performed on liver of 2-day-old pups revealed up-regulation of PPARa responsive genes in knockout mice. Surprisingly, also genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis were markedly induced. Real-time PCR confirmed the induction of PPARa target genes and of HMGCR and SREBP2, both involved in cholesterol synthesis, as well in 2-day-old pups as in adults. In accordance, the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis was markedly increased in liver of knockout mice but the hepatic cholesterol concentration was unaltered. In PPARa/MFP2 double knockout mice, upregulations of SREBP2 and HMGCR were less pronounced suggesting a link between PPARa induction and cholesterol synthesis. Conclusion: These data indicate that impaired peroxisomal b-oxidation causes an accumulation of PPARa ligands in the intact animal and a concomitant up-regulation of genes of cholesterol biosynthesis through increased expression of SREBP2. Since the hepatic cholesterol concentration was not different between the genotypes, it appears that the up-regulation was not triggered by a reduced level of cholesterol, neither resulted in increased cholesterol levels.",

The promoter region of the nur77 gene contains four near AP-1 (NAP) sites 5'-TGCGTCA. Results of Yoon & Lau [1] supported the hypothesis that JunD, but not CREB, binding to two proximal NAP elements is responsible for induction of the transcription of nur77 in response to nerve growth factor. However, the results of the present study indicate that A-CREB (the dominant negative mutant of CREB) inhibits the activation of the nur77 promoter in response to the activation of TrkC. In conclusion it is suggested that activation of the nur77 promoter in response to neurotrophins requires the co-operation of both CREB and JunD. PP2B-20 Genome-wide location of glucocorticoid receptor binding sites Introduction: Glucocorticoids (GCs) are essential steroid hormones that regulate a variety of physiological processes including growth, differentiation, programmed cell death, glucose homeostasis and protein, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. GCs exert their functions through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand inducible transcription factor that binds to a variety of promoter elements, including glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), and regulates gene transcription in a cell-specific manner. The mechanisms by which GR selectively regulates cell-specific transcription and the global networks regulated by GR are not well established. In the present study we mapped the human GR binding sites on a genome-wide scale. Methods: To identify the global profile of GR binding sites we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), with a monoclonal antibody against GR, combined with either hybridization on genomic microarrays covering the entire genome (ChIP-on-chip) or massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq). Results: We mapped the genome-wide GR binding sites in immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) and HeLa cells and identified known and novel cis regulatory elements and target genes in cell-specific contexts. This study revealed the presence of GR binding sites in previously un-explored regions of the genome as well as networks of transcription factors underlying glucocorticoid signalling. Our data demonstrated distinct mechanisms of glucocorticoid-mediated gene regulation and shed light on the global networks modulated by GR. Conclusions: Analysis of GR chromatin occupancy in human genome substantially contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms and molecular networks underlying the diverse biological effects of glucocorticoids.",

In this study, we demonstrate that stimulation of CD40, a TNF receptor family member with a pivotal role in adaptive and innate immunity, rapidly induces the expression of IRF-1 in carcinoma cells. Using a combination of small molecule kinase inhibitors, RNA interference and CD40 mutagenesis approaches, we show that p65 (RelA) NF-jB but not MAPK signaling is required for the CD40 ligand-induced up-regulation of IRF-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel-shift assays demonstrated recruitment of p65 NF-jB to the IRF-1 promoter. When fused to a luciferase reporter gene, the IRF-1 promoter responds to CD40 stimulation whereas mutations which abolish NF-jB binding render it unresponsive. Evaluation of NF-jB pathway components suggests the involvement of TAK1, IKKb and IjBa in IRF-1 promoter regulation. NF-jB and de novo synthesized IRF-1 converge to regulate immunoproteasome gene expression, as evident by the recruitment of both transcription factors to the promoter regions of transporter for antigen processing (TAP)-1, TAP-2, tapasin and the low molecular mass polypeptide (LMP)-2 and LMP-10. Moreover, the RNA interference-mediated knock-down of IRF-1 reduced, whereas inhibition of NF-jB abolished the effects of CD40 on TAP-1 up-regulation. Collectively, these data reveal a novel mechanism of IRF-1 induction by CD40 which ensures that IRF-1 functions concurrently with NF-jB to facilitate immunoproteasome gene transcription.",

Ushio Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, Tokyo, JAPAN Adiponectin has been postulated to play an important role in the modulation of glucose and lipid metabolisms in insulin-sensitive tissues in mammals. Adiponectin secreted from adipocytes and circulating in blood forms a wide range of multimers from trimers and hexamers to high molecular weight (HMW) multimers, and the ratios among them are closely correlated with insulin sensitivity. Rice bran contains a lot of plant sterols and their ferulic acid esters as compared with other plant oil. It is reported that the phytosteryl ferulates have the LDL cholesterol lowering effect in some mammals. We have recently demonstrated that phytosteryl ferulates enhance adiponectin secretion from adipocytes. In this study, we have investigated the effect of phytosteryl ferulates on the adiponectin multimers secreted from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Mouse 3T3-L1 cells differentiated to adipocytes were treated with phytosteryl ferulates. The culture media was subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing, non-heat-denaturing conditions, followed by western blotting with anti-adiponectin antibody. Phytosteryl ferulates restrictedly enhanced the HMW multimers secretion of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, while monomer, trimer and hexamer secretions were relatively low, compared to pioglitazone, a PPAR gamma agonist. The results suggest that phytosteryl ferulates might regulate adiponectin multimer formation in part through pathways different from thiazolidine diones. Phytosteryl ferulates might thus prevent and/or ameliorate the type 2 diabetes and its related metabolic syndromes. The family of proteins TSC-22D (Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b)-stimulated clone-22 Domain) is constituted by GILZ (Glucocorticoid-Induced Leucine Zipper), TSC-22 (TGF-b)-stimulated clone-22) and THG-1 (TSC-22 Homologous Gene-1). These proteins have both a TSC box and a leucine zipper domain, allowing them to homodimerize or hetero-dimerize. We have shown before that GILZ inhibits FoxO3 activity leading to inhibition of bim expression and apoptosis. As these homologous proteins have the ability to interact, we hypothesized that TSC-22 and THG-1 are able, like GILZ, to inhibit FoxO3 activity. We determined by RT-PCR the expression of GILZ, TSC-22, and THG-1 in different tissues of human origin and in tumour cell lines. THG-1, GILZ, and TSC-22 are present in all the tissues tested. THG-1 mRNA is expressed in all tumour cell lines tested whereas GILZ mRNA and TSC-22 mRNA are deficient in CTLL-2 and Kit 225 T lymphocytes that need IL-2 for their proliferation. The ubiquitous expression of TSC-22D proteins suggests an endogenous role in FoxO3 activity regulation. We then over-expressed TSC-22 and FoxO3 in HL60 cells to measure the transcriptional activity of FoxO3, using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results showed that TSC-22 inhibits FoxO3 activity measured using a synthetic IRS promoter composed of three FHRE binding sites. We analysed also the expression of FoxO3 target genes in cells over-expressing TSC-22 or GILZ as a positive control. The following genes were selected: bim, p27, puma, and MnSOD. Preliminary results showed that in CTLL-2 cells, IL-2 deprivationinduced bim was repressed in the presence of TSC-22 or GILZ. Geranylgeranoic acid (GGA) and (R)-2,3-dihydrogeranylgeranoic acid (R-2,3-diGGA) are geranylgeraniol-derived metabolites. We examined their effects on HL-60 cells. The cells were differentiated into neutrophils by the former stimulation like retinoic acid stimulation. In the case of cells stimulated with the latter, neutrophils were not detected, but the formation of lipid droplets was induced. On the other hand, when the cells were cultured in the presence of 0.1% FBS instead of 10% FBS, apoptotic cells were induced not only by GGA stimulation but also with R-2,3-diGGA. In the latter case, when the cells were cultured in the co-presence of a caspase-3 inhibitor, the lipid droplets formation was observed in the cells. These results suggest that GGA and R-2,3-diGGA are extremely different from each other with respect to their effects on HL-60 cells. To further understand the difference, we chemically synthesized several GGA derivatives including 4,8,12,16-tetramethyl-heptadeca-3,7,11,15-tetraenoic acid (homo-GGA). As a result, homo-GGA did not induce the cell differentiation into neutrophils but the lipid droplets formation was induced as observed in the case of R-2,3-diGGA stimulation. In the case of S-2,3-diGGA stimulation, the lipid droplets formation was similarly induced and in this case unusual morphology was observed. These results are discussed in the context of the relationship between structures of GGA derivatives and their effects on cells.",

Therefore, aim of this study was to find novel compounds able to activate both receptors. We analyzed two enantiomeric ureidrofibrate derivates, (S)-1 and (R)-1. By using cell-based reporter assays and co-activator recruitment assays we show that the (R)-1 is a full agonist whereas the (S)-1 is a partial agonist of PPARc. We also provide a molecular explanation for the different behavior as full and partial agonists of PPARc by reporting the crystal structures of PPARc ligand-binding domain respectively complexed with the Rand the S-enantiomer. The analysis of the two crystal structures shows that the different degree of stabilization of the helix 12 induced by the ligand determines its behavior as full or partial agonist. The comparison of the two structures of the complexes with the partial agonist reveals significant differences and is suggestive of the possible coexistence in solution of transcriptionally active and inactive forms of helix 12 in the presence of a partial agonist. Mutation analysis underscores the key role of Gln 286 in the PPARc activity. Gene expression analysis shows that these ligands increase mRNA levels of typical PPARa and c targets.

Ecdysone acts through a heterodimeric transcription factor comprising ecdysone receptor (ecr) and ultraspiracle to directly regulate transcription of target genes. Insect ecr gene encodes two or three different isoforms (ecr-A, B1, and B2), which share common DNA binding and ligand binding domains, but differ in N-terminal domains. In Drosophila, ecr-B1 is a key molecule to destruct larval tissues during metamorphosis. Although ecr-B1 has been identified from dipteran, lepidopteran and coleopteran insects, it has not been identified from primitive holometabolous insects, hemimetabolous and ametabolous insects, and thus its functions in these insects remain unknown. To gain insights into molecular evolution of ecr-B1, we performed phylogenetic analysis of ecr-B1 in insects. Sequences comparison of ecr-B1 cloned from various insects including ametabolous and hemimetabolous insects first revealed four conserved motifs at the N-terminal region of ecr-B1. Furthermore, the results suggested that motif-level modification occurred during insect evolution: the N-terminus of holometabolous insect ecr-B1 contains a conserved motif, whereas this motif is lacked in the hemimetabolous insect ecr-B1. Additionally, hymenopteran ecr-B1 contains a conserved N-terminal extension just adjacent to the holometabolous insect-speciifc motif. These motifs might function as binding sites of ecr-B1 isoform-specific cofactors, and the motif-level evolution suggests that modification of ecr-B1 mediated transcriptional regulation occurred associated with the insect evolution. Adipocyte differentiation is a highly complicated process and it includes several signaling pathways. Molecular regulation in the very early stage of adipocyte differentiation is not fully appreciated yet. Several inducible genes at the early stage during pre-adipocyte differentiation have been identified, including the regulator of G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2) gene. RGS2 is a member of the RGS protein superfamily, which primarily acts as a negative regulator in G-protein signaling by enhancing the intrinsic GTPase activity of the G alpha subunit. The aim of this study was to clarify the precise RGS2 induction profile and to evaluate the important DNA transcriptional element(s) mediating RGS2 expression in the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. RGS2 mRNA was demonstrated to elevate 1 hour after differentiation initiation and its level remained high until the late stage of differentiation. Meanwhile, the putative 5'-flanking sequence [~3000 base pairs (bp)] of the RGS2 gene was isolated and fused with a luciferase reporter gene. With transient transfection assays, RGS2 promoter activity was provoked 12 hour after inducing differentiation. A sequential deletion and site-directed mutagenesis strategies were adopted to define the critical elements in the RGS2 promoter sequence. The RGS2 promoter could be reduced to 80 bp of the 5'-flanking sequence with the retention of full inducibility by differentiation stimuli. Mutation of a Sp1 site within the 80 bp of RGS2 promoter region significantly blocked the promoter activity. Taken together, our data suggest that RGS2 expression was immediately induced after the initiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation and it remained consistently high through the differentiation process, and the Sp1 site within the 80 bp region appeared as an essential regulatory element for transcriptional activation of RGS2 gene. showed there is also an ARF tumour suppressor pathway that is p53 independent. The ARF protein is localized to both the nucleolar surface and the nucleoplasm. We have analysed the nucleolar protein dynamics of the ARF tumour suppressor pathway using mass-spectrometry-based organellar proteomics and stable isotope labelling, i.e., SILAC. We performed a quantitative analysis of the nucleolar proteome from a human ARF inducible model cell line, called NARF2, and compare this with another ARF inducible cell line, called E6, which lacks functional p53. NARF2 is a stable cell line established from U2OS human osteosarcoma cells. Endogenous ARF expression is prevented in U2OS cells by hyper methylation of the ARF gene promoter region. However, these cells also contain an exogenous, inducible copy of the wild type ARF gene whose expression can be induced in NARF2 cells by addition of IPTG. The E6 cell line was established from the NARF2 cells and expresses the adenoviral E6 protein that deactivates p53. We will present data showing a time course of ARF induction where we use SILAC MS to characterize the responses of over a thousand nucleolar localised proteins, including proteins whose response to ARF is independent of p53.",

Workers are sterile and perform various behaviors to maintain colony activities. Young workers (nurse bees) nurse their brood, while older ones (foragers) forage for nectar and pollen. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the social behavior still remain obscure. To analyze the mechanisms, we used the cDNA microarray to identify a candidate gene, the honeybee homologue of Hormone Receptor-like in 38 (HR38), which encodes an orphan nuclear hormone receptor that mediates ecdysone-signaling. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that HR38expression is higher in forager brains, when compared to nurse bee and queen brains. Furthermore, HR38-expression was enriched in a subset of mushroom body neurons, a higher center in the insect brain, suggesting its role in expression of forager-specific behaviors. In mosquito, HR38 inhibits transcription of vitellogenin (Vg) gene in the fat body before the blood intake. In honeybee, the hemolymph Vg titer elevates in queens and nurse bees, but not in foragers. It will be interesting to test whether HR38 co-operatively inhibits transcription of the Vg gene in the fat body in foragers. Bacterial LPS has been identified as a major cause of septic shock and stimulates macrophages to produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-a. We previously demonstrated the interaction between NF-jB and STAT1 in endotoxin shock model mice, however, it is not fully elucidated the mechanism of the induction of the NF-jB/STAT1 complex. Here we studied the synergistic role of NF-jB and STAT1 in IL-6 production, especially from the viewpoint of phosphorylation. Raw264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with LPS, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and the luciferase reporter assay were performed using NF-jB specific probe and reporter plasmid to characterize functionally the in vitro DNA binding. These demonstrated that LPS induced NF-jB activation and IL-6 promoter activity, which are synergistically enhanced by over-expressed STAT1alpha. Furthermore, over-expressed STAT1 with mutation on tyrosine 701 (STAT1mY) also enhanced LPS-induced NF-jB activation. Together with these results, the cross talk between NF-jB and non-phosphorylated STAT1 complex play an important role for the induction of inflammatory cytokine, which causes endotoxin shock. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Even though the cause of PD remains to be answered, several lines of evidence strongly suggest the involvement of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The major mitochondrial defect in PD appears to be associated with inhibition of respiratory chain complex I activity. 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) has been shown to selectively and potently inhibit complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and induce a syndrome closely resembling PD in cellular model. Okadaic acid is a polyether compound isolated from a black sponge, Halichondria okadai, and is a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of okadaic acid on MPP+ induced apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Treatment of MPP+ induced the loss of cell viability, condensation and fragmentation of nuclei, which was associated with the elevation of ROS level, the increase in Bax/Bcl2 ratio, and the activation of caspase-3. These MPP+ induced phenotypes were reversed by okadaic acid. These results suggested that the protective effects of okadaic acid on MPP+ induced cytotoxicity and okadaic acid might provide a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of progressive neurodegenerative disease.

Dimitrova 1 , K. Kuroha 1 , T. Tatematsu 2 and T. Inada 1,2   1 Nagoya University, Nagoya, JAPAN, 2 JST, PRESTO, Tokyo, JAPAN Poly (A) tail is an important factor in mRNA stability and translation initiation. Another significant role of poly (A) is its involvement in nonstop mRNA quality control where its translation in a poly Lys sequence leads to translation arrest and destabilization of the protein product (1) . In order to study in detail the mechanism by which poly (A) regulates the above-mentioned events we inserted sequences encoding 12 consecutive amino acids (Lys, Arg, Phe, Glu) between two genes (the first lacking a stop codon). Translation arrest was observed only in the case of poly-Lys and poly-Arg and it was followed by degradation of arrest products by the proteasome. Moreover, deletion of NOT4 ubiquitin ligase, a member of the multifunctional Not-Ccr4 complex, led to significant increase of the arrest product which level remained unchanged when a proteasome inhibitor was added. Northern blot analysis suggests that ribosomal arrest might be followed by an endonucleolytic cleavage at a site upstream to the insertion, with the upstream fragment being rapidly digested and the downstream fragment being blocked by the ribosome stalled at its 5\u00a2end. In conclusion, the translation of positively charged amino acids in a row, induces translation arrest, endonucleolytic cleavage and Not4-mediated nascent polypeptide degradation by the proteasome. This mechanism might be another important step utilized by the cell for the control of translational rate and protein level, respectively. Introduction: During translation initiation, the m 7 GpppG structure (CAP) at the 5\u00a2 end of mRNAs is recognized by eIF4E. Through its interaction with eIF4G the eIF4F complex is formed and recruits the ribosome to the mRNA. Two antigenically distinct eIF4F complexes exist in plants. Early reports evidenced differential expression patterns and CAP-binding affinities for these complexes in different plant species. Particularly, eIF(iso)4F is most abundant in maize non-germinated seeds, whereas both, eIF4F and eIF(iso)4F, are equally present in germinated seedlings. Methods: We tested the in vitro translation activity of eIF(iso)4F and eIF4F on the set of stored mRNAs (non-germinated seeds) and newly transcribed mRNAs (24-hour-germinated seeds). Further, we identified novel components of each complex by mass spectrometry (LC/MS/ MS). Results: eIF(iso)4F accounts for most of the translation activity using as substrate the stored mRNA pool, whereas both complexes are active in translating mRNA from 24-hour-germinated seedlings. The heat shock protein HSP101 was identified in the complexes from non-germinated, but not from germinated seedlings. Lipoxigenase LOX1, containing the conserved YXXXXLU. eIF4E binding motif, was identified in complexes from both 0 and 24-hour-germinated seedlings. Initiation complexes resolved through sucrose gradients revealed that HSP101 preferentially associates with RNPs and 48S complex. In addition, It co-elutes from m 7 GTP-Sepharose column along with the eIF(iso)4F complex.",

In this study, we explored expression regulation of Na C in mouse lung. Na C mRNA and protein had low expression at mouse embryonic day (E) 15 in lung. Na C mRNA expression strongly increased from E17 and was highly sustained until mice were mature.

The drop in Na C protein from 6 weeks of age to adult suggested that Na C was post-transcriptionally regulated in developmental stages of mouse lung. 3\u00a2 untranslated region (3\u00a2-UTR) of mouse Na C mRNA is 2-kb length containing several poly A sites and AU rich elements that are bound by RNA binding proteins.

Introduction: Endometriosis defined as the present of endometrial gland and stroma with in the pelvic peritoneum and other extrauterine site, and it has been well characterized as an estrogen dependent disease. The diagnosis of peritoneal endometriosis at the time of laparoscopy is often made by the observation typically black lesion and numerous subtle appearance of peritoneal endometriosis, atypical lesions. Recently, increasing attention has been drawn atypical form of endometriosis. It has been reported that aromatase is expressed highly in endometriosis and is stimulated by prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ). This result in local production of estrogen, which induces PGE 2 formation and make a positive feedback. The aromatase (CYP19) is well known as a key enzyme specifically involved in the conversion of C19 steroid to estrogen and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is the key enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGE 2 . The objective of this study was to compare he aromatase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in two different form of peritoneal endometriotic implants, typical and atypical endometriosis. Methods: Normal peritoneum (n = 18), typical (n = 6) and atypical (n = 7) tissues were collected from 21 women with endometriosis.

Biochemical analyses of the activities of yeast ribosomes carrying sitedirected mutations in 18S rRNA reveal that helices h18, h34 and h44 of 18S rRNA are crucial in protein synthesis. Mutations G517A (rdn2) and C526A (rdn12A) in helix h18 displayed opposite translational phenotypes; rdn2 caused hyperaccuracy and resistance to paromomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic that binds to the ribosomal A-site. In contrast, rdn12A caused infidelity, sensitivity to paromomycin and less efficient enzymatic translocation in the presence of cycloheximide. In helix h34, C1054A (rdn1A) caused infidelity and sensitivity to paromomycin, halved peptidyltransferase activity, an activity of the large ribosomal subunit, and caused less efficient enzymatic translocation; C1054U (rdn1T) caused hyperaccuracy but had no effect on peptidyltransferase activity. Apparently, different substitutions at the same position (C1054) may cause opposite effects. Finally, two mutations in helix h44 of yeast 18S rRNA were investigated. The first, A1491G (rdn15), creates in yeast the same C1409-G1491 base pair as in Escherichia coli and has behaved as an antisuppressor in genetic studies. Ribosomes from rdn15 were errorrestrictive but their peptidyltransferase activity remained unchanged. The second, U1495C (rdnhyg1), was initially isolated as a hygromycin resistant mutation in Tetrahymena thermophila. Ribosomes carrying rdnhyg1 were slightly error prone; they did not affect catalytic activity, but affected translocation, confirming the importance of nucleotide 1495 in the communication between the two ribosomal subunits.",

Target sequences of this protein have been identified in a handful of coding and non-coding RNAs, some of them playing a pivotal role in carcinogenesis. The available data indicate that CRD-BP/IMP1 can affect more than one aspect of the post-transcriptional processes of its RNA targets on a transcript and/or cell-type dependent manner. To further investigate the CRD-BP/IMP1 mode of action, the post-transcriptional effects of two cis elements recognized by this protein i.e. the ones present in the coding regions of c-myc and MDR1 (MultiDrug Resistance1) mRNAs, were tested. Fusion of these elements, in frame, within the coding region or in the 3\u00a2\u00da TR of a reporter luciferase gene, were constructed and transiently transfected in the 293T cell line. Luciferase activity and protein levels, as well as luciferase mRNA levels and stability were determined. The normalized luciferase activity/ mRNA ratio was used as measure of translatability. Both elements when placed either in frame within the coding region or in the 3\u00a2UTR, had little or no effect upon the reporter gene mRNA stability. On the other hand, when placed within the coding region, the c-myc element caused a 50% decrease in translatability while the MDR1 element nearly annihilated translation. On the contrary, these two elements increased reporter gene translatability when present in the 3\u00a2UTR.",

Kubo University of Tokyo, Tokyo, JAPAN Introduction: The honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) is a eusocial insect and the females differentiate into two castes: queens (reproductive caste) and workers (labor caste). In addition, the workers shift their labors from nursing their brood (nurse bees) to foraging for nectar and pollen (foragers) according to their age after eclosion. When the queen is lost from the colony, however, some workers become 'laying workers' whose ovaries develop to lay eggs. Here we investigated whether the physiology of laying workers is more similar to that of nurse bees or foragers by examining the hypopharyngeal gland (HPG) and the hemolymph vitellogenin titers. Methods: In normal colony, nurse bees have well-developed HPGs that synthesize 'major royal jelly proteins' and high vitellogenin titers, whereas foragers have shrunken HPGs that synthesize 'alpha-glucosidase' and low vitellogenin titers. We measured the size of HPG acini and analyzed protein expression pattern of HPG and hemolymph in queenless workers using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Results: In queenless colonies, workers with developed ovaries (putative laying workers) tended to have more developed HPGs and synthesized major royal jelly proteins, whereas workers with shrunken HPGs tended to have undeveloped ovaries and synthesized alpha-glucosidase. Furthermore, the workers with developed ovaries had higher vitellogenin titers than nurse bees, whereas those with undeveloped ovaries had lower vitellogenin titers.",

            "text": "Conclusions: These findings indicate that the physiology of laying workers is similar to that of nurse bees, but opposite that of foragers, suggesting close relation between mechanisms that determine physiology of laying workers and nurse bees. European honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) is a social insect and the workers show highly advanced social behaviors, such as age-related division of labor (age-polyethism) and usage of dance communication. The neural/molecular basis of the honeybee social behaviors, however, remains largely unknown. Honeybee brain is characterized by a welldeveloped higher-order center, mushroom bodies (MBs), whose proportion in the worker alters depending on the division of labor. With the aim to understand the neural/molecular basis underlying the honeybee social behaviors, we performed proteomic analysis to search for proteins expressed selectively in the MBs in the worker brain. Four protein spots were detected in a MB-selective manner by 2-dimentional electrophoresis. These were identified, by LC-MS/MS analysis, as farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase (FAMeT) and juvenile hormone diol kinase (JHDK), which are the enzymes involved in JH biogenesis and metabolism, respectively, and two calcium-binding proteins: calreticulin and reticulocalbin. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that the expression of famet is restricted in the cells localized outer bottom of the MB calyx, while that of jhdk is inside of the MB calyx. Since JH accelerates division of labor of the workers, these results suggest that MBs might be a target of JH effect and different MB cell types are involved in JH biogenesis/metabolism. In addition, the MB-selective expression of calreticulin and reticulocalbin suggest that neural plasticity based on the calcium-signaling is enhanced in the MB neurons, which might be related to the brain functions involved in worker behaviors. Aberrant activation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast tumors results in increased metastasis and reduced survival. Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to HER2 is indicated for patients whose tumor exhibit an amplified copy number and/or overexpression for HER2. The mechanisms of trastuzumab action are not fully understood and resistance to this treatment is frequent. Trastuzumab effect is related in vitro to the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is linked to translational control. Additionally, in some reports activation of HER2 pathway is associated with translation of several genes including CXCR4, VEGF and c-src. Our goal is to evaluate the role of trastuzumab in the regulation of protein synthesis in HER2overexpressing breast tumor cell lines. We demonstate that the trastuzumab-dependent inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway is correlated to the phosphorylation state of a major translation initiation regulator, the eIF4E-BP1 protein. Moreover, trastuzumab treatment leads to a sequestration of eIF4E by its inhibitor eIF4E-BP1, as determined by cap affinity pull-down assays. This results in the disruption of the translation initiation eIF4F complex and therefore in the translational deregulation of several genes. Translationally-regulated genes are identified by using real-time qPCR and Northern Blot on mRNAs isolated from polysomal fractions. In addition, we showed that eIF4E-BP1 phosphorylation was associated with the response to trastuzumab treatment in human breast tumor specimens, indicating that it can be a diagnostical target for treatment orientation. Comprehension of trastuzumab translational regulation and identification of target genes may help us to design therapeutic strategies based on translation mechanisms. a variety of functions inside cells, such  as transcriptional regulation, chromosome replication, protein translocation and degradation, apart from their more traditional role in protein expression. These RNA molecules that never get translated into proteins are called non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Their increasing importance calls for an increasing demand for bioinformatics tools that will allow us to detect them. We perform a genome-wide computational screening for conserved structures and transcriptional signals in Corynebacterium glutamicum, a gram-positive bacterium, important in biotechnology, due to its glutamic acid production capabilities.

Discussion: We suggest a bioinformatics method for finding non-coding RNAs in bacteriaof the genus Corynebacterium. The results are promising and the method could be in the future applied to other bacterial species. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are involved in the pathogenesis of cancer of the cervix (CaCx). HPVs are also associated with a subset of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Interactions between viral and cellular genes are important for the progression of HPV-associated cancers. We analyzed the expression of cellular miR-NAs in HPV-16 positive cervical cell lines and tissues. Using the Ambion MirVana microarrays, we found that 3 miRNAs were overexpressed and 24 underexpressed in cervical cell lines containing integrated HPV-16 DNA compared to the normal cervix. Interestingly, microRNA-218 (miR-218) was specifically underexpressed in cell lines, cervical lesions and cancer tissues containing integrated HPV-16 DNA as compared to both the HPV-negative cell line C-33A and the normal cervix. Expression of the HPV-16 E6 oncogene in transfected cells reduced miR-218 expression, and conversely, RNA interference of E6/ E7 oncogenes in an HPV-16 positive cell line increased miR-218 expression. One of the predicted targets of miR-218 is the epithelialspecific gene LAMB3 which is involved in cell migration and tumorigenicity. The 3\u00a2 untranslated region of LAMB3 mRNA contains a putative target site of miR-218, and exogenous expression of miR-218 in HPV-16 positive cell lines decreased LAMB3 expression at both RNA and protein levels. We have also identified differentially expressed miRNAs in HPV-positive and HPV-negative SCCHN cell lines and tissues. Our findings demonstrate specific regulation of cellular miRNAs in the presence of HPVs and its oncogenes, and our results may contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in HPV-mediated carcinogenesis.",

Therefore, we employed electromobility shift assays, but we could not detect specific binding of DRpp29 either to the RNase P RNA or the pre-tRNA substrate.

In vitro, the RNA subunit of the bacteria as well as the relevant subunit of some archaea is catalytically active in the absence of protein at high ionic conditions. Here we report, the partial purification and characterisation of RNase P from the ethanologenic bacterium Zymomonas mobilis.

Inhibition of Z. mobilis RNase P by proteinase K and micrococcal nuclease strongly indicates that the activity requires both protein and RNA components.

The gene which encodes the RNA subunit of the bacterial RNase P was cloned in the appropriate vector and expressed in Escherichia coli cells. The expected catalytic activity of the RNA subunit was explored by screening of temperature, pH, and ionic requirements.

Carbonic anhydrases are ubiquitous metalloenzymes present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that are encoded by five evolutionarily unrelated gene families, namely a-CAs, b-CAs, c-CAs, d-CAs and e-CAs. In mammals, 15 a-CA isozymes or CA-related proteins have been described with different catalytic activity, subcellular localization and tissue distribution. The hCAII enzyme is the target for drugs, such as acetazolamide, methazolamide and dichlorphenamide for the treatment of glaucoma. However, since the specificity of sulphonamides against CA enzymes is low, the adverse effect could be encountered during the treatment of the related diseases. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the inhibition mechanism of the enzyme in order to develop more specific novel inhibitors. In this work, we plan to identify some amino acids that may be involved in catalytic centre of hCAII enzyme. PCR based site-directed mutagenesis strategy has been performed replacing Asn67 to a hydrophobic amino acid, Isoleucin and Leu204 to a hydrophilic amino acid, Serin. The related mutations have been confirmed by sequence analysis. The mutant proteins were expressed in E coli by inducing IPTG. The expressed proteins were purified by sepharose 4B-Ltyrosine-sulphonamide affinity chromatography. The hydratase, esterase activity and inhibition manner of the mutant enzymes were compared to the wild type enzyme.

The number of binding site and the association binding constant of Pd(II)-complex were calculated at 27 and 37\u00b0C. From DH and DS\u02davalues, it can be concluded that hydrophobic interactions may play an important role in the binding of Pd(II)-complex to HSA. The distance (r) between donor (Trp of HSA) and acceptor (Pd(II)-complex) was obtained according to the Forster's theory of non-radiation energy transfer at different temperatures.

Steroids may represent the relevant physiological ligands of HPA, occupying the quaternary structured based 'hydrophobic' site, located in the central cavity of the oligomeric molecule. The present investigation analyses the interaction of HPA with the hydrophobic anticancer drug roscovitine, a purine analogue, applied in clinical studies. Binding of HPA to roscovitine is accompanied by a significant enhancement of the Trp fluorescence (up to 50%), characterizing the conformational changes within lectin molecule. The value of the dissociation constant kDa (4.1 \u00b1 0.2) for roscovitine is similar to the previously calculated kDa (1.9-5.4 lM) for steroids and adenine which shows high affinity binding for this ligand. The hyperbolic shape of the binding curve for roscovitine-HPA complex indicates one high affinity site for this ligand, suggested to occupy the previously identified 'hydrophobic' site in the protein molecule.

Many natural and synthetic peptides and peptidomimetics were shown previously to bind to the l-opioid receptor selectively but there is no consensus about what structure is responsible for such biological activity. No high resolution structure of this receptor is available and the binding site of ligands is not exactly known despite numerous sitedirected mutagenesis studies. This suggests that the determination of structural aspects of l-opioid activity should focus on the ligands. l-Opioid ligands with similar affinity and selectivity should possess at least one common structural feature in which they differ from other ligands of different affinity and selectivity. Comparative structural analysis of such ligands, considering adequate representation of binding conditions may reveal key features of bioactivity. In this study ten l-opioid receptor ligands, DAMGO, Tyr-W-MIF-1, morphiceptin, endomorphin-1 and 2 and their analogues, possessing different affinity and selectivity were examined using molecular dynamics. Conformational preference of these molecules was determined in aqueous environment along with structural properties previously proposed to be important for binding. No structural trend was observed in correlation with previously measured bioactivities. It was observed, that increased backbone flexibility do not have a negative impact on receptor affinity and selectivity, which supports the idea of induced fit binding. Results, however, suggest that binding does not occur on the surface of the receptor, which condition is modeled by the aqueous environment. ",

The dissociation constants for the homozygous atypical BChE (AA), fluoride-resistant (FF) and heterozygote UA were 1.6, 0.99 and 0.72 mM, respectively. Dimethylcarbamate ester of isoproterenol inhibited usual BChE 90 times faster than AChE, while the inhibition rate constants of BChE variants ranged from 0.021 minute -1 lM -1 for AA to 0.20 minute -1 lM -1 for UU BChE. Conclusions: Both inhibitors are more potent for BChE than AChE, but carbamoylation by dimethylcarbamate of isoprotenerol is more selective. Since isoprotenerol is the leaving group of the ester and a product of cholinesteraseres carbomoylation, the ester could be used as a prodrug because slow hydrolysis of dimethylcarbamate of isoproterenol by plasma BChE could ensure a slow release of isoproterenol in the organism.",

Mustafaeva Department of Bioengineering, Yildiz Technical University, Esenler-Istanbul, TURKEY Water-soluble protein-Polyelectrolyte (PE) complexes as functional biopolymer systems represent a specific class of polymer-PE compounds that have important applications in various areas. Synthetic PEs have been widely used to modify proteins via covalent attachment, increasing the immunogenicity of antigenic peptides. Fluorescence techniques have recently been used to study peptide-protein or peptide-PE conjugates. From the fluorescent emission shift of tryptophan residues in protein or peptides, it is possible to localize the interaction between protein and PE at certain protein domains. In this study, we investigate covalent binding mechanism of FMDV synthetic peptides 135-161 amino acid residues with copolymers of acrylic acids and N-vinylpyrolidone (VP\\AA) and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), depending upon the weight concentration ratio of components by fluorescence and HPLC methods. From the analysis of peptide-BSA and Peptide-PE conjugates, it is possible to discuss the mechanism of the conjugate formation and structure of forming particles. According to the fluorescence analysis results, free peptide which containing Trp residue, gives fluorescence at k max 353 nm, free BSA which containing two Trp gives fluorescence at k max 339 nm. However, after the conjugation reaction it is observed that products k max decreased and it is characterized as blue shift of k max . This indicates that when conjugates formed, Trp is completely isolated from aqueous solution.",

It has been determined that water soluble and insoluble polymer-protein complexes have been formed depending on the initial molar ratios of the components and the pH values. BSA-PAA polycomplexes have been synthesized at values of pH = 4.0-7.0 and at initial molar ratios and have analyzed by different methods. The polycomplexes have been examined using UV-VIS Spectrophotometer, Steady State Flourescence Spectrometer and HPLC System. The soluble complexes were characterized by the structure of particles in which protein molecules are densely covered by the shelf of a polymer coil. The fluorescence method is applied to the water soluble PAA-protein mixtures, the water solubility of the system has been researched by turbidimetric method depending on the polymer/protein ratio and the pH value of the mixture, and insoluble systems have been determined. Aggregation of intrapolymer complexes has been found depending on the ratio and pH value. kmax and Imax values of tryptophan in the protein molecule change according to the ratio and pH. These systems have been researched in detail using fluorescence method and new information has been gathered. Dioxygenases catalyze the ring cleavage of aromatic compounds in the alkylphenol degradation pathway, thus are responsible for the catabolism of the alkylphenols in aerobic bacteria. To date, crystal structures of previously reported dioxygenases showed a similar active-site, but revealed the structural differences in the substrate specificity. Therefore, the structural studies of bacterial dioxygenase LapB (for long-chain alkylphenols) will lead to detailed information about the mechanism of phenolic moiety ring cleavage and the substrate-recognition system for LapB. To elucidate the functional features of LapB, we successfully expressed, purified and crystallized the enzyme from Pseudomonas sp. Strain KL28. The enzyme was expressed as the C-terminal His-tagged protein in Escherichia coli, followed by purification using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The molecular mass of the purified LapB was estimated to be about 140 kDa by Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography, corresponding to a homotetramer. LapB was crystallized using the hanging-drop method, and its structure was determined by the molecular replacement using the 2.3 \u00c5 resolution data which were collected at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Korea. The crystal belongs to a space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 with the unit-cell parameters a = 94.9, b = 97.0, c = 133.4 \u00c5 , a, b, c = 90\u00b0, and four monomers per asymmetric unit.

The highest structural resolution (of about 5 nm) was observed for the truncated form of FBPase. The effect of pH on the protein properties was also investigated. Introduction: SHP-2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, encoded by the PTPN11 gene, mediates cell signalling by growth factors and cytokines acting via the RAS/MAP kinase pathway. The enzyme is normally inactive and is activated when connected to other tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. SHP-2 mutations leading to continuously active enzyme, were found in Noonan Syndrome and certain leukemias. In the present study, seventeen 2-thiazolylimino/heteroarylimino-5aryliden-thiazolidin-4-ones divided, according to the heteroarylimino group, into three series of derivatives bearing thiazole-, benzothiazole-and benzoisothizole rings, were tested for SHP-2 inhibitory action. Results and discussion: Eleven out of seventeen compounds had Ki values lower than 54.54 lM whereas four of them had Ki values lower than 12.85 lM. Compounds of the benzothiazole series were more active than thiazole and benzoisothiazole analogues. Docking studies revealed that hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond formation stabilize enzyme-inhibitor complex. In all cases, stable complex formation was favoured by the placement of a hydrophobic group in the vicinity of aminoacids Tyr62, Glu361, Arg362, Lys364, Ser365, Lys366 and Ser460. This hydrophobic group may be a, preferentially methoxy substituted phenyl group in the thiazol series, adamantane in the adamantanyl-thiazolyl-derivative or the benzothiazolyl group in the benzothiazole series. Hydrogen bond interactions between aryliden substituents or groups of the backbone of the compounds and enzyme aminoacids further increase stability. Lys 280, Tyr62 and Arg 278 are the aminoacids mainly involved in this process. Conclusions: Docking results explain well the inhibitory action of the new compounds and may be useful for future design of more inhibitors of this series.",

This heterodimeric toxin, main component of the C. d. terrificus venom, is completed by an acidic, non-toxic and non-enzymatic component (crotoxin A), and it is related to important envenomation effects, as neurological disorders, myotoxicity and renal failure. Despite of its harmful effects, Cro has been tested successfully as inhibitor of tumor growth and as an efficient analgesic substance. Although the crotoxin was the first animal toxin to be crystallized (1938) , no crystal structure is available for crotoxin, crotoxin A or B. Methods: The crystal structure of a novel tetrameric complex formed by two dimers of crotoxin B isoforms (CB1/CB2) was solved at 2.2 \u00c5 resolution.

The most probable sites related to the neurotoxic activity are exposed on the surface. Conclusions: This arrangement may increase the neurotoxic activity of this protein, helping to anchor the molecule to its substrate located at the pre-synaptic membrane. Deeper structural and functional studies with this enzyme can lead to new and effective drugs. Zinc binding domains, or zinc fingers (ZnFs), form one of the most numerous and most diverse superclasses of protein structural motifs in eukaryotes. Although our understanding of the functions of several classes of these domains is relatively well developed, we know much less about the molecular mechanisms of action of many others. Myelin transcription factor 1 (MyT1) type ZnFs are found in organisms as diverse as nematodes and mammals and are found in a range of sequence contexts. MyT1, one of the early transcription factors expressed in the developing central nervous system, contains seven MyT1 ZnFs that are very highly conserved both within the protein and between species. We have used a range of biophysical techniques, including NMR spectroscopy and data-driven macromolecular docking, to investigate the structural basis for the interaction between MyT1 ZnFs and DNA. Our data indicate that MyT1 ZnFs recognize the major groove of DNA in a way that appears to differ from other known zinc binding domains. The gene BH3554, of 747 pb, from Bacillus halodurans C-125 was cloned, sequenced and overexpressed into Rosetta Escherichia coli strain. The deduced protein was a 32 kDa monomeric esterase with high homology to carboxylesterases from Bacillus thuringiensis (86% identity) and Geobacillus kaustophilus (85% identity). The sequence analysis showed that the protein contains a catalytic triad formed by Ser93, Asp192 and His222, and the Ser of the active site is located in the conserved motif Gli 91-X-Ser93-X-Gli 95 included in most esterases and lipases. The enzyme showed remarkable stability at high pH, against denaturing agents, like organic solvents, detergents and urea. The protein catalyzed the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl (p-NP) esters with different acyl chain lengths, confirming the esterase activity. The best substrate was p-NPAcetate (C 2 ) with Km and Vmax values of 0.26 mM and 1541 mM/minute, respectively. Phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), a serine inhibitor, and the organophosphate Paraoxon, strongly inhibited the esterase activity, whereas Eserine had no effects on the activity, this data showed that the Serine-esterase belongs to the B-esterase group.

Garratt Instituto de Fisica de Sao Carlos/Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sa\u02dco Paulo, BRAZIL Introduction: Parasite FeSODs have been proposed as drug targets for the development of alternative chemotherapy. This is based on their role in parasite defense against host-generated free radicals as well as experimental data such as antisense RNA experiments. Knowledge of their 3D structures and their comparison with human MnSOD are essential for any serious attempt to implement such ideas. A better understanding of the determinants of metal specificity is therefore also pertinent to this question. Methods: The 3D structures of FeSODs from T. cruzi, T. brucei and P. falciparum were solved using standard crystallographic techniques. A full sequence alignment of all family members was derived from the Pfam database using ClustalX and used for Statistical Cluster Analysis. DDG values were calculated, clustered and mapped onto the structure of the T. brucei enzyme. Results: Minor differences are observed at the entrance to the active site which might be exploitable for selective inhibitor design. SCA suggests that different groups of residues are statistically coupled in FeSODs and MnSODs. These surround the conserved core and converge on Gln72 (145 in MnSODs) which is known to be related to metal specificity. Conclusion: We suggest that the SCA clusters observed are involved in fine tuning the active site and related to the determination of metal ion specificity.",

Dorrington Rhodes University, Grahamstown, SOUTH AFRICA Introduction: Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), conserved throughout all eukaryotes and archaebacteria, is the only protein known to contain the unique amino acid, hypusine. Hypusinated eIF5A is essential for cell viability and is proposed to facilitate translation of mRNAs encoding products required for progression through the G1-S phase. While crystal structures of eIF5A homologues are available, there is limited structure-function information on hypusinated eIF5A. We describe here the biochemical characterisation of yeast eIF5A to determine the oligomeric state of the native protein and relate this data to its in vivo function. Methods: Gel filtration, native PAGE and cross-linking experiments were used to determine the oligomeric state of purified native eIF5A. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify critical residues involved in maintaining the oligomeric state and the biological activity of these mutants was tested by complementation assays in an eIF5A-knockout yeast strain. Homology models were used to predict potentially important residues involved in RNA binding and in maintaining the oligomeric state of yeast eIF5A. Results: Native eIF5A exists as a dimer in solution and dimerisation is dependent on hypusination and RNA binding. We propose that dimerisation is required for eIF5A function. A sequential two-step dimerisation model, involving hypusine in the formation of a loose dimer (step one) and a tight dimer configuration requiring RNA (step two) will be presented. Conclusions: This is the first direct biochemical evidence that native eIF5A is a dimer and that dimerisation requires RNA binding. These findings provide important insight into the functional relevance of hypusine. In-vitro assembly of vimentin intermediate filaments (IFs) proceeds from tetrameric complexes to mature IFs in three distinct stages: (i) tetramers laterally associate into 16 nm-wide unit-length-type filaments (ULFs); (ii) ULFs longitudinally anneal into short, immature filaments; (iii) these radially compact yielding mature, 10 nm-wide IFs. Here, we probe this assembly mechanism using a new approach: near UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is employed to identify new interactions of the aromatic amino acids emerging at each assembly stage. In particular, the CD signal of ULFs does not change as compared to that of the soluble tetramers exhibiting two major peaks at 285 and 279 nm. Upon elongation, two changes occur in the CD signal: (i) The band at 279 nm, reflecting the transition of the tyrosines from the ground state to the first vibrational mode of the excited state is lost and (ii) a new band appears at 291 nm. These changes take place at different time scales. The disappearance of the 279 nm signal denotes a fast process occurring within the first minute of assembly, compatible with an increased rigidity of the tyrosines during elongation of the ULFs. The rise of the 291 nm band represents a slower process with a lifetime of~25 minute, indicating the emergence of a new electronic species. Potential candidates are phenolates, created by the deprotonation of the tyrosines' phenyl rings as a consequence of their new localization in a negatively charged environment. The appearance of these tyrosine-binding polar protein pockets documents molecular rearrangements during the radial compaction.",

This receptor is inhibited by snake venom molecules named disintegrins [3] . Recently, we characterized the inhibitory profile of jarastatin (JAST) and jararacin (JARC), two disintegrins from Bothrops jararaca venom, on human platelet aggregation induced by ADP (IC 50 of 281 nm and 110 nm, respectively) and thrombin (IC 50 89.5 nm and 29 nm, respectively). Studies using six cyclic peptides synthesized based on these disintegrins RGD hairpin loop also revealed no activity against ADP-induced assays and an inhibitory profile at lM range on thrombin-induced assays. In this work our purpose was to identify the role of RGD loop and others disintegrins regions to the biological profile of JARC and JAST. Methods: Therefore we used a molecular modeling program (Swiss Model 3.7) for constructing their homology models and their complexes with the aIIbb3 crystal structure. Results: Interestingly JARC and JAST conserved their 3D-structure compared to others snake venom disintegrins crystal structures whereas the cyclic peptides present a displacement of the RGD region. Our docking results showed interactions between the disintegrins and a IIb b III (i.e. Asp 51 -Lys 125 ) including through the N-terminal region (i.e. Thr 11 -Glu 157 ). As expected JARC presents more interactions (n = 14) with the integrin than JAST (n = 12) whereas the cyclic peptides showed less interactions (n = 3-10) only with the integrin b III subunity. Conclusion: These results reinforced the requirement of further disintegrins interaction regions (i.e. N-terminal) for a IIb b III recognition besides the RGD sequence as suggested by the experimental results.

Folk Department of Cell Biology, Charles University, Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC Introduction: The protooncogenic kinase c-Src can be activated by displacing the intramolecular interactions of its SH2 and SH3 domains. We have shown previously that SH3 domain continues to exert negative regulatory effect on the kinase activity even in the absence of the pY527-SH2 domain interaction. New site of tyrosine phosphorylation on Src pTyr-90 was recently discovered and found to be highly enriched in the Src transformed cells. Tyr-90 is a conserved residue in ligand binding region of the SH3 domain. Methods: Phosphomimicking Y90E and non-phosphorylable Y90F mutants of SH3 domain of Src were introduced in both wild-type and activated Y527F mutant of Src and analyzed for impact on kinase activity, ligand binding and capacity to transform rat fibroblasts. Effects of Y90E and Y90F mutations were further analyzed using homology modeling. Results: Y90E mutation in Src SH3 domain resulted in greatly reduced binding of key signaling partners of Src, namely: FAK, CAS and Stat-3. Moreover Y90E mutant of c-Src exhibited elevated autophosphorylation Y416 site in the activation loop of kinase domain to the extent of SH2-activated mutant c-Src Y527F. The same effect was not however observed for c-SrcY527/Y90E double mutant confirming our previous results that SH3-linker interaction is not critical for regulation of SH2-activated Src. The homology modeling shows that Y90E mutation leads to a reorganization and a partial loss of hydrophobicity of the second SH3 ligand-binding pocket. Conclusions: Our results suggest that phosphomimicking mutation Y90E elevates kinase activity of Src and at the same time results in reduced ligand binding. These findings suggest that Src has the capacity to undergo more extensive autophosphorylation and structural changes than previously suggested, with implications for regulation of substrate selection and kinase activity.",

Ghahghaei University of Sistan and Baluchestan, Zahedan, IRAN a-Crystallin, a member of small heat shock protein (sHsp) family, is comprised of aA and aB subunits and acts as a molecular chaperone by interacting with unfolding proteins to prevent their aggregation. The aA-crystallin homopolymer consists of 30-40 subunits that are undergoing dynamic exchange. In vivo, a-crystallin elicit its chaperone action in a crowded cellular environment (e.g. in the lens). In vitro, inert molecular crowding agents (e.g. dextran) are often used to mimic crowded conditions. In this study, it was found that a-crystallin and aA-crystallin are poorer chaperones in the presence of dextran. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, it is shown that the aA-crystallin subunit exchange rate strongly increases with temperature. Binding of reduced ovotransferrin to aA-crystallin markedly decreases the rate of subunit exchange, as does the presence of dextran. In addition, in the presence of dextran the effect of reduced ovotransferrin on decreasing the rate of subunit exchange of aA-crystallin is greater than in the absence of dextran. Under the conditions of molecular crowding, the aA-crystallin subunit exchange rate is not temperature-dependent. The exchange rate of aA-crystallin subunits correlates with its chaperone efficiency, i.e. in the absence of dextran, the variation in chaperone ability of aA-crystallin increases with temperature whereas in the presence of dextran the temperature dependence of the chaperone ability of aA-crystallin is eliminated.",

Stavropoulos Department of Chemistry, University of Patras, Patras, GREECE Introduction: Small synthetic peptides, based on substance P C-terminal fragment, increase the secretion of tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) and prevent the proliferation of several cancer cells. We have also shown the antiproliferative activity of tri-and tetra-peptoids in breast and prostate cancer cells. The aim of this study was to incorporate D-Trp in the sequence of the synthesized peptides and to evaluate their effect on cancer cell proliferation. Methods: All the syntheses were carried out stepwise by SPPS, using the Fmoc/Bu t methodology on the solid support 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin and DIC/HOBt as coupling reagent. All analogs were purified (HPLC) and identified (ESI-MS). The highly invasive breast cancer epithelial MDA-MB-231 and HT-29 colon cancer cells of high tumorigenity were cultured in absence or presence of hydrazino-peptoids for 48 hours, in presence and abscence of serum and cell proliferation was documented by WST-1 method. Results: We report the synthesis of a series of hydrazino-peptoids, analogs of SP 5-10 hexapeptide containing peptoid residues like HN-N(R)CH 2 CO, NPhe and NAla, and also D-Trp and Tic. 1.

Glp 1 -Tic 2 -Gly 3 -[NH-N(Bzl)-CH 2 -CO] 4 -D-Trp 5 -Leu 6 -OH All peptides significantly inhibited the proliferation of MDA and HT-29 cells in a dose-dependent manner in absence of serum, even at low concentrations. However, in presence of serum only the peptoids 2 and 3 inhibited the cell proliferation of MDA, whereas none inhibited HT-29 cells. Conclusions: Hydrazino-peptoids act as potent antiproliferative agents in breast and colon cancer cells and further studies are warranted to evaluate their inhibitory effects in the view of the new analogues.",

The serine is absolutely conserved among the monomeric and trimeric dUTPases and has been proposed to promote catalysis by balancing the negative charge at the oxygen that bridges the a-and b-phosphorus of the substrate. In all reported complexes of dUTPases with the substrate analog a,b-imido-dUTPAEMg, the b-OH of the serine is indeed hydrogen bonded to the a,b-bridging nitrogen of the analog. However, in the complex of the Asp90 -> Asn mutant dUTPase with the natural substrate dUTPAEMg, the serine b-OH points in the opposite direction and is hydrogen bonded to Asn84 at the bottom of the pyrimidine pocket. Here we show that the replacement of the b-OH by hydrogen reduces k cat from 5.8 to 0.008 s -1 , but also k -1 , the rate of substrate dissociation, from 6.2 to 0.1 s -1 (K M = 6 10 -9 M). We conclude that the serine b-OH exercises both ground state (GS) destabilization and transition state (TS) stabilization, effects not usually linked to a single residue. We argue that the b-OH destabilizes the GS by imposing conformational constraints on the enzyme, and that TS stabilization depends on a rotation of the serine side chain, which not only relieves the constraints but brings the b-OH into a position where it can electrostatically stabilize the TS.",

Lower sample biomass and ever decreasing crystallization volumes have resulted in a huge increase in the number of crystallization experiments and a concomitant increase in the number of images of crystallization experiments that need to be analyzed to determine a successful experiment. While, significant research has been done in the field of automated crystal detection, advances are still required in order to identify protein crystals in the increased number of crystallization images produced. We have previously shown that the addition of low concentrations (> 9 mM) of a non-covalent dye (1,8-ANS) to high-throughput crystallization experiments has no discernable effect upon the success of crystallization experiments and significantly increases the fluorescent signal of protein crystals, aiding the identification of successful crystallization trials [1] . In this poster we will describe developments in the method as applied to the automated tracking and handling of protein crystals on beamline BW7B at the EMBL Hamburg Outstation. Future directions will also be discussed. Since the fluorescence enhancement of polarity-sensitive dyes has been useful in identifying hydrophobic sites on a number of targets, changing in intrinsic fluorescence of protein and extrinsic fluorescence of Nile red after exposing enzyme at range of pH values was investigated. Results showed that Nile red dye fluorescence at alkaline pH were higher than acidic pH values. In the other hand, it can be concluded that the protein at alkaline pH has more accessible hydrophobic patches relative to acidic pH. Intrinsic fluorescence studies at different pH represented noticeable alteration in tertiary structure of protein. Respectively, Far-UV-CD studies showed that the native protein has a-helix structure while at higher pH a transition from a-helix to b-structure was appeared. Moreover, at lower pH the content of a-helix structure was increased. These results suggested that various pH induced significant structural changes in choline oxidase. Method: In this study, we have generated C-terminal truncated mutants by serial truncations. The quaternary structure of the enzyme was analyzed using both sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation.",

Hsu Department and Institute of Agricultural Chemistry, Taipei, TAIWAN Organisms growing at elevated temperatures face the challenge of maintaining the integrity of their genetic materials. Archaea possess unique chromatin proteins for gene organization and information processing. Several small DNA-binding proteins, such as Sso10b1, Sso10b2, Sso7c4 and Sso7d from hyperthermophilic organism Sulfolobus solfataricus was found and has been proposed to play a regulatory role in gene transcription and chromatin formation, however, very little is known regarding the structural and functional relationship of these proteins. Therefore, the structure determination of these proteins was carried out using multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique and X-ray diffraction method. Furthermore, gel retardation and EMSA were applied to examine their DNA binding lengths and specificities. Introduction: There are two distinct families of EF-hand calcium binding proteins with regard to their functionality: calcium sensors and calcium buffers. These families also have distinct structural characteristics, which are underlined here by several scaling laws: the protein backbone length with the interval of residues, the surface area with the radius of the probe molecule rolled onto it, the radius of gyration with the residues number and the surface area with the molecular weight. Methods: Within this paper we calculate the radius of gyration, the surface area, the protein backbone length for the studied proteins and using the fractal geometry concepts we determine the corresponding scaling laws for each class of proteins. Results: The fractal dependences with regard to the proteins backbone lengths indicate dissimilar mechanisms responsible for their local folding. Different scaling properties of the radius of gyration with the residue number show that the shapes of these proteins are quite unlike. The proteins surface area scales, on the one hand, with the radius of the probe molecule and on the other hand, with the molecular weight revealing different strengthens of the intermolecular interactions for the two classes of the investigated proteins. Conclusion: We have pointed out that statistical scaling laws may be employed in describing structural features of proteins at both local and global levels. Furthermore, they can be of great help in novel function prediction methods that do not rely on sequence or fold similarity to other known proteins.",

ErmSF from Streptomyces fradiae has extra long Nterminal end region (NTER) in which one 60RRE62 motif is contained as a part of a-helix because it is unstructured but peptide from R58 to V81 assumes a secondary structure of a-helix. Methods and results: To define the role of RRE motif, site directed mutagenesis of each amino acid was performed to get much lowered MIC of each mutant. NTER could be truncated up to A59 (NTTE59) to show only 30% of activity relative to wild type enzyme but one more truncation of R60 almost destroyed the enzyme activity and surprisingly enough, another truncation of R61 presumably recovered the enzyme activity to carry out monomethylation reaction to exhibit elevated lincomycin resistance.

DSP acts on chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla in a fashion similar to that of x-conotoxin GVIA, a well-known neurotoxic peptide, and blocks Ntype voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channels. However, the amino acid sequence of DSP has little homology with any other known Ca 2+ channel blockers or antifungal peptides. In this paper, we analyzed the solution structure of DSP by using two-dimensional 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance and determined the pairing of half-cystine residues forming disulfide bonds. Results and discussion: The arrangement of the three disulfide bridges in DSP was distinct from that of other antifungal peptides and conotoxins. The overall structure of DSP is compact due in part to the three disulfide bridges and, interestingly, is very similar to those of the insect-and plant-derived antifungal peptides. On the other hand, the disulfide arrangement and the three-dimensional structure of DSP and GVIA are not similar. Nevertheless, some surface residues of DSP superimpose on the key functional residues of GVIA. This homologous distribution of hydrophobic and charged side chains may result in the functional similarity between DSP and GVIA. Thus, we propose here that the three-dimensional structure of DSP can explain its dual function as a Ca 2+ channel blocker and antifungal peptide [1] . As part of the Center for Structures of Membrane Proteins (CSMP) our aim is the structure determination of membrane proteins of both bacterial and human origin. Membrane proteins are currently the targets for~40% of all therapeutic drugs, therefore the structures are expected to provide invaluable information for rational drug design. Our initial target genes are all 25 Escherichia coli membrane kinase receptors, and a handful of human membrane proteins. At least two different constructs are prepared for each target, one as a fusion with Mistic (a novel protein that allows for expression of eukaryotic proteins in E. coli), as well as a non-misticated one. We studied the effect of Mistic on protein expression and membrane integration levels of the E. coli histidine kinase receptor family. We find that Mistic fusion greatly increases the overall yield, targets the cargo proteins more efficiently to the membrane and may even replace the signal sequence, while the proteins retain kinase activity. The proteins with the highest expression levels have been selected for large-scale preparation and crystallization screening. Prior to high-throughput crystallization screening a rapid and accurate evaluation of the oligomeric homogeneity of the samples, and the detergent-to-protein ratio in Protein-Detergent Complexes (PDC) is necessary. For this purpose we use an analytical HPLC system in combination with refractive index and static light scattering detectors, and NMR spectroscopy to characterize detergents free in solution and in PDC. Our crystal optimization approaches include automated detergent screening and crystallization under oil. Currently we have obtained crystals for four targets.",

Lugovskaya Palladin Institute of Biochemistry, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv, UKRAINE Introduction: The transformation of fibrinogen into fibrin by thrombin gives rise to structural rearrangements in the molecule leading to the exposure of the polymerization or contact sites taking part in fibrin intermolecular binding. We obtained monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to various parts of fibrinogen-fibrin molecule(s) during its transformation into polymeric fibrin and used mAbs as molecular probes to study mechanisms of fibrin polymerization. Methods: Human fibrin desAABB in 2 M urea was used as an antigen. The epitope for mAb in fibrin molecule was localized using ELISA and immunoblot analysis with various fibrin(ogen) fragments. Turbidity analysis and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the effect of mAbs and their Fab-fragment on fibrin polymerization. Results: The epitope for mAb FnI-3C proved to be localized in the fibrin fragment Bbeta118-134, which is situated in the coiled coil region of the molecule. MAb FnI-3C and its Fab-fragment inhibited polymerization of fibrins desAA, desAABB and fibrin formed in fibrinogen +thrombin reaction at equimolar ratio of mAb or Fab to fibrin(ogen). This testifies the blocking of polymerization or contact site(s) by this mAb and its Fab. The turbidity analysis and electron microscopy showed that this mAb and its Fab retarded the stage of fibrin protofibril lateral association. Previously other authors found several amino acid residues localized in coiled coil region of fibrin molecule: Bbeta-Ser111, Bbeta158-160 and BbetaArg166, which participated in fibrin protofibril lateral association.

This calls for designing antibiotics with improved permeation properties using a bottom-up approach, based on the knowledge of molecular mechanisms regulating resistance. Bacterial outer membrane contain general diffusion porins, such as OmpF, which constitute the main path of diffusion for antibiotics. A common mechanism by which bacterial strains become resistant is to introduce mutations modulating the permeation of the porins. Methods: To study the diffusion of antibiotics through OmpF at a molecular scale, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, combined with the metadynamic algorithm that accelerate rare events. Results: We simulated the wild type porin OmpF as well as variants with substitutions. We found that a mutation on the residue D113 (a residue at the constriction region) changes drastically the Ampicillin diffusion in terms of strength and localization of minima on the associated free energy map. Then led by these results, we used an antibiotic that potentially interact less with this residue, such as penicillin-G, and predicted the expected diffusion pathway. Conclusion: We further extended this investigation to other antibiotics, such as carbencillin and even fourth generation of cephalosporins, which are the most frequently prescribed class of antibiotics in the world. These findings are in good agreement with experimental results obtained by our collaborators (liposome swelling assays and electrophysiology) and demonstrate how theory and experiments can be combined to reveal the mechanism of antibiotic diffusion and designing potent antibiotics.",

Recently it was shown by NMR spectrometry [1] that binding of AMP-PNP at the ATP binding site allosterically changed the enzyme affinity for peptide substrate, and vice versa, peptide binding affected nucleotide binding. In this report we observed the same allosteric (or 'synergistic', as both ligands are substrates) effects in the PKA catalyzed peptide phosphorylation reaction. Simple kinetic procedure was elaborated for this analysis, based on application of the secondorder rate constants of this bisubstrate enzyme reaction [2] . The study involved a series of peptide substrates of diverse structure and different binding effectiveness. It was found that peptide structure had significant influence on the allosteric effect, thereby governing the binding effectiveness of both substrates as well as the observed rate of the overall reaction. It can be pointed out that mutual influence of substrates on their binding effectivenss might regulate activity of a monomeric bisubstrate enzyme by analogy with cooperativity known for multimeric enzymes. Many proteins undergo conformational changes as they shift between active and non-active states. Molecules that interfere with these changes are important biological reagents. In this study, we put forward an innovative in silico approach for identifying peptides that have the potential to block conformational changes of selected target proteins. These peptides are derived from the target protein and are designed to inhibit intra-molecular interactions that are important for the protein's function. The applicability of our approach is demonstrated through two antagonistic peptides. One peptide is derived from secreted Clusterin, a chaperon protein that evokes chemotherapy resistance in cancer cells. A second peptide is derived from an HSP, which is involved in inflammation. The clusterin-derived peptide binds to its target on the parent protein, and induces growth arrest when applied to cancer cell lines. Furthermore, it significantly enhances the cytostatic activity of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol in a synergetic way, as revealed by in vitro studies with breast, lung and prostate cancers cell lines. The HSP-derived peptide induces up to 90% decrease in the level of various inflammation-related cytokines when applied to blood cells derived from the myeloid lineage that were stimulated with LPS or anti-CD3 mAb. These two peptides are promising anti-cancer and antiinflammatory lead compounds and their in silico discovery paves a new path for the discovery of numerous novel therapeutic peptides to a wide range of indications. In this lecture, I will describe the details of the computational method, and extensive biological data that supports it. *These authors contributed equally to this work. Methods: We compared computational interaction models with measurements of antibacterial and haemolytic activity, Small Angle X-Ray and Surface Plasmon Resonance data, and structure predictions by Circular Dichroism (CD). Results: All peptides were active against Escherichia coli (Gram negative) and Staphylococcus carnosus (Gram positive) bacterial cultures, but the haemolytic properties against human red blood cells were found to be poor and indicated the peptides' selectivity. CD studies of the peptide secondary structure confirmed the prediction of peptide helicity. The antibacterial activity can be correlated with a change of the hexagonal phase transition temperature of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) as determined by Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). The calculated peptide membrane affinity is not related in linear way with the antibacterial activity. The reason for this might be aggregation as shown by surface plasmon resonance.",

We assume that this curvature finally leads to the disruption of the model membranes. In summary an over all helical structure, electrostatic and hydrophobic parameters as well as strong amphipaticity are good measures to describe antibacterial peptide interaction. Human mitochondrial NAD(P) + -dependent malic enzyme (m-NAD-ME) is a malic enzyme isoform with dual-cofactor specificity, ATP sensitivity and substrate cooperativity. In the present study, since the inhibitory effect of ATP is more pronounced on m-NAD-ME than on other ME isoforms, we investigate the possible role of Lys346 on the cofactor specificity, malate cooperativity and ATP sensitivity of the enzyme. Our kinetic data clearly indicate that the K346S mutant enzyme has shifted its cofactor preference from NAD + to NADP + . Furthermore, the cooperative binding of malate becomes remarkably less in the human m-NAD-ME after mutation of Lys346, and the sigmoidal phenomenon that appeared in WT was not prominent in Lys346 mutations, suggesting the importance of Lys346 in malate cooperativity. Although these Lys346 mutations changed the cooperative binding of malate to the enzyme, they could also be activated by fumarate and the cooperative effect can still be abolished by fumarate, implying that the allosteric property was still held in these mutants. Lys346 in the human m-NAD-ME plays a critical role in governing ATP sensitivity. Mutation of Lys346 to Ser or Ala causes the enzyme to be much less sensitive to ATP, similar to c-NADP ME. Substitution of Lys to Arg did not change the ATP sensitivity of the enzyme. The dissociation constants of ATP for K346S and K346A are increasing, while for K346R, they are similar to those of WT. Thus, ATP sensitivity is proposed to be determined by the electrostatic potential involving the positive charge of side-chain Lys346.",

The incidence of giardiasis worldwide may be as high as 1000 million cases. The drug of choice for treating the giardiasis is metronidazole, a 5-nitroimidazole derivative. Although metronidazole is effective, it exerts strong side effects in the host, and there is evidence that strains resistant to metronidazole are existent. This underlines the need for developing drugs that are effective against giardiasis. In this regard, it is noted that G. lamblia lacks oxidative phosphorylation because it possesses mitosomes instead of mitochondria. Thus, in G. lamblia, the main source of ATP is the glycolytic pathway suggesting that the enzymes of the glycolysis can be potential targets for drug design. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBPA) and triosephopsphate isomerase (TIM) are two glycolytic enzymes representing key steps on this pathway. FBPA catalyzes the reversible cleavage of D-fructose-1,6bisphosphate producing R-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). TIM catalyzes the reversible isomerization between GAP and DHAP. We characterized the recombinant FBPA and TIM of G. lamblia and used several compounds trying to inactivate both. The effect of these compounds over the enzyme activity, and cell viability were tested. Results showed a specie specific effect over TIM of cysteine-reactive compounds though FBPA was not affected. The cysteine at position 222 of TIM is the main target of these compounds. One of these compounds had citotoxic effect on trophozoites of G. lamblia, through inactivation of TIM and low effect on human cells. ",

This sample exhibits a 1 H-15 N-TROSY spectrum very similar to the Antiamoebin-1 spectrum in neutral DMPC/DHPC bicelles and slightly different from spectra in anionic micelles (LMPG, SDS). All expected 13 backbone HN resonances were observed in this spectrum, but the signals were significantly broader ( 1 H line-width 40-60 Hz in rHDLs vs. 30 Hz in bicelles). The topology of the peptide in the bilayer of the rHDL was determined using the lipid-soluble relaxation probe technique. Obtained results prove the applicability of rHDLs for high-resolution NMR studies. Cellular tetrapyrroles such as porphyrins and hemes are extremely reactive and poorly soluble under physiological conditions. The protein p22HBP is a heme-binding protein that has also strong affinity towards other cellular tetrapyrroles. The structure of p22HBP has been recently determined by NMR [1] and the molecular recognition mechanism of several cellular tetrapyrroles (Hemin, Protoporphyrin IX, Coproporphyrin 1/III, Uroporphyrin I/III and Bilirubin IX) investigated by modelling methodologies is reported here. The flexible docking screening of the tetrapyrroles was done with Autodock and was targeted to a specific protein region identified previously by NMR studies. Next, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for 10 ns in a fully hydrated system using the GROMOS force field and RESP atomic charges for the tetrapyrroles. We show that the binding site of p22HBP is able to recognize other tetrapyrroles other than Hemin. We propose that Hemin iron (III) may interact by two axial methionines at position 63 and 176. The binding affinity tetrapyrrols towards p22HBP were estimated by free energy calculations that follows the order: Protoporphyrin IX < Hemin < Coproporphyrin I = Coproporphyrin III < Uroporphyrin I < Bilirubin IX < Uroporphyrin III. These results show that p22HBP is able to bind with different degree of affinity most of the anabolic and catabolic intermediates of the heme. Tetrapyrroles are stabilized by strong electrostatic effects due to lysine 177 arginine 56 located in the edges of the binding pocket. Introduction: Crossing the plasma membrane is a prerequisite for intracellular targeted drug delivery. Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are known to transport cargos attached to it into cells primarily by endocytosis. However, confinement of biomolecules into endosomes limits their use for intracellular targeting. We developed a novel cysteine-rich peptide that has the ability to enter directly into the cytosolic compartment of the cell. The factors affecting cytosolic distribution of peptide are reported. Methods: Uptake of fluorescently labeled peptide was assessed in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Effect of varying the labeling concentration, time course, changing incubation temperature from 37\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C, etc. on intracellular distribution was observed by fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy. Results: Our novel peptide exhibited mainly cytosolic localization along with some vesicular uptake in cells at a concentration as low as 2.5 lM. Diffused appearance was visible earliest after 4 hours. A reduction in vesicular uptake was observed on incubation at 4\u00b0C, however cytosolic uptake was almost unaffected, indicating the presence of an additional non-endosomal pathway. Due to higher stability, d-form of most of the well studied cationic CPPs (like Tat, arginines, etc.) is reported to be taken up better than the l-form. Our peptide differs as the l-form shows most efficient cytosolic uptake while the d-form and retro-inverso form exhibited especially reduced cytosolic diffusion.",

L-PGDS became compact by approximately 1.3 \u00c5 in radius after binding BV.

Introduction: Cytochrome c is a mitochondrial protein fundamental to the cell's respiratory process and apoptosis. Considering that apoptosis can be triggered by the photodynamic action of drugs, it was investigated the photochemical effect of phenothiazines on cytochrome c structure. Methods: Cytochrome c was submitted to UV-irradiation in the presence of phenothiazine compounds: phenothiazine (PTH), thioridazine (TR), trifluoperazine (TFP) and fluphenazine (FP), in different aggregation states modulated by the concentration of the drugs. Results: In the monomeric form, photoexcited TR, TFP and FP promoted cytochrome c damage evidenced by Soret band shift from 409 to 405 nm assigned to the conversion of heme iron to the high spin form (cytc405). The spin change was attested by EPR and MCD measurements. MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry of cytc405 revealed oxidation of Met65, Met80 and Tyr74. In high concentrations of drugs, the irradiation promoted the formation of stable cation radicals in the phenothiazine aggregates that was unable to oxidize cytochrome c. However, low and high concentrations of PTH promoted significant damages in cytochrome c under irradiation. Cytochrome c damage could be among the causes of cell viability decrease when irradiated in the presence of these drugs. Conclusion: For TR, TFP and FP, the aggregation stabilizes the cation radical and prevents the access of the drugs to the heme crevice. PTH, being a small molecule, probably forms less stable aggregates that did not prevent the access of monomers into cytochrome c structure and allows the attack of the photochemically-generated cation radical to the amino acid residues.

Introduction: Leishmania major, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Trypanosoma brucei collectively cause disease and death in millions of humans widespread in developing countries. There are no vaccines and the few drugs available are inadequate due to high toxicity and resistance. Recently, the flavin containing enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) has been suggested to be a potential target for drug development against trypanosomatids. DHODH catalyses the conversion of L-dihydroorote (DHODH) to orotate, the fourth step and only redox reaction in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, DHODH has been described as a soluble fumarate reductase playing a role in connecting succinate/fumarate metabolism to the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Results: We have solved the crystal structure of both Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania major DHODHs in the apo-form and in complex with orotate and fumarate. Structure-based sequence alignment between T. cruzi, L. major and human DHODH combined to site directed mutagenesis and kinetic studies have been used to guide the selection of target sites for drug discovery. The regions, comprising residues 87-94 and 196-219, are fully conserved in tryapanosomatid DHODH sequences and have been identified to share low sequence and structural similarity to the human enzyme. In addition, those regions have been found to provide structural and catalytic stability for the parasitic enzymes. Conclusions: In the present work we have suggest potential sites to be further exploited for design of highly specific inhibitors for DHODHs as an important tool for the development of anti-trypanosomatid drugs.

A key strategy to overcome this limitation is the integration between kinetics studies and crystallography. One of the most prevalent parasitic illnesses in Latin America is Chagas' disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. An attractive target for the development of novel inhibitors is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a key enzyme from the parasite glycolytic pathway. Iodoacetic acid (IAA) is a known inhibitor that inactivates GAPDH by modifying the catalytic cysteine residue. The previously proposed mechanism of inactivation consists of preventing the formation of the GAPDH-NAD complex. However, the molecular determinants underlying the inhibitory mechanism and binding mode remain unknown. The IAA time-dependency and irreversible properties were evaluated by incubating GAPDH with IAA. Crystallization assays were conducted on purified enzyme pre-incubated with inhibitor. Analysis of the structure shows that the modified cysteine is hydrogen bonded to the NAD mediated by a water molecule. Additionally, the delocalized p-electrons from IAA form a p-interaction with NAD. The IAA biding mode suggests that the cofactor plays central role for the inhibitor binding stabilization and the mechanism of inhibition involves preventing the formation of the thiohemiacetal intermediate and the hydrogen transfer between cysteine and NAD during the dehydrogenation step. The results suggest an alternative mechanism of inactivation and elucidate the structural determinants for binding, thus providing insights on molecular modifications aimed at improving affinity. Instead, the protein can binds to membranes, which makes it possible that it recognizes some more general features of the poles. A real fact is that there are two highly conserved residues (R18 and G19) that seem to constitute a polar target determinant. DivIVA secondary structure prediction and in vitro experiments show a coiled-coil protein that can oligomerize in 'doggy-bone' shaped oligomers. But how the protein interacts with other proteins or even with the membrane is still poorly understood. We have undertaken attempts toward the determination of the crystal structure of DivIVA from B. subtilis getting good diffracting data up to 3.5 \u00c5 . Also we have developed in vitro liposome binding experiments and electron microscopy analysis to try to understand the way DivIVA can interact with itself, with other proteins (MinD, RacA or SpoOJ) and with the membrane.",

It is produced by the human papillomaviruses (HPV) responsible for various tumors including cervical cancer. E6 forms with cellular ubiquitin ligase E6AP a complex that targets the tumor suppressor p53 for degradation. E6 also targets more than 40 other cellular proteins implicated in cell proliferation, apoptosis or adhesion.

We first produced separately the two domains of HPV E6, which turned out to be well folded. We solved the NMR structure of the C-terminal domain, and the structural analysis of the N-terminal domain is under way. However, the full-length HPV E6 remained largely insoluble.

The human a7 nAChR forms homopentamers and is known to be implicated in many diseases, therefore presents an attractive drug target. Aiming to proceed to structural studies, several mutants of the human a7-ECD were designed based on the structure analysis of the homologous molluscan acetylcholine-binding protein and Torpedo a1 nAChR-ECD respectively and expressed in the supernatant of the yeast Pichia pastoris. One mutant was identified to fulfill the criteria for initiation of crystallization trials, which resulted in the production of small crystalls. Yet, further improvements are probably needed in order to obtain high quality crystals of the ECD. We thus introduced novel modifications, including changes in the glycosylation status of the expressed protein or different location of various tags. From size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering, it was indicated that the glycosylation, the positioning and the nature of the tag were catalytic for improved protein folding. This observation was further supported by the improvement in the ligand binding affinity of the new mutants. The above improvements, and the enhanced yield and solubility of the new a7 ECD mutant allow us to proceed to the production of improved crystals for high resolution studies. Organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents manifest their toxicity by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Reactivation of nerve agent-inhibited AChE by nucleophilic compounds such as oximes (2-PAM, MMB4, HI-6 and HLo-7) is the most important approach to treating nerve agent poisoning. Since oxime-induced reactivation of OP-inhibited AChE depends on the source of enzyme as well as the structures of OP and oxime, no single oxime is effective against all nerve agents. Therefore, the goal of this study is to design and discover a broad-spectrum oxime for its universal use in the treatment of OP poisoning. Although a number of crystal structures of AChE in complex with reversible inhibitors, or nerve agents, or oximes are reported, the determination of X-ray crystal structure of enzyme-OP-oxime conjugate is extremely difficult because of the fast chemical reaction between oxime and nerve agent-inhibited AChE. Therefore, we employed molecular modeling and simulation methods to build the 3-D structures of nerve agentinhibited human AChE-oxime complexes, using the available crystal structures of AChE. Our modeling studies were guided by our experimental data on the reactivation of sarin or soman-inhibited wild-type and mutant human AChEs by these oximes. These models reveal the position, orientation, and the interactions of 2-PAM, MMB4, HI-6 and HLo-7 with soman-or sarin-inhibited human AChE and amino acid residues critical for reactivation. This information was used for generating a pharmacophore and queries from the pharmacophore were used to identify potential reactivators from our 'in-house' database of small organic molecules. Gating the ion-permeation pathway in potassium channels is associated with conformational changes in activation and inactivation gates. We have prepared proteoliposomes with a purified recombinant potassium channel displaying the KcsA pore and the extracellular pore entrance of a voltage-gated Shaker Kv1.3 channel (KcsA-Kv1.3). Shifting the intracellular pH from 7.5 to 4.0 transiently activates and subsequently inactivates the channel. We investigated structural alterations correlated with gating transition from closed to inactivated states in a membrane setting using solid-state NMR spectroscopy in direct reference to electrophysiological and pharmacological experiments. We observed that at rest the inactivation gate of the KcsA-Kv1.3 channel is opened and the activation gate closed. By contrast, the inactivated channel displayed an opened activation and a closed inactivation gate. Importantly, the selectivity filter of inactivated KcsA-Kv1.3 adopts a nonconductive structure. A remarkably similar structural change within the selectivity filter was induced by binding a pore-blocking tetraphenylporphyrin derivative to the KcsA-Kv1.3 channel. The results establish a structural link between inactivation and inhibition of a K+ channel. Thus, we obtained a channel structure where both activation and inactivation gate were closed. Based on our elucidation of detailed KcsA-Kv1.3 structures with different gate conformations we propose a simple gating model where the two gates within the pore domain are either in an off (0) or on (1) position. Furthermore, we showed that conformational changes near or at the inactivation gate have an important influence on the affinity of potassium channel blockers encluding the well-studied scorpion toxins.",

Class Ia RNRs contain two subunits, denoted R1 (a) and R2 (b). These enzymes are regulated by nucleotides binding to two allosteric sites on the R1 subunit, termed the overall activity and specificity sites. ATP and dATP can bind to both allosteric sites whereas dTTP and dGTP bind exclusively to the specificity site. The overall activity in class Ia RNRs is generally considered to be regulated by ATP activation and dATP inhibition. By using gas-phase electrophoretic mobility macromolecule analysis (GEMMA), we found that the Escherichia coli RNR formed an a 4 b 4 complex in the presence of dATP and an a 2 b 2 complex in the presence of ATP, dTTP or dGTP. The results from studying two known mutants of the E. coli R1 subunit (N238A and H59A) suggested that a 4 b 4 octamer formation is required to enable dATP inhibition. ATP could also induce an inhibited a 4 b 4 complex but only when used in combination with dTTP/ dGTP. The formation of this complex is therefore determined by a cross-talk effect between the two allosteric sites. In conclusion, the E. coli RNR is regulated by cycling between an active a 2 b 2 complex and an inhibited a 4 b 4 complex. This regulation/oligomerization makes the E. coli enzyme different from the mammalian RNR which is always stimulated by ATP and cycles between active and inactive a 6 b 2 complexes. In both species, the ATP-induced complexes dissociated easily and seemed therefore to be more flexible than the tight dATP-induced a 4 b 4 and a 6 b 2 complexes. Introduction: Xylella fastidiosa is a phytopathogen that causes economically important diseases in wide range of plants including citrus variegated chlorosis, a major threat to citrus industry. In this work, it is studied the stationary phase survival protein SurE from this microorganism, named XFSurE. SurE is a phosphatase whose physiological role and reaction mechanism are not yet completely known. In Escherichia coli, SurE, named EcSurE, acts as nucleotidase and exopolyphosphatase, and it is thought to be involved in stress response. EcSurE dephosphorylates diverse intracellular substrates, especially nucleoside monophosphates in order to maintain all (ribo)deoxynucleotide pools required to RNA, DNA synthesis and other pathways [1] . Methods: The protein XFSurE was expressed using pET29a vector in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified by nickel metal affinity chromatography. Secondary structure contents and some low resolution parameters were obtained by dichroism circular and SAXS (Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering) analysis, respectively. Functional assays were performed against various phosphorylated substrates. Results: The purified XFSurE has a beta-sheet predominance conformation, a tetrameric organization in solution and a radius of gyration around 37 \u00c5 . XFSurE possesses the nucleotidase activity with preference for purine nucleoside monophosphates, especially 3'-AMP and 5'-GMP at neutral pH in the presence of a divalent metal cations (preferentially Mn 2+ ). In addition, some crystals were obtained in three conditions in preliminar crystallization assays, which may lead to its structural determination. There is some evidence that elevated levels of homocysteine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) are causal risk factors for several neurological disorders. However the signalling pathways, which control homocysteine metabolism in neural cells, are not fully understood. Ras is a central molecular switch of intracellular regulation and stress response and through interactions with downstream effector molecules regulates the survival and apoptosis of neural cells. To demonstrate the specificity of Ras-elicited effects on the activity of methyl cycles, wild-type pheochromocytoma PC12, mutant oncogenic rasH gene (MVR) expressing PC12 pheochromocytoma and normal c-rasH stably transfected M-CR3B cells were incubated with the N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and manumycin, (inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase and farnesyltransferase, respectively). We have found that L-NAME significantly changes the SAM/SAH ratio in both MCR and MVR cells. Moreover, these alterations have reciprocal character; in the MCR cells, the SAM/SAH ratio was raised, whereas in the MVR cells this ratio was decreased. We conclude that depletion of endogenous NO with L-NAME increased the production of SAH only in cells with mutated oncogenic RasH, possibly through enhancement of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative stress can increase cystathionine beta-synthase activity that switches methyl cycles from remethylation into transsulfuration pathway to maintain the intracellular glutathione pool (essential for the redox-regulating capacity of cells) via an adaptive process.",

NMR investigation shows that in water solution arenicin-2 (21-residue cationic peptide from marine polychaeta Arenicola marina) adopts significantly twisted b-hairpin conformation, stabilized by one disulfide bond. CD spectroscopic analysis indicates that arenicin-2 strongly binds to SDS and DPC micelles and to anionic lipid vesicles (POPE/POPG) in contrast to zwitterionic vesicles (POPC). NMR study revealed the formation of asymmetric arenicin dimers upon incorporation into the DPC micelle. Two monomers of arenicin-2 are aligned parallel to each other by the N-terminal strands of the -hairpin (CN\u203a\u203aNC type of association). PAGE analysis indicated that in environment of anionic SDS micelles the arenicin-2 undergoes further oligomerization and form tetramers. The spatial structure of ternary complexes peptide/Mn 2+ /DPC micelle was studied for two cyclotides: kalata-B1 and kalata-B7 (29-residue weakly cationic cyclic peptides from African perennial plant Oldenlandia affinis). The both cyclotides are monomeric in DPC micelles, share identical spatial scaffold (triple-stranded b-sheet, formed by b-hairpin and third short distorted strand, stabilized by three knot-forming disulfides) and possess similar divalent cation coordination site near invariant Glu3. In spite of the overall structural homology both cyclotides demonstrate different topology of peptide/micelle complexes. SDS-PAGE analysis and vesicle titration experiments indicated that in environment of anionic detergents or lipids kalata-B7 might undergo oligomerization and form trimers or tetramers. The obtained results point to the 'carpet/toroidal-pore' as the main mechanism of arenicins and cyclotides action.",

Bezakova Faculty of Pharmacy Comenius University, Bratislava, SLOVAKIA Introduction: Butyrylcholinesterase (3.1.1.8., BChE) has long been known as a detoxifying enzyme for playing a crucial role in the metabolism of xenobiotics. In recent years we have been investigating various sources (species, tissue), different molecular forms and changes in BChE activity under physiological and pathological conditions. During the observation of BChE activity in dyslipoproteinemic pathological diseases we found it especially interesting, that the activity of BChE correlated with the levels of blood lipoproteins. Surprisingly, after treatment with iso-ompa (specific inhibiotor of BChE) the levels of lipoproteins rectified. Following this, we were interested in the whole picture of BChE behaviour under various dyslipidemic conditions. Methods: Distinct animal models of metabolic lipoprotein disorders were created by dividing rats in three groups: diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia (HL), combination DM + HL. Streptozotocin (80 mg/ kg) and high-fat diet were used to develop DM and HL, respectively. After 2 weeks the animals were sacrified. BChE activity was measured by the Ellman method (Ellman G.L. et al., 1961) and molecular forms of BChE were identified by the means of native gel electrophoresis. Results: Altered BChE activity in dependence on the kind of tissue in all of studied models was reported. Moreover, modifications in the spectrum of molecular forms in contrast to control animals were described. Conclusion: We provide characterization of BChE on intertissue and interorgan level in a state of several metabolically distinct lipoprotein disorders.",

CYP21A1P pseudogenederived mutations, gene deletion and conversion are responsible for 95% of the cases. New and rare mutations are observed in the remaining mutated alleles. Clinical manifestations depend directly on the structurefunction relationship of mutant proteins. The rare R426C mutation, and the S113F, A265V, P267L and V358I novel mutations were identified for the first time in Brazilian patients. Methods: In order to test structural variations of CYP21A2 mutations a PDB-1DT6-based model was used, alterations in protein structure for these mutations were estimated in silico by Sting Millenium (EMBRAPA). Each enzyme variant was evaluated by comparing changes in polarity, distances to heme group and steroid binding site, and heme surface accessibility. The conservation of each aminoacid residue was compared by alignment to human, murine, canine, ovine, porcine, and bovine CYP21 sequence. Results: A265V and P267L mutations are not conserved residues whereas the aminoacid changes cause relevant structural changes in Hhelix end region because L267 residue loses the hydrophobic interaction with Q270. The S113, V358 and R426 are very conserved residues and F113, V265 and C426 substitutions resulted in drastic enzyme conformation changes. The predictions obtained for R426C in this model were similar to structural data in the literature. Conclusion: Hence, this study indicates structural analysis as a powerful tool for predicting effects of new mutations on the enzyme activity when biochemical functional analysis are not available, therefore molecular conclusions can expanded order to confirm clinical diagnosis.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the various metallocene dihalides and particularly their effects on cell proliferation of human breast and colon cancer cells. Methods: The compounds used were of the general formula R 2 MCl 2, where for compound [1] there was R= g 5 -C 5 H 5 and M=Ti, for [2] R= g 5 -C 5 H 5 and M=V, for [3] R= g 5 -CH 3 Introduction: Synthetic peptides of small length, based on Substance P C-terminal fragments, increase the secretion of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) and prevent the proliferation of several cancer cell lines. Tri-and tetra-peptides show antiproliferative activity against breast and prostate cancer cells. The aim of this study was the synthesis of a series of peptoid analogs of hexapeptide of the C-terminal region containing residues like D-Trp and Tic and the peptoid residues NHN(R)CH 2 CO and NPhe and Nala. Moreover we stydy their anticancer effect. Methods: Syntheses were carried out stepwise by SPPS on 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin and DIC/HOBt as coupling reagent. Breast cancer epithelial MDA-MB-231 and HT-29 colon cancer cell lines were cultured in absence or presence of hydrazino-peptoids for 48 hours, in presence and abscence of serum and cell proliferation was documented by WST-1 method. Results: In order to study the influence of D-Trp on the antiproliferative activity against cancer cells, D-Trp was incorporated in positions 4 and 6. Purification and identification was performed by HPLC and ESI-MS, respectively. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated cation channels, located mainly on postsynaptic membranes, responsible for cell communication through neurotransmitters. Seventeen different subunits compose homo-or heteropentamers and the stoichiometry gives the features of the individual receptor. The nAChRs composed of a4 and b2 subunits (a4b2-nAChR) are the predominant subtype in the central nervous system, they are mainly responsible for addiction to nicotine and are thought to be implicated in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases; this makes them possible targets for drug design. This aim would be facilitated by the knowledge of the structure of their ligand-binding domains. Our aim is to produce properly folded domains of this nAChR for structural studies. To this purpose, wild type and mutated forms of a4 and b2 extracellular domains (ECDs) of the human nAChR were expressed in Pichia pastoris. Size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering, showed an improvement in solubility when the a4 and b2 ECDs are coexpressed. To further enhance the formation of pentamers, we linked the ECDs from the individual subunits with an (AGS) 8 24-peptide. In addition to the observed increased solubility of the linked ECDs compared with the individually expressed or coexpressed a4-with b2-ECDs, the formation of dipentamers can be suggested in which (a4) 2 (b2) 3 pentamer is linked to the (a4)3(b2)2 pentamer. We conclude that functional assembly of the ECDs is possible and will be further investigated prior to the initiation of crystallization trials.",

Proline is known to have an important role in the adaptation of plant cells to drought and salinity stress. In this work, a cDNA coding for pea OAT was obtained by reverse transcription of pea seedling mRNA followed by PCR amplification. A PCR product of about 1500 bp, whose identity was verified by DNA sequencing (GenBank acccesion number EU414030), was cloned and expressed in E. coli to obtain C-terminally 6xHis-tagged recombinant protein. To achieve expression, the cDNA was digested by NcoI and XhoI, ligated into the pET28b+ plasmid vector and then used for transformation of NEB Express Competent E. coli cells. The cells were cultured in a liquid medium, harvested by centrifugation and disrupted for isolating the soluble cytoplasmic fraction.

At the present day, many tyrosinase inhibitors have been evaluated in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals because they become important to prevent hyperpigmentation of the skin. However, many of these inhibitors suffer from limitations, such as low activities, high cytotoxicities, insufficient skin penetration and low stabilities in formulations. In this study, we tried to identify novel tyrosinase inhibitors that can overcome those limitations by structure-based computational approach.

(ii) We estimated our chemical virtual library using structurebased virtual screening. (iii) Small molecules that showed high scores were examined inhibitory activities to both mushroom and human tyrosinases by in vitro assay. As a result, we identified a unique Com-pound23 as a novel tyrosinase inhibitor. The Compound23 showed inhibitory effects on mushroom and human tyrosinases in a dose dependent manner, and the ID 50 values were established to be 0.1 lM and 2.0 lM, respectively. Therefore, these results indicate that our screening system is useful for discovering new tyrosinase inhibitors.

Kornelyuk Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Kiev, UKRAINE Introduction: Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) catalyzes specific attachment of tyrosine to the acceptor stem of cognate tRNA. Mammalian cytoplasmic TyrRS is composed of two structural modules: N-terminal catalytic core and cytokine-like C-terminal domain separated by unstructured linker. The C-domain belongs to a class of partially unfolded proteins, with transiently disordered regions between amino acids 95 and 123. One of the major obstacles in doing biochemical analyses of the isolated C-domain is its tendency to aggregate. This property is typical for the protein with transiently disordered regions. Methods: Docking of C-domain with itself followed by structural analysis of the interface has shown that three amino acids may play key role in aggregate formation. In vitro analysis confirmed low aggregation propensity of TyrRS triple mutant E120K, N150P and M152E. We have compared 10 ns molecular dynamic trajectories (GROMACS) of wild-type C-domain with its computationally engineered triple mutant at four temperatures (310, 315, 321 and 328K). Results: The secondary structure content of mutant protein increases with temperature rise -yet another typical feature of intrinsically disordered aggregating proteins. Correlation analysis shows that the mutant also exhibits much lower motions amplitude. We have shown previously that wt C-domain starts transition into molten globule at 328K. Conclusions: We hypothesize that since process of aggregation is often preceded by formation of molten globule (hydrophobic residues are getting exposed to solvent), an overall stabilization of mutant secondary structure and decrease in motions amplitude may preclude it from exposing more hydrophobic patches, transiting into molten globule, and, therefore, aggregating.",

The eutB (a) and eutC (b) genes in the eut operon of E. coli were cloned and expressed at high levels. The purified apoEAL existed as a a6b6 complex. At high concentrations, it formed inactive precipitates which were reactivated by a dithiothreitol treatment. Limited proteolysis of the enzyme by trypsin led to the removal of the N-terminal 28 amino acid residues from the b subunit without loss of enzyme activity. Several kinds of EALs that lack the N-terminal 28 residues of b subunit and contain a His 6 -tag were expressed and purified by a Nichelate affinity column, and their properties studied. When the eutB and eutC genes were placed under the control of tac or T7 promoter in this order, subunit compositions of the purified enzymes were imbalanced, but the imbalanced expression was much improved when the order of genes was reversed. Km values for substrate and AdoCbl as well as inactivation properties in the absence of substrate and in the presence of substrate analog 2-aminopropanol were not affected, while the susceptibility to SH inhibitors was lowered, by the N-terminal truncation and C34S mutation. EALs with truncated b subunit and His6tag were not precipitated/inactivated at high concentrations. A trun-cated enzyme was crystallized in complex with cyanocobalamin and ethanolamine, and the structure of EAL was analyzed by X-ray crystallography. The mechanism of action of EAL is discussed on the basis of its active-site structure. Introduction: Burkholderia sp. MBA4 produces a haloacid permease, Deh4p, which mediated the uptake of haloacid as a growth substrate. Deh4p contains 552 residues with a mass of 59.4 kDa. Structural prediction of Deh4p suggested the presence of 11 or 12 transmembrane helices. Most of these predictions suggested that the N terminus is located in the cytoplasm. In this study we reported the determination of the topology of Deh4p by using a PhoA-LacZ dual-reporter system. Methods: PhoA is an alkaline phosphatase which only works in the periplasm while beta-galactosidase (LacZ) is an enzyme that works in the cytoplasm. DNA fragments encoding various lengths of deh4p were amplified by PCR and fused in-frame with a phoA-lacZ cassette. These recombinant plasmids were transformed and the fusion proteins expressed in E. coli using a weak constitutive promoter. Enzyme activities of PhoA and LacZ were determined to localize the whereabouts of the reporter and thus the authenticity of the transmembrane domains. Results: The expression of the membrane proteins did not affect the growth of the cells. More than 36 constructs were made and transformed into E. coli. The PhoA/LacZ enzyme activity ratios for these clones have been determined using PNPP and ONPG. The results showed that the first two and the last two predicted transmembrane domains were absent. Conclusions: The current results suggested that there are at most eight transmembrane domains found in Deh4p. The N-and the Cterminals were located in the cytoplasm and a large loop was exposed in the periplasm.",

Druggable compounds which inhibit or activate those significant protein targets must be researched rapidly. Many researches are using in-silico screening program such as DOCK, Auto-Dock and GOLD using classical mechanical potentials. We report the new method which uses simulated annealing based on bio-informatics on the protein-ligand flexible docking. Methods: We use docking engine based upon bioinformatics such as protein structure prediction and effective usage for many X-ray or NMR structures of protein-ligand complex. An amino acid sequence of the target protein which is query sequence are aligned in the filter of CE Z-Score 3.7 for biological similarity significant with the PDB database with some BLAST alignment methods. In the stage of liganddocking, fingerprint (FP) is used as the basis set in the bio-informatics based simulated annealing. FP is composed of two, three or four atoms. Moreover this FP includes the information of atom-type such as used in Sybyl atom-type [[REF=]] and bond-type. Next FP alignment score is defined to determine the docking pose of the ligand to be the most stable one. Results: We could make the docking and screening method based upon bio-informatics newly.

Conclusions: A new docking and screening method based upon bioinformatics were made, and this method covers new docking poses different from classical mechanical potential methods.",

Methods: SAXS data were collected at the BL40B2 in the Spring-8 synchrotron radiation facility (Hyogo, Japan). Scattering profiles in the small-angle region were analyzed by Guinier's approximation for monodispersive systems and then, the radius of gyration and the forward scattering intensity were calculated. Molecular structures of the polypeptides were predicted by applying the ab initio structure determination program. Results and discussion: The radius of gyration was estimated to be 19.4 \u00c5 for L-PGDS, 18.8 \u00c5 for L-PGDS/RA, 17.3 \u00c5 for L-PGDS/BR and 17.8 \u00c5 for L-PGDS/BV complexes. Alternatively, the radius of gyration of bLG and RBP (20.3 and 26.2 \u00c5 , respectively) was almost the same before and after the binding of RA. Moreover, the ab initio model of L-PGDS and three complexes showed not only that the overall structure of molecule was globular in shape, but also that complexes have become more compact than L-PGDS upon ligand binding. All SAXS data suggested that the L-PGDS molecule had the structural flexibility to accommodate different kinds of lipophilic ligands. Such flexibility of the L-PGDS molecule must be a main factor for the broad selectivity of L-PGDS.",

            "text": "Structural studies of natural killer cell receptor family NKR-P1 Introduction: Natural killer cells are able to directly kill tumour cells without previous antigen sensitization. NK cell receptors are divided in two structural groups: immunoglobuline and C-type lectin. From the latter group, first identified signalling molecule was named NKR-P1 (also known as CD161 or KLRB1). Several members of this receptor gene family are known now from rodents, but only single one was found in human. As there is no crystal structure of any of NKR-P1 receptor molecules yet, hope is we can shed light onto these closely relative but functionally divergent proteins. Methods: Cloning via standard protocols, recombinant expression, HPLC, analytical ultracentrifugation, dynamic light scaterring, dropcoating deposition Raman spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography. Results: We cloned lectin domains of rat and human NKR-P1 receptors into pRSETB vector and recombinantly produced them in E. coli ArcticExpress expression system. Extensive HPLC purification was followed by characterization by DLS, AUC, DCDR and MS techniques. Crystallization trials were set up in hanging drop arrangement. Conclusions: We successfully cloned desired genes and were able to produce them as soluble proteins which preparation and characterization is shown. Crystallization is currently in progress. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are constantly exposed to blood flowinduced shear stress. Shear flow, which is atheroprotective, stimulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity. Recent study suggests that nitric oxide (NO)-mediated S-nitrosylation (-S-NO) is a key posttranslational modification of proteins. The effect of eNOS-derived NO on redox-sensitive protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) in ECs was examined. Using Biotin Switch method, a flow dependent S-nitrosylation of PTPs including PTP1B, PTEN and SHP2 was observed in ECs after the onset of flow. ECs transiently transfected with PTP containing catalytic cysteine mutant (Flag-SHP2 C459S or HA-PTP1B C215S ) abolished the flow-induced S-nitrosylation, indicating that this redox-sensitive Cys is the vulnerable target of NO. ECs under flow, similar to NO donor (SNAP) treatment, reversibly inhibited the SHP2 activity via this S-nitrosylation. ECs pretreating with an eNOS inhibitor (L-NAME) significantly suppressed this flow-induced S-nitrosylation in SHP2. In contrast, ECs pretreating with DPI, an inhibitor to NADPH oxidase (NOX), or SiRNA to NOX2/NOX4 to decrease intracellular ROS significantly enhanced flow-induced S-nitrosylation of SHP2. Consistently, ECs exposed to H 2 O 2 alone decreased the S-nitrosylation of SHP2. Our results indicate that major PTPs in ECs under flow are predominantly S-nitrosylated at catalytic Cys residue. NO and ROS appear to compete for the catalytic site in PTP. We conclude that S-nitrosylation of PTP is a key posttranslational control of PTP activity in ECs under flow. This S-nitrosylation may protect PTP from ROS-induced irreversible oxidation and thus play an important role in controlling signaling responses in ECs. Introduction: The deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (DAOCS) from Streptomyces clavuligerus was directly evolved for enhancement of penicillin G (PenG) expansion into phenylacetyl-7-aminodeacetoxycephalosporanic acid (G-7-ADCA), an important precursor for industrial manufacture of cephalosporin. The current industrial synthesis of 7-ADCA includes complicated chemical expansion of the five-membered thiazolidine ring of PenG into the six-membered dihydrothiazine ring of G-7-ADCA, followed by enzymatic removal of side chain. Since the chemical ring expansion is expensive and polluting, the development of alternative biosynthetic methods has been studied for decades. Methods: A two-step screening was developed to select desirable mutants from hydroxylamine random mutagenesis, error-prone PCRbased random mutagenesis and DNA shuffling. Results: The S. clavuligerus DAOCS was directly modified for enhancement of PenG expansion for industrial production of 7-ADCA. Fifteen point mutations with 1.4-to 14.2-fold increases in the k cat /K m ratio were obtained by site-directed and random mutagenesis. Subsequently, DNA shuffling was carried out to screen possible combinations of these substitutions. Three mutants with increased activity were found. Conclusions: SC59, SC14 and SC63 mutants with increased k cat /K m ratios of 41-, 51-and 60-fold were obtained using directed evolution. SC63 showed the highest increase on binding of PenG (22-fold) with 2.8-fold improvement on conversion rate. SC14 showed the best improvement on conversion rate (6-fold) with 9-fold increased binding affinity. SC59 showed 14-fold and 3-fold improvements in K m and k cat values. This study provides not only promising enzymes for cephalosporin biosynthesis, but also some unpredictable combination of mutations, which reveal new insights into the structure-function relationship of this protein.",

Recent studies suggested that potent XIAP antagonists that bind its BIR3 domain may have promising potential as a new class of anti-cancer drugs. However, because the binding interfaces are modulated by protein-protein interactions (PPI), it is difficult to develop effective drug compounds to inhibit these processes. Identification of hot spot residues can be a good first approach in a PPI targeted drug lead design, because it is known that binding free energy of PPI is mainly from amino acid residues in hot spots. Here we try to identify hot spots by per-residue binding free energy decomposition for PPI using Molecular docking and MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born-Solvent Accessibility) scoring. To evaluate the performance of our approach, 37 peptide antagonists of XIAP, whose dissociation constants are known, were considered. The correlation coefficient (R 2 ) between experimental binding free energy and MM-GBSA scoring is 0.585. This result shows that our approach could predict accurate binding modes and binding free energies. On the decomposition analysis, K299, G306, T308, D309, E314, and W323 were revealed to contribute < -3.5 kcal/mol to the effective energy. Therefore, we propose these amino acids as hot spot residues on the XIAP binding interface. The efficient identification of hot spot residues using the computational approach may be useful to the development of PPI modulator drugs.",

Spyroulias 2 and I. Zarkadis 1 1 Department of Biology, School of Medicine, University of Patras, Patras, GREECE, 2 Department of Pharmacy, University of Patras, Patras, GREECE Introduction: Properdin is a plasma glycoprotein and the only known naturally occurring positive regulator of the complement system, stabilizing the alternative pathway convertase (C3bBb). In order to elucidate the molecular evolution of properdin factor P (pfc), here we report the cloning and characterization of three gene isoforms of properdin in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Methods and results: The predicted polypeptide sequences of trout properdins pfc1, pfc2 and pfc3 (447, 449, and 447 amino acids, respectively) share 78-90% identity to each other showing the highest identity score (47%) with their zebrafish ortholog protein. The six TSR domains of the three trout properdin isoforms seem to adopt the folding pattern of human thrombospondin 1 TSP-1 domains, where each TSP-1 domain forms an antiparallel three-stranded structure that consists of alternative stacked layers of Trp and Arg residues from respective strands capped by disulfide bonds on each end. The trout pfc2 and pfc3 genes are arranged in nine and ten exons, respectively, which span 3.5 kb of the genome. Liver, in contrast to the expression profile of the properdin gene in mammals, is the main source of the trout properdin mRNA transcripts. In a phylogenetic analysis, trout pfc1, pfc2 and pfc3 genes are clustered with their orthologs from other teleost species. Conclusion: This is the first report of three separate genes coding for properdin factor P in a vertebrate species. The trout pfc proteins resemble to the 'domain' architecture of mammalian ortholgs, while, in contrast to the mammalian properdins, trout pfc genes are expressed mainly in liver.",

            "text": "Human muscle fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is highly sensitive toward calcium ions due to Glu69: comparative study of the Glu69 localisation in vertebrate muscle FBPases M. Zarzycki and A. Dzugaj Institute of Zoology, University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, POLAND Introduction: Two FBPase isozymes: liver (regulatory enzyme of gluconeogenesis) and muscle (regulatory enzyme of glyconeogenesis) were found in vertebrates. Recently we have found that unlike liver isozyme, muscle FBPase is highly sensitive toward inhibition by calcium ions due to Glu 69 . In the muscle isozyme the presence of two acidic residues (Asp 68 , Glu 69 ) interacting with calcium might stabilize the loop 50-70 in the inactive position, whilst in the liver isozyme the position of 69 is occupied by Gln. In the present paper we have attempted to answer the question if the other vertebrate muscle FBPases contain also Glu in position 69. Methods: Chemical modification, site-directed mutagenesis, BLAST program. Results: Comparative study of available FBPase sequences among 11 mammalian species revealed high sequence homology of the loop 50-70. The 69 residue is exclusively occupied by glutamic acid in muscle isoenzyme and glutamine in liver FBPase. The high homology of the loop 50-70 was also observed in chicken, snake and frog FBPases: containing Glu 69 in muscle and Gln 69 in liver isozymes. In some fish species (e.g. Tetrarodon, Gastrosteus) Glu is substituted with Asp in muscle isozyme. Nevertheless it confirms that an acidic residue is indispensable for calcium binding. Conclusions: Hypothetically speaking during evolution the replacement of Gln to Glu dramatically changed the kinetic properties of the new isoenzyme, making the muscle FBPase more sensitive toward inhibition by calcium and enabling regulation of glyconeogenesis by calcium. In Gram-negative bacteria membrane-protein channels, also known as porins, constitute the entry point of various classes of antibiotics. With the advent of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, porins are becoming a prime target. The outer membrane porin F (OmpF) is the major outer membrane protein component of Escherichia coli and bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics showed either underexpression or mutations of OmpF. To study antibiotic translocation at a molecular scale, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with the metadynamics algorithm. This recently designed algorithm overcomes the time scale problem of classical MD by accelerating some reaction coordinates. We compared the following methodologies: modeling (i) OmpF in its monomeric or trimeric form and (ii) membranes as surrounding detergent molecules or as lipid bilayers. Furthermore, we considered antibiotics of different structural, chemical and physical properties (penicillins, fluorokinolones, cephalosporines). Earlier MD studies on the OmpF trimer reported structural differences between each monomer. Differences arising from some key mutations were also investigated. However, the influence of such differences on antibiotic translocation is not clear. To answer this question we performed a careful structural analysis of our simulations in the different conditions stated above. We reveal the reciprocal influence of each monomer and the role of single residues and loops L2-L3. We also calculated the cross sectional surface area at the pore constriction zone and determined the preferred binding sites for the antibiotics. Overall, our results are in good agreement with experiments. This work directly benefits the design of new antibiotics with improved transport properties. Introduction: Phospholipase D (PLD) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to form phosphatidic acid and choline. PLD activity is thought to be involved in a broad range of physiological responses, including rapid responses such as secretion and superoxide generation, as well as in long-term responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and immune response. CKII is a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase and plays a critical role, not only in cell growth and proliferation, but also in anti-apoptosis. Methods: CK2 activity was assessed using a specific peptide substrate. Gene expression was investigated by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting analysis. Protein-protein interaction was examined by immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assay.",

This PLDinduced CK2b degradation was mediated by ubiquitin-proteasome machinery. The C-terminal domains of PLD interacted with the N-terminal domain of CK2b.

            "text": "Post-translational activation of IAP(s): a conserved mechanism from Drosophila to mammals Although IAPs are best known for their ability to bind and neutralise caspases, they also fulfil signalling function that are independent of caspases such as ubiquitin-dependent survival signalling, cell migration and receptor-mediated NF-kB activation. IAPs harbour a C-terminal RING finger domain, which provides them with E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. Recent data suggest that IAPs are not constitutively active as E3s but require activation through post-translational modification. Thus, the E3 activity of the Drosophila IAP DIAP1 is regulated through phosphorylation by DmIKKe (Drosophila IKK-related kinase). Once phosphorylated DIAP1 is activated, the protein is selfubiquitylated and degraded through the proteosome. Consequently, active caspases can take part in non-apoptotic signalling events [1] . Using large scale affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometric analysis, we have identified TWINS, a regulatory subunit of the the serin-threonine phosphatase PP2A, as a DIAP1 interaction partner. We are currently testing whether PP2A antagonises DmIKKe-mediated activation of DIAP1's E3 ligase activity. Thus, the anti-apoptotic activity of DIAP1 may be under the tight regulatory control of both DmIKKe and PP2A. Moreover, we have also found that the mammalian IAP, c-IAP1, specifically interacts with PR55, the mammalian orthologue of Drosophila TWINS. Thus, our preliminary results suggest that the activity of c-IAP1, like the one of DIAP1, is under the control of kinases and phosphatases. Given the evolutionarily conservation of this regulatory circuit, it is likely that this post-translational modification fulfils an important regulatory function. It is now well established that proteins labeled with ubiquitin (Ub) may lead to proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitination also controls the function and intracellular localization of a wide variety of proteins. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) involve in various cellular processes, such as DNA damage repair, nuclear transport, chromosome segregation, signal transduction, cell division, stress response, oncogenesis, inflammatory response in mammals and the regulation of flowering time in plants. Some reports have shown that reactive oxygen species may trigger the ubiquitination system, and the levels of SUMO conjugates increased substantially following exposure of animal cells or plants to heat shock, ethanol and hydrogen peroxide. Here we report that hydrogen peroxide and arsenite caused dramatic inductions of ubiquitination and sumoylation respectively in cells. In order to set up a suitable study system, we have generated cell lines stably expressing HA-tagged Ub, HA-tagged SUMO1 and FLAG-tagged SUMO2. Using S5a-conjugated agarose beads or immunoprecipitation with antibodies against SUMO1 and SUMO2, molecules targeted by Ub and SUMOs were purified from hydrogen peroxide or arsenite-treated cells respectively. Samples were further processed by USP2 or SENP1 for removing Ub or SUMO and subjected to SDS-PAGE, 2D-PAGE and Mass Spectrometry analysis. Because the Ub conjugates and SUMO conjugates induced by cytotoxic stress and genotoxic stress in cells have not been systematically studied, this new approach using ubiquitin-specific protease and SUMO-specific protease reveals a specific way for refining the data and eliminating the non-specific binding caused by the conventional affinity chromatography. The Par polarity complex consisting of the evolutionarily conserved proteins mPar3, mPar6, and atypical PKCs (aPKCs) regulates cell polarity in many cell types including neurons. In neurons, the establishment of polarity is directed by the sequential activity of the GTPases Rap1B and Cdc42. Rap1B is initially present in all neurites of unpolarised neurons, but becomes restricted to the tip of a single process where it specifies axonal identity. Here we show that mPar3 is required for the establishment of neuronal polarity and links the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 to Kinesin-2. Smurf2 ensures that neurons extend only a single axon by initiating the degradation of inactive Rap1B through the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Its interaction with mPar3 is required to localize Smurf2 to growth cones and restrict Rap1B to a single axon. Interfering with the binding of mPar3 to Kinesin-2 or of Smurf2 to mPar3 and knockdown of mPar3 by RNA interference (RNAi) disrupt the establishment of neuronal polarity through the failure to restrict Rap1B to a single neurite. Introduction: Schizosaccharomyces pombe Btb3p, which has two ankyrin repeats and two BTB/POZ domains at the N-and C-terminals, respectively, functions as a putative substrate-specific adaptor for Pcu3p-based ubiquitin ligase. BPOZ-2, which is involved in the growth suppressive effect of PTEN, has a high degree of amino acid sequence homology to that of Btb3p. Since the proteins with the BTB/POZ domain have been considered to function as the substrate-specific adaptors for CUL3-based E3 ligases, we speculated that BPOZ-2 is a human counterpart of Btb3p and functions as a substrate-specific adaptor for CUL3-based E3 ligase. Methods: Interactions between proteins were examined by immunoprecipitation, GST pull-down, and yeast two-hybrid assays. We identified the substrates of BPOZ-2 by the yeast two-hybrid screening of a human thymus cDNA library using BPOZ-2 as the bait. The in vivo ubiquitination assay was performed by transfecting several combinations of plasmids together with His-tagged Ub vector into 293T cells.",

TS levels inversely correlate with sensitivity of cells to TS inhibitors; therefore, we have focused on degradation of the enzyme as a determinant of its intracellular concentration. We have shown that TS degradation is mediated by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent manner, and is regulated by the unstructured N-terminal domain of the enzyme. We hypothesized that the disordered nature of the N-terminal domain, perhaps promoted by the region's high Pro content, along with a free, non-acetylated N-terminus are necessary for recognition by, and entry into, the proteasomal chamber. Using 2D-gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS, we analyzed the acetylation status of the N-terminal residue of both wild-type and several mutant forms of TS. We observed that unstable TS polypeptides (i.e., the wild-type enzyme and the P2A and P2G mutants) have a free, non-acetylated Nterminus; in contrast, stable polypeptides (i.e., all other substitutions at Pro2) are N-alpha-acetylated. Deletion of the proline-rich regions within the N-terminal domain of the wild-type enzyme led to 3-fold stabilization of the polypeptide, while conversion of all Pro residues to Ala had no appreciable effect. Finally, we determined that the N-terminus is the proteasome entry site for degradation, and that proteolysis occurs from the N-toward the C-terminus. Our results shed light into the mechanism of ubiquitin-independent degradation of TS, and provide possibilities to modulate the enzyme's intracellular concentration that might lead to enhancing therapeutic efficacy of TS inhibitors.",

Misfolded proteins and unassembled protein complexes that fail to assume their functional states in the endoplasmic reticulum are subjected to ERAD, which involves retrotranslocation into the cytosol and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Fbs1/Fbx2, a member of the F-box protein family, recognizes highmannose oligosaccharides. To elucidate the structural basis of SCF Fbs1 function, we determined the crystal structures of the Skp1-Fbs1 complex and the sugar binding domain (SBD) of the Fbs1-RNaseB complex at 2.4 and 2.7 \u00c5 resolutions, respectively. Results: The structure of the Skp1-Fbs1 complex illustrates a different class of F-box proteins within the SCF ubiquitin ligase model. The mechanistic model indicated by the structures appears to be well conserved among the SCF ubiquitin ligases.

Downregulation of S6K signalling occurs through the actions of S/T phosphatases (PP2A and PP1) and tumor suppressors (TSC1/2 and PTEN). The overexpression of S6K1 in various cancer cell lines and tumors, and the oncogenic potential of its splicing form has been reported. The increased expression of S6K1 has been linked to gene amplification and translational upregulation of S6K1 transcript. We have recently found that both forms of S6K are modified by ubiquitination. Following these findings, we demonstrate here that S6K1 associates specifically with ubiqutin ligase ROC1 in vitro and in vivo. The interaction was initially identified in the yeast two-hybrid screening and further confirmed by pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays.

A dysregulation in its activity leads to melanin accumulation in the skin and problems with skin staining such as lentigos. The proteasome is responsible for tyrosinase degradation. In a previous study [1] we have shown that a polyunsaturated fatty acid rich algae extract from Phaeodactylum tricornutum had a stimulating effect on proteasome peptidase. Methods: The human melanocyte cell line MNT-1 was treated with Phaeodactylum tricornutum for 24 hours. Proteasome and tyrosinase activities and amounts as well as melanin concentration were monitored before and after treatment. Results: In this study, we have found that the algae extract can activate the proteasome, but does not increase its quantity in the treated human MNT-1 melanocytes. This proteasome stimulation was associated with an increased tyrosinase degradation and a decreased melanin accumulation. In addition, immunoprecipitation experiments showed that tyrosinase was less ubiquitinated suggesting that its degradation by the proteasome was more efficient. Conclusions: These results indicate that stimulation of the proteasome could serve as a new strategy for modulating skin pigmentation and for preventing melanin accumulation in lentigos. Introduction: Pex5p recognizes newly synthesized peroxisomal matrix proteins in the cytosol and transports them to the peroxisomal membrane where it participates in a network of protein-protein interactions with components of the docking/translocation machinery. These interactions ultimately result in the insertion of Pex5p and the translocation of the cargo-protein across the organelle membrane. After this step, Pex5p is exported and becomes available for new cycles of transportation. Recently, it was suggested that yeast Pex5p needs to be monoubiquitinated to be exported from the membrane. In this work, we addressed whether this step also occurs in mammals. Methods: To determine if mammalian Pex5p is ubiquitinated, we used an in vitro import assay comprising a rat liver postnuclear supernatant and 35 S-labeled Pex5p/Pex5pC11S. GST-ubiquitin was included in some experiments to facilitate the identification of ubiquitinated species. Results: We demonstrate for the first time that ubiquitin is involved in Pex5p-mediated import pathway in mammals. Two different kinds of ubiquitination could be observed. One of these is thiol-sensitive and involves conjugation of ubiquitin to Cys11 of Pex5p. This ubiquitination is required for Pex5p export back into the cytosol. Conclusion: Our data reveals the existence of an ubiquitin-conjugation cascade acting on mammalian Pex5p during its transient passage through the importomer. Here, Pex5p is ubiquitinated via a thiol-ester bond at Cys11, an unusual type of ubiquitination that may be more common in nature than previously considered.",

Tanaka Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, JAPAN Recruitment of substrates to the 26S proteasome for their destruction usually requires covalent attachment of the Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chain. In contrast, modifications with the Lys63-linked polymeric chain and/or monomeric ubiquitin are known to function in proteasomeindependent cellular processes. However, the ubiquitin chain-type specificity for the proteasomal targeting are still poorly understood. Using mass spectrometry, we show here that Rsp5, a ubiquitin-ligase in budding yeast, catalyzes entirely the formation of homopolymeric Lys63linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Unexpectedly, the 26S proteasome degraded well the Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated substrate in vitro. In addition, while the membrane-anchored transcriptional factor Mga2-p120 is modified by both Lys48-and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains in a steady state, the level of Lys63-linked chains is significantly increased by proteasome inhibition in vivo. Furthermore, chase experiments revealed that Mga2-p120 processing was retarded by overproduction of Lys63-mutated ubiquitin in vivo. Our results suggest that Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains may function in an alternative proteasomal targeting signal. The proteasome is a multicatalytic protease responsible for the breakdown of intracellular proteins. We have previously described in vitro and in vivo proteasomal S-glutathionylation and in vitro deglutathionylation by glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2). Moreover, proteasomal multicatalytic activity was proved to be modulated by both mechanisms. The thioloxidoreductase Grx2 is able to enter the catalytic core to deglutathionylate the proteasome by an ubiquitin-independent mechanism and concomitantly degraded. Since the S-glutathionylated redox state of the proteasome was more effective to degrade Grx2 as well as oxidized proteins, the purpose of this study was to analyze protein fragments generated by the proteasome at different redox states taken Grx2 as model. Rates of degradation were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and the peptide products through mass spectrometry by comparing DTTreduced and partially S-glutathionylated proteasomal preparations. Results revealed that the products of degradation differed according to the proteasomal redox state. Results accumulated thus far indicate that S-glutathionylation seems to be an important post-translational modification of the proteasome. Our hypothesis is that proteasomal redox modulation may have a significant functional role during oxidative stress and antigen presentation since higher eukaryotic proteasomes are also redox modulated. In normal cells, p53 is present at low concentration due to its rapid turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the role of the ubiquitin ligases Mdm2, COP1, Pirh2, TOPORS and CHIP. The aim of our project was to determine whether p53 is labeled for ubiquitylation in senescent cells by specific ligases. We used HFL-1 fibroblasts and observed reduced protein levels of p53, which was accompanied by a decrease in protein levels of Mdm2 and a slight decrease in the RNA and protein levels of COP1 in senescent cells. In contrast, protein levels of Pirh2 and TOPORS were not altered, but there was a slight increase in RNA and protein levels of CHIP. In senescence caused by partial inhibition of the proteasome, p53 ligases followed similar expression patterns as in natural replicative senescence. Since Nutlin-3 has been established as a specific inhibitor of the p53-Mdm2 interaction, we were then interested in identifying the effect of this inhibition on the other ligases of p53. Pre-treatment of young and senescent cells with Nutlin-3 stabilized p53 leading to induction of its transcriptional targets, Mdm2 and p21. After removing the inhibitor, p53 was rapidly decreased, while no significant change was observed for COP1, Pirh2, CHIP and TOPORS, suggesting that Mdm2 is a central key molecule to the regulation of p53. In conclusion, a differential effect of ubiquitin ligases on p53 regulation has been observed, and more direct interactions are currently under investigation.",

The ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates many cellular processes via specific protein degradation. Proteomic analysis of oocytes demonstrated that UCH-L1 was one of the most abundant oocyte proteins during meiotic maturation [1] . Methods: To study role of UCH-L1 in the process of fertilisation in bovine model we used the specific inhibitors of this enzyme, UCH-L1 inhibitor (isatin O-acyl oxime derivate) and inhibitor 16 [3-Amino-2keto-7H-thieno(2,3-b)pyridin-6-one derivate]. To further investigate the UCH-L1, we analysed the oocytes by SDS/ Native PAGE, Western blotting, immunocytochemistry/confocal microscopy and oocytes undergo in vitro fertilization. Results: The level of ubiquitinated proteins and monoubiquitin in oocytes treated with inhibitors is increased in comparison with control. Treated eggs have significantly higher rate of polyspermy in in vitro fertilization assays (46% vs. 13%). UCH-L1 is localized at cytoplasmatic membrane in both control and treated oocyte during meiosis. Conclusion: Our results unveil that the UCH-L1 is essential in fertilization process where contribute to the block of polyspermy in mammalian eggs.",

Yabanoglou Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Hacettepe University, Ancara, TURKEY Introduction: Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), which catalyzes the oxidative conversion of primary amines, was suggested to play a scavenger role in the case of overproduction of many endogenous/exogenous amines. There is limited data concerning the substrate competition towards SSAO. Methods: Substrate competition toward the purified SSAO from rat lung by Cibacron Blue 3GA-agarose and Concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatographies were evaluated by kinetic studies. Results: Oxidation of benzylamine by purified SSAO was obeyed at only low concentrations. High substrate inhibition was detected with benzylamine. Oxidation of methylamine by purified SSAO obeyed to the Michaelis-Menten behavior, and no high substrate inhibition was detected for the oxidation of SSAO by MA. The ability of some biogenic amines such as tyramine, kynuramine, methylamine, dopamine, serotonin (5-HT) and phenylethylamine to interfere with the metabolism of benzylamine by SSAO was determined. Kynuramine was found to be the most potent inhibitory amine which behaved as a non-competitive inhibitor. The rest of the amines tested for rat lung SSAO inhibited benzylamine metabolism in a decreasing order as methylamine, dopamine, serotonin and phenylethylamine. These amines behaved as competitive inhibitors of BA metabolism by rat lung SSAO suggesting that they possibly compete with the substrate for the active site of the enzyme. Tyramine did not show any inhibitory effect on the oxidation of benzylamine by rat lung SSAO. Conclusions: It was shown that all the amines tested, except tyramine, inhibited the benzylamine oxidation by rat lung SSAO suggesting that there is a competition between the endogenous amines towards SSAO.

Park Yonsei University, Seoul, KOREA Introduction: Ubiquitin (Ub) fused linearly to the N-terminus of a protein is efficiently removed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in the cell. However, the Ub moiety rendered noncleavable by DUBs acts as a signal for degradation of the fusion protein. Genetic and biochemical analyses have revealed key enzymes involved in UFD pathway in yeast, including the E3 Ub ligase. Human E3 Ub ligase for the UFD pathway has not been studied so far. Methods: To investigate the role of TRIP12 in the UFD pathway, expression of TRIP12 was blocked by transfection of TRIP12-specific siRNAs into HeLa cells, and the stability of the UFD substrate was evaluated. In addition, the ubiquitination of UFD substrate was reconstituted with purified recombinant proteins. Results: Knockdown of TRIP12 expression stabilized the UFD substrate but not the N-end rule substrate. Expression of siRNA-resistant TRIP12 rescued the defect in the UFD pathway. Surprisingly, the TRIP12 HECT domain alone reversed suppression of the UFD pathway in TRIP12 knockdown cells. In an in vitro ubiquitination assay system, TRIP12 HECT domain mediated ubiquitination of the UFD substrate in conjunction with E1, E2, and E4 enzymes.",

Introduction: In the present study, the response of aB-crystallin to hydrogen peroxide (simulating oxidative stress) and calpain inhibitors was investigated. The high expression levels of this sHsp in cardiac muscle underline its significant role in preservation of homeostasis under adverse conditions. Methods: H9c2 cardiac myoblasts were used as our experimental model since their response reflects the signal transduction pathways activated by stress conditions in the myocardium. We performed immunoblot analysis parallel to immunofluorescent and immunoprecipitation experiments. Results: In H 2 O 2 -and calpain inhibitors (ALLN, ALLM)-treated H9c2 cells, the mechanism regulating aB-crystallin phosphorylation was found to involve primarily intracellular free calcium levels and subsequently the p38-MAPK signalling pathway. Phosphorylated aBcrystallin was demonstrated to be co-localized with tubulin, potentially preserving cytoskeletal architecture. Prolonged calpain activity repression ultimately led to apoptosis confirmed by PARP fragmentation and chromatin condensation. However, the apoptotic pathways activated by ALLM and ALLN differed, indicating the diverse transduction mechanisms triggered. Furthermore, an anti-apoptotic role for phospho-aB-crystallin was verified by confirmation of its interaction with pro-caspase 3, hindering its cleavage and subsequent activation in ALLM-treated H9c2 cells. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings highlight aB-crystallin fundamental role as an effector mediating cardiac cells early response to stressful stimuli potentially compromising their survival.",

Charonis Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, GREECE Introduction: Type 2 diabetes is associated with pancreatic b-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Hyperglycemia is a major contributor of b-cell dysfunction, a phenomenon known as 'glucose toxicity'. Methods and results: We examined differential regulation of the b-cell proteome in cultured murine TC-6 pancreatic beta cells, under low versus high glucose conditions, mimicking 'glucose toxicity'. Two-D gel electrophoresis, image analysis software and MALDI-TOF-TOF Mass Spectrometry analysis led to identification of 45 differentially expressed spots, corresponding to 20 proteins. Among these, ERp46, a novel endoplasmic reticulum resident protein related to protein disulfide isomerase, was further studied. This protein is highly expressed in cells producing proteins exhibiting disulfide bonds as is the case with insulin in pancreatic beta cells. Immunoblotting analysis revealed a decrease in the expression of ERp46 under high compared to low glucose conditions. Since cell lines do not perfectly mimic the primary bcell physiology, pancreatic islets were isolated for further studies. Immunoperoxidase staining in pancreatic sections revealed high expression of ERp46 in islets compared to exocrine tissue. This observation was further confirmed by immunoblotting analysis. Furthermore, isolated murine islets cultured under conditions of high glucose demonstrated a down-regulation in ERp46 expression, compared to low glucose. Most importantly, inhibition of ERp46 expression by siRNA in cultured beta cells led to a significant decrease of insulin content monitored by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Conclusion: These data suggest that ERp46 may be a crucial component of the 'glucose toxicity' phenomenon, playing an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Besides their anticoagulant activities, they have been reported to possess cholesterol lowering and radical scavenging properties. In this study, lipid lowering activity of 7,8-dihydroxy-3-(3-methylphenyl) coumarin (DHMC) which was synthesized by our department was shown in hyperlipidemia induced female Sprague Dawley rats. We investigated the protein changes in liver tissues with proteomics technology-two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). We isolated protein samples from the hyperlipidemia induced (n = 5) and control (n = 5) rat livers. 2-DE was carried out with an immobilized pH gradient strip in the first dimension and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second dimension. The 2D PAGE revealed that the liver protein profile was intensified in the range of pI: 5,5-9, Over 1000 polypeptide spots were resolved by the PDQuest scanning and projection program. We observed that the protein profile of the hyperlipidemia induced group was changed, intensity of some of the spots decreased and some of them increased.

            "text": "The tPA/plasminogen system in TSEs: friend or foe? Introduction: Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) are invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases, for which no effective treatment is yet available. The prion is the common pathogen of all TSEs and its major component is the abnormal isoform (PrP Sc ) of the cellular prion protein (PrP C ). Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), is a serine protease involved in the dissolution of blood clots, through the activation of plasminogen to active plasmin. tPA also plays a role in the CNS and is involved in neurodegeneration and neuronal plasticity. Numerous reports have linked the tPA/plasminogen system to TSEs and PrP. We have previously shown: that tPA expression and activity are enhanced in TSE-affected animals, that PrP C but not PrP Sc can be cleaved by plasmin, and that tPA -/and plasminogen -/mice display shorter survival intervals than wild type (wt) mice upon challenge with the infectious material (Xanthopoulos, et al. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 2: 519-527). To gain a better understanding of the relationship between the tPA/plasminogen system and TSEs, we have challenged transgenic mice overexpressing tPA in their neurons. Methods: Transgenic mice, which overexpress tPA in their neurons were generated and characterized for tPA gene expression level and enzymatic activity, as well as PrP C expression. These mice have been challenged with the infectious agent. Results/conclusions: tPA activity in the brains of transgenic mice was found 20% higher than in wt mice, whereas PrP expression was normal. The mice were successfully challenged with the infectious material. Results from this bioassay will shed light on the relationship between TSEs and the tPA/plasminogen system. Methods: For this purpose, cUNG, hUNG, and UNG inhibitor (UGI) were expressed and purified in large scale nearly to homogeneity by different chromatographic techniques using AKTA purification system. Then the enzymes were characterized biophysically using two different calorimetric analysis methods: Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), in order to determine overall stability/flexibility, and to determine protein-protein or protein-DNA interaction energetics, respectively. Results: DSC analysis showed cUNG has almost 9\u00b0C lower in melting temperature than hUNG indicating less stability of cUNG than its mesophilic counterpart. The finding supports cold adaptive characteristics of cUNG suggested by previous studies. ITC experiments also revealed lower K d and higher enthalphic contribution for free energy of binding of cUNG with UGI than that of hUNG, in support of cold adaptive behaviour of cUNG. Conclusion: cUNG has higher activity than hUNG at the cost of low thermal stability as indicated for many cold adaptive enzymes. Introduction: Muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR), formed by five homologous subunits (a 2 bcd or a 2 bed), is the major autoantigen in the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis (MG), in which pathogenic autoantibodies bind to, and cause loss of functional AChRs in the neuromuscular junction. Our aim is to construct the heteropentamers a 2 bcd and a 2 bed of the human AChRs, consisting only of the extracellular domains (ECDs). Such molecules should retain the complete antigenic structure of the AChR and thus should allow us to optimize a novel therapeutic approach we are currently developing, which involves the specific depletion of the pathogenic autoantibodies from MG sera. Methods: The ECDs used were mutants which contained the hydrophilic Cys-loop from the homologue acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP), which was previously observed to improve the expression yield and solubility of the ECDs. In order to achieve the construction of the pentameric ECDs, we linked the ECDs in pairs (a-c, a-e, a-d, bd or vice versa) using a 24-residue flexible linker [(AGS)8] and expressed them in Pichia pastoris.",

Research Group on Brain Aging (EA 3808) University of Poitiers, Poitiers, FRANCE, 2 Department of Geriatrics, Poitiers University Hospital, Poitiers, FRANCE, 3 Department of Neurology, Poitiers University Hospital, Poitiers, FRANCE Introduction: Two major pathways, PKR (double-stranded RNAactivated Protein Kinase) and mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin) could be involved in the neuronal death observed in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) marked by memory disturbances and cognitive dysfunctions. Effectively, there is an activation of PKR and a sustained reduction of phosphorylated mTOR in different cellular, animal models of AD and in brain and lymphocytes of AD patients. However, the molecular link between PKR and mTOR going by way p53, Redd1 and TSC2 remains unknown in AD. Methods: Human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) and rat primary neuronal cultures (E17) were incubated with 20 lM amyloid-beta peptide . Clinical study was also conducted in lymphocytes of AD patients. By using PKR siRNA and a specific PKR inhibitor, these three factors were analyzed by western blotting, immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. Results: The upregulation of PKR and the downregulation of mTOR were associated with an increase of phosphorylation of p53, a transcriptional activation of Redd1 gene and a decrease of phosphorylated TSC2 expression in cellular models. PKR siRNA and specific PKR inhibitor decreased the transcriptional activation of Redd1. Clinical study showed also an increase of p53 and Redd1 expression in lymphocytes of AD patients with significant correlation with activated PKR. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that Redd1 could represent molecular link between PKR and mTOR pathways and a possible target for new therapeutic strategies in AD. In recent years, great interest has been generated related to characterization of protein folding and unfolding, as well as in developing small molecule inhibitors of protein aggregation. In the present work, thermal aggregation of alpha-amylase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BAA) was studied at 65\u00b0C in phosphate buffer pH 6.9 .Various techniques including turbidity measurements, intrinsic fluorescence, farand near-UV, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and light scattering were employed to characterize the aggregation process. Acidic and basic pH conditions were investigated in order to study the effect of protein net charge. While aggregation was significantly reduced at pH 2, it was observed at greater extents upon increasing pH toward pI of the protein (6.2). Light scattering results showed that the two phases of nucleation and elongation in the process remain similar in these pH values. No aggregation could be observed in the pH range of 8-12, apparently due to repulsive electrostatic interactions. Proline, lysine, tryptophan, and tyrosine (5-30 mM) significantly reduced aggregation, with proline being the most effective. Addition of aspartic acid and glutamic acid enhanced aggregation, again supporting involvement of electrostatic interactions in the aggregation process.",

DHS, DOHH and hypusinated eIF5A have become targets for anti-cancer therapies, particularly as eIF5A is thought to play a role in the translation of specific mRNAs encoding proteins involved in the onset of the G1-S phase in the cell cycle. Structural data of eIF5A and archaeal homologues has been derived from crystals produced from heterologously-expressed unhypusinated eIF5A. Methods: Affinity chromatography was used to purify heterologouslyproduced eIF5A (EceIF5A). The oligomeric state of EceIF5A was determined using gel filtration, native PAGE and cross-linking experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis of specific residues in EceIF5A was used to identify residues involved in maintaining the oligomeric state. The biological activity of these mutants was determined in a yeast complementation system. Results: EceIF5A exists as a dimer in solution. The formation of this dimer is dependent on the highly conserved Cys39 residue, but not Lys51, which is required for dimerisation of the native protein in yeast. These and other results indicate that eIF-5A produced in E. coli is misfolded with important implications for the interpretation of current structural data. Conclusions: Evidence of misfolding in heterologously produced eIF5A implies limited information from crystal structures derived from this protein. There is a need for structural data on hypusinated eIF5A to understand its function in vivo.",

Ignatova Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, GERMANY Introduction: The molecular basis of slowly progressing hereditary neurodegenerative disease dentatorubralpallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is associated with a mutation that abnormally increases inframe the number of glutamine residues in the atrophin-1 over a threshold value of 30-40 repeats. Methods: Using fluorescence imaging of cells and FRAP live imaging we study the dynamic localization and mobility of the aggregates in HEK293 and differentiated and undifferentiated N2a cell line. The behaviour of the full length atrophin-1 with polyQ-stretch in the nonpathological (Q = 14) and pathological (Q = 71) length (FL14, FL71) and with truncated NLS sequence (NLS14, NLS71) fused downstream the GFP protein was examined. To quantitatively assess the partitioning of the aggregate species between the detergent-labile and detergentresistant fraction we perform fractionation assays followed by an immunodetection. Results and conclusions: nNLS71 forms readily hyperfluorescent loci, even at the early time points of expression with a clearly defined SDS-resistance pointing out to an early appearance of the fibrillar phenotype. However, these early species are less densily packed with a higher degree of mobility within the aggregate loci. The FL71 expressing cells show a mixed population of cytoplasmic and nuclearly localized aggregates, whereas prolonged expression results in mainly cytoplasmic localization and fusion to one large aggregate. For the non-pathological variants nNLS14 and FL14 we observed in addition to cells with homogenous GFP fluorescence in substantial fraction of cells (and intriguingly in all differentiated cells) hyperfluorescent foci. The latter showed a fast recovery of the fluorescence and lack of insoluble fraction after fractionation suggesting spatial localization within the cytoplasm. Introduction: Carbonic anhydrases (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) are a family of metalloenzymes catalyzing the hydration of CO 2 to bicarbonate and a proton. a-Cas are involved in essential cellular functions such as pH regulation, respiration, gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, ureagenesis, tumor progression. So far, 15 catalytically active carbonic anhydrase isozymes are described in mammals. hCA XII is one of the transmembrane human carbonic anhydrase isoforms. hCA XII is present in many normal tissues and overexpressed in some tumors. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate CA XII expression in HT 29 colon carcinoma cell line upon cytokine (TNF-a, TGF-b). Methods: The expression of CA XII in colon cells was detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. Results: There was no significant difference in the expression level of CA XII between cytokine treated and non-treated colon carcinoma cells. While TNF-a treatment increased proliferation TGF-b had a significant anti-proliferative effect in cells.",

Dynamics of membrane proteins play a prime role in most functional characteristics of cells. Aim: The aim of work was to determine the several aspects of patients blood plasma albumin alterations related to the biophysical modifications of cell membrane. Methods: For the study 54 Latvian residents, who participated in accident cleaning-up works during 1987-1988 were selected during April 2006-June 2007. We registered the spectral characteristics of probes ABM (derivative of aminobenzanthrone) and ANS in lymphocytes suspension and blood plasma, determine the membrane anisotropy and plasma albumin auto-fluorescence. Results: Screening of ABM labeled blood plasma samples revealed that in 83% of patients (Group 1) the fluorescence zone is shifted (compared to the spectrum for healthy donors) by 20-50 nm to the short wave region (maximum 630-600 nm). The 17% of patients (Group 2) had a fluorescence maximum at 650 nm corresponding to the fluorescence observed in healthy donors. Patterns of spectra are associated with membrane anisotropy and conformational changes of blood plasma albumin which is more pronounced in Group 1. Results in Group 1 are like to N-F transition of albumin. The shift is accompanied by increasing ABM fluorescence intensity two times. It may be explained by an increase of albumin binding sites capacity. Human plasma albumin has 2-3 binding sites for ANS, different in affinity for this probe. The fluorescence from these binding sites has a different quantum yield and relatively large degree of polarization (i.e., higher mobility of bounded ANS, higher accessibility of water to these binding sites). Obtained hydration of tryptophanyl region in albumin molecule is interpreted as indole group transition into the buried region, inaccessible to water (closing of a structural slit). There is a strong correlation between all investigated parameters. Conclusion: Results shown that the cell membranes, first of all for their proteins, are significant targets of ionizing radiation. It may be concluded that membrane fluorescence characteristics (e.g., anisotropy changes) are representative for radiation induced membrane alterations and albumin carrier function changes.",

Methods: Isolated pig hearts were perfused under normoxic and anoxic conditions. The activities of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in preparations of total ARS were measured by an initial rate of tRNA aminoacylation. Results: The activities of alanyl-, seryl-glutamyl-and leucyl-tRNA synthetases after 20 minutes anoxia had increased by 67-77% compared to the control. The tincture of Polyscias filicifolia Bailey biomass did not affect the activities of these aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in norm. However, after 20 minutes anoxic perfusion with buffer containing Polyscias filicifolia Bailey, activities of alanyl-, seryl-glutamyl-and leucyl-tRNA-synthetases reached control values. The activity of inorganic pyrophosphatase, which is found in total ARS preparations, after 20 minutes anoxia increased by 87% compared to the control. However, after 20 minutes anoxic perfusion with buffer containing Polyscias filicifolia Bailey, the activity of inorganic pyrophosphatase reached control values. Conclusions: Alteration in the activity of inorganic pyrophosphatase is one of the reasons causing changes in functional activity of ARS under anoxia. One of the possible mechanisms of Polyscias filicifolia Bailey biomass tincture protective action on the activities of ARS may be the effect on inorganic pyrophosphatase which is important in regulation of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases activities.",

A lot of proteins, even not involved in diseases, is known to be able to form amiloid-like structures similar in final fibrils architecture. This fact suggests, that formation of cross-b structure is a common property of a polypeptide chain under appropriate conditions. Apomyoglobin is a convenient model for amyloid formation study due to the folding of this protein is well known. Based on prediction of our laboratory theoretical group, we chose two residues (V10 and L115) and replaced them with alanine and phenylalanine. For identification of amyloids we used CD spectroscopy and electron microscopy. Kinetics of amyloid formation was monitored by ThT binding and turbidity, rate constants were calculated. We found, that rates of amyloid formation by mutant proteins with different substitutions at the same position are approximately equal, but they vary from for apomyoglobins with substitutions at 10th and 115th positions. Our data suggest that the rate of apomyoglobin amyloid formation is affected by the position of a substitution, but not hydrophobicity of amino acids at the same position. ",

On the first step the ability of prions to bind chaperonin GroEL was proved using chaperonin immobilized on sepharose and differential scanning calorimetry method. It was shown that prions compete with other denatured proteins in binding to chaperonin GroEL. This was also confirmed by decrease of efficiency of the GAPDH chaperon-assisted folding in the presence of prions. On the second step the chaperonin GroEL effect on thermoaggregation and the aggregate size of VRQ and ARR was studied. Thermoaggregation of prions was observed by monitoring the turbidity of prion solution at 320 nm. The size of aggregates was estimated by the dynamic light scattering analysis. Obtained results demonstrate that chaperonin GroEL (without or in presence of Mg-ATP and cochaperonin GroES) increase the level of prions thermoaggregation. Chaperonin GroEL provoke further association of partially aggregated prions, having strong influence on the aggregates size.

The aim of this study was to produce functional recombinant hepcidin and to develop a specific immunoassay for its quantification in human sera. Methods: Hepcidin-His was expressed in P. pastoris and further purified by Ni 2 -NTA affinity and size exclusion chromatography. The function of the recombinant peptide was tested by antimicrobial and labile iron pool (LIP) assay. Its ability to bind and downregulate its receptor ferroportin was tested by Western blot, cross-linking pull-down assay and confocal microscopy.

            "text": "Investigation of the correlation between FKBP12 and APP processing/AD pathogenesis One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of insoluble extracellular amyloid plaques, whose major constituent, the Ab peptide, is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two sequential proteolytic cleavages, which also generate the APP intracellular domain (AICD). We have previously demonstrated that AICD interacts with FKBP12, a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) ubiquitous in nerve systems. This interaction was interfered, in a dose-dependent manner, by FK506, whose neuroprotective effect has been suggested to be correlated with its FKBP12 PPIase inhibitory activity and may be separated from its immunosuppressive effect mediated via calcineurin inhibition. The exact mechanism(s) of FK506's neuroprotective activity, however, still remains unclear. FKBP12 has been shown to be expressed at a higher level in areas of pathology in the brains of neurodegenerative disease patients, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of those diseases. Our preliminary results revealed that FKBP12 overexpression increased the levels of CTFb but not CTFa, and therefore resulted in a higher CTFb/CTFa ratio. The increase in the b-secretase cleavage products was reverted by adding FK506. These results support our hypothesis that FKBP12 may participate in the regulation of APP processing in a fashion similar to Pin1, and FK506 may partially induce a neurotrophic activity either by hindering the interaction between FKBP12 and AICD, or by inhibiting the PPIase activity of FKBP12 directly.",

Amyloid related disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, involve the aggregation of normally soluble proteins into insoluble amyloid fibrils (amyloidogenesis) and proceeds through intermediates with debatable mechanism and some common morphological features. Alcohols have been shown to induce the fibril formation in prion and Alzheimer's disease peptides in vitro. The amyloid formation of non-disease-related proteins via partial denaturation with alcohols has been little studied. In the present study, amyloid formation of structural Zn 2+ -depleted yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (apoI-YADH) was studied in an aqueous solution of four alcohols (methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol and tert-butanol). The apo-protein was obtained by removing the structural zinc with the catalytic zinc remaining on the enzyme. The amyloid formation of the enzyme was monitored by using Congo red test and thioflavin T (Th T) fluorescence assay, which are widely used for specific detection of amyloid fibrils. Fibrilogenesis occurs following a conformational transition to a b-sheet rich structure as evidenced by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) confirms the presence of regular amyloid-like fibrils with long, unbranched and often twisted structures of few nanometers in diameter. The amyloid-inducing ability of alcohols increased with increasing carbon number (hydrophobicity) and obeyed a concentration dependent manner in the order of: 20% < 40% < 60% < 70% < 80%. Therefore, the relative strength of the water-alcohol interaction is considered to reflect the amyloid formation in the aqueous alcohol through destabilization of apoI-YADH. The similarity in properties of amyloid in different amyloidoses suggests that principles learnt in this study would be of fundamental relevance for the design of effective therapeutic agent's against amyloid related disorders.",

Hyperhomocysteinemia exerts its adverse effects, in part through Hcy metabolite, homocysteine thiolactone (HcyTL). HcyTL is a highly reactive compound which has the ability to modify proteins, decreasing their physiologic activities and having toxic effects on cells. Recently it was shown that paraoxonase 1 (PON), an enzyme with antioxidant and antiatherogenic properties, also has homocysteine thiolactonase (HTLase) activity, HcyTL being its physiologic substrate.

Results: We investigated the interaction of soluble and aggregated forms of beta-amyloidy1-42 (Ab), with different forms of GAPDH to clarify whether the certain forms of GAPDH are directly involved in the formation of amyloid structures or they adsorbed to the existing amyloid aggregates. Besides, we studied the effect of Ab on the aggregation of GAPDH and on the spontaneous and chaperonin-assisted renaturation of the enzyme. We revealed no interaction between Ab and the native form of GAPDH. Ab prevented the spontaneous reactivation of GAPDH as a result of its interaction with the enzyme.

Although abnormal activation of calpains has been implicated in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington fs and Alzheimer fs diseases, cataract, muscle dystrophy, brain or cardiac ischemia, recent studies suggest that this system may play important roles in cell death, cell differentiation and memory formation under physiological conditions. To clarify the roles of calpain, we reduced calpain activity by genetic manipulation or inhibitors treatment. Reduction of calpain activity resulted in apoptotic cell death. We detected caspase-like activity in this cell death.

The alpha-synuclein protein (a-syn) causes PD if it is overexpressed or contains certain point mutations. The a-syn monomer is intrinsically unstructured, but can adopt either a beta-sheet conformation (fibrillar a-syn is found in PD brain inclusions) or an alpha-helical conformation, which mediates vesicle trafficking. It is composed of three regions: (i) the N-terminus adopts an alpha-helical structure upon membrane binding; (ii) the middle hydrophobic region (NAC) promotes fibrillization; (iii) the C-terminus is a negatively charged random coil. To study how each of these three regions affect a-syn localization and toxicity, constructs with extended or truncated N-termini, NAC regions, and Ctermini respectively were made and their effects on yeast cells were studied. Overexpressed a-syn strongly inhibits yeast growth; it localizes at the plasma membrane and forms cytoplasmic inclusions. An a-syn variant with an extended N-terminus was found to be more toxic to yeast than a variant with a truncated N-terminus. The former is prone to form a-helical structure, whereas the latter is prone to form beta-sheet fibrils in vitro. Increased alpha-helical structure propensity, which is associated with tighter membrane binding, therefore, promotes a-syn toxicity. In line with this result, cytoplasmic variants are generally less toxic than membrane bound variants. Constructs with altered NAC regions display intermediate toxicities, whereas a-syn variants with elongated or truncated C-termini are highly toxic to yeast. When expressed individually, each protein region exhibits low toxicity, suggesting that long range or multiple interactions are involved in a-syn toxicity.

However, the low immunogenicity of this molecule in wild type (wt) animals has hampered the attempts for active immunogenization. In this study we evaluate the immunogenicity of various forms of murine recombinant prion protein (mrPrP) in wt mice and their possible protective role in an animal model of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Methods: Murine prion protein (PrP) was cloned and expressed, either alone, or fused to the bacterial heat shock protein DnaK. The recombinant proteins were administered to groups of C57Bl/6J mice, along with the corresponding controls. The immunization scheme consisted of priming and two boosts, after which the mice were challenged intraperitoneally with the RML scrapie strain and observed for the appearance of clinical symptoms. When the mice reached terminal stage they were sacrificed and their tissues prepared for immunohistochemistry and Western Blotting (WB). Splenic lymphocytes were harvested and lymphocyte proliferation assays, as well as cytokine expression profile in the presence of mrPrP, were performed. Results/conclusions: ELISA and WB analysis indicate that the elicitation of humoral immune response against mrPrP, even in wt animals, occurred with one of the antigens, but this regime did not protect the mice against TSEs. Immunization with a different form of mrPrP lead to a statistically significant prolongation of the survival interval for the immunized versus the control mice by 27 days, although no antibodies against mrPrP were detected. In this latter case, the protection was probably mediated through cellular immunity. Introduction: A key event in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) is the conversion of the soluble, protease-sensitive glycosylated prion protein (PrP C ) to an abnormally structured, aggregated and partially protease-resistant isoform (PrP Sc ). Both PrP isoforms bear two potential glycosylation sites, and thus in a typical western blot with an anti-PrP antibody three distinct bands appear, corresponding to the di-, mono-or unglycosylated forms of the protein. The relative intensity and electrophoretic mobility of the three bands are characteristic of each TSE and have been used to discriminate between these.",

Results/conclusions: Our findings indicate that despite similar sugar moieities are found on PrP Sc purified from different TSEs, the relative abundance of sugars varies, depending on TSE type. These results reinforce the idea that PrP glycosylation may be important for the transmission of TSEs between different species, as well as for the appearance of some of the characteristic traits of TSE strains. Furthermore, they suggest that lectin based western blotting could be useful as an additional assay for the discrimination between the various TSEs. Introduction: The BRCA1 protein contains a tandem of two BRCT domains at its C-terminal region. Several proteins interact with this region and collaborate with BRCA1 in important functional pathways, such as DNA repair and transcriptional regulation.

Morphological, structural and biochemical data have been gathered on amyloid-fibril formation by human stefin B (cystatin B) and some of its mutants. Here, based on more kinetic measurements, we propose an improved model for the reaction. The observed kinetics follow the nucleation and growth behaviour. The minimal kinetic scheme that best fits measurements of changes in CD and thioflavin T fluorescence as a function of protein concentration and temperature includes nucleation (modeled as N I irreversible transitions with equivalent rates (k I ), which fitted with N I = 64), fibril growth and non-productive oligomerization, best explained by an off-pathway state with a rate-limiting escape rate. Three energies of activation were derived from global fitting to the model, and independently through the fitting of the individual component rates. Nucleation was found to be a first-order process within an oligomeric species with an enthalpy of activation of 55 \u00b1 4 kcal/mol. Fibril growth was a second-order process with an enthalpy of activation (27 \u00b1 5 kcal/mol) half that of nucleation, and which is indistinguishable from that of tetramer formation by cystatins, which involves limited conformational changes including proline trans to cis isomerization. The escape rate of the off-pathway oligomeric state has a high enthalpy of activation (96 \u00b1 5 kcal/mol) characteristic of a substantial degree of unfolding. The observed transitions are consistent with the current model of stefin B fibrils where the helix is displaced and proline 74 is in a cis conformation. Mammalian peroxisomal membrane protein, Pxmp2, with monomeric molecular mass 22 kDa (also known as PMP22 protein) belongs to a family of integral membrane proteins with unknown function. Here we show that disruption of Pxmp2 encoding Pxmp2 leads to partial restriction in peroxisomal membrane permeability to solutes in vitro and accumulation of peroxisomal metabolites (e.g. uric acid) in body fluids (blood and urine) of mice. Multiple channel analysis of peroxisomal preparations isolated from liver of wild-type mice reveals presence of two pore-forming components with conductance in 1 M KCl of 1.3 and 2.5 nS, respectively. One of these components (with conductance of 1.3 nS in 1 M KCl) was lost in Pxmp2-/-mice indicating that Pxmp2 may be a pore-forming channel. This was confirmed by expression of a functional recombinant Pxmp2 in insect cells and using native Pxmp2 purified from mouse liver. The Pxmp2 channel, with an estimated diameter of 1.4 nm shows weak cation selectivity and no voltage dependence. Hence, Pxmp2 is the first peroxisomal channel identified, and its existence suggests that the mammalian peroxisomal membrane is permeable to small solutes while transfer of 'bulky' metabolites, e.g., cofactors (NAD/H, NADP/H, and CoA) and ATP, requires specific transporters.",

Imatinib (Gleevec) is inhibiting Bcr-Abl, but relapse due to acquired drug resistance remains problematic. Although Bcr-Abl is an extensively studied protein, the key protein interactors and critical pathways necessary and sufficient for oncogenicity have not been identified. As a starting point we purified endogenous Bcr-Abl complexes, analyzed their composition by LC-MS/MS and identified a set of seven stoichiometric core interactors. We created recombinant epitope standards and antibodies for the seven Bcr-Abl core interactors and were able to determine the proportion of Bcr-Abl-associated versus 'free' protein and interaction stoichiometry within the complex, as well as the absolute protein copy numbers per cell. The seven core complex constituents interact with Bcr-Abl in a 0.5:1-4:1 stoichiometry. In addition, we have generated a comprehensive dataset based on tandem affinity purification using the seven core interactors as bait following LS-MS/MS analysis and generation of network models. Furthermore, reciprocal interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitations. We are currently investigating effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on the composition and integrity of this Bcr-Abl core complex as well as the functional consequences on its signaling network. This should enable us to identify the key Bcr-Abl interactors and signaling pathways and to provide a rationale for combinatorial pharmacological intervention in CML.",

Single stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs) are ubiquitous and fundamental for a wide variety of DNA metabolic processes including DNA replication, recombination, transcription, repair and in the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. SSB proteins from the three domains of life are evolutionarily conserved and utilise oligonucleotidebinding (OB) domains for DNA binding. In eukaryotes, the major SSB, Replication Protein A (RPA), is a heterotrimer. We describe a second human SSB (hSSB1), with a domain organisation closer to the archaeal SSB than to eukaryotic RPA. We show the first biochemical characterisation of hSSB1 and demonstrate that it is phosphorylated by ATM kinase in response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) [1] . This phosphorylation event is required for DNA damage-induced stabilisation of hSSB1. Upon induction of DNA damage, hSSB1 accumulates in the nucleus, forming distinct foci that co-localise with known repair proteins. We show that depletion of hSSB1 abrogates the cellular response to DSBs. Cells deficient in hSSB1 exhibit enhanced genomic instability coupled with a diminished capacity for DNA repair. We propose the novel hSSBs are functional homologues of the bacterial and archaeal SSB family of proteins, placing them centrally in the DNA repair pathway. Like many early participants in the damage response pathway, hSSB1 may be involved in tumorigenesis and may affect the response of patients and tumours toward cancer therapies. is an ADP-ribosylating putative toxin identified in the virulent strain MC58 of N. meningitidis serogroup B by computational approach.",

We have noticed that addition of Fe 3+ in the mixtures of enzymatic assays enhanced 3-fold the incorporation of radioactive ADP-ribose, while the presence of o-phenanthroline, a specific iron chelator, drastically reduced the enzymatic activity. These results together with the presence of four Cys spaced as residues of iron-sulfur-cluster motif, prompted us to confirm the presence of this structure using the EPR technique, a method that evidences the presence of paramagnetic ions and identifies the type of coordination in which they are involved. EPR experiments carried out combining rNarE with FeCl 3 evidenced the presence of an iron center sourrended by four Cys residues. Further, EPR signal obtained at g = 4.3 indicates the presence of a single Fe 3+ atom in a distorted sulfur ligands field. In order to confirm the presence of the Fe-S cluster Cys mutated forms of rNarE have already obtained and used for enzymatic assays.

Functional flagella would enhance colonization and adhesion to gastric mucosal cells which are essential in infection.

The data obtained in our study provided evidence that so-called macrodomain (170 aa) of nsP3 protein is used for precise positioning of a substrate recognition sequence at the catalytic center of the protease and this process is coordinated by exact amino-terminal end of the N-terminal domain of nsP2 protein, thus representing the unique regulation mechanism used by alphaviruses. Although maturation of alphaviral replicase was always considered to be an attractive model for studies of fine mechanisms of proteolytic processing, it can now be concluded that even in such a seemingly simple system the efficiencies and the character of the cleavages performed by the same protease are obviously different and all three sequentially organized processing events are regulated by use of different mechanisms, only some of which are common for both SFV and SIN. Experimental data also disclosed the involvement of viral RNA in the regulation of the processing of 2/3 site suggesting the multimeric nature of the alphaviral replication complex residing on a viral RNA in a specifically ordered manner.

We have used siRNA depletion, quantitative immunoprecipitation and live fluorescent microscopy of HeLa cells that stably express CFP and YFP-tagged COG subunits to uncover intracellular dynamic of the COG complex. siRNA-induced knock-down of Lobe A subunits Cog3p and Cog4p induced rapid accumulation of COG complex dependent (CCD) intra-Golgi vesicles and consequent Golgi ribbon breakdown, while the knock-down of Lobe B subunits Cog6p, Cog7p and Cog8p did not cause significant vesicle accumulation.

There are similarities between b-casein and other known chaperones in their tendency into micelle-like aggregate. This was a starting point to evaluate whether b-casein play any chaperone-like activity. Prevention of thermal aggregation of substrate proteins by molecular chaperones is a commonly method for in vitro assay of their activity.

After affinity purification of the different ORC subcomplexes we have found that ORC assembly is altered by the mutations. Introduction: Regulation of synaptic vesicle protein levels is critical for neuronal function. The Adaptor Protein complex-3 (AP-3) and BLOC-1 sorting machinery regulate synaptic vesicle protein targeting from endosomes. The ubiquitous AP-3 isoform and BLOC-1 complex mediate lysosomal delivery of membrane proteins, while the neuronal AP-3 isoform forms a subset of synaptic vesicles [1] . Recent proteomes of AP-3-derived synaptic-like microvesicles [2] or synaptic vesicles [3] revealed the presence of lysosomal membrane proteins and lysosomal targeting machinery in these organelles. These results suggest that the two AP-3s may recognize and competitively sort similar cargo proteins to either a synaptic vesicle or lysosomal fate. Introduction: Histone deacetylase (HDAC) function has been found to be impaired in certain cancer cells. This may explain the differential sensitivity of cancer cells to HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs). It is therefore important to know the response of different cell types to HDACIs being used as antineoplastic drugs. In this presentation, the time-dependent kinetics of the HDACI, trichostatin A (TSA), in the induction of apoptosis and core histone H4 acetylation are compared between two leukemic cell lines, K562 and Molt-4. Methods: Molt-4 (lymphoblastic) and K562 cells (erythroleukemic) were incubated with TSA (500 ng/ml) for 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 hours. Histones were separated in an acetic/urea/Triton-X100 gel system and histone H4 acetylation levels were quantified. Apoptosis was monitored by PARP and DFF45 cleavage as well as by Annex-inV/PI staining and subG1 DNA content. Hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that catalyze reversible reduction and oxidation of molecular hydrogen and are present mostly in prokaryotes. Our previous results demonstrate an autocatalytic mechanism during the reaction cycle of HynSL hydrogenase from purple photosynthetic bacteria, Thiocapsa roseopersicina although the nature of the autocatalyst is still a question. By analyzing spatial patterns of hydrogenase reaction in a thin layer reaction chamber we observed the dependence of reaction propagation speed (front velocity) on both enzyme and substrate concentrations. Front velocity increased on increasing the enzyme concentration and decreased on increasing the substrate concentration. The experiments give further evidence for the autocatalytic nature of hydrogenase reaction and also suggest the role of the enzyme as autocatalyst. As HynSL has different conformers, the autocatalytic reaction could be an interaction of inactive and active enzyme forms (prion type autocatalysis). On the basis of the experimental results we set up a model that explains the experimental findings. The experiments were performed with purified enzyme. It is still a question if the hydrogenase functions autocatalytically in vivo. Considering that the expression of hydrogenase enzyme is a very difficult process requiring lots of accessory proteins and that the enzyme in its active form is extremely sensitive towards oxygen, it seems to be reasonable to save enzyme molecules in inactive forms in the cell and activate them only at appropriate time and under proper conditions. Further experiments have to be performed in order to demonstrate this assumption.",

Results-Conclusions: A collective list of 350 known proteins was generated by mass spectrometry analysis. Most interestingly, among the SoTRIs-extracted proteins are proteins resistant to solubilisation with other mild extraction procedures (such as nuclear matrix, hydrophobic, trafficking proteins, etc). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed an unbiased distribution of SoTRIs-proteins between cell compartments, with the exception of depletion in the soluble fraction. Furthermore, SoTRIs-extract is enriched in proteins that are physically associated with four major macromolecular structures: (i) chromatin, (ii) cytoskeleton, (iii) ribonucleoprotein and (iv) cell and subcellular membranes. To examine functional association, we performed affinity chromatography where SoTRIs-extracts were incubated with conjugated-on-beads peptides that are known to participate in theses macromolecular structures, and assemble functional clusters of proteins. Immunoblotting revealed that different clusters of proteins are assembled with, during different biological processes. This evidence shows that the SoTRIs extraction procedure is enriched in the functional fraction of proteins that participate to macromolecular complexes.

The structure of two complexes of P II protein, with the ammonium channel AmtB and with the enzyme acetylglutamate kinase, have been described. We now report the structure of the complex with the cyanobacterial transcriptional regulator PipX. P II and PipX from Synechococcus elongatus strain PCC 7942 were mixed and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Crystals grew after several months in hanging drops. X-ray diffraction yielded maps at 3.2 \u00c5 . Phasing was accomplished by molecular replacement using P II as template. The PipX model was built after density averaging, applying non-crystallographic symmetry and solvent flattening. The complex consists of one P II trimer of 112-residue subunits associated to three PipX 89-residue subunits. Each PipX subunit has a 6-stand antiparallel beta sandwich formed by four-strand and 2-strand (beta hairpin) layers, and a C-terminal two-helix hairpin. The beta hairpins of the three subunits form a continuous layer that provides a flat surface for interaction with the flat surface of P II. A PipX trimer having a trefoil shape sits on the PII trimer. Each PipX subunit contacts two P II subunits, with one T-loop of P II embedded between two PipX subunits. The C-terminal helix is mobile and both helixes are mainly polar and exposed. The structure explains the regulation of PipX-PII complex formation, and allows hypotheses to be made on ways of PipX action.

The b-subunit was significantly more abundant with increasing temperature. The recombinant b subunit oligomer exhibits higher thermostability and affinity to the co-chaperone, prefoldin, than that of a subunit. However, the hetero-oligomer was not studied yet because of difficulty in building hetero-oligomers with fixed order and composition. In this study, we built the hetero-oligomers of T. KS-1 chaperonin with various composition and order by linking two or four a and b subunits. The hetero-oligomer containing a and b subunits alternately could capture an acid denatured GFP and enhance refolding of it in ATP dependent manner. However, the efficiency was almost same as the b homo-oligomer irrespective of the presence of four a subunits in a ring. The arresting activity and conformational change ability of the hetero-oligomer was similar to those of the homo-oligomers. Interestingly, affinity of the hetero-oligomer with prefoldin is almost between a and b homo-oligomer. Existence of four b subunits in the ring increases the affinity with prefoldin. Although the thermostability of the hetero-oligomer similar to that of a homo-oligomer, existence of b subunit in the hetero-oligomer likely to be needed to increase affinity interaction prefoldin. Because the prefoldin consists of six tentacles and T. KS-1 chaperonin has eight monomers per ring, we think that interaction between prefoldin and group II chaperonin is asymmetric. ",

Membrane stored curvature elastic stress has been suggested as a hypothesis of regulation of CCT activity [2] . This investigation was undertaken to study in vivo the effect of two Type I amphiphiles, hexadecyl phosphatidylcholine (HDPC) and hexadecyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) to phospholipid metabolism in a transfected GFP-HeLa cell line. Methods: HeLa cells were synchronised at the G1/S barrier by Lmimosine, and then harvested every three hours for the first 21 hours post synchronisation. A Blight Dyer total membrane lipid extraction was performed. The lipid composition of membranes was quantified by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry using non-physiological lipids as internal standards. Cells were also sized using optical microscopy image analysis at 21 hours post synchronisation. Results: HDPC was considerably more potent in inhibiting new phosphocholine (PC) synthesis than CTAB.

One of its proteolytic cleavage peptides by plasmin called catestatin inhibits secretagogue-stimulated catecholamine release. In this report, we investigated a role of CgA in the plasminogen/plasmin activation process via the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in neuroendocrine processing of prohormones like CgA itself.

Results: At a concentration of 45 lM, DESAFIB \u00d2 -X could reduce Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) of the plasminogen/plasmin activation via tPA at the neutral pH from 208 lM (control without an enhancer) to 0.323 lM. The catalytic efficiency (K cat /K m ) of the reaction increased from 0.011/lM/s (control) to 7.166/lM/s. The K m values of the activation process via tPA reduced from 208 lM to 0.307 lM when the rec hCgA was used at 40 nM concentration, while the catalytic efficiency (K cat /K m ) increased from 0.011/lM/s to 7.540/lM/s. Conclusions: These data suggest that the rec hCgA demonstrated a far better enhancer property for plasminogen/plasmin activation process via tPA than the control (DESAFIB \u00d2 -X) at the neutral pH by approximately 3 orders of magnitude.

Compelling evidence suggests that AQP4 may play a role in the K + clearance. We recently reported that glutamate, acting on the mGlu5 receptor, regulates AQP4 water permeability. We have now shown, using GST pull down assays, that AQP4 interacts with Na + , K + -ATPase, the pump responsible for active transport of K + , as well as with the mGluR5 receptor. Extensive mutation studies revealed that the amino acid residues Trp30 and Thr31 are the critical sites for interaction. Substitution of Trp30 and Thr31 to Ala decreased or abolished the interaction, while substitution of Thr31 to Asp appeared to enhance the interaction, suggesting that phosphorylation of Thr31 residue may enhance interaction. Using rubidium uptake and astrocyte water permeability measurements, we found that group 1 mGluR agonist DHPG increased both Na + , K + -ATPasemediated K + transport and AQP4-mediated water transport. We created mathematical model of K + transport across plasma membrane in the ES. This model predicts that AQP4-mediated water transport will facilitate K + clearance and stabilize the membrane potential. Thus we have demonstrated a multiprotein K + transporting microdomain in the astrocyte that includes AQP4. This microdomain is functionally regulated by glutamate and serves to optimize the clearance of K + from the ES. Low mobility group proteins are abundant and heterogeneous class of non-histone proteins which have been less investigated than other nonhistone proteins.

Furthermore, pulse-chase experiments revealed accumulation of the intracellular CLU protein form upon proteasome inhibition, while a CLU-specific antibody immunoprecipitated additional higher molecular weight bands after proteasome inhibition that may correspond to ubiquitinated CLU. Lysosome inhibition led to elevated levels of CLU protein but did not induce any changes in the RNA level. Addition of a CLU antibody to the cell medium resulted in reduced protein levels of the secreted form intracellularly, suggesting that secreted CLU is endocytosed and targeted for degradation at the lysosome.

Introduction: Apolipoprotein E (apoE), a major lipid transport protein of 299-aa, has three common isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, apoE4) in humans. ApoE4 is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by overproduction and aggregation of amyloid peptide beta (Ab) in brain. Proteolytic bioactive carboxy-terminal truncated apoE4 fragments have been found in brains of AD patients. Results: We examined the effect of two carboxy-terminal truncated apoE4 forms, apoE4[D(186-299)] and apoE4[D(166-299)], which result by proteolysis in AD brains, on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and Ab levels in HEK293 and human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells transiently transfected with human APP. Lipid-free apoE4-165 led to reduced Ab levels in both cell lines, while it had no effect on sAPPa levels as compared to WT apoE4 or apoE4-185. The decrease in Ab levels by apoE4-165 cannot be attributed to cellular cholesterol levels which were not affected following incubation of cells with WT or truncated apoE4 forms. Incubation of cells with exogenously added Ab in the presence of WT or truncated apoE4 forms showed that apoE4-165 stimulates greatly the reduction of extracellular Ab levels as compared to WT apoE4 or apoE4-185. Furthermore, binding studies, by using intrinsic fluorescence quenching and Elisa, also showed different affinity for the binding of apoE4-165 to Ab as compared to WT apoE4 or apoE4-185. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that potential interactions of aminoterminal region 1-165 of apoE4 with Ab may affect the extracellular Ab levels and may influence the pathogenetic mechanisms that lead to AD.",

The rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque is the predominant underlying process in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes and peripheral vascular disease. The aim of this work is identification, by means of a proteomic approach, of differentially expressed/retained proteins in stable and unstable carotid endarterectomy segments. Methods: We analyzed 19 stable and 29 unstable plaques obtained by carotid endarterectomy. Surgery samples were histologically classified as described previously [1] . 300 lg of extracted proteins were separated by IEF (pH 4-8) and subsequently by SDS-PAGE (10%T, 3%C). 2D images were analyzed by using PD-Quest software and proteins identified by MALDI TOF MS analysis. Results: We identified 95.6% of total extractable proteins resolved by 2D electrophoresis: about 1/3 constitutive and about 2/3 filtered. The results from differential analysis allowed us to identify a panel of nine proteins that are differently represented in stable and unstable plaque extracts.",

Acknowledgements: This work was supported by Fondazione Banco di Sardegna, Italy. Normal human fibroblasts undergo replicative senescence due to both genetic and environmental factors. The proteasome is the major cellular proteolytic machinery, consisted of both a-regulatory and b-catalytic subunits, responsible for the degradation of both normal and damaged proteins. Alterations of proteasome function have been recorded in various biological phenomena including aging and replicative senescence. Loss of proteasome activities and function has been reported upon replicative senescence and oxidative stress. In contrast, proteasome activation extends lifespan in human fibroblasts. The aim of this study was to identify natural compounds and extracts that enhance proteasome activity and may exhibit anti-aging properties. Specifically, we studied the effect of several compounds and extracts derived from greek plants, on proteasome activity of HFL-1 human embryonic fibroblasts. Out of the several compounds tested, we have identified one that caused the following characteristics to the exposed cells: a) a significant increase of all three proteasome activities namely, chymothrypsin-like, thrypsin-like and peptidylglutamylpeptide-hydrolyzing activity, b) increased RNA and protein expression levels of proteasome subunits, c) increased amounts of assembled proteasome, d) decreased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The results so far indicate the beneficial effects of this compound on human fibroblasts. The induction of proteasome through natural compounds provides new insights in anti-aging and therapeutic strategies.",

Fujii Research Reactor Institute, Kyoto University, Osaka, JAPAN Introduction: The accumulation of D-isomers of aspartic acid (D-Asp) in proteins during aging has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, cataracts and arteriosclerosis. D-Asp containing a synthesized in vitro forms an abnormally folded b-sheet and fibril, and is cytotoxic. Here, we sought to identify an unknown proteolytic system specific for the D-Asp-containing protein, namely D-aspartyl endopeptidase (DAEP). Methods: We developed an assay system for DAEP activity using the synthetic D-Asp containing substrate, Succinyl-D-Aspartic acid a-(4methyl-coumaryl-7-amides) (Suc-D-Asp-MCA). Suc-D-Asp-MCA is hydrolyzed and the fluorescence of liberated aminomethylcoumarin is measured at kex = 380 nm and kem = 460 nm. Results and Discussion: Mammalian liver was shown to have the highest DAEP activity among tissues, but DAEP activity was not detected in E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and C. elegans. The molecular weight of the purified mouse DAEP was determined by gel filtration to be 600 kDa. The properties of purified DAEP were as follows: K m was 0.12 mM, optimal pH was 8.5 (at 37\u00b0C), and the specific activity was increased by a factor of two following addition of 3 mM divalent cations (Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , Sr 2+ , Ba 2+ , Mn 2+ ), but was strongly inhibited by Zn 2+ . A specific inhibitor for DAEP (benzoyl-L-Arg-L-His-D-Asp-CH 2 Cl) was also synthesized and applied to identify the components of DAEP by affinity labeling. MALDI-TOF MS analyses revealed glutamate dehydrogenase 1 as a catalytic subunit of DAEP components. DAEP would control levels of the noxious racemized proteins in the long life span of mammals.",

Kletsas Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Ageing, Institute of Biology, National Centre for Scientific Research 'Demokritos', Athens, GREECE Cellular senescence is considered to be a potent anti-cancer mechanism. However, it has been proposed that senescent stroma cells may enhance the growth of adjacent malignant epithelial cells. Exposure of tumours to repeated low doses of c-irradiation is a common treatment regime in several tissues. However, the effect of this stress to the neighboring stromal cells and the interaction of the latter with cancer cells have not been adequately investigated. In this study, we have exposed human lung fibroblasts to repeated subcytotoxic doses of 4Gy of c-irradiation. We have found that a single dose immediately activates a DNA damage response, as shown by the activation of the ATM/Chk2/ p53/p21 WAF1 axis, leading to cell cycle arrest. After a series of 4Gy doses (total dose approx. 50 Gy), followed by cell subculturing, cellular senescence was accelerated, as shown by morphological alterations, growth arrest, p21 WAF1 and p16 INK4a upregulation and senescenceassociated b galactosidase staining. Next, we studied the effect of these prematurely senescent cells on the growth of three human malignant lung cell lines. Medium conditioned by young and prematurely senescent cells has no major effect on the proliferation of all these cell lines. However, in co-culture studies we have found that the growth of cancer cells was strongly enhanced when cultured on senescent cells. In addition, in immunocompromised (SCID) mice c-irradiation-induced senescent cells, similarly to replicative senescent fibroblasts, intensely promoted cancer cells to form tumors. These findings support the idea that replicative-or stress-induced-senescence may contribute to cancer growth. Acknowledgements: Supported by KES!. Introductions: Peroxiredoxins (Prx) are ubiquitously distributed peroxidases that can be divided into 1-Cys and 2-CysPrx groups, based on the number of conserved cysteine residues that participate in their catalytical cycle. Prx have been described to be strictly dependent on thiols (RSH), but recently we have shown that ascorbate (vitamin C) also reduces 1-CysPrx, but not 2-CysPrx, from several taxonomic groups. We are analyzing which structural features of 1-CysPrx can be important for the ascorbate-peroxidase activity.

In addition, a histidine residue conserved only in the active site of 1-Cys Prx is required. The molecular modeling studies followed by mutagenesis and activity assays suggested the importance of histidine and threonine residues to stabilize the ascorbate-protein interaction.

The isoform pattern was shown to be changed as analyzed by native and IEF-PAGE. Isoform I was decreased while isoform II and III were significantly increased at pH 9.0 after 3 and 15 days of incubation, respectively. We have previously reported that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression is induced during apoptosis. Since the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) has been implicated in mediating AChE expression during anticancer drug-induced apoptosis, in this study, we examined its role in the regulation of H 2 O 2 -induced AChE expression using the 293T cell line. We show that H 2 O 2 increases AChE expression via transcriptional activation through JNK, since the JNK inhibitor SP600125, but not the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway inhibitor PD98059 or p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580, attenuated H 2 O 2 -induced AChE expression and its promoter activity. Over-expression of HA-JNK increases H 2 O 2 -induced AChE expression and its promoter activity, whereas the dominant negative mutant form of JNK suppressed H 2 O 2 -induced AChE expression and promoter activity. Mutation analysis indicates that the major response elements for JNK in the AChE promoter are the AP1-like element (TGAGTCT) site, located within the -1565/-1569 region of the AChE promoter, and the ATF2 element (CCACGTCA), within the -2185/-2177 region. The AP1-like element binds to the transcription factors, c-jun and ATF2, while the ATF2 element binds mainly ATF2. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that H 2 O 2 induces AChE expression via the JNK/AP1/ATF2 signaling pathway.",

Fung Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA Spectrin, a major cytoskeletal protein in a wide-range of cells, consists of ab subunits that form functional tetramers. The affinities for the association of the a subunit with the b subunit vary among different spectrin isoforms. The K d for the erythroid spectrin is in the micromolar range, whereas that for the non-erythroid (such as brain) spectrin is in the nanomolar range. A structural and mechanistic understanding of the affinity differences may provide means to understand pathological tetramerization in either erythroid or non-erythroid spectrin. We have used recombinant model proteins of the first 368 amino acids of erythroid a-spectrin that include the region responsible for tetramer formation, to study the association mechanism at the tetramerization site. An a-spectrin protein, SpaI-1-368, which consists of a partial structural domain of the N-terminus of a-spectrin and a b-spectrin protein, SpbI, which consists of a partial domain of the C-terminus of b-spectrin, were used. Positions 16 to 20 and 46 to 52 that are in an unstructured conformation in SpaI-1-368 were spin labeled for EPR studies. The EPR spectra were obtained with and without SpbI. Our results indicate that these regions undergo a conformational change, from unstructured to helical. In addition, isothermal titration calorimetry measurements on the association of each spin labeled protein with SpbI provide information on the effects of spin labeled cysteine replacement on the association affinity. We propose a mechanism for the tetramer formation of erythroid spectrin as well as an explanation for the difference in the affinities at the tetramerization site of the different isoforms.

It is well known that RIPs A chain retrontraslocation is driven by partial protein unfolding and interaction with the ERAD machinery, suggesting that the A-chain hydrophobic C-terminal is exposed allowing its recognition by chaperons or RE membrane interaction. This study investigated the interaction of pulchellin A-chain (r-PAC) C-terminal with biomembrane model. Methods: rPAC-2 and 4 isoforms and two mutants, rPAC 244 and rPAC 239 (lacking 7 and 12 aminoacids from C-terminal region) were produced and proteins were purified by affinity chromatography. Interaction of the proteins with DPPC was studied using Langmuir Monolayers as biomembrane model by measuring kinetics of adsorption and surface elasticity (E). Results: rPAC injection promoted an increase in surface pressure (p) with time for DPPC monolayers, corresponding to its insertion in the membrane model. This increment was proportional to the r-PAC concentration up to 5 ng/ml where no steady state was observed in 500 seconds. Same results was observed for rPAC-24 Faculty of Physics, 4 whereas r-PAC-239 attained a constant p in less than 100s.

Introduction: Satureja hortensis has been been shown to have medicinal value, but research on its basic biochemistry is still very scarce. The purpose of this investigation was to study the enzymatic properties of flavocytochrome b 2 , in S. hortensis leaves. Methods: Leaves were homogenized in phosphate buffer 0.01 M, pH 7.4, centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 minites, then at 35 000 g for 30 minutes. The clear supernatant ('extract') was used in our studies. Flavocytochrome b 2 activity was measured by following the reduction of potassium ferricyanide in the presence of lactate and EDTA. Assays were performed in a spectrophotometer equipped with temperature controller. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the extract was performed under non-denaturating conditions and followed by activity staining in the presence of lactate and tetrazolium blue. Results: pH activity profile indicated optima at pHs 8.0 and 9.5. With potassium ferricyanide as the varied substrate, K m (micromolar) and V max (micromolar/minute/mg prot) were, respectively, 23 and 0.3 at pH 8.0, and 40 and 0.65 at pH 9.5.

Its regulation is due to various factors, and among them the Bcl-2 family proteins play an important role. Bax is one of these proteins and it has a pro-apoptotic function. The C-terminal domain of Bax shows an amphipathic character and it has been demonstrated that during the apoptosis it binds to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to study the secondary structure of peptides which imitate the amino acid sequences of the Cterminal domain of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax (Bax-C) when incorporated into different lipid vesicles with compositions such as EYPC, PI, POPG and a mixture of EYPC/POPG. Infrared spectroscopy results show that while the b-sheet components are predominant in membrane-free Bax-C secondary structure as well as in presence of EYPC vesicles, the peptide changes its conformation in presence of negatively charged membranes depending on the lipid composition and their molar ratio. The negative charges in the model membrane surface cause a marked change from b-sheet to a-helix secondary structure. Moreover, using the attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), we have investigated the orientation of a-helix structures of Bax-C with respect to the oriented bilayer normal when it is incorporated into the same model membranes. The orientation of Bax-C in model membranes was also affected by negatively charged lipids, so that the presence of POPG reduced the insertion angle from 50 in EYPC vesicles to 27 in POPG vesicles. Introduction: G-proteins, through their interaction with G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), act as switches for signal transduction from the extracellular space into the cell. The stimulation of GPCRs leads to the activation of G-proteins, which then activate several effector molecules that lead to many kinds of cellular and physiological responses. Methods: In order to collect recent data concerning interactions between G-proteins and effectors in gpDB, we performed an extensive literature search. The initial sequence information for effectors was retrieved from the UNIPROT database. Annotations regarding the interaction between G-proteins and effectors, the effect of the particular interaction and the corresponding references were appended manually in a spreadsheet. The data has been organized on the basis of a relational model and is stored in a PostgreSQL database system. Results: GpDB currently contains data concerning 410 G-proteins, 2795 GPCRs and 1510 effectors. The data is classified in classes, families, subfamilies and types for G-proteins and GPCRs, while for effectors in families, subfamilies and types. The information on the interaction between G-proteins and effectors is presented in each entry of both of these molecules and also at the subfamily level for G-proteins and at the type level for effectors. Conclusions: GpDB does not aim at being a universal resource for GPCRs, but will be acting complementary to the existing GPCRDB database regarding GPCRs, providing information on the coupling preferences of G-proteins to GPCRs and the interaction between G-proteins and effectors according to the reported data in the scientific literature. Introduction: Transmembrane proteins constitute approximately 20-30% of fully sequenced proteomes and they are responsible for a wide variety of cellular functions. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining crystals of transmembrane proteins suitable for crystallographic studies, biochemical and computational methods are routinely used to determine their topology. Biochemical methods include: techniques of gene fusions, using enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, b-galactosidase, b-lactamase, and various fluorescent proteins, detection of post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, phosphorylation and biotinylation, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, proteolysis methods and epitope mapping techniques. Methods: We performed an extensive literature search (up to January 2007), in order to find studies that reported the use of such biochemical methods for the determination of the topology of transmembrane proteins. The information was evaluated manually and the data are organized in a Mysql database using PHP for creating the web interface. Results: We collected 900 articles regarding 1417 transmembrane proteins. Specifically, 346 articles refer to gene fusions of various reporter proteins, 120 refer to glycosylation scanning, 9 refer to phosphorylation scanning, 10 refer to biotinylation scanning, 88 refer to cysteine scanning, 214 refer to epitope mapping and 113 refer to proteolysis experiments.",

In this study, we employed the Spartathlon race (246 km in <36 hours) as a model of severe physical stress and investigated proteomic alterations in the plasma of athletes obtained at the start-(Athens) and finish-point (Sparta), as well as 2 days after the race ended. Twelve sets of athletes' plasma were analysed by 2D gelelectrophoresis and the differentially expressed proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. Peptidomic analysis revealed extensive proteolysis at the finish-point, partially recovered 2 days after the race ended. Thirty proteins were differentially expressed in the plasma of the athletes obtained at these 3 time points. At the finish point, three unknown function proteins of were overexpressed, as well as amyloid A, complement component 4A -a local mediator of inflammation-and creatine kinase M-type -an serum marker of myocardial infarction playing a role in energy transduction in tissues with large energy demands. Moreover, hemoglobin alpha-and beta-subunit levels decreased at the finish point, while haptoglobins (HPT and HP proteins) were overexpressed 2 days after the race ended. Haptoglobins combine with free plasma hemoglobin, preventing loss of iron through the kidneys and protecting them from damage, while making this protein accessible to degradative enzymes. By these preliminary results we conclude that Spartathlon athletes' plasma proteomics reveal in an integrated fashion, major changes in circulating stress-related proteins, some of as of yet unknown function.

SecA bound to SecYEG undergoes nucleotide-driven conformational changes termed 'insertion-deinsertion' cycles. These changes occur concomitantly and are apparently coupled with the segmental transfer of the preprotein polymer into and across the membrane through the SecYEG preprotein conducting channel. High resolution structures of the archaeal protein-conducting channel and the bacterial SecA motor as well as several mutations that affect SecYEG function have been identified however none of the above addresses the questions of how these subunits assemble to form the functional translocase or which regions of SecYEG are essential for binding to SecA. We have studied the SecA-SecYEG interaction using peptide arrays and combined it with quantitative biophysical measurements, mutagenesis and functional in vitro and in vivo assays. This approach identified several regions on SecYEG that interact with SecA and led to a number of important conclusions: the SecA binding surface on SecYEG is multivalent and requires the contribution of several low affinity sites. The identified sites are mainly located on cytoplasmic loops. Several of the identified binding sites are essential for translocase catalysis. Association of SecA to SecYEG is regulated by temperature and the presence of nucleotide. Collectively these data provide the first, to our knowledge, residue level dissection and dynamics of the SecYEG -SecA interaction.",

Their activity is the result of a balance between two processes: activation of proenzymes and inhibition by Tissue Inhibitors (TIMPs). Multiple Sclerosis (MS) appears associated to an unbalance MMP-2 and MMP-9. MMP-9 is present in three different forms: the inactive proenzyme (92 kDa), a 'long' (82 kDa) active form lacking in the N-terminal propeptide, and a 'short' (66 kDa) active form, lacking N-and C-terminal. TIMP-1 binds with high affinity to the C-terminal domain, the binding between 'short' MMP-9 and TIMP-1 seems unlikely. The aim of this study is to verify the presence of the 'short' active form of MMP-9 in vivo and its potential role as marker of disease in MS. Materials and Methods: MMP-9 and MMP-2 activity was measured using commercially Activity Assay Systems. The levels of gelatinases were, also, measured by zymography on gelatin-copolymerized gels.

In the cell phosphorylation promotes the interaction between KSRP and 14-3-3f protein and impairs the ability of KSRP to degrade RNA targets. Here we examine the molecular details of this mechanism. We report that phosphorylation leads to the unfolding of the structurally atypical and unstable KH1, creating a site for 14-3-3 binding. Using this site 14-3-3 discriminates between phosphorylated and un-modified KH1, driving the nuclear localization of KSRP. 14-3-3-KH1 interaction regulates the mRNA decay activity of KSRP by sequestering the protein in a separate functional pool. This study demonstrates how an mRNA degradation pathway is connected to extra cellular signaling networks by reversible unfolding of a protein domain. Methods: Phage display technology offers a very efficient way to purify and characterize proteins by displaying them on the surface of the bacteriophage virion. In this study, HBe antigen was genetically fused to the minor capsid protein gp3 and displayed on the surface of filamentous phages. To assay the activity of the phage displayed HBe antigen, HBe-phages were tested by ELISA and used for immunization of BALB/c mice. Results and Conclusion: To obtain HBe phages, HBV E gene was cloned into phagemid vector and transferred into E.coli TG1. Four clones was randomly selected and controlled by colony PCR. According to the PCR result, colony3 was rescued by M13 K07 phage and tested by ELISA for their affinity to Hbe antibodies. As the ELISA results were positive, BALB/c mice were immunized with colony3phages. The immune response was detected with ELISA from blood samples and positive response was obtained. These results showed that HBe antigen can be displayed on phage surface without loss of activity and that phages can be effectively used as HBe antigen carrier for the production of monoclonal antibodies. Venom is a rich source of biochemically active enzymes, proteins, peptides and low molecular weight compounds. The peptides in the venoms of scorpions are particularly interesting for pharmaceutical, industrial and protein engineering purposes because of their remarkable diversity, molecular targets, and their flexible loops despite rigid scaffold. The molecular targets are ion channels, acetylcholine receptors, acetylcholine esterase, membranes, coagulant and anticoagulant pathways and metaloproteases which are inhibited or activated with high selectivity and affinity by these peptides. In this report, sequences of the peptides with high similarity to the peptides BeI2, BeM9, BeM10 and BeM14 from Mesobuthus eupeus eupeus scorpion venom were found by Multiple Sequence Alignment by doing BLAST search. The templates were selected and pair wise alignment was carried out by CLUSTALW to achieve best score for alignment. Tertiary structures of these four peptides were predicted by homology modeling from the template structures after several steps of energy minimization. Our results suggest that long chain peptides BeI2, BeM9, BeM10 and BeM14 have affinity for sodium channels. Then, the secondary structure elements in modeled structures were recognized from their atomic coordinates and H-bond pattern by STRIDE. All the peptides have a/ b structure.",

Faustova and J. Ja\u00a8rv Institute of Chemistry, University of Tartu, Tartu, ESTONIA Pyruvate kinase (ATP-pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40, PK) catalyzes the last step of glycolysis, transferring the phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and producing pyruvate and ATP. Activity of one subtype of PK, called L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK), is controlled by phosphorylation at the N-domain of the enzyme. This phosphorylation takes place at Ser(12) residue, flanked by peptide sequence Arg(9)-Arg(10)-Ala(11)-Ser(12)-Val(13). As we have shown previously, this phosphorylation induces cooperative behavior of L-PK, as the nonphosphorylated enzyme is not regulated cooperatively. In this study we investigated influence of phosphopeptide Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(P i )-Val-Ala, added into the reaction mixture, on catalytic properties of the nonphosphorylated L-PK. It was found that this phosphopeptide inhibited the enzyme activity by reducing the V value and increasing the K m value, but was unable to induce cooperative behavior of L-PK. This means that the enzyme phosphorylation cannot be imitated by this short phosphopeptide, although reduction of the enzyme activity can be observed also in the case of L-PK phosphorylation. Some implications of the data are discussed with reference to the mechanism of cooperative regulation of the phosphorylated L-PK.",

Introduction: Hepcidin is a small, 25 amino acids peptide, produced in the liver as a preprohormone (84 aminoacids), containing eight cysteines enrolled in four disulfide bridges. Discovered in early 2000's [1, 2] , this iron regulting 'hormone' control iron concentration in the body by inhibiting intestinal iron absorption and iron recycling by macrophages. Recently T. Ganz and coworkers have demonstrated that hepcidin was capable of inducing ferroportin internalisation and degradation, ferroportin being the unique iron exporter in mammals. Hence in the presence of hepcidin, ferroportin is destroyed, iron is trapped inside the cell and circulating iron concentration is decreased [3] . Our project was to get a reliable source of hepcidin and prohepcidin for cellular assays. Not only the production is not simple because of the four disulfide bridges, but also hepcidin is extremely prone to aggregation and its peptidic synthesis yield is very poor. Methods: We produced Hepcidin and prohepcidin using a Thioredoxin fusion protein based E. Coli expression system that does not require any renaturation step. Recombinant peptides were caracterized using Ellman's regeant, ESI and SELDI-ToF mass spectrometry and their biological activity was tested for their ability to induce ferroprotin degradation in macrophages. Results and Conclusion: We achieved the purification of active recombinant hepcidin (mouse and human) and prohepcidin (mouse). Hepcidin 61 amino acids precursor releases hepcidin upon furin cleavage. We demonstrate that the activity of prohepcidin towards FPN is only related to its capacity to generate hepcidin. Introduction: In the last years, a number of models to study amyloid diseases (Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington and prions) based on nonpathogenic proteins have been developed. We report here our work towards the establishment of a fully bacterial model system to study intracellular protein amyloidogenesis. It is based on the N-terminal WH domain of RepA, an initiator of DNA replication of the pPS10 plasmid of Pseudomonas. RepA dimers (transcriptional repressors) undergo a structural transformation upon binding to origin DNA sequences (iterons), resulting in monomerization (initiator of replication). Such conformational change in WH1 implies a-helix into b-strand conversion. Methods and Results: We have found that RepA-WH1 forms different amyloid assemblies in vitro (spheroids and fibres) depending on its interaction with different DNA sequences (iteron and operator, respectively). This feature is shared with the mammalian prion protein, PrP. We have identified an essential motif in the protein responsible for amyloid cross-aggregation when isolated as a peptide. This has allowed us to design point mutants with enhanced or reduced amyloidogenicity [1] . We have also identified a small ligand molecule competing with DNA binding to RepA-WH1, thus inhibiting the assembly of amyloids [2] . Conclusions: Our results validate the concept that DNA can promote protein assembly into amyloids and reveal that the binding sites of effector molecules can be targeted to inhibit amyloidogenesis. We are now developing a system for the expression in E.coli of WH1 mutants in different genetics backgrounds. Tryptophanase (Trpase) from Esherichia coli is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) -dependent tetrametic enzyme with a molecular weight of 210 kD. We studied the reversible cold inactivation and dissociation of E. coli Trpase and its Y74F, C298S and W330F mutants. The incubation of E. coli Trpases at 2\u00b0C for 20 hours resulted in a significant loss of activity and enhanced the dissociation into dimers. Rewarming at 25\u00b0C restored their initial activity and the re-association of the dimers into the tetrameric active form. We found also that at 25\u00b0C, all apo forms of Trpase markedly (about 70%) dissociated into dimers and further upon cooling to 2\u00b0C (about 90%). We determined the crystal structures of the two mutants, Y74F and C298S in their apo form, at 1.9\u00c5 resolution and compared them to the known structure of holo, wt P. vulgaris Trpase in order to unravel the mechanism of reversible cold dissociation of Trpase. structural analysis revealed that the mutants in their apo form are found in an 'open' conformation compared to the 'closed' conformation of P. vulgaris in its holo form. Thus, the cold inactivation and dissociation of E. coli Trpases is primarily affected by PLP release. The main cause for the enhanced loss of activity of the three mutants is presumably due to the reduced size of the side chain of the amino acids. This prevents the tight assembly of the active tetramer, making it more susceptible to the cold driven changes in hydrophobic interactions which facilitate PLP release. Introduction: Campylobacter strains are recognized as the major agent of bacterial diarrhoea worldwide. Their virulence depends mainly on extracytoplasmic proteins, many of which contain two or more cysteine residues and achieve the final structure as a result of disulfide bridges formation, catalyzed by Dsb proteins. We identified and characterized a novel subfamily of disulfide oxidoreductases, denoted DsbI. The DsbI N-terminal domain contains five transmembrane helixes and its periplasmic C-terminal domain is predicted to achieve a b-propeller structure, rare for bacterial proteins. The aim of the present work was to analyze Campylobacter jejuni DsbI sequence-structure-function relationships.",

This led us to propose that silkmoth chorion is a natural protective amyloid. Although amyloid fibrils have been associated with many diseases (amyloidoses), it seems that several organisms take advantage of the inherent ability of proteins and peptides, to form such natural protective amyloids, and, our proposal set the basis for the discovery of several functional amyloids.

In budding yeast, the S-phase is switched on when the Cdk1 signal overcomes its G1/S threshold value and multiphosphorylates the G1/S inhibitor Sic1 at six phosphorylation sites. At the G2/M barrier, the mitotic cyclin-Cdk1 complexes trigger the onset of the mitosis by phosphorylating the Cdk1 inhibitor tyrosine kinase Swe1 at multiple sites on its N-terminus and this phosphorylation primes a secondary phosphorylation of Swe1 by polo-kinase Cdc5. The multiphosphorylation of both Sic1 and Swe1 leads these inhibitors to the SCF-mediated destruction. In the present study, we describe the role of Cks1, a phosphoadaptor subunit of cyclin-Cdk1 complex, in the mechanism of multisite phosphorylation of Sic1 and Swe1. Using sitedirected mutagenesis, we have studied the kinetic mechanism of phospho-docking by cyclin-Cdk1-Cks1 complex and found that a minor level of initial phosphorylation of Swe1 initiates a very fast Cks1mediated cooperative propagation of multisite phosphorylation resulting in a highly phosphorylated state of Swe1 protein. Secondly, we have found that contrary to the existing models, the Cks1 plays a critical role in the dynamics of Sic1 phosphorylation by Cdk1. Based on the obtained data, we propose a novel mathematical model for the ultrasensitive G1/S switch.",

Though the exact translocation mechanism is still unknown, endocytosis is the most prevalent uptake mechanism seen for highly cationic peptides. Release from endosomes for colocalization of cargo/drug and target in the cytoplasm is the major hurdle of targeting approaches. Therefore, there is a need of vectors capable of transferring cargo molecules directly into the cytoplasm. Herein we focus on the development of a novel CPP derived from Crotamine (polypeptide in venom of rattle snake) which shows an efficient uptake at low concentrations (\u00a32.5 lM) and cytosolic distribution along with vesicular uptake. Methods: Series of peptides were synthesized by Fmoc strategy, introducing mutations in Cro (27-39) (proposed CPP sequence in Crotamine).

There is evidence that binding of Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions to the Ab may contribute to the Ab oligomerization and toxicity. Cu2+ and Zn2+ form complexes with Ab peptides in vitro; however, the published metal-binding affinities of Ab vary in an enormously large range. The interactions of Cu2+ and Zn2+ with monomeric Ab40 were studied using intrinsic Ab fluorescence and competitive metal-selective fluorescent dyes. Cu2+ formed a soluble 1:1 complex with Ab40, whereas buffer compounds acted as competitive copper-binding ligands. Buffer independent conditional KD for Cu(II)-Ab40 complex at pH 7.4 was equal to 0.035 lmol/l. We also demonstrated that the initial weak Ab40 complex with Zn2+ (KD = 60 lmol/l) partially aggregated during zinc titration experiments and underwent a transition to a more tight complex with KD = 2 lmol/l [1] . Further studies of the transformation of the initial metal ion complexes of Ab42 into amyloid fibrils showed that both metal ions are tightly bound in the forming peptide aggregates, however, these aggregates show lower fluorescence in the presence of Thioflavine T and altered morphology monitored by TEM. Interaction of both Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions with Ab peptides may occur in brain areas affected by Alzheimer's disease and Zn2+-induced transition in the peptide structure might contribute to amyloid plaque formation. The enzyme catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolic acid, a biochemical reaction vital for the cell.

Trr catalyses the transfer of the reducing equivalent from NADPH via FAD to the redox-active disulfide, which then can reduce oxidized thioredoxin. The reduced thioredoxin serves as an electron donor for the reduction of disulfide bonds in various proteins. Methods: Trr and Trr mutants were overexpressed and purified in Escherichia coli. Biochemical properties of Trr were analyzed by sitedirected mutagenesis, spectral analysis and X-ray crystallography. Results: The crystal structure of Trr revealed that the redox-active disulfide formed between Cys-144 and Cys-147 was juxtaposed to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. The mutation at Cys-144 or Cys-147 resulted in complete loss of thioredoxin-reducing activity and changed spectral properties. Regardless of the presence of NADPH, C144S and C144A mutant showed the spectral characteristic of the reduced flavin. In contrast, C147S mutant retained the feature of the oxidized flavin even with NADPH and showed the strong fluorescence quenching, indicating that C147S is restricted to the FO conformation. Conclusions: Our results indicate Dictyostelium discoideum Trr undergoes the FO/FR conformational change for its catalysis and the point mutation at each active site cysteine affects the conformational equilibrium. Also Dictyostelium Trr and its mutants in cysteine are expected as a model to elucidate the mechanism of the transition between the FO and FR conformation of thioredoxin reductase. Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), also known as IgEdependent histamine-releasing factor (HRF), has both extra-and intracellular functions. The histamine releasing ability of recombinant HRF (rHRF) was found to be much less than that of HRF isolated from activated mononuclear cells (HRFmn), raising a question regarding the identity of the histamine releasing protein moiety and suggesting that the active form of extracellular TCTP may be different from intracellular TCTP. We therefore conducted studies directed at identitying the active moiety in rat recombinant TCTP (RrTCTP). We found that some modified RrTCTPs increases IL-8 secretion from BEAS-2B cells more effectively than the original protein. The modified RrTCTP contains intermolecular disulfide bonds unlike the original RrTCTP, suggesting that the former exists as polymers. Site-directed mutagenesis at two cysteine residues, Cys 28 and Cys 172 , indicates that the intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys 172 and Cys 172 is critical for the IL-8 release ability of the modified RrTCTP. We conclude that the biological activity of extracellular TCTP results from the dimerization of TCTP through the intermolecular disulfide bonds.",

Their function is mainly associated with lipid metabolism and they enclose hydrogen peroxide-generating and degrading enzymes. Peroxisomes are highly versatile organelles that quickly adjust their shape, size, number and protein content according to the cellular requirements. In humans, defects in peroxisome biogenesis lead to devastating diseases such as the Zellweger syndrome. Over 30 proteins, the peroxins, are involved in peroxisome biogenesis. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, peroxins of the PEX11-family, namely PEX11, PEX25 and PEX27, participate in peroxisome proliferation. Indeed, yeasts lacking PEX11 present fewer and larger peroxisomes than wild type cells. Orthologues of the yeast PEX11-proteins, PEX11a, b, c and PEX11-1 to -5 have been identified in human and plants, respectively. We sought to analyze the regulation of peroxisome proliferation through the PEX11-protein family in yeast and human cells. Here we show co-expression studies in human cells using DsRed-SKL as peroxisomal protein marker. We analyzed the effect of ectopic expression of HsPEX11a, b and c as well as ScPEX11, ScPEX25, ScPEX27 and AtPEX11-1 and -2 in human cells on peroxisome size, number and shape. We also performed functional tests in yeast pex11-mutants. Our analyses suggest that although the peroxisome proliferation mechanism is conserved from yeast to man some species-specificity does exist regarding the function of PEX11 proteins. To pinpoint the molecular differences between PEX11 orthologues in different kingdoms we performed further studies in cell culture with PEX11-peroxins harboring point mutations and using siRNA. Bood POZ containing gene type 2 (BPOZ-2), which contains ankyrin repeats, NLS, BTB/POZ domains and LXXLL motifs, is an adaptor protein for the E3 ubiquitin ligase scaffold protein CUL3. We isolated a cDNA encoding eEF1A1 as a BPOZ-2 binding protein by screening a human thymus cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system. eEF1A1 is essential for translation and is also involved in the 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of misfolded or unfolded proteins. The binding between BPOZ-2 and eEF1A1 was confirmed by pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays in vitro and in vivo, respectively. BPOZ-2 binds to eEF1A1 through the ankyrin repeats and both BTB/ POZ domains in BPOZ-2 and Domains I and III in eEF1A1. BPOZ-2 and eEF1A1 overexpressed in 293T cells co-localized as speckles within the cytoplasm. BPOZ-2 promoted eEF1A1 ubiquitylation and degradation, suggesting that eEF1A1 is a substrate of BPOZ-2. BPOZ-2 inhibited GTP binding to eEF1A1 and prevented translation in in vitro translation assay using rabbit reticulocytes.",

            "text": "Plant specific phi class GST, OsGSTF3: herbicide specificity and catalytic roles OsGSTF5 showed high specific activity toward chloroacetanilide herbicides used this experiment. The tau class GST enzymes displayed remarkable activity toward the diphenylether herbicide, fluorodifen. In order to elucidate the catalytic role of evolutionally conserved residues in plant GST, Tyr8, Ser13, Cys22 and Ser38 residues of the OsGSTF3 were replaced with alanine. The Ser13Ala, Cys22Ala and Ser38Ala did not affect the glutathione conjugation activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. On the other hands, the substitution of Tyr8 with alanine resulted in a notable decrease in the specific activity toward CDNB to 11% of the wild-type value. The pK a of the thiol of GSH in the Y8A-GSH complex was estimated to be around 8.5, which was about 2.0 pK units higher than that of the wild type. Therefore, Tyr8 is essential for lowering the pK a and enhancing the nucleophilicity of the thiol of GSH in the active site of OsGSTF3, and it is major contribution of GST to catalysis. Toxoflavin produced by Burkholderia glumae causes rice grain rot and seeding rot in rice. Recently, it was found that an enzyme TflA (Toxoflavin Lyase) degrades such phytotoxin responsible for pathogenicity. Subsequently, determination of a crystal structure of TflA has been carried out using various mutants due to the difficulty in producing a crystal of the wild-type TflA. Recently, we were successful in crystallizing a mutant enzyme, and in determining its structure by using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method. In order to clearly define the mechanism of the degradation pathway of toxoflavin, a crystal structure with the substrate bound in its active site is crucial. However, obtaining a crystal complexed with the substrate failed. Functionally active and inactive mutants were systematically produced by Ala-scanning method, and those mutants were subjected to crystallization. Among those mutants, several produced crystals complexed with a toxoflavin analog, 8-azaxanthine. By determination of 1.6\u00c5 resolution data, we found the binding site of metal in its active site, presumably manganese, and 8-azaxanthine in close vicinity, suggesting that the bound metal is critical to the catalytic activity. Crystal structure of another mutant at 1.41\u00c5 resolution was also obtained with somewhat degraded substrate, accordingly corresponding with the functional activities of the mutants. Further refinement will be carried out for better understanding of the degradation mechanism.",

Apart from the classic LPXTG pattern, other similar patters do exist, which are responsible for the cleavage of other variants of the Sortase. We are currently working in expanding the HMM to include them in a prediction system, as well as to allow for a proper discrimination of the cleavage specificity between different types of the Sortases. The periplasmic C-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli DsbD protein (cDsbD) has a thioredoxin fold. The two cysteines in the CXXC motif serve as the reductant for the disulfide bond of the N-terminal domain which can in turn act as a reductant for various periplasmic partners. The resulting disulfide bond in cDsbD is reduced via an unknown mechanism by the transmembrane helical domain of the protein. We show by NMR analysis of 13 C, 15 N-labelled cDsbD that the protein is rigid, is stable to extremes of pH and undergoes only localised conformational changes in the vicinity of the CXXC motif, and in adjacent regions of secondary structure, upon undergoing the reduced/ oxidized transition. pK a values have been determined, using 2D NMR, for the N-terminal cysteine of the CXXC motif, Cys461, as well as for other active-site residues. It is demonstrated using site-directed mutagenesis that the negative charges of the side chains of Asp455 and Glu468 in the active site contribute to the unusually high pK a , 10.5, of Cys461. This value is higher than expected from knowledge of the reduction potential of cDsbD. In a double mutant of cDsbD, D455N/ E468Q, the pK a of Cys461 is lowered to 8.6, a value close to that expected for an unperturbed cysteine residue. The pK a of the second cysteine in wild-type cDsbD, Cys464, is significantly higher than the maximum pH value that was studied (pH 12.2). Unequilibrium melting of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was studied by differential scanning microcalorimetry in a wide range of pH and at different scanning rates. The data obtained were used to determine the kinetic parameters of heat denaturation of GFP (rate constants and activation energies of denaturation). Using the methods of circular dichroism spectroscopy, the kinetic parameters of GFP in the range of temperature-induced denaturation transitions were obtained in direct kinetic experiments. It was shown that the rate constants of GFP denaturation, obtained from microcalorimetry data, are well compatible with the rate constants from direct the kinetic experiments. Thus, it was demonstrated that, kinetic parameters of denaturation and some other structural characteristics of the transition state of the proteins can be obtained using differential scanning microcalorimetry. This approach is less tedious and allows calculating with a high accuracy all thermodynamic functions of the transition state. Increments of GFP heat capacity at transition from the native state to the transition state and from the native state to the denatured state were determined from the obtained data. This permitted us calculating such thermodynamic functions as enthalpy, entropy and free energy of GFP activation. The transition state of GFP was described. It was concluded that the extent of exposure of hydrophobic groups of the transition state of GFP varies slightly from that of the native state and the activation changes involve the entire structure of the GFP molecule. Methods: I will review the mechanism that regulates signalling from chemotactic receptors to the cytoskeleton, to elicit cell polarity and directed migration. To interpret the external gradient of chemoattractant, a cell must not only transmit the attractant signal from the cell surface to the polarity and migration machinery, but must also compare different intensities of signal at different parts of the cell surface and convert these into directed polarity.",

In the present contribution, we describe the effects of Ca 2+ binding on the surface hydrophobicity and stability of the NRD. A combination of fluorescence and IR spectroscopy, molecular exclusion chromatography and proteolysis reveal that Ca 2+ , at the same concentrations that make the native HlyA less stable and more hydrophobic, make NRD more thermodynamically stable, and its surface less hydrophobic.

Some members of the RTK III family, such as the c-Kit and FLT3 receptors, are activated during the very early stages of hematopoiesis, making their ligands interesting targets for rational drug design. Besides binding its natural ligand, the FLT3-receptor is suggested to also recognize a legume lectin, the Dolichos lablab mannose/glucose binding lectin (FRIL). Presumably, this interaction explains the FRIL-mediated preserving effect on hematopoietic progenitors in suspension culture. To get a better understanding of the binding modus and the activation of the receptor upon ligand binding, we generated the tools necessary for the thermodynamic and structural analyses of both L/R and FRIL/R complexes.

Thus, in the present study, sodium-alginate was added into different ionic salt (ZnCl 2 , CaCl 2 and CuCl 2 ). In seeking for augmenting enzyme stability, we entrapped the enzyme, alkaline phosphatase as a model, inside alginate microspheres and determined its activity against several physicochemical parameters including various temperatures, pH, microsphere size and different types of metals. Unique to our study, we added the enzyme into the sodium-alginate gel directly (the additive form) and investigated its stability within this medium against the same parameters stated above. According to the results, this method proved to preserve enzyme activity with a higher extent of efficacy. Enzyme activity showed to be inversely proportional to the microsphere size. Among different metals used, Zn 2+ preserved enzyme activity to a higher degree (47% and 29% of the native enzyme activity) against pH of 4 and temperature of 65\u00b0C respectively as compared with Ca 2+ (28% and 26%) and Cu 2+ (24% and 17%) while the native enzyme lost its activity entirely. In the same conditions, the additive form preserved enzyme activity more efficiently (65% and 89%). Protecting the enzyme in the additive form when compared with one entrapped in microspheres thus offers an easier, faster, cheaper and above all more efficient method toward restoring enzyme stability. Introduction: CK2 is an antiapoptotic protein kinase, which regulates different survival pathways. One of these is rapresented by Akt (PKB), a kinase whose activation requires the phosphorylation of two key residues: Thr308 and Ser473. We have previously found that CK2 enhances Akt activity by directly phosphorylating Ser129; here we show that it also positively regulates the phosphorylation state of Thr308, which is not a direct target of CK2. Methods: To assess if CK2 modulates the phosphorylation of Akt Thr308 by facilitating the accessibility to Thr308, we measured the in vitro activity of the Thr308 kinase PDK1 toward different forms of Akt, previously phosphorylated or not by CK2 at Ser129. To check if phosphorylation or dephosphorylation processes are important in the control of Thr308 operated by CK2 in vivo, we transfected cells with wt or Ser129Ala Akt, and analyzed the Thr308 phosphorylation under cellular conditions where PDK1 is activated or phosphatase activity is blocked. The formation of the protective complex Akt/Hsp90 under different conditions of CK2-dependent Akt phosphorylation was also analyzed.",

In this study we have used a pho84D pho87D pho90D pho91D quadruple deletion strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae devoid of all inorganic phosphate transporter genes except for PHO89 to functionally characterize Pho89 under conditions where its expression is hyper stimulated. Indeed, under these conditions the Pho89 protein is strongly up-regulated and is the sole high-capacity phosphate transporter sustaining cellular acquisition of inorganic phosphate. In this quadruple deletion strain PHO-pathway regulation is lost. Even if Pho89 is synthesized in cells grown at pH 4.5-8.0 the transporter is functionally active at alkaline conditions only, with a Km value reflecting the high-affinity properties of the transporter and with a transport rate about 100-fold higher than that of the protein in a wild-type strain. Even at these hyper-expressive conditions the Pho89 is unable to sense and signal extracellular phosphate levels across the plasma membrane. In cells grown at pH 8.0 Pho89-mediated phosphate uptake at alkaline pH is cation-dependent with a strong activation by Na + ions and sensitivity to the protonophore CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone).

However, further truncation of C-terminal sequence, as in case of zDCLK(378-652), resulted in complete loss of the kinase activity, probably due to deletion of the subdomain sequence essential for the catalytic activity. Furthermore, zDCLK became activated by autophosphorylation and by amino acid substitution of Thr576 in the activation loop to Asp that mimics phosphorylated kinase.

PP3-74 siRNA as a tool to study S100A6 function in human epithelial HEp-2 cells L. P. Slomnicki and W. Lesniak The Nencki Institute of Expreimental Biology, Warsaw, POLAND S100A6 (calcyclin) is an 11 kDa cell-specific calcium binding protein, a member of the S100 family. So far, there are more than twenty S100 proteins identified. They are widely distributed in human tissues and implicated in many regulatory processes. S100A6, a calcium sensor, is involved in cell cycle, exocytosis, cytoskeleton rearrangement and dif- ). The aim of our work is to elucidate the S100A6 role in cellular processes. For that we prepared human epithelial HEp-2 cells stably transfected with siRNA against S100A6. Such cells have dramatically reduced S100A6 protein content confirmed by Western blot analysis. Using MTT viability assay we showed that these cells reveal increased resistance to apoptotic stimuli (induced by hydrogen peroxide) in comparison to control cells. We investigated S100A6 interactions involving p53 which might explain why the lack of S100A6 increases viability of cells exposed to proapoptotic factors. For that we applied co-immunoprecipitation, affinity chromatography, Western blot analysis, luciferase assay etc. Our results suggest that S100A6 may be involved in apoptosis via its interaction with p53. To reveal specific metal-binding properties of sMT-3 we studied binding of Zn(II), Cd(II) and Cu(I) ions to sMT-3 in comparison with human MT-3 (hMT-3), which provided detailed information about metal-binding stoichiometry of sMT-3, composition of metal-thiolate clusters and their stability against pH.

Although the first enzyme of the hypusine pathway has been extensively studied, the structure and mechanism of Lia1 remain to be characterized. Hence, combined techniques were used to evaluate Lia1 catalysis, metal/substrate binding and structural conformation. Like human DOHH, recombinant Lia1 is an iron metalloenzyme. Iron is essential for enzyme activity since its loss renders the enzyme totally inactive. The separation of iron-free and iron-bound forms by gel filtration and native gel electrophoresis suggests structural differences in Lia1 tertiary structure. The ability of Lia1 to undergo conformational changes prompted us to use a set of complementary spectroscopic approaches (CD and quenching of tryptophan fluorescence) and SAXS to obtain detailed information on the processes underlying dissociation of iron at different levels of the protein organization. The additive effect of weak interactions, especially the ones established within the metal center, resulted in an active enzyme in a stabilized and compact three-dimensional fold. Loss of tertiary contacts upon iron displacement led to an elongated conformation of Lia1, in which both N-and C-terminal domains are no longer in close proximity to guarantee the proper orientation of the active groups within the active site pocket. Thus, our results demonstrate an essential structural role for iron-binding in addition to its contribution to the catalytic reaction. SUMOylation is a dynamic process of post-translational modification of proteins. Similar to the ubiquitinylation, SUMO (small ubiquitin related modifyer) is covalently attached to lysine residues of its target proteins in a three step catalytic mechanism. This SUMOylation can be reversed by specific proteases. A large number of SUMO-targets have been discovered, which underlines the function of SUMO as regulator of various cellular processes, although its physiological consequences are not precisely understood. Under hypoxia Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1a has been shown to undergo modification by the three SUMO isoforms SUMO-1, -2 and -3 [1] . SUMOylation occurs within and adjacent to the oxygen dependent degradation domain of HIF-1a whereby lysine 391 and lysine 477 have been determined as specific SUMO acceptor sites [2] . This attachment of SUMO seems to influence HIF-1a stability and its transcriptional activity. ",

We determined the cDNA-derived amino acid sequences of two arginine kinases (AK1 and AK2) from the annelid Sabellastarte indica, cloned the cDNA into pMAL plasmid and expressed them in E. coli. The recombinant Sabellastarte AK2 mainly showed stronger activity for both D-and L-arginine, a very unique substrate specificity not seen before in usual AKs.

The L64I and L64V mutants exhibited a significant increase in enzyme activity for both D-and L-arginine than the wildtype. On the other hand, L64A, L64S and L64P caused a remarkable decrease in enzyme activity. This indicates that the 64th residue is one of the key residues in enzyme catalysis.

Although DEFL is genetically implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation making it a good candidate for anticancer research, its precise function and structure are currently unknown. In this study, we first performed a bioinformatics analysis on the DEFL amino acid sequence including a combination of disorder/order and 3D-structure predictions. Our findings suggest that at least the N-terminal part of DEFL contains sequence repeats reminiscent of repeats of the HEAT-family that mediate protein-protein interactions. Their presence indicates that DEFL likely acts in a complex with other proteins and suggests a mainly a-helical structure for at least the N-terminal region. In parallel, we performed over-expression experiments of DEFL in E.coli aiming at production and purification of the protein for experimental structural analysis. The full-length (3003 bp) and the N-terminal (990 bp) coding regions of defl from D. melonogaster were cloned into the expression vector pET15b for this purpose. Both the full-length protein and the N-terminal fragment were successfully over-expressed as 6xHis-tagged proteins in BL21 plysS and BL21 cells, respectively. Expression was achieved only by tight control of cell growth combined with good aeration of the culture. Both overexpressed proteins were localized exclusively to insoluble inclusion bodies and their complete solubilization was achieved by addition of the detergent sarcosyl. The purified proteins were subsequently studied by CD spectroscopy. The far-UV CD spectrum of the N-terminal fragment showed a relatively high a-helical content in accord with our structure predictions.

It is logic to believe that poisonous substances interfere with the normal biological functions in mammals. Searching for bitter herbs as therapeutics has long been used in traditional medicines. In this study, we classified most drugs according to their pharmacological effects and taste, constructed the structural models of bitter taste receptors T2R5, T2R14, T2R16, T2R43 and T2R61, and identified the structural basis between bitter taste and pharmacological properties using H1 antihistaminics as an example. Methods: Therapeutic agents were grouped according to their pharmacological effect and taste. Structural models of bitter taste receptors T2R5, T2R14, T2R16, T2R34 and T2R61 and histamine H1-receptor were constructed by homology modeling. Selected H1 antihistaminics were docked into the active sites of the receptors. The active site was compared between the bitter taste receptors and the histamine H1receptor. Introduction: Juvenile hormone (JH) is essential for multiple physiological processes. It controls larval development, metamorphosis and adult reproduction. In the Lepidopterian hemolymph, 99% of JH is bound to juvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP), which protects the JH molecule from nonspecific degradation and serves as a carrier supplying the hormone to the target tissues. In G. mellonella JHBP is produced in the fat body cells. This molecule consists of 225 amino acid residues and is basic glycoprotein (pI 8.1). Until now it has not been studied whether JHBP molecules may have a membrane binding protein as a potential receptor. Methods: To test this hypothesis, fat body membrane proteins from G. mellonella larvae were isolated and tested for JHBP binding activity using surface plasmon resonance (SPR).",

Proteases comprise the second largest group of enzymes encoded by mammalian genomes. Thus, at least 569 proteolytic enzymes have been catalogued in the human degradome. This number reflects the fundamental roles of proteases in normal and pathological processes, including cancer. In this regard, proteases facilitate the spreading of tumor cells and formation of distant metastasis through degradation of extracellular matrix components. This fact has made that these enzymes have long been associated with cancer progression. However, recent studies have revealed that different proteases can also act as tumor-protective enzymes (1) . Most of these enzymes are metalloproteases and five of them, ADAMTS-1, -8, -9, -15 and -18 belong to the ADAMTS family. We have recently reported that ADAMTS-12 also exhibits antitumoral properties in a cell-based model through modulation of Rasdependent ERK signalling pathway (2) . Now, we have found that this gene is epigenetically silenced in several types of cancer, including colon carcinomas, suggesting that this mechanism can be used to abrogate the tumor-suppressive actions of this enzyme. Likewise, we also show that ADAMTS-15 confers antitumoral properties to colon cancer cells expressing this metalloprotease, but its inactivation in the tumors occurs by mutation and not for epigenetic silencing.

We hypothesized that the hyaluronidase Hyal2 may be one of the HA regulatory factors. Experiments were performed in the rat transformed fibroblastic cell line BB16. As the rate of endogenous expression of Hyal2 in these cell lines is low, stable transfectants of Hyal2 (BB16Hy2+) were established and compared with mock-transfected cells (BB16mock). Hyal2 overexpression markedly reduced the strong HA endocytosis displayed by BB16 cells. A portion of exogenous HA was taken up in a receptor dependent manner but the largest part was linked to a macropinocytic process. Therefore, the effects of Hyal2 on various endocytic processes were explored using specific markers. Hyal2 did not diminish receptormediated endocytosis but markedly reduced fluid-phase endocytosis. In addition, observation of BB16Hy2+ cells through transmission electron microscopy showed reduced numbers of macropinosomes, suggesting a strong inhibition of macropinocytosis. Actin filaments are a main component of macropinosome formation; Hyal2 expression disrupted the bundles of actin filaments which are a hallmark of cell protrusions.",

Introduction: The number of Kilis goats bred in Turkey is about 11 million which corresponds to 25% of the goats bred in the country. These goats have adopted to the climatic conditions of the Southeastern Anatolia and give 300-400 kg of milk at every lactation. Selenium (Se) has long been considered as a highly toxic and carcinogenic element. The Se in the atmosphere is taken by plants and animals and passes to humans through food chain. The Se need of animals is mainly supplied with feed. The Se atom shows sinergical impact in animals with vitamin E and at the same time adds to the structure of Glutatyon Peroksidaz enzyme which works as a strong antioxidant. In addition, type I Iodotyreonin Deiodinaz enzyme is defined as another enxyme containing Se. The Se deficiency causes stopped the growth and decrease in efficiency in animals it results in muscular dystrophy in offsprings. This study aims to investigate Se levels in serums of blood samples obtained from 12 healthy Kilis goats. Methods: The Se levels of the serums was determined by spectrofluorometric method.",

Introduction: Biglycan is absent in the normal cornea, but UVR exposure leads to a significant expression of the biglycan gene in the rabbit cornea, an effect that decreases after healing is completed, indicating the envolvement of biglycan in the corneal repair process. In the present study, we have investigated possible involvement of biglycan in the modulation of the survival of keratocytes. Methods: Keratocytes were grown either under serum free conditions to obtain quiescent keratocyte cell culture or in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum to induce keratocyte transition into myofibroblasts (activated keratocyte phenotype). Myofibroblastic phenotype was confirmed by immunocytochemistry with anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin antibodies. Cell death was induced in both cell cultures by interleukin-1 in the presence or absence of biglycan. Histone-associated DNA fragments were assayed by using a cell death detection ELISA.",

            "text": "Difference in neutrophil dynamics induced by a novel superstructure of collagen Background: Recently, it was shown immune cells to interact with type I collagen using leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor-1 (LAIR-1). Neutrophil, which is one of those cells, transmigrates through blood vessel wall and migrates into an extracellular matrix toward an inflammatory site, as a vital first immune response. Rho family protein generally plays a crucial role in regulating the cell motility and function. However, the intracellular signaling pathway of neutrophil induced by the collagen in the extracellular matrix remains unclear. Until now, we have shown that type I collagen hydrolyzed by actinidain (AP-collagen) changes the conformation by itself and the motility of neutrophil. In this study, we investigated expression of actin, Cdc42, RhoA and Rac1 in neutrophil cultured on AP-collagen assembly. Methods: We prepared pepsin-hydrolyzed type I collagen (atelocollagen) and AP-collagen from chicken skin. Neutrophil was collected from a mouse and subsequently it was cultured on a plate coated with the atelocollagen or the AP-collagen. To investigate neutrophil dynamics on the collagen assembly, we observed F-actin labeled with MFP-555-Phalloidin by using a fluorescence microscopy. To find further evidence of the actin activation, Rho family proteins were visualized by staining with specific antibodies. Results: The fluorescence observations revealed that the expression of Rho family proteins of neutrophil on the AP-collagen and the atelocollagen assembly is clearly different. Therefore, neutrophil would recognize the conformational difference between the AP-collagen and the atelocollagen as a scaffold. In conclusion, we found that the AP-collagen alters intracellular signaling pathways of neutrophil and induces its specific function. The expression of the abnormal protein Bcr-Abl is the primary cause of the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Its kinase activity confers proliferative and survival advantage to CML cells. The cells containing Bcr-Abl also display altered adhesion properties. We studied the effects of Bcr-Abl inhibition on the adhesivity of CMLderived cell lines (JURL-MK1, K562) to fibronectin and on the activity of Rho/ROCK/LIM signaling pathway. This pathway links the integrins, the membrane mediators of cell-matrix adhesion, to the proteins which regulate the cytoskeleton structure. Using a quantitative and sensitive assay, we showed that Imatinib mesylate, a specific inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, induces a large decrease in the extent of cell adhesion to fibronectin-coated surfaces. Similar effect was observed after treatment with 17-AAG, an inhibitor of the chaperone HSP90 which is known to stabilize Bcr-Abl among others. Introduction: Testicular germ cell tumor is the most frequent solid tumor among young men and in most cases it can be cured.

TB4P increased HIF-1a stabilization and transactivation, which is measured by the increase of hypoxia response element (HRE)-luciferase activity and target gene, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcription. TB4P also elevated ROS production and ERK phosphorylation. H2O2 treatment elevated HIF-1a stabilization and ERK phosphorylation. PD98059, ERK inhibitor reduced HIF-1a increased by TB4P. Paclitaxel-induced cell death was inhibited by hypoxia conditioning that increased HIF-1a stabilization, ERK phosphorylation and ROS production. PD98059 and Nacetylcysteine (NAC) reversed paclitaxel-induced cell death which was attenuated by hypoxia.

Introduction: Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a member of a family of five structurally related extracellular glycoproteins that plays a major role in cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. Due to its multifunctional nature and its ability to bind to a panoply of cell surface receptors and matrix proteins, TSP-1 has been identified as a regulator of angiogenesis and tumor progression. However, the overall involvement of TSP-1 remains complex and controversial as both stimulatory and inhibitory effects in tumorigenesis have been reported. Here, we addressed the regulation of TSP-1 by growth factors such as EGF and HGF/SF and analysed its effects on human follicular (FTC-133) and papillary (TPC-1) thyroid cancer cells invasion. Results: We found that both EGF and HGF/SF increased the invasive potential of respectively FTC-133 and TPC-1 carcinoma cells. In the former cell type, EGF up-regulated TSP-1 expression in a MAPK/ ERK and PI3-kinase-dependent manner whereas in the latter cells, HGF/SF repressed TSP-1 expression through a pathway that involved activating transcription factor-1 (ATF-1). In addition, using purified protein and neutralizing antibodies, we proved that TSP-1 was, at least in part, responsible for the regulation of cell invasion but with opposing outcomes : stimulatory in follicular and inhibitory in papillary cancer cells.",

We report by this study evidences that integrins act in modulating cell sensitivity to apoptosis induced by either serum starvation or staurosporin. Various cells (HS27, HeLa, Hep2, and DOK) were plated on collagen or fibronectin. After 2 h for adherence and spreading, apoptosis was induced by either serum starvation or staurosporin treatment. Cells were quantified for apoptosis 24 h later. In control experiments, cells plated in similar conditions on matrix protein coated surfaces, were counted for apoptosis after 24 h maintenance in medium supplemented with serum, and without staurosporin treatment. Results showed that the cells plated on collagen proved a higher sensitivity to apoptosis induced by either serum starvation or staurosporin as compared with the cells plated on fibronectin. A differential behavior was noted for various cells as a function of matrix protein used for plating. On collagen HS27 cells showed the highest sensitivity to apoptosis, while on fibronectin Hep2 cells were mostly affected. On the other hand, the sensitivity to apoptosis induced by serum starvation was lower for the cells plated on fibronectin, as compared with cells plated on collagen. Therefore, our results suggested an ability of integrins to modulate cell sensitivity to apoptosis either induced by serum starvation or staurosporin. Abstract: Carbohydrate moieties of salivary mucins play various roles in life processes, especially as a microbial trapping agent. While structural details of the salivary O-glycans from several mammalian sources are well studied, very few information is currently available for the corresponding N-glycans. The existence of N-glycans alongside the O-glycans on mucin isolated from rat sublingual gland has previously been implicated by total glycosyl compositional analysis but the respective structural data are both lacking. The advent of facile glycomic mapping and sequencing methods by mass spectrometry (MS) has enabled a structural reinvestigation into many previously unsolved issues. For the first time, high energy collision induced dissociation (CID) MALDI-MS/MS as implemented on a TOF/TOF instrument was applied to permethyl derivatives of mucin type O-glycans and N-glycans, from which the linkage specific fragmentation pattern could be established. The predominant O-glycans carried on the rat sublingual mucin were defined as sialylated core three and four types whereas the N-glycans were determined to be non-bisected hybrid types similarly carrying a sialylated type II chain. The masking effect of terminal sialylation on the tight binding of rat sublingual mucin to Galb1 fi 4Glc-NAc specific lectins and three oligomannose specific lectins were critically demonstrated in this study. In order to elucidate the immunological role of this novel protein found in crustaceans we studied by light and confocal microscopy the lectin hemocyte recognition; by spectrophotometric NBT reduction assay using elicitors and inhibitors we identified the effect of LsL on the modulation of oxidative burst mechanism on its own hemocytes. Usign western blot analyses we identified the glycoprotein attached to membrane that binds lectin on adherent cells. LsL binds 4% of total fixed circulant hemocytes (non-activated), but is able recognize 85% of adhered granular hemocytes showing filipodia and pseudopodia (activated), inducing the reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) production on the recognized cells. This effect was dose and time dependent (optimal: 100 ng/1 \u00b7 10 5 cells/20 minutes), is specifically inhibited by N-acetylated sugars residues (NeuAc, GalNAc or GlcNAc), superoxide dismutase ( Conclusions: These results further support the hypothesis that circulating GAGs may function as immunomodulators and its increase in release and degradation could be a biological response to modulate inflammation during disease.",

This asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) activity is highly conserved throughout vertebrate phylogeny and remains a significant factor in the preparation and delivery of pharmaceuticals, yet a biological purpose of the Ashwell receptor has remained elusive. Results: We have identified endogenous ligands of the Ashwell receptor as glycoproteins and regulatory components in blood coagulation and thrombosis that include von Willebrand factor (VWF) and platelets. Properties of the Ashwell receptor including its post-natal onset of expression, high capacity, and rapid kinetics of clearance are consistent with anticipation of a sudden widespread alteration of glycoprotein structure within the circulatory system, perhaps following infection by pathogens encoding neuraminidase activity. We show that the thrombocytopenia associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) infection, which has been attributed to the consumptive coagulopathy of sepsis, is in fact due to the host's Ashwell receptor activity. The NanA sialidase of SPN is responsible for de-sialylating pro-thrombotic components during sepsis, resulting in the formation of asialo-platelets and asialo-VWF that are rapidly cleared from circulation by the Ashwell receptor.

Introduction: Frutalin is an allb homotetrameric 66 kDa D-Galactose binding lectin that stimulates natural killer cell in vitro, leukocyte migration in vivo and binding to histologic breast cancer samples. Since these findings are related to its specificity to sugars on cell surface, this study aimed at investigating frutalin interaction with biomembrane models. Methods: Langmuir monolayers were employed as biomembrane mimetic system, since they present the advantage of controlling lipid packing and the architecture of the lipid system. Furthermore, using large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), CD, fluorescence emission and isothermal titration calorimetric (ITC) measurements were performed. Results: Frutalin strongly interacts with mixed glyco-phospho lipid systems whereas no significant alterations for pure phospholipid monolayers were observed. Among the galacto-glycolipids, the interaction is more facilitated for the galactose polar head lipid than sulfated-galactose, as observed by adsorption kinetics and ITC. Besides, surface elasticity (E) values indicate that the monolayer structure becomes more rigid in presence of frutalin. For GM1 ganglioside (Gal 1-4GalNAc 1-4Gal(3-2aNeuAc) 1-4Glc 1-1'Cer), slightly quantities of the protein adsorb, probably due to the most apart position from the interface of the D-galactose in polar head group.

            "text": "Adenosine monophosphate protein kinase regulates the synthesis of hyaluronan in human aortic smooth muscle cells Although the pathway to synthesize HA is known, little information are available on the mechanisms regulating HA synthesis. Our data showed that the cytoplasm availability of UDP-sugars regulate HA synthesis. As UDP-sugar biosynthesis requires ATP, we hypothesized that the cellular energy charge (i.e. ATP:AMP ratio) could control HA production. Methods: Cultures of SMC were used as model for Hyaluronan synthesis and cell migration, transfection and siRNA experiments were carried out in order to clarify the role of the key enzymes in the pathway of Hyaluronan synthesis. Results: In human cells the main sensor of ATP:AMP ratio is AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK). At physiological ATP concentration AMPK is not phosphorylated and not active, but at low ATP:AMP ratio AMPK became phosphorylated modifying several metabolic pathways. Treating SMC with AICAR (a chemical activator of AMPK) the HA synthesis decreased whereas the synthesis of other glycosaminoglycans remained unchanged. Using constitutive active constructs and dominant negative AMPK cells data were confirmed. AMPK knockout mice treated with AICAR did not decrease HA production. The mechanism of HA synthesis inhibition mediated by AMPK did not involved a change in gene expression. mRNA coding for HA metabolizing enzymes (i.e. UDP glucose pyrophosphorylase, UDP glucose dehydrogenase, HAS1, 2 and 3 as well as hyaluronidases) in control and AICAR treated SMC did not changed. Conclusion: AMPK activity affects the HA synthesis without changing gene expression, therefore as AMPK has a kinase activity and several enzymes belonging to HA synthetic pathway possess an AMPK phosphorylation consensus sequence, we hypothesize that AMPK, through phoshorylations, could modify the activity of some proteins involved directly in HA or in UDP-sugar precursors synthesis.

Introduction: Mitochondrial complex I is an 980 kDa multimeric enzyme composed of 45 subunits. Although human complex I is associated with disease, its assembly is poorly understood, complicated by its large size and its regulation by two genomes Methods: We analyzed complex I assembly by monitoring the incorporation of either radiolabeled mtDNA-encoded translation products or newly-imported nuclear-gene encoded subunits using blue native-PAGE. We also analyzed a group of patient cell fibroblasts for defects in complex I and loss of the assembly factor CIA30. Results: We found that mtDNA-encoded subunits first assemble into intermediate complexes and require significant chase times for integration into the holoenzyme. In contrast, some imported nuclear-encoded subunits associate with pre-existing complex I subunits to form intermediates and/or the fully assembled holoenzyme. We also found that CIA30 associates with early complex I assembly intermediates. A patient presenting with encephalomyopathy was found to contain only 10% steady-state CIA30 with reduced levels of mature complex I due to defects in assembly. Genetic analysis revealed that the patient had mutations in the gene encoding CIA30. Complementing the deficiency in patient fibroblasts with normal CIA30 restored complex I levels.",

Discussion: The data presented here point to substrate recognition by Mia40 in a very precise and site-specific manner which supports the concept that Mia40 is not a general oxidase but rather acts specifically. Additionally, the co-ordinated steps that are proposed to occur between the first cysteine docking and the release reaction argue for a processive character of Mia40 which is strikingly different from the other known cellular protein oxidases, such as DsbA and PDI. This work provides an important framework for a mechanistic understanding of this fundamental biological process. Introduction: The high mitochondrial membrane potential (inside negative) is a powerful driving force for electrophoretic influx of cations, of which K + is the most abundant one. Because K + influx is always accompanied by influx of water, mitochondria tend to swell and the outer membrane may rupture. The K + /H + exchanger, allowing electroneutral exchange of K + against H + , is assumed to counteract this process. Recently we have identified a novel eukaryotic gene family (Y0l027 and Mrs7 in yeast, LETM1 in humans) involved in mitochondrial K+ homeostasis and volume control. Genetic screen for yol027D multi-copy suppressors led to the identification of Ydl183. Methods: We have measured mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial potassium-acetate induced swelling and K+/H+ exchange in submitochondrial particles. Results: Yeast yol027D cells have strongly reduced K+/H+ exchange activities, low membrane potential and reduced respiratory growth. While double disruption yol027D mrs7D and yol027D ydl183D did not significantly change these phenotypes, triple disruption yol027D mrs7D ydl183D caused much more pronounced phenotype: K+/H+ exchange activity was below detection level, membrane potential was low and cell viability was considerably reduced. Overexpression of Yol027, Mrs7, Ydl183 or human LetM1 in yol027D mrs7D ydl183D cells rescued growth and re-established K+/H+ exchange activity. Conclusion: Yol027p, Mrs7p and Ydl183p all are likely to be involved in formation of an active K+/H+ exchange system. Lack of this activity not only affects mitochondrial functions, but lowers cell vitality. Introduction: Previous studies have established that peripheral monocytes from atherosclerotic patients display specific differences in their expression profile as compared to the normal population. Scavenger receptors (SRBI-II) and the ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) are essential molecules for the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to correlate the phenotype of atherogenic plaques as regards to the expression of SRBI, SRBIII and ABCA1, with the corresponding phenotype of autologous circulating peripheral monocytes. Materials and Methods: Autologous plaque, control vascular tissue and blood samples were collected from 29 human donors undergoing bypass surgery of coronary arteries. Control blood samples were collected from 17 atherosclerosis negative patients, shown by coronary angiography. Using Real-time PCR the expression levels of scavenger receptors (SRBtotal, SRBI, SRBIII) and ABCA1 were quantified. Results: Real time qPCR semi-quantification analysis of the samples in bulk demonstrated that in plaques of human coronary arteries the balance of SRBI/SRB-total (p < 0.0001; unpaired t-test) and SRBIII/ SRB-total (p = 0.0449) were significantly reduced. The same reduction in SRBI/SRB-total (p = 0.0055) was observed in blood monocytes.",

Conclusion: The coincidence of specific events in both plaque tissue and peripheral blood monocytes indicates that atherogenesis is not restricted to the region of the vascular lesion but involves system wide changes in the monocytic cell population. Introduction: Fibrosis is an important pathological process underlying many diseases in many organs; however, the molecular mechanisms involved and the macromolecules participating during the development of fibrosis are not well understood yet. Methods and Results: We have performed proteomic analysis on a renal model of fibrosis, the unilateral ureteric obstruction, in rats. Based on the analysis of our data, we have focused on a particular protein, calreticulin, an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein not previously implicated in fibrosis, which was induced in early and late intervals during the development of fibrosis. We have confirmed proteomic data by Western blotting, immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR, where in all cases calreticulin expression was up-regulated upon ureteric obstruction both at the protein and the mRNA level from early time intervals. We have further tested the involvement of calreticulin in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice, where it was also found to be up-regulated. In cell culture experiments, renal proximal tubule epithelial cells and lung alveolar epithelial cells demonstrated up-regulation of calreticulin, upon stimulation with TGFb, a well known macromolecule involved in the fibrotic process. Introduction: Parvin is a highly conserved protein that contains two calponin homology (CH) domains in tandem. Previous studies suggest that parvin may function as an F-actin-binding protein. Our genetic study in Drosophila strongly suggest that parvin together with its binding partner Integrin-Linked Kinase (ILK) tether the actin cytoskeleton at sites of integrin adhesion in the embryonic muscle attachment sites. However it is not yet known the mechanistic aspects of parvin function in vivo. Methods: We have engineered several transgenic flies carrying full length and truncated forms of parvin fused to GFP that are expressed either by the endogenous regulatory elements of the gene or using the UAS/GAL4 system. Results/Conclusions: Our work suggested that both CH-domains as well the N-terminus region are required for parvin function in vivo. The main localization signal that targets parvin at sites of integrin adhesion resides within the CH2 domain. Overexpression of parvin in several tissues resulted in developmental defects. In particular high levels of parvin in the mesoderm caused lethality that was completely rescued upon co-expression of ILK. This result strongly indicates that ILK controls parvin function in vivo. In addition overexpression of parvin in several epithelia resulted in the missorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton and induction of apoptosis. These effects could also be rescued completely by coexpression of ILK and the inhibitor of apoptosis DIAP1. Collectively our results suggest that parvin integrates multiple signals that play pivotal role in the completion of tissue morphogenesis. Introduction: Monocytes/macrophages represent a part of mononuclear phagocyte system involved in the host response against cancer. They reveal some cytostatic/cytotoxic anticancer activities but were also suggested to promote neoangiogenesis and cancer metastasis.

All methods showed enrichment of AP in both BBM and lipid rafts fraction, 31 P-NMR gave high content of phosphatidylcholine in BBM as expected, but sphingomyelin was more dominant in the lipid rafts together with cholesterol. Various proteins have been associated with our lipid raft preparation such as aminopeptidase-N, prohibitin, beta-actin, and villin 2.

Yamazaki Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, JAPAN Introduction: Elucidation of the processes involved in organogenesis requires a detailed understanding of the complex tissue interactions. The potential regulators for this process include t-SNARE molecules, which have no signal peptides and usually exist on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane to mediate cytoplasmic vesicular fusions, but are temporally localized and secreted extracellularly to activate morphogenic programs in the adjacent cells. In this study, we determined key molecular elements for their extracellular presentation and the subsequent morphogenic function. Methods and Results: The cDNAs encoding mouse syntaxin 1, 2 (epimorphin), 3, 4, 5 and 6 were isolated and tagged with T7 peptide. The analyses of the transgene products revealed that the subpopulations of certain members of t-SNAREs (syntaxin2, 3 are 4) are secreted into medium with phosphatidilserine-bound synaptotagmin and annexin II, in response to the cell stress. The similar mechanisms of the non-classical export have been shown for other leaderless proteins FGF1 and IL-1. We further show that secreted syntaxin 2 (epimorphin) exerts a morphogenic function through binding to alphaV-integrin receptors and activating the FAK-MAPK signaling pathway in the target cells.",

Here, using three human cell models, we depleted cells of Op18 and/or MAP4 by expression of interfering hairpin RNAs and we analyzed the resulting phenotypes. We found that the endogenous levels of Op18 and MAP4 have opposite and counteractive activities that largely govern the partitioning of tubulin dimers in the microtubule array at interphase. Op18 and MAP4 were also found to be the downstream targets of Ca 2 + and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV and PAR-1/MARK2 kinase, respectively, that control the demonstrated counteractive phosphorylation-mediated regulation of tubulin dimer partitioning. Furthermore, to address mechanisms regulating microtubule polymerization in response to cell signals, we developed a system for inducible gene product replacement.

We therefore checked whether the actin cytoskeleton participates in intracellular relocation and nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B in epithelial A431 cells. The p65 subunit distribution was investigated in cells spread on fibronectin after EGF treatment using confocal microscopy. Cells with an intact cytoskeleton and cells treated with cytochalasin D were analyzed. First, immunofluorescent staining showed that A431 cell adhesion to fibronectin induced partial nuclear translocation of RelA/p65, as well as localization on stress fibers and diffusely in the cytosol. Second, after EGF stimulation RelA/p65 was found in ruffles, on reorganized stress fibers, diffusely in cytosol and in discrete actin-rich cytoplasm-membrane patches. Third, further staining for actinin 1, actinin 4, vinculin and paxillin showed that the discrete p65 regions contained all these adhesion proteins. Fourth, cytochalasin D treatment caused p65 redistribution to actincontaining aggregates, and EGF further increased the number of p65containing clusters in cytoplasm. The typical adhesion proteins were also found in these aggregates. Finally, western blot confirmed that EGF caused nuclear translocation of p65 in cells with a cytochalasin D-disrupted cytoskeleton. The results suggest that an intact actin cytoskeleton is not obligatory for nuclear transport of p65 in A431 cells although there is a very tight association between of p65 and actin-rich structures in the cytoplasm. Integrin-linked Kinase (ILK) and the associated proteins Parvin and PINCH assemble a highly conserved protein complex that mediate a link between integrins and actin cytoskeleton. In order to dissect further the ILK-complex function we currently investigate how this complex form at the muscle attachment sites of the Drosophila embryo using three complementary approaches: First, we are examining the hierarchy of molecular interactions that are required for the subcellular localization of the integrin-actin linker complex components. Second, we are monitoring the dynamics of the ILK-complex in vivo using an array of transgenic flies expressing components of the integrin-actin linker complex fused to GFP. Third we are engineering a chimeric ILK form that is constitutively tethered to the plasma membrane and explore the ability to initiate the assembly of the integrin-actin linker complex independent of signals received by integrins. Meanwhile we are using an RNAi-approach and genetic mosaics to identify new roles of ILK in additional morphogenetic processes during Drosophila development. Finally we are exploring the potential functional conservation between mammalian and fly ILK using the UAS/Gal4 expression system. We describe an inflammatory response, characterized by both innate and adaptive immune cells, initiating in the des-/-hearts by day 16 post-partum. The persistence of inflammation in the absence of adaptive immunity (RAG1-/-deficiency) suggests that it is sustained by innate immune mechanisms. Anti-inflammatory molecules, such as IL1-ra and TIMP-1, produced by the injured hearts, as well as apoptosis of the infiltrating cells apparently orchestrate the gradual regression of the granulation-like tissue, leading to scar formation. Microrarray analysis conducted in 3 month-old animals revealed that the majority of the transcripts significantly up-regulated in the desminnull hearts encode for inflammation/immunity-related molecules. Overexpression of the most highly up-regulated (osteopontin, osteoactivin/ Gpnmb, MMP-12 and galectin-3) was confirmed by real-time PCR and immunohistochemical methods. To explore the role of osteopontin, found to be expressed by the inflammatory infiltrates in the desmin-null hearts, we generated mice lacking both desmin and osteopontin (des-/-OPN-/-) and estimated that they exhibit significantly reduced heart fibrosis, compared to the des-/-. Furthermore, we found considerably less MMP-12, osteoactivin and galectin-3 up-regulation in the des-/-OPN-/-hearts. Previously, we have showed that an intramolecular interaction between the amino-terminus and the kinase domain of FAK plays a regulatory role on its activity. To further reveal the molecular mechanistic insight of this regulatory event, we compared the FAK's FERM-like domain with other FERM domains. In particular, several conserved residues which are crucial for interaction with phosphoinositides found in other FERM domains were recognized and mutations of them resulted in the reduction of phosphorylation on Y397 and/or Y576. Indeed, we revealed that FAK's FERM domain possesses a high affinity toward D-3 and D-4 phosphoinositides whereas the aforementioned mutants lost the capacity binding to phosphoinositides. These results were consistent with the decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of FAK while the depletion of phosphate supply or blockage of phosphoinositides in the presence of neomycin in the cell culture conditions. Furthermore, we also found in the absence of phosphoinositide binding led to a significant decrease in cell motility. In contrast, overexpression of wild type FAK or an activated form of FAK (N16-FAK) could rescue this phenotype. Our findings provide a new regulatory mechanism on FAK's activity and cellular function via phosphoinositides. ",

In response to brain injury, astrocytes proliferate and become hypertrophic with an increased expression of intermediate filament proteins. This process is collectively referred to as reactive astrocytosis. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is a member of the lipocalin family that binds to small hydrophobic molecules. LCN2 can be highly induced in both inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. It is implicated in diverse physiological processes, including apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the role of LCN2 in the cell death, morphology, and migration of astrocytes. Lcn2 expression and secretion was increased by inflammatory stimuli in astrocytes. Forced expression of LCN2 or treatment with recombinant LCN2 protein increased the sensitivity of astrocytes to cytotoxic stimuli. Iron and Bim appeared to be involved in the cytotoxic sensitization. Additionally, treatment of astrocytes with the recombinant LCN2 protein induced upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), cell migration, and the morphological change of astrocytes that was similar to characteristic phenotypic change termed reactive astrocytosis. The enhanced cytotoxic vulnerability of astrocytes correlated with the morphological change. The lcn2-induced phenotypic change of astrocytes occurred through Rho-Rho kinase-GFAP pathway, which was positively regulated by nitric oxide and cGMP. Taken together, our results indicate that LCN2 acts in an autocrine fashion to induce cell death sensitization and morphological changes in astrocytes under inflammatory condition, and these phenotypic changes may be the basis of reactive astrocytosis in vivo. Introduction: Integrins are the main family of transmembrane heterodimeric receptors that mediate cell-matrix adhesion in multicellular organisms. The main function of integrins is to trigger, upon activation, the formation of a complex network of cytoskeletal and signaling proteins such as talin, ILK, paxillin, in order to mediate the link between extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton. The Calponin Homology domain-containing protein parvin is one of the proteins so far identified as a binding partner of ILK. In Drosophila there is only one parvin locus coding for a protein that displays 60% identity with the mammalian parvins. In this study we are using the power of Drosophila genetics to assess the functional requirement of parvin in the whole organism.",

Integrins, a main family of mechanotrasducer adhesion molecules that link the extracellular matrix to actin cytoskeleton are essential for the maintenance of cell morphology and tissue integrity in the developing organism. A well established protein complex that links integrins to actin cytoskeleton and regulates the dynamic changes in cell shape is assembled around integrin-linked kinase (ILK). Recent evidence underlines the functional importance of the ILK-complex in human diseases including cardiomyopathy and cancer. Our aim is to use the powerful genetic tools of Drosophila and dissect the in vivo role of the conserved molecular machinery that functions in concert with integrins. We are using a combination of experimental approaches including forward and reverse genetics, high resolution imaging and biochemistry, in order to analyse the spatiotemporal molecular organization and function of the integrin-actin linker complex in muscles and developing epithelia. Introduction: In circulation, platelets adhere to leukocytes forming stable complexes, a process that is mainly mediated via interactions of platelet P-selectin with its leukocyte counter-receptor, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). Several chronic inflammatory diseases and acute coronary syndromes are characterised by an increase in such heterotypic interactions, raising the possibility that pro-inflammatory processes might be initiated in leukocytes upon platelet adhesion. Based on the ability of PSGL-1 to transduce intrinsic intracellular signals following engagement, we aimed to investigate any associated functional consequences of platelet adhesion on monocytes.",

We also report differential effects of platelet binding on monocyte functional responses between non-activated and thrombinactivated platelets. In particular, monocyte CD11b expression and release of pro-inflammatory IL-1b and TNF-a were significantly upregulated upon adhesion of activated platelets, whereas non-activated platelets had negligible effects. Similarly, binding of thrombin-activated platelets but not of non-activated platelets to monocytes induced IjBa degradation, nuclear translocation of NF-jB p65 and inhibition of monocyte apoptosis in the absence of survival factors. Conclusion: Our data suggest that platelet activation status determines whether monocytes become activated following platelet adhesion. Therefore, in the absence of overt platelet activation, PSGL-1 -Pselectin-dependent platelet binding to monocytes may represent a normal physiological phenomenon with little impact on monocyte functional responses.

We determined that the intracellular level of HspBP1 decreased during the initial phase of heat shock or treatment with U73122 and simultaneously appeared in cell culture medium. To elucidate the mechanism of HspBP1 release from A431 cells, we studied changes in intracellular distribution of the protein. We demonstrated the presence of HspBP1 in granules located at the cell periphery both in heat-shocked and U73122-treated cells. The co-localization of HspBP1 with both Hsp70 and a marker of secretory granules, chromogranin A, in the granules provides evidence that HspBP1 and Hsp70 release are mediated by secretory-like granules. These data identify a secretory pathway by which HspBP1 can be released from carcinoma cells together with Hsp70. We also demonstrate that though e-HspBP1 has no effect on EGF receptor transactivation, the mixture of e-Hsp70 and e-HspBP1 amplified EGF receptor transactivation induced by exogenously added pure Hsp70.

Methods: Peripheral blood derived lympocytes and monocytes/monocyte-derived dendritic cells were cultured in standard conditions, in presence/absence of growth factors/cytokines, virtually alone and in coculture. We exposed various mononuclear cell populations to energy/ nutrient deprivation caused stress and/or to different therapeutic agents (low level laser irradiation, natural antioxidants) separately and/or in coculture. Cells were further cultured virtually alone and/or in coculture. Using appropriate molecular reporters, we followed up changes occurring in various cell populations survival/proliferation rates, and death-style choices by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Endochondral skeletal development begins with the formation of a cartilaginous template, where mesenchymal cells aggregate and increase in density prior to their overt differentiation into chondrocytes. A process of prechondrogenic condensation whereby mesenchymal cells aggregate occurs through cell migration and proliferation. However, the exact mechanism behind this aggregation has yet to be elucidated, although cell collision has been implicated. The protein modulation by protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent phosphorylation is critically involved in the regulation of migratory phenomena involving receptor-mediated adhesion, membrane protrusion, and the formation of discrete cell-matrix adhesion sites linked to a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Investigation of the potential involvement of PKC isoforms i n the control of cell motility as analyzed by a wound-healing assay showed that PKCd inhibition was correlated with suppressions of wing bud mesenchymal cell migration and integrin b1 expression in a densityindependent force. Perturbation of integrin b1 function using its functional blocking antibody suppressed the migration of wing bud mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, the phosphorylation levels of Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were decreased by PKCd inhibition. Wound-healing assay after either treatment of PP2, an inhibitor of Src family kinase, or electroporation of FAK specific siRNA, showed suppressed cell migration.

Methods: The role of the endogenous interaction of Cx43 with Cav-1, and possibly with Cav-2, was mainly investigated in rat epidermal keratinocytes (REKs). The Cx43/Cavs interaction was assessed using coimmunoprecipitation, colocalization, and Far Western assays. A mutational analysis was used to determine which portion of the Cx43 molecule is involved in its interaction with Cavs. The role of Cavs in regulating Cx43 was studied using both over-expression and RNAi knockdown approaches and gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) was measured by dye transfer assays. The presence of Cx43 in lipid rafts was determined by Triton X-100 fractionation and sucrose gradient centrifugation. Results: Cx43 coimmunoprecipitates and colocalizes with Cav-1 and Cav-2 in REKs. Our mutation and Far Western analyses revealed that the C-terminal tail of Cx43 is required for its association with Cavs and that the Cx43/Cav-1 interaction is direct. Our results indicate that newly synthesized Cx43 interacts with Cavs in the Golgi apparatus and that the Cx43/Cavs complex also exists at the plasma membrane in lipid rafts. We demonstrate that caveolins regulate GJIC and that the presence of Cx43 in rafts may contribute to the mechanism modulating GJIC.

Pappas Department of Genetics and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Athens, Athens, GREECE Introduction: Zymomonas mobilis is a bioethanol producing a-proteobacterium. Quorum sensing (QS) is directly related to high-cell density behavior of organisms and was thus investigated for Z. mobilis, as immediately relevant to its biotechnological nature. Methods: AHL quormone production in Z. mobilis CP4 was assayed using A. tumefaciens, C. violaceum and E. coli biosensors, by TLC and by HPLC/GC-MS (in collaboration with Dr A. Eberhard, Cornell University). Growth-dependent AHL production was tested by reporter strain Miller assays. AI-2 signal production was assayed by a V. harveyi lux sensor. Presence of QS-related genes in the Z. mobilis ZM4 genome was queried by in silico search for conserved-motif harbouring proteins and by BlastP-ing with 60 characterized QS-related proteins. Results: Z. mobilis does not likely engage in AI-2 signalling, as it failed to activate the relevant sensor, lacks a luxS homolog and possesses an SAH hydrolase homolog, indicating AI-2 precursor breakdown. Contrarily, Z. mobilis might produce AHL-type pheromones, since it activated agonistic sensors, inactivated antagonistic ones and tested positive for two putative AHLs in TLC experiments. HPLC/GC-MS supernatant extract analysis also revealed presence of 3-oxo-HSL species. Peak culture bioactivity was detected in early stationary phase and in rich medium growth, and was not affected by culture aeration.",

We concentrate on the formation of septate junctions (SJ), which sustain the permeability diffusion barriers, and are found among epithelial cells and among glial cells that enwrap the nervous system. As a handle to the genetic study of lipids in this context, we investigate the contribution of lipid metabolism genes to the process of SJ formation. Methods: We are screening mutants in sphingolipid, glycosphingolipid, and phospholipid metabolism genes using an established dye penetration assay, to probe the 'tightness' of the epithelial permeability barrier.

Introduction: Batten disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in Cln3. The yeast model for Batten disease revealed that the disruption of Cln3 function induced a limitation in nitric oxide (NO) production. We proposed that a similar alteration may also be present in cells from patients possibly contributing to neuronal dysfunction 1 . To further investigate this hypothesis, we studied the Cln3 ex7/8 knock-in mouse, which harbour the most common disease-causing CLN3 mutation. Methods: Behavioural phenotyping protocols were applied in developing pups and young adult mice to determine whether Cln3 ex7/8 knock-in mouse recapitulate the major clinical features of the disease. Subsequently, the in vivo kinetics of NO production in the brain of these animals was quantified by means of electrochemical microsensors. Results: We detected behaviour anomalies early in the development. Specifically, Cln3 ex7/8 pre-weaning pups show delayed acquisition of neuronal reflexes. Furthermore, young adult animals present decreased levels of exploratory activity and marked motor deficits as early as 8 weeks of age. We measured the concentration dynamics of endogenous NO production in selected brain regions in response to NMDA stimulation and, apparently, the results point to altered production. Methods: Cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C (5% CO 2 ) in RPMI1640. Proteins were identified by immunoblotting.",

This growth arrest is accompanied by proteolytic degradation of several proteins directly involved in lymphocyte functions such as c and h PKC isozymes together with talin and Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), all recognized as calpain substrates. In cells overexpressing calpastatin, the rate of proliferation during the first 7 days is 40-50% reduced, and then proliferation proceeds without the enter into the G 0 stage. After 15 days, the rate of cell accumulation was 30% reduced. This loss of growth arrest was accompanied by an almost complete protection of PKC, talin and FAK. The requirement of calpain digestion in the entry of cells into the G 0 stage was further supported by similar effects on both cell growth and proteolytic degradation obtained following cell exposure to a synthetic calpain inhibitor. Conclusion: These results provide a direct demonstration that activation of calpain is required to exit from cell cycle and to enter a G 0 stage. Thus a balanced calpain-calpastatin ratio is required for the maintenance of a normal rate of cell accumulation. All the large primates encounter numerous DNA and RNA viruses but rarely suffer from any serious illness. Viruses also interact with each other directly. Viruses from the same species sometimes compete with each other, causing one to eventually succeed in the host cell and block infection by others. Viruses from heterologous species, can co-infect cells cooperatively. Viruses also interact with each other directly. In recent years, it has become evident that HIV-1 infected individuals when co-infected with either Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), HHV-7 or Hepatitis GB-C (GBV-C) may live three times longer as compared to those without these co-infections. Recent studies have proposed the interesting perspective that viral gene expression is downregulated by host micro-RNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs well known as post-transcriptional gene silencer. Recently, we have shown an inverse correlation between the numbers and relative degree of homology of miRNAs to the relative replication capacity of a specific retroviruses and various lentiviruses. In order to evaluate that miRNA-based silencing may be involved in HHV-6, -7 and GBV-C co-infections in HIV-1 infected individuals we computationally analyzed the miRNAs that have significant homologies to both HIV-1 and the co-infecting viruses. We discovered that miRNAs with over 80% homology to various targets in HHV-6, -7 and GBV-C genomes also mutually target HIV-1. We postulate that mutually targeting miRNAs serve to inhibit HIV-1 replication in individuals co-infected with these viruses. These results also suggest that miRNAs extensively mediate antiviral defenses in humans.",

Despite their common occurrence and major effects on host biology, little is known on the molecular mechanisms that mediate Wolbachia-host interactions. The sequencing of the genomes of different Wolbachia strains (wMel, wRi) that infect insect hosts revealed an unusually large number of genes encoding proteins with ankyrin repeat domains. We are investigating the role of these proteins. Methods: The distribution of ankyrin genes in different Wolbachia strains was determined by PCR and Southern analysis. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was also performed on RNA extracts from different developmental stages and tissues. Selected ank-proteins were expressed transiently in insect cells as GFP chimeras and their subcellular localization was analysed by confocal microscopy. Introduction: The most distinctive feature of the dimorphic pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the multiple budding phenotype of its yeast form, a phenomenon that still remains unclear. This work focuses on the P. brasiliensis homolog to the Rho-like GTPase Cdc42p (Pbcdc42p), a protein implicated in the development of multiple buds in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its relevance in controlling cellular morphology and virulence. Methods: We have isolated PbCDC42, functionally complemented S. cerevisiae Dcdc42 cells, and evaluated cellular morphology and bud scar patterns. PbCDC42's expression was down-regulated in P. brasiliensis yeast cells using antisense-RNA (aRNA) and several parameters were evaluated: cell size, viability, and morphological transition. In vitro and in vivo assays were performed using either macrophages to analyze phagocytosis or C57BL/6 mice to compare the virulence of the wild-type and mutant strains upon intravenous infection. Results: Expression of PbCDC42's expression in S. cerevisiae Dcdc42 cells induced altered cellular morphology and deregulation of the temporal/spatial control of bud emergence. In P. brasiliensis, PbCDC42-aRNA cells were smaller with an increased homogeneity of cell size and viability. Moreover, transition from yeast-to-mycelia was delayed without alterations in mycelial growth. Regarding in vitro and in vivo infection, knock-down of PbCDC42 led to increased phagocytosis and survival. Conclusions: Overall, our data indicates that Pbcdc42p has an important role in controlling cellular morphology and seems to present itself as a relevant virulence factor, suggesting that P. brasiliensis wild-type morphology is important for pathogenesis. The etiological role of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) in preinvasive and invasive cervical cancer has been demonstrated by epidemiological and molecular studies. There is compelling evidence that during carcinogenesis viral oncogenes altered cell cycle progression. On the other hands, cell cycle depends on the sequential activation of a series of cyclins. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of three cyclins in swabs harvested from patients presenting cervical preneoplasic lesions. Methods: From a 268 cohort of HPV positive women, we selected 52 patients (24-48 years) with mild and severe dysplasia and presenting only HPV16 type (in InnoLipa) and eight patients without HPV infection and normal cytology were used as negative control. The liquidbased cervical specimens of the selected patients were subjected to immunocytochemical and molecular techniques for cyclin A, D and E expression and for viral E6/E7oncogene mRNA expression. Results: Marked cyclin D1 immunoreactivity was found in 16% of HGSIL cases as compared with LGSIL lesions (9%) while cyclin E immunoreactivity presented a significant increase from normal to HGSIL lesions. Increased cyclin E expression induces a proliferative effect and might be correlated to progression through the cell cycle. Cyclin A expression was also increasing with the lesions' severity but also with the viral mRNAs levels.",

The rapid multiplication of P. falciparum within human erythrocytes is directly associated with its pathogenesis. We have identified a new metabolic pathway (SDPM) in P. falciparum that links hemoglobin catabolism and amino acid transport to membrane biogenesis and parasite cellularization 1-6 .

In addition to the phosphocholine analog miltefosine, two new compounds amodiaquin and hexadecyltrimethylammonium known for their antimalarial activity were found to inhibit PfPMT activity. The trophoblastic cell represents the main functional unit of the placenta. It proliferates, migrates, and invades the maternal tissue in a way that is similar to malignant tumors. Nevertheless, these processes are tightly controlled by stringent spatial and temporal confines. Therefore, the trophoblastic cell, as 'a well-behaved tumor', represents an ideal model system to investigate several cellular processes. Infection with genital human papillomaviruses (HPV) represents the most common sexual transmitted infection in fertile women. HPV are small circular double stranded DNA viruses, which comprise open reading frames gathered in a regulatory early (E) and structural late (L) regions. Infection with HPV-16 is the necessary cause of over 99% of human cervical cancers. However, several studies report that HPV viruses could infect trophoblasts during pregnancies. Surprisingly, HPV can replicate in vitro in trophoblasts. Higher HPV infection frequency has been reported to be associated with some spontaneous abortion and gestational trophoblastic diseases. In this report, we have studied the impacts of HPV-16 early proteins on the growth, cytotoxicity, adhesiveness, differentiation and migration of trophoblastic cells. Our results showed that hydrophobic E5 protein is localized in many interne membranes compartments of the trophoblast. E5 could increase cell growth, meanwhile, it seemed cytotoxic. However, the presence of E5, E6 and E7 could reverse the cytotoxic effects of E5. In addition, E5 decreased the ability of the trophoblastic cells to attach to the support and to the endometrial cells. These observations suggest that E5 could modify the adhesiveness of the trophoblastic cells. Introduction: Phosphothreonine lyases are a recently described class of enzyme that use an elimination reaction to cleave phosphate from phosphothreonine of the pThr-X-pTyr motif of MAP kinases such as ERK1/2, p38 and JNK, leading to a dehydrobutyrine (Dhb) residue. Therefore, the post-translational modification that results from phosphothreonine lyase activity, unlike phosphatase activity, does not allow rephosphorylation on the same residue. Several pathogenic bacteria, including Salmonella and Shigella, inject phosphothreonine lyases into the host cell through a type III secretion system. This disrupts immune system signaling and allows bacterial virulence. Results: A 1.4 \u00c5 structure of the Chromobacterium violaceum VirA phosphothreonine lyase was determined by X-ray crystallography using a selenomethionine derivative by MAD (Multiwavelength Anomalous Diffraction). It adopts a fold that is similar to the recently published Salmonella SpvC structures. The VirA phosphothreonine lyase is catalytically activity against phosphorylated ERK2 protein and phosphopeptide as demonstrated by both western blot and phosphate release assay. Conclusion: A phospho-mimetic sulphate reveals the active site. Lys136 is positioned to act as a catalytic base in the b-elimination reaction. A catalytic diad of Asp201 and His106, would act as a general acid to protonate the leaving phosphate. Catalytically active VirA is consistent with a functional Chromobacterium violaceum type III secretion system. The lack of Arg90 suggests that VirA, unlike SpvC, may not be specific for dual phosphorylated MAPK. Results: Soil application of R. solani alone and B. licheniformis in combination with R. solani induced a significant increase in the activities of b-1,3-glucanase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). Peroxidase activity in both fungal and bacterial treatments was also significantly stimulated. In contrast, peroxidase activity was reduced upon inoculation of plants with a mixture of B. licheniformis-R. solani. Conclusions: Results indicated that generally transcripts of defencerelated genes as well as some enzymatic activities were induced in all treatments, including that with Bacillus spp. alone.",

Kakkanas 1 , E. Aslanoglou 1 , D. Vassilopoulos 2 , S. Hadziyiannis 2 and P. Mavromara 1 1 Molecular Virology Laboratory, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, GREECE, 2 Academic Department of Internal Medicine, Hippocration General Hospital Athens, Athens, GREECE Introduction: The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of acute and chronic liver diseases which frequently lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The viral genome possesses a reading frame overlapping the core gene at +1 nucleotide (core+1 ORF) that recently was reported to be translated by alternative mechanisms into proteins designated core+1/ARFP/F. Converging data from several laboratories support that the core+1 ORF stimulates specific B-cell and T-cell immune responses in HCV-infected patients, suggesting that it is expressed during natural infection. The aim of this study is to characterize the prevalence of circulating antibodies against core+1 protein in HCV infected patients during different stages of disease. Methods: The HCV core+1 ORF of genotypes 1a and 1b, were cloned and expressed in pET 20(+) prokaryotic expression vector, which allows fusion of a foreign protein with a 6X His cassette at the carboxy-terminus. Also, peptides corresponding to different regions of the core+1 protein were synthesized. Both purified recombinant proteins and peptides were used for the development of home-made enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results-Conclusion: Firstly a sera panel of patients with HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sera from healthy individuals were used as negative control. Our results demonstrate a statistically important higher prevalence of anti-core+1 antibodies in sera from HCV-HCC patients as compared to chronically infected HCV patients suggesting a role of core+1 in advanced liver disease and cancer. Methods: To clarify the role of HuR in innate responses we generated a system for its innate ablation based on gene-targeting and Cre/loxP mediated recombination. Using this system we study: (a) HuR dependent in vivo cellular responses in myeloid ontogeny, (b) responses to innate sensitizers in vivo and (c) gene expression assays in ex-vivo cultures. Results: We demonstrate that mutant animals show partial defects in myelopoiesis due to defects in CSF-signals driving myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HuR deficient macrophages display exacerbated cytokine production profiles in response to TLR ligands relating to altered translational outputs. Similarly, mutant mice appear more sensitive to models of systemic and organ specific acute inflammatory assault. In addition, we reveal interfere with the SAPKmediated intracellular pathways modulating cytokine biosynthesis. Currently, we are analysing the potential interplays between HuR and other ARE-binding proteins of relevance to innate activation. Conclusion: Our data suggest that HuR acts in a complex yet tissue specific fashion to modulate differentiation signals and inflammatory gene expression towards myelopoiesis and inflammation. Dermatophytes are a group of morphologically and physiologically similar filamentous fungi that have the capacity of invading keratinized human and animal tissues. Cysteine proteinases are widespread in nature and have different physiologic functions. Their activity is regulated by different mechanisms of which protein inhibitors are of great importance. To our knowledge, no protein protease inhibitor from dermatophyte fungy has been reported so far. The inhibitor was isolated from mechanically and ultrasonically disintegrated fungal mycelia using the affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography and reverse phase HPLC. The isolated inhibitor was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The inhibitory properties against different proteinases have been determined. The enzymatically prepared peptide fragments were separated by HPLC and sequenced, using automated Edman degradation method. The obtained sequences were compared to non-redundant protein sequence databases using blastp algorithm at NCBI. It has been proven that the isolated protein inhibits proteolytic activity of papain, cathepsin B, but not cathepsin H. SDS-PAGE analysis of inhibitor preparation showed bands at 12, 24 and 48 kDa, suggesting multimeric composition of the protein. So far no sequence homology has been found between the partial protein sequence of T. mentagrophytes inhibitor and any known cysteine protease inhibitor, implying its structural uniqueness.",

Lee School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, REPUBLIC OF KOREA Pleurocidin (Ple) is a 25-residue peptide derived from the skin mucous secretion of the winter flounder, Pleuronectes americanus. In this study, we investigated antimicrobial properties of Ple and its enantiomers. Ple showed potent antimicrobial activities by disrupting membranes without high hemolysis. To develop this peptide as novel therapeutic agents, we designed analogs of which a net hydrophobicity was decreased. The analogs were synthesized by arginine or serine substitution at positions 1, 3, 12, 19 or 21 at the hydrophobic face of Ple without changing its amphipathic structure. The result exhibited that the analogs maintained antimicrobial activities and abilities for permeabilizing phospholipids membranes without hemolysis. In succession we designed a synthetic enantiomeric peptide composed of all-D-amino acids to enhance a proteolytic resistance. The proteolytic resistance was confirmed by HPLC with the digestion of proteases. To investigate the antibiotic effect of L-and D-Ple, an antibacterial activity and hemolytic effect were tested. D-Ple showed a decreased antibacterial activity and a dramatically decreased hemolytic activity compared with L-Ple. The hemolytic effect of analog was further confirmed by using calcein leakage measurement with liposome. To elucidate these results, the secondary structure of the peptides was investigated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The results revealed that D-Ple, as well as L-Ple, had typical alpha helical structures which were mirror images, with a different helicity. These results suggested that the discrepancy of the structure between the two peptides made their antibacterial activity distinct. Rev is a small regulatory protein of HIV-1 essential for virus replication. Above all, Rev (35-50) is known for a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and requisite for shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the host cell. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial effects of Rev-NLS toward apoptosis of fungal cells and suggested the possibility as a therapeutic agent by synthesizing D-Rev-NLS. First of all, Rev-NLS had potent antimicrobial activities in energy-and saltindependent manners without hemolytic effect and accumulated in the nucleus of C. albicans without membrane damage after binding to microbial cell wall. Also we found out that Rev-NLS influenced on the cell cycle arrest at S phase as a result that it bound to chromosomal DNA. The result of fluorescence study indicated that tryptophan is the key for interacting with cell membrane to penetrate into the nucleus. Subsequently we investigated phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation caused by apoptosis followed above results. The result exhibited that Rev-NLS induced an early apoptosis of C. albicans. Finally to aim for which was the application of therapeutic agents, we designed a synthetic enantiomeric analog peptide composed of all-D-amino acids to enhance a resistance to proteases. D-Rev-NLS displayed 2-fold more potent antimicrobial activity than that of L-Rev-NLS, and it also showed a proteolytic resistance against various proteases.",

We describe herein, the effect of CagA phosphorylation on focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Pyk2 activation following infection of gastric epithelial cells with Hp clinical strains isolated from gastric biopsies. Methods: CagA, FAK, Pyk2 expression was detected in total lysates of AGS cells infected over 36 hours with pairs of naturally occurring isogenic Hp strains expressing CagA protein with two or three EPIYA motifs (AB-ABC), three or five (ABC-ABCCC) and two pairs with three or four motifs (ABC-ABCC). Tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were detected by western blotting following immunoprecipitation with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. Levels of activated pFAK were also evaluated by a specific antibody against pTyr397-FAK autophosphorylation site. Results: Following Hp infection of AGS cells in vitro, we observed that CagA species harbouring more EPIYA-C motifs exhibited higher levels and rates of tyrosine phosphorylation. Infection with all Hp strains induced higher levels of Y-397 FAK dephosphorylation with total phosphotyrosine levels of FAK remaining unaffected. Concomitantly, upon Hp infection we observed a time-dependent increase in phosphotyrosine Pyk2 levels and an increased rate of Pyk2 degradation products. Conclusions: Hp infection during its initial stages seems to deregulate signalling events linked to the integrin pathway, such as FAK activation. We have observed that CagA EPIYA-C time-dependent phosphorylation is accompanied by reduced pY397-FAK autophosphorylation and concomitant increase in Pyk2 activation, probably due to reduced FAK activation.",

Mavromara Molecular Virology Laboratory, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, GREECE Introduction: Worldwide, about 300 million individuals are infected by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and three quarters are suffering from persistent HCV infection, often leading to development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the mechanism underlying this process is still unclear. HCV is a positive strand RNA virus within the Flaviviridae family, its genome spanning approximately 9600 nucleotides and encodes a single polyprotein of about 3thinsp;000 amino acids, processed via host cell and viral proteases into at least 10 structural and non-structural proteins. Recent studies from our laboratory and others have accumulated strong evidence for the existence of a novel protein of hepatitis C virus encoded by an ORF overlapping the core gene in the +1 frame (core+1 ORF). However, today the biological importance of this protein remains unknown. Methods: In this study, we examined the effect of core+1/S on chimeric (EalbpAT-1a, EIIpAT-1a) and non-chimeric (pAlb, pAT-1a) human liver specific promoters, given that both proteins, albumin and anti-trypsin, are produced exclusively in the liver and chronic liver disease results to a significant decrease in their expression levels. CMV promoter was used as control. Series of transient co-transfections using the annotated constructs, along with HCV core and HCV core+1 expressing constructs, were carried out into cultured cells of hepatic and non-hepatic origin. Results and conclusions: The presence of core+1/S exhibited a significant reduction in the levels of expression of the luciferase reporter gene, under EalbpAT-1a, EIIpAT-1a, pAT-1a and pAlb promoters, suggesting a putative direct, or indirect interaction of core+1/S with one, or more transcription factors associated with the albumin and anti-trypsin promoters. Results: Regarding the cytological diagnosis, HPV was detected in 75.5% from normal/inflammatory samples, in 87.5% ASCUS, 70.37% LSIL and 90.9% HSIL, which demonstrated that HPV infections are frequent. We noted that the predominant genotypes in patients were HPV16 (56%) in association with other high risk (HPV18, 51, 31). P16 immunoreactivity was markedly noted in all integrated form (38/52 HPV16 cases) LSIL or HSIL but only in two cases presenting ASCUS/ inflammatory cytology. P16 mRNA levels correlates with protein expression determined on cells isolated from swabs. Conclusions: Integration of human papillomavirus DNA into the host genome is mainly found in high-grade dysplastic lesions and points to an increased progression potential. Significant pl6 overexpression was observed in the HSIL group, over-expression of p16 acting as potential biomarker for cervical cancer progression from premalign lesions.",

Methods: Cucumber seeds were sterilized by exposure to 1% sodium hypocloride. Seeds were immersed for 12 hours in bacterial cultures of Bacillus licheniformis, strains B40, mB40, tB40 and Pseudomonas spp strains P7, P14, P18. Subsequently, seeds were germinated and grown in sterile conditions. Five days after the infection of seedlings with mycelium of Pythium debaryanum, the treated plants were harvested for total protein extraction. Enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX), catalase (CAT), total proteins and electrophoretic patterns of the isoenzymes were performed. Results: Both bacterial and fungal exposure induced an increase of SOD activity. Electrophoretic pattern does not emphasize changes in SOD isoforms. POX activity increases in all experimental pathogen infected trials. P14 and P18 colonization presented a similar effect on POX as fungal pathogen. Pathogen and bacteria induced changes in the peroxidase isoforms expression. Fungal infection determined a mild increase of CAT, although in P7 colonized plants CAT presented a higher activity and different isoforms. Conclusions: Plants colonization with beneficial bacterial strains induced in the first stage changes of the antioxidant system similar to those produced by fungal attack, and allowed a good protection against plant fungal pathogens. Methods: Five lectin preparations obtained by affinity chromatography interacted with liquid cultures of Salmonella typhymurium. The positive results of interaction were evaluated by the degree of bacteria agglutination. The most effective lectin was that isolated from potato shoots. Animal experiment consisted in four trials: control, lectin treated but not infected, infected with Salmonella, infected and lectin treated.

Here, we show that these lectins also play an important role in mosquito immunity against bacteria. Methods and Results: Functional genetic analysis of CTL4 and CTLMA2 was performed using in vivo RNAi. Adult mosquitoes silenced for CTL4 or CTLMA2 were more susceptible to infections by Escherichia coli but not Staphylococcus aureus. These mosquitoes exhibited a dramatic proliferation of E. coli relative to wild-type controls suggesting indeed a role for these lectins in controlling proliferation of gram-negative bacteria. Western blot analysis revealed that CTL4 and CTLMA2 are secreted into the mosquito's hemolymph and exist predominantly as a heterodimer. Interestingly, silencing either lectin triggered the loss of the other protein from the hemolymph, although no cross-silencing was observed at the mRNA level, suggesting the involvement of a potential post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism.",

Although orf6 appears not to belong to the hrp-regulon, its location suggested a possible role in pathogenesis. We examined the ability of orf6 to elicit the plant hypersensitive response (HR) and annotated bioinformatically its putative homologues in Pseudomonas. Introduction: A major goal in plant science is the production of crops with increased and durable resistance to a wide spectrum of diseases. Engineering resistance for agricultural improvement incorporates diverse strategies to mitigate the crop losses imposed by pathogens. A promising approach to engineering disease resistance is to express a pathogen component in the plant that the plant can recognize. Recognition of these elicitor molecules then leads to the activation of a full defense response that is sufficient to restrict pathogen growth. Methods: Transgenic Arabidopsis plants were inoculated 3 hours after induction with b-estradiol. Bacterial multiplication in leaves was examined by cutting tissue from the inoculation sites, homogenization in 10 mM MgCl 2 and serial dilutions of the homogenate. Interacting Arabidopsis proteins were identified using as bait the HrpA protein in a yeast two hybrid screen against an Arabidopsis library. Results: Use of the gene encoding the Hrp pilus subunit from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000, as a transgene in Arabidopsis thaliana, showed elevated levels of resistance towards the bacterial speck disease, indicating that the signal transduction pathway leading to the expression of disease had been altered.

In the route to D-arabinofuranose, the decaprenyl-phospho-ribose 2\u00a2-epimerase converts decaprenyl-phospho-ribose to decaprenyl-phosphoarabinose which is a substrate for arabinosyltransferases in the synthesis of the cell-wall arabinogalactan and (lipo)arabinomannan polysaccharides of mycobacteria.",

D-ribose 5phosphate is a substrate for the Rv1017 phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase which forms 5-phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). The activated 5-phosphoribofuranosyl residue of PRPP is transferred by the Rv3806 5-phosphoribosyltransferase to decaprenyl phosphate, thus forming 5'-phosphoribosyl-monophospho-decaprenol. The dephosphorylation of 5'-phosphoribosyl-monophospho-decaprenol to decaprenyl-P-ribose by the putative Rv3807 phospholipid phosphatase is proposed to be the committed step of the pathway. A subsequent 2'-epimerization of decaprenyl-P-ribose by the heteromeric Rv3790/Rv3791 2'-epimerase leads to the formation of the decaprenyl-P-arabinose precursor for the synthesis of the cell-wall arabinans in Actinomycetales. The mycobacterial 2'-epimerase Rv3790 subunit is similar to the fungal D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase, the last enzyme in the biosynthesis of D-erythroascorbic acid, thus pointing to evolutionary links between the D-arabinofuranose and L-ascorbic acid-related pathways.",

Both pathways are activated via redox-dependent mechanism associated with tyrosine kinase/phospholipase C-1c-mediated activation of protein kinase C a/b that activates NADPH oxidase and therefore production of reactive oxygen species that activate both HIF-1a and ASK1. TLR4-dependent activation of PI3-kinase and direct S-nitrosation were found to downregulate ASK1 during TLR4 downstream signalling protecting the cells against LPSinduced, ASK1-mediated apoptosis. ASK1 contributes to stabilisation of HIF-1a protein via activation of p38 MAP kinase that directly phosphorylates HIF-1a. Knockdown of HIF-1a in THP-1 cells with siRNA suggested that this protein is critical for regulation of energy metabolism and protection of LPS-stimulated cells against ASK1induced programmed death. Furthermore, HIF-1a protein supports TLR4-dependent IL-6 production by protecting the cells against depletion of ATP. Cephalosporin C (CPC) is produced by the fungus Chephalosporium acremonium. Semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotics are industrially synthetized from 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-aca) obtained by chemical deacylation of CPC. However, this process implies several expensive steps and treatment of toxic wastes. Therefore great efforts have been made to find a bioprocess, converting CPC in 7-aca. The enzyme cephalosporin acylase (CA) catalyzes the conversion of CPC in 7-aca. Indeed several CAs isolated from genus Pseudomonas and Bacillus use glutaryl-7-aca as primary substrate and have low specificity for CPC. Thermophiles are microorganism adapted to survive at high temperature. Enzymes isolated from these sources represent useful tools for industry because of the higher stability respect to their mesophilic counterparts. Here we report the cloning, purification and characterization of an enzyme belonging to the CA family isolated from the thermophilic eubacterium Geobacillus thermodenitrificans. Genome sequence of G. thermodenitrificans has recently become available. Cell extracts of the eubacterium showed CPC bioconversion evaluated by HPLC analysis. A gene annotated as CA was amplified by PCR, inserted in pET-28b and transformed in BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain. The protein containing an His-tag was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography. The amino acid sequence showed 30-40% of identity with proteins of CA family. Analyses in SDS-PAGE showed three protein bands of 60, 20 and 40 kDa, likely corresponding to the precursor polypeptide, the a and b subunits, respectively. Biochemical characterization of CA from G. thermodenitrificans could provide new insight in the substrate specificity of the enzyme and improve the production of antibiotics. Introduction: Like multicellular organisms, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can undergo programmed cell death (PCD) induced by different environmental stress. By using an experimental system in which yeast PCD is induced by acetic acid (AA-PCD), we investigated both cell survival and a variety of processes occurring en route to death, including: production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and its regulation, the involvement of proteasome and metacaspase YCA1, cytochrome c release. Methods: AA-PCD was induced in exponential yeast cells. Catalase (CAT) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) was over-expressed in yeast cells and YCA1 gene-knock out strain was constructed. ROS formation, enzyme activities and cytochrome c release were assayed by fluorescence microscopy, spectrophotometric and immunoblotting analysis.",

Conclusion: The picture emerging from these results is as follows: early H 2 O 2 production occurs in AA-PCD in a manner modulated by CAT and SOD. Proteasome is transiently activated starting 60 minutes after PCD induction. Release of cytochrome c occurs starting at 60 minutes of AA-PCD and is complete at 150 minutes. YCA1 participates in AA-PCD also in a manner unrelated to its caspase-like activity. Introduction: Aquatic hyphomycetes generally dominate leaf decomposition in unpolluted habitats. Surprisingly, an amazing diversity was found in high polluted waters of former industrial sites in Central Germany [1] . Some isolated strains have evolved biochemical adaptations. Methods: Using integrated methods for separation and structural analysis the thiol peptide levels and the structure and metal binding capacity of a novel metallothionein were elucidated. Biotransformation reactions of organic pollutants were assessed with fungal cultures and isolated enzymes, using mass-spectrometric analysis.",

Amylases are enzymes which hydrolyse starch molecules to give diverse products including dextrins and progressively smaller polymers composed of glucose units. Recent research with thermostable a-amylase has concentrated on the enzymes of thermophiles and extreme thermophiles and little is known about the properties of the enzymes produced by these organisms. These enzymes are used in the textile and paper industries, in starch liquefaction, as a food adhesive, and in sugar production. Materials and Methods: In this study, mud samples were collected from Davutlu Hot Springs (Diyadin/Ag\u02d8r\u0131). Biochemical and 16S rRNA analyses of thermostable bacteria were conducted and these bacteria were found to be a strain of Bacillus licheniformis. Their ability to produce a-amylase of industrial importance was studied in two different basal media (BM1 and BM2) containing different concentrations (0.5-3%) of various starches (soluble, corn, potato and wheat). The optimum pH and temperature for enzyme activity and enzyme production time for this enzyme are 7.0, 70\u00b0C and 24 hours, respectively. The enzyme activity was determined by Bernfeld method. Results: The gram positive, spore-forming, motile moderately thermophilic bacteria was found to be a strain of Bacillus licheniformis analysed by 16S rRNA comparison. It was found that the a-amylase activity in B.licheniformis grown on BM1 and BM2 without starches were 57 l/mg and 107 l/mg, respectively. The enzyme production in BM1 was increased by addition of soluble starch up to 2% (125 l/mg), while a slight increase was obtained at 1% of potato starch (82 l/mg). However, there was a great increase in BM2 containing both potato starch and soluble starch. The enzyme activity in BM2 with 2% soluble starch was 337 l/mg, while it was 435 l/mg that with 1% potato starch. Both corn and wheat starches at different concentrations tested did not have an effect on the enzyme production.",

In extreme environment, some bacteria can form spores which are metabolically dormant and can survive million of years [1] . Usual food preservation treatments can inactivate spores, but strongly reduce organoleptic qualities. Emerging technologies like high hydrostatic pressure allow better preservation of organoleptic qualities but fail to completely inactivate spores [2] . A better comprehension of spore resistance mechanisms is needed to optimize these processes. When spores were placed in environment at different water activities, they did not have the same heat resistance [3] . These tests were done with spores grown in optimum conditions (water activity 0.993) which seldom happen in nature. In this work we studied the influence of the water activity of sporulation medium on spore resistance, in relation with core water activity. Sporulation was initiated at water activity levels ranging from 0.950 to 0.993, using different depressor solutes (NaCl or glycerol). Spore resistance was tested by heating at 97\u00b0C during 60 minutes and by pressurising from 150 MPa to 550 MPa. Compared to spores grown in optimum conditions, spores grown at lower water activity were smaller, much more heat sensitive, and had the same high pressure resistance. These spores could germinate at lower water activity level, which suggests a lower core water activity. Such modifications in the water activity level of the sporulation medium could influence core water activity and clarify the relation between core water activity and spore heat resistance. Introduction: The universal cellular stress response (CSR) is modulated, amongst others, by heat, anticancer agents and hormones. Thyroxine (T 4 ) has been shown to confer resistance to a subsequent potentially lethal insult in yeast, while doxorubicin (DOX) is known to decrease cell survival. Considering the homeostatic character of hormones, this study aimed to explore the role of T 4 in yeast survival during the CSR upon treatment with the anticancer agent DOX. Methods: The CSR was evaluated by determining microscopically the viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae after heat shock (HS, 53\u00b0C, 30 minutes). The effect of long-term (27\u00b0C, 24 hours) treatment with 0.1 mM T 4 on cell survival upon long-or short-term (2 hours prior to HS) administration of 0.01-0.09 mM DOX was investigated (n = 3-10). Statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA and non-parametric tests. Control cultures in the absence of any agent were included in all experiments. Results: Long-term DOX administration decreased dose-dependently (p < 0.05) both cell number and viability before and after HS, shortterm treatment showing no effect. T 4 induced no alterations in growth and viability before HS (p > 0.05). However, the presence of T 4 significantly increased viability after HS upon long-or short-term DOX administration (p < 0.05). Interestingly, T 4 reversed considerably the extent of dead cell aggregates and the morphological alterations observed upon plating the cultures exposed to DOX alone. Conclusions: The protective action of T 4 against DOX toxicity in this eukaryotic experimental model provides the lead for the investigation of the interactions between hormones and anticancer agents under stress conditions and their potential implications in cancer chemotherapy.",

Bacteria are present as single cells or multicell colonies and often strongly adsorb onto mineral surfaces such as sand and clay. The interactions of microbes and microbial biomolecules with these minerals have profound impacts on the physical, chemical and biological properties of soils. Method: Microbes were cultivated from a clay-loam soil from Teagasc, Ireland, and the microbial titre determined. Microbial proteins were isolated and the concentration evaluated using the Bradford assay. Quantified microbes and proteins were sorbed to montmorillonite and kaolinite and their equilibrium adsorption determined (initial concentration -equilibrium supernatant). Clay mineral-complexes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Results: Montmorillonite and Kaolinite adsorbed 3.71x10 10 and 3.33x10 10 cells/g, respectively. Equilibrium adsorption of proteins onto montmorillonite and kaolinite was determined at 920 mg/g and 728 mg/g, respectively. XRD showed that microbes and proteins intercalated the interlamellar region of montmorillonite resulting in montmorillonite-microbial and montmorillonite-protein complexes with 001 d-spacing increases of 1.5 and 1.6 nm, respectively. SEM indicated that microbes and proteins also adsorption on montmorillonite surfaces. XRD spectra confirmed that microbes and proteins did not penetrate kaolinite, indicating that adsorption occurred primarily on external surfaces, as also suggested by SEM. FT-IR spectra were indicative of montmorillonite-microbial and -protein, and kaolinite-microbial andprotein complexes. Conclusions: Montmorillonite indicated a greater affinity for soil microbes and soil microbial proteins when compared with kaolinite.",

Yokthongwattana Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, THAILAND Understanding the molecular mechanisms how microalgae adapt to short-term and long-term irradiance-stress conditions may broaden our knowledge of how plants counteract with excess light energy and maintain their photosynthetic productivity. Regardless of extensive research on physiological responses of plant to strong irradiance, many issues have not been fully addressed. For example, even though zeaxanthin (Z) is believed to play a photoprotective role via dissipation of excessive light energy as heat and prevent oxidative damage, its exact functions have not been clarified. Constitutive accumulation of Z in the zea1 strain, a mutant of Dunaliella salina, does not affect the rate of photodamage of the photosynthetic apparatus from photoinhibition compared to wild type whereas Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, npq1, resists to high light. From chlorophyll fluorescence measurement in presence of inhibitor, nigericin, we found that photoinhibition quenching was the predominant nonphotochemical energy dissipation process in Dunaliella salina wild type and a mutant constitutively accumulating zeaxanthin (zea1). However upon expose to high light zea1 has higher qE than wild type. Our data also show that growth rate of mutant is lower than wild type when grown under a photon flux density of 150l mol/m 2 /s whereas when grown under lower photon flux density (30 lmol/m 2 /s) data show no difference in rate of growth. The difference in growth rate may be come from quenching by Z in mutant. A major regulatory mechanism evolved by microorganisms to combat stress is the regulation mediated by (p) ppGpp (the stringent response molecule), metabolised by Rel proteins. These are divided into bifunctional and monofunctional proteins based on the presence or absence of the hydrolysis activity. While these proteins require Mg 2+ for (p) ppGpp synthesis, high Mg 2+ was shown to inhibit this reaction in bifunctional Rel proteins from M. tuberculosis and S. equisimilis. This is not a characteristic feature in enzymes that use a dual-metal-ion mechanism, like DNA polymerases that are known to carry out a similar pyrophosphate transfer reaction. Comparison of polymerase Polb and Rel Seq structures that share a common fold, led to the proposal that the latter would follow a single-metal-ion mechanism. Surprisingly, in contrast to bifunctional Rel, we did not find inhibition of pppGpp synthesis at higher Mg 2+ in the monofunctional RelA from E.coli. We show that a charge reversal in a conserved motif in the synthesis domains explains this contrast; an RxKD motif in the bifunctional proteins is reversed to an ExDD motif. The differential response of these proteins to Mg 2+ could also be noticed in fluorescent nucleotide binding and circular dichroism experiments. In mutants where the motifs were reversed, the differential effect could also be reversed. We infer that although a catalytic Mg 2+ is common to both bifunctional and monofunctional proteins, the latter would utilize an additional metal binding site formed by ExDD. This work, for the first time, brings out differences in (p) ppGpp synthesis by the two classes of Rel proteins. ",

Stress response can be modulated by a number of pharmacologically active agents, including the antioxidant compounds N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSSG). Since in real life organisms are exposed to several antioxidants simultaneously, there is growing interest in the influence of antioxidants interactions on cell growth and survival. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of NAC and GSSG coadministration on the oxidative stress response in the unicellular eukaryotic organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Conclusion: NAC or GSSG, when administered alone, protected yeast cells from oxidative stress, while upon co-administration they failed to exert their protective action, possibly by antagonizing each other at the particular doses. Introduction: Oxygen supply is essential for survival of the chytridiomycete Blastocladiella emersonii. However, because of its saprophytic lifestyle, this fungus seems to be adapted to low aerated environments and thus can be an interestingly model of study the hypoxic stress response. In addition, comparison between hypoxia and other stresses such as cadmium exposure and heat shock may shed light on how this organism responds to extreme environments. Methods: In order to gain insight into the transcriptional program that directs the physiological and metabolic alterations to endure hypoxia stress, we analyzed the expression profile of about 3,773 genes in B. emersonii cells exposed to different concentrations of dissolved oxygen using cDNA microarrays and qRT-PCR. Results: We found that B. emersonii cells respond to oxygen deprivation mainly by altering the expression of genes required for energy production and consumption in an effort to maintain ATP levels by increasing anaerobic carbon metabolism and decreasing energy-consuming processes. The comparison of these microarray data with cadmium exposure and heat shock data recently obtained in our laboratory showed that these kinds of stresses share some similar transcriptional responses indicating that despite acting through different mechanisms, they may trigger similar adaptative and protective responses.",

Our study reveals crucial differences and similarities between hypoxia, cadmium and heat shock stress responses. Metallo-b-lactamases (MBLs) are considered an emerging family of Zn 2+ -dependent enzymes that significantly contribute to the resistance of many nosocomial pathogens against b-lactam antimicrobials. Since these plasmid-encoded enzymes constitute specific molecular targets for b-lactams, their exact mode of action is of great importance for deploying efficient anti-infective treatments and for the control of severe multi-resistant nosocomial infections, which becomes a global problem. A novel hybrid VIM-1/VIM-2-type b-lactamase (named VIM-12), has been recently identified in a clinical isolate of K. pneumoniae in Greece. This enzyme exhibits high sequence similarity with VIM-1 at its Nterminal region and with VIM-2 at its C-terminal region raising the question whether this sequence similarity reflects also in a similar functional role. Moreover, the possible contribution of this novel b-lactamase to the overall antibiotic resistance of this specific clinical isolate was investigated. The gene coding for VIM-12 was cloned and expressed and the recombinant enzyme was used for detailed kinetic analysis, using a variety of b-lactam antibiotics. VIM-12 was found to exhibit narrow substrate specificity, compared to other known b-lactamases, limited mainly to penicillin and to a much lesser extent to imipenen. Interestingly, meropenem was found to act as non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, although the active site of VIM-12 showed complete conservation of residues among VIM enzymes. We conclude that VIM-12 represents a novel and unique member among the known metallo-b-lactamases, exhibiting atypical substrate specificity.

The vast majority (60-80%) of bacterial species within the human GI are refractory to cultivation and to access plasmids that comprise this fraction of the community a novel culture independent method of plasmid capture was applied; TRACA (Transposon Aided Capture). Methods: The TRACA method was applied to faecal samples from different individuals and a PCR based screen of resultant TRACA plasmids was used to A) assess the diversity of Tetracycline genes from GI plasmids and B) determine the congruency of results for Tetracycline resistant genes found from PCR screens of the faecal metagenome compared to the mobile metagenome. Introduction: The presence of tellurite resistance genes has been reported in relatively wide spectrum of human pathogens, despite the fact that tellurium, as well as its soluble salts are both rare in the environment and are no longer in use as antimicrobial agents in treating numerous human disease. A driving force to intensify our studies on ter locus has been the discovery of its presence in the food-borne hemorrhagic pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7. We have studied the previously sequenced and described ter operon found on a large conjugative plasmid pTE53 which was originally isolated from uropathogenic strain Escherichia coli KL53.

Introduction: In industrial yeast bioprocesses, yeast cells frequently encounter osmotic stress. Cellular response to hyperosmolarity in bakers' yeast as a model organism has attracted attention since principles of osmoadaptation are conserved across eukaryotes.

Individual mutants were selected randomly from the final mutant population of sorbitol stress, which have resisted significantly higher osmotic stress levels than the minimum inhibitory sorbitol concentration of the wild type strain. Results: Mutant population was exposed to osmotic (sorbitol) stress starting from 1M to 3.4M sorbitol concentration.

In Dictyostelium discoideum glutathione is required for growth and development. Disruption of gcsA encoding cglutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS), an essential enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis, resulted in glutathione auxotrophy and failed to develop. Methods: Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was measured by using 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) and detected by a fluorescence spectrophotometer. And concentration of intracellular methylglyoxal was analyzed by quantification of quinoxaline, the derivative of methylglyoxal, with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: The transcriptional expression of gcsA was induced as aggregation progressed. To investigate roles of glutathione in development of D. discoideum, Cellular ROS level was measured. In KAx3 cells, cellular ROS level was increased as soon as the nutrition exhausted but in a short time the level was decreased. The cellular ROS level of GCSnull mutants was higher and sustained longer than KAx3 cells. And interestingly as D. discoideum started to develop, the concentration of intracellular methylglyoxal was decreased in both KAx3 and GCS-null cells. While the level of methylglyoxal in KAx3 cells decreased gradually, the level of methylglyoxal in GCS-null mutants increased. Conclusions: According to the above results we hypothesized that there might be correlations between intracellular ROS, methylglyoxal and glutathione during early development of D. discoideum. The study of ROS and methylglyoxal in GCS-null mutants could help to understand the transition from growth to development in D. discoideum.",

Discussion: Functional genomic analysis of Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2 has provided significant insights into the genomic basis of the efficiency and versatiity of its alkane degradation. It has two systems for alkane mineralization (alkane hydroxylase and cytochrome P-450). Both enzymes are flavin-dependent monooxygenases. So far, in many reports have been shown that the enhancement of flavin reductase activity, has considerable effect on the mono-oxygenase activity. The main aim of the next step of this project is to find the key residues that have essential roles in electron transfer, and change them by site-direct mutagenesis (in order to enhancement of flavin reductase activity and finally alkane degradation efficiency). While classic models of allostery are described by transitions of oligomers of a defined number of subunits, many authors proposed more extended schemas including association-dissociation equilibria (e.g., [1] references therein). Since intracellular diffusion of molecules is strongly dependent on size, and consequently on association state, the significance of dynamic variation of mobility was examined by numerical simulations. The results show that if a relevant ligand is introduced in a non homogeneous manner, a condition that is often valid in vivo, then the macromolecule will be distributed in an uneven way. On the other hand, the examination of a considerable number of examples of ligand-modulated association reported in bibliography on energy metabolism and the basic biosynthetic pathways shows that in most cases specific association patterns are followed: In the majority of instances the substrate or activating effector induces the formation of bulkier forms. The second most frequent motif is association induced by a feedback inhibitor. It is intriguing that the latter scheme appears in almost all cases when the substrates have to fullfil other major metabolic roles. These recurring motifs, in conjunction with the numerical results, suggest that allostery may be at the base of spatial organization of the main metabolic pathways. Besides, Bioinformatics became a fundamental tool for development of new approaches as functional genomics, comparative genomics, pharmacogenomics and others. We developed the AnEnp, a tool that groups proteins based on sequence similarity of enzymatic function that allows the search of analogies between organisms. It is capable of clustering protein sequences and visualizing the results; it also carries out similarity searches via BLAST and/or HMMER and reconstructs metabolic maps. We used AnEnp to find putative analogies of enzymatic functions between Homo sapiens, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania major, using as model the biochemical pathways for lipid, energetic and amino acid metabolism. We selected a set of analogous enzymes from T. cruzi and L. major to perform cloning, expression, purification and analyze their potential for drug development. Now a day we have done this strategy for two enzymes from mevalonate pathway from T. cruzi and another two enzymes, one from pentose shunt pathway and other from tricarboxylic cycle. Those enzymes were cloned, expressed, purified and were used to developed polyclonal antibody, which ones were used for identifying constitutional expression on these parasites.

Several mechanisms have been described for the adaptation to osmotic pressure due to high concentrations of salts or sugars. They all involve responses to signals triggering intracellular production of compatible solutes, which act as osmo-protectants. Zymomonas mobilis is exceptionally tolerant to extremely high concentrations of glucose, conditions that do not lead to production of any known compatible solute. An osmo-regulated operon (glc) involved in glucose tolerance has been identified and sequenced by our team, comprising of four putative structural genes (Christogianni, et al., J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5179-5188), the function of which is yet unknown. Methods: To investigate this apparently new osmo-regulatory mechanism we studied the expression of the natural products encoded by the four genes of the glc operon under conditions of growth on high glucose concentration by western blot analysis. Results: Polyclonal antibodies for each gene product were isolated using PCR amplified and overexpressed recombinant proteins of the glc operon as antigens.

Sedlacek and I. Kucera Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC Bacteria express two distinct nitrate reductases that are associated with the respiratory chain: the membrane-bound, cytoplasmically oriented Nar, and the periplasmic Nap. In Paracoccus denitrificans Nar is expressed under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate which must be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane to reach the active site of this enzyme. The periplasmic nitrate reductase Nap is expressed during the aerobic growth on butyrate even in the absence of nitrate. The activity of these two enzymes is usually measured using colored bipyridylium cation radicals methyl viologen (MV) or benzyl viologen (BV) as electron donors. It is generally believed that the more polar MV does not enter the cell and hence donates electrons exclusively to Nap, while oxidation of hydrophobic BV reflects the action of both enzymes. This issue was further examined by a kinetic analysis of nitrate reduction in the wild-type strain and in the Nar or Nap mutant strains. The results show that (i) MV is a quite effective donor for either enzyme, (ii) BV blocks the active transport of nitrate to the active site of Nar, and (iii) BV functions as an ionophore for nitrate at higher concentrations.

An up-regulation of several TDP-dependent metabolic routes under conditions of oxidative stress has been observed in many organisms, including baker's yeasts which posses the ability to synthesize thiamine (vitamin B 1 ) de novo. We hypothesize that the biosynthesis of thiamine and its further activation to TDP, should also add to the yeast response to the stress conditions. In this work, we preliminarily test this hypothesis by analyzing the changes in the levels of representative thiamine-synthesizing, activating and utilizing enzymes in yeasts subjected to the oxidative stress. Methods: Baker's yeast strain BY4741, grown in the complete YPD medium or in a minimal EMM2 medium free of thiamine, was stressed by treatment with 0.5 mM hydrogen peroxide or higher temperature (37\u00b0C).

University of Thessaly, Larissa, GREECE Pseudomonas entomophila was recently identified to be the only pseudomonad that naturally infects and induces lethality of Drosophila melanogaster [1] . Complete sequencing of the 5.9-Mb P. entomophila genome exposed potential virulence factors aiding the pathogenic nature of this bacterium but experimental evidence is still lacking for most of them [2] . Cyanogenesis (e.g. HCN production) has been demonstrated in a small number of bacterial species. The presence of hcnABC gene cluster (encoding HCN synthase) in P. entomophila genome led us to assume that P. entomophila produces cyanide. HCN production was measured in liquid cultures using a cyanide ion-selective microelectrode and on solid media using a standard method [3] . HCN concentration was found 70-80 lM in liquid cultures and roughly 500 lM on solid media demonstrating unequivocally that P. entomophila produces HCN. In contrast to the wild type, a mutant strain (DGacA) does not produce any HCN in liquid culture but produce some HCN on solid media (roughly 100 lM). These data demonstrate that the GacS-GacA two component regulatory system affects in a positive manner HCN production in P. entomophila, though a second unknown regulator affects HCN production under certain physiological conditions. In conclusion we demonstrate for the first time cyanide production by P. entomophila, we determine genetic factors that affect HCN production and we discuss the implications of HCN production in pathogenicity exerted by P. entomophila.

Methods: RNA arbitrarily primed PCR and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) were employed to compare the transcriptional profiles and the whole-cell chemical composition of these epigenetic phenotypes, respectively. Results: RNA fingerprints revealed significant differences among the phenotypes indicating that gene expression during ATR is influenced not only by the growth phase but also by the treatments employed to induce the response. The genes coding for the mannose-specific IID component, the 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase, the 3-oxoacylacyl carrier protein, the large subunit of carbamoyl-phosphate synthase and a hypothetical protein were found to be induced at least under some of the acid adapting conditions. Furthermore, principal component analysis of the second derivative transformed FT-IR spectra segregated S. macedonicus phenotypes individually in all spectral regions that are characteristic for major cellular constituents like polysaccharides of the cell wall, fatty acids of the cell membrane, cellular proteins and other compounds absorbing in these regions. These findings evidence major changes in cells' chemical composition due to acid adaptation that were clearly different to some extent among the phenotypes. Conclusion: Overall, our data demonstrate the plasticity in ATR of S. macedonicus that reflects the inherent ability of the bacterium to adjust the response to the distinctiveness of the imposed stress condition probably in an attempt to maximize its adaptability. In bacterial cell cycle, timing of chromosome replication is tightly linked to the cell size. The replication is initiated at oriC by DnaA-ATP that is consequently released as inactive DnaA-ADP. Rejuvenation of DnaA-ADP to DnaA-ATP is promoted by its binding to acidic phospholipids enriched membrane. We have previously reported a phenomenon of a cooperative transition of DnaA between two functional states, with low and high nucleotide dissociation rates, which is driven by the density of the protein (crowding) on the membrane surface. Furthermore, the concept of lipid domains in bacterial membrane and their functional role got an experimental support in recent years. Combining these phenomena allowed us to suggest a new mechanism for the DNA initiation control in bacteria underlying transduction of the continuous cell growth to the discontinuous chromosome replication. Initiation of DNA replication occurs when the cell mass reaches a critical value, the initiation mass, that is determined by the cellular level of DnaA. Excess of DnaA causes decrease in initiation mass and overinitiation. We used a mutant DnaA defective in DNA binding, produced in E. coli in a controlled fashion, to create a crowding effect on the membrane without affecting initiation. Thus, delaying the native DnaA activity transition on the membrane (lowering the rejuvenation rate) should cause an increase in initiation mass, in contrast to the native DnaA expression. The initiation mass was determined in a wide range of mutant and native DnaA levels and the results are discussed in the frame of the suggested hypothesis.",

Sophianopoulou Institute of Biology, National Centre for Scientific Research ''Demokritos'' (NCSRD), Athens, GREECE Aspergillus nidulans asexual reproduction leads eventually to cell differentiation. A conidiospore germinates to form tubular hyphae that will develop into the mycelium, a network of interconnected cells that differentiate into conidiophores. Although the process of conidial germination in filamentous fungi has been extensively studied, many aspects remain to be elucidated since the asexual spore or conidium is vital in their life cycle. The fungus cell wall is a complex structure consisting of polysaccharides such as glucans and chitin, and a minority component of proteins and lipids together with galactose and mannose. Breakage and reformation of cell wall polymer bonds along with the maintenance of cell wall plasticity during conidia germination depend upon a range of hydrolytic enzymes whose activity is analogous to that of expansins, a highly conserved group of plant cell wall proteins with characteristic wall loosening activity. In the current study we identified and characterized the eglD gene in A. nidulans, an expansin-like gene the product of which shows strong similarities with bacterial and fungal endo-b1,4-glucanases. The eglD gene is constitutively expressed in all developmental stages and compartments of A. nidulans asexual life cycle. However, the EglD protein is exclusively present in conidial cell walls. The role of the EglD protein in morphogenesis, growth and germination rate of conidia was investigated. Our results show that EglD is a conidial cell wall localized expansin-like protein, which could be involved in cell wall remodeling during germination. Introduction: Hyaluronan, sulfated glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans versican and decorin play important roles in cancer. The present study investigates their expression and chemical structure in cartilaginous and non-cartilaginous tissues in laryngeal cancer. Methods: Proteoglycans were characterized immunohistochemically and by western blotting; their expression was examined by RT-PCR. Glycosaminoglycans were purified and characterized by gel chromatography and HPLC. Results: Proteoglycans were overexpressed in cancer, versican much more than decorin and correlated with their stage-related accumulation within the tissue. Decorin expression was higher to versican in normal larynx; their disproportionate overexpression during cancer resulted in equimolar expression. In cartilaginous tissues, the amounts of glycosaminoglycans decreased in contrast to non-cartilaginous, where glycosaminoglycans increased significantly. In all cases, 4-sulfated/6-sulfated and non-sulfated/sulfated disaccharides were significantly increased. The sulfated glycosaminoglycans from both cancerous tissues were of lower M r with increased polydispersity and heterogeneity compared to normal. The high M r hyaluronan was also significantly decreased. Of particular interest was the great increase of low M r hyaluronan (330 000-890 000) in non-cartilaginous tissues.",

Anandamide [N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA)], one of the most-studied endocannabinoids, is effective primarily by binding to CB1R and CB2R cannabinoid receptors and is subjected to intracellular degradation to arachidonic acid by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). A recent study reports that 3T3-L1 preadipocytes possess a functional endocannabinoid system which elements are modulated during cell differentiation to adipocytes. We have already shown that AEA is an inducer of rat adipocyte differentiation. In this study we investigate the existence of CBRs and FAAH in rat preadipocytes and the possible modulation of their expression during the differentiation process induced by AEA. Embryonic stem cells (ESC) give rise to the possibility that stem cell therapy can be introduced in the treatment of incurable diseases, as their pluripotency indicates that they can be grown indefinitely without losing the capacity for multi-differentiation. However, before cell replacement therapies can be used, the problems with the tumorigenicity of undifferentiated ESC must be solved. In the present study, we attempt to find biomarkers with which to detect undifferentiated ESC that may cause the formation of tumors. We induced neuronal differentiation from R1, a mouse ESC-line, using a five-step method and simulta-neously measured the values of telomerase activity (TA). And then we set up modified method using physical removal colony, formed by undifferentiated ESC. To investigate the telomerase has relation with ESC formation in vivo, TERT-knock down cells were established by TERT-shRNA using lentiviral particle. We subcutaneously injected these cells into nude mice as immune deficient animal model for teratocarcinogenicity and measured incidence and volume of tumor formed in mice for 4 weeks. The tumor incidence and volume were significantly decreased by modification of differentiation protocol as removal colony, and volumes of formed tumor by TERT-knock down ESC showed significantly decreased against those of null ESC. In these results, we recognized that telomerase containing TERT and removal of undifferetiated ESC highly expressing telomerase activity has important roll in reduction of tumor formation on ESC teratocarcinogenicity, suggesting that telomerase appears to be a useful biomarker for the assessment of the safety of stem cell-based therapies using ESC. Introduction: The structural damage of skeletal muscle fibres may be caused by different events, such as the cumulative effects of a series of contractions that could mimic an intense excercise. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)-formed by sphingosine kinase (SphK) has been recently reported to exert a physiologically important biological activity in myoblasts, acting simultaneously as anti-proliferating and pro-differentiating agent through the activation of a specific S1P receptor [1] . However, the importance of S1P in repair and prevention of muscle damage has not been investigated yet. To this end, muscular injury has been induced in fast skeletal muscle fibres by cycles of contractures in a K+ solution alternated by recover in Ringer solution, in the presence and in absence of S1P. Tissue damage was estimated by electrophysiologial, biochemical and morphological analysis. Results: Our results showed a marked decreased resistance and a depolarization of the resting membrane potential after K + -contractures, paralleled by an higher level of SphK activity and S1P production. Interestingly, muscle damage was significantly prevented by the addition of S1P to the bath solution during the contractures. In these experimental conditions, satellite cells obtained from these muscle fibers, exhibited an increased proliferation activity, as judged by Western analysis and MTT assay and, when incubated in serum-free medium, showed an enhanced ability to accomplish myogenic differentiation.",

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of cell type, sex of cell and embryo culture medium on somatic cell cloning (SSC). In the first experiment, five different medium combinations were compared to examine the effec to fcl on embryo development. In these condexperiment, we investigated the effect of source and sex of cells on SSC.Bovineoocytes isolated from slaughterhouse ovaries were matured in TCM199 supplemented with fetalbovineserum (FBS), sodiumpyruvate, penicillin/ streptomycin EGFbFSH, and bLH. After maturation, cumulus cells were removed and oocytes previously stained with Hoechst were nucleated by aspirating the first polar body and the metaphase II plate. A single cells derived from cartilage tissue of two different strain of cow was inserted into the perivitelline space of the enucleated oocyte. Oocyte-cell couples were fused by a DC pulse of 133V/500 (m for30 (s in the Zimmerman's medium.-After fusion, fused NT units were activated using a combination of CaI(5lM for5 min),CD(2.5 lg/ml)+cycloheximide(CHX,10lg/ml) for 1 h and CHX alone for 4 h. After activation, NT units were cultured in Sage medium for 72 h and then additonal 4-5 days in five different medium combinations (Group1:Sage with 8mg/mlBSA Group2:Sage with10%-FCS;Group3:Sage with10% Serum replacment; Group 4:Sage with 8mg/ mlBSAand 5%FCS; Group5:Sage with 4mg/mlBSAand5% FCS). The differences among groups were analyzed. In the fifth group, blastocyst rate (39,3%) was higher than the other groups.When the compared the blastocytes rates between the first (18,36%) and the fifth groups (39,3%); the significant difference was found. In the second experiment, cell sources and sex were analyzed. Donor cells from two different native bovine strains(anatolian black and grey) were used.When used cells from the Anatolian black cow; there was not found significant differences between development of female and male cloned embryos (28,5% versus 26,6%) to blastocyt stage.-However; when the Anatolian black and Grey cloned embryos from male cells were compared, the significant differences were visulalized on blastocysts (26,6% versus 38,2%, respectively) development. This results showed that blastocysts developed higher in the fifth group than the other groups.In addition source of cells were affected that SSC blastocysts rates. Stem cells undergo continuous self-renewal by a combination of proliferation and apoptosis. During embryogenesis though, many of the proteins that contribute to the execution phase of apoptosis in somatic and malignant cells are not activated in the same way. In this communication we have focused to study the apoptotic function of gammaH2AX in embryogenesis, utilizing mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells from wild type and knockout H2AX mice, and in vitro differentiated in embryoid bodies. We have previously shown in somatic and malignant cells that gammaH2AX is induced massively upon activation of apoptotic endonucleases, but it cannot be detected by immunocytochemistry, as it becomes masked in a caspase-6-dependent manner. Straurosporineinduced apoptosis in wild type and H2AX +/-mES cells resulted in gamma-H2AX formation detected by immuoblotting, indicating DNA fragmentation. In contrast to the apoptotic masking of gammaH2AX in differentiated cells, immunocytochemistry performed in apoptotic mES cells showed a foci-like pattern, resembling the gammaH2AX pattern induced by Apoptosis-Inducing Factor prior to caspase activation. In accordance, co-treatment of apoptotic cells with caspase inhibitors show no effect, indicating that the gammaH2AX apoptotic pattern in mES cells is caspase-independent. Further, apoptosis induction with staurosporine in mouse H2AX -/-ES cells resulted in massive chromatin relaxation and disorganization. This effect is unique to the doublestrand breaks generated by staurosporine in the course of apoptosis, as it is not observed in irradiated H2AX -/-mES cells. The above described distinct features of apoptotic gammaH2AX pattern in early embryogenesis faint away, as cells differentiate progressively to ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm lineage.",

Introduction: Rat neural stem cells (rNSCs) with self-renewal and multilineage potential are considered a good candidate for cell replacement of damaged nervous tissue. In vitro experimental conditions can differentiate these cells into neuronal phenotypes. The purpose of the present study is to characterize the effects of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP)-mediated differentiation, and by which molecular mechanism regulated in rNSCs. Methods: To test whether the rNSCs-derived neurons could express neuronal specific properties, the differentiated cells were characterized by (i) morphological analysis, (ii) immunostaining for neuronal specific proteins, and (iii) the expression of characteristic neuronal ion channels. Results: Using immunostaining and immunoblot analysis, we have shown that some neuronal proteins, including neurofilament, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and TUJ1, are expressed in dbcAMP-treated cells but are almost absent in untreated cells. To further confirm the differentiated cells to be neuronal cells, functional characterization of these cells was conducted using calcium imaging analysis system. Moreover, treatment of rNSC with H89, a PKA inhibitor, partially blocked the effect of dbcAMP. On the other hand, to address the significance of signal transduction pathways involved in the differentiation induced by dbcAMP, we used several potent inhibitors, such as KN93, a CaMKII inhibitor; two types of MEK inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059 and okadaic acid, an inhibitors of PP2A/2B. All of these inhibitors could block dbcAMP-stimulated neuronal differentiation significantly. Conclusions: Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that multiple signaling pathways are involved in the differentiation of rNSCs.",

Introduction: Nasal polyposis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa, that characterised by inflammatory cell infiltration, modifications of epithelial differentiation, tissue remodelling, extracellular matrix accumulation, and oedema. The insuline-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) belongs to a family of binding proteins, which bind the insuline-like growth factors, IGF-I and IGF-II, thus regulating their effective abilities. The aim of the study was the detection and identification of enzymatic activity able to degrade the IGFBP-3 in nasal polyps tissue extracts. Methods: Human nasal polyps specimens were extracted with 0.15M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, buffer, centrifuged at 12000g and the supernatants were collected. The serine protease activity in extracts was purified by affinity chromatography, using an agarose-p-amino-benzamidine gel. The study of IGF-I/IGFBP-3 interaction was performed by a solid phase method. Results: Extracts of nasal polyps tissue contained IGFBP-3-degrading activity, which was significantly inhibited by benzamidine hydrochloride. Affinity purified IGFBP-3-degrading activity cleaved the IGFBP-3 in two major fragments of approximately 27 and 14 kDa molecular mass, which were not able to bind IGF-I. This activity was rather specific for IGFBP-3, since it did not degrade casein, ovalbumin and gelatin. The IGFBP-3, which significantly suppressed the IGF-I-induced proliferation of nasal polyp fibroblasts, upon treatment with the affinity purified IGFBP-3-degrading activity lost its suppressive activity.",

The direct involvement of VIP receptor is also demonstrated by using JV-1-53 analogue. Conclusion: VIP induces a different mechanism of ligand-independent activation of EGFR in human hormone-dependent breast and prostate carcinomas. Although the stimulation pattern is different, these findings support the potential therapeutic value of available VIP receptor antagonists, as well as their usefulness in combined treatments with EGFR antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors in human hormonedependent cancers. localized on X, Y and Z catalytic subunits, respectively.

Many studies demonstrated the beneficial effects of estrogens in osteoarthritis. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of estrogens and phytoestrogens on proteasome expression and activity in chondrocytes from patients with osteoarthritis. Methods: Articular cartilage chondrocytes were cultured in the absence or presence of 17 b-estradiol or genistein for 24 hour. The proteasome CT-L activity was determined, using the fluorogenic substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. The estrogen receptors (ERa, ERb) and proteasome subunits expression at mRNA levels was ascertained by RT-PCR and cell viability was documented by MTT method. Results: Genistein and estradiol up-regulated estrogen receptors expression, with genistein and estradiol to be more effective on ERa and ERb, respectively. They also caused a significant up-regulation and down-regulation on the expression of Z and Y subunit of proteasome, respectively. The expression of X subunit was up-regulated by genistein, while estradiol had no effect on it. The ATP-independent proteasome CT-L activity was enhanced by genistein and estradiol, mainly by genistein.

Morbidity and mortality due to prostate cancer are mainly a result of prostate cancer metastases. After the initial neoplastic transformation of cells, the process of metastasis develops through a series of sequential steps, which involve tumor proliferation, loss of adhesion, local invasion and migration from the primary tumor. Previously, we reported that Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) plays an important role in the initiation of prostate cancer because this peptide enhances ciclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) [1] .The aim of this study was demonstrated that VIP is implicated in progression to malignancy. We analyzed VIP effect in two human prostate cell lines: androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and independent (PC3) cancer cells. 3 H-thymidine assay showed that VIP significantly increased the cell proliferation by 70% in both cell lines compared with untreated controls. Immunoblotting of Cyclin D1 showed a time-dependent VIP increase of Cyclin D1 expression that reached the maximum level at 8 and 6 hours in LNCaP and PC3 cells, respectively. Adhesion assay showed that both cells rapidly whereas and VIP decreased significantly these adhesions. Immunoblotting of Ecadherin demonstrated that VIP decreased the E-cadherin expression in both cell lines. Finally, invasion assay showed that VIP increased the invasion process in both cancer cell lines. All these effects appeared faster at advanced cancer progression. Thus, the implication of VIP in these three steps of metastasis process (proliferation, loss of adhesion and invasion) suggests the involvement of VIP in prostate cancer progression as a pro-metastatic factor. Introduction: It has recently been reported that oxytocin (OT) is produced by some tumoral cell types, and that OT receptors (OTRs) are expressed in a variety of cell types. Among these, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) respond to OT with an increased proliferation, suggesting a possible role for the hormone in the regulation of angiogenesis. Methods: We employed chemotaxis and chemoinvasion assays to characterize the effect of OT on HUVEC motility, and immunoblot analysis to study its molecular mechanisms of action.",

Tumor necrosis factor-a is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is a member of a group of cytokines that all stimulate the acute phase reaction. TNF causes apoptotic cell death, cellular proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, tumorigenesis, and viral replication. Adrenomedullin (AdM) is a potent, vasodilator peptide that was originally isolated from human pheochromocytoma. AdM signaling is of particular significance in endothelial cell biology since the peptide protects cells from apoptosis, promotes angiogenesis, and affects vascular tone and permeability.

Introduction and results: The serine/threonine kinase PDK1 plays a central role in cellular signaling by phosphorylating members of the AGC family of kinases, including PKB/Akt. We now present evidence showing that PDK1 is essential for the motility of vascular endothelial cells and it is involved in the regulation of their chemotaxis. Endothelial cells differentiated from mouse embryonic stem cells lacking PDK1 completely lost their ability to migrate in vitro in response to VEGF-A. In addiction, PDK1 -/embryoid bodies exhibit evident developmental and vascular defects that can be attributed to a reduced cell migration. Moreover, the over-expression of PDK1 increased the endothelial cell migration induced by VEGF-A. The ability of PDK1 to regulate cell chemotaxis is dependent on its PH and catalytic domains. As cell adhesion on extra-cellular matrix is essential during cell migration, we analyzed the role of PDK1 in this process. First, we observed that shRNA-mediated PDK1 knock-down inhibited endothelial cell adhesion on vitronectin and, in a lesser way, on fibronectin. In addiction, PDK1 co-immunoprecipitated with both avb3 and a5b1 and it co-localized with avb3 during the early phases of adhesion on vitronectin. Moreover, PDK1 knock-down endothelial cells displayed paxillinstained focal adhesions thicker and longer compared to wild-type cells.",

We showed that prolactin (PRL)-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 phosphorylates PAK1 in vivo and that WT but not kinase dead JAK2 directly phosphorylates PAK1 in cells and in an in vitro kinase assay. Using mass spectrometry and 2D peptide mapping, we identified tyrosines 153, 201 and 285 in PAK1 as sites of JAK2 kinase tyrosyl phosphorylation. Experiments using PAK1 with tyrosines 153, 201 and 285 mutated to phenylalanines (PAK1 Y3F) suggest that these tyrosines serve as regulatory sites in PAK1. Phosphorylation of these tyrosines by JAK2 increased PAK1 kinase activity by more than two times and decreased staurosporineinduced apoptosis. To test whether pTyr-PAK1 participates in cytokine-stimulated actin reorganization, we overexpressed WT or Y3F PAK1 in 3T3 F442A cells that have the growth hormone (GH) receptor and MCF7 cells that have the PRL receptor and assayed membrane ruffling. Overexpression of WT PAK1 stimulated membrane ruffling in response to GH and PRL compared to control cells whereas the Y3F PAK1 blocked the ruffling. We examined the effect of pTyr-PAK1 on cell motility using a gold particle motility (phagokinetic) assay. The cells overexpressing PAK1/JAK2 or PAK T423E exhibited increased cell motility compared to cells overexpressing either WT PAK1/JAK2 K882E or 3YF PAK1.

We present a case report of a pregnant rat which developed a malignant giant breast tumor after treatment with CHX. We try to investigate the mechanism of action of CHX by determining the caspase-3 activity in liver. Methods: Pregnant rats (Wistar) were injected with CHX (3 mg/ kg.b.w.) on 10 th , 11 th gestational days, and 24 hour before sacrificing. Pregnancy on most of the rats resulted in abortions and teratomas, while on one of those, a big breast tumor developed rapidly, which in 2 months became enormous. Three months after the tumor was first observed, we anesthetized the animal, removed the tumor by a surgical operation and sacrificed it. Liver also removed and homogenized. Following subcellular fractionation according to the method of Nordlie and Lardy, the caspase-3 activity was determined in crude, nuclear, and cytosolic+ribosomal fractions by a colorimetric assay (kit, Sigma), based on the hydrolysis of the peptide substrate acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp p-Nitroaniline (pNA) moiety. Tissue samples from the breast tumor were proceeded for histological sections in order to observe its histological structure. Paraffin sections 4 lm thick were stained with Hematoxylin, Eosin and Trichrome Masson. Introduction: The local and systemic inflammatory response induced by brain hypoxia is an important target for the actual research. Our aim is to study the neuronal growth factor -neurotrophin 3 (NT3) and the inflammatory cytokines (TNFa, IL-6 and IL-10) in serum and cerebrospinal (CSF) patients with ischemic stroke, in order to establish possible correlations between their dynamic and activity. Methods: Forty-five patients aged 67.65 \u00b1 10.11 years. were investigated after computed tomography-confirmed IS. The biological samples were represented by blood and CSF. NT-3 and cytokines were determined using ELISA kits. Results: No significant changes were obtained for TNFa and IL-10. Considering NT3 and IL-6 levels, patients were divided in three groups.

Introduction: Coexpression of EGFR and HER-2 has been reported in a subset of colon cancers and may cooperatively promote tumor cell growth and survival. In the current study, two tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and lapatinib, were evaluated in two colon cancer cell lines, DLD-1 and Caco-2. The aim of the study was to investigate their effect on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. Methods: Cell proliferation was estimated using the MTT assay and apoptosis was evaluated by DNA fragmentation and the Annexin V binding assay. EGFR and HER-2 protein and mRNA levels were evaluated by immunoblotting and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. The solution of the question about existing of the second route of ammonia assimilation in higher plants is very important for plant biochemistry. There is a number of works in which it is underlined that NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase (NADP-GDh) can play role in ammonia assimilation. However up to date nobody succeeded to study kinetic characteristics of NADP-GDh. We also couldn't purify the soluble form of NADP-GDh. In this reason we decided to isolate it. Using chromatography on column with nanostructured carbon sorbent we purified spherosome bound NADP-GDh from filling seeds of wheat. This spherosome bound NADP-GDh has high affinity to ammonia. Its K M is equal to 1.3 lM. We studied the activation of this enzyme on the model system on the unembryonated dry wheat seeds that were treated by fusicoccin. It was established that fusicoccin activates spherosome bound NADP-GDh by increasing of level of cytosolic calcium. It was established that mechanism of activation of NADP-GDh of spherosome includes two stages: first is binding of cytosolic Ca 2+ with GDh of spherosome, the second stage is the phosphorylation of spherosome enzymes. Thus we discovered the new route of assimilation of ammonia which is carried out by spherosome bound NADP-GDh. The activation of this enzyme is controlled by fusicoccin, Ca 2+ and phosophorylation. Introduction: TNFa is a proinflammatory cytokine, which is produced by many cell types, including adipocytes. Today, much effort has been given to clarify the role of TNFa in obesity and insulin resistance. TNFa affects adipocyte function in various ways including their implication in inflammation, which accompanies the development of obesity. The inflammatory lipid mediator PAF often mediates the effects of TNFa on other cell types. We have already shown that TNFa induces PAF biosynthesis sevenfold higher in adipocytes than in preadipocytes. In this study, we investigate the involvement of PI3K and ERK1/2 in this process. Methods: Adipocytes and preadipocytes were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of male Wistar rats. The cells were treated with TNFa in the presence or absence of wortmannin. PAF production and ERK1/2 activation were determined by using [ 3 H]-lyso-PAF as a substrate and western blotting, respectively. Results: Wortmannin enhances TNFa-inducing effect on PAF syntesis in adipocytes, while it inhibits this effect in preadipocytes. TNFa affected differentially ERK1/2 activity in the two cell types, as it enhances the activity only in preadipocytes.

Nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a redox-sensitive transcription factor which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of many antioxidant genes. Resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenolic phytoalexin, has been reported to possess antiinflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and antioxidant activities. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of RSV against H/Rinduced oxidative stress using human cerebral microvascular endothelial (HCMVE) cells in vitro. Methods: HCMVE cells were pretreated with RSV (10 lM) for one hour and the cells were exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) to mimic H/R (6 hour OGD/24 hour reoxygenation) for the generation of ROS. Intracellular ROS production was measured flourometrically by using hydroxyphenyl fluorescein at 10 lM concentration. HCMVE cells were incubated with RSV (10 lM) and the activation of Nrf2 was analyzed by western blotting. Induction of Nrf2 target genes mRNA expression was determined by Real-time PCR.",

Here we show a functional association between PDK1 and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). The physical association between PDK1 and ASK1 is mediated by the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PDK1 and the C-terminal regulatory domain of ASK1. Wild-type PDK1, but not kinase-dead PDK1, negatively regulates ASK1 activity by phosphorylating ASK1 on serine 967. ASK1 phosphorylation by PDK1 significantly inhibits ASK1-mediated JNK and p38 kinase activities. In addition, PDK1-mediated inhibition of ASK1 is induced through the decrease of interaction between ASK1 and its substrate MKK3 and the stabilization of ASK1-14-3-3 complex, as well as the decrease of ASK1 homo-oligomerization. We also demonstrate that PDK1 suppresses ASK1-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting the ASK1-induced capase-3 activity. These results suggest that PDK1 physically interacts with ASK1 in vivo and acts as a negative regulator of ASK1.",

The activation of protein kinases ERK1/2 and Src seem to be crucial to change the pattern of gene expression in favour of neuronal differentiation.

Conclusion: The weaker nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 and Src could at least in part be responsible for the significantly poorer differentiation seen in proteasome inhibited PC12 cultures compared to NGF-treated controls. Introduction: Clonal cell lines, which possess the phenotype of original cells, are useful for studying the molecular mechanism of cell differentiation and cell death. Temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant of SV40T-antigen is known to be usable to control the cell proliferation and differentiation by temperature shift. We report here the establishment and characterization of noradrenergic chromaffin cell line carrying tsSV40T-antigen. Methods: Transgenic mice carrying tsSV40T-antigen gene (SV40tsA58) under the control of tyrosine hydroxylase gene promoter were produced. From the tumor tissue produced in adrenal medulla, chromaffin cells were isolated and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and G5 supplement. Results: From several clones, we isolated one clone, named tsAM5NE, which produced noradrenaline and secreted it actively into the medium. tsAM5NE cells proliferated at the permissive temperature of 33\u00b0C in response to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). At a non-permissive temperature of 39\u00b0C, GDNF acted to differentiate the cells into neuron-like cells. In the presence of GDNF, the morphological change induced by the temperature shift was associated with up-regulated expression of neuronal marker genes. The temperature shift in the absence of GDNF led to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis. These data suggested that GDNF inhibited the TRAIL-mediated apoptosis of tsAM5NE cells, and led to the stable neuronal differentiation. Conclusions: Noradrenergic chromaffin cell line, tsAM5NE cells, are quite useful for studying key molecules involved in GDNF-induced neuronal differentiation.",

Uncontrollable calcium transfer can trigger potentially lethal biochemical pathways causing excitotoxicity. In the present study we investigated the influence of glutamate induced ex-citotoxicity in neurites using PC12 cells. Methods: PC12-cells were cultured in complete DMEM medium supplemented with 15% horse serum and 5% FBS in the presence of antibiotics at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in a humidified incubator. Glutamate excitotoxicity cell death was affected by exposing naive and NGF-treated PC12 cells to glutamate at two different concentrations (0.5 lM and 10 lM) for 3 hour. We investigated the involvement of calpain inhibition in cell death induced by glutamate toxicity, using a calpain inhibitor MDL28170 (Cbz-Val-Phe-H) at two different concentrations (10 lM and 50 lM). Cell viability was estimated by a colorimetric method using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide.

However in higher glutamate concentrations both concentrations of MDL28170 did not seem to have any effect.

Skopouli Harokopio University of Athens, Athens, GREECE Introduction: Adiponectin is a hormone predominantly produced by adipose tissue, which displays immunoregulatory properties. Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltrates associated with destruction and dysfunction of salivary glands. We have previously shown that salivary gland epithelial cells (SGEC) from pSS patients as well as from controls are a source of adiponectin and they express the two adiponectin membrane receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. SGEC derived from pSS patients, constitutively produce and secrete adiponectin in higher quantities. Therefore, we examined the effect of adiponectin on the proliferation and apoptosis of SGEC of pSS and control individuals. Methods: The rate of cell proliferation was assessed using MTT assay, and apoptosis was measured by a specific ssDNA ELISA which detects apoptotic but not necrotic cells. The intracellular apoptosis pathway-activator camptothecin was used as positive control in both proliferation and apoptosis assays. Results: Adiponectin treatment leaded to a dose-depended suppression of proliferation in SGEC from pSS and control donors, with the maximum effect being observed with 20 lg/ml adiponectin. Intriguingly, SGEC exposure to adiponectin protected cells from spontaneous apoptosis. Conclusion: Adiponectin exerted direct antiproliferative effects on SGEC from pSS and control individuals without inducing apoptosis and protected SGEC from spontaneous apoptosis. These observations connote that this hormone may contribute to a stability of SGEC in this specific inflammatory milieu. Introduction: The cGMP-dependent protein kinase family of proteins (PKG) mediates many of the effects of the NO/cGMP pathway, controlling a variety of cellular responses ranging from smooth muscle cell relaxation to neuronal synaptic plasticity. In the present study we set out to determine the effect of PKG-I inhibition in VEGF-induced angiogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Methods: In vivo models: the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and the corneal assay. In vitro assays: proliferation, migration, tube-like formation assay. Results: Two peptides inhibitors for PKG-I were used: DT2 and DT3. Treatment of CAMs with DT-2 or DT3 reduced angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner (maximal inhibition of 13.7 \u00b1 0.7% of control at 10 nmol/egg). To investigate the role of PKG-I in growth factor-induced angiogenesis we tested the effect of DT-3 on VEGFstimulated neovessel growth in the corneal assay. DT3, when implanted at the same time with VEGF abolished the angiogenic response, while when implanted 5 days after VEGF reduced angiogenesis by 78%. In addition, DT-3 blocked VEGF-stimulated permeability, in vivo. We also tested the role of PKG-I in angiogenesis-related properties of human endothelial cells. In agreement with our in vivo observations, PKG-I inhibition reduced VEGF-induced signaling (ERK1/2 and p38), and attenuated VEGF-triggered migration and proliferation in these cells. In contrast, DT-3 exerted no effect in the tube-like formation. Conclusion: We conclude that PKG-I activation contributes to VEGF-induced angiogenesis.",

Methods: Monocytes were isolated from whole blood obtained from healthy donors with a normal body mass index (BMI) value. Pharmacological inhibition of specific signaling proteins was implemented. Fluorescence spectrometry and immunofluorescence techniques, as well as ELISA methods, were utilized. Dose-response curves were carried out in order to justify the leptin concentration that was used. Results: Leptin (160 ng/ml) was found to augment monocyte adhesion to and migration through laminin-1 (one of the main components of the extracellular matrix). Additionally, leptin increased CD36 receptor surface expression and moderately oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL 3 ) uptake levels.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether NHE-1 activity is influenced by hormones related to obesity. Methods: Monocytes were isolated from 12 obese subjects and 10 healthy age-and sex-matched controls. NHE-1 activity was estimated. Monocytes were incubated in the presence of glucose, insulin, leptin and adrenaline. When necessary, the inhibitors of known signaling molecules were added. Results: Our results indicate that treatment of monocytes with glucose, insulin, leptin or adrenaline cause an elevation in pHi, compared to control value, in both groups studied. In obese subjects d and e isomorphs of PKC and NADPH oxidase were involved, while in healthy volunteers a and b isomorphs of PKC and PI3K seem to play role in the elevation of pHi induced by glucose. Insulin caused an increase of pHi through the involvement PI3K and NO synthase in both groups studied, while in obese NADPH oxidase was also involved. In obese subjects, leptin activates NHE-1 through the involvement of a and b isomorphs of PKC, actin polymerization and NO synthase. Adrenaline also seems to activate NHE-1 through NO sythase, PI3K and actin polymerization, only in healthy subjects. Thyroid hormone (T3) plays a crucial role in processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation, while its implication on cellular apoptosis has not been well documented. Here we examined the effect of T3 on the apoptosis of GH4C1 cells and the mechanisms underlying this effect. We show that T3 produced a significant increase in apoptosis in serum-depleted conditions. This effect was accompanied by a decrease in NF-jB-dependent transcription, translocation of p65/NF-jB to the nucleus, phosphorylation, and transactivation. To further analyze the mechanisms by which T3 induced apoptosis, we examined its effects on the activity of the MAPK family. Our data show that ERK but not JNK or MAPK p38 was activated upon exposure to T3, and inhibition of ERK alone abrogated T3-mediated apoptosis. In addition T3 increased the expression of the MAPK phosphatase, DUSP1, in an ERK-dependent manner. Interestingly, the suppression of DUSP1 expression abrogated T3-induced inhibition of NF-jB-dependent transcription and p65/NF-jB translocation to the nucleus, as well as T3-mediated apoptosis. Overall, our results indicate that T3 induces apoptosis in pituitary cells by down-regulating NF-jB activity through a mechanism dependent on the ERK/DUSP1 pathway.",

It is suggested that a 1D -adrenoceptors are strongly related with the genesis/maintenance of hypertension and angiotensin II up regulates (cross talk) a 1D -adrenoceptors. We aimed to study the interaction between angiotensin II and the a 1 -adrenoceptors in aorta. We used thoracic aorta from male mice C57B/J6 (WT) and KO a 1D (12 weeks old), the dissected aortas were treated for 1 hour with angiotensin II in DMEM medium/37\u00b0C, and the RNA was obtained using Trizol reagent. RT PCR was conducted from treated vessels and controls (pool of 2-3 vessels per group). Quantification of gene expression levels of each a 1 -adrenoceptor was carried out using real-time PCR assay. Results show that angiotensin II up-regulated 4-fold the expression of a 1A and a 1B -adrenoceptors versus control in WT mice, while a 1D -adrenoceptor was up-regulated 1.5-fold. In KO the a 1A was upregulated 2-fold and the a 1B just 0.4-fold versus control (without angiotensin II). Data were normalized using ribosomal housekeeping 18S. Our results support the idea that there is cross talk between angiotensin II and the a 1 -adrenoceptors system since angiotensin II promotes an increased expression not only for a 1D subtype but also for a 1A and a 1B -adrenoceptors. Fever is due to the action of prostaglandin (PG) E2 on the brain and appears to require EP3 prostaglandin receptors (EP3Rs), but the site of action required for fever production has not been definitively identified. We have produced mice with conditional expression of EP3Rs to investigate their role in lipopolysaccharide-induced fever by insertion of flanking loxP sites into the 5'-untranslated region and the first intron of the EP3R gene. To switch the EP3R gene off focally within the brain, we have developed an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector that causes neurons to express Cre recombinase. In the transduced neurons, Cre recombinase removes the DNA segment flanked by loxP sites, to turn off the EP3R gene expression in pattern dictated by the site of AAV injection. Thereby, we identified the key site in the brain at which PGE2 acts on EP3 receptors on neurons to cause fever [1] . We also found that stereotaxic microinjections of AAV-Cre produce minimal tissue injury and that AAV10 is the superior serotype for expression of Cre recombinase in the MnPO due to enhanced and widespread transduction of neurons as compared to serotypes 2, 8 and 9. AAV transfects neurons very effectively, with small injections caused by AAV serotype 2 and larger ones by AAV serotype 10 (which diffuse more widely). The focal knockout approach used in this study has wide applicability to neuroanatomical problems involving dissection of the effects of different receptors with complex brain distributions. Introduction: Growth hormone secretagogue receptor type Ia (GHS-R1a) transduces signals carried by ghrelin, an acetylated 28-residue peptide hormone, to stimulate the release of growth hormone, and to actively regulate food intake and energy homeostasis. In addition, several studies indicate that ghrelin has other effects in the periphery, including effects on cell proliferation through activation of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, as well as anti-apoptotic effects on various cell types. In this work, we explore the role of b-arrestins in the activation of Akt in line with the role of b-arrestins in MAPK activation by ghrelin. Methods: For this purpose we used the HEK 293 cell line stably transfected with the ghrelin receptor, GHS-R1a, and we made inmunoprecipiation experiments as well as siRNA and also tested different inhibitors. Results: We observed that Akt phosphorylation is mediated by interplay of two signaling pathways. One pathway is mediated by b-arrestins 1 and 2, and requires entry of the receptor into a multiprotein complex associated to the b-arrestins. In this pathway Akt both physically interacts with and is activated by b-arrestins. A second pathway is G i/o -dependent and involves PDK1. Conclusions: Our findings support the view that ghrelin activates Akt pools that differ in their temporal and spatial distributions, and thus probably have different physiological targets as was described for MAPK.",

Extracellular S1P acts through specific G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in various cells including NIH3T3 fibroblasts. In these cells, intracellular S1P is also related to PDGF mitogenic signalling as second messenger and to PDGF-induced cell motility by autocrin mechanisms of S1P receptors stimulation. S1P and some GPCRs ligands transactivate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) with important effects down-stream the signalling pathways. Methods: Cell culture, transfection experiments, western blot analysis were performed as reported in the reference (1) . Results: Previously we demonstrated that PDGF receptor (PDGFr) is redox regulated in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and that S1P stimulation induces H 2 O 2 production (1). Concentration-and time-dependent PDGFr tyrosine phosphorylation after S1P stimulation have been demonstrated. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 857 essential for the full activation and regulation of PDGFr kinase activity was observed and similar results were obtained after cell stimulation by dihydro-S1P, S1P analogue that binds GPCRs. In fact, the results demonstrate that PDGFr-S1P transactivation occurred through GPCRs and was specific. S1P effect was mediated by c-Src kinase activation with the involvement of H 2 O 2 production. These events were up-stream of PDGFr transactivation and this study demonstrates that PDGFr transactivation contributes to ERK1/2 activation and NIH3T3 fibroblasts proliferation. Conclusions: These data can be useful to clarify S1P-stimulated transactivation of RTK that can contribute to the modulation of important pathophysiological conditions little known particularly in fibroblasts.

PRIP (phospholipase C related, but catalytically inactive protein) was identified as a novel inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding protein, whose domain organization is similar to that of phospholipase C-d1 but is catalytically inactive, comprizing two isoforms, PRIP-1 and PRIP-2. To get insight into the biological functions, we generated the double knockout (DKO) mice of both PRIP-1 and PRIP\u00a1V2, followed by the phenotypic analyses. DKO mice grew normally and became fertile. However DKO female exhibited the decreased litter occasion and litter size, indicating the dysfunction of female reproductive system. Then we examined the estrus cycle by cytological analysis of daily vaginal smears, resulting in the irregular cycle in DKO mice. We further noticed that the mutant mice had apparently smaller sized uterus by gross anatomical observation. Basal levels of serum leuteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone were significantly higher in the mutant, the event of which was also confirmed by examining the secretion from the tissue culture of anterior pituitary glands. These results suggest that PRIP is involved in maternal reproduction, through the gonadotropine secretion. The scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) is the natural receptor of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and plays an important role in the reverse transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver for secretion and to steroidogenic tissues for the production of steroid hormones. In the present study we investigated the role of hormone nuclear receptors in human SR-BI gene regulation in hepatic, adrenal and ovarian cells. In hepatic cells we showed that the activity of the hSR-BI promoter was inhibited by the orphan nuclear receptor Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 (HNF-4) as well as by the Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP), which is an established inhibitor of nuclear receptor activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the recruitment of HNF-4 to the distal region (-2787/-2301) of the hSR-BI promoter. In agreement with these findings, over-expression of HNF-4 repressed the endogenous SR-BI mRNA levels in HEK293T cells. In the adrenal and ovarian cells the expression of endogenous SR-BI and the activity of the hSR-BI promoter were decreased by dexamethasone administration and were further inhibited by over-expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The region between -290 and -62 was shown to be responsible for the inhibition by glucocorticoids. Finally, we examined the effect of Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF), in the expression of the SR-BI gene in steroidogenic tissues. We found that administration of CRF in ovarian SKOV-3 cells decreased the mRNA levels and the activity of the hSR-BI promoter, suggesting the CRF-induced signal transduction pathways negatively modulate SR-BI gene expression. In agreement with these findings we found that SR-BI mRNA levels were increased in adrenals from CRF KO mice.",

Suthipongchai Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok THAILAND Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a malignant tumor of the bile duct epithelium, is one of the major cancers in Northeast Thailand. This disease is difficult to diagnose and has a high mortality rate, thus posing an important public health problem in this region. c-Met, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, and its ligand, HGF, regulate diverse biological responses including proliferation, migration and invasion, key features of metastatic cancer. Over-expression of c-Met has frequently been found in cholangiocarcinoma suggesting the role of c-Met in cholangiocarcinogenesis. Here, we studied the biological effects of HGF stimulation on CCA cell lines. We found that two CCA cell lines over-expressed c-Met protein compared to H69 immortalize cholangiocyte. Functional studies demonstrated that HGF strongly induced invasive ability of HuCCA-1 and KKU-M213 via induction of cell motility. As MAPK pathway has been implicated in invasion in many cancer cell types, we have addressed the significance of the role of MAPK in HGF-induced invasiveness by using specific MEK-1 inhibitors, U0126. We showed that inhibition of MAPK pathway slightly affected HGF-mediated HuCCA-1 cell invasion but drastically suppressed KKU-M213 cell invasion induced by HGF. This indicated that HGF induces invasion of two CCA cell lines by distinct signaling pathways.",

Papadimitriou Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacy, University of Patras, Patras, GREECE Introduction: Pleiotrophin (PTN) is an 18 kDa growth factor displaying a significant role in tumor growth and angiogenesis. We have recently shown that pleiotrophin (PTN) induces human endothelial cell migration through its receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase RPTPb/e. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that mediate cell attachment to the ECM and interact with cell surface and soluble ligands. Among integrins, a m b 3 is the most abundant and influential receptor regulating angiogenesis. In the present work we studied the possible involvement of a m b 3 integrin in PTN-induced endothelial cell migration. Methods: A combination of methods was used, including immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis, migration assays, siRNA, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Results: A monoclonal antibody against a m b 3 but not a 5 b 1 integrin completely abolished the effect of PTN. PTN interacts directly with a m b 3 but not a 5 b 1 , while RPTPb/e receptor interacts with both integrins. The interaction is RGD-independent but seems to be through a cysteine loop at aminoacids 177-184 that regulates ligand specificity to a m b 3 . RPTPb/e is not required for interaction of PTN with a m b 3 but is necessary for PTN-induced phosphorylation of b 3 . Conclusions: PTN-induced migration of endothelial cells depends on the interaction between a m b 3 and RPTPb/e.",

Colombo Institute of General Physiology and Biological Chemistry 'G. Esposito', Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Milan, Milano, ITALY Introduction: EGFR and ErbB2 are tyrosine-kinase receptors that play a role in the mammary gland differentiation and HC11 cells represent a valid model to investigate their involvement in this process because they can become competent at responding to lactogenic hormones and expressing milk proteins. It is known that lactogenic hormones exhibit their effect antagonizing EGF signaling by the increase of EGFR threonine-phosphorylation and decrease of EGFR tyrosinephosphorylation. It has been also reported that gangliosides are important modulators of EGFR and ErbB2 expression levels and EGFR/ ErbB2 heterodimerization. Here, we provide the first evidence of the involvement of gangliosides in EGFR/ErbB2-mediated mammary cell differentiation. Methods: EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimers and receptor phosphorylation were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with specific anti-receptor and anti-phosphoaminoacid antibodies, and by alkaline phosphatase digestion. Endogenous gangliosides were removed by treatment with 10 lM [D]-PDMP for 4 days, and HC11 cell differentiation by treatment with 5 lg/ml prolactin and 1 lM desametazone for 6, 8, 16 and 24 hour. b-casein mRNA expression levels was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: Lactogenic hormone treatment of ganglioside-depleted HC11 cells results in a significant decrease of b-casein mRNA expression and analyses of EGFR-phosphorylation status and EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimers show a significant increase of EGFR tyrosine-phosphorylation levels and, interestingly, in the appearance of an alkaline phosphatasesensitive phosphorylated EGFR form that is specifically implied in the heterodimer formation with ErbB2. Conclusions: These novel findings suggest an important crosstalk mechanism between gangliosides and EGFR in mammary gland differentiation that may be relevant for the investigation in the breast cancer behaviour.",

The mechanism by which mutated Ras contributes to cancer development and morphological transformation of cells is still not completely understood. Ras generates down-stream effects through Raf, Rac, and Rho, affecting cell growth, lamellipodia and stress fiber formation. The subsequent activation of the MAPK (Raf > Mek > Erk) pathway is essential for cell growth and involved in a large number of cell-signaling events. To identify and characterize factors inhibiting the transforming signal of mutated Ki-Ras, we used a retroviral cDNA expression screen in NIH 3T3 cells. We identified a novel potent inhibitor of Ras-mediated morphological transformation encoded by a truncated version of the receptor for activated C-kinase (RACK1). The truncated protein, designated RACK1DWD1, lacked the N-terminal 49 amino acids encoding the first of the seven WD40 repeats in RACK1. RACK1DWD1 blocked the Ki-Ras transforming signal, and the RACK1DWD1 expression restored contact inhibition, stress fiber formation and reduced ERK phosphorylation in Ki-Ras transformed NIH 3T3 cells. We further showed that RACK1DWD1 interacts with wtRACK1 and the protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms a, bI, and d and that the RACK1DWD1 expression inhibits the cellular translocation of these PKC isoforms in response to 12-0-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate (TPA). The identification of a truncated RACK1 as an inhibitor of Ki-Ras-mediated morphological transformation is intriguing, since RACK1 functions as a scaffold protein and is implicated at several levels of signal transduction ranging from events at the plasma membrane receptors to interactions with transcription factors and regulated translation of mRNA. Our present findings place RACK1 as an important factor in Ki-Ras-initiated signal regulating cell morphology and transformation.",

We investigated role of Rho kinase in insulin-induced actin/cortactin interaction, GLUT4 trafficking and translocation in L6-GLUT4myc myotube cells. Rho kinase inhibitor decreased insulin-stimulated GLUT4myc translocation, glucose uptake and stress fiber formation. Conversely, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a Rho kinase activator, increased insulin-stimulated formation of stress fibers and GLUT4 translocation as well as glucose uptake. Both Rho kinase inhibitor and LPA had no effect on Akt phosphorylation in those cells over-expressed wild type cortactin. On the other hand, Cytochalasin D, an actin depolymerizing agent and Wortmannin, a PI3-K inhibitor, completely blocked insulin-induced glucose uptake, indicating the involvement PI3-K/Akt/Rho kinase/actin/cortactin interaction. The effect of inhibitor was even more pronounced in the presence of over-expressed cortactin suggesting that the same pathway is involved. Knockdown of cortactin by siRNA did inhibit insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation, actin stress fiber formation and glucose uptake. These results suggest that the Rho kinase and actin binding protein cortactin interaction is required for actin stress fiber formation in muscle cells and that this process is absolutely required for translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane. Failure to translocation GLUT4 correctly in states of insulin resistance or diabetes may be linked to changes in actin dynamics and suggest novel potential targets for drug development.",

ADIPOQ gene variation has also been associated with obesity, insulin resistance and circulating adiponectin in various populations. The aim of the present study was to search for associations between ADIPOQ gene SNPs and adiponectin concentration, obesity markers, insulin resistance and other components of the metabolic syndrome in children. Methods: The study population was comprised of healthy children aged 11.2y from the GENDAI Study. Two well studied SNPs (+276G/T and -11391G/A) were selected for investigation. High quality genotyping data as well as anthropometrical and biochemical data, and adiponectin levels were available for approximately 700 subjects. Results: Both SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequency of the minor allele was 0.287 for +276G/T and 0.100 for -11391G/A. Due to the small number of homozygotes for the rare allele for SNP -11391G/A, carriers of the rare allele were tested against homozygotes for the common allele. In univariate analysis of variance, SNP +276G/T was significantly associated with serum triglycerides(mean \u00b1 SD: GG = 66.3 \u00b1 24.0, GT = 62.8 \u00b1 23.5, TT = 61.2 \u00b1 21.2 mg/dL; p = 0.026) and adiponectin (mean \u00b1 SD: GG = 4.7 \u00b1 2.6; GA = 4.3 \u00b1 2.3, AA = 5.3 \u00b1 3.0 lg/ml; p = 0.045), even after adjustment for known covariates. We failed to find any significant association between SNP -11391G/A and the tested variables. Conclusions: In our population, SNP +276G/T was significantly associated with serum adiponectin and triglycerides. Homozygotes for the rare allele had higher levels of adiponectin and lower levels of triglycerides.

In the HEK293 cells studied, we further found that c-Src was required for the metalloproteinase-promoted processing of the ligand precursor. Notably, b-arrestin was not necessary for the metalloproteinase-dependent release of the trans-activating ligand. Given the recent observations that b-arrestin can be recruited to RTK in response to their cognate ligands, we next investigated whether b-arrestin could also be recruited to IGFR following its transactivation by V2R. In co-immunoprecipitation studies, we indeed observed that b-arrestin-1 associates with IGFR in response to V2R activation and that this event is required for the V2R promoted ERK1/2 activation. Conclusion: These findings substantiate the pleiotropic nature of barrestin and suggest that recruitment of barrestin to the transactivated IGFR may be involved in the scaffolding of the down-stream MAPK signaling cascade promoted by V2R. The present study thus brings to light a previously unappreciated level of complexity in the regulation of signaling by these scaffolding proteins.",

LETM1 gene was first identified as one of several genes within a chromosomal interval that is deleted in patients with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Patients with this syndrome can have growth delays, mental retardation, epileptic seizures and they can have facial abnormalities, including facial closure defects. Differences in the combinations of symptoms and their severity are thought to result from the extent of the chromosomal deletion in individual patients. Although the gene or genes that are responsible for the observed pathologies have not yet been positively identified, LETM1 is considered a strong candidate for the epileptic component, because it is a mitochondrial protein and mitochondrial defects often have wide-ranging and varied consequences including epilepsy. Moreover, deletion of the LETM1 gene correlates well with the occurrence of epilepsy in Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome patients. Here, we investigated CTMP can strong interacts with LETM1 within mitochondria. Over-expression of LETM1 caused mitochondrial fragment and cristae swelling. We also fined that over-expression of LETM1 leading to OPA1 cleavage and sensitive to apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest that CTMP interacts with LETM1 within mitochondria.

Studies concerning growth factor-effects on IVD cell proliferation are limited, however, in part due to the paucity of healthy human tissue samples. We have used primary cultures from bovine coccygeal IVDs as well as from human biopsies, either from disc prolapse or from scoliotic patients. Their proliferative response to three potent mitogens immunolocalized in the disc, i.e. platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) was studied using tritiated thymidine and 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and cell cycle analysis by FACS. The activation of pivotal signalling pathways was investigated using Western analysis as well as specific pharmacologic inihibitors. All three mitogens were shown to induce DNA synthesis in quiescent IVD cells through the activation of extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERKs), as well as of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI 3-K/Akt) pathway. No differences were observed between human and bovine IVD cell cultures regarding their stimulation by the growth factors or the signal transduction pathways involved, indicating that the bovine coccygeal disc cell model is a suitable surrogate for human lumbar IVD cells, at least for in vitro studies.

Caveolin-1 is a structural protein required for the formation of 50-100 nm plasma membrane invaginations called caveolae that has also ascibed a role as a tumor suppressor in human cancer cells. However, mechanisms by which caveolin-1 functions in this manner remain unclear. In particular, no links to regulation of COX2 have been described.",

Likewise, over-expression of caveolin-1 in human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells also reduced COX2 mRNA and protein levels.

Roca Energy Metabolism and Nutrition Group, CIBER Fisiopatolog\u0131\u00e1 Obesidad y Nutricio\u00b4n, Instituto Salud Carlos III, University of Balearic Island, Palma de Mallorca, SPAIN Sex and thyroid hormones are among the factors modulating energy metabolism through regulation of mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) in old female rats has been shown to maintain, better than males, the ability to produce heat when exposed to cold. Considering the decline that takes place in gonadal and thyroid function during aging, the aim of this work was to test whether the age-related hormonal status may be a potential mediator of the gender differences in BAT decline. COX activity, UCP1, mitochondrial respiration rate, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), protein and levels of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c co-activator-1a (PGC-1 a) , as well as the serum levels of sex steroids (17 b-estradiol, progesterone and testosterone) and thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) were measured in 6-, 18-, and 24-month-old male and female rats kept at 22\u00b0C. Six-month-old female rats showed higher thermogenic features than males. Male rats at 18month showed a decrease in uncoupling activity compared to females. Both genders showed marked signs of atrophy in BAT of 24-monthold rats, characterized by a decrease in total DNA, mitochondrial protein, COX and UCP1, whereas mtDNA was found to increase. Sex steroids were well correlated with BAT parameters when both genders were considered, however, T3 was the hormone with the strongest positive correlations in female rats. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence suggesting that T3 may be a potential mediator of the sexual dimorphism in the effect of aging on the functional decline of BAT. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily. PPARs play an important role in diabetes and atherosclerosis. There is evidence that activation of PPAR c by specific ligands is able to suppress the growth of different types of human cancer by mechanisms including the growth arrest, apoptosis and induction of differentiation, although the detailed signaling pathways have not been completely elucidated. The aim of our study was to determine whether a novel PPAR a/d/c pan agonists, TIPP-703 (phenylpropanoic acid derivative) could affect the cell growth and expression of some cell cycle related proteins in pancreatic cancer cell lines panc-1 and PT45. MTT assay, flow cytometry and immunoblotting were used for detection of changes in cell growth. Treatment with TIPP-703 exhibited significant inhibition of cell proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cells as suggested by MTT assay. Addition of HX600, which is a RXR specific agonist, could enhance the growth inhibitory action. These results indicate the growth inhibitory effect by TIPP-703 on pancreatic cancer cells is occurred through PPAR receptors. During the process, TIPP-703 significantly elevated the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor protein p21Waf1/Cip1 level, and reduced cyclin D1. While cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor protein p27Kip1 level were not changed. Cell cycle analysis revealed a decreased proportion of cells in S phase, with arrest at G 0 /G 1 and the percentage of cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase was 90% by treatment of TIPP-703. TIPP-703 may be useful for arresting the growth of some pancreatic cancer cells. The glucocorticoid is a major subclass of steroid hormones that have potential effects of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive, autoimmune/allergic and lymphoproliferative functions. This hormone is mediated via an intracellular receptor, glucocorticoid receptor (GR). A human androgen response element (hARE), identified within intron 8 of the human sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage-activating protein, interacts with the both glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptors (AR). To get better relevant assay system, CMV-driven human GR (pCMV/hGR) and ARE-driven Luciferase reporter (ARE/Luc) were constructed and were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells. In parallel, these genes were also injected into the tail of mice. Subsequently, cells and mice were then treated with increasing concentrations of dexamethasone and its derivatives. Herein, we concluded that cells co-transfected with pCMV/hGR and ARE-TK/Luc showed a decrease in luciferase activity compared to those transfected with ARE/Luc alone. Moreover, co-injection of pCMV/hGR and ARE-TK/Luc gene into mice also resulted in a decrease in luciferase activity relative to that of ARE-TK/Luc gene alone. Thus, in vitro-cell system and in vivo mice model is useful in evaluating antagonists of GR using luciferase expression. These findings further suggest that this assay system allows screening of drug candidates affecting to a signal transduction pathway of the GR and AR and may help in the future discovery and analysis of novel and selection of GR and AR agonists.",

These isoforms are differentially targeted in plant cells to achieve specific regulatory functions. Differences in local environments affect CKX activity and dictate differences in modes of biochemical action on cytokinin substrates and electron acceptors. Most of the CKX isoforms are localized in apoplast or vacuole; there is generally only one CKX isoform per plant per species that lacks a translocation signal and presumably functions in cytosol. The best characterized CKX from maize is ZmCKX1, known to be secreted into the apoplast, while a gene encoding the non-secreted CKX has not been cloned before. The aims of this work were to clone the gene for non-secreted CKX from maize (nsZmCKX), compare its localization with the apoplastic ZmCKX1 and characterize its biochemical and structural properties. The gene for nsZmCKX was cloned successfully using the sequence information obtained from a survey of maize genome database. For determination of subcellular localization, the genes were fused with fluorescent markers (ZmCKX1:DsRed and nsZmCKX:GFP) and over-expressed in tomato hairy roots. Using confocal microscopy, ZmCKX1 signal was found in apoplast whereas nsZmCKX was detected in cytosol as predicted.

Bar-Sagi Department of Biochemistry, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA Ras GTPases are key regulators of cell growth, differentiation and transformation. Ubiquitination of Ras modulates its intracellular trafficking and signaling output. Yet, the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of this modification remain poorly understood. Here, we took advantage of the Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) technology to monitor HRas ubiquitination in living cells and to investigate its relationship to membrane microdomain compartmentalization and oncogenic transformation. We demonstrate that a HRas chimera unable to interact with Caveolin1 is refractory to ubiquitination, indicating that HRas ubiquitination depends on the association with Caveolin1. Consistent with this observation, disruption of lipid microdomains by membrane cholesterol depletion inhibits HRas ubiquitination. The requirement of the integrity of caveolae and Caveolin1 for HRas ubiqutination is futher supported by the observation that the extent of HRas ubiquitination is dependent on Caveolin1 expression levels. Thus, knockdown of endogenous Caveolin1 suppresses ubiquitination of HRas. Conversely, ectopic expression of Caveolin1 leads to an increase in overall ubiquitinated HRas. The ectopic expression of Caveolin1 also inhibits the transforming activity of HRas but does not affect the transforming activity of an ubiquitination-deficient HRas mutant, indicating that Caveolin1 suppresses cell transformation by regulating HRas ubiquitination. Taken together, our data identify HRas ubiquitination as a mechanism by which Caveolin1 can suppress oncogenic transformation. Results: We compared the effects of exposure of bTC-6 cells to intermediate-5 mM, and high-25 mM glucose concentrations with exposure to 1 mM glucose as the appropriate control. We demonstrated that prolonged exposure of bTC-6 cells to increased glucose concentrations resulted in a significant inhibition of insulin signalling, including the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-2 as well as the activation of IRS-2-associated PI3-kinase. These changes were also reflected in severe impairment of the sequential Akt-mediated inactivation of FoxO. Glucose-induced down-regulation of IRS-2/Akt/FoxO-mediated signalling was associated with increased IL-1b and SOCS-1 expression. Up-regulation of endogenous cytokine signalling coincided with enhanced caspase-3 activation and increased susceptibility of bTC-6 cells to apoptosis.",

The PTN induced production of HP was blocked by NAD(P)H oxidase, but not xanthine oxidase inhibitors, suggesting that superoxide is probably the initial ROS produced by PTN . In addition, apocynin completely abolished the stimulatory effect of PTN in migration of both HUVEC and LNCaP. L-Dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) is a pyridoxal (PLP) requiring enzyme, which catalyzes the decarboxylation of L-Dopa to dopamine and 5hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) to serotonin. Ddc is found in all aminergic cells in the central and peripheral neurotransmitter systems, as well as in peripheral organs. Ddc is generally considered to be a cytosolic enzyme. However, new evidence indicates the association of the molecule with the membranes. The mRNA transcript encoding for the enzyme has been shown to undergo alternative splicing within its 5'-UTR, as well as in its coding region. Ddc has been implicated in the pathology of neoplastic, neurological and psychiatric disorders. Membrane fraction of K293 cells was prepared as described by Poulikakos, et al., 2001. Membrane-bound Ddc was released into the soluble fraction, following incubation at 37\u00b0C. The observed release was pH and time dependent (pH 5.5/20 minutes). Ddc solubilization was inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitors iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), as well as by the serine protease inhibitor leupeptin, whereas aprotinin had no effect in this phenomenon.

OxLDL phagocytosis leads to foam cell formation. The monocyte exposure to oxLDL and oxLDL binding to CD36 activates Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors c (PPAR-c) transcription. Hormones related to diabetes, like insulin or glucose; activate atherosclerosis-related monocyte functions. In the present study, the effect of high glucose concentrations and PPAR-c activators (rosiglitazone) in atherosclerosis-related functions of human monocytes was investigated. The atherosclerosisrelated functions studied were monocyte adhesion and migration through laminin, collagen type IV or endothelial cells, CD36 expression and oxLDL phagocytosis. We used the inhibitors: cariporide (the inhibitor of Na + /H + exchanger), Go (the inhibitor of PKCa and PKCb isoforms), Gf (the inhibitor of all PKC isoforms) and wortmanin (inhibitor of PI3K) and puromycin (protein synthesis inhibitor). The data of the present study suggests that PPARc activation in monocytes induces atherosclerosis, and that Na + /H + exchanger plays an important role in the beginning of atherosclerosis. The addition of Go, Gf and wortmanin also reversed the effect of glucose or rosiglitazone, indicating the involvement of PKC isoforms and PI3K in the signal transduction leading to atherosclerosis-related functions of monocytes. Besides, puromycin treatment indicated that the increase in the number of CD36 receptors can be attributed to CD36 mRNA transcription. Introduction: Intracellular protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system releases large amounts of oligopeptides within cells. To evaluate a possible intracellular function of oligopeptides we introduced them into cells fused to a cationic TAT peptide sequence through reversible disulfide bonds. Methods and Results: A mixture containing four of these peptides (20-80 lM) significantly inhibited the increase in extracellular acidification response triggered by angiotensin II (ang II) in CHO-S cells transfected with the ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R-CHO-S). Either in a mixture or alone, these peptides increased luciferase gene transcription in AT1R-CHO-S cells stimulated with ang II and in HEK293 cells treated with isoproterenol. None of the peptides affected GPCR cellular responses without been fused to the TAT sequence, suggesting an effect from the intracellular milieu on GPCR signal transduction. All four functional peptides were shown to interact with thimet-oligopeptidase and three were PKC substrates in vitro.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric bHLH-PAS transcription factor responsible for the regulation of a large group of genes mediating the adaptive response to hypoxia. Its inducible subunit, HIF-1a, is controlled by oxygen levels and major signaling pathways, such as PI3-K and MAPK. We have previously shown that p44/ 42 MAPK phosphorylates two Ser residues in the C-terminal domain of HIF-1a and stimulates its transcriptional activity by inhibiting its CRM1-dependent nuclear export (1). Additionally, a second, distinct from MAPK, HeLa nuclear kinase modifies the N-terminal part (amino acids 1-251) of HIF-1a. In order to characterize the phosphorylation and elucidate its function, smaller parts of the bHLH and PAS domains of HIF-1a were expressed as GST-fusions in E. coli, purified and subjected to phosphorylation assays in vitro using HeLa nuclear extracts as a kinase source. Site directed mutagenesis was then used to identify a candidate phosphoacceptor site in the HIF-1a PAS-B domain, which is involved in heterodimerization and/or interaction with Hsp90. The significance of this modification for the activity of HIF-1a is currently under investigation using both yeast and mammalian expression systems. Introduction: Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hormone primarily involved in erythropoiesis but dotted equally with an array of autocrine/paracrine effects. EPO can regulate major cell functions of normal and cancer cell types including breast cancer, a steroid hormone dependent neoplasm. Steroid effects can be nuclear-and/or membrane-initiated, with the latter depending, among others, to a cross-linking with various growth factor receptors. In breast cancer specimens we have reported a correlation of erythropoietin, its receptor (EPOR) and membrane androgen sites. Here we further explore this interaction and the possible mechanism involved.

They have high procoagulant activity, what suggests their importance for thrombosis and/or hemostasis, although their exact function is not presently clear. The aim of the study was to determine the role of platelet secretion in the signalling pathways leading to coated platelets formation.

Addition of aspirin and thromboxane A2 analog U46619 had no effect indicating that cyclooxigenase has no role in coated platelet formation. Addition of apyrase dose-dependently decreased the size of coated platelets subpopulation, while addition of ADP increases it. It allowed supposing that appearance of coated platelets is regulated through purinergic receptors. To identify the responsible purinergic receptor, specific antagonists for the receptors P2Y1, P2Y12 and P2X1 were used. We found that antagonists of P2Y1 and P2X1 had no effects, while antagonist of P2Y12 inhibited coated platelet formation. This suggested a central role of purinergic receptor P2Y12 in the development of ADP effect. Conclusions: ADP plays an important role in the regulation of coated platelets formation, and its action is mediated by the P2Y12 receptor.

Tamoxifen is an antagonist of estrogen receptor, which is used widely as an breast cancer drug that blocks estradiol binding to estrogen receptor and shut down growth signals. Thus, tamoxifen-treated breast cancer cells finally provoke apoptosis. However, recent studies revealed rather confusing results that tamoxifen induces apoptosis even in estrogen receptor-negative cells. In the present study, we synthesized several tamoxifen derivatives to augment the apoptosis-inducing effect of tamoxifen and evaluated the estrogen receptor-negative apoptosis-inducing pathway. The estrogen receptor-positive human leukemia cell line HL-60 and estrogen receptor-negative human leukemia cell line Jurkat were treated with tamoxifen and synthesized tamoxifen derivatives, and thereafter subjected to cell viability-detection assays. Tamoxifen derivatives, as well as the lead compound tamoxifen, decreased the cell viability despite the expression of estrogen receptor. Among all of the synthesized tamoxifen derivatives, ridaifen-B had more potent Jurkat cell-damaging activity. Ridaifen-B had about 8times potent than tamoxifen. Ridaifen-B fragmented Jurkat cell DNA and activated caspase-3, -8, and -9, suggesting that the ridaifen-B-induced apoptosis pathway is estrogen receptor independent. Moreover, mitochondrial involvement during ridaifen-B-induced apoptosis was estimated. Ridaifen-B significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibited ridaifen-B-induced apoptosis phenomenon (DNA fragmentation, caspases activation, and loss of mitochondrial integrity). These results suggest that the induction of apoptosis by ridaifen-B is dependent on mitochondrial perturbation without estrogen receptor involvement.",

Whereas the classical Rho GTPases are regulated by GDP/GTP cycling, in some cases transcriptional regulation plays also a crucial role in their function. In the present study we show that TGFb increases the steady state mRNA levels of the RhoB gene in HaCaT keratinocytes. Treatment of HaCaT cells with actinomycin D or cycloheximide, showed that activation of the RhoB gene by TGFb occurs at the transcriptional level and that RhoB is a direct target of TGFb-induced signaling pathways. The early transcriptional activation of RhoB gene by TGFb was abolished using a specific MEK1 kinase inhibitor suggesting the involvement of the MEK/ERK pathway in this process. The late activation of RhoB was abolished by an inhibitor of the Type I TGFb receptor (ALK5) indicating the participation of the Smad pathway in RhoB gene regulation by TGFb. By constructing sequential deletion mutants and using transactivation assays, we established that the proximal region of the human RhoB promoter is required for transcriptional activation by the Smads. DNA affinity precipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the recruitment of Smad3 to the proximal RhoB promoter. Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) shown previously to mediate activation of the RhoB gene by genotoxic stress was not found to serve as a Smad cofactor in RhoB gene regulation. Our findings establish RhoB as a direct transcriptional target of TGFb in human keratinocytes and reveal the TGFb-induced signaling pathways that participate in this regulation.",

Tanaka Department of Metabolic Regulation, Institute on Aging and Adaptation, Shinshu University Graduate School of Medicine, Matsumoto, JAPAN Persistent infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) can lead to a high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCV core protein plays important roles in HCV-related hepatocarcinogenesis, because mice carrying the core protein exhibit multicentric HCCs without hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. However, the precise mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis in these transgenic mice remains unclear. To evaluate whether the core protein modulates hepatocyte proliferation and/or apoptosis, we examined these parameters in 9-and 22month-old transgenic mice. Although the numbers of apoptotic hepatocytes were similar between transgenic and non-transgenic mice, the numbers of proliferating hepatocytes and the levels of numerous proteins such as cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, and c-Myc, were markedly increased in an age-dependent manner in the transgenic mice. This increase was correlated with the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa), which was closely associated with hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents. In these transgenic mice, spontaneous and persistent PPARa activation occurred heterogeneously, which was different from that observed in mice treated with clofibrate, a potent PPARa activator. We further demonstrated that stabilization of PPARa through a possible interaction with HCV core protein and an increase in nonesterified fatty acids, which may serve as endogenous PPARa ligands, in hepatocyte nuclei contributed to the core protein-specific PPARa activation. In conclusion, these results offer the first suggestion that HCV core protein induces spontaneous, persistent, agedependent, and heterogeneous activation of PPARa in transgenic mice, which may contribute to the age-dependent and multicentric hepatocarcinogenesis mediated by the core protein.",

Elevated blood glucose and free fatty acids induce oxidative stress associated with incidence of cardiovascular disease. In contrast, laminar shear stress (LSS) plays a critical role in vascular health by inhibiting many inflammatory events triggered by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The present study examined how high glucose (HG) and arachidonic acid (AA) induce lipid peroxidation, and whether LSS attenuates lipid peroxidation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. HG and AA synergistically induced lipid peroxidation, which was attenuated by inhibitors blocking ROS sources as well as by glutathione (GSH) and its precursors. Of special interest, lipid peroxidation was inhibited by L-NAME, a specific inhibitor of NO synthase, implicating 'uncoupled' eNOS might mediate lipid peroxidation by producing ROS instead of NO. In consistent with this notion, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor of NO synthase markedly inhibited lipid peroxidation. LSS also appeared to be a strong inhibitor of lipid peroxidation supporting its vascular protective role. It also increased cellular level of BH4 and GSH content. Inhibition of GSH synthesis by BSO and si-RNA-mediated knockdown of Glutamylcysteine ligase modulatory subunit reduced inhibitory effect of laminar shear stress on lipid peroxidation. Therefore it is suggested that LSS enhances antioxidant capacity of endothelial cells, thereby attenuates oxidative stress caused by cardiovascular risk factors.

            "text": "PP7C-9 Investigation of hepcidin secretion in human hepatocytes Iron homeostasis depends on iron absorption and trafficking between plasma and the body reservoirs. Hepcidin, an antimicrobial hepatic hormone, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of iron metabolism by directly controlling both intestinal iron absorption and iron release from macrophages. The hepcidin gene is coding for a pre-prohormone, further processed to a mature form of 20 or 25 amino acids which is secreted to the circulation. However, although hepcidin expression is controlled by diverse stimuli, including hypoxia mimetic agents, it is not known if the prohepcidin maturation process and secretion is posttranslationally regulated. In order to investigate the hepcidin secretion pathway, Huh7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid pEGFP-N3-hepcidin leading to over-expression of pre-prohepcidin tagged at the C-terminus with GFP. By western blot analysis we detected at least two intracellular forms of hepcidin-GFP, while one distinct form appeared to the culture supernatant. Moreover, as shown by fluorescence microscopy, hepcidin-GFP was confined to cytoplasmic structures reminiscent of organelles of the secretory pathway such as endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Treatment of cells with brefeldin A (which disrupts the Golgi complex) restrained hepcidin-GFP inside the cells. These data suggest that hepcidin-GFP is stable and can be actively processed and secreted by hepatocytes, providing a model for the analysis of hepcidin maturation. We, therefore, established stably transfected Huh7 cell lines expressing hepcidin-GFP. These cell lines are currently used, in combination with specific markers and inhibitors of the secretion machinery, to study trafficking of prohepcidin and its regulation by factors affecting iron homeostasis. Introduction: M3/6 is a dual-specificity protein phosphatase whose main substrate is the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). JNK is phosphorylated and activated in response to various extracellular stimuli, including stress factors such as arsenite. Dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK by the M3/6 phosphatase is important for the cellular response to stress. It has been shown that M3/6 itself is phosphorylated by JNK upon stimulation with arsenite. The aim of the project is to investigate the effect of this phosphorylation on the activity of M3/6 and its importance for JNK signaling. Methods: Mass spectrometry was used to map phosphorylated sites on M3/6. These sites were mutated using site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant and wildtype proteins were compared upon arsenite stimulation in transiently transfected cells for their phosphorylation and for their ability to inactivate the JNK pathway.",

Despite progress in detection and chemotherapy, many women with breast cancer continue to die of this malignancy. Elevated expression of c-Myc is frequently observed and androgens are known to inhibit its growth but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in large part of breast tumors or normal mammary gland and only limited number of breast cancer cell lines express both estrogen (ER) and AR receptors. We were investigating the role of hormones and c-myc in proliferation (crystal violet assay) and AR, ER, bcl-2, bax, Cyclin D1, c-myc, p27, pRb, cdk2 expression in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D) at protein level. The cells were transfected with the small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting cmyc to reduce its expression (Ambion) and treated by 5alfa-dihydrotestosteron (DHT) or estradiol (E2). T47D cell line express ER and AR and is sensitive to E2 and DHT but MCF-7 express only ER and does not respond to DHT treatment. DHT caused also an accumulation of inhibitor p27. Silencing of c-myc expression reduced its expression in both cell lines up to 85% and decreased the proliferation of cells while promoting apoptosis (Caspase activity kit, bax, bcl-2) The inhibition of breast cancer cell growth by androgen seems to be mediated by p27 and decreasing the c-Myc protein level plays a principal in progression of human breast cancer. N9 microglial cells were activated by LPS and APC was added 1 hour before LPS stimulation. We performed lactate dehydrogenase assay to evaluate LPS-induced glial cell death. TNF-a levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: We found that LPS induced activation of glial cell death and pretreatment with APC attenuated microglial cell death in a dose dependent manner. ELISA revealed that APC also decreased LPSinduced TNF-a production in a dose-dependent manner. Introduction: Inflammation is considered as one of the factors responsible for b-cell death observed in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). ROL may mediate some of its anti-inflammatory effects by blocking nitric oxide (NO) production by macrophages, through elevation of intracellular cAMP level. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether ROL can improve nitrosative stress and inflammation of pancreatic islet in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in rats. Methods: Adult Wistar male rats were divided into three groups: control group, STZ induced-diabetic rats and STZ-induced diabetic rats treated with ROL (10.5 mg/kg) over a period of one week. The degree of insulitis was evaluated histochemically. The islets beta-cell function was estimated immunohistochemically by measuring insulin content of cells using anti-insulin antibodies. Nitrosative stress was evaluated immunohistochemically by measuring nitrated proteins by using antibodies against 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT).",

In order to determine a possible participation of arginine -NO -dependent mechanisms of regulating the renal activity, runs of experiments were carried out with a multiple -dose introduction (7 days) to rats of arginine (100 mg/kg) which is a biological substrate and activator for the formation of NO, as well as a simultaneous use of L-arginine and Thiotreazolin . The experiments were run under conditions of functional loading on the kidneys which was carried out via introducing running water into the rat stomach in an amount, constituting 5% of the body mass. L-arginine exerts an influence primarily on the vasculoglomerular apparatus of the nephron, an activation of the mechanism of glomerulo-tubular balance taking place under its action at that an elevation of the filtration load of nephrons with sodium ions by an adequate intensification of their transport in the proximal tubules in case of the activation of sodium -dependent mechanisms of urine acidification. A combined use of Thiotreazolin and L-arginine in case of water load are indicative of the fact that the renal effects of Thiotreazolin do not have a direct dependence on the NO formation in the kidneys. On the contrary, a well-known antioxidant action of Thiotreazolin, probably, blocks NO-dependent intrarenal generation of angiotensin II, favouring the diuretic and natriuretic effects of the drug under study. Methods: Cell viability was tested by MTT test. Type of cell death was determined by AnnexinV-FITC/propidium iodide kit.

Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) plays an important role in integrin signaling and its kinase activity is modulated by cell-extracellular matrix. Migration of melanoma cells is dependent on alpha3 beta1 integrin, which binds laminin 5 and regulates the MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity. It was suggested that activation of AKT kinase through PI3-K plays a key role in response to LN-5 signals carried through specific integrin involved in melanoma metastasis. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is known to phosphorylate AKT upon integrins activation. Our study identifies the mechanism through which AKT can regulate melanoma cell invasion properties via signaling that is independent of FAK and involves ILK. Studies were carried out on human melanoma cell lines. Secretion of metalloproteinases was analyzed by zymography, and the invasive potential by using Boyden chambers. Expression of cell signaling proteins (AKT, pAKT, ILK, pFAK), was analyzed using western blot, siRNA transfection for ILK and AKT (Ambion). We showed, that silencing of ILK, inhibited the effects of Ln-5 on AKT activation, suggesting a regulatory role of ILK in signaling pathway involved in melanoma invasion. We were also able to show that silencing of ILK gene expression by siRNA process significantly inhibits in vitro invasion of melanoma cells. These results indicate on ILK as critical mediator in signaling pathway necessary for melanoma cell migration and invasion.

SkQR1 specifically accumulates in mitochondria of the cell due to it positive charge and effectively protects cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death induced by prooxidants (hydrogen peroxide, paraquat and menadione). Uncoupler FCCP which reduces mitochondrial membrane potential prevents accumulation of SkQR1 and abolishes its protective effect. The role of multidrug resistance (MDR) pump in transport of SkQR1 was studied in breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells and erythroleukemia K562 cells with high level of P-glycoprotein selected by doxorubicin cultivation. The inhibitors of P-glycoprotein verapamil and pluronic stimulate accumulation and inhibit the release of SkQR1 in these clones but not in original MCF-7 and K562 cells. These inhibitors stimulate accumulation of SkQR1 in HeLa cells and were less effective in normal human fibroblasts. SkQR1 protects MDR-negative cells against prooxidants at low concentrations (2-20 nM) and was less effective in the cells with high level of MDR. The inhibitors of P-glycoprotein improve the protective action of SkQR1. The same effect was observed with an analog of SkQR1 where decylrhodamine was replaced by decyltriphenylphosphonium (SkQ1). It is suggested that these MTA could serve as the protective agents in chemo-and radiotherapy of MDR-positive tumors.",

MAPK phosphatases (MKPs), the key regulators of MAPK activity, are classified as a subgroup of DSPs. In Drosophila six DSPs have been identified, of which Puckered, DMKP1 and DMKP3 have been characterized as MKPs. Basket, the Drosophila homologue of JNK, has been shown to be the substrate of Puckered. The physiological role of Puckered in development is well established, contrary to its role in adult flies, which remains obscure. In this study we address the role of Puckered in the adult Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). Methods: The UAS/GAL4 system was used for expression of reporter genes, disruption of neurotransmission and induction of gene silencing by RNA interference, in a tissue specific manner. Temporal control on the UAS/GAL4 system was achieved upon introduction of the inducible GAL4 suppressor, GAL80. Whole mount tissue preparations were immunostained and pictures were obtained by confocal microscopy. RNA extraction and subsequent RT-PCR was performed. A polyclonal antibody against Puckered was raised, affinity purified and used for Puckered characterization. Lung cancer is one of the most insidious and aggressive neoplasm, and consequently early diagnosis is very critical for clinical outcome and prognosis. It is necessary to discover biomarkers for early detection and prognostic evaluation of lung cancer. The proteins, levels of which are differentially high in the serum of cancer patients can be applicable to the cancer biomarker. For screening candidate potential lung cancer serum biomarkers, we investigated the protein differentially secreted from the transformed lung cell (1198 and 1170I) compared to immortalized normal bronchial cells (Beas-2B) and non-transformed cells derived from Beas-2B treated with beeswax (1799). The proteins were recovered from the conditioned media by TCA precipitation and separated on two-dimensional gel. There was not much difference between 2D patterns of the proteins from Beas-2B and 1799 cells, whereas there was significant difference between the patterns of transformed cells and Beas-2B. Using mass spectrometry and database search, we identified PGP9.5 (UCH-L1), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), PSMA 3, proteasome activator subunit Reg, TPI, and TCTP among the proteins increased simultaneously in conditioned media of 1198 and 1170I cells.s By means of western blot analysis, we validated that levels of PGP 9.5, TPI, TCTP and TIMP-2 were significantly high not only in the conditioned media of 1198 and 1170I cells compared to those of Beas-2B and 1799 cells, but also in the serum of lung cancer patients compared to normal serum.

The new mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1 (plastoquinone conjugated with decyltriphenylphosphonium) was designed in our laboratory. In isolated mitochondria SkQ1 demonstrated higher antioxidant efficiency then prototypic MitoQ (ubiquinone conjugated with decyltriphenylphosphonium). Fluorescent analog of SkQ1 (SkQR1) accumulated in mitochondria of normal human fibroblasts and various transformed cell lines. SkQ1 and SkQR1 protected the cells at concentrations 2-20 nM when cells were preincubated for 6-7 days. MitoQ was less effective. By the other hand accumulation of SkQR1 in the cells was completed in 1-2 hours. We haven't observed any protection against oxidative stress induced by H 2 O 2 or the other pro-oxidants (menadione, paraquat) in this conditions. MitoQ and SkQ1 also were ineffective. Sub-toxic H 2 O 2 stopped cell cycle of HeLa cells in G2/Mphase and this effect was insensitive to mitochondria-targeted antioxidants as well. The increase of the antioxidants concentration in the range 0.1-1 lM revealed their pro-oxidant properties. In combination with sub-toxic H 2 O 2 these antioxidants caused significant ROS production and cell death. Cationic part was at least partially responsible for this effect since decyltriphenylphosphonium also promoted oxidative stress under these conditions. Probably this effect is related to damage of the mitochondrial membrane due to detergent action. We have suggested that SkQ1 did not accumulate in all mitochondria during short incubation probably due to heterogeneity of the membrane potential. Some mitochondria remained unprotected and initiated ROS production and apoptosis under oxidative stress. Prolonged incubation provided complete protection of mitochondrial population. Introduction: Estrogens play important roles in the development and growth of breast cancer. Although, the action of estradiol (E2) to estrogen receptors (ERa/ERb) and the regulation of target gene transcription is well defined, its involvement in synthesis of matrix is not clearly defined. Studies in our lab indicate that differential gene expression of effective matrix macromolecules, including proteoglycans (PGs) from epithelial breast cancer cells, is associated with malignant phenotype. The aim of this study was, therefore, to examine whether E2 affects the expression of PGs implicated in breast cancer, and whether this is associated with ERs. Introduction: Many physiological and pathophysiological processes are related to changes in cellular level of diadenosine polyphosphates and the most significant is the concentration rate of Ap 3 A to Ap 4 A [1] . Ap 3 A is cleaved by tumor suppressor Fhit protein, one of the enzymes of hydrolases family. It is assumed that the formation of the FhitAp 3 A complex, recognized as a signaling molecule [2] , induces cell apoptosis. Therefore, analogs of Ap 3 A may be of interest as potential therapeutic molecules. The aim of our studies was to determine the cellular uptake of the fluorescent nonhydrolyzable analog of Ap n A (Fl-Ap 3 A analog), which is an analog of inhibitor of Fhit protein [3] . Methods: We used various conditions (with and without Lipofectamine 2000 carrier; concentration from 2.5 to 10 lM) to study the transport of this compound across membrane in A549 and HUVEC cells.

From this point of view, there has been an interest in the production of soluble stable forms of this membrane protein for their potential use in immune therapies. Methods: DNA fragment coding for the extracellular part of CD69 has been amplified by PCR, and transferred to Pichia expression vector pPICZalphaA. Normal and 'humanized' Pichia pastoris (X33) were transfected with linearized plasmid. The production of CD69 was induced by Methanol (0.5%). Culture medium was concentrated and protein was purified on Q-Sepharose column. Biochemical stability was monitored for 7 days by SDS-PAGE. Chair of Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical College, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, POLAND, 2 Chair of Medical Biochemistry, Medical College, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, POLAND, 3 Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Virology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, POLAND Introduction: High glutathione (GSH) level and elevated gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) activity are hallmarks of tumor cells. Toxicity of drugs and radiation to the cells is largely dependent on the level of thiols. Despite well-documented antioxidant action of GSH, under certain conditions GSH/GGT system can produce a moderate oxidative stress, which is a component of signal transduction in the processes of proliferation and apoptosis. In the present studies, we attempted to inhibit GGT activity in human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells in order to examine whether the administration of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) influences cell proliferation and enhances cytostatic action of doxorubicin (DOX) on HepG2 cells. Methods: To find mechanism of the gamma-glutamyl cycle enzymes inhibition we've measure enzymatic activity of GGT, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthase, glutathione synthase and glutathione S-transferase. We also perform Western Blot and RT-PCR analysis. The effects of this TIQ were determined by MTT, BrdU and LDH tests and by estimation of GSH and ROS levels. Additionally, we investigated the changes in caspase-3 activity, which is a marker of apoptosis. Results: The obtained results showed that the GGT inhibitor introduced to the medium alone elicited cytotoxic effect, which was accompanied by an increase in glutathione level in the cells. TIQ concomitantly increased caspase-3 activity. Doxorubicin proved to be cytotoxic, and TIQ augmented this effect. As well doxorubicin radically decreased GSH levels. We also show that HepG2 cells characterized lack of glutathione S-transferase. Conclusions: Therefore, the obtained results confirm that GGT inhibitor can enhance pharmacological action of doxorubicin, which may permit clinicians to decrease their doses thereby alleviating side effects.",

Emerging evidences suggest, that activity of GGT is connected with H 2 O 2 production. The presented studies aimed to elucidate how modulation of GGT activity influences H 2 O 2 production in connection with protein S-thiolation and caspase 3 activity. Methods: H 2 O 2 production was measured using Amplex red hydrogen peroxide assay kit, and caspase 3 activity by fluorimetric assay with Ac-DEVD-AMC as a substrate.

After 24-hour stimulation, hydrogen peroxide concentration was at the control level, while Cys-Gly, Cys and GSH dependent S-thiolation was markedly increased, which was accompanied by a drop in caspase-3 activity. The inhibition of GGT by acivicin led to hydrogen peroxide decrease after 1 hour incubation which still persisted after 24 hours. The inhibition of GGT activity in HepG2 cells in this case was connected with the lowering of S-thiolation with Cys and Cys-Gly. Conclusions: The results of these studies indicate that the modulation of GGT activity in HepG2 cells can be connected with oxidative stress and S-thiolation, what can influence activity of caspase 3. It confirms the hypotesis that the prooxidant reactions induced by GSH catabolism appear to represent a novel mechanism for modulation of cellular signal transduction. Here, we show that treatment with subtoxic doses of Wit A in combination with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in human renal cancer cells, but not in human normal mesangial cells, suggesting that this combined treatment may offer an attractive strategy for safely treating renal cancer. Wit A treatment up-regulated DR5, a death receptor of TRAIL, in a transcription factor CHOP-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment with Wit A down-regulated the antiapoptotic proteins such as c-FLIP L and c-FLIPs at transcriptional levels through ROS signaling pathways. The lessened c-FLIP expression levels induced by Wit A were recovered by NAC pretreatment and ectopic expression of p65 plus p50. In addition, Withafein A-induced down-regulation of c-FLIP was more enhanced by TRAIL treatment via cleavage of p65 through caspase activation. Taken together, our results show that the activity of Wit A to modulate multiple components in the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway is responsible for its ability to sensitize to TRAIL in renal cancer cells.

Regulators of G protein Signalling (RGS) constitute a family of proteins that accelerate GTP hydrolysis of Ga protein subunit and act as effector antagonists or scaffolds to recruit cytoplasmic proteins to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Recent observations from our laboratory have shown that RGS4 directly interacts with the third intracellular loop (i3L) and the C-terminal tail (CT) of l-and d-opioid receptors (l-OR and d-OR), and promotes the formation of ternary complexes between RGS4, Ga subunits and the l-opioid receptor Cterminal (l-CT) [1] . Based on these observations, we sought to determine i) a consensus motif within l-CT and d-CT which is responsible for RGS4 binding and ii) define the role of the N-terminal domain of RGS4 for opioid receptor interaction and signalling regulation. In vitro pulldown experiments using recombinant proteins encompassing truncated versions of l-CT and d-CT have shown for the first time that the juxtamembrane domain, forming helix VIII, of l-CT and d-CT is responsible for RGS4 and RGS4-Ga complex interaction. Consequent co-immunoprecipitation studies have shown that RGS4 confers selectivity to ORs for binding to activated Gai subunits. Introduction: Excitotoxicity and programmed cell death caused by hyperactivation of NMDA receptor are associated with stroke, brain trauma and play essential role in neuronal loss. It becomes evident that cell death realizes through distinctive and mutually exclusive signal transduction pathways in the certain areas of stroke. In present study we assessed a signaling role of NMDA receptor and main sources of energy in cell (oxygen and glucose) in programmed cell death mechanism, and an ability of glycine to prevent such neuronal degeneration. We were especially interested in possible differential effects of glycine under certain conditions. Results: Brain cortex slices were exposed to anoxia in the presents of 5 mM glucose. DNA internucleosomal fragmentation, an apoptosis hallmark, was detected after 24 hours of incubation. However caspase-3 activation and cytochrome release was not observed. DNA internucleosomal fragmentation was prevented by 5 mM glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, and 10 lM of MK-801 (non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors). These effects revealed that cell death was mediated via activation of NMDA receptor. Contrariwise, 30 minutes of anoxia followed by 24 hours of reoxygenation caused DNA internucleosomal fragmentation accompanied by cytochrome release and caspase-3 activation. At the same time cell death was prevented neither by MK-801 nor by glycine. Necrosis has been observed in the absence of oxygen and glucose. Conclusion: We conclude that concentrations of oxygen and glucose are the crucial factors in determination of cell death pathway. Glycine is a specific inhibitor of apoptosis induced by NMDA mediated excitotoxicity.",

Because the current GPCR assays, limited to the evaluation of selective Galpha activation, are not allowed the comprehensive pathway prediction and high-throughput screening for any given GPCR, two novel approaches were proposed below. It is known that adenylyl cyclases are directly activated by G(s)alpha and the carboxyl termini of the various Galpha proteins determine their receptor coupling specificities. To reflect the previous uncharacterized pathways of GPCRs, a set of chimeric G(s)alpha where the C-terminal five amino acids were replaced by those of other Galpha proteins was constructed. Two neuromedin U receptors, NMUR1 and NMUR2, were tested using chimeric G(s)alpha for the differentiation of their uncharacterized pathways. In contrast to the G(q) signals mainly conducted by NMUR1, NMUR2 routed preferentially to the G(i) pathways. Further, of, a chimeric reporter plasmid, incorporating cAMP response elements, serum response elements and a chimeric G(qi), was designed to cover G(s)alpha, G(q)alpha, G(12)alpha and G(i)alpha multiple pathways for the screening of ligand-receptor interaction. The constructed plasmid was able to multiply the intensity of reporter signals derived from the activation of NMUR1 or NMUR2. Further cell-line selection with our reporter construct will advance the high-throughput screening of orphan GPCRs. . NMDA receptor hypofunction can be modulated by NMDA receptor agonists and glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors. The aim of this study was to reveal the effects of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone and the GlyT1 inhibitor NFPS to extracellular levels of dopamine, its metabolites and amino acids (glycine, serine, glutamate) in rat striatum after intraperitoneal administration of the drugs. Methods: Extracellular biogenic amine and amino acid concentrations were determined by using microdialysis technique in rat striatum. Dopamine, its metabolites and amino acids were estimated by using HPLC/electrochemical detection. Results: Risperidone increased the synaptic concentration of dopamine in microdialysis but failed to influence the extracellular concentrations of the amino acids measured. Glycine concentration in the vicinity NMDA receptors is regulated by GlyT1. Its inhibition by NFPS led to increased glycine level in the extracellular space but the concentrations of other amino acids were not altered.",

Mitochondria are important transducers of signal leading to hyperthermic cell injury. We show that the response of liver mitochondria (LM) to hyperthermia is gender-dependent. Fever temperature activated state 3 respiration (V3) in LM from the female rat but strongly (by 26 percents at 41\u00b0C) inhibited V3 in male LM. Female LM V3 at 44\u00b0C was not different from that at 37\u00b0C; inhibition (by 14 percents) was induced only by 44\u00b0C (then V3 in male LM was inhibited by 39 percents). However, hyperthermia induced uncoupling was much stronger in female LM. The respiratory chain in male LM is more sensitive to hyperthermia than in female LM, but temperature induced increase in membrane permeability to ions is much larger in female LM. The difference is very obviously pronounced in the supra-physiological range of temperature (42-46oC) commonly used for hyperthermic cancer treatment. Our data imply that gender specific differences and the impact of temperature induced changes in the membrane structure are yet underestimated in the understanding of signaling networks that determine cellular elimination or survival under hyperthermic stress. Microglial cells are the prime effectors in immune and inflammatory responses of the CNS. During pathological conditions, the activation of these cells helps restore CNS homeostasis. However, chronic microglial activation endangers neuronal survival through the release of various proinflammatory molecules and neurotoxins. Thus, negative regulators of microglial activation have been considered as potential therapeutic candidates to target neurodegeneration, such as that in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Shikonin, a naphthoquinone pigment from the root of Lithospermum erythrorhizon has been reported to have antibacterial, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to examine whether shikonin represses microglial activation. In a study of shikonin and five of its derivatives, isobutyrylshikonin (IBS) and isovalerylshikonin (IVS) were the most effective at inhibiting LPS-induced NO release from microglial cells. RT/real-time PCR analysis revealed that pretreatment of rat brain microglia with IBS and IVS attenuated the LPS-induced expression of mRNAs encoding iNOS, TNF-a, IL-1b, and COX-2. In rat brain microglia, IBS and IVS reduced the LPS-stimulated production of TNF-a and PGE 2 . In addition, IBS and IVS significantly decreased LPS-induced IjB-a phosphorylation and NF-jB DNA binding activity, as well as the phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 and Akt signaling proteins. In organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, PI staining revealed prominent cell death in the hippocampal layer after 72 hours of LPS treatment. Both IBS and IVS clearly blocked the effect of LPS on hippocampal cell death and NO production. These results suggest that IBS and IVS provide neuroprotection by suppressing the proinflammatory pathways from activated microglia.",

PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase-A2 (Lp-PLA 2 ) catabolize PAF. Methods: Twelve male newly diagnosed HF patients (63 \u00b1 10.2 years, 83% ischemic) were hospitalized and followed up for 6 weeks. PAF was determined with bioassay. Leukocyte lyso-PAF-AT and PAF-CPT were assayed by the produced PAF. Leukocyte PAF-AH and serum Lp-PLA 2 were determined by the trichloroacetic acid method. Immunonephelometry and ELISA were used for CRP and IL-6 measurements, respectively. For statistical analysis Spearman and Wilcoxon tests were used. Results: Baseline median activities of lyso-PAF-AT, PAF-CPT, PAF-AH and Lp-PLA 2 were 4.1, 68.42, 644.44 pmol/min/mg protein and 51.42 pmol/min/ll serum, correspondingly.

In the follow-up, PAF levels and the activity of biosynthetic enzymes increased, leukocyte PAF-AH remained stable while Lp-PLA 2 decreased. Conclusions: A correlation of PAF-CPT to inflammatory indices was firstly documented. The increase in PAF levels and its biosynthetic enzymes in the follow-up possibly reflect the effects of HF drugs.",

Shimizu Rinshoken, Tokyo, JAPAN Introduction: GalCer expression factor-1 (GEF-1) is a rat orthologue of the mouse Hgs which is vesicular transport related protein. We took notice of the function as a signal transfer molecule of GEF-1 and reported that GEF-1 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is a fundamental process in the early stages of embryo morphogenesis induced with signals, such as Wnt, and is also involved in cancer metastasis. In this study, we examined whether Hgs affects on metastasis of the B16 melanoma cells. Methods: B16 cells were transfected with an Hgs overexpression vector (B16/Hgs) or Hgs RNA interference vectors (B16/shRNA). The B16 mutant cells were selected and cloned. The migratory ability and metastasis ability of the B16 mutant cells were examined. Results: B16/Hgs cells expressed Hgs higher than the parental B16 cells, and B16/shRNA cells expressed Hgs lower. Difference of cell-proliferation ability was hardly observed between B16/Hgs cells and B16/ shRNA cells. In the migratory ability and metastasis ability in vitro and in the experimental metastasis examination in vivo, B16/Hgs cells showed higher activities than B16 cells and B16/shRNA cells showed lower activities. Conclusions: The metastasis ability of B16 cell was proportional to the amount of Hgs. Since change of the amount of Hgs expressed affected the metastasis ability of B16 cells, it was suggested that Hgs has the important role for a cancer cell metastasis process, and a possibility of becoming an important target molecule to cancer metastasis.",

Oleic acid (C18:1), a monounsaturated fatty acid, is known to have both pro-and anti-inflammatory effects in different cell types including macrophages and endothelial cells. Methods: To examine the effects of oleic acid on LPS-induced proinflammatory mediators, primary cultures of rat microglia and murine microglia cell line BV-2 were used. LPS-induced COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) production were analyzed by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA. MAPKs (ERK, p38, JNK), Akt, and NF-kappaB activation were analyzed by Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay. Results: Oleic acid (OA) inhibited LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expressions in a dose dependent manner. We found that OA inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6 kinase, whereas it had no effect on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38. Finally, we showed that OA inhibited phosphorylation of inhibitor kapaaB kinase (IKK) and activation of NF-kappaB in LPS-stimulated microglial cells. Conclusions: Our results show that OA inhibits COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in microglial cells by inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6 kinase and activation of NF-kappaB and suggest that it deserves further study on the therapeutic benefits for suppression of inflammatory-related neuronal injury in neurodegenerative disorders.",

The need for new adjuvant therapies has been implemented by the recent discovery of TRAIL, an anti-apoptotic member of the TNF family. TRAIL is destined to become an anti-tumoural agent due to its selectivity towards cancer cells. Towards this end, oncogenic mutations accumulating in a step wise manner during CRC carcinogenesis have been described to play a key role in inducing sensitivity to apoptosis. Methods: Cell lines and freshly isolated tumour cells at different stages of CRC were subjected to TRAIL treatment. Induced cell death was analyzed for markers of apoptosis. Observed apoptosis was correlated to genetic background and further investigated in transformed cells over-expressing either KRAS-G12V or BRAFV-600E.

After cell death induction, microarray analysis of the survived cardiomyocyte subpopulations will identify the responsible for the survival genes. An already constructed normalized plasmid library containing cDNAs synthesized from mRNAs of mouse adult and neonatal hearts, as well as of whole mouse embryo is converted to an adenoviral library following an in vitro recombination system. A goal of the present work is to achieve the optimal functional genomic system by constructing a library with more than 100 times higher transduction activity than the available ones. This will allow the identification of novel cardioprotective genes expressed at very low levels. Additionally, standardization of a suitable cell death induction methodology has established the conditions required for an approximate 80% cardiomyocyte death caused by different stimuli. Finally, a recombinant adenovirus carrying the Insulin-like growth factor 1 gene, known for its beneficial activity in the myocardium has been constructed and used as a positive control and also for further optimization of the cell death conditions.

The process of inflammation is mostly mediated by phagocytic cells like neutrophils, where the relevant intracellular pathways are critically regulated by kinases. A novel approach, screening of a kinase inhibitor library in primary human phagocytic cell-based assay systems, was used for the identification of molecules with anti-inflammatory properties. In the course of screening, we tested a part of molecular library of Vichem Ltd. on freshly prepared human neutrophil granulocytes using an optimized functional assay. In the primary biological assay, we applied the kinase inhibitors in 10 lM concentration for neutrophil experiments. Then, we investigated the pretreated cells in three different stimulation induced systems: (i) cytokine activation on integrinligand surface. Here, we activated neutrophils placed on the fibrinogen integrin-ligand surface by the inflammation cytokine TNF. This type of cell activation was similar to that which could be observed during inflammation. (ii) Cell activation via immune complexes: this was a model system of the inflammation process during autoantibodyinduced, immune complex-mediated diseases. (iii) Activation by phorbol-ester: This non-physiological activation was to exclude nonspecific effects, focusing on the previous two physiological activation types. Our experiments with the above system indicate that screening of a kinase inhibitor library on primary human phagocytic cells provides a number of potential lead molecules that inhibit inflammation-related but not nonspecific activation of neutrophils.

Gomes Departamento de Bioqu\u0131\u1e3fica, Instituto de Qu\u0131\u1e3fica, Universidade de Sa\u02dco Paulo, Sa\u02dco Paulo, BRAZIL Introduction: Blastocladiella emersonii is an aquatic fungus of the Chytridiomycete class, which is at the base of the fungal phylogenetic tree. During its developmental stages (germination and sporulation) the cell undergoes a large number of morphological changes, which require the synthesis of many new materials. The present work reports nitric oxide ( NO) production as well as its participation in cGMP signal transduction pathways during the sporulation phase of the fungus. Methods: The fungus was cultivated at 27\u00b0C in defined medium. In order to obtain confocal microscopy images, fungal cells were treated with 10 lM of DAF-DA, a nitric oxide marker, for 30 minutes at room temperature before induction of sporulation. Results: The sporulation phase was delayed by addition of L-NAME, suggesting NO production by an enzymatic mechanism from L-arginine. In adition, confocal microscopy experiments using 10 mM L-NAME and 10 mM L-arginine showed a remarkable decrease and increase in NO production, respectively. The intracellular concentrations of nitrite, nitrate and other nitric oxide-derived products were measured using a nitric oxide analyzer. The reagent 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, an inhibitor of nitric oxide sensitive-guanylyl cyclase, inhibited sporulation completely when added up to 90 minutes after starvation, suggesting that NO acts as a first messenger in cGMP production. In agreement with these results, microarray experiments showed an increase of guanylyl cyclase mRNA levels after the first hour of starvation. Conclusions: Our results show evidences for the existence of the NO-cGMP pathway during sporulation of the fungus B. emersonii. Cells slow down cell cycle progression in order to adapt to unfavorable stress conditions. Yeast respond to osmotic stress by triggering a G1 and G2 checkpoint delay that is dependent on the MAP kinase Hog1. The high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway is also activated by anticancer drug arsenite and the hog1 mutant is highly sensitive to arsenite, partly due to increased arsenite influx into hog1 cells. Yeast cell cycle regulation in response to arsenite and the role of Hog1 in this process have not yet been analyzed. We found that long-term exposure to arsenite led to transient G1 and G2 delays in wild-type cells whereas cells that lack the HOG1 gene or are defective in Hog1 kinase activity displayed persistent G1 cell cycle arrest. In contrast, hog1 cells exhibited wild-type G2 arrest during arsenite stress. These data demonstrate that arsenite sensitivity of hog1 is not only caused by enhanced accumulation of arsenite but also by inappropriate cell cycle arrest in G1.",

Together, our data point to an important role of Hog1 kinase in recovery from stress-induced G1 cell cycle arrest and provide evidence that it is possible to achieve permanent cell cycle arrest by combining drug action with manipulations of signaling pathways. The Wnts comprise a large class of secreted proteins that control essential developmental processes such as embryonic patterning, cell growth, migration, and differentiation. Wnt-5a is a representative ligand that activates b-catenin independent noncanonical pathway in Wnt signaling. Although abnormal activation of b-catenin-dependent pathway is often observed in human cancer, the relationship between b-cateninindependent pathway and tumorigenesis is not clear. In addition MMP-7 is involved in canonical Wnt pathway regulated by nuclear b-catenin. In this study, we investigated the expression of Wnt5a Introduction: Beta-arrestins (beta-Arrs) are known to be associated with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), P53/murine double minute (MDM2) and NF-kappaB tumor signaling pathways in cells.

Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) activity, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentration in plasma and small blood vessel formation in tumor tissues were measured. MMP9 inhibitors were also injected in the mice. And the human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were then applied as the cell model for further studying the mechanism. Results: The xenograft tumor initiated earlier and grew more rapidly in beta-Arr1 transgenic mice than in both the beta-Arr2 transgenic and wild-type mice after inoculating murine liver cancer Hepa1-6 cells or lymphoma EL4 cells. Moreover, plasma MMP9 activity, VEGF concentration and small blood vessel formation in tumor tissues were enhanced in beta-Arr1 transgenic mice compared with those in control mice. In addition, injection of MMP9 inhibitors in beta-Arr1 transgenic mice abrogated all these effects and suppressed rapid tumor progression. Similar results were observed in HMEC-1 cells. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors could suppress beta-Arr1-enhanced MMP9 activity and the C-terminal 181-418 amino acids of beta-Arr1 was largely responsible for this effect. Conclusions: Our data reveal a functional role for beta-arrestin1 in tumor progression in vivo, in which overexpression of beta-Arr1 promotes MMP9 activity and tumor angiogenesis by providing a suitable microenvironment for tumor progression.

We have confirmed that cytokeratin-1, but not vimentin, is present on the plasma membrane of neuroblastoma NMB7 cells as both a RACK1, Receptor for Activated C Kinase, and integrin a V b 3 -associated protein Methods: In our studies, cytokeratin-1 bound specifically to integrin a V b 3 in the presence of RACK1 and Taxol blocks cytokeratin-1 binding. Using a b-tubulin peptide specific for Taxol (PEP Taxol ) and RACK1 binding, we constructued an affinity column HiTrap-PEP Taxol . When HiTrap-PEP Taxol was loaded with warm 2% Triton X-100extracted membrane preparation of NMB7 cells, the cytokeratin-1, integrin a V b 3 and RACK1 were bound in the column and were eluted with 0.5 M NaCl. The identity of cytokeratin-1 was confirmed by mass specrophotometry. By using fluorescence microscopy, RACK1 was evidenced to support cytokeratin-1 binding to integrin? a V b 3 . Of interests, the cytokerain-1/ RACK1/integrin a V b 3 was found to be actively reactive with actin as well. Results: Cytokeratin-1 was isolated as a partner of RACK1 from the plasma membrane of neuroblastoma NMB7 cells. This molecular complex of cytokeratin-1/RACK1 was found as an associate with integrin a V b 3 and actins. We are interested to apply them to examine the interaction with organelles (Endoplasmic Reticulum, mitochondria, lysosome and Golgi apparatus) upon cytokine stimulation, especially during hypoxia. Introduction: Quercetin (QUE) is a natural flavonoid currently known for its antioxidant effects and its ability to attach itself to cellular membranes. Its reported effects suggest also interference in cellular signalling pathways, including effects on ionic channels (CFTR chloride channels, ryanodinic calcium receptors). It shows both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, in a concentration dependent manner. In our study, we researched the QUE interference on the nicotinic pathways, since no studies of its effects on nicotinic receptors have been reported so far. Materials and method: We performed whole-cell patch-clamp measurements on the TE 671 cell line (ECACC No. 89071904). We observed the effect of different concentrations of QUE (applied in the bath solution) on the peak current amplitude, the current decay phase and on recovery from desensitization as assessed by a sequential stimulation protocol with 10 lM ACh. Results: Quercetin decreases the peak current amplitude at 20 minutes of exposure, in a concentration dependent manner. The current decay phase of the whole-cell currents showed a bi-exponential kinetic, compared to the single-exponential channel closing kinetic in the control experiments. Recovery from desensitization was slower in the presence of QUE, with no differences observed for different exposure times. Conclusions: Our results suggest that QUE modulates the activity of the muscle-type nicotinic receptors by influencing both the activationinactivation kinetic of the nAChR and the nicotinic receptor desensitization. A possible mechanism suggested by our data might be the increasing, due to QUE, of the opening probability of a non-diligated state of the nicotinic receptor. One of the well-known protein modules regulating molecular interactions is pleckstrin homology (PH) domain whose best-characterized ligand is inositol phospholipid, and thus leading the recruitment their host proteins to the cellular membrane. Upon cellular stimulation, by sensing the changing of local concentration of the lipids or by intra-or intermolecular regulatory mechanism of accessibility to phospholipids, the modules then translocate to different subcellular compartment. We have investigated the subcellular localizations of the PH domains from PRIP (PLC-related, but catalytically inactive protein) with a domain organization similar to phospholipase C-d1 (PLC-d1). We previously showed that PRIP distributed throughout the cell cytoplasm but did not localized to any membranous structures, despite showing comparable binding affinity to PtdIns(4,5)P 2 with PLC-d1 whose PH domain is well known to localize to the plasma membrane by binding to PtdIns(4,5)P 2 . In the present study, we used recombinant PH domain from PRIP with or without the N-terminal extension comprising of about 100 amino acids present in PRIP but not in PLC-d1. The PH domain constructs showed different subcellular distribution when they were expressed as GFP-fused protein in MDCK cells. GFP-PRIP-PH localized to plasma membrane in resting cells similarly to GFP-PLC-d1PH while GFP-PRIP-PH with N-terminal extension did not show the plasma membrane localization. The results raised the possibility that the N-terminal extension preceding the PH domain of PRIP has inhibitory role in membrane [PI(4,5)P 2 ] binding of the PH domain.",

Anagnostopoulos and A. Siafaka-Kapadai Department of Chemistry, University of Athens, Athens, GREECE Introduction: The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) exerts its action through G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors and is inactivated through transport into cells followed by enzymatic degradation. In this study we investigated the enzymatic hydrolysis of 2-AG in rabbit platelets and characterized the responsible enzyme(s). Methods: Washed rabbit platelets were homogenated and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) activity was determined using [ 3 H]glycerol and the respective fatty acid in a time and protein concentration-dependent manner. In the presence of the specific FAAH inhibitors, though, hydrolysis was inhibited up to 60% in a concentration-dependent manner indicating the involvement of FAAH in 2-monoacylglycerol hydrolysis. MAGL was further characterized using [ 3 H]2-OG in the presence of URB 597 and it was found that its hydrolysis followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Subcellular fractionation of platelets homogenate showed that MAGL activity was present in both the cytosolic and membrane fractions. Finally, immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of both MAGL and FAAH. Conclusions: The endocannabinoid 2-AG is a substrate of both FAAH and MAGL; the latter was characterized for the first time in rabbit platelets. An apparent K m of 8.71 lM and V max of 0.76 nmol/ min*mg and an optimum pH 8 were determined. The molecular mass of MAGL and FAAH were found~47kD and~57kD respectively.

Cell chemotaxis in a gradient of external stimuli is important in many biological processes. Class I PI3Kinases have key roles in the mechanism by which chemoattractants stimulate cells to move and to become preferentially activated at the leading-edge. This results in the lipid product of Class I PI3Ks, the second messenger PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 , accumulating at the leading-edge where it signals by recruiting proteins containing PH domains to the plasma membrane. It is already clear that the dephosphorylation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is an important step in this cascade. However, in neutrophils there is debate about which of the enzymes potentially responsible, PTEN or SHIP I, is implicated and whether this step is dynamically regulated. We have attempted to address this problem by analyzing the distribution of PtdIns(3,4)P2, the characteristic product of SHIP but not PTEN activity. We used a retrovirus to introduce a PtdIns(3,4)P2 reporter (TAPP1 PH domain fused to cherry-FP) in stem cells isolated from transgenic mice expressing a reporter for both PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 (PKB PH domain fused to GFP). These cells were used to reconstitute in vivo neutrophils expressing both reporters allowing us to define by confocal microscopy the relative distribution of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 during chemotaxis. Our data show that, unlike PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(3,4)P2 does not localise at the leading edge of the cell. This study strongly suggests that in the context of chemotaxis both PTEN and SHIP I are active and furthermore are probably dynamically regulated to contribute to the patterning of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signals.",

            "text": "Oxidative slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibres express the ascorbic acid transporter SVCT2 during chick myogenesis M. Low, D. Sandoval, E. Aviles, F. Nualart and J. P. Henriquez Departamento de Biolog\u0131\u00e1 Celular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, CHILE Introduction: The reduced form of vitamin C (ascorbic acid, AA) functions as a potent antioxidant as well as in cell differentiation. AA is uptaken by mammalian cells through specific sodium/ascorbate cotransporters (SVCT1 and 2). Although skeletal muscle contains about 50% of the whole-body vitamin C, the expression of SVCTs has not been addressed in this tissue. In this work, we have studied the expression pattern and function of SVCT2 during embryonic myogenesis using the chick as model system. Methods: The expression of SVCT2 was followed by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry in embryonic (HH27-45) chick limb skeletal muscles. AA transport kinetic analyses were developed in cell cultures overexpressing chick SVCT2. Results: We have cloned the chick ortholog of SVCT2 sharing a 93% identity with the mouse transporter. Functional kinetic analyses in transfected cells in vitro corroborated its identity as SVCT2. Chick SVCT2 mRNA is expressed during chick embryonic muscle development. In addition, Western blots using a specific antibody against rat SVCT2 showed an immunoreactive band of 65kDa during chick myogenesis. Interestingly, immunohistochemical analyses in chick limb cryosections showed that SVCT2 expression is preferentially located to type I slow-twitch oxidative muscle fibres. Double immunostaining using specific antibodies against the chick slow muscle markers myosin (S58) and Ca-ATPase (SERCA2) displayed a high degree of co-localization with anti-SVCT2. Conclusions: SVCT2 is preferentially expressed by slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibres. We conclude that SVCT2-mediated uptake of AA is relevant to the oxidative nature of slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibres. Introduction: Ryanodine receptors (RyR), by amplifying neuronal calcium entry signals via calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), participate in some types of synaptic plasticity and spatial memory formation. We have shown previously that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) induce RyR-mediated CICR. Here we investigated if RyR contribute to the expression of proteins involved in synaptic plasticity and memory, such as brain-derived nerve factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB, PKM e, and the RyR isoforms RyR2 and RyR3. Methods: Expression of RNA and proteins was determined in primary cultures of hippocampal cells by RT PCR, Western blot assays and immunocytochemistry. RyR function was selectively inhibited by preincubating cells with 50 lM ryanodine for 60 minute. Results: Neurons incubated for 6-h with BDNF displayed increased expression of PKM e at the mRNA level, and of TrkB, RyR2 and RyR3 at the mRNA and protein level. RyR inhibition abolished these stimulatory effects, and in some cases decreased basal expression levels. Conclusions: We propose that RyR-mediated CICR generates calcium signals that stimulate the expression of genes underlying activitydependent morphological changes required for long-lasting synaptic plasticity, memory and learning. Among the 48 human ABC-transporters the multidrug-resistance (MDR) proteins (P-glycoprotein/MDR1, MRP1, and ABCG2) are peculiar in their unusually broad substrate recognition. They can transport a wide variety of structurally unrelated, mostly hydrophobic compounds. Since these nonpolar molecules are known to partition into the lipid bilayer and accumulate to high concentration in membranes, the 'classical pump' model for the transport mechanism of MDR proteins has been challenged. The proposed alternative models, i.e. the 'hydrophobic vacuum cleaner' and the 'floppase' models suggest substrate recognition within the lipid bilayer. Although this idea was supported by a number of drug-binding experiments, unambiguous evidence for the direct extrusion from the membrane has not provided as yet. In the present work, we employed the fully functional GFPtagged ABCG2 in confocal microscopy studies to determine the kinetics of drug distribution in the plasma membrane and other cellular compartments using the fluorescent anti-cancer agent, mitoxantrone. We generated kinetic models describing the transport processes for both the classical pump model and the alternative models, and compared them with our experimental observations. Our results clearly indicate that ABCG2 extrudes mitoxantrone directly from the plasma membrane. Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) is a G protein-coupled receptor, which is involved in the regulation of central energy homeostasis. MC4R displays a constitutive activity, increasing basal cAMP production in the absence of ligand. Among the clinically reported mutants of MC4R, we investigated the functional characteristics of mutants where the mutations in the third intracellular (i3) loop of MC4R have been reported, such as A219V, I226T, P230L, G231S, G238D, N240S, and A244E. Using a CRE (cAMP responsive element)-mediated luciferase reporter gene assay, we observed that mutant A219V showed significantly decreased basal activity, whereas mutant P230L displayed significantly increased basal activity. When the dominant negative Gs mutant was co-expressed, the majority of the mutants showed reduced basal activity. These results suggest that the i3 loop of MC4R is essential not only for the functional activity but also for the regulation and maintenance of an optimal constitutive activity of MC4R in association with G protein coupling. Identification and characterization of proteins involved in interaction with the i3 loop of MC4R is currently undertaking to understand the molecular environment of MC4R signaling in control of energy homeostasis. Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), nonintegrin collagen receptor, is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) with a unique extracellular domain homologous to discoidin 1 of Dictyostelium discoideum. DDR1 is known to play a role in cell attachment, migration, survival, and proliferation. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of DDR1. A recent paper has reported that p53 induction and activation of DDR1 kinase counteract p53-mediated apoptosis and influence p53 regulation through a positive feedback loop. This study was designed to determine the role of DDR1 in nitric oxide (NO)-induced apoptosis. NO plays important roles in physiologic processes including nerve system and inflammation. NO generation initiates apoptotic cell death in different experimental system. In our study, the administration of S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL -penicillamine (SNAP), a NO donor, decreased the cell viability and induced apoptotic cell death in J774A.1 macrophages. Interestingly, the expression of DDR1 was decreased by treatment of SNAP. On the contrary, the inhibition of expression of DDR1 by siRNA and blocking peptide increased cell viability and reduced NO-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that DDR1 has pro-apoptotic effect against NOinduced apoptotic cell death in macrophages by regulating the signaling molecules. We suggest that modulation of DDR1 signaling in macrophages may be useful in controlling apoptosis signal transduction.",

Dove School of Biosciences, The University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK Introduction: Phosphatidylinositol (3,5) bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P 2 ) is the most recently identified member of the class of signaling lipids known as the phosphoinositides (PPln). PPln are regulatory lipids that orchestrate a wide variety of cellular events. PPln are made by PPln kinases and degraded by lipid phosphatases. PPln control cellular events via binding to and activating effector proteins. PI(3,5)P 2 is implicated in the regulation of endosome-lysosome trafficking, vacuolar pH control, and stress responses. In S cerevisiae, the synthesis of PI(3,5)P 2 is carried out by the Fab1p lipid kinase, and also requires two accessory proteins, Vac7p and Vac14p. Degradation of this signal is mediated by the Fig4p lipid phosphatase, but this process also requires Vac14p. Atg18p/Svp1p is an effector for PI(3,5)P 2 and binds this lipid with high affinity. Atg18p/Svp1p is required for PI(3,5)P 2 mediated vacuole size control and correct membrane trafficking and also seems to feedback inhibit synthesis of this lipid as atg18D cells display elevated levels of PI(3,5)P 2. This complex set of inter-relationships is known as the Fab1p pathway but the nature of the protein-protein interactions among the various players in this signaling cascade remains undefined. Results and conclusions: In this study, we investigate inter-protein interactions in the Fab1p pathway by co-immunoprecipitation and demonstrate a core complex centered around the PI(3,5)P 2 effector Atg18p/Svp1p. We found that Atg18p/Svp1p bind to Vac14p and Fig4p in vivo and we are currently investigating interactions of this complex with Fab1p.",

Gilmanov M.A. Aitkhozhin's Institute of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Almaty, KAZAKHSTAN Investigation of signal transduction is a one of the hot point of modern biology. One of the important phytohormone is cytokinine. In cytokinine signal transduction one of the main questions is existence of cytokinine secondary hormone. In this reason the main task of our investigation is the isolation, purification and investigation of cytokinine secondary hormone (CSH). At first time the CSH was purified by chromatography column with the new nanostructured carbon-mineral sorbents. Purified CSH shows it's physiological and biochemical effects at concentrations 100 times less than cytokinin. It was shown that CSH is very close by its properties to fusicoccine. Also, in recent decades it was established that 14-3-3 proteins are a one of the important component of the signal transduction systems. Namely 14-3-3 proteins are molecular targets for hormonal and other signals. One of the interesting effects of CSH is its ability with 14-3-3 proteins to activate Ca 2+ -dependent ATP-ase of plasmatic membranes from aleurone layer of wheat seeds. The activation of this enzyme let to increasing the level of the cytosolic Ca 2+ ions. It's well known that cytosolic Ca 2+ is very important intracellular signal for activation of protein kinases and many biochemical and physiological functions. Thus we have discovered the new fusicoccine like phytohormone cytokinine secondary hormone which activates the Ca dependent ATP-ase from plasmatic membrane of aleuron layer of wheat seeds. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) after host infection stay latent and during the acute infection undergo reactivation. It can lead to the modification of cell redox systems activation mechanisms. The aim of present study was to evaluate the changes of cell redox state during HSV-1 infection. C6 glioma cells, an astroglial cells, where HSV-1 is known to replicate, were used. Redox state of the cells was investigated using menadione-induced lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL), and for registration of NO production we applied Griess assay. Before we have shown that the addition of menadione to monolayers of C6 glioma cells leads to the ROS generation. It was revealed that menadione-induced ROS generation in astroglial cells during HSV-1 infection is changed depending the time of HSV-1 inoculation. Integral intensity of CL was higher than in control sample in the period of 100-270 minutes after HSV-1 inoculation, whereas maximal value of this parameter was observed through 180 minute. It was established that at this period of time NO production was increased. The received data permit to conclude that HSV-1 inoculation to C6 glioma cells leads to modification of cell redox state and increased superoxide anions and NO production.

The C2 domain, composed of about 130 amino acids, has been found in many signal proteins involving in membrane trafficking, generation of lipid-second messengers, activation of GTPase, or control phosphorylation or other signaling processes. Most C2 domains specifically interaction with particular lipid molecules in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner, and some C2 domains play a crucial role in cellular processes via a direct interaction with a specific protein. In human, total 175 C2 domains have been identified in 225 different proteins. We have cloned about 150 human C2 domains using the Gateway cloning system. For in vitro lipid binding analysis, we converted all C2 domain genes to the bacterial GST-fusion expression vector. All C2 domains were successfully expressed in DH5 a E. coli cells and purified to near homogeneity using Glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. All purified C2 domains were subjected to lipid binding assay using strips spotted with a variety of lipid species (PIP-Strips\u00e4). Many proteins specifically bind to particular lipid species such as phosphoinosites (PI3-P, PI4-P, PI5-P) in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner. From these analyses, we defined C2 domains into several groups and their functional relation among C2 domains. These studies might provide information about how each domain is responsible for protein function and the functional significance of C2 domain in many different cellular processes.",

Activation of cPLA 2 has been correlated with the direct phosphorylation of the enzyme by members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. In this study we investigated the effect of two specific MEK inhibitors on the stretch-induced cPLA 2 phosphorylation in AEC II.

Detection of cPLA 2 , phospho-cPLA 2 (activated form of cPLA 2 ), ERK 1/2 and phospho-ERK 1/2 was performed in cell extracts by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. Results: Mechanical stretch induced (within 15 minute) an increase in cPLA 2 phosphorylation in AEC II. PD98059 and U0126 inhibited the activation of the ERK MAP kinases in AEC II.

Cys 7 mg/kg body weight (daily, for 1-week, during the 9th-week). Whole rat brain parameters were measured spectrophotometrically. Results: Diabetic rats exhibited a significant reduction in brain TAS ()28%, D1 vs. C1; )30%, D2 vs. C2) that was reversed after 1-week-Cys-administration into basal levels. Diabetes caused a significant increase in AChE activity (+27%, D1 vs. C1; +15%, D2 vs. C2), that was further enhanced by Cys-administration (+57%, D+Cys vs. C2). The C+Cys group exhibited no significant difference compared to the C2 group in TAS (+2%), but showed a significantly increased AChE activity (+66%, C+Cys vs. C2). Conclusions: The present data revealed a protective role for Cys towards the oxidative effect of diabetes on the adult rat brain. Moreover, an increase in whole brain AChE activity due to diabetes was recorded (not repeatedly established in the literature, since contradictory findings exist), that was further increased by Cys. The latter could be helpful in coping with the diabetes-induced brain dysfunction and is useful in identifying the mechanism(s) involved.",

            "text": "Electrophysiological characterization of sensory neurons from double transgenic mice with type I diabetes compared to normal mice Results: There are significant differences between the electrophysiological parameters of sensory neurons from dTg mice compared to Balb/ c mice. In our study we have recorded, the intensity and amplitude of the action potential, the intensity and amplitude of the posthyperpolarisation, and the effect of ATP, protons and capsaicin. Conclusions: The algesic profile of peripheral sensory neurons from dTg mice is very different from that of the Balb/c mice. Introduction: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes the differentiation switch between epithelial cells and motile mesenchymal cells, and facilitates cell movements and generation of new tissue types during carcinogenesis and fibrosis. Many secreted polypeptides are implicated in the EMT process and their corresponding intracellular transduction pathways form highly interconnected networks. Transforming growth factor (TGFb1) has a major role in inducing EMT in pulmonary fibrosis and EBV lytic phase activation, which proteins have been found in lung tissue of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Here we present a gene expression array-based method to investigate altered signalling networks in pulmonary epithelial cells. Methods: Extracted RNA from primary human small airway epithelial cells (SAECs), alveolar epithelial cells type II (A549) and EBV infected A549 (VAAK) were utilized to investigate altered gene expression in response to TGFb1 10 ng/ml for 4h by Affymetrix Human Genome U133A microarrays. Resulted data from multicompare analysis were clustered and processed by Genomatix BiblioSphere Pathway (genomatix.de) and David 2.1 Functional Annotation clustering (david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov). Results: Multicompare analysis produces a list of 50 altered transcripts in SAECs, A549 and VAAK. 18 transcripts were associated with signal transduction (p = 1.30E-03) and related to transcription factor activity further, presenting binding sites for c-Jun, FOXA2 CEPD and SOX4. A significant correlation between reduced expression of tumor suppressor gene, FOXA2, and increased expression of c-Jun has been reported by functional annotation clustering and BiblioSphere Pathway. Conclusions: By using a web-based computational biology method, we propose reduced FOXA2 as a novel mediator of TGFb1-induced EMT in pulmonary fibrosis. Methods: We tested in vitro on Jurkat T lymphoblasts the new nucleoside analogs by investigating cellular viability in association with membrane integrity (LDH release), apoptosis (membrane asymmetry disorder), thymidine and uridine metabolism (the radioactive method), and drug uptake (using tritium-labeled variants). Results: We showed that the uracil-34 compound (U-34) was cytotoxic for Jurkat cells above 10 lM and this deleterious action started early with membrane integrity disturbance. The remaining cells presented a moderately elevated population of apoptotic cells. U-34 exerted an early, persistent and dose-dependent inhibitory effect on uridine uptake by tumor cells. The action of U-34 on thymidine uptake was initially stimulatory, but turned into a late inhibition. U-34 inhibited uridine and thymidine uptake by tumor cells even at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Jurkat cells incorporated only small amounts of tritium-labeled U-34. Early uptake was mediated by hENT receptors sensitive to small concentrations of dipyridamole, but other receptors seemed to be involved in later phases. Addition of non-cytotoxic amounts of non-labeled U-34 particularly inhibited the uptake of the radioactive variant. Conclusion: Our in vitro results pointed out that U-34 may exert in vitro anti-tumor activity on Jurkat lymphoblasts by inducing cytotoxicity and disturbance of uridine metabolism. Drug uptake is mediated by particular nucleoside receptors and is sensitive to non-cytotoxic concentrations of U-34. ",

The exact mechanism(s) that CPPs use for cell entry and transduction of cargo molecules, however, has remained elusive and controversial so far. The cellular translocation of CPPs and their payloads has been described by fluorescenceand activity-based methods mostly, leaving the more detailed characterisation on the ultrastructural level almost out of attention. We tagged S4 13 PV and its analogues with 1.4 nM Nanogold particles by forming a covalent bond between the peptide and label. We mapped the interaction mode of labelled peptides with the plasma membrane, uptake by HeLa and CHO cells and intracellular targeting by using transmission electron microscopy. S4 13 PV peptide and its analogue with reversed NLS sequence, which are known to be taken up very efficiently, interact with cell surface in cooperative manner by assembling into spherical structures on/in the plasma membrane. The formed structures contain several peptide molecules on the electron-dense background and accumulation of these in the plasma membrane induces the uptake into cells by vesicular mechanism mostly. In vesicles the spherical structures are not dissociated but retain their organisation and remain associated with the membrane of vesicles. High concentrations of peptide impair the integrity of the vesicle's membrane and induce escape into cytosol. Our study demonstrates that CPPs interact with the plasma membrane at specific regions and by forming regular structures introduce disturbances in the plasma inducing vesicular uptake by cells.",

Recognition of PIP 3 by the PH domain of Akt and phosphorylation in its activation loop by upstream kinases is the key for its activation. We have reconstituted this signalling pathway by heterologous expression in the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have found that yeast cell growth was inhibited by Akt activated in vivo by co-expressed nontoxic wild type p110. Akt toxicity requires its kinase activity and induces the formation of plasma membrane and cell wall invaginations supported by actin polarization. We have screened a collection of 4thinsp;787 haploid S. cerevisiae single gene deletion mutants to identify non-essential genes associated with Akt toxicity on S. cerevisiae. This led to the identification of yeast genes that either counterbalanced growth inhibition induced by Akt on yeast or displayed enhanced sensitivity to in vivo activation of Akt. Most of these genes have human homologues, so by extrapolating our results to mammalian cells, this study can contribute to our knowledge about the role of Akt in cancer and other pathologies. In summary, we show here that the yeast model is a useful tool for the functional analysis of Akt. Infection by influenza virus causes the cascade of biochemical processes, which lead to immunity suppression and in particular to the decrease of neutrophils phagocytosis. The role of oxygen-dependent redox systems of neutrophils in influenza virus inoculation is not known. Mechanisms of ROS generation during the initial stage of the interaction of influenza virus A (FPV H7N1) with neutrophils of human blood were studied in present work. ROS generation and MPO activity of neutrophils were investigated by luminol dependent chemiluminescence (Lum-ChL). Cells were activated by adhesion to glass. To determine the influence of virus of different ROS types generation in neutrophils specific scavengers of ROS were used. Secretory degranulation was studied by lysozyme release into extracellular space by spectrophotometry. It was established that virus significantly reduced ROS production. It decreased the yield of hydrogen peroxide, superoxide and NO in cells and did not influence the quantity of hydroxyl radicals. Virus diminished lysozyme and thereby MPO secretion by neutrophils from cells. In model system MPO/H 2 O 2 /luminol virus inhibited MPO activity by 90% that was mainly associated by OClscavenging. Data supposed that virus revealed immunodepressed effect on neutrophils possibly by modification of cells redox system.",

            "text": "Helicobacter pylori infection down regulate Signaling pathways that depend on TP53 or NFjB transcription factors are essential components of cellular responses to stress. TP53 activated primarily upon genotoxic stress is involved in regulation of either cell cycle or apoptosis. NFjB activated by many different factors, including cytokines like TNFa, frequently exert anti-apoptotic functions. Both regulatory pathways apparently interfere each other, yet molecular details of such interactions remains to be elucidated. Here we have analyzed effects of activation of NFjB on apoptosis, either TP53-dependent or TP53-independent, induced by UV radiation in human colon carcinoma cell lines HCT116 and RKO. TP53 was inactivated in such cells by either biallelic knock-out or expression of inhibitory viral EPV E6 protein, respectively. Cells were treated with TNFa to activate NFjB pathway and irradiated with UVC to induce apoptosis (at several time combinations), and then number of apoptotic cells was assessed by flow cytometry at different time points. We have observed that treatment with TNFa resulted in 2-4-fold reduction in number of apoptotic cells in TP53-proficient lines. Interestingly, an inhibitory effect was highest when cells were treated with TNFa after UV irradiation. In marked contrast, treatment with TNFa after UV irradiation resulted in significantly increased number of apoptotic cells in TP53-deficient lines. We concluded that TNFa-dependent activation of NFjB signaling differentially affects TP53-dependent and TP53independent apoptotic pathways. Methods: In vivo labeling of protein phosphorylation events during signal transduction indicated the rapid phosphorylation of several proteins. Substantial differences and de novo LPS-induced phosphorylation were also observed with two-dimensional analysis. Qualitative and quantitative changes in the phosphoproteins of Nicotiana tabacum suspension cells during elicitation by LPS were analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis in combination with a phosphoprotein-specific gel stain. Trypsin digested phosphoproteins were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS and nano-ESI-LC/MS/MS. Results: The identified phosphoproteins indicate that LPS-induced signal perception/transduction involves G-protein coupled receptor signaling, Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent signaling pathways, H + -ATPase regulation of intracellular pH, thioredoxin-mediated signaling and phosphorylation of 14-3-3 regulatory proteins. Other targets of LPS-responsive phosphorylation included NTP pool maintenance, heat shock proteins, protein biosynthesis and chaperones as well as cytoskeletal tubulin. Conclusion: The results provide a broad picture of the mechanisms of LPS perception and signal transduction. Many of the identified LPSresponsive phosphoproteins are known to be interconnected at many levels through a complex web of activation/deactivation, complex formation, protein-protein interactions, and chaperoning reactions. This study thus provides novel insights for the biochemical action mechanism of LPS as a resistance elicitor, a PAMP and triggering agent of defense responses associated with innate immunity. Introduction: Some labdane-type diterpenes show significant antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. The resin found in the glands of Cistus creticus ssp. creticus, a plant native to Crete, contains high concentrations of several labdane-type diterpenes. The metabolic pathway leading to the biosynthesis of this class of labdane-type diterpenes remains unclear. Here we report the cDNA isolation, heterologous expression in E. coli and functional characterization of a diterpene synthase from C. creticus trichomes involved in labdane biosynthesis. Methods: The full length cDNA of a putative diterpene synthase was isolated from a C. creticus trichome cDNA library and the coding region was spliced into an E. coli expression vector. Crude protein extracts from bacterial cultures expressing the gene were used in enzymatic assays with GGDP as substrate. The compounds produced, with or without hydrolysis, were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: The deduced amino-acid sequence of this protein is highly similar (59-70%) to type B diterpene synthases that catalyze a protonationinitiated cyclization in other angiosperm species. Nevertheless, motifs related to ionization-initiated cyclizations, similar to those performed by type A diterpene synthases, were identified in the protein primary structure. The E. coli-produced enzyme catalyzed the formation of the tricyclic labdane-type diterpenes manoyl-oxide and epi-manoyl oxide as well as another unidentified compound in two sequential cyclization steps, with diphosphate labda-13-en-8a, 15-diol as a stable bicyclic intermediate. Therefore the encoded protein can be named manoyl-oxide synthase (MAOS). Conclusions: MAOS is the first bifunctional type A/B diterpene synthase identified among the angiosperms and its activity sheds new light on labdane-type diterpene biosynthesis. This knowledge is critical for biotechnological applications in the production of these pharmacologically active compounds.",

Yip School of Biological Sciences, University of Hong Kong, HK SAR Introduction: Plant hormone ethylene regulates many aspects of plant growth and development. The regulatory enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis, ACC synthase (ACS), is encoded by a multi-gene family whose members are differentially regulated by different developmental, hormonal and environmental conditions. Nine ACS isogenes has been reported in tomato and based on the transcript expression profiles of these genes, four ACS isogenes (LE-ACS1A, LE-ACS2, LE-ACS4, LE-ACS6) are found to be involved mainly in flower and fruit development. Methods: To elucidate the roles of these genes in reproductive growth, gene specific ACS silenced lines were first generated by employing antisense RNA and/or RNAi method. Double and triple ACS genes silencing lines could then be generated by cross breeding afterwards. Results: Suppression of LE-ACS1A, LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS4 in transgenic tomato lines showed different degree of morphological and anatomical change in flower and fruit: increase in petal number and locule number, abnormality in the placenta formation, increase in fruit size and weight etc. as compared with the wild type UC82B. When applied ACC to these transgenic lines during very early stage of flower development (1 mm), the locule number of fruits could partially restore to normal. In contrast, LE-ACS6 suppressed lines did not show phenotypic changes during reproductive growth, but showed a larger leaf area compared to wild type plants.",

            "text": "Introduction: Pistacia lentiscus Var. Chia plants growing on the island of Chios are present in different morphological varieties, which exhibit moderate differences in respect to the their products's quality. An attempt was made, to investigate whether the morphological differences correspond to taxonomic ones. Methods: Samples were collected from five individuals of each of the following local varieties Vottomos, Marouliotis, Mauroschinos, Stenofyllos and Fardyphyllos growing on the island. They were initially examined by RAPD using decameric primers. To verify RAPD results, individuals from each of the above varieties were further examined by cloning and sequencing of their Intergenic Regions (IR) located between 18S and 26S rDNA genes. Sequences were aligned and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Results: RAPD results indicated that all varieties differ among themselves based on RAPD pattern generated with a specific primer. Within each variety, Vottomos, Stenofyllos and Fardyphyllos do not comprise of homogeneous populations, as further substantiated by IR results. To the contrary, varieties Marouliotis and Mavroschinos appeared to consist of a homogeneous population according to RAPD results, a fact not supported by the IR sequencing data. Some of the above varieties proved to be 100% identical to Pistacia saportae and all of them 98-99% identical with Pistacia lentiscus. Intoduction: Perennial plant species, including peach trees have to withstand adverse environmental conditions. Thus, at the end of each growing season they move into dormancy producing floral and vegetative buds to protect their meristems from freezing. Trees accumulate chilling hours to count the duration of winter preventing growth under non-favorable conditions. With respect to their Chilling Requirements (CRs) peach varieties are either suitable for warm regions (Low-CRs) or for cold regions (High-CRs). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that modulate CRs could determine the prerequisites for tree species adaptation in a changing climate. Therefore farmers could choose to cultivate productive and profitable elite cultivars. The identification of genes involved in flowering time could serve as a platform for conventional plant biotechnological sorting of peach varieties. Methods: We have collected vegetative and floral buds of the 'Evert' variety from two locations in Greece with different bud break periods. Samples were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results: Comparison of vegetative and floral bud proteomes revealed high degree of colinearity between the two bud types. Furthermore, the protein profile of each bud-type from both geographical regions showed high degree of colinearity. Protein spots representing either differential or co-expression among the two bud-types and/or locations were selected for sequence determination by MALDI-TOF Mass-Spectrometry. Conclusions: Proteins showing differential expression between each bud-type could indicate developmental specificity, while geographical differential expression may discriminate the advancement to bud breakage. Consequently, proteomics allows the identification of genes involved in bud development that may serve as biomarkers for conventional biotechnological breeding of tree species. Intoduction: Measurements of atmospheric CO 2 show a gradual rise enhancing the greenhouse effect that results in global warming. Mankind has to cope with the consequences of climate change and identify environmental benign ways to meet the expanding energy demands while decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Through a variety of 'renewable' sources available, the form of solar energy that can contribute substantially to fuel needs at competitive level to fossil fuel is the one captured by photosynthesis. Thus, understanding plant cell wall synthesis (biomass) is of crucial importance, as it is the greatest carbon sink in the biosphere. Methods: Performing a genetic screen of an EMS mutagenized Arabidopsis, we isolated thanatos (than), a semidominant-negative mutation with impaired cellular architecture. Intriguingly, than homozygous seedlings are embryo lethal while growth of heterozygous plants is dramatically decreased. FTIR-Microspectroscopy and cell-wall component analysis revealed reduction of cellulose content of than plants compared to wild type. Results: Positional cloning revealed a single-nucleotide transition causing the amino acid substitution of Proline 578 to Serine of Arabidopsis Cellulose synthaseA3 (AtCesA3) gene. AtCesA3 (P578S) mutant gene when introduced into wild-type plants resulted in acquisition of than semidominant-negative mutant phenotype. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that Proline 578 is conserved among plant and non-plant CesA genes being part of the catalytic UDP-glucose substrate-binding domain. Conclusions: These data suggest that the incorporation of a than defective CesA3 subunit into the rosette complex most likely prevents the production of b-(1,4)-glucose chain, which could in a way stall cellulose microfibril synthesis. Aurones, the 6-glucosides of aureusidin, are plant flavonoids that provide the bright yellow colour of some important ornamental flowers. Despite the potential significance of aureusidin biosynthesis in biotechnology, the enzymatic details of its synthesis have not been analysed. A new enzyme, aureusidin synthase was proposed to play a key role in aureusidin biosynthesis. This enzyme was identified as a chalcone-specific homolog of polyphenol oxidase (PPO). In this study, we analyze the enzymatic formation of aureusidin by PPO, an enzyme which catalyses two different reactions involving oxygen: the o-hydroxylation of monophenols to o-diphenols (monophenolase activity) and the subsequent oxidation of o-diphenols to o-quinones (diphenolase activity). 2',4',6',4-Tetrahydroxychalcone (THC), a suggested precursor for aurone aglycons, has been used as substate of PPO. Enzymatic oxidation of THC was followed by recording spectral changes with time. Maximal spectral changes were observed at 415 nm. The oxidation rate which varied with pH was highest at pH 4.5.Time-course of THC oxidation by PPO showed a lag period, characteristic of monophenolase activity. The length of the lag phase increased with THC concentration but decreased with enzyme concentration. The lag was shortened by the addition of increasing amounts of o-diphenol or hydrogen peroxide. The following kinetic parameters were determined: V m = 13 lM/min, K m = 0.12 mM, V m /K m = 0.1/min. THC oxidation was efficiently inhibited (K I = 1.8 lM) by tropolone, a specific PPO inhibitor. The results obtained confirmed that PPO is capable of oxidizing directly THC, the precursor of aurone biosynthesis. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the anti-coagulant and anti-diabetic activities associated with Leonotis leonurus extracts and marrubiin, a compound isolated from this plant. Methods: Aqueous and organic (acetone) extracts were prepared from Leonotis leonurus. Human platelets were incubated with different concentrations of the aqueous and organic extracts (0.5-2 mg/ml) and commercial marrubiin (0.01-0.1 lg/ml). For the platelet studies; the platelets were activated with thrombin and adhesion to coated plates was evaluated with light microscopy and a phosphatase assay. Expression of GIIb/IIIa in platelets was used to evaluate platelet aggregation with flow cytometry. For the diabetic studies; rat islets were exposed to the extracts for 48 hours to determine the effect of the extracts to insulin release under hyper and normal glucose levels.",

In this study, the GST activity for the conjugation of xenobiotic substance (CDNB) was isolated from needles of Pinus brutia, Ten. trees from a nursery in Yal\u0131ncak area/METU (Ankara-Turkey). Trees that exhibited healthy appereance were selected from the same altitude profile. GSTs activities in the cytosolic fractions prepared from Pinus brutia needles were determined spectrophotometrically by using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), 2,3-dichloro-4-(2-methylene butyryl)-phenoxy acetic acid (Ethacrynic acid; EA), 1,2-Dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB), 1,2-Epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy) propane (EPNP), and p-Nitrobenzyl chloride (p-NBC) as substrates at 25\u00b0C. There was at about 68% decrease in the GST activities after 25\u00b0C. Only CDNB (160 \u00b1 10 nmoles/min/mg) and DCNB (2.30 \u00b1 0.38 nmoles/min/mg) activities were detected and the rest were found as negligible. Therefore, CDNB was used as the substrate during purification of GSTs from needles of P.brutia. The sequential application of cytosol to gel filtration column chromatography on Sephadex G-25, anion exchange DEAE cellulose column chromatography, and S-hexylglutathione agarose affinity chromatography were performed for purification of GSTs. After the final step of purification procedure, CDNB conjugating activity of P.brutia cytosolic GSTs was purified about 15.45 fold with 1.95% yield. SDS-PAGE results showed that distinctly purified GST isozyme had an Mr of 24 kDa. In this study, we report for the first time the GST isozymes in a gymnosperm, P. brutia. Ubiquitously distributed multifunctional superfamily of Glutathione Stransferases (GST, EC.2.5.1.18) generally constitute a dimeric enzymes and catalyze the conjugation of the thiol group of the glutathione (GSH) to diverse electrophilic centres on lipophilic molecules with the formation of rather less active end products. Plant GSTs had an attention because of their roles in herbicide detoxification. Therefore, GSTs have been identified and characterized with a differential and overlapping substrate specifities mainly from the agricultural crop species. However, there is almost no information about molecular characterization of this superfamily in gymnosperms, except for a very recent study from Pinus tabulaeformis and our previous studies by using Pinus brutia, which is the climax vegetation of the Mediterranean Region in Turkey. As conifers have wide distributions and have to cope with several environmental stresses, the definitions of detoxification enzymes like GSTs in conifers is very important for their adaptations. Due to this purpose, it was decided to examine the molecular cloning and expression of GST-Tau isoenzymes in E. coli. In this study, the total RNA was isolated from Pinus brutia needles and subsequently cDNA was prepared with RT-PCR strategy. PbGST- Introduction: Olive mill wastewater (OMW), a byproduct of olive oil extraction, constitutes a significant agroindustrial waste and an important environmental pollutant due to its high organic load, low pH and presence of biotoxic substances (polyphenols) that are difficult to degrade. A specific group of the OMW phenolic profile called secoiridoids includes oleuropein, tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, which have antimicrobial activity and act as antioxidants, thus having a healthbeneficial role. Methods: A group of bacterial strains that grew with ease on untreated OMW were isolated based on their ability to bioremediate and decrease total organic carbon (Folin-Ciocalteau method) and phenolic concentration (e.g. vanillic, p-coumaric feroulic and syringic acids; GC spectrophotometer) in diluted OMW. Furthermore, they were found to produce significant amounts of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol (Reverse-phase HPLC). The selected strains were characterised based on their 16S rRNA gene sequence and the microbial flora of OMW was investigated by means of 16s rDNA array probing. Results: OMW is a substrate for a number of bacterial phyla, with emphasis to Cyanobacteria and c-Proteobacteria -mostly Enterobacteria. The microbial load varies depending on OMW treatment/geographical area. An uncultured isolate of Enterobacteria and a Gram+ species were able to decrease the total organic load, in some cases as much as 69% in 24 hours and significantly decreased phenolic concentration. In addition, a 7 hour incubation in diluted OMW yielded an almost 100% increase in its tyrosol/hydroxytyrosol content. Based on remediation treatments and the phylogenetic status of these bacteria we provide alternative tools for OMW management. ",

We used different types of chromatography for purification of b-amylase. The treatment by triton X-100 liberates b-amylase from membrane bound state. The treatment by papaine changes the electrophoretic spectra of b-amylase by causing appearance of catodic isoenzymes and dissapereance of anodic isoenzymes. This phenomenon can be explained by splitting of charged peptides from molecules of b-amylase. Our data are confirmed by treatment of b-amylase by endoproteinases which was isolated by affinity chromatography on hemoglobin-sepharose. The treatment by endoproteinases causes the same effect as papaine treatment. In this case there is appearance of catodic isoenzymes and dissapereance of anodic isoenzymese. In contrast of treatment by papaine, endoproteinases treatment causes also the essential increasing of bamylase activity. The treatment of wheat grain by protease inhibitors of cystein proteinases: leupeptine and antipaine prevents the changes of electrophoretic spectra of b-amylase. Our results speak about very important role of endoproteinases in regulation of activity and electrophoretic spectra of b-amylase in wheat seeds during early stages of germination. The regulation of b-amylase is very important for biotechnological control of preharvest germination of wheat seeds in the ears which causes damage to quality of seeds.",

In spite of the high level of purification techniques and detailed analysis of different components of zootoxins, the mechanism of the interaction between venom and intact tissues in the living organism is still not clear. A fact that has received some attention is the difference between the toxic activity of purified venom components and that of the same components in the whole venom. BLMs and GUVs represent an adequate model of the lipid moiety of biomembranes, which makes it possible to reconstruct the changes of some features characteristic of natural bilayer membranes under snake venom influation. Model membranes (BLM) were formed from the total lipid fraction from bovine brain on a teflon aperture by the method of Muller. The electrical parameters of the BLMs were determined on an electrometric devise equipped with a Keithley 301 differential feedback amplifier (USA) in a voltage-fixation mode. The electroformation method, developed by Angelova and Dimitrov (Dimitrov and Angelova, 1987) was used to prepare the vesicles. Venom was added to the sample chamber before the vesicles were formed and we investigated the electrical parameters of BLMs after their merging with venom modified GUVs. The presence of viper venom in BLMs media has not shown a noticable differences of plastic properties compare the control, while the merging of BLMs with GUVs modified by venom lead to appearance of channel activity. It was recognized early that the vipers venom components preferred an organized lipid substrate near the lipid's phase transition and were particularly active against micellar lipids. Introduction: A primary intent in drug targeting and pharmacological studies is the understanding of driving forces involved in the transport and/or distribution of drugs within cells. At the same time, transport studies require quantitative elaborations and vitality assessment. Synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence microscopy (lSR-XRF) allows the simultaneous determination of different chemical elements with nanometric resolved localization (1), while phase contrast microscopy probes cell morphology.

Nano-biotechnology is an extremely powerful emerging technology, which is expected to have a substantial impact on nanotechnology now and in the future. Although, in this area many applications are still in their infancy, it seems that nanoparticles would have a great role in future prescription. Albeit, nanoparticles have been known for decades, most of their properties and characteristics especially encounter with biological systems are still unknown. In this study, Gold Nanoparticles (GNp) which have exciting properties were adapted to biological system. For fabricating bio-nano gold particles the reducing agents such as NaBH4 and citrates were replaced with UV irradiation and stabilizing agent such as Triton X-100 and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) and other surfactants which are not adjust to biological system were omitted. At least GNP in small size and in biological PH with non intrusive agents has been made in photochemical synthesis way. The color of GNP solution and their absorption in UV spectrometry studies and TEM images showed the producing small GNP. Following to understand the interaction of GNP to protein, microtubule protein (MTP), extracted from sheep brain, has been chosen. Microtubules are cytoskeletal proteins that, among other functions are essential for, cell transport and cell division and are present in all eukaryotes. They are highly dynamic polymers and consist of tubulin dimers. Interaction of gold nanoparticles with microtubial protein was characterized by using UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and fluorescent spectroscopy. UV spectrometry has shown decreasing in microtubule polymerization and protein activity. It seems that they can interact with microtubule protein and inhibit their activity. Fluorescence spectrometry showed a significant changes in tubulin structure. According to these results we suggest that GNP interaction with microtobule protein result to dimer conformational changes of protein, therefore, decreasing polymerization. We use statistical mechanics and a grand canonical ensemble to study the conformational properties of a long DNA chain capable to bear the formation of a certain amount of loops. We use a microscopic model where the DNA chain is described by a continuous line. The probability of formation of a loop, after the contact of two sites away along the chain, is based on Gaussian statistics which have been extensively used in the past. Beyond its persistence length it includes also a small length parameter which can describe the local structure of the DNA chain like its helical behavior. Based on this probability an optimum size of the loop is determined in accordance with previous more sophisticated theories and the results of enumerations of ring closures on a DNA chain. The average number of loops which goes as the probability of contact of two sites as well as the average size of the DNA chain are analytically described in terms of the size of the chain the chemical potential of formation of a loop and the largest possible number of loops. Cases with a small number of loops like in DNA various processes where a few sites are brought in close proximity and interact can properly be described. Cases with a larger number of loops leading to an overall expansion or condensation of the chain after the addition of condensing agents, can also be properly described. A comparison with existing experimental data based on single chain observations is included.",

The aim of our study was to investigate whether the entrapment into negatively charged pH-sensitive liposomes of some compounds such as lactoferrin (Lf), a glycoprotein from bovine milk or of chemotherapeutic drugs, dacarbazine and cisplatin, could improve their antitumoral activities. The experiments were performed in vitro using human melanoma cell line SK-mel 28. MTS proliferation assay revealed that free Lf as well as the synthetic compounds significantly reduced the number of living cells. The IC 50 evaluated after 24 hour of treatment was 350 lg/ml for Lf, 2000 lg/ml for dacarbazine and 400 lg/ml for cisplatin. The effect on cell viability was associated with morphological changes visualized by optical microscopy. FACS analysis of cells treated with the antitumoral compounds revealed a decreased in the percentage of cells in S-phase of cell cycle. Lf or anticancer drugs entrapment into liposomes resulted in two to three fold better efficiency in inhibiting cell growth and affecting cell morphology as compared to free agent treatment. These results demonstrate that liposomes containing antitumoral agents could represent a base for a new strategy in cancer prevention and/or treatment.

Redox potential and drug metabolism measurements were carried out using electrochemical techniques of cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Results: Here we report the first direct electrochemical characterisation of hFMO3 using both non-oriented entrapped protein on glassy carbon electrode (GC) and covalently linked protein on gold electrode. The enzyme was initially immobilised on GC electrode using a cationic surfactant and cyclic voltammetry carried out under anaerobic conditions. The voltammograms showed a single redox couple with a midpoint potential of -0.42 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The peak current was linear with scan rates up to 150 mV, indicating that the protein was adsorbed on the electrode surface. Cyclic voltammetry was also carried out with enzyme immobilised on gold electrode after functionalisation with sulfhydryl-reactive cross-linkers showing similar measured redox potential.

Gilardi Department of Human and Animal Biology, University of Turin, Turin, ITALY Introduction: Mammalian cytochrome P450s are the key enzymes involved in Phase I metabolism of clinically relevant drugs and contribute to the metabolism of a huge number of xenobiotics. Cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4) is the major cytochrome P450 in human liver responsible for more than 60% of drug turn over. Whenever two drugs are administered together, the possibility of drug interactions exists if both drugs are metabolised by the same P450 enzyme. It is therefore very important to use in vitro screening methods to evaluate potential drug-drug interactions. Here we report the first such electrochemical interaction measurement for CYP3A4. Methods: Redox potential, drug metabolism and IC50 measurements were carried out using electrochemical techniques of cyclic voltammetry (under anaerobic conditions) and chronoamperometry. Results: The recombinant CYP3A4 was immobilised on glassy carbon electrode (GC) using a polyelectrolyte polymer (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and cyclic voltammetry carried out under anaerobic conditions. The voltammograms showed a single redox couple with a midpoint potential of -0.097 V (vs. NHE). The peak current was linear with scan rates up to 150 mV/s -1 , indicating that the protein was adsorbed on the electrode surface. Chronoamperometric experiments were then carried out in the presence of erythromycin as a substrate. Three different known inhibitors of CYP3A4 namely ketocanozole, cimetidine and diclofenac were then tested and their respective IC50s measured. The latter data are in good agreement with microsomal data. Conclusion: The findings constitute the first step towards the creation of an in vitro electrochemical platform for drug-drug interaction measurements. Introduction: Molecular biomimetics approaches have been used to select short peptides that can bind to inorganic target material specifically and with high affinity. These material-specific peptides, called GEPIs, can be utilized as molecular linkers for biological and material applications. Biomolecules can be linked with any material via peptidebiomolecule constructs in which peptide is the inorganic-specific moiety and the protein is the biofunctional member. Methods: pETBlue-2 expression system was chosen for the construct formation. The construct contains QBP-1 which was generated and fused to the N terminal of the functional proteins, alkaline phosphatase (AP) and GFPuv. Tuner (DE3) placI cells were used for the expression of tagged proteins, and expressed proteins were purified using silica columns. For comparison, 6xHis tag was fused to N-terminal of functional proteins and expressed proteins were purified using Ni-NTA column chromatography. Results: The vector constructs were successfully formed for each functional protein and transformed into Tuner DE3 pLacI host strains for the expression of the proteins. The expressed tagged proteins were passed through silica column to show the applicability of the QBP1 as tag peptide and the results were compared to that of the same functional proteins having 6xHis as tag peptide at their N terminals. Conclusion: Our designed vector systems make available the use of QBP-1 as the tag peptide for the isolation of any desired protein through silica columns. We here show one of the possible applications of GEPI peptides in the medical and nanobiotechnological applications, which is here an alternative tagging system for the purification purposes.",

Selected peptides can be further engineered, modified through genetic engineering methods and synthesized to utilize as molecular tools with controlled functionalities. Peptides selected by the display libraries are generally short ones, between 7-14 amino acids. To increase binding affinity, tandem repeats of the sequence can be generated by genetic engineering. Repeated structures of short peptides may show a better affinity and provide a controlled assembly process. The increased surface recognition sites could result in an enhancement in binding strength and/or specificity of the peptide (Sarikaya et al., Nat. Mater. 2003; 2: 577-585). Methods: In this study, three tandem repeats of both quartz-binding peptide (QBP1-PPPWLPYMPPWS) and gold-binding peptide (GBP1-MHGKTQATSGTIQS) was used to develop the bi-functional construct. Two peptide sequences were linked by a flexible linker, composed of 10 amino acids (GGGGSGGGGT). For the expression of the peptide, an E. coli-based expression system TAGZyme pQE-2 is used. Results: The vector was constructed and the bi-functional peptide was expressed in LB medium. Expressed proteins were purified by using Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography. Both functionalities of the peptide are conserved after linking two well-characterized peptides. Conclusions: The genetically engineered in vivo construct is expected to be a versatile molecular tool for bionanotechnology applications. Bifunctional peptide can be used to immobilize gold nanoparticles on silica for sensing applications. Introduction: Controlled drug release from the biodegradable matrix provides planned delivery of the cytotoxic substances to the specific places in the organism. To ensure the correct delivery, the biodegradable matrix should possess certain unique properties, such as high mechanical strength, elasticity, biocompatibility and low immunogenicity. Spidroins I and II (SPI, SPII)-two components of the spider dragline silk -are of the specific interest because they obtain all the listed properties. We studied the nanostructure of the fibers and films obtained from the recombinant analogs of SPI and SPII. Methods: We expressed both proteins in P.pastoris and purified them to 95% purity using FPLC. The concentrated protein solution was rapidly dehydrated to produce 'as spun' fiber that was subsequently manually stretched. The films with the various pore sizes were produced using shift, casting and electrospinning. Morphology of fibers and films was observed using electron and atomic force microscopy. Results: We observed that both proteins spontaneously form nanofibrils in solution. TEM and negative contrasting revealed that the single nanofibril exhibits the amyloid-like helical structure. The electrospun nanofibrils possess a somewhat similar morphology. Stretching of the 'as spun' fiber leads to the rebuilding of its sponge-like matrix and to the appearance of microfibrils. The mechanical properties of the stretched fibers depend on the properties of the microfibrils, comprising the fiber. Conclusions: The obtained results dissect the relationship between the structure and mechanical properties of artificial fibers and films that could be further used as matrixes for controlled drug release or stem cells cultivation. Introduction: Our research focuses on the in vitro antimicrobial activity evaluation of some new original compounds, 2-phenylthiomethylbenzoic acid amides. Methods: The aforementioned amides were obtained in four stages: the 2-phenylthiomethyl-benzoic R1-substituted acids synthesis, their acid chlorides, synthesis of the N-(2-diethylaminoethyl)-anilines, and finally the new amidic compounds. The qualitative screening of the susceptibility spectra of various microbial strains to these compounds was performed by three adaptated diffusion methods: paper filter disk impregnation with tested substances solutions, the disposal of tested solutions in agar wells and the spotting of tested solutions on solid medium seeded with microbial inoculums. The in vitro antimicrobial testing was performed by binary microdilution method, in 96 multi-well plates, in order to establish the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), against Gram-positive: Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, Bacillus (B.) subtilis, Gram-negative: Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa, Escherichia (E.) coli, Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae), as well as Candida (C.) albicans and Aspergillus (A.) niger, using both reference and clinical, multidrug resistant strains. Results: New original amides were synthesized, their physico-chemical properties, structures and purity were determined by means of elemental analysis, TLC methods, IR, 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR spectra. The compounds were microbiologically investigated against reference strains, Gram-negative and positive clinical strains, also fungus. All the compounds showed valuable antimicrobiolal effects. Conclusion: The new amides of 2-phenylthiomethyl-benzoic R1-substituted acids were tested for their in vitro antimicrobial activity proving to be active against the reference strains and also against Gram-negative clinical strains; all of them exhibit antifungal activity.",

Additionally we quantified the differential expression of 9 KLKs using ELISA. Results: KLK6 was expressed significantly higher in the cancer samples (P = 0.001). Tumors of advanced TNM and Duke's stage showed high KLK10 expression (P = 0.028, P = 0.08 respectively). Nearly all KLKs highly effectively separated cancer from normal tissue (P < 0.001).

Among them, the usage of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is one of the promising methods. However, it poses difficult to raise aimed mAbs with high affinity and specificity. To address this problem, we developed a new technology to selectively generate specific mAbs with high affinity based on antigenbased B-cell targeting. Methods: Based on B-cell targeting, mAbs were generated against a di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) that is suspected to be one of the endocrine disruptors. Firstly, the sensitized B lymphocytes were selected by DEHP-streptavidin conjugates, and combined with biotinylated myeloma cells by strong and specific interaction of streptavidin to the tethered biotin. The B lymphocyte and myeloma cell complexes were then selectively fused by electrical pulses. Results: The hybridoma cell (2F4) producing high-affinity mAb against DEHP was successfully obtained as evidenced by Kd values between 10 -9 M and 10 -11 M. It is first shown that the anti-DEHP mAb was directly fixed on a 96-well assay plate for quantitative analysis of DEHP. Interestingly, the fixation of the anti-DEHP mAb to magnetic beads markedly enhanced its sensitivity by 10-100 times, realizing the detection of DEHP at 0.01-0.001 mg/L. Although 2F4 showed relatively wide cross-reactivities with other phthalate esters, we have lately succeeded in generating highly specific mAb against DEHP. Conclusions: We could succeed in selective production of novel mAbs against lower antigenic compound by B-cell targeting. This new technology may be applicable for highly sensitive measurement of biomarkers such as cancer and other diseases. Recent advance in biotechnology enables us to find the peptides with affinity for nonbiological materials and with function of mineralizing inorganic materials. The use of the functional peptides is attracting a growing interest for bottom-up fabrication approaches of nanoscale devise. Zinc oxide (ZnO), a semiconductor with a wide direct band gap, possess unique optical, acoustic, and electronic properties, so that it is one of most widely studied metal oxides for solar cells, ultra violet nanolaser, blue light-emitting diode and so on. This wide variety of applications requires various fabrications of morphologically and functionally distinct ZnO nanostructures. Here, the peptides which are selected from the phage-displayed peptide library with a 12-mer on the surface, can bind the ZnO particle but not other metal oxides particle, and further, the ZnO-binding peptides play an important role on the crystal growth of ZnO in its synthesis. We describe the biomimetic ZnO synthesis using the artificial peptide with affinity for ZnO.",

The benefit of such materials is that they could be designed with biocompatible surface stabilizers for new biomedical applications (retinal detachment therapy, cell separation methods and radioactive therapies). In this study, cell viability/citotoxicity was determined by the interaction between primary osteoblast cell line and bioceramics. Methods: MTT test was used to assess cell viability of the osteoblasts. Cells were incubated with D15S bioceramic at 1% concentration for 2, 4, 12 and 24 hours. The viability cell number is directly proportional to the production of formazan. Results: There is a general tendency of depletion in osteoblast number which is quite normal after 2 hours of exposure to bioceramic. This effect might be due to cells adaptation following interaction with nanostructure. After 12 and 24 hours of interaction between osteoblasts and bioceramic, we detected an increase in cell growth relating to control. The cell viability of the osteoblasts in contact with biocera-mic support presented in time a linear increase trend between 2 hours (56.14%) and 24 hours (126.32%) comparing to control. Conclusions: According to our results, cells' incubation in the presence of iron oxide coated with dextrin can modify parameters of cell growing (augmentation or depletion of viability relating to control), exposure period (2, 4, 12 and 24 hours) representing an significant factor in osteoblasts' growing. Hydroxyapatite (HA) can be found in different sizes and shapes in mammalian hard tissues as the main component. In the formation and growth of hydroxyapatite crystals, huge number of proteins play important roles. Phage or bacterial display technology is a practical approach for screening a large number of random peptide for any inorganic surface. Peptides that can bind inorganic substances specifically and with high affinity have been identified and characterized previously by our group, through the usage of this technology [1] . Among them, hydroxyapatite-binding heptapeptides that offer a route for controlling biomineral formation was used in this study [2] . Fluorescent proteins which were recently developed for different spectral properties and enhanced brightness provide advantage to label non-living and living subjects. One strong and one weak-HA binding peptide which have seven amino acids Cys-Cys constrained sequence, HABP1 and HABP2 respectively, and also linear (without Cys-Cys) form of HABP1 were fused with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFPuv) which works as a fluorescent prob. These bifunctional proteins have been expressed in E. coli and the binding affinities of the purified proteins on HA powder were compered by fluorescence microscopy. It was observed that HABP1-GFPuv fusion protein has a much higher affinity to HA powder comparing with HABP2 and the linear constructs. Our bifunctional constructs present fluorescent sensory systems for real time monitoring of controlled in vivo and in vitro biomineralization which may be utilized for hard tissue engineering studies. Introduction: Bacillus subtilis forms the source of most of the enzymes that are of industrial importance. Amylase has an important place among these enzymes. There have been a lot of studies related to the isolation and characterisation of Bacillus amylase. Amylases are enzymes which hdrolyse starch molecules to give diverse products including dextrins and progressively smaller polymers composed of glucose units. These enzymes have a great significance with extensive biotechnological applications in bread and baking, food, textile, and paper industries. Material and Method: The thermotolerant bacterium was isolated from the \u00c7 ermik hot spring (Southeastern Turkey) and identified as Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis was produced in various media, in which the growth of bacteria and the amylase activity was the best was determined. a-Amylase activity was determined according to Bernfeld method. SDS-PAGE (Polyacryilamide gel electrophoresis) of these samples was carried out. Optimum temperature and pH were determined. The effects of glucose, EDTA, Ca 2+ and some heavy metals (Hg, Mn, Cu, Zn) on a-amylase activity were investigated. Results: It was found that the best growth and the best activity occurred in starch added LB (Luria Broth) medium. The optimum temperature was determined to be as 65\u02daC, and the optimum pH as 7.0 for the enzyme. It was seen that Ca 2+ increased the enzyme activity, and increasing glucose and EDTA concentrations caused enzyme inhibition. Discussion: The results we have obtained so far from our study are compatible with the findings of other researchers.",

Aged garlic extract has antioxidant properties and prevents the formation of AGEs in vitro. This study investigated the effects of dietary intervention with aged garlic extract on glycaemia and oxidative stress in 48 diabetics. Methods: Blood was collected from patients on recruitment, after 1 month and then monthly following an intake of 1000 mg of aged garlic extract daily over 3 months. Samples were analysed for glucose and glycated haemoglobin using automated analyses. Low molecular weight AGEs were measured by a fluorimetric method. Malondialdehyde concentrations were determined using an accepted colorimetric method. Results: Intervention with aged garlic extract did not effect blood glucose or glycated haemoglobin concentrations. However, aged garlic intake did reduce levels of serum AGEs although this was not significant over the 3 month period. There was a significant reduction of serum malondialdehyde after only 1 month of therapy. Conclusion: Serum malondialdehyde, an indicator of oxidative stress, was reduced following intake of aged garlic extract, in Saudi Arabian type 2 diabetic patients. Further investigations are needed to assess the reliability of these data. Introduction: Natural compounds, usually occurring food and, especially, in food supplements, may act as modulators of the expression of key protein in drug transport and metabolization may be used in a controlled fashion in order to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce adverse effects of medicines. Two potential areas of application were investigated: the influence on long term medication (addressing diabetes, inflammatory or cardiovascular diseases) and on intensive (aggressive) medication (as in the cases of anticancer or antimicrobial therapies). Methods: In vivo and in vitro models were used to investigate both changes in levels of expression of hepatic metabolization enzymes, as well as effects on drugs metabolization and drug toxicity. Farmacokinetic effects were estimated using LC-MS, for 5 -fluorouracil, indometacin and glibenclamide. Results: Controlled administration of plant poly-phenol complexes was demonstrated to modify the level of expression and activity of members of the cytochrome family. Relevant changes in drug toxicity and pharmacokinetics were found in the case of 5 FU, and changes were also associated with changes in the expression of liver metabolizing enzymes.",

Introduction: The aim of this study was to characterize the regulation of cytosolic alanine aminotransferase (cALT) expression in liver of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) under conditions associated with enhanced gluconeogenesis. Methods: RT and RACE PCR assays allowed us to isolate a novel ALT isozyme (cALT2) generated from alternative splicing of cALT gene in S. aurata. Cytosolic localization of cALT2 was confirmed in HEK293 cells transfected with constructs expressing cALT2 as a C-terminal fusion with the enhanced green fluorescent protein. To address the molecular functions of cALT1 and cALT2 in liver of S. aurata, we examined tissue distribution, expression of piscine cALT isozymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and regulation of hepatic cALT1 and cALT2 expression in various metabolic conditions. Results: Expression of S. aurata cALT isozymes in yeast indicate that cALT2 is more efficient in catalysing the conversion of L-alanine and 2-oxoglutarate to pyruvate and L-glutamate than cALT1. In S. aurata, starvation increased cALT2 expression and decreased cALT1 mRNA levels in liver. Opposite effects were found in regularly-fed fish at postprandial time 4-8 hours, and after 6 hours of treatment with glucose or insulin. Conclusions: We conclude that cALT2 expression is associated with increased gluconeogenesis in liver, while cALT1 is predominant during postprandial utilization of dietary nutrients. Since increased ALT activity is associated with insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes, further research should focus on the usefulness of hepatic cALT2 expression as a marker in the prognosis of diabetes. Introduction: Conjugated Linoleic Acid consists of a group of isomers of linoleic acid. The biological effects are associated with anti carcinogenesis, diabetes and obesity. However, the most studied aspects regrd the alterations in lipid metabolism. Changes in lipid metabolism are closely related with associated protein gene expression modification, which is in many cases, mediated by mechanisms dependent on the activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs). PPARa is highly expressed in the skeletal muscle and plays an important role in the regulation of fatty acid uptake, activation, mitochondrial transport and b-oxidation. Our purpose was to verify the relationship between CLA supplementation and gene expression of some important proteins related to lipid metabolism in the muscle and the possible role of PPARa Introduction: Olive leaves are well known for their effect on metabolism in particular as a traditional anti-diabetic herbal drug. Until now these properties are only attributed to oleuropein that is the major component of olive leaves. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of the olive leaves extract (OLE), olive polyphenolic fraction (PF) and oleuropein (OL) on free radical metabolism and insulin secretion in insulinoma cell line. Methods: Cell viability was investigated withMTT colorimetric assay after a short time (45 minute) H 2 O 2 (0-0.15 mM) exposure. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured using DCF-DA that is converted to the fluorescent dichlorofluorescein. Insulin release was evaluated with ELISA. Results: After 0.035 mM H 2 O 2 exposure, cell viability was measured as LD 50 50.8 \u00b1 9.6% of control cells. H 2 O 2 injury in INS-1E cells was accompanied by increase of intracellular ROS production (308.1 \u00b1 56.7% of control). All tested samples showed a significant decrease in ROS value with a maximum effect at the highest concentration used, 226.1 \u00b1 24.1, 233.0 \u00b1 14.5, 238.9 \u00b1 16.7% of control for OL, OLE and PF, respectively. The H 2 O 2 -stress led to decrease in insulin release by 44.1 \u00b1 6.1% of control cells. Incubation with OL and PF resulted in the stimulation of insulin release by 92.6 \u00b1 1.0%, 228.9 \u00b1 30.0% of control cells respectively. However OLE has no effect on insulin secretion. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that olive extracts can protect the function of insulinoma cells against H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative damage.",

Rocafull and J. del Castillo Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas, Artos de Pipe, VENEZUELA Background: Defensins are small cysteine-rich cationic proteins with antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral propierties. They are produced by different cells incluiding enterocytes. Breast milk contains catalytic antibodies (abzymes) with proteolytic activity. It has been demonstrated that such abzymes may regulate signal transduction in enterocytes by cleaving and activating the protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2). However, the physiological rol of these proteolytic abzymes have been not determined. In this work we investigated if the abzymes secreted in breast milk may induce the intestinal expresio\u00b4n of beta defensin-2 (BD2) through PAR-2 activation. Methods: Cultures of human intestinal epithelial cell line HT-29 were treated with LPS (1 lg/ml), trypsin (10 nM), and F(ab)2-fragments (5 lg/ml) obtained from proteolytic sIgA alone or mixed with the protease inhibitor PMSF (1 lg/ml), additionally the catalytic F(ab)2-fragments were assayed on HT-29 cells preincubated with B. pertussis toxin. As negative control, the cells were incubated with F(ab)2-fragments (5 lg/ml) obtained from non-proteolytic seric IgG. The treatments were performed by 24, 48 and 72 hours. BD2 secreted in supernatans was evaluated by ELISA. The mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR. Four independient experiments were performed. Results: We found a significant F(ab)2-sIgA effect on the expression of BD2 (P < 0.05), B. Pertussis toxins and PMSF having an inhibitory effect compared to F(ab)2-IgG and media alone. LPS and trypsin increased the BD2, as had been reported. Conclusions: F(ab)2-fragments from sIgA seem to modulate the expression of BD2 in intestinal epithelial cells.

It is a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic protein synthesis and exerts cytotoxic effects in a time and concentration depending manner on some types of monolayer kidney cells. We investigated oxidative status parameters, p53 and caspase 3 expression in the Hek293 cell line after DON mediated induction of oxidative stress. Methods: Biochemical parameters were assessed after 6, 12 and 24 hours of cell treatment with 2.5 lM DON. The superoxide ion, GSH, lipid peroxidation level and superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase specific activities were assayed. The p53 and caspase 3 protein expressions were evaluated by immunohistochemical methods. Results: The variation of the biochemical parameters and gene expression modulation after 6, 12 and 24 hour highlighted: i) the correlation of the profile of superoxide ion with the SOD activity, ii) the lipid peroxidation pattern identical with that of GPX activity, iii) slow initial decrease of GSH and later increase with 36%, and iv) the abolishment of p53 and caspase 3 expression starting with 6 hours of intoxication. Betacyanins are red-violet plant pigments widely used as food colorants under the E-162 code. They are highly soluble in water and non toxic even at high concentrations, being used for coloring meat products, ice cream, jam and fruit conserves. Furthermore interest in these natural pigments has grown since their radical scavenging capacity was characterized. In the present work, the transformation of the structural unit of betacyanins, betanidin, by tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is studied, as well as other parameters affecting the pigment stability. The enzymatic reaction was characterized and followed by HPLC and spectrophotometry. Betalains were obtained from natural sources and purified by anionic exchange chromatography. Pigments were identified by HPLC with PDA and ESI-MS detection. Tyrosinase showed activity against betanidin, and yielded an unique product identified as a stable quinone, revealing a K m = 0.66 mM. pH dependence on betanidin degradation presented a first-order degradation kinetics, and the corresponding degradation constants, k d , were calculated. Stability was enhanced in the pH range 3.0-6.0, observing a quick color loss at higher values. The presence of oxidizing agents and high ionic strength negatively affected the stability of betanidin solutions. Ascorbic acid preserves the pigment integrity in natural sources. Since color plays a key role in consumer acceptance of food it is necessary to understand the physical parameters and biochemical steps involved in pigments stability. Betanidin degradation kinetics demonstrated that pH values over 6.0 and high ionic strength reduce the pigment stability, and tyrosinase plays a major role in the metabolism of betacyanins.",

Studies have revealed that the consumption of olive oil could be beneficial for human health. Aim of this study is the elucidation of the inflammatory processes induced by IL-1b on HMCs and the modulation of its actions by OPL. Methods: An established HMC line was used. The cells were incubated with IL-1b (1-5 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of OPL (0.002-0.2 microg/ml) and a) the levels of PAF, IL-6, MCP-1 b) the activity of PAF's biosynthetic enzymes and c) the levels of cytoplasmic GSH were measured. Results: IL-1b induces a transient decrease of GSH and elevation of intracellular PAF levels within 1 hour, while IL-6 and MCP-1 secretion was observed at longer incubation time points. The activation of PAF biosynthetic enzymes precedes the increase of PAF levels. Pre-incubation of HMC with OPL resulted in inhibition of IL-1b-induced PAF increase while co-incubation of IL-1b with OPL slightly attenuate the activation of PAF synthesis. Co-incubation of OPL with IL-1b resulted in the enhancement of IL-6 secretion while pre-incubation of the cells with OPL resulted in the partial inhibition of IL-6 secretion and does not affect MCP-1 secretion. Conclusions: Intracellular PAF, IL-6 and MCP-1 mediate IL-1b actions on HMC. OPL could modulate IL-1b actions on HMC and may confer protection to renal inflammation.",

As fats and fatty acids were known as growth factors of Lactobacillus bacteria, it is necessary to confirm whether fat should be removed before microbiological assay in foods containing high levels of fat. We compared folate contents in 19 foods containing various amounts of fat (0-33% by weight) before and after removing fat. Fat was removed by adding hexane to the weighed food samples, mixing well, centrifuging, decanting off hexane/fat supernatant, and drying in oven to evaporate hexane. Trienzyme (a-amylase, protease, folate conjugase) was treated to food samples for folate extraction before and after removing fat, and folate content was measured by microbiological assay using L. casei. Folate contents in 6 food samples containing less than 10% fat were not much different before and after removing fat. The decrease rates ranged from 0% to 4.4%. But folate contents in 13 food samples containing more than 10% fat such as fried chicken, French fries, and pork (belly) decreased from 8.1 to 31.0% after removing fat from the food samples. The decrease rates of folate content after removing fat were significantly correlated with the percentages of fat in foods.

Ushio 2 1 Chuo University, Tokyo, JAPAN, 2 Niihama National College of Technology, Niihama, JAPAN Stable and high stereo-selective lipase and esterase have attracted much attention from viewpoints of industrial usage. In the course of our studies searching for efficient inducers for lipase, among various additives, we have found that fatty alcohols act as the most effective super-inducers for induction of lipase production by several Pseudomonas-like bacteria. The addition of fatty alcohols brought about more than several hundred-fold enhancement of the lipase activity compared to the case with no additive. This means several dozen-fold enhancement of lipase activity compared with olive oil grown case. Gram per litter lipase production has been capable. We also found that when several Pseudomonas-like bacteria were grown on fatty alcohols, not only lipases but a large amount of an extracellular 15 kD protein (P15) was strongly induced. This induction of P15 seems to be simultaneous with that of lipases. P15 is a n-alkane emulsifying protein, activator-protein of n-alkane oxidation and utilization system. Productions of those two proteins are possibly under the same regulation system. Under oxygenlimited condition, an extracellular 17 kD protein was induced instead of P15. Expressed lipases, deduced from the cloned nucleotide sequences, have high homology among Pseudomonas-like lipases including lactonizing lipase. Lactones can be synthesized from the corresponding omega-hydroxy fatty acids, an inducer of cutinase in a fungal system, and above strains possess lactone-specific esterase. Although omega-hydroxy palmitic acid did not induce lipases from these bacteria, these lipases induced by fatty alcohols seem to be directed to cutine degradations.

These cross beta-structures are recognized by receptor of AGE (RAGE) on the surface of some cells, such as microglial cells and induce inflammation. In an attempt to find a natural pharmaceutical, which might inhibit glycation of proteins alpha helix to beta-sheet transition, a water-soluble fraction was obtained from Melissa officinalis which has shown to have clinical benefit. We incubated Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) with glucose in the presence and absence of Melissa officinalis extract and the effects of this fraction on the formation of advanced glycation end-products and structure of protein were studied.

Introduction: Alcohol abuse is a main cause of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Therefore, some health care food may be use as therapeutic (or preventive) reagents for alcoholic liver disease. The hard clam (Corbicular fluminea) was thought have hepatoprotective effect for several years ago in Taiwan, but its function has not validate yet. The intragastric ethanol infusion Tsukamoto-French rat model has proved that alcohol induced progressive alcoholic liver injury including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis and liver fibrosis and cirrhosis that can be used for the study of alcoholic liver disease. We will investigate how the extracts of clam to improve hepatic damage in alcoholic liver disease by Tsukamoto-French rat model. Methods: The clam extracts were derived from solution of heating hard clam. By using Tsukamoto-French rat model, first fed ethanol (8 g/kg/day) to rat for 12 weeks, then fed extracts of clam (2 ml/day) for 2 weeks. Pathological diagnosis of liver and hematology teat was investigated by sacrificed rat. Results: In histochemical analysis, the extracts of clam could improve the level of pathology in alcoholic liver. Furthermore, the hematologic data showed that the extracts of clam could recover the white blood cells on alcohol-induced liver injury in rat.",

GSPE had an antihyperglycemic effect in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [1] and after 15 hours of treatment with GSPE, there was no resistance to the stimulation of glucose uptake in adipocytes in culture by an acute dose of insulin [2] . Now, we analyze the GSPE effects on an insulinresistant profile induced by a cafeteria diet. Methods: We fed female Wistar rats with a cafeteria diet during 13 weeks.

Safarpour University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IRAN Ascorbic acid (AA) is present in high concentration in nervous system and is believed to act as a neuromodulator and inhibits nitric oxide synthase which is important for pain induction in neuropathic pain models. This study investigates the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) pathway in the analgesic effect of ascorbic acid in CCI model of neuropathic rats. Neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction injury of sciatic nerve. Paw withdrawal thresholds were assessed by radiant heat, Randall Selitto test and Von Frey filaments. To investigate the analgesic effect of ascorbic acid, 2 weeks after CCI ascorbate (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg) or saline was injected intraperituneally. Behavioral tests were done 15 and 30 minute after injection. In attempt to provide evidence concerning the involvement of glutaminergic-NO pathway in antinociceptive effect of ascorbic acid, on the second week after CCI, 30 minute after injection of saline or AA, animals received intraperituneally injection of glutamate (10 3 nmol), L-arginine (500 mg/kg) and L-NAME (20 mg/kg). Animals were tested 20 minute after injection. The results indicate that acute injection of 5 and 10 mg/kg but not 1 mg/kg of ascorbic acid increase mechanical and thermal threshold in the second week after CCI which confirm the dose dependent antinociceptive effect of AA that seems to be medicated through its interaction with glutaminergic-NO pathway.",

However, little is known about the effects of CR on a tissue in which the mitochondria have no ATP-producing purpose but show a high degree of uncoupling, namely brown adipose tissue (BAT). Our objective was to determine which effects long-term CR has on the decline in BAT mitochondrial function in old rats.

BAT composition, mitochondrial protein and mtDNA, COX activity, mitochondrial oxygen consumption and UCP1 content were analysed. CR induced resistance to lose total and mitochondrial protein, COX activity, and uncoupling capacity with advancing age. In summary, our study demonstrates that BAT thermogenic machinery is preserved by CR in old male rats.",

Introduction: In contrast to aqueous enzymology, biotransformations in water-organic solvent mixtures offer unique industrially attractive advantages. The removal of enzymes from their natural environs results in reduced reaction rates and low stabilities. The aim of our work was to modify the primary amino groups of a-chymotrypsin with different organic acid anhydrides (acetic, propionic, succinic, citraconic and phthalic) possessing different chemical structure to enhance the conformational stability of the enzyme and to compare the stabilities of the acylated enzyme forms. Methods: For the measurement of a-chymotrypsin activity, N-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester was used and the decrease in absorbance at 237 nm was followed. Near-UV CD measurements were performed with the enzyme samples previously incubated for 30 minute. The band intensities were expressed as mean residue ellipticity [Q] MR . Results: Acylation of a-chymotrypsin with different anhydrides increased its stablity in aqueous organic solvents. In 60% ethanol, acetonitrile and 1,4-dioxane the modified enzyme forms preserved about 50% of their activities during a 2 hours incubation while the controll enzyme was inactivated within 20 minute. The modification of a-chymotrypsin by phthalic anhydride was accompanied by an enormous activation. The acylated enzyme forms did not show significant structural changes with the exception of phthalic anhydride modified one. The improvement of stabilities might be related to side chain reorientations of aromatics upon modifications especially caused by phthalic anhydride.",

Analysis of the impact of heavy metals, especially Cd and Pb individually and in combination in the form of inorganic salts corresponding to daily intake in experimental diets on oxidative stress in experimental animals was studied. Metallothioneins (MT) are considered to be important in homeostatic control and their role is examined in connection with oxidative stress. Relationship between the level of hepatic MT and the exposure of the rat to heavy metals has been shown. Quantity of the rat MT was performed by differential pulse polarography. Determination of the specific activity of oxidative stress enzymes was performed in heparinized plasma. Peroxidase, superoxiddismutase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase and catalase were selected for our studies. In the case of glutathionreductase, the increase of enzymatic activity is considerable after intraperitoneal application of cadmium solution in comparison with cadmium application in diet or tap water. The influence of the genetic background of the animals has been studied on the transgenic recombinant strains of rat. Peaches contain phenolic compounds that have potent antioxidantactivity, free-radical scavenging abilities, and protective cardiovascular effects and so they have been linked with the health-promoting properties of this fruit. Phenolic compounds can however be oxidized by the endogenous enzyme polyphenol-oxidase (PPO) that catalyses two different reactions involving oxygen: the o-hydroxylation of monophenols to o-diphenols (monophenolase-activity) and the subsequent oxidation of o-diphenols to o-quinones (diphenolase-activity). These quinones are highly reactive to other quinones, amino acids or proteins producing a considerable nutritional loss. The lability of monophenolase-activity during the purification of plant and fruit PPOs is well-known being necessary the use of gentle methods based on non-ionic detergents to preserve it. In this study, we analyzed the monophenolase-activity showing that the use of Triton X-114 preserves this activity. Enzymatic oxidation of 3-(p-Hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid in presence of 3-Methyl-2-Benzothiazolinone-hydrazone was followed spectrophotometrically at 500 nm. PPO was in a latent state and was activated by acid shock and by SDS although when used jointly inhibited the enzyme. A substrate inhibition was observed for the higher substrate concentrations with an apparent ksi of 6.1 mM. Results: Expression plasmids for AcsA and His-tagged AcsA were constructed and both were expressed in Escherichia coli. Each of the enzymes was purified to homogeneously. Both types of enzymes showed same specific activity and kinetic properties for acyl-CoA synthesis. Using the highly purified His-tagged AcsA, we detected a new reaction product during the examination of the ability to catalyze the ligation of various acids and CoA analogs. The reaction product was identified by NMR. We measured molar amount of reaction products formed and accompanying decreases in the substrates at several time points, and determined the reaction stoichiometry. Based on these findings, we found a novel substrate specificity of acyl-CoA synthetase involved in nitrile degradation.",

One way is the reduction of apoptosis related genes and the other is the induction of the development related genes at HCC stage.

The Atcay gene encodes a protein, Caytaxin, which is defective in human Cayman-type ataxia and hereditary ataxia/dystonia of mice and rats. We show that the N-terminal region of Caytaxin binds to kinesin light chain-1 (KLC-1) by yeast two-hybrid assay and immunoprecipitation. Here, we report evidence indicating that Caytaxin is an adaptor that tethers cargoes to kinesin1. Analysis with deletion and replacement mutants demonstrates that KLC-1 binds to the ELEWED (115-120 aa) sequence of Caytaxin. This sequence is conserved among Caytaxin/ BNIP family proteins and shows high similarity to KLC-1 binding motifs found in a neuron-specific vesicular membrane protein, Calsyntenin, which is bound to and transported by kinesin. When expressed in rat primary hippocampal neurons, GFP-fused Caytaxin shows a granular distribution pattern and each granule moves in neurites at 1 micrometer/second, a speed coincided with the movement of kinesin motors. Endogenous Caytaxin is distributed both in axons and dendrites in a similar granular pattern. Some part of Caytaxin is colocalized with vesicles and mitochondria in neurites and some is condensed in the presynaptic region. Caytaxin is predominantly detected in the molecular layer of the cerebellum and in the inner plexiform layer of the retina. Because these two regions consist mainly of axons, dendrites and synapses, these staining patterns support the idea that Caytaxin is transported from the neural cell body to neurites and concentrated in synapses. All together, it is highly plausible that Caytaxin is a kinesin adaptor which bridges cargoes and kinesin motors.",

Lipocalin-type prostaglandin (PG) D synthase (L-PGDS) is responsible for the production of PGD 2 , a potent endogenous sleep substance, and is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as beta-trace, a major protein of human CSF. L-PGDS is a member of the lipocalin gene family, which consists of small secretory transporter proteins, and binds various lipophilic ligands, such as retinoic acid, retinal, biliverdin, bilirubin, gangliosides, and amyloid-beta peptides with high affinities (Kd = 30 to 200 nM). As PGD 2 is chemically unstable in aqueous solution and is non-enzymatically converted to the J-type PGs, such as PGJ 2 , D 12 -PGJ 2 , and 15-deoxy-D 12,14 -PGJ 2 in vitro, we hypothesized that PGD 2 may be bound to L-PGDS/beta-trace in the CSF and transported to its receptors, DP 1 and DP 2 . Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that PGD 2 bound to L-PGDS with high affinities (Kd = 20 nM). When PGD 2 was incubated in the presence of 5 lM L-PGDS, the J-type PGs were not detected for six hours, indicating that L-PGDS stabilized PGD 2 by binding. In contrast, albumin accelerated the conversion of PGD 2 to the J-type PGs. On the other hand, when J-type PGs were incubated with L-PGDS, they were covalently bound by L-PGDS within 30 minutes. Moreover, we identified the key residues of PGD 2 -binding by NMR analysis of PGD 2 -LPGDS complex and by site-directed mutagenesis. We, therefore, propose that PGD 2 is stabilized via binding to L-PGDS providing a stable transport towards its receptors. Moreover, L-PGDS consecutively acts as scavenger for J-type PGs through covalent binding providing a balance in the biological PGD 2 system. A calorimetric study on the interaction of different PEG containing diblock copolymers including SA400, SA600, SA1500 and OA1500 (stearyl and oleyl esters of polyethylene glycol with 400, 600, 1500 molecular weights respectively) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was carried out using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and circular dichroism (CD). ITC data show that SA400, SA600, SA1500 and OA1500 bind to BSA, with association constants of (14.5, 3.16, 50.7 and 17.6) \u00b7103M-1 respectively. Results also show that the binding is enthalpically driven, disfavored by conformational entropy.Thermal denaturation studies show that these polymers cause anincerment in melting temperature about 1 to 3 centigrade. It can be concluded that diblock copolymers bind to BSA better than their constituent PEGs causing an increment in its Tm; SA1500 is showing the strongest effect.",

            "text": "Oxy-radical induced protein damage and loss of fluorescence of GFP Small amounts of highly reactive oxygen species (oxy-radicals) are normal by-products of cellular metabolism. However, under certain conditions large amounts of oxy-radicals are generated inside cells. These oxy-radicals are known to cause extensive cellular damage by causing DNA-breakage, lipid (membrane) oxidation, and extensive protein damage. Not surprisingly, a large number of disease states have been linked to oxidative stress, including cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and heart disease. Previously, we had shown that fluorescence spectroscopy could be used to study the pH-dependence of GFP denaturation with various agents. In this report, we show that GFP readily undergoes oxidative damage (increased protein carbonyl formation) upon exposure to oxy-radicals leading to concomitant loss of fluorescence. Therefore, using GFP fluorescence spectroscopy, it is possible to study oxy-radical induced protein damage. We have evaluated the various parameters which could affect the sensitivity of this GFP-based oxy-radical induced protein damage assay, such as concentration H 2 O 2 used to produce oxy-radicals, pH of the buffer, as well as UV intensity. Surprisingly, we found that pH had a very dramatic effect on oxy-radical induced GFP damage. GFP was found to be most susceptible to oxy-radical induced damage at pH 6.5, and least susceptible at pH 8.5. This is the first demonstration that GFP looses its fluorescence upon exposed to oxy-radicals. Furthermore, the data presented here suggest that GFP could be used to develop assays to assess protein oxidative damage as well as to screen antioxidants. Short shelf life is of the upmost importance in fruit conservation. As living organisms, fruits maintain metabolism after harvesting, and its shelf-life can be extended by reducing respiration rates. This can be done by controlling factors such as temperature, light, humidity and gas composition (ethylene, O 2 and CO 2 ). To control these, an important strategy is the use of modified atmospheres, with low caloric galactomannan coatings. Collagen coatings have, also, already been used on meat and sausage to reduce gas and/or water vapor permeability (WVP). In this work the preparation novel edible coatings, based on the mixture of galactomannan, collagen and glycerol, was investigated, and their influence in gas transfer rates in mangoes and apples evaluated. The gas permeability properties of the coatings, presenting the best values of wettability (previously determined), were tested. Mangoes coated with an Adenanthera pavonina seed endospermic galactomannan-collagen-glycerol solution were studied and the gas transfer rates compared with no coated mangoes. Gas transfer rate was calculated and )28% O 2 consumption and )11% CO 2 production were observed in coated mangoes. The same procedure was done (using Caesalpinea pulcherrima galactomannan) in apples. The CO 2 production and O 2 consumption were approximately 50% lower in coated apples. These results suggest that these coatings, reducing gas transfer rates, may be important tools to extend fruit shelf-life. Acknowledgement: Supported by CAPES/CNPq, VALNATURA, FCT, RENORBIO.",

Conclusions: We found a new protease that is being analyzed functionally and structurally. We report the biochemical characterization of proteases isolated from Aelia rostrata that produce gluten degradation in wheat flour. Firstly, we determined the dough extensibility by measuring W and P/L parameters with the Chopin Alveograph. We also analysed the peptides released after gluten hydrolysis in wheat flour samples by SDS-PAGE and capillary electrophoresis. Then, we determined in A. rostrata (salivary glands and midguts from adults and whole-body nymphs) samples, the biochemical activities of aspartyl proteases (optimum pH 3) and aminopeptidases (optimum pH 7), using specific substrates (hemoglobin and LpNa, respectively) and inhibitors (pepstatin-A and CdCl 2 , respectively). Other protein activities were evaluated such as cystein, trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase proteases, without finding any activity. Likewise, only aspartyl protease (optimum pH 3) and aminopeptidase (optimum pH 6.5), activities were identified in wheat flour samples. Finally, the proteolytic activity have been analysed by 2Dzymography using hemoglobin, gelatin and gliadin as substrates. We observed a band of activity in the native zymogram using hemoglobin and incubated at 35\u00b0C and pH 3 in A. rostrata (larvae) and wheat flour samples, which correspond to a M r between 66 KDa and 132 KDa.

Myospryn is a TRIM-like protein which has been found to interact with dysbindin, which is a component the soluble fraction Biogenesis Lysosomes Related Organelles Complex 1 (BLOC-1) which is involved in protein trafficking and organelle biogenesis.

Desmin seems to be essential for the appropriate perinuclear localization myospryn since its pattern is altered in cardiomyocytes from des-min null neonatal mice. The association myospryn with intermediate filaments, suggests a potential role desmin in vesicle trafficking. The in vivo role myospryn is under investigation using the zebrafish model. Using a splice morpholino for knocking down myospryn transcript, we observed abnormalities in heart development.

The forced expression of BI-1/TEGT under elongagion factor (EF) promoter resulted in reduced stress-induced apoptosis in HEK 293 and TEGT MEF cells. We could also observe that BI-1/ TEGT suppressed etoposide-induced ROS production concomitant with the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway.

To study the effect of the forced expression of BI-1/TEGT in vivo during oocyte and embryo development, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing BI-1/TEGT or BI-1/TEGT-DC. MEF cells from BI-1/TEGT transgenic mice showed higher ERK phosphorylation than those from the wild-type or BI-1/TEGT-DC transgenic mice. During breeding of the respective transgenic lines, we recognized that litter sizes were dramatically reduced in BI-1/TEGT-overexpressing transgenic mice compared to that of the wild-type or BI-1/TEGT-DC transgenic mice.

Kaempferol treatment was shown to profoundly induce the generation of fluorescent DCF in the MCF-7 cells, and treatment with N-acetyl cysteine suppressed kaempferol-induced PARP cleavage. Moreover, because breast cancer is associated with increased collagen synthesis and accumulation, we utilized a collagen-based 3D culture method. Under the 3-dimensional culture condition employed herein, kaempferol treatment was shown to result in a significant reduction in cell viability, an effect which occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with what was observed under conventional 2D culture condition, we observed more evident apoptotic cell death and ERK activation as the result of kaempferol treatment in a collagen-based 3D culture environment. Similar to the case of conventional 2D cultured cells, the addition of PD98059 significantly suppressed intracellular ROS production. Collectively, these results show that the sustained activation of the ERK signaling pathway is markedly involved in kaempferol-induced apoptosis of breast cancer MCF-7 cells, and that this effect is more evident under 3D culture condition. Epithelial cells from proximal tubule and small intestine actively transport Na + by two different mechanisms: the Na + /K + -pump, associated with the ouabain-sensitive Na + /K + -ATPase, and the second sodium pump whose enzymatic expression has been attributed to the ouabaininsensitive Na + -ATPase. Recently, this last enzyme has been isolated, purified, cloned and silenced, differentiating it from the Na + /K + -ATPase. In this paper, we describe the preparation of chicken IgY polyclonal antibodies against the Na + -and Na + /K + -ATPase and evaluate the differential distribution of these enzymes in intestinal and renal tissues. Additionally, the effects of these antibodies on the Na +and Na + /K + -ATPase activities and active Na + -transport were evaluated. The anti-Na + -ATPase IgY specifically inhibited both ouabaininsensitive Na + -transport and Na + -ATPase activity without any effect on ouabain-sensitive Na + -extrusion nor Na + /K + -ATPase. In contrast, the anti-Na + /K + -ATPase IgY specifically inhibited ouabain-sensitive Na + -transport and Na + /K + -ATPase. The anti-Na + -ATPase IgY recognized the a and b subunits of the Na + -ATPase but did not interacted with the purified Na + /K + -ATPase. On the other hand, the anti-Na + /K + -ATPase IgY only recognized the Na + /K + -ATPase. The Na + -ATPase was identified, by immunoblot and RT-PCR, in renal cortex, jejune, ileum, proximal and distal colon, being absent in renal medulla. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis shown that the Na + -ATPase is preferentially expressed in villous, surface colonic and proximal renal tubule epithelial cells, but absent in renal medulla, contrasting with the uniform distribution of the Na + / K + -ATPase. The preferential location of the Na + -ATPase at small intestine villi and renal proximal tubules could reflect the physiological relevance of this enzyme in intestinal and renal sodium and water absorption.",

SCD1 deficiency activates metabolic pathways that promote fatty acid b-oxidation and decrease lipogenesis in liver. In the present study, we show that fatty acid (FA) transport and oxidation are decreased, whereas glucose uptake and oxidation are increased in the heart of SCD1-/-mice. The level of fatty acid translocase/CD36 and fatty acid transport proteins were significantly lower (by 50 and 70%, respectively) in the heart of SCD1-/-mice compared to SCD1+/+ mice. Both carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 protein level and activity were significantly decreased (by 40 and 31%, respectively) in the heart of SCD1-/-mice in comparison to SCD1+/+ controls. Consequently, the rate of palmitoyl-CoA oxidation was decreased by 37.1% in the heart of SCD1-/-mice. mRNA levels of PPARa, a key transcription factor controlling genes of fatty acid oxidation, were significantly reduced in SCD1-/-mice, whereas phosphorylation and protein levels of AMPK-a were not affected by SCD1 deficiency. Phosphorylation of both insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) after insulin injection were about 2-fold higher in the heart of SCD1-/-mice. Also the association of ?p85 subunit of PI3kinase with IRS-1 was significantly higher under both basal and insulin stimulated conditions in SCD1-/-hearts. This increased insulin sensitivity translated to a 1.8-fold greater 2-deoxyglucose uptake and 2-fold higher rate of glucose oxidation in the myocardium, compared to SCD1+/+ counterparts. The results suggest that SCD1 deficiency causes a shift in cardiac substrate utilization from FA to glucose by upregulating insulin signaling, decreasing FA availability, and reducing expression of FA oxidation genes in the heart. . Despite of its distinctive advantages, the limitation in the thermostability of the enzyme required to be enhanced. The wild type FDH from Candida methylica (cmFDH) does not contain disulphide bridges, but does possess two cysteine residues buried in separate hydrophobic pockets. Cysteine residues are particularly susceptible to atmospheric oxidation at elevated temperatures. One approach to increase thermostability is to replace both cysteine resides by valine, C23V and C262V. The second approach is stabilizing via engineering disulphide bridges into the protein: I239C (to partner C262) and A153C (to partner C23). If a disulphide bridge can be engineered into the native fold without introducing an enthalpic cost (strain), such a bridge would stabilize the native state by decreasing the entropy of the protein's unfolded state 3 .",

Smoking is one of the most important cause of cardiovascular disease and known as a preventable risk factor. Oxidized LDL increases the risk for cardiovascular disease. Normal high density lipoproteins (HDLs) protect LDL from oxidation; proinflammatory HDLs do not. The aim of this study was to determine whether the young smokers have more proinflammatory HDL which predispose them to cardiovascular disease than nonsmokers. Methods: Twenty-five young smokers (SM), who have smoking 8-10 years and twenty-five healthy nonsmokers (CNT) were included in this study. Blood samples were collected after overnight fast and absence of smoking. The ability of the cases' HDL to prevent oxidation of normal LDL was measured. Values >1.0 (the value assigned for LDL oxidation in the absence of HDL) after the addition of HDL indicated proinflammatory HDL. Total-C, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, Apo A, Apo B, hsCRP and Lp (a) levels were also determined in our clinical laboratory using routine standard methods. Results: The smokers had more proinflammatory HDL than nonsmokers (median score 1.01, vs. 0.92, P < 0.001). A higher proportion of smokers had proinflammatory HDL: 68% of smokers versus 20% of nonsmokers had scores >1.0. Conclusion: We concluded that smoking impairs HDLs anti inflammatory functions. This may indicate that proinflammatory HDL have a role in atherosclerosis process of smokers.",

            "text": "Refolding of denatured alkaline phosphatase assisted by a new synthetic stripping agent The 'artificial chaperone method' developed by Rozema and Gellman [1] is an elegant method for protein refolding with higher yields compared to other methods. From industrial point of view, this method suffers from the tedious steps of purifications which will finally affect the production costs. Replacement of the soluble stripping agent with immobilized CDs or CD polymer beads might elevate some of these problems. Regarding this fact, we synthesized and evaluated the application of various cyclodextrin-bonded silica gels to improve the refolding efficiency of denatured alkaline phosphatase in artificial chaperone approach. Our results indicated that, under this condition, refolding of denatured alkaline phosphatase raised from 30%, in the absence of chaperone, to about 65% in the presence of 70 mg/ml of the b-cyclodextrin-bonded silica gel and to 74% in the concomitant presence of the this stripping agent and MgSO 4 , a yield near to stripping by soluble b-CD. This new stripping approach, compared to the common method, will reduce the protein refolding costs at the industrial level. However, further improvements in this technique are demanded either through synthesizing better stripping agents or by optimizing better refolding environments. The endocannabinoid system is characterized in a number of mammalian cells. In previous studies we reported that Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme which is responsible for the inactivation of anandamide (arachidonoylethanolamide, AEA), is present in Tetrahymena pyriformis. The ciliate Tetrahymena is a model organism for molecular and cellular biology and its genome sequence is available. In this study, using Tetrahymena thermophila cell homogenate, we found that 2-arachidonylglycerol ([ 3 H]2-AG), as well as 2-oleylglycerol ([ 3 H]2-OG), were hydrolyzed to [ 3 H]ethanolamine and respective fatty acid, by the action of two enzymes, FAAH and a monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL)-like enzyme. The latter, was partially characterized in the presence of the specific FAAH inhibitor URB597. Our results show that 2-AG was metabolized by T. thermophila cell homogenate in a time and concentration dependent manner, by the action of two enzymes (FAAH and MAGL), since in the presence of the inhibitor, its degradation was significantly decreased, indicating the involvement of FAAH. MAGL activity was maximal at pH 8-9 and kinetic experiments demonstrated that the enzyme had an apparent K m of 14.1 lM and V max of 5.8 nmol/min.mg. Subcellular fractionation of T. thermophila homogenate showed that MAGL activity was present in the cytosolic and membrane fraction. Similar results were obtained using a second specific FAAH inhibitor, AM374. In conclusion, MAGL and FAAH as well, could inactivate endogenous signaling lipids which might have important roles in Tetrahymena as suggested in mammals and invertebrates; their presence in protists suggests the importance of the endocannabinoid system throughout the evolution.

Methods: Mutations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis at residues D255, E286, and D380 to identify the essential catalytic residues of MTHase, while mutations at residues W218, A259, Y328, F355, and R356 were constructed to identify selectivity-related residues of the enzyme. Results: The specific activity of the purified D255A, E286A, and D380A MTHases were only 0.15, 0.09 and 0.01%, respectively, of that of wild-type MTHase, suggesting these three residues are essential catalytic residues. Compared with wild-type MTHase, A259S, Y328F, F355Y, and R356K MTHases had increased selectivity ratios, which were defined as the ratios of the catalytic efficiencies for glucose formation to those for trehalose formation in the hydrolysis of maltooligosaccharides and maltooligosyltrehaloses, respectively, while W218A and W218F MTHases had decreased selectivity ratios. When starch digestion was carried out at 75\u00b0C and wild-type and mutant MTHases were, respectively, used with isoamylase and maltooligosyltrehalose synthase (MTSase), the ratios of initial rates of glucose formation to those of trehalose formation were inversely correlated to the peak trehalose yields. Conclusions: We have confirmed the catalytic roles of D255, E286, and D380 and suggested the existence of two hydrogen bonds between substrate and the enzyme at position W218. The lower ratios of the initial rate of glucose formation to that of trehalose formation from the digestion of soluble starch predict high trehalose yield. The venom is a rich source of biochemically active enzymes, proteins, peptides and low molecular weight compounds. The scorpion venom peptides are particularly interesting for pharmaceutical, agrochemical and protein engineering purposes because of their remarkable diversity, molecular targets, and their flexible loops despite rigid scaffold. In this report, after separation of mucopeptides with ultracentrifugation peptidic components of Mesobuthus eupeus eupeus crude venom were fractionated into 5 parts by gel filtration chromatography and Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. The peptides of fourth part were isolated to more than 95% purity by means of repeated chromatography including cation exchange chromatography and repeated RP-HPLC. Then two peptides were characterized by amino acid analysis, molecular weight and N-terminal sequence determination. Using these information, one of these peptides showed high similarity of molecular weight and N-terminal sequence with the toxic peptide BeI4 (Insectotoxin4) from this scorpion venom. The structure of BeI4 is not known but it has high similarity to BeI5A; so we decided to model them with MODELLER8v1 software from BeI5A template which has 97% sequence similarity and identity based on sequence alignment data from CLUSTALW. After energy minimization, analysis of the H-bond pattern and secondary structures with STRIDE and Swiss PDB viewer softwares showed high accordance of BeI5A template for BeI4 with RMSD < 0.57 for a-carbon. This structure will be relaxed and refined by doing molecular dynamic simulation with explicit water solvation. To unravel the binding modes and details of interaction with potassium channels, the next step will be docking simulation of the modeled peptide. Amburana cearensis A.C. Smith is a tree species of economic importance found in northeastern semiarid region of Brazil, where it has been under intensive pressure due to its use as rare, fine and high quality wood by the furniture industry. On the other hand, A. cearensis is a medicinal plant commonly known as 'cumaru', important for the native people on the preparation syrup out of crushed seeds which is used for the treatment of respiratory tract diseases. Seed development is genetically programmed and correlated with changes on metabolite levels. Differentiation occurs successively starting from the maternal tissues followed by the filial organs (embryo/endosperm), which later become later specialized storage tissues at seed maturity. The mobilization of storage materials such as carbohydrates, lipids and proteins by activation or de novo synthesis of key enzymes may underlie the mechanism of seed imbibitions and germination, and seedling establishment in places such as the semiarid where the availability of water is limited. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of water restriction on the germination of A. cearensis, under various levels of osmotic stress. Levels of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins were analyzed in parallel with western blot analysis of the accumulation of tubulin during seed imbibition and germination, under various level of osmotic stress. Changes in metabolite levels as signals in seed metabolism and developmental processes under stress were evidenced and analyzed in the perspective of multiplication protocols aimed at sustainable use of A. cearensis. Jatropha curcas (Euphorbiaceae) is a native multipurpose oilseed plant species which is well adapted to heat and water restriction in the northeastern semi-arid region of Brazil. Its seeds is nowadays the most valuable end product as a source of oil and, therefore, as an alternative crop for renewable energy. The species has also many traditional medicinal uses among the local population against diseases such as dysentery, haemorrhoid, gonorrhoea, small pox. Storage proteins, carbohydrates and oils are synthesized and accumulate as source of reserves during seed development and maturation, which are then subject to hydrolytic breakdown upon seed imbibition as source of nitrogen and carbon skeletons for the germinating seed and seedling growth. The objective of the present study was to study the mechanisms underlying the germination of J. curcas under water restriction. Seeds of J. curcas obtained from three different semi-arid provenances were submitted to biochemical and molecular analysis during germination under various levels of osmotic stress. Additionally, the expression of stress-associated genes was monitored during germination and seedling growth under stress. Oil was extracted using n-hexane and mixture of other solvents. The extracted oils were immediately analyzed for physicochemical properties and mineral composition. The overall analysis demonstrated differences among seeds from different provenances as well during seed imbibition under stress conditions, allowing a better understanding of the metabolic and molecular mechanisms underlying the germination process, aimed at multiplication protocols for sustainable use of J. curcas under the stress conditions of the Brazilian northeastern semi-arid. Peripheral nerve surgery has always been a challenging problem in the context of scar formation. Suppressing the formation of this disturbing tissue is therefore a holly grail in treating peripheral nerve injuries. When studying the scar-suppressing potential of a given substance or treatment, investigators usually deliberately induce the formation of scar tissue. Depending on the intervention (physical or chemical), the resulted scar varies in quantity and quality which is usually less intensive and durable than that of humans. Physical intrusions seem to be more relevant to clinical situations than chemical ones. The aim of this study is to evaluate scar formation by four physical interventions: slashing, crushing, mincing and burning of the muscular bed of sciatic nerve. Thirty-two female Wistar rats were divided into four groups, each sustaining one of the mentioned intrusions. Animals were followed for 4 weeks, and with one week intervals, by macroscopic, microscopic and functional assessments. While the results of macroscopic and microscopic evaluations reveal the higher capacity of mincing procedure in producing a more intense and lasting scar tissue, functional assessment showed no differences among the groups in hampering sciatic nerve function; however all the groups demonstrated significant difference with the normal-functioning nerve. Our data suggest that except one intervention (mincing), others were almost equipotent in scar induction. It can be concluded that of these four interventions, and in the context of severity and persistency, the mincing procedure induces a scar tissue more comparable to what occurs in humans. Effects of such scar models on histology of the nerve along with injury-bearing nerves subjected to scar formation are issues to be investigated by further studies.",

Soll University of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico, USA Introduction: The employment of proteins as biotherapeutic agents has gained increased interest due to their chemical selectivity and catalytic efficiency when compared to small molecules. Solid protein pharmaceuticals often suffer from instability problems due to moisture adsorption thus hampering their successful therapeutic application. One frequently formulated hypothesis is that partial protein hydration from moisture adsorption increases protein structural motions leading to protein unfolding and aggregation. Our goal is that, once understanding the molecular mechanisms by which residual moisture influences the solid state stability of protein pharmaceuticals, it will become possible to develop rational stabilization strategies to prevent these degradation processes. Methods: To test the hypothesis, lyophilized insulin and a-chymotrypsin powder was incubated at various relative humidities for different time intervals. Formation of buffer insoluble and soluble aggregates was monitored for these samples. To detect unfolding/refolding events occurring to the solid protein, these were analyzed by FTIR and Circular Dichroism after incubation. Results: Results showed that the protein forms aggregates upon storage in humidity chambers. Furthermore long-term storage of the proteins at increasing levels of residual moisture increases the formation of aggregates with this effect also increasing with storage time. Moreover results showed that the protein looses its native-like structure after storage for 1 week. This suggests that high moisture levels cause detrimental events in the protein such as, structural perturbations. Conclusions: This study has showed that residual moisture plays an important role in the denaturation and aggregation of protein. Stabilization strategies as PEGylation and glycosylation are going to be studied to reduce or prevent these phenomena.",

Furthermore, mitoK ATP activation in isolated brain mitochondria significantly prevented H 2 O 2 release by these organelles, but did not change Ca 2+ accumulation capacity. Interestingly, the activity of mitoK ATP was highly dependent on redox state. Thiol reductant mercaptopropionylglycine prevented mitoK ATP activity, while exogenous ROS activated the channel. In addition, the use of mitochondrial substrates that lead to higher levels of endogenous mitochondrial ROS release closely correlated with enhanced K + transport activity through mitoK ATP .

Inui 1   1 Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan, 2 Spring-8/JASRI, Hyogo, JAPAN Introduction: Lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) is a unique dual functional protein acting as both a PGD 2 -synthesizing enzyme and an extracellular transporter protein for hydrophobic ligands. L-PGDS possesses the broad ligand selectivity and binds to a large variety of hydrophobic ligands, such as retinoids, thyroids, and bile pigments with high affinities in vitro. So far many drugs have been dropped out from the development because of their poor water solubility, although they have high pharmaceutical activities. In this study, we performed the concept validation of drug delivery system in vivo using L-PGDS for diazepam (DZP), a benzodiazepine anxiolytic and poorly water-soluble drug. Results and Discussion: L-PGDS improved the solubility of DZP in a concentration-dependent manner, and in the presence of 500 ?M L-PGDS the solubility was 7-fold higher than that in PBS. DZP is well-known to enhance the anesthetic effect via activating GABA A receptor. DZP of 10 mM was mixed with L-PGDS (25, 100, and 250 ?M in 5 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0) and passed through a filter to remove DZP left insoluble. L-PGDS/DZP complex was administered intracerebroventricularly in mice 10 minutes before giving an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (35 mg/kg), and duration of pentobarbital-induced loss of righting reflex (LORR) was measured. Mice treated with complex showed significantly 1.5-fold longer duration of LORR than those treated with DZP in buffer. These results show that L-PGDS delivers DZP to GABA A receptor as a solubilizer and the concept of DDS for hydrophobic drugs using L-PGDS is succeeded to validate.",

Numerous in vitro cell culture studies have also reported genistein to be cytotoxic, DNA damaging and proapoptotic. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the two isoflavones: genistein and genistein-8-C-glucoside (G8CG) in combination on cultured human ovarian cancer SK-OV-3 cells and immortalized Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells. In the current investigation we used genistein and glycosylated genistein G8CG, which we isolated from flowers of lupine (Lupinus luteus L.). The possible cytotoxic and apoptotic properties of genistein and G8CG in combination was examined in vitro. Methods: The calcein AM/propidium iodide assay was used to assess cytotoxicity and Hoechst 33258/propidium iodide staining technique was employed for the induction of apoptotic cell death. The morphological changes of cells were also examined in inverted confocal microscopy. Mitochondrial membrane potential changes, in genistein-G8CG treated cells, were monitored using fluorescence probe JC-1 by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. The cells were exposed to three different concentrations (10, 50 and 100 lM) of combination genistein-G8CG and incubated for 2, 24 and 48 h. Results: Our results indicate that the mixture of isoflavones inhibits cell viability, induces apoptotic cell death and causes mitochondrial membrane potential alteration in cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Conclusions: Our preliminary in vitro studies, provide the first evidence that the combination of genistein and G8CG could demonstrate anti-cancer properties.",

            "text": "PP8-61 Interstitial telomeres in continuous in vitro growth In mammalian tumors telomere length is almost universally maintained through telomerase (TERT) or by a much less common alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) which involves telomeric recombination. However, cancers develop in the absence of telomerase and their proliferation potential can be substituted by recombinatorial mechanisms. We applied telomeric PNA FISH, in a panel of 12 telomerase positive, and six ALT continuous human cell lines to investigate types and frequencies of chromosome rearrangements involving telomeric repeats, to quantify the length of the telomeric tracts involved, and to identify mechanisms responsible for their generation. Interstitial telomeric repeats were present in both types of telomere restoration but were pronounced in the ALT cells. The orientation of interstitial telomeric repeats by CO-FISH and M-FISH/SKY showed three categories of interstitial telomeres: (a) clonal, inverted intra-chromosomal duplications, (b) clonal, originating by variable length telomere-to-telomere inter-chromosomal fusions and (c) random dicentric or polycentric chromosomes with interstitial telomeres at their junction points. We evaluated the generation of interstitial telomeres in the ALT VA-13 cells and a TRAP positive derivative of the same cell line (VA-13+hTERC+hTERT) and after induction of DNA breaks by with c-radiation, or depletion of telomerase and the telomere protecting factor POT1 by RNA interference. Our data indicate that telomerase and POT1 activity suppressed random inter-telomere recombination whereas telomerase inhibition leads to chromosome fusions without measurable interstitial telomeres. Introduction: a-Amylase (a-1,4-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.1), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of amylose, amylopectin, and related carbohydrates with endo-acting property on 1,4-glycosidic linkages, is among of the most important industrial enzymes with widespread applications. A Bacillus sp. WHO, which produces an extracellular a-amylase, was isolated from the high natural radiation area in Ramsar. Material and Methods: The a-amylase gene from this Bacillus strain was cloned in vector pTZ57R/T and its nucleotide sequence was determined. It was subcloned in the expression vector (pET21a) and transferred to BL21 strain of E. coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified under denaturing conditions by Ni-NTA Agarose. Results: The gene has an open reading frame composed of 1563 bases, which encode 520 amino acid residues and shows high sequence homologies with other microbial amylase, such as Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus sp. WS06 (97 and 96% identity). The deduced amino acid sequence contains four highly conserved sequences (regions I, II, III, IV) of the a-amylase family. The molecular mass of the recombinant enzyme was 64 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme was Ca 2+ -dependent and the optimum pH and temperature was 7.0, and 50\u00b0C, respectively. Conclusion: This enzyme with low homology with BLA and BAA is an interesting candidate for studying of its thermostability. Future investigations will focus on enhancing the thermostability and determination of amino acids has effects on it by site-directed mutagenesis method.",

            "text": "Results: Acarbose is a strong competitive inhibitor of L 14 -APU enzyme with respect to pullulan and starch. This results showed the enzyme hydrolyzes both a-1,4 and a-1,6 glycosidic bonds at the same active site. Divalent cations such as Ni 2+ , Cu 2+ inhibited the amylolytic and pullulytic activities while Ba 2+ had no effect. Against Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ and Co 2+ enhanced both activities of the enzyme. The L 14 -APU activity on 1% (w/v) pullulan and starch was not influenced after preincubation of the enzyme with a-cyclodextrin (0.1%) which is generally known as possible competitive inhibitors of pullulanase type II. In the presence of 1 mM SDS pullulanase activity increased by 46%. As observed for most pullulanase, both L 14 -APU activities was completely eliminated by low concentration of N-boromosuccinimide (0.01%) which oxidizes tryptophan and histidine residues, suggesting the crucial involvement of these residues at the active site. Conclusion: In general, abolishment of both activities of the enzyme by NBS, similar effects of metal ions and reagents on the enzyme activity, identity of the pattern of acarbose inhibition and reduction in the rate of EPS hydrolysis in the presence of pullulan prove that one single active site is responsible for the cleavage of a-1,4 and a-1,6 glycosidic bonds in this report. We have developed a new bioregulator based on PI designated Rhizoginin-S which stimulates plant cell division very effectively. The invention of Rhizoginin-S was only possible after development of IMBIB participants a simple and effective method of preparation PI, U.S. patent (4,977,091). Thus, developing new culture systems without protein supplements from animal sources will generate safer vaccines. The purpose of our work was studying opportunities of received 'Rhizoginin-S' for acceleration of growth transplantable cultures of cells used in virology. Activity of a preparation studied on its action on culture BHK-21. It were established in the result of carried out investigations that cell growth at 'Rhizoginin-S' addition was increased for 3.2 times. Whereas in medium with serum and buffer, and in medium with usual nutrient medium and serum this index was 2.5 and 2.7 accordingly. Proliferation index at the process of cells growing in medium without serum with addition of 'Rhizoginin-S' was 1.2. Proliferation index in control was 0.8 and 1.0 accordingly. It was marked stimulating effect at cytomorphological investigation BHK-21 cell cultures properties with addition of 'Rhizoginin-S'. This effect was expressed by presence of well-evident nucleolus. While it was shown that in cells untreated by 'Rhizoginin-S' there were no nucleolus. Thus, the data on moderate stimulation proliferation properties of cells and presence of well-defined nucleolus confirm about positive effect of 'Rhizoginin-S' on DNA synthesis in cells. NK cells play a critical role in the immune response against cancer and infected cells. UL16 binding proteins are ligands of NKG2D, which is an activating receptor expressed by NK and T cells. ULBPs show a restricted expression in normal tissues, but they are frequently overexpressed in cancer and infected cells, marking them to be eliminated by the immune system. Here, we characterized that the epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in the regulation of ULBP1-3 expression. The promoters of ULBP1-3 are not methylated, but the structure of chromatin is an essential regulator of their expression. HDAC3 plays a key role in their regulation since it is bound to ULBP1-3 promoters and represses their transcription. Over-expression of HDAC3 decreases ULBP1-3 expression, whereas knockdown of HDAC3 expression using siRNA significantly induced the expression of ULBPs. We also characterized that HDAC3 is over-expressed in colon cancer and our results suggest that this is responsible of the repression of ULBPs expression in these tumors. The promoter analysis coupled with the chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the repression of transcription of ULBP1 is mediated, at least in part, by the interaction with Sp1/ Sp3. Our results also indicated that HDAC2 plays an opposite role in the regulation of ULBPs since its inhibition significantly up-regulated the expression of ULBP1-3. Thus, the opposite effect of several HDACs in ULBPs expression clearly suggest that the development of a specific inhibitors of each HDAC is needed in order to improve the therapeutic efficacy of the HDAC inhibitors.",

To this end, the effect of a single dose of ZEN (40 mg/kg b.w.) alone and with extract of cactus cladodes (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg b.w.) on the induction of oxidative stress was monitored in kidney and liver by measuring the MDA level, the protein carbonyls generation, the Catalase activity and the expression of the Heat Shock Proteins (Hsp). For the genotoxicity assays, we have performed the DNA fragmentation, chromosome aberrations and micronuclei induction. Oxidative damage seems to be a key determinant of ZEN induced toxicity in both liver and kidney of Balb/c mice. The combined treatment of ZEN with the lowest tested dose of cactus extracts (25 mg/kg b.w.) showed a total reduction of ZEN induced oxidative damage for all tested markersSimilar results were found for the DNA damage, Cactus extracts revealed a significaant decrease in DNAG fragmentation chromosome aberrations mainly breaks and the induction of micronuclei. It could be concluded that cactus cladodes extract was effective in the protection against ZEN hazards.

Bathaie Clinical Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, IRAN Introduction: Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) shows different biological properties. Since specific functions have been reported for safranal (a monoterpene aldehyde as saffron aroma and deglycosylated derivative of picrocrocin), the present study aimed to investigate its interaction with calf thymus DNA (ctDNA), oligo(dG-dC) 15 and oligo(dA-dT) 15 in comparison to picrocrocin. Methods: The circular dichroism (CD) and fluorometric results show the non-intercalative or minor groove binding of the mentioned ligands with ctDNA. Results: The CD plots indicate that picrocrocin interacts with DNA and oligonucleotides at lower concentrations than safranal, which is accompanied by B-to C-DNA transition; at higher concentrations, it induces more conformational changes, i.e. unstacking of DNA and oligonucleotides bases as we also previously reported for saffron carotenoids. The similar results are obtained for safranal interaction with ctDNA (56% A.T) and oligo(dA-dT) 15 ; but the CD results indicate a two step mechanism of binding for safranal with oligo(dG-dC) 15 . At lower concentrations of ligand, CD pattern is similar to others; by adding more safranal, the positive peak in the range of 260-280 nm is deconvoluted to two separate peaks. One small peak appears at 260 nm and a higher peak at 285 nm, which are the characteristic peaks of triplehelix formation. A new binding mechanism is suggested for these observations. Conclusions: Results indicated picrocrocin cause more distortion on oligonucleotide structure and induces B to C transition in poly(dG.dC) 15 and poly(dA.dT) 15 . Whereas safranal induces the same effects on poly(dA.dT) 15 , the B-to H-DNA transition is observed due to its interaction with GC reach sequences. Introduction: Glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1), one of the p160 family co-activator proteins, primarily mediates transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors via three activation domains that recruit at least three secondary co-activators, CBP/p300, co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1, and coiled-coil co-activator (CoCoA), which exert histone acetyltransferase and/or arginine methyltransferase enzyme activity. The regulatory mechanisms underlying the GRIP1 co-activation functions involve its post-translational sumoylation by promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML), but are not well understood.",

They were named: Atg1, Atg2, Atg3, Atg4, which are four distinct possible neurotoxins holding the three-finger toxins scaffold, and Atg5, which are an abundant presynaptic type A2 Phospholipase. These five selected candidates were cloned in pSecTag2A, a vector for protein expression in mammal cells. For testing the construction, the candidates were transfected in COS-07 cells (transient transfection). Then, we started the DNA immunization in mice, injecting 100 mg of each candidate cDNA. For the analysis of the immunological response, we produce and purify the recombinant proteins in E. coli. The recombinant proteins were used in the ELISA coating to react with the primary serum originated from the DNA immunization, in order to evaluate the immunological response. The results showed that the serum of immunized animals were able to recognize the recombinant antigens. This indicates that the DNA immunization in mice could be a good alternative to crude venom immunization, which is costly and relies on venom availability. It is a promissory result since the antibody production could be achieved via intramuscular immunization, which is practical for producing purposes. Therefore, we are optimistic and ready to proceed with the next experiments, which will be to evaluate two other possible immunization methods: the Gene-Gun immunization and the liposome.

These toxins frequently contaminate food and feed crops and have been classified as group I carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Antibody-based assays are among the most effective techniques available for the measurement and detection aflatoxins. The performance these methods is influenced by the specificity and the sensitivity the antibodies used. The present work is the first step the development recombinant antibodies against aflatoxins with increased specificity and sensitivity and their expression in foreign hosts. By using indirect ELISA 10 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against aflatoxins B1, B2 and G1 were selected as potential candidates for the protein engineering studies. Their affinity and crossreactivity to the different types aflatoxins were characterized by indirect and competitive ELISA. The hybridoma cells producing these mAb's were used for the total RNA isolation, subsequent cDNA synthesis and amplification gene fragments coding for immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable regions. The fragments obtained were cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis showed that the mAb's have different heavy chains, but only two types light chains. It can be inferred from these findings that the difference in mAb's affinity and cross-reactivity is provided by their heavy chain structure. These data could serve as a basis for the development recombinant antibodies characterized by improved affinity and specificity parameters. Introduction: Preparation polyelectrolyte complexes natural and synthetic macromolecules appears to be a great importance for medicine and biotechnology in particular with respect to design immunogenic compounds for vaccine innovation (1) . In this study copolymers vinyl pyrrolidone/acrylic acid (VP/AA) were used as a carrier polyelectrolyte. As a novel part this work, microwave energy was used for conjugation reaction between polyelectrolye and synthetic peptides. Methods: Synthesized viral peptides VP1 135-161 (WSKYSTT-GERTRGDLGALAARVATQLPA) and VP1 200-213 (WDRHKQRI-IAPAKQLQ) defined from foot and mouth disease viruse's (FMDV) capsid protein sequences. Two different types conjugation method between peptides and VP/AA was used in this study. Water media conjugation was proceeded in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). EDC was used for carboxyl group's activation at pH 5. Reaction takes 36 hours in 4\u00b0C. Organic conjugation was proceeded in DMF. HBTU, HOBt was used for carboxyl group's activation. Reaction takes only 1.5 hours. Microwave used 25 W for maximum 75\u00b0C. LC-MS system (Shimadzu LC-MS 2010 EV) with ESI (Electrospray Ionization) method and GPC Viscotek TDA 302 with four detectors were used for characterization synthetic peptides and their conjugates. Results and Conclusions: Figure 1 indicates that microwave assisted organic conjugation peptide and copolymer gives more efficient labeling according to water media conjugation. Also polydispersity index the organic conjugation smaller than the water media conjugation. This indicates that organic conjugation more homogenious than water media conjugation. Introduction: The HCV, GBV-B and GBV-C RNA viruses, all members the Flaviviridae family, exhibit a great similarity on their genome organization encoding for a precursor polyprotein that is processed to give the structural and the non-structural viral proteins. Initiation translation, in these viruses, is cap-independent and is driven by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), located mainly within the 5\u00a2 non-coding region. Recent data suggested that different viral proteins can regulate the activity the HCV IRES. Among them, HCV NS5A has been shown to down-regulate the HCV IRES in a specific and dose dependent manner. The aim this study is to investigate whether the above property HCV NS5A is conserved across the members the Flaviviridae family, and to examine whether the effect HCV NS5A can be exchanged with that the homologue proteins. Methods: To address these issues, transient transfection was carried out using two different plasmid vectors. The first expresses a bicistronic transcriptional unit carrying the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and the firefly luciferase (LUC) genes separated by the HCV or GBV-B IRES sequences. The other, expresses separately the NS5A HCV, GBV-B, and GBV-C.",

In this study, yields 5-ALA synthesized from classical Propionibacterium species including the effects various precursors and ALA dehydratase inhibitor on 5-ALA accumulation were investigated. We found that P. acidipropionici produced 5-ALA at 34.1 mg/l which was 3-5 folds higher than that produced by the other species. The production 5-ALA in P. acidipropionici was enhanced to 38.7, 39.6, and 47.2 mg/l in the presence 1 g/l levulinic acid, 1 g/l glutamate, and 4 g/l glucose, respectively, while glycine exhibited the strongest ability to enhance 5-ALA production. In addition, P. acidipropionici produced 5-ALA at 80-104 mg/l which was 10 fold higher than that produced by the other species when 12 g/l glycine were added. Furthermore, in the presence 1 g/l levulinic acid and 12 g/l glycine, the production 5-ALA in P. acidipropionici was enhanced to 173.6 mg/l which was 17 fold higher than that produced by the other species.

In addition, crystallographic data exists for only one ATP-competitive inhibitor in both the active cyclin-bound and inactive CDK2 forms. We have solved the structures six inhibitors in both the monomeric CDK2 and binary CDK2/cyclin A complexes and demonstrate for the first time that significant differences in binding CDK2 ligands occur depending on the activation state. The binding mode two ligands varies substantially as a result binding site differences induced upon CDK2 activation. Furthermore, an energetic analysis CDK2/cyclin complexes demonstrates that those differences could be used beneficial in the design new inhibitors. These results confirm that structures solved in complex with the monomeric CDK2 do not fully reflect the active conformation bound inhibitors. This analysis reveals significant implications for inhibitor design towards active structures since these are distinct from the inactive CDK2 and also suggests that the monomeric CDK2 conformation could be selectively inhibited.",

Methods: Subconfluent HTB140 human melanoma cells were treated with FM (100, 250 lM) 24 hour prior to proton irradiation (12 Gy, 16 Gy). Assays were performed 48 hour after irradiation. Cell proliferation was monitored by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, while cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. Variation p53, cyclin A, cyclin B and cyclin E mRNA levels were evaluated by RT-PCR. Results: All analyzed single or combined treatments induced significant inhibition cell proliferation, ranging from 24 to 53%. Level apoptosis increased after treatments with FM, protons or their combination, with apoptotic indexes varying from 1.54 to 6.43. The highest values were obtained for irradiated samples pretreated with 250 lM FM. Flow cytometric analysis showed that 250 lM FM induced G2 phase arrest. Other applied treatments did not affect cell cycle distribution. In samples exposed to proton irradiation pretreated with 250 lM FM, p53 gene expression was up-regulated. Cyclin A was slightly down-regulated in all analyzed samples, while expression cyclin B and cyclin E genes were unaffected. Conclusions: All analyzed treatments reduced cell proliferation.

The aim of our study was to determine whether the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of MCL. To accomplish our goal, we examined the change in gene copy number and the mutation frequency of PI3KCA gene, the phosphorylation status of Akt and the loss of expression of PTEN, in a set of primary MCL samples and MCL cell lines. We found that 14 of 23 (58%) primary MCL cases with amplifiable GAPDH and two of two cell lines harboured a gain (> 3) of PI3KCA gene copy number. PI3KCA gene mutations were not identified. In the immuno-histochemical analyis, 12 of 33 (36%) MCL samples showed high levels of pAkt expression, whereas increased levels of pAkt were shown in the cell lines and in 5 of 14 (36%) frozen MCL samples by immunoblotting. In addition, amplification of PI3KCA correlated with the status of Akt phosphorylation in 7 of 12 (58%) primary MCL cases and the two MCL cell lines. Inhibition of PI3KCA induced increased apoptosis in the MCL cell lines. PTEN protein expression was present in all 14 frozen MCL cases and cell lines, whereas five of 33 (15%) cases tested by immunohistochemistry had loss of PTEN protein expression. In conclusion, we demonstrated that PI3K/Akt pathway is activated in MCL and that PI3KCA gene amplification may contribute to PI3K/Akt oncogenic activation.

Methods: After extraction of genomic DNA, exon 20 of the BRCA1 gene was amplified by flanking specific primers. We developed methodology based on real-time PCR (LightCycler, Roche), and high-resolution melting curve analysis in the presence of LCGreen I dye (HR-1 Melter, Idaho Technology). Our methodology was first optimized and evaluated by using 5382 insC and 5331 G>A positive and wild type genomic DNA samples as verified by DNA sequencing (ABI 310, Applied Biosystems). Sensitivity studies showed that mutated DNA could be reliably detected even at a 10% ratio with wt DNA. Results: Genomic DNA was isolated from 102 FFPE breast tumors, 15 normal breast tissue samples, as well as from 40 peripheral blood samples. The developed method managed to successfully identify one BRCA1 5382 insC and two 5331 A>G mutated samples, that were further verified by DNA sequencing.",

Different neurotoxins block distinct subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Short-chain a-neurotoxins (60-62 a.a., four disulfide bonds) preferentially inhibit muscletype nAChRs, whereas long-chain a-neurotoxins (66-75 a.a., five disulfide bonds) block both muscle-type and a7 homooligomeric neuronal nAChRs. For structural investigations of neurotoxin/receptor interactions the effective production system of neurotoxins is required. In search for such system we concentrated our attention on bacterial expression, as giving highest yield of recombinant proteins and allowing straightforward isotope-labeling. Bacterial expression of disulfide rich proteins like a-neurotoxins is a difficult task. The cytoplasm expression leads to formation of the inclusion bodies. To solve this problem, we developed the system for the secretion of snake neurotoxins as a fusion with the signal peptide of E. coli heat-stable enterotoxin II. After induction with IPTG, toxins (processed during the secretion process) begin to accumulate in periplasm and growth medium. As a result, recombinant neurotoxins with correctly formed disulfide bonds and native N-terminus are obtained. We tried developed system for the production of short-chain neurotoxin II from Naja oxiana venom and its several mutants (including isotope-labelled variants and five disulfide analogue of long-chain neurotoxin). The final yield of purified neurotoxins was up to 20 mg per liter of bacterial culture on minimal medium.

The conversion of fatty acid hydroperoxides to allene epoxides is catalysed by a cytochrome P450 in plants. In contrast, in the coral Plexaura homomalla, a catalase-related hemoprotein fused to the lipoxygenase (LOX) was found to function as an allene oxide synthase (AOS). The aim was to identify the presence of this pathway in the Arctic soft coral Gersemia fruticosa. Methods: G. fruticosa allene oxide synthase-lipoxygenase (AOS-LOX) cDNA was cloned by using homology-based RT-PCR, sequenced and the full-length fusion protein and LOX domain were expressed separately in E. coli. The incubation products were identified by reverse phase-HPLC and mass-spectrometry, the stereochemistry of the LOX product was identified by chiral-phase HPLC.",

Despite this obvious importance, this enzyme remains poorly characterized by a lack of large quantities of purified enzyme. In this study structural features were determined through designing a high yield purification process. CD analyses showed that the protein contains mostly B-strand elements and requires Zn 2+ ions as structural component. Using intrinsic fluorescence analyses to evaluate the effect of different kinds of cations on structural integrity showed that among all the metal ions, Zn 2+ is inhibitory if added exogenously whereas the effects of other salts (NaCl, CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 ) were less pronounced. This effect is probably due to shielding and interaction of some critical areas and structural residues with the excess zinc ions. Under such an environment, the protein finds almost rigid conformation and loses its structure somehow. As 2A pro is a cysteine protease, it requires the presence of a free thiol group as the nucleophile and the inhibitory effect of zinc ions could result from binding of the metal to the cysteine residue in the enzyme active site. The maximum enzyme stability was achieved at 4\u00b0C and pH 7. Turbidity measurements showed that increase of temperature caused a large amount of aggregation which can be the result of a high content of B-structure Measurement of free SH groups using Ellman test showed that both basic and acidic pH oxidizes the protein and induced disulfide bands which decreases the protein stability remarkably.",

Fungal respiration exhibits peculiar features and involves an alternative oxidase pathway not yet fully elucidated. In this sense, we have silenced an aox gene in A. fumigatus (Afaox) by RNA interference. Inverted repeats of Afaox coding sequence were cloned in the pALB1 plasmid, which contain an alb1 gene cloned. In xylose medium, the Afaox/alb1 and alb1 transformants had the same phenotype, a green color, as the wild strain, indicating that the interference was not induced. However, in maltose medium the Afaox/alb1 transformant grew in white color indicating an entire silence and a Real-time PCR revealed a decrease of 95% in RNAm levels. It has been suggested that AOX may be important for fungal survival in macrophages, based on accumulating evidence for its antioxidant defense. ROS production was monitored using fluorescent probe CM-H 2 DCFDA. In Afaox/alb1 transformants, ROS production increased 12.5 and 2-fold when compared with wild-strain and alb1 transformants, respectively, suggesting that AOX can prevent ROS formation. The survival rate of silenced strain in macrophages was measured by MTT assay. Afaox, double silenced strain, revealed a highest survival when compared with the other strains. Conidia were incubated with different ROS donors and conidia viability was measured by flow cytometria with FUN-1 and PI uptakes.

Dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) is a major metabolite of organoarsenic in mammals including human. The acute toxicity of organoarsenic compounds are much lower than that of inorganic arsenicals. We compared the effect of As 2 O 3 and DMA on HeLa cell proliferation. HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and then incubated in As 2 O 3 (10 lM-5 mM) and DMA (700 lM-5 mM) solution at 37\u00b0C for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Cell proliferation was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT). The results showed that 700 lM As 2 O 3 has maximum effect (96.4%toxicity) on HeLa cell at 72 hours. Toxicity remained constant by increasing As 2 O 3 concentration up to 5 mM. Effect of 700 lM DMA on HeLa cell at the same condition showed 22.4% toxicity which means As 2 O 3 has 4.3-fold efficacy over DMA. According to our data, it seems that arsenic trioxide diffused very slowly into the cell membrane upto critical concentration but while entered the cell induced cytotoxicity very fast. On the other hand DMA was able to enter the cell much faster.

Upregulation of MMP-2 induced by phosphatidic acid (PA), the product of PLD, was mediated via protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA), NFjB, and Sp1, but not ERK, p38, or JNK, and enhanced the invasion of glioma cells. PA activated PKC and PKA, and induced nuclear translocation and transactivation of NFjB. PA also increased binding of NFjB and Sp1 to MMP-2 promoter. Mutation of NFjB-or Sp1-binding sites significantly attenuated MMP-2 promoter activity. This is the first report revealing NFjB and Sp1 as essential transcriptional factors linking PLD to MMP-2 upregulation, providing evidence that PLD isozyme contributes to glioma progression by enhancing MMP-2 expression and thus tumor-cell invasion via PKC/PKA/NFB/Sp1-mediated signaling pathways. Phospholipase D (PLD) is essential for cell survival and its activity is required for protection against apoptosis. However, the regulatory mechanism of PLD during apoptosis remains unknown. Here we report that stress stimuli induce caspase-mediated cleavage of PLD1. Cleavage occurs at the DDVD 545 residues, found within the loop region of the polypeptide, generating an N-terminal fragment (NF-PLD1) and a C-terminal fragment of PLD1. During apoptosis, the ectopic expression of the caspase-resistant mutant-PLD1 significantly prevented the loss of enzymatic activity and apoptosis compared to that of wild type PLD1. NF-PLD1 itself caused apoptosis even in the absence of apoptotic stress. The pro-apoptotic effect of NF-PLD1 may be attributable to a dominant-negative action through interaction with endogenous PLD1 and inhibition of its activity. NF-PLD1 suppressed E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 levels and elevated p53-protein stability, and thereby increased the expression of p53 target genes. Furthermore, NF-PLD1-induced apoptosis was dramatically suppressed in p53-deficient cells, suggesting that the pro-apoptotic action of NF-PLD1 is a p53-dependent event. Taken together, our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism based on the caspase-dependent cleavage of PLD1, which contributes to apoptosis via the p53-mediated pathway.",

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible for the establishment of the specific genomic methylation patterns, a putative molecular fingerprint characterizing individual cell types that is formed during cell differentiation. Since de novo DNA methyltransferases, the enzymes that create these patterns, do not posses specific DNA recognition affinity, it is reasonable to assume that these enzymes are tethered to specific genomic regions via their interactions with proteins acting as de novo DNA methylation regulators. To identify these potential regulators, we have inserted cDNAs encoding tagged versions of de novo DNA methyltransferases into the ROSA locus of mouse ES cells. By immunoprecipitation and Mass spectrometry we have identified p68/Ddx5 RNA Helicase as interactions partner of Dnmt3a2 de novo methyltransferase. Ddx5/p68 RNA helicase coimmunoprecipitates with Dnmt3a2 and Thymidine glycosylase (Tdg) an enzyme that is implicated in base-excision DNA repair, from ESCs extracts. We have explored the physiological and functional significance of these interactions. We have found that Ddx5 interacts via multiple domains with Dnmt3a/3a2 in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, Ddx5 represses Dnmt3a2 activity in an ATP dependent manner, in vitro. We provide evidence that Ddx5/p68 forms a complex with the de novo DNA methyltransferase in vivo and regulates Dnmt3a/a2 activity at specific genomic sites.

In this study we purified and analysed the extracellular polysaccharides of Bifidobacterium adolescentis 94 BIM, B. bifidum 791 and B.longum 379 M. Morphological studies of B. adolescentis 94 BIM, B. bifidum 791 and B.longum 379 M strains showed that cells are either long (0.5 \u00b7 8 nm), sometimes branched and have wide ends, or short and coccoid . We observed, using the electron microscopy, the existence of the intercellular links with the aid of different extracellular structures -cell wall evaginations, capsule-like material or microfibrillae, similar to the other strains of this species. Aiming at understanding of the molecular basis for the intercellular links, we have been investigating surface polysaccharides of these strains. Cells grown in various media produced similar polysaccharides with the same sugars, but some differences occurred in their molar ratios. These polysaccharides differs from previously reported polysaccharides of B. adolescentis YIT 4011 and B. adolescentis M101-4. The first one contained glucose and 6-deoxytalose with small amount of glycopeptide and the second one had glucose and galactose as major constituents and a galactofuranose as minor compound. Cell wall polysaccharides composed of glucose and galactose were also found in B. infantis and B. longum.

Griebenow University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras Campus, San Juan, PUERTO RICO Introduction: Subtilisin-like proteases constitute one of the principal structural classes of enzymes belonging to the serine protease family. Members of this enzyme class are directly involved in the development of various diseases (e.g., obesity, diabetes) when their enzymatic activities become deregulated. While at the biochemical level, many of the active-site chemical and structural elements involved in the catalytic mechanism of this class of enzymes are known, the molecular factors responsible for their catalytic regulation are not well understood. Although it has been suggested that the enzyme's intrinsic structural dynamics might be a critical variable involved in regulating the catalytic cycle of these enzymes, the molecular mechanisms by which this phenomena occur remain unknown. Here we investigate whether subtilisin structural dynamics directly influence the kinetics of enzyme catalysis. Methods: Chemical protein glycosylation was employed to sequentially modulate the structural dynamics of subtilisin. We quantified the changes in protein dynamics and thermodynamic stability by measuring amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics and thermal unfolding temperature (T m ). The catalytic behavior (k cat , K M ) of subtilisin after chemical glycosylation was determined from the hydrolysis of the peptide substrate N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe p-nitroanalide. Results: The reduction in subtilisin structural dynamics correlates with the increased thermodynamic stability (T m ) and reduced rate of enzyme catalysis (k cat ) without affecting substrate binding (K M ) after chemical glycosylation.",

T. thermophilus HB8 (DSM Acc No 579) was grown in minimal salt medium (MSM) containing sodium gluconate as carbon source [1] . PHA depolymerase activity was assayed using PHB as substrate [2] . Flagellin was concentrated from cell free supernatant by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. Purification of flagella was performed as described previously [3] . Immunoblots were carried out using flagellin antibody (anti-FliC; Salmonella H antiserum rabbit). During the growth of T. thermophilus in MSM progressive increase of PHB depolymerase and flagellin was obtained. Analysis by SDS-PAGE and western blot of purified flagella revealed a single band of 62 kDa. Two stable flagellin fragments of 51 and 32 kDa were observed after incubation at 100\u00b0C for 20 minutes or after acid pH treatment, respectively. Flagellin was isolated in a complex form with PHB-depolymerase either by precipitation with PHB or by co-immunoprecibitation with protein-A sepharose/anti-FliC. Furthermore, the fragment of 32 kDa was characterized as flagellin by N-terminal and intenal sequence analysis. The extracellular PHB depolymerase of T. thermophilus forms complex with flagellin of the type III export system. These results indicate that T. thermophilus HB8 is a motile bacterium, capable of sensing environmental changes or escaping from adverse conditions.",

Methods: Wistar albino rats were assigned into three groups: (i) Group A: sham, (ii) Group B: hepatic ischemia was formed by clamping on the superior mesenteric arther (SMA) for 1 hour and reperfusion for zero, 2, 24, 48 hours and then subjects were sacrified, and (iii) Group C: pre-conditionary ischemia was obtained by clamping on hepatic pedicules twice for 5 minute and reperfused for 10 minute. Then, the clamping and reperfusion processes that used in Group B were repeated. Liver, intestine and lung malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and lung myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were evaluated.",

The decreased MDA levels were measured in Group B and Group C after 24 hour. These results were also supported by histopathologically. Conclusion: It can be suggested that the pre-conditionary hepatic ischemia may have a protective effects against intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury.",

Perr School of Biosciences, University of Westminster, London, UK Introduction: Tritrichomonas foetus, which causes bovine trichomoniasis, is a parasitic protozoan with worldwide distribution and is particularly rampant in America, Australia and Africa where natural breeding is practised. It is of economic importance because of the substantial financial loss it causes to countries involved in commercial scale beef and milk production. The pathogen has been implicated in feline diarrhoea and research has shown Tritrichomonas foetus and Tritrichomonas suis in swine to be the same organism in different hosts. Tritrichomonas foetus is able to evade the bovine defense mechanism to cause spontaneous abortion and one potential virulence factor is the secretion of hydrolases into the extracellular environment especially glycosidases, DNAses and cysteine proteases. Methods: Chromatographic methods like gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography and chromatofocusing were used for isolation of glycosidases. Concanavalin A chromatography was used to check for glycosylation. Glycosidase activity was determined using the para-nitrophenyl sugar assays.",

This pathway is hyperactivated in cancer with activating mutations in B-RAF occurring in approximately 7% of cancers. It has been identified the V600E B-RAF mutation in about 30-70% of thyroid cancers. In this study we analyze the role of oncogenic B-RAF on the NFjB pathway in thyroid cancer cells, since this transcription factor also plays an important role in carcinogenesis. First of all, we observed that overexpression of B-RAF mutants with different kinase activities increased the NFkB-dependent transcription, with a higher increase in the case of the V600E B-RAF mutant. This increase in NFjB activity was observed in both basal and TNFa-stimulated conditions. However, V600E B-RAF did not increase IjB degradation and p65/NFkB nuclear translocaction. We also found that inhibition of MEK with the specific inhibitor UO126 blocks the NFjB-induced transcription, indicating a role of the MEK/ERK pathway. NFjB can also be activated by increasing the p65/NFjB transactivation potential after phosphorylation of S276 of p65 by the ERK-substrate MSK1. Thus, we observed that overexpression of a kinase-dead mutant of MSK1 blocks the NFjB activity induced by V600E B-RAF. This data indicate that oncogenic B-RAF increases NFjB transcriptional activity without affecting IjB degradation and p65/NFjB nuclear translocation, but increasing the transactivation potential of p65/NFjB through an ERK/MSK1 dependent pathway.",

Knowledge of the normal camel tears components and comparison with humans can have clinical implications for the management of certain ocular surface disorders that effect humans. Objective: To analyze the biochemical contents of the periocular tear film from camels. Methods: The tears were collected from domesticated female camels by sterile capillaries. The spectroscopic characteristics of the tears were analyzed. Osmolarity, protein content and antioxidant in were measured by standard assays. Electrolytes, Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , PO 4 -3 , Fe 3+ , CO 2 , LDH, glucose and cholesterol were measured on the Dimension \u00d2 chemistry system. Results: The camel tears showed UV absorption peaks between 200-290 nm. Some absorption was noted in the UV-B region; however, nearly 100% UV transmittance was observed in the UV-A and visible range. Distinct fluorescence excitation/emission maxima were observed in camel tears and the osmolarity was 318 \u00b1 14.69 mOsmM. The protein concentration was 4.56 \u00b1 2.47 mg/ml, while glutathione ranged from 1.39 to 82.28 nmoles/ml with a mean of 33.30 \u00b1 44.29 nmoles/ ml.

Numerous Abzs discovered afterwards in sera of patients with various autoimmune diseases are capable of hydrolyzing proteins, DNA, RNA, polysaccharides, or nucleotides. On the other hand, some natural catalytic antibodies were prepared by normal immunization using ground-state antigen. We prepared a monoclonal antibody against beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that show a peroxidase-like activity. Methods: The 7D9 MAb analyzed with respect to its specificity for hCG and b-hCG by immunoblot and ELISA. This antibody was purified by sequential chromatography on protein G/A-Sepharose, gel filtration and ion-exchange. The presence of peroxidase activity of 7D9 MAb was confirmed by zymogram and enzyme assay in presence of substrates including, 3,3'-diaminobenzidine(DAB),tetra methylbenzidine (TMB) and L-DOPA. Results: Immunoblot analysis and ELISA showed that this MAb reacts with beta hCG and did not cross-react with other glycoprotein hormones such as FSH, TSH and LH. Our data reveal that this MAb is very unstable and has auto degradation characteristics. Zymogram and spectrophotometer analyses show that 7D9 mAb has oxidase like activity against different substrates such as DAB, TMB and L-Dopa. Conclusions: 7D9 mAb has oxidase-like activity against different substrates such as DAB, TMB and L-Dopa. Antioxidant peroxidase activity of Abzs can also play an important role in the protection of organisms from oxidative stress as well as in oxidation of toxic compounds.",

Together with the five basic tastes, some kinds of compounds, such as proteins, lipids, and polysaccharaides, bring us complicated impressions. Umami is a taste modality for monosodium glutamate (MSG) that was discovered in Laminaria seaweeds. It is generally accepted that glutamate receptors receive MSG in taste reception cells. The goal of this study is to seek the materials that enhance mouse MSG taste response and reveal their interacting modes for the reception of MSG. The oxidized compounds of polyunsaturated fatty acids are used and measured the sensitivity for MSG through behavioral and electrophysiological technique. Licking response of MSG is measured using MSG aversion mouse. Corda tympani nerve, one of the taste nerve, response is also measured. Oxidized compounds of arachidonic acid raised the sensibility for MSG. These results suggest that oxidized compounds might interact with lingual glutamate receptors.

Its primary effect through inhibition of sodium channels in the nerve cell membrane is well known.

However, the mechanisms related to these effects are rather unclear. One plausible explanation for the antibacterial potency might be membrane intercalation.

The commercially available and widely recommended ligand [ 3 H]GBR12935 (K D = 2.0 nM) was compared to the [ 3 H]PE2I (K D = 3.5 nM), which has originally been proposed as DAT tracer for PET analysis, but was also suggested for use in in vitro assay [Stepanov, et al., Appl. Radiat. Isot. 2007; 65: 293]. The kinetic properties of GBR12935 and PE2I in binding to DAT are similar, as are their affinities. Our analysis has revealed that incubation time around 30 minute is sufficient for the conventional equilibrium binding and displacement assays for both ligands, with [ 3 H]GBR12935 revealed 15-20% less of DAT sites due to the faster off-rate. However, the major difference between these ligands also lies in the levels of non-specific binding. We have found that [ 3 H]GBR12935 exhibited unacceptably high level of nonspecific binding to membrane preparation, as well as to GF/B filters, even after optimization of the assay conditions. The non-specific binding was considerably less pronounced in the case [ 3 H]PE2I.",

However, the molecular mechanisms of impaired insulin secretion and signal transduction of glucotoxicity are poorly understood. In this study, we examined protein kinases that correlated with insulin secretion in INS-1 cells using Multi-PK antibodies, which could detect a wide variety of protein kinases. When expression patterns of protein kinases in INS-1 cells under varying glucose concentrations were analyzed by Western blotting with Multi-PK antibodies, a kinase of 63 kDa was significantly reduced concomitant with the decrease of insulin secretion under the glucotoxic condition. To identify 63-kDa kinase, we employed a unique two-dimensional gel electrophoretic technique and MicroRotofor electrophoresis. From the molecular sizes of native kinase/CNBr-fragment and pI value, the 63-kDa protein kinase was predicted to be CaMKIV and it was confirmed by Western blotting analysis with anti-CaMKIV antibody. Decrease in CaMKIV expression under glucotoxic condition was recovered to original level after changing the medium to normal glucose concentration. Recombinant CaM-KIV was degraded in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner by incubation with cell lysates from INS-1 under glucotoxic condition, and degradation was protected by calpain inhibitor III. Transfection of constitutively active CaMKIV in INS-1 cells under glucotoxic condition induced four-fold increase in insulin promoter activity. Furthermore, the expression of CaMKIV was found to be decreased in the pancreatic islets of diabetic OLETF rats, while that of non-diabetic LETO rats was not.

Their mass, N-terminal sequences and functions were characterized. Specific primers for the polymerase chain reactions were designed from known homologies, and the cDNAs encoding these proteins were successfully cloned and sequenced from venom glands. Full amino acid sequences were deduced, which match the Mass data of the purified venom proteins and some of them were confirmed by peptide mass fingerprinting. A very abundant basic PLA in this venom (designated as Mfu-PL-I) is non-neurotoxic but highly lipolytic and lethal with an i.v. LD 50 of 0.18 mg/kg, and causes myoglobinuria (dark urine) in mice. The in vivo effects of Mfu-PLI on mice suggested that it may cause hemolysis and general myotoxicity. Amino acid sequences of many group I venom PLAs eliciting dark urine were aligned and compared with those without such effects; we found Lys69 and Trp 19 or Trp31 are important for the PLA to interact with cell membrane and elicit myotoxicity. Additionally, neurotoxicities of two of the 3FTxs were confirmed by assays on chick biventer-cervicis tissue. Venom NP peptides of 34amino acid residues was also identified and its sequence is 71% identical to the NP from Micrurus corallinus venom. Molecular phylogenetic trees of these venom proteins confirmed that Mfu is a rather unique elapid species.",

Methods: Flow cytometry was used to measure the cellular fluorescence of ethidium monoazide labeled plasmid and green fluorescent protein, which represented the plasmid entry and transgene expression, respectively. We examined the effects of various trehalose concentrations on the enhancements of transfection efficiency as well as the effects of the timing of trehalose treatment and the duration of trehalose treatment on the plasmid entry and transgene expression. Results: We found that incorporating trehalose into the transfection reagent could improve the transgene expression mediated by DNA-PEI complexes. Such enhancements were not observed when other disaccharides were used. In an effort to explore the mechanisms, the treatments with trehalose for 5-120 minute prior to transfection could cause drops in transfection efficiency by 30-50%; such treatments, however, hardly affected the amounts of intracellular plasmid. The transfection efficiency remained almost unchanged when the transfected cells were treated with trehalose after the removal of transfection reagents. Despite the enhanced transgene expression, the presence of trehalose during transfection showed inhibitory effects on the internalization of DNA-PEI complexes.

Because of the summation theorem, a maximal value for GS control coefficient should be around 0.1-0.2. The lack of homogeneous GS has prevented microinjection in oocytes to measure its control coefficient. Instead, we have chosen to modify GS endogenous activity by microinjection of glucose-6-P, a known activator of GS. We report that glucose-6-P effectively raises GS endogenous activity. Experiments were performed microinjecting unlabeled glucose-6-P followed, after 8 minutes, by 3 mM UDP-[U-3 H] glucose. After 12 minutes incubation, glycogen radioactivity was measured. Maximal activation of GS was about 2-to 3-fold at 2 mM microinjected glucose-6-P. The ester effect was transient being maximal between 5 and 10 minutes. Therefore, the control coefficient determination was performed by microinjecting different glucose-6-P concentrations. After 8 minutes of incubation, oocytes received [U-14 C]glucose (6 nmoles). After 12 minutes incubation, glycogen radioactivity was measured. Flux coefficients were calculated and found to be 0.01, i.e. almost zero. We conclude that GS does not control the flux of glycogen synthesis in oocytes. Acknowledgement: Support: FONDECYT 1040886.",

Inulinase has been produced in various microbial sources, among which Aspergillus species are one of the most common choices for commercial applications. In this work, Aspergillus strains were studied for their inulinase production capacity. Methods: The strains were purchased from the Persian Type Culture Collection and grown on inulin (extracted from chicory root and Jersusalem Artichoke) or sucrose as the sole carbon source. Presence of inulin in the extracts was detected by TLC. Inulinase and sucrase activities were determined by measuring the amount of released reducing sugar.

Importantly, CHM-1 is less toxic to normal fibroblasts (NIH3T3) cell. The effect of CHM-1 on cell cycle progression was examined by flow cytometry. CHM-1 caused a time-dependent accumulation of MCF-7 cells in the G2-M phase. Moreover, CHM-1 interacted with tubulin, markedly inhibited tubulin polymerization, and disrupted microtubule organization. In contrast, colchicine caused cellular microtubule depolymerization with short microtubule fragments in the cytoplasm, paclitaxel resulted in microtubule polymerization with an increase in the density of cellular microtubules. However, the biologic and physiologic significance for the anticancer effects of CHM-1 is not clear. Identification of new proteins binding with CHM-1 should help in the design of new strategies to prevent cancer. We used the MCF-7 cell line to identify novel proteins that bind with CHM-1. Proteins from MCF-7 cell lysates were subjected to affinity chromatography using CHM-1-Sepharose 4B. Fractions containing proteins binding with CHM-1 were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF to identify proteins that directly bind with CHM-1. Our preliminary results indicated that CHM-1 binds with the eIF4a and GRP78. Finally, we carried out xenografts with MCF-7 cells in athymic SCID mice.

As a result, most patients ultimately experience disease recurrence or progression during or after therapy. We have suggested that to overcome the tamoxifen drawbacks and to enhance its anticancer activity, iron-containing derivatives of this compound could be used. Numerous tumour cell strains produce large amounts of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Ferrocene and other iron-containing compounds readily react with hydrogen peroxide producing free hydroxyl radicals. These radicals cause damage to DNA which, in turn, triggers the pathways leading to elimination of cancer cell via apoptosis. We used tamoxifen as a carrier for delivery of ferrocene to breast cancer cells, and synthesized a conjugate of ferrocene and tamoxifen (Tam-Fer). We have shown that the frequency of apoptotic events in MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with Tam-Fer is significantly higher than in the control cells treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen or ferrocene, and this increase well correlates with the increase in generation of free radicals in these cells. These results show that the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in tumor cells can be used as a therapeutic advantage for treating cancer.

In the present study, after removal of DNA and RNA molecules, total Tetrahymena's protein extracts were separated by twodimensional gel electrophoresis and analyzed by MALDI-MS and MALDI-MS-MS.

The apparent K m and V max for the activity on pullulan were 0.48 mg/ml and 0.044 mmol/minute and for soluble starch were 5 mg/ml and 0.08 mmol/minute, respectively.

An accelerated anabolism of fluoropyrimidines (FP) to the active forms due to induction of enzymes involved in their metabolism in irradiated cells might cause this effect. To verify this assumption, we measured the expression of enzymes involved in FP metabolism thymidine phosphorylase (TP), thymidine synthase (TS), thymidine kinase (TK) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) in HeLa cells after a single dose of 200 cGy in vitro. We used real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis to quantify the levels of mRNA and protein at several time intervals after irradiation (from 10 min. up to 120 h). Although a trend towards increased level of TP and TS was detected 6 h after irradiation, only a slight but insignificant change at protein levels was found.

Gehring McGill University, Montre\u00b4al, QC, CANADA Introduction: Ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains are found in a variety of proteins involved in ubiquitination processes. The threedimensional structure of a UBA domain consists of a bundle of three a-helices, which contain surface patches of hydrophobic residues binding ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains. The previously determined structures show that the first loop and the C-terminal part of helix a3 of the UBA domain bind to the b-sheet of ubiquitin. Despite the existing structural information, there is insufficient understanding of ubiquitin recognition for a number of UBA domains.Methods: We performed X-ray crystallography, NMR and mutational analysis of the UBA domains of Cbl-b and Swa2p. We applied isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance to quantify the affinity of these domains towards ubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains. Results: Here, we report the crystal structure of the UBA domain of Cbl-b in complex with ubiquitin at 1.9 \u00c5 resolution. Unlike previous structures, the first helix of the Cbl-b UBA domain is positioned parallel to the central strand b5 of ubiquitin and occupies the hydrophobic surface of ubiquitin. The UBA/ubiquitin interface was confirmed using NMR titrations and site-directed mutagenesis. NMR studies showed that the UBA domain from Swa2p binds ubiquitin similarly. Conclusions: The Cbl-b and Swa2p UBA domains display a novel mode of ubiquitin recognition by a UBA domain with unexpected similarity to ubiquitin-interacting motifs. In particular, the position and angle of the helix 1 of Cbl-b UBA is strikingly similar to that of the IUIM domain of Rabex-5 bound to ubiquitin.",

Natural polyanions like DNA, heparins and adenosine derivatives which have important intra-and extracellular roles, are able to influence the progress of amyloid formation in proteins. These could be of importance in some particular disease states like diabetes, inflammation or necrosis. Methods: Far-Circular Dichroism, ThT fluorescence, Congo red absorbance and TEM. Results: We examined amyloid formation of HEWL in the presence of AMP, ADP, ASP, ATP, NAD, and NADP, but only in the presence of ATP, the rate of amyloid formation of HEWL increased dramatically. The other additives had neither increasing nor decreasing effect in this regard. TEM studies showed that fibrils that were formed in the presence of ATP over a period of 48 hours were unusually very thick. Conclusions: The unusual behavior of HEWL in the presence of ATP may be caused by a strengthening of the electrostatic interactions in the active site (previously shown to be a putative interaction site for indole compounds), or the existence of some specific site in HEWL for ATP which can increase the tendency of protein for fibril formation.

Mutations in human SCO2 gene (E140K, S225F) have been found to be responsible for fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency, since they alter the physical conformation state of mature mitochondrial Sco2 protein and its ability to bind copper. Unfortunately, there is no effective therapy of such disorders. PTD-Technology, however, has the potential to treat metabolic disorders via protein therapy due to the ability of short amino acid sequences [named: Protein Transduction Domains (PTDs)] to facilitate transduction of proteins into mammalian cells.Methods: We have PCR-cloned, expressed the full length human Sco2 cDNA and produced recombinant L-Sco2 as fusion protein, bearing the HIV-1 TAT-derived PTD and other tags. Isolated inclusion bodies, containing the 10xHis-Xa SITE -TAT-L-Sco2-HA fusion protein, were solubilised in 1 M L-Arginine solution and incubated with cultured human U-87 MG (glioblastoma) and T24 (kidney epithelial) cells. Cytosol and mitochondria were prepared from transduced cultured cells and the transduced human recombinant 10xHis-Xa SITE -TAT-L-Sco2-HA fusion protein was detected by Western Immunostaining. Results: These experiments indicated that the fusion 10xHis-Xa SITE -TAT-L-Sco2-HA protein is transduced into mitochondria of both U87-GM and T24 cells through a time-and concentration-dependent process. Work on progress is expected to demonstrate whether this transduction could be able to resume the functional properties of mitochondria, including recovery of COX activity in SCO2 deficient cells. Conclusion: The transduction of recombinant Sco2 protein in mitochondria provides a model system for targeted delivery of proteins to treat mitochondrial disorders using PTD-Technology.

At least six forms of SCA are caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats (CAG) in the coding region of the relevant disease genes.

PP3C-42 Investigation of human free kappa light chains thiolation process J. Tisonczyk, D. Haznar and R. Drozdz Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, POLAND Introduction: Immunoglobulin free light chains (FC) are products of B lymphocytes. During malignant B lymphocytes proliferation monoclonal FC may be excreted from B cells in high quantities. Passing rapidly through glomerular membrane of the kidney FC cumulate in urine as a Bence Jones protein. FC may also form deposits in many organs. Well organized fibrillar deposits of LC are responsible for the symptoms of al amyloidosis. Amorphous structure of LC deposits in kidney are characteristic for light chain deposition disease (LCDD).Post-translational modification of FC impact on their behavior and properties. As detailed mechanism of tissue protein deposits formation is not known intensive searches for markers of protein structural instability are performed. Methods: We analyzed 175 urine samples of patients with monoclonal gammapathy. Molecular forms of kappa light chains were analyzed by SDS electrophoresis, and native light chains were separated on high resolution agarose gels, and size exclusion HPLC. Thiols content was assayed by HPLC. Results: Lambda light chain are present mainly as 44 kDa covalent dimers linked by C-terminal cysteine. Contrary kappa FC molecules that are thiolated and linked with cysteine or another thiol are present in monomeric form. Process of thiolation of kappa light chain may change isoelectric point of FC molecule. Level of the thiolation of kappa FC varies between individuals in very wide range.",

Currently, only little is known about the ability of fluorescent compounds to detect tau inclusions in brain. Here we show that (trans, trans)-1-fluoro-2,5-bis(3-hydroxycarbonyl-4-hydroxy)styrylbenzene (FSB), a fluorescent Congo red derivative, labels tau inclusions in tissue sections from a mouse line transgenic for human P301S tau and in cases of familial frontotemporal dementia and sporadic Pick's disease. Labelling by FSB required the presence of tau filaments. More importantly, tau inclusions in the spinal cord of human P301S tau transgenic mice were labelled following a single intravenous injection of FSB. These findings indicate that FSB can be used to detect filamentous tau in vivo. PP3C-46 Accumulation of HSP25 and HSP70 partially protects LLC-PK1 cells against the nephrotoxic drug acetaminophen M.

Fractionation of neuronal AP-3 deficient mouse brains revealed decreased levels of select cargoes in synaptic vesicle fractions, while ubiquitous AP-3 and BLOC1 deficiencies result in a concomitant increase of similar cargo. Furthermore, ubiquitous AP-3 siRNA depletion results in increased synaptic vesicle AP-3 cargo half-life and surface expression. Consistent with the regulation of synaptic vesicle content by lysosomal sorting machinery, ubiquitous AP-3 and BLOC-1 deficient mice exhibit altered motor coordination. Conclusions: Thus, synaptic vesicle cargo competition between the lysosomal sorting machinery, ubiquitous AP-3 and BLOC-1, and neuronal AP-3 synaptic vesicle biogenesis machinery regulates synaptic vesicle protein content.

This effect is mediated by its interaction with the C-terminal domain of PhosolipaseD1 (known as D4) and impairment of phospholipase downstream signalling.Methods: PED/PEA-15 and D4 were expressed in E. coli. SPR and ELISA-like assays, combined with an approach of PED/PEA-15 tryptic fragmentation and subsequent HPLC fractionation, were used to set up different competition assays to identify a D4-PED/PEA-15 antagonist. The antagonist was delivered into PED/PEA-15-overexpressing L6 skeletal muscle cells (L6 PED/PEA-15 ) cells and its effects on PLD1 signalling were evaluated. Results: PED/PEA-15 bound D4 in vitro with a K D 0.4 lM. The N-terminal 1-24 region of PED/PEA-15 was identified as a competitor for this interaction. When delivered into L6 PED/PEA-15 cells, the peptide abrogated PLD1-PED/PEA-15 interaction, reducing PKC-a activity to L6 basal levels and restoring insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by about 70%. Conclusions: Impairing the PED/PEA-15/PLD1 interaction restores insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle cells suggesting PED/PEA-15 as an important target for type 2 diabetes.

Orzechowski Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Warsaw, POLAND Introduction: The regulation of starch degradation in potato is weakly understood and differs from that of kernel germination.Although it has been demonstrated that a number of enzymes take part in the process of starch degradation, pathways regulating their activities are still not recognized. Starch phosphorylation is one of the most important factors affecting rate of starch decomposition in potato. There are at least two enzymes involved in starch phosphorylation process. Their main function is the phosphorylation of glucose residues in the chains of amylase and amylopectin. Present findings indicate that starch phosphorylation stimulates activity of amylases, but our knowledge in what way is still lacking. Methods: The aim of our analysis was to investigate the effect of phosphorylation on the intermolecular energies (kJ/mol) for stabilization of the complexes between the set of 6 different sugar ligands and S. tuberosum beta-amylase model based on the template of PDB structure 1Q6C and 1BFN. For performing protein-ligand docking procedures and calculating the binding energies, we applied the DOCK6 program suite and Glide 4.5 software. Results and Conclusions: We have observed a simultaneous effect of chain elongation, phosphorylation and chain branching. Results of flexible ligand docking show that the phosphorylation as well as the chain elongation increases the stabilization of the ligand-protein complex, but this tendency slows down for longer ligands and reverses for branched ones.",

Janska Department of Biotechnology, University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, POLANDIntroduction: FtsH proteases and prohibitins are highly conserved proteins located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. It has been shown that yeast's m-AAA proteases and prohibitins form two independent 1 MDa complexes. These complexes interact with each other and form a 2 MDa supercomplex, which is supposed to be a part of a quality control of the respiratory chain complexes. Results: Arabidopsis possess two homologs of mitochondrial m-AAA proteases: FtsH3 and FtsH10. Expression of the FtsH3 in leaves is about 5 times higher in compare with the FtsH10. Level of the FtsH10 protein in ftsh3 mutant is highly increased and compensates the lack of the FtsH3 protein. This compensation occurs on posttranscriptional level, because the level of the FtsH10 transcript is not affected. Arabidopsis possess 5 active genes encoding prohibitins, which protein products from two high-molecular complexes with estimated masses of 1-1.5 and 2 MDa, respectively. FtsH3/10 proteases are present exclusively in one 2 MDa complex located in the mitochondria. Co-immunoprecititation experiments and 2D BN-PAGE analysis indicate close interactions between prohibitins and FtsH10 protease suggesting that the 2 MDa complex is a supercomplex composed of these two proteins. Conclusions: Presented results indicate that: (i) FtsH3 directly or indirectly controls the level of FtsH10 protein, (ii) prohibitins and m-AAA proteases form stable 2 MDa supercomplex present in the inner membrane of plant mitochondria, the excess of prohibitins being present in the 1-1.5 complex, (iii) interaction of m-AAA proteases and prohibitins is evolutionally conserved between yeasts and plants.",

Tzanakakis Medical School, Department of Histology, University of Crete, Heraklion, GREECEIntroduction: Basic-fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) is the major growth factor expressed by melanoma cells which regulates many cellular events including focal adhesion. Syndecans are membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) which have an important role in focal adhesion through their ability to interact with the extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin. We studied the effect of b-FGF on M5 human melanoma cells' syndecan expression as well as the adhesion on to fibronectin. Methods: After treating M5 cells with b-FGF (10 ng/ml) for 48 hours their syndecan 1 and 4 protein levels and gene expression were analyzed by Western blotting and Real-Time PCR respectively. M5 cells pretreated or not with b-FGF or treated with heparin (1, 10, 30 lg/ml) were detached with PBS/EDTA 5 mM or trypsin and seeded on to 96 well plates-coated with fibronectin (5 lg/cm 2 ). The number of adherent cells was determined by the fluorometric CyQUANT kit. Results: Real-Time PCR and western-blotting analysis showed that b-FGF treatment significantly decreased syndecan 1 and 4 expression (1.6-4.7 and 1.3-to 3.7-fold respectively). Cells detached with PBS/ EDTA showed quicker attachment (30 min) as compared to the cells detached with trypsin (3 hours). Importantly, b-FGF induced a 2-fold decrease in the number of cells adhered on to fibronectin, whereas treatment with heparin induced a 1.6-fold increase at the highest dose. Conclusions: These results indicate that b-FGF may mediate cell adhesion on to fibronectin by modulating the level of syndecan expression known to be involved in the cell and extracellular matrix interactions.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in patients with MM. Methods: In this study, we include serum and bone marrow samples from 14 patients with MM. As controls we used respective samples from 10 healthy volunteers. The production of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was evaluated by gelatin zymography and Western blot analysis. The levels of MMPs were assessed measuring the intensity of the bands and image analysis. Results: The presence of inactive MMP-2 and MMP-9 was detected in serum and bone marrow samples from healthy donors and patients with MM. Significant decrease only in the inactive form of MMP-9 was detected in serum patients with MM compared with healthy donors. In contrast, the activity of both inactive and active MMP-2 and MMP-9 was significantly increased in the bone marrow samples in patients with MM. Conclusions: Serum gelatinases could not be suggested as a marker for the progress of MM. Although measuring the levels of gelatinases in bone marrow, where the disease is localized, can provide significant data regarding the progress of MM.

PP4B-4 Molecular size hyaluronan differently modulates toll-like receptor-4 in LPS-induced cytokine production in mouse chondrocytes G. M. Campo, A. Avenoso, S. Campo, A. D'Ascola, G. Nastasi and A. Calatroni Department of Biochemical, Physiological and Nutritional Sciences, Section of Medical Chemistry, School of Medicine, University of Messina, Messina, ITALYIntroduction: Hyaluronan (HA) action depends upon its molecular size. Low molecular weight HA elicits pro-inflammatory responses by modulating the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) or by activating the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB). High molecular weight HA, instead, shows anti-inflammatory effect by CD receptors and by inhibiting NF-kB activation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -mediated activation of TLR-4 complex induces the myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88) and the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), with final liberation of NF-kB/Rel family members. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of HA at different MW (low, medium, high) on TLR-4 modulation in LPSinduced inflammation in mouse chondrocyte cultures. Methods: mRNA and related protein levels were measured for TLR-4, MyD88, and TRAF6 in chondrocytes, untreated or LPS treated, with and without the addition of HA(two doses for MW). NF-kB activation, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression were also evaluated. Results: LPS increased all studied parameters and NF-kB activation. Low MW HA up-regulated TLR-4 expression, increased MyD88 and TRAF6, and the inflammatory activity in untreated chondrocytes, while enhanced LPS effect in LPS-treated cells. Medium and high MW HA exerted no activity in untreated cells and only the latter reduced LPS effects. Specific TLR-4 blocking antibody was utilised to confirm data. Conclusions: These data suggest that the regulatory effect exerted by HA at any MW on NF-kB activation may depend upon the interaction between HA and TLR-4 and thereby HA may modulate inflammation by its different state of aggregation. Significant increases in plasma Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) levels, with respect to normal controls, were observed in patients with different types of diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and liver diseases. Plasma GAGs are mainly Chondroitinsulphates (CS), and a role of CS in modulating inflammatory responses might exist. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of GAGs purified from normal human plasma in reducing inflammation in a model of LPS-induced increase in proinflammatory cytokines in mouse articular chondrocyte cultures. Methods: Chondrocytes, without and with addition of human plasma GAGs (at threee different doses), were stimulated with LPS (50 lg/ml) for 24 hours, and increases of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma gene expression and their related protein levels were mesured, as well as NF-kB activation, IkB alpha phosphorylation and apoptosis, evaluated by the increase in caspase-3 expression and its related protein amount. LPS treatment generated also high concentrations of the detrimental oxidant species NO evaluated in terms of nitrites, and its inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression. Results: Added purified human plasma GAGs, mainly composed of C-4-S, at the three different doses, reduced inflammatory cytokines production by chondrocytes at both mRNA and protein levels, blocked NF-kB activation and cytoplasmatic IkBalpha phosphorylation, limited cell death by inhibiting apoptosis, and finally reduced the NO concentration.",

Serglycin is highly expressed and constitutively secreted in multiple myeloma cell lines and endothelial cells. Secretion of serglycin may play a biological role in regulating the stability and activity of secreted proteases and other enzymes. Methods: Various cell lines of lung, breast, colon cancer and glioma were cultured. The expression of serglycin gene was detected by RT-PCR and products were identified by sequencing analysis. Core proteins of serglycin were also identified in cell extracts and culture medium by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. Localization of serglycin in malignant tissues was shown by immunohistochemistry analysis. Results: Human serglycin gene is transcribed in a mature mRNA of 1270 bp. Detection of transcriptional products in several cell lines also revealed the presence of an alternatively spliced transcript missing exon2, correlating with data from normal neutrophils. Core proteins varying in molecular weight were detected in several cell extracts and culture medium. The presence of serum induces the expression of serglycin in various cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression of serglycin by cancer cells and its accumulation in malignant tissues. Conclusions: Serglycin proteoglycan is expressed by various cancer cell lines and is present in malignant tissues, indicating its participation in the development of malignancies. Aging, Institute of Biology, N.C.S.R 'Demokritos', Athens, GREECE Introduction: In vitro and in vivo data have shown that genistein can act both as an estrogen and an antiproliferative agent. Our group has shown that genistein affects the synthesis of the key matrix macromolecules glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans and metalloproteinases by human malignant mesothelioma and breast cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to examine whether genistein affects the expression of the ERs and ECM macromolecules, including proteoglycans and metalloproteinases and how ERa mediates the effect of genistein on ECM macromolecules in breast cancer cells. Methods: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were used. Expression of ERs/PGs/MMPs was examined by RT-PCR and western blotting. The importance of ERa on the effect of genistein was studied using siRNA and Real-Time PCR. Results: The effect of genistein on ERa expression was suppressive for 35 lM and inhibitory for 100 lM, while in both concentrations it suppressed the expression of ERb. Real-Time PCR analysis for ERa-suppressed MCF-7 cells showed that ERa mediates the effect of genistein (100 lM) on syndecan-2 expression, while is not related with the effect of genistein on syndecan-4 expression. It is also related with the effect of genistein (35 lM) on MMP-9 and TIMP-1 expression. Conclusion: The obtained results indicate that genistein may be of great value in prevention of breast cancer cells growth and metastasis, since represents both a transcriptional modulator of genes involved in this pathogenetic process and a suppressor of breast cancer cell invasiveness.

In this study we focused on low power far-red and near-infrared laser and tea flavonoid epigallocatechine gallate effects on human T cells viability, proliferation and mitochondrial reticulum state. Methods: Human T cells were cultured in standard conditions, in presence/absence of various concentrations of epigallocatechine gallate. Semiconductor lasers with emission wavelengths/nominal powers of 680 nm/25 mW, and of 830 nm/50 mW, respectively, were used to expose cells to doses and irradiation regimes of therapeutical significance. Using appropriate molecular reporters, changes occurring in cells mitochondrial network, viability and cell cycle progression were followed up fluorescence/confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Results: Epigallocatechine gallate alone induced changes in human T cells viability, proliferation and mitochondrial reticulum properties in a dose and exposure time dependent manner. Low level far-red and nearinfrared laser radiation induced wavelength, dose, and irradiation regime dependent changes in the same parameters. Depending on cells state, different laser irradiation doses/regimes could mitigate/reverse/ enhance the epigallocatechine gallate effects.Conclusion: The obtained data demonstrate significant soft laser and flavonoid effects, and photobiomodulation of flavonoid effects in human T cells.

Van Veldhoven 1 1 Laboratory of Lipid Biochemistry and Protein Interactions, Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Leuven, BELGIUM, 2 Laboratory of Cell Metabolism, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Leuven, BELGIUMPolyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g. arachidonic acid) can be omega-oxidized to dicarboxylic polyunsaturated fatty acids (DC-PUFA), bioactive compounds which cause vasodilatation and activation of PPARalpha and gamma. DC-PUFA can be shortened by beta-oxidation, and to determine whether mitochondria and/or peroxisomes are responsible for this degradation 20-carboxy-[1-14 C]-eicosatetraenoic acid (20-COOH-AA) was synthesized and given to hepatocytes from mouse models with peroxisomal dysfunctions. In contrast to wild type cells, hepatocytes from mice with liver-selective elimination of peroxisomes, due to Pex5p deficiency, failed to produce 14 CO 2 and labeled acid soluble oxidation products, indicating that peroxisomes are involved in the degradation of 20-COOH-AA. Subsequently, the oxidation of 20-COOH-AA was analyzed in hepatocytes lacking multifunctional protein 1 (MFP1) or MFP2, key enzymes of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Beta-oxidation of 20-COOH-AA was partially impaired in MFP1, but not in MFP2 knockout hepatocytes. Taken together, peroxisomes and not mitochondria are the site of degradation of DC-PUFA, and MFP1 is involved in this process. Peroxisome deficiency in men and mice causes structural and functional anomalies of the mitochondrial inner membrane. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms, we examined the physicochemical properties of the aberrant mitochondria and the origins of mitochondrial proliferation by gene expression analysis in mice with selective absence of peroxisomes from hepatocytes (L-Pex5 knockout mice). Methods and Results: Blue native electrophoresis on isolated mitochondria revealed that the levels of complex I were severely reduced, those of complex III and V to a lesser extent, whereas complex II and IV were unaffected. The crude mitochondrial fractions were subjected to Percoll gradient centrifugation. Glutamate dehydrogenase activity measurements revealed a strong induction of this enzyme, pointing to mitochondrial proliferation and a shift of mitochondria to lower density fractions in the knockout mice. Mitochondrial membrane fluidity and permeability were increased but only minor changes in lipid composition were detected. Quantitative PCR experiments showed dysregulation of several genes encoding nuclear receptors, co-activators, subunits of mitochondrial complexes and hepatic transporters and enzymes. Conclusion: The absence of peroxisomes from mouse hepatocytes has profound effects on mitochondrial respiratory complexes, biogenesis and metabolism.PP4C-10Oxidative folding of small TIMS is mediated by site-specific docking onto Mia40 in the mitochondrial intermembrane spaceD.

The key player in this process is actin cytoskeleton supervised by a vast variety of actin binding proteins including cofilin.

Three different cancer models and their selected variants were examined. There were: human colon adenocarcinoma cells LS180, human melanoma cells A375 and rat hepatoma Morris cells 5123. We have focused on their invasive potential, morphology, actin polymerization level, distribution and the level of beta actin and cofilin expression. To assign the invasive factor of cells we used Transwell invasion assay on Matrigel coated filters. Quantitative densitometric analysis and confocal fluorescence microscopy were used to examine the expression levels and subcellular distribution of beta actin and cofilin. To measure the level of actin polymerization we conducted experiments based on a standard Dna-se I inhibition assays. Our data show remarkable differences between parental and selected cancer cells especially in the level of actin polymerization -higher in invasive cells, the level of cofilin and inactive phosphorylated form of cofilin. In more motile cells cofilin and beta actin were accumulated at their cellular periphery in co-localization with actin filaments. Summarizing, our data demonstrate a clear correlation between the metastatic potential of cells and the changes in organization of actin cytoskeleton triggered by cofilin.PP4D-16 Functional properties of integrin linked kinase in Drosophila E.

Here we report the inhibition of LPA-mediated ovarian cancer cell (OVCAR3) migration by o-GlcNAcylation. We found that ezrin, a membrane-cytoskeletal crosslinkers in actin-rich cell surface structures, was o-GlcNAcylated in hyperglycemic condition. Such a modification of ezrin by o-GlcNAc was inversely correlated with phosphorylation level of ezrin. Moreover LPA-induced cell migration was impaired by accumulation of o-GlcNAcylation by PUGNAc treatment. Taken together, our findings suggest that o-GlcNAcylation is an important signaling element in OVCAR3 cells that modulates the activation of ezrin involved in the regulation of cellular movement.",

Chiloeches University of Alcala de Henares, Madrid, SPAINThe classic Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal pathway is known to mediate cellular proliferation in various cell types. Activating mutations of B-RAF protein are identified in approximately 35-65% of human papillary thyroid tumors (PTCs). B-RAF mutations are associated with poor prognosis and thyroid-targeted expression of mutated B-RAF induces development of invasive thyroid cancer, as well as shows an increased level of EMT-associated genes. This indicates that B-RAF contributes to the aggressive behaviour of B-RAF-positive PTCs. The aim of this work is to study the role of V600E B-RAF mutation on cell adhesion and migration in PTC cells carrying this point mutation, as well as the signal transduction pathways involved in these processes. We observed that abrogation of B-RAF expression with siRNA increases adhesion to a fibronectin or collagen I matrix, and decreases migration through them. On the other hand, fibronectin adhesion increases Y347 phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as well as AKT phosphorylation, one of its known downstream effectors. The treatment of cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocks fibronectin adhesion-induced AKT phosphorylation. Regarding the role of B-RAF on this pathway, knocking-down B-RAF expression decreases both FAK and AKT phosphorylation after adhesion to fibronectin. These data indicate that V600E B-RAF plays an essential role in the adhesion and migration of PTC cells through modulation of FAK activation, which result in the formation or stabilization of focal adhesion contacts after adhesion to fibronectin.PP4E-2Monocyte functional responsiveness following PSGL-1 mediated platelet adhesion is dependent upon platelet activation statusS.

Recent studies consider several tumor associated antigens (TAA) like CEA, HER-2, mucins MUC-1, Tn and sialyl-Tn or the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as potential immunotherapeutical targets because they play an important role in releasing tumor cells from the primary tumors, in invasion processes and angiogenesis. TAA under study might be involved in new cellular interactions, changes in adhesivity and cellular mobility. The present study focuses on evaluation of expression and functional roles of CEA, mucins and VEGF expression associated to breast and ovarian tumor cells. Levels of TAA membrane expression associated to tumor cell lines were evaluated by flow cytometry. In addition we have further studied the cytotoxic capacity of specific anti-TAA mAbs in killing breast and ovarian cells from stabilized cell lines or isolated from animal induced tumors by performind by XTT assays.

Chen 1,2 , S. -P. Liao 1 and M. -C. Chou 1 1 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, TAIWAN, 2 Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, TAIWAN Introduction: Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a kind of mediator containing lipids and contributes to regulate the inflammatory response. During the development of atherosclerotic lesions, it is characterized by the presence of large amounts of immune competent cells including T-cells and dendritic cells. In the microenvironment of atherogenesis, monocytes exit blood and enter tissues, where they can cross the endothelium and differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells (DC) under the stimulation of oxLDL.Methods: Since dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent professional antigen-presenting cells, we will focus on analyzing the role of oxLDL stimulation on monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Results: OxLDL can trigger the expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD86, HLA-DQ, and CD40 and get involved in the stimulation of allogeneic T cells by dendritic cells. We further dissect the mechanism of the interaction of dendritic cells with cerebral endothelial cells under oxLDL stimulation. Second, we investigate whether important adhesion molecules on dendritic cell are regulated by oxLDL stimulation, and identify the significance of adhesion molecules in the functional interaction of dendritic cells with cerebral endothelial cells. Conclusions: In vitro experiment has revealed the ability of oxLDL to enhance DC clustering, correlating with the observation that DCs accumulate in the early stage of atherosclerotic lesion development.",

Ivanova 1 , U. Repnik 1 , L. Banks 2 , V. Turk 1 and B. Turk 1 1 Department of Biochemistry, Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, SLOVENIA, 2 International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, ITALY MAGI-1 is a membrane associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) present at the adherent and tight junctions, where it acts as a structural and signalling scaffold. Recently, we have reported MAGI-1 as a caspase target during FasL-, STS-and UV-induced apoptosis in different cell models(1). Cleavage of MAGI-1 at Asp761 between the second and the third PDZ domains by caspases was found to be an important step in proper, fast and efficient cell detachment during apoptosis, since the dominant negative mutant of MAGI-1 delayed cell detachment, but not the other signs of apoptosis, i.e. nuclear fragmentation and PS exposure (1). Since Laura et al.(2)  showed that the C-terminal part of MAGI-1 starting with the fifth PDZ domain resides in the nucleus, whereas the whole region containing PDZ domains 1, 2, 3 and 5 was found to be necessary for targeting MAGI-1 to the tight junctions, we further investigated the cellular distribution and possible proapototic role of MAGI-1 caspase cleavage products. Full length MAGI-1 exhibited submembrane localization, while the N-terminal caspase cleavage product of MAGI-1 is translocated to the cytosol and the C-terminal caspase cleavage product accumulated in the nucleus. When overexpressed, both N-and C-terminal MAGI-1 caspase cleavage products in MDCK cells exhibited minor proapoptotic activity, although their role in apoptosis is probably more passive (3).References: 1.

Thus it has been an interest in the production of soluble stable forms of this membrane protein for their potential use in immune therapies. Methods: DNA fragment coding for the extracellular part of CD69 has been amplified by PCR, and transferred to bacterial expression vectors. The proteins were refolded, and purified by chromatography on S-Sepharose and gel filtration. Results: Soluble CD69 receptors are biochemically very stable, the most stable is the noncovalent dimeric form starting with glycine 70 . The therapeutic potential of these proteins has been proved in mouse melanoma models, where an injection of the soluble CD69 significantly reduced the size of tumors, and prolonged the survival of animals. Conclusion: Stable CD69 receptors proved to be efficient in animal tumor therapies.

The aim of the present investigation was to study the effects of mechanical strain on the orthopedic biomaterial Ti-6Al-4V -osteoblast interface, using an in vitro model. Methods: Homogeneous strain was applied to human bone marrow derived osteoblasts (HBMDOs) cultured on Ti-6Al-4V, at physiological levels, by a mechanostimulatory system, based on the principle of fourpoint bending. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (sqRT-PCR) was used to determine the mRNA expression of Cbfa1 and osteocalcin at different loading conditions. The release of growth factors as a response to stretch was also investigated by transferring stretch-conditioned media to non-stretched cells and by measuring their effect on the regulation of DNA synthesis. Results: Mechanical loading was found that contributes to the regulation of osteoblast differentiation by influencing the level of the osteoblast-specific transcription factor Cbfa1, both at the mRNA and protein level, and also the level of osteocalcin. Both genes were differentially expressed shortly after the application of different mechanical stimuli, in terms of strain frequency, magnitude and time interval. Media conditioned from mechanically-stressed HBMDOs stimulate DNA synthesis more intensely compared to media conditioned from unstressed control cultures, indicating that mechanical strain induces the release of a mitogenic potential that regulates cell proliferation.Conclusions: In conclusion, mechanical loading of HBMDOs growing on Ti-6Al-4V implant surface contributes to the regulation of osteoblast differentiation by influencing the level of bone-related genes (osteocalcin) and transcription factors (Cbfa1). Moreover, mechanical strain induces the release of growth factors that induce DNA synthesis.

Malignant tumors have the ability to invade normal tissue and spread to distant sites, giving rise to metastases, the major factors in the morbidity and mortality of cancer. During invasion and metastasis of tumor, the majority of connective tissue destruction is carried out by the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are divided into five groups namely, collagenases, stromelysins, gelatinases, membrane-dependent MMPs, and others. It is well known that Helicobacter pylori infection is correlated with gastric carcinogenesis. of the two gelatinases MMP-9 has been shown to be upregulated because of H. Pylori infection whereas MMP-2 was poorly affected gastric tumor biopsies. In this study, we investigated the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 genes which belong to the gelatinase group of MMPs. We studied 27 gastric tumor biopsy samples of which 60% are infected with H. pylori. The expression levels of genes were investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Both MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression was determined in 17 of 27 gastric tumor biopsies (63%). Ten out of 17 tumor samples that were MMP-9 positive (59%) and 8 out of 17 tumor samples that were MMP-2 positive (47) were also H. pylori infected. These results show that H. pylori infection is correlated with both MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression in gastric tumors.",

Animals received AMPA (42 nmol) alone or in combination with SRIF (10-5,10-4 M) or the SRIF receptor (sst) selective ligands BIM23014 (sst2/5,10-5,10-4 M), L-779,976 (sst2, 10-6,10-5,10-4 M), L-797,591 (sst1,10-4 M) and L-803,087 (sst4, 10-4M). Retinal cell loss and protection was assessed with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and TUNEL staining. IHC/western blot analysis and radioimmunoassay assessed the viability of sst2A receptors and tissue levels of SRIF, respectively, in control and AMPA treated tissue. Results: AMPA affected retinal viability dose-dependently and resulted in total and major loss of ChAT and bNOS immunoreactivity, respectively, 24 hours after its administration. This loss was sustained up to 30 days for ChAT-and 8 days for bNOS-expressing amacrine cells. No changes were observed in other retinal cells or in levels of SRIF and sst 2 immunoreactivity. SRIF protected the retina from the AMPA insult in a dose-dependent manner by activating selectively sst 2 receptors.",

Deficiencies in complex I have been reported as the cause of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkisonism. The Gram-negative a-proteobacterium Zymomonas mobilis, a member of the sub-group of bacteria from which mitochondria have evolved, can be used as a model for the study of interactions between the constituents of complex I. Methods: Extraction of the complex I enzymes was performed using a chaotropic reagent. Native PAGE and zymograms were performed according to Quiles et al.[1]. Purification of proteins with Ni + -NTA chromatography was performed according to Rohdich et al.[2]. Results: Zymomonas mobilis cells posses complex I NAD(P)H oxidase activity readily assayed in zymograms. The genome of Z. mobilis apparently contains only six putative genes, as compared to the 14 components of complex I in other bacteria. Two of the genes, predicted from the published genome of Z.mobilis ZM4 encoding products with NAD(P)H-oxidase activity are indicated as rnfE and rnfG homologues. Overexpression of the rnfG homologue resulted in a product which retains NADH-oxidase activity, but lacks full NADPH-oxidase activity. Conclusions: Both rnfG and rnfE homologues are required for full recovery of NADPH-activity of the respiratory complex I in Zymomonas mobilis cells.References: 1. Quiles et al., Plant. Physiol.

Sukhanova Bach Institute of Biochemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, RUSSIA Introduction: Mitochondria are of primary importance in initiating apoptosis in mammalian cells, and the major player in this process is the regulated non-specific, cyclosporin A-sensitive mitochondrial permeability transition (pore, mPTP). So far little is known about a mPTP-like pore in yeast mitochondria. Previously we have shown (Deryabina et al., Biochem (M) 2004; 69: 1261-1270.) that E. magnusii mitochondria possessing the fully competent respiratory chain and a high-capacitive 2+ transport system (Bazhenova et al., JBC 1998; 273: 4372-4377.) do not undergo the typical mPTP. The goal of this study was to induce another types of nonspecific permeability transition in tightly-coupled E. magnusii mitochondria. Methods: Large amplitude mitochondrial swelling and collapse of the membrane potential were used as parameters demonstrating mPTP-like induction.Results: Endomyces magnusii mitochondria did not undergo the Ca 2+ -fatty acid-dependent cyclosporine A-insensitive pore (Sultan and Sokolove. ABB 2001; 386: 52-61.) or a pore mediated by anaerobiosis, depletion of intramitochondrial adenine nucleotide pools, deenergization of mitochondria and by addition of high phosphate concentrations at acidic pH values. Prooxidants (a combination of phenylarsine oxide, menadione and oxaloacetate) caused only regulated membrane depolarization without swelling of mitochondria. ATP prevented prooxidant-induced membrane depolarization and this 'recoupling' effect of ATP was almost totally abolished by Mg 2+ . The only pore found in E. magnusii mitochondria was a highly regulated ATP-dependent + -channel (mito + ) of 'animal type' opened in response to diazoxide and GTP and closed in the presence of ATP and 5-hydroxydecanoic acid. The effect of ATP was partially reversed by Mg 2+ and P i .Conclusions: A role of the mito + channel in commitment of E. magnusii cells to a programmed cell death process in response to different stimuli is suggested.Acknowledgement: This work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (grant 06-04-49687).",

The CcBv ankyrin-like (Ank) protein family is comprised of nine members each possessing four ankyrin repeats resembling the inhibitory domain of cactus, the inhibitor of Drosophila melanogaster NF-jB. Methods: Six CcBV ank genes were cloned into insect and mammalian expression vectors. To measure the effect of Ank proteins on NF-jB transcription, we employed the Firefly luciferase gene under the control of an insect antimicrobial peptide gene promoter containing NF-jB-like binding motifs or a mammalian NF-jB responsive promoter in transcriptional assays. Expression constructs were tested in multiple lepidopteran cell lines, such as Bombyx mori Bm5, Trichoplusia ni HighFive\u00e4 and Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21, and in mammalian HEK293 cells. Results: For the insect systems, the best luciferase expression was observed in Sf21 cells. The assessment of CcBV Ank effects on antimicrobial gene activation is still in progress. For the mammalian system, preliminary results have shown that at least three Ank proteins inhibit NF-jB transcription by approximately 20%. Conclusions: Some Ank proteins are implicated in the NF-jB pathway of a mammalian cell line.

We evaluated the effect of bovine PRL (bPRL) on S. aureus internalization in a primary culture of bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMEC) and on the expression of cytokine and innate immune response genes. Methods: Invasion assays of S. aureus ATCC 27543 strain in bMEC were carried out with different concentrations of bPRL. We analyzed the effect of bPRL on the expression of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa), interleukin 1b (IL-b), b defensin and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by RT-PCR, as well as on NO production in bMEC infected with S. aureus. Results: bPRL (5 ng/ml) enhances 3-fold the internalization of S. aureus (ATCC 27543) into bMEC. Additionally, bPRL is able to upregulates the expression of TNF-a, IL-b and iNOS mRNAs. However, bPRL together with S. aureus infection did not modify the expression of TNF-a and iNOS mRNAs, while they down-regulated the expression of b defensin and IL-b mRNAs, as well as NO production. Conclusions: bPRL stimulates the internalization of S. aureus into bMEC. These cells were able to raise different innate immune responses to infection in the presence of the hormone, suggesting that PRL together with S. aureus regulate diverse host innate immune elements.PP5B-28Adenylate cyclase toxin, Ca 2+ influx and lipid rafts: impairment of cell adhesivenessH.

Its role in the pathogenesis of B. pertussis was clearly demonstrated in a murine respiratory model (Gross et al., 1992). Though ACT has been shown to bind in vitro a variety of cell types, in vivo studies strongly suggest that the natural hosts for ACT are immune cells such as alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, and a specific receptor, the a M b 2 ? integrin (CD11b/CD18), has been proposed in hematopoietic cells(Guermonprez et al., 2001). Integrins of the b2 family are heterodimeric receptors directly implicated in cell-cell or cell-ECM adhesion processes that are of vital importance for a correct functioning of the immnune system. In the present work we have investigated the calcium influx induced by ACT in Jurkat 774A.1 cells and its effects on the integrin-mediated adhesive properties of these cells.

We investigated the activity of indirubins towards L. donovani promastigotes, amastigotes and transfectants over-expressing GSK-3b as well as the leishmanial GSK-3b (LdGSK-3b) and CDK1 (CRK3) homologues. Methods: The leishmanicidal activity of indirubins was assessed using the Alamar blue assay. Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle analysis and apoptosis-like death was evaluated using Annexin V/PI and Tunel labeling. LdGSK-3b over-expressing transfectants were used for purification of LdGSK-3b and subsequent kinase assays. Results: Out of sixteen indirubins tested 6-Br-indirubin-3'-oxime (6-BIO) was the most potent inhibitor of promastigotes and amastigotes with an IC 50 of 0.8 lM and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, consistent with CRK3 inhibition and apoptosis-like death. Kinase assays showed that 6-BIO inhibits LdGSK-3b and CRK3 (kindly provided by Karen Grant) with IC 50 values of 150 nM and 20 nM respectively. However, LdGSK-3b overexpression in L.donovani counteracts 6-BIO growth inhibition (IC 50 of 1.57 lM) and G2/M phase arrest and reduces the levels of apoptosis-like death. Conclusions: 6-BIO was more active against CRK3, suggesting that selectivity of 6-Br indirubins for mammalian GSK-3 over CDKs(1)is not valid in Leishmania. Over-expression of LdGSK-3b counteracts the effects of 6-BIO, suggesting that LdGSK-3b is directly or indirectly involved in G2/M phase transition and 6-BIO-induced apoptosis. Our results validate both kinases as drug targets and open up the possibility of designing Leishmaniaselective indirubin-based inhibitors for treating leishmaniasis.Reference: 1. Meijer et al. Chem.

DHP-lipid molecules were subjected to MD from the initial structure of a periodic lipid bilayer-water box, with a small amount of excessive water on the lipid edges to ensure the mobility of lipid molecules. Results: After 14 ns of MD simulation the lipid molecules with the fatty acid tails started to squeeze from one bilayer layer to another one. After 35 ns few lipid molecules turned with their charged heads to the side of the lipid bilayer and after 100 ns a profound tubular micelle structure began to form. The tubular micelle structure becomes more perfect during the course of simulation of 300 ns.Conclusions: Conclusion is that one of the gene transfection agent 1.4-DHP lipid structures is a tubular micelle.

Kyriakidis 1,2 1 Laboratory of Biochemistry, Department of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, GREECE, 2 National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, GREECEThe AtoS-AtoC two-component system in E. coli consists of the membrane bound AtoS sensor kinase and the AtoC response regulator. Upon acetoacetate-mediated induction, AtoS autophosporylates and consequently phosphorylates, thereby activating, AtoC. AtoC regulates positively the transcriptional activation of atoDAEB operon, encoding for enzymes involved in short-chain fatty acid catabolism. AtoS-AtoC system acting on its target atoDAEB operon regulates the biosynthesis and the intracellular distribution of short-chain poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (cPHB), a biopolymer with many physiological roles in E. coli, under acetoacetate or spermidine induction. The extrachromosomal introduction of the atoSC locus and the atoDAEB operon in Dato-DAEB strain increases cPHB levels in the presence of the inducers. Enhancement of cPHB is also achieved by the AtoS-AtoC system in the absence of its target operon. DatoDAEB cells overproducing the AtoS kinase accumulate only the basal cPHB levels independently to the presence of acetoacetate or spermidine. However, AtoC up-regulates cPHB in the absence of atoDAEB operon upon induction. Exposure of DatoDAEB cells which overproduce the AtoS-AtoC system or only AtoC to cerulenin or acrylic acid, results to reduction of cPHB levels. Cerulenin, the inhibitor of fatty acids biosynthesis pathway, caused the more pronounced down-regulation of cPHB. These data suggest that in the absence of atoDAEB operon, AtoC possibly regulates cPHB biosynthesis through the fatty acid metabolism pathways, with the biosynthesis being the most potent mechanism.This work was supported by doctoral research scholarships of the 'State Scholarships Foundation' and 'Onassis Foundation'. -AtoC system in E. coli is a member of the two-component system (TCS) family. Upon induction by external stimuli, the membrane sensor kinase AtoS autophosphorylates and subsequently it phosphorylates the response regulator AtoC, which activates the transcription of the atoDAEB operon encoding for proteins involved in short-chain fatty acid catabolism. Additionally, the AtoS-AtoC system and its target atoDAEB operon regulate the complexed poly-(R)-3hydroxybutyrate (cPHB) biosynthesis under acetoacetate or spermidine induction. Global analyses of the E. coli TCSs have revealed that AtoS-AtoC might be involved in many additional processes. This study aimed to investigate the possible contribution of the AtoS-AtoC TCS in E. coli chemotaxis. E. coli DatoSC and atoSC + and their transformed derivatives with plasmids overproducing the whole or part of the AtoS-AtoC TCS, were grown with Asp, Ser, Met or Glu as chemoattractants, in the presence of acetoacetate, spermidine, histamine, C48/80 or Ca 2+ . Chemotaxis was evaluated by determining cell motility using the swarm agar assay. DatoSC cells were not motile independently to the chemoattractant or the agent added. The extrachromosomal introduction of the AtoS-AtoC system in DatoSC bacteria restored their motility. The AtoS-AtoC expressing cells demonstrated an agent concentration-dependent motility in the presence of Asp and Ser. DatoSC cells expressing either AtoS or AtoC in trans demonstrated no response to the chemoattractants independently of the agents added. These data suggested that the AtoS-AtoC TCS may participate in the E. coli chemotactic response, thus being implicated in bacterial adaptation to continuously changing environments.

Ongoing neurogenesis via the SVZ -rostral migratory stream (RMS) pathway maintains neuronal replacement in the olfactory bulb (OB) throughout life. The mechanisms of postnatal neurogenesis largely depend on controlling the balance between precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. Cend1 is a neuronal lineage specific regulator implicated in cell cycle exit and differentiation of precursor cells in the embryonic neural tube. Here we investigated its role in postnatal neurogenesis. Methods: For the functional study of Cend1 in vitro we used new generation lentiviral vectors in SVZ-derived neurospheres and explants to over express and silence Cend1, as well as Western blot, Real Time RT-PCR, Luciferase assay and immunohistochemistry to assess Cend1 functional potential in postnatal neurogenesis. Results: Endogenous Cend1 distribution in vivo revealed that it is expressed in low levels in neuronal precursors of the adult SVZ and in high levels in post-mitotic OB interneurons. We found that Cend1 overexpression decreases proliferation and favours neuronal differentiation, while its downregulation using RNAi vectors yields the opposite phenotype. Moreover, Cend1 overexpression down-regulates protein levels of Notch1 and its downstream effector Hes1, while forced expression of the proneural gene Neurogenin-1 in neurospheres up-regulates Cend1. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that Cend1 participates in cell cycle exit regulation and neuronal differentiation mechanisms during postnatal SVZ neurogenesis and becomes crucial for the transition from neuroblasts to mature neurons when reaching high levels.PP6C-4 Induction of apoptosis with staurosporine in knockout H2AX mouse embryonic stem cells results in chromatin relaxation and disorganization N.

BM88/Cend1 is a neuronal protein that participates in the complex pathways regulating cell cycle progression/exit and differentiation in the central nervous system. Gain of function approaches both in vitro and in vivo in the chick neural tube, show that BM88 negatively regulates proliferation of neuronal precursors while promoting their premature differentiation. The opposite is observed with RNAi silencing in embryonic and adult neural stem cells. Physiologically, BM88 is expressed at low levels in neuronal progenitors and at higher levels in differentiated neurons, including the Purkinje and granule neurons of the postnatal cerebellum. Methods: We have generated BM88 knockout mice, in which the BM88 coding and 3\u00a2 untranslated region have been removed and replaced by the b-galactosidase gene. To assess the effect of BM88 ablation, we used PCR, southern blot and immunohistochemistry. Results: Loss of BM88 in the cerebellum affects granule cell proliferation and differentiation. At postnatal day 6, the external granule layer characterized by extended proliferation, is augmented by 12% in BM88 null mice. BrdU incorporation is also increased by 20%, whereas the thickness of the internal granule layer, where differentiated granule cells lie, is reduced by 11%, as revealed by NeuN immunostaining.Conclusions: Our data illustrate the dual function of BM88/Cend1 in controlling cell cycle exit and differentiation in the developing of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, GREECE, 2 Immune Disease Institute and Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA, 3 Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, GREECE Introduction: Hemen (iron-protoporphyrin IX) is synthesized in mitochondria and imported from plasma as a by-product of hemoglobin catabolism.

Baserga 2 1 Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, TURKEY, 2 Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USAIntroduction: The insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a docking protein for both type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor (IR). IRS-1 sends mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signal. It also inhibits differentiation and promotes transformation of cells. IGF-IR is a transmembrane receptor and belongs to the tyrosine kinase receptor family. When activated by its ligands, it plays an important role in growth and survival of cells. Methods: BT-20 cells originated from a human breast cancer and they don't express IRS-1. Two different cell lines were derived from parental BT-20 cells, one expressing IRS-1 protein with a nuclear localization signal (BT-20/NLS) and the other expressing the high levels of IRS-1 (BT-20/159). Nuclear translocation of IRS-1 was determined by confocal microscopy. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to understand the occupancy of rDNA, cyclin D1 and c-myc promoters and activation of these promoters was followed by using luciferase reporter assay. Results: Our confocal microscopy results have shown that after stimulation with IGF-1, IRS-1 translocates to the nucleus. Nuclear translocation of IRS-1 has also been confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. It has been shown that IRS-1 binds both rDNA and cyclin D1 promoters in a time dependent manner and activates both promoters and also c-myc promoter. Conclusion: These results indicate that in BT-20 cells expression of IRS-1 activates promoters involved in cell growth and cell proliferation which affects the maintaining of transformed phenotype.",

Fuchs 1 , D. Provaznikova 1 , I. Marinov 1 , K. Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC, 2 General Faculty Hospital, Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC Introduction: Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-b1)-regulated apoptosis is still poorly understood and is cell type and context-dependent. Bortezomib (N-pyrazinecarbonyl-L-phenylalanine-L-leucine boronic acid, VELCADE, formerly known as PS-341 or MLN-341, Millenium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA) is the first member of proteasome inhibitors which obtained approval as chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. We studied the effect of TGF-b1 and of bortezomib on induction of apoptosis in human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines ML-1, ML-2, CTV-1 and KASUMI1. Methods: Leukemia cells were preincubated for 24-96 hour without addition (control group) or with TGF-b1 (5 ng/ml or 10 ng/ml) or with bortezomib (4 nM or 10 nM). Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry using annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide assay and by cell cycle analysis. Caspase-3-like enzyme activity was measured by enzymatic cleavage of fluorogenic peptide substrate, Ac-DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. Statistical significance of the experimental results was analyzed by Student\u00b4s paired t-test. Results and conclusions: TGF-b1 inhibited DNA synthesis only in KASUMI-1 cells but not in other leukemia cells used. Bortezomib (10 nM) was potent inhibitor of DNA synthesis in all four types of leukemia cells and induced apoptosis in KASUMI-1, ML-2 and CTV-1 cells but not in ML-1 cells. KASUMI-1 and ML-2 cells were also sensitive to induction of apoptosis by TGF-b1 but in lesser extent than by bortezomib. Kinetics of apoptosis was different in individual cell lines and was slower in induction by TGF-b1 than with bortezomib. Acknowledgements: This study was supported by the IGA, Ministry of Health, CR (NR/9045-3). Alcohol consumption increases the permeability of the intestine, permitting certain bacterial endotoxins to pass through the intestinal wall into the portal blood stream. Upon reaching the liver, endotoxins stimulate the Kupffer cells, the infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages to produce cytokines. Chronic alcohol consumption activates certain detoxifying enzymes in the liver. The metabolism of alcohol by these enzymes generates ROS (reactive oxygen species) which, in turn, stimulate cytokine production. Proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u00df and IL-6 elicit defensive responses in parenchymal cells, including activation of apoptosis (via IL-1\u00df). IL-6 plays an important antiapoptotic role in the liver, stimulating liver repair after injury. In addition, IL-8 promotes neutrophilia as well as neutrophil infiltration of liver tissue. We were interested in studying the cytokine signals which are involved in the development of alcoholic liver injury. Methods: We are focusing on three cytokines: IL-1\u00df, IL-6 and IL-8. The seric levels of these three cytokines were determined in 30 patients with chronic alcoholism (9 women and 21 men, ages 28-57 years), without any clinical or paraclinical proof of alcoholic liver disease using ELISA kits. Results: demonstrate a significant increase of IL-6 and IL-8 seric levels, by comparison with those obtained from the control subjects.Conclusion: IL-6 and IL-8 are implicated in the shift of the balance of cytokine-induced defensive and damage responses in hepatocytes.

Parrado Department of Immunology, Virgen de la Arrixaca Hospital, Servicio Murciano de Salud-FFIS, El Palmar-Murcia, SPAINIntroduction: The Rho GTPases form a subgroup of the Ras superfamily that regulates a wide spectrum of cellular functions. Dock/CZH proteins are a new family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho GTPases. The Dock-D or Zizimin subfamily is composed of three members, two of which, Dock9 and Dock11, are activators of the Rho GTPase Cdc42. Here we report the molecular cloning of Dock10, identified as an Interleukin-4 (IL4) induced protein in B lymphocytes. Methods: Tissue expression of Dock10 was analyzed by Northern Blot. Differential expression and modulation by IL4 in lymphocyte subsets was analyzed by Western Blot. Stable clones of HeLa cells with inducible expression of Dock10 or HA-Dock10 were generated using the tet-off system. Subcellular expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence. In vitro interaction with major Rho GTPases, e.g. Cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA, was tested by pulldown assays. Results: Dock10 was expressed in a variety of tissues, being most prominent in peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes. Dock10 was expressed at similar levels in PB-B cells and PB-T cells. However, IL4 only induced Dock10 expression in PB-B cells. Dock10 was localized mainly in the cytoplasm of the Dock10-expressing clones. Dock10 interacted in vitro with nucleotide-depleted Cdc42 and Rac1, but not with RhoA. Conclusions: These data suggest that, like Dock9 and Dock11, Dock10 may act as specific GEF for Cdc42 and in addition for Rac1. The induction of Dock10 expression by IL4 in mature B cells suggests a role for Dock10 in IL4-induced B-cell activation.PP7A-30Nuclear targeting of FBPase is controlled by beta-adrenergic receptor signaling cascade A. Gizak and D. Rakus Department of Animal Psysiology, Wroclaw University, Wroclaw, POLAND Introduction: Muscle fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), a wellknown regulatory enzyme of glyconeogenic pathway has recently appeared to be actively transported into nuclei of cardiomyocytes. This surprising finding rised a questions concerning nuclear role of FBPase and the extracellular signals regulating its nuclear import. To addres these questions we have attempted to identify the membrane receptors and pathways transducing signals from cell surface to FBPase and engaged in the reversible FBPase targeting to the nuclei of the HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Methods: The effect of activation/inhibition of cardiomyocyte membrane receptors and their intracellular signal transduction pathways on nuclear transport of FBPase was analyzed in vitro, using immunofluorescence method, and in vivo, using protein transfection reagents introducing FITC-modified FBPase into differently stimulated HL-1 cells. Results: Results of both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the most pronounced effect on nuclear localization of FBPase exerts stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptors of HL-1 cells. Wihdrawal of noradrenalin from culture medium and inhibition of downstream target of beta-adrenergic receptor signaling cascade-protein kinase A resulted in FBPase active export from nucleus. Activators of adenylyl cyclase abolished the effect of noradrenalin withdrawal, suggesting that in FBPase nuclear import stimulation Gs protein is involved. Conclusions: Nuclear targeting of FBPase in HL-1 cells is under control of beta-adrenergic-dependent PKA stimulation. Since beta-adrenergic signaling regulates also cell division in neonatal and HL-1 cardiomiocytes, our results support the hypothesis that FBPase is engaged in the regulation of cell proliferation. decarboxylase (DDC) is the enzyme which catalyses the biosynthesis of dopamine (DA) by decarboxylating L-Dopa (L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl-alanine) to dopamine. In order to identify possible interactions of DDC with other proteins, the phage display method was employed, using as target molecule the human recombinant DDC. Specifically-bound phage clones were identified by sequencing. Interactions between human DDC and peptide epitopes, that share homology with Phophatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3k), as well as Neuroligin 3 (NLGN3) were detected. The PI3k signaling pathway has emerged as an important component required for the formation, survival and differentiation of the nervous system. Furthermore, synaptogenesis plays a central role in the survival of the nervous system. NLGN3 is a postsynaptic adhesion molecule that is related to neurodegenaration. Polyclonal antibodies, specific for PI3k and NLGN3, were raised in our laboratory and were found to immunopercipitate DDC activity in mouse kidney homogenates. Protein interactions were additionally studied by immunopercipitation under nondenaturing conditions followed by western blot analysis. Our data indicated the interaction between DDC with PI3k and NLGN3 in both, neural (SH-SY5Y) and nonneural (K293) human cell lines. The functional significance of the above observations is under further investigation.Acknowledgements: This project represents part of the graduate thesis of Miss Gkogkosi in the frame of the Graduate Programme in Clinical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics leading to an M.Sc. degree.

Faculty, Istanbul University, Istanbul, TURKEYWnts are a family of proteins which activate the wnt signaling pathway by binding frizzled receptors on the surface of the cell. Wnt pathway is commonly activated in many cancer types such as colorectal, oesophageal, and gastric cancer. In this study we aimed to analyze the expression of wnt genes and b-Catenin gene in gastric cancer tissues to determine the activity of wnt pathway in gastric carcinoma. We analyzed expression of Wnt1, Wnt3, Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt5b, and b-catenin genes in 21 gastric cancer tissues by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. We also studied b-catenin localization in parafine embedded tumor samples by immunohistochemistry. Results indicate that, Wnt1 is expressed in 15 (71.4%), Wnt3 is expressed in 9 (42.8%), Wnt4 is expressed in 13 (61.9%), Wnt5a is expressed in 17 (80.9%), Wnt5b is expressed in 13 (61.9%), and b-catenin is expressed in 13 (61.9%) out of 21 tumor samples. When we compare the co-expression of wnt genes and b-catenin in the tumor tissues, b-catenin was co-expresed with Wnt1 gene in 10 (47.6%), Wnt3 gene in 4 (19%), Wnt4 in 9 (42.8%), Wnt5a in 10 (47.6%), and Wnt5b in 7 (33.3%) out of 21 samples. However, immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that only 4 samples had nuclear b-catenin loacalization. Eventhough coexpression of Wnt and b-catenin genes were observed in tumor tissues localization results of b-catenin reveals that wnt signal is regulated by another regulatory molecule in the pathway or signal might be transduced by noncanonical wnt pathway in gastric carcinomas.",

PP7A-48 Vasoactive intestinal peptide inhibits human retinal pigment epithelial cell proliferation via the adenyl cyclase pathway P. Kothary, N. Himani, J. Kim, J. Lee, S. Patel and M. Del Monte University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USAPurpose: Human retinal pigment epithelial (hRPE) cells are specialized cells located between the choroid and neural retina. Abnormal proliferation of hRPE cells results in blinding proliferative vitreo-retinopathy. Since very little is known about the neural regulation of hRPE cells and the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is known to influence the structure and function of hRPE cells, we examined the effect and mechanism action of VIP on hRPE cell proliferation. Methods: hRPE cell cultures were established from human eyes. Fetal bovine serum stimulated hRPE cell proliferation in presence and absence of VIP and H89, an adenyl cyclase inhibitor, was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method (T) and by 3H-thymidine incorporation (3H-thy). Data significance was analyzed by Student t test. Results: FBS (0-10%) stimulated hRPE proliferation in a dose-dependent manner as measured by 3H-thy as well as T. The addition of VIP (1 lM) inhibited FBS (1%) stimulated hRPE proliferation (3Hthy = 2.990 \u00b1 1.041 vs. 12.116 \u00b1 2.926, CPM \u00b1 SEM, n = 7, p < 0.05). Further, VIP (1 lM) inhibition of FBS (1%) stimulated 3H-thy was reversed in hRPE cells by H89 (1lM). (10289 \u00b1 2191.7 vs. 2.990 \u00b1 1.041, CPM \u00b1 SEM, n = 7, p < 0.05). Conclusion: We conclude that VIP inhibits FBS stimulated hRPE cell proliferation via the adenyl cyclase messenger pathway. Therefore, neural peptide control of hRPE cell proliferation may play a role in pathogenesis of proliferative eye diseases.",

Paik Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, KOREA Introduction: Lithospermate B (LAB) is an active component isolated from Salvia miltiorrhizae. We investigated the anti-fibrogenic effects of LAB and underlying mechanisms in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and cirrhotic animal model. Methods: For in vitro study, we used immortal human HSC cell line. MTS assay, intracellular ROS production, NF-jB transcriptional activation, and human MCP-1 were measured. Quantification of type 1 collagen in medium was done by Western blotting. For in vivo study, we used thioacetamide (TAA) to induce liver cirrhosis in Sprague-Dawley rats. Real-time PCR was used to quantify mRNA expressions of a-SMA, TGF-b 1, and collagen a 1. Results: LAB suppressed PDGF-induced HSCs proliferation (p < 0.05). H 2 O 2 induced increase in ROS formation in HSCs. LAB inhibited H 2 O 2 -induced ROS generation (H 2 O 2 vs. H 2 O 2 + LAB; 9.1 vs. 3.5-fold over baseline, p < 0.01). LAB significantly inhibited NF-jB activation in HSCs. Incubation of HSCs with LAB suppressed MCP-1 secretion compared to untreated controls (Untreated vs. LAB;239.2 ng/ml vs. 8.5 ng/ml, p < 0.01). LAB at higher than 50 uM significantly attenuated type 1 collagen secretion. Masson's trichrome stain showed attenuated hepatic fibrosis in TAA+LAB group (p < 0.05). mRNA expressions of a-SMA, TGF-b 1, collagen a 1 were significantly decreased in TAA+LAB group compared to TAA only group. Conclusions: Lithospermate B showed strong anti-fibrotic effects in both HSCs and cirrhotic rats possibly through potent anti-oxidative effect in human HSCs.",

It is synthesized by the liver as preprohepcidin, targeted to the secretory pathway, and cleaved into an active peptide by the serine protease furin. Hepcidin is acting through ferroportin: the hepcidin-ferroportin complex is internalized into the cells and degraded. Therefore high serum level of hepcidin reduces serum iron level. Methods: We used the BacterioMatch two-hybrid system, developed in bacteria to map the in vivo interactions of prohepcidin and hepcidin with ferroportin. To find the active binding portion of ferroportin, the protein was cut into parts, containing different number of transmembrane domains. To see the effect of hepcidin structure on binding activity, we systematically mutated one of each pair of cysteins to serine in the hepcidin molecule. Results: Preprohepcidin engages into weak interaction with the whole ferroportin molecule, but the binding is stronger with the ferroportin pieces. The M1 mutant preprohepcidin showed no interaction with ferroportin and with ferroportin pieces. The mature hepcidin is binding to whole ferroportin and to the first third portion of the N-terminal of ferroportin very efficiently. M1 mutant hepcidin gave no binding to the whole ferroportin molecule and weak binding to the ferroportin parts Conclusions: Our in vivo binding studies prove that mature hepcidin is binding much strongly to ferroportin compared to preprohepcidin, and it binds to the N-terminal part of the molecule. The binding between ferroportin and hepcidin will occur only if the disulphide bridges of hepcidin are intact. Pleiotrophin (PTN) is an 18 kDa secreted protein displaying high affinity for heparin. It has a neurite outgrowth promoting activity, is mitogenic for a variety of cell types, is angiogenic and is implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. In the present work, we studied the involvement of endogenous PTN in angiogenesis of the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Methods: A combination of methods was used, including western blot analysis, CAM transfection, angiogenesis assay, reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction and haematoxylin-eosin staining of CAM paraffin sections. Results: PTN protein and mRNA amounts, as well as its interaction with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase b/e (RPTPb/e) were maximal at days of on-going angiogenesis and decreased at later time points. Transfection of CAM cells with an anti-sense PTN gene construct led to a significant decrease in PTN amounts compared to vector control transfected CAMs, and a significant gene dose-dependent decrease in the number of CAM blood vessels. PTN is localized either in the endothelial cell lining of all vessels, or in the smooth muscle cells of the larger vessels. Interestingly, PTN was also detected in the nucleus of endothelial cells up to the 12th day of embryo development. This localization is possibly mediated by a direct interaction between PTN and nucleolin, as evidenced in both CAM and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, although the functional significance of this is currently unknown. Conclusions: These data suggest that endogenous PTN is involved in the development of new blood vessels in the chicken embryo CAM and that nucleolin may also have a role in this effect.PP7A-70 Regulation of mitochondrial morphology and cell survival by mitochondrial proteins: LETM1 and CTMP L.

A negative correlation was found between NT-3 and IL-6 serum levels in patients of the group I DEXA+ and in those of the group II DEXA-with a moderate course, while a positive correlation between the two serum parameters was detected in patients of group II DEXA-who died. In addition, a negative correlation between the CFS NT-3 and IL-6 levels was found in survivor patients of the group I and II. The negative correlation between NT-3 and IL-6 suggests that NT-3 may exert a immunomodulatory action on IL-6 responses in survivor patients after the viral neurological infections. The absence of this correlation corresponded to imminence of death. In our study DEXA therapy did not influence the serum and CFS NT-3 dynamics.Reference: 1. R.B.Rock et al CMR, 2004; 17(4): 942-964.

The loss of these interactions and subsequent loss of matrix contact results in anoikis, one form of apoptosis. Anoikis is regulated by cytokines such as TNF-a, a multifunctional cytokine involved in inflammation and other important cellular functions. We investigated the effect of TNF-a on MG63 osteosarcoma cell apoptosis, as a model to interfere with this process in normal and pathological conditions. Methods: Apoptosis induced by TNF-a+cycloheximide (CHX), was determined with nuclei DAPI staining, activation of effector caspase-3, proteolysis of its substrate PARP and expression levels of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Results: MG63 were resistant to TNF-a-induced apoptosis unless they were pre-treated with CHX. Under these conditions the expression levels of TIMP-1, b 1 and a v b 3 integrins were reduced. MG63 cells treated with TNF-a only were resistant to apoptosis. In fact treatment of MG63 cells with TNF-a resulted in activation of the cell survival Akt/ PKB pathway and increased levels of TIMP-1 and a v b 3 integrin. This observation led us to suggest that TNF-a-induced up-regulation of TIMP-1 facilitates interactions between TIMP-1 and cell surface integrins and protects MG63 from TNF-a-induced apoptosis. Our results indicate that TIMP-1 interacts with b 1 and a v b 3 integrins; down-regulation of TIMP-1 expression by siRNA resulted in increased proteolysis of PARP and reduced Bcl-x L expression. Conclusions: Our data suggest that resistance to TNF-a-induced apoptosis correlated with increased expression of TIMP-1 which might protect osteosarcoma cells from anoikis through interaction with cell surface integrins and potentiation of the Akt-mediated survival pathway.PP7A-86Endogenous IL-1b and SOCS-1 induce cell apoptosis through suppression of the insulin signalling pathway in mouse pancreatic b-cells cultured in high glucose E.

Chemical Technology, Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC, 2 Universite Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6 and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Ivry-Sur-Seine, FRANCE, 3 Institute of Experimental Botany AS CR, Prague, CZECH REPUBLICIn plants, the attack of an avirulent pathogen leads to the development of systemic acquired resistance (SAR). This defence mechanism involves a rapid increase in the intracellular level of salicylic acid (SA), both at the site of the infection and in distal tissues. SA triggers a complicated cascade of signalling events, which results in the expression of PR (Pathogenesis-Related) genes enabling the plant to coop with pathogen. The same signalling pathway is initiated in response to exogenous SA treatment. This study brings evidence of the crucial role of phospholipase D in the SA pathway. PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of structural membrane phospholipids, yielding phosphatidic acid (PA), a second messenger involved in several plant signalling processes. In the presence of primary alcohols, PLD preferentially generates appropriate phosphatidylalcohols, which lack the signalling potential of PA. The presented results show the inhibitory effect of n-butanol on the induction of marker genes PR1 and WRKY38 in SA-treated Arabidopsis thaliana suspension-cultured cells. Clusters of 97 genes positively and 117 genes negatively regulated by PLD in response to SA were identified in a DNA microarray analysis of CATMA chips. The analysis of transcriptomic data indicated a close relation between the PLD activity and SA induced increase of polyphosphoinositides described previously in our laboratory(Krinke et al, 2007).Reference: Krinke O, Ruelland E, Valentova O, Vergnolle C, Renou JP, Taconnat L, Flemr M, Burketova L, Zachowski A. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activation is anb early response to salicylic acid in Arabidopsis suspension cells. Plant Phys 2007; 144: 1347-1359. The renin-angiotensin system is a powerful signalling system for controlling controlling sodium balance, body fluid volume and arterial blood pressure. The octapeptide AngiotensinII (AngII) is the major mediator of this system. It is 3-8 fragments AngIV has sparked great interest because it enhances learning and memory and is anticonvulsant. These effects are not inhibited by AT 1/2 receptor antagonists but are mimicked by AT 4 receptor ligands pointing towards the involvement of the AT 4 receptor, recently characterized as the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), a membrane anchored zinc-dependent metalloproteinase. Methods: The metabolism of AngIV and LVVH7, both endogenous AT 4 receptor binding peptides was assessed in the presence of cell membranes of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) and was compared with other angiotensin peptides. For this purpose we measured the inhibition of [ 125 I]-AngIV by these analogs in the presence or absence of divalent metal ion chelators. Results and Conclusions: The difference in potency between both experimental conditions indicates that these peptides are metabolized in the absence of chelators. This metabolism was prevented by the phosphinic derivative (R,S,S)-2-{3-[(1-Amino-ethyl)-hydroxy-phosphinoyl]-2-benzyl-propionylamino}-3-phenyl-propionic acid (compound 7B), an inhibitor of the metalloprotease aminopeptidase-N (AP-N). These findings explain recent data in which co-administration in the striatum of AngIV together with 7B at a concentration selective for AP-N elicited a more pronounced increase in the extracellular DA concentration than AngIV alone. By its capability to lengthen the half-life of exogenously applied AngIV in in vitro as well as in vivo experiments, 7B might represent an interesting tool in the study of AngIV mediated effects. PP7A-90 Nitric oxide-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells J. Varga, J. Bator and J. Szeberenyi Medical School, University of Pecs, Pecs, HUNGARYIntroduction: Nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in signal transduction events by different mechanisms: it activates guanylate cyclase and nitrosylates a number of proteins. In PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells nerve growth factor (NGF) induces neuronal differentiation and promotes cell survival, and NO, as a second messenger, may have a role in these processes. On the other hand, high NO concentrations are cytotoxic. The aim of this study was to try to identify targets of NO in these processes. Methods: Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was used as NO donor in wild type PC12 cells and a subclone expressing a dominant inhibitory Ras (MM17-26 cells). Standard techniques to analyze protein levels, protein phosphorylation and apoptotic events were employed. Results: Although SNP in small concentration accelerates NGFinduced differentiation of PC12 cells, it is unable to overcome the block of differentiation in MM17-26 cells. At high concentration SNP induces apoptosis in both PC12 and MM17-26 cells, accompanied by p38MAPK and JNK activation, cleavage of protein kinase R (PKR) and phosphorylation of eIF2a in both cell lines. NGF restores inhibited Akt phosphorylation caused by toxic SNP doses, but is unable to prevent SNP-induced apoptosis. Conclusions: The results of this work indicate that high concentrations of NO induce apoptotic cell death of PC12 cells in a Ras-independent manner. Death of the cells may be mediated by several stressactivated protein kinase pathways (p38, JNK and PKR), and by the inhibition of Akt-mediated survival signaling.

It is believed that adiponectin has protective actions in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis through anti-inflammatory effects which are exerted via macrophages, through suppression of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS. We and others (Tsatsanis et al. BBRC 2005; 335 (4) 1254-63, Park et al. JBC 2007; 282 (30) 21695-703) have shown that the potential anti-inflammatory effect of adiponectin is due to the induction of macrophage tolerance. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms initiated by adiponectin that render macrophages tolerant to pro-inflammatory stimuli. Methods: Thioglycollate-elicitated peritoneal macrophages from TPL2-/-AKT1-/-and IRAK-M-/-mice were treated with adiponectin and LPS and molecular mechanisms of tolerance were studied with western blotting, Real time RT PCR and ELISA. Results: In this study we show that adiponectin controls macrophage tolerance by inducing IRAK-M expression via ERK/Tpl2 and PI3K/ AKT dependant mechanisms. IRAK-M expression is induced in mouse peritoneal macrophages upon gAd stimulation, leading to the suppression of the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by LPS. The tolerogenic properties of adiponectin were abrogated in IRAK-M deficient mice further supporting the involvement of IRAK-M in adiponectin induced macrophage tolerance. Conclusion: Adiponectin is an important regulator of macrophage activation, by lowering the magnitude of the inflammatory response via induction of IRAK-M, which is one of the major negative feedback mechanisms in TLR4 signaling.",

Lazou Laboratory of Animal Physiology, School of Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, GREECEIntroduction: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor b/d (PPAR b/d) is a transcription factor that belongs to the superfamily of nuclear receptors and plays a prominent role in the regulation of cardiac lipid metabolism. Activation of PPAR b/d has been also associated with inhibition of growth and inflammatory response. However the role of PPAR b/d in cardiac hypertrophy is not yet known. Methods: Adult rat cardiac myocytes were cultured in the presence of the hypertrophic agonist phenylephrine (PE) and/or GW0742, a specific synthetic ligand of PPAR b/d. Cell size was measured as an index of hypertrophy. Activation of kinases was determined by immunoblotting and expression of PPAR b/d was determined by RT-PCR. Results: Treatment of cardiac myocytes with GW0742 inhibited the PE-induced phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), mitogen and stress activated kinase 1 (MSK1) and Akt. In addition, GW0742 inhibited the PE-induced increase in cell size.Conclusions: The results suggest that activation of PPAR b/d interferes with the signalling pathways of MAPK and Akt and this may contribute to the inhibition of cardiac hypertrophic growth. -terminal domain of the d-opioid receptor (d-OR) consists of 62 amino acids and contains the consensus 317YAFL320 motif. Recent observations from our laboratory have shown that the conserved YXXL motif within the C-terminal tail of l-opioid receptor (l-OR) serves as a docking site for STAT5A transcriptional factor binding, which is phosphorylated upon l-OR stimulation (1). In this regard, we sought to determine whether members of the STAT5 transcriptional factors interact also with the d-OR and whether STAT5 phosphorylation is universal among the opioid receptors. Co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays, using a GST fusion peptide encompassing the C-terminal region of the d-OR (d-CT), have shown that STAT5B interacts directly with d-OR. A truncated version of the d-CT that lacks the first 26 amino acids indicated the importance of the N-terminal portion of the d-CT for STAT5B binding. Additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that STAT5B forms constitutively functional complexes with Gbc subunits and the d-OR. DSLET-activation of d-OR, expressed in HEK293 cells, resulted in a PTX-dependent STAT5B phosphorylation by the endogenous c-Src tyrosine kinase. Collectively, our results have shown the formation of dynamic complexes between STAT5B, Gbc and d-OR and reveal novel signaling pathways through which d-opioid receptor may modulate transcription in neurons and alter synaptosomal plasticity.

An angiogenic activity of Hp has been also reported, although the action mechanism remains to be understood. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) transcribes various angiogenic factors in physiological and pathological hypoxic conditions. To verify whether the HIF-1a can induce Hp gene expression, we investigated the Hp induction in human hepatoma cells transfected by HIF-1a gene, and analyzed the transcription-regulating sites within Hp promoter. Results: The results of RT-PCR and Western blot showed that the HIF-1a increased Hp expression in HepG2 cells. Hp promoter assay using luciferase reporter also showed the HIF-1a-induced upregulation of Hp gene expression. The luciferase assay using deleted and pointmutated Hp promoters and electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that a STAT3-binding element (SBE) and a cAMPresponse element (CRE) in Hp promoter (-183/-99) were required for the HIF-1a-induced Hp gene expression. In chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, the DNA binding of HIF1a and STAT3 at the promoter region containing SBE/CRE was identified. Conclusions: These findings suggest that HIF-1a upregulates Hp gene expression in HepG2 cells and the transcriptional activity may be regulated by cooperative actions of HIF1a and STAT3 on the SBE/CRE sites located at -124/-94 of Hp promoter.

This was confirmed by Q-RT-PCR and Westernblot analyses. Rho-GDIb stimulates Cox-2 expression partly by activating NFAT-1 depending transcription of the Cox-2 gene. Vav-1, an interaction partner of Rho-GDIb, also interfered with Cox-2 expression and NFAT-1 cellular distribution suggesting a cooperative action of Rho-GDIb and Vav-1 on Cox-2 expression. To explore the importance of Rho-GDIb for the survival of breast cancer patients, two cohorts including 263 and 117 patients were analyzed for clinical outcome in relation to Rho-GDIb RNA and protein levels, respectively. Expression of Rho-GDIb was not associated with either diseasefree or overall survival in the two patient population. Conclusions: The expression of Rho-GDIb in breast cancer is neither beneficial nor disadvantageous to the patient. This may be the net effect of two opposing activities of Rho-GDIb, one that suppresses tumor progression by inhibiting migration and the other that stimulates it by enhancing Cox-2 expression.",

The neuroprotective and vascular protective effects of APC have recently been reported. Recent studies have shown that APC is protective against cerebral and spinal cord ischemic injury. APC exerts its anti-inflammatory effect via reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) by suppressing nuclear factor-jB and activator protein-1 transcription factors. Microglial cells, the immune cells of central nervous system derived from myeloid lineage, were shown to be activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. To investigate whether APC modulates glial cells in inflammatory conditions, we studied the effect of APC on LPS-induced cell death and TNF-a production in N9 murine microglial cells. Methods: We used murine microglial cell line N9 for the experiments.",

The modulation of microglial responses by APC might be involved in the beneficial effects of this molecule in central nervous system injury in vivo. Many hormone metabolites and neurotransmitters bear catechol groups in their molecules. Some of these biomolecules are involved in neurodegeneration. The catechol group is also found in xenobiotics. In this study, 1,2-dihydroxybenzene (catechol) was used to assess the role of this functional group in the induction of cell death. Methods: Neuroblastoma N2a cells were cultured and treated with catechol (1-200 lmol/l) for 72 hours to determine its EC 50 . Cell viability was studied by the MTT assay. L-Cysteine was used to test the protective effect of sulfhydryl groups in catechol-induced cytotoxicity. Monochlorobimane (MCB) was used to assess glutathione (GSH) depletion. The mode of cell death was investigated by flow cytometry analysis of cells labeled with annexin V and propidium iodide.Results: The incubation with catechol for 72 hours showed that the minimal cytotoxic concentration was 20 lmol/l. The calculated EC 50 after 72 hours was 38 lmol/l. L-Cysteine protected cells significantly in a dose-dependant manner. The use of monochlorobimane showed that catechol induced GSH depletion after 24 hours of incubation, prior to the induction of cell death. Furthermore, catechol induced apoptosis of N2a cells after 72 hours. Conclusions: Catechol is a functional group that induces glutathione depletion and apoptosis of neuroblastoma N2a cells.

Choe Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, KOREA1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP + ), the active metabolite of MPTP and inhibitor of mitochondrial complex, has been widely used as a neurotoxin, because it give rise to a severe Parkinson's disease-like syndrome with elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and apoptotic death. Cyclophilins (Cyps) have peptidyl-prolyl cistrans isomerase (PPIase) activity, catalyzes the isomerization of the peptide bond between pSer/Thr-Pro in proteins, thereby regulating their biological functions including protein assembly, folding, intracellular transport, intracellular signaling, transcription, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of overexpressed cyps on MPP + -induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with MPP + caused the cell death associated with elevation of ROS level. Overexpressed cyps in SH-SY5Y cells increased the cell viability and reduced ROS level in cells. Our results suggested that overexpressed cyps in SH-SY5Y cells protects on cells against MPP + -induced neurotoxicity.

In healthy individuals plasma Glu is under tight regulation while at conditions characterized by immune-deficiency (AIDS, renal failure and malignancies) its plasma concentration is highly elevated. In vitro, high glutamate concentrations decrease stimulated T-cell intacellular calcium elevation and proliferation. Recently we proposed that elevated Glu is exerting its immunosupressive effects, at least partly, throught negative regulation of the main potassium condcuctance of T-cells namely; the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3. In an efford to explore the site of action of high Glu in T-cells through which it suppresses channel activity we employed electrophysiological and molecular biology techniques in freshly isolated human T-cells. Methods: Patch-clamp, RT-PCR, and immunocytochemistry. Results: Herein, we provide converging evidence that elevated Glu (above 100 lM) decrease Kv1.3 channel activity through group II metabotropic Glu receptor (mGluR2/3) activation. Specifically, we demonstrate that in human T-cells: (i) Kv1.3 channel inhibition, by high Glu, is alleviated by the highly selective mGluR2/3 antagonist, LY341495 (ii) the mGluR2/3 receptor agonist DCG-IV decreased Kv1.3 channel activity dose-dependently and its effects were alleviated by LY341495, and (iii) mGluR2/3 receptors are expressed both in the mRNA and protein level. Conclusion: The above data demonstrates that human T-cells express functional group II mGluRs, and their activation is linked to Kv1.3 channel modulation. Given that Kv1.3 channels in T-cells regulate their resting and activated state, the above data suggest an immunomodulatory role for mGluR2/3.PP7C-26Proteomic analysis of HRAS-mediated oncogenic transformation of a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line -an approach to identify novel therapeutic targetsG.

Biological Research and Biotechnology, National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, GREECE, 2 Institute of Biology, National Centre for Scientific Research 'Demokritos', Attiki, GREECESince lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer death new therapeutic approaches are eagerly needed. Methylating agents constitute a widely used class of anticancer drugs and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) is a model methylating agent. Another promising class of anticancer agents are histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs). One of the most well-studied HDACI is trichostatin A (TSA). Although they are entirely different chemical compounds, both have been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cell lines. However, their effects on human non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells have not been elucidated. Cell death was assessed by cytofluorometry of DNA content and immunodetection of specific markers. Cytotoxic doses of either MNU or TSA induced apoptotic cell death in the NSCLC cell line H157 (p53 mut ). In A549 (p53 wt ), another NSCLC cell line, only TSA induced apoptosis while MNU induced a distinct form of cell death which is not apoptotic as confirmed by the lack of increase in the sub-G1 DNA content, PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation. Cell cycle analysis in A549 cells, following MNU-induced DNA damage, revealed a DNA repair-dependent prolonged G2/M arrest accompanied by gradual degradation of cdc25A and hnRNP B1 induction at a later stage, both markers implying aberrant mitosis. The differential effect of MNU on the above cell lines is attributed to their different p53 status. The mechanism of MNU-induced cell death and the effect of histone hyperacetylation on it is currently under investigation.

Results: E2 suppresses the expression of ERa in MCF-7 cells and enhances the expression of ERb in both cell lines. Furthermore, E2 upregulates the expression of syndecan-2 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and down-regulates the expression of syndecan-4 in both cell lines.

However, other functions of TMC such as growth control have yet to be characterized. Here we investigated the effects of TMC on the cellular proliferation and transformation. The consequences of TMC exposure on proliferation and transformation of various cell types were investigated related with the regulation of p21 Cip/WAF via the extra-cellular regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway.Methods: The effects of TMC on cellular proliferation, cell-cycle progression, and transformation were measured by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, fluorescent activating cell sorting (FACS), and foci formation analyses, respectively. The effects of TMC on activations of ERK signaling and p21 Cip/WAF were examined by Western blot, reporter assays, immunocytochemistry, and phosphatase assays. Results: The proliferation and cell cycle progression of HCT-15, HT-29 and DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells were efficiently inhibited by 150 nM TMC. The anti-proliferation by TMC dependent on the ERK pathway dependent p21 Cip/WAF activation, and the TMC effects were abolished in HCT-116 colon and 8 other types of cells which did not induce p21 Cip/WAF by TMC. The crucial role played by p21 Cip/WAF1 in the ERK pathway-dependent anti-proliferative reponses by TMC was confirmed by using p21 Cip/WAF1 gene deleted HCT-116 cells. The TMC preferentially inhibited phosphatase activities of the Raf-1 regulators, PP1 and PP2A, with preference toward PP1. Conclusions: TMC impedes proliferation and transformation of colorectal cancer cells by inhibiting PP1 followed by the ERK pathway dependent p21 Cip/WAF activation.

Methods: Compounds were isolated from Canary Islands\u00b4s endemic plants. We used HL-60, U937 and cells over-expressing human Bcl-2 and Bcl-x L proteins. Cytotoxicity was analyzed by colorimetric MTT assay. Apoptotic cell death rate was analyzed by fluorescent microscopy and by flow cytometry. Morphological changes were evaluated by electron microscopy. Cytochrome-c release, cleavage of procaspases, hydrolysis of PARP and activation of the mitogen-activated-protein kinases (MAPK) pathway were evaluated by western blot. Results: The SL were cytotoxic and potent apoptotic inducers. SLinduced cell death is mediated by caspase activation, since it was prevented by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, associated with cytochrome-c release and triggered in Bcl-2 over-expressing U937 cells and Bcl-x L over-expressing HL-60 cells. Treatment with SL induced the activation of MAPK-pathway, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinases/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPK) and p38 MAPK.

Methods: The APL blasts from leukemia patients and NB4 cells were cotreated with AF and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) at suboptimal concentration. The HL-60 cells were treated with AF and subeffective dose of 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1,25(OH) 2 vit D 3 ] in combination. The effect of AF was investigated on histone acetylation at the promoter of differentiation-associated genes and expression of cell cycle regulators. Results: Treatment with AF and ATRA cooperatively induced granulocytic differentiation of fresh APL blasts isolated from patients and NB4 cells. The combined treatment also increased reorganization of nuclear PML body and the histone acetylation at promoter of RARb2 gene. The AF also promoted monocytic differentiation of the HL-60 cells triggered by subeffective concentration of 1,25(OH) 2 vit D 3 . The combined treatment of AF and 1,25(OH) 2 vit D 3 stimulated the histone acetylation at p21 promoter and increased the accumulation of cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase. Consistent with this, the expressions of p21, p27 and PTEN were increased and the levels of cyclin A, Cdk2 and Cdk4 were decreased. Furthermore, the hypophosphorylated form of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) was markedly increased in cotreated cells. Conclusions: These findings indicate that AF in combination with low doses of either ATRA or 1,25(OH) 2 vit D 3 promotes APL cell differentiation by enhancing histone acetylation and the expression of differentiation-associated genes.",

This destabilization of HIF-1a is resulted from the antioxidant activity of melatonin against ROS induced hypoxia. Moreover, melatonin suppressed the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 under hypoxia, leading to a decrease in the expression of VEGF. Melatonin also blocked in vitro tube formation, invasion and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced by hypoxia-stimulated conditioned media of HCT116. These findings suggest that melatonin could play pivotal roles in tumor suppression via the inhibition of HIF-1-mediated angiogenesis.

The aim of the study was to characterize the effects of chronic NO synthase (NOS) inhibition on the alterations of regulatory proteins of intracellular signaling pathways (mitogen activated protein kinases and Akt kinase cascades) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Methods: NO deficiency (NOD) in rats was induced by L-NAME treatment (40/mg/rat daily, 4 weeks). Levels and specific phosphorylation (activation) of proteins were determined by Western blot analysis and activities of MMP were analyzed by zymography. Results: The development of NOD was connected with decreased activation of both Akt kinase and extracellular signaling regulated protein kinases (ERKs), down-regulation of aFGF and H-Ras protein levels. The changes in ERK and Akt kinase correlated with decreased activation of eNOS and down-regulation of iNOS levels. Activities of tissue and plasma MMP-2 were decreased in L-NAME treated rat hearts. Gelatinolytic activity of approximately 20 kDa proteinase in plasma of L-NAME treated rats was increased. Conclusions: The observed changes point to the involvement of ERK and Akt kinase cascades as well as MMP-2 in responses of rat myocardium to NOD.

Tsoukatos Department of Chemistry, Sector of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, GREECEObjective: The platelet-specific integrin aIIbb3, via 'inside-out' and 'outside-in' signalling, plays a major role on platelet function. The aim of the present study was to contribute to the evaluation of the role of the acidic C-terminal region of the aIIb intracellular tail on platelet activation and aggregation. Methods: For the above purpose we examined the functional effects on human platelets of a palmitoylated peptide corresponding to the above amino acid motif, palmitoyl-K-LEEDDEEGE (pal-K-1000-1008). Results: Pal-K-1000-1008, was platelet permeable and inhibited platelet aggregation induced by 0.4 U of thrombin (IC50 = 164 lM). The non palmitoylated analog was inactive. A modified, scrambled acidic peptide (palmitoyl-K-GDDEELEEE), showed significant lower inhibitory activity than pal-K-1000-1008. A palmitoylated peptide corresponding to the membrane proximal cytoplasmic domain of aIIb, 989 KGVFFKR 995 (pal-K-989-995) induced platelet aggregation. Pal-K-1000-1008 was an inhibitor of human washed platelet aggregation induced by pal-K-989-995 (IC50 = 15 lM). Pal-K-1000-1008 inhibited phosphorylation of FAK and ERK, two protein tyrosine kinases involved in platelet activation and aggregation. Conclusions: Our results favour the assumption that the interaction of the membrane proximal sequence 989 KGVFFKR 995 of the intracellular domain of aIIb with the acidic terminal 1000 LEEDDEEGE 1008 motif may be an important structural factor in platelet signaling, leading to platelet activation and aggregation.",

After incubation with maleimide derivate proliferative activity of cell lines was depressed, cell morphology was changed, subsequently cells detached and died. Subsequent incubations without MI-1 leads to partial recovery of cells morphology but cells growth remain oppressed. At the same time MI-1 does not influence on cell viability and morphology of normal endothelium cells after 3-days incubation.

Since al effects of IL-17 on hematopoietic cells is not absolutely understudying, we here analyzed its effects on new cell line, entitled PC-MDS, obtained from patients with therapy related myelodisplastic syndrome. Methods: IL-17 effects where estimated by different methods as well as on diverse intracellular levels, after in-vitro treatment of PC-MDS cells in dose and time depending manner. Cell membrane alteration was analyzed by release of the cytosole enzyme (LDH) in supernate in terms of the total intracellular activity, calculated as percentage cell membrane alterations; the total intracellular metabolism after cell sonication by ultrasound; the cell growth by estimation of the total protein mass, measurements by SRB assay and cell proliferation by MTT assay. Additionally we analyzed cell cycle phase before and after treatment with IL-17 after 24, 48 and 72 hour by the Flow cytometry. Results: IL-17 induced significantly release of intracellular enzymes trough cell membrane with predominance of LDH in a dose and time dependent manner (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test). The maximal effects on cell death correlated with the cell growth inhibition and decrease of intracellular protein content. Conclusion: Inhibition of cell growth simultaneously with release of cytosole enzymes and loss of energy, analyzed in our study, suggest the role of IL-17 as molecules with capability to induce necrotic and apoptotic form of cell death in our cells.",

The delivery efficiency was detected by flow cytometry. Inhibition of tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence-imaging system, with measurement of cytokines and phenotyping of infiltrating lymphocytes in tumors.Results: Increased immune cell infiltration and induction of apoptosis were noted after treatment with IL-27 plus rBCG DNA vaccines. Combination therapy with IL-27 and rBCG resulted in the highest longterm (>90 days) tumor-free survival frequency of 85%. Animals that were tumor-free demonstrated tumor-specific protection after rechallenge with MBT-2 cells. IL-27 alone and rBCG alone both delayed tumor progression, but only IL-27 plus rBCG significantly augmented long-term survival (80%) compared to the control group. At peak expansion, the combination treatment resulted in a 2-to 3-fold higher absolute number of circulating tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells than was stimulated by IL-27 or rBCG alone.

Deregulation of cytokine secretion occurs in IBD patient intestinal tissue. Antioxidants down-regulate the cytokine synthesis in response to appropriate stimuli with the involvement of MAP-kinases (MAPK). Therefore, considering that GSH levels decrease in intestinal mucosa of IBD patients (i) we have evaluated the role of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK in the redox regulation of the production of IL-6 and IL-8 in a human intestinal myofibroblast cell line, 18Co, stimulated with pro-inflammatory factors. Methods: 18Co cells were stimulated for 24 hour with inflammatory factors in different experimental conditions and the culture medium was used to assay IL-6 and IL-8 by ELISA Kits. GSH levels were measured by HPLC method. Results: Redox regulation of interleukin secretion in stimulated cells has been demonstrated. In fact, the decrease in GSH levels by treatment with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) induced an increased production of IL-8 and IL-6; on the contrary the simultaneous removal of BSO and N-acetylcysteine addition restored the normal synthesis of interleukins. The inhibition of MAPK pathways abrogated the increased release of interleukins in GSH depleted and stimulated cells. Conclusions: These results show that the low GSH levels previously measured in the intestinal mucosa of IBD patients are related to increased cytokine production induced by MAPK activation. This event can be responsible of chronic inflammation and relapses.Reference: 1. Iantomasi T, et al., Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1994; 53: 87-91.

It is well known that H. pylori infection causes the activation of some signaling molecules such as GrbB2, Src family kinases in gastric cancer, however the effect of infection on wnt signaling pathway components in gastric carcinoma is not investigated. In this study, we aimed to examine the changes in expression of six members of FZD genes which are FZD1, FZD2, FZD3, FZD4, FZD8, and FZD10 after H. pylori infection.

In order to determine anticoagulant effects of LMW GM anti-IIa and anti-Xa amidolytic activities were measured. Biospecific electrophoresis in 1% agarose with protamin sulphate was used for LMW GM/sulfate protamin complexes determination. Precipitation zones in the 'rocket' form were generated. The 'rocket' squares estimated with the help of PhotoM program. LMW GM weight MW 12.6; 54.2; 81.9; 132.3; 200.1; 245.6 kD demonstrated anti-IIa activity from 64 IU/mg to 87 IU/mg, anti-Xa activity from 6.8 IU/mg to 13.0 IU/mg. Any connection between MW and anticoagulant activities it is not revealed. LMW GM derivatives produced a concentration-dependent prolongation activated partial thromboplastin time test and thrombin time test. All from obtained LMW GM created complexes with sulphate protamin. It was observed moderate positive connection between height/square of the precipitation zones and antithrombin activity. LMW GM drivatives were obtained with the enzyme comlex hydrolisis help have specific antithrombin activity more 70 IU/mg, that is necessary for antithrombotic preparations. The height/square of the precipitation zones with sulphate protamin were found to increase with increasing antithrombin activity of LMW GM.Acknowledgements: This work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Researches, Grants 05-04-08100-fr-, 05-03-32883-a, 06-04-08140-ofr.

Although several viruses, including tobacco mosaic virus, potato virus X and cowpea mosaic virus, have been developed as vectors, we aimed to develop a new viral vaccine delivery system, a bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV), that carries larger transgene loads, and generates better immunity in the target animals with fewer adverse environmental effects. Methods: We engineered the BaMV as a vaccine vector expressing the antigenic epitope(s) of the capsid protein VP1 of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). The recombinant BaMV plasmid (pBVP1) was constructed by replacing DNA encoding the 35 N-terminal amino acid residues of the BaMV coat protein with that encoding 37 amino acid residues (T128-N164) of FMDV VP1. Results: The pBVP1 infected host plants and generated a chimeric virion BVP1 expressing VP1 epitopes in its coat protein. Immunization of swine with BVP1 virions resulted in the production of anti-FMDV neutralizing antibodies and VP1-specific IFN-c. Furthermore, all BVP1-immunized swine were protected against FMDV challenge. Conclusions: Chimeric BaMV virions that express partial sequence of FMDV VP1 effectively induced not only humoral and cell-mediated immune responses but also full protection against FMDV in target animals. This BaMV-based vector technology may be applied to other vaccines that require correct expression of antigens on chimeric viral particles.

Methods: C32 melanoma cells were maintained in culture in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After treatment with different concentrations of anthocyans, the whole extract was used in biochemical analyses. Total superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase assays were performed on cell supernatants. Lactate dehydrogenase assay was performed on media removed from cells after treatment. Protein concentrations were measured according to the Bradford method. Results: Our results show that: (i) the rich extract of anthocyans has a cytotoxic action in a dose-time dependent manner in the cell line used, (ii) in C32 melanoma cells, a detoxification process at 24 hours of exposure occurred, indicated by GST and GR level elevation, (iii) anthocyans treatment of C32 melanoma cells decreased the total SOD specific activity, which means that the antioxidant capacity of these was diminished and (iv) anthocyans interfered with the antioxidant capacity of C32 melanoma cells, which could have consequences on their viability.

Methods: The new compounds are prepared in four stages beginning with the 2-phenoxymethyl-benzoic R1-substituted acids synthesis, then the aforementioned acid chlorides, the synthesis of N-(2-diethylaminoethyl)-anilines and finally the original amides synthesis. The antimicrobial activity was tested against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungal strains (Candida albicans). All tests were performed comparatively with reference strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATTC 25923, Escherichia coli ATTC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Candida albicans ATCC 10321. The qualitive screening of the susceptibility spectra was performed by three adaptated diffusion methods: paper filter disk impregnation with the tested substances solutions, the disposal of tested solutions in agar wells and the spotting of tested solutions on solid medium seeded with microbial inoculums. The in vitro antimicrobial testing was performed by binary microdilution method, in 96 multi-well plates, in order to establish the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results: The new amides structures and purity were determined using the elemental analysis, TLC methods and IR, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra.All tested compounds exhibited variable antibacterial and antifungal activities, with low MICs against C. albicans and Gram -positive bacteria (especially on S. aureus).Conclusion:The new compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity showing a good activity against C. albicans and S. aureus. Thus, they represent new possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of infections with these microorganisms.PP8B-4Nanoparticle-based DNA biosensor for SNP genotyping. Application to pharmacogenetic analysis D. K. Toubanaki 1 , T. K. Christopoulos 1,2 , P. C. Research and Technology Hellas-Institute of Chemical Engineering and High Temperature Chemical Processes (FORTH/ICE-HT), Patras, GREECE, 3 Department of Chemistry, University of Athens, Athens, GREECE, 4 School of Medicine, University of Crete, Heraklion, GREECE Introduction: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) constitute the most common form of variation in the human genome. In recent years, there is a continuously increasing interest in the development of simple, robust, rapid and low cost methods for SNP genotyping. We have developed a nanoparticle-based DNA biosensor, which allows visual genotyping of SNP without using specialized equipment. Methods: The genotyping method comprises three steps. (i) PCR amplification of a segment spanning the SNP of interest. (ii) Oligonucleotide ligation reaction using a biotinylated common probe and an allele-specific probe that carries a (dA) 20 segment. (iii) Detection of ligation products by the DNA biosensor. Gold nanoparticles functionalized with oligo(dT) strands are deposited, in dry form, on the conjugate pad of the biosensor. The ligation product is captured by immobilized streptavidin at the test zone of the biosensor and hybridizes with the oligo(dT) strands of the nanoparticles. A characteristic red line is generated due to the accumulation of nanoparticles. The excess nanoparticles are captured by immobilized oligo(dA) at the control zone of the strip, giving a second red line. Results: We have applied the proposed method to the genotyping of SNPs in the genes of drug-metabolizing enzymes, i.e. CYP2D6 (*3, *4) and CYP2C19 (*2, *3). The results were in full agreement with direct sequencing. Conclusions: The advantage of the proposed biosensor is its simplicity. The dry-reagent format minimizes the pipetting steps. Visual genotyping with no need for instrumentation decreases the cost and the need for highly qualified technical personnel. Nanospheres of carbon, known as fullerenes have attracted attention due to their applications in biomedicine. The studies regarding fullerenes and their derivatives are nowadays focused especially on their antitumoral and pharmacological effects. Photochemical activation of some types of fullerenes contributes to the antitumoral effects and defines their dual nature. Before heading towards clinical studies, toxicological aspects must be evaluated as there it is still insufficient data in the field of nanostructure's effects on the biological systems[1]. Our study is focused on the toxicological profiles of synthetic C60 fullerens functionalized with tetra-phenyl-porphyne-Fe (Fe-TPP) and tetra-phenyl-porphynepolyvnyl pirolidone (TPP-PVP), respectively. Methods: The synthetic fullerenes were tested on human standard lymphoblast K562 cell line (ATCC collection). The cellular viability was investigated by CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega). The proliferative capacity was evaluated as metabolically active cells number -CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation kit (Promega). Results: The viability of K562 cell line loaded with synthetic fullerenes is not affected compared to unloaded cells, especially in the case of C60 fullerene functionalized with TPP-PVP in a wide range of concentration. Also, we noticed an antiproliferative tendency in the case of C60 functionalized with TPP-PVP. Conclusions: Both functionalized fullerenes display no 'dark' toxicity on K562 leukemia cell line. We have registered a protective effect upon cell membrane integrity correlated with a slight antiproliferative tendency. Toxicological data will be used for further testing the compounds in photochemical activation experiments.Reference: 1. Panchapakesan, Oncology Issues Nov/Dec 2005; 20-23.

In other cases, a low expression of p16 gene in tumoral cells was correlated with a low expression of rb gene and an increased expression of p53 gene. By decreasing the p16 expression, the level of Rb protein is affected also at the transcriptional and at the phosphorylation level, leading to an increased cell proliferation. At this moment, the patients are under medical surveillance.Conclusions: Although P53 and Rb proteins are functional correlated, at the transcriptional level there is no correlation between their expression, in tumoral cells.

Among these compounds, peptide antibiotics constitute the predominant class. Bacilysin, one of the simplest peptide antibiotics known in B. subtilis, is composed of N terminal L-alanine and C terminal L-anticapsin. In recent studies, the ywfBC-DEF genes were shown to carry biosynthetic core function genes and renamed as bacABCDE. In addition to this polycistronic operon (ywfBCDEFG), a monocistronic gene ywfH was shown to be required for the biosynthesis of bacilysin in B. subtilis 168. Very recently, our research group showed that a novel gene yvfI, which encodes a transcriptional repressor protein, belonging to GntR family repressor proteins, is essential for the bacilysin biosynthesis. Methods: In this study, we aimed to determine whether yvfI null mutation effect the expression of ywfH gene. Following this respect, firstly the expression pattern of ywfH was examined through contsruct-This study offers an essential step in determining the global regulatory role of yvfI gene, showing the effects of yvfI null mutation on the expression profile of ywfH gene. Results showed a strong ZmIGF/insulin mitogenic effect on maize calli. They revealed a role of TOR-S6K pathway on maize cell growth and proliferation, that involves translational control of key proteins required for these events.

Visfatin is one of adiponectins, so-called cytokins, produced by visceral fat. It is also known as cytokin produced by lymphocytes to support maturation of pre-B cells, It is called pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF). Gene for PBEF is in man localizated on chromosome 7q22.2 and code protein of 52 kDa. Visfatin has several biological functions also via regulation of NAD level. Visfatin induces acummulation of triacylglycerols (TAG) in preadipocytes and enhances TAG synthesis from glucose. Tissue culture of mouse preadipocytes 3T3-L1 and rat hepatocytes Fao were selected for our studies. Visfatin was in vitro released into cultivation media. New method of RNAi was used for specific knocdown of gene visfatin. In western blots with specific immunodetection we have found decrease level of visfatin protein after RNA interference experiments. Protein extract from cell lysate characterized by two-dimensional electrophoresis has revealed differences between transfected and control hepatocytes. MALDI-TOF analysis of selected protein spots from two-dimensional gels revealed absence of selected proteins under RNAi knockdown of visfatin.Two-dimensional gels were also compared by Image Master 2D Platinum program. New method for determination of visfatin enzymatic activity has been designed based on HPLC analysis in the presence of visfatin preparation from cell culture. Decrease uptake of 14 C-glucose was apparent in differentiated transfected hepatocytes. Transcriptional silencing in cancer by CpG island methylation of genes that contain miRNAs can down-regulate the expression of the miRNAs as well while up-regulating mRNA expression, classifying both as tumour suppressors. We have mapped several miRNAs inside the introns of putative tumour suppressor genes and have observed down-regulation in cancer cell lines compared to the non invasive counterpart, and in cancer cell lines compared to the drug resistant counterpart, once again classifying both as tumour suppressors. Furthermore, this down-regulation appears to be due at least in part, to CpG island methylation.Conclusions: This work permitted us to identify new miRNAs and new genes that are silenced in cancer due to an epigenetic event.Introduction: Recent findings show that RNA molecules of various sizes and shapes participate in",

Here we present the first data on the role of ERI1 in the regulation of RNA silencing in plants.Methods: Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated leaf disc transformation was used to generate Nicotiana benthamiana lines stably suppressing and overexpressing the plant ERI1 ortholog. An ERI1 suppressor line was crossed with line GFP 5.3 generated in our lab (1) which has the characteristic to exhibit spontaneous short-range silencing of a GFP transgene without the occurrence of subsequent systemic GFP silencing. In addition the effect of ERI1 transient overexpression on small RNA species was tested. Results: In the progeny this resulted in systemic GFP silencing in close to 100% of all plants, possibly by allowing siRNA levels to exceed a threshold concentration. Stable ERI1 overexpression resulted in multiple phenotypic alterations, with defects including growth delay, disturbance of the photosynthetic apparatus including chloroplast morphology, and leaf deformations. These phenotypes are positively correlated with ERI1 overexpression levels. In addition, ERI1 overexpression negatively affected the concentration of small RNA species detected in the tissue analysed.S. Khan, A. Gardiner, I. Martinez, A. Boster, R. Ferris and R.

Conclusion: Expression of mature let-7a should be further evaluated as a prognostic factor in NSCLC. The miRNA had either positive or negative impact on seed germination of the plants depending on stress conditions. Overexpression of miR414 promoted the growth and development of Arabidopsis plants. Promoter-GUS analysis revealed that miR406 is expressed at low levels by its own promoter. Target genes for each miRNA were determined by Northern and RT-PCR analyses.Conclusions: These results suggest that a particular type of miRNAs perform a different function in the responses of plants to changing environmental conditions. These results imply that posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by miRNAs is an important strategy for plants to adapt to various stress conditions. Infection of cell lines with SFV.PD-EGFP resulted in strong expression of EGFP in >70% of the cells. Double infection of the cell lines with SFV.PD-EGFP and SFV.pd.sh-EGFP resulted in silencing of the EGFP protein expression to a level of 20-30% of the initial intensity. Infection of cell lines that stably express EGFP with SFV.PD.sh-EGFP resulted to inhibition of the EGFP protein expression both in terms of cell numbers and in the intensity of the expression. Conclusions: We have successfully used SFV.PD vector to mediate GFP knockdown by the overexpression of short hairpin RNA.Introduction: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs play a substantial role in mammary gland development and breast cancer tumorgenesis.Very recently, overexpression of miR-10b was found to initiate robust invasion and metastasis in otherwise non-metastatic breast tumors.

Further protein engineering both in silico and in vitro will improve the understanding of rules of this pathogen lectin behavior. While all pyrazoles could bind to both ER subtypes, certain showed a bias towards ERb. A subset of these pyrazoles was also shown to behave as full ERb antagonists while exhibiting marginal ERa antagonist properties. The ER subtype selective agonist/antagonist behaviour was modulated by the cycloalkyl ring fused to the pyrazole core. The ERb antagonistic pyrazoles inhibited estrogen and androgen stimulation of growth of LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Conclusions: Development of subtype selective ERb antagonists is a useful tool for deciphering the ligand structure requirements of ERb-selective antagonism as well as for studying the role of ERb in prostate cancer chemoprevention.

With the use of isoform-specific RT-PCR we have mapped the expression of KIF1Bb in the CNS of adult mice as well as during embryonic development.By using a GAL4-based yeast-two-hybrid system to screen an adult human brain cDNA library, we identified calmodulin as an interacting partner of KIF1Bb. By pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation we verified this interaction and also mapped the calmodulin binding site in a region close to the carboxy-terminal tail KIF1Bb.Immunofluorescence experiments with mouse neuroblastoma NSC-34 cells revealed that KIF1Bb is localized to synaptic vesicles and this localization is dependent on its interaction with calmodulin.

The Starmaker (Stm) was the first protein shown to be capable of influencing on the process of biomineralization of otoliths. Stm dictates the shape, size and selection of calcium carbonate polymorph, in a concentration-dependent manner.Methods: The Stokes radius Stm was determined by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 GL column and by dynamic light scattering. Native discontinuous PAGE at different concentrations of acrylamide was performed to estimate an native MW for Stm. MW for Stm was also determined by ESI-MS. Stm secondary structure content was probed with circular dichroism. Results: The identity of purified recombinant non-tagged Stm was confirmed by ESI MS showing MW of 64498 \u00b1 2 Da. Subsequent gel filtration and dynamic light scattering experiments revealed extended conformation of Stm in solution, showing Stokes radius of 78.6 \u00c5 , which is much higher than expected for a globular protein of the molecular mass of Stm. Monomeric state for Stm was confirmed by native PAGE showing MW of 60 kDa. Circular dichroism revealed low content of secondary structures for Stm. Conclusions: A biochemical and biophysical analysis of the recombinant Stm indicate for the first time that the Stm is monomeric protein that exhibits properties of intrinsically disordered proteins.

Thereupon inhibition of XO activity could lead to beneficial effects for the treatment of these conditions. In this study, the effect of Cu 2+ on XO activity was investigated. Methods: XO activity was measured by monitoring the formation of uric acid at 295 nm. The pH activity profile was established using a citrate-phosphate-borate buffer system (pH 2-13). The effect of Cu 2+ (in 12 concentrations ranging from 0.5 micromolar to 2 millimolar) on XO enzymatic activity as well as XO spectrophotometric properties was investigated at optimum pH after incubation of the enzyme and the metal for 0-10 minutes. Results: Optimum pH was 7.5. Addition of up to 1 micromolar Cu 2+ stimulated XO activity, while higher Cu 2+ concentrations inhibited XO activity. The increases (up to 26%) and decreases (up to 60% in 1.5 millimolar Cu 2+ and 100% in 2 millimolar Cu 2+ ) in catalytic efficiency were both time-and metal concentration-dependent. The type of inhibition was noncompetitive. Cu 2+ concentrations above 500 micromolar resulted in a red shift in the aromatic amino acids band maximum (from 277 to 305 nm) and a significant decrease in absorption.Conclusions: This study showed that Cu 2+ induced conformational changes in XO and, at low concentrations (up to 1 micromolar) stimulated the enzymatic activity while at higher concentrations, it inhibited the enzymatic activity which was completely abolished at 2 millimolar.K.

Hamodrakas Department of Cell Biology and Biophysics, Faculty of Biology, University of Athens, Athens 157 01 GREECE Introduction: Computational prediction of signal peptides and their cleavage sites is of great importance in computational biology. However, currently, there is no available method capable of predicting reliably the signal peptides of Archaea, due to the limited amount of experimentally verified proteins with signal peptides. Methods: We performed an extensive literature search in order to identify archaeal proteins having an experimentally verified signal peptide in order to evaluate the performance of various top-scoring signal peptide predictors (SignalP, PrediSi, Phobius). Results: We found 68 sequences, the largest number ever reported. A detailed analysis revealed some unique features of the signal peptides of Archaea, such as the unique amino-acid composition of the h-region with a higher than expected occurrence of Isoleucine, and a c-region resembling better the Gram-positives' sequences. As expected from these findings, prediction methods that are trained on Gram-positive bacteria perform better in correctly identifying the archaeal signal peptides. SignalPv3 performs better compared to SignalPv2, PrediSi and Phobius. Furthermore, the widely used practice of using a consensus of different predictors trained on sets of various organism groups, results in missing approximately 25-50% of the experimentally verified signal peptides. Conclusions: We provided for the first time a comprehensive analysis of archaeal signal peptides, based on experimentally verified signal peptides. We show here that archaeal signal peptides resemble better the respective sequences of Gram-positive bacteria, and thus, the respective predictors are performing better. However, a dedicated predictor trained solely on archaeal sequences is needed.V. Iconomidou and S.

Fanconi cells are highly sensitive to DNA crosslinking agents but their response to ionizing radiation is still unclear. This aimed us to investigate in vitro cellular radiosensitivity of FA cell lines (eight patients) and corresponing controls (six samples) employing enumeration of c-H2AX foci. Cells were irradiated in exponential growth phase using 60 Co gamma-rays, radiation dose of 2 Gy. Quantification of gamma-H2AX was assessed at various period of time after irradiation (30 minutes, 2 hours, 5 hours and 24 hours after irradiation). The mean value of DSBs/cell in unirradiated control fibroblasts was 1.17 \u00b1 0.43, wheras in unirradiated FA cells DSBs/cell was 3.0 \u00b1 2.13. The maximum of induced DSBs/cell was found 30 minutes after irradiation in both study groups (20.38 \u00b1 3.76 in control, 21.99 \u00b1 4.12 in FA cells, respectively). The level of radiation-induced gamma-H2AX foci in FA cells, 2 and 5 hours after irradiation significantly decrease when compared to controls, whereas after 24 hours FA cells have significantly higher level of DSBs/cell In FA cells. Numerous necrotic nuclei were found at recovery time of 2 and 5 hours, whereas at longer recovery period of time (24 hours) gamma-H2AX positive micronuclei were found. This study have shown that in FA cells repair mechanisms operate very inefficiently, leading to elevated apoptosis and micronuclei in growing cell cultures. c-H2AX foci represents very sensitive assay for estimation of intrinsic genome radiosenitivity, and demonstrate clear difference in behavior of FA and normal cells in response to ionizing radiation.R. Jordanova, E. Kostova, M. Groves and P. Tucker European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Outstation Hamburg, Hamburg, GERMANY Introduction: Lipid binding proteins (LBPs) play an important role in parasitic nematode's limited lipid metabolism. Several structurally novel families of LBPs in nematodes have been described, including the fatty acid and retinoid binding protein family (FAR). So far there is no 3D structure of any FAR protein. In C. elegans, used as a model for studying parasitic nematodes, eight Ce-FAR proteins have been described. Here we report our work on Ce-FAR-7, one of the most distinct members of the FAR family. Methods: For the crystallization experiment recombinant His-tagged Ce-FAR-7 has been purified via several chromatographic steps and saturated with palmitate. Since there is no model to allow the Ce-FAR-7 structure to be obtained by molecular replacement, isomorphous replacement and anomalous dispersion methods were employed, using sulfur atoms, heavy metals (Hg), Brions and crystals of selenomethionine-containing (Se-Met) protein. All data were collected using synchrotron radiation. Results: Native crystals diffract to 2.4 \u00c5 and the Se-Met crystals diffract to 3 \u00c5 . Space group is P21  2 1 2 1 with a = 32 b = 43 c = 102 \u00c5 and a solvent content of 45.9%. For the Hg soaked crystals the space group is P2 1 with a = 34 b = 42 c = 48 \u00c5 and beta = 74 with a solvent content of 40%. Conclusion: We report the first crystallization and X-ray analysis of a FAR protein and the ongoing structure determination.

Yohda 1 Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, JAPAN, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, JAPAN, 3 Institute for Molecular Science, JAPAN, 4 Nagoya University, Nagoya, JAPAN Introduction: Group II chaperonins exist in the archaeal and eukaryotic cytosol, and mediate protein folding in an ATP-dependent manner. Previous studies have shown that ATP drives the conformational change of group II chaperonins from the open-lid, substrate binding conformation to the closed-lid conformation to encapsulate unfolded protein in the central cavity. Since the lid is constituted by helical protrusions of eight subunits in a ring, its close and open should require cooperative action of them. However, the detailed mechanism of their cooperativity is still unknown. To elucidate this issue, we examined effects of existence of helical protrusion-deleted mutant (helical, 245-276) in the ordered fashion on the folding and conformational change ability of Thermococcus chaperonin complexes. Methods and Results: Chaperonin complexes including helicals could not fold denatured proteins and conformational change from open structure to closed structure wasn't observed by SAXS analysis. Interestingly, protease digestion, and fluorescent polarization assay have shown ATP-dependent motion of the lid of subunit. Conclusions: These results suggest that ATPs binding/hydrolysis to subunits promotes the motion of the lid of subunit independently, and subsequently the interaction between neighbouring helical protrusions in the ring induces the closed structure. length Alzheimer's amyloid-B peptide in vitro A.

Au 1 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biotechnology Program, Centre for Protein Science and Crystallography, Faculty of Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, 2 Department of Microbiology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong SARHelicobacter pylori is the causative agent of duodenal ulcer, gastritis and gastric cancer. Around 50% of the world population has been infected with H. pylori. Motility and chemotaxis are important virulence factors for H. pylori infection. FliM, FliN and FliG compose switch protein complex that is essential for flagella biosynthesis and motility. The binding of phosphorylated CheY to the complex controls the direction of flagella rotation. Adherence of H. pylori to gastric epithelial cells is reduced in fliM mutant suggesting that the motor switch complex is crucial in gastric infection. To investigate the molecular structure of FliM from H. pylori, we have generated the soluble fragment of FliM M based on the solved structure of FliM M from Thermotoga maritima. Rod shaped crystals of FliM M were obtained. A 2.2\u00c5 structure of FliM M was determined by molecular replacement, and refined to R = 0.213, R free = 0.256. Comparison of the FliM M structure from H. pylori with T. martima will be discussed. Besides, identification of residues important FliM-FliG interaction is being analyzed by mutagenesis study.

We have investigated Plantaricin analogues, their action on different bacteria/fungi species and their interaction with biomimetic membrane systems. Methods: Peptide synthesis was performed on solid phase (Fmoc chemistry) and purified by reverse phase in HPLC. Pln149-biomimetic systems interactions were investigated by CD, fluorescence, adsorption kinetics, surface elasticity, and microorganism growth inhibition assays. Results: Pln149 presented unordered structure in aqueous solution and when incubated with zwiterionic or positive liposomes, but underwent a conformational change to helix element with negative liposomes. Adsorption kinetics of Pln149 on DPPG monolayers showed that up to 6 lg/ml the peptide promotes a strong decrease in surface tension and disrupts the monolayer. Pln149 has bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus with MIC values of 156 lM and 78 lM, respectively, and inhibited C. albicans and S. cerevisae growth. Conclusions: Pln149 is attracted to negative membrane surfaces, undergoes an amphipathic a-helix induction and plays its role disrupting lipid bilayers as a detergent mimetic mechanism. Similar mechanisms were observed to the other analogues, but with different binding constants. Acknowledgement: Supported by Brazilian Agencies: FAPESP and CNPq.B. C. Mallick, J.-S. Kim and S.-O.

The mechanism of Ca 2+ -binding and the conformational changes is important and need to be address. We investigated the conformational changes and the structural stability induced upon Ca 2+ -binding to the protein at studied conditions. Methods: The coding region of CAF-1 was amplified by PCR, cloned to pET-15b-expression vector and expressed in E. coli as His-fusion protein. The protein conformational changes and thermal stability were monitored by using fluorescence and circular dichroism. The binding isotherms of Ca 2+ -CAF-1 were monitored by Isothermal Titration Calorimeter (ITC). Results: The stochiometric titration of [Ca 2+ ]/[CAF-1] binding showed 50% of the signal changes at a ratio equivalent to the binding sites in the protein. The thermal denaturation of apo-and holo-CAF-1 monitored by circular dichroism and the thermodynamics parameters obtained have good correlation to explain the protein stability. The stability against chemical denaturation was found to be Ca 2+ -ion dependant. The comparative binding of hydrophobic probe (ANS) to apo-and holo-CAF-1 indicates the conformational changes. The stability of the protein-Ca 2+ -binding interaction parameters were obtained by ITC experiments.Conclusions: The Ca 2+ -dependence conformational changes and stability of CAF-1 under physiological conditions helps to understand the mechanisms that required Ca 2+ -ions during the life cycle of D. discoideum. terminal domain of DsbD obtained by NMR spectroscopy D.

Evdokimov and N. V. Kotova Institute of Protein Research, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow Region, RUSSIAWe have studied carboanhydrase B, a protein whose folding is complicated by the formation of three intermediate states. The main problem that arises when studying such complex proteins is what forces and interactions affect every stage of formation of their native structure.Here we analyze such influence of hydrophobic amino acids with a great number of contacts. Having measured the kinetics of folding/ unfolding of wild-type carboanhydrase B, its energy landscape, i.e. the location of all energy levels and heights of barriers between them, are calculated. This has allowed us using phi-analysis in studying mutant proteins and estimating the contribution of the mutating amino acid to the formation of every intermediate state. Aliphatic amino acids with a great number of contacts have been selected. We have measured the kinetics of folding and unfolding of three mutant proteins, in which amino acids L155, I208 and M221were substituted for alanine, using tryptophane fluorescence. Dependences of logarithm of the folding/ unfolding rate versus denaturant concentration (chevron plots) have been plotted. It has been found that the residues studied affect mainly the final slow stages of carboanhydrase B unfolding.

Upon challenge for differentiation, MEL-C14 and MEL-C56 cells exhibited alterations in the level of CDKs (CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6) and delayed their entrance in initiation of erythroid differentiation and cell cycle arrest at G 1 /G 0 . Methods: In this study, we explored the question whether RNAimediated silencing of endogenous RPS5 gene expression affects the growth and differentiation of inducer-treated MEL cells. Results: The data obtained thus far indicated that silencing of endogenous RPS5 gene expression interrupts the completion of erythroid differentiation program to occur in vitro. Interesting enough, however, recovery of normal RPS5 gene expression has allowed RNAi-treated parental MEL cells to complete their differentiation program at rates similar to that seen in untreated highly-inducible parental MEL cell cultures. Conclusions: These findings indicate that deregulation of RPS5 gene expression by either stable transfection or RNAi-mediated gene silencing alters the initiation and the onset of erythroid differentiation of MEL cells presumably by affecting cell cycle arrest at G 1 /G 0 and the function of CDKs. However, the precise mechanism(s) underlying the possible link between initiation of erythroid differentiation and changes in RPS5 gene expression is still unclear and needs further investigation.Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation of Research and Technology, Heraklion, GREECE, 2 Department of Chemistry, University of Crete, Heraklion, GREECE, 3 Department of Materials Science and Technolgy, University of Crete, Heraklion, GREECE",

The major source of intracellular ROS in the red cell is autoxidation of oxyhemoglobin, which generates superoxide which through dismutation, produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Degradation of the heme moiety takes place in conjunction with the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with hemoglobin. Methods: Hemoglobin from human, bovine and camel (Arabian and Bacterian) was purified. The content of oxy-, deoxy-and met species were determined. Heme degradation products were identified by spectroscopic and representative fluorescence species. Results: By increasing the level of met hemoglobin, fluorescence products of heme degradation were reduced, in comparison with oxy-and deoxy-Hb species. Conclusions: The source of hemoglobin affects the susceptibility of the heme group against reactive oxygen species which is most probably due to the different microstructure of the heme pocket from various candidate sources.N.

Others indicated that the absence of the GTR1 gene product reduces the capacity of the Pho84 transporter with an impact on the phosphate uptake response. The soluble Gtr1 protein is classified within the Ras family of small GTPbinding proteins. A significant relationship between the general aminoacid transporter (Gap1p) and the Gtr1 protein concerning its role on the activity and plasma membrane trafficking of the transporter has been observed. These types of interactions are still under debate, particularly where Pho84 is involved. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence analyses performed on the wild type protein and specific mutants can provide us with specific data concerning the structural properties of the Gtr1 protein in either a nucleotide-free or -bound state. Data obtained from pure His-tagged wild type protein reveals a distinct change in fluorescence on interaction with GDP or GTP, compared with the nucleotide-free protein. The GTP hydrolyzing capacity of Gtr1 wild type (intrinsic GTPase activity) was determined by Thin-Layer-Chromatographic assay. Fluorescence measurements point out that Gtr1 undergoes conformational changes upon guanine nucleotide exchange. It is anticipated that the local environment of Trp 60 could be altered upon nucleotide binding due to its proximity to Gtr1's cognate switch II domain. Further fluorescence analysis on Gtr1 mutants will give further insight on the structural dynamic. The TLC assay gives us a tool to further determine the kinetics of the Gtr1 protein.

Remaining is peptides promoting allergic activity. Many allergens are characterized in red imported fire ant (S. invicta) venom. In this study, we characterized an active protein, Sol g II, in S. geminata venom and its antibody production for antivenom development. Methods: Venom collection by capillary method under stereomicroscope. Peptide mass fingerprints (PMF) were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. For paralyzed dose 50 (PD 50 ) assay, sample was injected to cricket, those unable to turnover from overturn position were determined as being paralyzed. Results and Conclusion: Sol g II was the most major band in SDS-PAGE analysis of S. geminata crude venom. It composed of 6 isoforms in 2D-PAGE profiles. After PMF analysis, it showed high similarity to Sol i II. N-terminal sequencing revealed 90% identity to Sol i II. Anti-Sol g II antibody was raised with high titer (>1:1000). The antibody was able to increase PD 50 of S. geminata venom suggesting of its high potency to accelerate activity of alkaloids and to be used as antigen for antivenom production.H. Thirkettle, J.

Whitaker CRUK Uro -Oncology, Research Group, Department of Oncology, CRUK Cambridge Research Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UKIntroduction: LYRIC has been reported to regulate key components of PI3-kinase and NF-jB pathways involved in tumorigenesis. The localisation of LYRIC is dynamic with its distribution altering with cell polarity, cell type and neoplasia. Different functions have been reported for LYRIC in different cellular locations, hence LYRIC localisation may regulate its function. Methods: Three lysine-rich regions within LYRIC were designated NLS-1, -2 and -3 and cloned into a GFP-tagged vector. The same regions were also deleted from LYRIC. COS cells were transfected with these constructs and their ability to target GFP to the nucleus was determined using confocal imaging and Western blotting. Posttranslational modification of LYRIC by ubiquitin and SUMO was established by immunoprecipitation. Results: The three lysine-rich regions within LYRIC target GFP to the nucleus and nucleolus. NLS-3 is the predominant regulator of nuclear localisation, whereas NLS-1 regulates nucleolar localisation. Using the NLS deletion mutants we have shown that they act cooperatively to regulate LYRIC distribution. NLS-2 is modified by mono-ubiquitination and SUMO and appears to act as a regulatory region. Conclusions: The different NLS regions have different functions in translocating LYRIC to different regions of the nucleus. Only NLS-2 is modified by ubiquitin and SUMO and this may regulate NLS function. We suggest that LYRIC localisation is regulated by a multifactoral process which could be targeted for therapeutic benefit.

Popov 1 Bach Institute of Biochemistry RAS, Moscow, RUSSIA, 2 Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology RAS, Moscow, RUSSIAEight heme cytochrome c nitrite reductase (TvNiR) was isolated from the denitrifying sulfur-oxidizing haloalkaliphilic bacterium Thioalkalivibrio nitratireducens. Catalytic properties were characterized and structure of the TvNiR oxidized form was solved at resolution 1.5 A. It was shown that TvNiR exists in the solution as a stable hexamer containing 48 hemes c per molecule. Despite only about of 20% sequence identity with the structurally characterized five heme cytochrome c nitrite reductases (ccNiRs) the structure of the active site and arrangement of 5 from 8 hemes including catalytic heme have been similar in TvNiR and ccNiRs. Unfortunately TvNiR revealed the maximal activity in nitrite reduction and extremely low activity in sulfite reduction as compared to other ccNiRs. For study the relation between the active site structure and catalytic properties of TvNiR the high resolution structures of TvNiR (oxidized form) complexes with substrates (nitrite and sulfite) and inhibitors (azide and sulfate) were solved. It has been shown that the bond lengths and orientation of the ligands in the TvNiR active site differ from the similar ccNiR complexes, resulted in some dissimilarity in catalytic properties. It is known that reduced forms of ccNiR possesed increased affinity to substrates. Extremely low sulfite reduction activity of TvNiR allowed us to obtain the structure of TvNiR reduced form with substrate -sulfite. Comparative analysis of substrate binding with oxidized and reduced form is carried out.

The archaeal species, on the other hand, possess XPF homodimers with key properties of the XPF/ERCC1 enzymatic activity. Methods: We have used NMR Spectroscopy to determine the structures of the C-terminal XPF/ERCC1 interacting domains and of the socalled central domain of ERCC1, and to address the molecular details of their function in the coordinated nucleolytic activity of the heterodimer. Results: The structural data show that the XPF/ERCC1 interacting domains share the HhH 2 motif of the archaeal XPF counterpart and complex in the same manner as the archaeal species do. In contrast to archaea, however, the human domains are not functionally equal and only ERCC1 HhH 2 domain is involved in DNA binding[1]. The ERCC1 central domain shows again striking structural similarity with the active nuclease domain of the archaeal homodimer. Although the ERCC1 domain is devoid of the conserved catalytic residues and therefore is not active, it has acquired a novel protein-binding function[2]. Conclusions: We discuss the structure-function relationship of the homo-and hetero-versions of the enzyme, which can be unified under an evolutionary concept. That of duplicate genes (and their protein products), which preserved the ancestral 3D fold, but accumulated diverge mutations in different domains, leading to the complementary loss of conserved motifs and selective retention of different aspects of function present in the ancestral non-duplicated enzyme. Such an evolutionary scenario can explain the transformation from homo-to hetero-association and the accompanying differences in XPF repair site targeting strategy.References: 1.

Sakajiri Department of Food and Nutrition, Morioka College, Takizawa, Iwate, JAPAN Serum transferrin (Tf) tightly binds Fe(III), transports it with blood stream and delivers it to the cytosol of iron-requiring cells by receptormediated endocytosis. The iron-binding site can bind various metal ions besides Fe(III). However, only the Fe(III)-Tf complex can be incorporated into the cells by specific interaction with Tf-receptor. In this study, we calculated metal-Tf binding energies for Fe(III), Fe(II), Ga(III), Al(III), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II), employing Gaussian 03 with B3LYP/6-31G** basis set for ab nitio MO calculation. As a result, metal binding energy (-DE) was of the following order: Fe(III) > Ga(III) >> Al(III) > Cu(II) > Zn(II) > Ni(II) > Fe(II). This order had a good correlation with -log K (K: experimental binding constant), giving a correlation coefficient of 0.985. The result showed that the binding of Fe(III) to Tf produced large energy enough to induce the conformational change of the protein for the binding of the Fe(III)-Tf complex to the Tf-receptor. On the iron-Tf complex formation process, although the Fe(II)-Tf complex was much more unstable than the Fe(III)-Tf complex, it was assumed that Fe(II) more rapidly reacted with Tf than Fe(III), because dehydration energy for Fe(II) was smaller than that for Fe(III) enters the circulation from duodenum as Fe(II) through the iron transport protein ferropotin 1. Consequently, it is supposed that the Fe(II)-Tf complex is firstly formed and the bound Fe(II) is subsequently oxidized by hephaestin on the basolateral membrane of enterocyte of duodenum, resulting in the formation of the stable Fe(III)-Tf complex.PP3-88Structural basis for the revalence between bitter taste and pharmacological properties J.

One crucial role of this enzyme in industrial redox chemistry is to regenerate NADH from NAD + -and formate. However, it uses only NAD as a coenzyme. It would be also desirable to regenerate NADPH by using NADP as a coenzyme. Methods: In previous experiments we have enabled cmFDH to use NADP by the single mutation Asp159Ser (1). However, this mutant binds NADP very weakly. In this study, we explore further mutations in the coenzyme binding domain to improve the K M of cmFDH for NADP. Asp195Ala(D195A), Asp195Ser (D195S), Tyr196Arg (Y196R) mutations have been designed separately and together as a double mutant cycle by using Insight II (Accelrys) program on homology model of cmFDH based on Pseudomonas sp.101. Results: The designed mutant proteins are produced and purified. Kinetic studies have been carried out and the results have been compared with the wild type cmFDH protein. Conclusions: The results suggest that the residues in these positions are major determinant of coenzyme specificity in NAD/NADP-dependent dehydrogenases.

The results of CD and fluorescence spectra indicate a conformational change of Hb with addition of silver nanoparticle. The fluorescence data show that the binding of nanoparticle to hemoglobin is occurred in a single binding site, which shows a dynamic quenching procedure. Nanoparticle can reduce the fluorescence of tryptophanyl residues of Hb to a lesser extent. Furthermore, the addition of nanoparticle resulted in the little blue shifts of maximum peak position at different temperatures of 293, 310, and 315 K. Circular dichroism studies indicate a conformational change of hemoglobin in the presence of silver nanoparticle. The helicity of hemoglobin reduces in presence by increasing the concentration of silver nanoparticle at different temperatures. Thermodynamic analysis of the protein interaction by silver nanoparticle suggests that the binding process is only entropy driven.Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, ''Victor Babes'' National Institute of Pathology, Bucharest, ROMANIA, 2 Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, ''Carol Davila'' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, ROMANIA, 3 Clinics of Hematology, University Hospital, Bucharest, ROMANIAMyelodisplasia/myeloproliferative disorders are conditions proved to affect not only leukocytes and erythrocytes, but also thrombocytes function. This report shows changes appearing in the expression of von Willebrand factor receptor (vWFR) of thrombocytes in patients suffering those disorders. The expression of vWFR on platelet surface was assessed by flow cytometry, while total receptor espression was evaluated by western blot using proteins in thrombocyte lysates. Three vWFR subunits (CD42a-c) were immunodetected on PVDF membrane and quantified by densitometry. Results showed significant alterations in expression level of CD42b (decreased by~25%, P < 0.05), while expression levels for CD42a and CD42c, despite lower, proved no statistical significance, by comparison with the levels in thrombocyte lysates of healthy persons. In conclusion, myelodisplasia/myeloproliferative disorders are accompanied by changes in expression level of essential proteins in thrombocyte function, suggesting an impaired function due to an improper stoichiometry of the receptor.Acknowledgment: This study was granted by Ministry of Education and Research of Romania (Research of Excellence Program, CEEX 62/2005).

Numerous studies show modifications of MMPs activity in tumors; especially changes of serum/plasma levels of MMP2 and MMP9 in different carcinoma (mammary, pulmonary, gastric). A good correlation between MMP levels and tumor evolution transforms these enzymes into dual targets -of therapeutic and diagnosis interest. Significant changes (and well correlated) are visible in serum levels of some tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP), mostly for TIMP1 and TIMP2. The objective of this study was the assessment of a set of serum markers -MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, TIMP and CA19.9 in pancreatic cancer patients and the evaluation of their predictive value. Methods: Analysis of MMP1, MMP2, MMP9 and TIMP was done using xMAP array method (Luminex) and CA19.9 levels were determined by ELFA (Bio-Merieux kit) on sample sera from patients with pancreatic tumors and controls. Results: Average values of evaluated markers were: Controls: MMP1 -80,47 pg/ml, MMP2: 2915,46 pg/ml, MMP9: 5339,86 pg/ml, TIMP: 2,64 ng/ ml, Patients: MMP1 -31,86 pg/ml, MMP2: 2.360,33 pg/ml, MMP9: 10.776,61, TIMP: 3,835 ng/ml. Results analysis showed a very good correlation (p < 0,05) for MMP9; MMP1 presents significant changes compared with controls, but with bidirectional deviations -hyperexpression in untreated patients and underexpression in treated patients. Good correlation between elevated tissue remodeling serum markers and serum level of CA19.9 was observed. MMP9, TIMP) shows that MMP9 and MMP1 can be useful serum markers in the evaluation of pancreatic tumor evolution. H. Bouga 1 , I. Tsouros 1 , D. Bounias 2 , D. Kyriakopoulou 2 , M.

We examined plasma and urine-CTGF and GAGs levels, in relation to known inflammatory markers in type 1 diabetes mellitus children and adolescents, to evaluate their involvement in diabetic nephropathy. Methods: Plasma and urine-CTGF of 35 uncomplicated patients and 10 healthy controls(HCs) were measured by ELISA, while GAGs were measured spectrophotometrically. Markers of renal function, metabolic and inflammation state were estimated per subject. Our findings show that the loss of GAGs, responsible for the gradual loss of BM negative charges and the development of diabetic nephropathy, begins early in diabetic patients and is related to disease's duration and patients' inflammatory state. Our findings also suggest that CTGF might be involved in renal extracellular matrix modifications induced by diabetic hyperglycaemia.E. Ganea 1 , C. Laslo 1 , G. Putina 2 and R. Guta 2 Institute of Biochemistry, Bucharest, ROMANIA, 2 Institute of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Bucharest, ROMANIAIntroduction: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zincdependent enzymes degrade extracellular matrix components, having an important role in physiological tissue turnover, homeostasis, and morphogenesis. An imbalance in the expression of MMPs and their specific tissue inhibitors contributes to various pathologies. Bringing MMP inhibitors to clinical trials was not successful; therefore, finding new synthetic inhibitors became an important task. In the present work the inhibitory effects of new heterocyclic, hydroxamate-based compounds, synthesized by our group have been studied. Methods: Enzymatic activity of MMP2, MMP7, MMP9 and MMP12, as well as of MMPs in biological media (synovial fluid, bovine brain homogenate separated by Sephadex G-100) was estimated by a sensitive fluorescent method on FS-6 substrate, and by gelatin zymography. The specific enzymes were identified by Western-Blot analysis. The activity of MMPs secreted into RPI medium by murine melanoma cell lines B16-F1 and B16-F10, respectively, was estimated as well.Results: The compounds (C1-C5) tested, inhibited MMPs with different rate, function of inhibitor and enzyme, e.g. C4 was six-times more efficient on MMP7 than on MMP2; inhibition rate of MMPs in the synovial fluid was 63-83% for C1-C5, and in the bovine brain homogenate, the inhibition was: 67%, 44% and 37% for C1, C2 and C3, respectively. The highest activity of MMPs secreted by B16-line cells was detected after the third passage and inhibited in a similar way. Conclusions: The inhibitory capacity and selectivity displayed by some of the above mentioned compounds suggest their therapeutic potential and in the future, may show promise for cancer and arthritis therapy.PP4A-10 An investigation of selenium levels in healthy Kilis goats M.

We demonstrated by immunobloting that the treatment of Bcr-Abl-positive cells with either Imatinib or 17-AAG leads to the decrease in the expression level and the cleavage of the protein ROCK1. The treatment with Imatinib lowered the expression level of kinases LIM1 and LIM2. By means of FITC-phalloidin staining, we showed that both drugs induce extensive decomposition ofF-actin cytoskeletal structures in Bcr-Abl positive cell lines.

It is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that attacks the liver. HBV can cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis and cancer. Hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) is a viral protein associated with HBV infections and is often used as a marker of ability to spread the virus to other people. Therefore, detection of HBeAg is important in clinical diagnosis. Methods: Phage display technology offers a very efficient way to purify and characterize proteins by displaying them on the surface of the bacteriophage virion. In this study, HBe antigen was genetically fused to the minor capsid protein gp3 and displayed on the surface of filamentous phages. To assay the activity of the phage displayed HBe antigen, HBe-phages were tested by ELISA and used for immunization of BALB/c mice. Results and Conclusion: To obtain HBe phages, HBV E gene was cloned into phagemid vector and transferred into Escherichia coli TG1. Four clones was randomly selected and controlled by colony PCR. According to the PCR result, colony3 was rescued by M13 K07 phage and tested by ELISA for their affinity to Hbe antibodies. As the ELISA results were positive, BALB/c mice were immunized with col-ony3-phages. The immune response was detected with ELISA from blood samples and positive response was obtained. These results showed that HBe antigen can be displayed on phage surface without loss of activity and that phages can be effectively used as HBe antigen carrier for the production of monoclonal antibodies.E.

Four of them, blebbed, head bleb, myelencephalic-bleb and eye-bleb result from mutations in four genes, Fras1, Frem1, Frem2 and Grip1. Mutations in human counterparts FRAS1 and FREM2 have also been identified in Fraser syndrome patients. Fras1, Frem1, Frem2 and Frem3 comprise the family of four extracellular matrix proteins, similar in primary structure and localization pattern and functionally correlated with embryonic dermal-epidermal adhesion, while Grip1, a PDZ-protein, targets Fras1 and Frem2 to the basolateral site of epithelia. Methods: Fras1 knockout mice were generated by homologous recombination. Immunohistochemical studies were performed to investigate the localization pattern of Fras1/Frem proteins. Electron microscopy was utilized to map their exact location in the extracellular space.Results: Immunohistochemistry showed Fras1/Frem proteins to be strictly colocalized in the mouse epithelial basement membranes during development, while ultrastructural studies revealed their colocalization in the sublamina densa. Consistently, bleb mutants develop subepidermal blisters resulting from dermal-epidermal detachment below the lamina densa. Moreover, abolishment of one protein from the basement membrane, results in absence of the rest. Conclusions: Recent findings suggest a functional interplay between Fras1, Frem1 and Frem2, succeeded by the formation of an interdependent macromolecular protein complex, stabilized by the simultaneous interaction of all three proteins. On the other hand, Frem3 appears to act autonomously being detected in epithelial basement membranes, even in the absence of the rest Fras1/Frem proteins.A. Radwanska 1 , D. Nowak 1 , D.

It constitutes 60-80% of endometrial malignancies affecting women worldwide. At present, the best available tumour marker for diagnosis of this cancer is CA 125 which is elevated in a minority of patients with low stage disease. In the present study, we have used a lectin-based approach in combination with SELDI-MS to analyse the O-glycosylated serum protein profiles of patients with EACa and normal controls. Methods: Analysis of serum glycoproteins by SELDI-MS was performed utilising pre-activated ProteinChip arrays immobilised with champedak galactose binding (CGB) lectin. The developed lectin-array was used to capture O-glycosylated proteins with Gal or Gal(1-3Gal-NAc configuration in sera of patients with EACa (n = 12) and normal controls (n = 10). Peak profiles obtained from both cohorts were analysed using Biomarker Wizard software. Results: Optimisation experiments of the glycoprotein capture assay showed that the lectin-array was capable of retaining O-linked serum glycoproteins with masses ranging from 5000 to 40 000 Da. Comparison between the SELDI spectral profiles of normal individuals and patients with EACa elucidated differences in the clusters of peaks detected. Using the Biomarker Wizard software, comparison of the synthetic peak maps of the groups showed a pattern where two peaks were observed solely in the spectra of normal controls. In contrast, six peaks were found exclusively in EACa patients.Conclusions: The development of the new lectin-array enables analysis of O-glycosylated serum protein expression patterns associated with cancers and other pathological diseases.

Aiming at the identification of new virulence determinants of the BCC, a mutant collection of B. cenocepacia K56-2 was prepared, by random plasposon mutagenesis, and screened for impaired virulence using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans infection model. Results and discussion: The P4A1 mutant strain was selected due its phenotype of reduced virulence to the C. elegans. Sequence analysis and homology searches revealed that B. cenocepacia P4A1 carries a Tn5 insertion in an ORF, here named pbr, encoding a putative protein 72% identical to the DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta from Bacillus cereus AH1134. In silico analysis revealed that Pbr contains a HTH motif, putatively involved in nucleic acid binding. Sequence analysis of the DNA sequence upstream pbr revealed two ORFs, encoding putative proteins 97% and 91% identical, respectively, to the Pseudomonas chlororaphis phenazine biosynthesis PhzD and PhzF. The mutant was unable to produce phenazines. A putative gene encoding a protein of unknown function was also found upstream of the phzF gene. The search for homologous sequences in other BCC species with their genome sequences available, revealed that the locus here described is, most probably, unique in the BCC. Due to the low GC content of this locus, as compared to the median GC content of the genome, it is hypothesized that this could be part of a larger genomic region acquired through horizontal transfer.Acknowledgement: Work Funded by PTDC/BIA-MIC/65210/2006.",

Trif Institute of Biochemistry, Bucharest, ROMANIA Backround: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important human pathogen that causes chronic liver disease leading to death. The current antiviral therapy is inefficient and often leads to selection of drug-resistant mutants. Deoxynojirimycin-based iminosugar derivatives (NB-DNJ and NN-DNJ) are ER a-glucosidase inhibitors with antiviral activity against HBV. Treatment of HBV-infected cells with these drugs results in viral protein misfolding and degradation, impaired assembly of envelope proteins and secretion of less infectious viral particles. However, the drugs concentration used is rather high (for NB-DNJ) or associated with cellular toxicity (for NN-DNJ). To tackle these problems we developed a drug delivery system based on incorporation of the inhibitors in liposomes. Materials and methods: Liposomes were prepared using phosphatidylcholine, dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine and cholesterol (7:2:1), by thin-film hydration followed by sonication. Empty liposome and liposome entrapped NB-DNJ and NN-DNJ were extruded under sterile conditions, resulting liposomes with a diameter of 200 nm. HepG2.2.2.15 cells stably transfected with the HBV genome were treated with either free or liposome entrapped drugs, for 9 days. The medium was collected and secreted virus was purified by ultracentrifugation and quantified by Southern blot. Results: HBV-infected cells were treated with either free of liposomeincorporated drugs, in concentrations ranging from 5 to 500 lM. NB-DNJ delivery by liposomes resulted in a 40 fold enhancement of the inhibition of HBV secretion when used at a concentration of 50 lM. The antiviral effect of NN-DNJ was improved by two fold only, however, a major reduction of cellular toxicity associated with this drug was observed. Conclusions: The antiviral effect of the iminosugars against HBV was greatly improved by liposome delivery, while cellular toxicity was reduced. Our findings point to the possibility of developing these formulations for anti-HBV treatment.H. H. T. Moreira 1 , M. O. Albuquerque 2 , R. C. M. Paula 2 , R. A. Moreira 1 and A. C.

Polysaccharide modification has been explored to obtain lipophylic material, best absorbed by the body. Galactomannans, neutral water soluble polysaccharides, present in leguminous endospermic cell walls, have great potential for nanoparticle synthesis, due to their high viscosity, biocompatibility and biodegradability. Galactomannan (2 g) were solubilized in formamide (60 ml), under stirring, at 50\u00b0C. To this solution, pyridine (12 ml) and acetic anhydride (30 ml) were added at 54ordm;C, under stirring for 48 hour. The viscous solution obtained was purified by precipitation with successive washing with H 2 O and the precipitate, dryed at 40\u00b0C for 24 hour was stored at room temperature. Nanoparticles were prepared by emulsion of a galactomannan acetate solution (0.05% in DMSO) dispersed in H 2 O, in the proportion of 1:50, in the presence or absence of the surfactant agent SPAN 20. The FT-IR spectra confirmed that the acetyl moieties had been successfully introduced, as new peaks appeared at 1753/cm, 1375/cm and 604/cm, when compared to non treated galactomannan spectrum and both samples showed mono dispersion characteristics. No remarkable difference was found due to the use of surfactant, as nanoparticles obtained in its presence showed a size of 434 nm while in its absence nanoparticles of 449 nm were obtained.

This fact points out the possibility to use efficient carriers for cytochrome c to induce cell death. Methods: Giant diocatadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DODAB) vesicles were loaded with cytochrome c and Fe 3+ Meso-tetrakis(2,4dichloro-3-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin (Fe 3+ TDCSO 3 -Na + PP), incubated with K562, K562 Lucena (a multi-drug resistent cell) and aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) and the samples analyzed by Trypan blue assay and fluorescence microscopy. Results: In the absence of porphyrins and cytochrome c, DODAB vesicles induced adherence and death in SMC and leukemic cells by affecting membranes integrity. Cytochrome c-loaded DODAB vesicles did not induce adherence but was very efficient to trigger apoptosis in SMC. In K562 and K562 Lucena cells, the loading of cytochrome c decrease significantly the capacity of DODAB to induce cell death. The association of Fe 3+ TDCSO 3 -Na + PP to DODAB vesicles was corroborated by changes in electronic absorption and paramagnetic spectra (EPR). Analysis of the complex TDCSO 3 -Na + PP/DODAB image by atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed the formation of a nanowire net that exhibited peroxidase activity. The TDCSO 3 -Na + PP/DODAB complexes were efficient to induce cell death in both, leukemic cell lineages, and relative to the control in the absence of DODAB, they were slightly more efficient for K562 Lucena. Conclusion: diocatadecyldimethylammonium bromide was an efficient carrier to deliver cytochrome c to SMC but not to the leukemic lineages. The significant efficiency of TDCSO 3 -Na + PP/DODAB to induce death in a MDR cell points out a possible use in cancer therapy.Acknowledgements: Supported by FAPESP, CNPq and FAEP-UMC.

Because preparation method characteristics a pre-formulation study on the Dtxd structure is shown. Methods: The protein integrity after sonication with ethyl acetate in the presence of salts was followed by HPLC, CD, ELISA and fluorescence. Encapsulation: Dtxd in 0.5% chitosan was added to soy phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/ethyl acetate. After micelle formation, by sonication, the formed organogel was resuspended in 1% PVA. Results: The protein solubilization increased to 98% in the presence of PO 4 2and decreased in the presence of Cl -, SCNand Mg 2 (5-40%). The Dtxd a-helical content was quite stable with minor exposition of hydrophobic residues (corroborated by measures on intrinsic Trp fluorescence). Round chitosan-sandwiched REVs (REVs-Chi) particles of 373 \u00b1 17 nm containing 65% Dtxd were obtained. After 200 minutes of incubation in a simulated gastric fluid, 70% of the immunological active Dtxd was liberated from REVs-Chi in comparison to 100% of Dtxd liberated from pure REVs. In PBS, the Dtxd liberation from REVS-Chi was about 60%.Conclusions: REVS-Chi liberated soluble and immunological active Dtxd. The formulation can be use as vaccine particulate adjuvant.

Its determination may contribute to the assessment of human nutritional and health status. Methods: Selenium was determined in 506 adults (39 \u00b1 11 years) by ICP/MS. The dietary intake was assessed using a semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed by a validated special diet-score. Results: Men and women had similar serum selenium values [men(n = 296): 93.9 \u00b1 31.6 lg/l, women(n = 210): 90.5 \u00b1 35.1 lg/l, P = 0.27), while 88% of them had serum Se<125 lg/l (cut-off considered to be required for optimal glutathione peroxidase). Se levels were decreased with advanced age and smoking habits, and increased with the adherence to a Mediterranean type of diet, as well as with meat, and poultry intake (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Roughly 9/10 of the participants had low Se. For the first time in our population, we revealed that Se levels are inversely associated with age and smoking, while greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet seems to increase its concentration in apparently healthy adults. However, some other nutritional habits like the consumption of meat seem also to increase Se, in our sample.

Results: The weight gain in CLA was lower than control (P < 0.05), inspite of no alteration of food consumption. No modification of muscle fat content was observed in CLA groups compared with controls. Muscle CPT I, CPT II and LPL gene expression was enhanced (P < 0.05), while in expression of muscle PPARa was reduced in CLA, as compared with control groups (P < 0.05). Conclusion: CLA supplementation modifies lipid metabolism, enhancing fat acid oxidation in the muscle of supplemented rats, but this alteration is not accompanied by increase in PPARa expression.L.

As n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), as those found in fish oil (FO), are known to modulate lipid metabolism, we examined the effect of FO supplementation upon CAR mRNA expression. Since n-3 fatty acids are natural ligands to PPARs, we also sought to study the role of PPAR alpha in the mediation of FO effect upon CAR expression. Methods: Male rats were supplemented with n-3 for 5 days (in vivo experiments). In another experiment in vitro, primary hepatocytes cells were cultured. After 24 hour was added in the hepatocytes, 10 lM of WY14643 (PPAR alpha agonist), and the culture was continued for 48 hour more (total of 72 hour). CAR gene expression was measured by Real Time RT/PCR in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Results: Gene expression of CAR was two-fold increased by FO (in vivo) and nine-fold by PPARa agonist WY14643 in experiments carried out in vitro. Conclusion: FO supplementation was able to induce CAR gene expression in rat liver probally through PPARa activation. These results suggest a mechanism of energy homeostasis control by CAR/ PPARa activation, where PPAR alpha-dependent induction of CAR appears to be of high physiological significance.J.

However, the simultaneous influence of these risk factors on Alzheimer's disease is not clarified and was investigated in the present study. Methods: The subjects were composed of 19 individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's type Dementia (AD) (test group) and 36 healthy individuals matched for age and gender (control group). The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee; the subjects volunteered for the study and gave their informed consent. Blood samples were collected and serum concentrations of the studied biochemical parameters were determined. MTHFR 1298A>C mutation was screened by PCR-RFLP.Results: Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed and the best model obtained included homocysteine (OR = 1.OR = 0.728, p < 0.001), uric acid (OR = 14.6, p < 0.001), vitamin B 12 (OR = 0.984, p < 0.004) and MTHFR 1298A>C mutation (OR = 23.4, p < 0.03) as predictors for AD. Conclusions: High serum concentrations of homocysteine, cholesterol and uric acid, and low concentrations of estradiol and vitamin B 12 , as well as the MTHFR 1298A>C mutation are associated to AD.T.

Theoretical evaluation of radical scavenging activity of plant bioflavonoids rutin and quercetin in relation to their effect on oxidative stress markers in red blood cells (RBC) of cold-restraint stressed (CRS) rats' was the aim of the present study. Methodology: Ionization energy (HOMO) for quantitative estimation of radical scavenging activity and geometry optimization at Hartree-Fock level of theory using 6-31G basis set were used. Ab initio calculations were performed using GAMESS software. Rutin and quercetin (100 mg/kg) were applied orally 1 hour before the experiment. Oxidative stress was initiated using CRS-model. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) as membrane lipid peroxidation marker, reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione related to endogenous antioxidant potential were measured in RBC hemolysates. Results: The calculated HOMO-energies of quercetin and rutin were -0.2880 and -0.2780 atomic units respectively, which mean higher radical-trapping potential for quercetin than for rutin. Biochemical studies showed markedly elevation of TBRAS (42%) and reduction of glutathione (33% for GSH, 18% for GSSG) after CRS-period. Pretreatment with quercetin increased GSH by 30% and they reach the control values. GSSG and TBRAS significantly decrease (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with rutin did not change the increased TBARS and GSSG. GSH decreased by 37%. Conclusion: In spite of similar quercetin and rutin calculated HOMOenergies, they differ in antioxidant potential evaluated in vivo. A possible reason may be due to the carbohydrate component in rutin structure, which impedes its penetration across the membrane.PP8C-10 Effects of olive extracts on free radical metabolism and glucose stimulated insulin release in INS-1E cell line exposed to H 2 O 2 A.

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) on genomic DNA can be used as a hereditary trait factor. Many reports have been published about cause-effect relationships between SNPs-LRD; however, reproducibility of those responsive factors is low. A decision-tree method of complexity-model was employed to select LRD responsive factors. Methods: Genomic DNA was collected from four Asia-Pacific regions including Thai, Palau, Mongol and China. Three indices of LRD (BMI, body fat, and serum leptin levels) were classified according to published criteria. WEKA Machine-learning system was used as decision-tree software. Age was added as a factor with different dimension. Selected factors were validated by ANOVA and Levine's test for equality of variance. Results: In Thai-males, WEKA system nominated GLUT1 (glucosetransporter 1)-SNP as most-responsive factor to body fat, which was followed by USF1-SNP (transcription-factor for lipid metabolism), but age was not selected as responsive factor. Differences between actual values of each genotype were validated (P = 0.002 for GLUT1 by Levene's, P = 0.071 for USF1 by ANOVA). Nominated factors for leptin levels of Thai-males were USF1 and age. Factors for leptin levels of Thai-females were age, PON1 (paraoxonase, high-density-lipoprotein associated enzyme), KCNJ1 (potassium non voltage-gated channel) and DGAT (diacylglycerol acyltransferase). Convincing responsive factors were not selected from mixed data of four regions. Conclusions: Decision-tree-analysis successfully selected the convincing results. Responsive-factors differed by ethnic group and gender.PP8C-19Melissa officinalis extract inhibiting the formation of advanced glycation end-productsS. Khazaei 1 , M. Shirvani 1 , S.

We hypothesized that isoflavone attenuates vascular contraction by inhibiting RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling pathway. Rat aortic rings were denuded of endothelium, mounted in organ baths, and contracted with U46619, a thromboxane A2 analogue or KCl in the presence of genistein or daidzein (10, 30 and 100 lM) for 30 minute or not. We determined the phosphorylation level of myosin light chain (MLC 20 ), myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1) and protein kinase C (PKC) -potentiated inhibitory protein for heterotrimeric myosin light chain phosphatase of 17 kDa (CPI17) by the Western blot. We also measured the amount of GTP RhoA as a marker for RhoA activation. Cumulative addition of U46619 and KCl increased vascular tension in a concentration-dependent manner, which were inhibited by pretreatment with genistein or daidzein. U46619 (30 nM) and KCl (50 mM) increased phosphorylation level of the MLC 20, which were inhibited by genistein or daidzein. Furthermore, both genistein and daidzein decreased the amount of GTP RhoA activated by U46619 or KCl. U46619 (30 nM) increased Rho-kinasedependent phosphorylation of the MYPT1 Thr855 and CPI17 Thr38 , which were also inhibited by genistein or daidzein. However, neither genistein nor daidzein inhibited PDBu-induced vascular contraction and CPI17 phosphorylation. In conclusion, isoflavone attenuates vascular contraction at least in part through inhibition of RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling pathway.PP8C-22Role of phosphatidylcholine and its hydrolyzates for efficient intestinal lipid transport in Caco-2 cellsT.

Methods: Lipid micelles (oleic acid 0.6, cholesterol 0.05, monooleylglycerol 0.2, taurocholate 2 in mmol/l) with or without choline, PC, and lysoPC were applied apically to Caco-2 cells cultured for 3 weeks on filter membranes. 3 H-oleic acid and 14 C-cholesterol were added to the micelles when necessary. Secreted lipoproteins were analyzed by a HPLC method. Results: LysoPC had the most potent promoting effect on lipid uptake, and lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B-48 secretion among the molecules tested. LysoPC doubled the output of cholesterol and triglyceride as the lipoprotein component, but PC did not. PC increased the secretion of apoA-IV and altered the mRNA levels of lipid metabolism-associated transcription factors, PPARgamma (25%, p < 0.05) and hepatic nuclear factor-4alpha (-19%, p < 0.01). Conclusions: These findings indicate that PC regulates apolipoprotein metabolism, while lysoPC stimulates intestinal lipid transport by accelerating lipoprotein assembly and lipid clearance. Thus, the functional alteration of PC by PLA 2 hydrolysis appears to be intrinsically involved in the intestinal lipid absorption process.N. Kucuk, B. Vanizor Kural and A. OremKaradeniz Technical University, Institute of Health Sciences, Department of Biochemistry, Trabzon, TURKEY Introduction: Brassicaceous plants contain polyphenols, flavonoids and glucosinolates, and so have antioxidant and antiatherogenic effects. Antioxidants inhibit free radical reactions, and therefore protect lipoproteins from oxidation. Oxidation of lipoproteins play an important role in early stage of the development of atherosclerosis. Methods: In the present study, two different concentrations (10 and 50 lg/ml) of aqueous extracts of kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala) were evaluated for protective effect of lipoprotein oxidation. After isolation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) of 10 healthy volunteers, LDL susceptibilities to copper-induced oxidation were determined by measuring the conjugated diene kinetics with and without kale extracts. Lag time [t (lag)] as a resistance to oxidation of LDL, diene conjugation rate and the total amount of diene produced were evaluated. Results: Resistance of LDL to oxidation increased but diene conjugation rate and the total amount of diene were decreased by increasing extract concentrations significantly. Conclusion: It was concluded that kale extracts decreased susceptibility of LDL, to oxidation. Furthermore, kale has beneficial effects against development of atherosclerosis.PP8C-24Hepatoprotective effect of clam extracts on alcohol-induced liver injuryS. L. Lee 1 , C. Y. Yang 2 and T. Y.

Garcia Department of Cell Biology, University of Concepcion, Concepcion, CHILE Introduction: The hypothalamus is involved in the modulation of the feeding behavior through its ability to detect changes in circulating glucose. Glucokinase (GK) and glucose transporter, GLUT2, are considered to be components of a glucose sensor system. Glucokinase plays a fundamental role in glucose homeostasis, catalyzing the high Km phosphorilation of glucose in tissues involved in glucose sensing mechanisms. Different studies have reported that GK mRNA is expressed in the hypothalamus, however, it has not been clearly determined if glial and/or neuron cells express this protein. Previously we have demonstrated that GLUT2 is localized in tanycytes, glial periventricular cells localized in the hypothalamus. Methods: In this study, we analyzed GLUT2 and GK coexpression in the hypothalamic region using QRT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohystochemystry analyses. Results: We demonstrate that GK mRNA is expressed in tanycytes. Real time PCR showed that GK expression in the hypothalamus increased gradually during post-natal life. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that both GLUT2 and GK are coexpressed in tanycytes. GK is mainly localized in the nuclei, while GLUT2 is observed in the cytoplasmatic area and apical membranes of these cells.Conclusions: Based on this evidence, we propose that tanycytes are responsible, at least in part, for a mechanism that allows the hypothalamus to detect changes in glucose concentrations.

Dog\u02d8ru 2 Molecular Biology Section, Science Faculty, Dicle University, Diyarbakir, TURKEY, 2 Science Education Department, Education Faculty, Dicle University, Diyarbakir, TURKEY Introduction: b-galactosidase is a member of glycosyl hydrolyses (GH; EC 3.2.1-3.2.3) which are known to cleave the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates or between a carbohydrate and another moiety. Of these, thermophilic (including thermophilic bacilli), psychrophilic, and halophilic organisms belong to GH-42 family. The enzyme b-galactosidase has main biotechnological uses in the diary industry, e.g. removal of lactose from milk for lactose-intolerant people. Materials and Methods: An intracellular b-galactosidase from a thermoacidophilic Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius subsp. rittmannii was purified by procedures described recently by Gul-Guven et al., (Enzyme and Microbial Technology, 2007, 40:1570-1577). The bacteria produce thermostable b-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) activity, which exhibits its optimum at the neutral pH region. The pH and temperature optima for the purified enzyme are 6.0 and 65\u00b0C, respectively (10 minute assay).The homogenous enzyme had a specific activity of 113 U/mg protein, with a fold purification of 163 and a yield of 8% using the substrate ONPG.",

Fish consumption, one of Mediterranean diet characteristics, has been associated with lower incidence of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). Consequently, fish polar lipids were studied in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Gilthead sea bream total polar lipids (GSBTPL) were isolated from its total lipids. Antithrombotic activity was tested in vitro on washed rabbit platelets. Antiatherogenic activity was studied in vivo using cholesterol fed rabbits. PAF-acetylhydrolase activity and platelet aggregation were determined in rabbit blood. Atherosclerotic damage was assessed by morphometric analysis. Results: GSBTPL inhibited PAF-induced aggregation with IC 50 = 85 \u00b1 10 mcg GSBTPL. Rabbits fed on atherogenic diet enriched with GSBTPL exhibited increased PAF-acetylhydrolase activity, reduced platelet aggregation efficiency and reduced atherosclerotic lesion thickness up to 80%, compared with ones that consumed plain atherogenic diet. Conclusions: It is reported for the first time, that GSBTPL exhibit both antithrombotic and antiatherogenic properties. This further supports the theory of PAF implication in atherogenesis and suggests a biochemical explanation of the protective role fish consumption has against CHD.PP8C-30Apical -basolateral membrane distribution of DMT1 and ferroportin determines intestinal iron absorption M.

Body iron levels are regulated by the intestinal epithelial through the coordinated action of two transporters: DMT1, which transports iron form the intestinal lumen into the enterocyte, and ferroportin, which transport iron from the cell into the blood. In this work, we studied the membrane localization of DMT1 and ferroportin and their associated iron fluxes, as a function of the iron status of intestinal epithelia (Caco-2) cells grown in bicameral inserts. Methods: Apical/basolateral membrane localization was determined by selective biotinylation and Western blot analysis. The movement of the transporters was determined by time-lapsed confocal microscopy. A double-isotope ( 55 Fe/ 59 Fe) technique was used to determine concurrent influx and efflux of iron into the apical and basolateral chambers. Results: Iron supplement resulted in the relocalization of DMT1 from the apical membrane into a basal domain, while ferroportin underwent internalization form the basolateral membrane into an intracellular pool. The relocalization of the transporters modified iron fluxes at both the apical and the basolateral membranes. Conclusions: The movement of transporters described here unveils a rapid cellular mechanism for the regulation of intestinal iron absorption.

Aslan 2Uludag University, Bursa, TURKEY, 2 Pamukkale University, Denizli, TURKEY Introduction: Recently, various studies have emphasized the nutritional benefits of fish consumption to protect against coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality and stroke. Twice weekly consumption of oily fish containing omega-3 fatty acids (FAs), or 1 g eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) daily is recommended. The content of EPA + DHA in erythrocyte membranes (expressed as a percent of total FA) is called 'Omega-3 Index', which appears to be the best FA metric for evaluating CHD and its inversely associated mortality risk. The high prevalence of CHD in Turks is known to be associated with dyslipidemia, but other relevant risk factors are being investigated. This study was designed to determine the erythrocyte membrane FA composition and omega-3 index in healthy volunteers from Northwest Turkey. Methods: Fasting venous blood samples were obtained from 207 healthy 18-to 45-year-olds. Erythrocytes were extracted, transesterificated then analyzed by Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph.

Uncariae ramulus cum uncis (UR), is a popular herbal medicine used to treat stroke and vascular dementia in East Asia. In the present study, we examined whether UR suppress AD-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice treated with DNFB or FITC under SPF conditions. Oral administration of UR to DNFBtreated NC/Nga mice was found to inhibit ear thickness increases and the skin lesions induced by DNFB, but not FITC. IFN-gamma production by CD4 + T cells from the lymph nodes of DNFB-treated NC/ Nga mice was significantly inhibited by UR treatment, although levels of IL-4 and total IgE in serum were not. These studies suggest that UR may suppress the development of AD-like dermatitis in DNFBtreated NC/Nga mice by reducing IFN-gamma production.PP8C-34Single cell assay by synchrotron-based X-ray microscopy and fluorescence mapping Ca 2+ and K + changes in pancreatic b-cells M. Altissimo 2 , R. Delfino 1 , M. Salomi 3 and L. Pascolo 1 University of Trieste, Trieste, ITALY, 2 CSIRO, Clayton, AUSTRALIA,3  ESRF, Grenoble, FRANCEIntroduction: In pancreatic b-cells, intracellular glucose levels regulate insulin secretion by acting on K + channels and varying membrane permeability to Ca 2+ . It is well established that, similarly to high glucose levels, the antidiabetic drug glibenclamide causes the closure of the K + Channels, with consequent depolarization of the b-cells plasma membrane, opening of the voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channels and insulin granule exocytosis. Recent studies suggest that sulfonilureas may act on additional unknown mechanisms which are responsible of abnormal Ca 2+ overloads. Methods: Synchrotron-based Scanning X-ray Microscopy (SXM) performed in phase contrast mode allows imaging of a single cell, with sub-cell resolution. X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) detection coupled SXM allows elemental analysis, mapping and quantification in the cell. We used this technique to monitor K + , Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ variations in pancreatic insulin producing cells (RIN-5m). Cells were exposed for 4 hours either to high glucose concentrations (10 mM) or to therapeutic doses of glibenclamide (5 and 10 lM). Results: As expected, glucose causes a uniform increase of K + and Ca 2+ inside the cell. After exposure to glibenclamide, K + levels were comparable to those of cells treated with high glucose concentration, while the Ca 2+ content was noticeably higher (four times), the effects being concentration dependent. Conclusion: These results confirm the hypothesis that glibenclamide acts on multiple Ca 2+ regulating mechanisms. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that SXM coupled with XRF allows the simultaneous determination in a single cell of the K + and Ca 2+ distributions, also providing a realistic quantification.K. Sakuma and A. FukushimaKagawa Nutrition University, Saitama, JAPAN Introduction: Transcellular calcium (Ca) absorption in intestine consists of three sequential steps; Ca influx from intestinal lumen to the intestinal absorptive cells, intracellular diffusion towards the basolateral membrane and subsequent extrusion into the blood compartment. Epithelial calcium channel (TRPV6) in the first step, calcium binding protein (CaBP) in cytoplasm and Ca-ATPase (PMCA1) in the step of extrusion were characterized. While it has long been known that fructooligosaccharides (FOS) increase the Ca absorption, the mechanism has not yet been elucidated. Methods: To characterize the effects of FOS, we fed rats on a diet supplemented with FOS and analyzed the gene expression of TRPV6, CaBP and PMCA1. As a direct regulator of transcription, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that were produced by enteric bacteria were added to the medium of Caco-2 cells and mRNA levels were determined. Rat genomic TRPV6 clone was isolated and SCFAs responsive sequences were analyzed by the luciferase reporter assay. Results: The FOS feeding increased the mRNA levels of TRPV6 and CaBP but not PMCA1. The mRNA levels of TRPV6 and CaBP revealed the increase by adding propionate and butyrate in Caco-2 cells, while VDR and cdx-2 didn't show any change. The butyrate responsive sequences were determined between -71 bp and transcription start site of TRPV6 gene. Conclusions: FOS increase Ca absorption in intestine through the gene regulation by SCFAs. The new transcription factor except VDR and cdx-2 was suggested in that process.PP8C-36 SVCT2 transporter in early post-natal brain cortexK. Salazar 1 , M. A. Garcia 1 , C. Gonzalez 2 and F.

Arslan 2Balikesir University Susurluk Vocational High School, Balikesir, TURKEY 2 Balikesir University Science and Art Faculty, Balikesir, TURKEY Introduction: Polyphenol oxidases (PPO) (EC 1.14.18.1) are very important enzymes in food industry for their involvement in the enzymatic browning of edible plants. Herby cheese, a semi-hard, salty and herb added, is manufactured in small family businesses for their needs and commercial purposes from raw sheep's and cow's milk between May and June in the Eastern and Southeastern of Turkey. A number of herbs such as Allium sp., Thymus sp., Mentha sp., Antriscus sp. and Ferule sp. are used in making herb cheese. Enzymatic browning damages nutritional quality and economic value of herbs and herby cheese. Method: Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) was extracted from mendo (Antriscus nemorosa) andMentha species added into herby cheese on Van region in Turkey. Results: Mentha PPO showed activity to catechol and pregallol (K m values were 25 mM and V max values were 500 EU/ml/minute for catechol; K m values were 2 mM and V max values were 250 EU/ml/minute for pregallol). Mendo PPO activity was lower than Mentha PPO (K m values were 2.5 mM and V max values were 333 EU/ml/minute for catechol; K m values were 0.25 mM and V max values were 55 EU/ml/minute for pregallol). Its characteristics in terms of pH and optimum temperature, thermal inactivation, kinetic parameters were studied. Optimum pH and temperature for Mentha and Mendo PPO were found using catechol as substrate at pH 6.8 and 30\u00b0C, respectively. Heat inactivation studies showed temperature >40\u00b0C resulted in loss of enzyme activity. Conclusions: Heat process can be used safely in herby cheese production. Thus enzymatic browning could be prevented.M. Kotorma\u00b4n, A. Cseri and M. L.

Atherosclerotic damage was assessed by morphometric analysis.Results: Virgin olive oil (VO), OOPL or PPL when added to rabbits' atherogenic diet -at amounts equivalent to their respective IC 50 values -inhibited atherogenesis up to 70%. Additionally, PPL and simvastatin also induced atherosclerosis regression (70% and 52%, respectively) in already formed atherosclerotic lesions. Conclusions: The anti-atherogenic effect of olive oil may be attributed to the presence of PAF antagonists in polar lipids fraction, capable of inducing atherosclerosis regression to an extent comparable to that of simvastatin.",

Yoshikawa Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, JAPAN Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) has been reported as an important strategy for the prevention of various cancers. It is also known that tocotrienol has antiproliferative, antioxidant and pro-apoptotic effects and plays a role in the regulation of mitogenesis. We have investigated the effects of tocotrienol on Cox-2 expression and production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in p53 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). MEFs were stimulated with 1 lg/ml of LPS and 100 IU/ml of IFNgamma after pretreatment with or without various concentrations of alpha-, beta-, gamma-and delta-tocotrienol. Expressions of COX-2 protein were analyzed by Western-blotting, concentrations of nitrite were measured by Griess reagent and PGE2 concentrations were measured by ELISA. MEFs treated with tocotrienol showed reduced expression levels of COX-2 proteins, which were induced by LPS and IFN-gamma, compared with non-treated cells. Concentrations of PGE2 in the medium of MEFs, activated by tocotrienol in the presence of LPS and IFNgamma, were lower than those in MEFs without tocotrienol. In addition, nitrite concentrations in the medium of tocotrienol treated MEFs were lower than those in non-treated MEFs. On the other hand, tocotrienols could not affect significantly on the concentration of Vascular endothelial growth factor. The antioxidant effects might be one of the mechanisms of Cox-2 suppressive effect of tocotrienol. The data obtained in the present study suggest that Tocotrienol appears to be an agent for use in cancer prevention.PP8C-44Relationship between serum resistin concentrations and insulin resistance indices in non-diabetic and diabetic obese subjectsG.

Zarghami Mohammad 1,2 Nutritional Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, IRAN, 2 Department of Clinical Biochemistry and RIA, Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, IRANBackground and Aim: Resistin, an adipocyte secreted hormone, has been suggested to link obesity with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance in rodent models, but its relevance to human diabetes remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum resistin concentrations with markers of insulin resistance and obesity in type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic obese subjects. Design and Methods: This cross sectional study consisting of 35 obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 35 non-diabetics obese subjects. Fasting lipid profile was measured by the enzymatic methods. NycoCard HbA1c system was used to measure HbA1c. The Serum resistin and insulin levels were measured by using commercially available kits. The insulin resistance index was determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR).Results: There was no significant difference in resistin levels between non-diabetic and diabetic obese subjects. While, resistin levels in (7.46 \u00b1 0.29 vs. 5.51 \u00b1 0.73 ng/ml) in diabetic women and (8.15 \u00b1 1.01 vs. 5.97 \u00b1 0.57 ng/ml) in non-diabetic were significantly higher than men in both groups. Serum resistin was not significantly related to any variables measured in both groups. In control group only, we observed a significant and negative correlation between diastolic blood pressure and resistin(r = -0.381; P = 0.024). Conclusion: Serum resistin concentrations are reduced in obese patient with type 2 diabetes, but are not associated with insulin resistance or obesity. Resistin links between obesity and diabetes in humans still controversial and needs to further investigation.

The microbial degradation of nitriles proceeds through two enzymatic pathways: nitrilase catalyzes the direct cleavage of nitriles to yield acids and ammonia; and nitrile hydratase (NHase) catalyzes the hydration of nitriles to amides, which are subsequently hydrolyzed to acids and ammonia by amidase. Recently, we reported an overall 'nitrile pathway' (aldoxime fi nitrile fi amide fi acid fi acyl-CoA) comprising aldoxime dehydratase, NHase, amidase and acyl-CoA synthetase (AcsA) of Pseudomonas chlororaphis B23.",

Cetinkaya TUBITAK, Marmara Research Center (MRC), Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Institute (GEBI), Transgenic Core Facility, Kocaeli, TURKEY Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) have been demonstrated to bind to the ice crystals and inhibit ice crystal growth and inhibit ice recrystallization. Transgenic expression of the AFPs is much more elegant way of trying to improve cold tolerance. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether cryogenic effect of fish antifreeze protein (AFP) on one-cell stage transgenic mouse vitrified embryos. In this study, AFP transgenic and non-transgenic one-cell stage embryos, AFP and non-transgenic fresh mouse one-cell stage embryos were vitrified with 35% EG, 5% PVP in M2 medium supplemented with 0.4 M trehalose by solid surface vitrification (SSV) techniques. Warming was performed by dropping the vitrified droplets containing 500 ll 0.3 M trehalose solution at RT for 3 minutes. Recovered warmed embryos from each group were rinsed three times in M2, and then cultured to blastocyst stage in SAGE 1-2 medium under mineral oil at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in air. Results obtained from this study were summarized in table below. Data were analyzed by Chi-square and fisher's exact tests. The highest blastocyst and hatching blastocyst rates were achieved in transgenic vitrification group (80% and 22% for blastocyst and hatching blastocyst after vitrification, respectively), not different from that of the corresponding control groups (75% and 20%, respectively). In conclusion, in this study first time demonstrated that a transgenic mouse carried fish AFP, when expressed in the ovaries of transgenic mice, was effective at protecting the embryo in vitro development after vitrification.

PPGs are a large family extensively glycosylated proteins with some unusual and unique features. Methods: In this study we purified PPG from culture supernatant L. major metacyclic promastigotes by a combination anion and cation exchange chromatography. The heterogenity PPG was determined using SDS-PAGE and agarose gel electrophoresis. Protein, phosphate and glycan content PPG were measured by usuall analytical methods. Also we evaluate the effect PPG on oxygen species (ROS) and cytokines production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results: In discontinuous SDS-PAGE, PPG could not enter the resolving gel but after mild acid hydrolysis four band resolved. Agarose gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibody (WIC 79.3) indicated that PPG is a heterogeneous molecule. Compositional analysis showed that PPG preparation contains 67% glycan, 28% protein and 5% phosphate. Also, the effect PPG on ROS production and induction IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-c secretion by PBMCs isolated from healthy individuals was investigated. Water-soluble secreted form PPG at 1 lg glycan/ml seems to be a potent inducer ROS and IL-10 and to a lesser extent IFN-c and IL-12. Cytokines and ROS production was decreased in a dose-dependent manner as the concentration PPG increased to 100 lg glycan/ml. Conclusion: These results showed the ability L. major PPGs to down-regulate cytokine secretion by PBMCs implicating their role as immuno-suppressive surface molecules.PP8-10 Mutagenesis of Iranian firefly luciferase (Lampyris turkestanicus) for improvement of thermostability B.

O. Ate\u015f , T. Tezil and H. Ba\u015f ag\u02d8a Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Biological Sciences and Bioengineering Program, Sabanci University, Istanbul, TURKEY Introduction: The mechanism of action of the anticancer drug cisplatin (CDDP) has been elucidated presenting the importance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the induction of apoptosis. To investigate further on this phenomenon we added the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) into the equation as NAC would act as an ROS scavenger. We used the p53 wild type (wt) and knockout (-/-) phenotypes of HCT116 as the protein p53 helps conserving the stability of the genome. Methods: To evaluate cell viability MTT Assay, for examining apoptotic cell death flow cytometric analyses by Annexin V staining, for cellular oxidative stress evaluation TBARS lipid peroxidation method and DCF staining both fluorometrically and flow cytometrically, for detect-ing carbonylation of proteins due to oxidative stress OxyBlot Western Blotting Assay have been performed on HCT 116 p53 wt and knockout cell lines with or without NAC pre-treatment as with varying concentrations of CDDP at different time points. Results:Conclusions: We suggest the decrease in the apoptotic response due to NAC pre-treatment indicates the significance of ROS induction by CDDP due to DNA damage and loss of function by carbonylation of anti-apoptotic proteins as a result of protein oxidation caused by ROS.H. K. Aynaci and A. SenDepartment of Biology, Faculty of Arts & Sciences, Pamukkale University, Denizli, TURKEY Cytochrome P4502C9 is one of the most important drug metabolizing enzymes and the rationalization and prediction of potential CYP2C9 substrates is therefore advantageous in the discovery and development of new drugs. 7-Methoxy-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (MFC) was reported as novel and selective CYP2C9 substrate suitable for highthroughput screening. In this study, the selectivity of MFC for CYP2C9 was characterized in rat liver microsomes by monitoring the formation of metabolic product HFC using fluorescence spectroscope, Ex 390 nm and Em 502 nm wavelengths. Average methoxy-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin o-demethylase (MFCOD) activity of rat hepatic microsomes was found to be 0.122 nmol/min/mg protein. Apparent V max and K m values fish liver MFCOD using Lineweaver-Burk graph are calculated 0.218 nmol/min/mg protein and 0.96 lM, respectively. Furthermore, studies were carried out to determine the effects of various reaction conditions such as incubation time, enzyme content, pH and temperature on MFCOD of rat liver microsomes. It is ascertained that the enzyme activity was lineer until 200 lg microsomal protein amount throughout 75 minutes incubation at optimum pH and temperature; 7.5 and 30\u00b0C respectively. Immunochemical studies using anti-rat CYP2C IgG and in vitro inhibition studies using sulfaphenazole, quinidine, alpha-naphthoflavone and cimetidine are underway to further characterize the selectivity of the MFC. Nevertheless, results have shown that this assay can be used to measure CYP2C activity in this and other species.A. M. P. Lima 2 , M. A. Cerqueira 1 , B. W. S. Souza 1 , A. A. Vicente 1 , J. A.

The first category on simple salves have been constituted from: 4% lipid extracts (bioactive compounds), 10% lanoline, 1% Oleum lavandule and 85% vaseline. The second category of salves has different constituents excepting the bioactive compounds and Oleum lavandule: 4% cethylic alcohol, 2% white wax, 14% lanoline, 3% stearyc acid and 72% castor-oil. The purpose of this study regards the formulation and control evaluation over 90 days observation period of the six salves with lipid extracts from two molluscs which was consisted from: aspect, color, homogeneity, smell, pH, tension, the penetration method (consistence) and elongation capacity. The results at the final observation period has aloud us to see a difference from the two qualitative salves at consistence parameter which in simple salves are not frame in Reg CEE 796/2002 limits, differences which may be adapted through replacing of one or others ingredients from salves base. In addition, the bioactive compounds from marine mussels represent a source of new nutraceutical products, the exploitation of which is likely to lead to the discovery of new drugs and targets.PP8-20Evidence for antimetastatic action of coenzyme Q10 and GSH on a breast cancer cell lineM.

The overall goal was to study the effect of redox promoting agent on the tumor invasiveness from a single approach. Materials and Methods: MCF-7 was incubated with 1x, 0.5x and 0.25x of 122 lM coenzyme Q 10 , 2 mM N-acetyl cysteine and 20 lM Buthionine Sulfoximine on 6, 15, 24 and 48 hour manner. Integrity and H 2 O 2 content of cells were measured by DCFH-DA with FACS, and the released MMP-2 activity was measured by Gelatin Zymography and analyzed.Results: Large negative correlations were observed between NAC dose and intracellular H 2 O 2 . Furthermore, a large positive correlation was observed between BSO and intracellular H 2 O 2 and MMP-2 activity merely in the 6 hour co-incubation. In the case of CoQ 10 , large negative correlations were observed in almost all thesamples between CoQ 10 dose and intracellular H 2 O 2 quantity and MMP-2 activity (n = 4, p < 0.05). Conclusion: As it has been outlined in previous studies, NAC has the ability to inhibit the oxidation of zinc-cysteine band by annihilating the oxidative agents as a scavenging antioxidant. Our finding of BSO elevating the pro-oxidants status of the cell meets with the previous observations. Nevertheless, we found this phenomenon parallel to MMP-2 activity increase. The MMP-2 response to the CoQ 10 might indicate a strong congruity between CoQ 10 dose and MMP-2 activity mitigation which would itself necessitates more practical approaches to conclude a clinical effective anti-metastatic property for CoQ 10 therapeutic regimen.L.

Immobilization is a useful technique for improving enzyme activity in reusability, possibility of continuous process, rapid termination of reactions, controlled product formation and easy enzyme removal from the reaction mixture. Materials and Methods: A lipase was purified from oleaginous seeds of Pachira aquatica (Peres-Polizelli et al. App. Biochem. Biotech., 2008, In press). Lipolytic activity was estimated by spectrophotometry using p-nitrophenyl palmitate as substrate and by alkali titration using soybean oil. The assay was performed for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Alginate beads were prepared by ionic gelation using CaCl 2 as the cross-linking agent. Results: The lipase has 55 kDa, exhibiting highest activity at 40\u00b0C and pH 8.0. The activity increased in the presence of Ca ++ and Mg ++ , being inhibited by Hg ++ , Mn ++ , Zn ++ and Al +++ . The hydrolysis rate for nitrophenylesters was: myristate > caprate > palmitate > stearate > butyrate >acetate. The immobilized enzyme was more stable than the free one, and used up to six times without loss of enzyme activity. Conclusions: The isolated lipase could be used for different purposes, and the time dependent natural loss of activity can be significantly prevented by immobilization.Financial support: CAPES (PPP), FAPESP and CNPq (GOBR). the university and the public school N.

Baumanis 1 Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, Riga, LATVIA, 2 Riga Stradins University, Riga, LATVIAIntroduction: There is increasing evidence that some mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphisms are involved in ageing due to influence on the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. mtDNA haplogroup J has been reported to increase the individual chance to attain longevity in northern Italians and Finns, haplogroup K -in French and Irish. The aims of our research were: to verify if there is a link between mtDNA polymorphisms and ageing in Latvian population; to compare the level of heteroplasmy in mtDNA control region in three age groups. Methods: Objects for mtDNA polymorphisms analysis were 351 healthy unrelated Latvians 18-40 years old, 98 aged 74-89 years and 74 aged above 90 years. mtDNA haplogroups and point mutations were determined by PCR-RFLP analysis and direct DNA sequencing. Objects for heteroplasmy detection were 100 unrelated Latvians: 40 ranging in age from 18 to 40 years, 30 from 74 to 89 years and 30 above 90 years. In order to detect heteroplasmy the DGGE analysis was used. Results: The frequencies of haplogroups I and U4 were significantly lower, but that of haplogroup U5a significantly higher in the older age group (74-89 years) than in younger individuals. In the youngest age group point heteroplasmy was detected in six individuals (15%) at two positions, among individuals above 90 years old in eight cases (26, 6%) at six different positions. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that certain inherited mtDNA polymorphisms may promote longevity. The mtDNA heteroplasmy level gradually increases with age, besides more heteroplasmic positions in the older age group were revealed.C. Camargo 1 , R. A. Silva 1 , C. L. Yano 1 , R. R. R.

The Walker 256 carcinosarcoma (W256) presents an aggressive biological behavior, local invasive growth and high metastasis potential. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a class of proteinases capable of extracellular matrix degradation. Increased MMP-2 activity is associated with advanced tumor stages. In this work, we described an in vivo therapeutic treatment with quercetin on rats bearing W256. Methods: Rats bearing W256 were treated with different daily doses (10, 15, 25 and 35 mg/kg) of quercetin i.p., for 50 days. Rats and tumors weights were assessed three times a week. Survival and dose response (ED 50 ) were also determined. MMP-2 activity was assayed in liver extracts using gelatin zymography. Results: The quercetin dose of 10 mg/kg inhibited about 50% tumors growth (ED 50 ) in comparison with control animals (CTR). Rats bearing W256 treated with this quercetin dose showed that the MMP-2 activity decreased 0.67-fold (p < 0.001) in comparison with CTR. Conclusion: According to our results the inhibition of tumors growth observed through the tumors weight, survival and reduction of MMP-2 activity in treated animals strongly confirm the anticancer function of quercetin as a chemotherapeutic agent.

Methods: Forty four volunteers with prostate cancer (age 69.9 \u00b1 9.0 years) and seventy nine volunteers with BPH (age 67.2 \u00b1 9.4 years) were included in this study and compared with thirty three volunteers without any prostate disease complaint (65.3 \u00b1 10.1 years). Total and free PSA measurements were quantitated with solid phase chemiluminescent method on Immulite 2000 (Diagnostic Products Corporation). Lipids were extracted from serum samples and the serum phospholipids were separated from the neutral lipids by thin layer chromatography. The fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed on a Varian 3800 gas-liquid chromatograph (Palo Alto, CA) with a capillary column. Results: Interestingly, only two fatty acids in the cancer group showed statistically significant differences from controls; myristoleic acid (14:1) being higher and eicosatrienoic acid within the omega-3 fatty acid family (20:3 n-3) being lower. However, only the myristoleic acid was significantly higher than both controls and the BPH group, respectively. Conclusions: The higher myristoleic acid status in patients with prostate cancer could possibly serve in a compensatory and protective capacity or at a promontory manner at the level at the cellular level with respect to prostatic carcinogenesis. More extensive studies are needed to determine if dietary and/or blood levels of myristoleic acid, when measured in the future, show correlations with prostate cancer.M. Can 1 , S. Acikgoz 1 , G.

Methods: Fasting serum samples were obtained for lipid analysis from 1001 patients. Total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels were measured with enzymatic methods and the measurements of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL-C levels were detected using direct methods. Results: The mean levels of serum TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C were detected within the normal reference range. The LDL-C estimated by the Friedewald formula was significantly correlated (P < 0.01) with the direct method but there was a negative bias among them. When evaluating the results according to the different levels of triglycerides, a positive bias observed with direct method, although the method has excellent correlation coefficient (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Laboratories can not use direct method as a substitute for Friedewald formula because direct method has not been standardized in large populations and increase cholesterol assay costs.Conclusion: In our study 5'NT ve ADA enzyme activities are determined high level in both CCL4 and SC groups.

Methods: We evaluated the in vitro phosphorylation of peptide arrays exhibiting the majority of PhosphoBase-deposited protein sequences on lysates from pre-osteoblastic cultured with ascorbic acid and beta-glycerol phosphate (traditional osteogenesis inductors) for 7 days. Some kinases which displayed differential activities were validated by Western blot technique. The synthesis of collagen type I, alkaline phosphatase activity and bone markers expression (osteocalcin, osteopontin and Runx2) were also examined to confirm the osteoblastic differentiation process. Results: Among the activated kinases identified, mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3K and AKT were significantly altered. The up or downregulated expressed kinases covered a broad range of functional activities: (1) cellular communication and signal transduction; (2) nucleic acid synthesis and processing; (3) Cellular organization; (4) Storage and transport; (5) Energy and metabolism; (6) Protein synthesis processing and protein fate. Conclusions: These data show that kinome profiling using arrays of consensus peptides might have a broad application for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying osteoblastic differentiation. Besides, this technique could contribute for more accurate diagnosis, effective disease monitoring, and development of targeted and specific therapies of bone diseases.PP8-38Significance of the conserved Asn345 and Asn435 residues in the catalytic activity of Bacillus kaustophilus leucine aminopeptidase as evaluated by site-directed mutagenesisM.-C. Chi 1,2 , H. Huang 2 and L.-L. Lin 3 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, TAIWAN, 2 Department of Life Sciences and Institute of Molecular Biology, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, TAIWAN, 3 Department of Applied Chemistry, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, TAIWANIntroduction: Leucine aminopeptidase (LAP; EC 3.4.11.1) is a cytosolic exopeptidase that selectively removes N-terminal amino acid residues from peptides and proteins. In this study, directed evolution strategy was pursued to characterize the role of Asn345 and Asn435 residues situated in the vicinity of the putative active-site residues of Bacillus kaustophilus LAP (BkLAP). Methods: The experimental procedures include site-directed mutagenesis, homology modeling, protein expression, metal analysis, tryptophan emission fluorescence, and circular dichroism. Results: We investigated the role of the conserved Asn345 and Asn435 residues by performing computer modeling and site-directed mutagenesis. Based on the modeling, these two residues interact with the carbonyl group of Ala348, where these interactions might maintain the zinc-coordinated residues at their correct positions. Replacement of Ala345 with Gln or Leu resulted in a dramatic reduction in LAP activity. A complete loss of the activity was observed in Asn435 variants. Measurement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence revealed alteration of the microenvironment of aromatic amino acid residues, while circular dichroism spectra were nearly identical for wild-type and all mutant enzymes. Conclusions: In conclusion, site-directed mutagenesis results provide the definitive evidence that residues Asn345 and Asn435 are crucial for the proper function of BkLAP. Protein modeling suggests that these two residues might play an important role in the maintenance of zinccoordinated environment of the enzyme.

Evaluation of wild plant from stress environments may lead to identification of novel peroxidases. Evergreen parasitic plants are continuously exposed to a wide range of abiotic and biotic stresses. To prospect these bioresource field surveys of Western Ghats region were carried out and individuals of different species of mistletoe were collected. Methods: Total protein was extracted and fractionated by salting out. Different salt saturated protein fractions were subjected to gel-based peroxidase assay. Distinct activity was detected in one mistletoe species. The fraction showing peroxidase activity was subjected to ionexchange chromatography (DEAE-Sephadex A50). LCMS-MS analyses of the purified peroxidase was carried out. Results: Under reducing and non-reducing conditions, the SDS-PAGE profile showed a distinct 60 kDa band, however, plant peroxidases belong to class III family which is characterized with 28-44 kDa molecular mass. Staining with periodic acid-schiff's reagent confirmed its glycoproteinaceous nature. It showed excellent peroxidase activity with different substrates. LCMS-MS analyses showed its low homology with the other known plant peroxidases Conclusion: The 60 kDa peroxidase purified and characterized in the present study is novel. Its detailed characterization may help to establish potential use of a wild parasitic plant of Western Ghats. The purified peroxidase might have significance in environmental protection and development of industrial products.",

We have recently shown that the open reading frame Rv2984 of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome sequence encodes a functional polyphosphate kinase (PPK1 Mtb). In this study, we further characterized purified PPK1 Mtb for its substrates as well as functional domains responsible for enzyme activity. To the end, we synthesized polyP in vitro from ATP, GTP, or ADP as a substrate. Also, a set of deleted version of PPK1 Mtb was constructed and tested their enzymatic activity. Our results showed that PPK1 Mtb was able to use all three nucleotides as a substrate and the C-terminal 150 amino acids were important for the enzyme activity. Taken together these results indicate that PPK1 Mtb is a muti-functional enzyme.D. Iwanaga, M. Tanaka, R. Nagasaka and H. Ushio Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, Tokyo, JAPAN",

Albulescu 1 , C. Tanase 1 , E. Codorean 1 , D. Boda 2 and S. M. Popescu 2 Victor Babes National Institute, Bucharest, ROMANIA, 2 Colentina Clinical Hospital, Bucharest, ROMANIA Introduction: Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a common invalidating disease where the blood stasis is often associated with ischemia and inflammatory mediators that actively contribute to local inflammatory degradative pattern maintenance. The purpose of our study was to quantify soluble matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs) associated to leg ulcer wound fluid in comparison with the tissue localized ones and evaluate their disease prognosis potential. Methods: Sterile fluid was harvested during surgery and a procedure was established for obtaining a completely clear sample. Soluble MMPs detection used Luminex IS 200 System and xMAP technology (Fluorokine_ MAP multiplex kit Human MMP) for the following soluble MMPs: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13. Soluble TIMP-1 was as well detected by means of ELISA using Quantikine Human TIMP-1 Immunoassay. Electrophoregram of the fluid samples was performed using Experion electrophoretic microfluidics system. Results: Due to the individual protein pattern of the harvested fluids, specific MMP or inhibitor activities were related to the total protein concentration of each fluid sample. Comparing the values obtained from normal sera (at the same protein concentration) in the CVI fluids MMP9 values are 4x more elevated, MMP2 2x and MMP1 19x, while their inhibitor TIMP1 is 200x reduced. The studied patients did not present any abnormal seric values of MMPs and TIMP1. Conclusion: Various patterns of soluble MMPs and TIMP-1 were associated with the disease progression, but overall a higher MMPs value and lower TIMP1 indicated a poor healing score in CVI. Chronic venous insufficieny is a common invalidating disease and evaluation of soluble matrixmetalloproteinases pattern in the leg ulcer fluid can be a valuable biomarker associated with disease progression.PP8-133Analysis of polysaccharide from Bifidobacterium G.

Despite the widespread use of live attenuated vaccine since 1963, it still causes approximately one half million death in the world, annually. Measles Virus has two envelope glycoproteins: The H protein which has a key role in tropism, receptor binding, hemagglutinating activity and the F protein which. is responsible for the membrane fusion, and spreading the infection in the body. Both proteins can induce immune system to produce neutralizing antibody against virus. In this regard they can be used for combined recombinant vaccine production. In this study the gateway baculovirus insect cell expression system has been used as a means of expressing measles H and F genes. Methods: Measles Virus (AIK-C strain) genome was extracted from infected Vero cells. Then, H and F gene were amplified by specific primers during RT-PCR reaction and inserted into the intermediate vector (pDONR221) using BP recombination reaction. Recombinant baculovirus harboring H and F genes were consequently constructed by LR reaction, prepared by BaculoDirect TM Expression System kit. In next step, insect cells (Sf9) were infected with recombinant baculovirus In order to increase viral titer, recombinant baculoviruses were passaged four times in Sf9 cells. Synthesis of H and F proteins were verified by SDS-PAGE, western-blot and indirect immunoflourescene using goat polyclonal antibody against Measles Virus. Results and Conclusion: The H and F proteins were partially glycosylated and cleaved respectively, but it appeared that both of them were biologically active. Antibody against these recombinant proteins can neutralized virus infection in cell culture.PP8-165The effect of pre-conditionary hepatic ischemia on intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injuryI. C.

Some beneficial effects have been attributed to the wellknown antioxidant activity of procyanidins. In this study, we investigated another potential role of procyanidins in cholesterol influx and efflux and inflammation in macrophage-derived foam cells. Methods and Results: We cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages with highly oxidized LDL (oxLDL), moderately oxidized LDL (moxLDL) or with LPS (0.5 lg/ml) and oxLDL (LPS + oxLDL) to induce foam cell. Then, cells were treated with procyanidins derived from grape seed (PE, 45 lg/ml) for the last 12 hours of incubation with the different lipoproteins (25 lg/ml). After lipid extraction, we determined that total and esterified cholesterol and triglyceride accumulation in foam cells were increased by lipoprotein treatment but reduced by PE incubation in all the foam-cell models. In order to asses the effect of PE on gene expression we determined the relative mRNA levels of CD36, ABCA1, iNOS and IkBa by RT-PCR. We show that PE reduced the oxLDL scavenger receptor expression (CD36), and enhanced ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette A1) expression, a key regulator of macrophage cholesterol efflux, thus reducing lipid influx and inducing its efflux. PE also downregulated inflammatory related genes such as iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) and IkBa (kappa beta inhibitor-alpha). Conclusion: We provide evidence that procyanidins may attenuate the development of foam cell formation by reducing cholesterol accumulation through the modulation of key genes in cholesterol flux and inflammation. Introduction: According to the data of WHO, in 1990 the percentage of infertile families reached 20%, and in 50% the infertility is connected with men's reproductive ability. Decrease in concentration and motility of sperm is observed in the world. Therefore, investigation of factors affecting the sperm motility is relevant. Methods: Sperm motility was determined using Gorjaev's chamber and expressed as the percentage of the motile sperms relative to the total number of sperms. Results: It was shown that oxidants (hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions) decreased significantly (by 50-100%) the sperm motility. The sperm-specific isoform of glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDs) was inactivated in the sperms treated with oxidants. It is suggested that oxidants decrease the sperm motility due to the oxidation of the sulfhydryl groups of GAPDs, a key glycolytic enzyme that is necessary for sperm motility. Interestingly, sodium citrate (pH 7.5) above 30 mM decreased the sperm motility by 90-100% after 5 minutes of incubation. The mechanism remains unclear. Significant increase in the sperm motility (by 20-35%) was observed in the presence of calcium ions. Conclusion: The sperm motility was shown to decrease in the presence of oxidants and sodium citrate and to increase in the presence of calcium ions. Oxidants decrease the sperm motility due to the oxidation of the sulfhydryl groups of GAPDs, a key glycolytic enzyme. The role of citrate and calcium is discussed.

Recently, we reported an overall 'nitrile pathway' (aldoxime -> nitrile -> amide -> acid -> acyl-CoA) comprising aldoxime dehydratase, NHase, amidase and acyl-CoA synthetase (AcsA) of Pseudomonas chlororaphis B23 (2). AcsA forms a carbon-sulfur bond in the presence of ATP and Mg 2+ , yielding acyl-CoA thioesters from the corresponding free acids and CoA. Very recently, we discovered amide (peptide) bond synthetic activity of AcsA. When L-cysteine was used as a substrate instead of CoA, N-acyl-L-cysteine was detected as a reaction product. Results: Acyl-CoA synthetase belongs to the superfamily of adenylateforming enzymes, whose three-dimensional structures are analogous to one another. We confirmed that amide (peptide) bond synthetic activity was also observed for acetyl-CoA synthetase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae which belongs to the superfamily. These results indicate that acetyl-CoA synthetase and acyl-CoA synthetase from not only prokaryotes but also eukaryotes would exhibit N-acylation activity generally. Luciferase also belongs to the superfamily, although the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of luciferin in the presence of ATP and O 2 to generate oxyluciferin and light (hm). We found that firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase catalyzes the N-acyl-L-cysteine synthetic reaction (amide bond synthesis). These findings indicate the generality of the new reaction in the superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes. ",

High plasma PAI-1 level is a risk factor for thrombotic diseases such as myocardial infraction, stroke, and venous thromboembolism. PAI-1 is an early response gene known to be activated by hormones, cytokines, lipoprotein, angiotensin II, phorbol ester, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The purpose of the present study was to establish whether or not an enhanced oxidative stress involving endothelial injury, activation of coagulation, and inflammatory reaction would induce an expression of PAI-1, t-PA, uPA or uPAR. Human endothelial cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (100, 200 lM), sodium nitroprusside (1-100 lM) and oxidative stress were determined by lucigenin chemiluminescence and 2,7, dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence, respectively. PAI-1, tPA, uPA and uPAR transcription were determined by transfection of PAI-1, t-PA, uPA and uPAR promoter linked to a luciferase reporter. Ap1, Sp1 and NF and #954; B activity was determined by an electrophoresis mobility shift assay. Expression of PAI-1, t-PA, uPA and uPAR in vascular endothelial cells studied using microarray assay and confirmed by real time PCR.Introduction: Thromboxane A2 induces platelet aggregation and constriction of vascular and bronchial smooth muscle through the interaction with a G protein-coupled receptor that exists as two alternatively splice variants, termed TPa and TPb with different C-terminal cytoplasmic tails. TPa and TPb are usually co-expressed in native cells and form homo-and hetero-oligomers in transfected cells. Methods: Computational modelling techniques [1, 2] were first used to generate models of TPa monomer in free-and agonist-bound conformations, then subjected to docking simulations for modelling of TPa homo-dimers. Theoretical predictions were challenged by sitedirected mutagenesis of TPa and TPb. Wild type and mutant receptors fused to fluorescent proteins (GFP, CFP, YFP) were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells and their subcellular localization and dimerization studied by a combination of microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques. Results: The most supported model of TPa homo-dimer was characterized by contacts between helices 1 of monomers, whereby cysteine 35 residues lie at a distance predictive of an inter-helical disulphide bridge. Upon substitution of cysteine 35 with alanine (C35A) homo-and hetero-dimerization of TPa and TPb as well as TPa trafficking was greatly impaired. However, C35A mutant TP receptors did not significantly differ from wild type in terms of [3H]-SQ29, 548 antagonist binding and accumulation of inositol phosphates induced by U46619 agonist stimulation. Conclusions: Mutation of cysteine 35 greatly impairs dimerization of TP receptors as anticipated by computational modelling but leaves unaffected the binding and signalling properties of monomeric receptors.

SARA, an early endosomal FYVE finger protein, plays a leading role in this pathway by recruiting non-phosphorylated SMAD proteins to the receptor complex for phosphorylation. Furthermore, SARA also mediates receptor dephosphorylation by recruiting PP1 phosphatase to the activated receptor. Recently SARA has been shown to regulate the vesicular targeting of the photoreceptor protein Rhodopsin to newly synthesized discs. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of SARA action, we have undertaken the task of identifying additional SARA-interacting proteins. A yeast-two-hybrid screen identified the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and PDZ domain-containing protein ERBIN as a binding partner of SARA. We have confirmed the interaction of ERBIN and SARA by pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation and have mapped the interaction domains on both partners. Furthermore, we have found that ERBIN is present on the early endocytic compartment and it also interacts with Activin Receptors. We have addressed the physiological role of this interaction using lossof-function approaches (siRNA) and we have observed that knockdown of the endogenous ERBIN enhances TGF-b/Activin-induced transcriptional responses, while gain-of-function reduces TGF-b/Activin-induced transcriptional responses. Thus, ERBIN appears to be a novel negative regulator of the TGF-b/Activin pathway. *These authors contributed equally.",

Moncelli 1 1 Dipartimento di Chimica, Universita\u00b4di Firenze, Florence, ITALY 2 Dipartimento di Chimica, Universita\u00b4di Roma 'La Sapienza', Rome, ITALY Introduction: The peptaibols are a family of antibiotic peptides isolated from soil fungi that exhibit anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. The name peptaibol derives from their chemical composition: peptides containing Aib (a-amminoisobutyric acid or a-methyl alanine) residues and ending in a C-terminal alchol. Trichogin is one of the shortest peptaibols (11 residues) and it has a fatty acyl moiety linked to the N-terminal amino acid (n-octanoyl). Trichogin is too short to fully span a membrane, so its mechanism of action must be different from the long peptaibols, like alamethicin forming voltage-gated channel. Methods: We are studying these peptaibols using a new experimental model of biological membrane [1] . This model is constituted of a polycarbonate membrane with 1 lm diameter holes, covered by an octadecanthiol (ODT) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on Au. The bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs) spontaneously self-assemble on the holes of the polycarbonate membrane. The characterization and stability of the nanoBLMs have been characterized by electrochemical measurements: cyclic voltammetry, AC voltammetry and Impedance Spectroscopy. Results: We identified the typical range of values of specific resistance, specific capacitance and conductance for well formed nanoBLMs: 0.1MX<R*cm 2 <10 MX 0.4microF<C/ cm 2 <1microF and 0<j<5 microS/cm respectively. By means of specific resistance data, we furthermore proved that nanoBLMs can last up to 24 hours. Conclusion: We set up the protocol to incorporate the trichogin in the phospholipidic bilayer and to study its selectivity.

We examined the conditions of the luminescence development (luminol-, lucegenin-dependent and spontaneous chemiluminescence) when the cells interacted with ONOO ) . With AFM methods we investigated the morphology and surface structure of neutrophils treated with ONOO -, adhered to glass slabs, fixed with glutaraldehyde and dried. The intensity of the chemiluminescence accompanying the neutrophil interaction with ONOO ) increased with increasing in pH level (in range of 5-9) and ONOO ) concentration (in range of 0.005-1.0 mM). The luminol-dependent chemiluminescence kinetics was characterized by the presence of some stages during which the generation of superoxide anion radicals, nitrogen monoxide and myeloperoxidase reaction products were observed. ONOO-induced spontaneous chemiluminescence of neutrophils was enhanced (5-15-fold) after the pre-incubation of the cells with such neutrophil stimulating agents as fMLP and latex. Atomic force microscopy analysis of neutrophil surface showed that 0.1 mM ONOO) induced neutrophil spreading on glass surface and neutrophil degranulation. The increase of the incubation time led to the increase in the spreading and degranulation levels of ONOO-treated neutrophils and to the damage of neutrophil through the NET (neutrophil extracellular traps) mechanism (after incubation for 3 hour). The findings are evidence of the modulation of some neutrophilic functions by exogenous ONOO ) .",

In sea urchin egg, the cADPr (cyclic ADP ribose) and the IP 3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) pathways are both necessary to generate the fertilization Ca i signal. In this study, we demonstrate that PLCc (phospholipase C c) control both fertilization and mitosis Ca i signals. Methods: PLCc contains two SH2 domains allowing interaction with phospho-tyrosine residues. Fusion proteins containing the N-ter and/or C-ter SH2 domain(s) and an histidine 'tag' were generated (His-SH2-PLCc). Proteins that are not functionnal carrying R253A (N-ter SH2) and R364A (C-ter SH2) mutations, which prevents interaction with phospho-tyrosine residues, were used as controls. All constructions were injected before or after fertilization and Ca i was mesured using a fura-2 fluorescent probe (Axon Inst. Image Analysis System). Results: Our results indicate that inhibiting the PLCc pathway did not prevent the fertilization Ca i signal. All control mutated constructs were without effect. However, we found that the C-ter SH2 domain only was capable of inhibiting mitosis. Conclusion: Our results clearly show that PLCc is not sufficient to trigger the fertilization Ca i signal, contrary to what is widely accepted in the litterature. However, PLCc is absolutely necessary to control progression through the first mitotic divisions.Introduction: In recent years, there is increasing interest towards the development of analytical methods for testing the authenticity of food products commanding a premium price. Coffee is an important food commodity worldwide. The commercial trade consists almost entirely of the Arabica and Robusta species. The former is considered to be of superior quality and thus attracts a premium price. We have developed a rapid, simple and robust method that allows detection of the two species based on the genotyping of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the chloroplastic genome. Methods: DNA is isolated from coffee green beans and the segments that span the SNP of interest are amplified by PCR. Following purification, the products are subjected to two primer extension (PEXT) reactions in the presence of biotin-dUTP, using allele-specific primers that contain a (dA) 30 segment. The products are detected visually by a dry-reagent dipstick-type biosensor, in which the extension products are captured from immobilized streptavidin on the test zone of the sensor and detected by hybridization with oligo(dT)-functionalized gold nanoparticles forming a red line. A second red line is generated at the control zone of the biosensor by hybridization of the nanoparticles with immobilized oligo(dA). Results: Coffee amplicon mixtures were analyzed with this technique allowing clear discrimination of the two alleles. The dipstick test is complete within 10 minutes. Conclusions: The proposed dipstick assay is rapid and enables visual detection of either deliberate or accidental adulteration without the need for special instrumentation or highly qualified technical personnel.",

Kyriakides 1,3 1 Laboratory of Biochemistry, Department of Chemistry , Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, GREECE, 2 Pure and Applied Biochemistry, Chemical Center, Lund University, Lund, SWEDEN,   3 National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, GREECE Molecular imprinting is widely used for the preparation of polymeric materials containing recognition sites of predetermined specificity. Imprinted binding sites are generated by co-polymerization of a functional monomer with a cross-linker in the presence of a template molecule. Removal of the template molecule from the formed polymer results in cavities within the polymer that is complementary to the template. Consequently, the polymer is able to rebind the template molecule with high affinity and specificity, in a manner comparable to antibody-antigen or receptor-ligand binding. In this work, MIPs selective for histamine were synthesized by bulk polymerization using methacrylic acid as functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as cross-linker. Binding affinity of imprinted polymers for histamine and structurally related compounds was studied in both organic and aqueous medium. The specific binding sites of imprinted polymer selectively recognize histamine over L-Histidine under aqueous conditions. When polymers were tested against other biogenic amines in aqueous media, MIPs were capable of binding three times more histamine than putrescine. Binding analysis of histamine imprinted polymers with histamine receptor antagonists and compounds related to histamine action was studied as well. In organic media, MIPs selectively recognized histamine over dimentidene, ranitidine and fluoxetine. In aqueous media MIPs bound two times more histamine than ranitidine when 0.3% (v/v) Tween 20 was added. Selectivity of MIPs over structurally and functionally related compounds in aqueous environment makes feasible its potential bioanalytical applications.

Their long term colloidal stability is ensured by coating the nanoparticles with appropriate polymers, e.g. polysaccharides, to prevent aggregation and render these nanoparticles useful in medical diagnosis and therapy. Methods: Coated maghemite nanoparticles were prepared by mixing acidic iron solutions and added over in alkaline solution of NaOH. 1 wt% of dextran was added in the acidic media. Then 0.18 ml of ferrofluid (3.6 mg of maghemite) was injected in glioma C6 tumours grown in mice to 0.5 \u00b7 0.5 mm, in adult male Wistar rats. Following magnetic hyperthermia treatment for about 20 minutes the remaining glioma cell tumors were excised and processed for light microscopy. Results: Specifically in sites of ferrofluid injection but not in adjacent areas of tumour or normal tissue, nanoparticle-induced hyperthermia to 44\u00b0C via application of a magnetic field (temperature was monitored by an optical fibre thermometer), resulted in cell dissolution or cell damage: the remaining cells were deformed and appeared to be apoptotic with dense and fragmented nuclei, compared to the appearance of healthy cells in tumour areas free of ferrofluid. Apparently then the maghemite nanoparticles were able, by locally raising the temperature to interfere with cell viability and caused nanoparticle-targeted cell dissolution or cell death. Conclusions: The maghemite nanoparticles, because of their properties to conduct heat can be used as means to therapeutically intervene in massive tumours of the CNS by targeted tumour cell disruption and apoptosis. Introduction: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small enveloped DNA virus, causing acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and considered a significant health problem worldwide. The proteins of HBV are the surface protein, the core protein and DNA polymerase. The HBV core genes codes for two different proteins; HBc antigen and HBe antigen (HBeAg). Presence of HBeAg in the sera of HBV infected individuals may indicate the high infectivity of the disease and poor prognosis of the disease treatment, so detection of HBeAg is important in clinical diganosis. Methods: One of the sensitive and commonly used methods to differentiate the type of viral infection and discriminate between acute and chronic hepatitis is ELISA, based on the use of monoclonal antibodies. In this study, BALB/c mice were immunized with HBeAg expressing M13 phage for the production of monoclonal antibodies specific for HBe antigen. It was expressed on the M13 phage by cloning of HBe gene into phagemid, transferring into E.coli TG1 and infection of positive clones with M13 helper phages. Results and Conclusion: After three subsequent immunization of BALB/c mice with HBe-phage, lymphocytes were isolated and fused with F0 myeloma cells. In order to maximize the probability of generating monoclonal antibodies, lymphocytes from spleen, lymph nodes and intraperitonal fluid were used. After selection of positive clones with ELISA, it was found that out of 690 hybrid clones, 10D12 was producing antibody recognizing both HBe antigen and human serum, whereas 5G12 was producing monoclonal antibody specific only for M13 phage.",

            "text": "A study for determining the direct effect of myeloperoxidase enzyme on doxorubicin Y. Basaran and H. Kuzu Yildiz Technical University, Bioengineering Department, Istanbul, TURKEY Introduction: Myeloperoxidase (MPO, EC 1.11.1.7) is an enzyme found in polymorphonuclear neutrophils and monocytes, and some populations of tissue macrophages. Myeloperoxidase plays an important role in the defense system against invading microorganisms and certain tumor killing actions via myeloperoxidase-H 2 O 2 -Clreaction system. Myeloperoxidase oxidizes various compounds such as phenols, anilines and their derivatives, and also b-diketons which may lead to the formation of free radicals. It has been hypothesized that peroxidase-catalyzed drug oxidation causes radical production, protein binding and oxidative stress cytotoxicity, and thereby contributes to reactive metabolite formation and cell death. This hypothesis includes the finding that peroxidase catalyzes the oxidation of drugs, carcinogens or xenobiotics to form radicals that cooxidize biomolecules and form reactive oxygen species [1] . From this standpoint, myeloperoxidase may cause free radical formation in drug metabolism. Methods: Myeloperoxidase was purified for the first time at sufficient amounts for laboratory scale experiments with good activity. The intensive effect of purified myeloperoxidase on Doxorubicin was studied for the first time. The reaction products which was formed at physiological temperature and pH (37\u00b0C; pH 7.2-7.3) were evaluated by using UV-Vis. spectrophotometer, FT-IR and LC-MS spectrometer systems. Results: The results obtained with UV-Vis spectrophotometer implied that the reaction took place. Occured reaction was clarified by evaluating FT-IR and LC-MS results for the products. Conclusions: The obtained data showed that Doxorubicin was fragmented with the formation of free radicals. Introduction: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV/CD26, EC 3.4.14.5) is a glycoprotein with multiple functions. As a serine protease, it could activate or inactivate biologically important peptides, involved in chronic diseases pathogenesis. Therefore, it could play an important role in the modulation of the immune response during inflammatory processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in serum DPP IV activity in adult patients with chronic diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD): Crohn's disease -CD and ulcerative colitis -UC; and rheumatoid diseases: rheumatoid arthritis -RA, psoriatic arthritis -PA, and patients with osteoporosis -OP. Methods: The diagnosis of CD, UC, RA, PA and OP were established on the basis of clinical history, laboratory, endoscopic and histological data. The control group included healthy blood donors. The serum DPP IV activity has been measured spectrofotometrically using Gly-Pro p-nitroanilide as substrate. Results: Serum DPP IV activities in patients with IBD (CD and UC) and RA were statistically significantly decreased compared with the levels in healthy controls (P < 0.001). In patients with PA and OP, serum DPP IV activities were not statistically significantly different from healthy controls. No statistically significant difference in the serum DPP IV activity between patients with CD and UC was found (P > 0.05). Conclusions: The results of this study sustained the statement that the serum DPP IV is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases. The serum DPP IV activity appears to be useful as an available, non-invasive marker in the diagnosis of the disease activity. Introduction: Since embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived neural progenitors (NPs) have the potential to cure many diseases, knowledge of the signaling mechanisms that regulate their proliferation and differentiation is critical. We discovered the presence of functional mu opioid receptor (MOR) and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) in ES cells and NPs. To explore the relationship between opioids and ES cell-derived NP fate, we examined retinoic acid (RA) induced NP proliferation and differentiation upon opioid treatment. Method: An immunocytochemistry approach was taken that involved cell specific and BrdU antibodies to measure cell division and differentiation in NPs, treated with DAMGO (MOR agonist) or U69,593 (KOR agonist) for 1 or 5 days. Results: Both opioids inhibited NP proliferation and ES cell derived neurogenesis and astrogenesis. Some of these inhibitory effects were extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) dependent. In contrast, mu and kappa opioids increased the number of proliferating ES-cell derived NG2 + oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPs). MOR and KOR immunoreactivity was detected in oligodendrocytes at three stages of their development. By using selective inhibitors, we found that the opioid induced proliferation of OPs was ERK but not p38 kinase mediated. Opioids did not affect proliferation of immature oligodendrocytes. Conclusion: Collectively, these results reveal that opioids can play a modulatory role in determining NP fate decisions. We have extensively studied the biological metabolism toxic compounds containing a triple bond between carbon and nitrogen such as nitrile (R-CN) (1) and isonitrile (R-NC). As for the latter compound, we discovered a novel enzyme that catalyzes the hydration isonitrile to the corresponding N-substituted formamide (R-NHCHO) in Pseudomonas putida N19-2 and named it isonitrile hydratase (2) . We recently discovered a novel enzyme, N-substituted formamide deformylase (NfdA) which catalyzes the hydrolysis N-substituted formamide to the corresponding amine and formate in Arthrobacter pascens F164 (3). Results: A. pascens F164 was able to degrade not only N-benzylformamide (which is an N-substituted formamide) but also the corresponding isonitrile, benzyl isocyanide. In the reaction the cell-free extracts prepared from the cells grown on media containing benzyl isocyanide as the sole nitrogen source, the isonitrile was confirmed to be hydrated to N-benzylformamide, which was further converted into benzylamine and formate by NfdA: isonitrile hydratase and NfdA activities were detected. These findings suggest that both enzymes are closely related in sequential isonitrile metabolism. We searched for an appropriate substrate whose reaction product was not degraded by NfdA and investigated the optimum culture conditions for the formation isonitrile hydratase. The highest enzyme activity was obtained when this strain was cultured in the presence N-benzylformamide as an inducer. This isonitrile hydratase was found to be an inducible enzyme depending on N-benzylformamide. Despite its importance in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, very little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of phospholipase D (PLD) expression. PLD isozymes are significantly co-overexpressed with cancer marker genes in colorectal carcinoma. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment, as a mitogenic signal in colon cancer cells, selectively increases PLD1 expression in transcription and post-transcription. Moreover, experiments using intraperitoneal injection of PMA into mice showed selective PLD1 induction in the intestine and lung tissues, which suggests its physiological relevance in vivo. Therefore, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of the effects of PMA on the promoter activity of PLD genes. Protein kinase C inhibitors, but not a protein kinase A inhibitor, were found to suppress the up-regulation of PLD1 but not PLD2. Dominant-negative mutants of Ras, Raf, and MEK suppressed the induction and activity of PLD1. Moreover, depletion of the supposedly involved proteins reduced the endogenous PLD1 protein level. An important role for NFkappaB as a downstream target of ERK in PMA-induced PLD1 induction was also demonstrated using the inhibitor, small interfering RNA, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and site-specific mutagenesis. Furthermore, inhibitors of these signaling proteins and depletion of PLD1 suppressed PMA-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 secretion and PLD1 induction. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that induction of PLD1 through a protein kinase C/Ras/ ERK/NFkappaB-dependent pathway is involved in the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in colorectal cancer cells.",

            "text": "Endoplasmic reticulum stress and the role of T-cadherin Introduction: Endothelial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. T-cadherin is an atypical GPI-anchored member of the cadherin superfamily. It is up-regulated in atherosclerotic lesion. Grp78, which co-associates with T-cadherin, is a key mediator of endoplasmic reticulum stress. This means that T-cadherin may possibly play a key role in ER stress. Methods: Endothelial cells are treated with ER stress inducing agents. Agents that are used are thapsigargin (1 lM), DTT (1 mM), Brefel-dinA (5 lg/ml), Tunicamycin (3 lg/ml), Calcium Ionophore A23187 (2 lM) and Homocysteine (15 mM). Immunoblotting and quantitative RT-PCR are used in order to determine the modulation of T-cadherin expression during endoplasmic reticulum stress, and for the changes in expression of UPR signaling molecules such as GRP78, ATF3 and phospho-eIF2a. Silencing (use of siRNA) and over-expression of Tcadherin (adenoviral vector system) is used to study the ability of Tcadherin to influence endothelial cell survival responses during ER stress.Results: T-cadherin is elevated in ER stress. Cultured EC after treatment with ER stress inducing agents show increased mRNA and protein levels of T-cad at early time points. GRP78 is gradually elevated through time.Conclusions: The role of these molecules in protection of cardiac and vascular cells from ER stress has to be evaluated. Also new insights into the impact of ER stress signaling in regulation of endothelial function would be given. T-cadherin seems to be a key player in ER stress. This study will shed more light on the mechanism of cardiovascular disorders. Cordyceps sinensis (C. sinensis) is a precious medicinal fungus, which has been used in China since ancient times. In modern scientific studies, C. sinensis possesses several bioativities, such as antitumour, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammation, anti-atherosclerosis and anti-diabetes. Due to the medicinal properties of C. sinensis, it has become increasingly scarce in recent years and the price for wild C. sinensis has increased sharply. Therefore, mycelial fermentation of Cordyceps fungal species is a feasible and sustainable method for producing the medicinal fungus and its active compounds. Methods: Cs-HK1, a Tolypocladium fungus, is a new species isolated from wild C. sinensis and cultivated by liquid fermentation which containing glucose, yeast extract, peptone and trace amount of mineral ions. The exo-polysaccharide (EPS) was isolated from the culture broth by centrifugation; the supernatant was collected and mixed with four volume of 95% (v/v) ethanol for the precipitation of EPS. The EPS precipitate was recovered by centrifugation and freeze-dried. The carbohydrate and protein content of EPS was measured by anthrone sulphuric acid and Lowry method. Results: EPS secreted by the Cs-HK1 mainly consisted of nearly 70% of carbohydrate and 30% of protein. Structural features of EPS were investigated by a GC and FT-IR, the results indicating that EPS has a backbone of b-D-glucose residues. The molecular weight of EPS was monitored by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and showed that EPS is a wide molecular weight range of biopolymer, ranging from several to hundred of kilo-Dalton (kDa). During the in vitro assay, EPS shows a positive effect in both anti-oxidant and immunomodulatory activity. EPS showed the reducing activity with 50.2 lmol Fe (II) g/EPS during the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay. In radical scavenging activity by ABTS assay, 0.5 g/EPS ml could cause 55% of radical inhibition, which equivalence to 33.9 lmol Trolox g/EPS. In the in vitro cell model, EPS can also stimulate the immunocyte activity. ",

A range of yeast species utilizing agroindustrial substrates have been tested for carotenoids formation. Yeast strains of Rhodotorula and Sporobolomyces formed b-carotene as the main pigment together with torulene and torularhodine as minor carotenoids. To increase the yield of these pigments, physiological regulation of the fermentation process has been employed. Molecular changes in yeast cells on genome, proteome and metabolome level were studied using PFGE, 2D-GE, LC/MS/MS and EPR techniques. These studies also revealed that activated biosynthesis of carotenoids by yeasts exposed to stress could be in a part explained by their scavenger characters as a protection against the harmful effect of the environment. During the last decades fast progress has been made within the field of biochemistry of carotenoid biosynthesis in bacteria, fungi, and plants. Although more than 600 different carotenoids have been identified in nature, only a few are used industrially. There are many yeast strains able to produce different carotenoids. However, the heterobasidiomycetous yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, are the only microbial systems with commercial potentials for the production of astaxanthin. In this work three different carotenogenic strains (Sporobolomyces roseus., Rhodotorula gluitinis, Rhodotorula rubria) were enrolled into a comparative study. Each strain was cultivated at optimal growth conditions and in medium with modified carbon and nitrogen sources. Complex substrates as well as some waste materials (whey, rape pressing, potato extract) were used as nutrient source. Some types of exogenous stress were applied too. The production of carotene-enriched biomass was carried out in flasks as well as in laboratory fermentor. As the best pro-ducer of enriched biomass strain Rhodotorula glutinis CCY 20-2-26 was found. Production of biomass in R.glutinis was about 35 g/l. Total carotene enrichment of this biomass about 2.5 mg/g d.w. was obtained. Significant changes in biomass as well as carotenoid production were observed in individual strains according to cultivation conditions. Introduction: Ischemia or oxygen starvation of tissues is observed at cerebral stroke, brain edema, myocardial infarction, and various surgical operations. In mentioned conditions the tissue damage arise from apoptotic mechanism of cell death, which includes initiation of lipids peroxidation and activation of sphingomyelin cycle, comprising the secondary messengers ceramide, sphingosine, sphingosin-1-phosphate. The aim of our investigation was to study the effects of cysteine derivative on the lipid peroxidation processes, contents of sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipid and products of their hydrolytic dissociation, ceramide and sphingosine at hypoxic conditions. Methods: Brain hypoxia in white rats was induced by carotid ligation. Sphingomyelin cycle was studied by thin layer chromatography. Cysteine derivative (cysteine combined with nicotinic acid) was administered intraperitonealy in dose 5 mg/kg. Results: Brain hypoxia leads to the activation of lipid peroxidation, particularly to the level increase of diene conjugates, hydroperoxides and malonic dialdehyde, accompanied by the increase of the sphingosine level, decrease in sphingomyelines, galactosylceramides, and sulphogalactosylceramides content. The treatment by cysteine derivative leads to the normalization of studied parameters.Conclusions: Normalization effect of cysteine derivative is revealed in animals with hypoxia, which could be result of promotion of synthesis of glutathione, effective intracellular antioxidant and the main component of cell defense system in studied conditions.",

Int recognizes two different pairs of recombining sites attP x attB and attL x attR, thus enabling advanced site-specific recombination as a potent tool for gene manipulations. This system was introduced into the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC7120. Two plasmids were consecutively co-introduced by conjugation into Anabaena PCC 7120. One plasmid carries the gene (int) encoding the HK022 Int recombinase, the other carries the excision substrate cassette pglnA-attL-Stop-attR-lacZ, where Stop is a transcription terminator that prevents expression of the lacZ reporter that encodes b-galactosidase. pglnA is the constitutive promoter of glutamine synthetase gene (glnA) in Anabaena. The Int-catalyzed site-specific recombination reaction was monitored by production of b-galactosidase that resulted from the eviction of the transcription terminator (Stop) as a result of the attL x attR excision reaction.

However, there is a generally observed loss in fuel cell durability when enzymes are employed to catalyze these 'biofuel cell' redox reactions.The overall goal of this research project is to understand the factors responsible for the decrease in biofuel cell durability and how these can be prevented thus leading to the development of durable biofuel cell.In this work, we have non-covalently immobilized the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) on diamond nanoparticles (DNP) of 5 nm. Methods: Adsorption behavior and biophysical characterization of ADH at different loading densities and pH's were studied. Characterization of the absorbed protein on DNP surface was done by FT-IR, XPS, SEM and TEM. Furthermore, the activity of the immobilized enzyme at different loading densities was also determined and a release profile was performed.Results: The Langmuir adsorption isotherms revealed a pH dependence, dependant on the charges of both, ADH and DNP. The results of the enzymatic activity revealed that the activity is dependant on the surface coverage. The enzymatic activity increases as the surface coverage is higher. The release profile demonstrated that the absorption was not irreversible.Conclusions: This work demonstrated that DNP can be employed for non-covalent enzyme immobilization. It was found that the enzyme retains its activity after physical adsorption on DNP. Future experiments will include covalent immobilization of the enzyme on DNP and its biophysical characterization.",

Material and Methods: Two hundred Enterobacteriaceae strains belonging in majority to E. coli, followed by Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae) and Enterobacter cloacae species isolated from surfaces in the hospital environment and respectively from different clinical sources were identified both by biochemical and serological tests. Both disc diffusion susceptibility test and microplate dilution technique were used to investigate the antibiotic resistance profile of these bacteria.The rapid test to nitrocephine and isoelectrofocusing techniques were used for the confirmation of the presence and type of beta-lactamases.Results: The enterobacterial strains isolated from surfacess in the hospital environment exhibited high resistance rates to cephuroxime (100%), cephtazidime (100%), ampicillin (98%), cefoxitin (98%), ticarcillin (62%), amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid (53%). 36% of these strains were confirmed for the production of ESBLs and 50% exhibited AMPc inducible beta-lactamases. All tested strains also exhibited high level resistance to tetracyclines (46-53%) and trimetoprim/sulphametoxazole. Curiously, the beta-lactam resistance levels were lower in strains isolated from clinical samples, as well as the incidence of ESBl, attesting the different origin of the clinical strains, which probably, is in a great number of cases endogenic. The clinical strains exhibited higher resistance levels to quinolones and aminoglycosides. Our study is demonstrating the polyclonal origin of the enterobacterial strains circulating in the hospital environment. The healthy effects of flavonoids are largely due to their antioxidant properties but also to their modulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level. The aim of this study was to determine proanthocyanidins' target genes in cholesterol and energy metabolisms in obese rats and in HepG2 cells. To this end, female Wistar rats were fed on a highfat diet (HFD) for 4 months. In the last 10 days some of the rats were treated with an oral dose of proanthocyanidins (25 mg/kg). The HFD increased total cholesterol and LDL-c plasma levels, and the rats' body weight rose by 40%. Moreover, in the cholesterol metabolism, liver mRNA levels of HMGCR reduced and CYP7A1 increased. In the energy metabolism, HFD decreased UCP-2, whereas IDH-3c and COX-5a remained unchanged. Proanthocyanidin administration, on the other hand, decreased LDL-c plasma levels and reduced body weight by 2%. In addition, HMGCR increased and CYP7A1 and COX-5a decreased. To gain further insight into proanthocyanidins' target genes, the Taqman Low Density Array was used with HepG2 cells. They were treated with a 50 mg/l dose for 9 hours. The most important results for cholesterol metabolism were the decrease in ACACA, ABCA1 and SOAT1, and the considerable increase in the LDL-receptor. Several nuclear receptors, including FXR, LXR and RXRa ??were also analysed, and a generalized repression was observed. In conclusion, HFD promotes obesity and dyslipidemia whereas proanthocyanidins act on the cholesterol metabolism both in vivo and in vitro. Several genes are regulated, which suggests an improvement in these pathologies.

Background: Type I collagen plays an important role in maintaining and remodeling tissue architecture. Most of the collagen studies have been investigated using pepsin-hydrolyzed type I collagen (P-col). We found that actinidain-hydrolyzed type I collagen (A-col) shows a poor fibrillogenesis and nano-scale three-dimensional structure. It is not still understood how the superstructure of the collagen self-assembly forms. However, biological function of the collagen such as cell adhesion or migration should be altered. As it is well known that MMP-8 secreted by neutrophil cleaves type I collagen, we confirmed the cell behavior of neutrophil in the enzyme-hydrolyzed collagen assemblies. Methods: We prepared P-col and A-col from chicken skin. Neutrophil was collected from a mouse, and subsequently it was cultured on a plate coated with each collagen assembly. We observed the cell behavior of neutrophil using an ultra-resolution scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi, S-900). Also, we identified the epitope expression on the surfaces of the A-col and P-col using an anti-collagen antibody labeled with gold-particle. Results: We found that the neutrophil adhered and migrated to the Acol assembly, which was clearly different from the P-col. The binding of antibody showed to be significant difference in the epitope expression. Thus, several lines of evidence suggest that the A-col would be responsible for the activation of cell behaviors. Introduction: Atrophy of skeletal muscle is a caused by numerous diseases, including cancer and AIDS. Mechano growth factor (MGF) produced by active muscle appears to be the factor that controls local tissue repair, maintenance, remodeling and exhibits a neuroprotective effect. Therefore, the MGF has a potential to be used in medicines for regenerative capability of skeletal muscle, as well as prevention of neuronal damage. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been applied as host for production of recombinant human MGF. The yeast considered to be a perspective heterological protein producer due to its good secretion folding properties and biosafety. Results: MGF secreting expression cassette that contains synthetic gene under effective GAL1 promoter control has been developed. Two chaperons (BiP and PDi) were introduced in chromosome for folding improvement. Gene of protease B that catalyzes cleavage of MGF has been identified and disrupted. As a result strain synthesing and secreting soluble MGF has been obtained. For confirmation of MGF biological activity the assay on human postnatal myoblast has been carried out. These experiments proved that recombinant MGF showed the same level of biological activity as human MGF intensifying myoblast growth. For increasing MGF production, the conditions for yeast fermentation have been optimized. As a result the total yield of MGF production increased up to 50 mg/l of culture liquid. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain -producer of recombinant human MGF is shown to be a promising tool for enzymes production for bioactive peptides and proteins and therefore can be used for industrial application.",

Methods: a-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from Aspergillus niger CCIM K2 was partially sequenced by Edman degradation and MALDI MS. A gene fragment encoding a putative part of the a-N-acetylgalactosaminidase was amplified using cDNA prepared from Aspergillus niger K2 CCIM. Degenerated PCR primers were designed according to amino acids found in a-Nacetylgalactosaminidase from Aspergillus niger K2 CCIM The full-length coding sequence of a-N-acetylgalactosaminidase was cloned into pET 30a + , and the recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli following induction by IPTG. Results: The cloned DNA consists of 1450 base pairs, and the deduced amino acid sequence (480 amino acid residues with molecular mass 54,814 kDa) is almost identical to that of the purified enzyme (as determinated by SDS-PAGE). Comparison of this amino acid sequence with the GenBank database revealed significant homology (96% identity) with sequence of a-galactosidase (EC 3. Introduction: Dengue fever is the most significant re-emerging disease in urban areas mediated through a mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. The complex circulation of the dengue virus which mostly due to its existence as four serotypes of dengue-1 to 4, renders difficulty in producing a vaccine. Hence, many research groups are progressively searching for antiviral agent. Methods: The techniques involved were screening assay using fluorogenic peptides which targeted the NS2B/NS3 protease, in vitro antiviral activity employing virus inhibition assay and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: Through fluorogenic peptides complex assay, a competitive inhibitor, 4-hydroxypanduratin which is a cyclohexenyl chalcone derivative of the plant was identified. In vitro antiviral activity of crude extract and 4-hydroxypanduratin A assessed in HepG2 cells showed high inhibitory activity in a dose-dependent manner. At maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD) of 5 and 18 lg/ml respectively they exhibited complete inhibition of 100% in cells infected with DEN2 at TCID 50 10-1000 as indicated by the absence of cytophatic effects. Similar assay carried out in C6/36 cells showed low relative inhibition. At MNTD of 5 and 8 lg/ml respectively they inhibited DEN2 activity at a lower virus titer (TCID 50 1-10). Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction carried out for each sample harvested from in vitro inhibition assay showed decreasing intensity of the amplified DEN2 RNA transcript which correlates with increasing concentration of plant extracts and 4-hyroxypanduratin A given to infected cells.",

            "text": "Simultaneous determination of nucleotide sugars involved in protein glycosylation with high resolution ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC Nucleotide sugars are donor substrates of glycosyltransferases, and their availability and localization regulate glycosylation levels. Previous reports showed the levels of certain nucleotide sugars in tissue samples by using ion-pair reversed-phase or anion-exchange HPLC columns. However, the separation of nucleotide sugars and nucleotides was incomplete. Here we report a high resolution method using ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC to determine nucleotide sugars involved in glycosylation. A series of nucleotide sugars (CMP-NeuAc, UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-GlcNAc, GDP-Man, GDP-Fuc, and UDP-GlcA) and nucleotides (CMP, CDP, CTP, GMP, GDP, GTP, UMP, UDP, UTP, AMP, ADP, and ATP) were perfectly separated on a C18 column and were detected by UV detector equipped with a semi-micro cell. The developed method gave a chromatogram with high sensitivity and reproducibility for cellular samples, which contained structurally similar nucleotide sugars and nucleotides. The limit of quantitation was 2 pmol per each injection, and coefficient variations for intra-and inter-day assay were smaller than 5.3 and 19%, respectively. Picomolar levels of nucleotide sugars could be determined in a single chromatographic run. We were able to determine levels of nucleotide sugars in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and their glycosylation-defective Lec mutants with this method. Interestingly, levels of particular nucleotide sugar in intracellular fractions of mutant cells were different from those of control CHO cells. Those levels were also changed both in the exponential and stationary phases of cellular conditions. Thus, this method provides useful tools for determination of nucleotide sugar levels in cytosol, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum.Introduction: Geranium robertianum phytopreparations are currently in use, but little information exists regarding their effects at the cellular and molecular level. This study reports the effects of Geranium robertianum (hydro)alcoholic extracts on cultured cell proliferation. Methods: The extracts were obtained by mixing the herbal biomaterial for 8 hours at RT, 55\u00b0C, or by refluxing, with absolute or 70% ethanol, respectively. The extracts were analyzed for total polyphenols, by Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric test and for antioxidant capacity, by DPPH assay determining radical scavenging activity. Various cell lines (HS27, HeLa and DOK) were tested for proliferation as a response on treatment with different extracts' concentrations, using MTS assay. Controls were done with medium supplemented with ethanol only. Results: The results showed that 70% ethanol extracts better polyphenols than absolute ethanol. RT extraction resulted in significantly lower polyphenol content than higher temperature extractions. The antioxidant activity does not significantly change as a result of extracting condition for 55\u00b0C, or by refluxing, but proved to be significantly lower for RT extracts. No significant difference for antioxidant activity was noted between 70% and absolute ethanol extracts. The extracts have increased cell proliferation, in a concentration dependent manner, for both HS27 and HeLa cells. Similar effects were observed for 70% or absolute ethanol extracts. The extracts showed no effects on DOK cell proliferation. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are major cancer predisposition genes, responsible for a large percentage of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) families. Screening for mutations in these genes is now standard practice for HBOC cases in Europe, and permits medical follow-up and genetic counselling adapted to the needs of individuals in such families. As very little information is available in Romania, we started the first characterization of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk in north-eastern Romania. Our study consists in HBOC families identification and recruitment, DNA collection achievement from these patients, implementation of molecular technology for mutations analysis and oncogenetic followup of mutations bearers. We managed to identify and recruit so far several HBOC families with unique features such as 5 ovarian plus 1 breast cancer, or 8 breast cancer cases within the same family line. All recruited families are now under systematic DNA sequencing for BRCA screening. We also investigated, within HBOC families and sporadic cases, the status of three known founder mutations (185delAG and 5382insC on BRCA1 and 6174delT on BRCA2), by optimization and comparison of several multiplex-PCR techniques. This part of our study showed a very important random factor within all multiplex-PCR methods. We demonstrate that although they are cheap, rapid and easy techniques, they often generate false results like primer dimmers, undesirable amplification products apparition or heteroduplexes. Therefore we always recommend combining multiplex-PCR with other pre-screening methods (SNP, heteroduplex analysis) for a good selection before DNA sequencing.Past efforts to differentiate the Brucella spp. have been hampered owing to the high genetic homogeneity among Brucella species. The availability of discriminatory molecular tools to inform and assist conventional epidemiological approaches is invaluable in controlling these infections. The hypervariable octameric oligonucleotide finger-printing method was implemented using microsatellite DNA to genotype Br. melitensis. An eight-base pair tandem repeat sequence was revealed in eight genomic loci of the Br. melitensis genome that existed in various, multiple and random repetitions. Specific primers that were previously described were used to amplify these particular loci. The composition of the omp2 locus from two gene copies with differences in their PstI restriction endonuclease sites was studied in 45 field strains of Br. melitensis and was compared with the vaccine strain Rev-1. Out of the nine loci studied for all samples, four exhibit differences and can be used for differentiating and biotyping of Br. melitensis pathogenic stains from the vaccine strain. In addition the digestion products of the omp2 amplicons by PstI enzyme yielded different fragments between vaccine and field strains of Br. melitensis. Hence contagious field strains can be differentiated from the vaccine strain both with HOOF-prints method and RFLP of omp2 gene.Background: B-cell epitope prediction facilitates the design and synthesis of short peptides for various immunological applications. Several algorithms have been developed to predict B-cell linear epitopes (LEs) from primary sequences of antigens, providing important information for immunobiological experiments and antibody design. This paper describes two improved methods, linear epitope prediction with/without local peak extraction (LEP-LP and LEP-NLP), based on antigenicity scale and mathematical morphology for the prediction of B-cell LEs. Results: Previous studies revealed that LEs occur in regions with lowto-moderate antigenicity but relatively high local antigenicity scales. Hence, we developed a method adopting mathematical morphology to extract local peaks from a linear combination of the propensity scales of physico-chemical characteristics at each antigen residue. Our methodology possessed sensitivity more than 60% of the confirmed epitopes in the AntiJen or Pellequer datasets. Comparison among LEP-LP/ LEP-NLP, BepiPred and BEPITOPE revealed that our algorithms performed better in retrieving epitopes with low-to-moderate antigenicity and achieved comparable performance according to receiver operation characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. of the identified LEs, over 30% were unable to be predicted by existing prediction methods employing an average threshold of antigenicity index. Conclusions: Our LEP-LP methods provide bioinformatic approaches for predicting B-cell LEs with low-to-moderate antigenicity.

            "text": "Effect of different physico-mechanical factors upon the growth and expression of virulence in Escherichia coli strains isolated from drinking and sea water Aim: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the growth ability and expression of different virulence factors in aquatic Escherichia coli strains submitted to temperature and mechanical stress. Material and Methods: 100 strains of E. coli strains isolated in Romania from drinking and sea water were investigated for cell-associated (i.e. adhesion to the inert substrate and biofilm development) and soluble (i.e. sheep and rabbit erythrocytes haemolysins, CAMP-like factor, lecithinase, lipase, gelatinase, caseinase, amylase, mucinase, aesculin hydrolysis, DN-ase, indole-production) virulence factors. The experiments were performed before and after strains exposure to freezing temperature for 1 month and respectively, after microbial culture centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 minutes. Results: As concerning the virulence hallmarks harbored by the tested strains, all tested strains produced haemolysins (spot and CAMP-like factors) and lipase and exhibited also high positively levels for the production of DN-ase, esculinase and gelatinase. These results pleading for the existence of a pathogenic potential in E. coli aquatic strains, which could colonize the cellular tissues and thereafter cause invasive infections, by the secretion of haemolysins and lipases (acting as poreforming toxins) and of tissue degrading enzymes, such as gelatinases. Our results point out the importance of detecting specific virulence factors before incriminating water as a source of human diseases. After the temperature and mechanical shock, 32% for the sea strains and only 2% of the drinking water strains were recovered demonstrating the role of the natural environment in the development of microbial resistance to stress factors. The virulence factors expression was drastically decreased after stress exposure. However, the maintenance of the growth ability and of some virulence properties in microbial strains exposed to different stress conditions are reflecting the survival and adaptation ability of these strains to variable environmental conditions and the role of aquatic medium in the constitution of the natural reservoir of virulence genes. An important mechanism which regulates mRNA translation is through the phosphorylation of eIF2a at serine 51. This event is mediated by a distinct family of kinases consisting of PERK, PKR, HRI, and GCN2 which are activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, double stranded RNA, heme deficiency, and nutrient deprivation respectively. The tumor suppressor p53 is an important sensor of stress and a key regulator of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Unlike the majority of stresses, which stabilize p53, our lab has demonstrated that stress in the ER leads to p53 degradation. More specifically, ER stress leads to the activation of the glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK-3b), which promotes the Mdm2 dependent nucleo-cytoplasmic export and degradation of p53. Interestingly, hypoxic tumor microenvironments elicit cytoprotective ER stress responses further validating a physiological significance for the GSK-3b/Mdm2/p53 pathway. Methods: Mouse and cancer cell lines bearing wildtype p53 treated with activators of eIF2a kinases including thapsigargin, tunicamycin, double stranded RNA, and hypoxia. Protein levels were monitored by immunoblot analysis and immunostaining. Activation of GSK-3b was further assessed using in vitro kinase assays. Results: We demonstrated that the degradation of p53 (through the induction of GSK-3b activity) is mediated by the activation of the eIF2a kinases. Moreover, we show that exposure to severe hypoxia results in p53 destabilization concomitantly with eIF2a kinase activation. Conclusions: Our findings reveal a novel cross-talk between the eIF2a kinases and p53 with important implications in hypoxic adaptation.",

            "text": "Inspired by the rich diversity of non-covalent interactions occurring in nature, researchers have pursued artificial receptors preparation by molecular imprinting technology. Recognition sites in molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), in case of non-covalent approach, are created by the polymerization of preorganized functional monomers around the template with weak interactions, leading to broad distribution of specific binding sites. The metal-coordination interactions are quite directional, therefore very promising to MIPs design. The well defined coordination sphere of many transition metals complexes allows control of the orientation of functionality in MIPs, offering a high degree of versatility in targeting different functional groups in many biologically molecules. The production of MIPs for the recognition of C-terminal cholecystokinin pentapeptide (CCK-5, NH 2 -Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-CONH 2 ) in the presence of metal ion is reported. The MIPs were produced under the same molar ratio of template to monomers (acrylamide, N, N\u00a2-methylene bisacrylamide and 4-vinylpyridine) in the presence or absence of nitrilotriacetic acid-nickel (Ni-NTA) complex and their rebinding characteristics, net rebinding, imprinting factor and Lagmuir absorption constants, are reported. Introduction: Experimental transplantation in models of CNS injury has shown that Schwann cells (SCs), the myelinating glial cells of the PNS, are promissing candidates for cell therapy of CNS lesions. Overcoming SC limited integration within the CNS is critical for efficacious therapeutic intervention. As SC migration and myelination are mediated by extracellular matrix-cell surface interactions, our work has focused on genetic manipulation of SCs to alter their adhesive properties, by either expressing the polysialylated (PSA) form of NCAM on their surface or by over-expressing the cell adhesion molecule L1 and its secreted form L1-Fc. Methods: SCs from GFP-mice were transduced with retroviral vectors encoding either sialyl-transferase X (STX), the enzyme that transfers PSA on NCAM, or L1 in its transmembrane and in its soluble form L1-Fc, and they were transplanted in a mouse model of spinal cord injury. The animals were examined behaviorally and immunohistochemically for assessment of their recovery. Results: Transplantation of either STX-GFP-SCs or L1/L1-Fc-GFP-SCs in the injured mouse spinal cord promoted faster and greater locomotor recovery as compared to using control SCs or no cells. Morphological analysis revealed earlier and enhanced remyelination by grafted STX-GFP-SCs and L1/L1-Fc-GFP-SCs and also by endogenous SCs recruited from the periphery to the lesion. Moreover, enhanced sprouting of regenerating serotonergic nerve fibers was observed into and across the lesion site, in both cases. Additionally, STX-GFP-SC transplantation induced differentiation/remyelination by resident oligodendrocyte progenitors.",

Recently we have published the purification and characterization of a PHA synthase from Thermus thermophilus HB8 [1] . Although the entire genome of T. thermophilus has been published [2] a large number of ORFs still remains as hypothetical proteins. In this study PCR-based methods were employed for the identification of pha biosynthesis genes in T. thermophilus genome. For pha loci amplification the LA Taq polymerase was used and genomic DNA isolated from the bacterial cells. The primers were designed based on the highly conserved nucleic acid sequences in regions of the class II pha loci of various Pseudomonas. PCR products were sucloned into PCRII and later into pUC19. Escherichia coli JM109 were transformed with the constructed plasmids and screened for PHA synthase activity. Three putative regions were identified and studied further. The amplification pattern indicates that T. thermophilus HB8 belongs to class II pha loci. Elucidation of the mechanism of PHA biosynthesis in a thermophilic microorganism may lead to polymers with improved properties of high biotechnological value. Blood coagulation factor IX is a plasma proenzyme which is activated during the coagulation cascade into an active serine protease. Among the detected polymorphisms of fIX gene, polymorphisms A21975G and A32881C cause the T194A and T461G mutations on the protein with a prevalence of 23% and 2% in the normal individuals, respectively. However, in our previous studies the A21975G polymorphism was detected in a higher percentage among a group of thrombophilic patients showing correction of their coagulation tests by in vitro adding of recombinant fIX. Hence, these two mutations were introduced into the truncated factor IX (rf9), and their effect on the expressed proteolytic activity was determined. The truncated fIX was overexpressed by pET22/rf9 lacking the first N-terminal domain which is essential for the protein expression in prokaryotic cells. In the fIX gene mutations at positions A21975G and A32881C were introduced. The native and the two mutated forms of rf9 were retrieved and purified from cytoplasm using a Q-Sepharose ff column. The purified proteins were activated by 'Russell's viper venom FX activating protein' (RVV-X). Both mutations significantly increased the proteolytic activity of the protein as shown by the K m and V max values, indicating that these polymorphisms might be responsible for the thrombophilic incidence in the above mentioned patients. Acknowledgements: Many thanks to Prof. Dr Brandstetter (University of Salzburg, Austria) for offering the pET22b vector carrying the truncated rf9 gene.

We compared three methods by evaluating the identification efficiency of the phosphorylation sites of a-casein with optimized methods in our group. Methods: After trypsin digestion on a-casein, tryptic peptides were enriched by each strategy and injected in our outstanding MS(nano-UPLC Q-TOF premier). Data analysis were performed by MS/MS expression system(MS e ) and the data were searched with MASCOT. Alkaline phosphatase was treated to confirm the new phosphorylated sites.",

Skjevik Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, NORWAY Introduction: It is well established and well documented that the nerve blocking effects of local anesthetics are secondary to their interaction with the Na+ channels thereby blocking nerve membrane excitability and the generation of action potentials. However, accumulating data suggest that local anesthetics also possess antimicrobial effects that may be due to their interaction with membranes. Articaine is a local anesthetic distributed under the name Septocaine \u00aa and Septocaine forte \u00aa . We have shown that this drug intercalates with biological membranes by Langmuir experiments and molecular dynamic simulations. Septocaine is currently administered as a racemic mixture and we have investigated the mechanism of action with respect to a potential stereo specific binding. Methods: Langmuir was utilized to obtain an indication of the membrane intercalations properties of Articaine. Molecular dynamics simulations were applied to study the molecular flexibility of Articaine and to select stable confirmations to be docked to the membrane. Docking of Articaine to biological membranes and docking to the pore domain of a human sodium channel was performed. Results: The results obtained from Langmuir confirm that Articaine intercalates with biological membranes. Molecular dynamics simulations give us insight into the molecular basis of this intercalation. Conclusions: The results give reason to believe that Articaine may exhibit its antimicrobial effect by intercalation into prokaryotic biological membranes. Introduction: Bacterial ice nucleation is a natural phenomenon responsible for frost damage of many crops, due to a multimeric protein complex formed on the outer membrane of certain Gram-negative ice nucleating bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas, Erwinia and Xanthomonas. The monomer of this complex is encoded by a single gene and undergoes post translational modifications before ancoring to the outer membrane. Methods: The ice nucleation gene of Pseudomonas syringae has been transfered and expressed heterologously in two Zymomonas mobilis strains by assisted conjugal transfer. Cell-free ice nuclei were quantified following separation by centrifugation and filtering through cellulose acetate membranes. Ice nucleation activity was quantified by the droplet-freezing test. Results: All recombinant strains proved to be efficient ice nucleators. Two of these were found to release ice nuclei in the enviroment. Release was not due to cell lysis, as cytosolic enzymes like pyruvate decarboxylase were not detected in the culture medium. Optimum release of cell-free ice nulei was obtained after growth on 2% glucose medium at 16\u00b0C. Freezing temperature threshold was below -7\u00b0C indicating class C nuclei. Conclusions: Cell-free ice nuclei from Z. mobilis could be a result of outer membrane blebbing and may prove useful for the production of cell-free active ice nucleation protein. Introduction: All quality parameters of wine depend in essence on microbial activities during fermentation and maturation. Thus, modern wine industries have focused worldwide on the development of starter cultures derived from wild yeast present in spontaneously fermentimg must. Methods: Isolation and molecular characterization of indigenous wine yeast strains. Sequential use of strains as starter cultures. GC-MS analysis for volatile compounds determination of the produced wines. Results: With regard to the total aromatic profile of the produced wine the interactions of non-Saccharomyces and Saccharomyces starters resulted to elevated concentrations of six measured higher alcohol esters (isoamyl acetate, ethyl caproate, ethyl caprylate, ethyl caprate, hexyl acetate and phenyl ethyl acetate) which are associated with pleasant fruity aromas. Additionally, it contained a more than 40-fold higher concentration of 2-phenyl ethanol, an alcohol contributing a delicate fragrance of rose petals to a wine's bouquet. Interestingly, three higher alcohols that produce an unpleasant fusel-oil taste and 1-hexanol that produces a grassy odour were found to be minimal. Conclusions: Interactions of indigenous non-Saccharomyces and Saccharomyces strains in a sequential manner as starter cultures, lead to the production of wine with a local character and richer flavour.

Piotrowski and G. Bartosz Department of Molecular Biophysics, University of Lodz, Lodz, POLAND Biological membrane is an important cellular shield against exogenous oxidative stress thus action of radical chain-breaking antioxidants is crucial for cell protection. a-Tocopherol (a-TH) is a major lipid soluble antioxidant that protects biological membrane from peroxidation. It is known that water-soluble ascorbate can interact synergistically with a-TH prolonging its antioxidant capacity. Reduced glutathione (GSH) has also been shown to protect lipid layers in various ways including GSH-dependent recycling of a-TH but this mechanism is still unclear. Depending on antioxidants used, the effects of azo compound 2,2\u00a2-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) on phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes peroxidation were tested. Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine liposomes were prepared using Mini extruder set (0.1 lm polycarbonate membranes). Hydrophilic antioxidants (GSH, ascorbate, melatonin) and hydrophobic antioxidants (butylated hydroxytoluene, a-TH, quercetin, bilirubin, lipoic acid, coenzyme Q 10 , menadione) were used. Hydrophilic antioxidants were encapsulated inside the liposomes containing selected hydrophobic antioxidants and optional interactions were checked. C-11 -BODIPY 581/591 fluorescence probe was used for detection of lipid peroxidation. The area under curve was calculated as a measure of antioxidants effect. Both ascorbate and GSH protected liposomes against AAPH but no significant antioxidants interactions were found. Quercetin exhibited antioxidative activity but no synergistic effect with ascorbate or GSH was observed. Other compounds had no significant protective effect at the concentrations used. Introduction: The value of polymorphisms in the Y chromosome has been largely recognized and used in studies of human evolution at the species level as well as in regional and population studies. A series of polymorphic Y-chromosomal short tandem repeats (Y-STRs) show high levels of heterogeneity within and between populations and thus provide a useful tool for local population structure and recent demographic history studies. The aim of the present study was to characterize 12 Y-STRs haplotype variation in the Latvian population. Methods: The population sample included 158 paternally unrelated healthy Latvians. One trinucleotide STR (DYS392) and 11 tetranucleotide STRs (DYS19, DYS385a, DYS385b, DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS393, DYS437, DYS438, and DYS439) were determined using PowerPlex \u00d2 Y System (Promega, USA). Haplotype and gene diversity was calculated using the Arlequin 2.0 package. Results: A total of 115 haplotypes were identified, among which 95 were unique, and a haplotype 15-11-14-13-29-23-11-13-14-14-10-10 (defined by DYS19-385a-385b-389I-389II-390-391-392-393-437-438-439) of which occurred more frequently (8%). The haplotype diversity for 12 Y-STRs loci was observed 0.9923 demonstrating the usefulness and informative power of this Y-STR set. We have found four predominant alleles at loci DYS393 and DYS437 that make up 95.5% of variation within sampled population. The gene diversity values for the Y-STRs loci ranged from 0.4146 (DYS438) to 0.9631 (DYS393). Conclusion: The analysis of associated Y-STRs revealed differences between microsatellite diversity within the Latvian population. The results from the present study have showed genetic similarity to neighbouring populations from Eastern European region. Acknowledgement: This work has been supported by European Social Fund. Introduction: Our studies focused on hepcidin and the human RNase L Inhibitor (Rli). The first is a hormone, regulating iron homeostasis, the latter, a cytosolic iron-sulphur protein plays important role in antiviral protection. In order to identify in vivo protein-protein interactions, we screened a human liver cDNA library with our proteins using BacterioMatch two hybrid assay system. Methods: We used the BacterioMatch two-hybrid system to detect the protein-protein interactions. This system uses two plasmids, one of them contains the sequence of our protein of interest, while a cDNA library is expressed in the other plasmid. The protein-protein interaction is detected by the growth of carbenicillin-resistant colonies. After validation of the positive interactions, the participants were identified by sequencing. Results: The proteins which showed interactions with prohepcidin are the transthyretin, the a-1 acid protein, and the a-1 antitrypsin. We found that Rli binds to IFN induced transmembrane protein 3, ubiquilin 1 and to humanin 1. However, albumin gave interactions with Rli which is possibly a nonspecific binding. Conclusions: We found that the BacterioMatch system is useful for screening libraries for protein-protein interactions. One of our most important findings using this bacterial two-hybrid assay was, that a-1 antitrypsin, which is a serin protease inhibitor, binds prohepcidin. This binding may play an important role in the posttranslational regulation of prohepcidin by preventing its maturation. The proteins which interact with human Rli are important as well, because they may be involved in the action of interferon, or in accumulation of proteins in neurodegenerative disorders. Introduction: Parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis have significant impacts on the world, specially in developing countries with infections spread over several hundred millions of people and it is one of the significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Conventional chemotherapies are often inadequate, toxic or are becoming less effective due to emergence of resistances as observed for antimonials; sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam) and meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime). In this study the leishmanicidal activities of a series of new synthetic 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-thiadiazole compounds like (5-chlorothiophen-2-yl) (4-(5-(1-methyl-5-nitro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl) piperazin-1-yl)methanone were investigated. Methods: In vitro activity of these compounds against Leishmania major and cytotoxic effects on the host cells were determined by MTT assay. Results: All of the agents presented more potent antileishmanial activity than did the standard pentavalent antimony, Glucantime. Also these compounds have not remarkable toxicity for murine macrophages rather than Glucantime. Conclusion: In general, nitrofuran and nitroimidazole derivatives of thiadiazoles or analogues with phenyl in piperazin ring presented potent activity against L. major. The most active compound was found to be 15a analogue, (5-chlorothiophen-2-yl)(4-(5-(1-methyl-5-nitro-1Himidazol-2-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl) piperazin-1-yl)methanone with IC50 = 9.35 lM. Replacement of H with Cl or Br in thiophen moiety of nitrofuran and nitroimidazole derivatives, increase the leishmanicidal activity. The nitrothiophen components generally displayed less activity against both form of the parasite.",

Introduction: Efficiency of conventional radiotherapy of melanoma is limited and shows only individual results. In attempt to realize more efficient killing of melanoma cells, in this in vitro study HTB140 cells were exposed to 12 C ion beam. Methods: Exponentially growing HTB140 melanoma cells were irradiated with 62 MeV/u 12 C ions produced by the superconducting cyclotrons at INFN-LNS, Italy. By interposing Perspex plates of different thickness in front of the cell monolayer three tissue equivalent irradiation positions along the Bragg curve were obtained. These positions belonged to: plateau region (A), maximum of the peak (B) and distal fall-off part of the peak (C), thus providing dose levels of: 22.04 \u00b1 1.35%, 92.11 \u00b1 4.76% and 21.42 \u00b1 6.43%, respectively. Cell proliferation was evaluated using the 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assay. Cell cycle phase analysis and evaluation of apoptosis were performed using propidium iodide staining. Assays were performed 48 hours after irradiation. The study was performed on tissue and blood samples from patients undergoing colonoscopy for routine clinical indications, which were divided in three groups: health patients (GI, n = 14), polyp bearing patients (GII, n = 44) and cancer patients (GIII, n = 20). None of the patients had preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Results: None of the patients showed methylation of the promoter in blood samples for the genes hMLH1 and p16 while the methylation pattern for MGMT was the same in blood and tissue samples. Three patients showed the MSI-H phenotype (1/GII, 2/GIII) that was also accompanied by promoter methylation of the three genes (MGMT, p16 and hMLH1) as well as by changes on the number of the repeats of the target genes examined. Ten patients showed the MSI-L phenotype (4/GII, 6/GIII) but in this case only the GIII patients showed simultaneous promoter methylation of the three genes and only two GII patients an alteration of TGFbRII coding repeats. Conclusions: Our results suggests that there is a link between methylation and MSI phenotype which is caused by defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system which drive on the adenoma to carcinoma transformation through alterations on repeats number of the 'target genes'.Marine pollution produces multiple consequences at the organism, population and ecosystem level, detected as biochemical, cellular and physiological alterations that are defined as biomarkers. Protein synthesis depression is a life-saving mechanism in response to various cellular stresses. Therefore, an experimental approach to reveal responses to pollution stress could be to measure the ribosomal subpopulation existing as polysomes which serve as an indicator of the translation efficiency status. To test this approach, specimens of Mytilus galloprovincialis were immersed in a clean coastal region, and two marine stations differently polluted by heavy metals. After 1 month exposure, digestive gland cells were isolated from the caged mussels and their content in polysomes and efficiency of ribosomes to initiate protein synthesis were estimated. In parallel, a suite of standard biomarkers, including metallothionein content, lysosomal membrane stability, superoxide radical concentration and lipid peroxidation were assessed in the same samples. Metals in the surrounding waters and mussel tissues were also measured. Alterations in protein synthesis were found to be strongly correlated with the other biomarkers and the results of metal analysis. Our data support the notion that downregulation of the global protein synthesis is an important component of the cellular response to pollution stress and can be exploited as a biomarker of marine pollution.",

However, the polyP regulated genes necessary and/or sufficient for the biological effects remain undefined. Since polyP is known as highly negative charged polymer, it can be a possible stimulator like any other known molecules such as LPS a well defined endotoxin. To test this hypothesis we compared polyP against LPS on human monocyte derived macrophage cell line THP-1. Our cDNA microarray analysis showed that polyP was able to induce IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, TGF-b, IL-10 and IL-1b to that of control, which was similar to LPS, treated THP-1 cells.

Herein we describe the use of the non-toxic B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) genetically fused to Sm14 -a fatty-acid binding protein from Schistosoma mansoni -as an attempt to elicit a better immune response for a vaccine antigen candidate. Methods: Recombinant proteins were expressed on a prokaryotic system, purified by different chromatographic methods and both immunochemical and spectroscopically characterized. Intranasal immunization experiments were performed on BALB/c mice and vaccine's efficacy was assessed by analyzing the worm-burden after challenge infection with S. mansoni cercariae. Results: When intranasally administered, Sm14 was not able to reduce the worm burden on vaccinated animals, however either when coadministered with or genetically fused to CTB, Sm14 reduced about 20% the worm burden on vaccinated animals. Furthermore, coadministration of CTB and Sm14 reduces in 33.87% the area of hepatic granulomas around trapped eggs. Conclusion: Despite subcutaneous vaccination of mice with Sm14 was described to induce 40-60% of protection on vaccinated animals, when intranasally administered, this antigen did not elicit the same protection levels.

Introduction: Cellulases are a group of enzymes with the capability of hydrolysing the beta 1,4 glycosidic linkage of cellulose fibers to various products with wide range of industrial applications. Trichoderma reesei because of having complete cellulase complex is an efficient and well studied cellulose-degrading microorganisms. Methods: In this respect we immobilized the cellulolytic broth of T.reseei on microcrystalline cellulose. The enzymatic systems were then eluted with citrate buffer (method I). In other approach the cellulolytic enzymes which adsorbed to microcrystalline cellulose, were desorbed with in glycerol and diethylether and then concentrated using n-buthanol (method II). In addition we concentrated directly broth of T.reseei using lyophylization (method III). Results: Based on sequential ion-exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B) and gel filtration on obtained cellulase compositions in three methods, we found out the chromatographams are different regarding the Avicelase and CMCase activities. Method I was more specific for having particular cellulase enzymes. In method II the obtained cellulolytic system was more complete, but the chromatogram in this method is the result of further fractions (because of more aggregation of enzyme proteins in n-buthanol). We have the most complete cellulolytic complex in method III. Conclusions: We can use method I for different industry when the goal is using a particular cellulase enzymes, but more efficient method for obtaining the whole cellulolytic complex with more purity of these enzymes, is method II. Method III has a complete cellulase complex too, however the purity of enzymes is less than the other methods. Introduction: Lateral roots are essential to form a dense root network allowing plants to take up water and minerals effectively from the soil. Laterals are initiated from a specific organogenic cell layer within the differentiated root known as the pericycle. The establishment and maintenance of the pericycle and the subsequent process of lateral root formation is an interesting model to study how stem-cells can be maintained within an otherwise differentiated and endoreduplicated tissue, and how these cells are re-activated into division in response to mitogenic signals. Activation and progression through the major phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2 and M) are regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases, composed of catalytic (CDK) and regulatory (cyclin) subunits. Modulation of CDK activity is not primarily regulated by the abundance of the CDK subunit, but by controlled transcription, translation, intracellular localization, or regulated destruction of the cyclin or by stimulatory and inhibitory phosphorylation of the CDK. In addition, activity can also be inhibited by the binding of inhibitor proteins (KRPs). Results and Conclusions: In this work, we present that the interaction of KRP2 with the D-type cyclin CYCD2;1 could be relevant in this process. KRP2 drives D-type cyclin CYCD2;1 and kinase CDKA to the nucleus of these cells, stabilizing the complex and retaining the capability of entering in the mitotic cell cycle and we propose that auxin could control CDKA-CYCD2;1 activity by modulating the levels of KRP2.",

In order to examine their catalytic activity, peroxidase activity of microperoxidase-11 and hemin in reverse micellar media were investigated. The reverse microemulsion composed of dodecane, aqueous phosphate buffer, SDS and 1-hexanol was prepared and hemin and MP-11 were directly encapsulated into the aqueous cores of reverse microemulsions through the self-assembly formation mechanism. The capability of peroxidase models in catalyzing the oxidation 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide was followed spectrophotometrically. Kinetic parameters including initial reaction rates, V max , Michaelis constant (K m ), turnover number (k cat ) and catalytic efficiencies were obtained. The activatory effect of histidine on the catalytic parameters of the enzyme models was also taken into account to improve the peroxidatic activity and functional stabilities of the prepared mini-enzymes. The table indicates the comparative kinetic parameters for the various prepared peroxidase models. The catalytic parameters illustrates that these heme biocatalysts represent acceptable peroxidatic activity. As it can be concluded from the table the most potent peroxidase models are histidine-hemin(in organic phase) and MP-11(in aqueous phase). High values of catalytic efficiencies probably arise from high solubility of the biocatalyst in the corresponding reaction medium. Introduction: In food and beverage industries, yeast cells are exposed to various stress conditions. Thus, obtaining robust yeast strains and understanding the genetic mechanisms of stress resistance as a complex phenotype is important to improve yeast fermentation performance. In this study, to increase acid resistance of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have applied 'evolutionary engineering' approach based on random mutation and selection. Methods: We started with chemically mutagenized yeast cells to increase initial genetic diversity and applied citric acid stress continuously throughout batch cultivations with increasing acid concentrations for 15 successive generations. Starting from 50 mM citric acid concentration as the initial stress level, we obtained a population that resisted up to 240 mM citric acid. Individual mutants were selected randomly from this final population. To determine relative survival level compared to wild type S. cerevisiae, a high throughput procedure in 96-well plates based on the most probable number (MPN) method was applied to the mutants and wild type.Results: Resistance of mutant strains against citric acid, and some other stresses particularly relevant for food industry such as heat, osmotic, ethanol and oxidative stress were investigated using MPN methodology. Resistances of these strains were compared with those of the wild type strain in terms of percent survival. Conclusions: We have successfully employed an evolutionary engineering approach to obtain acid-resistant yeast mutants. Further genetic analysis of the mutants will reveal the genetic basis of acid resistance in yeast, which can be exploited to improve industrial bioprocess efficiency. 'Lipofuscin-loaded-RPE-model' was either maintained in the dark or exposed to 390-550 nm light. The gene copy numbers of lysosomal and antioxidant enzymes were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. Results: Significant upregulation was observed in genes of acid phosphatase (AP-70%), cathepsin D (CAD-35%), catalase (CAT-71%), superoxide dismutase (SOD-63%) and glutathione-peroxidase (GPX-52%) in lipofuscin-fed-RPE compared to unfed-ones just before the start of blue-light exposure. In lipofuscin-ingested RPE exposed to bluelight increase in gene expression of AP, CAT and SOD observed until 3-hours decreased subsequently; however, CAD and GPX genes showed upregulation during similar time. Dark-treated lipofuscin-ingested RPE showed similar expression as light treated ones for AP, CAD, and GPX genes, although the absolute gene copy numbers were much lower. Blue light alone exposed RPE showed gene expressions to various degrees.Conclusions: Lipofuscin has a potential to regulate expression of the lysosomal and antioxidant genes. The upregulation of enzyme expression possibly occur to compensate for the previously observed lipofuscin-coupled loss in enzyme activity. The data consolidates previous observations on liposuction toxicity, highlighting its role at molecular level and implicating lipofuscin as an important component in cellular ageing and in age-related pathogenesis of eye diseases. We attempted to construct a new recombinant protein characterized by fibrin-specific properties of plasminogen activation combined with antithrombin and antiplatelet activities. To the C-terminal part of recombinant staphylokinase (r-SAK), which is a promising profibrinolytic agent, we assembled (i) the Kringle two domain (K2) of tissue type-plasminogen activator (t-PA), containing a fibrin-specific binding site, (ii) the RGD sequence (Arg-Gly-Asp) for the prevention of platelet aggregation and (iii) the antithrombotic agent -hirudin. The cDNA for hybrid protein SAK-RGD-K2-Hir was cloned into pESP-3 yeast protein expression vector. The introduction of K2 t-PA, RGD sequence and hirudin into r-SAK molecule did not alter the staphylokinase activity. The plasminogen activation rate (determined by KM and Kcat) of SAK-RGD-K2-Hir was not significantly different from that of r-SAK. Affinity and binding strength of the recombinant protein to fibrin immobilized on the biosensor were higher than to r-SAK. We observed a higher clot lysis potency of SAK-RGD-K2-Hir as evidenced by a faster and more profound lysis of 125I-labeled human fibrin clots. The potency of thrombin inhibition by the hirudin part of the recombinant fusion protein SAK-RGD-K2-Hir was the same as that of r-Hir alone. In conclusion, presented results from in vitro study suggest that the SAK-RGD-K2-Hir construct can be a more potent and faster acting thrombolytic agent with antithrombin and antiplatelet properties compared to standard r-SAK. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is packaged into the chromatin structure. Nucleosome, which is the fundamental unit of chromatin, is composed of a histone octamer and a 146 bp DNA. The histone octamer contains two each of the core histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Five nonallelic histone H3 variants, H3.1, H3.2, H3.3, H3t, and CENP-A, have been identified in mammals. Histones H3.1 and H3.2 are produced at S phase, while histone H3.3 is constitutively expressed through the cell cycle. Consistently, histones H3.1 and H3.2 are incorporated into chromatin in a replication dependent fashion, while, histone H3.3 is incorporated into transcriptionally active chromatin region in a replication independent fashion. CENP-A is the centromere-specific H3 variant, which specifically associated with the centromeric region of chromosomes. Histone H3t is a testis-specific H3 variant, and is robustly expressed in the testis. Recent proteomics and tissue-specific RT-PCR experiments suggested that histone H3t may function in somatic tissues, in addition to testis. In the present study, we purified human histone H3t as a recombinant protein, and tested its nucleosome formation ability in vitro. We found that H3t/H4 was proficient in the nucleosome formation by the salt-dialysis method, but it was not efficiently incorporated into the nucleosome by human Nap1, due to its defective H3t/H4 deposition on DNA. Intriguingly, human Nap2, a paralog of hNap1, efficiently promoted nucleosome assembly with H3t/ H4. Mutational analyses revealed that the Ala111 residue, which is conserved among H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3, but not in H3t, is responsible for the hNap1-mediated nucleosome assembly.PP8-183 Translocation of two candidate T3SS effectors from Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110 into plant cells through the HRP pathway C. Fotiadis and A. Tampakaki Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Agricultural University of Athens, Athens, GREECE Introduction: The type III secretion systems are widely conserved in plant and animal pathogens but are also present in rhizobia, in some non-pathogenic plant-associated bacteria and in certain endosymbionts. These systems mediate the transfer of diverse bacterial proteins (termed 'effectors') directly into the host cell cytosol. To explore the T3SS effector repertoire of Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110, we initially isolated two genes encoding proteins with weak similarity to AvrPphB of the bean pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. Methods: The two annotated genes (BLR2058 and BLR2140) were PCR amplified and cloned in-frame to the coding region of the C-terminal 177 aa of the effector protein AvrRpt2, a well-documented in vivo reporter for type III secretion. AvrRpt2 fusion plasmids were electroporated into P. fluorescens 55 (pLN18) carrying the entire hrp cluster from strain Pss-61. The P. fluorescens strains were infiltrated into Nicotiana spp. The genes under study were also cloned in a Ti vector for Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in plants.Results: Infiltration of P. fluorescens (pLN18) expressing AvrRpt2 fusions of the two rhizobial proteins in leaves of various Nicotiana spp. elicited a typical hypersensitive reaction (HR). However, only the BLR2140 protein elicited HR when it is expressed through Agrobacterium.",

Recent studies indicated that pre-treatment with Mucuna pruriens seed extract (MPE) in mice did confer protection against the lethal effects of Echis carinatus and cobra venom. In the present studies, survival experiments using rats showed that the MPE pre-treatment did confer effective protection against lethality of Naja naja sputatrix (NNS) venom and some protection against Calloselasma rhodostoma venom. In vitro neutralization experiments using mice showed that antibody raised against MPE effectively neutralized the lethalities of Naja naja sputatrix, Naja kaouthia and Naja nivea venoms Both immunobloting and in vitro neutralization experiments showed that the anti-MPE cross-reacted with the two major toxins of NNS venom: phospholipase A 2 and neurotoxin, but was not reactive against the venom cardiotoxin. The results indicated that anti-MPE could be used in the antiserum therapy of Asiatic cobra (Naja) bites, and that the protective mechanism of MPE pre-treatment against Asiatic cobra venom poisoning involves immunological neutralization of cobra venom phospholipase A 2 and neurotoxin by antibodies elicited by MPE pre-treatment.PP8-189 A model system for gene knockout in chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells M. Tsukahara, Y. Maseki, A. Shimanuki and I. Kitazumi Kirin Pharma Co., Ltd., Takasaki, JAPAN Introduction: CHO cells are extensively employed for the production of recombinant protein therapeutics. Genetic modification of CHO cells provides a useful tool for an addition of extra values to recombinant therapeutic proteins and/or improvement of cell growth and viability. Targeted disruption for gene of interest has proven useful as a method not only for study of gene function but also for permanent modification of cell character. In our previous studies, six genes including caspase-3 and a-1,6-fucosyltransferase were knocked-out in CHO-K1 cells. However, KO efficiency is low and we need to improve the knockout system. Methods: Hygromycin resistance gene with intron; Hyg-gene was divided into two exons by insertion of 4.6 kb non-sense sequences as artificial intron. KO host cells; Host cells were established by transfection with the following DNA construct, CMV promoter/hygromycinartificial exon1/artificial intron/polyA terminator. KO vectors; KO vectors consisted of various length of artificial intron as 5\u00a2-homologous region/hygromycin-artificial exon2/polyA terminator as 3\u00a2-homologous region. Measurement of KO efficiency; 3 weeks later after transfection of KO vector, hyg-resistant colonies were picked and KO was confirmed by DNA sequencing of PCR products with KO specific primers.Results: Hyg-resistant clones were obtained by transfection of KO vectors. These cells had the functional hyg-gene in host cells. KO efficiency was dependent on the length of homologous arms. Conclusion: We established the assay system for gene targeting using hyg-resistance. This simple system will be available to find the factors affecting the gene targeting efficiency.",

Consequently, this agent is an outstanding candidate for the development of a radiotracer for differential diagnosis of ovarian and breast cancer. Furthermore, it may equally serve as a biochemical and cellular tool of high sensitivity for the investigation of the mode of action of DF-203 and other similarly performing anticancer agents. This work describes the synthesis of the DF 203 rhenium and technetium complexes and their preliminary evaluation in MCF-7 and IGROV1 cell lines. The complexes were efficiently synthesised in high chemical and radiochemical yield and purity. The DF-Re complex was evaluated for its cell uptake in both sensitive and insensitive cell lines, as well as in healthy fibroblasts. Uptake detection was based on the fluorescence properties of the complex, which can be clearly visualised under epifluorescence microscope equipped with DAPI filter. Several concentrations were investigated to appreciate the potential of a dose-dependent uptake.The nuclear uptake was also investigated with fluorescence observation. The corresponding technetium complexes is evaluated by means of autoradiography. Cellular localisation in different compartments and their affinity for the arylhydrocarbon receptor, are currently in progress. The results so far are encouraging for the application of these radiotracers for the elucidation DF-203 mode of action and for the development of a promising tumour radiodiagnostic agent.",

The goal of this study is to evaluate physiological function of dietary rice germ extract on type 2 diabetes of mice. C57BL/6j mice were fed with a high dextrin diet and a high dextrin diet containing rice germ extract. High dextrin diet remarkably increased body weight, compared with dextrin diet containing germ. Rice germ containing diet repressed total plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, and increased plasma adiponectin level that has been known to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and enhance insulin sensitivity. Single oral administration of rice germ extract also increased plasma adiponectin level. Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), one of main components of rice germ extract, increased adiponectin level quickly as well as rice germ extract. These results suggest that GABA would upregulate adiponectin secretion. The paper will discuss about the GABA function for modulating adiponectin secretion from adipocyte and the promising functional foods against type 2 diabetes.",

We have recently found that hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (H-PGDS) induced in grouped necrotic muscle fibers in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD). Cyclooxygenase-2 and phospholipase A 2 , synchronously induced in the H-PGDSexpressing muscle fibers. In this study, we developed a novel therapy for DMD by inhibition of H-PGDS. Results and Methods: H-PGDS was induced in the necrotic muscle fiber in a bupivacaine (BPVC)-induced rat model, and in a dystrophin null mdx mouse model. Expressions of H-PGDS-mRNA and -protein peaked at 12-24 hours after the BPVC injection into the muscle. The necrotic muscle in the mdx mice constitutively expressed H-PGDS. We developed novel H-PGDS inhibitors based on the X-ray crystallographic analysis of human H-PGDS complexed with its prototype inhibitor, HQL-79. We also developed a non-invasive, continuous visualization method of necrotic muscle by using X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging. Oral administration of a novel H-PGDS inhibitor prevented the wound expansion in both a BPVC-induced muscular necrosis model and a mdx mouse model, as evaluated by CT imaging, demonstrating that PGD 2 produced by H-PGDS plays important pathological roles on the expansion of muscle necrosis. H-PGDS inhibitor also accelerated the accumulation and activation of macrophages in the necrotic area.These results indicate that PGD 2 produced by H-PGDS is involved in the wound expansion in DMD and that inhibition of H-PGDS is a novel therapy for DMD.",
