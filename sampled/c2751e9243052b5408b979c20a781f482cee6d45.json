Both type 1 and type 2 Diabetes mellitus (DM) are diagnosed based on the plasma glucose criteria, either the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels or the 2-h plasma post-prandial glucose (2-h PPG) levels during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or the newer glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) criteria which reflects the average plasma glucose concentration over the previous [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] weeks. [1, 2] The International Expert Committee Report recommend a cut-point of \u22656.5% for HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes as an alternative to fasting plasma glucose (FPG \u22657.0 mmol/L). [3] HbA1c testing has some substantial advantages over FPG and OGTT, such as convenience, pre-analytical stability, and less day-to-day fluctuations due to stress and illness. [3] Additionally, HbA1c has been recognized as marker to assess secondary vascular complications due to metabolic derailments in susceptible individuals. [2, 4, 5] However, given ethnic differences in sensitivity and specificity of HbA1c population-specific cut-offs might be necessary. [6, 7] Moreover, measuring HbA1c is expensive as compared to FPG assessments and standardization of measurement techniques and laboratories are poorly practiced across the country. [8] Also, in several countries including India, HbA1c demonstrated inadequate predictive accuracy in the diagnosis of diabetes, there is no consensus on a suitable cut-off point of HbA1c for diagnosis of diabetes in this high-risk population. [9] In lieu of this, the panel expressed concerns on using HbA1c as sole criteria for diagnosis of diabetes particularly in resource constraint settings.

Early detection of diabetes/prediabetes through screening increases the likelihood of identifying asymptomatic individuals and provides adequate treatment to reduce the burden of diabetes and its complications. Through a computer simulated model on the data from the Anglo-Danish-Dutch study of intensive treatment in people with screen-detected diabetes in primary care (ADDITION-Europe), Herman et al. have demonstrated that the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and relative risk reduction (RRR) for cardiovascular (CV) outcomes are substantially higher at 5 years with early screening and diagnosis of diabetes when compared to 3 years (ARR: 3.3%; RRR: 29%) or 6 years of delay (ARR: 4.9%; RRR: 38%). [12] Adopting a targeted approach and utilizing lowcost tools with meticulous planning and judicious allocation of resources can make screening cost-effective even in resourceconstrained settings like India. [13] Furthermore, in a systematic review and meta-analysis, screening for type 2 DM (T2DM) and prediabetes has been found to be cost-effective when initiated at around 45-50 years of age with repeated testing every 5 years. [14] Prediabetes is defined as blood glucose concentration higher than normal, but lower than established thresholds for diagnosis of diabetes. People with prediabetes are defined by having IGT (2-h PG in the 75-g OGTT: 140-199 mg/dL) or IFG (FPG: 100-125 mg/dL). It is a state of intermediate hyperglycaemia with increased risk of developing diabetes and associated CV complications and therefore early detection and treatment of IGT and IFG is necessary to prevent the rising epidemic of diabetes and its associated morbidity and mortality. Although, IDF guideline does not deal with screening and management of prediabetes, the ADA recommends screening for prediabetes and T2DM through informal assessment of risk factors or with an assessment tool. [1] To prevent the progression of pre-diabetes to T2DM, ADA recommends an intensive behavioural lifestyle intervention (BLI) programme (eg, medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and physical activity) in susceptible individuals. [15] Based on the Indian Council of Medical Research-INdiaDIABetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study conducted in 15 states, the overall prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes was 7.3% (95% CI: 7.0, 7.5) and 10.3% (10.0, 10.6), respectively. [16] Another study conducted among residents of urban areas of east Delhi-The Delhi Urban Diabetes Survey (DUDS) demonstrated a strikingly high prevalence of diabetes (18.3%: known, 10.8%; newly detected, 7.5%) and prediabetes (21% [WHO criteria], 39.5% [ADA criteria]).

[31] The predictive value of HbA1c for T2DM depends on various factors such as ethnicity, age, and presence of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). [32] [33] [34] [35] In a cohort study on individuals from Swedish and Middle-East ancestry, HbA1 \u226548 mmol/mol had a predictive sensitivity of 31% and 25%, respectively, for T2DM.

Similarly, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 studies including 49,238 individuals without T2DM reveal that HbA1c values are higher in Blacks (0.26% (2.8 mmol/mol), p <0.001), Asians (0.24% (2.6 mmol/mol), p <0.001), and Latinos (0.08% (0.9 mmol/mol); p <0.001) when compared to Whites.

[44, 45] The 10-year follow-up data of the CURES that assessed incident rates of dysglycaemia in Asian Indians are now available. [46] In a cross-sectional study on slum dwellers in Bangalore, prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes was identified as 12.33% and 11.57% in people aged \u226535 years. [47] Moreover, in case of female gender, increasing age, overweight and obesity, sedentary lifestyle, tobacco consumption, and diet habits were strongly associated with prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes.

Likewise, in a household survey in Punjab, using World Health Organization STEP wise Surveillance (WHO STEPS) questionnaire, prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes were identified as 8.3% and 6.3% respectively.

Though the general practitioners in India are well aware of symptoms and complications of T2DM, they are oblivious regarding the use of standard screening tests resulting in significant delay in diagnosis and treatment. [51] \u2022 Considering significant resource constraints together with awareness levels of patients and physicians, there is a need for prevention strategies that are culturally relevant and cost-effective. [52] Following section covers evidence from Indian studies on various strategies that are helpful in detecting and minimizing the risk of development of diabetes and its associated complications. \u25ab Simplified tools for detection of diabetes such as IDRS developed by MDRF and Diabetes Risk Score for Asian Indians devised by Prof. A. Ramachandran are found to be useful for identifying undiagnosed patients with diabetes in India. Use of these tools could make screening programs more costeffective. [20, 21] Studies from different regions of India including Jammu, Kashmir, Chennai, Haryana, Delhi, Jabalpur, and Kerala estimated the utility of MDRF-IDRS in identifying risk for DM and prediabetes in Indian adult population and found statistically significant association between IDRS and DM patients indicating MDRF-IDRS to be efficient tool to screen and diagnose the huge pool of undiagnosed diabetics in India. [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] \u25ab It is also found by that identifying the presence of multiple risk factors could be used as a simple measure of identifying people at high risk of diabetes. [59] \u25ab The panel suggests that individuals with diabetes or at risk of developing diabetes should be advised on lifestyle changes and implementing strategies focusing on diet, exercise and weight loss to prevent the risk of progression and thus complications of diabetes. [60, 61] \u25ab Several landmark studies have shown that lifestyle intervention could prevent the progression to T2DM by about 30-60%. [62] Evidence from literature suggests that initial lifestyle interventions are cost-effective [63] and can significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes in Asian Indians with IGT or with combined IGT+IFG. [64] [65] [66] The evidence from the randomized, controlled, D-CLIP program showed that adding metformin in a stepwise manner to lifestyle education is an effective method for preventing or delaying diabetes in adults with prediabetes, even in a resource-challenged setting. During the 3 years of follow-up, the RRR was 32% (95% CI: in intervention participants compared with control. The RRR varied by prediabetes type (IFG+IGT, 36%; iIGT, 31%; iIFG, 12%; p = 0.77) and was stronger in patients aged \u226550 years, male, or obese. [66] \u25ab In patients in whom metformin is contraindicated, AGIs such as acarbose or voglibose may be used, as they confer lesser side effects compared to other OADs. Furthermore, lifestyle intervention with diet and exercise in those with IGT can significantly decrease the incidence of diabetes and its complications [67, 68] while providing long-term beneficial effects for up to 20 years. [69] \u25ab Several observational studies have reported an association between low levels of vitamin D and increased risk for T2DM, and a few clinical studies that vitamin D could improve the function of beta cells, which produce insulin. However, in the recent D2D study, vitamin D supplementation for a median 2.5 years did not significantly affect prevent T2DM development in a high-risk population. [70] \u25ab A systematic review and meta-analysis of 50 trials identified that lifestyle intervention reduced risk of progression to diabetes by 36% over 6 months to 6 years which attenuated to 20% by the time of follow-up results of the trials were measured. [30] Another systematic review and meta-analysis showed that physical activity in prediabetes subjects improves oral glucose tolerance, FPG and HbA1c levels, and maximum oxygen uptake and body composition. [71] Results indicated that physical activity promotion and participation slow down the progression of disease and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with T2DM. Optimal sleep (7-8 h/night) has been shown to maintain metabolic health, aid in weight loss, and increase insulin sensitivity, while short duration (<5-6 h) or longer duration (>8-9 h) of sleep was associated with increased risk of diabetes. [72, 73] Similar results were observed in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 articles which determined that the pooled relative risks for T2DM were 1.09 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.15) for each 1-h shorter sleep duration among individuals who slept <7 h/ day and 1.14 (1.03, 1.26) for each 1-h increment of sleep duration among individuals who slept longer, when compared to 7-h sleep/day. [74] \u25ab Interventions predominantly based on counselling and education are found to be effective in preventing/ reducing the risk of developing diabetes and its complication and also helps in improving dietary patterns of individuals with prediabetes and diabetes. [52, 75] Mobile phone messaging was found to be an inexpensive and most effective alternative way to deliver educational and motivational advice and support towards lifestyle modification in highrisk individuals. [23] Recent studies have proven the advantages of using mhealth strategies in promotion of prevention of NCDs. The WHO has recommended the use of such strategies for large scale programmes. [76, 77] \u25ab Dietary interventions such as high-carbohydrate, lowfat diet, [78] fibre-rich, [79] and protein-rich diet [80, 81] were found to have definite role in prevention of diabetes. Furthermore, components of whole grains, and fruit and green leafy vegetables such as cereal fibre and magnesium, are consistently associated with lower risk of developing T2DM. [80] \u25ab Evidence from the CURES and Prevention Awareness Counselling and Evaluation (PACE) diabetes project suggests that awareness and knowledge regarding diabetes is inadequate among patients in India and implementation of educational programs at massive level can greatly improve the awareness on diabetes and its associated CVD. [82, 83] Moreover, mass awareness and screening programs through community empowerment were found to effectively prevent and control diabetes and its complications such as foot amputations. [84] \u25ab A prospective, randomized controlled study of Fenugreek conducted in nondiabetic people with prediabetes demonstrated a significant reduction in FPG, PPG and LDL and showed insulinotropic effect. [85] \u25ab Currently, the role of yoga and fenugreek in the prevention of diabetes is being evaluated in the Indian prevention of Diabetes Study by RSSDI.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 342, "end": 346, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 544, "end": 548, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 740, "end": 741, "text": "\u25ab", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1044, "end": 1048, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1052, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1461, "end": 1465, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1470, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1471, "end": 1475, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1480, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1481, "end": 1485, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1490, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1650, "end": 1654, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1922, "end": 1926, "text": "[60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1927, "end": 1930, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2052, "end": 2056, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2147, "end": 2151, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2259, "end": 2263, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 2264, "end": 2268, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2269, "end": 2273, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 2787, "end": 2791, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 3103, "end": 3107, "text": "[67,", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 3108, "end": 3111, "text": "68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 3177, "end": 3181, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 3575, "end": 3579, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 3830, "end": 3834, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 4036, "end": 4040, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 4452, "end": 4456, "text": "[72,", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 4457, "end": 4460, "text": "73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 4840, "end": 4844, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 5104, "end": 5108, "text": "[52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 5109, "end": 5112, "text": "75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 5317, "end": 5321, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 5507, "end": 5511, "text": "[76,", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 5512, "end": 5515, "text": "77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 5580, "end": 5584, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 5597, "end": 5601, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 5624, "end": 5628, "text": "[80,", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 5629, "end": 5632, "text": "81]", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 5871, "end": 5875, "text": "[80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 6203, "end": 6207, "text": "[82,", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 6208, "end": 6211, "text": "83]", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 6393, "end": 6397, "text": "[84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 6596, "end": 6600, "text": "[85]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "EvIDEnCE"}, {"text": "A clear and transparent decision should be made about whether or not to endorse a screening strategy.

[100, 101] Recent studies support the implementation of a long-term high-carbohydrate high-fibre diet in promoting weight loss, improving glycaemic control, and lowering CV risk. [102] [103] [104] [105] High carbohydrate diets should comprise large amounts of unrefined carbohydrate and fibre such as legumes, whole grains, unprocessed vegetables, and fruits. [87, 106, 107] High carbohydrate diet regimens in T2DM patients have been associated with favourable weight loss and reductions in plasma glucose, HbA1c and LDL levels with good adherence and sustainability, comparable with low carbohydrate diets. The concern of possible untoward effect of high carbohydrate diet on lipid profile (increase in triglycerides and reductions in HDL) and CV risk can be mitigated by lowering the glycaemic index of diets by incorporating fibre-rich foods. [99] \u2022 Cross-sectional data from the CURES suggests that Indians consume high amounts of refined grains (~47% of total calories), which is associated with significant increases in waist circumference (p<0.0001), systolic blood pressure (p<0.0001), diastolic blood pressure (p=0. ) that escalates the risk of T2DM. It was observed that refined cereals contributed to nearly 46% of total energy intake, followed by visible fats and oils (12.4%), pulses and legumes (7.8%), and intake of micronutrient-rich foods (fruits, vegetables, fish etc.) was inadequate and below the recommended standards of FAO/WHO. [109] \u2022 Given that carbohydrates are an inherent part of the staple Indian diet and Indians habitually tend to consume high amounts of carbohydrates, improving the quality of carbohydrates in the diet by replacing high-GI carbohydrates with fibre-rich, low GI counterparts. [110] It was observed that consumption of brown rice significantly reduced 24-h glycaemic response 24-h (p=0.02) and fasting insulin response (p=0.0001) in overweight Asian Indians. [111] \u2022 Replacement of white rice with brown rice was found to be feasible and culturally appropriate in Indian overweight adults and correlated with lower risk of T2DM. [112] Fortification of humble Indian dishes with fibre-rich alternatives, for example adding soluble fibre in the form of oats in upma or improving the glycaemic quality of Indian flatbreads (rotis or chapattis) by adding wheat flour with soluble viscous fibres and legume flour have shown favourable outcomes on the lipid profile and postprandial glucose and insulin responses in T2DM patients. [113] [114] [115] [116] \u2022 Sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages increase the dietary GL. Overall, the consumption of total sugar (25.0 kg/capita) among Indians exceeds the average global annual per capita consumption (23.7 kg). \u2022 Consumption of sweets, sweetened beverages (e. g. lassi, aamras) or addition of sugars in curries, gravies etc. have customary and regional importance in India. [117] It is observed that in urban South India, the added sugars in hot beverages (tea or coffee) majorly contribute to sugar intake and account for around 3.6% of total GL.

[65, 157] baCkGRounD T2DM occurs due to a complex interaction between genetic inheritance and risk factors such as obesity and sedentary lifestyle. [158] Diminished insulin secretion, incretin deficiency/resistance, upregulated lipolysis, increased glucose reabsorption from kidney, along with downregulated glucose uptake, neurotransmitter dysfunction, increased hepatic glucose production, and glucagon secretion are the reported metabolic derailments that contribute to hyperglycaemia and T2DM [ Figure 2 ]. [159] Among Indians, high familial aggregation, central obesity, insulin resistance, and life style changes due to rapid urbanization are the primary causes of T2DM. [160] Greater degree of insulin resistance paired with higher central adiposity compared to Caucasians is a characteristic feature of T2DM in Asian Indians. [161, 162] Treatment options for T2DM have been developed in parallel to the increased understanding of underlying pathophysiological defects in T2DM. A patient-centric and evidence-based approach that may take into account all the metabolic derailments accompanying T2DM, is now gaining impetus. Therefore, treatments that target factors beyond glycaemic control, such cardiovascular risks, weight management, along with improvements in quality of life have been introduced.

[165] Metformin is efficacious in managing hyperglycaemia, increasing insulin sensitivity, along with beneficial effects in reducing cardiovascular and hypoglycaemia risk, improving macrovascular outcomes, and lowering mortality rates in T2DM. [166] Metformin is a complex drug that exerts its action via multiple sites and several molecular mechanisms. Metformin is known to down regulate the hepatic glucose production, act on the gut to m 2 and must be contraindicated in patients with an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . [164] Sulfonylureas Sulfonylureas are second line agents used in patients with T2DM patients who are not obese. Sulfonylureas are insulin secretagogues that act on the ATP-sensitive K+ channels on the \u03b2 cells and stimulate endogenous insulin secretion. [171] As a single therapy, sulfonylureas are efficacious in lowering fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c. However, concerns of modest weight gain and moderate to severe hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular risk limit their clinical benefits. [172] As a consequence of closure of cardiac K ATP channel, the use of sulfonylureas have also been related to adverse CV effects due to impaired hypoxic coronary vasodilation during increased oxygen demands such as acute myocardial ischemia. [173] The use of glibenclamide was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with diabetes and acute myocardial infarction. [174] Adverse cardiovascular outcomes with sulfonylureas in some observational studies have raised concerns, although findings from recent meta-analysis that included several RCTs reported that sulfonylureas when added to metformin were not associated with allcause mortality and CV mortality. [175] New generation sulfonylureas have demonstrated superior safety, mainly due to reducing hypoglycaemia, and improved cardiac profile. Sulfonylureas particularly gliclazide modified release (MR) and glimepiride have a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and are preferred in south Asian T2DM patients. [176] Caution must be exercised while prescribing sulfonylureas for patients at a increase glucose utilisation, enhance insulin, increase GLP-1 and alter the microbiome. [167] TheUK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Group study in over weight T2DM patients suggested that intensive glucose control that metformin lowered the risk of diabetes-related endpoints, diabetesrelated deaths, and all-cause mortality in overweight T2DM patients, compared to insulin and sulphonylureas. [168] A 10-year follow-up study of the UKPDS reported continued benefit following intensive glucose control with metformin in terms of reduced diabetes-related endpoints, diabetesrelated deaths, and all-cause mortality. [169] Along with substantial improvements in hyperglycaemia, metformin improved endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, lipid profiles, and fat redistribution. [170] Owing to the concerns of lactic acidosis and gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting diarrhoea and flatulence) metformin should be used cautiously in patients with renal insufficiency or elderly patients. In patients with an eGFR <60 mL/ min/1.73 m 2 metformin can be used, but should not be initiated in patients with an eGFR of 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 high risk of hypoglycaemia, older patients and patients with CKD. [177] Shorter-acting secretagogues, the meglitinides (or glinides), also stimulate insulin release through similar mechanisms and may be associated with comparatively less hypoglycaemia but they require more frequent dosing. Moreover, modern sulfonylureas exhibit more reductions of HbA1c than glinides. [178] Thiazolidinediones Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b3 activators that improve insulin sensitivity by increasing insulin-mediated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, suppressing hepatic glucose output, and improving the secretory response of insulin in pancreatic \u03b2-cells. [179] The risk of hypoglycaemia is negligible and TZDs may be more durable in their effectiveness than sulfonylureas. [180] TZDs have been constantly under the authority scrutiny for their cardiovascular safety. A meta-analysis considering data from 42 trials and 27,847 patients indicated that treatment with rosiglitazone was associated with an increase in the odds of MI (odds ratio 1.43, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.98, p=0.03) and a nonsignificant increase in the odds of cardiovascular death (odds ratio 1.64, 95% CI 0.98: 2.74, p=0.06) compared with a control group (active comparator or placebo). [181] The RECORD study evaluated the effect of rosiglitazone (plus metformin or sulfonylurea) in lowering the combined end point of hospitalization or cardiovascular death versus metformin plus sulfonylurea. Although, rosiglitazone did not increase the risk of overall cardiovascular morbidity or mortality it increased the risks of heart failures causing admission to hospital or death when compared to the active controls (HR: 2.10, 95% CI, 1.35:3.27). [182] Conversely, pioglitazone is known to exert pleotropic effects on cardiovascular event; pioglitazone improves endothelial dysfunction, lowers hypertension, improves dyslipidaemia, and lowers circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines and prothrombotic factors. [183] In the PROactive study, pioglitazone lowered the composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke in T2DM patients with at risk of macrovascular events along with improvements in HbA1c, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL levels. However, rate of heart failure was increased. [184] TZDs have demonstrated beneficial effects in attenuating dyslipidaemia commonly observed in patients with chronic T2DM. Rosiglitazone treatment with metformin showed an HDL increase of 13.3%, LDL increase of 18.6% and a neutral effect on total cholesterol, following 26 weeks of treatment. [185] Furthermore, the IRIS trial was among the 1st studies to document the CV benefits of TZDs in non-diabetic individuals. Pioglitazone improved CV outcomes (recurrent stroke and MI) and prevented the development of T2DM in insulin-resistant, non-diabetic patients with cerebrovascular disease. [186] In a recent post hoc study of the IRIS trial, conducted in prediabetic population, pioglitazone effectively lowered the risk of stroke, MI, acute coronary syndrome, and hospitalization for heart failure. [187] Pioglitazone had been linked with a possible increased risk of bladder cancer, possibly in a dose-and time-dependent manner. [188, 189] However data from a retrospective study in India involving 2222 (pioglitazone users, n = 1111; pioglitazone non-users, n = 1111) T2DM patients found no evidence of bladder cancer in any of the group, including patients with age >60 years, duration of diabetes >10 years, and uncontrolled diabetes. [190] Recognized side effects of TZDs include weight gain (3-5 kg) , fluid retention leading to oedema, and/or heart failure in predisposed individuals and patients with increased risk of bone fractures. [180, 184, 190] Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors Vildagliptin, saxagliptin, gemigliptin, evogliptin sitagliptin, teneligliptin, and linagliptin are incretin enhancers; they enhance circulating concentrations of active GLP-1 and gastric intestinal polypeptide (GIP). [191] These incretins stimulates insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon synthesis, lower hepatic gluconeogenesis, and slow gastric emptying. Their major effect is the regulation of insulin and glucagon secretion; they are weight neutral. [192] DPP-4 inhibitors are efficient in improving glycaemia both as monotherapy and as add-on to metformin, sulfonylurea and TZDs in patients with inadequate glycaemic control. A reduction in HbA1c levels from baseline of 8.1% was observed with sitagliptin monotherapy (100 mg:-0.5%, 200 mg:-0.6%) in 521 patients treated for 18 weeks. Additionally, homeostasis model assessment of beta cell function index, fasting proinsulin-insulin ratio which are the markers of insulin secretion, and beta cell function were also improved significantly. [193] The overall incidence of adverse events with sitagliptin is comparable to other OADs when used as monotherapy or as add-on to existing OADs. [194] Adverse effects (AEs) such as constipation, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and dizziness are the commonly reported AEs with the use of these agents. [195] Cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) studies with DPP-4 inhibitors have shown that these agents are safe in patients with established CVD and those at increased risk of CVD except for increased risk of heart failure risk. [196] Results of the SAVOR-TIMI study and EXAMINE Study have reported higher rates of hospitalization for heart failure with saxagliptin and alogliptin, respectively. [197, 198] Owing to the increased risk of hospitalization due to heart failure in patients with cardiovascular disease, the US FDA issued a warning, suggesting the associated risk to be a \"class-effect\" of the DPP-4 inhibitors and issued a warning for their use. [199] However, some landmark studies have been conducted to evaluate relationship between these drugs and the adverse effects. In the CARMELINA study, linagliptin demonstrated a long-term CV safety profile in patients with T2D, including those with CV and/or kidney disease and no increased risk of hospitalisation for heart failure versus placebo was reported. [200] The CAROLINA study was designed to evaluate the long-term CV safety profile of linagliptin versus glimepiride in patients with early T2D at increased CV risk. Recently released top line results highlight a non-inferiority between linagliptin versus glimepiride in time to first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke (3P-MACE) with a median follow-up of more than 6 years. [201] Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors They provide insulin-independent glucose-lowering by blocking glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubule. The capacity of tubular cells to reabsorb glucose is reduced by SGLT2 inhibitors leading to increased urinary glucose excretion and consequently, correction of the hyperglycaemia. [202] Dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and remogliflozin are the 4 Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) approved agents used in patients with T2DM. [203, 204] The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial evaluated the non-inferior cardiovascular safety of empagliflozin in high-CV-risk T2D patients with an estimated glomerular filtration ate (eGFR) of at least 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Empagliflozin reduced the rate of new onset or worsening nephropathy, which were defined as new-onset microalbuminuria, doubling of creatinine, and eGFR \u226445 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , initiation of renal replacement therapy, and death due to renal disease (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.70; p<0.0001). [205] A secondary analysis of CANTA-SU study confirmed the renoprotective effects of canagliflozin. The eGFR decline was significantly slower in patients receiving canagliflozin than in those receiving glimepiride (0.5 mL/min/1. . [206] The CANVAS Program integrated data from two trials involving a total of 10,142 participants with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Treatment with canagliflozin showed a possible benefit with respect to the progression of albuminuria (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.79) and the composite outcome of a sustained 40% reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, the need for renalreplacement therapy, or death from renal causes (HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.77). [207] Canagliflozin in combination with metformin significantly improved glycaemic control in patients with T2DM and significant weight loss along with low incidence of hypoglycaemia have been reported. [208] A recent meta-analysis concluded that SGLT2 inhibitors, as a class, significantly reduce 24-h ambulatory blood pressure further substantiating their favourable cardiovascular profile. [209] The most common AEs involving this class are genital mycotic infections, which are believed to be mild and respond favourably to anti-fungal therapy.

Visual loss from DR could be due to diabetic macular edema (DME: swelling in the retinal macula) or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Factors such as longer duration of diabetes and poorer glycaemic and BP control were found to be strongly associated with DR.

Microalbuminuria was positively correlated with the presence of retinopathy in T2DM patients and may be a marker for the risk of severe and proliferative retinopathy development. Microalbuminuria was associated cross-sectionally with the presence of retinopathy in patients with T2DM. This study suggests that microalbuminuria may be a marker for the risk of proliferative retinopathy development.

[399, 400] Peripheral neuropathy in diabetes appears in several forms depending on the site, manifesting as sensory, focal/multifocal, and autonomic neuropathies. Diabetic neuropathy has resulted in more than 80% amputations after foot ulceration or injury. It is among the most common, expensive and disabling complications of diabetes, affecting approximately 30% of hospitalized patients with diabetes and 25% of patients with diabetes in the community.

It is recommended that once a screening test detects microalbuminuria, it should be confirmed with additional spot urine tests over the next three to six months. The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI)-Clinical Practice Guidelines and Clinical Practice Recommendations for Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease by the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), recommend that patients with diabetes should be screened annually for DKD: 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and from onset/diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The presence of albuminuria must be evaluated based on the UAE concentration or Urinary albumin-tocreatinine ratio (UACR) in untimed (spot) urine specimens and by estimating the glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine measurements by using prediction equations.

[545, 546] In addition, physical exercise, weight control, lifestyle modification with changing food habits, and cessation of smoking also prevents the CVD risk in T2DM patients. [545] \u2022 Diet: In the PURE study (N=135,335), a diet rich in carbohydrates was shown to be associated with higher risk of total mortality. Surprisingly, both, total fat and individual fat type were not correlated with CVD, CVD-related mortality or MI. In fact, saturated fat had an inverse correlation to stroke. [547] Therefore, a high carbohydrate intake is a potent risk factor of CVD and mortality. Current nutritional recommendations for patients with T2DM propose restricting the total carbohydrate intake to ~45-50% of the total energy. Moreover, there is increased focus on the quality of carbohydrate intake, with an emphasis on including complex carbohydrates like brown rice and whole grain wheat into the diet. [548] \u2022 Substitution of dietary saturated fat with PUFAs is reported to be associated with improved CV outcomes. Moreover, American Family Physicians (AFP) advocates that the Mediterranean diet can reduce CV mortality and the DASH eating plan is associated with a reduced risk of CHD. [549] Moreover, the following dietary adaptations can be made to lessen the development of CVDs in T2DM patients: reductions in caloric intake (by 500 kcal/day to 800 kcal/day), total fat intake (especially saturated fat) and food portion sizes, increased consumption of dietary fiber, and moderate alcohol use. [550] \u2022 Physical activity: It is an independent and protective risk factor associated with reduced CV morbidity and mortality (OR, 0.86; p<0.0001), and physical inactivity accounts for 12.2% of the population-attributable risk for acute MI and 6% of CHD with an estimated 0. 68 year reduction in life expectancy. [549] The exercisebased cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is the cornerstone for secondary prevention of CVD. CR is associated with a 13% and 26% lower all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively and a 31% reduction in hospital admissions at 12 months in patients with CHD.

[568] [569] [570] \u2022 A recent meta-analysis investigating 4,351 diabetes patients reported that compared with placebo, standard-dose statin treatment resulted in a significant RRR of 15% in the occurrence of any major CV or cerebrovascular event (RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.91). Compared with standarddose statin treatment (simvastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg), intensive-dose statin (simvastatin 80 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg) treatment resulted in an additional 9% RRR. [571] \u2022 Moreover, statins were reported to produce similar results in various studies in India. [572, 573] Evidence advocates atorvastatin has negligible or no ability to increase HDL-C, which is the key feature in patients with diabetes. Thus, other statins should probably be preferred to atorvastatin in patients with diabetes/MS. [574] \u2022 In addition ADA recommend that, either high intensity or moderate intensity statin therapy should be used together with lifestyle intervention according to patient age and ASCVD risk factors [2, 534] The details have been given in Annexure 6. The Lipid Association of India expert consensus statement 2016 revealed that statin therapy is highly effective in lowering NHDL-C, LDL-C, apolipoprotein B, and remnant cholesterol, besides being remarkably safe. [45] Recent evidence shows a clear CVD benefit of lowering LDL-C with ezetimibe on top of a statin in patients with T2DM. [575] \u2022 Furthermore, in CHD/CHD risk-equivalent patients ezetimibe addition onto simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin provided greater LDL-C reductions and goal attainment than those who up-titrated these statin therapies. [576] The Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study assessed the effect of fenofibrate on CV events in T2DM patients. Fenofibrate reduced total CV events, mainly due to fewer non-fatal MI and revascularizations but, did not significantly reduce the risk of coronary events such as CHD death or non-fatal MI. [577] \u2022 Furthermore, USFDA states that the current evidence base is insufficient to support fibrates for CVD protection and that more trial evidence is needed. [578] Nonetheless, prescribing lipid-lowering agents in older people with T2DM (>85 years) requires special consideration because exposure to higher doses (or higher potency) might increase the risk of adverse effects instead of improving life expectancy. \u2022 Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) regulates degradation of LDL-receptors (LDLR). PCSK9 inhibitors, such as evolocumab and alirocumab, have been shown to enhance recirculation of LDLRs to the surface of hepatocyte cells and accelerate clearance of circulating LDL-C. PCSK9 inhibitors can prove to be a valuable treatment option for statin-intolerant patients. [579] Glucose lowering drugs [275] \u2022 DPP4, dipeptidyl peptidase 4; GIP, gastric inhibitory polypetide; GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1;SGLT2, sodium-glucose transport protein 2. \u2022 In a meta-analysis of 301 clinical trials, the CVD risk of all glucose-lowering drugs including; metformin, sulphonylurea, thiazolidinedione, DPP4 inhibitor, AGI, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 analogue, meglitinides, and insulins, were evaluated. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in the association between any of the nine glucose-lowering drugs alone or in combination and risk of CV mortality. [580] \u2022 Two SGLT2 inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, were recently shown to provide CV benefits in patients with T2DM. Empagliflozin was reported to produce substantial reductions in CVD death (38%) and all-cause mortality (32%), as well as in hospitalization for HF (35%), as compared with standard-of-care in EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. [205] In the recently published CANVAS trial, canagliflozin significantly reduced the composite of death from CV causes, non-fatal MI, or nonfatal stroke (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.97; p<0.001 for non-inferiority; p=0.02 for superiority) in T2DM patients with established CVD or at high risk for CV events. [207] \u2022 Similarly in LEADER trial, liraglutide 1.8 mg daily was associated with lower rates (patients) of death from CV causes (4.7% vs. 6.0%, HR, 0.78; 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.93; p=0.007) or any causes (8.2% vs 9.6%, HR, 0.85; 0.74 to 0.97; p=0.02) compared to placebo in patients with T2DM. [237] Therefore, using these medications early in the course of management in high risk T2DM patients could provide potential benefits from looming CVDs. \u2022 Furthermore, recently released top-line results from the, CAROLINA trial (NCT01243424) showed that linagliptin was comparable to glimepiride vis-\u00e0-vis their impact on CV morbidity and mortality in patients with T2DM, after a median follow-up of 6.3 years. [581] \u2022 In the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial where patients were either randomized to saxagliptin or placebo, treatment with saxagliptin was associated with a 27% increased relative risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients assigned to saxagliptin. [197] The risk was highest in patients with elevated levels of natriuretic peptides, previous heart failure or chronic kidney disease. [582] \u2022 Except saxagliptin, other DPP-4 inhibitors are cardiovascular neutral and therefore safe for the heart.

[134, 593] For adults, WHO defines overweight as BMI of \u226525 kg/m 2 and obesity as BMI of \u226530 kg/m 2 . [594] However, WHO and International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) suggested BMI cut-offs of 23 and 25 kg/m 2 for Asian Indian adults for overweight and obesity, respectively. [595, 596] Furthermore, the World Health Organization Asia Pacific Guidelines defined generalized obesity (GO, BMI \u226525kg/m 2 ), AO (WC \u226590 cm for men and \u226580cm for women) and combined obesity (CO, GO plus AO) for Asian population. [595, 597] In India, the prevalence of obesity is rising at an alarming rate, especially affecting urban population. [134, 598] The ICMR-INDIAB study currently report that 135, 153 and 107 million individuals in India will have GO, AO and CO, respectively inextrapolation to the whole country. [597, 599] Furthermore, female gender, hypertension, diabetes, higher socio-economic status, physical inactivity and urban residence were significantly associated with obesity in Indian populations. Indians are at increased predisposition to diabetes that has been attributed to the \"Asian Indian Phenotype\" characterized by lesser GO as measured by BMI and greater central body obesity and more truncal fat as shown by greater WC and WHR. [44, 134, [600] [601] [602] [603] Abdominal obesity contributes significantly to metabolic alterations such as IR, dysglycemia and dyslipidaemia. [45, 598, [603] [604] [605] [606] T2DM is closely linked to obesity, particularly adult weight gain, and is the main contributor to rising healthcare costs. Whilst it seldom develops with BMI <21 kg/m 2 , most people with T2DM have a BMI >25 kg/m 2 and around 50% have a BMI >30 kg/m 2 . [607] High consumption of sugars among children and adults in India may also have clinical significance in view of the high tendency for Indians to develop IR, abdominal adiposity, and hepatic steatosis, and the increasing \"epidemic\" of T2DM. [117, 134] Because Asians Indians tend to develop diabetes at a significantly lower BMI and WC than white Europeans, lower thresholds of BMI to define overweight (BMI: 23-24.9 kg/m 2 ) and obesity (BMI \u226525 kg/m 2 ) were proposed by IDF and National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE). [608, 609] In light of increasing prevalence of obesity in both developed and developing countries and a higher risk for developing IR, dyslipidemia, dysglycaemia and a higher CVrisk at lower levels of BMI in Indians, a consensus meeting was convened in New Delhi in 2008 [610] to redefine the cut-offs for BMI and WC for diagnosing overweight and obesity in Indian population. According to this consensus statement, a BMI of 18-22.9 kg/ m 2 should be considered as normal, a BMI of 23-24.9 kg/ m 2 should be considered as overweight, and BMI \u226525 kg/m 2 indicates presence of obesity.

[617] \u2022 The lifestyle interventions for overweight or obese T2DM patients should be based on the principle of decreased energy intake and increased energy expenditure to produce the negative energy balance. This includes low-calorie diet with higher intake of fibre, lower intake of saturated fats, optimal ratio of essential fatty acids, reduction in trans fatty acids, slightly higher protein intake, lower intake of salt, and restricted intake of sugar. [618] High-protein meal replacement diet-based intervention in overweight/obese Asian Indians has shown significant reduction in weight, abdominal obesity, blood pressure, lipids, glycaemic parameters and hepatic enzymes compared with a standard control diet in Indians. [94] Although studies assessing the ideal amount of carbohydrate intake for people with diabetes are inconclusive, modifying carbohydrate intake considering the blood glucose response is of value, especially in the Indian context, where carbohydrate intakes across all regions of India could be very high. \u2022 Behavioural therapy should address modifiable factors such as eating patterns and exercise habits that can have significant impact on the management of obesity. A review in Indian scenario suggested that slow eating techniques along with stimulus control (not distracted by television, books, or other materials) have positive effect on weight loss. [619] In obese T2DM patients, IDF recommends not only moderate calorie restriction, but also moderate increase in physical activity as a part of behavioural therapy in order to promote weight loss (5-10% loss of body weight in the first year). [620] Other important components of behavioural therapy embrace self-monitoring, goal setting and stimulus or cue control. Such strategies help in setting up realistic goals, guide patients in identifying stimulus that lead to excessive nutrient intake and eliminate them accordingly. [621] \u2022 Bodyweight has been shown to be inversely associated with physical activity. [622] Patients with low physical activity have 3-fold greater risk of major weight gain in men and almost a 4-fold in women. [623, 624] Moreover, this association was stronger for women than for men and for obese compared to normal weight or overweight individuals. [625] Furthermore, slow and prolonged exercise is associated with improved fat metabolism in muscle and better conservation of muscle mass during dietary restriction. [626, 627] An RCT comprising 262 sedentary men and women reported that combination of aerobic and resistance training exercise reduced WC from \u22121.9 to \u22122.8 cm and mean fat mass of \u22121.7 (\u22122.3 to \u22121.1 kg; p<0.05) compared with the non-exercise group. [628] Physical activity, which includes aerobic activity, workrelated activity and muscle strengthening activity should be prescribed at the individual, community and societal level to help Asian Indians become more physically active [ Table 17 ]. As per the WHO, the recommended levels of physical activity for adults (18-64 years) for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity weekly or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity weekly. [ At 24 months, 64% of those who had lost more than 10 kg, were still in remission. [630, 631] \u2022 The findings of the randomized controlled PREVIEW lifestyle intervention study reported that the total physical activity accounts for greater variance in IR and some related cardiometabolic risk factors as compared with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.

[637] Use of GLP-1receptor agonists, [254] SGLT-2 inhibitors, [255, 638] and to some extents DPP-4 inhibitors [257, 258] have been shown to induce weight loss and should be considered as add-on to metformin in obese T2DM patients. Furthermore, GLOBE study report that fixed dose combination (FDC) of acarbose/metformin in Indian T2DM patients was associated with significant reduction in body weight (-1.7\u00b12.2 kg compared to control (p<0.0001)).

[36] A survey on 274 elderly people in Turkey revealed that the proportion of diabetes patients vaccinated for influenza or pneumococcus or tetanus as 38.1%, 13.4% and 9.28% respectively. [37] \u2022 Perception, knowledge, and misconception that vaccines are infective and cause side effects are some of the barriers for avoiding vaccination. [35, 36] \u2022 Maintaining a diabetes registry, systemic tracking system, and reminder system serve as tools for improvising the acceptance to vaccination and communicating with the subjects for the need of vaccination which provides awareness on immunization. [36, 38] The combined used of patient outreach letters, special immunization clinics, standing orders, and practitioner reminders on medical records resulted in a remarkable 15 fold increase in pneumococcal vaccinations in diabetes patients in Guam, United States. [39] Similarly, a combination of strategies including dissemination of guidelines, advice on setting up disease and vaccine registers, call and recall systems and benchmarking of performance remarkably improved influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates in high-risk individual groups including diabetes patients in the United Kingdom. [40] Periodic training of the staff accompanied by ongoing assessment of immunization rates and work flow and also a close follow up with the patient or his care giver by the treatment team is beneficial in minimizing the risk of inappropriate re-vaccinations. [41] \u2022 The protocols should also aim at implementing a quality assurance process so that the standards of care are maintained. [42] ImplEmEntatIon Apart from the micro-and macro-vascular events in diabetes, infections due to influenza and pneumococci should be considered as significant public health concern.

[660] [661] [662] Sexual dysfunction (SD) in diabetics is a neglected aspect in India, primarily due to minimal communication time between physician and patient, lack of privacy during doctor visits and the taboo factor. In men with diabetes, erectile dysfunction (ED) as a result of autonomic neuropathy is commonly observed and the prevalence odds as compared with controls is more than 3.5 times. [663] In a study conducted in a hospital in New Delhi, Sondhi et al. observed the prevalence of ED to be 78.7% in men with T2DM versus 46% in non-diabetics and a significant correlation between duration of diabetes and ED. [664] Furthermore, the Massachusetts male aging study demonstrated that the risk of ED is double in aged diabetics versus the general population. [665] Diabetic neuropathy, impaired relaxation of cavernosal smooth muscle due to altered cyclic guanosine monophosphate/nitric oxide pathway and risk of decreased testosterone levels resulting from hypogonadism can constitute the underlying pathology of ED. [666, 667] Other sexual complications in men with diabetes include ejaculatory dysfunction and hypogonadism. The recent ADA guideline recommends testing for serum testosterone concentration in men with diabetes who have symptoms of hypogonadism. [668] Compared with men, SD in women with diabetes is rarely investigated and most often untreated. Particularly in countries like India where gender inequality and cultural disparity is high, management strategies for tackling such health concerns are almost nonexistent. [669] However, the findings of a meta-analysis showed that the risk of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) was two times higher (OR [95%CI], 2.02 [1.49, 2.72] ) and correlated with a low Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score in women with diabetes as compared with nondiabetics. [670] FSD is an intricate condition involving both physiological and psychosocial changes and includes hypoactive sexual desire disorder, arousal and lubrication disorder, pain during sexual intercourse, and loss of ability to achieve orgasm. [671] Hyperglycemia decreases the hydration of the vaginal mucosa and lubrication of the vagina, and is the cause of genitourinary infections and dyspareunia. The vascular complications and endothelial dysfunction may impact blood supply to clitoris and lead to poor lubrication of the vagina, and reduced arousal and dyspareunia. [660] Diabetic neuropathy may cause structural and functional changes in the female genitalia and can disrupt the balance between receiving sexual stimuli and sexual response triggers. Hormonal imbalances in levels of estrogen and androgens can lead to FSD in women with diabetes. In a study from North India conducted in women with diabetes it was observed that 45.19% complained of desire disorder, 62.71% of arousal disorder, 84.75% of orgasmic disorder and 20.38% experienced pain disorder; the incidence of these disorder was higher in older women.

In a cross-sectional study, the mean HbA1c in patients with controlled diabetes with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) was significantly higher than those without IDA (7.86 \u00b1 0.11% vs 5.45 \u00b1 0.038% [p<0.05]) and the HbA1c values were inversely proportional to total haemoglobin (p<0.05). [714] \u2022 Further, significantly higher HbA1c levels are observed in patients with IDA than healthy individuals (5.51 \u00b1 0.696 v/s 4.85 \u00b1 0.461%, p<0.001) and the HbA1c levels significantly decline following iron supplementation (p<0.001). [35] Therefore, HbA1c results in diabetes patients with IDA should be interpreted carefully. IDA has to be corrected before a proper diagnosis is made. \u2022 Measurement of blood glucose using blood glucose meters on admission to hospital wards helps to identify patients with hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. Considering that in developing nations like India, where cost is major barrier for monitoring, these devices should be accurate, cost effective and field testing specifically tailored for Asian and Indian needs is imperative. [715] \u2022 A study that assessed knowledge and attitude towards self-monitoring and the impact of SMBG on glycaemic control revealed that patients who monitored \u22653 times had significantly better glycaemic control of HbA1c (7.1-8%) than those who monitored <3 times (p=0.021). [716] Insulin self-titration interventions based on structured SMBG are associated with significant reduction in HbA1c during a follow-up of 12 weeks with a trend towards greater effectiveness in improving glycaemic control than conventional treatment, with no increase in incidence of hypoglycaemia or body weight gain. [717] Comparative studies in patients with T2DM on insulin across cohorts of regular SMBG users versus SMBG non-users have demonstrated that HbA1c levels in regular SMBG users were lower by 0.7-1.1%.

CGM concluded that it can effectively help healthcare professionals with insights for initiating changes to treatment regimens, diet and exercise behaviours and provided patients with improved knowledge of the importance of therapy compliance by demonstrable reductions in HbA1c. [722] \u2022 A retrospective analysis based on a blinded study of glycaemic control in 296 T2DM adults using masked professional CGM (P-CGM) revealed that the predominant pattern of hyperglycaemia was postprandial while previously unknown hypoglycaemia was found in 38% of the patients; over half of the cases were nocturnal. The mean HbA1c of the P-CGM group significantly dropped at 6 months from baseline (P < 0.0001). The frequency of performing SMBG was also found to be significantly increased. P-CGM motivated the patients for diabetes self-care practices, resulting in an improvement in glycaemic control over a wide range of baseline therapies.

In instances where HbA1c measurement is inappropriate, such individuals must be identified by careful review of haematological parameters and other factors that can affect HbA1c values. Provision of capillary blood glucose meters and strips need to be assured in hospitals and clinics. It is important to ascertain whether there are contraindications for use of a particular type of glucose meter in a particular patient. It is essential to establish whether glucose meters report values for plasma or blood and to ensure that schemes for monitoring the quality of their output are in place.

Classic CDSSs may include various features like alerts, reminders, order sets, drug-dose calculators etc. that automatically remind the doctors of a specific action, or care summary dashboards that provide performance feedback on quality indicators thereby ensuring patient safety and improved health outcomes. Both commercially and locally developed CDSSs have been found to be effective at improving healthcare process measures across diverse settings.

[798] [799] [800] Surgeries in patients with diabetes can be categorized as major or minor. Major inpatient surgeries are defined as procedures requiring general, epidural, or spinal anaesthesia for \u22651 h as well as hospitalization for >1 day while all other outpatient procedures may be defines as minor surgeries. [801, 802] Surgical procedures may result in a number of metabolic perturbations that can alter normal glucose homeostasis. Persistent hyperglycaemia prior to and during surgical procedures may lead to postoperative complications like cerebral ischemia, endothelial dysfunction, postoperative sepsis, acute renal failure and surgical site infection (most common complication) and may also impair wound healing in patients with diabetes. [803, 804] Surgical stress may lead to hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS), the most common postoperative complication associated with 42% mortality rate along with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during or after surgery. [802, 803, 805] Furthermore, increased stress leads to increase in the counter regulatory hormones causing insulin resistance and the resulting hyperglycaemia impairs neutrophil function and trigger overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species which causes vascular and immune dysfunction, and cellular damage. [804] Therefore, to minimize these negative consequences and improve the postoperative outcomes it is important to carefully manage the glycaemic level in diabetic patients undergoing major surgeries including orthopaedic and cardiac. [805] The treatment recommendations for patients with T2DM should be individualized-based on the severity of diabetes, usual their standard diabetes regimen, level of glycemic control, types of surgical procedures (major/minor). [802] Overall, the management goal in diabetic patients undergoing surgery should be optimization of metabolic control, adequate fluid repletion and postoperative care management with or without insulin to improve surgical outcomes.

[806] Perioperative glycaemic targets and assessment Preoperatively, the ADA recommends a perioperative glucose target of 80 to 180mg/dL as reasonable blood glucose maintenance. It is mandatory that the preoperative evaluation for surgical procedures must be conducted and must include assessment of glycaemic control and presence of any diabetesrelated complications. Measurement of serum creatinine level to assess DKD, haemoglobin HbA1c, and blood glucose level are the critical baseline laboratory data that must be assessed.

[807] OADs mainly sulfonylureas and meglitinides, in fasting state have potential to cause hypoglycaemia and trigger endogenous secretion of insulin, independent of the glucose level, hence should be discontinued 1 day before surgery. Further, sulfonylureas and meglitinides increase the risk of myocardial ischemic injury and may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. [808] SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with high risks for DKA and volume depletion. There have been a number of case reports of euglycemic ketoacidosis in the perioperative setting and hence SGLT-2 inhibitors should be stopped a day prior to surgery. [809] [810] [811] DPP-4 inhibitors may be discontinued before surgery; however, in a recent study establishing the safety and efficacy of sitagliptin alone or sitagliptin in combination with basal insulin in hospitalized medical and surgical patients demonstrated good tolerability and low risk of hypoglycaemia and can be considered as a viable option in the perioperative setting. [806, 812] Due to slow gastric motility GLP-1 agonists (exenatide, liraglutide) are usually withheld the day before surgery. [809, 813] However, in cardiac and noncardiac surgical patients addition of a GLP-1 agonists to insulin therapy has demonstrated improved perioperative glycaemic control. [814, 815] AGIs (acarbose, miglitol) lower the absorption of glucose after meals, but these agents do not have any effect in the preoperative fasting states, and hence should be discontinued until the patient resumes eating. [816] TZDs should be avoided due to risks like congestive heart failure, fluid retention and peripheral oedema. [812] Patients treated with insulin Insulin being the most preferred choice of drug for patients undergoing surgery the basal-bolus regimen is the best protocol as it is associated with improved glycaemic control and lower perioperative complications. [807] Continuing at least part of the basal insulin is the reasonable, physiologic approach to controlling glucose levels before surgery in patients with diabetes. Basal bolus regimens are also associated with reduced postoperative complications and reduced inpatient costs per day. The dose of usual basal insulin can be reduced by 20-30% if patient reports nocturnal or fasting hypoglycaemic history. [817] Long-acting insulins demonstrate lesser peaks and hence do not result in hypoglycaemia during fasting states. It is advised that long-acting insulins must be taken as close as possible to the usual time of injection, preoperatively. The intermediate-acting insulin neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) is usually given 2 times daily. Premixed insulins (combinations of basal and prandial insulin) are not prior to the surgery. [818] Patients on insulin pumps subjected to longer surgical procedures should be shifted to the IV insulin infusion. Patient on basal-bolus insulin regimen should calculate the total daily insulin dose [ Table 25 ]. [803] Intraoperative management Endocrine Society and Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia (SAMBA) recommend that intraoperative glucose levels be maintained less than 180 mg/dL. Glucose levels should be monitored hourly intraoperatively and immediately after surgery. [812, 819] For patients with T2DM undergoing major or minor surgery IV infusion of insulin, glucose and potassium is recommended to maintain the glycaemic targets [ Table  26 ].

Minimal data on thiazolidinediones or metiglinides and no data on incretin-based DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues are available. [833] Metformin and glyburide may be used during pregnancy but these drugs cross the placental barrier and hence should be replaced with insulin therapy at the earliest. [827, 831, 833] Potential concerns for SGLT2 inhibitors in pregnancy due to profound polyuria in a pregnant patient with familial renal glycosuria have been reported and since pregnancy causes polyuria and glycosuria normally due to increased glomerular filtration rate so SGLT2inhibitors are not be expected to be beneficial. [833] Insulin, does not cross the placenta, and hence is the first choice to attain targeted glycaemic goal in pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. [827, 830] Insulin requirements may increase as the pregnancy progresses, and the requirement peaks between 28 weeks and 32 weeks of gestation. [834] Considering alteration in physiology of pregnant women, daily SMBG is required more frequently and insulin dose must be optimized at different stages of pregnancy as per requirement. [830] Compared to T1DM, management of glucose level is easier in T2DM, however there might be requirement of higher dose of insulin as >150 units/ day i. e. approximately 50% elevation. [801] Insulin pump therapy is also considered to be beneficial in maintaining HbA1c level in pregnant women with pre-gestational diabetes, without any increase in risk of hypoglycaemia. However, cost and the risk for marked hyperglycaemia or DKA as a consequence of insulin delivery failure from could be an issue. [833] Pre-gestational diabetics are at a high risk of preeclampsia, hence the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) prophylaxis to be initiated between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation (ideally before 16 weeks of gestation) and continued until delivery to issues associated with unplanned pregnancy. Patients must be counselled and prescribed appropriate contraceptive measures that must be adapted until the metabolic parameters are appropriate to conceive. Since the primary goal for glycemic management in the preconception period and during the first trimester is to obtain the lowest HbA1c levels possible without hypoglycaemia, women should be made aware that they can have a planned conception only with HbA1c less than 6.5-7.0% to lower the risk of congenital anomalies. [827, 829] Crirtical complications with T2DM such as hypertension, intra uterine growth retardation and risk of obesity along with their preventions and management should be explained to the patients during pre-conception counselling. [827] Muslim pregnant women with pre-existing T2DM must be advised to avoid fasting during the month of Ramadan. However, religious fasting are personal decisions, and a practical approach should be explained with emphasis on the risks to the mother and the foetus.

Conversely in the NICE-SUGAR trial, intensive glucose control increased mortality among adults in the ICU: a blood glucose target of <180 mg/dL resulted in lower mortality than a target of 81 to 108 mg/dL [ Table 32 ].

It has been noted that there is an increase in insulin sensitivity over the duration of stay in ICU. During the first 24h to 48h the insulin requirement rapidly increases. At the onset of critical illness, patient being initially non-responsive to low intrinsic insulin sensitivity can lead to over administration of insulin. Thus, change in hormonal regulation increases risk of hypoglycaemia if TGC protocols are not taken into consideration.

Unless the hyperglycaemia is mild and expected to be transient, regular insulin sliding scales should not be used alone in hospitalized patients. The IV infusion of insulin is initiated when the blood glucose level is >180 mg/dL. Insulin analogs like insulin aspart and insulin lispro as IV have less variability in pharmacokinetic properties and it is also easier to predict their absorption and duration of action, hence are more preferable than normal neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH). Regular preprandial and postprandial insulins when replaced with theses rapid-acting insulin analogs can reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia.

[853] Hypoglycaemia in critical care Validated protocols to prevent and treat hypoglycaemia for inpatients should be adopted by each hospital. Blood glucose levels <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) should immediately be addressed in the nurse-initiated, standardised-hospitalwise protocols and also patient individual plans to prevent and treat hypoglycaemia.

Furthermore, participants from Tamil Nadu had the highest (31.7) and Jharkhand the lowest (16.3) knowledge score, and among self-reported patients with diabetes, Maharashtra had the highest (70.1) and Tamil Nadu, the lowest score (56.5) . [912] \u2022 Similarly another ICMR-INDIAB study including 14, 277 participants revealed that only 480 patients were with selfreported diabetes (254 urban and 226 rural) and the level of glycaemic control among patients with self-reported diabetes in India was poor. [36] \u2022 A population-based study from a south Indian state reported that among 6211 participants, good knowledge and positive attitude were observed in 3457 (55.6%) and 3280 (52.8%) people, respectively. Furthermore, literacy had a significant association with good knowledge, attitude, and practice in general and T2DM population. Overall, women had significantly better knowledge (p<0.001). [917] \u2022 A recent study from east Delhi, India reported that selflearning module (SLM) was significantly associated with increasing knowledge on aspects of effect of diabetes on foot (p<0.05), foot care and its steps (p<0.05) than control group in T2DM patients. [918] \u2022 Though general practitioners in India are aware and updated about symptoms and screening of T2DM, there is dearth of effective approaches towards screening and treatment of complications. Most patients are usually not advised on non-pharmacological measures and diabetes education, while interpretation of test results for screening of disease and its complications appear to be a major flaw in general practice. [51] \u2022 Evidence from several studies determining the level of knowledge and awareness on diabetes across India suggests that most of the patients had poor knowledge and awareness about their condition. [912, [919] [920] [921] [922] [923] [924] [925] Low socioeconomic status, old age, cultural factors, lack of access to healthcare, family history of diabetes, and importantly low literacy levels were the major predictors of poor glycaemic control among patients with T2DM. \u2022 A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey was conducted in 100 patients attending the diabetic unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital in central India. Majority of patients were found to be aware about hypoglycaemic symptoms and its treatment and development of complications.

[926] \u2022 A cross-sectional survey was carried out among participants aged \u226518 years, visiting tertiary care eye institute in north India to assess awareness of people about various aspects of diabetes. Of 530 participants interviewed, only 40 (25.6%) diabetic, and 45 (13.8%) non-diabetic participants were aware about diabetic retinopathy. Their knowledge about its risk factors, complications, prevention, and management was poor. [927] \u2022 In a study conducted on 400 diabetic patients (out-patient or admitted), awareness of diabetic nephropathy was marginally higher in patients staying in urban areas (vs rural areas, p=0.120) and among the literate (vs uneducated, p=0.567) patients. Awareness of diabetic nephropathy was higher in older patients (p=0.004) and in patients with chronic diabetes (p<0.0001), controlled diabetes (p=0.026), and diabetic nephropathy (p<0.0001). [928] Challenges in diabetes management in India [702, [929] [930] [931] \u2022 The awareness about the disease and its complications is less than satisfactory. \u2022 There is lack of knowledge, attitude, and practice studies to determine the gaps in knowledge among people living with diabetes and physicians in the areas of individual diabetes care in India. Physician-related issues including inadequate knowledge, delay in clinical response, poor control need to be addressed through diabetes education. \u2022 Lack of knowledge among people living with diabetes is a significant barrier to their ability to self-manage the disease. Hence, there is an imperative need for more structured diabetes education programs in India. \u2022 Lack of strong referral system to provide quality care i. e. early diagnosis, prevention and control of chronic complications in diabetes. Specialist referral for diabetes management is a major challenge in remote and rural primary care facilities, often lacking trained diabetes specialists. [932] \u2022 Indian studies have also shown that barriers to insulin therapy are due to lack of awareness, causing wrong perception, and false beliefs. People with ongoing insulin therapy had better understanding and acceptability towards insulin therapy than those not on insulin; besides intensification remains a challenge in these patients. [933] \u2022 Implementing efficacious health service intervention like patient education in a real-world resource-constrained setting is challenging and may not prove effective in improving patient outcomes. Therefore, interventions need to consider patients' and healthcare providers' experiences and perceptions and how macro-level policies translate into practice within local health systems. [934] \u2022 In India, counselling of young unmarried women with diabetes eroding familial support and marital prospects is particularly challenging due to disease-related stigma.

[955] In India, heterogeneity in linguistic, cultural, religious, socioeconomic, educational, regional, and familial factors affects the clinical progression, treatment and outcome of diabetes management. While family and community support medically-impaired persons as a part of our ethos, societal insensitivity often exhibits itself, as culinary cruelty in many ways for example: Indian patients with T2DM showed a significantly higher perception of burden of social and personal distress associated with the disease, and have been reported to have one of the lowest levels of psychological well-being based on the World Health Organization-5 (WHO-5) Wellbeing Index. [952, 956] These challenges and strengths warrant thedevelopment of India-specific recommendations for psychosocial management of diabetes, sensitive to and appropriate for, the Indian context.
