            "text": "INTRODUCTION: Maternal obesity may cause epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, that mediate differences in placental function and fetal development. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a novel DNA modification at CpG sites, generated from 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by ten-eleven translocase enzymes. While 5hmC may have unique functions, the balance between 5mC (gene repression) and 5hmC (gene expression) may regulate placental function. We hypothesize that differences in cellular localization, overall amount and individual gene methylation/ hydroxymethylation occur in placentas of obese vs normal BMI women. METHODS: Villous placenta genomic DNA from 10 obese (BMI 34.0\u00b12.9) and 10 normal BMI (23.4\u00b12.3) women with uncomplicated pregnancy was collected. Methylated and hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation-chip was performed on the NimbleGen 2.1M high-density DNA methylation array. Differentially methylated/ hydroxymethylated genes were identified between groups, differences confirmed by pyrosequencing and gene expression measured by qRT-PCR. Immunofluorescent staining for 5mC and 5hmC was performed on villous tissue of obese (n =16) and normal BMI (n=12) women and cellular localization and quantitation performed. RESULTS: Increased numbers of methylated (14,233 vs 12,319) and decreased numbers of hydroxymethylated regions (9,797 vs 11,789) were seen across the genome in obese vs healthy groups. Differences were widely distributed including genes involved in placental development, cellular invasion, vascular remodeling, increased BMI, lipid transport, energy and aerobic metabolism, chromatin modification, immune and/or inflammatory responses. The placental lactogen-growth hormone (CSH/ GH) and pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) gene clusters were differentially methylated/hydroxymethylated and mRNA expression decreased with obesity. Pyrosequencing of CMTM1 gene confirmed methylation array data. 5mC and 5hmC immunostaining localized to cyto-and syncytiotrophoblasts and vascular endothelium. Decreased staining for 5hmC was found with increasing maternal BMI (p=0.05) agreeing with DNA methylation array data. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of 5-hydroxymethylation in the human placenta and that differential methylation/hydroxymethylation occurs with increasing maternal BMI. As the balance of 5mC and 5hmC affects gene expression, this may be a mechanism whereby maternal obesity affects placental function.",

So far no treatment has been proved to be effective in preventing PTB in these pregnancies. Our aim was to evaluate whether Arabin cervical pessary prevents preterm delivery in twin pregnancies with short cervical length. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study on 91 women with twin pregnancy and cervical length \u2264 30 mm between 18 and 32 gestational weeks. 30 patients who received Arabin cervical pessary were compared with 61 patients who underwent expectant management at hospital admission. Primary outcomes were gestational age at delivery, PTB before 37, 34 and 28 weeks. Secondary outcomes were use of Atosiban and time interval between detection of short cervix and delivery. Normality of variables distribution was tested using Shapiro-Wilk test. Normally distributed continuous variables were compared using Student's t-test, while not normally distributed variables were compared using Mann-Whitney U Test. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-Square (c 2 ) test . RESULTS: Of 91 twin pregnancies 30 women received an Arabin cervical pessary and 61 received no treatment. The two groups had similar age and incidence of prior PTB. Gestational age at hospital admission was significantly lower in the pessary group (25 vs 28 weeks, p = 0.004). The group with pessary delivered at a higher gestational age compared with controls (35 vs 33 weeks, p = 0.008). The incidence of delivery < 28 weeks was significantly lower in the group with pessary (p = 0.04), while no difference was found in the rate of deliveries < 34 weeks. There was a trend towards a reduction rate of delivery before 37 weeks in the pessary group, even it did not reach the statistical significance (p = 0.09). The use of Atosiban and incidence of PROM and chorioamniotitis was not significantly different between groups . Time interval between detection of short cervix and delivery was longer in the pessary group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Arabin cervical pessary seems to increase the gestational age at delivery in twin pregnancies with short cervix and to reduce the incidence of delivery < 28 weeks, but not < 34 or 37 weeks. Smoking during the periconceptual and gestational periods is associated with adverse fetal and infant outcomes. While many studies hypothesize that such exposures dysregulate fetal developmental programming through epigenetic modifications such as DNAm, all have failed to link exposure\u2192DNAm\u2192offspring phenotype. We test this hypothesis using a novel genome-wide analytic approach in the largest DNAm database worldwide to better address the stochastic and interdependent nature of biological interactions. METHODS: DNAm microarray data from cord blood in a convenience sample of 584 healthy children from a population-based UK pregnancy cohort (ALSPAC) were used. We extracted DNAm signatures related to maternal smoking patterns from periconception to the 2 nd trimester (T2) of pregnancy with partial least squares regression. We predicted differences in fetal and infant growth using DNAm signatures while controlling for maternal and paternal social status. RESULTS: Distinct signatures in cord blood separate children by maternal smoking pattern. (Figure: DNAm components plot.

Findings were consistent between analyses with and without multiple imputation and bootstrapping. Interestingly, DNAm signatures related to periconceptual smoking alone captured a similar amount of variation in growth as that related to smoking overall or in T1 or T2. CONCLUSIONS: This novel approach predicts both pre-and postnatal growth. It is the first evidence linking maternal smoking-based DNAm signatures to child outcomes. Moreover, our findings regarding periconceptual smoking highlight the important biologic \"footprint\" left by exposures before gestation that affect offspring health. Our approach may provide insights into disease mechanisms that are unique from traditional experiments and analysis. After adjusting for metabolic syndrome, both composite outcomes were slightly attenuated (composite 1: HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.24 and composite 2: HR 1.08, 95% CI 1. 00-1.19 ). The risk was higher in the stratum of women having H-OC before age 40 for CAD (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51), CHF (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.18-2.34), and both composite outcomes (composite 1: HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.15-1.65 and composite 2: HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.07-1.48). CONCLUSIONS: H-OC is related to subsequent CV morbidity, similar to the effects of bilateral oophorectomy. The uterus, or its removal, may have local effects on the ovaries, especially when surgery is performed at a younger age. Alternatives to hysterectomy should be considered as first-line therapy.",

DNA methylation is a well-studied epigenetic modification whereby promoter methylation commonly represses gene expression and vice versa. We hypothesized that we would find differences in the DNA methylome of myometrium from women with idiopathic preterm labor vs normal term labor. METHODS: Lower segment myometrial tissue was obtained at cesarean section from women at term with established labor (TL, 38.9\u00b10.8 wks, mean\u00b1SD, n=11) and with idiopathic preterm labor (iPTL, 34.9\u00b11.3 wks, n=6). Genomic DNA was isolated from myometrium and then samples in each group were combined prior to analysis. Genome-scale DNA methylation analysis was performed using MeDIP (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation)-chip analysis on the NimbleGen 2.1M high-density platform. We identified those genes with the most significant change in methylation in regions -1.5 to +0.5kb of the transcription start site. RESULTS: MeDIP-chip identified 28,952 and 29,610 methylated regions in TL and iPTL groups respectively. Differences between in the methylomes were identified at CpG islands, shores, shelves and gene bodies across the genome. Functional clustering analysis indicated the significantly enriched pathways of hypomethylated genes (permissive) in iPTL vs TL were related to acute inflammatory and acute-phase responses (p<0.001). By contrast, genes that are hypermethylated (repressive) in iPTL vs TL revealed enrichment for contractile fibers and cell junctions (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We present the first high-resolution DNA methylome of human myometrium and provide evidence for differences in the methylome that may relate to idiopathic preterm birth via regulation of gene expression. The findings extend previous observations that idiopathic preterm labor is associated with subclinical intrauterine infection and inflammatory pathways and point to targets for further molecular characterization of preterm delivery.",

INTRODUCTION : Pregnancy complications associated with advance maternal age (\u226535 years) include increased operative delivery and post-term induction. The underlying physiological causes are not well understood. We hypothesise that advanced maternal age negatively impacts on myometrium contractile function and timing of birth. Previously, we reported in a pregnant mouse model of advanced reproductive age, that gestation length, labour duration and spontaneous contractile function in myometrium ex vivo was impaired in older mice. The aims of this study were to determine whether older pregnant mouse myometrium had i) reduced expression of mRNA encoding for contraction associated proteins, ii) impaired contractile responses to oxytocin ex vivo and iii) reduced myometrium mitochondrial copy number (MtDNA). METHODS: Myometrium tissue was obtained from non-pregnant and nulliparous pregnant mice (day 18) aged 3, 5 and 8 months of age. Strips of myometrium were mounted in an organ bath containing physiological salt solution for isometric tension recording. Oxytocin (10 -12 to 10 -7 M) was added to spontaneously contracting tissue and mean integral tension (mean \u00b1 SEM) determined. Myometrium mRNA expression of CX43, OXTR and PTGS2, and MtDNA copy number was determined using qPCR (expressed relative to a normalisation factor; MtDNA to B2M). RESULTS: Oxytocin-stimulated contractile activity was impaired in myometrium from older pregnant mice (mean difference in slope of concentration response curve, 95% CI) at 8 months (-7.63, -13.92 to -1.35, P< 0.05) and 5 months (-7.29, -12.31 to -2.28, p<0 .01) vs 3 months (n=32 tissues from n=8 mice/group). This age related impairment was not observed in myometrium from non-pregnant mice. CX43 expression was significantly lower in myometrium from pregnant 8 month old mice vs 3 month old mice (mean \u00b1 SEM; 4.18 \u00b1 0.03 vs 4.40 \u00b1 0.03, p<0.01, n=8 per group). OXTR and PTGS2 mRNA expression were unaffected by age. MtDNA expression declined with age; in pregnant mice there was a 25% and 41% reduction in copy number in tissue from 5 month (n=p<0.01) and 8 month p<0.001) vs 3 month old animals (n=8).",

COX1 and COX2 inhibition reduced the potentiating effects of ODN 2395 (pD 2 , ODN 2395: 7.22 \u00b1 0.107 vs. ODN 2395+SC560: 6.36 \u00b1 0.24 vs. ODN 2395+NS398: 6.62 \u00b1 0.225, p<0.05) and abolished the differences between ODN 2395-and vehicle-treated rats. NOS inhibition did not have any effect on the group differences seen in U46619-induced contractions.

CONCLUSIONS: Systemic activation of TLR9 potentiates the contractile responses to TxA 2 in uterine arteries from pregnant rats and this effect is mediated by cyclooxygenases. We speculate that in the presence of TLR9 ligands such as in cases of infections (PAMPs) or exaggerated placental cell damage (DAMPs), COX inhibition may prevent or alleviate the development of dysfunction of arteries supplying the uteroplacental unit. may explain this finding: 1. Abnormality in ovarian function leads to bleeding abnormalities which in turn increases the risk of hysterectomy; 2. Hysterectomy, by an yet to be illucidated mechanism, causes damage to the ovary and earlier failure. We utilized frozen sera from participants in the Prospective Research on Ovarian Function (PROOF) cohort to compare the changes in Anti-M\u00fcllerian Hormone (AMH) levels (a novel marker of ovarian reserve) between women undergoing ovary sparing hysterectomy and similar age controls. METHODS: Sera samples from women who had a baseline and 1 year follow up blood sample, had proven fertility, were non-smokers and were not on hormonal contraception were selected for analysis. Continuous variables were compared using t-test and categorical variable were analyzed using chi square test. Baseline AMH levels were grouped as not-detectable, \"aging\" (AMH \u22641.2 ng/ml) and \"young.\" Among the patients with detectable baseline AMH, who had no interval gynecological surgeries or pregnancies, who were not taking oral contraception or hormone replacement, follow-up AMH levels were compared between hysterectomy and control groups using ANCOVA after adjusting for baseline AMH, race, and age. RESULTS: A total of 80 women who had a hysterectomy and 83 controls met inclusion criteria. A greater proportion of control women were Caucasian, however, there was no difference between groups in mean age or parity. Although there was no difference in median AMH levels at baseline (1 vs. 0.7 ng/ml), there were a greater proportion of women with \"young\" ovary profile in the hysterectomy group (43.8 vs 28.9%; p=0.049), suggesting that women presenting form hysterectomy do not have dimished ovarian reserve. At 1 year follow up AMH levels were on average 45% lower in the hysterectomy compared to control group (95% CI, 22 to 62%, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite ovarian preservation, women undergoing hysterectomy experience a greater decline in AMH levels compared to controls. This suggests that the association between hysterectomy and decreased ovarian reserve is due to direct impact of hysterectomy on ovarian function (hypothesis 2). hampered isolation of a pure population of stem cells required for proper characterization of a gene expression profile. Here we present a new method to analyze gene expression profiles of stem cells retrospectively without the requirement to isolate stem cells. In order to trace a stem cell expression profile we will use a fusion between the bacterial DNA cytosine methyltransferase (DCM) and different components of the RNA Polymerase II machinery. METHODS: Mouse embryonic stem cell lines have been generated with doxycycline inducible fusion proteins, which methylate the CCWGG sequence in active genes. Pulse labeling active genes with a stable epigenetic mark that is propagated to daughter cells will allow retrospective analysis of gene expression. DCM methylation of transcribed, or previously transcribed, genes is detected by digestion with the methylation dependent restriction enzyme LpnP1 using quantitative PCR and Southern blotting. RESULTS: DCM methylation of transcribed, or previously transcribed, genes is detected by digestion with the methylation dependent restriction enzyme LpnP1 using quantitative PCR and Southern blotting. We found that DCM methylation is propagated to daughter cells in vitro and in vivo and is still detectable more than eight weeks after induction of the fusion protein.",

Peter Sipos*, 1 Stephane Bourque*, 2 Phil Baker, 3 Sandra Davidge, 2 Ian Crocker. 1 1 Maternal and Fetal HEalth Research Centre, University of Manchester, United Kingdom; 2 Women and Children's Health Research Institute, University of Alberta, Canada; 3 Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, New Zealand. INTRODUCTION: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with placental hypoxia. We have previously demonstrated the role of fetal ECFCs in vasculogenesis of the human/murine placenta 1 and uterus and showed these cells, derived from growth restricted neonates, to have impaired functional capacities 2 . These impairments may impact placental development resulting in IUGR and, if sustained in adult-life, could be a determinant for cardiovascular risk (CVR). We therefore hypothesised that transient exposure to hypoxia, as proposed in IUGR, permanently affects ECFC-function. METHODS: We isolated and verified ECFCs by cell culture from human umbilical blood from normal pregnancies (n=6) and examined their vasculogenic capabilities in artificial tissue blocks implanted for 14 days in normoxic immune-deficient NOD/SCID mice. Matched blocks contained ECFCs with and without prior exposure to 1%O 2 for 72hrs. Cells were also examined for senescence using fluorescent \u00df-galactosidase assay and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity by zymography, as a fundamental angiogenic enzyme. RESULTS: In 6 random fields of 3 systematically selected sections, the numbers and average diameters (pixels) of simple (single ECFC) and more complex (multiple ECFC) vascular structures were determined in the implants. In both cases, hypoxia reduced ECFC vasculogenic potential, as compared to normoxic controls (simple structures: 271 [132-526] vs. 43 and 2289 vs. 595 , respectively, p<0.05 n=5, Wilcoxon's matched pairs test) (complex structures: 450 [370-688] vs. 84 , 346 vs. 94 , respectively, p<0.05 n=5). Levels of senescence (as a ratio) were exaggerated under hypoxic exposure (1.0 vs. 4.3 [1.4-10.1], p<0.05), whilst MMP-2 production was elevated compared to normoxic controls (4.1 [2.7-7.1] vs. 1.0, respectively, p<0.05).",

We hypothesized that hAECs exerted their effects via modualtion of the host response to injury, specifically by polarizing macrophages from pro inflammatory (M1) to proreparative (M2) phenotypes, and by inducing naive T cells into regulatory T cells (Tregs) .",

One day later we administered 4 million hAECs (or saline) intraperitoneally. Animals were culled 3, 5, 7 or 14 days later (n=5 each group), lungs collected and FACS sorted (CD86+ for M1, CD206+ for M2) to assess cell phenotype. To determine direct effects, we co-cultured hAECs with either macrophages or naive T cells from FoxP3-GFP mice. RESULTS: Bleomycin significantly increased macrophage infiltration in the lung at day 7, an effect prevented by hAECs (4.1\u00b10.4% vs 0.5\u00b10.1%, P<0.005). Administration of hAECs also shifted macrophage phenotype from predominantly M1 to predominantly M2. Direct co-culture of macrophages with hAECs in vitro also shifted cell population from M1 to M2 and significantly increased phagoctyic activity. Administration of hAECs also doubled the Treg population in the lung following bleomycin injury (p<0.01). In vitro, hAECs induced FoxP3 expression in naive T cells. CONCLUSIONS: The protective and reparative properties of hAECs are, at least in part, due to their ability to modulate host macrophage and T cell function to promote resolution of inflammation and fibrosis. Understanding how hAECs exert these effects may lead to novel therapeutics.",

FGF2 was removed from the culture medium to promote differentiation and the cells were immunostained for trophoblast markers and assayed for the production of placental hormones by ELISA. RESULTS: Human ESCs showed epithelial morphology after 24 hours in the presence of BMP4 plus inhibitors. After 5 passages in the presence of only FGF, cell colonies emerge with a slightly changed morphology and the capacity for self-renewal. With a doubling time of approximately 24 hours, the cells have now survived more than 40 passages (190 doublings) . The majority of cells show highly elevated CDX2 expression while maintaining expression of the pluripotency markers (POU5F1, NANOG, MKI67). With removal of FGF2 from the culture medium, the cells become positive for the trophoblast markers CGA, CGB, GATA2, and KRT7 and secrete hCG and PGF. CONCLUSIONS: Limited exposure of hESC to medium containing BMP4 plus inhibitors followed by MEF feeder cell-conditioned hESC culture conditions in the presence of FGF2 allows derivation of distinct self-renewing progenitor cells that can differentiate into trophoblast upon removal of FGF2 from the medium.",

Mammalian heart does not regenerate, yet embryonic cardiac ECs(CECs) may offer a regenerative impetus after myocardial infarction(MI). Methods for identifying CECs arising from hESCs are undefined and molecular pathways driving progenitors to CECs are unknown. METHODS: We modified a cardiac specific hESC reporter line via lentiviral transduction, creating a dual reporter line in which the Nkx2.5 promoter (cardiac) and the VE-Cadherin promoter (EC) drive GFP and mOrange, respectively. We defined culture conditions that enrich for double-positive cells (putative CECs), isolated this population via FACS, and analyzed its molecular phenotype via RNA sequencing. We confirmed biologic relevance of this population via lineage tracing in progeny of Nkx2.5-Cre, floxed-stop TdTomato, and VEGFR2 GFP crosses in mice.",

In-vitro correlates on day 9 of hESC differentiation exhibited both reporters. RNA sequencing revealed that this population expressed cardiac and EC-specific genes; WNT signaling was increased in cardiomyocytes and decreased in CECs. Principal component analysis identified a signature similar to CECs from human fetal heart. Subsequent inhibition of WNT during hESC differentiation increased the yield of CECs (+42.9%\u00b19.8%) at the expense of cardiomyocytes (-32.8%\u00b16.8%, p=.027) . Pilot studies revealed that mouse embryonic ECs engrafted and formed functional vessels after MI. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac ECs can be derived from hESCs. Persistent WNT inhibition in progenitors drives CEC identity, and enriches for a population that may have unique regenerative potential. It has been postulated that endometriosis results from abnormal, ectopic dislocation of basal endometrium. We have recently shown for the first time that nuclear SOX9 and cell-surface SSEA-1 marks human basalis endometrial epithelial cells. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry analysis of SOX9 and SSEA1 in 30 secretory phase endometrial samples and 15 ectopic endometriotic lesions from women with and without endometriosis; 10 women on exogenous hormones using a modified Quickscore and ImageJ. Western blotting and qPCR (SOX9, and surrogate markers for SSEA1, FUT4, FUT9) were used as secondary methods. Gene expression of epithelial cells enriched for SOX9 expression (Magnetic bead sorted SSEA1+) from women with/ without endometriosis (n=8/group) were analysed by qPCR. The effects of ovarian hormones on SOX9 gene and protein expression were analysed in vitro using Ishikawa cells. RESULTS: There was an increase of SOX9 and SSEA1 expression in secretory epithelial cells of the women with endometriosis compared with healthy controls (1.33 vs. 0.44, p=0.01). Ectopic endometriotic deposits had high scores for SOX9 and SSEA-1. SOX9 protein levels were lower in the secretory than in proliferative phase. The thin, basalis like hormone treated endometrium contained high SOX9 expressing epithelial cells compared to the secretory phase not exposed to exogenous hormones (p=0.0001). SOX9 enriched epithelial cells from women with endometriosis showed reduced PR and ERa mRNA expression and increased expression of OCT4 and NANOG. DHT, MPA and FGFs altered the SOX9 gene and protein expression levels in Ishikawa cells compared to the control; E2 did not alter SOX9 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Women with endometriosis are more likely to shed an increased number of cells with basalis-like phenotype at menstruation, some of which may travel retrogradely into the pelvis. Since these cells can generate endometrial gland-like structures in 3D culture, and have the gene expression profile of a less differentiated phenotype, they are likely to give rise to ectopic endometrium-like lesions in the pelvic cavity. Progesterone and Androgens effect on SOX9 may partially explain their therapeutic effect in endometriosis. As in other organs SOX9 may be a regulator of progenitor cell proliferation and as such involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.",

INTRODUCTION: Endometriosis is a gynecologic disease characterized by the presence of endometrial lesions outside the uterus. Aberrant protein kinase A (PKA) signaling is one of several proposed reasons for the inability of endometrial stromal fibroblasts (eSF) from women with endometriosis (eSF endo ) to decidualize, contributing to the high incidence of infertility seen in women with the disease. Abnormalities in protein kinase B (PKB/AKT), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling have also been observed in endometriosis. Inhibition of any one of the above pathways, while affecting specific cell processes, has not proven to be successful in restoring decidualization in eSF endo . Our objective was to restore decidualization marker expression in eSF endo during cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -induced decidualization in vitro by using chemical inhibitors to cell signaling pathways known to be aberrantly regulated in endometriosis. METHODS: eSF from women with severe endometriosis (eSF endo ) or no disease (eSF non-endo ) (n=5 each) were treated for 96h with 0.5 mM 8-bromoadenosine 3'5'-monophosphate (8-br-cAMP), and chemical inhibitors to EGFR tyrosine kinase (gefitinib, 10 \u00b5M), MAPK kinase (MEK; UO126, 10 \u00b5M) or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; rapamycin, 10 nM). RNA and protein were isolated for qPCR and multiplex assay analyses. RESULTS: Addition of gefitinib during cAMP treatment restored mRNA expression of the decidualization markers insulin growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1), prolactin (PRL), and forkhead box protein 01A (FOXO1A) in eSF endo to levels seen in similarly-treated eSF non-endo . Increased P70S6K phosphorylation (downstream of mTOR) was observed in eSF non-endo treated with cAMP, but not in cAMP-treated eSF endo as measured by multiplex analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant EGF signaling is involved in preventing expression of decidualization markers in eSF from women with endometriosis. Elucidating the underlying differences in cell signaling pathways between diseased and non-diseased endometrium will lead to better infertility management in women with endometriosis.

INTRODUCTION: Increased pelvic contamination with menstrual blood by retrograde menstruation is believed to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. A high concentration of heme and iron derived from lysis of red blood cells by macrophages in the peritoneal fluid may be regarded as a prerequisite for endometrial cell implantation and survival. Iron-derived products may favour disruption of mesothelial cells, exposure of submesothelial collagen matrix and angiogenesis. Thus, iron homeostasis is acquiring increasing interest in endometriosis pathogenesis and associated infertility. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of pelvic iron overload on the development of peritoneal endometriosis in a mouse model. METHODS: Hemin (25mg/kg), was injected i.p. at the time of endometriosis induction in Balb/c female mice, and treatment was repeated twice a week for 2 wks. The mice were sacrificed on day 15 and lesion number and size were evaluated. Gene expression analysis of IL-6, IL-1a, TNFa, VEGF, survivin, E-cadherin, MMP3, MMP9 were evaluated in eutopic and ectopic endometrium by qRT-PCR. IL-6 levels in the peritoneal fluid were evaluated by specific ELISA. RESULTS: Treatment with hemin did not affect the total number of lesions per mouse (2.4 lesions/mouse in control mice vs 2.6 lesions/ mouse in hemin-treated mice). However hemin significantly increased the volume of endometriotic lesions (0.047 \u00b1 0.01 cm 3 ) compared to vehicletreated mice (0.013 \u00b1 0.003 cm 3 ) (p=0.047). Expression of MMP3 and VEGF transcripts in ectopic endometrium of hemin-treated mice were increased compared with vehicle treated mice (p=0.038 and p=0.048, respectively). No differences were observed for inflammatory cytokines in hemin-treated vs control mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that an excess of iron in the peritoneum of mice with endometriosis induce upregulation of MMP3 mRNA expression hence facilitating extracellular matrix breakdown and implantation of endometrial stromal cells onto the mesothelium. Subsequent lesion vascularization is also favoured by iron, as indicated by upregulation of VEGF transcripts. This mouse model might help to identify novel iron-dependent molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.",

Random effects models and heterogeneity statistics (I 2 ) were used to investigate the evidence of the nine reported genome-wide significant loci, across datasets and populations. RESULTS: Meta-analysis showed that 7/9 loci had consistent directions of effect across studies and populations, and 6/9 remained genomewide significant (P< 5x10 -8 ) including rs12700667 on chromosome 7 (P=1.6x10 -9 ), rs7521902 in WNT4 (P=1.8x10 -15 ), rs10859871 in VEZT (P=4.7x10 -15 ), rs1537377 in CDKN2BAS1 (P=1.5x10 -8 ), rs7739264 near ID4 (P=6.2x10 -10 ) and rs13394619 in GREB1 (P=4.5x10 -8 ). Two independent intergenic loci, rs4141819 and rs6734792 on chromosome 2, showed significant evidence of heterogeneity across datasets (P<0.005). All 9 loci had stronger effect sizes among stage B cases, implying that they are likely to be implicated in the development of moderate/severe, or ovarian disease. While 2/9 loci are intergenic, the remainder are in or near genes with known functions of biological relevance to endometriosis, varying from roles in developmental pathways to cellular growth/ carcinogenesis, which will be discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite reported lack of formal replication, our metaanalysis show remarkable consistency in endometriosis GWAS results across studies, with little evidence of population-based heterogeneity. However, phenotypic definitions used have been crude. Stronger associations with stage B disease observed for most loci emphasize the importance for future studies to include detailed sub-phenotype information. In the present study, we evaluate the suitability of miR-142-3p, known to be dysregulated in endometriotic lesions, as a noninvasive serum biomarker for endometriosis. Furthermore, the functional role of miR-142-3p in this disease is evaluated in vitro using immortalized cell lines and patient-derived primary endometrial stroma cells. METHODS: miR-142-3p expression in the sera of patients with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis (n=41) and control sera of patients without endometriosis (n=44) from the IVF clinic of M\u00fcnster University Hospital were analyzed by qPCR. The immortalized cell lines 12Z (epithelial endometriotic), ST-T1b (endometrial stroma) and primary eutopic endometrial and ectopic stroma cells were transiently transfected using miR-142-3p precursors or appropriate control reagents, respectively. Cell behaviour and morphology were evaluated by MTT assay, video microscopy and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Target gene expression and signal transduction analysis were performed by qPCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: miR-142-3p expression was decreased by 80% (p=0.0116) in sera of endometriosis patients compared to controls. miR-142-3p upregulation resulted in a downregulation of the predicted targets IL6ST, ITGAV, RAC1, WASL and ROCK2. In ST-T1b cells, IL-6 mediated STAT3 signaling and cell viability were significantly inhibited (p<0.05), whereas 12Z cell motility was significantly affected (p<0.05) due to changes in cytoskeletal structure. CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of miR-142-3p promotes the pathogenesis of endometriosis via upregulated expression of proinflammatory signaling receptors and cytoskeletal elements, which in turn may facilitate establishment of the endometriotic lesion at ectopic sites. miR-142-3p emerges as a noninvasive diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in endometriosis.",

            "text": "Life by Altering Adaptive Responses to Later Challenges? Y Niu, 1 BJ Allison, 1 KL Brain, 1 A D Kane, 1 EA Herrera, 2 DA Giussani. 1 1 Physiology Development & Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom; 2 Physiology, Universidad de Chile, Chile. INTRODUCTION: Different stressors during early life can programme heart disease. It is widely understood that they do so by altering adaptive responses to later challenges, such as an unhealthy lifestyle, rather than by initiating pathological changes per se during fetal development. Whether suboptimal environments trigger a fetal origin of cardiac dysfunction has been difficult to prove in mammals, largely due to the complexity of studying the fetal heart in rodents. We have created isobaric chambers able to maintain pregnant sheep under hypoxic conditions for the duration of pregnancy. We have used this model to investigate the effects of chronic fetal hypoxia on cardiac function in the offspring both during the fetal and adult periods. METHODS: 32 ewes carrying a singleton fetus were instrumented with vascular catheters at 100 days of gestation (term~145 days). Half of the pregnancies were exposed to chronic hypoxia from 105 days to term. In one cohort, hearts of fetuses were isolated at 138 days and studied. In a second cohort, hearts of adults were isolated at 9 months and studied. In both fetuses and adults, cardiac function was investigated using Langendorff preparations. RESULTS: Chronic hypoxia reduced maternal PaO 2 (107\u00b12 vs. 47\u00b11 mmHg, P<0.05). Chronic hypoxic pregnancy impaired diastolic function (LVEDP) and the cardiac recovery to a 20 min ischaemic reperfusion challenge in hearts of fetuses at the end of gestation (Fig. 1) . By adulthood, both effects persisted, but the cardiac dysfunction amplified to reveal additional impaired systolic function (LVDP). CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence of a fetal origin of cardiac disease that amplifies into adulthood in a mammal. The data advance the thinking of this field to understand the concept that programmed cardiac dysfunction by adverse conditions in early life may originate in fetal life rather than be of adult-onset, resulting from altered adaptive responses to postnatal challenges.

Eridan Rocha-Ferreira, 1 Erika Francesch-Domenech, 1 Laura Thei, 1 Ahad Rahim, 2 Sigrun Lange, 1 Donald Peebles, 1 Mariya Hristova, 1 Gennadij Raivich. 1 1 Perinatal Brain Group, UCL Institute for Women's Health, United Kingdom; 2 Dept of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION: Materno-fetal infection and hypoxic-ischemic insult around the time of birth are known to interact synergistically to cause neonatal encephalopathy. We have previously shown that deletion of the TNF cluster of cytokines abolishes LPS sensitization in the immature murine brain. In this study, we investigated the independent effects of TNFa, LTa and LTb, members of the TNF cluster, using mouse models of global single gene deletion, as well as cell-type specific deletion of TNF\u03b1 in peripheral macrophages with Mlys::Cre. METHODS: At P7, littermate wild-type (n=20) and knock-out (n=20) mice underwent HI insult consisting of unilateral carotid occlusion followed by 30min 8% O 2 exposure. 12h prior, 0.6\u00b5g/g LPS (n=10) or saline (control, n=10) was administered intraperitoneally. Animals were sacrificed 48h post-HI. Forebrain sections were immunohistochemically stained for \u03b1M (activated microglia) and Nissl (cell survival) injuryassociated markers. Assessments were based on combined injury score (\u03b1M+Nissl, CIS) and infarct volume (Nissl), and statistically measured using one way ANOVA followed by post-hoc TUKEY. RESULTS: LPS pre-treatment resulted in significant up-regulation in injury in the WT littermates of all 4 groups. LT\u03b1-/-mice had significantly decreased CIS in the pyriform cortex and hippocampus (45%, p<0.05), as well as significantly reduced infarct in the dorsoparietal cortex (40%, p<0.05) when compared to their WT LPS controls. LT\u03b2-/-animals had significantly more CIS in the pyriform cortex, striatum, thalamus and overall (50%, p<0.05). There was also a significant overall increase in tissue loss relating to WT LPS controls, particularly in dorsoparietal cortex, striatum, thalamus and external capsule (50%, p<0.05). TNFa deletion appeared to be detrimental, with increase in CIS and infarct The risk for any pregnancy to have a live born infant with chromosomal abnormalities or structural defects has been estimated to be 3%-5%. Current methods of invasive and non-invasive genetic diagnosis are limited to gestational ages of 10 weeks or later. The need to develop earlier and minimally invasive methods for prenatal genetic diagnosis (PGD) are warranted. At 5 weeks gestation, trophoblastic cells can be non-invasively retrieved from the endocervical canal using a cytobrush. We are now able to isolate trophoblast cells from maternal cells using the fetal specific marker human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G. Prior to using these fetal cells for PGD, it is necessary to ensure distinction between trophoblast DNA and maternal DNA. METHODS: Following isolation of trophoblast cells from pregnant patients in the first and second trimester, specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for HLA-G expression. Trophoblast cells were separated from maternal cells using a column-free magnetic nanoparticle separation procedure. Purity of the trophoblast specimens was calculated by staining for BHCG. Following whole genome amplification (WGA) of maternal and fetal cell DNA, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay and gender identification was preformed by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Maternal and fetal cells were compared after isolation from 5 patient specimens. Average total trophoblast recovery was 700 cells, average purity was above 90%. A minimum of 10 mg of DNA was obtained after WGA using either single cells or groups of 5-100 cells. SNP assays demonstrated allelic differences between maternal and trophoblast cells in all specimens. Gender was identified and confirmed from patient records. CONCLUSIONS: Trophoblast cells can be retrieved and isolated from the endocervical canal with acceptable purity based on their high degree of BHCG expression. Furthermore, fetal DNA was distinct from maternal DNA, indicating its utility as a platform for non-invasive prenatal testing of the intact fetal genome.",

            "text": "Ductus Venosus Morphology Is Not Related to Increased Nuchal Translucency, Cardiac Defects or Aberrant Lymphatic Development. Nicole B Burger, 1 Monique C Haak, 2 Christianne J De Groot, 1 James F Martin, 3 Weinian Shou, 4 Peter J Scambler, 5 Vincent M Christoffels, 6 Mireille N Bekker. 7 1 Obstetrics and Gynecology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands; 2 Obstetrics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands; 3 Anatomy, Embryology & Physiology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands; 7 Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Medical Center St Radboud, Nijmegen, Netherlands. INTRODUCTION: Ductus venosus (DV) flow velocities are considered to reflect cardiac function and are used for evaluation of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency (NT), cardiac defects and growthrestriction. Increased NT is associated with changed DV flow velocities and was believed to origin from cardiac failure. However, several studies have shown that aberrant lymphatic development causes increased NT. Thus, we hypothesize that altered DV flow velocities are caused by local DV changes and not by cardiac performance. The objective of this study is to examine if local changes in DV morphology and a DV sphincter are related to increased NT, cardiac defects and aberrant lymphatic development. METHODS: Mouse embryos with cardiac defects and nuchal edema (Fkbp12 -/-, Tbx1 -/-, Mesp1Cre Chd7 -/-), cardiac defects without nuchal edema (Pitx2 -/-) and disturbed lymphatic development and nuchal edema (Ccbe1 +/-, Ccbe1 -/-) were examined. Embryos were analyzed from embryonic day (E)11.5-15.5 using markers for endothelium, smooth muscle actin, nerve tissue and elastic fibers. RESULTS: The DV lumen was wide in E11.5-12.5 and developed to a narrowed lumen in E13.5-15.5 wild type and mutant embryos. Wild type and mutant embryos showed similar positive endothelial and smooth muscle actin expression from E11.5-15.5 in the DV. In all examined embryos nerve marker and elastic fiber expression were not identified in the DV. Local morphology and staining expression in the DV were similar in all investigated embryos. CONCLUSIONS: DV morphology is not related to increased NT, cardiac defects or aberrant lymphatic development. Thus, DV flow velocities reflect intracardiac pressure and are not influenced by local changes. (SMCs) induces the release of multiple chemotactic cytokines, with CXCL1 and CXCL8 being the most highly expressed. These locally generated chemotactic gradients regulate leukocyte (monocytes and neutrophils) migration and infiltration into the human myometrium, where they induce an inflammatory state that contributes to preterm and term labor. We hypothesize that antagonism of chemokine receptor signaling will reduced the migratory ability of peripheral leukocytes. METHODS: Cultured myometrial SMCs (hTERT-HM) were subjected to static mechanical stretch for 24 hours (h) using the Flexcell-5 strain unit; stretch-conditioned media (SCM) and non-stretched media (NSM) were collected.Human uterine myometrial microvascular endothelial cells (UtMVEC-Myo) were plated inside 3-mm cell culture inserts. Human primary neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood of pregnant women. Transendothelial migration (TEM) of neutrophils was performed with UtMVEC-Myo cell-coated inserts stimulated with SCM or NSM for 3h. Primary neutrophils were treated with blocking antibodies against chemokine receptor CXCR1 and CXCR2. In addition, SCM was incubated with broad-spectrum chemokine inhibitor (BSCI) for 1h prior to TEM assay. Human THP-1 monocytic cell line was purchased from ATCC. Chemotaxis assay for THP-1 cells was performed with or without BSCI. RESULTS: 1) In TEM assay SCM significantly increased transmigration of primary neutrophils as compared to NSM. 2) Incubation of peripheral neutrophils with anti-CXCR1 and anti-CXCR2 neutralizing antibodies decreased TEM in response to SCM by 61.1% and 62.3% respectively; simultaneous application of both antibodies decreased TEM by 80.6%. 3) Pretreating SCM with BSCI reduced neutrophil TEM by 70.4%. 4) SCM significantly increased chemotaxis of monocytic THP-1 cells compared to NSM. 5) Migration of TCP-1 cells towards SCM was down-regulated by pre-treatment of SCM with BSCI to a level similar to NSM. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that antagonism of individual or multiple chemokine receptors on leukocytes inhibits their transmigration potential. We suggest that pharmaceutical agents targeting chemokineinduced leukocyte infiltration into the myometrium could be an attractive approach to delay preterm labour by preventing uterine activation.",

INTRODUCTION: Although extensively studied in male reproduction system, the androgen receptor (AR) function in female remains unclear. Female AR knockout mice present a sub-infertile phenotype, indicating that AR is required for normal pregnancy and labour. We have demonstrated that high AR expression during the first trimester of pregnancy is necessary for myometrial cell proliferation. Here, we investigated the role of AR in apoptosis of myometrial cells. METHODS: Human myometrial cells were infected with lentivirus to either overexpress AR or knock down endogenous AR expression. Myometrial cells were also treated with vehicle, 1nM R1881 (AR agonist) or 10nM Enzalutamide (AR antagonist). Cells were then exposed to camptothecin, UV light or anti-Fas antibody to trigger either endogenous or exogenous apoptosis pathway. Cell apoptosis was detected by immunoblotting cleaved Caspase-3 or PARP proteins as well as by FACS assays measuring the subG0 cell population. Gene microarray analyses identified signaling pathways that regulate myometrial cell proliferation and apoptosis, and followed by validation assays by real-time PCR and immunoblot. RESULTS: Enhanced AR expression or AR agonist enhanced 3-10 fold resistance of myometrial cells to both endogenous and exogenous apoptosis stimuli. In contrast, AR knockdown or AR antagonist increased 2-8 fold sensitivity of myometrial cells to apoptotic stimuli. Gene microarray assay identified 1558 AR regulated genes, among which 96 genes are associated with cell proliferation and 99 genes related to cell apoptosis. We identified AR regulated PI3K/Akt signaling is critical to determine apoptosis outcome of myometrial cells.",

Total RNA and proteins were extracted. mRNA levels of IL-1b associated genes, such as COX-2, IL-1b, IL-8, IL-24, CCL8, MKP-1, IRAK3 and 11bHSD1 were measured with qPCR. COX-2, c-jun, c-fos and p65 proteins were measured by western blotting, and IL-8 proteins by ELISA assay.The results are presented as ratios of GAPDH as mean\u00b1SEM. Graphpad 5.0 was used for statistical analysis; statistical significance is defined as p<0.05 (n=8). RESULTS: The combination of forskolin and P4 has significantly reduced IL-1b-driven COX-2 mRNA expression at 6 and 24 hours. Similar trends were observed in IL-1b, IL-24, IL-8, IRAK-3, and CCL-8 expression at all 3 time points. The combination of forskolin and P4, compared to P4 alone, has significantly increased IL-1b-driven MKP-1 mRNA expression at all time points. At the protein level, the combination of cAMP and P4 significantly reduced IL-1b induced increase in COX-2, c-jun, c-fos, and IL-8 to greater extent when compared to P4 alone. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study showed that the combination of cAMP and P4 would be more effective than P4 alone in the suppression of inflammation-induced PTL. Further studies need to be performed to investigate the mechanisms through which cAMP enhance P4 action.",

Obstetrics and Gynecology, Washington UNiversity School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA. INTRODUCTION: Preterm birth (PTB) is a one of the most significant global health problems. Intrauterine infections are prominently associated with PTB, yet the infectious organisms and the mechanisms by which such infections might trigger PTB are poorly understood.Antibiotic treatment is relatively ineffective for preventing PTB suggesting that the putative infectious organisms may be 'hidden' within the tissue. Our central hypothesis is that cells of the maternal basal plate, the peripheral region of the placenta on the maternal side harbor microbes which may be associated with PTB. METHODS: To test our hypothesis, we previously accrued the target cohort of n=300 samples of basal plate tissues from PTB and term placentas, and scored tissue sections for presence of intracellular bacteria. We next elucidated the location of these microbes in basal plate biopsies using histologic and immunohistochemical analysis. To determine the preferred niche for intracellular bacteria, basal plate biopsies were cultured ex vivo, infected with either gram negative (E. coli) or positive (L.monocytogenes) bacteria, and examined by histological staining, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy. Next, we determined whether modulation of HLA-G levels could be one mechanism associated with PTB by quantifying tissue HLA-G expression levels in term versus preterm placentas using qPCR and immunohistochemical assays. RESULTS: We recently published our novel findings that intracellular bacteria are present in a third of the total cohort with over 50% incidence in placentas <28 weeks (Stout et al., AJOG, 2013) . We have now found that all intracellular bacteria are exclusively localized to fetal extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs). EVTs express in a cell-intrinsic manner the multiple histocompatibility antigen, HLA-G, which mediates fetal tolerance. We found that HLA-G+ EVTs were preferred niches for both E. coli and L.monocytogenes in basal plate explants where they can replicate and form aggregates. Finally, we show that increased levels of HLA-G expression is associated with a significant 2.7 fold increased PTB risk. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our new findings demonstrated that EVTs in the basal plate are highly susceptible to bacterial invasion and persistence likely due to their unique immune-privileged status. The association of HLA-G EVT expression with PTB may be a pivot balancing fetal tolerance with maternal immunity in the basal plate and microbial colonization may tip the balance.",

INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia (PE) is characterized by a premature, pathologic release of syncytiotrophoblast microparticles (STBM) into maternal circulation. This process may systemically distribute sFLT-1 into the maternal circulation. We hypothesize STBM release exposes cytoplasmic actin to plasma and thereby depletes plasma gelsolin (pGSN), an abundant plasma protein that scavenges circulating actin and other pro-inflammatory mediators. We investigate pGSN's role on placental health and hypothesize that exogenous replacement of recombinant GSN may promote placental health by decreasing shedding of STBM and that plasma GSN (pGSN) may be reduced during severe PE. METHODS: To quantify if recombinant GSN negatively regulates STBM shedding from human placental explants, alkaline phosphatase levels (a proxy marker for STBM) were compared between conditioned media of CTL and GSN-treated explants. To mimic the phenotype of preeclamptic shedding, we characterize a novel mechanism using dynamic stretch as a biophysical stressor. We designed experiments in which placental explants incubate in conditioned media with or without GSN (100 mg/mL) and are either subject to no stretch or stretch with subsequent assay for placental alkaline phosphatase levels. Lastly, to confirm a pathological role for GSN in preeclampsia, we measure pGSN levels by ELISA. RESULTS: The addition of recombinant GSN (100 mg/mL) reduced shed STBM prepared for both low (40%, p<0.01, n = 12) or high-speed centrifugation (32. 4%, p<0.01, n=9) . With our dynamic stretch method, we found: 1) Stretch induced a 3-fold increase in STBM shedding over CTL (p<0.05) , 2) Pre-treatment with recombinant GSN significantly ameliorated STBM shedding and 3) Decreased STBM shedding by recombinant GSN was accompanied by lower sFLT1 levels in the supernatant. We found that GSN levels were dramatically lower in PE as compared to normal pregnancies (PE 906767 \u00b1 118110 mU/mL vs. NP 1766879 \u00b1 161310 mU/mL, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We report circulating GSN, a protein of maternal origin, may have a unique capability to promote placental syncytial health. By depleting pGSN, PE initiates a vicious cycle that results in increased inability to protect the placenta from premature shedding.",

            "text": "Decidualization Defect in Patients That Suffered Severe Preeclampsia Is Mediated through ANXA2 Deficiency. Tamara Garrido-Gomez, 1 Francisco Dominguez, 1 Alicia Quinonero, 1 Pablo Padilla Iserte, 2 Alfredo Perales Marin, 2 Carlos Simon. 1 1 Fundaci\u00f3n IVI, FUNDACION IVI, Valencia University, INCLIVA, Valencia, Spain; 2 Obstetricia, Ginecolog\u00eda y Reproducci\u00f3n Humana, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain. INTRODUCTION: Defects in human endometrial stromal cell (hESC) decidualization are related with trophoblast invasion alteration as a possible cause of preeclampsia. The aim of this work was to investigate the decidualization process in patients that have suffered early severe preeclampsia and the implication of annexin A2 (ANXA2) as key regulator of defective trophoblast invasion. METHODS: hESC of women that have suffered severe preeclampsia (PE) (N=18) and healthy patients (Non-PE) (N=13) were in vitro decidualized and PRL, IGFBP-1 and ANXA2 assessed. Trophoblast spreading was investigated in an in vitro model using hatched mouse embryos cocultured on decidual ANXA2 siRNA inhibited vs control hESCs. Trophoblast invasion was analyzed using JEG-3 cell line on collagen transwell invasion chambers. RESULTS: In vitro decidualization was successful at a reduced extent in hESC obtained from PE compared to Non-PE patients (24,9\u00b16,2% vs 80,7\u00b12,7%, respectively). During decidualization, secreted PRL and IGFBP-1 were significantly reduced in PE vs non-PE (4,2\u00b12,6 vs 18,11\u00b14,6 ng/mL for PRL; and 6,1\u00b11,7 vs 29,2\u00b17,2 ng/mL for IGFBP1). ANXA2 protein significantly increased in decidual vs non-decidual hESCs obtained from non-PE patients (73,5\u00b121,2 \u00b5g/mL vs 44,2\u00b116,9; 8,8\u00b14,1 vs 4,9\u00b12 \u00b5g/mL intra-and extracellular levels, respectively). Interestingly, this regulation was abolished during decidualization compared with non-decidualizated hESC in PE patients (13,5\u00b121,7 vs 16,9\u00b115,2 \u00b5g/mL; 2,5\u00b11,1 \u00b5g/mL vs 2,16\u00b10,8, intra-and extracellular levels, respectively). Trying to mimic the dynamics of ANXA2 in hESC from PE patients, ANXA2 siRNA transfected hESC showed a marked decrease in trophoblast spreading area compared to control cells (33,6%\u00b115,3 vs 81,3%\u00b113,5), as well as trophoblast invasion (49,2%\u00b19,1 vs 86,5%\u00b111,6). CONCLUSIONS: hESCs from patients that have suffered early severe PE showed a limited ability to decidualize and intra/extracellular ANXA2 regulation was abolished during decidualization. We further demonstrate in vitro that ANXA2 inhibition in hESC affects trophoblast spreading and invasion as a mechanism involved in the onset of the endometrial origin of PE.",

Joanna L Stanley, 1 Anita Quon, 2 Colin P Sibley, 3 Sandra T Davidge, 2 Philip N Baker. Preeclampsia is associated with widespread endothelial dysfunction. Increased concentrations of oxidised low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and expression of its receptor, the lectin-like oxidised low-density lipoprotein-1 receptor (LOX-1) have been observed in women with preeclampsia and animal models of the disease. Binding of oxLDL to LOX-1 may mediate endothelial dysfunction via a number of mechanisms, including increased superoxide production. We have shown previously that feeding mice, which lack the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT -/-), a high fat diet before pregnancy results in a preeclampsia-like phenotype, including increased blood pressure, impaired uteroplacental perfusion and fetal growth restriction. We hypothesize that LOX-1 expression will be increased in this model, and that this will be associated with increased superoxide production. METHODS: Control C57BL/6J and COMT -/mice were randomised to high fat diet (60% calories from fat) or normal chow (4% calories from fat) for 8 weeks prior to mating. Sections of thoracic aorta and placenta were collected at gestational day 18.5 (term=19.5). Western blotting was used to determine LOX-1 expression in aorta homogenates, using primary antibodies for . Placental and aortic sections were stained with dihydroethidium to determine superoxide production. RESULTS: There was a significant effect of high fat diet on LOX-1 expression (p=0.002). Expression of LOX-1 was significantly increased in C57BL/6J mice on high fat diet compared to chow fed controls (22.5\u00b12.0 vs 12.5\u00b11.5, LOX-1:Actin AU; p<0.05). There was no effect of high fat diet on superoxide production in aortic sections in C57BL/6J (96\u00b14% compared to control fed; p>0.05) or COMT -/mice (97\u00b16% compared to control fed; p>0.05). Further, there was no effect of high fat diet on superoxide production in placental sections from C57BL/6J (87\u00b18% compared to control fed; p>0.05) or COMT -/mice (92\u00b16% compared to control fed; p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of a high fat diet, which resulted in a preeclampsia-like phenotype, was associated with increased LOX-1 expression. Interestingly, there was no increase in superoxide production in this model, thus suggesting that LOX-1 may have alternative mechanisms for contributing to vascular complications in pregnancy.",

Emiel D Post Uiterweer, 1,2 Niels Eijkelkamp, 2 Marian J Groot Koerkamp, 3 Louis L Peeters, 1 Frank C Holstege, 3 Cobi J Heijnen, 2,4 Arie Franx. (uNK) cells are key regulators of the placental bed during early placental development and account for 70% of decidual leukocytes. uNK cells are involved in angiogenesis, trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling. Moreover, these cells may play a role in the etiology of placental syndromes (e.g. IUGR and preeclampsia) . Little is known about regulation of uNK cells in the decidual microenvironment which changes over the course of pregnancy. Objective: To elucidate uNK cell transcripts regulated in the 1 st and 2 nd trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: uNK cells from 1 st (7-8 wks, n=6) and 2 nd trimester decidual tissue (13-14 wks, n=6) were isolated by enzymatic digestion, followed by flow sorting of CD56 bright CD16 -CD3cells. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to genome-wide gene expression profiling. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated by qPCR. Freshly isolated 1 st trimester uNK cells (7-8 wks, n=5) were stimulated in vitro and expression of validated DEGs was analyzed by qPCR. RESULTS: We identified 140 DEGs in purified uNK cells between the 1 st and 2 nd trimester. Bioinformatical analysis revealed upregulation of a large cluster of \"interferon stimulated genes\" (ISGs) in 2 nd trimester uNK cells, e.g. ISG15 and ISG20. To determine whether this was mediated by type I (INFa, INFb) or type II interferons (INFg), uNK cells were stimulated with 10, 100 and 1000 U/mL of INFa, INFb and INFg. Both INFa and INFb enhanced ISG15 (up to 4.6 and 14.9 fold respectively) and ISG20 (7.5 and 32.5 fold) expression in a dose dependent fashion (2-way ANOVA p<0.001). INFg stimulation had no effect on ISG15 and ISG20 expression. Meanwhile, INFs did not alter the expression of DEGs outside the ISG cluster, such as IGFBP1 and amphiregulin. CONCLUSIONS: The uNK cell transcriptome changes over the course of early human pregnancy, with a major cluster of ISGs being upregulated in the 2 nd trimester. This change in uNK cell transcriptome may reflect enhanced type I but not type II INF signaling. We hypothesize that type I INFs are an important signal for uNK cells to promote the orderly and precisely timed process of placentation.",

INTRODUCTION: Ovulatory obese women exhibit decreased fertility and higher miscarriage rates relative to normal weight controls. Obesity is linked to decreased progesterone secretion, suggesting a dysfunctional corpus luteum, but molecular mechanisms are unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are implicated in corpus luteum development and function including steroidogenesis. However, their role in obesity-related subfertility has not been investigated. METHODS: 10 adult, regularly menstruating female vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops) were randomly placed on a high fat, high fructose (HFHF) or control diet for 10 months. Luteectomies were performed, before and after, dietary intervention on luteal day 7-9 (based on follicular phase estradiol peak). RNA was isolated by RNEasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen) and integrity and quantity determined by Agilent Biolanalyzer. miRNA libraries were prepared and sequenced using TruSeq Small RNA kit for Illumina HiSeq. MiRNA sequences were identified, based on human homologs, and quantified using a custom in-house script. Differential expression in response to diet and correlations to changes in weight and fat mass (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) were tested by ANOVA in R. RESULTS: Dietary intervention resulted in 20% weight gain for HFHF fed monkeys vs 2% in controls (p=0.03). 5 miRNAs were differentially expressed in response to HFHF diet. miR-27a and miR-28 were increased, while miR-10b, miR-191 and miR-7641 decreased. MiR-27a and miR-28 are known to suppress secretion of progesterone and inhibit granulosa cell proliferation. Conversely, miR-191 stimulates progesterone release and promotes granulosa cell survival.

On the contrary, no differences were found for the 3' UTR haplotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The haplotype containing G at the -725 SNP in the 5'URR region of the HLA-G gene is significantly associated with spontaneous abortion. It is currently known that the transposition of a C to a G at position -725 creates a CpG dinucleotide at nts -726 and -725, possibly influencing the binding of interferon response factor-1 (IRF-1) to the gene, with potential implication for HLA-G expression. The parallel ongoing analysis of HLA-G protein expression on regulatory cells in the decidua of women with SA will allow potential association of specific HLA-G haplotypes with decidual tolerance and early reproductive failure. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder which places pregnant women at increased risk of recurrent pregnancy loss and preeclampsia. APS is characterized by circulating antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) that bind beta 2 glycoprotein I (b 2 GPI) expressed by the trophoblast, leading to altered placental function and adverse pregnancy outcomes. One way in which aPL alter trophoblast function is by inducing an inflammatory IL-8 response through activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). MicroRNAs (miRs) can modulate inflammatory responses, and some have been found to both target TLR signaling and be induced by TLRs. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of aPL on trophoblast miR-9 and miR-146a expression and function; two miRs known to be induced by TLR4.",

For functional studies, HTR8 cells were transfected with anti-miR-146a inhibitor or miR scramble control (100nM) and then treated with or without IIC5. Culture supernatants were collected and measured for IL-8 by ELISA. RESULTS: Treatment of trophoblast cells with the aPL IIC5 significantly upregulated expression of miR-146a by 1.43 fold after 24h (p<0.05) and by 2.02 fold after 48h (p<0.001) when compared to the untreated control. There was no significant change at earlier time points. In contrast, expression of miR-9 was not significantly modulated by IIC5 at any time point. Treatment of trophoblast cells with IIC5 in the presence of miR scramble control significantly increased IL-8 secretion by 2.14 fold (p<0.05) and this was significantly reduced to 1.65 fold in the presence of the anti-miR-146a inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate for the first time that aPL induce miR-146a expression in human trophoblast cells. Furthermore, our data indicate that miR-146a may function to promote aPL-induced trophoblast IL-8 secretion. Together, these findings suggest a novel mechanism by which aPL and miRs together modulate trophoblast function and thus, may induce adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with APS.",

Quantitative metabolite profiles in CSE and CBS null mice show, for the first time, sex-specific differences in transulfuration biochemistry. METHODS: We quantified sulfur metabolites by mass spectrometry in male and female CSE null mice and in wild type C57Bl/6 controls. Transulfuration pathway enzyme expression was evaluated by Western blot, and CBS or CSE enzyme activity was measured in vitro. The influence of estrogen and progesterone (0.5mg/kg x 2d) on homocysteine metabolism was evaluated in ovariectomized female mice. Plasma metabolic profiling in juvenile (3.5w) and older (8w) mice delineated changes due to sexual maturation. Comparative histologic assessment of liver injury in CBS -/and CSE -/animals was performed to evaluate tHcy pathologic effects. RESULTS: Female CSE -/mice have 3-fold higher plasma tHcy than agematched CSE -/males. MethyleneTetraHydroFolate Reductase enzyme expression was decreased in both male and female CSE null mice. The elevated tHcy in CSE -/females is due to sex-specific impairment of Methionine Synthase activity and decreased plasma methionine. This impairment occurs only after sexual maturation, and is unaffected by ovariectomy or estrogen/progesterone add back in adult mice. CSE -/females incur mild hepatic steatosis without detectable fibrosis or increased plasma ALT. Plasma tHcy in CSE -/female mice is comparable to the high levels in CBS -/mice, but the degree of liver-injury is markedly attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: CSE null mice reveal sex-specific metabolic changes at sexual maturity that are not influenced by estrogen or progesterone. We suspect that increased cystathionine is protective for homocysteinemediated liver injury, and perhaps other oxidative insults. Female sex may be an important regulator of the biochemical sequelae of inherited metabolic disorders, and cystathionine may have as yet unrecognized beneficial properties. Hypoxia is known to induce endothelin-2 (EDN-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the preovulatory granulosa cells. miR-210 has been previously linked with the hypoxia pathway and is up regulated in response to hypoxia-inducible factors. We studied the effect of miR-210 on hypoxia induced factor 1a (HIF-1a) protein and its inducible genes EDN-2 and VEGF in normoxic and hypoxic conditions in human granulosa cell line. METHODS: miR 210 was analyzed in vitro in a tissue culture model of SVOG cells. Cells were transfected with either synthetic miR 210 molecules or specific inhibitor of miR-210 and cells were cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions (induced by 100mM of CoCl 2) for 24 Friday hours post transfection. EDN-2 and VEGF mRNA expression levels were assayed using real time PCR with the specific primers. HIF-1a protein level was measured using immunoblotting.",

The EDN-2 and VEGF expression was 2 fold higher in transfected cells under normoxic conditions. After 24h of induced hypoxia the transfected cells significantly increased their expression of EDN-2 and VEGF mRNA. In the reciprocal experiment, cells transfected with miR-210 inhibitor demonstrated reduced expression levels of EDN-2 and VEGF in normoxic as well as in hypoxic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: miR-210 was found to increase the expression of HIF-1a protein under hypoxic conditions in human granulosa cells and also to increase the expression of hypoxia inducible genes: EDN-2 and VEGF. This genes increased expression occurs also without the presence of hypoxia. Antagonizing miR-210 effect by miR-210-inhibitor abolishes these normoxic and hypoxic effects. Our results suggest an independent effect of miR 210 on angiogenesis and on the endothelin system in the active human corpus luteum (CL).

METHODS: Genes were selected from the literature that were involved in hypothalamic or pituitary development, GnRH or olfactory neuron migration, GnRH gene regulation/function, and were positional candidates from chromosomal translocations. Following DNA fragmentation and target enrichment, Illumina ready libraries were constructed using HaloPlex target enrichment kits. Samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 to generate paired-end reads of 100 nucleotides and >30X coverage. Bases were called using SureSelect V1.1.

An obesogenic diet has negative effects on the oocyte in a murine model, disrupting meiotic spindles and causing abnormalities in lipid accumulation as well as aneuploidy. These negative effects translate into an altered reproductive phenotype demonstrating reduced reproductive efficiency and negatively impacted litters. We aimed to determine if reversing the metabolic phenotype seen in the high fat diet-fed mouse model also leads to a reversal of the altered reproductive phenotype. METHODS: Sixty C57BL6/J mice were placed on either control chow (n=30) or a high-fat diet consisting of 52% lipid (HFD) (n=30) for a period of six weeks. Metabolic parameters including weight and serum parameters were assessed, and then all mice were placed on control chow for eight weeks. Following this \"washout\" period, metabolic parameters were repeated, and mice were sacrificed. MII and GV oocytes were collected and subjected to immunostaining of the meiotic spindle as well as BODIPY staining of lipid droplets. Images were evaluated and analyzed by a blind observer.",

These findings could have implications when counseling and treating obese, subfertile women. In these patients low number of retrieved oocytes and poor embryos quality are associated with low pregnancy outcome. Growth hormone (GH) has been used in patient with DOR in attempt to improve pregnancy rate. Growth Differentiation Factor 9 (GDF9) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 15 (BMP15) are members of the transforming growth factor b superfamily and are essential for oocyte maturation. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of GH on oocytes and embryos quality in patients with DOR undergoing IVF -ET and to investigate the effect of GH on the expression of GDF9 and BMP15. METHODS: 81 patients undergoing IVF-ET for DOR using GnRH antagonist protocol were selected. 25 patients received GH (5 IUI / day), were compared to control group of 56 patients both age and FSH matched, who did not use GH. Total days of stimulation, number of oocytes retrieved, oocytes maturity, fertilization rate and blastocyst formation were compared between the two groups. Follicular fluids (FF) collected from mature oocytes during the oocyte retrievals were used to measure level of estradiol, progesterone, FSH and AMH using ELISA. RNA extracted from granulosa cells was used to measure the expression of BMP15 and GDF9 using RT-PCR. Comparison between the two groups was performed with the independent t test. Spearman correlation coefficient calculated to detect any correlation between RNA expression and hormone concentrations. RESULTS: FF from GH patients had significantly lower AMH level compared to control, there were no significant differences in other hormones measured. Using RT-PCR, BMP 15 and GDP 9 expressions were 9 and 4 folds higher, respectively, in GH group compared to control. Patients in the GH group had more oocytes retrieved (P < 0.01) and higher percentage of mature oocytes (P < 0.05). GH group also had a higher ICSI fertilization rate and blastocysts formation (P< 0.05, P < 0.005, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates GH could play a significant role in improving ART outcome in patients with DOR.

INTRODUCTION: Intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality and is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease as an adult. Placental insufficiency accounts for 75% of IUGR cases. IUGR is associated with IGF-1 or IGF-2 deficiency and we previously demonstrated adenovirus-mediated intra-placental human IGF-1 gene therapy overcame growth restriction in a murine model of placental insufficiency. However, in order for translational gene therapy application in the human placenta, development of a non-viral tissuespecific transgene delivery system is essential. This study determined whether nanoparticle mediated Hu-IGF-1 treatments using trophoblastspecific promoters (Cyp19a and PLAC1) in a mouse model for placental insufficiency resulted in transgene expression and if expression levels of Hu-IGF-1 were sufficient enough for the pup to overcome placental insufficiency. METHODS: At day 16 of gestation, through laparotomy, uterine artery branch ligation (UABL) was performed and treatments of either nanoparticle (NP) +PLAC1-HuIGF-1, or NP+Cyp19a-HuIGF-1 were administered by intra-placental injection. Pups were delivered on day 20. Outcome data included placental weight and structure as determined by stereology and transgene expression by RTqPCR analysis and birth weight. RESULTS: Both trophoblast-specific Nanoparticle+HuIGF-1 treatments resulted in transgene expression in the mouse placenta; however, higher gene expression levels were noted with the Cyp19a promoter. Neither placental weight nor Labyrinth depth was altered in any of the groups. Following UABL, birthweight (0.83 \u00b1 0.08) was significantly (p<0.05, n>5 per treatment) reduced compared to non-ligated internal control pups (1.11 \u00b1 0.1), pups whose placentas had received NP+PLAC1-HuIGF-1 treatment had increased birthweight (1.02 \u00b1 0.02) compared to UABL (p<0.05, n>4 per treatment) that were comparable with internal controls. NP+Cyp19a-HuIGF-1treatment (0.915 \u00b1 0.1, n=4) did not result in increased birthweight compared to UABL. CONCLUSIONS: Nanoparticle-mediated treatment, under control of the PLAC1 promoter was successful in transgene expression in the mouse placenta and capable of maintaining normal fetal growth following uterine artery branch ligation.",

METHODS: Patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma, who have previously undergone vaccination with OC-DC, underwent apheresis followed by the infusion of cyclophosphamide/fludarabine to induce lymphodepletion. Peripheral T cells gained by apheresis were expanded and stimulated by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies and IL-2. Adoptive transfer of expanded vaccine-primed T cells was followed by OC-DC vaccination and administration of intravenous bevacizumab 28 days later and bevacizumab every four weeks for a total of three doses. Immune related progression-free and overall survival was determined by CT scan and IR guided biopsy at the end of the study. RESULTS: Eight patients have completed vaccination and T cell transfer to date. The average number of OC-DC vaccine received prior to T cell transfer was 8. Following lymphodepletion, adoptive transfer of vaccineprimed, CD3/CD28-costimulated autologous T cells only produced grade 1 toxicity and resulted in durable reduction of CD4 + FoxP3 + T regulatory cells. Adoptive transfer of T cells was well tolerated in all patients and increased the total lymphocyte counts and restored vaccine-induced antitumor immunity in all five patients (63%) who experienced clinical benefit at end of study. The remaining three patients (37%) experienced disease progression and restoration of vaccine-induced antitumor immunity was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the combination of cellular immunotherapy comprising of DC vaccination with whole tumor antigen and adoptive T cell transfer using tumor antigen-specific T cells is a safe and promising approach for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer.",

Additional investigation is warranted. (GCT) is an ovarian malignancy of the sex cord stromal origin. It is characterized by a late recurrence associated with increased mortality. InhibinB is the currently utilized serum marker for GCT, but its levels fluctuate in premenopausal patients. Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) has been suggested as a marker for GCT in small and retrospective series, but evidence is lacking from larger cohorts, and especially in comparison to InhibinB. Our objective was to study serum AMH and InhibinB as single or combined markers in one of the internationally largest cohorts of pre-and postmenopausal GCT patients. METHODS: 123 GCT patients participated in this partially prospective, longitudinal cohort study. 560 serum samples were collected prior to surgery, chemotherapy, or during follow-up. Serum AMH and InhibinB were measured with immunoenzymometric assays. RESULTS: Serum AMH and InhibinB levels were equally elevated in pre-and postmenopausal patients with primary or recurrent GCT. AMH and InhibinB performed similarly in ROC-AUC analyses; AUC values were 0.92 (95%CI 0.88-0.95) for AMH, and 0.94 (95%CI 0.90-0.96) for InhibinB, respectively. AMH was highly sensitive (92%) and specific (85%) in detecting a macroscopic GCT; the highest sensitivity (94%) and specificity (92%) were, however, reached when AMH and InhibinB were combined. Serum AMH was elevated a median of 3.4 years and InhibinB 2.8 years prior the detection of a macroscopic tumor. The AMH and InhibinB levels positively correlated to tumor size (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Serum AMH is a sensitive and specific marker for GCT, and performs equally to InhibinB. The combination of the two markers is recommended for the follow-up of GCT patients. UPSC is an aggressive malignancy that accounts for more than 40% of uterine cancer deaths. The molecular events leading to UPSC are largely unknown. Epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 oncogene (ECT2) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rho-GEF) that catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP by Rho family GTPases. High levels of ECT2 expression have been reported in brain, lung and breast cancers, where they promote metastasis. However, the role of ECT2 in UPSC has not been previously explored. METHODS: After obtaining IRB permission, levels of ECT2 transcript and protein were measured in flash frozen specimens of endometrium (n=8) and UPSC (n =8) by Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR.",

RESULTS: Our data indicate that ECT2 is overexpressed >4-fold in nearly all UPSC specimens tested (n=8, p<0.001). We also found that ECT2 is robustly expressed in the two UPSC cell lines tested. Knockdown of ECT2 decreased proliferation (UPSC-ARK1: 0.62-fold vs control; n=3, p<0.05; UPSC-ARK2: 0.34-fold vs control, p<0.05) and increased rates of apoptosis (UPSC-ARK1: 1.3-fold; n=3, p<0.05; UPSC-ARK2: 2.2-fold, n=3, p<0.05) in both cell lines tested. Reduced ECT2 expression led to decreased rates of colony formation by UPSC-ARK1 and UPSC-ARK2 cells transfected with target-specific siRNAs. Knockdown of ECT2 also significantly reduced rates of migration and invasion observed in vitro with both cell lines. Novel nanoliposomes targeting ECT2 are currently being tested for their ability to impair the growth and metastasis of UPSC in novel mouse xenograft models. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of ECT2 plays a critical role in promoting the growth and metastasis of UPSC. Targeting ECT2 expression may provide an effective strategy for improving outcomes for UPSC and other human cancers where hyperactivation of metastasis-promoting Rho GTPases are observed. INTRODUCTION: Granulosa cell tumor of the ovary (GCT) remains an enigma because little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of this tumor. We observed that JNK is activated in the proliferating granulosa cells of the growing follicles in human and, when interrupted by pharmacologic inhibitors, the mitosis of granulosa cells is blocked and in-vitro follicle growth is halted (Fig-1) . We therefore in this study, have translated these findings into human granulosa tumor by investigating the role of JNK pathway in this tumor. METHODS: Human GCT cell lines COV 434 and KGN were used. JNK pathway was inhibited by pharmacologic inhibitors (SP600125 and AS601245) and by siRNA. Cell proliferation was analyzed with xCelligence system (real-time and quantitative monitorization) and EdU assay. Live/dead cell assay was carried out using Yo-PRO-1 staining, and cell cycle via flow cytometry. RESULTS: SP600125 and AS601245 inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Jun Ser 10 in a dose-dependent fashion . The cells treated with the inhibitors at log phase exhibited dose-dependent growth arrest. The silencing of JNK via siRNA produced similar effects (Fig-1D, 1E, 1F ). Both inhibitors significantly blocked EdU uptake during S-phase (Fig-1G ).",

Stressful events included 5 minutes of swimming, 20 minutes of restraint, 5 minutes of shaking or 20 minutes of white noise, on alternate days. On 17.5 dpc, after the evening stress treatment, dams were placed under video surveillance until delivery. The following parameters were assessed: duration of gestation and labor, number of dams with viable pups, pup viability, weight, survival at birth and 1-3 weeks postpartum. An additional group (F0-NS; n=14) was not stressed.Statistical analysis was performed using nonparametric statistics. A p\u22640.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: 1) The duration of pregnancy was shorter in F0-S and F1-SS stressed dams than in F0-NS non-stressed dams (F0-S 18.77 \u00b1 0.14 vs. F0-NS 19.27 \u00b1 0.05; p=0.001, and F1-SS 18.98 \u00b1 0.12 vs. F0-NS 19.27 \u00b1 0.05 days; p=0.046); 2) duration of labor was longer in F0-S and F1-SS stressed dams than in F0-NS non-stressed dams (F0-S 86.93 \u00b1 7.81 vs. F0-NS 66.85 \u00b1 4.1; p=0.05, and F1-SS 118.17 \u00b1 14.64 vs. F0-NS 66.85 \u00b1 4.1 minutes; p=0.001); 3) F1-SS pups weighed less than F0-S pups at 2 weeks postpartum (5.43 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 6.13 \u00b1 0.23 grams; p=0.047).

Prenatal stress in the first generation was associated with a lower neonatal weight at 2 weeks. Yet, prenatal stress in the second generation was associated with heavier neonates at 3 weeks of age. These findings indicate that prenatal stress leads to pregnancy complications and has transgenerational effects on the neonatal weight. Maternal obesity (MO) triggers adverse OFF changes in energy metabolism, affecting organs such as liver by changes in sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP 1-c) transcription factor and fatty acid synthase (FAS) that modulate lipogenesis and promote liver lipid accumulation. We hypothesized that maternal exercise would prevent these harmful OFF changes. METHODS: F0 female Wistar rats ate either control or obesogenic diet from weaning through lactation. Half of each group wheel ran 30 min/day, 5 times/week from day 90 of life through pregnancy beginning day (120) providing four groups (n=8/ group). 1) maternal control (C), 2) maternal obese (MO), 3) exercised controls (CEx), and 4) exercised maternal obese (MOEx). After weaning F1 OFF ate C diet. At postnatal day (PND) 110 body and liver were weighed. Liver H & E histology, gene expression (RT-qPCR) and Western blot were performed. M \u00b1 SEM, one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: Body and liver weight were lower in CEx OFF vs MO. MO fat percentage was greater than all groups (Fig 1A and 1F ). SREBP 1-c, FAS mRNA and protein were higher in MO than C and CEx, however F1 OFF from MOEx decreased SREBP 1-c, FAS proteins and mRNA (Fig B, C, D and E) . CONCLUSIONS: MO increased liver fat accumulation by SREBP1-c and FAS over-expression in male OFF. MOEx prevents these adverse OFF changes indicating the potential power of Ex in preventing development of MO OFF metabolic diseases. In this study we aim to determine whether the suppression of inflammatory cytokine production in T-cells in pregnancy is mediated via Fas/FasL interactions and whether the source of FasL is placentally derived. METHODS: CD95 (Fas) expression was determined in CD3+T-cells from non-pregnant and pregnant women by flow cytometry. Jurkat T-cells were cultured at 1x10 6 /mL in RPMI +/-10ng/ml PMA and 500ng/mL ionomycin (P/I) for 4hrs and subsequently lysed in Trizol for mRNA extraction. Jurkats were also cultured in the presence of 2.5\u00b5g/mL CH11 +/-100 or 500ng/mL of the Fas inactivating Ab ZB4 overnight, or 150mg/mL exosomes derived from non-pregnant or pregnant plasma and subsequently lysed for analysing by Western blotting. Exosomes were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation and purified on a sucrose gradient. RESULTS: Fas expression was significantly (p<0.05) increased in circulating T-cells during pregnancy relative to non-pregnant controls (median values 58.12% and 41.98%, respectively). Stimulation of Jurkat T-cells with P/I results in an increased production of IFNg and IL-2 mRNA. In contrast, activation of Fas using the Fas activating antibody CH11 prior to P/I stimulation resulted in suppressed p65 expression and an inability to induce IFNg and IL-2. Fas expression on Jurkat T-cells was reduced by ~50% using siRNAs to Fas. Reduced Fas expression resulted in an inability of these cells to respond to CH11. Levels of p65 remained high which resulted in transfected cells producing IFNg and IL-2 mRNA in response to P/I stimulation. The source of p65 suppression is placentally derived, only those exosomes from maternal plasma that were FasL+ were able to suppress p65 in Jurkat T-cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that Fas/FasL interactions regulate the level of p65 expression in maternal T-cells throughout pregnancy, and ultimately inflammatory cytokine production. The amount of Fas expressed on maternal T-cells and the abundance of FasL placental exosomes in maternal circulation will dictate the ability of T-cells to alter the cytokine to a favorable one for pregnancy success.",

Moreover, unfavorable, but modifiable, metabolic syndrome risk constituents relate to heart failure stage B.",

We performed a nested study of 83 normal (BMI=18.5-24.9) compared to 55 OW (BMI=25-29.9) and 56 O women (BMI=>30) to study 4 profiles of risk. These profiles are: 1) Vitamin D (Brain/Neuro); 2) Blood Pressure (Cardiovascular) ; 3) C-Reactive Protein (Inflammation); 4), HgA1c, HDL cholesterol & waist circumference (Metabolic Dysregulation). Each parameter was given a score of 0(normal), 1(borderline), 2(abnormal) to calculate an Risk Score. All biomarkers were determined on blood spots using a Cleo Reference Laboratory ZRT (info@zrtlab.com). Standard definitions were used to define scores of 0 to 3 according to accepted ranges. HDL [p=0.132] . Risk Score means significanly differed accrosse the 3 groups and revealed an increasing trend (p=<0.0001) The best clinical profile was profile 3 indicating 59% of Normal women as \"healthy\" compared to 16.1% in the OW group and 3.6% in the O group. This profile fits into the \"healthy profile\" defined by Bluher. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study using vitamin D plus standard regulatory Allostatic markers to identify the degree of metabolic dysregulation and the first to identify the low per cent of OW & O women during the postpartum period with a normal risk profile. Intervention to reduce risk at this critical period for both women and children is important. This study aims to assess parameters of cardiovascular function in the early postpartum PE period. METHODS: Peripheral microvascular function was determined in normotensive women (n=25) in the third trimester of uncomplicated pregnancies, with re-evaluation at two months and six months postpartum.",

Cutaneous microvascular reactivity to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), delivered locally by iontophoresis, was measured by laser Doppler perfusion monitoring. RESULTS: Preliminary data suggests that pregnancy enhances endothelial-dependent vasodilation (ACh, P<0.001; SNP, P>0.05) as indicated by third trimester measurements. Elevated endothelialdependent vasodilation persisted at six weeks postpartum (ACh, P<0.05; SNP, P>0.05), and declined towards non-pregnant levels by six months postpartum (ACh, SNP, P>0.05). Vascular reactivity was blunted in the PE group at six weeks postpartum (ACh, P<0.05; SNP, P<0.05) but was similar at six months postpartum to levels measured in normotensive postpartum women. PE subjects displayed higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures at all postpartum visits, and presented with greater weight retention following pregnancy, despite having similar pre-pregnancy BMIs to the control group.

METHODS: Myometrial biopsies were collected from elective n=5 ) and spontaneous labor (LAB 37-40wks, n=5) C-section. PLCL1 mRNA was analyzed by RNA-seq and protein expression via western blotting and IHC. The effect of PLCL1 on Ca 2+ signaling was determined by confocal imaging in primary human myometrial cells (PMC) (passage 1-2, n=3) pre-loaded with Fluo-4.

CONCLUSIONS: Down-regulation of PLCL1 in laboring samples suggests a key role in labor. We propose that PLCL1 universally inhibits Ca 2+ signaling by binding IP 3 to prevent IP 3 receptor activation. As a chelator of IP 3 signaling, PLCL1 could act non-selectively absorbing signals from all Ca 2+ -mobilizing hormones during pregnancy to maintain quiescence. At term the protein is down-regulated, thus removing an important inhibitor of uterine stimulation. PLCL1 could be a pharmaceutical target for the prevention of preterm birth and/or induction of labor.",

RESULTS: In vivo, while low levels of ER stress (TM, 0.04 mg/kg b.w.) did not effect gestational timing, higher ER stress levels (TM, 0.2 -1 mg/ kg b.w.) led to a preterm birth phenotype which occurred 12-24 h post TM administration. In contrast co-administration of PBA reversed the ER stress induced preterm birth phenotype allowing live births delivered at term. The preterm birth phenotype was accompanied by a precocious decline in uterine CASP3 levels followed by a surge in myometrial Cx-43 levels. Circulating P4 levels were maintained. In vitro we confirmed Cx43 to be a target of ERSR induced CASP3 action. We have identified a potential CASP3 cleavage site in Cx43, which targets Cx43 for proteolytic cleavage. TM-treated hTERT-HM cells confirmed our in vivo observations, that a surge in ERSR induced CASP3 activation resulted in a rapid and marked reduction in Cx43 levels.

Owing to their importance in regulating contraction and relaxation, there is interest in understanding how inflammatory mediators, which are known to induce preterm labor, regulate MaxiK channel activity in uterine smooth muscle cells.

Cell-attached single channel patch clamp studies were performed to understand the role of A2M in regulating MaxiK activity. Ca 2+ imaging was performed on MSMCs to investigate whether A2M causes Ca 2+ influx. RESULTS: Our data revealed an interaction between A2M and MaxiK in MSMCs. PLA revealed that MaxiK is associated with A2M and its receptor A2MR in MSMCs. Patch clamp studies showed that treating MSMCs with activated A2M (A2M*) enhances channel activity by increasing the open-state probability of MaxiK. We also found that A2M* causes Ca 2+ influx in MSMCs, which may serve as the mechanism for channel activation. Interestingly, these effects were not observed with inactive A2M or RAP, a competitive antagonist of A2MR. Taken together, these data indicate that A2M* influences MaxiK activity via A2MR by regulating the intracellular [Ca 2+ ] in human MSM. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of physical and functional interactions of MaxiK with A2M and A2MR in human MSMCs. It also suggests the novel role of A2M as a modulator of MaxiK channel that may, in turn, influence myometrial activity. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying labor onset are still poorly understood and there are divergent results between in vivo observations and in vitro studies showing a weak contractile response of myometrial cells to inflammatory stimuli. Owing to the massive influx of immune cells, especially macrophages, in the myometrium prior to labor onset, we hypothesized that macrophages might be responsible for myometrial cells activation. Uterine activation is associated with apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) and metalloproteinases induction (MMP2/MMP9), prostaglandins synthesis (via COX-2), cytoskeleton reorganization (actin, desmin, h-caldesmon) and cell synchronization (via connexin-43).",

TUNEL and activated caspase 3 expression were done to measure apoptosis and pH3 analyses were done to measure proliferation. RESULTS: Ovaries of mice with one wild type allele of Amhr2 and constitutively activated b-catenin had a normal follicular phenotype in our analyses. Mice with both alleles of Amhr2 deleted and constitutively activated b-catenin had higher numbers of large follicles, and in some cases showed evidence of hyperthecosis. AMH expression persisted in the mural granulosa cells in antral follicles and inhibin expression was observed in smaller follicles compared with controls. Targets of b-catenin expression and proliferation were elevated and apoptosis levels were lower in Amhr2-negative, constitutively activated b-catenin ovaries.

The performance of the model was tested by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC). RESULTS: 326 women were included, of which 189 (58%) presented with an ongoing pregnancy (8% multiples) and delivered. One or two maternal complications occurred in 62 (33%) women; mainly GDM (n=41;22%), and pregnancy-induced hypertension (n=14;7%). In children, one or two complication(s) were observed in 49 (26%) out of 206 children born; i.e. premature delivery (n=23;12%), and small for gestational age (n=15;8%). The prediction model for GDM performed well (AUC ROC 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.93). Independent predictors in the prediction model were first-degree relatives with type 2 diabetes mellitus, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, androstenedione, and sex hormone-binding globulin. CONCLUSIONS: Women with PCOS achieving a pregnancy have a high risk of developing pregnancy complications, especially GDM.

The uptake of micronutrients, in particular folate and cobalamine, is dependent on the pH of the gastrointestinal milieu and shortages of these B vitamins affect human spermatogenesis. It is therefore hypothesized that acid-reducing drugs influence semen quality.

We excluded men using medication other than the medication of interest and we used only semen analysis performed 70 days before and up to 21 days after the visit. General questionnaires were completed and blood samples were obtained. Acidreducing drugs were used in 18 men and comprised antacids, proton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses were performed with adjustments for confounders. RESULTS: Acid-reducing drugs users showed a more than 3-fold higher risk for having a low motile sperm concentration (<3x10 6/ mL) (OR 3.11; 95%CI 1.20-8.07).

Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that expression of Apo-E mRNA was up-regulated in testes from TBTtreated groups compared with controls while the expression of androgen receptor (AR), FSHR, estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) were decreased. CONCLUSIONS: We posit that exposure to TBT hinders intracellular cholesterol transport resulting in abnormal sex steroid biosynthesis and subsequent spermatogenic defects. Importantly, these effects may account for the decreased level of normal sperm observed in humans exposed to TBT.",

INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's is a common neurodegenerative disease caused by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and insufficient dopamine concentrations within the striatum. Stem cell therapies may provide an unparalleled opportunity to supplant the lost dopaminergic neurons and protect the autologous neurons from loss. In this non-human primate model, we utilized 1-Methyl-4 phenyl-1,2,3,6tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce selective neurodegeneration of the nigral dopaminergic neurons and used endometrial derived stem cells (EDSC) as treatment. METHODS: Three male african green monkeys were exposed to lowdose MPTP. Endometrial samples were collected from eight monkeys. Stromal cell cultures were generated and enriched for EDSCs. After 7 days in culture, cells were stained with PKH26, resuspended in MEM at a concentration of 100,000 cells/ml. Cells were injected into two stereotaxic targets in one caudate nucleus of each monkey. The opposite side received MEM only. One month after injection monkeys were sacrificed and brain prepared for immunofluorescence and dopamine metabolite Homovanillic acid (HVA) measurement. Anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody was used for immunofluorescence. The number of TH(+) cells was counted in multiple fields. Statistical analysis was done by t-test and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test.",

PKH26 labeled EDSC showed the ability to engraft in the striatum and migrate to the substantia nigra. The transplantation of EDSC resulted in consistently higher numbers of TH(+) cells in the transplanted side (42 vs 62). Some engrafted cells differentiated from a stem cell phenotype into a neurogenic phenotype as evidenced by neurite like projections and TH expression. Most impressively, striatal mean HVA concentrations were 8.2 ng/ml higher on the EDSC transplanted side of the brain, indicating a therapeutic response (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: EDSC differentiated into a neuron-like phenotype in vivo and expressed TH, the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine production. EDSC transplantation was associated with greater neuronal protection as demonstrated by higher TH(+) counts and dopamine metabolite concentration on the transplanted side of the brain. The endometrium represents an important source of stem cells with remarkable plasticity and vast therapeutic potential.",

            "text": "INTRODUCTION: X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the mechanism female cells use to silence one of their two X-chromosomes and equalize the dosage of X-linked gene products to male cells. XCI is regulated from a locus on the X-chromosome termed the X-inactivation centre (Xic). The Xic can be divided into a cis-acting part and a trans-acting part. The cis-acting part is responsible for inactivating the X-chromosome in cis, while the trans-acting part is required for counting the number of X-chromosomes in a cell and for the negative feedback that prevents from inactivating too many X-chromosomes. Thus far the solely identified trans-acting gene is Rnf12. Importantly, our current knowledge on XCI comes from studies in mice and mouse embryonic stemcells, while the human XIC has scarcely been investigated. In this study we had an unique combination of several patients that demonstrate that the human XIC can also be divided in a cis-acting part and a trans-acting part. METHODS: In a single patient with a deletion on the X, the deletion was mapped using CGH arrays, and fine-mapped using Qpcr. Skewing of XCI was assessed on metaphase cells. In three families mutations in RNF12 were identified using exome sequencing. The function of the three RNF12 mutants was tested by expressing the mutant protein in HEK293 cells, together with REX1, a known target of RNF12. Skewing of XCI was assessed using a pcr-based assay. RESULTS: The deletion of the Xic was mapped to a region of roughly 1,1Mb, encompassing the genes XIST, TSIX, JPX, CHIC1, CDX4, NAP1L2, NAP1L6 and DMRTC1, but leaving RNF12 intact. FISH on metaphase cells showed that all cells inactivated the unmutated X-chromosome. The mutant RNF12 proteins showed a very moderate effect on REX1 ubiquitination and degradation. All individuals carrying an RNF12 mutation showed exclusive inactivation of the mutant X-chromosome. CONCLUSIONS: The deletion in our patient identifies the human cis-acting XIC, and maps it to a region homologous to the mouse Xic. Also, cells harboring this deletion are still able to undergo XCI of the unaffected X-chromosome, showing that the trans-acting XIC responsible for counting and feedback regulation is unaffected. In the families with an RNF12 mutation the trans-acting XIC is affected, resulting in the exclusive inactivation of the X-chromosome with this mutation. Together, these results show that the human XIC can be divided in a cis-acting part and a trans-acting part, as in mice. The highly regenerative endometrium contains rare epithelial and stromal stem/progenitor cells (SPC). However their role in endometrial regeneration is not clear due to lack of a traceable marker. Our goal was to use telomerase reporter mice (1,2) to identify mouse endometrial SPC and examine their epithelial differentiation potential. METHODS: mTert-GFP mice were examined for GFP expression using endogenous GFP fluorescence or GFP antibody, and confocal microscopy. Cell lineage tracing used mTert-CreER::R26R mice, which were injected with tamoxifen on postnatal day 3 to permanently mark mTert lineage with LacZ expression, and were harvested 10 (prepubertal, n=4) and \u226540 days (cycling, n=12) later. Mouse uteri were also dissociated and examined by flow cytometry to identify intrinsic non-leukocyte (CD45 -ve) mTert+ stromal cells. Dual colour fluorescence microscopy was used to co-localise mTert+ cells with proliferating (Ki-67), BrdU+ label retaining, or estrogen receptor-a (ERa) expressing cells.",

The mTert+ cells were distinct from stromal and epithelial labelretaining cells previously identified in mouse endometrium. The mTert+ endometrial stromal cells did not express ERa or proliferate in response to estrogen. A close spatial relationship between mTert+ and Ki-67+ epithelial cells suggests that mTert+ cells may give rise to proliferating epithelial transit amplifying cells. Lineage tracing showed that mTert lineage cells were confined to the stroma of prepubertal endometrium, but contributed to glandular and luminal epithelium in adult cycling mice. In adult mice, removal of endogenous estrogen by ovariectomy resulted in endometrial atrophy and blocked expansion of the epithelial mTert lineage. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that epithelial structures of the adult cycling endometrium originate from an mTert+ stromal SPC that undergoes mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition during endometrial growth and development. This is the first report of a traceable marker for endometrial progenitors with epithelial differentiation potential. ). Mice were euthanized 12 hours post-injection, just prior to preterm delivery. Peripheral blood, spleen, thymus, inguinal lymph nodes and uterine lymph nodes were harvested and cell suspensions analyzed using fluorochromes conjugated to antibodies and flow cytometry. We determined the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ Tregs (CD4+CD25+ FoxP3+/CD8+CD25+FoxP3+). Statistical analysis was performed with nonparametric statistics. A p\u22640.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: 1) the proportion of splenic CD4+ and CD8+ Tregs was higher in pregnant mice treated with LPS than in those treated with PBS (p<0.003); 2) the proportion of thymic CD4+ Tregs was also higher in pregnant mice treated with LPS than in control mice (p=0.006); 3) LPS treatment of non-pregnant mice did not change the proportion of CD4+ or CD8+ Tregs in spleen or thymus; 4) LPS treatment of pregnant mice did not affect the proportion of Tregs or T cells in peripheral blood; 5) however, LPS treatment of non-pregnant mice reduced the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (p<0.015), and increased the proportion of CD8+ Tregs in peripheral circulation (p=0.002); and 6) pregnant mice had lower proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ Tregs in peripheral blood (p=0.002 and <0.0001, respectively) and a lower proportion of CD4+ Tregs in uterine lymph nodes and spleen (p=0.015 and 0.005, respectively) than non-pregnant mice. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant mice respond differently to LPS treatment than non-pregnant mice. Unexpectedly, LPS treatment of pregnant mice increases the proportion of Tregs in spleen and thymus. These results suggest that inflammation during late pregnancy causes an expansion of Tregs in lymphoid organs. This expansion may cause an imbalance of immune mediators involved in maternal-fetal tolerance, and this, in turn, may predispose to preterm birth.",

            "text": "Deciphering We compared phenotypic and genomic features of two clinical GBS isolates: GB37 (neonatal invasive disease) and GB590 (vaginal colonizing strain) that were identified through an unbiased macrophage phagocytosis screen (GB37 was poorly phagocytosed, GB590 was readily engulfed). METHODS: A mouse endometritis model was used to determine severity of infections and invasiveness was determined by measuring dissemination to the spleen. Macrophage phagocytosis and cytokine responses were measured in vitro, as were cytokine responses of intact maternal-fetal membranes. Biofilm production was compared in vitro. Whole genome sequencing was conducted and targeted comparisons were made involving genes implicated in pathogenesis. RESULTS: Strain GB590 was phagocytosed significantly better by human THP-1 macrophages, placental macrophages, and blood monocytes than was GB37, suggesting GB37 is able to evade innate immunity. The invasive GB37 strain was highly lethal in a mouse model of endometritis, while the colonizing GB590 strain was not. Dissemination to the spleen was greater with GB37. GB590 was a weak stimulator of macrophage cytokine responses compared with GB37. In maternal-fetal membranes, both GB37 and GB590 strongly stimulated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. GB37 formed biofilms in vitro better than did GB590, which might also be important for eventual invasion. We identified genomic differences, including a SNP in lmb in GB590, which may partially explain some phenotypic differences. CONCLUSIONS: We identified phenotypic and genomic differences between an invasive GBS strain and a vaginal colonizing strain that might be important for explaining differences in virulence in vivo. This study was funded by a grant from the Global Alliance to Prevent Prematurity and Stillbirth (GAPPS) and was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. At the end of pregnancy, myometrial cells undergo phenotypic changes, from a proliferative to a contractile state in order to initiate labor. It has been shown that leptin, an adipokine increased in obesity, inhibits in vitro uterine remodeling and contractility. This study was aimed to investigate the ability of leptin to induce myometrial cell proliferation in order to propose this adipokine as a potential tocolytic agent for threatened preterm labor. METHODS: Primary cell lines were established from myometrial biopsies obtained from women with uncomplicated pregnancies, at term, before labor onset. After 24h-adhesion and 72h-starvation, cells were stimulated by leptin (from 6.25 to 100ng/ml). Proliferation and cell cycle were assessed by studying total cell number and percentage of cell in S-phase by flow cytometry and cyclin D1 and E expression by western blotting. Signaling pathways involved were assessed by western blotting, immunofluorescence and by using pharmacological agents (U0126 and S3I-201to inhibit MEK1/2 and STAT3 respectively). Moreover, the specificity of the effect was investigated thanks to a siRNA approach. RESULTS: Leptin increased both cell number (increase vs. CTL; +47.5% and +32.9% for 6.25 and 50ng/ml respectively) and percentage of cells in S-phase (+62.1% and +37.7% vs. CTL, for 6.25 and 50ng/ml respectively) in a biphasic manner. Leptin also up-regulated cyclin D1 (ADU: 1.00 (CTL), 1.39\u00b10.15 (6.25ng/ml), 2.69\u00b10.42 (50ng/ml)) and cyclin E expression (ADU: 1.00 (CTL), 1.40\u00b10.07 (6.25ng/ml), 2.08\u00b10.58 (50ng/ ml)) after a 4h-stimulation, with higher increase for 50 than 6.25ng/ml. Moreover we showed that leptin at 6.25ng/ml induces cell proliferation through ERK1/2 signaling associated with an ERK1/2 phosphorylation at 3' and 40' (ADU: 1.00 (CTL), 2.22\u00b10.49 (3'), 1.90\u00b10.09 (40')) ; whereas, leptin at 50ng/ml induces cell proliferation through STAT3 signaling as the use of S3I-201 prevents its effect on cell number (increase vs. CTL; +68.7% and +31.1% for 50ng/ml alone or with S3I-201, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Leptin induces human myometrial cell proliferation via ERK1/2 or STAT3 signaling pathway according to the concentration used. Thus, leptin could be of interest as a tocolytic agent, by maintaining uterine quiescence and could contribute to explain parturition-related disorders observed in obese women. Dams (~10/group) were euthanized 4hrs later. Maternal plasma (MP), amniotic fluid (AF), placentas and uteri were assessed for cytokines (IL-1b,IL-12p70,IFN-g,IL-6,GRO/KC,IL-10,TNF-a) using a multiplex MSD. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc testing. RESULTS: LPS-induced inflammation in the MP, AF, uteri and placentas was not reduced by the FO-diet vs. N-diet. TNF-a levels in uteri (p<0.001) and AF (p<0.0008) were elevated in the FO+LPS vs. N+LPS groups. FO+LPS placentas had significantly higher cytokines than N+LPS placentas (p<0.05-0.0001) (Table) . CONCLUSIONS: Using a mouse model of LPS-induced PTL, the FOdiet did not protect against maternal systemic inflammation or reduce inflammation in the AF, uterus, or placentas. Surprisingly, FO was associated with significantly increased inflammation in the AF, uteri, and placenta following LPS. Studies are underway to determine the effect of the FO-diet on pregnancy duration in the LPS-PTL model. States.

We compared results of gross and fine motor skills tests at age 4 and a general neurologic evaluation at age 7 among the children of women who did and did not have puerperal infection. Associations between infection and neurologic outcomes were evaluated before and after adjusting for confounders including maternal age, race, parity, smoking, BMI, education, and income, through generalized linear models with correction of variance estimates for clustering. RESULTS: Of the term children eligible for analysis, 29,576 had gross and fine motor skills testing at age 4 and 31,076 had a neurologic examination at age 7. After adjusting for confounders, the children of women with puerperal infection were more likely to have abnormal gross and fine motor skills evaluations with adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of 1.3 (95% CI 1.0, 1.6) and 1.2 (95% CI 1.0, 1.4), respectively. Children of women with puerperal infection were more likely to have an abnormal neurologic examination at age 7 compared with women without infection, aOR 1.3 (95% CI 1.1, 1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal infection is associated with an increased risk of persistent motor deficits among children born at term. Given the frequency of term deliveries complicated by intrapartum infection, this may contribute to the burden of pediatric neurologic injury. Integrins may serve as biosensors of mechanical stretch in the pregnant human myometrium and their expression and/or downstream signaling pathway activation may play a role in the onset of uterine contraction. We hypothesize myometrial events that enhance uterine contractility occur prematurely in some cases of preterm labor and, specifically, aberrations in integrin expression or downstream signaling proteins might contribute to some cases of preterm labor. METHODS: Human myometrial biopsies were obtained with written informed consent from women undergoing hysterectomy or Cesarean section, either term in labor, term not in labor, preterm in labor, or preterm not in labor. Tissues were transported to the laboratory in cold physiological buffer, dissected to isolate smooth muscle, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 o C.

PCR data was analyzed using the online SABiosciences RT\u00b2 Profiler\u2122 PCR Array Data Analysis program. Myometrial protein was extracted and subjected to semiquantitative western blotting.

            "text": "The non-specific inhibitor of conventional PKC (cPKC) UCN-1 diminished pRLC to 60% of resting levels but had no effect on ppRLC. In contrast, the selective inhibitor for PKCz significantly diminished basal ppRLC to 55% but had no effect on pRLC. OT treatment increased pRLC and ppRLC (2.37 \u00b1 0.7, and 1.91 \u00b1 0.1 fold of basal, respectively ). UCN-1 diminished OT-induced ppRLC (191 \u00b1 7.6% to 117 \u00b1 5.5%). A PKCe inhibitor blocked OT-induced pRLC (178 \u00b1 22.7% to 127 \u00b1 9.6%) but had no effect on ppRLC. PMA treatment increased resting levels of pRLC and ppRLC to 129 \u00b1 5.8% and 167 \u00b1 12.7%, respectively. UCN-1 inhibited the PMA-induced increase of ppRLC. The selective PKCz inhibitor has no effect on either OT-or PMA-induced phosphorylation of pRLC. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest diverse roles for PKC isoforms in contractile function of hUM. cPKC isoforms regulate basal pRLC as well as OT-and PMA-induced ppRLC. PKCz regulates basal ppRLC. These effects would be compatible with the conclusion that effects of PKC isoforms target the MLCP pathway. The ROK inhibitor g-H1152 (g-H) decreases oxytocin (OT)-induced uterine contractility and has been proposed as a method to arrest or prevent preterm labor. Because of concerns about vascular side effects, we studied the effects of g-H on paired samples of uterine strips (US) and small resistance vessels (~ 250 mm) (mesenteric artery (MA) and uterine artery (UA)) from non-pregnant (NP; n = 5), and late pregnant (LP; n = 6, gestational day 17-21) rats. METHODS: Vascular studies were performed using wire myography and uterine myography using a Myobath-4 apparatus. Vessels were pre-constricted with phenylephrine (PE; 3 \u00b5M) or ET (10 nM) and US were pre-contracted with OT (5 nM) or endothelin-1 (ET; 10 nM). Concentration response curves (CRC) were obtained for g-H (300 nM to 3 mM for vessels; 30 nM to 3 mM for US) to determine sensitivity (IC 50 values) and effects on maximal response. Data were analysed using ANOVA and a significant difference was considered if P \u2264 0.05. RESULTS: All three pre-constricted tissues demonstrated g-H-induced relaxation. The sensitivity (IC 50 ) to g-H was significantly reduced from NP to LP in both vessels (MA from 0.09 \u00b1 0.01 to 0.25 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b5M and UA from 0.27 \u00b1 0.06 to 1.02 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5M,) but did not change in US. In the LP groups, there were no significant differences in the sensitivities to g-H among the three tissues. The maximal agonist-induced tension was significantly reduced by g-H in all three tissues (MA to 32.6 \u00b1 11%; UA to 14.1 \u00b1 0.4%; and US to 26.4 \u00b1 9.2%) but there was no difference among tissues. In all tissues, western blotting indicated that g-H treatment caused a decrease in phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) at S19, of myosin binding subunit of MLC phosphatase at T853 and of protein kinase C-potentiated inhibitor of phosphatase-1 (CPI-17) at T38. These data demonstrate that inhibition of ROK diminishes activity of several key inhibitory enzymes, which results in an increase in MLC phosphatase activity and reduced myocyte contractility in vascular and uterine tissues.",

If ROK inhibitors are used as tocolytics, it will be essential to monitor closely for cardiovascular side effects. Preterm premature rupture of the membranes (pPROM) is a major cause of preterm birth and affects 2% of women worldwide. Factors such as uterine strecth, blood and infection appear to weaken the amniotic membrane (AM) due to a loss in biomechanical properties and tissue remodelling. These factors increase production of catabolic mediators such as PGE 2 and breakdown the fibre network. This study investigated the influence of fibre orientation on the mechanical properties of the AM and the effect of cyclical tensile strain (CTS) on PGE 2 release and whether the catabolic environment reduced connective tissue production within the AM. METHODS: AM were collected from women undergoing elective term Caesarean section delivery at University College London Hospital. AM from the cervix (CAM) and placental regions (PAM) were stained with India ink to identify fibre orientation. AM specimens (25 x 10mm) were subjected to a strain rate of 0.25 mm/s and loaded to failure (Bionix 100, MTS). In separate experiments, AM samples were subjected to CTS regimens, designed to mimic labour, and compared to unstrained controls (Bose Enduratec, UK). Samples were then analysed by routine biochemical assay for GAG, DNA, collagen and elastin. PGE 2 release was quantified in media samples. RESULTS: Differences were observed in the mechanical properties for CAM and PAM. The tangent modulus (TM) was significantly lower for CAM (4.9 MPa) when compared to PAM (7.5 MPa). Mechanical resistance to strain was found to be dependent on fibre orientation such that AM with fibres orientated parallel to the direction of applied strain showed greater TM and strain (e) to failure (#) values compared to fibres orientated in the perpendicular direction. Using an ex vivo bioreactor approach, human AM subjected to 2% CTS augmented PGE 2 release and GAG levels in PAM and CAM samples (p<0.001). In contrast, collagen and elastin content were significantly reduced in PAM and CAM (p<0.001).",

For example members of Bacillaceae were associated with weight and this relationship strengthened with gestational age. Further, weight gain in trimesters 1 and 2, but not 3, was associated with the microbiome. Bacterial abundance was driven by diet; differences were primarily in HF mothers and were significantly associated with leptin levels. Distinct taxa were significantly associated with leptin. For example members of Xanthomonadaceae negatively correlated and Sphingomonadaceae positively correlated with leptin. CONCLUSIONS: Altered nutrition is a permissive factor in modifying metabolism and the microbiome in pregnancy. Yet it remains to be determined if leptin influences the microbiome or vice versa. Either way, given the importance of both the microbiota and leptin in metabolic programming, this relationship may precipitate adaptations with profound effects on maternal and fetal health.",

The gut microbiota and immune system interact to influence host response to infection and nutrient availability. Nutrition can alter immune function, and inflammation has been associated with the pathogenesis of obesity. However, little is known about the link between nutrition, the microbiome and the immune system during pregnancy. This study investigated the relationship between the gut microbiota and immune status in pregnancy and if this was influenced by maternal nutrition. METHODS: Female mice (n=5/grp) were fed a control diet during pregnancy, or a 30% calorie reduced diet from day (d)5.5-18.5 of pregnancy, or a 60% high fat diet from 8 weeks before mating and during pregnancy. At d18.5 (term=19d) DNA was isolated from maternal caecal contents and cytokines were measured in plasma and small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (SI IEL). 16S rRNA genes were amplified using degenerate primers, hybridised to the G3 PhyloChip TM and scanned using GeneArray\u00ae (Affymetrix). Microbial sequences were filtered and analysed using PhyCA-Stats TM software to determine bacterial abundance scores. Associations between the microbiome and inflammatory markers (Adonis test; p<0.05) and between individual taxa and cytokine levels (Spearman; q<0.05) were determined. RESULTS: 599 of 836 taxa had significant abundance differences between dietary groups. Structure of the microbial community was associated with an altered inflammatory cytokine signature in plasma: Mothers with different microbiomes had dissimilar levels of plasma TNFa, IL-17, IL-1a, IL-12(p70), MIP-1a and RANTES. Moreover, microbial community structure was associated with differences in the signature of cytokines (IL-1b, IFNg, IL-12(p70), IL-2, MCP-1, MIP-1a, eotaxin and GM-CSF) produced by SI IEL. Significant relationships between distinctive taxa and levels of specific cytokines emerged. For example, members of Pseudomonadaceae were correlated with plasma cytokines and members of Corynebacteriaceae were correlated with SI IEL cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: These novel data are consistent with a model in which diet restructures the microbial community and microbiota influence locally resident immune cells, which in turn affects the peripheral immune system. We suggest that microbiota influence maternal health and adaptation to pregnancy through effects on immune function and nutrient metabolism. Such adaptations will also impact fetal development. Recent studies describe the differential expression of miRNAs in chorioamniotic membranes with advancing gestation or histological evidence of chorioamnionitis, and also in the human cervix following term labour. The aim of this study was to identify labour associated microRNAs in the myometrium at term. METHODS: MicroRNA extracted from myometrial biopsies collected before (n=9) and after the onset of labour (n=9) was analysed using the miRCURY TM LNA array. Multivariate modelling was used to examine phenotype related variability in microRNA expression. miRCURY LNA TM RT-PCR was used to technically and then biologically validate the findings in an independent population (n=9, each group). Putative target genes were identified using web-based predictive algorithms and cross-referenced with genes shown to be down-regulated in labouring myometrium. Studies examining expression levels of target microRNAs were conducted using primary human myometrial cell cultures as well as monocytes and lymphocytes isolated from pregnant women. RESULTS: 441 microRNAs were detected in all samples. Multivariate analysis described clear separation of the two populations, demonstrating a characteristic microRNA expression profile of labouring and nonlabouring myometrium. The onset of labour was consistent with reduced expression of specific microRNAs including hsa-miR-876, hsa-miR-873, hsa-miR-29c, hsa-miR-3653, hsa-miR-29b and hsa-miR-200c as well as increased levels of hsa-miR-3687 and hsa-miR-223. These results were technically validated using RT-PCR. Hsa-miR-223 was found to be significantly increased in further biological validation. Expression of hsa-miR-223 was not detected in cultured myocytes, but was present in monocytes and neutrophils known to significantly infiltrate the uterus during parturition.",

INTRODUCTION: Ultrasound (USS) indicated cervical cerclage is commonly used to prevent or delay preterm delivery (PTD) in women found to have a shortened cervix. The efficacy of USS indicated cerclage compared with conservative management has been assessed with mixed results. The variability in outcomes may be secondary to differences in cerclage position within the cervix. We sought to examine outcomes in women undergoing USS indicated cerclage relative to the position of the suture within the cervix.",

USS-indicated cerclage was defined as suture insertion with a cervical length <25 mm and a closed external os. The cohort was divided according to cerclage distance (mm) from the external os or height as a percentage of total cervical length (CL), at first USS after suture insertion. RR of preterm delivery (PTD) prior to 37 weeks was calculated. RESULTS: 130 women underwent USS-indicated cerclage at a median gestation of 18 weeks (range 13-25 weeks). 54(41%) women delivered prior to 37 weeks gestation. When cerclages were placed <20mm from the external os the risk of PTD was increased; RR1.15 (95%CI 1.03-1.29, p=0.027) and when more distal this risk was increased further: <15mm RR1.58 (95%CI 1.20-2.08, p=0.0014) and <10mm RR1.94 (95%CI 1.0-3.51, p=0.027). When cerclages were placed in the distal 50% of the total CL, risk of PTD also increased; RR2.07 (95%CI 1.30-3.3, p=0.0017). Most women (87%) exhibited cervical lengthening at the first post-stitch USS (median 10mm, range 1-30mm). Women who had a static or further shortening CL were more likely to deliver preterm; RR 2.58 (95%CI 1.02-6.55, p=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest reported cohort of USS-indicated cerclages and shows the higher a stitch is placed, the lower the subsequent risk of preterm delivery. Improved outcomes in higher placed sutures may reflect the longer CLs in this subgroup, however risk of PTD was also increased when stitches were placed in the distal half of the cervix, regardless of total CL. Women whose cervices fail to elongate or shorten following cerclage should remain under close surveillance as this group is most at risk of PTD. The switch from a quiescent phenotype to a contractile state during pregnancy likely involves the integration of multiple signaling networks generated from both hormonal and mechanical signals. Identifying how these networks change and interact is crucial to understanding the biochemical processes involved in the induction of labor.

The cervix consists mostly of extracellular matrix with an abundance of collagen. We hypothesize that collagen expression, as well as content and structure are reduced in the cervix of women with preterm cervical ripening compared to that at term. We aimed to investigate possible differences in collagen gene and protein expression between PTL and term labor (TL). METHODS: Cervical biopsies were obtained from 62 women, PTL (N=19), TL (17), preterm not in labor, PTnotL (N=6), term not in labor, TnotL (N=16) and non-pregnant (N=4). Real time RT-PCR was performed to analyze gene expression of collagen I and III. Hydroxyproline concentration was measured to estimate collagen concentration in the cervix. The cell nuclei/area (methyl green stained) and optical density (picrosirius red dye) was used to assess collagen content and structure in cervix sections. RESULTS: Groups in labor both at preterm (PTL) and term (TL) had significantly lower mRNA expression than the groups not in labor (PTnotL and TnotL). There was a tendency towards higher mRNA expression of collagen I and III in PTL group compared to TL. Higher hydroxyproline concentration was measured in PTnotL group compared to PTL, TL, and TnotL. There was no difference in hydroxyproline concentration between PTL and TL. Cell nuclei density, as well as collagen content and structure were reduced in the TnotL compared to NP women, though extracellular collagen was not different from other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Aspects of the remodel process in the cervix in women that delivered preterm may be similar to that at term. Whether degradation of extracellular collagen in the cervix is advanced with preterm birth requires further study. During the last decade we have been working on the role of EG-VEGF, a new placental cytokine, and showed its importance in the placenta during the first trimester of human pregnancy. EG-VEGF is also called Prokineticin 1 in relation to its effects on contractility. However, to date no data is available in regards to its expression and role in the human fetal membranes (FMs), near parturition. Here we investigated the expression and role of EG-VEGF and its two receptors PROKR1 and PROKR2 in the mechanism of parturition towards the term of the human pregnancy. METHODS: Total fetal membranes, chorion, amnion and sera were collected at different gestational ages. Immunohistochemistry, Western Blots, qPCR and ELISAs were used to determine the localization and expression of EG-VEGF and its receptors during the third trimester of pregnancy. Primary chorion trophoblasts were isolated and used to determine the effect of EG-VEGF on metalloproteases (MMP2 and MMP9) activities and on PGDH, PROKR1 and PROKR2 expression. RESULTS: EG-VEGF and its receptors were found in the FMs and their expression increased towards term. The circulating levels of EG-VEGF increased towards term compared to preterm. More importantly, the production of EG-VEGF was higher in the FMs compared to the age matched control placenta . The treatment of chorion trophoblast cells with EG-VEGF (10-50ng/ml) lead to a decrease in the MMPs activities, as well as to a decrease of EG-VEGF receptors. In contrast EG-VEGF significantly increased PGDH expression. These data demonstrate that EG-VEGF is a new FMs cytokine that acts locally to maintain a quiescence of the uterine tissues during the third trimester of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, EG-VEGF and its receptors are shown to be expressed in the human FMs. We propose that this tissue is an important source of local EG-VEGF, and that the system EG-VEGF/ PROKR1 and PROKR2 might ensure fine regulations of the parturition process near term. Labour is associated with inflammatory changes both in the myometrium and systemically that include an increase in neutrophil and monocyte numbers. The mechanisms regulating such altered leucocyte dynamics are not well understood but may be critical in identifying novel targets for the prevention of preterm birth. We investigated local and systemic leucocyte trafficking prior to and at labour, comparing with myometrial chemo-attractant and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. METHODS: Myometrium, blood, lungs, and placental tissue were collected on gestation days 16, 17, 18 and during spontaneous labour of the CD1 mouse pregnancy. Samples were analysed using flow cytometry to determine neutrophil, resident macrophage and monocyte Ly-6C high subset numbers and expression of COX-2 and CD86 on myometrial macrophages. Chemokine and cytokine mRNA and protein levels in the myometrial samples were measured using RT-PCR and multiplex assay. RESULTS: Neutrophil, macrophage and Ly-6C high monocyte numbers in the myometrium increased daily and peaked on day 18. However, in labouring myometrium, densities of macrophages and Ly-6C high monocytes were reduced substantially compared to E18 (p<0.001 and p<0.01 respectively). Expression of COX-2 on myometrial macrophages peaked prior to labour on day 18 but reduced significantly during labour (p=0.01), while CD86 reached a peak on E17. In contrast to these labour-associated reductions, myometrial mRNA levels of chemokines and inflammatory cytokines (CCL2, CXCL1, CCL5, IL-1b, TNFa and IL6) were highest at labour. Systemically, neutrophils and Ly-6C high monocytes in the blood and lung microvasculature showed maximal densities on E17 or E18. As with the labouring myometrium, densities of Ly-6C high monocytes in the blood and lungs decreased significantly during labour. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in myometrial myeloid cells and their activation state prior to labour were followed by their abrupt reduction during labour. However, this pattern was not mirrored by chemokine and cytokine mRNA and protein levels in the myometrium, suggesting alternative mechanisms control leucocyte behaviour and phenotype during parturition. Similar kinetics in the circulating and lung populations to those in the myometrium may indicate a common or linked regulatory pathway. (-) decidual natural killer (dNK) cells. The latter promote trophoblastic remodeling of spiral arteries, but also express high levels of latent cytototoxic molecules whose rapid activation can combat infectious microbes. We found that IP-10 can recruit CXCR3 expressing circulating CD56 bright /CD16 (-) NK cells to the decidua. Hypothesizing that in early pregnancy viruses can alter subsequent maternal inflammatory responses; we primed cultured DCs with agonists of toll like receptors (TLRs) that mediate specific viral infections, which has been shown to be associated with low birth weight. The effects of this priming were then assessed on expression of IP-10 induced by subsequent incubation of the DCs with cytokines.

Conditioned DM supernatants were assessed by ELISA for IP-10. Comparisons between groups utilized mean\u00b1 SEM and one way ANOVA (n=3).",

Blocking such augmentation by pretreatment with imiquimod, a TLR-7 agonist that mimics HIV or CPG ODN, a TLR-9 agonist that mimics Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2, suggests a mechanism by which viral infections may inhibit peripheral NK cell recruitment to the decidua and may contribute to low birth weight pregnancies. The initiation of both term and preterm labour is widely accepted to be an inflammatory event. Pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by invading innate immune cells bring about a NF-kB-dependent increase in contraction-associated protein expression, hence precipitating labour. The aim of this study was to further elucidate the pathways leading up to a non-infective process of preterm labour, induced by the progesterone receptor (PR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, RU486. METHODS: Pregnant CD1 mice were administered an intraperitoneal injection of 150mg RU486 on gestational day 16. Gestational day 16 and day 17 CD1 mice were used as controls. Myometrium from the experimental arm was harvested at 4.5 hours, 9 hours and 13.5 hours post-RU486, and after delivery of the first pup, which occurred approximately 18 hours post-injection. Left myometrial horns were disrupted by using bead homogenization in a Precellys machine (Stretton Scientific Limited, Stretton, UK). Total RNA was extracted and converted to cDNA. Quantitative real time PCR for IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, TNFa, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, CCL20, CXCL5, IL-4, IFNg, GCSF and GAPDH were performed using a Rotor-Gene (Qiagen Limited, Manchester, UK). Protein was extracted and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting for the contraction-associated proteins, phosphorylated MAPKs and the relevant transcription factors. RESULTS: At the level of gene expression, IL-1b (p<0.001), IL-6 (p<0.01) and CXCL5 (p<0.001) rose significantly post-RU486 injection versus gestational day 16 controls with the onset of labour. Other proinflammatory cytokine levels did not vary significantly. Connexin-43 (p<0.01) and oxytocin receptor (p<0.05) proteins rose significantly at 9 hours post-RU486 injection versus gestational day 16 controls. Phospho-p38 (p<0.05) and phospho-p65 (p<0.05) protein levels also rose significantly at the same time point. COX-2 protein levels showed a trend towards decreasing. CONCLUSIONS: PR/GR inhibition leads to a phospho-p38-and phospho-p65-dependent increase in certain contraction-associated proteins, which is sufficient in precipitating preterm labour in mice. Additionally, stimulation of the inflammatory cascade appears to be a late event in RU486-induced preterm labour. Collectively these findings indicate that inflammation may not be such a key player in the initiation of labour in this model.",

Hypoxia, which is common in FGR fetuses, has been shown to increase the phosphorylation of IGFBP-1, however the underlying mechanism is not known. We tested the hypothesis that IGFBP-1 hyperphosphorylation in hypoxia is caused by inhibition of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1). METHODS: Using HepG2 cells, we inhibited mTORC1+C2 signaling either using mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (100nM, 24 hrs), or transfecting cells with combined siRNA targeting raptor+rictor. Further, we activated mTORC1+C2 by transfecting cells with siRNA targeting the endogenous mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR and activated mTORC1 targeting TSC2 (scrambled siRNA as control). Silencing was performed for 72 hours with the last 24 hrs either in 1% or 20% O 2 . Silencing of target proteins and inhibition/activation of mTORC1+C2 activity were confirmed using Western blotting. IGFBP-1 secretion and phosphorylation were assessed in cell media using phospho-site (pS101, 119 and 169) specific IGFBP-1 antibodies. RESULTS: Hypoxia resulted in decreased mTORC1 (p4E-BP1 Thr70 , -51%) but not mTORC2 (pAkt Ser473 ) activity, and induced IGFBP-1 secretion (+56%) and phosphorylation (+102%). Combined hypoxia+rapamycin inhibited mTORC1 (p4E-BP1 Thr70 , -50%) and mTORC2 (pAkt Ser473 , -55%) activity, and induced IGFBP-1 secretion (+74%) and phosphorylation (+109%) to similar levels as hypoxia alone. Similarly, in cells in which mTORC1 and mTORC2 were inhibited following silencing of raptor (mTORC1) and rictor (mTORC2) IGFBP-1 secretion and phosphorylation were induced to the same extent in normoxia and hypoxia (n=3). DEPTOR silencing increased mTORC1 (p4E-BP1 Thr70 , +88%) but did not influence mTORC2 activity and inhibited IGFBP-1 secretion (-30%) and phosphorylation (-50%). Importantly, hypoxia failed to induce IGFBP-1 secretion and phosphorylation in DEPTOR silenced cells. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of mTORC1 constitutes a mechanistic link between hypoxia and increased IGFBP-1 secretion and phosphorylation. This study provides novel insights into mechanisms modulating IGF-I bioavailability and potentially fetal growth under hypoxic conditions. analyzed on d20 of pregnancy given their delayed onset of parturition. Chicago Blue Dye was used to observe the timing of embryo implantation. Intact uteri as well as individual implantation sites (IS) weights were recorded. On d15, d19 and d20, uterine-fetal weights (including the uterus, amniotic fluid, pup and placenta) as well as uterine and individual placental or pup weights were recorded. A calcium (Ca2 + ) assay was used to compare oxytocin (OT)-induced intracellular-Ca2 + release in primary uterine myometrial (UT-Myo) cells from Cox-1KO and WT mice. In addition, spontaneous and OT (10 -11 -10 -6 M)-induced contractile activity was compared using longitudinal myometrial strips. At least N=4 litters per genotype per gestational day were analyzed, using t-tests to determine significant (p<0.05) differences between Cox-1KO and WT. RESULTS: Cox-1KO females had normal timing of embryo implantation based on similar IS weight and number observed on d5 and d6 of pregnancy compared to WT females. A slight (but significant, p<0.05) decrease in Cox-1KO pup weight was noted on d15 and d19 of pregnancy, but was not accompanied by differences in total intact uterine-fetal weight, placental or uterine weight alone. Finally, we observed no difference in OT-induced intracellular-Ca2 + release in UT-Myo cells from Cox-1KO and WT mice, nor spontaneous and OT-induced uterine isometric contractility (amplitude, frequency and AUC/sec) between Cox-1KO and WT females on day15 and 19 of pregnancy, nor between d20 Cox-1KO and d19WT. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the delayed parturition phenotype observed in Cox-1KO mice is not due to mistiming of embryo implantation or impaired uterine contractions.",

Group 1 consisted of 7 patients with 20 patients in Group 2. The two groups were similar in the selected demographic characteristics such as age, ethnicity, parity, history of previous preterm delivery, and cervical length at the time of diagnosis of short cervix. However, gestational age at the time of diagnosis of short cervical length was less in Group 1. Gestational age at time of delivery was significantly decreased in Group 1 with mean gestational age of 26.96 weeks versus 31.36 weeks in Group 2 (P<0.05). No other statistically significant obstetric or neonatal outcomes differences were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Cerclage placement in triplet pregnancies complicated by a short cervix does not prevent preterm birth, and may be associated with a significantly decreased gestational age at the time of delivery compared to the patients who did not undergo cerclage placement. Although, the difference in outcomes may reflect only the early gestational age of cervical shortening and not the fact cerclage was placed. Our results should be interpreted with caution. Umbilical cord blood gases measurement are the most direct method to rule out fetal metabolic acidosis with a medicolegal importance, and unfortunately they are measured after the delivery. Management of the second stage of labor can be difficult including decisions regarding intervention after a prolonged second stage. Although most studies have shown that perinatal outcomes are not compromised with a prolonged second stage of labor, there is always the concern of the potential benefit of cesarean delivery in specific cases. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was done. The patient population included pregnancies presenting with prolonged second stage of labor. The exposed group consisted of cases with a cesarean delivery after a prolonged second stage, and the unexposed group consisted of cases with a vaginal delivery after a prolonged second stage. Analyses were performed to compare demographics, umbilical blood pH and base deficit in both groups.",

Umbilical blood pH was increased significantly in the group exposed to the cesarean delivery (p<0.05). Gestational age, neonate birth weight and umbilical cord blood base deficit were not found to be significantly different between the exposed and unexposed group. CONCLUSIONS: Cesarean delivery after a prolonged second stage of labor is associated with higher umbilical cord blood pH than vaginal delivery, and this finding should be considered. However decisions regarding intervention such as cesarean delivery must be individualized. The analysis of the results of the 19 patients at 'high risk', also, showed significant changes in OEA (p=0.057) levels both in an 11-week RTDI, and with 10-week intervals (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: OfFN has a limited value in predicting PTB in asymptomatic high-risk women, while IGFBP-1 shows an insignificant contribution. Even though the IGFBP-1 kit costs the NHS \u226420-30, ofFN kits are universally 4 times more expensive. Mass Spectrometry Analysis of one sample costs the NHS only \u226420-30. These data are very promising, indicating that a conservative 8 week period and a more variable 10 week period can be provided for the preparation of primary prevention, with plasma OEA, in particular, in seemingly a good predictor of the RTDI in asymptomatic women. analysed by UHPLC-tandem mass spectrometry and the pregnancy outcomes categorised into term and preterm delivery (>37 and <37 completed gestational weeks, respectively). Women also had cervical IGFBP-1 (threatened PTB group) and/or ultrasound cervical length (CL) (high risk clinic group) measurements. Plasma ECB levels were analysed individually and ROC analyses undertaken to determine specificity, sensitivity, NPV and PPV values. These were compared to values obtained for cervical IGFBP-1 and CL (<25mm). RESULTS: Plasma AEA levels were significantly (p=0.025; Student's t-test) higher in women who delivered prematurely (0.6\u00b1 0.38nM) than in those at term (0.4 \u00b1 0.24nM), whilst OEA and PEA levels were not significantly different. ROC analyses of plasma AEA values indicated a sensitivity of 66.67% and specificity of 69.70%, with a PPV of 47% and NPV of 21%. Cervical IGFBP-1 gave a sensitivity of 54%, specificity of 64%, PPV of 37% and NPV of 78%, whilst the specificity for the CL measurements was 77% and the NPV 89%. Both the sensitivity and PPV were 0%. There were no correlations (Spearman) between cervical IGFBP-1 measurements or CL and plasma AEA levels. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that plasma AEA is a better predictor of PTB than cervical IGFBP-1 and CL measurements, however, the numbers tested (n=51) are relatively small and our results will need to be confirmed in larger trials. Furthermore, the actual role of plasma AEA in the aetiolopathology of PTB requires further examination.",

Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between women with CHD and those with acquired cardiac disease (ACD) (valvular, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias) , and between women with simple & complex CHD. Prenatal genetic referral was assessed. Statistical comparisons were made using univariate analyses; p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: From 143 women, 86 had CHD; 41(48%) simple; 45(52%) complex.CHD were significantly more likely to undergo an operative vaginal delivery (OVD) (28% vs. 14%, p=0.05) & have more chorioamnionitis (9% vs. 0%, p=0.02) when compared to ACD. Complications: preeclampsia, GDM, postpartum hemorrhage, abruption, PTD, prolonged hospital stay, & need for ICU admission were not significantly different. Neonatal outcomes: gestational age at delivery, birth weight, rates of 5 minute Apgar scores <7, & NICU admission were similar. When women with simple CHD were compared to complex CHD, vaginal delivery rates (76% vs. 68% p=0.45) & OVD rates (24% vs. 29%, p=0.79) were similar. When we assessed the pattern of referral for prenatal genetic, 45 % (39) CHD women were not referred. Of those referred, only half (51 %) were referred for the proper indication -CHD. Fetal Echo where done in late gestation in 31.9 %. None of the patients had invasive prenatal diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: CHD pregnancies are more likely to undergo OVD, and similar perinatal outcomes , regardless the baseline cardiac anomaly. Our multidisciplinary approach to coordinate care for cardiac patients might have favorably modified outcomes. However,there was a lack of primary provider's awareness and patient acceptance regarding CHD and the potential risk to herself and her unborn child.Therefore, education and active pattern of referral for genetic evaluation in women CHD needs to be encouraged. Maternal obesity is increasing in most countries and is associated with increased perinatal risks. These risks further increase if obese women gain more than recommended by the institute of medicine (IOM). Studies about effects of gestational weight loss (GWL) in obese women and pregnancy outcomes are starting to emerge. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to examine the effect of gestational weight loss in obese pregnant women on pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: We performed a thorough search in PUBMED, CINAHL and EMBASE with the keywords 'obesity', 'pregnancy', 'pregnancy outcomes', 'weight loss', 'weight gain' and 'weight reduction'. The quality of the articles that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed by the quality check of the Cochrane guideline from 2008. RESULTS: The first literature search produced 175 citations and based on predefined eligibility criteria, 152 were excluded. The remaining 23 articles were read in full text. Additionally, 9 articles were identified by the snowball method. Finally, 14 studies were selected for quality assessment. Thirteen were cohort studies and 1 was a randomized controlled trial. The sample size of included studies ranged from 841 to 709 575 singleton pregnancies. All studies show that GWL in obese women is associated with more small-for-gestational-age (SGA) babies, but less large-for-gestational-age (LGA) babies, and less caesarean section. More specifically, in obese from class I, GWL is associated with more SGA and less caesarean section; for those from class II and III with GWL, less LGA-infants are reported; and obese from class III with GWL showed less gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Because of the wide variety of results in the various studies, further in depth investigation is needed. CONCLUSIONS: GWL in obese women reduces the risk of elective caesarean and LGA-infants at the expense of an increase in SGA infants. The effects differ across different classes of BMI and therefore more epidemiological data are required to provide updated guidelines.",

Women who underwent at least one CD (exposed) were identified from the Utah Population Database (UPDB) by birth certificate data and discharge diagnosis codes and compared to women with vaginal delivery only (unexposed). The outcome was defined as (1) dilation and curettage for SAb following a given live birth or (2) the time to SAb as identified by ICD9 and CPT codes from statewide Ambulatory Surgery and Inpatient Discharge records. Incomplete, illogical or inconsistent records were excluded. Data were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression and restricted to women at the time of their first, second or third live birth. Covariates in the models included maternal age, Hispanic ethnicity, marital status, education level, gravidity, and prior SAb. RESULTS: 260,249 women with at least one live birth were identified in the UPDB. Analysis was limited to 3 prior births. After exclusions, 255,082, 154,930, and 70,228 women were analyzed who had at least one, two, and three prior live births and 6067, 2795 and 1007 subsequent SAb identified, respectively. Results of the analysis models are shown in the table. Women with one prior CD and at least 1 or 2 live births were not at increased risk for subsequent SAb. Women with 1 of 3 or 3 of 3 prior cesareans had an odds ratio (95%CI) for subsequent SAb of 1.29 (1.04-1.6) and 1.22 (1.00-1.50), though this is not likely clinically significant. The reported prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in women with a chief complaint of pregnancy loss (PL) varies, as does the reported risk of adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies. Our objective was to assess (1) prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies meeting revised Sapporo thresholds among women presenting with a chief complaint of PL and (2) risk in subsequent pregnancies. METHODS: Retrospective cohort of patients presenting for recurrent PL from 2003-2012. Antiphospholipid antibodies were checked at providers' discretion. Patients were considered positive if at least one of the following was present: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG or IgM (\u226540U), or anti-b2 glycoprotein 1 IgG or IgM >99th percentile (>40 SU). Patient data was obtained by review of medical records. RESULTS: 338/390 (87.2%) women with a chief complaint of pregnancy loss had antiphospholipid antibodies tested. 22/338 (6.5%) tested positive for at least one antiphospholipid antibody. 2 were negative on repeat testing. 9 had isolated recurrent PL \u2264 14 weeks, 11 had PL plus history of either venous thromboembolism (VTE), delivery <34 weeks for pre-eclampsia or placental insufficiency, or fetal demise >14 weeks. Subsequent pregnancy outcomes were available for 13/20 patients (Table) . Subsequent obstetric morbidity was significantly more likely in those patients with history of VTE and SLE compared to women with recurrent PL alone (p=0.015). ",

The primary outcome was cesarean delivery. Secondary outcomes are listed in the table.

RESULTS: Prior to pregnancy, 957 women were obese class I, 508 women were obese class II, and 421 women were obese class III. During pregnancy, 60.1% of women gained more than the recommended amount of weight; only 18.7% of women gained the recommended 11-20 pounds. Women with class I obesity increased their risk of hypertensive disorders and LGA with excessive weight gain. Women with class II obesity increased their risk of cesarean delivery with excessive weight gain. Women with class III obesity increased their risk of cesarean delivery and hypertensive disorders with excessive weight gain. Less than recommended weight gain had no clear associations.

In the unadjusted analysis, compared with children of women with normal BMI, the children of overweight, obese, severely obese, and morbidly obese women had IQ scores that were lower by 2.2 (P<0.01), 2.7 (P<0.01), 2.8 (P<0.01), and 4.5 (P<0.01) points, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, the trend remained signifi cant, but the IQ defi cits were much smaller. Maternal education and income were the covariates that contributed most to this attenuating effect (table) . CONCLUSIONS: Higher maternal BMI is associated with lower offspring IQ. The confounding factors that most attenuated the association were the markers of maternal socioeconomic status (SES), primarily maternal education and income. The prevalence of obesity is four times higher now than when this cohort was followed. This question should be evaluated prospectively in a contemporary cohort that collects information about maternal IQ and SES. To examine the relationship between insulin action and insulin response in women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and gestational diabetes (GDM) in early, relative to pregravid and late pregnancy. METHODS: Insulin sensitivity was assessed using the euglycemic clamp and insulin response to an intravenous glucose challenge in 34 women. Eighteen NGT (11 lean and 7 obese) and 16 GDM (9 lean and 7 obese) were evaluated prior to pregnancy, in early (12-14 weeks) and late (34-36 weeks) gestation. The relationship between insulin action and insulin response was assessed using the disposition index (DI) and correlated with reproductive hormones, leptin and cytokines in early pregnancy. RESULTS: From pregravid through early pregnancy there was an increase in insulin response; lean NGT and GDM (p=0.002) and obese NGT and GDM (p=0.02). In lean NGT and GDM there was an increase in insulin sensitivity, pregravid through early pregnancy (p=0.005) and a trend in obese NGT and GDM (p=0.06). The DI in early pregnancy was significantly higher compared to pregravid and late pregnancy (p=0.0001). In early pregnancy plasma leptin correlated with insulin response (r=0.62, p=0.01) and insulin sensitivity (r=-0.75, p=0.0008). There was a negative correlation between TNF alpha and insulin sensitivity (r=-0.69, p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The increases in both insulin response and insulin sensitivity in early gestation are unique metabolic adaptations during pregnancy. The hyperbolic relationship between insulin response and insulin sensitivity, present prior to pregnancy and during late pregnancy, is not evident in early pregnancy for both lean and obese NGT and GDM. We speculate that the increase in insulin response is a unique manifestation of anabolic metabolism in early gestation.",

INTRODUCTION: Patients with suspected preterm labor are often transported from small hospitals to larger institutions. Patients can be transported by either ground or air ambulance. Air ambulance transport is more expensive and may not always be medically necessary. In this day of heightened awareness of health care costs, the use of an air ambulance should be re-evaluated to determine if the extra costs can be justified. We sought to determine how often patients who are transported by air ambulance for suspected preterm labor are discharged undelivered or deliver at least 24 hours after arrival to our tertiary facility.

We reviewed the patients' charts to determine if they were discharged undelivered or delivered more than 24 hours after reaching our referral center. We calculated the cost of the air ambulance transport using the Arizona Department of Health Services rate schedule which calculates the charge based on a base rate as well as a mileage charge. RESULTS: Between 1/1/11 and 12/31/11 fifty nine patients were transported to our facility by air ambulance for suspected preterm labor. Twenty six (46%) were discharged undelivered and 17 (28%) delivered more than 24 hours after arrival. The total charges for these transports were approximately $1,043,270.00. CONCLUSIONS: Patients at low risk for imminent preterm birth are being transported using air ambulances. This excessive use of air ambulances substantially increases health care costs without improving outcomes. testing is increasingly used to target women at risk of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) to determine corticosteroid administration, hospital admission and in utero transfer. We sought to compare the management of women at risk of sPTB with and without the use of qualitative fetal fibronectin (fFN) in a tertiary referral centre in both high-risk asymptomatic women attending a preterm surveillance clinic (PSC) and on the antenatal day unit.

INTRODUCTION: To compare outcomes among vigorous neonates (5 minute Apgar score \u22657) with acidemia (arterial cord pH \u2264 7) at birth to vigorous neonates without acidemia (arterial cord pH \u22657.1). METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed using the Medstar PeriBirth labor database. Universal cord gas analysis was adopted at Medstar Washington Hospital Center in 2009. All singleton term deliveries between 37.0-42.0 with arterial cord pH \u22647.0 and 5-minute Apgar score \u22657 from 2010-2012 (Cases, n=170) were matched using controls with arterial cord pH \u22657.1 and 5-minute Apgar score \u22657 (Controls, n=170). Neonatal outcomes were examined. Two-sample t-test with normality assumption and chi-squre tests was used for analysis. Statistical significance was defined as p\u22640.05. RESULTS: Of 4,107 term, singleton deliveries in which cord blood gas analysis was available, 170 vigorous, acidemic neonates were delivered (incidence of 4.1%). No significant differences obstetric or medical risk factors were identified between the 2 groups. Cases and controls did not differ in the NICHD category of fetal heart tracing (p = 0.54). Cases were more likely to be delivered by emergent cesarean section (25.5% vs 14.7%, p=0.004). Case neonates had an increased NICU admission (OR 2.68 95% CI 1.6-4.5). INTRODUCTION: Gestational weight gain has been shown to be influenced by early second trimester maternal insulin concentration, with high insulin concentration resulting in excessive weight gain. The association of insulin and weight gain may differ by body mass index (BMI). The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of early gestational weight gain (GWG) on second trimester insulin resistance (IR) and IR on late GWG and whether these are influenced by baseline BMI in non-diabetic women.",

Importantly, in 30 women we were able to identify the ruptured sac by ultrasound examination demonstrating oligohydramnion. In these 30 cases, we compared neonatal outcome among fetuses in the ruptured sac and those that were in the intact membranes sac. RESULTS: The median gestational age was 31 weeks (range 28-33) with median latency between PPROM and delivery of 9 days (IQR 1-18).

Maternal liver and adipose tissue samples were collected at four hourly time points across day 15 and 21 of gestation. Expression of core clock genes was analysed in these tissues by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Obesity reduced mesor CBT during pregnancy (0.18\u00b0C; P<0.01) but did not affect amplitude or acrophase of the temperature rhythm. There was a significant interaction (P<0.02) between diet and pregnancy stage, such that the pre-partum decline in CBT (typically observed in rats) commenced by day 16 in both groups, but was smaller in CAF animals such that CBT values converged in the CON and CAF mothers near term. Preliminary gene expression analysis at 12pm showed hepatic expression of Bmal1 was decreased (43%; P<0.05) while Per2, Per3 and Reverb\u03b1 were all increased (57%, 64%, 43%; P<0.05) in the CAF group. In contrast, the CAF diet had no effect on clock gene expression in adipose tissue at 12pm. CONCLUSIONS: Diet-induced obesity altered maternal CBT regulation throughout pregnancy without affecting temperature rhythmicity. Hepatic, but not adipose, clock gene expression was also affected by the CAF diet at 12pm. This indicates that obesity disturbs the circadian molecular machinery in a tissue-specific manner. Further analyses across all circadian time points are needed to define the full impact of maternal obesity on the circadian profile of hepatic and adipose clock genes. ",

Subjects with uterine contractions and either cervical dilatation >/= 1cm, effacement >/= 50%, cervical length < 30 mm, or a positive fetal fibronectin test were eligible. Women with cervical dilatation of > 6 cm, multiple gestation, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, or placenta previa were excluded. The primary outcome was delivery within seven days. Odds ratios were calculated and multiple logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 100 women were enrolled and 86 had outcome data available. PAMG-1 was detected in 19/86 (22.1%) subjects and they were more likely to deliver within 7 days than those without PAMG-1 detected [6/19 (31.6%) vs. 5/67 (7.5%), OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 21.6].

Clinicians should be vigilant regarding the possibility of this complication, particularly during late labor (9+ cm dilated) or immediately postpartum in the setting of heavy vaginal bleeding and severe pain. Our objective was to examine potential predictors for perineal complications among women undergoing vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the NICHD/MFMU Network Cesarean Registry. We examined term singleton pregnancies of women undergoing VBAC and compared women with no or minor lacerations (up to second-degree) to women with severe laceration (third-or fourthdegree). Univariate regression analyses were performed and significant (p<0.1) variables were included in multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 4,075 women with VBAC were included in the analysis. SPC occurred in 17.3% cases (n=704); 82.7% had no or minor complications (n=3,371).

Stephanie Guseh, 1 Jeffrey Ecker, 2 Anjali Kaimal. 2 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Brigham and Women's Hospital; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; 2 Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Vincent Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Antenatal corticosteroid administration optimally precedes delivery by at least 2 and less than 7 days, but uncertainty in prediction of preterm delivery makes achieving this difficult. We sought to evaluate the use of betamethasone (BMZ) at a single academic institution. METHODS: Women who delivered at <34 weeks were identified, as well as women who received BMZ, but ultimately delivered at \u226534 weeks. Chi-squared statistics and multiple logistic regression were used to identify clinical and demographic factors predictive of BMZ use and preterm birth. RESULTS: 3596 women delivered at \u226524 weeks in our institution in 2012; 95 (2.6%) women delivered at <34 weeks and 83 (2.3%) women received BMZ but delivered at \u226534 weeks. Of deliveries at <34 weeks, 93 (98.0%) received at least one dose of BMZ, 69 (72.6%) were BMZ complete (BC) (delivery > 48 hrs after 1st injection, received 2 injections), and 50.5% received an optimal course (2-7 days prior to delivery). Women who were obese (aOR 2.0 [95% CI 1.03-3.9]) and who initially presented at <26 weeks (aOR 3.1 [95% CI 1.2-7.9]) were more likely to deliver at <34 weeks; there were no other significant differences between women who delivered before and after 34 weeks. Gestational age of <26 weeks at the time of BMZ was associated with a greater likelihood of being BC at the time of delivery (aOR 16.5 [95% CI 1.9-140]) and of receiving an appropriate course of BMZ (aOR 3.5 [95% CI 1.1-10.7]). CONCLUSIONS: Almost all women who delivered at <34 weeks received at least one dose of BMZ and the majority were BC. Women who presented with concern for preterm delivery at <26 weeks were more likely to deliver at <34 weeks and to receive timely and appropriate BMZ, suggesting appropriately heightened vigilance for preterm birth rather than overuse in this population. Further research is needed to identify additional factors to aid in optimizing steroid administration for those who deliver preterm and potentially to decrease excess use in women who will ultimately deliver at a later gestational age. Here, we show that chronic fetal hypoxia accelerates vascular dysfunction in adult offspring independent of shortened vascular telomere length. METHODS: Female Wistar rats were randomly divided into normoxic (N: 21% O 2 , n=13) or hypoxic (H: 14% O 2 , n=13) pregnancy from days 6-20 of gestation. This experimental model of hypoxia does not affect maternal food intake. In adult offspring (1 male per litter), femoral artery endothelial function (in vitro wire myography) and aortic telomere length (Southern blot) were investigated at 4 and 15 months. RESULTS: In offspring from normoxic pregnancy, endothelial function and telomere length declined with age ( Fig. 1) . Offspring of hypoxic pregnancy showed accelerated endothelial dysfunction without shortening of telomeres length at 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic fetal hypoxia accelerated endothelial dysfunction without accelerating vascular telomere shortening in adult life. Accelerated telomere shortening cannot provide a mechanistic link between hypoxia in utero and developmental programming of increased cardiovascular risk. Supported by the British Heart Foundation. In utero exposure to maternal smoking is associated with small infant size at birth and several studies have reported that IUGR is associated with placental loss of imprinting (LOI). We hypothesized that placentas from women exposed to first-hand tobacco smoke might also demonstrate genomic LOI patterns compared to non-smokers. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study with placentas from the Indiana University Building Blocks of Pregnancy Biobank and the Vitamin C Study for Pregnant Smokers at Oregon Health & Science University. Subjects were consented for placenta collection for research. Pregnancies with known complications were excluded. Placentas of smokers were matched by gestational age with placentas of mothers without known exposure to first-hand tobacco smoke. Tissue specimens were obtained from the placenta in a standardized manner. Novel high resolution melt (HRM) assays were used to genotype single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CD44, DLK1, H19, IGF2, MEG3, PEG3, and PEG10 genes. RNA from placentas heterozygous for the selected SNPs was further analyzed for LOI.",

Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada. INTRODUCTION: Prenatal ID (PID) during gestation has been shown to cause long-term circulatory dysfunction and increased susceptibility to metabolic derangements in the adult offspring. Here, we sought to determine whether PID would cause increased fat deposition when offspring were fed a high-fat diet. In a separate study, we also sought to determine whether prenatal treatment with resveratrol-a phytoalexin known to confer beneficial metabolic effects-would mitigate the development of obesity in adult offspring. METHODS: Female Sprague Dawley rats were fed a low-iron diet prior to (3 mg/kg Fe) and throughout (10 mg/kg Fe) gestation, and a control diet thereafter; control rats were fed the control diet throughout the entire study. At 3 wk of age, offspring from both groups were fed either a high fat \"Western Diet\" (WD; 45% fat energy), or a normal diet (ND, 16% fat energy). At 12 wk of age, offspring were instrumented with radiotelemetric transducers for continuous assessments of blood pressure. Body composition was assessed at 24 wk of age at the time of euthanasia. In a separate cohort of rats, pregnant dams from the control and iron-restricted group were treated with and without resveratrol (RESV, 4g/kg diet) throughout pregnancy. Offspring were randomized to receive the WD or ND at 3 wk of age, and assessed for metabolic outcomes at approximately 20 wk of age. RESULTS: At birth, offspring in the iron-restricted group exhibited signs of severe anemia and fetal growth restriction. All offspring fed the WD had higher body weights and had increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) accumulation compared to their ND-fed littermates, albeit these effects were exacerbated in the PID group. Blood pressure was elevated only in the PID offspring fed the WD (P<0.05), and BPs correlated with VAT weights in the PID group (P<0.05), but not in the control group. Maternal RESV treatment had no discernable adverse effect on pregnancy outcomes, and preliminary data suggest maternal resveratrol treatment during pregnancy mitigated the accumulation of VAT in the PID group (PID+WD: +26.0\u00b16.4% VAT, PID+WD+RESV: +17.8\u00b14.5%; P<0.01) but not the control group (Ctl+WD: +14\u00b18.7% VAT, Ctl+WD+RESV: +11.3\u00b14.5%) compared to their ND-fed littermates. CONCLUSIONS: PID increases the susceptibility to diet-induced obesity, and prenatal RESV treatment may be a therapeutic intervention that mitigates the programming of metabolic dysfunction caused by PID.",

INTRODUCTION: Chronic fetal hypoxia is a common condition in complicated pregnancy. We and others have reported that in rodents chronic hypoxia programmes cardiovascular disease in the adult offspring. However, relative to humans and sheep, rodents are born immature and the maternal investment in rearing a litter is different. Therefore, the relative contributions of prematurity, maternal attention and chronic fetal hypoxia in the programming mechanisms remain unclear. We have created isobaric hypoxic chambers able to maintain pregnant sheep for the duration of gestation. Here, we report that hypoxic pregnancy in sheep programmes severe hypertension and vascular dysfunction in female offspring during early adulthood and that maternal treatment with antioxidants prevents these effects. METHODS: Catheterised sheep carrying female singletons were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (10% inspired O2) \u00b1 vitamin C (maternal 200 mg.kg -1 i.v. daily) for the last third of gestation (105-138 days; term~145 days). Naturally delivered offspring were reared under normoxia until early adulthood (9 months). At this age, lambs were instrumented with catheters and a femoral Transonic flow probe. Five days later, basal cardiovascular function and the femoral constrictor responses to phenylephrine (0.25-64\u00b5g/kg i.a.) were established in vivo. Animals were euthanized, the non catheterised femoral artery excised and its endothelial function determined in vitro by wire myography. RESULTS: Maternal PaO 2 was similarly decreased during hypoxia (106\u00b12 to 47\u00b11 mmHg, P<0.05). Offspring of hypoxic pregnancy showed greater resting arterial pressure, enhanced femoral constrictor responses to phenylephrine in vivo and impaired relaxation to methacholine in vitro (Fig.1) . These effects no longer occurred in pregnancies treated with vitamin C. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic fetal hypoxia programmes significant hypertension and peripheral vascular dysfunction in female offspring at young adulthood in sheep.

Placental 11\u00dfHSD-2 protein levels were sig. increased after BET treatment in male fetuses born <37wks, but were sig. lower compared to females. In male fetuses born >37wks, no sig. differences in 11\u00dfHSD-2 protein levels were found after BET. Umbilical cord ACTH and cortisol levels in BET males were not different from controls. In females, BET treatment had no effect on maternal plasma ACTH and cortisol levels compared to controls. Placental 11\u00dfHSD-2 protein levels were sig. lower after BET treatment compared to controls in fetuses born \u226537wks. Umbilical cord ACTH plasma levels in females were sig. lower after BET treatment compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal ACTH and cortisol blood levels were lower in BET treated women pregnant with male fetuses only, indicating a sex-specific suppression of the maternal HPA-axis. In female fetuses, cord ACTH plasma levels were significantly lower. We speculate that significantly lowered 11\u00dfHSD-2 protein levels in females after BET resulted in a higher placental transfer of maternally derived cortisol to the fetus, thus suppressing female fetal adrenal cortisol production near term. Women with endometriosis exhibit a reduced endometrial sensitivity to progesterone (P), at least partially due to alterations in P receptor (PR) expression. Reduced endometrial P responsiveness compromises fertility and promotes development of experimental endometriosis in animal models. Using a murine model, we recently demonstrated that a P insensitive \"endometriosis-like uterine phenotype\" can occur as a consequence of direct or ancestral toxicant exposure. In our model, adult female mice exposed in utero to 10 ug/ kg dioxin (F1) exhibit reduced uterine PR expression and sub-fertility at sexual maturity. Additionally, while 39% of animals achieving pregnancy spontaneously deliver preterm, all pregnant F1 mice exhibit an increased sensitivity to lipopolyscaccaride-induced preterm birth. Significantly, we have also documented sub-fertility and a heightened inflammatory response in F1 males. In both sexes, these phenotypes persisted into the F2 and F3 generations. In the current study, we examined whether F1 males can transmit the endometriosis-like phenotype to his female offspring. METHODS: F1 males were maintained on standard rodent chow or fish oil supplemented chow for three weeks prior to being mated to control females. Adult female offspring were examined for uterine PR expression, fertility and pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: Female offspring of males maintained on the standard diet exhibited reduced uterine PR expression compared to offspring of unexposed controls. Following multiple mating attempts, only 37% of F2 females became pregnant and 29% of the fertile animals subsequently delivered preterm (prior to E19). In contrast, offspring of F1 males provided preconception fish oil exhibited a near normal pattern of uterine PR expression, improved fertility (79%) and 96% delivered healthy pups at term. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies indicate that the endometriosis phenotype can be inherited as a consequence of paternal toxicant exposure. Significantly, paternal preconception dietary modification protected the reproductive health of female offspring. Identification of risk factors for the development of either endometriosis or preterm birth is currently focused on the female patient. Our data suggest that her father and/or male partner may also contribute to her reproductive phenotype. Support: R01ES14942; P30 ES000267. In conjunction with disturbances in myocardial perfusion, cardiac IR is characterized by changes in glucose metabolism which may lead to alterations in cardiac function. Recent evidence suggests that IR may arise from adverse in utero environments, particularly in situations resulting in low birth-weight (LBW). In addition, the prevalent western diet (WD) is also a known contributing factor in the development of IR. However, the interactive effects of in adverse utero environment and postnatal WD on IR development are not fully understood. Our objective was to utilize non-invasive imaging techniques to identify changes in the LBW heart associated with IR development. We postulated that a postnatal WD would exacerbate the LBW cardiac IR phenotype. METHODS: The guinea pig uterine artery ablation model was used. At weaning, pups were categorized as normal birth weight (NBW) or LBW (\u226520% reduction in mean birth weight), and were placed on either a control diet (CD) or WD. At 50 and 110 days, animals underwent study with computed tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Myocardial perfusion was determined using CT Perfusion, and glucose metabolism was determined using Standardized Uptake Values (SUV) calculated from PET images. Animals were then sacrificed at day 140, and body and heart weights were recorded. RESULTS: Guinea pigs of LBW/WD demonstrated a reduction in bodyweight compared to NBW/CD over the 140 day period. However, relative heart weights were not altered between each group. At 110 days, female LBW/WD demonstrated a significant 36% reduction in myocardial perfusion and reduced SUV compared to NBW/CD animals. In contrast, male guinea pigs did not show significant reductions in myocardial perfusion or SUV. CONCLUSIONS: A LBW with WD negatively impacts upon cardiac perfusion and associated glucose metabolism. This indicates an in utero induced alteration in insulin sensitivity and cardiac function, which is observed when subjected to an adverse postnatal diet. Data also suggest a possible \"double hit\" insult and sex difference with development of cardiac IR. In conclusion, the combined LBW and WD insults lead to development of the IR phenotype in early adulthood. The epigenome may act as a biological memory explaining how an adverse intra-uterine environment can be associated with disease several decades after exposure. We sought to determine how abnormal fetal growth is associated with modifications in cytosine methylation in a single population of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells. METHODS: Cord blood was collected from 3 groups of neonates (n=20/ gp): 1)IUGR-birthweight (BW) and ponderal index (PI) <10th percentile 2)LGA-BW and PI>90th percentile 3)Con-BW and PI>10th and <90th percentile. CD34+ cells were isolated by immunomagnetic selection. For quantitative genome-wide assessment of cytosine methylation, we used the massively-parallel sequencing-based HELP Tagging. In functionally significant regions of the genome (eg promotors or enhancers), methylation status has been shown to correlate well with gene expression. However, these regions are cell type specific and not easily defined. So we generated a new genome annotation for our purified cell population using public chromatin mapping data for CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells, which enabled us to define candidate regulatory sites (enhancer/promotor) Technical (same cohort) and biological (new cohort) validation was run in 24 samples (8/group). Loci of Interest (LOI) were determined using a linear regression associated with ANOVA and two-sided Tukey-test for locus-specific difference in average methylation between groups and magnitude of methylation difference between groups mean. RESULTS: We found an over-representation of our LOI in enhancer and promotor regions compared to other features. Both IUGR and LGA showed increases in methylation compared to Con with greater sensitivity for male IUGR and female LGA. Interestingly, our LOI are targeted to genes involved in proliferation and self-renewal of stem cells, such as Notch1, DNMT3A, WNT6 (WNT pathway), DUSP4 (MAPK pathway). CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in DNA methylation observed in biologically relevant regions (enhancer/promotor) associated with abnormal fetal growth are sex-specific and may have altered replicative capacity of hematopoietic stem cells with functional implications for an aging phenotype. and fetal cytokine responses which may result in fetal central inflammatory responses. As maternal inflammation is associated with offspring cerebral palsy, cognitive limitations, and altered behavior, we postulated that fetal cytokines may impair developmental neurogenesis. The fetal hippocampus is replete with NPCs which proliferate and ultimately differentiate to neurons and astrocytes to regulate memory and neurobehavior. We determined the effect of TNFa on hippocampal NPC proliferation and neurogenesis, and investigated if TNFa effects were mediated via putative bHLH transcription factors. METHODS: Hippocampal NPCs from e20 fetal rats were cultured in complete (proliferation) and differentiating (neurogenesis) media. At day 8 of culture, NPCs were treated with TNFa (0.2, 2, 20 ng/ml) or DMSO (control) for 72h. NSC proliferation was assessed by MTT assay and protein expression (Western) of the NPC marker (nestin). Neurogenesis was assessed by expression of neuronal (Tuj1) or astrocyte (GFAP) cell markers. Mechanisms of TNFa action were explored by assay of bHLH proliferative (Hes1) and proneurogenic (Mash1) factors. RESULTS: TNFa (0.2, 2 and 20ng/ml) exhibited significant dosedependent suppression of NPC proliferation (12, 20, 25%) with proportionate reductions in nestin (0.6, 0.5, 0.4-fold). In neurogenesis studies, TNFa significantly reduced neuronal (Tuj1: 0.9, 0.8, 0.6-fold) and increased astrocyte (GFAP: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4-fold) differentiation. TNFa significantly downregulated Hes1 (0.7, 0.5, 0.4-fold) and upregulated Mash1 (1.0, 1.2, 1.4-fold) expression. CONCLUSIONS: TNFa suppressed NPC proliferation and promoted preferential differentiation towards astrocyte versus neuronal lineage, with effects likely mediated via Hes1 and Mash1. Inflammation-induced reduction in neurogenesis and increased astrogenesis may have critical consequences for newborn hippocampal function, including cognition and behavior. At last year's meeting we reported that mRNA for TRPC4 and TRPM2 were significantly increased following antenatal GC. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of these channels in the enhance response to endotelin (ET-1) in isolated arteries. METHODS: Pregnant sheep were treated with two IM doses of betamethasone (Bmon the , 0.17 mg/kg) or vehicle (V) 24 h apart at 80 days of gestational age and allowed to deliver at term. Sheep were euthanized at 1.5 yr of age. Arteries (300 mm) obtained from the brachial vascular bed in V (n=8) and BM animals (n=10) were mounted on a wire myograph for measuring isometric force. Responses to increasing concentrations of Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and KCl were assessed in the absence and in presence of inhibitors of TRP channels, i.e. tolfenamic acid (TFA) and N-(p-Amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA). Data are expressed as Mean\u00b1SEM and were analyzed by ANOVA. RESULTS: As previously shown, the response to ET-1 was significantly higher in arteries of BM sheep. Although TFA and ACA inhibited ET-1 induced contraction in both groups, the effect of TRP channel blockers on ET-1 vasoconstriction was significantly more pronounced in arteries of GC exposed.",

Jorge P Figueroa, Jie Zhang, Angela G Massmann. Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA. INTRODUCTION: Exposure to glucocorticoids (GC) in the perinatal period is associated with several cardiometabolic alterations. We and others have shown elevations in blood pressure and increased in vitro and in vivo vascular responses to endothelin (ET).The enhanced response to ET-1 is mediated in part by activation of the ADP ribosyl cyclase pathway. The aim of this study was to determine if TRP channels are downstream in the regulation of peripheral vascular resistance and in the vascular response to ET-1 in the femoral bed. METHODS: Pregnant sheep were treated with two IM doses of betamethasone (BM, 0.17 mg/kg n=6) or vehicle (CTR, n=8) at 80 days gestation and allowed to deliver at term. At 1 y of age sheep were chronically instrumented under general anesthesia to place vascular catheters and a femoral artery flow probe. Tolfenamic acid (TFA) a TRP channel blocker (0.1 mg/Kg/h) and niacinamide a cADPR synthesis inhibitor([NIAC] 10 mg/Kg/h iv were administered for 1 hour prior and during an 8-dose (0.18, 0.40, 0.81,1.6, 3.25, 6.50, 8.12, 13 .0 and 16.25 ng/ kg/min ) cummulative intraarterial infusion of ET-1. Blood pressure and flow were recorded continuously and femoral artery vascular resistance (FVR) derived from them. Data Mean\u00b1SEM were analyzed by ANOVA. RESULTS: As previously reported FVR was significantly increased by ET in a dose-response manner in both groups. BM was associated with a differential response to TFA in both males and females. While TFA decreased the response to ET-1 in CTR sheep, it induced a significantly higher increase in FVR at higher ET-1 doses. In contrast, the effect of NIAC was significantly greater in Beta.",

Adipose tissuederived inflammatory mediators and components of the RAS are thought to participate in the regulation of blood pressure. Our working hypothesis states that GC alters the development of white adipose tissue (WAT) which will contribute to the development of metabolic alterations in the adult offspring.

These mediators are though to have a direct effect in myocardium and coronary vessels. The aim of this study is to ascertain 1) if antenatal GC alters EAT development and function in the adult particularly the expression of RAS components and 2) if ablation of abdominal visceral fat can improve the EAT alterations. METHODS: Pregnant sheep were treated with two IM doses of betamethasone (Beta, 0.17 mg/kg) or vehicle (V) 24-h apart at 80 days gestation and allowed to deliver at term.

RESULTS: Beta sheep showed a trend for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 1 to decrease (p=0.08) and for ACE-2 to increase (p=0.06). However, the ACE1/ACE2 ratio was significantly decreased.

Our working hypothesis states that GC alters the development of white adipose tissue (WAT) which will contribute to the development of metabolic alterations in the adult offspring. Preadipocytes (PA) the precursor stem cell of adipocytes secrete inflammatory mediators. To improve the understanding of the effects of antenatal GC exposure on WAT we examined the effect of antenatal GC exposure on in vitro adipocyte differentiation. The aim of the study was to investigate 1) in vitro adipocyte differentiation in adult sheep exposed as fetuses to high levels of GC and 2) the role of angiotensin II in adipogenesis. METHODS: Pregnant sheep were treated with two IM doses of betamethasone (Beta, 0.17 mg/kg) or vehicle (V) 24-h apart at 80 days gestation and allowed to deliver at term. At 1 y of age WAT was harvested from Beta (n=6) and V (n=6). WAT was dissociated with 0.15% collagenase I and stromal cells plated. Once 90% confluent, cells were cultured in induction media.

We measured mRNA abundance for PPARg, UCP-1, TNFa, adiponectin and leptin by real time PCR and data analyzed by ANOVA (Mean\u00b1SEM).

Increased maternal salt and fat intake can independently perturb placental function and can increase risk of cardiovascular disease by increasing resting blood pressure of offspring during later-life. Despite its relevance to modern western-style dietary habits, the interaction between increased maternal salt and fat intake has not been examined.

            "text": "Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a standard control diet (CON), 4% salt control diet (SD), 45% fat diet (HF) and 4% salt & 45% fat combined diet (HFHS) three weeks prior to and throughout pregnancy and lactation. At day 18 of pregnancy, intact uterine artery, fetal lower branch aorta and at postnatal day 21, weanling mesenteric vessels were mounted on a pressure myograph. Responses to pressure, agonist-induced constriction and endothelium-dependant vasodilators were investigated to determine vascular function. RESULTS: SD dam uterine vessels demonstrated a reduced vasodilator response to acetylcholine (Ach) in the presence of L-NAME and Indomethacin (INDO) and reduced vasodilator responses in HF, HFSD dams in response to ACh in the presence of INDO, Apamin and TRAM-34. Furthermore, changes in vascular function were mirrored in the fetal aorta and again, in weanling mesenteric vessels. Our results indicate that a reduction in endothelial derived hyperpolarising factor (EDHF) and/or calcium mediated vasodilation pathways were affected by maternal salt intake and a reduction in NO pathways of maternal fat-fed dam uterine arteries, fetal aorta and weanling vessels. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that developmental programming of hypertension may be caused by vascular adaptations to maternal diet in the uterine artery. We hypothesise that subsequent reduced nutrient flow and placental function could be perturbing fetal vascular development, affecting overall vascular tone which may be a major contributing factor to the subsequent increased blood pressure observed in adult offspring. We hypothesize that exposure to maternal high fat diet during development leads to an accelerated aging phenotype mediated by epigenetic dysregulation. METHODS: SD dams were fed standard chow (Con) or western diet (WD) from 3 wks through gestation/lactation. All litters culled (8/lit) and fed standard chow postweaning. Massively-parallel sequencing-based (HELP-tagging) assay was used to examine cytosine methylation levels at >1.6 million loci in the liver of female offspring at 9 wks from Con and WD and aged Con at 19-20 months (Old), n=6/grp. Cross analysis between Con vs Old and Con vs WD were used to identify loci of interest (LOI) with matching differentially methylated regions. LOI were uploaded to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Redwood City, CA) and GSEA (Broad Institute) to determine ontology and pathway enrichment. 15 Genes relevant to metabolism and aging were selected for validation with q-PCR. RESULTS: While Old demonstrated global hypomethylation in liver compared to Con, no global methylation differences were seen between WD and Con at 9wks old. For preselected significant loci between Con and WD, self-sorting heatmaps demonstrate more similar methylation pattern between WD and Old compared to Con. Identified LOI corresponded to statistically significant changes in gene expression in 5/15 genes evaluated in the 9wk WD offspring. However, 9/15 genes had changes in expression in 6 mo WD offspring and tended to be more exaggerated than Old (Figure 1 ).",

INTRODUCTION: Successful fetal growth requires the coordinated interaction of the feto-placental genome with the maternal environment. Low birth weight is also associated with adult cardio-metabolic disease risk. DNA methylation is a mechanism through which environmental and genetic influences come together and may cause disease. We investigated whether there are whole genome methylation differences in the umbilical cord blood and placentae of offpsring born with growth restriction. METHODS: We identified otherwise healthy pregnant women with either growth restricted (FGR) or appropriately grown for gestational age (AGA) offspring. We took an unbiased approach by using the Infinium Human Methylation 450 Beadchip\u00ae to investigate the whole methylome of umbilical cord blood and placentae from these FGR and AGA offspring. We validated our findings with another dataset and used objective bioinformatic tools to identify cellular pathways likely to be affected by the most differentially methylated positions (DMPs). RESULTS: We identified 76,249 DMPs in cord blood and 20,893 DMPs in the placenta (adj. p<0.05) using gestational age in a linear regression analysis. An external dataset validated our placental methylation results. To eliminate gestational age effects, we then analysed just term samples. 839 DMPs reached genome-wide significance (adjusted p<0.05) in DNA from umbilical cord blood of FGR offspring (n=19) compared with DNA from cord blood of AGA offspring (n=18). DMPs were mostly hypermethylated (blue on volcano plot).",

            "text": "GO pathway analysis of the 839 DMPs in FGR cord blood uncovered cellular pathways fundamental to gene regulation and transcription, related to important metabolic and vascular functions. The Marmal-aid database identified these DMPs within invariate, normally unmethylated regions of the genome. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified distinct DNA methylation profiles in cord blood of FGR offspring. Persistence of these DMPs might explain their predisposition to future disease. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis proposes reduced nutrition alters the trajectory of development of metabolic regulatory systems to produce a phenotype better fitted to an environment of decreased later-life nutrient availability. Aggressive behavior (AB), especially in the context of feeding competition, may be advantageous in such environments. Our prior study shows male juveniles who were intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) exhibit increased impulsivity (Reprod Sci 2012; 19:493) . We hypothesized IUGR males demonstrate higher AB rates. METHODS: With The Observer XT, 87 total hours (~7.2 hrs/ea) of behavioral observations were conducted on 12 juvenile male baboons (Papio sp., ages 3-5 yrs, human equivalent 12-20) living in groups at SW Natl Primate Research Center. IUGR (n=4) were offspring of mothers fed 70% the feed eaten by control (CTR) mothers in pregnancy and lactation. CTR (n=8) were offspring of mothers fed ad lib. RESULTS: IUGR, compared to CTR, show increased rates of behaviors in two categories (Fig 1) : Total Aggressive Behavior (TAB; t(10)=-3.1, p=0.011) and Aggressive Display Behavior (ADB; t(10)=-3.8, p=0.003). TAB contains all aggressive behavior, e.g., aggressive chase, flee from aggressor. ADB is a subset of TAB containing only threat displays, e.g., canine display, mantle shake. The presentation will include video of these behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Increased AB in offspring that experienced poor nutrition during development may represent an Aggressive Behavioral Phenotype enhancing survival and reproductive success. We previously showed delayed frontal cortex development in IUGR offspring (PNAS 2011; 108:3011) and have data (unpub) showing decreased function in the serotonin (5-HT) system, providing potential mechanisms for this phenotype. Unraveling this dynamic relationship is essential for understanding how early experiences affect lifelong behavior. The impact of growth normalization (estimated fetal weight (EFW) \u2265 10% at the final ultrasound prior to delivery) in fetuses diagnosed with fetal growth restriction (FGR) compared to those with persistent FGR (EFW <10% at the final ultrasound) is not well understood. METHODS: Retrospective cohort of all singleton, non-anomalous, fetuses who had umbilical artery (UA) Doppler studies for FGR and delivered at our institution from January 2008 to July 2012. Maternal characteristics and delivery outcomes were compared for both groups. Neonatal outcomes of interest were tabulated and compared with composite neonatal morbidity (CNM) defined as: intubated for 24 hours, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, pulmonary hypertension, seizure, HIE or death within 28 days. RESULTS: Of 11,785 evaluated at our center, 789 had FGR and 546 met inclusion criteria. 412 patients had persistent FGR and 134 showed growth normalization. Maternal demographics were not different between groups. Fetuses with persistent FGR were more likely to be delivered prior to 34 weeks (OR 3.30, 95% CI 1.28-8.47) or 37 weeks (OR 3.26, 95% CI 1.93-5.51), require NICU admission (OR 3.98, 95% CI 2.33-6.8), require respiratory support (OR 4.69, 95% CI 1.67-13.2), and be diagnosed with RDS (OR 3.81, 95% CI 1.49-9.74). Of note, those with persistent FGR more often required preterm delivery (<37 weeks) based on our institutional FGR protocol: abnormal growth, abnormal UA Dopplers, or oligohydramnios (55 vs 18.2%, p=0.02). Of term (\u226537 weeks) infants, those with persistent FGR were more likely to require NICU admission (OR 4.44, 95% CI 1.71-11.5), however, there was no significant difference in CNM (OR 5.32, 95% CI 0.68-41.39). CONCLUSIONS: Persistent FGR increases risk of preterm delivery, which is frequently iatrogenic. When delivered at term, those infants have similar rates of morbidity as infants whose growth normalized by delivery. Placental dysfunction and associated fetal growth restriction (FGR) are associated with increased placental and fetal oxidative stress. We hypothesise that maternal administration of melatonin will reduce maternal, fetal and placental oxidative stress, and thereby reduce brain injury and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in FGR neonates.",

Brianne E Bimson, Lois Brustman, Elizabeth Murphy, Kimberly Herrera, Janelle Foroutan, Barak Rosenn. OB/ GYN, St Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center, New York, NY, USA. INTRODUCTION: In dichorionic diamniotic (DADC) twins: 1. Which trimester (tri) ultrasound (US) best predicts discordant growth? 2. What percent discordance predicts pathologic growth? METHODS: Data was retrospectively collected on deliveries and US of DADC twins during each tri from 1/2006-3/2013. Discordant growth was calculated in a standard fashion: 1st tri CRL in millimeters; 2nd and 3rd tri estimated fetal weight (EFW) in grams; and actual birth weight (ABW) in grams. Pathologic discordance is defined as >20% and 25%. Discordant twins (ABW \u226520%) were compared to concordant twins at delivery via linear regression models and ROC curves. Ability to predict ABW discordance >20% and 25%, and optimal cut-off points by percent discordance, were calculated from the areas under the ROC curves for each tri. RESULTS: Of 566 twin sets, 336 met inclusion. 54 (16%) had >20% and 27 (8%) had >25% growth discordance at delivery. For ABW discordance >20%, 3rd tri EFW discordance was significantly more predictive (AUC=85.40%) than 1 st tri (AUC=51.99%; p<0.0001) or 2nd tri (AUC=63.03%; p<0.0001) (Fig.1 ). An EFW discordance of >11.45% in the 3rd tri represents the optimal cut-off for prediction of ABW discordance (sensitivity 74%; specificity 84%). For ABW discordance of >25%, 3 rd tri EFW discordance was significantly more predictive (AUC=90.18%) than 1 st tri (AUC=54.88%; p<0.0001) or 2 nd tri (AUC=60.30%; p<0.0001) discordance. 3rd tri EFW discordance of >12.34% is the optimal cut-off for prediction of ABW discordance >25% (sensitivity 89%; specificity 83%) (Fig.2) .",

It also implies that clinicians should be using a significantly lower percent discordance than 20% in the 3rd tri US for DADC twins. To determine if ultrasound (US) can accurately predict diamniotic dichorionic (DADC) twin growth discordance at birth. METHODS: Data was retrospectively collected on deliveries and US of DADC twins from 1/2006 to 3/2013. Twins were included if they had an estimated fetal weight (EFW) within 2 weeks of delivery in the 3 rd trimester. The Bland and Altman method was used to assess the accuracy of US in predicting actual birth (ABW) discordance at the 20% and at the 25% levels of discordance. RESULTS: Of 566 twin sets, 291 met inclusion. The mean (\u00b1SD) gestational age at the time of US was 35w2d\u00b12w and the mean gestational age at delivery was 36w2d\u00b12w. The mean interval from US to delivery was 7\u00b14 days. The mean ABW discordance was 11.55\u00b1 8.97% and the mean US EFW discordance was 8.56\u00b17.87% (p<0.0001). US underestimated the magnitude of birth weight discordance by 2.99\u00b17.15% (mean \u00b1SD); 95% limits of agreement [-17.00, 11.02] . 49 sets of twins (16.8%) had ABW discordance \u226520% and 25 sets (8.6%) had \u226525%. Table 1 depicts the sensitivities, specificities, PPVs and NPVs of US in predicting ABW discordance at the 20% and 25% levels. Figure 1 graphically depicts the number of correctly and incorrectly predicted outcomes in the study population. To test the hypothesis that in diamniotic dichorionic (DADC) twin pregnancies ultrasound tends to overestimate the weight of twin A and underestimate the weight twin B. METHODS: Data was retrospectively collected on deliveries and ultrasound of DADC twins from 1/2006 to 3/2013. Twins were included if they had an estimated fetal weight (EFW) within 2 weeks of delivery. Statistical analyses were performed using the Bland and Altman method to assess the accuracy of ultrasound at predicting actual birth weight (ABW) within 2 weeks of delivery. RESULTS: Of 566 twin sets delivered, 293 delivered within 2 weeks of ultrasound. In this group, mean (\u00b1SD) gestational age (GA) at delivery was 36-2/7 (\u00b12) weeks, mean GA at ultrasound was 35-2/7\u00b12 weeks, and the mean interval from ultrasound to delivery was 7 \u00b14 days. Mean EFW for twin A and B were 2439 \u00b1 462g and 2405 \u00b1 474g, respectively. Mean actual birth weight for twins A and B were 2492 \u00b1 476g and 2410 \u00b1 490g, respectively. In 36% of these twin pregnancies, the EFW of both twin A and B were underestimated, in 25% both were overestimated, in 26% twin A was underestimated and twin B was overestimated, and in 13% twin A was overestimated and twin B underestimated.

Ten (33%) of the subjects were 20 weeks or greater gestational age, 11 were first trimester, and 3 were 13-20 weeks. Of the first trimester patients, 5 had anembronic gestations with only gestational sac or yolk sac noted on ultrasound, while 6 had a fetal pole without cardiac activity. 3 participants had anomalies diagnosed on ultrasound prior to the fetal demise. The initial analysis will include the percentage of samples with cffDNA, fetal fraction, the ability to identify cytogenic abnormalities including deletions and duplications, and result accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that apoptosis of the placenta continues in the presence of fetal demise and miscarriage. Given that the pregnancy remains inutero at the time of blood sampling, we believe that cffDNA is present in the setting of miscarriage and IUFD prior to the evacuation of the uterus. Our study will provide insight into which clinical settings of nonviable pregnancy maternal serum cffDNA testing may be useful. The key pathology underlying fetal growth restriction (FGR) is uteroplacental insufficiency, involving vascular dysfunction and/ or impaired nutrient transport. Vascular tone in the placenta is critically regulated by nitric oxide (NO), and aberrant NO production or action is associated with FGR in both humans and animal models. Here, we test the hypothesis that nitrite (NO 2 -) improves vascular function and fetal growth in a mouse model of FGR associated with reduced NO, the endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout (eNOS -/-) mouse. METHODS: Pregnant C57Bl/6J (wildtype; WT) and eNOS -/mice were treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO 2 , 50mg/L) in drinking water from E12.5. Untreated control mice received standard drinking water only. At E18.5, fetal and placental weights were measured and uterine arteries (UtA) isolated for assessment of vascular function using wire myography. UtA were mounted on a wire myograph and constriction (phenylephrine [PE]; 0.1-10000nM), endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine [Ach]; 0.1-10000nM) and -independent (sodium nitroprusside [SNP]; 0.1-10000nM) relaxation assessed. In addition, relaxation responses to NaNO 2 (10nM-1mM) were assessed in pre-constricted UtA of untreated mice. RESULTS: UtA from untreated WT and eNOS -/mice exhibited dosedependent relaxation in response to NaNO 2 (10nM-1mM); the response was significantly enhanced in eNOS -/animals compared to WT (p<0.001), as was relaxation to SNP (p<0.001). In UtA from NaNO 2 -treated mice, constriction to PE was reduced compared with untreated mice, but this effect reached significance only in WT mice (p<0.05). Preliminary data suggest that maternal NaNO 2 treatment increases fetal weight and fetal:placental weight ratio compared with untreated controls, an effect seen in both WT and eNOS -/animals. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that NO 2 induces relaxation in UtA vessels, consistent with findings in other vascular beds, and indicate an enhanced response in eNOS -/mice suggestive of upregulated downstream NO signaling in these animals. Improved UtA function is suggested by reduced contractile potential following maternal treatment with NaNO 2 . Further studies are required to determine the mechanisms by which NO 2 alters uteroplacental vascular function in pregnancy and whether it can significantly improve fetal growth.

We hypothesized that protection from the consequences of IUGR differs between the older hind brain (HB) and newer fore brain (FB) and shows sex differences. METHODS: Baboon tissues were collected at 0.9 gestation fetuses from CTR and IUGR (dams fed 70% of CTR dams from 30dG -165dG). Gene expression profiling was performed (Illumina BeadChips) on CTR female and male FB and HB (n=3 per group). Differentially expressed genes were identified (GeneSifter) and network analysis performed (Ingenuity Pathways). RESULTS: In female FC we found 459 up and 283 down and male 460 up and 127 down regulated genes. In female HB we found 12 up and 99 down and male 557 up and 153 down regulated genes. Only 4 genes were common to female and male HB and 20 genes were common to female and male FB. Unique to male HB differentially expressed genes included dopamine receptor D3 (down), cannabinoid receptor (CR -up) and amyloid precursor protein (up). Functional analyses of differentially expressed genes showed activation of genes related to central nervous system development in HB of IUGR versus CTR males. This functional network was not activated in female IUGR HB or female or male FB compared to CTR. More extensive network analyses consistently showed lack of differences between female IUGR and CTR HB. In contrast male showed activation of pathways and networks related to cell proliferation and neural development.",

Mechanisms of neurotoxicity have been explored in animal models and in vitro human models, but data from in vivo human models is scarce. METHODS: Fetal brain tissue was collected from women following elective pregnancy termination. A detailed EtOH questionnaire was administered to identify cases and controls. Women reporting significant EtOH exposure were compared to gestational age matched controls. Synaptic and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared. Caspase-3 levels were assessed using the Caspase-Glo 3/7Assay. Nonparametric statistical methods were utilized. RESULTS: Four EtOh exposed patients were compared to 4 controls. Caspase-3 levels were significantly higher in the cytoplasm (p=0.03) and trended higher in the syntaptosome (p=0.11) of EtoH exposed fetal brain tissue (Fig 1) . Levels of Caspase-3 in synaptic membranes and cytoplasm were similar (p=0.57, related samples Wilcoxon). Synaptic caspase-3 levels were highly positively correlated with gestational age (r=0.73, p=0.04). Additional pathways will presented (data not shown). CONCLUSIONS: We present novel data on the mechanism of neurotoxicity in a human in vivo model of FAS. We demonstrate that EtOH exposure is linked to significant increases in apoptosis as assessed by Caspase-3. Further, we demonstrate a strong association between gestational age and increasing apoptosis. This suggests that controlled apoptosis is a critical neurodevelopmental process as human brain development progresses but that an imbalance towards uncontrolled excess apoptosis is problematic. Our model presents an ideal platform for further investigation of basic mechanisms, dose-response and windows of gestational vulnerability with direct translational potential.",

Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ, USA. INTRODUCTION: Genetic testing in women at reproductive ages can affect reproductive behaviors and the patients life. For these reasons, pangenetic testing must be offered in a sensitive and tactful manner to avoid stigmatization and genetic selection. In most cases, patient's need time to process the complexity of the information presented to make informed decisions. We sought to analyze the responses to a 3-step algorithm for pan-genetic testing that includes: (i) counseling, (ii) providing a home saliva collection kits and additional information to review at home, and (iii) genetic analysis if the patient sends the kit to the laboratory. METHODS: This was a nested study using data from women at reproductive ages referred for genetic consultation from 6/10/10 through 5/31/13. Patients who expressed interest in pan-genetic testing were encouraged to submit the testing-kits to the laboratory as a couple. RESULTS: A total of 727 patients ( 388 couples and 51 individual patients) accepted saliva collection kits. 63% (n=212/388) couples and 55% (n=28/51) individuals submitted samples to the laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: These pilot study addresses the importance of the informed consent process prior to offering pan-genetic testing. Presently, all the health care systems are not equally equipped with the logistics, trained personnel and monetary resources to counsel patients' in different geographical areas and with diverse economical and cultural backgrounds concerning : 1) the types and natural history of diseases included in pangenetic screening panels, 2) accuracy and residual risks after negative result, 3) importance of concurrent couples-based testing, and 4) the reproductive options in at risk pregnancies. In the choroid plexus, site for the blood-CSF barrier, exchange occurs between blood and CSF solutes. This exchange may be particularly important in the fetus when the plexus is comparatively large and the brain itself less vascularized. The structural basis for the blood-CSF barrier is junctional complexes between the epithelial cells, necessary for selective transfer of compounds across this barrier. Most previous knowledge on barrier properties is gained from rodent studies. In these studies we have examined the primate choroid plexus during fetal development in the baboon (P.hamadryas) since it has very similar placentation and timing of brain maturation to humans. METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to determine the transcriptome of the fetal choroid plexus at gestational day (GD) 90/120/165 (n=4/4/6, mixed sexes), equivalent to about 20/28/36 weeks in humans. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina platform and Pathway analysis conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software focusing on barrier-associated proteins. To examine protein expression, brain sections from fetal baboons were examined using antibodies to barrier proteins. RESULTS: The tight-junctional signaling pathway was significantly enriched (p<0.001) between GD90 and GD165, with 67% of genes significantly changed; 45% of genes significantly down-regulated and 22% up-regulated in this pathway. The epithelial adherens junction signaling pathway was significantly enriched (p<0.001) between GD90 and GD165 with 78% of genes significantly changed; 52% down-regulated and 26% up-regulated. Immunohistochemistry showed that several barrier associated proteins are already expressed in epithelial cells of the fetal plexus. CONCLUSIONS: Junctional signaling pathways were significantly enriched suggesting high gene regulation during fetal development with the majority of genes being down-regulated with age. Together with barrier proteins being present on choroidal epithelial cells, this implies that in primates the junctional complexes, the fundamental structures for a functional blood-CSF barrier, are established at an early stage of fetal development with important implications for neuronal exposure to endogenous and xenobiotic agents.",

RESULTS: Eight control (28 fetuses) and six MNR (20 fetuses) animals were necropsied with MNR fetal and placental weights decreased 33 and 23%, respectively, placental to body weight ratios increased 19%, and ponderal index increased 11%. Select control (n=14) and MNR (n=14) fetuses underwent full necropsy, with brain to liver weight ratios increased 54%, blood glucose values decreased 24%, and Hb values increased 9% in MNR fetuses, although the latter was not significant. In these fetuses, EPO protein was increased 275%, 136%, and 45% in kidney, placenta, and liver tissues, respectively, although the liver change was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: MNR prior to and continuing through pregnancy in guinea pigs results in FGR with placentas that are large relative to body weight and likely a reactive process to nutrient deficiency, and livers that are small relative to body weight and likely reflecting a degree of blood flow redistribution; changes which are also characteristic of the asymmetrical FGR seen with \"placental insufficiency\".

Higher levels of vagal activity are associated with lower systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of macrophages, mediated by the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP). The gut represents the biggest vagus-innervated organ. Fetal heart rate variability (fHRV) serves as a proxy marker of CAP activity. Consequently, fHRV changes may reflect changes of gut's inflammatory status. We hypothesized that fHRV can identify fetuses with gut inflammation. METHODS: Near-term fetal sheep were surgically prepared with vascular catheters and ECG electrodes (N=27 controls, N=14 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation). Fetal arterial blood samples were drawn at baseline and seven selected time points to profile inflammation. At 54 h post LPS, necropsy was performed. Blood samples were analyzed for IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a. A novel measure of inflammation, temporal cytokine variability (CV), was defined as coefficient of variation of cytokine secretion to further quantify differences observed in control vs. LPS-induced inflammatory profiles. FHRV was quantified by Continuous Individualized Multivariate Variability Analysis (CIMVA) for Skewness, asymmetry index (AsymI), SampEn and Complexity. The time-matched fHRV measures were correlated to the levels of IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a and to the Iba1+ cell density in terminal ileum to quantify the degree of macrophage activation in relation to CAP activity. Results are reported for P<0.05. RESULTS: LPS resulted in a pronounced gender-independent ileum inflammation. In the LPS, but not in the control group, at 3 hours post LPS, IL-6, but not IL-1b and TNF-a, was elevated and AsymI and Skewness of fHRV correlated to Iba1+ cell density (R=-0.53 and R=0.60, respectively). IL-1b CV and TNF-a CV were decreased in the LPS group and fetuses with lower IL-1b CV showed higher Iba1+ cell density (R=-0.70). IL-1b CV was higher in fetuses with higher fHRV complexity at 24 hours (R=0.71). CONCLUSIONS: Confirming our hypothesis multiple fHRV measures correlated to the degree of intestinal macrophage activation and CV. This supports the notion of a common neuroregulatory mechanism via CAP. Non-invasively obtained fetal CAP response signatures may help identify babies at risk of developing life-threatening gut inflammation. Trophoblast differentiation into a multinucleate syncytium is a key biological mechanism. Transcriptional regulation of fusogenic genes to promote fusion and capacity for placental hormonogenesis, is achieved by coordinated action of signals such as cAMP and MAPKs. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), acts as a placental growth signaling sensor, and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of diseases such as IUGR, associated with abnormal trophoblast differentiation. mTOR is also implicated in the pathological mechanisms of diabetes associated with excess nutrient availability and insulin resistance.",

Five GDM (BMI >30) and 6 BMI-matched controls were used. To investigate the role of mTOR in vitro, in the trophoblast differentiation mechanisms, we used the BeWo choriocarcinoma cell line, a model of cAMP-dependent trophoblast differentiation. Cells were syncytialized with forskolin treatment for 24h with or without rapamycin or other suitable signalling inhibitors. Protein expression and phosphorylation were detected by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed increased mTOR expression and phospho-mTOR (Ser 2448/2481) staining n GDM placenta compared to controls. In vitro studies showed that inhibition of mTOR by rapamysin, reduced forskolin-induced hCG release whereas, syncytin-1 and -2 mRNA expression was substantially augmented. These findings led us to investigate the effect of forskolin-driven adenylyl cyclase activation on mTOR expression and activity. Forskolin treatment for 24h significantly reduced mTOR mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, within 10min of forskolin treatment there was a substantial reduction in basal mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2481 and Ser2441, which is required for mTOR activity. This was associated with decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K, at Ser371. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify distinct actions of mTOR on the biochemical and morphological differentiation of BeWo trophoblasts.

Our recent studies have identified placental dysfunction in teenagers with low folate status in the third trimester, including reduced placental nutrient transport, increased trophoblast apoptosis and dysregulation of placental hormones. To verify folate deficiency as a causative factor, in vitro culture models were developed to assess the direct effects of folate depletion on placental function. We hypothesized that folate depletion in vitro leads to reduced placental nutrient transport, in particular amino acid transport via System A.

One of the factors that mediate telomere shortening in those placentas is decreased hTERT mRNA, leading to decreased protein expression and therefore, reduced telomere elongation. Telomere capture, which is a healing process, is increased in IUGR trophoblasts as a compensatory mechanism. Biglycan is a proteoglycan localized either on the cell surface or in extracellular matrix, where it is thought to induce migration and invasion in many cell types. However, the biological role of biglycan in the trophoblast has not been elucidated.

RESULTS: Immunofluorescence of chorionic villi and basal decidual sections revealed expression of biglycan in all subtypes of cytotrophoblast in early placentas, but not in EVT at term placentas. Flow cytometry indicated expression of biglycan at the cell surface of trophoblast SGHPL-5 cells and co-expression of HLA-G1 and biglycan in first trimester EVT. Western blot analyses confirmed biglycan expression in first trimester EVT and SGHPL-5 cells. Purified and recombinant biglycan promoted migration and invasion on SGHPL-5 cells and, first trimester and term EVT, whereas cell proliferation was not affected. Biglycan stimulated phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308 and Ser473 in both SGHPL-5 cells and fi rst trimester EVT cells, but did not promote activation of ERK and NF-kB. Finally, gene silencing of AKT1 in SGHPL-5 cells using small-hairpin microRNA, abolished the stimulatory effects of biglycan on trophoblast invasion. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data indicate that biglycan increases the motility of fi rst trimester and term trophoblast by specifi cally promoting AKT signaling activation.

Mechanistic studies using the BeWo placental cells confi rmed that MgD signifi cantly reduced placental cell viability and proliferation. These results warrant further studies of the effect of Mg/ MgD on placental development and function. Prior studies reported that short cervix is a predictor of emergent delivery for hemorrhage in placenta previa cases. We investigated the value of this sonographic parameter in our population. METHODS: Chart review from 2004 -2012 of placenta previa cases with transvaginal cervical length (CL) measured at the fi rst ultrasound performed after 28 weeks of gestation. Short cervix was defi ned as CL <3 cm. Exclusion criteria: multiple gestations, polyhydramnios, cerclage, fetal growth restriction, fetal anomalies, maternal uterine anomalies, history of conization. Primary outcome: emergent cesarean delivery (CD) for hemorrhage. Secondary outcomes: gestational age(GA) at CD, estimated blood loss, blood transfusion, birth weight, arterial cord PH, 5 minute APGAR score, NICU admission. Mann Whitney, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used. RESULTS: Of the 42 placenta previa cases, 13 had emergent CD (31%) and 29 (69%) had scheduled CD. The index CL did not differ between cases with emergent vs. scheduled CD. Only 2/42 cases (4.8%) had a short cervix at the index ultrasound, and both had a scheduled CD. Emergent CD was associated with lower birth weight and GA at delivery, more antepartum bleeding episodes and NICU admissions(Table1). There was no difference in estimated blood loss at delivery, blood transfusion, cord PH or 5 minute APGAR score between emergent and scheduled CD. CONCLUSIONS: Although emergent CD for bleeding in previa occurred in 31% of our study population, cervical length was not a useful predictor of risk. Large prospective studies are needed before sonographic cervical length is used to guide timing of delivery for placenta previa. ",

Defective deep placentation (failure of invasion and transformation of the spiral arteries by the trophoblast) may cause preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and preterm birth. Early reports suggested that DHA rich diet reduces the incidence of deep placentation disorders. We postulate that DHA improves placentation and reduces deep placentation disorders. Here we aimed to demonstrate that DHA improves trophoblast migration in vitro. METHODS: Migration will be studied by the \"wound-healing\" assay in an immortalized extravillous trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SVneo) either in the presence or absence of DHA (100 \u00b5M) and different oxygen conditions. HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells (100,000), were seeded in each well on cover slides in 24-well plates containing 500 ml complete medium for 24 hours. Cells were then washed with PBS and the wound was generated by removing cells in the center of the well with a sterile pipette tip. The experiments were performed in reduced serum (5% FBS). Initially incubations in the different experimental conditions were carried out for 6, 10, 14 and 24 hours. We then incubated for 10 hours, time in which maximal differences among treatments were observed. The migration assay was performed 4 times in duplicate; three images were obtained along the wound and quantified using ImageJ v.1.34 software. The area of the wound was measured and the \"healing\" of the wound was measured as the area recovered by cells at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: After 10 h of experiment the wound was healed by 54% (20% O 2 ) -60% (8% O 2 ) -53% (2% O 2 ) in control conditions.

RESULTS: There was a significant main effect of PI treatment (p<0.001 by 2-way ANOVA), but not of oxygen environment on the secretion of sflt1 (p>0.05). PI increased sFlt1 in CM on average by 3-fold. sFlt1 secretion was increased by PI under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (p<0.01 and p<0.05 vs untreated, respectively). CI did not significantly alter sFlt1 secretion induced by PI under either oxygen condition (p>0.05 vs PI alone). The vehicles for PI and CI (dilute DMSO) did not significantly affect sFlt1 secretion. Removal of microvesicles from the CM by centrifugation reduced sFlt1 concentration by 14+2%. CONCLUSIONS: Proteasome inhibition increased secretion of sFlt1 by cultured human trophoblast. This increase was largely unaffected by pancaspase inhibition or removal of microvesicles from the CM suggesting that it was independent of apoptosis. The findings are consistent with elevated HIF-a (and hence sFlt1 transcription) resulting from reduced HIF-a degradation by the impaired proteasome, although other mechanisms may be at work and further investigation is needed. In summary, reduced proteasome activity in PE placentas may be an additional mechanism for enhanced placental secretion of sFlt1 into the maternal circulation during preeclampsia.

Renewal occurs by proliferation and differentiation of underlying cytotrophoblasts, and their subsequent fusion with the multinucleated STB. In non-placental tissues the amino acid taurine regulates proliferation, differentiation and fusion. Here we compare maternal plasma taurine concentration in PE with normal pregnancy (NP) and test the hypothesis that STB renewal is compromised by a low maternal plasma taurine concentration. METHODS: Maternal plasma taurine concentration in women experiencing PE (n=5) and NP (n=8) was determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Placental villous explants from NP at term (n=6) were cultured for 7 days in either low (~9mM taurine contributed by serum) or high taurine medium (100mM added taurine). During explant culture, STB sheds and thereafter is regenerated by processes resembling STB renewal in vivo 1 .

The proportion of villi with proliferating cells was also significantly lower in low taurine compared to high taurine culture conditions (p<0.01, Mann Whitney). CONCLUSIONS: STB renewal in vitro is compromised in conditions of low taurine. We have shown previously that STB taurine transporter activity is significantly lower in PE than in NP 2 . Lower maternal plasma taurine in combination with reduced STB taurine uptake in PE could contribute to the altered STB renewal and placental pathology that is evident in this pregnancy complication. Maternal obesity during pregnancy results in an adverse intrauterine environment and affects placental function. Nitric oxide (NO) regulates placental function via effects on fetoplacental vascular tone, gene expression, platelet adhesion to trophoblast, and cellular respiration. Placental NO synthase expression and NO production are increased with preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, both associated with maternal obesity. The interaction of NO with superoxide produces peroxynitrite an oxidant that induces nitrative stress (protein nitration). Nitration of mitochondrial enzymes inhibits mitochondrial respiration under conditions of maternal obesity. We show increased nitration in the placenta. We tested the hypothesis that maternal obesity alters placental nitric oxide production and antioxidant capacity leading to altered activity of the mitochondrial protein MnSOD. METHODS: Placental villous tissue was randomly sampled at term (~40 weeks) after c. section (no labor) from two groups of women based on pre-pregnancy BMI: normal (BMI 22.61+0.31, n=10) and obese (BMI 36.16+0.37, n=10) . Each group contained equal numbers of male and female placentas. Mitochondria were extracted using differential centrifugation and lysed. Mn-SOD was measured by western blot in mitochondrial lysate and in the immunoprecipitate from a nitrotyrosine antibody and normalized to voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and amido black, respectively. Total NO (measured as nitrite/nitrate), total SOD and MnSOD activity, and total antioxidant capacity were quantified in placental homogenates of normal and obese women using commercially available kits. RESULTS: Total NO production, total antioxidant capacity, SOD activity, MnSOD protein levels and nitrated MnSOD were significantly decreased (P<0.05) in placentas of obese women compared to normal BMI. ANOVA revealed a significant fetal sex-dependent increase (P<0.05, SNK) in total antioxidant capacity and in SOD activity in placentas of normal male fetuses vs normal female and obese male and female. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal obesity appears to reduce NO generation/ availability in the placenta in parallel with reduced antioxidant defenses, perhaps due to increased nitrative stress which consumes NO. The protection seen in the male placenta of a normal BMI pregnancy appears to be lost with maternal obesity. The decreased MnSOD expression and activity reinforces our observation of placental mitochondrial dysfunction with obesity. Low maternal serum concentrations of pregnancyassociated plasma protein A (PAPPA) in the first trimester has been attributed to suboptimal placentation and associated with higher incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. Women with pre-existing medical co-morbidities are at higher risk for these complications and more intensive surveillance is typically recommended.",

CONCLUSIONS: Low first trimester PAPP-A does not reliably identify women with medical co-morbidities at risk for adverse pregnancy outcome. The mechanisms for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and fetal growth restriction are potentially different. PAPP-A is a metalloprotease that cleaves insulinbinding protein 4 and thereby regulates the availability of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), a mitogenic peptide that facilitates multiple cell functions, including trophoblast invasion and placental growth. In addition to aneuploidy, low concentrations of PAPPA in the first trimester have been associated with disorders of impaired placentation.

Recent studies have shown that vitamin D intake in pregnancy is beneficial to both maternal and fetal health. However, the beneficial effects of vitamin D on placenta are largely unknown. Increased oxidative stress and increased thromboxane (TXA 2 ) production are characteristics of placental dysfunction in preeclampsia (PE). In this study, we specifically tested if vitamin D could suppress increased oxidative stress-induced TXA 2 production by placental trophoblast cells (TCs). METHODS: 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 was used as bioactive vitamin D. CoCl 2 , a hypoxic mimic reagent, was used to induce trophoblast oxidative stress. TCs were isolated from normal placentas (n=6) and cultured with DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and antibiotics. After syncytialization, cells were incubated with 500nM of CoCl 2 for 24hrs with or without pretreatment of 20nM of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 . Untreated cells were used as the controls. Medium levels of TXB 2 , 6-keto PGF1a (6K), and soluble phospholipase A 2 (sPLA 2 ) were measured by ELISA. TXB 2 and 6K are stable metabolites of TXA 2 and prostacyclin. Protein expression for HO-1, COX-1, and COX-2 were determined by Western blot. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and paired t-test. A p level < 0.05 was set as statistically significant. RESULTS: Cells treated with CoCl 2 produced significantly more TXB 2 and 6K than untreated controls, p<0.01. The increased TXB 2 production and increased ratio of TXB 2 to 6K induced by CoCl 2 were significantly reduced in cells pretreated with 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 , p<0.05 and p<0.01. Expression of HO-1 and COX-2, but not COX-1, were increased in cells treated with CoCl 2 . 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 had no effect on COX-1 and HO-1 expression, but blocked CoCl 2 induced up-regulation of COX-2 expression. To determine if inhibition of COX-2 up-regulation by 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 is responsible for reducing TXB 2 production, COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 was used. We found that inhibition of COX-2 blocked CoCl 2 induced TXB 2 production by TCs, p<0.01. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that inhibition of COX-2 activation could be a mechanism that 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 suppresses oxidative stressinduced thromboxane production by placental trophoblast cells. COX-2 is an inflammatory mediator. Thus, we speculate that vitamin D has the ability to inhibit oxidative stress induced inflammatory response and to reduce TX production by placental TCs. ",

As the placenta shares common attributes with tumours, we sought to examine the expression and function of p32 in the human placenta. METHODS: p32 expression and localisation in human placenta was determined by quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Knockdown of p32 protein in the syncytium of term placental explants was achieved using two different p32specific siRNA sequences, and was compared to explants treated with a non targeting (NT) siRNA sequence. Knockdown was confirmed by quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The effect of p32 knockdown on cytotrophoblast (CTB) proliferation and apoptosis was quantified by immunostaining for Ki67 and M30. Necrosis was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release. Glucose extraction from culture medium and lactate production were quantified as markers of glycolysis. Accumulation of MitoTracker dye in explants was examined by fluorescence microscopy, as an indicator of mitochondrial function. RESULTS: p32 mRNA and protein expression was significantly higher in the first trimester than at term (P<0.01; Mann Whitney U test). p32 was highly expressed in the syncytium, the underlying CTB, the vascular endothelium and by a proportion of cells in the villous stroma. Syncytial p32 expression was reduced in placentas from women with FGR, compared to placentas from healthy controls (P<0.01; Mann Whitney U test). p32 knockdown in term explants significantly reduced the number of Ki67-positive CTB (P<0.05; Kruskall Wallis test) but did not alter CTB apoptosis or necrosis. p32 knockdown significantly increased lactate production (P<0.05; Kruskall Wallis test) and reduced glucose extraction from culture medium (P<0.001; Kruskall Wallis test). p32 knockdown was also associated with reduced MitoTracker dye accumulation in trophoblast mitochondria. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that p32 is important for CTB proliferation, perhaps via a mechanism involving regulation of normal mitochondrial function and metabolism. As p32 expression is reduced in FGR, this may contribute to some of the associated placental pathologies [1], such as reduced CTB proliferation. ",

            "text": "The alpha-Arrestin ARRDC3 Is Expressed by Trophoblast and Impacts Trophoblast Cell Migration. The a-arrestin ARRDC3 has been shown to be highly expressed by the placenta, but its role is unknown. In breast tumors, ARRDC3 was found to suppress breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Based on its actions in other tissues, we hypothesized that ARRDC3 would influence trophoblast cell invasion. This study investigates the pattern of expression of ARRDC3 in the placenta and whether it plays a role in regulating placental invasion. METHODS: Placenta was collected according to an IRB-approved protocol and the tissue was fixed, sectioned, and stained for ARRDC3 and HPL, a positive control for syncytiotrophoblast cells. ARRDC3 expression across gestational age was measured by qPCR on RNA extracted from whole placental tissue. The choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3 was found to express ARRDC3, and siRNA knockdown of ARRDC3 was performed in these cells to ascertain differences in cell migration and invasion. The migration of ARRDC3 siRNA-transfected cells was assessed using a wound-healing assay. RESULTS: ARRDC3 appeared to primarily localize to the syncytiotrophoblast cell layer as it colocalized with HPL. The qPCR results indicate that ARRDC3 expression increases over gestational age five-fold from the first to the third trimester. Compared to control siRNA transfection, there was a 50% decrease in migration in cells transfected with ARRDC3 siRNA. CONCLUSIONS: ARRDC3 is expressed in the placenta and increases over gestation. Knockdown of ARRDC3 results in decreased migration in a choriocarcinoma cell line. Further studies are required to determine the function of ARRDC3 in noncancerous trophoblast cells. We previously found that human placenta undergoes global DNA methylation modification during normal gestation. Our preliminary data assessing the methylome of decidua-placental interface of the most common aneuploidies, trisomy 13, 18 and 21 (T21, T18, T13) showed differences from the euploid control. Herein, we further investigated the extent and the nature of these differences to yield better diagnostic and therapeutic advancements. METHODS: 2 nd trimester decidua-placental interface samples from T21 (n=10), T18 (n=6), T13 (n=4) and euploid controls (n=5) were collected. Ploidy was confirmed by interphase FISH. DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina Infinium 450K platform. R program, UCSC genome browser and DAVID database were used for statistical analysis, genomic location, and pathway analysis. RESULTS: Differentially methylated probes were selected based on statistical significance using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test and b-value\u22650.2. Compared to control, T18 had the most differences, followed by T21 and T13. Also, majority of differentially methylated CpG sites were hypermethylated in T18 and T21, while hypomethylated in T13. When comparing the trisomies to each other, T21 vs. T13 and T21 vs. T18 showed more differences than T18 vs. T13. Assessment of chromosomal distribution of the differentially methylated CpG sites did not reveal a significant enrichment of chromosomal hotspots, but when compared to percent chromosomal representation in 450K, some chromosomes showed a varying involvement in each comparison. When comparing genomic location in trisomies vs. control or vs. each other, differentially methylated CpG sites were located 40% in CpG islands (CGI), 7% in CGI shelves, 23% in CGI shores, and 30% in non-CGI regions. Pathway analysis in trisomies compared to control revealed Cadherin, cell adhesion, and calcium binding to be abnormal in the three trisomies, and HOX, transcription factor regulation, and sequence-specific DNA binding in both T18 and T21. We found embryonic morphogenesis, pattern specification, and embryonic skeletal development were affected in T18, and neuron differentiation and cell fate commitment were affected in T21. CONCLUSIONS: We observed significant differences in DNA methylomes of T21, T18, and T13 placenta suggestive of involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in developmental abnormalities and underscoring the significance of elucidating molecular mechanisms in the common aneuploidies. INTRODUCTION: Pre-eclampsia (PE), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are major sources of clinical morbidity and mortality in pregnant women worldwide. The mechanisms underlying these gestational diseases are complex and not yet fully understood, but one factor contributing to their development is impaired maternal-fetal nutrient transport. Therefore, we aimed to identify candidate membrane transporters involved in transplacental nutrient transfer associated with PE/IUGR or GDM. METHODS: Using in silico strategies, we analysed various gene expression data sets generated on different platforms focusing on solute carriers, ABC transporters and TRP channels in order to identify transporters that are differently expressed between patients and gestational age-matched controls. These bioinformatic analyses were combined with literature data to define a catalogue of target transporters that could be involved in the development of PE/IUGR or GDM. Transporters of interest were then analysed for gene expression using qRT-PCR in placental tissues of patients and controls. For validating the results on protein and functional level, we started to establish an in vitro assay using freshly isolated primary cytotrophoblast cells polarized on the Transwell \u00ae system. RESULTS: Using bioinformatics approaches, we initially identified 37 target membrane proteins which were mainly associated with the transport of amino acids, vitamins, and trace elements. At the current state of analysis, the amino acid transporters SLC7A7, SLC38A2, SLC38A5, and the thiamine transporter SLC19A3 showed significant differences in placental mRNA expression between controls and patients affected by PE and/or IUGR. Subsequent gene expression analysis in our in-house GDM placental tissue bank is still ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our in silico analyses, literature data and first follow-up in vitro validations, we were able to define potentially interesting candidate transporters implicated in PE/IUGR or GDM. To date, additional newly defined candidate targets are being analysed on mRNA level in PE/IUGR and GDM. Subsequent analyses on protein and functional level will reveal whether these targets could be of diagnostic or therapeutical interest in these pregnancy pathologies. The specific consequences of hyperglycemia on placental metabolism are incompletely understood but likely contribute to the poor pregnancy outcomes associated with diabetes mellitus (DM). This study aimed to identify biological pathways which are altered in trophoblast exposed to hyperglycemia, using an interactome model to integrate transcriptomic and metabolomic data. METHODS: BeWo were cultured in DMEM/F12, 5mM D-glucose for 24h then switched to media containing either 5 or 25 mM D-glucose for a further 48h (n=6), as a model of the placenta in DM. The effect of hyperglycemia on gene expression and metabolite profile was determined by microarray analysis of pooled BeWo RNA and LC-MS & GC-MS analysis of cells and culture media, respectively. Interaction of genes and metabolites which were significantly altered due to hyperglycemia (fold change (FC) \u2265\u00b11.3), was assessed using the Metscape interactome database to generate a network model. RESULTS: An interactome model of 5632 genes and 41 metabolites (15604 interactions) was generated. Metabolic pathways which most highly responded to hyperglycemia included fatty acid b-oxidation (evidenced by changes in e.g. hexadecanoic acid (FC+1.7); genes encoding hydroxysteroid (17-\u03b2) dehydrogenase 1 (FC+2.18) and palmityl-protein thioesterase 1 (FC+1.8)) and glycerosphingolipid metabolism (sphingosine (FC+1.3); UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (FC+1.5)). Responses in purine metabolism (Adenine (FC+2);lactoperoxidase (FC-1.8)) and phospholipid metabolism (lysine (FC+2.59); diacylglycerol kinase beta (FC-1.14) were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: We have characterised an interactome map of BeWo cell response to hyperglycemia which revealed metabolic pathways with known, as well as potentially novel, relevance to placental dysfunction associated with DM. Further understanding of signaling within these pathways may lead to identification of new targets for therapeutic intervention.",

There is no literature regarding neonatal outcomes associated with low placenta weight (LPW). We hypothesize within an LPW sample, a proportion will have BW and fetoplacental weight ratios (FPR) within normal range and no placental pathology. These \"constitutionally small\" infants are predicted to have no neonatal risks. We predict second group of babies with growth restriction proportionate to placental pathology, and a third group of babies overly large for placental size (high FPR). We predict Group 2 (pathologically small) would have increased neonatal risks and that Group 3 (high FPR) will also be at risk, although the risks may not be identical. METHODS: At NYMH all placentas are submitted for pathology examination. Using criteria for the 10 th and 5 th centiles of placental weight at term, we collected LPW placentas measured after trimming of membranes and umbilical cord at 37-41 weeks gestation. Exclusion criteria:multiple gestation, intrauterine fetal demise, extramural delivery and congenital anomalies. Maternal and neonatal records extracted for parity, height and weight and complications including diabetes, preeclampsia and admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Contingency tables and nonparametric and parametric tests of continuous variables considered p<0.05 as significant. RESULTS: 70 cases (8% total births) met criteria from January 2013-February 2013. Maternal BMI at delivery was 29.6 + 6.2, BW centile 27+ 18 (median 25), FPR 8.0 + 0.9, and ponderal index 2.8 +/-0.4. One (1.4%) were diagnosed preeclamptic (hospital rate 2%) and 5.7% and 1 (1.4%) were diagnosed as gestational and pregestational diabetic, respectively (hospital rate 4%). 71% of the population had no placental pathology, e.g. no chronic placental inflammation, maternal or fetal vascular pathology. Maternal BMI uncorrelated with PW, FPR or PI. 50% with multiple placental pathology were admitted to the NICU. CONCLUSIONS: We predicted LPW group would be enriched for preeclampsia and selected against diabetes. Neither prediction was valid. Despite LPW, the mean PI was \"high\", providing little support for \"placental insufficiency\" despite LPW. Additionally, FPR was at the 75 th -90 th centile despite high PI/ increased newborn fatness. Our sample showed median BW centile at the 25 th when PW is <10 th centile. A larger sample will give us better understanding of the fetoplacental environment and neonatal outcomes.",

INTRODUCTION: Inhibition of Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) attenuates uterine vascular adaptation (remodeling and reactivity) in pregnancy; although it is unknown whether this is directly due to reduced NO signaling, or an indirect result of hypertension. Also, some evidence exists that the vascular effects of NO may be mediated by mechanisms other than the canonical sGC-cGMP-PKG pathway. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that direct stimulation of Guanylate Cyclase (sGC) in the presence of NOS inhibition restores normal gestational adaptations (vascular remodeling and reactivity). A second aim was to determine whether restoration of adaptive changes is achieved by treatment with an antihypertensive. METHODS: In addition to pregnant controls (C: n=11), pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with L-NAME alone to induce NOS inhibition (L: n=14), or co-treated with either BAY41-2272 (L+B: a sGC stimulator; n=9) or diltiazem (L+D: a calcium channel blocker; n=9) during the second half of gestation (days 10-20). Measurements included mean arterial pressure (MAP) on day 15, as well as main uterine artery (MUA) and arcuate artery diameters, and pup weights on day 20/22. Arcuate arteries were dissected, mounted in an arteriograph, preconstricted with phenylephrine, and exposed to increasing concentrations of a NO donor (DETA/NO) to evaluate vessel reactivity. RESULTS: Co-treatment with BAY41-2272 and with diltiazem prevented hypertension (C: 96\u00b15.4 mmHg; L: 129\u00b12.8 mmHg*; L+B: 94\u00b12.4 mmHg*; L+D: 96\u00b12.9 mmHg*;* =p<0.05 vs. C). MUA outward remodeling was fully restored by sGC stimulation but not by BP normalization with diltiazem (C: 228\u00b110 \u00b5m; L: 172\u00b112 \u00b5m*; L+B: 222\u00b17 \u00b5m; L+D: 170\u00b112 \u00b5m*). A similar pattern was seen with arcuate artery remodeling. Pup weights were lower in the L and L+D groups, whereas the L+B group trended toward normalization (C: 2.43\u00b10.02 g; L: 2.20\u00b10.04 g*; L+B: 2.26\u00b10.04 g; L+D: 2.22\u00b10.07 g*). Vessels from both L and L+D rats showed increased sensitivity to DETA/NO compared to controls (EC 50 values: C: 35\u00b13.6 \u00b5M; L: 12\u00b15.2 \u00b5M*; L+D: 6\u00b12.1 \u00b5M*), while the L+B group showed an intermediate response(EC 50 value: L+B: 16\u00b17.2 \u00b5M; p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Abrogation of structural and functional uterine vascular adaptation in the presence of NOS-inhibition is primarily due to a loss of NO signaling rather than systemic hypertension, and is reversed by direct sGC stimulation.",

INTRODUCTION: Maternal circulating angiogenic factors have been well described in preeclampsia (PE). Their role in intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR) is less well defined. We evaluated the levels of pro-and anti-angiogenic factors in PE and IUGR. Their potential as biomarkers in distinguishing normal from pathological pregnancies was evaluated. METHODS: A prospective case control study was conducted on singleton pregnancies. Patients were recruited into four clinical groups: (1) Normal pregnancy (N) (n=29); (2) PE ( n = 15) , (3) PE+IUGR (n=16), (4) IUGR only (n=24). PE was defined as de novo systolic blood pressure (BP) \u2265140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP \u2265 90 mmHg on \u22652 occasions > 4 hours apart and proteinuria (300 mg/day or a spot urine protein to creatinine ratio \u2265 30mg/ mmol). IUGRwas defined as birth weight <10th centile with umbilical artery Doppler S/D or RI>95th centile. Maternal plasma concentrations of placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble fms like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), soluble kinase domain receptor (sKDR) and soluble Endoglin (sEng) as well as fetal umbilical artery sFlt-1 levels were determined with ELISA. One way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis non parametric equivalent was used to test for differences in the distribution by group. ROC curves were used to quantify the global performance of each individual marker and their ratios in terms of predicting normal versus complicated pregnancies affected by preeclampsia and/or intrauterine fetal growth restriction. RESULTS: Angiogenic profiles howing elevated sFlt-1, sEng and reduced PlGF, sKDR were observed in PE, PE+IUGR and IUGR only groups. However, sEng was significantly elevated in PE+IUGR compared to all other groups. sEng as a single marker and sFlt-1*sEng/PlGF as a composite marker appeared to have the best potential to differentiate pathological pregnancies from normal pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: PE and isolated IUGR of placental origin have broadly similar pro and anti-angiogenic profiles. However, in our cohort sEng levels will predict if a preeclamptic pregnancy will be complicated by IUGR. sEndoglin should be further evaluated as part of a biomarker profile for predicting PE+IUGR. The observation that sKDR, a traditional \"anti-angiogenic\" factor is reduced in PE and IUGR requires further investigation.",

INTRODUCTION: Endocrine gland derived-VEGF (EG-VEGF) is a new placental angiogenic factor. We have recently shown that this factor plays a major role in placental development. To date, we have demonstrated that EG-VEGF i) and its receptors, PROKR1 and PROKR2 are abundantly expressed in the human placenta ii) controls extravillous trophoblast invasion and promotes placental angiogenesis iii) expression is up regulated by hypoxia, iv) circulating levels are the highest during the first trimester of pregnancy, and are increased in preeclampsia (PE). Taken together these data suggested that maintenance of EG-VEGF over the first trimester of pregnancy might cause PE . METHODS: We tested this hypothesis in a mouse model (EG-VEGF expression peaks at day 10.5 of gestation). Osmotic minipumps were inserted subcutaneously into timed pregnant OF1 mice on day 11.5. The pumps were loaded to continuously deliver either vehicle (control group) or EG-VEGF (0.7\u00b5g/day). Mice were sacrificed at day 15.5 and the following parameters were assessed; i) Litter size, placental and fetal weight, ii) Placental immunohistochemistry and histology (vascularization, degree of trophoblast invasion), iii) degree of placental hypoxia, iv) maternal blood pressure, v) renal histology and function and vi) measurement of, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFLT1). RESULTS: Our data show that EG-VEGF treated mice developed symptoms of severe PE. The mice developed hypertension, proteinuria, and elevated levels of sFLT1. These symptoms were associated with significant defects in placental function and organization. There was maintenance of placental hypoxia, along with an abnormal trophoblast invasion. Glomerelosclerosis and proteinuria were observed in the kidneys. Treatment of male mice with the same doses of EG-VEGF for the same duration did not show any effects of EG-VEGF on kidney function suggesting that EG-VEGF effects in the gravid mice were secondary to its primary effects on the placenta. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether these data bring strong evidence for direct effects of EG-VEGF on placental development and suggest that deregulations in the expression of EG-VEGF might be associated with PE. Hence EG-VEGF levels could be used as a biomarker of PE development.",

Obs&Gyn, Maastricht University Medical Centre, Maastricht, Netherlands. INTRODUCTION: Abnormal placentation is implicated in the etiology of preeclampsia (PE). Placental ultrasound in PE frequently suggests abnormal structure and thickness. There is little literature on the significance of hypoechoic lesions in the placenta, known as placental lakes (PL). We aimed to conduct a literature review on ultrasound abnormalities of placental structure. We summarize lesion characteristics and the correlation to pregnancy outcome and placental histology. METHODS: We searched abstracts from various databases on \"placental lakes\", \"placental ultrasound\", \"adverse pregnancy outcome\", \"placental pathology\" and their alternative MeSH terms. Additional abstracts were obtained by cross-referencing. RESULTS: From a total of 90 reviewed abstracts, 71 were excluded for irrelevance to the research question or unavailability as full text. PL were defined as homogenous, sonolucent vascular spaces of \u22652x2cm. Other popular terms used included echogenic cystic lesions (ECL) and hypoechogenic lesions. The minumum largest diameter for PL to be considered significant varied between 0,5-5cm. The general incidence of PL on antenatal scans ranged widely and was 3-27%. in high risk pregnancies (such as placenta insufficiency). Most articles used a gestational age of 18-22 weeks in scanning for PL. Adverse pregnancy outcome was frequently correlated to the size of PL. Abnormal placental structure, and specifically PL, was associated with an increase in preterm delivery (RR 2.3) and low birth weight (RR 2.0). PL were more common in patient who had first trimester vaginal bleeding and fetal acidosis in PE. In combination with abnormal placental structure, abnormal uterine artery Doppler was strongly predictive of stillbirth (sensitivity 81), and abnormal maternal serum AFP of placental abruption (RR 9.0). Woman with normal placental profile had a decreased risk for placental syndromes. The finding of PL predicted intervillous thrombosis on histology with 50% sensitivity of and PPV of 25%, and predicted villous infarcts with 37% sensitivity and 63% PPV. Localization wires during postpartum placental scan increased the pathological detection rate to 89%. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable heterogeneity in literature on interpreting the ultrasound finding of PL. Larger lesions especially in combination with abnormal placental function tests is associated with placental insufficiency. Histologically, these lesions correspond to intervillous thrombosis and villous infarcts. INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy complications that lead to perinatal morbidity and mortality, such as pre-eclampsia (PE), are largely resistant to prophylaxis and new therapeutic options are needed. Anti-angiogenic proteins from the oxidatively stressed placenta during PE promote maternal endothelial dysfunction, long postulated to be central to its pathogenesis. We have identified a novel link between abnormal early placental and endothelial dysfunction associated with PE based on the complement of TXA 2 receptor isoforms expressed. METHODS: A mixture of biochemical (ELISA, western blotting), molecular (PCR), histological (IHC) and cell biology (proliferation, angiogenesis, migration) assays, as well as in vivo mouse models, were used to characterize the role of TXA 2 receptor isoforms (TPa, TPb) in the pathogenesis of PE. RESULTS: TPb was absent in normal placental tissues but strongly expressed in PE placentae using IHC, whereas TPa expression was similar. TPb expression was independent of the severity of the PE (pre-or post-34 weeks onset) or the presence/absence of growth restriction. This is exciting as the two known ligands of TPb (TXA 2 and isoprostanes) are elevated in PE and linked to its pathogenesis. We have demonstrated that TPb activation reduces angiogenesis (83\u00b113%) and promotes endothelial dysfunction through ablation of VEGF signalling, NO production and promotion of endothelial activation (5 fold increase in ICAM-1 and 10 fold for VCAM and E-selectin). We now show that TPb expression on trophoblasts impairs migration (40\u00b112%), proliferation (3\u00b1.6 fold) and differentiation (50\u00b112%) consistent with the phenotypes observed in PE. Moreover, our transgenic mice (TPb-Tg; over express TPb) are a robust model of PE. Pregnant TPb-Tg mice spontaneously develop hypertension (20\u00b17 mmHg rise) in the second half of pregnancy, a mild proteinuria (3\u00b10.51 fold), elevated circulating levels of soluble Flt-1 (7\u00b1 1.5 fold) and robust placental expression of MMP14 (5\u00b10.68 fold). Moreover, the pups display a 30\u00b112% decrease in size confirming the previous reports of IUGR. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data strongly implicate TPb in the endothelial damage and poor placentation associated with PE. These data refine our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of PE and create a platform for development of new therapies to reduce the impact of PE on maternal and fetal health.",

INTRODUCTION: Placenta growth factor (PlGF), a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor subfamily, is expressed mainly by trophoblast cells and may serve as a possible biomarker for placental related disorders (preeclampsia and IUGR). In order to evaluate whether PlGF concentrations are regulated by fetal well-being, we investigated PlGF concentrations in maternal circulation before and after acute fetal distress induced by feticide. METHODS: Blood samples were drawn prospectively between January and July 2012, before and after feticide at predetermined time points (0, 30, 60 and 120 minutes). Placental vitality was monitored by measuring LDH concentrations in maternal circulation. PlGF concentrations were measured by standard human ELISA. RESULTS: Six pregnant women were included in the study. Following the procedure (60 and 120 minutes) PlGF concentrations decreased significantly compared to the concentration before feticide (reduced by 23.8%\u00b14.6 and 24.2%\u00b112.2 of the concentration before feticide, respectively, P<0.01).",

INTRODUCTION: Identification of women at risk of developing placentally-mediated adverse outcomes is a priority in obstetrical care. Within a group of high risk women, the ability to predict who will develop an adverse outcome would have clinical utility. We evaluated the performance of circulating angiogenic factors measured in the second trimester to predict placentally-mediated outcomes in a high-risk pregnancy cohort. METHODS: Plasma was collected from women with an unexplained abnormal serum screen result and/or pre-eclampsia /IUGR/stillbirth in a previous pregnancy (high-risk cohort). Placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt) and endoglin (Eng) were measured. The performance of each analyte to predict a placentallymediated outcome (early-onset PET (<34wks), IUGR (AC<10 th centile for GA on ultrasound and birthweight<10 th centile), stillbirth, abruption) was evaluated. Women who devloped no complications (term delivery, appropriately grown fetus, n=133) served as controls and their marker concentrations were used to derive 5 th centile (PlGF) and 95 th centile (sFlt, Eng) cutoffs for a positive test result.

Multivariable modeling with PlGF, clinical risk factors and Doppler may improve the prediction of placentally-mediated outcomes in this high-risk cohort. EVT can be captured from the endocervical canal in a non-invasive procedure similar to a PAP test and isolated free of maternal cells. We hypothesize that serum biomarkers of IUGR and PE are dysregulated in EVT earlier in gestation than their altered levels can be detected in serum. METHODS: PAP specimens were collected at 5-20 weeks of gestation using a cytobrush. Medical records were later searched for diagnosis of PE or IUGR. EVT cells (500-1500) were isolated from a selected cohort of specimens (N=23) using HLA-G antibody coupled to magnetic nanoparticles. Cells (~50) were affixed to slides using a Cytospin 3 cytocentrifuge, assessed for purity with anti-b-hCG, and labeled by immunofluorescence with antibodies (R&D Systems) against galectin 13 (LGALS13, a.k.a.

Furthermore, the longitudinal study of placental markers in women with CHT is limited. Our aim was to assess changes with gestation in neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), B-Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and Placental Growth Factor (PlGF) in women with CHT compared with healthy controls, in order to identify potential predictive markers of superimposed pre-eclampsia, and/or mechanistic insight into underlying pathophysiology. METHODS: Longitudinal samples were taken at 12-14, 18-20 and 26-28 weeks' gestation from women with CHT and healthy controls. Superimposed pre-eclampsia was defined as the new development of proteinuria >30mg/mmol creatinine, or >300mg/24 hours after 20 weeks' gestation. Plasma concentrations of NGAL, BNP and PlGF were analysed with Alere Triage\u00ae System. P<0.05 was considered to be significant. RESULTS: 89 women with CHT and 91 healthy controls were included. Fourteen women with CHT developed superimposed pre-eclampsia. NGAL concentrations were significantly higher in all timepoints in women with CHT than healthy controls but did not change with gestation (12-14w:65.8\u00b126.5v57.0\u00b120.1ng/ml; 18-20w:71.4\u00b128.1v59.0\u00b119.4ng/ ml; 26-28w:67.4\u00b128.3v59.8\u00b128.7ng/ml), and BNP concentrations at 18-20 (16.2\u00b110.3v18.5\u00b19.7pg/ml) and 26-28 weeks' gestation (13.0\u00b19.2v14.9\u00b17.5pg/ml) were significantly lower in women with CHT compared to controls, but neither marker was associated subsequent superimposed pre-eclampsia. There was no difference in PlGF concentration between women with CHT who did not develop superimposed pre-eclampsia, and healthy controls. However, PlGF was significantly lower at 26-28 weeks in women with CHT who later developed superimposed pre-eclampsia compared with those who did not develop the condition (143.0\u00b1104.3v258.8\u00b1176.7pg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: NGAL and BNP in pregnant women with CHT are higher and lower respectively than controls, but neither are predictive of superimposed pre-eclampsia. PlGF at 26-28 weeks' was lower in women with CHT who subsequently developed superimposed pre-eclampsia, than women with CHT who did not. (2012) reported, primarily in endothelial cells, that oxysterols (upregulated with hypoxia) increase soluble endoglin (sEng) production, a key antiangiogenic factor central to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. They demonstrated that this was via binding of oxysterols to the Liver X Receptor (LXR). We characterised LXR in severe early onset preeclamptic placenta and assessed whether oxysterols regulate sEng production in primary placental tissues.",

Excitingly we confirmed an increase in MMP 14 and a significant decrease in TIMP 3 (inhibitor of MMP 14) mRNA expression following oxysterol treatment in primary cells. CONCLUSIONS: LXR is upregulated in preeclamptic placental tissue. Furthermore, oxysterols are able to increase MMP 14 and reduce its inhibitor TIMP 3 in primary placental tissues, and increase sEng. This data suggests that oxysterols may play a major role in the regulation of sEng production in severe preeclampsia. (Ang II) , a potent vasopressor. Despite this, blood pressure is maintained. This is due, in part, to vascular insensitivity to Ang II. In contrast, women with preeclampsia (PE) have decreased circulating levels of Ang II, yet are hypersensitive to its' actions. Recent evidence from our laboratory and others have provided evidence that altered circulating anti-angiogenic state mediated by placental secretion of anti-angiogenic factors such as sVEGFR1 (also referred to as sFlt1) can explain the maternal syndrome of preeclampsia. We hypothesize that sFlt1 may directly induce Ang II sensitivity and that this may be related to alterations of the angiotensin II receptors (AT1) in the vasculature. METHODS: Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored continuously using radiotelemetry. Ang II response was tested in female CD-1 mice by bolus injection of 30ng (1ng/ul) intravenous as non-pregnant, then at gestation day (gd) 10, 14, 17 and post-partum. A mouse model of PE used adenoviral overexpression of sFlt1 to determine the effect of excessive sFlt1 on Ang II. Angiotensin receptor bias was examined in tissues via RT-PCR. RESULTS: Prior to pregnancy, all mice responded to bolus Ang II with ~25mmHg rise in mean arterial pressure (MAP) over 15 minutes. In the same mice when pregnant, the response to Ang II infusion is blunted at gd10, but then becomes refractory at gd14 (P<0.05 for MAP and HR).",

These data suggest that the underlying mechanism of autonomic activation is associated with endothelial dysfunction and not to placental insufficiency. Pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction are attributed to placental abnormalities. Therapeutic interventions for such conditions do not currently exist; a major barrier to their development is the risk of sideeffects caused by systemic delivery. Peptide-mediated targeting of nanocarriers to the placenta may provide a means to avoid such sideeffects. We have identified two novel placental-specific homing peptides and coupled them to liposomes. Here we investigate the time course of liposomal targeting and tissue distribution in a pregnant mouse model. METHODS: Liposomes were synthesised by lipid film hydration of DSPC (325mM), cholesterol (150mM), DSPE-PEG (25mM) and DSPE-PEG-maleimide (2.5mM), and were extruded to form liposomes of approximately 140nm diameter. Fluorescent targeting peptides were covalently coupled to free maleimide groups on the liposomal surface; unbound peptide was removed by dialysis. Time-mated C57/BJ6 mice (E15.5) were intravenously injected with 100mL of peptide-conjugated liposome suspension, which were allowed to circulate for 6, 24 or 48h. Mice were then sacrificed by cardiac perfusion to remove unbound peptide. The placentas, fetuses and maternal organs were collected, fixed in formalin, embedded in OCT, cryosectioned and visualised by fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Targeted liposomes (TL) were observed throughout the placental labyrinth and within maternal uterine blood vessels, specifically the spiral arteries. Co-localisation of both the peptide (red) and the liposome (green) was observed, with signal being greatest in the labyrinth at 6h, with some reduction in peptide signal by 24h and a vast reduction in both peptide and liposome by 48h. TL were not observed in the maternal heart, lung, brain or fetuses. TL were seen in the liver and spleen at 6h; the fluorescent signal was decreased by 24h and 48h.",

Obstetrics and Gynecology, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virginia, USA. INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia is a serious disease of pregnancy, causing fetal and maternal complications. Studies have reported increased reactive oxygen species in placentas of preeclamptic pregnancies. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible enzyme that makes prostaglandins in inflammation. Nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activates COX-2. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a neutrophil chemotactic agent that is expressed in the peripheral tissues of preeclamptic pregnancies. Because oxidative stress may be a key factor in preeclampsia, and preeclampsia resolves after the removal of products of conception, it follows that the placenta may be a location of inflammation. METHODS: Placental blocks were identified and classified into three groups. The negative control group included ten blocks from women who had a scheduled cesarean delivery and did not experience labor. The positive control group included ten blocks from women diagnosed with chorioamnionitis. The study group included ten blocks from patients with severe preeclampsia at term, did not labor, and had a cesarean delivery.",

Baseline COX-2 expression was brightly expressed in the positive control and preeclamptic group. Staining intensity of the positive control and preeclamptic group were significantly higher than the negative control. NF-kB staining of the positive control was significant compared to negative control, however preeclamptic staining of NF-kB was not significantly different.

COX-2 produces a precursor for thromboxane A 2 , a vasoconstrictor, which has been shown to be upregulated in the systemic circulation of severe preeclamptics. Expression of NF-kB was not increased in severe preeclampsia, indicating that COX-2 may be regulated by another factor in syncytiotrophoblasts. IL-8 expression was also not increased in severe preeclampsia, suggesting neutrophil recruitment to the fetomaternal junction may not be a component in severe preeclampsia. and VEGF-C were assayed using ELISA. Maternal demographics, pregnancy and fetal/neonatal outcomes were collected by chart review. Serum angiogenin and VEGF-C were assayed using ELISA and the results were compared between patients with normal and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pre-eclampsia, IUGR, spontaneous preterm birth, placental abruption, or stillbirth. Mean serum angiogenin and VEGF-C concentrations were compared using a two-tailed t-test, with p<0.05 being considered significant. Subgroups were compared using non-parametric ANOVA (significant p<0.05), or Mann-Whitney test (significant p <0.01). RESULTS: Serum angiogenin was significantly higher in women who went on to develop any adverse placental outcome (394.9 \u00b1 10.5 ng/ml) than those with normal outcomes (365.6 \u00b1 6.7 ng/ml). When adverse outcomes were subdivided, differences amongst the means remained statistically significant (p=0.009). Women who later developed severe pre-eclampsia (p=0.0108) or spontaneous preterm labour (p=0.0068) had significantly higher levels of angiogenin than those with normal outcomes. There was no significant difference between those with normal outcomes and those with mild pre-eclampsia. Serum VEGF-C did not differ significantly between the normal and adverse placental outcome groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that second trimester serum angiogenin is increased prior to the onset of clinical disease, in women who develop adverse placental outcomes, particularly severe pre-eclampsia and spontaneous preterm labour. This suggests that angiogenin may be a marker of abnormal placental angiogenesis.",

PE was defined by ACOG criteria and was independently validated by a physician panel. UTI was defined by the presence of clinical symptoms necessitating treatment in addition to supportive laboratory evidence. Multivariate logistic regression models controlled for maternal age, race, parity, BMI, hypertensive, diabetic, IVF, and smoking status. RESULTS: 129 women were diagnosed with UTIs and 235 with PE. Patients with UTI in pregnancy had higher rates of PE (31.1% vs 7.8%, p <0.001) compared to those without reported UTI.

There was no pattern of change in bFGF, C3a or C5a unique to preeclampsia. Urinary C5b-9 correlated strongly with angiogenic imbalance in preeclampsia. Increased urinary excretion of C5b-9 correlated with: 1) increased plasma sFLT-1 (r=0.66, p<0.0001); 2) decreased plasma VEGF (r=-0.39, p=0.0007) and; 3) decreased PlGF in both plasma and urine (r=-0.68, p<0.0001 and r=-0.44, p=0.0001, respectively).

Chihiro Hirai, Motoi Sugimura, Shintaro Makino, Atsuo Itakura, Satoru Takeda. Obstetrics and Gynecology, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan. INTRODUCTION: Soluble FLT1 (sFLT1) is known to be increased in preeclampsia however its releasing process remains unclear. Serine protease including thrombin and chymotrypsin is related to proteinaseactivity, coagulation system, and cell activity. In the present study, we investigated whether chymotrypsin is involved in the production and secretion of sFLT1 through protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1 and 2. METHODS: After the presence of chymotrypsin activity in the placenta was confi rmed, the term placenta-derived immortalized human trophoblast (TCL-1) cells were cultured with thrombin, a-chymotrypsin, PAR-1 agonist or antagonist, and PAR-2 agonist or antagonist for 1 and 6 hours. Then the secretion of sFLT1 was measured by ELISA and total mRNA of sFLT1 was examined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Thrombin immediately increased expression of sFLT1 mRNA and secretion of sFLT1 through PAR-1. On the other hand, chymotrypsin showed signifi cant induction of sFLT1 production and release trough PAR-1 and 2 comparing with thrombin at 6 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The chymotrypsin emitted due to placental dysfunction may be involved in release sFLT1 through PAR-2 rather than PAR-1. It is reasonable to suggest that chymotrypsin may have original sFLT1 releasing system.",

Furthermore, the addition of follistatin (FS) mitigated the increased expression back down to control levels for all outcomes. Plasma levels of homocysteine, cysteine and cystathionine were analyzed from the same patients during healthy pregnancy or PE. The association of the alleles with PE development was tested with logistic regression, Mann Whithey U test was used to compare plasma values between groups. RESULTS: Severe PE patients less often had the minor allele for rs11203172 (OR[95%CI]=0.46[0.22-0.95]). Mild PE patients more often had the minor allele for rs234706 (4.83[1.30-18.06]). Healthy controls with the minor allele for rs11203172 had increased plasma cysteine levels (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: SNPs in the CBS gene are associated with both decreased (rs11203172) and increased (rs234706) risk to develop PE. Furthermore, healthy pregnant women having the minor allele for rs11203172, a protective allele, have decreased cysteine levels. This may be due to an increased conversion of cysteine to H 2 S by CBS. As a result these women might have higher H 2 S levels, positively affecting placentation and vascular function during pregnancy and decreasing their risk to develop PE. Much recent work has attempted to identify biomarkers that can be measured early in pregnancy to predict the later onset of preeclampsia (PE). Circulating maternal levels of angiogenic factors, including placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 receptor (sFlt-1), differ between normal pregnancies and those complicated by PE. However, levels of PlGF and sFlt-1 measured at single time-points in pregnancy have been found to lack clinically useful predictive power. We assessed whether longitudinal trends in PlGF and sFlt-1 concentrations across pregnancy might prove more informative. METHODS: Study participants were enrolled during the fi rst trimester at three tertiary care centers. This analysis was restricted to the 2,439 women with singleton pregnancies who delivered after 24 weeks' gestational age. Of these, 193 (7.9%) were diagnosed with PE. PlGF and sFlt-1 were measured at 10, 18, 26, and 35 weeks. Relevant clinical information was obtained by questionnaire or from medical records, and a physician panel validated PE diagnoses. Linear mixed effects models were used to generate random slopes and intercepts for the angiogenic markers over time. Quartiles of the random slopes were then generated and used as predictors in adjusted logistic regression models. RESULTS: After adjusting for maternal age, race, BMI, parity, use of assisted reproductive technology, and gestational diabetes diagnosis, individuals with lowest-quartile slopes in PlGF had 4.8 times greater odds (95% CI: 2.9, 8.1) of being diagnosed with PE when compared to individuals with highest-quartile slopes in PlGF. Looking at sFlt-1, individuals in the highest quartile had 5.2 times greater odds (95% CI: 3.2, 8.5) of being diagnosed with PE when compared to the lowestquartile group. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring trend in circulating angiogenic factors segregates those at increased risk from those at lower risk of PE and suggests that the longitudinal evaluation of angiogenic factor concentrations across pregnancy adds predictive utility.",

INTRODUCTION: Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and Factor VIII (FVIII) are elevated in healthy pregnancy (HP) and furthermore in preeclampsia (PE). We hypothesized pregnancies with severe PE (SPE) have changes in other VWF-associated parameters. METHODS: SPE subjects were compared with subjects from a HP repository at similar gestational ages. We tested plasma VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), VWF propeptide (VWF:pp), and FVIII antigen (FVIII:Ag) by ELISA. Factor VIII activity (FVIII:C) was measured using a one-stage assay. Activity of ADAMTS13 was determined by enzyme-linked peptide substrate cleavage. RESULTS: Forty-two SPE subjects and 39 HP controls were eligible. There was no difference in maternal or gestational ages between the cohorts. SPE subjects had higher VWF:Ag, VWF:pp, and FVIII:Ag compared the HP control cohort (p<0.001). FVIII:Ag and FVIII:C were similar, therefore FVIII:Ag was used for all analyses. The VWF:FVIII ratio trended higher in SPE (p=0.058). The ADAMTS13 activity in SPE was lower than HP controls (p<0.001).",

VWF:FVIII ratios trended higher in SPE, while the activity of the VWF-cleaving protease, ADAMTS13, was modestly but significantly decreased. Two subjects with thrombocytopenia (<50 x 10 9 /L) had ADAMTS13 activities >85%, indicating the thrombocytopenia was not due to a TTP-like microangiopathy. We conclude patients with SPE exhibit VWF biology that is distinct from HP. These changes likely reflect the perturbed endothelial state in PE, and may contribute to or perpetuate vascular pathogenesis. Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are a common cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality in low-and middle-income countries. The treatment of choice for both prevention and treatment of eclampsia is magnesium sulfate. Although known to be lifesaving, the administration of IV magnesium sulfate can be technically challenging and cumbersome requiring additional supplies and close monitoring. The easier IM route is disadvantaged by the pain of injection. However, the addition of lidocaine would lessen this pain, providing a more tolerable and accessible route of administration appropriate for widespread use.",

We have developed an unbiased technique to adapt readily available ultrasound (US) and neonatal information to examine longitudinal trends in fetal growth as a function of pregnancy characteristics. We demonstrate the technique by examining differences in fetal growth trajectories from mothers with normal pregnancy compared to those with severe preeclampsia (sPE). METHODS: Between 2007 and 2012, 37,640 live, singleton, nonanomalous pregnancies underwent first trimester US, second trimester fetal survey and ultimate live delivery at our center. Crown-rump length (CRL) was obtained at the first trimester screening and standard fetal anthropometrics were obtained at the survey, which were combined into a summary size estimate (SE) using Hadlock's formula. We then calculated reference means and standard deviations for US metrics and birth weight (BW) by individual week of gestation: CRL (week 5-14); SE (week 15-23); and BW (week 24-42). To demonstrate the utility of this reference, we also created Z-scores for CRL, SE, and BW for 706 singleton live births delivered in our study cohort in 2012.

Longitudinal analysis demonstrated a constant difference in the trajectories of these two groups across pregnancy (B=-0.81, 95%CI=-1.24, -0.37, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: By creating a standard for US measurements and birth weights, we present a technique for examining longitudinal trends in fetal growth as a function of pregnancy characteristics. We demonstrate that for pregnancies ultimately complicated by sPE, fetal growth is already poor in the first trimester and remains so through birth. We believe this technique can assist in identifying windows of fetal growth vulnerability as a function of other less understood maternal pregnancy characteristics and exposures. LGA neonates are at increased risk of obesity throughout life. Adherence to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) GWG recommendations attenuates maternal-fetal obstetrical risk. In Canada, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) recommend a more conservative upper limit of gain (i.e., 7kg) for patients with obesity compared to IOM (i.e., 9kg). We aimed to compare the effects of eGWG for patients with obesity using IOM and SOGC guidelines. METHODS: From the Ottawa and Kingston (OaK) birth cohort a total of 699 mothers with obesity (BMI\u226530) and their infants were used to examine the independent effect of eGWG with respect to IOM and SOGC recommendations. Multivariate logistic regression (controlling for gestational and maternal age, prepregnancy weight, parity, smoking) were performed and odds ratios (ORs) calculated. RESULTS: Only 28.5% (199/699) and 20.9% (146/699) of women met IOM and SOGC GWG targets, respectively. Adjusting for smoking, parity, age, maternal height and achieving guideline-specific recommended GWG, pregravid obesity was associated with higher rates of LGA using both IOM (OR 2.47; 95% CI 1.94-3.14, p<0.01) and SOGC (OR 2.34; 95% CI 1.83-3.00, p<0.01) recommendations compared to women with normal BMI. However, a 6% increased likelihood of LGA was demonstrated with the IOM compared to SOGC guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with obesity, eGWG with respect to IOM and SOGC guidelines strongly increase a woman's chance of having a larger baby. In this dataset, the more conservative SOGC guideline for obese patients yielded a 6% decrease likelihood of giving birth to a LGA neonate relative to the IOM recommendations. On a population level, more conservative GWG recommendations for patients with obesity may yield a substantial reduction in fetal overgrowth. Strategies that increase patient uptake of GWG guidelines are urgently needed. The rising prevalence of gastroschisis worldwide is a global health concern. The objective of this study was to determine if gastroschisis is a result of poor maternal nutrition, environmental exposures to alcohol and/or vasoactive stimulants. METHODS: A matched case-control study was designed, with enrollment of singleton pregnancies at time of gastroschisis (G) diagnosis. Controls(C) were matched by race and age. Demographics, periconceptual exposures, nutritional biomarkers and illicit drug hair analysis were evaluated. Data analysis was by Chi-square, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel, and conditional logistic regression, with data reported as mean, percent, standard deviation, Odds Ratio (OR), and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) as appropriate. RESULTS: Thirty-eight gastroschisis cases and 76 controls matched for age and race were enrolled. Mean age was 22.17years+/-4.52 years (range 15-34 years), with diverse ethnicity. There was no difference in education, insurance status, first trimester bleeding , BMI at conception, ferritin, iron, B6, B12, folate, or zinc levels. One-third of both groups smoked or had direct exposure, and history of illicit drug was similar (G9.7% vs. C9.2%, p0.6) Hair analysis for any illicit drug was positive in G3.23% vs. C13.89%, p0.4. Matched analysis revealed alcohol exposure was significantly associated with gastroschisis (OR3.7, p.05 (CI 2.2, 5.7). Neither BMI nor first trimester tobacco were independent risk factor (tobacco OR 1.43, p.40, 95% CI 0.6, 3.4; BMI OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.11.2). By conditional logistic regression, the effect of alcohol appeared stronger amongst women over 20 (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.3, 22.5), however race had no impact on this relationship. The relationship with alcohol persisted when controlled for either tobacco (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.0, 11) and when controlled for both tobacco + BMI (OR 3.0 95% CI 1.0, 8.9). CONCLUSIONS: A periconceptual association with alcohol in those pregnancies complicated by gastroschisis was identified. Preconception education programs on alcohol abstinence may result in reversing the rising gastroschisis prevalence worldwide. Confirmation of this association in future studies by objective means is encouraged.",

INTRODUCTION: For the first time in over two decades, the rate of preterm delivery (PTD) has declined in the US. We evaluated temporal changes in twin PTD and examined the extent to which such trends are influenced by obstetrical interventions. METHODS: We utilized the US vital statistics data based on the 2003 revision of birth certificates and restricted the analyses to women that delivered twin live births between 2005 and 2011. PTD was defined as delivery occurring between 24 and 36 weeks. Overall PTD rates and indicated versus spontaneous delivery rates were described by year. The proportion of indicated to spontaneous PTD was also assessed. All analyses were based on the best obstetrical estimate of gestational age. RESULTS: There were 548,099 twin births between 2005 and 2011. During this period, the twin PTD rate declined by 8.3%, with the decline in spontaneous PTDs substantially accounting for this finding in comparison to indicated PTDs (declines of 16.5% versus 9.3%, respectively). In comparison to spontaneous preterm deliveries, indicated preterm deliveries were 2.67-fold higher, and this ratio remained fairly stable during the study period. INTRODUCTION: Birthweight (BW) discordance is predictive of perinatal mortality in twin pregnancies. However, whether it can also predict neonatal morbidity is not fully elucidated. METHODS: The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of birthweight discordance in predicting neonatal morbidity in twin pregnancies. This was a retrospective study of twin pregnancies of known chorionicity from a large regional cohort over five years. Intertwin birthweight discordance was related to neonatal morbidity of one or both twins. Analysis was restricted to those delivered at or beyond 34 weeks' gestation. The primary outcome was a neonatal outcome composite consisting of one or more of the following: neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, early onset culture-proven sepsis, stage 2 or 3 necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonray dysplasia, grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, pneumonia, or severe retinopathy of prematurity. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), survival (Kaplan Meier) and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the contribution of weight discordance to neonatal morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 940 twin pregnancies were included. Logistic regression analysis found that BW discordance (OR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.08), gestational age (OR: 0.45, 95% CI 0.38-0.53), but not chorionicity (p=0.24) or individual fetal size percentile (p=0.64), were independently associated with neonatal morbidity. Birthweight discordance of 17% had the highest AUC for the prediction of neonatal morbidity (AUC=0.61; 95% CI:0.56-0.67). The detection rate was 34.2% (95% CI was 26.6-42.5%) for a false positive rate of 13.6% (95% CI 17.0-10.6). The Kaplan Meier analysis between monochorionic and dichorionic twin pregnancies shows no significant difference in the morbidity trend between the two categories. CONCLUSIONS: Birthweight discordance is associated not only with perinatal mortality but also with neonatal morbidity in twin pregnancies born late preterm and at term. However its predictive value appears to be limited. We have previously shown a decrease in mortality in women following HS-OC compared to age matched referents. This mortality reduction was statistically significant for lung cancer deaths. This study attempted to assess why these women had decreased lung cancer mortality. METHODS: Our original cohort included 3,816 women who underwent HS-OC for benign indications from 1/1/1965-12/31/2002 in Olmsted County MN. Their referents were age-matched women who had not undergone hysterectomy as of the index year. We conducted a nested case-control study within our original HS-OC cohort. Cases were 41 women who had HS-OC and developed lung cancer. Controls for each case were two age matched women with HS-OC who did not develop lung cancer (n=82). Data were abstracted from medical records. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Cases were more likely to be smokers and smoked for a longer duration than controls. The odds of exposure to ERT in cases was 0.44 times compared to controls. The inverse association with ERT was stronger in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen receptors have been detected in lung cancer, thus estrogen may be involved in tumorogenesis. Our findings suggest that among women who underwent HS-OC, not only smoking but also the absence of ERT is associated with increased odds of dying from lung cancer. This association deserves further investigation. (CS) has been reported to increase the risk of childhood type 1 diabetes (T1D). The gut microbiota have been proposed to play a significant role in this association. We investigated the association between mode of delivery and T1D, and if the association remains after accounting for familial confounding using sibling-matched design.",

T1D diagnoses before age 15 years were identified from the Swedish Hospital Register using ICD-8 (250), ICD-9 (250) and ICD-10 (E10). Information on mode of delivery and potential confounders was retrieved from the Medical Birth Register. Mode of delivery was categorized into spontaneous vaginal birth (reference group), instrumental vaginal birth (IVD), emergency CS and elective CS. The statistical analysis was conducted in two steps. First, log-linear Poisson regression was used for cohort analysis adjusting for offspring age and calendar year as time dependent variables, maternal diabetes and gestational age. Adjustment for several other variables including maternal education, body mass index and major pregnancy complications did not change the results. Second, to account for unmeasured familial confounding, such as home environment and life style, and partly for genetic factors, sibling-matched analyses were conducted using multivariate conditional logistic regression. In this analysis siblings who were discordant for both mode of delivery and T1D were included. RESULTS: In the cohort analyses (N=2,755,074), there was an association between T1D and elective CS (RR=1.15[95% CI: 1.1-1.30]) and IVD (RR=1.14[1.1-1.2]). However, there was no association between emergency CS and T1D (RR=1.02[0.9-1.1]). In sibling-matched analyses, the RRs for elective CS (RR=1.07[0.8-1.5]) and IVD (RR=0.99[0.8-1.2]) were no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: There is a small association between elective CS and IVD and childhood T1D. However, the sibling-matched results suggest that these findings are not consistent with a causal effect of mode of delivery on the risk of T1D and may be due to unmeasured confounding such as home environment. We aimed to investigate the association between gestational age and the risk of childhood type 1 diabetes (T1D), and if the association remains after accounting for familial confounding using sibling-matched design.",

Gestational age and the potential confounders were retrieved from the Medical Birth Register. Gestational age was categorized as follows: very preterm <33 weeks; preterm 33-36 weeks; early term 37-38 weeks; term 39-40 weeks (reference group) and postterm 41+ weeks. The statistical analysis was conducted in two steps.

RESULTS: In the cohort analyses (N=3,628,980), there was a reduced risk of childhood T1D among very preterm (RR=0.70, [95% CI:0.6-0.9]) and post-term children (RR=0.87[0.8-0.9]). The estimates were similar in the sibling design analysis although became non-statistically significant. Children born preterm (RR=1.17[1.1-1.3]) or early term (RR=1.11[1.1-1.2]) had an increased risk of childhood T1D and the association remained significant when sibling-matched analysis was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm birth and early term births are associated with a small increased risk of T1D in Swedish children. The findings are consistent with a causal association and therefore have important public health implications considering the increasing number of preterm and early term births and the significant burden of T1D. We matched them to control women of the same age who did not have prior H-OC. Using a case-control design, we compared CV risk factors (diabetes, hyperlipidemia, HTN, obesity, and metabolic syndrome) and events (myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) and stroke) that occurred prior to H-OC. RESULTS: All risk factors for CVD except diabetes were higher in the H-OC group. In contrast, CV events prior to H-OC were similar between groups. Long-term effects of unilateral oophorectomy (UO) on disease outcomes are understudied, despite the growing evidence that bilateral oophorectomy at younger ages has detrimental effects. Our goal was to investigate morbidity after UO, in particular the risk of metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project records-linkage system, we identified all women who underwent UO with or without hysterectomy between 1950 and 1987 in Olmsted County, MN. Women with UO were compared to an age and calendar year matched referent cohort. Morbidity was determined using diagnostic codes from medical records in the records-linkage system and from death certificates. Women with pre-existing metabolic syndrome were excluded from analyses. Results are shown in strata by concurrent hysterectomy status, age at UO, indication for UO (medical indication for UO or no medical indication) and pathology (abnormal includes cancer, endometriosis and benign tumors). We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox proportional hazard ratio models, using age as a time scale. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 32 years, the risk of de novo metabolic syndrome was significantly increased in women who had undergone UO. Risks were higher if UO was performed without hysterectomy, at ages younger than 37 years, and without medical indication. Normal pathology was associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. ",

Further research is needed to clarify the long-term effects of UO, particularly in younger women. Depression is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Women who suffer from preeclampsia (PE) are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity later in life. We hypothesised that women with increased Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores during pregnancy would have an increased risk of developing PE. We also examined whether these associations were age dependent. METHODS: We utilised data from 5575 healthy nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies recruited to the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) study, a prospective cohort study. Women were interviewed at 15 and 20 weeks' gestation. Depressed mood was assessed using the EPDS score (range 0-30). EPDS was categorised as A) EPDS <5: unlikely to experience depression post partum B) EPDS 5-9: increased risk of depression in the next year C) EPDS >9: very likely depressed. The association between EPDS categories and PE was examined using logistic regression with robust estimation. To examine the effect of age, the associations were examined in women <30 years of age and \u226530 years of age.",

Height and weight at birth, 3 months, 1, 3, 7 and 10 years was predicted for all individuals using linear spline multilevel models. To strengthen the inference that can be made from our results, we adjusted for measured confounders and compared maternal alcohol use with partner alcohol use during the woman's pregnancy, which is an approach that can partially control for unmeasured confounding. RESULTS: Maternal occasional or light daily drinking during pregnancy was not associated with reduced birth weight or length or adverse growth trajectories up to age 10 in offspring. The infants of maternal heavy drinkers were born 0.78cm shorter -0.78 (95% CI -1.34, -0.22) and 0.22 kg lighter -0.22 (95% CI -0.34, -0.09) than infants of pregnancy abstainers but these differences were overcome with age such that offspring of maternal heavy drinkers were 0.59cm taller 0.59 (95% CI -0.93, 2.11) and 0.41 kg heavier 0.41 (95% CI -0.70, 1.52) by age 10. These associations were not observed for heavy partner drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal occasional or light daily drinking is not associated with birth weight, birth length or postnatal growth up to age 10, but residual confounding may be masking harmful effects. Maternal heavy drinking appears to have an intrauterine effect on reduced offspring birth weight and length that is overcome by increased postnatal growth rates during childhood. Obstetrics and Gynecology departments receive the lowest amount of NIH research funding and have the lowest NIH application success rates. The development of NIH training grants (K awards) and field-specific scholars programs have been one strategy implemented by the NIH to help interested clinicians develop into clinician-scientists. Current systematic reviews of Ob/Gyn training award recipients is lacking in the literature. The purpose of this study is to describe the cohort of Ob/Gyn clinician-scientists who were K award recipients and to identify predictors of success in obtaining an R01 award. We hypothesized that gender, subspecialty, type of K award, and having a PhD would impact R01 success rates. METHODS: K08, K12, and K23 award recipients from 1986-2013 were identified from the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORTER) and the websites of the Reproductive Scientist Development Program (RSDP) and the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Foundation (AAOGF). Data was stratified by gender, educational degree, subspecialty, type of K award, and year of K award. RESULTS: 211 K award recipients were identified. Pre-1992, men were more likely to receive a K award, 56% vs. 44% (p<0.065), while from 2003 onward, women were more likely, 72% vs. 28% (p<0.05). 83% of awardees were MDs, while 17% were MD/PhDs. K12 awards made up 72% of all K awards, while K08 and K23 made up 17% and 11%. Those in Maternal-Fetal Medicine (MFM), Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility (REI), and Gynecology-Oncology (GYN-ONC) represented 84% of all K recipients. GYN-ONCs were the most successful at obtaining K awards from 1998-2002 (31%; p<0.007), while MFMs were the most successful from 2008-2013 (51%; p< 0.039). Overall, 35/211 (17%) of K recipients were successful at obtaining an R01 award. Among those who received a R01, 57% were K12 recipients (p<0.032) and 31% were K08 recipients (p<0.013). There were no significant differences in R01 success rates by gender, educational degree, year of K award or subspecialty. CONCLUSIONS: Gender, subspecialty, and educational degree did not impact an Ob/Gyn trainee's ability to obtain an R01 award. However, K08 and K12 awards were associated with increased R01 success rates. These findings validate the continued need to support K awardees and other clinician-scientist career development programs which enable Ob/ Gyns to make the leap towards achieving independent research funding.",

INTRODUCTION: The FMR1 gene is associated w/ ovarian dysfunction: Premutations (55-199 CGG repeats) are associated with premature ovarian failure (POF), and both \"gray zone\" and high normal repeats (45-54 and 35-44 CGG's, respectively) are associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI; clinical diagnoses of POF and diminished ovarian reserve). Little is known, however, about the CGG distribution in \"normal\" women and whether it varies by ethnicity. METHODS: DNA from women participating in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a US-based cohort of women of varying race/ethnicities was analyzed for FMR1 CGG repeats. From 1996-1998 SWAN enrolled women age 42-52 who had at least 1 menstrual period in last 3 months and belonged to one of the site's designated race/ ethnic groups. Additionally, to be eligible for this study women had to have had at least 1 pregnancy, no history of infertility or hormonal therapy, menopause at age \u226546 years, and have provided DNA for future analyses. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to analyze differences by 5-repeat bands between 35-55 CGG's plus the premutation range; this range was selected based on the associations with POI.",

Only 2 (0.5%) premutation carriers were identified and <2.5% of subjects had a \"gray zone\" allele. The proportion of women with 35-39 CGG repeats varied overall by race (p=0.0002), with the most extreme difference between Blacks (3.7%) and Chinese (19.0%, p=0.033). The proportion of women with 40-44 CGG repeats was borderline significant by race (p=0.055), with the lowest % in Japanese (0%) and highest in Caucasians and Chinese (7.5% and 8.6%, respectively, p=0.019 and 0.024 vs Japanese). CONCLUSIONS: FMR1 premutation carriers are rare (<1%) and women with \"gray zone\" alleles are uncommon (<2.5%) in this normal, fertile, multi-ethnic female population. Comparison cohorts from the literature (<375 women, from Japan, Canada, France) had lower estimates of 35-39 CGG's (3.1-3.7%) and 40-44 CGG's (0-1.0%) than we observed. Our findings highlight the importance of considering race-ethnicity in studies of the FMR1 gene, and the importance of knowing phenotype information of those cohorts in order to arrive at accurate conclusions. Timely initiation of antenatal care is important because it provides the opportunity for prenatal screening and the detection of modifiable risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Almost all prior research on late initiation of antenatal care has focused on individual level predictors. Yet factors on a neighborhood level may also play a role in health care seeking behavior of pregnant non-western women. In this study we investigated the association of neighborhood social capital, neighborhood level ethnic density with timely initiation of antenatal care in the Netherlands. METHODS: Data on time of initiation of antenatal care and other individual level characteristics were obtained from the Netherlands Perinatal Registry (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) , which includes 96% of all pregnancies in the Netherlands. We derived the neighborhood level data from three other national survey and registration-based sources. Neighborhood social capital was calculated using an 'ecometrics' procedure. In the analyses we included 1.237.282 pregnancies in 3422 neighborhoods. Multi-level logistic regression was used to assess the associations of individual and neighborhood level determinants with initiation of antenatal care after 14 and 22 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: In our analyses we found subtle but significant neighborhood level effects on late initiation of antenatal care. Ethnic density was associated with a lower risk of late initiation of antenatal care for non-Western women as compared to Western women (OR 0.88; CI 0.86-0.89; p<0.001). The opposite was the case for neighborhood social capital (OR 1.09; CI 1.07-1.12; p<0.001). Neighborhood socioeconomic status had no association with late initiation of antenatal care. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that neighborhood contexts can influence the timing of entry into antenatal care in the Netherlands. Higher ethnic density seems to foster timely initiation of care for Non-Western women, but not for Western women. We hypothesize that women benefit from information in their networks on when and how to access the obstetric health care system. ",

Statistical analysis including hierarchical linear regression was used to detect significant associations with demographic factors, heavy metals, and industrial chemical exposure. RESULTS: Women with a history of macrosomic delivery had significantly higher body mass index, ponderal index measures, and glucose levels. They were more likely to be born in a Hispanic country, have a history of gestational diabetes, less likely to be Non-Hispanic-Blacks and more likely to achieve a lower educational status. Women with macrosomic deliveries had significantly lower cotinine, cadmium, and Benzophenone-3 (an ingredient in sun-blocking agents) levels. However they had increased molybdenum, some phalate esters and methylarsonic acid derivatives levels (these are inorganic arsenic metabolites) {table 1}). Hierarchical logistic regression analysis showed that cadmium, dimethylarsonic acid and molybdenum levels were independently predictive of macrosomic delivery. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms the associations of ethnic variations, increased body mass index, higher glucose levels and decreased smoking with macrosomia. A new finding is that some heavy metals such as cadmium, arsenic, and molybdenum may be associated with macrosomia.",

INTRODUCTION: Although the risks of fetal aneuploidy increase with maternal age (especially > age 35), the majority of pregnancies complicated by fetal Down Syndrome (DS) occur in younger women. It has been suggested that the age of the mother's mother (fetuses' maternal grandmother) at the time she delivered the fetuses' mother may at least in part explain this phenomenon. METHODS: All live born DS cases in the Utah Birth Defect Network that could be linked to 3-generation matrilineal pedigrees in the Utah Population Database were included (N=516). Ten gender/birth yearmatched controls per case were identified. Non-adoption was confirmed for all pedigrees. Maternal and grandmaternal ages were categorized by 5-year intervals, with modal ages serving as the reference category (age 25-29 for mothers and ages 20-24 for maternal grandmothers). We created a constellation model to study the age combination of maternal and grandmaternal age. RESULTS: A 6x5 analysis of maternal and grandmaternal age combinations demonstrate a predominant influence of maternal age on DS odds ratios (Figure) . ORs tended to increase with grandmaternal age but did not achieve statistical significance net of maternal age (Table; * = p<0.05).",

In a phase 2 study of 59 HR women, the effect of flut treatment (125 mg/day for 6 weeks; 12 patients) vs. 47 HR controls was studied in the adnexal tissues harvested at the time of RRSO. 47% carried a BRCA mutation. IHC analysis of candidate proteins CSF-1, CSF-1R, ErbB4 was performed, with scores separately analyzed in epithelium (epith) and stroma, in ampulla, fimbria, ovary, and ov endosalpingiosis (ES). RESULTS: Androgen ablation in male nude mice resulted in a 24-fold decrease in tumor burden, using serous ov cells. We recently showed that elevated levels of CSF-1 and ErbB4 in the adnexa correlate with HR/BRCA positive status, when compared to low-risk controls, as did the presence of ES, which may derive from the tubal epithelium. We now find the effect of flut on the 3 candidate markers compared to HR controls is dramatic. Flut significantly decreased the levels of the following biomarkers: CSF-1 in ov epith (p=.01), stroma (p=.0006), ES (p=.01), fimbria epith (p=.07) or stroma (p=.01); ErbB4 in ov epith (p=.006), stroma (p<.0001), or ES (p=.005); CSF-1R in ov epith (p=.04), stroma (p=.01), ES (p=.009). Receiver operating curves clearly distinguish flut treated from HR controls. ErbB4 and CSF-1 in ov stroma achieved an AUC=0.99, with 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: CSF-1/CSF-1R signaling is established as having a role in ov ca progression; evidence also suggests a role in its initiation. ErbB4 may be a marker which increases along the continuum from normal ov to ca. Our data suggest that flut reverses the elevated levels of CSF-1 and ErbB4 which correlate with HR status, even after a short 6 week exposure, in particular of CSF-1 and ErbB4 in ov epithelium, stroma, and in ov ES. Marker changes in epithelium and stroma within the adnexa by flut suggests a component of microenvironment effect more than direct anti-androgen effects. The current analysis finds more significance in marker changes within the ovary than tube, by flut. We anticipate global approaches will identify more markers of flut action, in several adnexal locations.",

Although not statistically significant, tumors greater than 10cm in size, greater than 10 mitotic figures (MF) per high power field, and with severe atypia were associated with a poorer median survival.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that preoperative tissue sampling is not accurate at diagnosing LMS, whereas radiographic suspicion of malignancy is often correct. Initial surgery by gynecological oncologist and additional staging including lymph node dissection and omentectomy does not affect overall survival. Earlier stage of diagnosis is associated with improved median survival. Relevant areas of frozen tissue (~10-50 mg) were dissected on dry ice and homogenised in ice-cold 15% methanol.

Histologic examination of these specimens confirmed that the postpartum fallopian tube is lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium consisting of both ciliated and non-ciliated cells. Prominent intercalated cells and a diffuse lymphocytic infiltration were also observed in all specimens. The tubal epithelium in 4 subjects was characterized by heaped regions suggestive of enhanced proliferation. These regions were observed scattered throughout the isthmus, ampulla and fimbrae. Tubal epithelia from these four subjects were also characterized by a diffuse, enhanced expression of Ki-67. Increased numbers of epithelial mitoses were observed in one subject. Patchy (wild type) expression of TP53 was observed throughout the tubal epithelia of all 20 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Proliferative features are commonly observed in the epithelia of the postpartum fallopian tube. These features do not fulfill established criteria for serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas and their clinical significance is currently unknown. Further work is necessary to better understand the unique biology of the fallopian tube in recently gravid women. Biomarkers' Sensitivity (S), specificity (Sp), PPV and NPV were also assessed in prediction of treatment failures defined as CIN2 or worse. RESULTS: A total of 282 women were included; the histology showed CIN2+ in 162 (57%) cases. Twenty-eight women had repeat cone and 21 of those had CIN2 or worse in histology. The HPV biomarkers positivity rates before treatment were significantly correlated to the grade at treatment (p<0.05). The positivity rates for the biomarkers post-treatment were higher for women that had a treatment failure when compared to the whole population.HPV-DNA appeared to be positive in 32.9% at the second follow-up visit and in 36.4% of the cases 2 years post-operatively. The mRNA by NASBA was positive prior to the treatment in 45% of the cases, and 5% at 24 months. HPV DNA test had the highest sensitivity (81%) for the prediction of CIN2+ and mRNA by NASBA the highest specificity (85.7%) with a follow-up of 60months. CONCLUSIONS: CIN treatment leads to a significant reduction in positivity for all HPV-related biomarkers. The application of HPV-related biomarkers (single or combinations) during follow-up could enhance the early prediction of recurrent disease and may be incorporated in a risk scoring system that could allow individualised tailored management.

The increase in the expression of CD157 in D compared to P was shown to be an independent factor of poor prognosis. CD157 may indicate a highly aggressive tumor requiring specific treatment.Moreover, it may help to classify ovarian cancers into molecular subtypes with different outcome. Cytokine levels were standardised against total protein (Lowry assay). Data were tested for normality (Anderson-Darling test) and analysed by Kruskall-Wallis tests with post hoc Mann-Whitney-U tests. Correction for multiple comparisons was applied using the False Discovery Rate and correlative heat maps were created in R. RESULTS: Significant differences in the levels of 28 cytokines were observed between the four groups. Morover, cytokine profiles matched the robust histology-based discrimination between normal, hyperplastic and cancerous endometrial tissues, including differentiating between Type I/II cancers. These differences were also reflected in cytokine interrelationships. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a functional role for cytokine involvement in endometrial carcinogenesis. While some differences may indicate altered tissue composition (e.g. reduced stroma and fibroblast growth factor), others may represent the greater inflammatory/immune effector cell infiltration associated with malignancy. Others still may reflect local microenvironmental signalling modulating neoangiogenesis, invasion and immune evasion, although the relative contribution of each cytokine in these processes is unclear. To investigate this further, the present data are being used to construct hierarchical Bayesian networks so as to highlight likely causal cytokine interrelationships and the microenvironmental network deregulations involved in endometrial carcinogenesis.",

A number of models exist to help us understand and predict patient behavior. A patient's perceived severity of and susceptibility to a given disease have been shown to be key factors in these models. METHODS: A convenience sample was obtained from attendees at a community fair. Qualifying participants were English-speaking AAW aged 18 to 70 who finished >50% of the survey. Participants were given a survey to assess their knowledge and perceived susceptibility and severity of HPV, cervical cancer and HPV vaccination. For each participant, a cumulative knowledge, susceptibility, and severity score was determined. RESULTS: 242 surveys were collected and 215 met the eligibility criteria. The participants' mean age was 48.3 \u00b1 12.1 years. The mean combined cumulative susceptibility and severity score was 70.4 \u00b1 22.5 from a maximum score of 125. The Kruskal-Wallis analysis indicated that being at risk for getting HPV, having the ability to avoid HPV infection, feeling the HPV vaccine is safe, and having the ability to avoid cervical cancer were all significantly correlated with a higher cumulative HPV knowledge score. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of HPV, cervical cancer, and HPV vaccination influenced the perceived susceptibility and severity of HPV and cervical cancer in AAW. AAW who felt they could contract HPV, contract cervical cancer, and understood these diseases were serious, had a higher knowledge score than those who did not. However, most participants reflected low knowledge, susceptibility, and severity scores, indicating that better education on HPV, its sequela, and its prevention are needed.",

They cause abnormal uterine bleeding and have the potential to undergo malignant transformation. The LNG-IUS reduces the risk of developing endometrial polyps in women using tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. Given that tamoxifen primed endometrium treated with the LNG-IUS assumes the 'decidual' phenotype and demonstrates an increase in IGFBP-1 expression, we propose firstly that decidualisation can be induced using tamoxifen (TX) and levonorgestrel (LNG) and secondly that the process of endometrial stromal cell (ESC) decidualisation modulates the expression of two genes (Beta Catenin and Notch 2) that have been shown to be significantly down regulated in endometrial polyps. METHODS: ESCs were harvested from pre-menopausal uteri (n=3) and benign postmenopausal endometrial polyps (n=3) and grown to confluence in culture. Once confluent, ESCs were plated onto 12 well plates and maintained in culture for 21 days. Decidualisation was induced using 8-bromoadenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) with the addition of either estradiol and medroxyprogesterone actate (E2+MPA) or LNG+TX. Treatments were repeated in triplicate. Total RNA was isolated from the decidualised ESCs using trizol reagent and DNase 1 treatment. After conversion into cDNA with AMV-RT, quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the expression levels of prolactin (as evidence of decidualisation), Beta Catenin and Notch 2 relative to that of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Fold changes for each gene were calculated using the 2 -DDCT method. RESULTS: Prolactin was up-regulated in both uterine and polyp ESCs with E2+MPA (9.4 fold) and TX+LNG (2.5 fold).

Bremelanotide (BMT) is a novel cyclic heptapeptide known to act as a melanocortin-receptor-4 agonist. METHODS: After a screening diagnosis-confirmation month, premenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder and/or female sexual arousal disorder received an in-clinic subcutaneous (SC) placebo dose followed by 4 weeks of SC placebo self-dosing (baseline period), and were then randomized to double-blind SC placebo or BMT 0.75, 1.25, or 1.75 mg as 2 in-clinic doses followed by 12 weeks of athome self-dosing. Outcome measures included change from baseline to end of study in the 4-week number of satisfying sexual events (SSEs) and in total score on the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Desire/Arousal/Orgasm (FSDS-DAO). From receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for each endpoint was computed as the value simultaneously maximizing the sensitivity and specificity in predicting benefit. Each MCID then served as the cut-off for a responder analysis. RESULTS: Of 397 randomized subjects, 327 used at-home study drug and provided data (for SSEs, 324). The computed MCIDs were +1.0 for number of SSEs, +2.1 for FSFI total score, and -7.0 for FSDS-DAO total score. Using these cut-offs, the SSE responder rate was 37% for placebo, versus 38% for BMT 0.75 mg, 48% for BMT 1.25 mg, 55% for BMT 1.75 mg, and 51% for BMT 1.25/1.75 mg pooled. The FSFI responder rate was 46% for placebo, versus 45%, 61%, 69%, and 65%, respectively, for BMT. The FSDS-DAO responder rate was 45% for placebo, versus 49%, 60%, 69%, and 64% for BMT. For all three endpoints, the difference from placebo was statistically significant (p <0.05, CMH test, stratified by diagnosis) at 1.75 mg and at 1.25/1.75 mg pooled.

The relative biological effectiveness of Bi-121 against cell lines grown in monolayer and spheroids is compared x-ray and P-32 therapy. The effectiveness of IPl treatment with Bi-212 of tumor bearing mice inoculated intaperitoneally with Ehrlich-Lettre Ascites tumors is determined. Studies showing the biodistribution and toxicity associated of Bi-212 in determined. Based on these studies, doses of Bi-212 necessary for eradication of microscopic ovarian cancer after IP administration while minimizing toxicity is determined.",

The actual yield of Bi-212 is up to 20 mCi of activity per elution. Bi-212 showed a higher relative biological effectiveness wth RBE of 1.4 for P-32, 1.5 for x-ray, and 3.19 for Bi-212 therapy. Imaging rabbits up to 3 hours after IP instillation of B-212 in 200 cc of saline showed even distribution in the peritoneal cavity with 80% of the activity remaining in the peritoneal cavity. Bi-212 is effective in eradicating intraabdominal tumors in Ehrich-Lettre ascites bearing mice. In 40 % of mice there was a cure with no evidence of disease at 3months. Based upon these in-vitro and in-vivo studies, there is acceptable toxicity to normal human tissue after IP administration. A contemplated dose of 100 mCi to a human produces an alpha dose to any organ of less than 15c GY.

Jacob Rotmensch, 1 Liaohai Chen. 2 1 Gynecologic Oncology, Rush University Medical Center, USA; 2 Department of Chemistry, Utah State University, USA. INTRODUCTION: Bacterial phages can be used as targeted imaging and therapy against gynecologic malignancies. The DNA of the capsid core is extracted and replaced by imaging/ therapy isotopes for directed therapy. Phage specificity to tumors is obtained by peptide insertion on to the capsid surface. In this study, fabrication of imaging/therapy capsids inserted with isotopes into the core is described. METHODS: T7 \"ghost\" phages are fabricated by extracting DNA from the capsid core with osmotic shocking. Capillary zone electrophoresis and electron microscopy confirm the generation of \"ghost\" phage. Based on the peak areas of the \"ghost\" particle and intact phages, the yield is approximately 55%. To visualize the \"ghost\" particles, phage samples are negatively stained with uranyl acetate (1%) and examined by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Philips CM-120). RESULTS: The T7 \"ghost\" phages formed act as carriers for imaging agent and directed isotope therapy. \"Ghost\" phages incorporate metallic cobalt inside its core to occupy the volume previously taken up DNA. To visualize these \"magnetic\" phages, samples are immobilized on a gold-coated TEM grid and imaged by TEM. Uniform cobalt particles (42 \u00b1 2 nm) are visually seen inside the hollow phage. 99m technetium oxide hybrid radiophages are formed and confirmed by TEM imaging. Uniform 99m technetium oxide particles (~40nm) are visualized inside the \"ghost\" T7 shells. In order to maximize sensitivity for molecular MRI imaging, superparamagnetic nano-particles are synthesized in the T7 ghost to produce a large net magnetic moment that affects magnetization beyond the boundaries of the phage particle. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial phages act as vehicles to deliver imaging and therapy agents against gynecologic malignancies. It is well established that germline mutations such as BRCA1/2, are associated with a predisposition for ovarian cancer at a rate of only 20-40%, suggesting the presence of unknown mutations in other predisposition genes. We sought to investigate the association of several known functional SNPs in key oxidant and antioxidant enzymes including catalase (CAT, rs1001179), the NAD(P)H oxidase p22 phox subunit encoded by the CYBA gene (rs4673), myeloperoxidase (MPO, rs2243828), inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2, rs2297518), hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1a (rs11549465), glutathione reductase (GSR, rs1002149), glutathione peroxidase (GPX, rs3448), and superoxide dismutase (MnSOD, rs4880), with increased risk of development of ovarian cancer. METHODS: Patients (49 ovarian cancer with only 7 BRACA1 positive) and 91 high-risk non-cancer with 25 BRACA1 positive) were recruited from the Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI for genetic counseling based on personal and family histories. DNA was extracted from blood followed by TaqMan\u00ae SNP Genotyping utilizing QuantStudio\u2122 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System. Data was analyzed using SPSS, utilizing Chi-squared and regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients were 92.1% female and 7.3% male and ages ranged from 18-90, with 92.1% White, 5.2% Black and 0.5% Asian. Except for the GSR SNP, there was a significant association between all SNPs analyzed and ovarian cancer as compared to the minor allele frequencies reported for the general population (p<0.04). There was no significant difference in SNP frequencies between high-risk non-cancer and ovarian cancer patients (p>0.05). Multiple logistic regressions adjusted for sex, race, age at primary diagnostic in BRCA1/2 positive and negative, was unable to detect statistically significant predictive power for any of the SNP variants included in the models. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that SNPs in key oxidant and antioxidant enzymes may serve as potential predictive biomarkers for ovarian cancer and high-risk individuals.",

M273 is 2-3-fold resistant to Taxol, most likely due to its higher expression of MDR1. M248 was not acetylated after treatment with epothilone B, compared to all other cell lines. P21 and PAI-1 were induced by epothilone B in A2780 cells. Expression of p21, GADD45 and PAI-1 in mutant cell lines was generally down-regulated.

Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) may play a inhibitory factor against IL-1and IL-1b as pre-inflammatory cytokine. We examined the immunohistochemical expression of keratin 6A/13and IL-1Ra in uterine cervical lesions. METHODS: Specimens from 21 patients with uterine cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or uterine cervical invasive carcinoma were immunohistochemically evaluated for the expression of the 2 markers keratin 6A/13and IL-1Ra. Of the patients from whom uterine cervical cells and biopsy tissue specimens were obtained, 9 had CIN1 lesions (42.9%), 5 had CIN2 lesions (23.8%), 6 had CIN3 lesions (23.8%), and 1 had cervical invasive carcinoma (4.8%). Immunohistochemistry staining intensity was quantitatively scored from 0 to 2+. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. RESULTS: The positive expression rates of keratin 6A, 13 and IL-1Ra were 90% 85% and 0% in the uterine cervical cells, 100%, 70% and 0% in the biopsy tissue specimens, respectively. No significant difference in expression was noted according to the progression of lesions. The expression of keratin 6A was positive, but those of keratin 13 and IL-1Ra were negative in a case of cervical invasive carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: IL-1Ra might not be useful as a marker for uterine cervical lesions because it was not expressed in the CIN or cervical invasive carcinoma specimens. Keratin 6A/13 could be potential immunohistochemical markers for uterine cervical lesions. and 5 cases of cervical cancer. Potential benefit was observed for three patients with stage I or II uterine cancer and positive post-procedure cytology. CONCLUSIONS: Post-procedure peritoneal cytology is feasible and may benefit patients with early stage cancer by increasing the detection of microscopic peritoneal metastasis or cancer cell seeding during surgery.",

            "text": "Total Inhibin: A New Marker for Ovarian Granulosa Cell Tumours? Anastasia Tsigkou, 1 Felice Petraflia, 2 Fangrong Shen. 3 1 Biology, Xian Suzhou, Jiangsu, China; 2 Ostetrica and Gynecolgy, University Siena, Siena, Tuscona, Italy; 3 obstetrics and Gynecology, No.1 Hospital Suzhou, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. INTRODUCTION: Adult granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) of the ovary are hormonally active sex-cord stromal tumors. They comprise 2-5% of all ovarian cancers and are associated with a good prognosis due to early diagnosis and high survival rates. A glycoprotein that has shown interest in ovarian cancers is Inhibin (Inhibin A & Inhibin B) which is produced by the granulosa cells. Inhibin A consists of an a subunit disulphide linked to a bA [a+bA] subunit and Inhibin B consists of an a subunit and bB [a+bB] subunit. Since a subunit is also expressed by the theca internal cells, in addition to the granulosa cells levels of a-subunit mRNA in the ovary are higher than the b-subunit mRNA. The present study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the new total inhibin assay able to detect dimeric and free a subunitcontaining forms of Inhibin in postmenopausal women (PMW) with GCTs. METHODS: Serum samples were collected and analysed from PMW 1) PMW with Granulosa cells tumors (GCTs) (n=50). 2) Normal PMW (n=70) (55 and over). Inhibin immunoreactivity was determined on normal ovary and GCT using monoclonal antibody (Mabs) PO#12 and PO#14. RESULTS: Serum concentrations in PMW with GCTs were determined using the commercially available ELISAs inhibin A, inhibin B, pro-aC and total inhiibn. Total inhibin levels in PMW with GCTs was significantly higher then controls (p=0.00110). Inhibin B (r=0.63) and inhibin pro-aC (r=0.73) positive correlated with total inhibin (PO#23-R1) in PMW with GCTs. A strong inhibin immunoreactivity was shown in GCTs .",

Ovarian cancer is the #1 lethal gynecological malignancy in United States. miRNAs have been identified with oncogenic or tumor suppressor properties raising the potential that such miRNAs exist in ovarian cancers and if identified, provide potential therapeutic targets. METHODS: Ovarian biopsies from ovarian cancer patients (n=14) and the OVCAR-5 cell line were used. The miRNA/mRNA transcriptomes were defined in the tissue samples using the Affymetrix miRNA 3.0 and Human Exon microarrays, and potential targets confirmed by Rea-Time PCR. The effect of miR-183 on proliferation, cell migration and invasion were quantitated using a cell proliferation assay, and transwell migration and invasion assays, respectively. The miR-183 target gene was determined initially by the miRNA Prediction Database (miRanda and mirSVR), and then confirmed by Luciferase Reporter Assay. Results are reported as means \u00b1 S.E. Student's t-test was applied. RESULTS: Sixty (60) miRNA (fold>1.5, P<0.05) and 713 mRNA (fold>2.0, P<0.05) were altered in the ovaries of women with ovarian cancer. miR-183 was one of the most up regulated miRs and CPED1 (cadherin-like and PC-esterase domain containing 1) was one of the most down regulated genes in ovarian cancer. Using miRNA Prediction Database and Luciferase Report Assay, we determined that CPED1 is direct target of miR-183. miR-183 suppressed the expression of CPED1 at the mRNA and protein level, and its ability to promote cellular migration and invasion was partially reversed by overexpression of CPED1. CONCLUSIONS: miR-183 is an onco-miRNA that promotes ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion through CPED1, which encodes a transcription factor required for embryonic development and in ovarian cancer is a metastasis suppressor. We hypothesize blocking the effect of miR-183 or overexpressing CPED1 has therapeutic potential.",

We designed a phase-I study to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and clinical efficacy of combinatorial immunotherapy by using dendritic cell (DC)-based autologous whole tumor antigen vaccination alone and in combination with bevacizumab or with bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. METHODS: A phase-I, three-cohort, single center study with autologous oxidized whole tumor cell pulsed DC (OC-DC) vaccine administered intranodally alone or in combination with bevacizumab or bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Patients in cohort 1 (n=5) received 5 doses of 5-10 \u00d710 6 DCs intranodally, while patients in cohort 2 (n=10) received the 5 doses of vaccine in combination with intravenous bevacizumab given every two weeks. Patients in cohort 3 (n=10) also received 5 doses of vaccine while bevacizumab plus cyclophosphamide was given the day before each vaccination. Patients with stable disease at the end of study were allowed to continue with additional maintenance vaccines. 50 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who received bevacizumab with cyclophosphamide as a second line treatment were used as controls.",

The average number of vaccines patients received was 7. The vaccine was well tolerated and only produced grade 1 toxicities. Tumor specific T cell responses were elicited against HER-2/neu, MUC1, NY-ESO-1, mesothelin and WT-1 tumor antigens. 14 patients (56%) showed clinical benefit with stable or no evidence of disease (40% in cohort 1, 50% in cohort 2, 70% in cohort 3) at end of study with some exhibiting long durable responses. Compelling progression free and overall survival benefit were elicited in cohort 3 as compared to cohort 1 and 2 and the control group of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cell-based immunotherapies combined with immunomodulation using cyclophosphamide and antiangiogenic agents are novel approaches to enhance DC vaccines by augmenting antitumor immunity, thus improving clinical outcomes for patients with ovarian cancer. The pathophysiology of endometriosis and it's impairment on fertility is still unclear after decades of research. The role of genetics and epigenetics has the recent years been hot topics a reduced expression of the hoxa10 gene has been suggested to play an important part contributing to the infertility in these patients. The objective this study was to investigate the DNA methylation profile of the hoxa10 gene in eutopic and ectopic endometrium in humans as DNA-methylation has been implied as responsible mechanism for the altered gene expression in these patients. The study will also investigate the methylation profile of the hoxa10 gene in different ectopic tissues and thereby generate information regarding etiopathogenesis of this enigmatic disorder. METHODS: Endometrial tissue (eutopic and ectopic) from eighteen women admitted for surgery for endometriosis related pain and twelve women admitted for surgery because of non endometriotic disease (controls) underwent sodium bisulfite DNA modification, RT-PCR amplification and Pyrosequencing analysis. RESULTS: The eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis was significantly more methylated in comparison to controls (sequence 1: 8.68% in cases and 6.25 % in controls: p=0.037, sequence 2: 11.89% in cases and 9.25% in controls: p=0.032). The eutopic endometrium was significantly more methylated than the ectopic tissue in the endometriosis patients (mean difference -3.6 sequence 1: p=0.001 and -6.0 sequence 2: p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals relevant information regarding a dysregulated gene necessary for reproduction, a finding that could lead to development of new treatment strategies for the disease. Moreover it generates information regarding the nature of the different ectopic tissue which contributes to a better etiopathologic understanding of this common and complex disorder. Literature suggests that menstrual phase also affects susceptibility to HIV infection. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that menstrual phase impacts levels of VF antmicrobial peptides (AMPs) and antiviral activity. METHODS: 29 healthy women (ages 18-39) were recruited to provide self-collected vaginal fluid specimens 1 hour before and 1 hour after either PVI (with condom) or a control activity consisting of 15 min of quiet time (QT). VF was obtained using a polywick tampon for 1 hour. Samples were eluted with 2 mL sterile PBS. A 10% solution of this VF eluate was incubated with HIV-1 BaL virus prior to infecting TZM-bl luciferase reporter cells. AMPs (Trappin-2/elafin, lysozyme, lactoferrin, human beta defensin-2) were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The mean inhibition of HIV infectivity from pre-to postactivity (either PVI or QT) differed significantly by menstrual phase (P= 0.023) in a multilevel model, accounting for the within-person correlation: inhibition of HIV infectivity decreased by 11.45% during the follicular phase and increased by only 0.53% during the luteal phase. The difference in HIV inhibition by phase remained when adjusted for activity (PVI vs QT) (P=0.022). There was also an effect of menstrual phase on lysozyme, with luteal levels (M = 7.78 mg/ml,SD = 1.40) significantly higher than follicular levels (M = 4.73 mg/ml, SD, 1.14) (P=0.007). Effects of phase on lactoferrin in the reverse direction were also apparent: there was a statistical trend (P= .068) for luteal levels (M -2.33 mg/ml, SD = 0.46) to be lower than follicular levels (M = 4.37 mg/ml, SD = 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that antimicrobial defenses are affected by menstrual phase. This study was funded by NIAID/NIH grant 1R01AI094563 and was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. It is unclear if self-assessment of menstrual bleeding correlates with objective measures of anemia. As AAW are at high risk of having heavy bleeding and fibroids, we evaluated whether personal assessment of bleeding is correlated with subjective and objective measures of anemia in this subset of women. METHODS: AAW ages 18-65 attending an urban community health fair were asked to participate in this survey study. AAW answered questions about menstrual history and typical menstrual bleeding. They reported experiences with either general or menses-associated symptoms of anemia. AAW also provided serum samples for complete blood counts and iron studies. RESULTS: 144 AAW completed the survey. Of the those who reported having menstrual cycles, average flow was classified as: very heavy (17.2%), heavy (32.8%), normal (37.9%) or light (12.1%). The average length of flow was also reported, with 36.8% stating that bleeding continued for 5 to 7 days or more. AAW who classified their menses as very heavy or heavy reported more general symptoms of anemia (p=.007), more frequent anemia-associated symptoms during menses (p=.028), and were more likely to have fibroids (p=.049) than those who reported normal or light menses. AAW who classified their flow as lasting more than 7 days also reported more frequent anemia-associated symptoms during menses than AAW who described shorter menses (p=.031). Laboratory testing was performed on 72.1% of the menstruating AAW. Those who reported very heavy or heavy menses had lower hemoglobin (p=.022) and hematocrit levels (p=.012) than AAW who classified menses as normal or light. In addition, AAW who reported heavy menstrual bleeding had lower ferritin levels than those who described menstrual bleeding as normal or light (p=.035). Ferritin levels were also lower in AAW who reported that bleeding lasted 5 to 7 days or more when compared to AAW who described shorter length of flow (p=.047). CONCLUSIONS: AAW with heavier menses reported more symptoms of anemia and had lower hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin levels.",

Women aged 18-65 years reported on the status of their menstrual cycles, details of typical menses, and information on gynecologic care. Demographic and socioeconomic information, health insurance status, and health literacy were assessed. Complete blood counts and iron studies were also performed. RESULTS: 144 AAW completed the survey. 67% of the women with menstrual cycles had a gynecologist. Women who reported that their bleeding lasted five to seven days or longer were more likely to have a gynecologist than not (p= .024). Women with laboratory confirmed anemia were more likely to have a gynecologist than non-anemic women (p= .022). Women who had been seen as an outpatient for issues related to heavy vaginal bleeding in the past had higher ferritin (p=.044), higher transferrin saturation (p=.041), and lower transferrin levels (p=.049) than those who had not been seen. A history of outpatient evaluation for heavy vaginal bleeding was not correlated with age, body mass index (BMI), marital status, employment, education, income, insurance status or health literacy. Half of the women who had presented to clinic for heavy vaginal bleeding had also been seen in the emergency department (ED) for these issues (p<.001). The women who had visited the ED for heavy vaginal bleeding were more likely to have higher BMIs than women who did not present to the ED (p=.019). However, there was no correlation with any of the other demographic or socioeconomic factors, insurance status, or health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: Two thirds of menstruating AAW had a gynecologist. Although those who reported longer menses were more likely to seek care, there was no correlation with heaviness of bleeding. Women who were seen as outpatients for heavy vaginal bleeding had better serum iron parameters. These data suggest that AAW who suffer from abnormal uterine bleeding and seek gynecologic care will have improved blood parameters versus those who do not. Adenomyosis is a benign estrogen-dependent disease defined as \"benign invasion of myometrium by endometrium\". It is characterized by presence of endometrial glands and stroma, leading to an hypertrophic myometrium, offen associated with infertility. Adenomyosis seems to share many features with endometriosis; ectopic implants remain functionally responsive to sex steroid hormones, women with adenomyosis are subfertily, and in many cases painful symptoms reflect those of endometriosis. Transforming growth factors beta (TGF-beta) family includes activins and inhibins, expressed by human endometrium, acting on proliferation, differentiation, immune function, tissue remodeling and apoptosis playing also an important role in the menstrual cycle, decidualization and early pregnancy. The biological effects of activins are mediated by specific receptors (ActRs) and are primarly modulated by follistatin and cripto. Follistatin is an activebinding proteins which modulate the actions of activin betaA by binding it with high affinity and blocking its interaction with the receptors. Cripto functions as a coreceptor for activin betaA by forming a complex with activin betaA receptors and antagonizing its effects. Eutopic endometrium in patients with endometriosis has a different menstrual cycle-related pattern of activin. Activin betaA, cripto and inhibin alfa mRNA expression do not change throughout menstrual cycle and the expression of follistatin mRNA is increased during the late secretory phase. A dysfunction of activin betaA pathway in endometriotic endometrium may contribute to the development of infertility in women with endometriosis. METHODS: Tissues of matched uterine leiomyoma, adjacent normal myometrium, endometrium and adenomyosis were collected from patients with adenomyosis (n=6) who underwent hysterectomy. Total RNA was extracted from tissue homogenates and gene expression assessed by quantitative Real Time-PCR. RESULTS: We evaluated molecules involved in activin and myostatin signaling. In particular activin betaA and betaB subunits, myostatin, their receptors (ActRIIA, ActRIIB, ALK7) and binding proteins (follistatin, FLRG, crypto, inhibin alfa) were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study evaluated changes of TGF-beta family members in matched tissue from women with adenomyosis, improving our knowledge on their possible role in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis.",

            "text": "Circulating MicroRNAs as Potential Biomarkers for Endometriosis. Recently, microRNAs have been found to be good candidate markers for various diseases. The purpose of this study is to identify serum microRNAs as potential noninvasive biomarkers for endometriosis. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from women undergoing laparoscopy for different indications including pelvic masses, pelvic pain, suspicious endometriosis, infertility, and diagnostic evaluation. Twenty women with histologically proven endometriosis and 15 endometriosisfree controls were included in this study. Total RNA was extracted from 400 \u00b5l of serum using the mirVana PARIS Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We employed the Poly (A) RT-PCR method using Invitrogen NCode miRNA First-Strand cDNA Synthesis MIRC-50 kit (Invitrogen) and conventional RT-PCR was used to assay miRNA levels with the specific forward primers to let-7a-f, mir-135a,b and the universal reverse primer complementary to the anchor primer. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age and parity between endometriosis group and controls. Mir-135a was significantly down-regulated in women with endometriosis compared with controls (p=0.014), while let 7a and 7f showed a trend toward down-regulation (p=0.085 and p=0.073, respectively). Let7d expressions strongly correlated with serum CA-125 levels with statistical significance (r=0.775, p<0.001) but, no other correlations were noted between miRNA expressions and clinical parameters. When diagnostic power of serum mir-135a expressions was evaluated, an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve yielded 0.740 (95% CI: 0.542-0.937, p=0.033) with sensitivity and specificity of 66.7% and 87.5% at the cut-off value of 0.60in discriminating endometriosis from controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that several circulating miRNAs are differentially expressed in sera of patients with endometriosis compared to controls. Serum mir-135a levels may potentially serve as a diagnostic marker for endometriosis. Menstruation is an inflammatory process involving vascular and immune cell-pathways which are regulated by ovarian hormones; estrogen and progesterone. Several endometrial disorders exist where resolution of inflammation or the inflammatory phenotype is perturbed, such as heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), uterine fibroids (UF) and endometriosis. These conditions affect up to 80% of women of reproductive age worldwide. At present, no long-term effective medical therapies exist. The aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory phenotype of endometria from women with HMB, UF and endometriosis to better understand the patho-physiology of these complaints. METHODS: Endometrial biopsy specimens were collected from 40 women (age range); 8 controls (normal menstrual bleeding, no UF or endometriosis), 4 from women with HMB (measured blood loss >85ml), 7 with UF but normal bleeding, 7 with both UF and HMB, 12 women suffering from endometriosis and 2 with both UF and endometriosis. The concentrations of mRNAs encoded by genes that act as inflammatory mediators were measured using qRT-PCR. Immunohistochemical localization of inflammatory mediators was performed.",

            "text": "The inflammatory gene expression of the endometrium was dependent upon the clinical phenotype. The presence of UF, regardless of whether they were associated with HMB, resulted in significant differences in the pattern of expression of members of the kallikrein-kinin system (KLK1, KLK3, BDKRB1, BDKRB2) and altered expression of ALOX12 mRNA. Notably expression of KLK3 was dramatically up-regulated by 17 fold in women with endometriosis compared with controls. There was a significant decrease in ALOX12 in the both HMB and endometriosis samples (P<0.0002 for each group). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced expression of ALOX12 in women with endometriosis or HMB would be consistent with a reduced ability to synthesise the natural anti-inflammatory lipoxin A4, an essential endometrial resolution factor. The kallikrein-kinin system plays a crucial role in inflammation, vasodilation, smooth muscle contraction, vascular permeability, coagulation and pain. Hence altered expression of mRNAs encoding key members of the cascade provides a potential target for therapies addressing these symptoms in women with fibroids or endometriosis. Uterine fibroids (UF) affect 77% of women by menopause, and account for $9.4 billion in annual U.S. yearly healthcare costs. Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been linked with protection from UF. Whether protection derives from effects of T2D or T2D pharmacologic treatment is unclear. To further evaluate this relationship we tested for association between T2D treatments and UF risk.",

UF status after T2D diagnosis was determined from pelvic ultrasounds. Women with T2D were identified from their electronic medical record. Diabetic cases had not been previously diagnosed with a UF at the time of T2D diagnosis. We identified total of 2,321 women with T2D. Among these women 17% had an incident UF. Cox regression, unadjusted and adjusted for candidate confounders, was used to test for association between UF presence and T2D treatment (metformin, thiazolidinedione, insulin, or other treatment). We also tested for interactions between T2D treatment and race and body mass index (BMI), separately. RESULTS: Insulin, when controlling for all other T2D treatments and demographic and vital characteristics, conferred protection from UFs in European Americans (EAs) and African Americans (AAs) (EAs, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36 to 0.69; AA aHR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.74). However, we observed an increased risk for UF with metformin treatment among EAs (aHR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.74), but not among AAs (aHR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.51). Normal weight and overweight T2Ds had the most protection from UFs when taking insulin compared to obese subjects. We did not observe strong evidence for association between thiazolidinedione or other T2D treatments and UFs. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together these data suggest that T2D protection from UF may derive from insulin, and suggest that further research should be conducted to dissect the biological pathways underlying this effect. Further mechanistic research is also necessary to reconcile the increased risk of UF among EAs linked to metformin use.",

Jemma Evans, 1,2 Rebecca D'Sylva, 1 Lois A Salamonsen. 1,3 1 Uterine Biology, Prince Henry's Institute, Australia; 2 Physiology, Monash University, Australia; 3 O&G, Monash University, Australia. INTRODUCTION: Unscheduled breakthrough bleeding or 'spotting' is a common problem in users of progestin only contraceptives (POC's). A major feature of POC endometria is 'fragile' luminal epithelium (LE) susceptible to shedding/bleeding. We have little information on mechanisms underlying epithelial fragility. We proposed disturbance of Wnt signalling, associated cell adhesion molecules and repair mechanisms as the cause of fragile epithelium, and that signals from decidualized stroma, resulting from POC use, mediate alterations underlying the bleeding. METHODS: Wnt5a and 7a, b-catenin, E-cadherin, DKK-1 and vimentin examined by IHC in POC (Norplant/depo-provera) and normal endometrium across menstrual cycle. Prolactin (PRL) and DKK-1 assessed by ELISA in media from decidualized (dec) stromal cells. Phospho (P)-b-catenin, vimentin and N-cadherin examined after treatment of endometrial epithelial cells with dec culture media (dec-CM) or DKK-1 by western immunoblot. Real-time proliferation assays performed using xCelligence. RESULTS: In cycling endometrium Wnt 5a and 7a, b-catenin and E-cadherin localized to luminal/glandular epithelial cells. DKK-1 localized to luminal epithelium in proliferative phase and stroma in secretory phase. Vimentin localized to stroma. In POC endometria, Wnt7a, b-catenin and E-cadherin had disappeared or displayed abnormal localization. Wnt5a localized to stroma. DKK-1 localized to decidualized stroma. Vimentin localized to epithelium and stroma. Secretion of PRL and DKK-1 was elevated in decidualized versus non-decidualized stromal cells. Treatment of endometrial epithelial cells with dec-CM or DKK-1 reduced P-b-catenin and elevated vimentin and N-cadherin. Treatment of these cells with dec-CM or recombinant DKK-1 reduced real-time proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Wnt signalling and associated adhesion molecules are down-regulated in POC endometrium, while Wnt antagonist DKK-1 is elevated, likely further inhibiting functional signalling. Elevation of epithelial vimentin and N-cadherin suggests epithelial-mesenchymal transition due to the absence of such signals. Down-regulation of phospho-b-catenin indicates less stable inter-epithelial junctions. Inhibited epithelial proliferation in response to decidual signals such as DKK-1 suggests an endometrial epithelium that cannot repair. These data build a picture of the molecular alterations contributing to epithelial fragility in POC endometrium. Endometriosis is associated with aberrant eutopic endometrium(EUE) gene expression and P resistance. FKBP52, a cochaperone protein optimizes P signaling and is decreased in the EUE of both baboons and women with endometriosis. MicroRNA-29c(miR-29c) is significantly upregulated in endometriosis and TargetScan analysis revealed that it targets FKBP52. METHODS: miR-29c was quantified by qRT-PCR and a 3' UTR luciferase assay confirmed that FKBP52 was a target of miR-29c. EUE biopsies obtained between d21-23 from controls(n=7)and women with endometriosis(n=31) were analyzed for FKBP52. Expression of FKBP52, estrogen receptor(ESR1) and P receptor(PGR) were confirmed by IHC. Uterine stromal cells(HSC) isolated from the control and endometriosis positive women were subjected to in vitro decidualization for 8 days. Transcript levels of FKBP52, HOXA10 and PRL were measured as an index of decidualization. RESULTS: qRT-PCR analysis of miR-29c confirmed the microarray data and demonstrated a progressive increase in miR-29c expression which was correlated with a significant decrease in FKBP52 transcript and protein.",

IHC analysis revealed that EUE from control women had a significantly higher (p<0.04) staining for FKBP52 compared to those with endometriosis. Both WB and RT-PCR analysis further validated the IHC data for FKBP52. On day 8 following in vitro decidualization FKBP52, HOXA10 and the decidualization marker PRL were significantly decreased in HSC from endometriosis patients compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Endometriosis results in increased expression of miR-29c in EUE, which leads to the decreased expression of its target FKBP52. Decreased expression of FKBP52, together with HOXA10 and PRL, in the decidualized HSC from women with endometriosis confirms the poor decidualization response observed in these patients. Collectively, these data suggest that the decrease in FKBP52 might contribute to the infertility in women with endometriosis. This indicates that women with lower 1 st trimester BMI gained more weight than women with higher 1 st trimester BMI. Higher BMI at 1 year post-partum was significantly associated with higher point Aa site measurements (more pronounced POP) after adjusting for age, smoking, POP at G36-38w and 1 st trimester BMI. A one unit increase in BMI 1 year postpartum was associated with a 0.133 cm increase in point Aa.",

Endometrial Tregs look to increase progressively through the menstrual cycle in endometriosis (menstruation = 6.5 of CD4+ cells, proliferative phase = 6.0\u00b12.8, secretory phase = 15.0\u00b112.3%), while proportions in the blood are highest during the proliferative phase (6.0\u00b12.8%, compared to 3.4% in menstruation and 4.8\u00b11.8% in the secretory phase). In endometrium, Treg proportions in the secretory phase appear to be higher in women with endometriosis compared to women without (15.0\u00b112.3% vs. 11.0\u00b16.2%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating and endometrial DC and Treg populations appear to be disturbed in women with endometriosis. Cyclical variations suggest recruitment into the endometrium from circulation and involvement in signalling and functional changes of the uterus. DC and Treg play crucial roles in female fertility, therefore understanding their disturbance in endometriosis may shed light on infertility in endometriosis. This study is continuing to further elucidate immune dysregulation in endometriosis pathophysiology. However, the molecular mechanism remains to be explored. This study is aimed to globally profile protein expression in PE and OVE versus matched control tissues with a proteomic approach. The long-term goal is to search for specific proteins associated with each form of endometriosis as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. METHODS: To avoid natural variation between individuals, a set of endometriotic (PE and OVE) and eutopic control tissues (peritoneum and endometrium) were obtained from the same patient by surgical resection. Proteins were extracted from these tissues and processed for isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling coupled with multidimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Wei et al, Proteomics 2009; 9:2798) . RESULTS: A total of 352 distinct proteins with P<0.05 were identified. The expression of 93 (26%) and 83 (24%) of these proteins exhibited >2fold changes in PE and OVE, respectively, when compared to matched peritoneum and endometrium. Of the 93 proteins identified in PE, 51 were upregulated and 42 were downregulated. Of the 83 proteins identified in OVE, 56 were upregulated and 27 were downregulated. Interestingly, 12 proteins were regulated towards the same direction (11 upregulated and 1 downregulated) in both PE and OVE. However, 9 proteins were upregulated in PE but downregulated in OVE. Conversely, 18 proteins were downregulated in PE but upregulated in OVE. Pathway analysis suggested that these differentially expressed proteins were involved in cell adhesion, motility, extracellular matrix organization, actin cytoskeletal remodeling, cell junction assembly, muscle development, muscle contraction, inflammation, angiogenesis, stress signaling, and metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: iTRAQ combined with LC-MS/MS is an effective tool for identification of differentially expressed proteins in different types of endometriosis. Further detailed studies of the proteins identified herein are needed for a better understanding of pathogenesis of endometriosis and development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

Errors in these processes can lead to chromosome mis-segregation and ultimately, aneuploidy in humans. Yet the molecular basis of these defects is not well understood. We derived mice lacking Chtf18, the murine orthologue of CTF18, which encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein that is crucial for fertility in the fruitfly, and essential for accurate chromosome segregation in yeast. We recently demonstrated that in Chtf18-null mice meiotic recombination is defective and homologous chromosomes separate prematurely during prophase I. In addition, MLH1 foci (markers of DNA crossovers) are decreased in prophase I, suggesting a defect in crossover formation. The ultimate goal of our studies is to elucidate the defects underlying chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy in humans.",

The age of the patients who spontaneously conceived, in the GnRHa group was 16-34 at chemotherapy compared to 16-28 y's in the control group. One patient, in the GnRHa group, spontaneously conceived three times and was delivered of three healthy neonates despite two stem cell transplantations [SCT], 11 years apart. Another patient spontaneously conceived four times and was successfully delivered of four healthy neonates. GnRH-a cotreatment was beneficial not only against regular chemotherapy but also for lymphoma patients undergoing SCT in significantly decreasing the POF rate. CONCLUSIONS: GnRHa cotreatment in parallel to chemotherapy may be beneficial in minimizing POF rate and increasing pregnancy rate in survivors. Therefore, it should be offered to every young woman before gonadotoxic chemotherapy in addition to cryopreservation of embryos, ova, and ovarian tissue. We recently discovered MFG-E8 as an endometrial epithelial cell surface protein upregulated during the window of implantation. Its receptor integrin avb3 is a critical adhesion molecule known to be expressed in endometrial epithelium and stroma. Here we investigated the role of milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) and its receptor integrin avb3 in the attachment of trophoblast cells to the endometrial epithelium. METHODS: By using a well-differentiated human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line (Ishikawa cells) and choriocarcinoma human trophoblast cells (Jar cells), an in vitro attachment assay mimicking human implantation was established. In order to investigate the impact of independently blocking MFG-E8 and integrin avb3, we pretreated the epithelial and trophoblast cells with specific antibodies against those proteins at different concentrations prior to the attachment assay. Ishikawa cells were cultured to confluence and Jar cells were allowed to form 100-200 \u00b5m spheroids, and then transferred on top of the Ishikawa monolayer in the attachment assay. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the presence of MFG-E8 and integrin avb3 in both cell types, and immunoblotting was performed to confirm expression of MFG-E8. The percentage of attached spheroids (versus non-treated controls and using negative controls with non-imune IgG) was calculated before and after pre-treatment of both cell types with antibodies against MFG-E8 and integrin avb3. RESULTS: Both cell lines expressed MFG-E8 and integrin avb3 in their cell membranes, and the presence of the expected MFG-E8 46 kD protein was demonstrated. Pre-treatment of Ishikawa cells, but not of Jar spheroids, with anti-MFG-E8 antibody caused a dose-dependent and significant (p<0.001) inhibition of spheroid attachment. Pre-treatment of both Ishikawa cells and Jar spheroids with anti-integrin avb3 antibody resulted in a dose-dependent and significant (p<0.001) inhibition of attachment. IgG pretreatment had no effect.",

HEC-1A cells (immortalized human endometrial epithelial cells) were cultured in the presence of 20ng/ml TGF-b for 3 days. Morphology was assessed by light microscopy and by atomic force microscopy (AFM), which provides an effective means to characterize the membrane structure. The expression of E-and N-cadherin was measured by immunofluorescence and western blot, respectively. Mouse blastocysts were placed in co-culture with a confluent HEC-1A monolayer, and were monitored up to 72 hrs. The rate of trophoblast cell invasion was determined by measuring the mean area of outgrowing embryos using Image J. RESULTS: Based on deflection images, extensions around the cells (lamellipodia) were longer in TGF-b group than controls. In addition, TGF-b decreased cell height as measured from surface topographic AFM images (p<0.05 versus controls). Combined optical and AFM imaging of cells detected structural changes including filopodia and lamellopodia that were associated with cell spreading. A significant increase of E-cadherin expression and decrease of N-cadherin level were detected by both immunofluorescence and western blot (p<0.05 versus controls). This cadherin expression strongly suggested that the EMT took place. Blastocyst outgrowth was increased in the TGF-b treated HEC-1A cells as compared to controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate for the first time that one of the early embryonic products, TGF-b, induces EMT and promotes embryo attachment to human endometrial epithelial cells, which may reveal the role of TGF-b in trophoblast invasion and implantation. The quantitative imaging and measurements used in this study may pave the way for systematic correlation of membrane structural features with the biological status of endometrial epithelial cells.",

During the process of implantation an interaction of cytokines and the FasL-bearing trophoblast seems to be responsible for maternal cell death to create the necessary space for a proper invasion. Furthermore, EECs with Sdc-1 kd show a higher apoptotic susceptibility mediated by lower expression of antiapoptotic proteins before induction of apoptosis and higher expression of death receptors during apoptotic cell death. Hence, Sdc-1 seems to be involved in the regulation EEC apoptosis and therewith being a crucial mediator for regular implantation. This study focuses on exploring the progesterone-regulated genes in the stromal compartment of receptive endometrium in fertile women. Understanding the mechanism of progesterone action in stromal cells will lead to better understanding of different molecules involved in endometrial receptivity.The current findings point to the importance of stromal cells in regulating the paracrine or juxtacrine action of epithelial cells, driving the endometrium towards a receptive state. METHODS: Stromal cells from LH+7 endometrial biopsies were isolated by laser capture microdissection and RNA was extracted. Microarray was performed and reconfirmation for selective genes confirmed by using RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: 121 genes were significantly regulated with fold change greater than two. Reconfirmation of microarray results for selective genes by RT-PCR showed significant up regulation in the expression of SFRP4, CTSC, SMARCA1, CPM and HMGN5 and down regulation of MT1G, MT2A with progesterone depletion. Immunohistochemistry was performed for SCGB2A2, SNORA3, BCL11A, ATP6V0E1, CTSC and STC1 of which STC1 and CTSC showed a similar trend in the expression of protein.

When comparing the outcomes of the two treatments in the different age groups, it ensued that in women age 40, IVF PR was superior to that of mini-stim IUI (15% vs. 3%, P=0.032), while in women age 41 and above, IVF and mini-stim IUI have similar PR (7% vs. 7% p=0.866).

CONCLUSIONS: Mini-stim IUI was found to have similar pregnancy rate as IVF in women above the age of 41, validating its use in this age group as an alternative to IVF given the similar success rate, lower costs, and improved lifestyle. However, when pregnancy outcomes were compared, IVF outcomes were significantly better. A larger study is required to clarify the above results. Discovering a mechanism to explain the effect of diet-induced obesity, which leads to poor oocytes and embryos as well as growth retardation and brain abnormalities in offspring, may lead to therapeutic targets in obese women. METHODS: Four-week old female C57Bl6/J mice were fed ad libitum a control diet or an obesogenic diet (58% fat/sucrose; HFD) for 16 weeks. Mice were superovulated by an inter-peritoneal injection with PMSG alone (GV) or hCG and PMSG (MII). 48 hours later, oocytes were collected in M2 media and cumulus cells removed by mechanical aspiration (GV) or exposure to hyaluronidase (MII). Western blot was performed using antibodies against the PDHE1a subunit of PDC, the phosphorylated PDHE1a subunit, and PGC1a. Quantification of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated PDC was done using ImageJ. RESULTS: Western blot analysis was used to evaluate protein levels of the mitochondrial biogenesis gene PGC-1a and the inactivated and activated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) by analysis of serine 293-phosphoyrlyation of the catalytic PDHE1a subunit. Western blot of GV oocytes for PDC revealed an increased ratio of the phosphorylated, inactivated PDHE1a subunit compared to total PDE1a levels. At the MII stage, there was no detectable PDHE1a phosphorylation in control diet oocytes, but there was phosphorylation in HFD oocytes. Western blot of GV oocytes for thePGC1a revealed an increased level of PGC1a in HFD mice. A transgenic mouse line will be utilized to conditionally remove one allele of the PDHE1a gene in oocytes to determine how inactivation of PDC affects oocyte quality. CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation of the PDC is occurring in oocytes from HFD mice, which could be leading to decreased ATP levels (observed previously) and abnormal spindles in oocytes of HFD mice. We expect to see a similar phenotype from mice conditionally lacking one allele of PDC in their oocytes due to these results. Additionally, GV oocytes from HFD mice have an increase in PGC1a, an important transcription factor promoting mitochondrial biogenesis. Due to the higher proportion of abnormal mitochondria in seen in oocytes from HFD mice, this increase in PGC1a suggests a compensatory increase in mitochondrial biogenesis to replace the damaged mitochondria. INTRODUCTION: New evidence suggests that paternal age at time of conception may be associated with adverse health effects in the offspring, but its effect on the offspring's reproductive performance and their long term health is unclear. METHODS: 8-to 12-wk spontaneously ovulating CF1 female mice (n=30) were mated with the same 4 B6D2F1/J males at 4, 12 and 18 mon. of age, generating 3 sets of litters with the same fathers: F4, F12, F18 (offspring whose fathers were 4, 12 or 18 mon. of age at conception).",

RESULTS: There was a trend toward a longer time needed to conceive for older fathers (F4; 17 days, F12; 22, F18; 45), but litters were not significantly different in size from those produced by younger fathers. Birth weights were significantly greater in F12 offspring but there was no difference in offspring weight gain between the three groups. In addition, there was no evidence of glucose intolerance in F4, F12 and F18 offspring. Interestingly, increasing paternal age (F4 vs. F18) was associated with offspring having a shorter anogenital distance and decreased sperm concentration and motility. Although decreased, testis weight and androgens, did not reach statistical significance. NKT cells are a unique subset of lymphocytes that bridge the innate and adaptive limbs of the immune response. We hypothesized that NKT cells play a key role in the maintenance of maternal-fetal immune tolerance and their activation may lead to preterm birth.

METHODS: Early proliferative (n = 5), mid proliferative (n = 5), late proliferative (n = 5), early secretory (n = 5), mid secretory (n = 5) and late secretory phase (n = 5) endometrial samples were analyzed for immunoreactive (ir) ezrin and radixin by immunohistochemical analysis and double immunoflorescence cytochemistry (from proliferative and secretory phases, n=3/phase). Differences in HSCORE values among different phases of normal endometrium were analyzed by using one-way ANOVA test. Differences in HSCORE values comparing glandular cells with stromal cells from the same endometrial phase were analyzed using Student's t-test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Ir-radixin was present but ir-ezrin was absent in stromal cells throughout the normal endometrium. Ir-radixin in stromal cells reached to its highest expression during mid to late secretory phases (p<0.05). Both ir-radixin and ir-ezrin were present in luminal epithelium and glandular cells throughout the normal endometrium. Ir-ezrin was densely expressed in glandular cells during the mid secretory phase compared to that of the proliferative phase (p<0.05). Ir-ezrin and ir-radixin were clearly expressed in glandular pinopodes and microvilli. Pinopodes are spongelike smooth membrane projections that are present around the presumed time of embryo implantation. Double immunoflorescence cytochemistry confirmed the intense ir-radixin and ir-ezrin on glandular pinopodes and microvilli during the secretory phase.

Irisin, a recently identified myokine, demonstrates a role on brown adipose tissue production and an effect on metabolism and may make a contribution to weight regulation. The production of irisin in muscle is activated by exercise, but some recent reports suggest that production may also occur in adipose tissue. In the present study, we have examined irisin levels in lean and obese pregnant women in the first, second and third trimester and, in a separate group of morbidly obese ",

Biological Regulation, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. INTRODUCTION: Dominant follicles (DF) acquire their selective advantage by creating a richer vasculature structure that allows them to accumulate higher concentrations of hormones. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive this differential angiogenic capacity between DF and the subordinate follicles (SF) are yet to be revealed. Atresia of the SF might be caused by the secretion of anti-angiogenic factors from the DF to the environment. Under this hypothesis, we expect to observe increased concentration of anti-angiogenic factors mRNA in the DF, and a high level of their protein in the SF. In addition, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is known to have an important role in regulating angiogenesis; hence Induced activation of AKT1 in endothelial cells is expected to cause an extensive angiogenic reaction. Such manipulation in mouse ovaries may result in the selection of a larger number of DF, whereas in the long term it might lead to premature ovarian failure. In this study we aim at characterizing the role of anti angiogenic factors and endothelial AKT1 on DF selection and ovarian reserve preservation.",

In myrAKT1 mice, increased expression of CD34 (a marker for young blood vessels) was observed around antral follicles as well as young, mainly secondary, follicles. However, no difference in number of ovulated oocytes was found. For further examination of the 3D ovarian vasculature of myrAKT1 mice we plan to use the three dimensional imaging of solvent cleared organs (3DISCO) method, that will enable a complete view on the entire ovary. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis regarding anti angiogenic factors secretion from the DF. The impact of the myrAKT1 induced extensive angiogenesis is not yet determined. Understanding the angiogenic process that motivates DF selection can help us improve assisted reproductive technologies and promote the understanding of fertility disorders. Maternal obesity is associated with decreased reproductive fi tness. Even in regularly ovulating women, obesity is linked with increased miscarriage, longer time to pregnancy, decreased lifetime fertility, and corpus luteum (CL) insuffi ciency. Molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Animal models for obesity-related subfertility are needed for mechanistic studies but are currently unavailable. Vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops) are an Old World nonhuman primate that develops obesity and has a menstrual cycle similar to humans. METHODS: 10 adult regularly menstruating female vervets consumed a high fat, high fructose (HFHF) or control diet for 10 months. The fi rst day of low serum estradiol after the follicular peak defi ned luteal phase. Luteectomy was done, before and after dietary intervention on luteal days 7-9, and CL was confi rmed by histology. RNA was isolated and mRNA libraries were prepared and sequenced using TruSeq RNA kit for Illumina HiSeq. Sequences were identifi ed, and TopHat and Cuffl inks were used for alignment and discovery of differential gene expression with a false discovery rate less than 1 percent. Changes in mRNA transcripts levels in response to diet were tested by ANOVA in R. Changes in weight and fat mass (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) were correlated with gene expression. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to identify networks of interest. In women, the peptide hormone relaxin is secreted by the corpus luteum throughout the duration of pregnancy. Elevated maternal circulating relaxin concentrations during pregnancy are associated with an increased incidence of preterm birth. Relaxin has pronounced effects upon connective tissue architecture due to reorganization of collagen fi brils and regulation of matrix metalloproteinase expression. In prior studies using a rhesus monkey model, extensive effects of relaxin upon cervical connective tissue were observed including rearrangement and decreased content of cervical collagen and extensive fragmentation and alteration of elastic fi bers. Fibulin 5, a 66 kDa extracellular matrix glycoprotein, is expressed mainly in elastic fi ber enriched tissues and is essential for normal elastin fi ber formation and integrity. Mice lacking fi bulin 5 have irregular and fragmented elastic fi bers. The morphological appearance of the vagina of fi bulin 5 defi cient knockout mice closely resembles that of the relaxin stimulated rhesus monkey cervix. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that relaxin exerts its effects upon cervical elastic fi bers by regulating fi bulin 5 expression. METHODS: Human lower uterine segment fibroblasts, a well characterized in vitro model of human cervix, were plated in replicate wells, estrogen primed for 72 hours and incubated without or with human relaxin (10 ng/ml) for 72 hours. In addition, since in other cell types fibulin 5 expression is regulated by TGF-b, estrogen primed cells were also incubated with TGF-b (1 ng/ml) for 72 hours. Three independent experiments were performed, each in triplicate. Cell lysates were assessed for fibulin 5 protein concentrations by Western blot analysis using a specific mouse anti-human fibulin 5 monoclonal antibody. Data were assessed using nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Cellular fibulin 5 protein expression was inhibited by relaxin to 59.9% of that of control cells.",

Because heparin reverses these effects, vaginal heparin may be a therapeutic adjunct to prevent preterm labor in pregnant women with candidal vaginal colonization. immunologic changes may induce a state of increased susceptibility. Pregnancies complicated by sepsis and septic shock are associated with increased rates of fetal infection and preterm delivery. Previously, we reported that the haemodynamic response to endotoxaemia is altered during gestation, accompanied by changes in leukocyte infiltration and serum VEGF levels. In this study we investigated the roles of nitric oxide (NO) and progesterone (P4) in modulating this haemodynamic response. METHODS: Female CD1 mice were implanted with PA-C10 radiotelemetry device (DSI, Netherlands) into the left common carotid artery. Non-pregnant (nP) baseline recordings were taken for 48h, 7-10 days post-surgery. Mice were then timed-mated and recordings were resumed at mid-gestation and then at E15 until labour. Mice were given 10mg P4 or vehicle control s/c on consecutive days E14-E16. On E16 this was followed by intraperitoneal injection of LPS (10\u00b5g 0111:B4). Further cohorts (both pregnant and nP controls) were used for tissue harvest at 6 and 12h following LPS for the analysis of NO, cytokines and inflammatory markers. RESULTS: Whilst latency to labour after LPS was significantly increased from 21.5\u00b12.07 to 98\u00b111.83 h (p<0.001) after pre-treatment with P4, none of the pups survived. Vehicle-treated animals had very similar haemodynamic profiles to untreated mice following LPS (hypotensive response); where those pre-treated with P4 did not undergo the same decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and systolic arterial pressure (SAP). P4 attenuated these decreases in MAP and SAP to baseline levels and the SAP maximal decrease was significantly reduced (p<0.05). NO levels in serum were significantly increased after LPS treatment at 6 and 12h (p<0.05); however this effect was significantly attenuated in pregnant mice compared to nP controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Giving P4 to pregnant mice did not cause further hypotensive responses to LPS, thus suggesting P4 is not responsible for the increased susceptibility to infection in pregnancy. As NO levels were attenuated in pregnant animals in endotoxaemia, taken with a hypotensive response, these data may suggest an increase in sensitisation to the vasodilator action of NO. (Usp) in pregnancy is common (~50%), and Usp are the most commonly isolated bacteria from the amniotic cavity following PTB, most women with vaginal Usp colonisation will not develop intrauterine infection / inflammation or deliver preterm. Little is known of the maternal T cell response to Usp. Recent studies suggest the quality of a T cell response to infection is determined by the production of multiple cytokines: polyfunctionality. We hypothesised that the nature of the maternal immune response to vaginal Usp colonisation is predictive of risk of infection-related PTB; specifically, a positive T cell response is indicative of primed T cells. METHODS: Maternal whole bloods for this ongoing study were collected at ~126;20 weeks' gestation from 30 consenting participants. Current Usp vaginal colonisation status was determined by self-collected vaginal swabs. Following in vitro Usp stimulation, multi-parameter flow cytometry was used to characterise T cell cytokine secretion profiles (IL-2, IFN-g, TNF-a) of participants. We assessed polyfunctional T cell responses that result in optimal and sustained protection -a more effective immune response to a pathogen than cells that produce only a single cytokine. RESULTS: 12 Usp-positive and 18 Usp-negative women have been recruited to date; pregnancy outcomes are not yet available on all women. Usp stimulation of whole blood from Usp+ women resulted in significantly higher frequency of IFN-g producing CD4 + T cells. Both Usp+ and Usp-women exhibit CD4 + T cell polyfunctionality in response to Usp stimulation, with an increased percentage of CD4 + T cells producing multiple cytokines evident in Usp+ women. Some Usp+ women exhibit an exaggerated CD4 + T cell response; the clinical implications of this response are not yet known. CONCLUSIONS: Using multi-colour flow cytometry we have shown that cytokine profiles of CD4 + T cells in maternal blood correlate with vaginal colonisation with Usp. Studies aimed at correlating the polyfunctional CD4 + T cell response with pregnancy outcome (e.g. PTB) and the quality of CD8 + and memory T cells are ongoing. ) were added to the amniotic compartment. Accumulation of IL-10, IL-6, TNF-a, MCP-1 and PGE 2 were measured in fetal and maternal conditioned media after 12 h incubation. For the sheep study, amniotic fluid and fetal and maternal blood samples were collected over 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h from chronically catheterised animals (116 d gestation) post IA stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 mg) with/without 0.875 mg OxZ or 2.8 mg TPCA-1 delivered IA. RESULTS: 16 singleton and five twin pregnancies have been recruited to date with maternal age, gravidity/parity, gestational age, sex and birthweight consistent across groups. 12 pregnancies were +INF, with Ureaplasma spp. identified in 3/12, Staph. aureus in 1/12, E. coli in 1/12 and clinical chorioamnionitis in 2/12. Of the five drugs tested, OxZ (TAK1 inhibitor) and TPCA-1 (IKKb inhibitor) were most effective at inhibiting amniotic accumulation of cytokines and PGE 2 , with inhibitory effects of 50-70%. These two drugs had greatest effect on amniotic production of PGE 2 /IL-6 in +INF membranes, and TNF-a/MCP1 in -INF membranes. In the sheep model an inhibition of PGE 2 , IL-6 and IL-8 accumulation was seen in amniotic fluid of LPS stimulated animals following IA treatment with OxZ or TPCA-1, with reduced cytokine levels in fetal plasma. CONCLUSIONS: IA administration of selected CSAIDs could be an effective treatment, in combination with antibiotics, for intrauterine inflammation and prevention of PTB. INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory pathways are important pharmacological targets for prevention of preterm birth and its associated infant mortality and morbidity. We are investigating the use of cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs (CSAIDs) to prevent preterm birth. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, toxicity and targets of a novel CSAID, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol (OxZNL), on human primary amnion, chorion and placental cells. OxZNL is a natural antibiotic product extracted from yeast, reported to be a specific, potent and irreversible inhibitor of TAK1 kinase activity. TAK1 activation is key step in the NF-kB and MAPK signalling pathways.",

Isolated cells were stimulated with a range of bacteria: E. coli, Peptostreptococcus anearobius, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus or Ureaplasma parvum. Stimulated cells were treated with the TAK1 inhibitor (OxZNL) at a range of doses (0.1-10 \u00b5M). Cell culture supernatants were collected for assay of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-a and MCP-1) and prostaglandins (PGE 2 ); cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Activation of NF-kB signalling was assessed by immunostaining for phosphorylated p65/RelA subunit and expression of a luciferase reporter construct. RESULTS: Treatment of primary decidual and trophoblast cells stimulated with either Gram-ve or Gram+ve bacterial extracts with OxZNL resulted in inhibition of IL-6, TNF-a, PGE2 and MCP-1 production in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 of approx. 0.5-1.5 \u00b5M). Primary decidual cells showed no toxicity of OxZNL up to 10 \u00b5M, whilst trophoblasts showed some evidence of toxicity at >3 \u00b5M. Treatment with OxZNL (10 \u00b5M) appears to block nuclear translocation of phosphorylated-p65 at 2 h in decidual cells in response to Gram-ve stimulation. LPS-induced NF-kB activity in NF-kB reporter cells was inhibited by OxZNL at concentrations \u22650.1 \u00b5M. CONCLUSIONS: OxZNL is a potent inhibitor of placental inflammatory activation, exerting effects at concentrations as low as 0.1 \u00b5M. TAK1 is an attractive pharmacological target as its inhibition blocks pathological inflammatory activation without inhibiting constitutive NF-kB activity involved in homeostasis and tissue development. Further exploration of the use of OxZNL in preterm birth prevention is warranted. Every term or preterm delivery is an inflammatory event as uterine tissues release pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-1b, a key cytokine, stimulates the parturient process by increasing uterine activation protein levels. IL-1b binds to two receptors, IL1RI and IL1RII. An accessory protein, IL-1RAcP, then binds to the ligand-receptor complex leading to signal transduction. Rytvela, a specific allosteric antagonist of IL-1RAcP, delays IL-1b-induced preterm delivery in mice. The accepted view is that IL-1Rs and IL-1RAcP are ubiquitously expressed. In this study we hypothesized that mRNA abundance of IL-1Rs and IL-1RAcP is constant in late gestation Long-Evans rat uteri. METHODS: Upper and lower whole uterine tissues were isolated from rats (n=5) on gestational days (GD) 17, 20, 21 and in labor. The mRNA abundance of IL-1RI, IL-1RII, IL-1RAcP, and IL-1RAcPb (found only in brain) were analyzed using RT-PCR. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test was used to evaluate results. RESULTS: IL-1RI mRNA abundance increased 3-fold in upper and lower uterine segments over the last 5 days of pregnancy (p<0.05, 0.001). There was no change in the mRNA abundance of IL-1RII. IL-1RAcP mRNA abundance increased 2-fold in both uterine segments (p<0.01, 0.05) during late gestation, but surprisingly, IL-1RAcPb increased 4-fold in lower uterine segment (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data to describe increases in uterine sensitivity to IL-1b in late gestation and suggest another level of regulation for control of delivery. Importantly, the unexpected finding of increased IL-1RAcPb suggests a possible physiological association between brain and uterine activities in late gestation.

The objective of the present study was to identify the role of Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) during infection-induced preterm labor in mice by studying the chaperone proteins Hsp90, Hsc70, Hsp60 and Hsp25. CMA is an intracellular catabolic pathway that mediates the degradation of a select subset of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes. The CMA is normal machinery in all cell types, by which cells selectively remove altered or damaged proteins. The cytosolic chaperone proteins bind to substrate proteins and direct them to the surface of the lysosomal membrane, where they interact with lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP2A). This leads to internalization followed by unfolding and rapid degradation by lysosomal enzymes. LAMP2A multimer disassembly is required for the binding of chaperone-substrate proteins complexes, while assembly leads to translocation of unfolded protein into lysosome. These conformational changes of LAMP2a are regulated by Hsp (heat-shock protein) 90. The purpose of this study was to examine the commonalities and differences in patterns of risk for preterm birth (PTB) by gestational age groupings (< 32 and 32-36 weeks) and by whether the birth occurred spontaneously or was medically indicated. METHODS: Included were 140,216 euploid singleton pregnancies with first and second trimester serum screening in 2009 and 2010 in California and had linked birth certificate and hospital discharge records. Logistic regression was used to compare patterns of maternal characteristics and biomarkers in PTB groups compared to term groupings using odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: While the magnitude of observed risks often differed, there were numerous maternal characteristics and serum markers for which associations were observed across groupings. The most commonly observed patterns were for hypertension, previous PTB, and second trimester alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) \u2265 the 95th percentile (Table 1) . Between one in four preterm births in each category had at least one of these risks present (21.3% to 51.9%). Most notably, pregnancies resulting in either early or late preterm birth who had a spontaneous or a medically indicated delivery were more than six to more than sixty-three times as likely to have preexisting or gestational diabetes compared to term pregnancies (ORs 6.3 to 63.7, 95% CIs 5.8 to 99.8). CONCLUSIONS: When maternal clinical characteristics and serum markers are considered across PTB groups similar patterns of risk emerge. Patterns suggest epidemiologic and clinical features that appear to be contributing similarly. can delay preterm labor and reduce fetal lung injury. Neonatal outcomes following this treatment have not yet been assessed. The objective of this study is to examine the neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes of prematurely born non-human primate (NHP) infants following IAI and antenatal AZI therapy. METHODS: Catheterized pregnant rhesus macaques were assigned to control (n=2), IAI (n=2) and AZI (infection plus treatment, n=2) groups. Intra-amniotic inoculation was perfomed at ~120 days gestation with U. parvum (serovar 1; 10 5 cfu). AZI animals received treatment (25mg/kg/d; IV) for 10 days. C-section deliveries were performed at 141-152d gestation (term=168d). Infants were transferred to our Special Care Nursery where they received 24hr clinical and veterinary care, including respiratory support, IV fluids/nutrition and gavage feeding. Modified APGAR scores were recorded at 5 and 30min after delivery. Motor, sensorimotor and survival reflexes were measured 3 times/wk from birth. Morphometric data were collected regularly throughout the neonatal period and Primate Neonatal Neurobehavioral Assessments (eg. object permanence tests) were performed over a 6mth follow up period. RESULTS: Clinical care needs were higher and APGAR scores lower (2 vs 7\u00b11) in IAI infants compared AZI animals. All infants exhibited a range of species-specific social and individual behaviors. Individual variation between animals was observed for age at criterion reached for developmental sensorimotor, motor and survival reflexes and performance in cognitive tests. AZI animals reached criterion at an earlier postnatal age for plain reach and object permanence tests, potentially due to later gestational age at birth.",

Early observations show clear differences in levels of clinical care required and suggest cognitive and learning deficits in IAI infants compared to AZI treated animals. This novel maternal-fetal-neonatal NHP model of premature birth is unique in its ability to test therapies during pregnancy that may improve neonatal outcome. Considerably less well understood is the involvement of non-prostanoid eicosanoids in normal pregnancy and parturition. Derived from the lipoxygenase-mediated catalysis of arachidonic acid, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) have been detected in fetal membranes, decidua and myometrium obtained following the onset of labour. Levels of 12-HETE, a product of 12-lipoxygenase, are also significantly raised in the amniotic fluid and placentae of women in labour. The pro-inflammatory effects of 12-HETE suggests a role for this lipid in inflammation accompanying pregnancy. We sought to test the hypothesis that 12-HETE promotes release of proinflammatory cytokines from maternal and fetal leukocytes. METHODS: Leukocytes were isolated from cord and placental blood from healthy, pregnant women at term (38-42 weeks) following informed written consent. Cells (1 million /well) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide in combination with either BzATP (stimulates IL-1b release), or 12-HETE. Supernatants were harvested and cytokines detected by ELISA. Immunofluorescence and western blotting were carried out to determine expression of immunoreactive 12-lipoxygenase in cord blood and placental leukocytes. A minimum of 6-12 samples were used in all experiments. RESULTS: Cord blood and placental leukocytes express the enzyme 12-LOX. Pretreatment of both cord blood (n = 6) and placental leukocytes (n = 6) with LPS and 12-HETE resulted in increased production of IL-6 compared with untreated cells (n = 12; P < 0.001) but not with 12-HETE alone (n = 12; P > 0.05). The increase in IL-6 levels was significantly greater from placental leukocytes than from cord blood leukocytes (P < 0.01). 12-HETE either with or without LPS had no effect on IL-1b release (n = 12; P > 0.05).",

ET formation has been described in pre-eclamptic patients. Our hypothesis was that cord and maternal blood leukocytes can be stimulated to produce ETs and may predict pregnancy complications including preterm birth. The aim of our study was to demonstrate ET formation (ETosis) by cord blood and maternal leukocytes. METHODS: Maternal and cord blood leukocytes were purified from normal pregnant women and placentae following informed consent. Cells were stimulated with range of agonists that cause ETosis. These included phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), LPS and the calcium ionophore A23187. DNA release from leukocytes was measured using the cell-impermeable DNA-binding dye Sytox green using a fluorescence plate-based assay. Expression of the enzymes myeloperoxidase and elastase as well as ETs themeselves was tested using immunofluorescence. RESULTS: PMA, LPS and A23187 treatment led to the externalisation of DNA from cord blood leukocytes cells compared with control, untreated cells (n = 8 per treatment). This process was concentration-dependent (P< 0.01; Dunnet's test). Peripheral blood leukocytes isolated from maternal blood exhibited a similar response to agonists. There was no significant difference in sytox green fluorescence between maternal and cord blood leukoscytes.

Parturition research group, Imperial College London, United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION: Preterm birth accounts for the majority of neonatal morbidity and mortality and is often associated with infection and/ or inflammation. Labour is clinically characterized by myometrial contractions, but fetal membrane remodelling and cervical ripening precede it, in association with NF-kB activation and cytokine and prostaglandin synthesis in amnion. It is well established that OT stimulates uterine contractions in myometrium but it has been shown that in human amnion, OT binds to OTR, which couples with G ai , to activate MAPKs and NF-kB leading to increased PG and inflammatory chemokine/cytokine synthesis. Therefore, suggesting that OT plays a role in parturition beyond the final contractions by activating inflammation. We investigated the effect of OT on NF-kB and the expression of its downstream regulatory genes including prostaglandin synthetic enzymes and cytokines. METHODS: Term, pre-labour myometrial cells were stimulated with OT (100nM), with or without pre-treatment with OTR antagonists, atosiban (10\u00b5M) or ornitine vasotosin (OVT; 1\u00b5M). Total RNA was extracted for qPCR analysis and whole cell lysates were used for Western blots. All data sets were presented with S.E.M and p<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: OT increased degradation of IkBa and phosphorylation of NF-kB p65, thereby inducing nuclear translocation of p65 and p50 (p<0.05, ANOVA). OT stimulation resulted in activation of MAPKs, ERK1/2, p38 kinase and JNK, as well as increase in mRNA expression of downstream NF-kB regulated genes such as COX-2, cPLA 2 , IL-8, and IL-6 (p<0.05, ANOVA). Pre-treatment with OTR antagonist, atosiban, attenuated the effects of OT on MAPKs and COX-2 expression, but not NF-kB. However, we found the OTR-specific antagonist, OVT, is more potent in inhibiting OT-mediated activation of NF-kB and MAPKs, and the upregulation of COX-2 and p-cPLA 2 . CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that OT not only has contractile effects in the myometrium but also has proinflammatory effects. This can play a role in the current use of tocolytics and provide new insights for the future development of tocolytics. The expressions of ECE-1 and NEP in amnion epithelial cell (HAEC) or mesenchymal cell (HAMC) with treatment of LPS and the inhibitor of TLR-4 were examined by Western blotting (WB). After intraperitoneal administration of 5 mg/ml of LPS or PBS into pregnant mice on E15, the expressions of ECE-1 and NEP in placenta were examined by WB.",

Furthermore the pharmacological inhibition of OTR action by ATS (100 nM) markedly reversed the decline in MCL1 expression caused by OT. These findings demonstrate that withdrawal of uterine anti-apoptotic signaling in the postpartum period is likely mediated by increased OT-OTR action. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that MCL1 is a critical mediator of the uterine post-partum remodeling process and in this study we have confirmed OT and it receptor act as novel regulators of MCL1.

In order to obtain sufficient numbers of myocytes per experiment, it is often necessary to passage cells but there exists concerns that passaged myocytes are not phenotypically representative of myometrium in vivo. Therefore this study aimed to determine the effect of passage on the expression levels of key labour associated proteins and their ability to functionally respond to contractile and inflammatory stimuli. METHODS: Using Western blotting, levels of OTR, PR, GR and a-SMA were examined from proteins extracted from lower segment of myometrial tissue collected during elective caesarean section and corresponding cell cultures from passage 0 (P0) to P10. The effect of cell passage on myocyte calcium release was examined using confocal microscopy and time lapse images taken during treatment with butaprost, a PGE 2 agonist and oxytocin. Activation of NFkB and AP1 was also examined by Western blot analysis in passaged myocytes via inflammatory stimulation using LPS (serotypes 055, 0111, 0127 and 0128), TNFa and IL-1b. RESULTS: While levels of the labour-associated proteins remained consistent from P0-P10, a marked change was observed between tissue and passaged cells. PR, a-SMA and OTR were significantly decreased in passaged cells compared to original tissue levels where as GR was significantly increased in passaged cells. Butaprost and oxytocin treatment successfully induced calcium influx in passaged myocytes up to P10. Activation of NFkB and AP1 was achieved in passaged myocytes via inflammatory stimulation in a patient specific manner. TLR4 protein levels remained consistent across treatment and passage. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that although the culture process leads to changes in the basal levels of key labour associated proteins, the biochemical phenotype of cultured myocytes and their ability to respond to inflammatory stimuli is largely retained throughout long-term passage.",

One major cause of dystocia is abnormal contractility, though the cellular mechanisms are unclear. Previously, we reported in abstract form that the CFP mRNA transcriptome is altered in women with dystocia. Gene pathways analysis showed the strongest differences identified were in CFP mRNAs encoding for the small ubiquitin-related protein (SUMO-1), a DNA repair protein, and for proteins involved in its regulation (SAE1, SAE2, AKT3). We now hypothesize that CFP non-coding small RNAs (miRs) are also altered in women with dystocia. We further hypothesize these CFP miRs are part of the underlying pathology, and as such, may act as biomarkers in women destined for dystocia.",

            "text": "In this study, we have investigated which of these transcription factors are downstream of MKP-1 and account for the repression observed in human myometrial. METHODS: Primary cultures of human myometrial cells were exposed to IL-1b (5ng/mL) and P4 (10 uM), either alone or in combination for 6 h. Cells were transiently transfect cells with siRNA and RNA or protein extracted after incubations. Total RNA was converted to cDNA. Copy numbers of COX-2 and GAPDH were measured by qPCR using a Rotor-Gene. Protein extracts were analyzed by western blotting (n=4-6). Co-IP assays were performed using antibodies against the protein of interest and or pre-immune IgG and the protein-antibody complexes were subjected to western blot analysis. RESULTS: Firstly, we confirmed that GR mediated P4 repression of IL-1b-induced COX-2 mRNA resulted in similar changes at the protein level. P4 significantly reduced IL-1b-induced c-Jun phosphorylation (p<0.05), although this was not seen in MKP-1 depleted cells. We found no evidence of binding of GR and c-Jun in the nuclei of cells in co-IP experiments . In addition, P4 did not delay the IL-1b-induced nuclear transfer of c-Jun. MKP-1 knockdown did not completely reverse the effect of P4 suggesting that additional mechanisms may be involved. Although P4 did not alter c-Jun expression at transcription level, it significantly reduced this transcription factor at protein level (p<0.05). This effect was apparent after 6 and up to 24 h of P4 treatment. Conversely, overexpression of c-Jun attenuated the negative effect of P4 on IL-1b-induced COX-2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data show dual inhibitory effects of P4 on AP-1 activity, on the one hand attenuating the IL-1b-induced c-Jun phosphorylation via a GR-mediated increase in MKP-1 activity and on the other through a reduction in c-Jun protein levels. Previously we demonstrated that PGF2a stimulates COX-2 and IL-6 mRNA and protein abundance in HMSMC via its receptor, PTGFR, and that IL-1B stimulates PTGFR, COX-2 and IL-6 mRNA and protein abundance in HMSMC. We hypothesized that IL-1B elevation of PTGFR would correspondingly increase the ability of PGF2a to stimulate UAPs. METHODS: HMSMC were treated for 24h with DMEM only, followed by 6h PGF2a (10 -7 to 10 -5 M) and extracted for mRNA abundance determination by real-time RT-PCR. A second set of cells was treated for 24h with IL-1B (5 ng/mL) then washed and treated for another 6h with IL-1B alone or with PGF2a (10 -7 to 10 -5 M). N=3 patients, ANOVA followed by LSD post hoc testing (p\u22640.05). RESULTS: 6h of PGF2a treatment (alone) increased relative mRNA abundance for COX-2 by 8.1-fold (p<0.05) and IL-6 by 12.4-fold (p<0.01). Cells treated with 24h IL-1b followed by 6h DMEM increased relative mRNA abundance for PTGFR by 6.2-fold, COX-2 by 273-fold (p<0.01), and IL-6 by 1368-fold (p<0.05). IL-1b treatment for 24h followed by 6h of PGF2a treatment increased COX-2 mRNA abundance synergistically 414-fold and increased IL-6 mRNA abundance by 1988fold. Washing cells pretreated with 1L-1b for 24h then treating again with IL-1b for 6h had no further effect upon COX-2 mRNA abundance but when co-incubated for 6h with PGF2a and IL-1b, drove COX-2 mRNA to 887-fold (p<0.01). An additional 6h of IL-1b treatment increased IL-6 mRNA further, from 1368 to 1908-fold, while an additional 6h of IL-1b plus PGF2a increased IL-6 mRNA by 5957-fold (p<0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment of HMSMC with IL-1B increases PTGFR, and likely intracellular signaling intermediates, such that subsequent PGF2a stimulates extremely large synergistic increases in COX-2 and IL-6 mRNA abundance. These data suggest that in vivo preconditioning with IL-1B increases myometrial responsiveness to PGF2a tremendously thereby promoting a feed-forward amplification that activates the uterus for labour.

In primary amnion and myometrial cells, silibinin also decreased IL-1b-induced MMP-9 expression. Preterm fetal membranes with active infection treated with silibinin showed a decrease in IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-9 expression. Fetal brains from mice treated with silibinin showed a significant decrease in LPS-induced expression of IL-8 and a marker of brain injury, ninjurin. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that silibinin can reduce infection and inflammation-induced pro-labour mediators in human fetal membranes and myometrium. Further, silibinin decreases cytokine expression in preterm fetal membranes with active infection. Excitingly, the in vivo results indicate a protective effect of silibinin on infectioninduced brain injury in a mouse model of preterm birth. Collectively, silibinin may present a novel therapeutic to reduce the unacceptably high rates of neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with infectioninduced preterm birth. Human fetal membranes express 11b-HSD1 which regenerates cortisol from biologically inactive cortisone, and in turn cortisol induces 11b-HSD1 expression thus forming a feed-forward loop of cortisol regeneration towards the end of gestation. The physiological impact of this feed-forward loop remains largely unknown. Rupture of the fetal membranes is an indispensable process of labor onset. The strength of fetal membranes are maintained by collagens (COL) upon cross-linking by lysyl oxidase (LOX). We hypothesize that this feed-forward loop may be involved in collagen production in the fetal membranes thereby participating in the rupture of membranes. METHODS: Cultured primary human amnion fibroblasts were used. LOX and COL I, III mRNA and protein levels were examined after treatment with cortisol +/-RU486, an antagonist of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), or cortisone +/-carbenoxolone (CBX), an inhibitor of 11b-HSD1. Since cortisol is known to increase prostaglandin E2 production in the amnion fibroblasts, the role of PGE2 in the effect of cortisol was also examined. RESULTS: Both cortisol (0.01-1mM) and cortisone (5-50 mM) increased11b-HSD1 mRNA and protein levels, and decreased LOX and COL I,III mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner, which could be attenuated by RU486 (1 mM) and CBX (1 mM) respectively, suggesting the participation of GR and 11b-HSD1. PGE2 (0.001-10 mM) decreased LOX but not COL I,III levels in a concentration-dependent manner. PGE2 receptor antagonists (EP1 SC-19220; EP2 and EP3 AH6809, 10 mM) but not EP4 antagonist (L-161982, 10 mM) could block the effect of PGE2 on LOX, but none of them could block the effect of cortisol on LOX and COL. As PGE2 receptors are coupled with either PKA or PKC activation, the effects of inhibition of these pathways were also examined. Both adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536 (5 mM) and PKC inhibitor RO-31-8220 (1 mM) could partially attenuate the effect of PGE2 on LOX, but not the effect of cortisol on LOX and COL I, III. CONCLUSIONS: Cortisol regenerated by 11b-HSD1 in the fetal membranes may participate in the rupture of membranes via downregulation of LOX and COL expression, an effect appears to be mediated by GR but independent of PGE2.",

In humans, unchanging P4 expression suggests that labor is initiated by \"functional progesterone withdrawal (FPW)\" reflecting reduced PR expression and/or activity. Reports that chronic glucocorticoid treatment triggers preterm birth suggests possible GR mediation of FPW. Prior immunostaining of gestational age-matched pre-vs. post-labor decidua found: 1) decidual cells (DCs) from the latter contain significantly lower nuclear PR levels but no change in GR levels; 2) adjacent pre-and post-labor interstitial trophoblasts (IT) were devoid of PR, but contain similarly elevated GR levels. We posited that labor is associated with elevated term DC FKBP51 and that it is regulated by P4 and glucocorticoids. METHODS: Decidua basalis and parietalis were immunostained for FKBP51 and the cytoplasmic DC and IT markers, vimentin and cytokeratin. FKBP51 HSCORES were then compared in DCs and IT of gestational age-matched pre-vs. post-labor decidual sections. Cultured term DCs (n=3) were incubated with control, 10 -8 M estradiol (E2) or E2 + 10 -7 M Org2058, a pure progestin, or dexamethasone (DEX), a pure glucocorticoid. Immunoblotting assessed FKBP51 protein levels in nuclear extracts. RESULTS: FKBP51 HSCORES are significantly higher in DC nuclei of post-vs. pre-labor decidua basalis and parietalis (p<0.05), but immunoreactive FKBP51 is absent in ITs. In cultured DCs, immunoblotting of nuclear extracts indicates that FKBP51 is not induced by E2.

Despite the difference in voltage-activation, the b1-subunit increased the open dwell-times and decreased closed dwelltimes of MANG and MDAL in a similar manner, however, the b1-induced increase in burst duration in MDAL was reduced in MANG, which may explain the differences in voltage-activation.

We examined how changes in PCP4 expression affected contractility of human myometrial smooth muscle cells to test aspects of the hypothesis that a loss of PCP4 could potentiate enzymatic phosphorylation of myosin light chains and promote cell contractility. METHODS: PCP4 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by Q-rtPCR and Western blot. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to determine the localization of PCP4 in human myometrium. Collagen gel contraction was assessed in immortalized human myometrial smooth muscle cells that were modified so as to express PCP4 at levels consistent with primary cultures. The activities of myosin light chain kinase and rho kinase were determined by measuring phosphorylation of myosin light chains after stimulation with oxytocin and lysophosphatidic acid, respectively. Statistical differences between groups were compared by Student's t-Test. The percent change in gel contraction was compared by One-way ANOVA followed by the appropriate posttest. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: PCP4 expression was decreased in myometrium of spontaneous preterm labor women (positive histological chorioamnionitis, negative cultures). PCP4 localized primarily to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and had little affect on cytosolic calcium flux in cells stimulated with oxytocin. Basal, oxytocin-, and lysophosphatidic acid-induced collagen contraction was significantly inhibited in cells expressing PCP4, which coincided with the attenuation of myosin light chain phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: PCP4 can modulate in vitro contraction of myometrial smooth muscle cells. This effect could be due to its ability to block the phosphorylation of myosin light chains by myosin light chain kinase and/ or rho kinase. These data suggest that repression of PCP4 could enhance contractility of stimulated myometrial smooth muscle cells. Moreover, decreased expression in preterm labor myometrium, but not term labYor, implies that PCP4 could play a role in pathologic labor.",

METHODS: Normal fetal membranes (n= 10) collected at term were placed in an organ explant system and primary amnion epithelial cells were treated with water soluble cigarette smoke extract (wsCSE), an OS inducer (1:10). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was monitored using 2'7'-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein. Expression of nrf2 was enhanced with 10 mM/ml sulforaphane (SFN, 10 mM/ml), a natural component of cruciferous vegetables. Western blot was used to study expression changes of nrf2 and PPARg. HO-1 and TNF-a, a marker of inflammation, was quantified by ELISA. RESULTS: ROS in wsCSE-exposed amnion cells increased rapidly and significantly (p<0.01) at all-time points. wsCSE treatment of fetal membranes increased nrf2 expression (P < 0.01), HO-1 production (p = 0.007), decreased PPARg (p < 0.05) and increased TNF-a (p < 0.05) compared to untreated controls. SFN treatment alone had minimal effect on fetal membrane nrf2, HO-1, PPARg and TNF-a. However, co-stimulation of wsCSE and SFN further enhanced nrf2 and PPARg expression and reduced TNF-a compared to wsCSE alone (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ROS enhances nrf2 and HO-1 expression; however, its quantities are not sufficient to contain OS and inflammation. We demonstrate that SFN treatment augments nrf2 and subsequent increases in HO-1 and PPARg that can exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Future OS and inflammation associated PTB prevention strategies should consider the enhancement of nrf2 and its effects on pregnancy outcome.",

The role of this enzyme in PTB, however, is unclear. We hypothesized that PTB (with and without pPROM) would be associated with increased HO-1 concentrations in maternal plasma and amniotic fluid. METHODS: Maternal plasma and amniotic fluid samples from Caucasian and African-American women were collected at the diagnosis of spontaneous preterm labor (with or without pPROM), or term labor. Samples were assayed for HO-1 by ELISA. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of HO-1 were significantly higher in women with PTB when compared to term controls (P < 0.001). Cases with pPROM had slightly higher plasma concentrations of HO-1 than cases without pPROM (P = 0.035). A similar trend was found for amniotic fluid where cases with and without pPROM had higher concentrations of HO-1 (P < 0.001). However, levels did not differ between PTB cases with and without pPROM (P=0.631). HO-1 levels were also significantly impacted by maternal race. Term African-Americans had significantly higher plasma (P < 0.001; figure) , but tended to have lower amniotic fluid (P = 0.085), HO-1 concentrations than Caucasian controls. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma and amniotic fluid concentrations of HO-1 are increased in PTB with and without intact membranes. This suggests that HO-1 may be a sensitive biomarker for sub-clinical inflammation or oxidative stress that underlies this common pregnancy complication. Observed racial differences in amniotic fluid and plasma HO-1 concentrations suggests that HO-1 or oxidative stress may play a role in increased risk for PTB in African-American women.

RESULTS: IL-1\u00df increased IL-8 expression in a dose dependent manner. The amount of FCS in the media had no effect on the capacity for P4 via PR-B to inhibit IL-1\u00df-induced IL-8 expression. PR-A inhibited PR-B-mediated repression of IL-1\u00df-induced IL-8 expression only in cells cultured in 5% FCS; it had no effect in cells cultured in media containing 0.5% FCS. Similar effects of FCS on the repressive activity of PR-A were detected using a P4-responsive luciferase reporter assay. CONCLUSIONS: PR-A inhibition of PR-B is thought to be a key trigger for human parturition by inducing functional P4 withdrawal. Our data show that the repressive activity of PR-A can be inhibited in myometrial cells. Further studies to elucidate the mechanism of FCS effects on PR-A activity may reveal novel strategies to prevent preterm birth by suppressing PR-A-mediated functional P4 withdrawal. ",

We have shown that intrauterine injection of a TLR4-specific LPS (E. coli: serotype O111) induces AP-1 activation via JNK, causing PTL 7h post-injection (p.i.). In these animals, NF-kB is not activated. In contrast, TLR4KO mice show hypo-responsiveness to LPS treatment delivering around 42h p.i. The aim of this study was to identify AP-1 target genes in a murine model of inflammation-induced PTL. METHODS: Myometrial samples (n\u22654) were collected at 1, 2, 4 and 6h p.i. or during labour from wild type (wt) mice following intrauterine injection of 20\u00b5g LPS or PBS on gestation day 16. Samples were collected from TLR4KO mice treated with LPS or PBS at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 18h p.i. qPCR was used to examine expression levels of labour-associated genes containing AP-1 binding sites within the promoter. Protein levels were analysed by Western Blotting. RESULTS: COX-2 mRNA levels were increased in wt mice myometrium following LPS injection at 1 (p<0.05), 4 and 6h (p<0.001) compared to control animals. mRNA levels of inflammatory interleukins IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-8, as well as IL-10 were significantly increased in LPS treated mice. Similar responses were not exhibited by LPS treated TLR4KO mice where long-term AP-1 activation was not detected. IL-1b and Cx43 protein levels were significantly increased in response to LPS treatment. LPS treated wt mice showed increased levels of both the inactive precursor pro-IL-1b (31 kDa, p<0.001) and a 28 kDa product (p<0.05), resulting from post-translation processing of pro-IL-1b by caspase-1. Processing of IL-1b was abrogated in TLR4KO mice, indicating a key role for TLR4 in inflammasome-mediated IL-1b activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show TLR4-mediated AP-1 activation leads to subsequent expression of key inflammatory and contractionassociated genes thus highlighting AP-1 as a rational target for treatment strategies designed to prevent infection/inflammation-induced PTL. or ii) maternal IV AZ or SOLI and a single IA AZ or SOLI injection (1.4 mg/kg AZ; 0.14 mg/kg SOLI); or iii) single IV and IA vehicle injections. Animals were euthanized at 125 d GA. Treatment efficacy was assessed by AF UP culture and qPCR. Fetal lung, skin and membrane cytokine mRNA (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a and MCP-2) expression was measured with qPCR. RESULTS: AF from all control animals contained 10 5 -10 6 CCU UP. AF from all AZ or SOLI-treated animals (IV or IV + IA) were negative for viable UP, but positive for UP DNA. There was no significant difference in fetal lung or membrane cytokine/chemokine expression between treatment and control group. Small, but significant (p<0.05) reductions in fetal skin IL-6 (mean \u00b1 SD, relative units; 0.38 \u00b1 0.23 vs 1.02 \u00b1 0.22) and MCP-2 (0.30 \u00b1 0.31 vs 1.80 \u00b1 2.37) mRNA expression were detected in the IV SOLI only group compared to control. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with either IV or IV + IA AZ or SOLI successfully cleared intrauterine UP infection without affecting fetal inflammation. After 5 d of treatment, there was no benefit to combined IV and IA administration of either agent, relative to IV alone. Further studies to explore the clinical efficacy of AZ or SOLI to treat intrauterine UP infection are warranted.

We aimed to determine whether placental morphology is altered in FGR stillbirths compared to FGR live births and whether the phenotype in stillbirth results from cessation of uterine blood flow. METHODS: Human placental morphology was quantitatively assessed in wax-embedded placental samples from FGR stillbirth (n=13) and FGR live births (n=13), by screening for specific antigenic markers and features: ki67 (proliferation), CD31 (vessels), CD45 (leukocytes), -cytokeratin-7 (trophoblast) and syncytial nuclear aggregates. Image analysis was carried out on 10 images per tissue section. In addition, the effects of ex vivo maternal-side perfusion in the presence of static fetal blood in ligated placental cotyledons was assessed in FGR (n=5) and normal human placentas (n=7).

INTRODUCTION: Thresholds for cesarean section in pregnancies affected by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) vary between physicians and practice settings. We examined the success rate for vaginal delivery in patients with IUGR undergoing a trial of labor. We carried out a retrospective cohort study at a University Hospital with a low (20%) cesarean section rate. We specifically assessed pregnancies that had been identified by ultrasound to be affected by IUGR (intrauterine growth restriction), with or without fetal umbilical artery absent end diastolic flow (AEDF) or reversed end diastolic flow (REDF). METHODS: Ultrasound reports in which a patient received a diagnosis of IUGR, AEDF or REDF between the years 2007 and 2013 were identified. Patient data was analyzed in relation to patient characteristics, spontaneous or induced labor, type of delivery and indication for delivery. RESULTS: There were 77 patients with singleton pregnancies. 2 patients presented with stillbirth and were delivered via induction of labor, leaving 75 patients for analysis. Of the 75 patients, 20 (26.7%) presented with spontaneous labor or rupture of membranes. 14 (70%) of these patients went on to deliver vaginally and 6 (30%) had cesarean deliveries. The indication for cesarean delivery in this group was for non-reassuring fetal status in 2 of the 6 cases. 26 (34.7%) patients underwent an induction of labor. 20 (76.9%) of these went on to deliver vaginally. There were 6 (23.1%) cesarean deliveries in this group. All patients requiring cesarean delivery had non-reassuring fetal status listed as a diagnosis on the operative report. .

The mechanism of SPTB in women with uterine anomaly is unlikely to be primarily a cervical problem. INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy after bariatric surgery is associated with perinatal risks. A healthy lifestyle together with intensive followup is recommended, but has not been evaluated in prospective studies. We therefore investigated the effect of close monitoring of lifestyle and vitamin levels on pregnancy outcomes in women with bariatric surgery. METHODS: A multicenter prospective controlled study was conducted. Pregnant women with a history of bariatric surgery presenting with a singleton pregnancy were included. A 7-day dietary record and a Kaiser questionnaire on PA were collected during the 1st and 2nd pregnancy trimester. After evaluation, written lifestyle advice was offered. Vitamin levels were monitored in each pregnany trimester and substituted if necessary. Women not wanting to participate as well as contemporary controls identified from the electronic database served as controls. RESULTS: Comparison between the study (N=49) and control (N=23) group showed a baseline difference for age. Women in the study group were slightly older (29.9\u00b14.7 vs 27.2 \u00b1 4.5, p=0.023). We found significantly less preterm deliveries (10.2% vs 39.1%, p=0.04) and admissions to the maternal intensive care unit (6.5% vs 43.5%, p<0.001) in the study group compared to the control group. Depleted levels of most water and fat-soluble vitamins were found in the study group. Especially levels of vitamin K-1 (T1: 88%, T2: 59%, T3: 50%), A (T1: 19%, T2: 40%, T3: 58%) and B-12 (T1: 35%, T2: 45%, T3:41%) were low. Almost 90% took supplements in the 1 st and 2 nd trimester and 81.6% in the 3 rd trimester. Vitamin levels were not screened routinely in the control group. However, most of the women took a vitamin supplement during pregnancy, indicating low vitamin levels. Babies in the study group had significantly higher birth weights (3214.1\u00b1553.9 kg vs 2778.7\u00b1604.6 kg, p=0.004) and low birth weight <2500g was less frequent (4.1% vs 26.1%, p=0.006).",

Primary outcome was a composite of pyelonephritis and/or preterm birth (PTB) <34 weeks of gestation. The anticipated sample size was 220 women, but after 85 randomizations an independent data and safety monitoring committee advised to halt enrollment for futility. Outcomes of randomized and non-randomized patients were collected. Screen positive women who declined randomization did not routinely receive antibiotics; their outcomes were grouped with those of women receiving placebo. RESULTS: Between October 2011 and August 2013, 5,500 women were screened. ASB was present in 5%; 14% of the dipslides were contaminated and not used in this analysis. We randomly allocated 41 women to nitrofurantoin and 44 to placebo, 160 screen positive women declined randomization. So far, outcomes in 70% of the women have been collected.

Short cervical length detected on ultrasound in the second trimester of pregnancy is predictive of spontaneous preterm birth in singletons and an optimal cut-off of 25 mm is widely used to accurately predict this outcome.

All the operators were certified by the Fetal Medicine Foundation. Cervical length measured between 18 and 24 weeks of gestation was related to the occurrence of spontaneous preterm birth before 34 weeks of gestation and relative risk (RR) was calculated for different cut-offs of cervical length in twins. Finally, logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between pregnancy characteristics and preterm birth. We also studied whether this association differ according to the chorionicity. ROC curve analysis was used to assess the ability to predict preterm birth in this cohort. RESULTS: 915 twin pregnancies with cervical length measured between 18 and 24 weeks of gestation were analysed. Cervical length had an AUC of 0.69 (95% C.I. 0.56-0.71) for the prediction of preterm in twin pregnancies with an optimal cut off of 32 mm (sensitivity: 60%, specificity: 68%, PPV: 31.1, NPV: 86.3). Twins with cervical length <32 mm has a significantly increased risk (RR: 2.73, 95% C.I. 1.92-3.90, p<0.001) of preterm delivery compared to those with cervical length >32 mm. The risk of preterm delivery increased progressively with shorter cervical lengths (20 mm, RR: 3.80; 15 mm, RR: 5.1; 10 mm: RR: 5.9). At logistic regression analysis, cervical length (OR: 0.35, 95% C.I. 0.2-0.5) and monochorionicity (OR: 2.53, 95% C.I. 1.7-3.7) were independently associated with preterm birth in multiple gestations. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical length is independently associated with preterm birth in twin pregnancies. The data from this study suggests that a higher cut-off compared to singletons should be adopted in order to more accurately predict this outcome. , and childhood (29 days to 5 years) mortality following maternal bereavement in the preconception (6-0 months before conception) and prenatal (between conception and birth) periods.

Regression of retained placenta was monitored using serial ultrasonography (GE Voluson 730 Pro) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI utilizing a 1.5T MRI unit (Avanto, Siemens, Erlagen, Germany). The blood flow in the placenta was evaluated by transvaginal color Doppler ultrasonography (pulse repetition frequencies, 1.8 kHz), and was also quantified by dynamic MRI-based placental vascular volume. Enhanced areas in the retained placenta on the arterial phase images (at 40 seconds after intravenous injection of 0.2 mmol/kg gadodiamide) were measured by manually setting regions of interest using a Centricity PACS 3.2 RA 1000 workstation (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Subsequently, total enhanced volumes were computed by multiplying enhanced areas by the slice thickness, and were regarded as the placental vascular volume. The monitoring of serum hCG levels was conducted every 1-2 weeks in all patients.",

The timing of this phenomenon did not differ much between the five cases despite differences in the initial placental volume left behind or approach used to control hemorrhage. Serum hCG levels were significantly correlated with dynamic MRI-based placental vascular volume (R=0.97, p<0.0001). Placental tissue remained for 14 to 70 days following the disappearance of placental blood flow, and was eventually resorbed spontaneously without surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: A declining level of hCG was a reliable marker of regression of placental vascular volume, rather than placental resorption. In the follow-up period of conservative management for placenta accreta,undetectable hCG levels may be a reliable negative marker of delayed postpartum hemorrhage. We didn't observe statistically significant differences in other measured chemokines. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our findings, it seems that the chemokines MIP-3a, TARC, I-TAC, HCC-4 may play role in the pathogenesis of preterm labor. Defining their potential as biochemical marker of preterm birth requires further investigation on larger group of patients.",

METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted. Healthy women > 35 weeks undergoing primary CD prior to labor were randomized to closure of the rectus muscles with three interrupted sutures, or non-closure. Intra-operative (spinal anesthesia with intrathecal bupivacaine, fentanyl and morphine) and post-operative pain management (multimodal analgesia with acetaminophen, NSAIDs and opioids) was standardized. The primary outcome was the combined opioid use and movement pain score using the Silverman Integrated Assessment (SIA) score (reference). Total opioid use was determined using standardized relative-potency conversion scales. Pain (0-10) was assessed at rest and after movement at 24, 48, 72 hours and 6 weeks postoperatively.

Questionnaire results from practicing obstetricians with \u226510 years experience (group 1) were compared to obstetricians with <10 years experience (group 2) and in training residents (group 3). Knowledge based questions were graded and percent correct compared using one way ANOVA. Five questions considered critical (Sensitivity of NIPS, appropriate for patients with major anomalies, equivalent to amniocentesis, exclude all aneuploidies, and recommendations for patients with positive NIPS) were graded separately and also analyzed using one way ANOVA. RESULTS: Ninety eight completed questionnaires were received, 51 from group 1, 16 from group 2 and 31 from group 3. The mean percent correct was 81, 85 and 79 percent (p=0.36) for the entire questionnaire and 84, 84 and 77 percent (p=0.25) for the critical questions for groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The critical questions were answered incorrectly by the entire cohort as follows: Sensitivity of NIPS:45%, appropriate for patients with major anomalies:25%, equivalent to amniocentesis:15%, exclude all aneuploidies:2% and recommendations for patients with positive NIPS:6%. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that overall our obstetricians are knowledgeable regarding NIPS and knowledge is equivalent across all experience levels. However a significant amount of our cohort did not know the sensitivity of NIPS or appropriateness for patients with major anomalies. As the use of NIPS increases and the technology advances, it is imperative that obstetricians from all experience levels stay abreast of the indications, benefits and limitations of the test to provide accurate counseling and improve patient care.

CONCLUSIONS: Women with unknown overt T2DM demonstrate significantly increased risks for adverse pregnancy outcomes. A possible explanation for the poorer outcome could be the period of uncontrolled hyperglycemia, but also the higher BMI, which could be partly explained by the higher rate of parity and also the gradual accumulation of weight after previous pregnancies.

Analysis of the pathogens and sensitivities to antibiotics by trimester were evaluated. RESULTS: during 2011-2012, 287 pregnant women with clinical urinary tract infection had positive urine cultures. Almost 50% of Bacteriuria cases were diagnosed in the third trimester. 25% of cases were diagnosed in each of the first and second trimesters. The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli (48.4% of cases) followed by Klebsiella (13.9%), Enterococcus (11.6%), and Group B streptococcus (7.5 %). Cefuroxime Sodium, ofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against the pathogens in our study. Ninety percent (90%) of Escherichia coli and 81% of Klebsiella were sensitive to Cefuroxime Sodium. Ofloxacin and gentamicin were as effective. Nitrofurantoin was effective against 86% of E.colii, but had only 18% sensitivity against Klebsiella. CONCLUSIONS: 50% of symptomatic bacteuria cases occur in the third trimester. E.coli is the most common pathogen in symptomatic bacteuria in pregnancy. Cefuroxime Sodium, ofloxacin and gentamicin are the most affective antibiotics against the most common pathogens with comparable sensitivity profiles.

Neonatal HI leads to high disability and mortality rates in neonates because the neonatal immature brain is especially sensitive to hypoxia, which leads to neuronal death. Recently, bone marrow cells have been proposed to treat the brain injury; however, the effect has not been sufficient. Stromal derived factor-1a(SDF-1a)is known to control the migration of cells derived from bone marrow into the ischemic lesion for regeneration. In this study, we evaluated the effect of SDF-1a on brain damage in neonatal rats.",

There are significant differences in Clinical Practice Guidelines between countries with practice in the United States largely following CDC (Atlanta) recommendations for universal bacteriological screening at around 37 weeks gestation. In Australia either routine bacteriological screening or a risk factor-based approach is recommended and accepted, whereas in the UK no routine screening at all is recommended. We reviewed the outcomes over a 10 year period in our hospital where a risk factor-based program is in place to assess whether a risk factor-based approach is effective. In the 2011 period, the rate was 30% (161/531). CONCLUSIONS: A risk factor-based approach to the prevention of EOGBSD is highly effective when clinician compliance is high and as effective as routine bacteriological screening. The reported benefits of routine bacteriological screening over risk factor-base screening may relate to better clinician compliance with the former approach rather than any inherent advantage. Recommendations regarding \"best\" practice may merit review. (3): F-090). However, the underlying mechanism is unknown preventing targets for intervention. Here, we tested the hypothesis that hypoxia-induced oxidative stress is involved and compared two maternal antioxidant therapies. METHODS: Pregnant Wistar rats were divided into normoxic (N: 21% O 2 ) or hypoxic (H: 14% O 2 ) pregnancy +/-antioxidant treatment with either vitamin C (0.9 mg/g/day in maternal water) or allopurinol (30 mg/ kg/day in jelly) from days 6-20 of gestation. This experimental model of maternal hypoxia does not affect maternal food intake. After birth, offspring were maintained until adulthood. At 4 months, the aorta from 1 male per litter was investigated. At the Department of Engineering, uniaxial tensile tests were performed using a materials testing machine (Instron, Canton, MA) to determine aortic stiffness. Materials testing software (Bluehill 2, Instron) programmed the stretching rates, extensions and sequences. Strain is the extension of the aorta as a fraction of the initial sample length. Stress is the load on the aorta as a fraction of its cross sectional area. Stiffness is represented by the gradient of the stressstrain curve. RESULTS: Fetal chronic hypoxia reproducibly programmes an increase in aortic stiffness at adulthood. Maternal treatment with allopurinol but not with vitamin C is an effective intervention (Fig. 1) . CONCLUSIONS: Xanthine oxidase-induced oxidative stress is an involved mechanism programming aortic stiffness in adulthood following pregnancy complicated by chronic fetal hypoxia. Maternal treatment with allopurinol may protect against the programming of cardiovascular disease in high risk pregnancy.",

For each newborn we recorded maternal age and gestational age at delivery, nationality, parity, mode of delivery, presence or absence of labor, indications for CS, birth weight, and newborn gender. Analysis of data was performed using t-test and chi-square when needed; a p < 0.001 was considered significant. We also calculated the Odds Ratio. RESULTS: No differences were recorded between the two groups regarding to parity, nationality and maternal age; there were difference in neonatal birth, gender and weight (p < 0.001). Total incidence of respiratory complications was 3%; this percentage rose up to 5.2% in case of CS and to 5.9% in case of CS without labor; conversely, incidence was 1.8% in the group of delivery in presence of labor (urgent CS or vaginal delivery). Considering only CS without labor, the stratification has showed that risk decreases as the weeks increase (OR = 36.5, 26.9, 10.3 and 4,1 at 34, 35, 36 and 37 weeks respectively); the risk is still present at 37 and 38 weeks of gestation; conversely, at 39 weeks it is the same than after 40 weeks (OR = 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of respiratory complications in newborns delivered by CS was significantly influenced by presence or absence of labor. Elective CS is not a safer way to deliver for the baby. Although in daily practice it was performed in almost half of the cases at 38 weeks, a reduction in neonatal respiratory morbidity was observed when it was postponed at 39 weeks of gestation.

OP group had higher concentration (p <0.0001) of C3 and C5-carnitines during pregnancy. Concentration of C10AC and C8AC were significant increased (p = 0.001, p <0.0001 respectively) compared the first to third trimester in OP group. CONCLUSIONS: The obese women analyzed in this study had normal pregnancy and normal perinatal evolution, despite severe disturbances in lipid metabolism. These adaptations reveal a broad metabolic plasticity dealing with the lipid overload and resulting in non-complicated pregnancies. During normal pregnancy, metabolic changes occur leading to weight gain and insulin resistance, these changes cover progressive demands of the fetus. Obesity has been considered a metabolic disruptor that harms evolution of pregnancy, however few information is available to understand the mechanisms of damage of obesity in pregnancy. We decided to study amino acid profiles of obese women in order to obtain preliminary information comparing normal weight women along pregnancy.OBJECTIVE: To quantify amino acid concentrations in serum during pregnancy in normal or obese women. METHODS: Women included in the Mexico City's Perinatal Cohort were selected according to pregestational BMI and two groups were analyzed: 1. Twenty women with normal BMI (\u2264 24.9) (NWP) and 2. Twenty obese women (BMI \u00b330)(OP). Concentration of aminoacids was determined by gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in monthly samples of serum obtained from week 14 of gestation. All women had no complications during pregnancy or perinatal periods. RESULTS: Alanine concentrations were significantly (p=0.0006) higher in the second trimester and there was a significant increase (p=0.05) in the gluconeogenic and ketogenic amino acid concentrations in OP. Glucose concentration was significantly higher (p=0.005) and there was an inverse correlation between leucine and valine with glucose concentrations (r=-0.25 and -0.37 respectively) in the OP group. A progressive decrease in the seric urea concentrations in the OP group was found. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of serum glucose in the OP group may be associated to increased channeling of aminoacids to gluconeogenesis derived from the reduction of oxidative degradation of these compounds. However, these striking changes related to the presence of increased adiposity coexisted wit a normal pregnancy. A better knowledge of the limits of this metabolic plasticity may aid to identify specific changes associated to abnormal evolution of pregnancy. to adverse long and short-term outcome.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that FLX treatment has an effect on pregnancy outcome, probably associated with a fetal distress, evidenced by the IUGR-like phenotype observed. These observations suggest physical complication for the fetuses of mother under treatment with FLX, the major antidepressant used in pregnant women. Further studies will be performed in order to evaluate the local effect of FLX in the placental tissue and the mechanisms associated to FLX effects in this model. Notably angiotensinogen (AGT), a precursor of the vasoactive peptide angiotensin II (AngII) is increased in obese individuals. Furthermore, AngII is known to activate NF-kB inflammatory pathway resulting in increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and macrophage infiltration. We hypothesized that maternal BPA induces offspring adipose tissue inflammation via upregulation of AGT and increased macrophage infiltration. We determined the protein expression of AGT, marker of macrophage and inflammatory cytokine. METHODS: From gestational day 10 to term and throughout lactation, dams were administered oral BPA (500\u00b5g/kg body weight/day) or corn oil (Control). After birth litter size was standardized and pups nursed by the same dam. At 3 weeks of age, offspring were weaned with no further BPA treatment. At 1 day and 6 weeks of age, adipose tissue was collected from male offspring and protein expression (Western Blot) was analyzed for RAS precursor (AGT), and markers of inflammation (TNFa), macrophage (CD68) and inflammatory pathway (pNF-kB). RESULTS: At 1 day, BPA newborns were heavier than Controls (7.3 vs. 6,7g) and continued to show increased body weight at 3 weeks of age (56 vs. 49g). Further, BPA offspring exhibited significantly increased protein expression of adipose AGT (1.4-fold), TNFa (1.5-fold), CD68 (1.3-fold) and pNF-kB (1.7-fold) as compared to Control males. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal BPA promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the offspring via upregulation of the adipose AGT. The underlying mechanism of offspring adipose tissue inflammation may be directly through activation of NF-\u03baB inflammatory signaling pathway and/or increased macrophage migration. Furthermore, whether adipose tissue inflammation in BPA offspring is primarily a programmed effect or secondary to increased adiposity remains to be established. . We hypothesized that hearts of IUGR fetuses would show increased nitrotyrosine, a marker of reactive oxygen stress and a reduction in antioxidant capacity.

GR protein increased in male and female medulla but was unchanged in the cortex. pGR protein increased in both sexes at both locations.

CONCLUSIONS: pGR is increased in both sexes in medulla and cortex while H6PD changes differed in region and sex increasing in females in the medulla and decreasing in the cortex.

METHODS: Six pregnant baboons were fed ad lib (Control, CTR), while an additional six pregnant animals received 70% of the control diet, which produced IUGR in both male and female fetuses (Li et al, J Endocrinol 2013, 217: 275) . Fetuses were removed at C-section at 0.9 gestation, and fetal cardiac RNA isolated for miRNA profiling. RESULTS: miRNA expression differed between male and female fetuses within both CTR and IUGR groups. In CTR, 10 cardiac miRNAs homologous to human miRNAs (let-7a, mir-1, mir-30c, mir-145, mir-181b, mir-323b, mir-324, mir-455, mir-574, and mir-664) were more than 2-fold higher in males vs. females (p<0.05). Most of these miRNAs are targeted by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a (HNF4a). HNF4a protein levels (Western Blot) were 4-fold higher in male CTR vs. female (p < 0.01). Fetal sex-dependent differences in cardiac miRNA expression were observed in IUGR fetuses vs. CTR (p<0.05). In IUGR males, 7 of 15 differentially expressed miRNAs (mir-19a, mir-23b, mir-27b, mir-99b, mir-143, mir-181a, and mir-378-3p) have been linked to CVD. Of 19 miRNAs that were up-or downregulated (p<0.05) in female IUGR, 11 were previously linked to CVD: let-7a, miR-1, mir-30c, mir-127, mir-143, mir-145, mir-181b, mir-378-3p, mir-378, mir-454, and mir-455 . Only two differentially expressed miRNAs, mir-143 and mir-378-3p, were shared by male and female IUGR fetuses. HNF4a was similar in male and female IUGR.",

INTRODUCTION: Altered maternal perinatal food intake increases the risk of obesity and metabolic disorders in offspring due to developmental programming, however the mechanism is not clearly understood. We investigated the effect of maternal high fat diet (HFD) on sensory taste functions of adult offspring in rats. METHODS: Four groups of offspring were generated based on maternal perinatal exposure to HFD: 1) HFD: HFD during pregnancy and lactation; 2) HFD-pregnancy: HFD only during pregnancy; 3) HFD-lactation: HFD only during lactation; and 4) ND: normal diet (ND) during pregnancy and lactation. Following weaning groups were maintained exclusively on ND.",

Offspring exposed to HFD during pregnancy showed increased lick responses for sucrose at 0.3, 0.6, 1.2M concentrations in HFD and at 0.6M in HFD-pregnancy groups, compared to ND group. Similar effect was noted for intralipid solutions in HFD (0.05, 0.10%) and HFD-pregnancy (0.05, 0.10, 0.5%) groups. HFDlactation group showed diminished lick responses for sucrose (0.9, 1.2, 1.5M), but not for intralipid, compared to ND animals. Extended access test did not reveal any differences. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that maternal exposure to HFD during pregnancy or lactation differentially alters sensory taste preferences in adult offspring, which may contribute to overeating and obesity. The idea that ancestral environment can affect the phenotype of future generations has been appreciated since Lamarck and Darwin. However, the mechanisms by which parents transfer adaptive information about the environment they experienced to offspring remain under discussion. We report in a rat model of intergenerational programming that adult males, which experienced chronic hypoxia in utero, transmit a cardiac deficit on to offspring. In contrast, adult females which experienced hypoxia in utero transmit on to offspring protection against this deficit. We show that the mechanism by which mothers can pass on this cardioprotective trait on to their offspring is via their mitochondria. METHODS: Pregnant rats (n=24, F0) underwent normoxic (N) or hypoxic (H: 14% O 2 ) pregnancy from days 6-20 of gestation. At 12 weeks, F1 offspring were mated with partners from outside the colony to produce an F2 generation which did not experience hypoxia from both parental lineages. In F1 and F2, cardiac recovery from ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R, Langendorff) and cardiac mitochondrial O 2 consumption (permeabilised cardiac muscle fibre respirometry) were determined at 4 months of age in male offspring. RESULTS: F1 and F2 paternal lineage offspring of hypoxic pregnancy showed impaired cardiac recovery from I/R (Fig. 1) . In contrast, F2 maternal lineage offspring of hypoxic pregnancy showed normal recovery to I/R. Cardiac protection to I/R in F2 maternal lineage offspring was associated with a decrease in mitochondrial complex I O 2 consumption. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in complex I O 2 consumption is an established antioxidant strategy to limit free radical generation in hypoxic tissue (Levett et al. FASEB J. 26:1431 , 2012 . This adaptive response in F1 was transmitted to F2 offspring via the maternal and not paternal line. We show the heritability of an advantageous Lamarckian trait transmitted from mother to offspring via the maternal mitochondria. This may be a mechanism driving the evolution of environmental adaptation from generation to generation. Supported by the British Heart Foundation.",

RESULTS: Positive correlation was found between maternal and cord blood, both for Oxt and CD38. Maternal VitA and Oxt levels were approximately 4-and 8-fold higher, respectively, than neonate levels, while newborn cord blood levels of CD38 were found to be 9-fold higher than maternal values .

Pregnant rats were euthanized on embryonic day 20. Abcb1a, Abcb1b, Abcg2 and Vegfa mRNA expression were assessed in placenta and fetal liver using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Hypoxia increased Vegfa mRNA expression in the placenta and fetal liver, confirming activation of hypoxic pathways. Hypoxia alone had no significant effect on placental Abcb1a, Abcb1b (the predominant placental isoform encoding P-gp) or Abcg2 expression. However, in fetal liver, hypoxia alone decreased Abcb1a (predominant liver isoform), an effect prevented by VC (P<0.05). In normoxic pregnancy, VC caused a significant increase in placental Abcb1a mRNA. In hypoxic pregnancy, VC decreased (P<0.05) Abcg2 mRNA in the placenta and Abcb1 and Abcg2 mRNA in the fetal liver. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxic pregnancy has little effect on drug transporter expression in the placenta, but causes a profound effect on Abcb1a (the predominant liver isoform encoding P-gp) in the fetal liver, in vivo. The latter effect is ameliorated by VC. Hypoxia-induced reduction in fetal hepatic Abcb1a expression will likely lead to an impaired ability of the fetal liver to excrete xenobiotics, drugs and certain hormones. Conversion of w-3 and w-6 EFA are performed by the enzymes D5desaturase, D6-desaturase, elongase 2 and elongase 5. Maternally derived EFAs undergo conversion in the fetal liver before transport to tissues for local conversion. The effect of IUGR on EFA conversion and converting enzyme mRNA in rat serum and lung is unknown. We hypothesize that IUGR alters EFA conversion in the serum and lung of fetal rats at term gestation. We further hypothesize that changes EFA conversion in the serum and lung will occur in conjunction with changes in mRNA levels of converting enzymes in the liver and lung. METHODS: IUGR was induced by bilateral uterine artery ligation in rats at e19. Rat pups were delivered by C-section at term gestation (e21). Serum and lung was collected and EFA levels measured using gas chromatography. mRNA levels of FADS1 (D5-desaturase), FADS2 (D6-desaturase), ELOVL2 (elongase 2) and ELOVL5 (elongase5) were measured using real-time RT PCR. RESULTS: Results are IUGR as % sex-matched control \u00b1 SD, *p<0.05. In male serum, IUGR decreases conversion of ALA to EPA (21\u00b111%*) and increases conversion of EPA to DHA (260\u00b174%*). In male lung, IUGR decreases conversion of LA to AA (76\u00b115%*). In female serum, IUGR increases in conversion of LA to AA (115\u00b19%*). In male liver, IUGR decreases mRNA levels of FADS1 (65\u00b131%*), ELOVL2 (73\u00b135%*), and ELOVL5 (65\u00b110%*). In male lung, IUGR increases mRNA levels of FADS2 (142\u00b126%*). IUGR did not affect mRNA levels of conversion enzymes in female liver or lung. CONCLUSIONS: IUGR alters serum and lung EFA as well as mRNA of EFA conversion enzymes in a sex-dependent manner. Changes in expression of EFA conversion enzymes in rat serum and lung may contribute to altered EFA levels. Given that EFA act as ligands for several transcriptional regulators, we speculate that dysregulated EFA will affect gene expression profiles in the liver and lung. Altered gene expression profiles during fetal development may contribute to the programming of postnatal disease, including chronic lung disease.",

Patients: We studied 58 women in labor at term with suspected fetal hypoxia, prompting immediate delivery, in the intervention arm of the RCT. Setting: 11 Dutch hospitals. Intervention: 500 mg allopurinol, intravenously to the mother, immediately prior to delivery. Main outcome measures: Drug disposition (maternal plasma concentrations, cord blood concentrations) and drug safety (maternal and fetal adverse events). RESULTS: Within 5 minutes after the end of maternal allopurinol infusion target plasma concentrations of allopurinol were present in cord blood. Of all analysed cord blood samples, 95% (52/55) had a target allopurinol plasma concentration of \u22652 mg/L at the moment of delivery. No adverse events were observed in the neonates. Two mothers had a red and/or painful arm during infusion. CONCLUSIONS: A dose of 500 mg intravenous allopurinol rapidly crosses the placenta, provides target concentrations in 95% of the fetuses at the moment of delivery, and has little side effects, which makes it potentially useful as an antenatal neuroprotective agent in perinatology.

Maternal exposure to different factors such as ischemia, nicotine, inflammation and diabetes lead to persistent hypoxic conditions and result with critical injury to vital organs. Neonatal hypoxia remains a major cause of intrauterine growth restriction in neonates. Offspring exposed to prenatal hypoxia due to nicotine has been evidenced to experience behavioral abnormalities. Similarly, hypoxia due to exposure to nicotine during pregnancy is associated with cognitive deficits and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder.

P-gp is present in fetal BECs and is important in protecting the developing brain. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid signaling molecule, has been shown to modify P-gp function in the adult rat blood-brain barrier (BBB) though the effects have been inconsistent. S1P is formed by sphingosine kinases (SKs), and acts through 5 membrane receptors (S1P 1-5 ). FTY720 acts as an agonist of S1P receptors at low concentrations, while at high concentrations inhibits production of endogenous S1P (K i = 2mM). We hypothesized that S1P receptors are expressed in the developing BBB and that FTY720 would have a dosedependent effect on P-gp function. METHODS: BECs were isolated from male postnatal day 14 guinea pigs and cultured. At confluence, BECs were treated with FTY720 (0.1, 1, or 5mM) or vehicle for 15, 30, 60 or 120 minutes. P-gp function was assessed using the calcein-AM fluorescence accumulation assay. S1P 1-4 receptors were measured in cultured BECs by RT-PCR. RESULTS: S1P 1-4 receptors were expressed in BECs. Treatment of BECs with high dose FTY720 (5mM) for 15, 30, and 60 minutes resulted in a reduction in P-gp function (increased P-gp substrate accumulation; P<0.05). There were no effects at 120 minutes. Low dose FTY720 (0.1mM) at 30 minutes caused a strong tendency (P<0.055) towards an increase in P-gp function. CONCLUSIONS: FTY720 treatment rapidly affected P-gp function in BECs derived from the developing brain, in a highly dose-dependent manner. At low concentrations, known to activate S1P receptors, FTY720 tended to increase P-gp function. However, at high concentrations, known to inhibit S1P production, FTY720 decreased P-gp activity. These data are consistent with S1P having an important role in the regulation of P-gp in the developing BBB. S1P levels are altered in many pathologies, including hypoxia, ischemia, inflammation, and infection. Modification of S1P levels resulting in changes in P-gp activity will likely profoundly alter exposure of the developing brain to xenobioitics, drugs and other factors. ",

Fetal sheep islets expressed high levels of mature endocrine hormones and regulatory factors and 915 transcripts were differentially expressed (137 were novel). Pathways over-represented were proliferation and cellular stress response.

RESULTS: Dexamethasone (0.1mM) and corticosterone (10mM) timedependently increased miR-29c expression 2.5 and 1.8 fold at 48hrs respectively (P<0.05), and reduced VEGF, Col3A1, Col4A5, MMP2 and ELN protein in RAOSMC.

Moreover, we evaluated the contribution of BK Ca channels to vasoconstriction of UA at different stages of pregnancy using a pressurized myograph. RESULTS: Iberiotoxin, a selective blocker of BK Ca channels, induced a greater reduction of UA diameter in pregnant compared to non-pregnant mice, confirming an increased activity of BK Ca in UA during pregnancy. We found that the LRRC26 mRNA is expressed in mouse UA. In freshly dissociated UA VSMCs from pregnant mice we observed a leftward shift of the BK Ca voltage-activation curve compared to cells isolated form nonpregnant UA. In HEK293T cells co-transfected with BK Ca and LRRC26, we observed enhanced BK Ca channel activation, with a leftward shift of the voltage-activation curve, similar to that observed in pregnant mouse UA.

INTRODUCTION: Exposure to intrauterine hypoxia occurs due to a variety of maternal, fetal and/or placental factors. Following birth, the implications on infant respiratory outcome depend on the duration and/ or severity of the hypoxic insult. In this study, we focus on the effect of maternal chronic hypoxia for a month during late gestation in sheep on the expression of genes regulating fetal lung liquid reabsorption and the maturation of the surfactant system. These are vital processes that aid the successful transition of the fetus to air-breathing at birth. METHODS: Chronically catheterised pregnant sheep carrying male singletons were exposed to normoxia (n=8) or hypoxia (n=7; 10% O 2 ) from 105-138d (term, ~145d). At 138d, fetuses were delivered, measured and their tissues collected. qRT-PCR was used to quantify lung mRNA expression of genes regulating sodium and water reabsorption, as well as the surfactant proteins (SP). These included amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel ( Progesterone has been linked to improved outcomes following traumatic brain injury in adults. Evidence shows that progesterone decreases edema, improves neuronal survival and modulates apoptosis. We sought to determine if women who received progesterone to prevent preterm birth had lower rates of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and/or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) in their premature neonates. METHODS: Using a contemporaneously maintained database in a large community-based hospital, we identified all inborn singleton neonates with birthweight less than 1500gm whose preterm birth was the result of spontaneous preterm labor from 2003-2012. The primary exposure was a maternal history of progesterone use, intramuscular or vaginal, to prevent preterm birth. Our primary outcome was severe IVH defined as grade III and/or IV IVH or cystic PVL on routine head ultrasound. To control for covariates known to influence the rate of severe IVH and PVL multivariable analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 492 neonates were identified (Progesterone N=57; No progesterone N= 435). Increasing gestational age, absence of clinical chorioamnionitis, antenatal corticosteroids and higher Apgar score were all inversely associated with severe IVH and/or PVL ( P-value<0.01).",

CONCLUSIONS: Maternal progesterone usage is not associated with decreased rates of severe IVH and/or PVL.

Excess neonatal body fat (%BF) is a risk factor for childhood obesity. Identification of excess fetal fat accretion midpregnancy may allow for interventions to optimize the fetal metabolic environment and improve long-term outcome. Previously, ultrasound (U/S) estimates of fetal thigh soft tissue at 28w were found to correlate with neonatal %BF. The objective of this analysis was to determine whether the association between early estimates of fetal adiposity and neonatal %BF differs by gender. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective longitudinal fetal growth study (William Beaumont Hospital, MI, 2005 -2010 , including uncomplicated pregnancies (n=97) in which U/S measurements were obtained at 28 and 32w (2D fetal biometry and two fetal soft tissue measurements [fractional thigh volume (TVol) and mid-thigh circumference (TCirc)]). %BF was assessed within 2d of birth using air displacement plethysmography (PEA POD). Associations between U/S variables and %BF were determined using Pearson's correlation. Multiple regression modeling was performed to determine the best U/S variables for prediction of %BF. RESULTS: Mean birth weight was 3316.9\u00b1413.2g (1SD), gestational age 39w1d\u00b11d, and %BF 9.6\u00b13.8. The best predictor of neonatal %BF at 28 and 32w was TCirc (28w: r=0.25, p=0.01; 32w: r=0.37, p=0.0003). At 28w, this correlation was stronger in males (r=0.53, p=0.0003) than females (r=0.28, p=0.04), however the discrepancy resolved by 32w (male: r=0.41, p=0.006; female r=0.40, p=0.003). Multiple regression modeling did not significantly improve prediction of %BF. Abdominal circumference and estimated fetal weight were poorly predictive of %BF. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of fetal mid-thigh adiposity (TCirc) early in the third trimester correlate with neonatal adiposity. Targeted intervention strategies aimed at moderating fetal fat accretion based onfetal soft tissue estimates should consider potential gender-based differences in fetal fat accretion patterns at 28-32w.",

INTRODUCTION: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and chronic hypoxemia cause a decrease in cardiomyocyte endowment in late gestation with no change in hypoxia inducible factors (HIF1a, 1b and 2a) or genes with hypoxia response elements. We hypothesised that the decreased cardiomyocyte endowment in late gestation is due to either a decrease in proliferation or an increase in cardiomyocyte death in early gestation in the IUGR fetus. METHODS: IUGR was induced by removing endometrial caruncles in nonpregnant ewes. At 55d gestation, hearts from Control and IUGR fetuses were weighed and ventricular samples were frozen and fixed. Gene expression was determined relative to the geometric mean of 3 housekeepers using real-time PCR. The percent of proliferating cardiomyocytes was determined with Ki67 staining.

There was, however, a decrease in the protein expression of Bcl-xl, an anti-apoptotic protein, and an increase in the protein expression of LC3B, a marker of autophagy, in IUGR fetuses. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the heart of the IUGR fetus may not be hypoxic and that there is no change in cardiomyocyte proliferation in early gestation, but that there may be an increase in apoptosis or autophagy of cardiomyocytes Here we sought to conduct human pilot studies to determine adenosine levels in the circulation of SCD non-pregnant and pregnant women.",

Analyses were performed on data collected from 2,135 primigravid mothers without essential hypertension who visited the research center approximately 6 years (90% range: 5.7-7.1) after the index pregnancy. We studied the associations of PIH, preeclampsia, birth weight for gestational age and spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) with the maternal cardiovascular outcomes. The cardiovascular outcomes included, blood pressure, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and results from maternal echocardiography. Information on pregnancy complications was retrieved from medical records. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders mothers who had experienced PIH showed a higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure (8.42 mmHg; P<0.01 and 7.30 mmHg; P<0.01, respectively), a higher pulse wave velocity (0.29 m/s; P<0.05) and a larger aortic root diameter (0.66 mm; P<0.05). We observed a higher diastolic blood pressure in mothers with previous preeclampsia (3.92 mmHg; P<0.01) compared to mothers without hypertensive pregnancy complications. Small for gestational age was associated with a smaller maternal aortic root diameter (-0.48 mm; P<0.05), whilst large for gestational age was associated with a larger maternal aortic root diameter (0.52 mm; P<0.05). Mothers with a sPTB showed a lower systolic blood pressure (-4.08 mmHg; P<0.05) 6 years after their pregnancy.

The age at which women deliver their first child has increased steadily in recent years, particularly in Western societies. Advanced maternal age (\u226535 years) is associated with increased maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Little is known about the impact of aging on vascular adaptations to pregnancy that might compromise pregnancy outcome. We hypothesize that maternal cardiovascular adaptations to pregnancy will be impaired in rat dams of advanced maternal age. METHODS: Female Sprague Dawley rats aged 9 months (approximately equivalent to a 35 year old woman), and 4 months (young controls) were mated, and systolic blood pressure was measured using tail cuff plethysmography in mid-and late-gestation (gestational day (GD)14 and 19). On GD20, fetal biometrics were measured and uterine artery function was assessed ex vivo using wire myography. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure was increased on GD19 in aged rats compared to young rats (young=108.8\u00b15.1 mmHg vs. aged=131.4\u00b15.8 mmHg, P<0.05). Aged dams had a reduced capacity to carry viable pregnancies (young=90% vs. aged=50%), and had reduced litter sizes (young=15.0\u00b10.57 pups vs. aged=8.5\u00b11.6 pups, P<0.01) on GD20. Fetuses from aged dams had a reduced body weight at GD20 (young=3.78\u00b10.1g vs. aged=3.19\u00b10.2g, P<0.05) as well as an increased crown-rump length:abdominal girth ratio -indicative of asymmetric fetal growth restriction (young=0.97\u00b10.0 vs. aged=1.04\u00b10.0). Moreover, fetal to placental weight ratios in aged dams were reduced (young=7.32\u00b10.3 vs. aged=5.65\u00b10.3, P<0.01), indicating a reduced placental efficiency. Uterine arteries showed a reduced maximal response to phenylephrine in aged dams (E MAX young=14.38\u00b10.9 mN/mm vs. aged=11.44\u00b10.5 mN/ mm, P<0.05), although there were no changes in endothelium-dependent relaxation. CONCLUSIONS: In a rat model of advanced maternal age, dams developed hypertension as well as altered uterine vascular contractility, and these changes were accompanied by adverse fetal outcomes.",

Dongbao Chen, 1 Thomas J Lechuga, 1 Ronald R Magness. 2 1 Ob/Gyn, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA; 2 Ob/Gyn, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. INTRODUCTION: Uterine blood flow increases during the follicular phase of estrous cycle and pregnancy in part via upregulation of vasodilator production locally in uterine artery (UA) in association with rises in circulating estrogens. The novel vasodilator hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is primarily synthesized from L-cysteine by cystathionine b-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine g-lyase (CSE). It is unknown whether UA H 2 S biosynthesis is regulated by endogenous estrogens. Hypothesis: UA H 2 S biosynthesis is upregulated during the follicular phase of estrous cycle and pregnancy. METHODS: Nonpregnant ewes were synchronized to the luteal (Lut) and follicular (Fol) phase of the ovarian cycle. On day 9 postestrus, ewes (n=5/group) were given 2 IM injections 4 hours apart of either saline (1 ml) or lutalyse (1 mg/ml saline PGF 2a ) 48 hours after the last injection, Fol and Lut phase ewes were obtained from the PGF 2a and saline treated groups. Five late pregnant (LP, 120 to 130d) were studied. UAs were obtained at sacrifice, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently enriched UA endothelial (UAendo) or smooth muscle (UASM) proteins were extracted for determining CBS and CSE proteins by immunoblotting and H2S production by the Methylene Blue assay. Cellular specific CBS and CSE protein expression was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: CBS, but not CSE, protein was significantly (p<0.001) upregulated in UAendo and UASM in the Fol and LP <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">vs. Lut ewes. Levels of UAendo and UASM CBS protein were 2.6 and >9 -fold and 1.7 and >8 -fold greater in Fol and LP ewes than that of Lut ewes, respectively. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis confirmed these findings. Compared to nonpregnant ewes, H 2 S production was also upregulated in LP UA ptotein lysates, which was blocked by incubation with a specific CBS inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: UA H 2 S biosynthesis system is significantly upregulated in the follicular phase and late pregnant ewes, suggesting a role of physiologically elevated estrogens. ( In rats, the corpus luteal (CL) hormone, relaxin (RLN), mediates maternal circulatory changes in early pregnancy characterized by massive vasodilation. To assess whether RLN plays a similar role during human pregnancy, in a pilot study we investigated women conceiving with donor eggs (DE) who lack a CL, and hence, circulating RLN. METHODS: Women conceiving with DE or autologous eggs (AE) were studied before, 6 times during, and once after pregnancy. Cardiac function and structure were determined by echo, and arterial compliance (AC) and wave reflection by tonometry. Hemoglobin (Hb), plasma protein (PP) and hormones were assessed. Statistical graphs were drawn to contrast differences between DE and AE, and significance was set at 0.05 by testing fixed effects in the mixed models. RESULTS: 4 DE and 5 AE subjects completed the pilot study. DE subjects showed a markedly subdued decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR; p<0.002), increase in cardiac output (CO; p<0.005) and heart rate (HR; p<0.01 vs AE). Despite radically different SVR, mean arterial pressure (MAP) fell during pregnancy (p<0.002) comparably in the 2 cohorts (p>0.05). Hb (p<0.02) and PP (p=0.06) decreased, while left atrial (p<0.005) and ventricular end diastolic (p<0.02) dimensions increased to a similar extent in the 2 groups (p>0.05). In AE, global AC rose, and aortic augmentation index@HR75 and pressure declined; these responses were markedly attenuated in DE (p values from <0.06 to <0.03 vs AE). Serum RLN was high in AE and undetectable in DE throughout pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas AE showed the expected pattern of circulatory changes in pregnancy, there was a markedly blunted decrease of SVR and increase of CO in DE consistent with the lack of a circulating vasodilator such as RLN. Gestational increase in AC was attenuated in DE also consistent with impaired vasodilation. Despite impaired vasodilation, the fall in MAP was similar in DE and AE, which may explain the comparable expansion of plasma volume as reflected by the fall in Hb and PP, and rise in cardiac chamber sizes. Studies are ongoing to include age-matched spontaneous conceptions, as well as additional AE and DE pregnancies. We speculate that the maternal milieu, which is not physiological in DE, may contribute to the reports of increased preeclampsia and SGA in these pregnancies. In vivo, tumor cells employ them as a mechanism of immune escape and they can be measured in peripheral blood of patients with most forms of cancer. Their presence and activity have even been correlated with burden of disease and clinical stage. Our objective was to evaluate whether MDSC are induced and present during healthy pregnancies.",

INTRODUCTION: Vasogenic brain edema is present in ~90% of women with eclampsia, although it is difficult to determine if edema is present prior to seizure because seizure itself causes blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. This study investigated the effect of pregnancy on seizureinduced vasogenic brain edema in the posterior brain region, a primary location of edema in women with eclampsia. We hypothesized that the pregnant state is more sensitive to seizure-induced brain edema than the nonpregnant state. Further, the role of oxidative disruption of the BBB was investigated as a potential underlying mechanism of seizure-induced edema since pregnancy is a state of mild peripheral inflammation that may sensitize the brain to edema during seizure. METHODS: Seizure was induced by i.v. infusion of the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 10mg/mL, 1mL/min) in nonpregnant (NP; n=7) and late-pregnant (LP; n=6) Sprague Dawley rats. PTZ infusion was stopped at onset of electrical seizure as monitored via EEG. Thirty minutes post-seizure, rats were euthanized, the brains removed and the posterior cerebral cortex isolated. Percent water content was measured by wet:dry weights, a sensitive measure of brain edema. To determine if edema formation was due to seizure-induced oxidative disruption of the BBB, in a separate group of LP rats (n=6) the peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst FeTMPyP was infused i.v. 10 minutes prior to PTZ, and seizureinduced edema measured. RESULTS: LP rats had significantly greater water content in the posterior brain region after seizure compared to NP rats (78.55 \u00b1 0.11 vs. 78.04 \u00b1 0.19 %, p<0.05). Infusion of FeTMPyP did not impact seizure-induced edema formation during pregnancy, as the percent water content was unaffected by FeTMPyP treatment and similar to LP (78.48 \u00b1 0.13 %; p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the maternal brain is more susceptible to seizure-induced vasogenic edema than the nonpregnant state. The combination of mild inflammation present in pregnancy and oxidative stress due to seizure may lead to BBB breakdown, however, our results suggest edema does not appear to be due to peroxynitrite generation. These findings reiterate the importance of prevention and management of eclampsia and suggest that the maternal brain is at a greater risk of edema after seizure. Estrogens potently dilate blood vessels throughout the body with the greatest response in the uterus that is largely mediated by enhanced production of uterine artery (UA) nitric oxide (NO); however, additional mechanisms are involved since NO inhibition only blocks ~65% of the estrogen-induced response. Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) has been described as a novel vasodilator, which is primarily synthesized from L-cysteine by cystathionine b-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine g-lyase (CSE). Hypothesis: Estrogens stimulate UA H 2 S biosynthesis. METHODS: Ovariectomized nonpregnant ewes (n=5/group) were treated with vehicle (OVX/Veh) or estrogen replacement therapy (OVX/ERT, 1 \u00b5g estrodiol-17b/kg body weight, 5-6 days). Intact UA and denuded UA (UASM) samples were obtained and analyzed for: 1) CBS/CSE mRNA by qRT-PCR; 2) CBS/CSE protein by immunoblotting and their cellular specific (endothelium vs. smooth muscle) localization/expression by immunofluorescence microscopy; and 3) H 2 S production by the Methylene Blue assay. RESULTS: ERT significantly (P<0.01) stimulated CBS mRNA and protein without altering CSE mRNA and protein expressions in UA and UASM of OVX ewes. Levels of UA and UASM CBS mRNA were 5.03 (\u00b1 1.00 SD) and 5.60 (\u00b1 0.93)-fold greater, and levels of CBS UA and UASM protein were 3.51 (\u00b10.51) and 4.67 (\u00b10.09)-fold greater in OVX/ ERT than that of OVX/Veh ewes, respectively. Immunofluorescence microscopic analyses confirmed the CBS and CSE protein expression patterns. ERT also stimulated H 2 S production in UA protein lysates compared to controls, which was blocked by incubation with specific inhibitors of CBS and CSE. CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous estrogens upregulate UA H 2 S biosynthesis in OVX sheep, suggesting that H 2 S contributes to estrogen-induced uterine vasodilatation (Supported by NIH HL 70562, HL 98746 and HD08783). INTRODUCTION: A history of completed pregnancy is associated with reduced risk of breast cancer in later years and those pregnancies associated with preeclampsia (PE) demonstrate a further reduction in risk. It has recently emerged that pregnancies and multiparity are both positively associated with an aggressive tumor subtype termed triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) defined by the absence of expression of estrogen, progesterone, and Her2-neu receptors. Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between a history of PE and breast cancer subtypes (TNBC vs. other subtypes). METHODS: From a population-based cohort study of all women aged 20-44 diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the Seattle-Puget Sound area, we conducted a secondary recontact interview, including detailed obstetric history. For this analysis, we considered all pregnancies before a breast cancer diagnosis. Pathology reports confirmed tumor type. Each woman was considered according to whether she had experienced PE with one or more pregnancies at any gestational age (GA), and according to whether she had experienced preterm PE with one or more pregnancies (delivery <37 weeks GA). Chi-square and logistic regression were used for analysis. An additional analysis considering all pregnancies was performed, using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for possible correlation between repeated measures from the same subject. RESULTS: There were 318 parous women available for analysis with 27 (8.5%) with any history of PE, 12 (3.8%) of which had preterm PE. Though PE at any GA was not associated with tumor type, prior preterm PE was more common in women with TNBC, a trend which reached significance after adjustment for age at time of cancer diagnosis and race. Analysis of all pregnancies using GEE yielded similar results. ",

METHODS: Experiments were carried out on uterine radial arteries isolated from non-pregnant (n= 18) and age-matched late pregnant (day 20/22; n= 20) Sprague Dawley rats. Arterial segments were pressurized to 50 mmHg in an arteriograph, preconstricted 40-50% with phenylephrine, and tested with a specific agonist and antagonist of GPER (G1 and G15, respectively). To compare reproductive and systemic vessels, an identical protocol was applied to isolated resistance mesenteric arteries. RESULTS: A dose-response curve was obtained for G1 in the 1 pM -1 \u00b5M range, with a maximum vasodilation of uterine arteries of 81 \u00b1 6.8% in non-pregnant vs. 35 \u00b1 7% (p<0.001) in pregnant rats; mesenteric arteries also dilated 56 \u00b1 3.4% and 45 \u00b1 9.4% (p=0.02), respectively, in vessels from non-pregnant vs. pregnant rats. G1 vasodilation was significantly inhibited in presence of G15. Interestingly, the vasodilatory effects of 17b-Estradiol were not affected by the inhibition of GPER in uterine arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that GPER produces functional effects in resistance uterine arteries and are in agreement with a previous study on different type of arteries. Vasodilation in response to G1 was reduced by pregnancy in both uterine and mesenteric arteries, although this effect was only statistically significant in the former. The preservation of vasodilation to estradiol in the presence of G15, a specific GPER inhibitor, suggests the non-involvement of GPER in the estrogen vasodilatory effects on uterine vasculature, although some indirect (co-modulatory) effects cannot be excluded. Thus, while GPER maybe not be directly activated by estrogen, its vasodilatory effect may contribute to the increase of uteroplacental blood flow during pregnancy.",

We hypothesise that asthma during pregnancy will be associated with enhanced chemotaxis of maternal monocytes particularly in women who experience an exacerbation during pregnancy compared to non-asthmatic pregnant women. The aim of this study was to assess the chemotactic capabilities of monocytes from asthmatic and nonasthmatic pregnant women in relation to fetal sex, asthma exacerbations and severity. METHODS: Venous blood was collected from pregnant asthmatic subjects and controls at 12, 18, 30 and 36 weeks gestation and 6 month post-partum (n = 10 per group). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, and chemotaxis was assessed using a transwell assay with Monocyte Chemoattract Protein-1 as the chemoattactant. Cells were loaded into the upper chamber, and after incubation, the number of cells that migrated were counted using a Scepter cell counter. Chemotactic response was expressed as migration index relative to cells with media alone and compared between the different groups. RESULTS: Current data has identified that at 30 weeks gestation there is no variation in the chemotactic ability of monocytes from pregnant women with asthma, with and without an exacerbation during pregnancy and compared to non-asthmatic pregnant women. When data were split according to fetal sex, there was a trend of reduced monocyte chemotactic ability in women pregnant with a male fetus who experienced an exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: Suppression of monocyte chemotaxis appears to be sex specific. In pregnancies with a female fetus mechanisms other than monocyte chemotaxis may contribute to worsening asthma such as differences in neutrophil function. Further research focused on understanding the mechanisms that cause the disease to worsen with pregnancy will help improve management and reduce poor pregnancy outcomes associated with an asthma exacerbation.",

To isolate the effects of a 20% increase in AGT expression, we study a murine AGT gene titration (3-copy) model (TG). We have recently shown using microbubble-enhanced ultrasound imaging that this mouse model has faster uteroplacental blood flow velocity and reduced spiral artery transit time compared with wild-type controls (WT). Our objective now was to test for differences in uterine spiral artery remodeling in TG and WT dams; and, to determine whether fetal genotype may influence this important mechanism underlying placental insufficiency. METHODS: Uteroplacental vasculature from four WT and four TG dams were perfused with x-ray contrast at embryonic day 17 and 3D microcomputed tomography images were obtained for WT and for 2and 3-copy TG pups (n=7-9 placentas/group). Arterial vessel numbers, diameters, and degree of spiral artery coiling were measured using Amira visualization software. Maternal and fetal AGT expression levels were measured using fresh liver samples and Taqman qRT-PCR. Placental sflt-1 levels were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: TG dams and 3-copy fetuses expressed elevated AGT levels (125%) compared with WT controls and their 2-copy siblings from TG dams. WT dams exhibited a complex network of spiral arteries (4 to 6 per tree) that merged into large canals feeding the intervillous space. In contrast, the number of spiral arteries in TG dams was reduced by 28% (4.6 +/-0.3 (SEM) vs. 3.3+/-0.4, p<0.001), and 3D surface renderings revealed further reductions in spiral artery coiling, length and branching. Interestingly, 3-copy pups exhibited a more pronounced deficit in spiral artery number and coiling than their 2-copy siblings from TG dams. Placentas from TG dams made more sflt-1, which was surprisingly most pronounced with the fetus was male compared with female siblings.",

CONCLUSIONS: It is known that tolerogenic fetal immune responses to non-inherited maternal antigens exist (via regulatory T cells) but the degree to which this includes other antigens, for example derived from maternal infections or vaccinations during pregnancy, has not been studied. Our initial results demonstrate a link between placental location over a prior uterine scar and increased maturity of tolerogenic fetal lymphocytes. Our study indicates that intrauterine formation of tolerogenic fetal responses increases with fetal exposure to a scarred uterus potentially increasing the formation of inappropriate tolerogenic responses. While the fetus can cope with antigens in utero by favoring immune tolerance, inadvertent exposure to some antigens in utero (such as vaccine antigens) may lead to long lasting immune tolerance when effector phenotype may be desired. Thus, factors that limit fetal antigenic exposure may be critical in allowing the development of fetal/child effector responses to provide protection against infections. Our results highlight the role that uterine integrity plays as an immunologic barrier. although the human placenta highly expresses receptors that scavenge heme-haptoglobin and heme-hemopexin complexes (LRP1 and CD163, respectively). The aim of this study was to intrinsically label maternal RBC's early in gestation using a stable Fe isotope ( 57 Fe) and compare neonatal cord blood enrichment of RBC-derived Fe with that of inorganic Fe ( 58 FeS0 4 ) given in late gestation. Neonatal and maternal RBC Fe enrichment will be compared to maternal hemopexin and haptoglobin concentrations, maternal and neonatal Fe status and to expression of key placental heme and non-heme Fe transporters at delivery. METHODS: Pregnant women (n=20, ages \u2265 15 y) will receive 15-20 mg of 57Fe orally as FeS04 between 13-15 wks of gestation to label the Friday maternal RBC pool at a time when little fetal Fe accrual occurs. RBC Fe enrichment disappearance curves will be monitored at 16-18, 24-26, and 35-37 wks of gestation and at delivery. A second stable isotope (1 mg of 58Fe as FeS04) will be given in late gestation (wk 33-35). Absorption of each form of Fe will be measured 2 weeks post-dosing; at delivery enrichment of both isotopes in cord blood will be measured to assess net fetal transfer of dietary and maternal endogenous Fe. A full complement of Fe status indicators will be measured. RESULTS: To date, 10 women (28.0 \u00b1 1.7 y) have received 15.2 \u00b1 1.5 mg of 57 Fe as FeS0 4 at 15.1 \u00b1 0.8 weeks of gestation. At entry, 20% of the women (n=10) were anemic. Ferritin decreased across gestation and 50% of women were anemic at term. Iron absorption in early pregnancy was inversely associated with ferritin and averaged 13.7 \u00b1 10.4% (n=7). Six women received 58 Fe at 33.8 \u00b1 0.9 wks gestation. RBC enrichment declined over the last 23 wks of gestation and 57 Fe-RBC disappearance curves were variable. Studies are underway to relate RBC disappearance curves with maternal / neonatal Fe status and enrichment in the neonate at birth. CONCLUSIONS: Using this novel biomedical mass spectrometric approach, unique in vivo data on placental transport of Fe from variable maternal Fe sources will be obtained. Comprehensive knowledge of the placental vasculature is vital to understanding normal and complicated fetal growth and development. Chorionic plate vascular morphological differences in placentas of normal and abnormally grown fetuses have undergone limited evaluation using gross observation and corrosion casting.These methods do not allow complete visualization and analyses of the chorionic vessel branching and morphology, particularly at the level of the delicate networks that constitute the terminal branches. Our aims were (i) to devise an effective, detailed and sophisticated technique to define and analyse human chorionic vessels and (ii) to compare chorionic vascularity in placentas obtained from normal pregnancies and those complicated by fetal growth restriction (FGR).",

RESULTS: High resolution micro-CT imaging of corrosion casted vascular models permitted analyses of the entire chorionic vasculature and terminal branches to 60\u00b5m resolution. Compared to normal (n = 12), FGR placental arterial casts (n = 6) demonstrated fewer branches of large calibre chorionic arteries (p = 0.0071, Mann-Whitney test) which terminate as a fine network of arterioles. Similarly, preliminary findings indicate poor vascularity at the arteriolar level in the FGR casts. CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first to demonstrate the validity of micro-CT as an effective technique for the examination of the morphology of chorionic vessels. Our preliminary findings show impoverished chorionic arterial vascularity in FGR placentas. The consequence of this may be insufficient blood and nutrient supply to the fetus. This provides insight into the likely events preceding or associated with failed intrauterine growth. Only a minority report experiments using purified term primary trophoblasts. Therefore, we set up a protocol where primary trophoblast isolations would be the main in vitro tissue used in our laboratory. From previous reports we were uncertain: 1) whether negative selection was essential 2) whether forskolin syncytialisation was required 3) of seeding density 4) whether primary trophoblasts had the machinery to produce sFlt-1. Thus, we performed a systematic examination of these questions in order to propose an 'optimal protocol' for primary trophoblast isolation. METHODS: Trophoblasts were isolated by trypsin digestion and separation on a percoll gradient, before negative selection using CD9. Purity was assessed by immunocytochemical analysis of CK7.",

To assess the functional utility of these cells, we administered siJMJD6, a key molecule involved in the splicing of sFlt1 and assessed sFlt secretion. Experiments were repeated with at least 3-4 different placentas. RESULTS: 1)Negative selection using CD9 produced a highly pure population (>98% cytokeratin staining of cells). 2)Initial plating of 175,000, 0.5 or 1 million cells/cm 2 produced monolayers with 40-50%, 60-70% and 80-90% confluency at 16h respectively. 3)Surprisingly, primary trophoblasts did not spontaneously syncytialise, with little to no hCG secreted 16 and 40h post plating. In contrast hCG secretion was significantly increased in forskolin treated cells, indicating enhanced syncytialisation. 4)Primary trophoblasts produced high levels of sFlt1 from the initiation of culture, and levels were increased with forskolin. siJMJD6 induced >70% reduction of Jmjd6 mRNA expression, and translated to a significant decrease in sFlt1 protein secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Primary trophoblasts represent an easily accessible in vitro model of the syncytiotrophoblast. Negative selection is essential to produce a pure population, and syncytialisation can be enhanced by administration of forskolin.

AT2R also correlated with HIF1a mRNA expression (r=0.512, P=0.013). Under these experimental conditions, there was no association between the angiotensin receptors and HIF2a. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a strong interaction between AngII receptors and HIF1b at the gene level. We are exploring whether this is mirrored in protein expression. In this study mRNA stability was not assessed, however HIF1b is the most stable and constitutively-expressed subunit. Translocation of HIF complexes to the nucleus can only occur after binding to HIF1b; regulation of this subunit therefore could have a significant effect on responsiveness to oxygen changes. AT2R are most highly expressed early in pregnancy and this association with the oxygen-sensing units, reemphasises a possible role for RAS in normal placental development. INTRODUCTION: Differential diagnosis between late fetal growth restriction (late-IUGR) and constitution small fetus (SGA), their monitoring criteria and decision on timing of delivery remain highly controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the possible contribute of uterine blood flow volume measurements in improving our understanding of this condition. METHODS: 27 singleton pregnancies with late-IUGR fetuses >34+6 weeks were enrolled in this study. IUGR was diagnosed by abdominal circumference < 5 th percentile, and/or by growth restriction <40 th percentiles in longitudinal exams. Doppler velocimetry of Uterine (UtPI) and Umbilical (UmbPI) arteries was recorded. Uterine and Umbilical blood flow volumes were measured (Barbera 1999; Rigano 2010). Gestational age at delivery and newborn weight was recorded. P values <0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: Gestational age and newborn weight at delivery were 39\u00b11 and 2610 (i.q. 2345-2790). Labor was induced in all cases, but one breech presentation and one multiple cesarean section. Mean pH at birth was 7.26 (i.q. 7.19 -7.30). All UtPI and UmbPI were normal.

Placental histology and larger clinical cohorts are needed to confi rm this emerging hypothesis. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor, is a classic receptor of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzop-dioxin (TCDD). AhR mediates TCDD-induced increases in fetal and neonatal mortality and decreases in litter sizes. However, AhR knockout in mice also leads to similar adverse phenotypes in the fetus and newborn, partially due to abnormal vascular development. We have reported the expression of AhR in human umbilical cord vein (HUVE) & artery (HUAE) endothelial cells as well as in human term placentas. To examine physiological roles of AhR in fetoplacental vasculature, we test the hypothesis that 2-(1'H-indole-3'-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE, an endogenous AhR ligand) and TCDD (an exogenous AhR ligand) suppress endothelial cell proliferation and migration in HUVE and HUAE cells via AhR. METHODS: Cell proliferation and migration were assayed. Cell cycle progression was analyzed by fl ow cytometry. Western blotting was used to quantify changes in target protein levels. Special AhR siRNA was used to knockdown AhR expression. RESULTS: ITE at 1 mM and TCDD at 10 nM were used in this study. We observed that ITE and TCDD inhibited (p < 0.05) HUAE and HUVE cell proliferation by ~ 30% on Day 6 of treatment, but ITE and TCDD at the indicated dose did not affect the cell cycle progression. ITE and TCDD inhibited (p < 0.05) HUAE (by ~ 40% and 30% for ITE and TCDD, respectively), whereas did not affect HUVE cell migration. ITE and TCDD rapidly decreased (p < 0.05) AhR protein levels in HUVE (~ 80% by ITE at 2 hr and 80% by TCDD at 8 hr) and HUAE (~90% by ITE and ~ 85% by TCDD at 8 hr) cells, indicating activation of AhR. AhR siRNA specifi cally suppressed (p < 0.05)AhR protein levels in HUVE (~ 90% We have reported the expression of SDF2 in human placenta in different compartments throughout pregnancy. We showed this expression is higher during second trimester of pregnancy, which is maintained until term. The function of SDF2 is not known in mammals, but the high expression -especially in syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast from villi -intrigued us to investigate the role of the placental SDF2 during gestation. METHODS: Primary cytotrophoblast cells (CTBs) were obtained from second trimester placentas by enzyme digestion and Percoll gradients. Cells were plated in matrigel and maintained in culture for 30 min, 24 h and 48 h for differentiation assays. An additional group was maintained for 24 h and then submitted to 1 h or overnight in hypoxia (2 % O 2 ). BeWo cells were also cultured for 24 and 48 h and an additional group were submitted to hypoxia using DMOG (1mM). The expression of SDF2, HIF-1a (Hypoxia inducible factor 1 a) and hCG were evaluated and b-actin and cytokeratin were used as loading control for Western Blot assays and trophoblast marker in immunofl uorescence assays respectively. RESULTS: In differentiation assays SDF2 was upregulated in CTBs after 24 h and after 48 h in BeWo cells. In hypoxia SDF2 was downregulated after 1 h in CTBs and after 48 h in BeWo. Immunofl uorescence and Western Blot of HIF-1a confi rmed hypoxia condition for CTBs and BeWo cells respectively. Elisa for hCG confi rmed CTBs differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest SDF2 is playing a role in the trophoblast differentiation. A role for this molecule activity during placental development has not been previously suspected. Further studies addressing function assays to understand the exact play role by this protein at maternal-fetal interface are in progress. Supported by FAPESP and CNPq. Epidemiological studies have shown that dietary intake of foods and beverages rich in polyphenols is associated with improved health outcomes. As the use of natural health products (NHPs) increases in popularity, more research studying the biological effects of polyphenol consumption is required, especially during pregnancy. Leaf extracts from many plants, including Vaccinium angustifolium Ait. (Lowbush blueberry), have been used as traditional medicines and are currently recommended as NHPs. The benefi cial effects of V. angustifolium may be explained by its antioxidant and anti-infl ammatory activities. Furthermore, other Vaccinium species have been shown to promote cell migration for wound healing. Since many pregnancy complications are associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation, and altered trophoblast invasion, we wanted to: (1) determine the effects of V. angustifolium leaf extract on trophoblast biology; and (2) characterize the active components in the extract. METHODS: Dose-response studies were performed by treating HTR-8/SVneo cells with the extract for 24 or 48 hours. Trophoblast invasion was determined using Matrigel-coated Boyden chamber inserts. Cell proliferation and viability were assessed using BrdU incorporation and trypan blue exclusion assays, respectively. Crude extract was characterized using UPLC-MS-QTOF and fractioned in a four-part series extraction. RESULTS: At 20 ng/mL, the extract significantly increased cell invasion and had no effect on cell proliferation or viability. Phenolic acids, flavonoids, and terpenes were identified in the crude extract. Extracts isolated using hexane and acetonitrile increased cell migration to a degree comparable to the effect seen with the crude extract. CONCLUSIONS: V. angustifolium leaf extract increases trophoblast invasion and has no effect on cell proliferation or viability. Preliminary results suggest that polyphenols are major components of the crude extract.",

Mechanistic studies are currently underway to determine the effects of the extract on cell signaling. The multidrug transporters, P-glycoprotein (Pgp, encoded by the ABCB1 gene) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, encoded by ABCG2) are expressed in the first trimester human placenta and protect the embryo / fetus from exposure to toxins, drugs and other xenobiotics that may be present in the maternal circulation. Viral or bacterial challenge has been shown to down-regulate expression of multidrug transporters in rodents. In the current study, we hypothesized that bacterial and viral challenge (as modeled by exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and poly I:C, respectively) will down regulate expression of P-gp and BCRP in the human first trimester placenta. This would result in increased exposure of the embryo/fetus to potentially harmful drugs and toxins in the maternal circulation. METHODS: First trimester placental villous explants (n=6) were collected and cultured with LPS (0.1-10ug/mL) or Poly I:C (1-50ug/mL) for either 4h or 24h. ABCB1, ABCG2, TLR-3, TLR-4, IL-6, IL-8 and CCl2 mRNA expression levels were assessed by RT-PCR and protein (P-gp and BCRP) by western blotting. RESULTS: LPS treatment (24h) decreased (p<0.0001) placental ABCB1 and ABCG2 mRNA levels, but had no effect on TLR-3 and TLR-4 mRNA.

Future studies analyzing PE fetal blood inflammation and oxidative stress status are needed in order to assess increased mtDNA levels possible origins. INTRODUCTION: 3D placental reconstruction/analysis could improve our understanding of healthy/complicated pregnancies but a universally accepted model of the term human placental villous tree is lacking. We therefore applied a novel 3D digital method for the virtual reconstruction of the human placenta (villous tree, fetal membranes, parenchyma) in order to better appreciate its normal/pathological morphology. Friday METHODS: Placentas were obtained from normal/complicated (preeclampsia (PET), gestational diabetes, growth restricted; each n=1) pregnancies following term elective caesarean sections. Full depth placental segments were formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded and serially sectioned. Slides were stained with H&E, digitized on an automated slide scanner and reconstructed using sequential image-based registration. Interactive segmentation highlighted various placental structures which were iso-surfaced to yield volumes of areas of interest (stem villi and their branches in normal/PET cases).",

CONCLUSIONS: Successful development of the villous architecture and its circulatory network is essential to support a healthy, term pregnancy. Virtual pathology is superseding conventional microscopy in creating high-resolution 3D models. The approach combines simple histology with an automated registration algorithm to generate a high dataset throughput with minimal user interaction. This method enables users to examine tissue microstructural and likely functional differences between tissues, especially if combined with immunohistochemistry. Its application in this study highlights its merit as a vital research tool enabling users to examine placental histoarchitecture at a cellular resolution, thereby gaining clinically relevant insight into the placental pathology of pregnancy complications. Coffee is the most commonly consumed pharmacologically active beverage in the UK, above alcohol (1). Coffee contains biologically active chemicals including caffeine, caffeic acid (CA) and chlorogenic acid (CHLA); the latter are natural phenols with antioxidant properties and potential health benefits. Pregnant women are encouraged to limit their caffeine consumption during pregnancy. However potential effects of CA/CHLA on placental function are unknown. We aimed to investigate the effects of caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid on placental arterial function. METHODS: Human chorionic plate arteries, isolated from placental biopsies (elective Caesarean section from women with uncomplicated pregnancies; maternal age 24-39), were mounted on a wire myograph (2). Vessel viability was determined with 120mM potassium solution (KPSS), U46619 (Thromboxane A 2 mimetic) and bradykinin. Doseresponse curves to CA and CHLA (both 10 -8 -10 -3 M) were constructed to determine direct contractile or relaxatory (in presence of U46619-induced contraction) effects. Contractile effects of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ; 10 -3 M) were determined post-incubation with CA/CHLA (10 -3 ; 15 minutes). Data was expressed as mean+/-SEM. RESULTS: CPA (n=64) diameters were 324+/-15\u00b5m. CA and CHLA did not significantly increase basal tone (n=42; CA 1.2+/-0.6kPa vs. Control 0.9+/-0.5kPa and CHLA 0.2+/-0.1vs. Control 0.2+/-0.1). Neither CA nor CHLA induced relaxation of U46619-contracted CPA's (n=30. Peak H 2 O 2 induced contraction in CPA's was unchanged (4.9+/-0.9 vs. 4.4+/-1.0kPa) but the longevity of response was reduced by pre-incubation with CA but not CHLA (22+/-3 vs. 53+/-12%) of maximal H 2 O 2 -induced contraction at 15mins (P<0.05; M-W U test). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CA may protect placental CPA's from ROS-induced stimuli. Further studies will focus on the effects of coffee oils (e.g. cafestol) and chronic incubation of CA/CHLA on placental arteries. Progesterone supplementation shows promise in reducing preterm birth in those women at risk. The role of progesterone in mitigating the early pathologic activation of labor through diverse, yet interrelated pathways is an area of active research. Aberrant uteroplacental flow is implicated as an independent risk factor for preterm birth. In an ex vivo placental perfusion model 17-hydroxyprogesterone has demonstrated the ability to attenuate vasoconstriction in the fetal blood vessels of human placentas. The objective of this study was to investigate if micronized progesterone (P4) has the ability to attenuate thromboxane mimetic U46619-mediated fetoplacental artery vasoconstriction. METHODS: Paired cotyledons obtained from the same placenta of five term, healthy, non-labored subjects were used in a modified dual cotyledon perfusion model. The fetal artery and maternal intervillous space of one cotyledon was infused with P4 while another cotyledon was infused with control perfusate. After 30 minutes, a bolus dose of U44619 was administered to both cotyledons.",

INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy in obese women is associated with increased infl ammation in the placenta and programs the offspring for adult cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs, which regulate target gene expression through mRNA cleavage or translational repression. We have previously shown: 1) a role for miR-210 in mitochondrial dysfunction in preeclamptic placentas, and 2) fetal sex-dependent differences in expression of miR-210 in the placenta with maternal obesity. We hypothesized that activation of NFkB by infl ammation will affect the expression of miR-210 and, as a consequence, placental mitochondrial function. METHODS: Placentas of male or female fetuses from women of healthy BMI with uncomplicated pregnancies were collected after c-section at term (no labor). Cytotrophoblast cells were isolated and syncytialized for 72 hrs. To mimic the infl ammatory state of obesity, syncytiotrophoblasts (ST) were treated with TNFa (10ng/ml, 2 hrs), an activator of NFkB1.",

This was accompanied by a 50% reduction (p<0.05) in the expression of miR-210 target genes -Iron Sulfur Cluster assembly proteins and NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex 4. No signifi cant changes in miR-210 expression (1.2\u00b10.2 fold) were observed in male ST. In parallel, binding of NFkB1 to the miR-210 promoter measured by ChIP assay was detected in TNFa-treated ST of females but not males. Co-transfection with siRNA to NFkB1 (100nM, 48hrs) was suffi cient to prevent the TNFa-mediated upregulation of miR-210 expression in the ST.

We hypothesized that miR-143 expression is down-regulated in GDM placenta mediating a switch in mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis. METHODS: Placental villous tissue was collected at term after C-section (no labor) from women with gestational diabetes, treated with diet alone (A1GDM), or with glyburide/insulin (A2GDM) (n=6/each group). The control group (CTR) included placentae collected from healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies, matched for pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational age (n=6).

Mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis were measured in syncytiotrophoblasts (ST) cultured for 72hrs from control and A2GDM placenta by Seahorse XF24. RESULTS: There was no signifi cant difference in fetal weight, however, placental weight was higher (p<0.05) in A2GDM (733\u00b158g, mean+SE) but not in A1GDM (706\u00b176g, p=0.06) vs.CTR (587\u00b148g).

The inflammatory or metabolic milieu of the obese pregnant woman may cause epigenetic changes in DNA methylation in placenta that modulate function. With genome scale analysis we found increased DNA methylation (5mC) and decreased DNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC) in placentas of obese vs healthy weight women. TET enzymes convert 5mC to 5hmC to alter gene expression from inactive to active. The mitochondrial enzyme IDH2 catalyses formation of a-ketoglutarate (aKG) a co-factor for TET activity providing a pathway for metabolic regulation of DNA methylation. We determined the effect of obesity on the association between differential methylation of IDH and TET, their mRNA expression and the functional consequence. METHODS: RNA was isolated and cDNA prepared from villous tissue (5 random samples/placenta) collected at term by c. section in the absence of labor from healthy (term BMI 27.4\u00b12.2, mean\u00b1SD, n=21) and obese (38.1\u00b12.3, n=21) women with normal pregnancy outcomes. mRNA expression of TET and IDH genes was measured by qRT-PCR. Expression of CSH-GH and PSG gene cluster members, which we previously found to be differentially methylated with obesity, was measured as a functional readout. RESULTS: Expression of TET1, TET2 and IDH2 (mitochondrial) genes was significantly decreased (p<0.05) in placenta of obese vs healthy women. In parallel, expression of CSHL1, GH2 and PSG2 was significantly decreased (p<0.05). Expanding studies to 63 women (BMI 23-42) showed an inverse correlation of placental IDH2 expression with increasing maternal BMI (p<0.02). The association of TET2 with BMI just failed to reach significance. There was a significant correlation between IDH2 and TET2 expression (p<0.0001), between IDH2 and CSHL1 (p<0.005) and between TET2 and CSHL1 (p<0.02). CONCLUSIONS: TET2 may sense metabolic or oxidative stress states in placenta via IDH2 and aKG. IDH2 mutations have been shown to impair TET2 catalytic activity. We previously found evidence of decreased DNA hydroxymethylation of IDH2 in placenta with obesity which thus may mediate the decreased IDH2 expression shown here. The relationship between IDH2, TET2 and CSHL1 expression suggests a functional role for differential methylation of this pathway in metabolic sensing with obesity and regulation of placental gene expression. Higher rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes have been observed in pregnancies where the fetus is male. We investigated whether there was an association between fetal sex and levels of several candidate biomarkers (placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble endoglin (sEng), metallopeptidase domain 12 (ADAM-12) and insulin-like growth factor acid labile subunit (IGFALS)) previously identified as predictive of preeclampsia (PE).",

CONCLUSIONS: These data fit a contemporary hypothesis that female and male offspring respond differently to insults during gestation. Males maintain their growth trajectory in an adverse maternal environment while females reduce growth and are thereby more likely to survive further maternal insults.

We aimed to determine whether changes in any of these proteins were demonstrable in serum-free media samples generated from placental explants cultured under different oxygen conditions. METHODS: 1 st trimester placental villous explants were established from tissue obtained from termination of pregnancy procedures (n=9, all 7-9 weeks gestation). Explants were pre-conditioned at 1% O 2 before being cultured at 1%, 6% or 20% O 2 in serum-free media for 48h with a replacement of media at 24h. A panel of 69 proteins was measured using selective reaction monitoring. RESULTS: A number of low abundance proteins which were differentially expressed in plasma from women with pre-eclampsia were down regulated in placental explants (1% vs 6% O 2 fold change): Ectonucleotide phosphodiesterase-2 (ENPP-2, 0.67; p=0.02), Prenylcysteine oxidase 1 (PCYOX, 0.76; p=0.02), Kunitz-type protease inhibitor 1 (SPIT-1, 0.65; p=0.03), cystatin-c (CYTC, 0.73; p=<0.01), ADAM-12 (0.78; p=0.02) and Sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX-1, 0.72; p=0.02). Both Peroxiredoxin-1 and 2 were upregulated in hypoxic explants (PRDX1, 1.19; PRDX2, 1.28; p=0.01) and in 20 week plasma samples from women with PE. Serum amyloid A-4 protein (SAA4, 2.23; p=0.01), phosphatidylinositolglycan-specific phospholipase D (PHLD, 1.52, p=0.01) and placental anticoagulant 3 (ANXA3, 1.23, p=0.01) were upregulated in hypoxic explants but unchanged in PE plasma. ENPP-2 and CYTC were also significantly increased in explants at 20% O 2 . CONCLUSIONS: A number of proteins, which have been identified as candidate biomarkers for pre-eclampsia in pre-diagnosis plasma samples are significantly changed in placental explants exposed to hypoxia. This confirms that changes in circulating levels of these proteins are likely to originate from placental dysfunction. Further work is necessary to explore the role of these proteins in the placenta.

To date, there have been no studies looking specifically at Wnt signalling cross-talk between trophoblast (fetal) and decidua (maternal) cells in vitro. METHODS: Human placental trophoblast and decidual cells were grown in co-culture and their gene expression profiles compared with/ without co-culture. Intracellular and secreted levels of Wnt inhibitors were determined by ELISA and immunoblotting to determine the effects of co-culture on Wnt signalling and its regulation. RESULTS: Expression analysis of Wnt components using a Wnt PCR array (Qiagen) showed that the majority of the 84 Wnt-related genes on the array were detectable in both cell types and the majority of genes were not differentially expressed in co-culture; however, expression of the secreted Wnt inhibitors secreted frizzled related protein (sFRP4), Dickkopf 1 and Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (Wif1) were up regulated in trophoblast co-culture, findings confirmed by real time qPCR. The protein levels of all three antagonists in cell extracts of trophoblast co-culture were found to be up-regulated by ELISA. A number of other proteins with important roles in implantation/placentation were shown interact with the Wnt signalling components. Among these, Msh homeobox 1 and cyclooxygenase-1 (PTGS-1) expression were up-regulated in trophoblasts with decidual co-culture, consistent with an increased inhibition of Wnt signalling in response to increased antagonists levels.",

Intracellular calcium levels were measured using Indo-1 by flow cytometric analysis. Ionomycin(a calcium ionophore) and thapsigargin(an endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPas pump inhibitor) were used for tracking the cytoplasmic and ER calcium flux. Among the calcium dependent adhesion molecules, we assessed the desmosome formation by immunofluorescence staining against desmoplakin and performed Western blot for E-cadherin in JEG-3 cells stably expressing either mStrawberry-Atg4B C74A or the control vector. RESULTS: Invasion of JEG-3 cells expressing mStrawberry-Atg4B C74A was increased by 7-9 folds compared with the control. This result was consistent with our previous observation. We found that the suppression of autophagy was associated with the depletion of intracellular and ER calcium store in JEG-3 cells, which was restored with the supplementation of calcium. We also found that the suppression of autophagy also induced the derangement of desmosome formation detected by immunofluorescence staining. Notably, suppression of autophagy induced a significant decrease in the expression of E-cadherin in JEG-3 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that the inhibition of autophagy affected the depletion of intracellular calcium store, thereby affecting the calcium-dependent adhesion molecules in JEG-3 cells. Taken together, inhibition of autophagy seems to increase invasion of JEG-3 cells by lowering intracellular calcium concentration which disrupted desmosome formation.",

METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for detection of myostatin, cytokeratin 7, vimentin and HLA-G was performed on paraffin imbedded third trimester placentae. Chromogenic reaction was completed with DAB and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin.Mass Spectrometry (MS) analysis was performed on a TripleTOF\u00ae 5600 system (ABSCIEX) using a Scheduled High Resolution Multiple Reaction Monitoring (sMRM HR ) method developed for the detection of myostatin. Myostatin treatments in the absence of FBS (0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.5 and1mg/ml) were applied to to HTR-8/SVneo cells* (model of extravillous trophoblast; EVT) seeded on Collagen I-coated 96 well plates at densities of 10x 10 4 for proliferation and 5 x 10 5 for migration assays.

HTR-8/SVneo was significantly (p<0.05) increased in proliferation in a concentration dependent manner with myostatin treatment and migration of HTR-8/ SVneo was significantly (p<0.05) increased with all myostatin treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Myostatin is localized to EVT cells and up-regulates proliferation and migration of EVT (HTR-8/SVneo) cells.

A common link between the maternal syndrome and early placentation is the highly oxidative environment. Isoprostanes are a lipid peroxidation product that can increase vasoconstriction and limit placental perfusion through binding to the thromboxane receptor (TP); however, the complement of TP expressed during pregnancy and PE is undocumented. The objective of the study was to document the expression of and regulation of trophoblast function by TP isoforms during pregnancy. METHODS: IHC was performed on sections from \"normal\" and PE pregnancies. Stable ectopic expression of TPa, TPb or TPD328 (the region common to both receptors) in trophoblast cell lines (BeWo, JEG-3) was achieved using transfection. The effect of these receptors on proliferation, syncytialization in response to 100 mM forskolin, and motility was subsequently assessed. RESULTS: Elevated levels of the human-specific TP isoform, TPb, were identified in syncytiotrophoblast and extravillous cytotrophoblast populations in placentae affected by PE but not normal tissue. TPa expression enhanced proliferation (increased expression of cyclin A/ D1/E), syncytialization of BeWo cells (3-fold reduction in E-cadherin) and migration of JEG-3 cells. By comparison, TPb activation attenuated proliferation (increased expression of p27 and p53), syncytialization and migration of trophoblasts (p<0.0001 compared to TPa). These effects (not shared by the TPD328 mutant) were localised to the divergent C-terminus of TPb and were mediated through direct protein-protein interactions within distinct domains. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the TPa isoform, expressed normally on trophoblasts, enhances the processes required for normal placentation. However, activation of the TPb isoform produces a cellular phenotype consistent with the abnormal placentation observed in PE and indicates that the pathologic upregulation of TPb in the placenta may play a role in regulating the onset and severity of PE.",

Obstetrics and Gynecology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA. INTRODUCTION: Improper placental perfusion can lead to pregnancy complications and loss of the fetus. K + channels are known to contribute to vascular remodeling during pregnancy and their dysfunction may underlie pregnancy-related vascular diseases. Overexpression of one K + channel in particular, the small conductance Ca 2+ -activated K + channel (SK3), leads to a high rate of fetal demise and intrauterine growth restriction in mice, indicating an important role for this channel in pregnancy. Here, we describe how maladaptation of the placental vasculature in SK3 T/T pups may contribute to their lethal phenotype. METHODS: Paraformaldehyde fixed, paraffin embedded placentas from SK3 T/T and WT mice were sectioned and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin to look for structural abnormalities. Immunoblots probing for the endothelial marker CD31 were performed on placental lysates. Placental vascular structure of SK3 T/T and WT mice was examined using MicroCT. RESULTS: Histological analysis of placental sections showed altered morphology at early gestational stages (gd10 and 14). Most notably, the placental labyrinth was decreased in thickness at gd10 in SK3 T/T mice compared to controls. By gd14, the labyrinth showed reduced number of labyrinthine trophoblasts leading to abnormal placental vasculogenesis in the SK3 T/T mice. This was apparent by the presence of abnormally dilated blood vessels. SK3 T/T placentas at gd18 showed no difference in labyrinth size or morphology from WT indicating an altered growth trajectory from controls and placental plasticity. To look for specific markers of the maladaptation, CD31 was used to quantify and compare endothelial cell density as a marker for blood vessels in SK3 T/T and control mice. CD31 expression was increased in SK3 T/T gd10 placentas compared to controls. To determine the physiological impact of the altered placental morphology, vessel density was quantified using MicroCT and other imaging techniques. The SK3 T/T placentas displayed 3.5 fold higher vessel density than control mice. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest the SK3 channel plays a vital role in the modulating the morphology and vascularization pattern of the placenta. It also suggests that mistimed vascularization of the placenta may lead to increased fetal demise and intrauterine growth restriction.",

An imbalance can lead to impaired development of the utero-placental vasculature, ineffective delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, and pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). A mouse model that overexpresses the small conductance Ca 2+ -activated K + channel (SK3 T/T ), a prevalent channel in the endothelium, has increased fetal demise and IUGR. We examined whether an improper angiogenic signaling results in poor fetal outcomes observed in SK3 T/T mice. METHODS: Serum and placental VEGF, PlGF, and sFlt-1, levels were measured by ELISAs in SK3 T/T and control mice. VEGF, PlGF, and sFlt-1 placental transcript levels were measured by qPCR. All experiments were performed at pregnancy days 10, 14, and 18. RESULTS: VEGF, PlGF (pro-angiogenic) and sFlt-1 (anti-angiogenic) showed no differences in the VEGF blood serum levels at any gestational stage in SK3 T/T compared to wild type (WT) mice. There was a significant decrease in PlGF levels at pregnancy day 18 (P18) in SK3 T/T mice compared to WT. sFlt-1 levels in the SK3 T/T mice were also decreased at P10 and P18 compared to WT. Despite similar VEGF levels in WT vs. SK3 T/T in the serum, placental explants showed increased levels of secreted VEGF at each gestational age in SK3 T/T compared to WT. Placental sFlt-1 secretion was decreased at P10 in SK3 T/T compared to WT, but remediated by P18. Conversely, SK3 T/T mice have increased secretion of PlGF at P10 before decreasing by P18. Finally, qPCR results of these factors in placenta corresponded with changes in gene with increased transcript levels of PlGF and VEGF at P10 and decreased sFlt-1 levels in P18 in SK3 T/T compared to WT placentas. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the SK3 channel influences the serum and placental secretion rates of the angiogenic factors: PlGF, VEGF and sFlt-1. Furthermore, an imbalance of these factors could lead to a maladaption of the maternal and fetal vasculature parameters during pregnancy. The role of the peptide hormone kisspeptin (Kp) in pregnancy and placentation is poorly understood. In vitro studies on human trophoblast explant cultures have shown that increased concentrations of Kp have an inhibitory effect on trophoblast migration, suggesting its potential role in placentation. Our recent study has shown that chronic administration of exogenous Kp during pregnancy in Sprague-Dawley rats, reduced the depth of spiral artery remodeling and fetal growth. This study provided the first in-vivo evidence of a role for Kp in pregnancy.",

METHODS: Kp receptor (Kiss1R) cDNA with an epitope tag known as \"FLAG\" attached to it was commercially obtained. The tag makes the receptor identifiable by using an antibody specific to the tag. We then created an alternative, constitutively active, version of the cDNA by introducing a previously described mutation (Arg386Pro). The presence of this mutation is anticipated to enhance the effects of receptor overexpression, thereby altering trophoblast function and/or pregnancy outcome. Receptor constructs were then transferred into the lentiviral vector, and stocks were produced using standard methods. DBA/J mice were superovulated using a standard protocol and then mated. Females with copulatory plugs were euthanized on E3.5 and embryos collected by flushing the uterine horns. After removing the zona pellucida, blastocysts were transduced (infected) with lentivirus by culturing them for 24 hours. At E4.5, blastocysts were transferred to pseudopregnant foster dams. On E10.5 the fetus and placenta were collected and snap-frozen for sectioning and staining. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with an antibody to the FLAG tag showed trophoblast-specific expression of Kiss1R in the placenta (but not fetus), demonstrating successful transfection. More embryos are being collected and transferred after transfection in order to study the effects of placental overexpression of Kp on pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: This study utilizes lentivirus for trophoblast-specific transgenic overexpression of the Kiss1R gene. This model will allow us to directly assess the effects of enhanced local Kp signaling on trophoblast endovascular invasion, spiral artery remodeling and fetoplacental development.",

RESULTS: PE conditions are verified in rats after LPS administration by significantly higher blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion, elevated sFlt-1 and decreased PlGF serum levels, and evidence of hepatic dysfunction compared to control groups. PTZ successfully induces seizure activity in all groups studied. Seizure latency is significantly (P<0.01) less in the PE+PTZ group (73.2 \u00b1 6.6 sec.) than in PTZ-treated controls (107.0 \u00b1 7.4 sec.). Pretreatment with MgSO4 prolongs (P<0.05) seizure latency, shortens seizure duration and decreases seizure rates. Significant increases (P<0.05) in the serum levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-1b, decreases (P<0.05) of serum IL-10 in PE and PE+PTZ groups, and decreases in their levels following MgSO4 administration. However, IL-6 levels do not show changes before or after MgSO4 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: PTZ induces an eclampsia-like condition in rat with clinical, biochemical and pharmacological features, and this is comparable to human eclampsia. The change of serum pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines is coincidence with the decrease in seizure threshold, suggesting the presumption of inflammatory roles in the mechanism of preeclampsia and eclampsia.

INTRODUCTION: Mechanisms leading to preeclampsia remain incompletely defined. Autophagy is a conserved process necessary for cell survival under adverse conditions. We evaluated whether sera from women with healthy pregnancies and women with preeclampsia differed in autophagy induction. METHODS: Sera from 20 normotensive pregnant women and 20 women with preeclampsia were incubated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from female donors. After 48 hours the PBMCs were lysed and the intracellular concentration of p62 was determined by ELISA. The p62 concentration is inversely proportional to the extent of autophagy induction. Serum endoglin, interleukin (IL)-13, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-b levels were quantitated by ELISA. RESULTS: Autophagy induction increased with gestational age in sera from normotensive women (p=0.0159) but not in women with preeclampsia. In the presence of an autophagy inducer, the capacity for autophagy induction decreased with gestational age in sera from preeclamptic women (p = 0.0266) but not from controls. Endoglin concentrations increased with gestational age in normotensive women (p = 0.0048) but not in the preeclamptic women and endoglin levels were associated with the extent of autophagy induction only in controls (p = 0.0015). There was no association between autophagy and serum IL-13, IGF-1 or TGF-b levels. CONCLUSIONS: Sera from women with preeclampsia differ from normotensive women by their inability to induce autophagy as a function of gestational age.",

METHODS: Gene expression data of control and preeclamptic placentas were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. Single sample gene set enrichment analysis was performed to generate gene set activation scores. Candidate PE pathways were identified using t-test based screening of 8513 pathways in Molecular Signatures Database v3.1 on three microarray datasets (GSE25906: p<0.01, GSE10588: p<0.001, GSE14722: p<0.005). Concordant pathways in at least two data sets were determined to be more accurate candidates. The pathways were validated using hierarchical clustering (gene cluster 3.0), and were also validated across another data set in silico (GSE30186). The expressions of PE pathway-related genes were investigated in control and preeclamptic placentas using real time PCR (n=10, respectively). The influence of oxidative stress, inflammation, and hypoxia on PE pathway-related genes was examined using immortalized human trophoblast cells (TCL1) treated with or without H 2 O 2 , TNFa, and hypoxia. RESULTS: Integrated analysis of microarray data identified 24 PE pathways. They contained not only well-known pathways in preeclampsia such as NFkB, CDKN1C, and IGFBP1 pathways but also novel pathways including glutathione and GABA (g-aminobutyric acid) receptor pathways, which were suppressed in preeclampsia. The expressions of glutathione synthesis gene, GCLC and GCLM, and GABRA3 (GABA receptor a3 subunit) were decreased in the preeclamptic placentas (Mann-Whitney test, GCLC; p=0.0029, GCLM; p=0.0005, GABRA3; p=0.0021, respectively). The expression levels of GCLC and GCLM in TCL1 were significantly augmented by H 2 O 2 or TNFa (p=0.0162 and p=0.0066, respectively). In contrast, hypoxia decreased GCLM expression (p=0.0088), suggesting that defense mechanism against oxidative stress and inflammation may be compromised by hypoxia in preeclamptic placentas. CONCLUSIONS: Integrative genomic analysis of preeclampsia identified glutathione and GABA receptor pathways as possible novel therapeutic targets of preeclampsia.",

UA Kayisli, 1 N Ocak, 1 A Uyar, 2 O Guzeloglu-Kayisli, 1 M Basar, 1 J Huang, 1 F Schatz, 1 CJ Lockwood. 1 1 Dept of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ohio State University, College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA; 2 Computer Engineering, Okan Univ., Istanbul, Turkey. INTRODUCTION: Receptor bound interleukin-11 (IL11/IL-11R) and IL6/IL6R competes for binding to gp130 to mediate signaling in target cells. While IL11 is crucial to maintain pregnancy, plasma and decidual cell (DC) IL6 level is elevated in preeclampsia (PE) and chorioamnionitis (CAM). Macrophages (MF) expressing gp130, IL6R and IL11R, exist as distinct subsets, pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) forms. We hypothesize that perturbed IL6 and/or IL11 secretion from DCs induces PE and CAM-associated inflammation by promoting M1 polarization. METHODS: Human MFs were isolated from human peripheral blood of healthy donors (n=3) by density gradient centrifugation and purified by anti-CD14 magnetic beads. Microarray analysis was performed on RNA extracts from MFs treated with control, or 1ng/ml of IL11 or IL6 or IL11+IL6 for 4h using an Illumina Human microarray kit. Statistical analysis was limited to genes expressed at 1.5-fold above threshold. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) assessed signaling cascades. RT-PCR was performed to confirm microarray results. RESULTS: In IL11-treated MF vs. controls, 71 genes are differentially expressed (38 up-and 33 down-regulated); the resulting profile represented the M2 phenotype. In contrast, 63 genes are differentially expressed in IL6-treated MFs vs controls (27 up-and 36 down-regulated) producing a gene spectrum consistent with the M1 phenotype. After incubation of MFs with IL11+IL6, 106 genes are differentially expressed vs IL11 alone (48 up-and 58 down-regulated) representing a shift from an M2 to an M1 phenotype. No differences in expressed genes were found in MFs treated with IL11+IL6 vs IL-6 alone. Analysis of upstream regulatory signaling by IPA reveals that STAT4 and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling activation and STAT5 signaling inhibition are associated with IL6-mediated MF differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: IL6 redirects gene expression of IL11 stimulated MFs away from M2 towards M1. Such IL-6 dominance would promote decidual inflammation associated with PE and CAM. Molecules inhibiting ERK1/2 and STAT4 and/or activating STAT5 could block M2/M1 MF transition representing potential targets to prevent pregnancy related inflammation.",

INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia (PE) and IUGR are associated with endothelial (EC) dysfunction. We recently discovered a direct link between increased EC permeability and generation of vascular tone mediated by sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid, produced by sphingosine kinase (SK). S1P exported out of cells by ABC-type transporters binds to S1P 1 enhancing EC barrier, but also disrupts it at high ligand levels via S1P 3 receptors. Thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a vasoconstrictor is increased in PE. TXA2 increases S1P, but whether TXA2 utilizes S1P to increase EC permeability and vascular tone is unknown. HYPOTHESIS: Infusion of TXA2 into arteries will activate SK increasing S1P. By engaging S1P 3 , S1P will overcome signals generated via S1P 1 to increase permeability, allowing TXA2 leakage to the underlying vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) increasing vascular tone. METHODS: A novel method, using pressure myography, was used to simultaneously assess EC permeability (Relative fluorescence units) and vascular tone in uterine arteries from young female mice. TXA2 mimetic, U46619 (1-20nM), was infused inside arteries with or without inhibitors to SK (1\u00b5M SK-II) or ABC transporters (10\u00b5M MK571, 1\u00b5M F9054), S1P 1/3 antagonist (1\u00b5M VPC23019) or S1P 1 agonist (0.1\u00b5M SEW2871). Vascular tone was compared to that induced by adding drugs to the vessel bath to directly affect VSMC. RESULTS: Infused U46619 (20nM) increased EC permeability (1.0\u00b10.2) compared to control (0.6\u00b10.7) or lower U46619 doses. U46619-induced permeability was unchanged by co-infused inhibitors but was fully prevented by SEW2871 (0.65\u00b10.08). Notably, permeability to singly infused SK-II (1.58\u00b10.37), MK571 (1.05\u00b10.28) or F9054 (1.59\u00b10.67) was increased, suggesting endogenous S1P promotes EC barrier. Infused U46619 (20nM) also increased vascular tone (50.2\u00b111.6%) that was inhibited by SK-II (6.2\u00b15.5%), MK571 (10.4\u00b12.1%), F9054 (11.4\u00b15.4%) and SEW2871 (8.8\u00b14.8%). Overall, the results suggest that U46619induced permeability could permit its own leakage to VSMC increasing vascular tone; and that vascular tone, but not permeability, is mediated via the S1P pathway. CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time, a previously undescribed mechanism whereby a TXA2 mimetic increases vascular tone by modulating the S1P pathway. Access of U46619 to the VSMC to increase vascular tone likely involves EC leakage of U46619. Targeting the S1P pathway could be invaluable in finding therapeutic solutions against pregnancy-related disorders such as PE or IUGR. Supported by CIHR, NSERC and WCHRI.

Measurements of uterine artery mean pulsatility index (PI), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), central systolic blood pressure (SBPao) and angiogenic markers (placental growth factor and soluble form of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) were taken every four weeks until delivery, and compared between pregnancies that developed preterm-PE, term-PE and GH and those that remained normotensive. X 2 -test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney test with post-hoc Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons and regression analysis were used for comparison between the groups and identification of potential confounders. Analysis of repeated measures with multilevel mixed-effects linear model (fixed effects and random effects) was performed. RESULTS: A total of 1198 observations were recorded in 245 women (181 women had a normal outcome, 20 developed GH, 22 term-PE, and 22 preterm-PE). In the normotensive group PI decreased with gestational age (GA) and MAP decreased between 12 and 24 weeks, then increased again. In preterm-PE, compared to the normal group, PI and MAP were higher from early pregnancy and the difference for both increased with GA. In term-PE, PI was significantly increased only from 33 weeks onwards and MAP was increased from 12 weeks but the difference from normal did not increase with gestation. In GH, PI was not significantly different from normal but MAP was higher from 12 weeks. In the GH and preterm-PE groups, SBPao was significantly higher than in the normotensive group, and this difference remained constant throughout pregnancy. In the preterm-PE group, PWV was significantly higher than in the normotensive group from 16 weeks.

Gestation corrected hyperuricemia (GCH) was defined as being one standard deviation above the gestation-specific mean . And we used uric acid z-scores ([serum uric acid value -gestation specific mean] / standard deviation of the population) to account for gestation-specific alterations in uric acid and tested this as a continuous variable. Linear regression RESULTS: A2aR and HIF1a were localised to syncytiotrophobasts and cytotrophoblasts and positively correlated through pregnancy (r=0.85; P<0.0001). Expression of both proteins was highest in Early TOP, decreasing to term but higher in PE (A2aR [median 13.4, HIF1a [11.15, ]) than NC (A2aR [median 3.32, IQR 2. HIF1a [4.5, ]) (P<0.0001 for all). A positive correlation between A2aR and AT4R was observed in all TOP placentae (r=0.58; P=0.016) but not in term NC or PE. A2aR was not associated with AT1R or AT2R (P>0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Placentation occurs in a hypoxic environment. Hypoxia is known to stimulate adenosine, which functions to promote angiogenesis, proliferation, inflammation and protection against oxidative stress. As AngIV acting through AT4R has similar effects and there appears to be an association between A2aR and AT4R in early pregnancy, it is possible that these receptors may have a role in placentation and their dysregulation may contribute to PE. The possible effect of corticosteroids on pregnancy outcome in HELLP syndrome has been grounds for discussion for the last 30 years. The therapeutic concept of high-dose prednisolone has been introduced to our department in 2005. Until 2013 patients with HELLP syndrome received one to three doses before delivery.",

RESULTS: Uric acid is transported across a BeWo choriocarcinoma cell monolayer with 530 pmol/min. We could successfully overexpress and for the first time purify the GLUT9b isoform using the Xenopus laevis oocytes expression system. Chloride seems to modulate the urate transport system. TEM revealed that GLUT9b isoform is present as monomer and dimmer in the Xenopus laevis overexpression model. A class average of all the particles allowed us to develop a first model of human GLUT9b structure, which was derived from the published crystal structure of the bacterial homologue of GLUT1-4. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro the \"materno-fetal\" transport of uric acid is slow indicating that in vivo the fetus might be protected from short-term fluctuations of maternal urate serum levels. The low-resolution structure obtained from TEM validates the proposed homology model regarding the structure of human GLUT9b.

Lack of immunogenetic diversity appears to be a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia (PE), and both epidemiologic and laboratory data suggest that immune dysfunction contributes to PE pathophysiology. We sought to examine maternal and child human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class II relationships in PE compared with normal pregnancy, hypothesizing increased HLA compatibility in PE pregnancies. METHODS: DNA was isolated from blood or buccal swab samples from mother/child pairs. HLA typing for the Class II loci DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1 was performed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequence specific oligonucleotide probe technique. Maternal and child HLA relationships were examined to determine low-resolution compatibility, considering both bidirectional compatibility and unidirectional compatibility which can occur in the setting of maternal or child homozygosity. Chi square was used for analysis. RESULTS: Results are summarized below. HLA Class II compatibility did not differ between mother/child pairs with (n=110) and without (n=108) PE. Recently we showed in P-UAECs, that both cAMP and cGMP augment GJ function/assembly associated with the phosphorylation of PKA-dependent Cx43 Ser365 as well as endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) Ser635. Therefore we hypothesized that in response to ATP stimulation, which increases PGI 2 and NO production, phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors specific to cAMP and cGMP will differentially modulate the stimulatory phosphorylation state of Cx43 and eNOS. METHODS: P-UAECs from pregnant sheep were pretreated with either vehicle, Isogladine maleate (PDE4 inhibitor; 1umol/L) or Sildenafil (PDE5 inhibitor; 100nmol/L) followed by treatment with vehicle, ATP (100 umol/L) or Forskolin (100umol/L; the positive control for cAMP production). The production of cAMP and cGMP were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the stimulatory phosphorylation state Cx43 and eNOS phosphorylation were evaluated by Western Immunoblotting.",

Specificity was shown since Forskolin substantially elevated cAMP (P<0.01), but not cGMP. ATP and Forskolin both elevated the PKA dependent stimulatory phosphorylation site of Cx43, but this was only augmented in the presence of the PDE4 (P<0.05) not PDE5 inhibitor. By contrast weak stimulatory site phosphorylation of eNOS was seen in response to both ATP and Forskolin alone, but the ATP response was greatly augmented in the presence of PDE5 inhibitor (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Stimulatory responses to the physiologic agonist ATP are differentially altered by endogenous PDEs specific to cAMP and cGMP via modulation of the stimulatory phosphorylation state of Cx43 and eNOS. Thus increased pregnancy-enhanced GJ communication between cells is mediated by cAMP more so than cGMP in response to ATP to enhance uterine vasodilation. NIH GM083252, HL49210, HD38843, HL87144, R25GM0832. Values below 85 were considered as normal. Single measurements were performed for sFlt-1 and PlGF on the fully automated Roche Elecsys system. RESULTS: All women were treated according to international guidelines. We observed adverse obstetric outcome despite therapy in eight women with APS and in two women with SLE. Pregnancy complications consisted of early-onset preeclampsia, HELLP-Syndrome, Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and lupus flare in early pregnancy. Four women developed Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS), which was treated successfully in three cases with Plasmapheresis. Serum samples from 18 pregnancies in 18 women with APS and SLE were analyzed.Sflt-1/ PlGF ratio remained < 85 in pregnancies without complications. In those pregnancies complicated by CAPS, HELLP-Syndrome and preeclampsia, sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was > 85. Additionally sFlt-1 and PlGF values were measured before and after plasmapheresis in 3 cases with CAPS with a significant decrease of sFlt-1 and plgf. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a 31% rate of adverse obstetric outcome despite intensive management, which is consistent with literature.The sFlt-1/plGF ratio was increased in women with APS who developed CAPS and/or IUGR, but not in women with APS without adverse pregnancy outcome.Our findings suggest a possibility to use the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio as an additional predictive parameter for CAPS. But further prospective studies with larger numbers are in progress to clarify the potential role of the ratio in the diagnostic algorithm of Preeclampsia, HELLP-Syndrome and CAPS. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction is a pathogenic mediator of oxidative stress in pre-eclampsia. The health of mitochondria is in part mediated by their biogenesis; the inducible transcriptional co-activator peroxisome proliferator activated receptor g co-activator 1-a (PGC-1a) is a well characterised pleiotropic orchestrator of a broad range of genetic programs, including mitochondrial biogenesis, angiogenesis and a multifaceted antioxidant defense system. Aim: To determine the link between PGC-1a, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in pre-eclampsia. METHODS: RUPP (N=10) and control sham rats (N=10) was used in our study. Localisation of PGC-1a expression and mitochondrial specific ROS production was determined by fluorescent microscopy in placental samples in both study groups. The antioxidant profile was measured by real-time PCR, while markers of cellular senescence and telomere shortening were assessed by real-time PCR and immunoblotting. RESULTS: PGC-1a expression was localised to both endothelial cells, cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts in placental samples with evidence of reduced expression in the RUPP animals. We showed elevated production of mitochondrial specific reactive oxygen species in RUPP animals. Mitochondrial specific ROS co-localised to PGC-1a in both endothelial and trophoblast cells in both study groups with evidence of reduced PGC-1a activity leading to increased production of mitochondrial specific ROS. The expression of antioxidants including SOD2 and mitochondrial uncoupling proteins UCP-1 and UCP-2 were reduced in the RUPP study group. Mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysfunction are intrinsically linked with cellular senescence. Additional analysis revealed increased expression of cellular senescence markers including checkpoint kinase 2 and p16 INK4 in the RUPP study group. Furthermore, telomere shortening is a feature of cellular senescence, we confirmed an increase in expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase and teleomere repeat-binding factors 2 in the RUPP study group. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in PGC-1a activity is intrinsically linked to dysregulaton of mitochondrial function with subsequent induction of oxidative stress in pre-clampsia. Early diagnosis of pre-eclampsia allows appropriate monitoring and targeting of therapeutic strategies, but is challenging in women with pre-existing hypertension and/or proteinuria. The aim of this study was to establish a distinctive urinary proteome profile which is diagnostic of pre-eclampsia in both low and high risk women. METHODS: A proteome profile for urine samples from women with pre-eclampsia (PE) and gestation-matched healthy pregnant controls was created, using a validated workflow, involving selective immunodepletion, 1D SDS-PAGE gel fractionation, in-gel digestion of gel sections, LC-MS/ MS analysis, spectral analysis. Candidate peptides were selected and quantified by Selective Reaction Monitoring (SRM) in a larger challenge cohort including women with PE/superimposed PE (PE/SPE), gestational hypertension (GH), healthy controls (C) and women with chronic hypertension (CHT) or kidney disease (CKD). Each sample was prepared to a standardised total protein concentration.",

We hypothesized that TS would increase vasodilation, thereby reducing the signs of preeclampsia in a RUPP model. METHODS: On d14 of pregnancy in Sprague Dawley rats, uteroplacental blood flow was reduced via clips inserted on the abdominal aorta and uterine arteries. Sham surgeries were performed as controls. Both groups were treated with a water soluble TS compound (STS) in their drinking water (approx. 27mg/kg/day) from surgery onwards. On d20 (term d22), blood pressure was measured, animals were euthanized, litter biometrics measured and ex vivo vascular function was assessed. RESULTS: RUPP surgery caused a significant increase in diastolic (79\u00b14 mmHg Sham vs. 92\u00b12 mmHg RUPP, p<0.001) and systolic (109\u00b13 mmHg Sham vs. 124\u00b14 mmHg RUPP, p<0.001) blood pressure, a reduction in pup weight (4.03\u00b10.07g Sham vs. 3.47\u00b10.15g RUPP, p<0.01) and placental weight (0.49\u00b10.01g Sham vs. 0.44\u00b10.04g RUPP, p<0.05); measures that were not affected by STS treatment. STS reduced vascular oxidative stress (decreased superoxide and peroxynitrite, p<0.05) in RUPP. However, oxidized LDL caused a reduction in vasodilation in RUPP that appeared to be worsened by STS; potentially due to an upregulation of the lectin-like, oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) (p<0.05). Conversely, STS decreased the involvement of the platelet-activating factor receptor (PAF-R; another receptor that is activated by oxidized LDL). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypothesis, STS treatment of the RUPP model of preeclampsia did not improve the mechanisms of vasodilation and may increase the detrimental effects of the LOX-1 receptor pathway. These effects may be offset by a decreased involvement of the PAF-R. In this model, STS did not prove to be beneficial for pregnancy outcomes.",

This study aimed to determine whether there is a mechanistic link between oxidative stress and the shedding of tissue factor expressing trophoblast microvesicles. METHODS: Term human chorionic villi explants were cultured under normoxia (8% O 2 for 24 and 48 hours), hypoxia (0.2% O 2 for 24 hours) or hypoxia-reoxygenation (0.2% O 2 for 24 hours followed by 8% O 2 for 24 hours). Culture supernatant was collected and flow cytometry was performed to quantify tissue factor expressing microvesicles. RESULTS: There was no difference in the number of shed microvesicles between chorionic villi explants cultured under both normoxia and hypoxia. Chorionic villi explants cultured under hypoxia-reoxygenation shed more tissue factor expressing microvesicles than those cultured under normoxic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that placental oxidative stress, a condition characteristic of preeclampsia, may induce shedding of tissue factor expressing microvesicles from trophoblast cells, likely contributing to a maternal hypercoagulable state.",

VEGF and/or mCherry expression were induced on days 6-9, 9-12, 12-18, and 17-18 of pregnancy, and samples were collected on day 18. RESULTS: VEGF overexpression on days 6-9 and 9-12 led to significant decrease in fetal size, increase in placental size, and severe disorganization of labyrinth vessels with focal hemorrhages, dilation of vessels and fibrin deposition on the walls. There was also a dramatic expansion and invagination of the spongiotrophoblast layer into the labyrinth. VEGF overexpression on days 12-18 resulted in significant increase in the rate of fetal absorption and extensive placental hemorrhages, but overexpression on days 17-18 had no marked effect. Surprisingly, several dams in all treatment groups, except those from days 17-18, showed significant increases in blood pressure and placental and serum levels of sFlt1, and proteinuria and focal glomerular endotheliosis in the kidney, all typical signs of PE in women. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that placental development at early stages of pregnancy is more susceptible to excess local VEGF and that fully mature placentas, after day 17, are relatively resistant. Most importantly, our results for the first time suggest that transient increase in placental VEGF at early stages of pregnancy may induce placental sFlt1 production and maternal symptoms of PE at later stages, implicating excess local VEGF production in the pathogenesis of PE. These findings have significant implications for current efforts to develop VEGF-based therapies for neutralization of excess circulating sFlt1 in PE. Thus an individualized medicine approach to PE may lead to better treatment outcomes and new developments. We hypothesize that PE is a multi-factorial syndrome and that this will be represented as differences in cell signalling. Furthermore, heparin can act as a signalling cofactor, and therefore treatment of PE with heparin may modulate the signalling environment of the placenta and be beneficial to some patients.",

To assess signalling, phospho-peptide antibody arrays were conducted on samples from 32 preterm deliveries, from patients with or without PE and/or chronic hypertension, to identify signifi cant changes in downstream signalling events. As an in vitro model, fi rst trimester placentas were cultured in serum from PE women and assessed for differences in phospho-tyrosine signalling compared to healthy pregnancy serum and no serum controls. RESULTS: Model based clustering analysis of PE placental pathologies revealed three molecular subclasses with distinct signalling events driving their classifi cation, including phosphorylation of FGFR and Stat in one group and MAPK (ERK1/2) and Akt/PKB in another group. One cluster was enriched in pathology samples while other clusters were mixtures of pathologies and controls. Treatment of placental explants with PE serum resulted in intracellular signalling excitation relative to controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results confi rm that subclasses of PE patients demonstrate differences in downstream cell signalling. Future experiments include microarray/proteomic analysis of in vivo/in vitro PE placenta samples with or without heparin to determine changes in gene expression concurrent with altered cell signalling.

Neither the chr19 nor the chr14 miRNAs were detected in the samples from non-pregnant subjects. Interestingly, many miRNAs that were present at higher levels in the pregnant samples compared to the non-pregnant samples were not placenta-specifi c miRNAs.

Moreover, some, but not all pregnancy-associated miRNAs originate from the placenta. Our fi ndings suggest that both placental and non-placental miRNAs may serve as biomarkers for prediction of placental dysfunction.

Our objective was to investigate if prenatal care providers' perceptions and training in smoking cessation counseling and personal tobacco use are predictive of their counseling efforts with pregnant smokers in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. METHODS: Cross-sectional study. Anonymous surveys emailed to 136 physicians who provide prenatal care at 3 academic centers and 1 public health center in Medell\u00edn. Physician smoking, training in cessation, and perceptions about pregnant smokers was compared with provision of smoking cessation counseling. A convenience sample of 59 pregnant patients were surveyed in person to assess rates of smoking, counseling received, and perceptions about smoking in pregnancy. RESULTS: 48 physicians completed the survey. 51.1% had smoked and 18.8% smoked in the last month. Most physicians (91%) always counsel pregnant patients who smoke to quit. Most (89%) had never been trained in a specific intervention for tobacco cessation counseling in pregnancy and 40.4% reported rarely or never using an established method. The best predictor for always counseling patients to quit smoking was the frequency of asking patients if they smoke (Fisher's exact test p=0.01). All providers who did not always counsel smoked but statistical power was limited by sample size. Of patients surveyed 13.8% smoked during pregnancy while 53.9% believed that half or more of pregnant women smoke and 47.5% felt few or no women quit during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Most physicians report counseling pregnant smokers to quit but few have training in or use an evidence based method. Smoking prevalence by self-reporting in these pregnant patients was higher than previous estimates. Routine screening with biological markers for tobacco exposure in pregnancy could be considered to identify all smokers in pregnancy. Smoking prevalence in physicians remains high and efforts to help providers quit should be a focus. Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity worldwide. Puerto Rico has the highest rate of preterm births of all US jurisdictions and has undergone one of the largest global shifts in preterm birth rate in recent history, increasing from 11% in 1994 to 18% of all singleton births in 2009.The aim of this study was to describe trends in the overall distribution of gestational age between 1994-2009 in Puerto Rico, compare these trends to the U.S. mainland, and assess the contribution of known clinical risk factors. METHODS: We used US and territorial data from the National Center for Health Statistics for the years 1994-2009 to examine overall distributions of gestational length, rates of selected maternal risk factors and delivery characteristics. Analysis was limited to those singletons born at 20 to 42 completed weeks of gestational age to either US or Puerto Rican resident mothers. Exclusion of data which had birth weights inconsistent with gestational age was performed according to criteria published by Alexander et al.",

While preterm births (<37 weeks) increased overall from 1994 to 2009 these rates did not appreciably change for infants born <34 weeks (2.8% in 1994 and 3.4% in 2009). Maternal risk factors, including but not limited to, hypertension and use of assisted reproductive technology and delivery characteristics, such as c-section and induction rate, did not dramatically alter gestational age distributions for Puerto Rico. CONCLUSIONS: Observations suggest a changing pattern towards births at late preterm/early term gestation and most notably for infants born between 34-38 weeks.

RESULTS: 108 infertile and 103 pregnant women of similar age and income participated, with mean age 28.6\u00b15.5y. 48% of subjects listed a modern contraceptive, most commonly Depo-Provera, among the three most common causes of infertility.

CONCLUSIONS: Many women listed a modern contraceptive among the three most common causes of infertility, a community perception that may contribute to low contraceptive utilization. Women obtaining basic infertility evaluations were less likely to associate contraceptives with infertility, possibly due to the consultation improving understanding of reproductive physiology. Access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare, including infertility evaluation and counseling, may increase contraceptive uptake by decreasing misperceptions about contraceptives and fertility.",

Jacob Rotmensch, 1 Liaohai Chen. 2 1 Gynecologic Oncology, Rush University Medical Center, USA; 2 Department of Chemistry, Utah State University, USA. INTRODUCTION: There are several barriers in setting up cytology based screening programs for cervical cancer in developing countries. Methods for interpretation of cervical cytology is based on automated staining and computer assisted scanning system not present in many developing countries. Problems often encountered are limited resources, lack of a cytology laboratory, and limited patient finances preventing follow-up visits. The absence of the ability to immediately interpret cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer by a rapid assay is a major hurdle for an effective cervical screening program in these low-resource environments. Hypothesis: Development of a rapid bioassay based on colorimetric analysis to detect cervical dysplasia or neoplasia not dependent upon sophisticated instrumentation or lengthy steps. METHODS: An acid autocatalytic reaction is used to achieve a litmuslike color change within a few minutes when cervical dysplasia or cancer is present. Hemalum is added to a solution containing cervical cells. An autocatalytic reaction is produced causing a color change if dysplastic cells are present. In this study, cervical cytology cells are stained with Lillie Mayer hemalum. Approximately 20 cells per sample are needed to trigger the autocatalytic reaction after washing the cells with water and incubating them with autocatalytic acid precursors. The presence of cervical dysplasia or cancer cells changes the solution from yellow to red. RESULTS: After one minute of incubation the solution containing dysplastic cells changes color from yellow to red. In control samples containing no dysplastic cells the solution remained yellow indicating no autocatalytic reaction occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The hemalum assay developed is a simple colorimetric test that directly detects the presence of cervical dysplastic cells without the presence of sophisticated instrumentation or microscopy. This assay enables various levels of health care providers to immediately determine if therapy is required. States Air Force (USAF) obstetrician and gynecologist (OB/GYN) noted that something as simple as a pelvic examination was nearly impossible without having to compromise patient comfort, safety or both. Field stretchers are a wonderful tool for transporting patients, but they are not ideal for examinations, surgery or as a hospital bed. Unfortunately, this is exactly what they are used for during disaster relief, humanitarian missions or during military deployments but they do not have the ability to achieve low or high lithotomy positioning for pelvic examinations, surgery or childbirth. Additional personnel, straps, or other improvised methods are typically used to hold up the patient's legs. Recent military conflicts have also revealed that military trauma surgeons did not have adequate access or exposure to the pelvis/perineum while treating patients with improvised explosive device blast injuries. METHODS: Greene Stirrups (USAF Patent Pending-2013) were developed as a portable attachment to field stretchers for low and high lithotomy positioning under austere conditions. A prospective randomized control trial was used to test the prototype for Greene Stirrups during a humanitarian mission to Trinidad, 7-12 April 2011. This new team was recently developed to provide rapid deployment of medical assets anywhere in the world within 24 hours with a functional field hospital ready to receive patients 6 hours after arrival. Every fourth female patient was assigned a traditional examination under field conditions with the others examined using Greene Stirrups. Validated patient satisfaction questionnaires (Short-Form 12) were used to assess patient satisfaction with frequencies of high and low responses and the medians compared using the Cox-Mantel Log-Rank Test, Chi 2 and Fisher's Exact Tests. RESULTS: 82 patients were examined and treated using Greene Stirrups and 27 patients were randomized to have their pelvic examinations performed using traditional field medicine methods by the same OB/GYN provider. The SF-12s indicated very high or high patient satisfaction for 98.8% of patients that used Greene Stirrups vs. 63.0% that used traditional field methods (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Greene Stirrups allow for safe and comfortable examinations of patients who require low or high lithotomy positioning in austere conditions. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and pain and infertility are the major symptoms, with a negative impact on women's quality of life especially on psychosocial functioning. The present study investigated the perceived stress in a group of women with endometriosis, before and after the diagnosis of the disease. METHODS: A 40 item questionnaire was administered to a group of women with endometriosis (n=251) before and after the diagnosis. In 90% (226/251) patients had at least one surgical treatment. The median age at endometriosis diagnosis was 28.8 years and the median age at the first surgery was 29.4 years. The questionnaire was divided in two different parts: the former was about clinical history, characteristics of menstrual cycles and painful symptoms; the latter focused on global measure on perceived stress both before and after the diagnosis of endometriosis. The \"Perceived Stress Scale\" (PSS10) was used and four different levels of stress were categorized. RESULTS: Based on four different PSS10 score intervals, all patients showed a perceived stress which in 39% (98/251) resulted at the highest levels (p<0.001); no statistically significant difference was found between before and after diagnosis in any of the four groups. Mood disorders affected 18.72% (47/251) of patients and the median level of PSS10 this group was found significantly higher than in the other patients (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Endometriosis is a stressful disease, and this is well clear since before obtaining a surgical diagnosis. Medical or surgical treatment do not affect stress levels, while mood disorders are associated with an increased perceived stress.",

John F Langenheim, 1 Karenne N Fru, 2 Eli V Hestermann, 3 Jung Yoon Yoo, 4 Jae Wook Jeong, 4 Lingwen Yuan, 5 Steven L Young, 5 Bruce A Lessey. An increased prevalence of endometriosis over the past 20 years has been proposed to be the result of environmental factors. Dioxin or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has been implicated in endometrial dysfunction and endometriosis pathogenesis. The primary TCDD receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and its dimerization partner, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) mediate many of its biological effects. In this study we compare the spatial and temporal expression pattern of AhR, ARNT, and downstream targets in the endometrium of normal women versus those with endometriosis. METHODS: AHR was detected in endometrium in women with and without endometriosis, using immunohistochemistry (IHC), real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blot. Expression of AhR/ARNT-regulated genes, CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and AhRR, were also measured by qRT-PCR. Effects of estrogen, progesterone, cytokines and TCDD were studied in vitro using Ishikawa cells. The effect of decidualization was studied in cultures of isolated human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs)from normal women and women with endometriosis. We used 1 nM TCDD treatment to study AhR and ARNT expression and an AhR antagonist. RESULTS: AhR, but not ARNT was cycle-regulated, with maximal expression during the mid-secretory phase. Increased expression of AhR, ARNT, CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and AhRR was seen in the midsecretory endometrium of women with endometriosis versus controls. AhR protein was elevated in extracts of whole endometrium and ESCs of women with endometriosis compared to controls. Although down-regulated with All diaphragmatic lesions are superficial.

Variants of the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) gene have been associated with risk for extreme obesity and diabetes. The objectives of this investigation were to determine NPCI gene allele frequencies in our obstetric population and to evaluate whether those allele variants were associated with maternal obesity or diabetes. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study involving 567 gravid patients admitted for delivery. Blood specimens were obtained at admission and umbilical cord at delivery for NPC1 genotype analyses and HbA1c determination. Regression analyses evaluated any associations between the NPC1 ancestral and derived gene alleles and race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), pre-existing diabetes, serum HbA1c level before labor, and large-for-gestational age infants. RESULTS: Frequencies of NPC1 gene ancestral alleles were significantly different and in complete linkage disequilibrium among race/ethnic groups.",

At the end of the experiment (4 weeks) tumors were collected and evaluated for histological analyses. RESULTS: We found that paricalcitol dramatically reduce the volume and weight of the tumors in comparison with vitamin D at 4 weeks. The expression of proliferative marker Ki67 and apoptotic marker caspase 3 protein were greatly increased and reduced respectively. No toxicity was observed due to treatment by histological analyses on the tasted organs. CONCLUSIONS: Paricalcitol in comparison with vitamin D effectively inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in fibroid tumor lesions in vivo.

METHODS: Cases were collected from our prospectively-maintained computerized database of robotic-assisted (RALS) and conventional laparoscopic surgical (CLS) treatments for endometriosis. Included were all patients treated between July 2009 and October 2012 for endometriosis stage III or IV (ASRM). A questionnaire composed of questions ranging from assessing post operative pain to subsequent medical or surgical treatment, followed by future pregnancies was distributed to all patients at least six months after their surgery and was compared between the groups. Patients were also divided into sub-groups of those who had hysterectomy and those who did not. A Chi-square test was used to compare presence of long term outcomes between CLS and RALS groups.

The overall QPCQ had excellent internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha=0.97) as did each of the six subscales (Cronbach's alpha=0.69-0.95). Preliminary analyses suggest that these psychometric properties remain stable for the French language and Australian versions of the QPCQ.

The molecular basis of this response is poorly understood but appears to be central to implantation/placentation. This study aimed to characterise the endometrial epithelium and stroma-specific global gene expression patterns in response to semen exposure in the days leading up to implantation. METHODS: Naturally mated female CD1 mice were culled at 24, 48, 72 and 96h post coitum (each n=3). Uterine horns were snap frozen in optimal cutting compound in liquid nitrogen and cryosectioned. Sections were stained with cresyl violet, and pure endometrial epithelium and stroma were obtained by laser capture microdissection. RNA was extracted, labelled and hybridised to Agilent one colour genome-wide gene expression microarrays. Data were analysed using Genespring. RESULTS: 46 pathways were significantly active in the murine post coital endometrium, 8 immune-related: prostaglandin synthesis/regulation, cytokines/inflammatory response, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), macrophage markers, oxidative stress (P<0.01) and TGF-b signalling (P<0.05). Several immune mediator genes were differentially expressed across epithelium, stroma and the post coital period. Csf2 was more highly expressed in stroma than epithelium at 24h, a relationship which was reversed 96h post coitum. Csf1 showed higher epithelial expression at 24 and 96h. With the exception of the 96h time point, Ccl2 was more highly expressed in stroma with marked peaks at 24 and 48h. Ccl5 peaked in stromal expression at 48h with a subsequent decrease at 72 and 96h. Tnf peaked in stroma at 24 and 48h, while epithelial expression peaked at 24h. Il15 epithelial expression rose at oestrus while stromal profiles were maximal at 24, 48 and 96h. Tgfb1 was consistently more highly expressed in stroma, with an increase in expression at all time points post coitum. Mmp1a, Mmp8 and Mmp13 were also more highly expressed in stroma, with peaks in expression at 24 and 48h. CONCLUSIONS: The multiple immune-related pathways active in the murine endometrium post coitum are epithelium/stroma-specific and change over time, suggesting that immune networks are intimately involved in regulating the maternal response to seminal plasma and priming the endometrium for blastocyst implantation. Cognitive biases to emotional information are common in psychiatric disorders in women; yet, the impact of sex hormones on cognition has not been studied. The menstrual cycle offers an opportunity to study whether and how subtle fluctuations of sex hormones influence neuronal circuits implicated in cognitive regulation of emotional processing. Attention performance is considered a model for cognitive functions. With the introduction of sensitive tests it is now possible to analyze attention performance in women by their menstrual cycle phase. METHODS: Attention performance was studied using a newly developed, internet based, 18 minute long, highly sensitive, validated version of a computerized performance test (CPT), evaluating four parameters: Attention, Timing, Impulsivity, and Hyperactivity. The patient was instructed to respond quickly to target stimuli and to avoid responding to all other stimuli. Attention is defined as the number of correct responses to a stimulus. Timing includes the number of correct responses only while the target stimulus was still on screen. Impulsivity is defined as the number of commission errors, responses to a non-target stimulus. Hyperactivity includes all types of commission responses that are not coded as impulsive responses, such as multiple responses to a single stimulus. The study group included 6 healthy regularly cycling women and 7 age-matched healthy men. Each participant performed CPT three times. The women performed the test twice on day 9-11 of the cycle and a 3 rd test on day 19-21. Full hormonal profile confirmed cycle phase. Men were tested likewise 10 days apart. RESULTS: Women had comparable attention yet significantly lower timing, impulsivity, and hyperactivity scores than men at both dates. Cycling women showed significantly higher attention (267.4 vs. 271.5, p=0 .04) and lower hyperactive (3.3 vs. 1.3, p=0.04 ) scores at the luteal phase, whereas men achieved comparable scores without statistical difference at both dates on the four cognitive parameters studied. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike men, cognitive performance in women varies throughout the menstrual cycle. In the luteal phase women experience significantly improved attention performance and decreased hyperactivity responses. When studying cognition in women, menstrual cycle phase and hormonal status should be taken into account.",

We therefore hypothesized a conditional knockdown of Tregs in a murine model will lead to reduced litter size secondary to uterine implantation defect. METHODS: Conditional knockdown of Tregs was induced using a transgenic mouse (DEREG) that express a DTR-eGFP transgene under the control of an additional Foxp3 promoter. Specific depletion of Treg was performed by intra-peritoneal (IP) injections of diphtheria toxin (DT). Peripheral blood and uterine tissue levels were analyzed for Treg depletion via flow cytometer analysis of FoxP3 expression. Wild type (WT) and DEREG mice were given IP injections of saline or DT prior to mating. Early murine ultrasound (e+7-10 days) was performed to count implanted gestational sacs and compared to delivered pups to assess any effects on embryo reabsorption. RESULTS: DEREG mice (n=7) given DT (cohort 4) demonstrated decreased litter sizes (4.57 pups/litter) compared to DEREG mice (n=7) given saline (cohort 3) (7.5 pups); WT mice (n=8) given saline (cohort 1) (7.58 pups); or WT mice (n=12) given DT (cohort 2) (7.29 pups) (P=0.02) (Figure 1) of clinically recognized pregnancies.

However, its effects on the embryo are unclear. There has been no systemic or mechanistic evaluation of its protective effects. Thus, this study will test the hypothesis that JLFC01 treats SA by modulating the decidual microenvironment. METHODS: Frozen decidua from elective terminations and from women with missed or incomplete SA during 5 to 8 wk of gestation were immunostained with human anti-CD68 + anti-CD80 or -CD86 (M1 macrophage (MF) markers) or -CD163 (M2 MF marker) antibodies. First trimester decidual cells (FTDCs) were primed with estradiol (10 -8 M) + medroxyprogesterone acetate (10 -7 M) for 7d followed by pretreatment \u00b1 JLFC01 for 24h before adding 1 ng/ml of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). Expression of IL-8, GM-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, RANTES, and M-CSF was measured by the multiplex Luminex assay. MF subtypes were determined after developing peripheral monocytes in conditioned media (CM) from TNF-a-or IL-1b-treated FTDCs. Eight-week-old virgin female CBA/J mice were treated with JLFC01 (0.3 gm/kg in ddH 2 O/day) or ddH 2 O by oral gavage started 7d before mating with 10-week-old DBA/2 males throughout pregnancy. Litter size, fetal weight and resorption rate were recorded in pregnant CBA/J mice sacrificed at gestational day 15. ",

Passage 2 cells were plated on 6-well Synthemax plates and 6-well gelatin coated plates in complete medium (10% FBS DMEM/F-12, 1% Pen Strep). Once the cells reached 90% confluence, 3 different differentiation agents were respectively added to 3 wells on each plate: 10 uM 5-azacytidine, 10 nM oxytocin (OT), and 100 nM OT. After 72 hours, all wells were replaced with complete medium. Control group wells received complete medium only. Complete medium was replaced every 3 days. 14 days after differentiation, mRNA was extracted and expression of cardiomyocyte markers (NKX2.5, cTnT, cTnI, and ISL1) was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The cells were visually recorded to observe any morphological changes. RESULTS: Treatment with 10 nM OT on Synthemax plates caused a 5-fold increase in expression of NKX2.5 and a 2-fold increase in cTnT expression while treatment with 10 uM 5-azacytidine caused a 2-fold increase in NKX2.5 and cTnT expression. Treatment with 5-azacytidine and OT on Synthemax plates did not lead to significant increases in cTnI, which is exclusively expressed in cardiomyocytes, or ISL1. Treatment with 5-azacytidine on gelatin coated plates resulted in a 6-fold increase in cTnI expression, while treatment with 100 nM OT yielded a 10-fold increase in ISL1 and a 17-fold increase in cTnI. 10 nM OT treatment resulted in a 3-fold increase in ISL1 and an 11-fold increase in cTnI. Treated cells showed morphological changes consistent with cardiomyocyte differentiation (e.g. striations similar to actin filaments), yet no spontaneous beating was observed. CONCLUSIONS: EDSC have shown the potential to be differentiated into cardiomyocyte-like cells, and further research will look towards increasing differentiation efficiency. This is especially promising for female CVD patients, where the autologous nature of their cells may increase clinical potential. . Serum 25OH-D and sRAGE concentrations were measured at baseline and after vitD3 supplementation in the treated group, and 8 weeks apart in the control group. In the second experiment, cumulus granulosa cells (GCs) collected from 7 women were cultured in media (control) with or without vitD3 (50nM) for 24h after which mRNA for RAGE was compared using RT-PCR.

The presence of even a few pyknotic or apoptotic granulosa cells in a single histological section of a follicle meets the criteria for follicle death, or, atresia. It has been suggested that it takes between 70 and 210 days for a primordial follicle to grow to its largest pre-antral state. Given a doubling time between 20 and 26 hours, granulosa proliferation without cell death would result in large solid volumes where any growing follicle would exceed the size of the entire ovary. The goal of this project was to test whether assumptions about proliferation and death match observed characteristics of ovarian follicles.",

Histomorphometric assessment of the ovaries of wild-type mice and mice deficient in the enzyme Cathepsin B (Ctsb) (n=5 ovaries per genotype) was performed after fixation, embedding, and preparation of sections upon glass slides. RESULTS: Follicle measurements from wild-type and Ctsb-/-mice (deficient in cell clearance) were compared with values calculated using R. Variation(s) in follicle volume due to the arrangement of granulosa cells were estimated using sphere packing calculations. We confirmed that without robust death and clearance, wild-type follicles from mice, and by extrapolation, humans cannot exhibit observed growth patterns. For example, given minimal cell death, a growth-activated primordial follicle consisting of a few pregranulosa cells and an oocyte would grow to 40 mm in diameter (a solid volume the size of a golf ball) in less than 50 days. In order to limit growth to the expected approximately 2 mm diameter, granulosa cells would either have to engage in a remarkably slow cell cycle (doubling on the order of every 130 hours), or approximately 30% of granulosa cells would have to die each day. That neither of these options is observed (or is realistic) again supports our interpretation that cell turnover consistent with nearly every other tissue of the body is critical for normal follicle growth. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, healthy wild-type follicles contain granulosa cells that proliferate at a rate greater than the number that die and are rapidly cleared. In atretic follicles, the rate of granulosa cell death exceeds the capacity for the phagocytic clearance of the dying cells.",

The proliferation data demonstrated that all cancer cell lines proliferated twice as much and their peak growth rates were on average five fold higher than the primary cells. Unsurprisingly, the cancer cell lines had significantly more telomerase than the amnion cells but the level of telomerase expression correlated with the proliferation rate (R 2 =0.912) for all of the cell types tested. CONCLUSIONS: While there has been controversy in the literature as to whether human fetal membrane cells express telomerase, we show clear expression by two methods and describe the level of patient variation at term. This data supports the idea that telomerase expression could be used to determine the proliferative capability of these cells and also supports mounting evidence by other researchers that these cells may be a source of therapeutic stem cells. Interestingly, H19 also acts as a molecular \"sponge\" for the let-7 family of miRNAs, which are known to play critical roles in development, cancer, and metabolism. We have previously shown that H19 expression is increased in cumulus cells of patients who sustain a high response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and in-vitro fertilization (COH-IVF).

KGN cells were cultured in aMEM and treated with estradiol (E2 10 -8 ) for 96 hours. Following treatments, RNA extraction was performed using the PureLink RNA Mini-Kit, and RT-qPCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR kit. All reactions were run in triplicate. Expression of H19 was normalized to beta-tubulin levels. Results were reported as a fold change in H19 expression between groups. To explore potential mechanisms, KGN cells were then treated with JNK-inhibitor 30 minutes prior to estradiol incubation and RNA extraction/RT-qPCR was performed as above. RESULTS: Extended culture of granulosa-like KGN cells with estradiol led to a twofold downregulation of H19 compared to control cells (p<0.05). Treatment with JNK-inhibitor restored H19 levels to those in untreated cells. CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, despite the fact that H19 is increased in women who are considered \"high responders\" to COH-IVF (with associated increased estradiol levels), H19 was significantly downregulated in cultured granulosa cells in the presence of estradiol. Treatment with JNK-inhibitor provided partial rescue from estradiol's downregulation of H19. Though the mechanism for regulation of H19 by estradiol remains unclear, perhaps H19 regulation by estradiol is dose-or context-dependent, and there may exist a feedback loop that underlies H19-mediated regulation in granulosa cells. Ultimately, this work provides impetus for further studies investigating the regulation of H19 by estradiol (with particular interest in the JNK pathway), as well as H19's role in granulosa cell growth and development.",

RESULTS: Expression level of miR-1 and miR-204 was almost consistent from day 4 to 28. On the contrary, expression of miR-133a, -133b and -499a was increased during differentiation and the level was highest at differentiation day 16. The expression level was significantly increased from day 12, differentiation stage in turning off of pluripotency genes and explosion of cardiac specific genes, to day 16 and the expression level was sustained. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we evaluated the expression profile of miRNAs during differentiation into cardiomyocytes from hPSCs. Our findings demonstrated the expression of miRNAs was stage-dependent during differentiation and the differentiation into CMs could be regulated by miRNAs through direct or indirect pathway (A111539).

METHODS: 8 reproductive-aged women who underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation followed by oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilization (IVF) were enrolled. GCs were cultured in media (control) with or without 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitD3; 50-100 nM) for 24 h after which: 1) mRNA was compared using RT-PCR for AMH, AMHR-II and c-kit ligand, an important regulator of oogenesis and folliculogenesis, and 2) AMH protein concentration in culture media was compared using ELISA. The effect of vitD3 on AMH action was assessed in GCs from 4 additional participants by measuring nuclear localization of phospho-Smad1/5/8 using immunofluorescence. For this experiment, GCs were treated with media (control) or recombinant AMH (50 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of vitD3 (50 nM) and the % of cells with nuclear staining of phospho-Smad1/5/8 calculated. Data are expressed as mean\u00b1SD. RESULTS: VitD3 significantly decreased AMHR-II mRNA levels from 4.7\u00b12.7 to 3.1\u00b12.2 (AU; p<0.05) but did not affect AMH or c-kit ligand mRNA levels. VitD3 did not affect AMH protein concentration in culture media (2.4\u00b10.9 vs. 2.3\u00b10.9 ng/mL; p=0.9). Recombinant AMH markedly increased the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and its localization to the nucleus when compared to control (20.7\u00b17.5% vs. 0.0\u00b10.0% respectively; p<0.01). When cells were treated with vitD3 in the presence of recombinant AMH, the accumulation of phospho-Smad1/5/8 in the nucleus was significantly reduced (3.0\u00b11.8%; p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that vitD3 suppresses the activity of AMH in human GCs. Because AMH signals via Smad1/5/8 to suppress follicular growth, these findings indicate that vitD3 may counteract this repressive effect of AMH, potentially promoting follicular differentiation.",

Human follicular fluid contains a combination of proteins, metabolites, and other molecules that are indicative of the follicular metabolism and could be associated with oocyte maturation stage as well as their quality. Specifically, miRNAs are regulators of gene expression in different tissues and fluids, implicated in many physiological and pathological processes. Objective: We aim to characterize the miRNA expression profile in the human follicular fluid and their putative association with oocyte maturation stage. METHODS: Patients undergoing IVF (n=15) with the same stimulation protocol: rhFSH+LH+GnRH antagonist were recruited for this study. Individual puncture of follicular fluid from different follicles resulting in 12 germinal vesicles (GVs), 9 metaphase I (MI) and 18 metaphase II (MII) oocytes were obtained and pooled (n=3) in groups. RNA was extracted and miRNA assessed using microarray technology. Global miRNAs expression was performed using Agilent Human miRNA v3 8x15K arrays. Data was analyzed using Rank product with False Discovery Correction < 5% for the differentially expressed miRNAs between different groups. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering were done for the differentially expressed miRNAs.",

When comparing GVs vs. MII and MI vs. MII, 13 and 7 miRNAs were found to be statistically deregulated respectively. Furthermore, we observed 43 and 5 \"on/off\" miRNAs expressed in GVs and MII respectively. When we looked at the \"on/off\" genes in MI vs. MII oocytes, we obtained 211 uniquely expressed miRNAs in MI compared to 28 miRNAs in the MII oocytes. Using a non-supervised PCA and hierarchical clustering analysis we were able to separate the different populations using miRNA expression. Documentation of olfactory receptor expression at the RNA level was achieved by RT-PCR using primers for 9 different, randomly selected, human olfactory receptor loci. The authenticity of specific amplification products was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Whole cell protein extracts obtained from luteinized cells were analyzed by western blotting using anti-OR4E2 antibody to document protein expression. Paraffin sections of donated ovarian tissue were examined by immunohistochemistry using the same antibody. RESULTS: Three of 9 different olfactory receptor species examined, OR52N, OR8G2, and OR4E2, were expressed at the RNA level in hyperstimulated luteinized granulosa cells. Confirmation of expression at the protein level was obtained for OR4E2 in both hyperstimulated luteinized and unstimulated granulosa cells of antral, primary, and primordial follicles.

The recipient mice were randomly divided into 3 groups, and uteri were harvested at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 16 weeks. The uteri were digested into a cell suspension, and sorted using FACS. Following exclusion of hematopoietic cells, 2 distinct populations were retrieved: CD45(-)/Ter119(-)/DsRed(+) and CD45(-)/ Ter119(-)/DsRed(-). Total RNA was collected and global gene expression for both groups was analyzed using microarray. DsRed(+) vs. DsRed(-) cell populations were compared for each time point. Statistical analysis was done by t test and false discovery rate (FDR). Cell surfacer markers were confirmed by IHC. RESULTS: BM derived stem cells showed increased expression of epithelial markers including cytokeratin 5, 13, 14, 15, 16; stromal markers Hoxa11 and Hoxb5; endothelial cell marker CD31, and smooth muscle marker a-SMA at 16 weeks compared to 2 weeks (p<0.05). Additionally, they showed intranuclear estrogen and progesterone receptor expression, which suggests functionality. The antibody panel showed that some BM derived cells expressed high levels of mesenchymal stem/progenitor cell markers CD44 and Sca-1 and lower levels of CD90 and CD146. Most of the CD44 + /DsRed + positive cells were in the endometrial stroma, however double positive cells were also observed in the uterine luminal epithelium. Sca-1 + /DsRed + and CD90 + /DsRed + cells were mainly distributed in the stroma. Similar to endogenous CD146 expressing mesenchymal cells, CD146 + /DsRed + cells were mainly adjacent to the vessels in the basal the endometrium. CONCLUSIONS: BM derived cells can contribute to uterine epithelial, stromal, endothelial and smooth muscle cells. These stem cells produce progeny that acquire a tissue distribution similar to that demonstrated by endogenous cells. Moreover, some of the BM derived cells express mesenchymal stem/progenitor markers, indicative of the BM contribution to the stem/progenitor cell pool. BM derived cell fate is carefully regulated to drive cells to diverse mature endometrial and stem/progenitor cell types.",

In this study, the Raman spectral changes present in wild type (WT) mice and a delayed labor model, Cyclooxygenase-1 knock out (COX-1 KO), were compared throughout gestation and correlated with biomechanical properties. Our preliminary data showed normal uterine contractility in both WT and KO models. We hypothesize that biochemical and mechanical differences in the cervix may be responsible for the prolonged gestation in COX-1 KO mice. METHODS: Raman spectra were acquired using an in vivo Raman system with a fiber optic probe. Biomechanical tests were performed on excised mouse cervix tissue and their results were correlated with spectral changes from corresponding mouse groups. Five mice were used for all time points for each genotype. T-tests were performed on each pixel in Raman spectra and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: COX-1 KO mice had significantly stiffer cervices compared to WT at all stages of gestation. Raman spectra of WT vs. COX-1 KO from the same gestation days had statistically significant differences in peaks corresponding to lipid and Amide 1 bonds. However, spectra from WT day 19 vs. COX-1 KO day 20 did no show significant differences, suggesting that the COX-1 KO cervix may have delayed cervical remodeling which results in delayed delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Raman spectroscopy was sensitive to the subtle cervical biochemical differences between WT and COX-1 pregnant mice at different stages during gestation. Furthermore, Raman data demonstrated that COX-1 KO mice have differences that manifest in the cervix rather than in uterine contractility. These cervical variations are likely responsible for delayed delivery in COX-1 KO mouse. Telomere shortening in fetal membranes is associated with spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) following pPROM. This is theorized to be due to premature senescence of fetal membrane cells in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The mechanism by which damaged telomeres lead to PTB and pPROM is still unclear. Herein we tested the hypothesis that telomere fragments generated by ROS damage to DNA cause amnion cell senescence through activation of p38 mitogen activated kinase (p38MAPK). METHODS: Primary human amnion cells isolated from fetal membranes were exposed to water soluble cigarette smoke extract (wsCSE), an ROS inducer. Changes in ROS levels and DNA base and strand damage were determined using 2'7'-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein and Fragment Length Analysis using Repair Enzymes (FLARE), respectively. Telomere length was determined by real-time qPCR. Cells were also treated with telomere mimetic (T-oligos, TTAGGGTTAGGG) or control oligonucleotides (AATCCCAATCCC) for 48 hours and immunostained for phosphorylated g-histone2A (gH2AX) to identify DNA damage foci (DDF). Western blots for phosphorylated (p) p38MAPK and staining for senescence specific \u00df-galactosidase (SA-\u00dfGal) also were performed. RESULTS: Exposure of amnion cells to wsCSE resulted in an increase in ROS that was prevented by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. DNA strand and base damage (generation of 8-oxoguanine) was evidenced by FLARE assays. Treatment of cells with wsCSE for 96 hours significantly decreased telomere length compared to untreated controls (p <0.05). wsCSE or T-oligo treatments resulted in more cells with DDF as indicated by increased g-H2AX staining than untreated or control oligo-treated cells. Similarly, pp38MAPK was increased after wsCSE or T-oligo treatment, with an increased expression of SA-\u00dfGal, demonstrating more senescence in these cells than untreated or control oligo-treated cells.",

ROS can lead to telomere fragmentation and cellular senescence and also triggers a distinct inflammatory cytokine signature, recruitment of inflammatory cells promoting PTB. A better understanding of the pathway(s) activated by telomere fragments should contribute to the design of PTB/pPROM treatment via prevention of premature senescence. Uterine smooth muscle exhibits rhythmic contractions in the absence of hormonal or neural stimuli. The frequency of these contractions is driven by a pacemaker current that all myometrial cells are thought to be capable of expressing. These potentials are hypothesized to initiate by a depolarizing leak current in the myometrium that is gadolinium (Gd 3+ ) sensitive, but the cationic leak channel responsible for this current remains to be elucidated. Here, we report the presence of a Gd 3+ -sensitive, Na + -dependent leak current in primary human myometrial smooth muscle cells (hMSMCs), and the contributution of a Na +l leak channel (NALCN) to this current. METHODS: Primary hMSMCs were isolated from human uterine samples, maintained in culture, and used through passage 4. Leak currents were measured in hMSMCs using whole-cell patch clamp analysis. NALCN-targeting shRNAs expressed by a lentiviral vector were used to knockdown NALCN expression in hMSMCs. NALCN expression was quantified via immunoblot and quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Whole-cell patch clamp analysis of hMSMCs revealed the presence of an ohmic leak current, which was significantly reduced by the presence of 10 mM Gd 3+ in the extracellular bath solution. Furthermore, by replacing bath Na + with a non-permeable cation, NMDG, we demonstrated that the leak current was Na + -dependent. The contribution of NALCN activity to the leak current was determined by knocking down NALCN expression. Treatment of hMSMCs with a NALCN-targeting shRNA resulted in a 50% reduction of NALCN mRNA, and an 80% decrease in NALCN protein levels in hMSMCs. The reduction in NALCN expression led to a significant decrease in the Gd 3+ -sensitive leak current elicited by a -60 mV membrane potential. Finally, to determine whether NALCN has a link to pregnancy-related changes in uterine contractility, we measured its expression in the mouse uterus using qRT-PCR and immunoblot and discovered a decline in expression near term. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our results indicate that NALCN contributes to the Na + -dependent, Gd 3+ -sensitive leak current in the uterus. Furthermore, this channel's expression changes throughout pregnancy, indicating a potential role for it in pregnancy related changes in uterine contractility.",

            "text": "Preterm Uterine quiescence is vital to maintaining a pregnancy to term. Important regulators of this quiescence are K + channels, which serve to polarize the membrane of myometrial smooth muscle cells (MSMCs) and keep them in a relaxed state. One crucial K + channel in the uterus is the small conductance, calcium activated potassium channel 3 (SK3-1A). When overexpressed in mice, this channel attenuates uterine contractions and displays delayed or incomplete parturition. We previously reported six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the SK3 gene (KCNN3) associated with preterm birth. One of these SNPs, rs1218585, is located near the promoter for alternative exon 1C, which encodes SK3-1C, a dominant negative suppressor of SK3-1A. Due to the importance of SK3-1A in maintaining uterine quiescence, a shift in the SK3-1A:SK3-1C balance, may lead to premature contractility. We hypothesized that rs1218585 contributes to preterm birth by altering SK3-1C expression. METHODS: Promoter reporter assays were performed using Promega's pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmids. To test promoter activity, alternative exon 1C promoter and 523 base pairs of the upstream sequence, expressing either the wild type (WT) or the rs1218585 genotype, were cloned upstream of the luciferase coding sequence. To test enhancer activity, the 523 base pair segment was cloned upstream of an SV40 promoter, driving the luciferase coding sequence. These plasmids were transfected into HEK-293T cells and luciferase activity was measured 48 hours later.",

However, we found no significant difference between the promoter activity of plasmids containing the WT KCNN3 sequence and rs1218585 despite our predictions. CONCLUSIONS: The loss of enhancer activity upon inclusion of the SNP suggests that the SNP precludes endogenous enhancer activity. Enhancers can act in trans, and therefore, changes in enhancer activity could impact not only SK3-1C activity, but could also reduce SK3-1A activity. The results emphasize the need for a myometrium specific, full-gene model of KCNN3 regulation to definitively elucidate its role in preterm birth. On-time parturition requires coordinated progression from an anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory immune profile in gestational tissues. Macrophages are implicated as potent regulators of the maternal immune adaptations required for successful gestation, parturition and delivery. We hypothesized that CD11b+ monocyte/macrophages have a critical role in controlling the timing and success of birth. METHODS: CD11b-dtr mice mated with wild-type FVB males were given diphtheria toxin (DT; 25 ng/g, to deplete CD11b+ cells) or PBS on gestation day 16, with or without exogenous progesterone or wild-type bone-marrow derived macrophages (n=9-12 / group).

Expression of several genes regulating inflammation was dysregulated in decidual tissue. CD11b+ cell depletion caused preterm delivery in CD11b-dtr mice, with birth 20h earlier than in control mice (P<0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test). The duration of labor was extended 1.4-fold, pups weighed 15% less and their viability was poor compared with controls (26% vs 100%)(all P<0.05). Administration of exogenous macrophages, but not progesterone, alleviated prematurity and normalized labour duration in DT-treated mice, with an increased fetal survival rate of 72% (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Acute depletion of maternal macrophages during late gestation induced preterm delivery and perinatal death, and replacement with exogenous wild-type macrophages protected mice from fetal loss. These data suggest that macrophages have a physiological role in exerting anti-inflammatory effects to maintain uterine quiescence and restrain premature progression to labor in mice. Thus, insufficient number or function of anti-inflammatory macrophages warrants investigation as a cause of preterm delivery in women. CONCLUSIONS: This in vivo study provides a novel approach to the physiologic capacities of the myometrium early in pregnancy. These preliminary fi ndings demonstrate the plasticity of the myometrium early in pregnancy resulting in almost 50% larger uterine size in Twins than Singleton pregnancies by 11 weeks gestation and 30% larger in Twins than Singletons at 14 weeks gestation.

We assessed associations between BMI and obesity in non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Black women. RESULTS: Analyses adjusted for maternal age, height, and prenatal care month showed the three obesity categories (I-III) were associated with increased risk of preterm birth at 20-23 and 24-31 weeks among nulliparous non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Black women. Odds ratios ranged from 1.3 to 7.0. These risks were further influenced by socioeconomic status (as measured by educational attainment). A similar, but lower risk, pattern was observed for multiparous women. Lower BMI was associated with modest increased risks (odds ratios 1.2 to 2.1) for preterm births at 24-31 and 32-36 weeks for nulliparous and multiparous women in each of the racial/ethnic groups.

RESULTS: In cervix from both D21 and NP rats, expression of a subset of Mj-related genes were regulated in common, either increased (158) or decreased (57). The fold magnitude of each varied between D21 and NP groups. Pathway analyses indicated constitutive inflammatory functions in both D21 and NP cervices for leukocytes (cell movement, engulfment, response of myeloid cells, activation of phagocytes), cell growth/survival (differentiation, proliferation, fatty acid metabolism), and cell signaling (adhesion, binding). Some inflammation-related gene expression and pathways were diminished in the preterm cervix. Overall, common regulated genes reflected canonical pathways for cellular signaling by Cdc42, ILK, and NFAT, dendritic cell maturation, as well as agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis. CONCLUSIONS: These data are the first to suggest that expression of Mj-related genes in both prepartum and nonpregnant cervix reflect selectivity in ongoing proinflammatory processes. With pathway analyses of exclusively regulated Mj-related genes, pathways that reflect actions by an alternative Mj phenotype (putative M2-like wound-healing) may become more prominent in the prepartum cervix. The findings support the possibility that a balance of Mj-related molecules may reflect selective inflammatory and restorative processes to enhance extracellular remodeling in the prepartum cervix. Whether molecules regulated by gene expression are sentinel to the progress of remodeling or provide useful therapeutic strategies for control of the timely ripening of the cervix remains to be determined. The commonly accepted hypothesis is that an action potential propagates throughout the uterus, recruiting and activating tissue as it passes. In 1970 Csapo proposed that mechanotransduction by pressure-tension sensing was the mechanism for organ-level coordination of contractions. But because strong evidence shows electrical activity is crucial for uterine contractions, mechanotransduction has been largely forgotten. SQUID array measurements recently indicated that organ-level recruitment of tissue is not contiguous, and suggested the uterus is composed of functional regions of myometrium. To incorporate these data, we propose a novel mechanism where action potential propagation recruits and activates tissue within regions, but mechanotransduction synchronizes the regional contractions into organ-level contractions of labor.",

            "text": "The surface of the gravid uterus was simulated with equalsized functional regions arranged in a 13 x 11 array. Each region was a \"cell\" in cellular automaton lexicon. Cells were inactive, active, or inactivated (refractory). Cells only interacted via mechanotransduction, where wall tension is proportional to intrauterine pressure (LaPlace's Law). Each cell activated when tension exceeded threshold. The pressure at any time was proportional to the sum of all activities. The threshold and sensitivity were the primary input parameters with a mean and variance distributed across the cells. RESULTS: At some input settings, cells activated asynchronously or infrequently. At other settings, phasic rises of pressure occurred regularly over time, and were highly suggestive of the phasic pressure rises of labor contractions. Contraction frequency, regularity, and peak strength depended upon each input parameter. Only under extreme conditions did strong contractions occur without intervening periods of quiescence. CONCLUSIONS: Emergent behavior of phasic coordinated activity was demonstrated using mechanotransduction recruitment of regional contractions. This simulation supports the concept that mechanotransduction mechanisms can coordinate moderate numbers of regional contractions and mimic function of the human uterus. Myometrial contractions of labour signal the normal physiological end-point of pregnancy but the biochemical onset of labour may occur at or earlier via series of changes in expression of labour associated genes. There is increasing evidence that components of the cAMP-signalling pathway are up-regulated in the human myometrium during pregnancy to promote myometrial relaxation. Our aim was to determine how the cAMP-related genes are altered in pregnancy and parturition. METHODS: Myometrial biopsies from caesarean sections were taken preterm before the onset of labour (PNL), and at term, either before (TNL) or after the onset of labour. Term labour was divided into early labour (EAL, <3cm dilatation), and established labour (ESL, \u22653cm dilatation). Samples were rapidly frozen at -800C for RNA and protein extraction (n=12 for each group). Cells from TNL biopsies were cultured and incubated with and without 100\u00b5M forskolin for 48h, RNA extracted and subjected to Affimetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 array gene analysis. A total of 28870 genes were interrogated (n=3). Two gene lists were generated by combining the top 50 up-regulated and down-regulated genes. Only those genes with p<0.05 and fold change >1.5 were analyzed. Of the genes altered by cAMP, 8 that were up-regulated (11bHSD1, MKP-1, PKAR2a, GPR125, GaS, PDE4B, CCL8, PTGES) and 5 that were down-regulated (OTR, CREB3L1, GUCY1A3, GPR124, PRKG1) were analyzed in the myometrium obtained from the different groups of women by qPCR and western blotting. RESULTS: Of the up-regulated cAMP genes, there is a significant decrease from PNL to term labour in PKAR2a at mRNA and protein levels (p<0.01). Similar trends were also observed in 11bHSD1 (mRNA and protein), MKP-1 (mRNA) and PDE4B, GaS (protein). Of the downregulated cAMP genes, there is a significant increase from PNL to EAL in OTR (p<0.05), CREB3L1 (p<0.01), GUCY1A3 (p<0.01), and GPR124 (p<0.01) at mRNA level but the significant increase at protein level is only observed with OTR (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that in the cAMP regulated genes, the expression of PKAR2a at mRNA and protein levels is increased in pregnancy and decreased in labour, whereas the opposite is observed in the expression of OTR. This study highlights the differences in cAMPrelated gene expression at different stages of pregnancy and parturition. for UW, NW, OW, and obese groups, respectively. UW mothers were younger, more likely to smoke and use alcohol or illicit drugs, showed decreased hypertension but increased preterm delivery, and had a lower cesarean rate; while OW and obese mothers were older, showed increased hypertension and diabetes, and had a higher cesarean rate. UW mothers had a 2-fold increase in SGA infants, while OW and obese mothers had a 1.5 and 2.5-fold increase in LGA infants, respectively. Birth to placental weight ratios were decreased for all three pathologic BMI groups, indicating disproportionately high placental weights relative to fetal weights. Arterial PO 2 values were lower in all birth weight groups from OW and obese mothers and in all LGA groups, while venous and arterial PO 2 were both lower in all SGA groups.",

CONCLUSIONS: Measures of blood loss are highly associated and correlated. While the validity of subjective EBL as a measure of blood loss can improve with training, consideration may be given to using objective measures such as hemoglobin change or sponge count as markers of excessive bleeding. Hemoglobin change, while very useful in postoperative care, would not trigger a change in intraoperative decision making or immediate postoperative care. In contrast, sponge count may prove to be effective as an objective, intraoperative indicator of cesarean section hemorrhage.

During six postpartum weeks we followed two groups: GROUP-A (349 women treated for 7 days with low-molecular-weight-heparin) and GROUP-B (180 women not treated with low-molecular-weight-heparin treatment). The outcomes were as follows: thromboembolic events onset during the post-partum period, non-obstetrical-linked maternal haemorrhage, blood transfusion, relaparotomy, detection of surgical site haematoma, length of hospitalisation, and treatment suspension because of decreased platelet count. RESULTS: Except for the parity number, the two groups were homogeneous for the general features. In both groups, we reported no cases of thromboembolic events during the follow up period.

Additionally, the high occurrence rates of this triad should alert healthcare providers to carefully screen for these preexisting conditions in their GDM patients. Recent work with an urban cohort revealed that increasing the total T-ACE score cut-point from 2 to 3 doubled specificity of detecting risk drinking in pregnancy without reducing sensitivity substantially. The goal of this study was to further validate a cut-point of 3 (TACER-3) in a rural cohort. METHODS: Prospectively recruited pregnant patients (n=540) completed the T-ACE and a simple alcohol questionnaire that assessed the women's self-reported typical pre-pregnancy alcohol consumption. RESULTS: 22.2% of participants were positive on the T-ACE (cutpoint =2) compared to 5.4% positive on the TACER-3 (cut-point =3). An ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD contrasts revealed that \"At-Risk\" women (positive on T-ACE and TACER-3) reported consuming significantly more alcohol per day before pregnancy than both the \"Notat-Risk\" (negative on both on T-ACE and TACER-3) and \"Change Risk\" (positive on T-ACE but not TACER-3) women (omnibus F=22.3, p<.001). The rate of average daily alcohol use among women in the \"Change Risk\" group was not significantly different than women in the \"No Risk\" group. Relative Risk scores indicated that women in the TACER-3-positive \"At-Risk\" group were 6.6 times more likely to drink alcohol at risk levels (\u22650.5 absolute oz./day) than women in the \"No-Risk\" group, and 2.6 times more likely than women in the \"Change Risk\" group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the original T-ACE, the TACER-3 was more effective at selectively identifying women who were drinking at risk level prior to pregnancy recognition in this rural cohort. These analyses further validate prior findings that using the TACER-3 reduces \"false positives.\" The TACER-3 allows for more efficient use of health care provider time in directing targeted clinical interventions with those pregnant women most at risk for adverse fetal outcomes.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of self-reported information on pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) on delivery outcomes in a Canadian sample. METHODS: Data were drawn from the All Our Babies (AOB) study, a prospective, ongoing community-based pregnancy cohort in Calgary, Alberta (N=3388). Maternal self-reported data on height and prepregnancy weight were linked to clinical data on pregnancy and birth events retrieved from Alberta Perinatal Health Program (APHP) electronic health records. Exclusion criteria were defined as: preterm delivery, multiples, non-cephalic presentation, elective C-section, BMI <18.5, and missing data. Descriptive statistics and chi square analysis were used to assess associations between pre-pregnancy BMI categories (normal weight BMI =18.5-24.9; overweight BMI=25-29.9; and obese BMI>30) and delivery outcomes. Multinomial regression analyses were used to examine the association between pre-pregnancy BMI and type of delivery (operative vaginal or c-section, compared to spontaneous vaginal), controlling for confounding variables such as maternal age, preexisting maternal health conditions, fertility issues, pregnancy complications, and weight gain during the present pregnancy. Regression models were stratified by mode of labor onset (spontaneous vs. induced).",

This was seen for both women with spontaneous labor and women with induced labor. Obesity (OR=2.51, CI=1.32, 4.76) was a significant risk factor for delivery by C-section among women with induced labor; other significant factors included nulliparity and previous history of C-section. For women with spontaneous labor, significant factors associated with C-section included previous C-section and nulliparity but not increased BMI. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of obstetrical interventions at delivery in women with increased pre-pregnancy BMI and this depends on mode of labor. Women of reproductive age may benefit from lifestyle counseling to optimize pre-pregnancy weight. Postdate pregnancy is defined as pregnancy that extends beyond 41 to 42 completed weeks of gestation. Given the increased incidence of stillbirth and other complications as pregnancy advances towards 42 weeks, induction of labor between 41 and 42 weeks is the current best practice. However, the response to labor induction is variable and has been related to several maternal/fetal factors (parity, gestational age, high body mass index BMI, maternal age, Bishop score, neonatal birth weight, ultrasound cervical lenght, E3/E2 ratio). In this context the finding of novel parameters associated with the response to labor induction may help clinicians to predict outcome of labor induction in postdate pregnancy. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether the measurement of novel ultrasound parameters, such as membrane thickness and pulsatility index of the fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA PI), are associated with the response to labor induction in postdate pregnancies.",

RESULTS: Women who successfully delivered with 24 hours showed significantly lower MCA PI (P=0.0013) and shorter ultrasound cervical length (P<0.0001) from the remaining patients, while membrane thickness did not show any difference. In addition non-responders differed significantly from responders in terms of higher maternal weight gain (P=0.0147), BMI increase (P=0.0152) and more numerous male fetuses (P=0.004), confirming data in the literature.

Women with a prior intrapartum cervical laceration have been hypothesized to have cervical insufficiency, protracted labor, and cesarean delivery in subsequent pregnancies. We sought to characterize subsequent pregnancy outcomes among women with a prior cervical laceration. METHODS: Retrospective case series of women with their first 2 consecutive pregnancies carried to \u2265 20.0 wks gestation within a tertiary healthcare system, 2002-2012. Women with multiple gestation or fetal anomalies/aneuploidy were excluded. Data were extracted from computerized point-of-care programs. Cases of cervical laceration in the 1st delivery were identified by ICD9 code, confirmed on chart review, and included only if suture repair was required. Outcomes from the second pregnancy were examined. RESULTS: 55 women were confirmed to have a cervical laceration in the 1st delivery (0.14% of deliveries). 43 lacerations were identified after vaginal delivery (VD) and 12 after cesarean delivery (CD). The mean delivery gestational age was 39.1 wks and birthweight 3519g; these were similar between those with VD and CD. 5 women delivered < 37wks and 2 women had a cerclage. Among women with VD, 12 (28%) delivered by forceps/vacuum, 4 (9.5%) had a 2nd stage > 3 hrs, 21 (50%) had an episiotomy, and the mean EBL was 716 \u00b1 705 cc.

The indications for the emergency cerclage were sharp decline of cervical length \u226410mm or prolapsed of membranes after 20 weeks of gestation. The cases of bacterial cervitis with erastase positive or clinical chorioamnionitis were excluded. We performed a double cervical cerclage procedure was performed addition to McDonald cerclage 10) . After the first stitch was placed and tied, a second stitch was placed in a similar fashion proximal to the first suture, coloser to the internal os. Subsequently, vaginal washing with and insertion of chloramphenicol vaginal tablets were performed for 1 week. Cervical length was measured using transvaginal ultrasonography every week after cerclage. Prior to the emergency cerclage, we explained the method of the cerclage conscientiously and obtained informed consents from every case. RESULTS: Six cases were identified from our medical records.Mean gestational age at the cerclage was 23.0\u00b10.9.

As for the afterbirth, the curettage rate was 10,23% in A and 22,58% in B (p=0,0162).

As for the position of the fetal-head, oxytocin use, PROM rate and induced labor no statistically significant differences were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural analgesia lengthens the dilation and the expulsive periods. Nevertheless, this does not imply a worsening of the newborns'health. It also has positive effects on the afterbirth, making spontaneous afterbirth easier compared to curettage. This could result from the positive effects that epidural analgesia has on utero-placental blood flow. Maternal exercise has been shown to provide a number of health benefits for offspring. Babies whose mothers exercised during pregnancy are leaner and have improved cognitive scores in childhood. Mouse and rat offspring born to exercised dams have improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Here, we hypothesized that maternal exercise would decrease mouse offspring tumorigenesis following treatment with chemical carcinogens. METHODS: Three month old offspring born to sedentary or exercised ICR dams were exposed to a two-stage carcinogenesis model to determine whether or not maternal exercise would provide long-term tumor resistance in offspring. A tumor initiator, 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene, was applied topically to the shaved skin on the backs of male and female offspring. Two weeks later, and twice weekly thereafter, offspring were treated with a topical application of a tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Tumors were counted weekly by the same individual blinded to groups until 90% tumor incidence was reached in carcinogen-treated offspring born to sedentary dams. The experiment was terminated, RNA was extracted from skin following euthanasia, and expression levels of genes of interest were quantified with a NanoString nCounter analysis system. RESULTS: Both male and female offspring had significantly decreased tumor incidence (i.e. a delay in first tumor appearance) as a result of maternal exercise. Offspring born to exercised dams also showed a trend toward decreased numbers of tumors compared to offspring born to sedentary dams. Significant differences were found in expression of stress-response genes in the skin from carcinogen-treated mice as a consequence of maternal exercise. Nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2), glutathione peroxidase 1, and superoxide dismutase 3, which are all genes involved in antioxidant response, were among those genes whose expression was significantly altered when comparing TPA-treated offspring born to sedentary and exercised dams.",

Male and female offspring from normoxic (control) and hypoxic (IUGR) pregnancies were randomized at 10 weeks of age to either an exercise-trained or sedentary group. Rats were acclimatized to treadmill running then exercised for 6 weeks; 5 days/week, 30 min/day at 20 m/min. After a recovery period of 24 hours, animals were euthanized and second order mesenteric arteries were isolated and mounted on a wire myograph. Cumulative concentration response curves to methacholine (MCh) were performed in the presence of an NO synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) or a superoxide dismutase mimetic (MnTBAP). RESULTS: Exercise enhanced vasodilation in mesenteric arteries from control female offspring (pEC 50 in sedentary 7.25\u00b10.11 vs. exercise 7.53\u00b10.08;p<0.05) and control male offspring (pEC 50 in sedentary 7.32\u00b10.08 vs. exercise 7.69\u00b10.07;p<0.05). Exercise also enhanced vasodilation in IUGR female (p<0.05) but not male IUGR offspring (p=0.8). Area under the curve (AUC) analysis from arteries incubated with and without L-NAME, showed that exercise improved NO-mediated vasodilation in only female control offspring (AUC in sedentary 50.28\u00b110.45 vs. exercise 90.23\u00b112.72;p<0.05) but not male control or either IUGR groups. No differences were found in vasodilation to MCh in the presence of MnTBAP. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that exercise improves vasodilation in female but not male IUGR offspring. Contrary to our hypothesis, exercise did not improve NO-mediated vasodilation in IUGR offspring. In IUGR females, however, there appeared to be a compensatory vasodilatory pathway that was absent in IUGR males. (1). Outcomes may be due to increased maternal ROS (2). We hypothesized that maternal antioxidant Res treatment before and in pregnancy would improve AL and decrease HC ROS in male OFF. METHODS: From weaning through pregnancy and lactation female rats ate chow (C) or maternal high energy obesogenic diet (MO). Half C and MO mothers received 20mg/kg Res orally for 30d before and in pregnancy (CRes and MORes). Rats were bred at PND 120 continuing the same diet. All OFF ate chow from weaning. At 90d, six males from different litters were tested with Progressive Ratio (PR), AL and retention tests and euthanized to determine HC Malondialdehyde (MDA-spectrophotometry) and ROS (fluorescence). Analysis by ANOVA. RESULTS: MO OFF required more sessions to lever press to reach performance criterion (Fig 1 A-B ) and increased overall motivation to work vs. C (fig 1 C) . HC MDA and ROS increased in MO vs C (Fig  1 D-E) . MORes decreased session number to lever press and partially prevented increased HC MDA and ROS. ",

After adjustment for GA, BW and PW, the association was strengthened (p=0.003). Inspection of the factor components revealed major contributions of distance of arteries from the disk edge, variable branching angles and arterial tortuosity. Females had reduced arterial extension on the chorionic surface with increased distance of arteries to the perimeter, reduced branching angle but greater variation in branching angles and reduced tortuosity, with the opposite generally found in males. A similarly composed venous factor was more weakly correlated with gender. CONCLUSIONS: Within a high risk autism sibling cohort, there are identifiable gender differences in placental chorionic vascular network structure. Gender differences are stronger in arterial than venous vascular networks. Association of these factors with autism diagnosis is pending, but we speculate that these differences are due to the fact that arterial network structure is more directly influenced by oscillation/pulsatility of blood flow caused by the fetal heart beat. Antenatal glucocorticoid (GC) therapy decreases respiratory distress syndrome and infant mortality when administered to women at risk for preterm delivery. We have shown that prenatal exposure to clinically relevant doses of glucocorticoids at the time of nephrogenesis leads to impaired Na + excretion in adult male sheep while females are protected from this effect. It is well known that 50% to 70% of sodium is reabsorbed in the renal proximal tubule (RPT). The present study was to determine if there are sex differences in the effects of prenatal Beta exposure on basal Na+ uptake by RPTC and if sex influences responses to Ang II and Ang-(1-7). METHODS: RPTC were isolated from 1-yr-old male (n=14) or female (n=10) vehicle-or Beta exposed offspring (exposure at 0.6gestation) and cultured for 7-10 days.

Cnr1 expression is decreased in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in obesity. Gene expression and metabolic programming are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as methylation of DNA. Whether MTS or surgically induced-IUGR (sIUGR) alters Cnr1 mRNA expression or DNA methylation of the Cnr1 gene in rat VAT is unknown. We hypothesize that MTS and sIUGR decrease Cnr1 mRNA expression and alter DNA methylation in the promoter of the Cnr1 in VAT rat offspring. METHODS: Pregnant rats were exposed to tobacco smoke from embryonic day 11 to term (MTS). Postnatally, MTS offspring were cross fostered to control dams. sIUGR was induced by bilateral uterine artery ligation on gestational day 19. At weaning, offspring VAT was collected. Cnr1 mRNA levels were quantified. DNA methylation of the proximal promoter, transcriptional start site and intron 1 of the Cnr1 was evaluated by bisulfite modification and sequencing. RESULTS: Results are reported as MTS or sIUGR as % of sex-matched controls (*p<0.05). In female offspring, MTS and sIUGR decreased mRNA levels of Cnr1 in VAT (10%* and 53%*, respectively). MTS and sIUGR increased methylation of CpG's in the proximal promoter of the Cnr1 gene of female VAT (166%* and 150%*, respectively). In contrast, MTS decreased DNA methylation in the intronic region of the Cnr1 gene (65%*) in female VAT with no changes in sIUGR female rats. In male offspring, MTS did not alter VAT Cnr1 mRNA levels or DNA methylation. However, sIUGR increased Cnr1 mRNA levels (195%*) without changes in DNA methylation of the Cnr1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: MTS and sIUGR alter Cnr1 mRNA expression and DNA methylation in a model and sex-specific manner in rat VAT. The CpG density of the Cnr1 gene promoter is relatively low. Increased methylation in the transcriptional start of genes with low density CpG's is frequently associated with decreased gene expression. We speculate that MTS and sIUGR increased DNA methylation in the transcriptional start of Cnr1 gene programming decreased expression of Cnr1 in VAT of female offspring. The transition from the fetal to the neonatal heart requires extensive physiological changes including shifting energy production from glucose to fatty acids, completion of cardiomyocyte differentiation and profound morphologic remodeling to achieve the neonatal-adult circulatory pattern. In early postnatal life, plasma melatonin (MEL) fall from fetal levels since the neonate has not started its own pineal production. Aim. To investigate whether postnatal MEL treatment modifies neonatal heart remodeling and metabolic shifting in energy production. We measured: heart weight and mRNA expression in atrium and ventricles of a cluster of genes involved in 1) fatty acid and glucose utilization (HFABP: fatty acid intracellular transport, HK: hexokinase1 and the nuclear receptors PPARa and PPARg and the coactivator PGC1a); 2) heart growth: glucocorticoid receptor: GR; and 3) heart secretory function: natriuretic peptides ANP and BNP. METHODS: From birth, 10 lambs received 1mg oral MEL daily at 1700 h and 10 vehicle. Four lambs per group were euthanized at 5 days of treatment and six at 12 days. Heart was weighed, right and left atrium and ventricles were stored in TRIzol and mRNA levels were measured by qPCR using RLP0 as constitutive gene. Results are means \u00b1SEM. RESULTS: The heart weight was 5.96 \u00b1 0.23 g/kg bw, after 12 days of MEL treatment vs. 6.75 \u00b1 0.22 in controls lambs (p< 0.05). There was no effect in other organs. Atrium and ventricle gene expression of HFABP, PPARa, PGC1a, GR, ANP and BNP increased in control lambs between 5 and 12 days of age, whilst HK and PPARg remained constant. MEL treatment for five days had no effect in the atrium but increased HFABP, PPARa, PGC1a and GR in the ventricles to the levels observed at 12 days of age in controls. There was no effect on HK and PPARg. The hearts after 12 days of MEL treatment expressed more ANP and BNP, and less HK1 and PPARg and PGC1a than control hearts in the atrium and ventricle. CONCLUSIONS: Postnatal melatonin treatment significantly alters the neonatal heart, presumably accelerating the metabolic shift and heart remodeling. It is unknown yet whether these changes alter cardiovascular function later in life. Use of fetal growth charts assumes that optimal size at birth for immediate health outcomes is at the 50th centile. However, the interaction between maternal constraint of fetal growth and risks associated with smaller size at birth indicate that this assumption may not be valid, especially for perinatal mortality. METHODS: Data of over 1 million births between 28 and 43 weeks gestation from singleton pregnancies without congenital abnormalities in the period from 2000 to 2008 were collected from the Netherlands Perinatal Registry. Distribution of perinatal mortality according to birth weight centile and gestational age was studied. RESULTS: There were 5075 (0.43%) perinatal deaths. Highest mortality occurred in infants with a birth weight below the 2.3rd centile (25.4/1.000 births) and the lowest mortality with birth weights between the 80th and 90th centile (2.4/1.000 births) of routinely used growth charts.

INTRODUCTION: Prenatal smoking is common despite substantial evidence of increased fetal morbidity and mortality. Telomeres (nucleotide sequences vital to cell division and the maintenance of chromosomal structures) can shorten at an accelerated rate due to environmental factors such as smoking. Shortened telomere lengths are associated with adverse health outcomes as well as accelerated ageing. Studies have shown a relationship between prenatal tobacco exposure and telomere shortening in children, however, there is a lack of data on telomere measures in fetuses exposed to tobacco smoke. We sought to investigate whether maternal smoking during pregnancy affects telomere length of the fetus. METHODS: Pregnant women were recruited upon admission for delivery at a university-affiliated hospital from 2011 to 2012. A self-report questionnaire and salivary cotinine test were used to confirm maternal tobacco exposure. Those who reported smoking while pregnant and tested positive for tobacco were categorized as smokers. Neonatal umbilical cord blood samples were collected from 65 full-term newborns (26 nonsmokers and 39 active smokers). Genomic DNA was isolated from cord blood leukocytes and analyzed for fetal telomere length based on Cawthon Quantitative PCR. This approach provides an average on absolute telomere lengths in genomic DNA of the fetus by determining the Cawthon ratio in experimental samples relative to the reference sample. Bootstrap and ANOVA statistical methodology were used to evaluate the relationship between prenatal smoking status and fetal telomere length. RESULTS: The average maternal age was 25 years (range 18-39) and a mean gestational age of 39 weeks 5 days. Fetal telomere length was significantly shorter among infants born to active smokers (Mean Cawthon ratio = 5755) as compared to non-smokers (Mean Cawthon ratio = 5774) [p<0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first evidence demonstrating shortened telomere length among fetuses exposed to smoking during pregnancy. Smoking during pregnancy is a preventable cause of enhanced chromosomal aging. The potential long-term implications of neonatal \"genetic aging\" are potentially enormous, underscoring the importance of smoking cessation interventions during pregnancy. FACs, an increase in activity would further reduce peNOS, decrease NO production, and allow for increased cortisol synthesis under stimulated conditions. NIH HDPO131226, HDRO151951. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with significant neonatal morbidity, mortality and long term health complications. As a reduction in uteroplacental perfusion is an important cause of IUGR, vasodilators -such as the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil citrate -are a potential therapy for IUGR. Sildenafil has been shown to increase fetal growth in mouse models of IUGR, but efficacy and safety studies in large animals are lacking. This study aims to examine the effects of sildenafil citrate on fetal growth in an ovine model of IUGR. METHODS: Ewes carrying singleton pregnancies underwent surgery and insertion of vascular catheters at 96-100 days gestational age (dGA, term = 147 dGA). Catheterisation included tarsal, carotid, jugular and uterine vessels in the ewe, and tarsal arteries and veins in the fetus. Ewes were randomised to either uterine artery embolization to induce IUGR, via injection of microspheres into the uterine artery, at 102-107 dGA, or to a non-embolised 'normal growth' control group. Ewes in the IUGR group were then randomised to receive a daily 12 hour infusion of either sildenafil citrate (75 or 150 mg/day) or vehicle for 21 days; the 'normal growth' control group received no treatment. Blood pressure was measured in the ewe during the first 3 days of treatment, using a pressure transducer connected to either a maternal carotid or tarsal artery catheter. Fetal biometric data was collected at the end of the treatment period. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, lambs born to sildenafil treated ewes showed a trend towards increased body weight (3,915\u00b1386 vs 4,535\u00b1138 g; p=0.09), ponderal index (34.8\u00b11.9 vs 42.5\u00b13.9 kg/m 3 ; p=0.057) and abdominal circumference (30.8\u00b12.0 vs 33.8\u00b11.10 cm; p=0.2). Sildenafil infusion did not result in a fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP) or rise in heart rate (HR) (control vs sildenafil: MAP 91\u00b14 vs 105\u00b19 mmHg; p=0.2, HR 123\u00b17 vs 122\u00b113; p=0.6). A limited number of sheep have completed the study protocol to date, and the study is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Although numbers are limited, early data suggests a trend towards sildenafil citrate having a beneficial effect on fetal growth in this ovine model of growth restriction. We found no adverse effects in the ewe (such as hypotension or tachycardia) related to sildenafil administration. The normoxic conditions were used as a control. The IUGR in pregnant rabbits was induced by uteroplacental vessels ligature. Five mg of human or rabbit placental tissues were used for protein isolation (cytoplasmic/ nuclear fractionation) and RNA extraction. Protein and mRNA levels were determined by Western blot and real-time PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Hypoxia in JAR cells resulted in up-regulation of NFAT5 mRNA and protein at 8 and 16 hours as compared with normoxic conditions. The significant increase of NFAT5 levels was observed in 50% of human placentas of PE patients, as compared to normotensive group. There was also an increase in the levels of NFAT5 in the placentas of rabbit IUGR model (67% of cases). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that NFAT5 is activated under hypoxic conditions in the in vitro trophoblast cell model, as well in hypoxic placentas from human preeclamptic patients and rabbit model of IUGR. These results suggest that NFAT5 could serve as a potential biomarker of PE or IUGR.",

            "text": "Effect of a High Fat Diet on Fetal Growth and Uterine Artery Function. Jasmine F Plows, Joanna L Stanley, Huan Zhao, Philip N Baker. Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, New Zealand. INTRODUCTION: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with both short-and long-term complications. Pregnant mice lacking the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene (eNOS -/-) deliver growth-restricted pups, and can be used as a model of FGR. Maternal obesity is a risk factor for FGR and many other pregnancy disorders, and can negatively impact both the mother and the growing baby. We hypothezise that feeding eNOS -/mice a high fat diet will induce uterine artery dysfunction and therefore further impair uteroplacental perfusion, resulting in an exacerbation of fetal growth restriction in the pups. METHODS: Control C57BL/6J and eNOS -/mice were randomly assigned to receive either normal diet (4% kcals from fat) or high fat diet (40% kcals from fat) for 8 weeks prior to mating. At gestational day 18.5, the pregnant mice were culled and the pups were removed, weighed, and measured. The uterine arteries were dissected and mounted on a wire myograph. Arterial function was determined by assessing the response to the vasoconstrictor phenylephrine, and the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh). RESULTS: There was a significant effect of genotype (p=0.03) on pup weight; pups from eNOS -/mice were significantly smaller than C57BL/6J controls (0.95\u00b10.09 vs. 1.09\u00b10.02g). There was a significant effect of high fat diet on pup abdominal circumference (p=0.005). The abdominal circumference of pups from the high fat diet group were reduced compared with controls in C57BL/6J (22.6 \u00b11.3 vs 26.1 \u00b1 0.5mm; p<0.05) and eNOS -/mice (22.2\u00b10.5 vs 23.9\u00b10.9). There was no effect of genotype (p=0.18) or diet (p=0.17) on uterine artery constriction to phenylephrine, as determined by EC50. However, there was a significant effect of genotype (p <0.0001) on maximum relaxation of uterine arteries in response to acetylcholine. Maximum relaxation of uterine arteries from eNOS -/mice was significantly reduced compared to those from C57BL/6J mice (51\u00b15% vs 97\u00b14%; p<0.05). There was no effect of a high fat diet on this measure. CONCLUSIONS: In agreement with results reported elsewhere, the current study demonstrated a significant impairment of uterine artery relaxation in eNOS -/mice. Although consumption of high fat diet did not further impair uterine artery function, pup growth was impacted. Potential mechanisms include altered placental transport.",

            "text": "A retrospective study on 50 cases of sIUGR in MC twin pregnancies diagnosed on the base of Abdominal Circumference < 10 centile followed in our department, tertiary referral center for fetal medicine, between June 2006 and June 2013. sIUGR cases were classified in three types according to the UA Doppler in the smaller twin: type I with positive end diastolic flow in the UA; type II with stable absent/reverse end diastolic flow (AREDF) in the UA, type III with intermittent AREDF (iAREDF) in the UA. The following perinatal outcomes were analyzed: gestational age at delivery, twin birth weights, weight discordance between twins, occurrence of intrauterine demise, length of stay in neonatal intensive care unit , neonatal mortality rate. RESULTS: during the study period we observed 50 cases of sIUGR: 36 classified as type I, 11 as type II and 3 as type III. In type II and III the birth weight was significantly lower than in type I (p 0.017 for the larger twin and p <0.0001 for the smaller twin) for both twins. Fetal weight discordance was significantly higher in type II and III than in type I and was 19% in type I, 40% in type II and 37% in type III. Progressive fetal doppler deterioration of the IUGR fetus requiring active management was observed in 63.6% (7/11) of type II, in 11.1% (4/36) of type I and in 0% of type III. Unexpected fetal death was observed in 66.7% (2/3) cases of type III. In the type I group we observed two cases (2/36, 5-6%) of unexpected IUD and in four cases (4/11, 36.4%) of type II. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that in sIUGR identified by abdominal circumference <10 th , UA Doppler pattern in the smaller twin is a reliable way to classify MC twins complicated by sIUGR and to predict their perinatal outcome. have shown promise as biomarkers for alcohol use during pregnancy. However, concerns regarding over-sensitivity have led commercial labs to adopt high cutoffs and to require both biomarkers to meet cutoffs before a sample is considered positive. Such adjustments render these biomarkers too conservative for use in detecting lower levels of drinking. This study sought to determine whether sensitivity could be improved by considering EtG and EtS singly. METHODS: Five non-pregnant (confirmed) females age 21-39 were given one, two, and three standard drinks during three separate drinking sessions. Participants provided urine samples at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours after each drinking session. Samples were tested for EtG and EtS by Redwood Toxicology Laborator (California), who reported a sample as positive if EtG was detected at \u2265 100 ng/ml, or if EtS was detected at \u2265 25 ng/ml. RESULTS: All 5 participants tested positive for EtG and for EtS at the 12-hour observation point, after all three drinking phases (1, 2, or 3 standard drinks). At the 24-hour observation, 2 of 5 participants (40%) were positive for both biomarkers after one standard drink; 3 of 5 (60%) were positive for both biomarkers after two standard drinks, and 5 of 5 (100%) were positive for both biomarkers after three standard drinks. There were no positive samples at 36, 48, or 72 hours. No samples were positive for EtG or EtS alone; all were either positive or negative for both. CONCLUSIONS: In a previous study using identical methods, we found that an algorithmic approach to jointly considering levels of EtG and EtS failed to identify T-ace positive women. Given that risky drinking during pregnancy is considered to be in the range of one standard drink per day,a useful biomarker must be sensitive to this level of exposure. Using the cutoff levels currently in place, EtG and EtS appear too conservative to be useful in the detection of risk drinking in pregnancy. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a poorly characterized multifactorial pregnancy outcome that results in babies born with a suboptimal weight and bearing a higher risk for the development of chronic syndromes of mainly cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodevelopmental nature. IUGR is characterized by limited blood perfusion of the placenta leading to hypoxia and exacerbation of oxidative stress. High oxidative stress may affect mitochondria. Alterations of mitochondrial metabolic activity have been associated with IUGR without known genetic background. Recently, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was also shown to undergo methylation supporting data from our preliminary investigations that identified 2 differentially methylated (DMRs) regions (MD1 and MD2) in the mtDNA from IUGR pregnancies. These DMRs are located in the body of the mitochondrial genes 12S rRNA and mtCO2 supporting the hypothesis of an impaired metabolic rate of IUGR placentas.",

            "text": "We set out to test MD1 and MD2 methylation by pyrosequencing, a highly quantitative assay. Placental biopsies were collected from 14 appropriate for gestational age and clinically normal (AGAn) and 11 IUGR (<5 th %) pregnancies. mtDNA was extracted, bisulfite treated and pyrosequenced. Methylation values were analyzed using the Pearson correlation, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Both MD1 and MD2 showed lower mtDNA methylation in IUGR compared to AGAn samples. Specifically, MD1 returned a significant lower methylation (p=0.033) and MD2 a borderline significant lower methylation (p=0.066). When merging the methylation data from MD1 and MD2 the significance was further enhanced (p=0.029). Additionally, a stratification of the IUGR samples into <3 rd % and >3 rd % to <5 th % returned a markedly lower level of methylation for the more severe IUGR samples (<3 rd %) suggesting the existence of a trend. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study supports the hypothesis that mitochondria play a key role in placental functioning and that in IUGR pregnancies they are hypomethylated. This phenomenon can possibly depend from a higher degree of activation of mitochondria intended to counteract the hypoxic condition of IUGR in order to support fetoplacental growth. We are currently working on validating this data by bisulfite sequencing in a more numerous cohort. We have previously shown that adenovirus mediated overexpression of VEGF-A 165 in the uterine arteries (UtAs) of mid-gestation pregnant sheep significantly increases UtA blood flow (~37%) for at least 30 days post-injection, compared with UtAs transduced with a control adenovirus encoding b-galactosidase (Ad.LacZ). This was concomitant with a significant reduction in vascular contractility and significant adventitial neovascularization. Furthermore in guinea pig FGR pregnancy produced by periconceptual maternal nutrient restriction, UtA vector treatment mid-gestation has a tendency to increase fetal weight at term and to improve fetal abdominal growth. Our aim was to study vector spread and expression after Ad.VEGF-A 165 transduction. METHODS: To create FGR, virgin Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs were nutrient restricted peri-conceptually (70% calorie intake) and time mated. A mid-gestation laparotomy was performed, and 1x10 10 viral particles of Ad.VEGF-A 165 or Ad.LacZ were applied to the uterine and radial arteries bilaterally using a thermosensitive pluronic gel. Dams were sacrificed at term, pups weighed and tissues sampled. Vector spread was analysed using PCR, and VEGF expression assessed by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Downstream effects of VEGF expression were also examined using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Ad.VEGF-A 165 transduction was confirmed by PCR in target arteries of Ad.VEGF-A 165 treated animals, but was not detected in any fetal or placental samples. At term, more than four weeks after vector application, VEGF expression was undetectable by ELISA in target uterine and radial arteries, maternal liver, spleen, kidney, heart, adrenal and ovary. By immunohistochemistry expression of VEGF, and VEGF receptor 1 and 2 was also unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: At term, there is no evidence of transgenic VEGF expression in treated animals, and no fetal or maternal spread. The findings are similar to those seen in FGR sheep. This is a localised gene therapy to the uterine and radial arteries, and may thus be appropriate for use during pregnancy to treat FGR. In the fetal lamb, the placenta becomes the main site for EPO synthesis during hypoxia. We have previously shown in type 1 DM patients that the umbilical vein (UV) to UA EPO ratio at birth increases >1 and correlates negatively with the UA pO 2 during fetal chronic hypoxia, suggesting that the placenta increases its EPO synthesis during fetal hypoxia also in humans. Our aim was to measure EPO gene (EPO) and EPO receptor gene (EPOR) expressions in the placenta of women with DM and/or hypertensive pregnancy.",

Since EPO has protective effects in the brain, it is tempting to assume that the fetus increases its EPO synthesis in order to protect its brain during chronic hypoxia. in pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension, which are often fatal. In order to improve clinical care and counseling, reliable prenatal parameters predicting fetal outcome in CDH are urgently needed. Prenatal predictors of fetal outcome in CDH have been reported to be focused mainly on the assessment of fetal lung volume but a gold-standard parameter has not yet been established.

Depressed pregnant women had higher levels of plasma CRP, but no differences urine excretion of ADMA, SDMA, or L-arginine, or plasma levels of Arginase I. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with depression evidence conditionally low levels of arginine. These differences are not explained by urinary excretion or Arginase I levels. The mechanism responsible for the observed differences in L-arginine and ADMA in depressed pregnant women is unclear. Given the link between perinatal depression and adverse pregnancy outcomes we speculate depressed pregnant women may benefit from arginine supplementation. Exosome release may represent a significant communication mechanism between mother and fetus, however, the understanding of their role across the pregnancy remains formative.

METHODS: Analysis of n=138 formerly preeclamptic women in whom plasma volume (PV in ml/m 2 body surface area) was measured (I 125 -human serum albumin indicator dilution method) 6 to 12 months after pregnancy. At the time of the plasma volume measurement all these women were normotensive without the use of antihypertensive medication. Study population was divided into plasma volume quartiles.

Based on the ROC-curve a plasma volume cut-off value of 1314 ml/m 2 resulted in a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity 66.7% in predicting de novo hypertension within 5 years after a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia (Area Under the Curve: 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: Low plasma volume predisposes to chronic hypertension within 5 years after preeclamptic pregnancy. Low plasma volume therefore reflects latent hypertension in these women.",

RESULTS: [Study 1] A total of 41 B-Lynch sutures were performed in 5,489 deliveries (1 per 134). All were done at the time of cesarean section. The indications for sutures were placenta previa in 18 (44%), uterine atony in 15 (37%), placental abruption in 5 (12%), partial placenta accreta in 2 (5%), low lying placenta in 2 (5%) and uterine torsion in 1 (2%). Hysterectomy was avoided in 38 of 41 women (92.7%). In 2 cases, both involving partial placenta accreta by histological examination, hysterectomy was unavoidable. [Study 2] Among the 21 women who answered the questionnaire, there were neither complaints of menstrual irregularities nor severe dysmenorrhea. Excluding women with voluntary contraception, 11 out of 18 (61.1%) had subsequent 13 pregnancies without requiring assisted reproductive procedures. The results of the pregnancies were 8 uncomplicated term pregnancies all delivered by elective cesarean section, 2 artificial abortions and 3 miscarriages. Of the 18 women who desired pregnancy after B-Lynch sutures, those who were younger than 35 years at the time of B-Lynch suture had a significantly higher rate of subsequent pregnancy (10 out of 12, 83.3%) compared with those who were 35 years or older (1 out of 6, 16.7%) (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: B-Lynch compression suture for PPH is an effective conservative surgical method to avoid hysterectomy. Currently, there are no complications including infertility.

RESULTS: IHC demonstrates that TNFa and IL-10 positive cells are localized in the rat mesometrial triangle (MT) at both gestational ages. Milliplex Protein Assay revealed a significant increase in the levels of TNFa at GD18 in the HFD uterine tissue compared to control diet rat uterine tissue. Human trophoblast invasion assays revealed that serum from obese women with IUGR outcomes reduced the capacity of trophoblast to invade compared to serum from normal weight with healthy fetal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal obesity induces a pro-inflammatory uterine environment in our obese rat model which is associated with reduced fetal growth and reduced trophoblast invasion. A human cell line treated with serum from an obese pregnancy with IUGR demonstrated reduced trophoblast invasion. These findings suggest that obesity influences uterine immune environment and has the capacity to alter trophoblast invasion in rats. In humans, factors in serum from obese pregnant women can also influence trophoblast invasion, suggesting that obesity has the potential to disrupt normal trophoblast physiology and ultimately altering fetal growth potential.

At 20 days of gestation, pregnant rats were sacrificed and the placentae collected. Real-time PCR was used to measure mRNA levels of inflammatory proteins known to be regulated by the transcription factor, NF-kB, which is the intracellular mediator of TLR signaling. Expression of downstream TLR adaptor proteins was determined by Western blot. RESULTS: Our preliminary data reveal a marked increase in the protein expression of MYD88, an adaptor molecule of TLR signaling, in HF dams compared to C (p < .05). TLR-4 mRNA levels were increased 2.5 fold (p < .05) in the placentae of HF dams, while there was no difference in the mRNA expression of TLR-2. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA levels were increased 9.4 fold in the placenta of HF dams compared to C (p < .05). Relative to C, placentae of HF dams displayed a trend toward increased mRNA levels (1.7 fold) of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), another downstream target of TLRs and an enzyme responsible for the formation of prostanoids such as prostaglandin and thromboxane. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that increased expression of TLR-4 and activation of TLR signaling accompanies placental inflammation under conditions of chronic maternal intake of a high fat diet. Next, we aim to confirm that TLR-4 mediates placental inflammation and to determine if FAs and oxidized lipoproteins are the ligands that activate TLR-4 signaling in the placenta. Specifically, these studies were performed using in vitro cultures of human uterine myocytes. Control and stimulated cells (containing 1 -100 ng/ mL of LPS) were incubated in 6-well plates for 12, 24, and 48 hours. Subsequently, the cell homogenate underwent ELISA analysis for the IL-6 cytokine production. Cells stimulated with 100 ng/mL of LPS were also analyzed for TLR4 inhibition with CLI-095 (a TLR4 receptor blocker). These cells underwent ELISA analysis for both the IL-6 and MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein). Western Blotting was utilized to confirm TLR4 protein expression. RESULTS: Based on multiple sets of experiments, these studies demonstrated significantly increased expression of IL-6 after 12, 24, and 48 hours (p<0.05) in the culture cell homogenate. Significantly increased expression of IL-6 was also demonstrated with increasing concentration of LPS at 1ng/mL, 10ng/mL and 100ng/mL (p<0.05). When TLR4 is blocked by CLI-095, the IL-6 (p<0.05) and MCP-1 expression is significantly reduced compared to the controlled cells after 48 hours. Western Blotting also visually confirmed the detection of TLR4 protein within these cells. These data are consistent with the presence of functional TLR4 receptors on the surface of human smooth muscle myocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These studies have confirmed a direct innate immune response by uterine smooth muscle myocytes; a response that potentially contributes to the mechanisms leading to infection and inflammation associated preterm delivery. The underlying cause of recurrent miscarriages (RM) remains unexplained in 50-75% after diagnostic tests. A multifactorial etiology, including uterine anomalies, endocrine and metabolic factors, maternal autoimmune disorders and thrombophilia, toxic factors (smoking and alcohol) and genetics is assumed. Currently it is still unclear what specific genes are involved. Many hypothesis-based candidate gene studies have been performed to identify involved polymorphisms. The aim of this study was to create an overview of the genetic variants that are reproducibly associated with RM.",

Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. RESULTS: Swan 71 cells had greater baseline ISG15 mRNA concentrations than ACH-3P cells. Culture with IFN (0.1, 1 and 10 ng/ ml) increased Swan 71 and ACH-3P cell ISG15 mRNA concentrations by ~3-fold and ~20-fold, respectively. SWAN 71 and ACH-3P cells had detectable IL6 mRNA concentrations, but IL6 was not affected by culture with IFN. Likewise culture of these cells with IL6 had no effect on ISG mRNA concentrations. IFN-induced signal transducers and other ISGs were examined to confirm induction by IFN. The response of ACH-3P cells to activation by IFN was more robust than the response in Swan 71 cells. In ACH-3P cells cultured with IFN, mRNA concentrations were up-regulated for signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 & 2, interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 7 and 9 (but not IRF3) and ISGs in addition to ISG15: Dead (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide (DDX58; aka RIG-I) and IFN induced with helicase C (IFIH1; aka MDA5). CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that human trophoblast cells are able to respond to IFN through induction of ISGs. The present studies implicate IFN in the induction of ISGs in trophoblast cell lines derived from firsttrimester placenta. IL6 appears not to be involved with induction of ISGs or IFN signal transduction genes in human trophoblast cells. IL6 may induce pathways and responses that are distinct from IFN, which could be predicted based on action through a G-protein coupled receptor, rather than a JAK/STAT coupled receptor. Regardless, these studies provide support to the suggestion that IFN and ISGs are induced and contribute to maternal-placental interactions during the establishment of human pregnancy.

However, urgent transition of the respiratory and circulatory systems from fetal to neonatal life frequently expose them to critical respiratory and circulatory insufficiencies. Development of a pumpless artificial placenta may provide a potential alternative therapy to mechanical ventilation. Previous studies suggest that minimizing placental circuit resistance without compromising gas exchanging is essential to the development of this technology. To achieve these requirements, we developed the parallelized oxygenator circuit system. The aim of the current study was to compare the efficacy of a parallel circuit with a single oxygenator circuit using preterm lambs. METHODS: Pregnant Suffolk sheep underwent surgical delivery at 109-135 d gestation (term 147 d). Fetuses were exteriorized and two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein were cannulated. In the parallelized circuit group (n=6), each arterial catheter was connected to one oxygenator separately with both outlet ends connected to the venous catheter. In the single circuit group (n=5), both arterial catheters were connected to one single oxygenator. Lambs were then delivered, submerged in a saline bath (39.5\u00b0C), and monitored until 60 hours after birth. Physiological parameters and blood chemical and gas data were recorded, and then compared for statistically significant differences between groups. RESULTS: Gestational age (mean \u00b1 SD) at delivery was significantly lower (130 \u00b1 1.6 vs. 113 \u00b1 1.1 d, p<0.05), survival time was longer (18.2 \u00b1 3.2 vs. 53.7 \u00b1 4.4 h, p<0.05), arterial pH was higher (7.24 \u00b1 0.02 vs.7.45 \u00b1 0.04, p<0.05), and minimum lactate level was lower (120.5 \u00b1 33.5 vs. 36.4 \u00b1 11.0 mg/dL, p<0.05) in the parallel group, compared with that in the single group. There were no significant differences in PO 2 , PCO 2 , circuit flow, circuit resistance, mean arterial pressure, and central venous pressure between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Fetuses maintained on a parallelized oxygenator circuit showed remarkable improvements in essential physiological parameters. These data suggest that a parallelized oxygenator circuit improves the performance of a pumpless artificial placenta. We have proposed that, given the strong correlation between angiogenesis and neurogenesis, the placental chorionic vascular surface network, laid down principally by the mid trimester, would differ in structure in the context of autism, a disorder of neuronal connectivity.

Data were stratified into intrauterine growth restriction with or without hypertensive disease and pathological characteristics were compared between these various conditions according to predefined scoring criteria. RESULTS: Among 164 placentas studied, we found high rates of characteristic histopathological features that were associated with intrauterine growth restriction, including infarction (>5% in 42%), chronic villitis (21%), chronic inflammation of membranes (36%), membrane necrosis (20%), elevated nucleated red blood cells (89%), increased syncytial knotting (93%), increased villous maturation (98%), fetal thrombosis (32%) and distal villous hypoplasia (35%). Chronic inflammation of fetal membranes and syncytial knotting were more common in women with concomitant hypertensive disease as compared to women with normotensive IUGR (p <0.05). Placentas from women with umbilical artery AREDF were more likely to show increased numbers of nucleated red blood cells and distal villous hypoplasia (p <0.05).

Total RNA from placental villous tissue was extracted using TRIzol reagent and RNA quality and quantity were assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. miRNA expression was determined by Affymetric GeneChip 2.0 miRNA Array platform, which detects a set of 1,105 mature human miRNA transcripts. miRNA expression profiles were then analyzed by GenSifter and miRNA associated gene networks were analyzed by Ingenuity. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was also performed on selected miRNAs and U6 (small nuclear RNA) expression was determined as the internal control for each sample. RESULTS: A total of 42 miRNAs with > 2-fold up-regulation or > 2-fold down-regulation with a 95% significance (p<0.05) was identified between normal and PE placentas. Among them, 6 miRNAs were up-regulated and 36 miRNAs were down-regulated in PE placentas compared to normal placentas. In PE placentas, up-regulated miRNAs include miR-210 and miR-33b, and down-regulated miRNAs include miR-488, miR-155, miR-221, and miR-510, etc. Moreover, among the 36 down-regulated miRNAs in PE placentas, 6 of them belong to the miR-548 family. They are miR-548a,miR-548c, miR-548u, miR-548x, miR-570, and miR-603. Ingenuity analysis showed that all of the down-regulated miR-548 miRNAs are designated to the network pathway 1, which links to genes such as TP53, NFkB, PTPRM (phosphatase), and BAP1 (peptidase), etc. Increased miR-210 expression and decreased miR-548c and miR-488 expression in PE placentas were confirmed by qRT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Different miRNA expression profiles were identified between normal and PE placentas. Since down-regulation of miR-548c was found to be a signature in leukocytes from cardiomyopathy patients, down-regulation of miR-548 family miRNA expression is expected to play an important role in the placental dysfunction in PE. Hypoxia plays an important role in placental trophoblast differentiation and function during early pregnancy. Hypoxiainducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1a) regulates cellular adaption to hypoxic conditions in the early pregnancy. However, our current understanding of the role of HIF1a in trophoblast physiology is far from complete. Metastasis Associated Protein 1 and 3 (MTA1 and MTA3) are highly expressed in term placental trophoblasts. The role of MTA1 and MTA3 in the hypoxic placental environment of early pregnancy is unknown.",

Furthermore, we over-expressed MTA1 and MTA3 in HTR8/SVneo cells and investigated their effect on HIF1a expression. RESULTS: We found that MTA1 and MTA3 were co-localized with HIF1a in the placental trophoblast of 1st trimester placenta, suggesting the potential roles of MTA1 and MTA3 in the hypoxic environment of early pregnancy. Next, we found that hypoxia treatment induced MTA1, MTA3 and HIF1a in trophoblast cells in the protein level. Last, we found that overexpression of MTA1 and MTA3 up-regulated HIF1a level after hypoxia treatment in trophoblast. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, induced by hypoxic treatment, both MTA1 and MTA3 regulate HIF1a expression in trophoblasts, suggesting that MTA1 and MTA3 are critical in the hypoxia response cascade in the placental trophoblast of early pregnancy.

Formerly preeclamptic women (fPE) have an increased risk for end stage renal disease. It is unknown whether this is caused by PE itself, or by common risk factors. Sparse data show that hypertensive fPE have abnormalities in renal hemodynamics, as a possible pathway for renal risk. We hypothesized that also healthy normotensive women with a history of early-onset PE have an unfavorable renal hemodynamic profile. As renal hemodynamics are closely linked with sodium homeostasis, we studied this in relation to sodium intake. METHODS: We studied 18 fPE and 18 controls (age: 36\u00b15 y), all normotensive without co-morbidity, during low sodium (LS; 50 mmol Na + /d) and high sodium intake (HS; 200 mmol Na + /d). At the end of each diet week, MAP and renal hemodynamics (glomerular filtration rate (GFR, 125 I-iothalamate clearance), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF, 131 I-hippuran clearance), filtration fraction (FF; GFR/ERPF)) were measured at baseline and during graded angiotensin II infusion (ang II). RESULTS: Although HS induced a higher MAP in both groups (p<0.001), no differences in MAP were found at baseline between fPE and controls (LS: 83\u00b17 vs 81\u00b18 mmHg; HS: 85\u00b18 vs 86\u00b19 mmHg, p>0.3). Also during ang II, MAP was not significantly different between the groups (p>0.2). fPE showed a significantly higher FF during HS compared to LS, while controls did not. Moreover, FF in fPE tended to be higher compared to controls during HS (fig 1) . During ang II on HS, the difference in FF between the groups was even more pronounced. Change in FF during HS was independent of MAP (r=0.1;p=0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Normotensive fPE women without co-morbidity show abnormalities in renal hemodynamics elicited by HS, suggesting PE itself induces renal abnormalities. It could be hypothesized that dietary sodium restriction has the potential to prevent part of the renal risk after PE.",

INTRODUCTION: Gene delivery and cytokine injection after conception have been used to generate preeclampsia (PE) model mice. However, these model mice cannot be used to investigate the beginning of PE pathogenesis because early pregnancy is a critical period for PE pathogenesis. It is known that the CD40 ligand (CD40L) is expressed on T cells and regulates the immune system, including helper T cells. CD40L also plays an important role in the antigen-antibody interaction.

Immunohistochemical techniques were used to confirm cellular expression of TSC22 protein. To understand functional role of this gene in reproductive organs, TSC22 gene knockout mice were developed and analysed. RESULTS: Examination of TSC22 expression in embryonic tissues revealed strong expression of TSC22 mRNA in gonads (both sexes) and M\u00fcllerian duct (a precursor of female reproductive tract organs). TSC22 protein was highly expressed in adult ovary, oviduct and uterus. In ovary, TSC22 protein was detected in granulosa cells at all the stages of follicular development and corpus luteum. In oviduct, TSC22 protein was mainly localized in epithelial cells. In contrast, its expression was limited to the stromal cells of the uterus. Female reproductive tracts of TSC22 knockout mice were smaller compared to controls. Nonetheless, younger TSC22 mutant female mice showed no appreciable defects in their fertility. We are planning to examine reproductive functions of aged TSC22 mutant and control mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that TSC22, a novel tumour suppressor gene, is uniquely expressed in embryonic and adult reproductive organs in mice. The reproductive organs of TSC22 knockout mice were smaller but showed no obvious pathologies. Other three family members (Gilz, Thg1 and KIAA0669) might compensate for TSC22 in mutant mice. INTRODUCTION: Uterine receptivity and implantation require a complex cascade of endocrine and paracrine interactions. In particular, angiogenesis is critical to support placental vascularization and modulation of proinflammatory cytokines must occur to avert miscarriage. Previous studies from our laboratories have established that the gap junction protein connexin (Cx) 43 is induced by decidualization and plays an important role in the maintenance of endometrial angiogenesis and differentiation. METHODS: Human endometrial stromal cell cultures were prepared from proliferative-phase eutopic biopsies of fertile participants using established methods. The cells were induced to undergo decidualization by exposure to 10 nM estradiol, 100 nM progesterone and 0.5 mM cAMP (E/P/c). Gap junctions, measured by Western blotting, were inhibited by 50 mM 18a-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGA), 1.5 mM octanol or Cx43 shRNA. Cx43 overexpression was induced by recombinant vector transfection. VEGF and IL-6 mRNA and protein were quantified by qRT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: VEGF mRNA and protein expression were upregulated >2-fold after treatment with E/P/c, and these were inhibited by 50-75% when co-incubated with AGA, octanol or Cx 43 shRNA. Cx43 overexpression vectors increased steady-state Cx43 protein levels 5-fold and caused a 15-fold increase in secreted VEGF, even in the absence of E/P/c. By contrast, gap junction interference upregulated IL-6 >2-fold, whereas Cx43 overexpression prevented IL-6 production. All results were statistically significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In decidualized human endometrial stromal cells, pharmacological inhibition of gap junctions or genetic ablation of Cx43 expression prevented hormone-induced stromal differentiation, reduced VEGF and increased IL-6 secretion. By contrast, overexpression of Cx43 protein upregulated stromal cell VEGF secretion and prevented IL-6 production in the absence of decidualizing hormones. These combined results support the hypothesis that gap junctions, and the low molecular weight metabolites that traverse them, are both necessary and sufficient to sustain these biomarkers of decidualization.

Although the epithelial layer has the greatest contact with the external environment and is the initial site of embryo adhesion, the underlying stromal cells provide critical mesenchymal and vascular support and regulate the uterine mucosa via paracine factors. We have focused on stromal cells as integrators of physiological and pathophysiological endometrial proliferation. METHODS: Primary human endometrial stromal cell cultures were prepared from proliferative-phase eutopic biopsies of cycling, fertile participants using established methods. Cells were treated in vitro with physiological concentrations of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) to mimic hormone replacement. Under some conditions, cAMP was added to promote decidualization. Cell proliferation was estimated using a tetrazolium dye (MTS) absorption assay and flow cytometry was used to quantify chromosome copy number as a marker of cell cycle dynamics. Expression of PCNA and cleaved caspase 3 proteins were detected by Western blotting. Telomere length was precisely determined using realtime qPCR that simultaneously compared amplified telomeres to singlecopy human 36B4 gene sequences. Different hormone conditions were compared by ANOVA with Fisher's PLSD for post hoc analyses. P<0.05 was accepted as significant. RESULTS: E2 stimulated proliferation, as indicated by MTS and PCNA. By contrast, E2+P4+cAMP x 7 d reduced apoptosis, based on caspase 3 and sub-G1 flow cytometry. Mean\u00b1SE stromal cell telomere length (6670\u00b1141 bp) increased progressively and was maximal (10485\u00b1396 bp) with 10 nM E2 for 7 d. E2+P4+cAMP also yielded long telomeres (10282\u00b1933 bp, P<0.05 compared to control), whereas combinations of E2+P4 resulted in slightly shorter telomere lengths (9066\u00b1131 bp). CONCLUSIONS: Primary human endometrial cell cultures provide a useful model to study endocrine regulation of the cell cycle, including proliferation, apoptosis and telomere modification, relevant to aspects of endometriosis, hormone therapy and endometrial hyperplasia and carcinogenesis. Supported by NIH grant U01HD66439. Ectopic pregnancies represent 1-2% of all pregnancies and are a medical emergency. Current methotrexate protocols can resolve smaller ectopic pregnancies (pretreatment serum hCG <3000 IU/L), but its efficacy decreases with larger ectopic pregnancies. Therefore, only 25-30% of ectopic pregnancies are suitable for medical therapy and most are treated surgically. Placenta is critically dependent on Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signalling. We recently reported preclinical and phase I studies suggesting combination methotrexate and gefitinib (orally available EGFR inhibitor) may be safe and efficacious in resolving ectopic pregnancies, with potentially better efficacy than methotrexate. We set out to undertake a phase II study, treating women with larger ectopic pregnancies with combination methotrexate and gefitinib.",

Primary outcomes was whether or not the treatment resolved the ectopic pregnancy. We also obtained data on time to cure and safety.The sample size provides power to show a success rate of 90%, and efficacy >70%. RESULTS: So far, we have recruited 18 participants. Treatment is ongoing for 1 participant, meaning 17 cases were available for analysis. The median pretreatment (25-75th centiles) serum hCG levels was 2033 IU/L (1578-2834). 4 had a pretreatment hCG >3000 IU/L and the highest pretreatment hCG was 7551 IU/L. 15 were successfully treated (2 required surgery), giving an interim rate of success of 88% (15/17). The median (25-75th centiles) time to resolution was 30 days (25-39). The treatment was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Recruiting is ongoing.

Department of Biology, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Mitochondria are critical for many aspects of cell function. The human mitochondrial genome itself encodes only 37 proteins, and thus the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes. Although mitochondria are often viewed as rather 'generic\" across cell types, cell lineage-specific functions of mitochondria have been reported. However, it is unclear if different functions of mitochondria in different cells, including eggs which rely on mitochondrial function for successful fertilization and embryogenesis, are due to differences in nuclear-encoded genes transported into mitochondria.",

Kisspeptin, the neuropeptide product of the Kiss1 gene, has a critical role in driving the hypothalamic-gonadal-pituitary (HPG) axis and fertility. Kisspeptin neurons are most abundant in the hypothalamus, particularly in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and arcuate nucleus (Arc). These two populations mediate differential effects, with the Arc regulating negative feedback of sex steroids, and the AVPV regulating positive feedback. The latter is responsible for stimulating the preovulatory LH surge in females, and is consequently under circadian control. Little is known about the role or regulation hypothalamic Kiss1 during pregnancy. We aimed to characterise hypothalamic Kiss1 and Kiss1r mRNA expression in pregnant and nonpregnant mice, and determine whether it is under circadian control. METHODS: Using C57BL/6J mice, brains were collected at six circadian time points: 8am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm, 12am, 4am at diestrus and proestrus of non-pregnant animals, and days 6, 10, 14 and 18 of pregnancy. Hypothalami were dissected into anterior (containing the AVPV) and posterior (containing the Arc) regions. mRNA levels for target genes Kiss1 and Kiss1r, as well as reference genes, were analysed using quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Analyses confirmed Kiss1 mRNA expression in the AVPV and Arc; quantitative assessment showed no indication of circadian regulation at diestrus or any of the pregnancy time points. During proestrus however, Kiss1 expression increased (2-fold; P<0.05) from 4pm to 8pm, coincident with the occurrence of the LH surge. Similarly, Kiss1r was detectable in both the anterior and posterior hypothalamus at all stages and time points; some variability was observed, however no clear circadian pattern was established. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data are the first to show Kiss1 and Kiss1r expression in the maternal brain during pregnancy. The absence of circadian regulation of Kiss1 during pregnancy, in spite of high estradiol levels, may indicate a disruption of the normal circadian rhythm that operates in the non-pregnant state. Telomeres are non-coding tandem repeats that protect the ends of chromosomes and promote structural integrity. Shortened telomere lengths have been associated with adverse outcomes in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology. However, methods used to measure telomere lengths vary in accuracy and can be subject to misinterpretation.",

Thus, unbalances in maternal pro-and anti-inflammatory status can lead to pregnancy disorders. Here, we identified myeloid cell populations in blood and decidua at various gestational ages (GA) and compared phenotypes and distributions in syn-and allogeneic pregnancies. METHODS: Female FVB/N (q haplotype) were mated with FVB/N (syngeneic, n=12) or BALB/c (d haplotype, allogeneic, n=4) male mice. Blood and deciduas were collected at E9.5,10.5, and 11.5. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, myeloid cells in maternal blood and uterine natural killer (uNK) cells in decidua were identified by cell size and surface markers: neutrophils (CD11b + Gr-1 Hi ), monocytes/macrophages (CD11b + Gr-1 Lo ), NK cells (NKp46 + CD122 + ), uNK cells (DBA + ). Phenotypes were typed by expression of CD68, CD11C, CD14, F4/80, CD115, CD206, etc. Cell distributions were expressed as percentages of total CD45 + leukocytes. RESULTS: In syngeneic pregnancies, significantly more neutrophils (23.8 vs 12.5%, p<0.001) and monocytes (5.1 vs 3.7%, p<0.01) were found at E9.5-11.5 vs non-pregnant control blood. NK cells, used as non-myeloid controls, showed no change at all GAs. In allogeneic pregnancies, neutrophils were significant lower (15.5 vs 23.8%, p<0.001) than syngeneic pregnancies, while monocytes were not different. In the placenta, total number of myeloid and uNK cells were 70-80% of all decidual leukocytes. At E9.5-11.5, these populations displayed dynamic changes. CD11b + cells (neutrophils, macrophage, dendritic cells) decreased (50-25%), while uNK cells increased (20-45%). At E11.5, allogeneic deciduas had more uNK cells (60%) and less myeloid cells (12.5%) than syngeneic deciduas (45% and 25%, respectively).",

Obstetrics and Gynecology, College of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. INTRODUCTION:Long-acting progestin only contraceptives (LAPCs)associated abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) occurs intermittently and focally from irregularly distributed superficial, enlarged, thin-walled capillaries and venules. The cellular mechanisms of these irregular changes are unknown with the exception of abnormal angiogenesis. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) maintain vascular tone. We hypothesize that LAPC suppressed VSMC proliferation and differentiation produce thin-walled and hyperdilated vasculature. METHODS: Cultured VSMCs were processed for whole genome gene microarray analyses using Illumina Human microarray kit and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. In vitro effects of LAPCs medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, 10 -7 M), and etonogestrel (ETO, 10 -7 M) were investigated on VSMC proliferation using BrdU incorporation. PCNA and a-SMA double-labeling immunohistochemistry assessed in vivo differentiation and proliferation of VSMC in paired-endometrial tissues from women preand post-DepoProvera (depo) use (n=6) and in endometrium from guinea pigs (GPs) treated with vehicle (n=3) or MPA (n=3) pellets for 49 days and from oophorectomized-(OVX-) GPs treated with E2 (n=6) or E2+MPA (n=6) pellets for 21 days. Relevant statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: Endometrial vasculature in women post-Depo administration revealed fewer a-SMA positive cells and decreased PCNA immunoreactivity among a-SMA cells. Microarray analyses revealed several genes that were altered by MPA or ETO, including increased TMEM119, which suppresses myoblast differentiation and decreased RARRES1, which induces proliferation. VSMCs treated with MPA or ETO displayed reduced BrdU incorporation (p<0.01). Fewer PCNA (+) endometrial VSMCs were present in MPA treated GPs determined by a-SMA double-staining vs vehicle treated GPs (p<0.05). Similarly, fewer PCNA (+) endometrial VSMCs were present in E2+MPA-treated OVX-GPs vs E2-treated OVX-GPs (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: LACP mediated inhibition of endometrial VSMC differentiation, proliferation and/or migration results in insufficient VSMCs to cover and control tone of newly formed vessels. The resulting generation of naked, hyperdilated, thin-walled vessels explains AUB in the endometrium of LACP users.T-261A Sixth Sense: Does Subjective Assessment of Menstrual Bleeding Correlate with Measures of Anemia amongst African American Women (AAW)?

Our objective is to investigate whether Lgr5 is also a marker for a mesoderm niche such as the human endometrium and to perform wide genome analysis of endometrial Lgr5+ cells to identify gene signature and surrogate candidate markers for endometrial somatic stem cells (SSC). METHODS: Human endometrial biopsies (n=12) were obtained after patient's written informed consent. Cells were stained with Rabbit Anti-GPR49/LGR5 (Novus Biologicals) and a secondary FITC-coupled antibody (Life Technologies). The Lgr5 population was isolated via cell sorting (MoFlo, Dako). Lgr5 + cells from both fractions were hybridized on the Human GE 4x44K v2 Microarray (Agilent Technologies). Data was analyzed by the GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Molecular Devices) and results were validated via RT-PCR analysis.

Wide genome analysis of these cells revealed the existence of 604 up-and 59 down-regulated genes in the Lgr5+ stromal fraction and 479 up-and 554 down-regulated genes in the epithelial, among others the top three up-regulated genes were shared by Lgr5+ cells from both compartments: IL1B, C1QB and CSF1R.",

Analysis of conditioned media revealed that SP induced secretion of pro-inflammatory and pro-chemotactic cytokines, as well as pro-angiogenic and proliferative growth factors (P<0.05). Conditioned media from SP-treated cells significantly increased (P<0.05) chemotaxis of CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ T cells. Exposure to fresh semen induced similar sets of pathways in eEC and eSF. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that SP induces pathways associated with promoting immune cell recruitment and viability of eEC, eSF, and potentially other endometrial cells. Furthermore, SP and fresh semen induce similar sets of genes and related pathways, validating the use of SP to understand the effects of semen on the female reproductive tract.

RESULTS: PGN+poly(I:C)-treatment led to decreased expression of chaperones Hsp90, Hsp60 and Hsp25, and decreased lysosome marker Lamp2A in uterus and placenta, and increased cell death in uterus and placenta. CONCLUSIONS: PGN+poly(I:C) treatment leading to preterm delivery may interfere with the normal progression of CMA and lysosome function in uterus and placenta by decreasing tissue levels of LAMP2A and Hsp90.

Ob Gyn, CWHR, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN, USA.INTRODUCTION: Uterine fibroids are benign tumors originating from the myometrium with a higher incidence in African American premenopausal women. They are estrogen dependent and the enhanced sensitivity to estrogen has been shown via an increase in estrogen binding sites. Lately, new theories have evolved based on the isolation and tumor initiating characteristics of somatic stem cells in fibroids and adjacent myometrium to help in understanding the pathophysiology of uterine fibroids. The aim of this study is to investigate estrogen responsive element transactivation in stems cells from normal uterine myometrium (MyoN), uterine fibroids (F), and adjacent myometrium (MyoF).METHODS: Stem cells were isolated based on surface antigen CD44& STRO1 from fibroids (F), corresponding myometrium tissue (MyoF) and myometrium from normal uteri (fibroid-free) (MyoN) from women undergoing hysterectomy. All human research procedure was approved by Meharry IRB. The stem cells along with matched primary cells were transduced with Ad-ERE-luc, an adenoviral reporter vector carrying two copies of the estrogen-responsive element (ERE) upstream of luciferase reporter, at 10pfu for 5 hours and swapped with fresh media containing estradiol at concentrations of 10 -6 , -8 and -10 M for 48 hours. In another experiment Ad-ERE-luc and Ad-ERa (estrogen receptor alpha) at 10pfu was transduced into MyoF and MyoN stem cells. Luciferase activity was measured using luciferase enzyme assay systems, according to the supplier's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out for ERa gene expression in the three distinct stem cells and corresponding primary cells. RESULTS: Expression of ERE activity was significantly lower in the stem cells from MyoF and MyoN in comparison to corresponding primary cells (P<0.05). Introduction of ERa significantly increased the ERE-luc transactivation activity in these stem cells (P<0.05). RT-PCR evaluation showed higher expression of ERa in MyoF stem cells than in MyoN and F stem cells (P<0.05). Overall, primary MyoF and F cells showed a greater expression of ERa in comparison to corresponding stem cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that estrogen receptor a expression is in a dynamic state in stem cells and may be modified by exogenous influences. Further investigations are required to establish the role of steroid hormone signaling in myometrial stem cells and its potential role in fibroid formation. NIH/NICHD R01 HD046228.",

They are confronted with demand for PCC and the majority of GP's and midwifes point out the availability of PCC in daily care. Actual PCC consultations, however, are scarce. All 3 professionals have positive perceptions regarding PCC. Identified prerequisites for delivery of PCC in the future were effective recruitment strategies, more evidence for PCC and more knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Despite numerous efforts to offer PCC, actual delivery of PCC by is still small scale. As attitudes towards PCC are positive, meeting identified prerequisites could potentiate delivery at a larger scale. F-257 Ethnic Disparities in the Optimal Timing for Induction of Labor.

Center for Reproductive Biology, Department of Animal Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA. INTRODUCTION: The uterus is a remarkably resilient organ with tremendous regenerative capacity. Mechanisms coordinating regeneration of the endometrium during the menstrual/estrous cycle and following parturition are poorly understood, but likely involve resident stem (and/ or progenitor) cells. Current techniques employed to assess endometrial stem cell qualities include in vitro assays, characterization by stem-cell markers or label-retention, and engraftment of endometrial cells under the renal capsule. The objective of this study was to develop an orthotopic transplantation model to assess endometrial stem cell qualities in vivo.enlarged with time indicative of clonal expansion within the tissue. Donor cells derived from early postnatal endometrial tissue had greater engraftment efficiency and resulted in larger engraftment sites compared to adult donor cells. Daughter cells derived from donor epithelial and stromal cells expressed epithelial and mesenchymal cell markers, as well as steroid hormone receptors. Importantly, the function of engrafted cells was maintained following transplantation. For example, the response of engrafted cells to estrogen and initiation of decidualization was indistinguishable from responses observed in endogenous recipient cells.Molecular Evidence of Endometrial Mesenchymal Stem Cell Differentiation to Stromal Fibroblasts In Vitro Reveals Altered Molecular Phenotype in Endometriosis.Juan Irwin, 1 Fatima Barragan, 1 Terhi Piltonen, 2 Ttrimble Spitzer, 1 David Erikson, 1 Linda Giudice.

Urinary excretion of [ 14 C]HPC and labeled metabolites was 0.3% of the dose from 0-24 h, 0.8% from 24-48 h, and 1.0% from 144-168 h. HPLC analysis showed 32-40% of the radioactivity to be associated with very polar metabolite(s) presumably related to the caproic acid. 40-53% of the radioactivity was associated with hydroxylated metabolites. No unchanged [ 14 C]HPC was present. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatocyte studies indicated rabbit as a reasonable species for evaluating HPC metabolism. Parent HPC comprised 9-16% of the radioactivity in plasma. Low amounts of radioactivity and no intact HPC were detected in urine. The primary metabolites are mono-, di-and tri-hydroxylated forms of HPC, with most hydroxylation occurring on the caproate chain. A human study is underway. Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of infectious neonatal morbidity and mortality in the United States, yet the mechanism by which GBS interacts with the gestational membranes has not yet been elucidated. Recently, we demonstrated in a two-compartment in vitro model of extraplacental membranes that GBS inoculation on the decidual side of the membranes stimulates expression of human beta defensin (HBD)-2 in the amnion epithelial cells. Here, we test our hypothesis that HBD-2 increases in the amnion epithelial cells are mediated by a secreted cytokine produced by the choriodecidual tissue. METHODS: Human extraplacental membranes were collected from healthy, non-emergency, non-laboring cesarean sections. Membranes were blunt-dissected to remove the amnion from the choriodecidua. The etiology of preterm birth (PTB) includes factors such as infection, placental hemorrhage and stress. Existing tests have poor performance and are limited in utility, especially in nulliparous patients. Thus, there is a compelling need to identify biomarkers of PTB to enable interventions for patients at risk. METHODS: The Proteomic Assessment of Preterm Risk clinical trial (11 sites) enrolled 5500 patients representative of the US population. We employed a 2-phase discovery strategy(Fig 1). First, candidate protein biomarkers were assembled by both hypothesis dependent database query and a fi rst-pass shotgun proteomics discovery effort. Second, a single MRM-MS assay was developed to quantify over 200 candidate biomarkers in serum samples from approximately 90 PTB cases and 180 controls. Univariate p-values and AUROC values were calculated. Multivariate classifi er performance using panels of signifi cant analytes was assessed by a bootstrap method with LASSO and Random Forest models.RESULTS:Univariate analysis of the MRM-MS discovery studies identifi ed analytes amongst multiple functional pathways of relevance to PTB, with immune response highly represented(Table 1, DAVID Software). Multivariate classifi ers demonstrated a highly statistically signifi cant separation of cases and controls in these training models. CONCLUSIONS: Our strategy for identifi cation of biomarkers enabled greater predictive power than obtained from clinical characteristics alone and revealed functional pathways important to the etiology of PTB. Once classifi ers have been fi nalized, their performance will be assessed in follow-up validation studies. The offspring of low-income families have disproportionately high rates of growth restriction, preterm birth and neonatal mortality. Little is known about the underlying biological mechanisms responsible for these disparities. Recently, methods have been developed and validated for measuring gene expression patterns in living fetuses via amniotic fl uid. By measuring gene expression patterns in amniotic fl uid, we aim to discern whether SES affects the early stages of fetal development.METHODS:Pregnant women referred for amniocentesis at a community hospital associated with an academic medical center are recruited prior to amniocentesis. Inclusion criteria include maternal age > 18, singleton pregnancy, and gestational age < 24 weeks. Patients complete a series of validated questionnaires regarding socioeconomic conditions, acute and chronic stressors, depressed mood and lifestyle variables. Electronic records are queried for medical history and neonatal outcomes. Amniotic fluid is obtained and centrifuged, and residual supernatants are collected for extraction of cell-free RNA and downstream gene expression.Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (\u03c9-3PUFA) Induce OxidativeStress in a Mouse Model of Preterm Delivery.

INTRODUCTION:Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including trappin-2/ elafin and cathelicidin, are a first line defense peptides released from epithelial cells in response to pathogens. Vit D also plays an integral role in the acquired and innate immune responses and a correlation between Vit D deficiency and infection is well established. However, the cellular impact of Vit D on AMPs in the reproductive tract has not been fully defined. We hypothesize that pregnant women at risk of SPTB express altered AMPs profiles and that this may be linked to Vit D deficiency and existing inflammation/infection. The aim of this study was to describe AMP expression in a human endocervical cell line (END1/E6E7) and determine the impact of Vit D in the presence and absence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1b and the bacterial product LPS on AMP profiles.

Our long-term goal is to assess neonatal outcomes following U.parvum IAI and AZI therapy, with emphasis on neurobehavioral & cognitive development and pulmonary function. This initial study will 1) focus on expanding the scope of newborn infant care at the ONPRC to enable survival of prematurely born rhesus, 2) develop critical care management plans to ensure optimal chance of neonatal survival, and 3) assess the feasibility of neonatal survival following U.parvum IAI in the NHP. METHODS: Our Special Care Nursery provides specialized housing and 24-hr care for preterm neonates. Two Air-Shield isolettes and Servo 300A ventilators were used to provide temperature & respiratory support. Clinical management plans were developed for moderate to intense critical care levels, extrapolating from current NICU & veterinary practices. Preterm infants had mild-moderate RDS and were supported with supplemental O2 and/or assisted ventilation (CPAP) as indicated by clinical symptoms. For infants with clinical signs of respiratory failure, surfactant was administered (100mg/kg). More intensive care (mechanical ventilation & nutritional support) was required for those neonates exposed to U.parvum IAI alone compared to those treated with AZI. Provision of parenteral nutrition (PICC) was essential due to poor suckling reflex. Enteral feedings were gradually introduced to reduced risk of NEC. CONCLUSIONS: Extending our maternal-fetal NHP model of prematurity to successfully include neonatal survival, provides unique opportunities for establishing new research initiatives that will provide clinically relevant and translational data from both the maternal-fetal environment and postnatal period.",

INTRODUCTION: Cesarean section(CS)rates are increasing worldwide& are associated with numerous offspring disorders. The microbiota was suggested to play a crucial role in the development of normal social behaviors in germ-free mice 1 . We tested the hypothesis that mode of delivery,particularly elective CS,affects childhood behavioral development with sex-specific associations. METHODS: Using data from the Growing Up in Ireland cohort we conducted a cohort study of 9973 children randomly selected to represent all Irish births in 2008 (N=73662). Child behaviors were assessed with the 'Strengths&Difficulties Questionnaire'(SDQ) when children were 3 years old. Multivariate logistic regression was used for data analysis. RESULTS: 59% of births were born by spontaneous vaginal delivery(SVD), 14% by instrumental vaginal delivery(IVD), 12% by elective CS & 13% by emergency CS. Emergency CS children had an increased odds of having abnormal total SDQ, hyperactivity & peerproblem, which persisted after adjusting for potential confounders. There was evidence of sex-specific effects in females born by IVD for hyperactivity & peer problems in females born by emergency CS.Males had an increased risk of hyperactivity in emergency CS only. adjusted for maternal age,education,race,preeclampsia,gestational age,sex,birthweight, parity",

INTRODUCTION: Cesarean section rates have peaked worldwide,yet the longterm effects are unknown.This study assessed the risk of explained/unexplained stillbirth following primary Cesarean. METHODS: In a Danish cohort(n=832,996),we identified women with primary livebirth between January 1982 & December 2010.Followup continued until the next event(explained/unexplained stillbirth) or censoring by other events,death,emigration or study end.Analyzes included Cox regression & cause-specific competing-risks. RESULTS: An increased risk of stillbirth was found in emergency & elective Cesarean. Adj.HR=Adjusted Hazard Ratio; *Model1:maternal age,origin,history of stillbirth,education,marital status,mother&father's income **Model1 + medical complications ***Model2 + gestational age,birthweight Data for the causes of stillbirth was available from 1982-1996,where causespecific competing risks found an increased risk of explained stillbirth in emergency[HR1.26,95%CI 1.09,1.46] & elective[HR1.30,95%CI 1.04,1.62]Cesarean in the crude and adjusted models.For unexplained stillbirth,an increased risk was found in emergency Cesarean only[HR1.42,95%CI1.00,2.01] (Data not shown). CONCLUSIONS: Overall,an increased risk of stillbirth was found in emergency & elective Cesarean.An increased risk of explained stillbirth was found in emergency & elective Cesarean. For unexplained stillbirth, an increased risk was found in emergency Cesarean only.Rigorous adjustment modelling did not attenuate these findings.An acknowledged limitation of the study is the lack of data on antepartum/intrapartum stillbirths.This study confirms findings by Smith et al. in the Scottish data.Women need to be advised of the risks for all modes of delivery.

Genomic studies have demonstrated the heterogeneity nature of this disease and identified novel molecular signatures.Recently identified ovarian cancer stem cells, a subpopulation of malignant cells with characteristics of self-renewal and pluripotency, are sustained by a core regulatory positive feedback-loop involving transcription factors Sox2, Nanog and Oct4. The objective of this study is to determine whether Sox2, Nanog, and Oct4 are associated with EOC and poor outcome. METHODS: Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma genomics data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database was queried through the Cancer Genomics Portal website. Copy number alterations or variations (CNAs or CNVs) are genomic structural polymorphisms, identifiable by genomewide analytic tools such as comparative genomic hybridization. Presence, frequency, and survival outcomes associated with CNAs of Sox2, Nanog and Oct4 were evaluated. They consist of changes in the number of copies of chromosome segments, and genes consisting of deletions, amplifications, insertions, and translocations. We also consolidated the following tumor and clinical variables into binary categorical schemes: FIGO stages into early and advanced, grade low and high, platinum sensitive or resistant and others, which were excluded. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used for outcome predictions. RESULTS: CNA and CNV were present in 35 % of the cases (N=488). There is a 26, 9, and 6% amplification of Sox2, Nanog and POU5F1 (Oct4), respectively. Sox2 amplification, FIGO grade, TRD and \"Prim. Tx. Out. Succ.\" are shown to be significant predictors of death. Additionally, K-M survival analyses showed a significant median overall survival differences (41 vs 48.3 months, p=0.01) for Sox2 amplification. There was no differences observed for Nanog (44.1 vs 36.2 months, p> 0.05) and POU5F1 (43.5 vs 45.0 months, p> 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Sox2 gene amplification is significantly associated with Serous Ovarian Cancer and impact survival outcome. These findings suggest the presence of cancer stem cells in serous ovarian cancer and more importantly highlight an important role for Sox2 as a potential molecular target for outcome prediction in serous EOC. Additional studies are needed to validate our results.To Vaccinate or Not?: How Perceived Susceptibility to and Severity of HPV and Cervical Cancer Impacts Administration of the HPV Vaccine in African American Women (AAW).

Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA. INTRODUCTION:Mature cystic teratoma (MCT) is the most common germ cell tumor and accounts for 10-20% of ovarian masses. The rate of malignant degeneration is low and prognosis is poor. We sought to better understand these tumors and associated risk factors. METHODS: A single-institution retrospective chart review of MCT cases which exhibited malignant degeneration from 2004-2012. Multiple variables were examined including procedure, surgical stage, histological type, recurrence status, use of chemotherapy, and progression free and overall survival. RESULTS: 8 out of 729 (1.09%) MCT specimens exhibited malignant degeneration. The mean age at presentation was 59 years (range 40-74 years). Mean follow-up was 22 months (range 1-56 months). The most common presenting symptoms were bloating and abdominal pain. Mean tumor size was 23.8cm (range 18-33.5cm). Over 50% of cases were at least stage IIIC, the remainder were stage IC or lower. 5 out of 8 cases (62.5%) were mucinous adenocarcinomas in addition to one case each of malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Of mucinous tumors, 100% were positive for CK20, CDX2 and 40% were positive for CK7. The case of recurrence was malignant melanoma and occurred 328 days after diagnosis. The case of squamous cell carcinoma was stage IC and the case of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma was stage IIIC; both died within 6 months of diagnosis. 75% of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. One patient had a known MCT that was being followed expectantly and subsequently grew 14cm in one year and exhibited malignant degeneration to a mucinous adenocarcinoma. At one year, overall survival was 67% and at 3 years, 40%. Progression free survival was 17.5 months among those who received chemotherapy and 26.8 months among those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: A large ovarian mass suspected to be a MCT should be managed aggressively in older patients. While malignant degeneration is rare, it is more likely when patients are older than 40 years old and the mass is greater than 18cm. We observed a higher rate of malignant degeneration into a mucinous neoplasm relative to published data. Like most ovarian cancers, these tumors most often present at later stages and can be difficult to treat. It is unclear what role chemotherapy plays in this disease.Flutamide and Risk for Ovarian Cancer: Pre-Clinical and ClinicalStudy.

INTRODUCTION: Sexual health greatly impacts quality of life and may be negatively affected in cancer survivors. The aim of this study is to compare sexual function of older female cancer survivors relative to other women without a history of cancer. METHODS: We performed a cross sectional analysis of the 2005-2006National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) database to investigate sexual attitudes and function of female cancer survivors ages 57 to 85. We compared sexuality in older female cancer survivors to other women and sub-stratified by age and years since cancer diagnosis. Outcomes measured included sexual partnership, activity, frequency, attitudes and beliefs, and dysfunction. RESULTS: A total of 1550 women were included in the analysis, of which 6.5% of women were cancer survivors. The most common cancer was breast cancer (38.6%) followed by gynecological malignancies (32.4%). Female cancer survivors were less likely to report a current sexual partner (p=.004) or sexual activity in the previous 12 months (p=.03), and reported decreased interest in sex (p=.04) compared to their non-cancer counterparts. No differences were observed regarding types of sexual activity between cancer survivors and other women as measured by degree of foreplay (p=.13), vaginal coitus (p=.10), and masturbation (p=.90). Common sexual problems, such as vaginal dryness (p=.36), anorgasmia (p=.47), dyspareunia (p=.46), lack of pleasure (p=.15), performance anxiety (p=.07) and avoidance of sex (p=.19) were similar between female cancer survivors and other women. Sexual attitudes, values and beliefs, and sexual dysfunction were also similar between age groups of cancer survivors (57 to 64 years old, 65-74 years old, and 75-85 years old). Female survivors within 5 years of cancer diagnosis reported increased vaginal dryness and dyspareunia compared with female cancer survivors greater than 5 years since their diagnosis (p=.038 and p=.0055 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although there are issues unique to female cancer survivors such as decreased interest and sexual frequency, we found that overall, sexual activity and sexual attitudes were similar to the general population.Lipoxygenase (LOX) Pathways Are Activated in EndometrialCarcinogenesis. M Cummings, K Massey, G Mappa, N Wilkinson, R Hutson, A Nicolaou, NM Orsi. Pathology, Leeds University, United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the commonest gynaecological malignancy in the developed world, affecting 15-25:100,000 women/year. ECs are classified as Type I/II according to their aetiological, histological and molecular characteristics. Type I ECs (~75% cases) typically arise from premalignant hyperplasia, whereas Type II Ecs arise from atrophic endometrium, are high grade and carry a worse prognosis. Although some eicosanoids (e.g. the cyclooxygenase (COX) product PGE2) are recognised inflammatory mediators associated with carcinogenesis, the roles of other eicosanoid species such as LOX/ epoxygenase metabolites are poorly understood. This study aimed to characterise the eicosanoid spectrum of normal, hyperplastic and cancerous endometrium using a lipidomics approach. METHODS: We profiled 48 eicosanoid and related lipid species in 81 normal, 30 hyperplastic and 118 cancerous endometrial specimens (Types I/II). Specimens were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00baC. Each was cryosectioned and resultant slides marked up for areas of interest.",

INTRODUCTION:Chemoresistance presents a challenge in treatment of ovarian cancer. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) manifests a persistent prooxidant state and reduction of this state induces apoptosis. Dichloroacetate (DCA), which converts anaerobic to aerobic metabolism, was shown to induce apoptosis in EOC cells. We sought to determine whether DCA modulates key antioxidant levels as part of a mechanism of increased apoptosis. METHODS: Resistant and sensitive MDAH-2774 EOC cells were treated with DCA (10 mM) for 24 hours. Real-time RT-PCR was used to determine mRNA levels for glutathione reductase (GSR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX1), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD3), as well as caspase-3. Data was analyzed using SPSS and a student's t-test, p<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: DCA differentially altered antioxidants, increasing GSR and SOD3 and decreasing GPX1 in resistant EOC cells. Additionally, caspase-3 expression increased in resistant EOC, suggesting an increase in apoptosis.",

Gillian Hsieh, 1 Kathleen Antony, 1 Ramya Masand, 2 Matthew L Anderson. 1 1 Obstetrics and Gynecology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA; 2 Pathology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.INTRODUCTION: Accumulating evidence implicates the distal fallopian tube as a source of many high grade serous carcinomas. This evidence has heightened clinical interest in salpingectomy as a tool for ovarian cancer prevention. Women requesting postpartum tubal ligation are potentially ideal candidates for risk-reducing salpingectomy. However, existing histologic descriptions of the postpartum fallopian tube are often conflicted. Clear definitions of the normal histologic appearance of the postpartum fallopian tube are needed before postpartum distal salpingectomy can be adopted for cancer prevention on a population scale as well as to understand the protective impact of pregnancy on ovarian cancer risk. METHODS: After obtaining permission from the IRB, specimens of fallopian tube were collected from women undergoing distal salpingectomy as part of a prospective feasibility study. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Specimens were paraffin-embedded and sectioned according to the SEE-FIM protocol. Expression of Ki-67 and TP53 were examined by immunohistochemistry.

Type I ECs are generally oestrogen-sensitive, develop from premalignant hyperplasia and are low-medium grade. By contrast, the rarer high grade Type II ECs are frequently eostrogen receptor negative, have no premalignant lesion and have poorer clinical outcomes.

INTRODUCTION:Depression has been shown to negatively influence many health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and pregnancy. These health outcomes also have gender differences associated with them. Little is known about the effect of depression on outcomes of female cancers at time of cancer diagnosis. Our aim is to determine whether depression at time of cancer diagnosis portends a worse stage at diagnosis and tumor histology than for no depression at time of cancer diagnosis, for persons with breast, ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers. METHODS: This IRB-approved study included women from the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) who agreed to be contacted for phone interviews to collect information on demographics, cancer well-being, and psychosocial factors. Depression was queried via a validated tool during phone interviews. KCR verified pathology reports and collected clinical information on patients. Demographic data was analyzed according to presence/absence of depression at time of diagnosis using t tests and chi-square tests. Adjusted models were then created for stage at diagnosis and tumor grade at diagnosis based on presence/absence of depression at diagnosis. RESULTS: 1153 women with breast, cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer were enrolled in this study between 2010-2013; 443 women had depression and 710 did not have depression at time of cancer diagnosis. This data does not contain sufficient power to find statistically significant differences between depressed and non-depressed women at time of diagnosis by cancer type, but does find a trend toward a more-advanced stage at diagnosis for breast (p= .11) and ovarian (p= .11) cancers and less differentiated tumor grade for breast (p= .066) cancer among women with depression at time of cancer diagnosis. No difference according to presence/absence of depression was observed among women with cervical and endometrial cancers. CONCLUSIONS: This data suggest that women with depression at time of cancer diagnosis may have more-advanced stage at diagnosis for breast and ovarian cancers and less differentiated tumor grade for breast cancer.Knowledge and Perceived Susceptibility and Severity of HPV amongst African American Women (AAW).

INTRODUCTION:Tumor micro environment has recently gained an interest in oncology. Fibroblast activated protein (FAP) seemed to have a prognostic value in several malignancies and FAP inhibitors could be a potential target therapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of FAP expression in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). METHODS: FAP protein as detected by immunohistochemistry was conducted on paraffin-embedded tissue from 338 EOC samples. Clinical data and follow-up were obtained from the medical records. Fisher's exact test was performed to test the association between FAP and disease outcomes. Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test was used to calculate the cumulative survival difference between patients and FAP expression. In vitro, EOC cells were co-cultured with mesenchymal cells to induce a cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype. To test the function of FAP,EOC cells were treated with FAP alone or in the presence of cisplatin. Conversely, FAP expression was silenced by siRNA knock down and cells were evaluated for cell viability using PrestoBlue. RESULTS: FAP immunoexpression was independent predictive factor for cisplatin resistance (p=0.0154) in patients with EOC. In addition, patients with tumors FAP stroma-had longer 3 years survival rate in comparison to those with FAP stroma + (p =0.027). FAP expression was significantly increased in mesenchymal cells co-cultured with EOC cells compared to mesenchymal cells co-cultured with normal epithelial ovarian cell controls. Addition of FAP to EOC cell lines treated with cisplatin showed a 10-12% increase in cell viability and proliferation in comparison to cisplatin alone. Furthermore. siRNA knock down in EOC cell cultures induced a 20% reduction in proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: 1-FAP expression by tumor associated stroma is a potential negative prognostic biomarker in EOC. 2-In vitro studies showed that FAP+ decrease sensitivity for cisplatin. 3-There is a real need for clinically meaningful prognostic biomarkers and novel targeted therapeutic regimens in EOC and due to the frequent presence of FAP by tumor associated stroma, we believe that FAP inhibitors should be further investigated for the clinical management and treatment of EOC.The Significance of Prior Tubal Occlusion in Uterine Papillary Serous Carcinoma. Caroline Nitschmann, Michael Worley, Colleen Feltmate. Obstetrics and Gynecology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Objective. Uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) often presents with high grade and advanced stage disease. Compared to endometrioid type endometrial carcinoma, UPSC has a higher propensity for intraperitoneal spread and extra-abdominal disease.Trans-tubal exfoliation has been hypothesized as one mechanism by which UPSC spreads intra-abdominally. We sought to evaluate the significance of prior tubal occlusion among women with UPSC.METHODS:Methods. Medical records of patients diagnosed with UPSC between January 1995 and December 2010 were reviewed. Patients were separated into two groups based on the presence or absence of prior tubal ligation that preceded the diagnosis of UPSC. Groups were then compared with respect to patient characteristics, histopathologic findings, stage distribution and rates of optimal cytoreduction (<1cm residual disease). RESULTS: Results. We identified 183 patients. A total of 29 (15.85%) patients had a history of prior tubal ligation and 154 (84.2%) did not. The tubal ligation group had a greater percentage of patients with stage I disease (72.4% vs. 49.4% <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">p=0.072). Groups were similar with respect to other histopathologic findings including myometrial invasion (62.1% vs. 69.5%), cervical stromal invasion (17.9% vs. 23.0%), lymph-vascular space invasion (21.4% vs. 37.7%) and the presence of positive lymph nodes (29.2% vs. 27.0%). Patients with prior tubal ligation were significantly less likely to have adnexal involvement (93.1% vs. 75.3%, <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">p=0.047) and positive cytologic washings (88.5% vs. 66.7%, <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">p=0.035). Rates of optimal cytoreduction were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusion. Patients with a history of uterine papillary serous carcinoma and prior tubal occlusion are significantly less likely to have adnexal involvement and positive cytologic washings.In Vivo Raman Spectroscopy Detects Cervical IntraepithelialNeoplasia with High Accuracy in Diverse Population.

            "text": ": In 160 patients, 65 (41%) had tumors with no REST expression. REST expression was not associated with tumor grade, stage, or histologic subtype. Patients with no REST expression showed a more favorable recurrence-free survival curve, with median time to recurrence for REST-less tumors of 20.3 months compared to 35.8 months for RESTexpressing tumors (p=0.002). REST expression was positively correlated with FANCD2 expression (p=0.003), though FANCD2 was not associated with prognosis or tumor characteristics in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: REST has been shown to have tissue-dependent expression, acting as either a tumor suppressor or oncogene. In contrast to what has been observed in other epithelial cancers, decreased REST expression may be associated with a more favorable prognosis in ovarian cancer. Further knowledge of the role of REST in ovarian cancer could allow for novel therapeutic regimens.Subcellular Localization of FANCD2 Is Associated with Survival inSerous Carcinoma of the Ovary.

INTRODUCTION: Carcinosarcomas (CS) represent 4% of uterine cancers, but constitute 26% of deaths. Ifosfamide-containing regimens and carboplatin/paclitaxel (CP+T) have compared favorably in phase II studies. There is no consensus regarding optimal therapy. This study describes the institutional experience with treatment for this entity. METHODS: Patients with a histologic diagnosis of stage I-IV uterine CS from 1990-2013 treated with cisplatin/ifosfamide (C+I), paclitaxel/ ifosfamide (T+I), or CP+T were identified retrospectively. RESULTS: 56 patients were included. 35 patients had early and 21 had advanced disease; 58.9% received C+I, 12.5% T+I, and 28.6% CP+T. Presence of a heterologous component was an independent predictor of overall survival (OS) (p=0.02); age >70 yrs was not. There were no differences in progression free survival (PFS) (p=0.86) or OS (p=0.3) among patients with stage I/II disease who received C+I, T+I or CP+T. Among patients with stage III/IV disease, PFS and OS were improved in those who received I (44.0 vs 17.0 mo, p = 0.03/74.3 vs 29.0 mo, p=0.02).CONCLUSIONS:Ifosfamide-based regimens may be associated with improved PFS/OS in patients with advanced uterine CS. This advantage is not apparent in patients with early-stage disease.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to compare obstetrical management and outcome in adolescent (A) versus non adolescent pregnancies (NA). METHODS: We compared 43 singleton pregnancies in patients aged \u226421 years (A) followed at our outpatient clinic for adolescent gynecology to a control group of women >21 years (NA) who deliverd at our Institution from November 2011 to August 2013. We evaluated gestational age at first access, maternal prepregnancy BMI, weight gain in pregnancy, number of obstetrical controls, request for prenatal diagnosis, rate of risk behaviour (smoke, alcohol, hygiene habits), rate of obstetrical complications, mode of delivery, fetal and placental weight, gestational age at delivery. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Significance was calculated with t-test for independent samples and chi square method. RESULTS: Results are shown in the table. We hypothesize that Gardnerella vaginalis is a key player because of its ability to use the enzyme sialidase to break down mucus barriers. G. vaginalis thereby enhances nutrient availability and improves access to heavily guarded tissues, facilitating its own interaction with the host and increasing susceptibility to infection by other pathogens.METHODS:We have developed a model of G. vaginalis vaginal infection in mice. We also performed biochemical and microcopic analysis of human clinical specimens. To investigate novel concepts of polymicrobial synergy in the vaginal niche we have performed co-infection experiments with G. vaginalis and the BV associated bacteria Prevotella bivia and Syndecan-4 influences the invasive behavior of 12Z endometriosis cells, which may correlate to less efficient implantation of endometriotic tissue at ectopic sites in vivo.

The ratio of maternal plasma:CSF insulin was significantly higher in obese women (lean 11.8\u00b12.0 vs obese 39.0\u00b19.6, P=0.03). Maternal plasma glucose values were similar between the groups (lean 81\u00b12.5 mg/dL vs obese 78.8\u00b18.7 mg/dL, P=0.83) while CSF glucose values were marginally different (lean 48\u00b11.1 mg/dL vs obese 53\u00b11.8 mg/dL, P=0.05).

METHODS: C1INH activity levels were measured and compared between 106 cases at the onset of AFE in which 85 cases were nonfatal, 21 cases were fatal, and 88 cases were normal after delivery. Furthermore, a series of C1INH activity levels were measured in one survivor of AFE and one case that died of AFE. Two pregnant women defined as AFE had low C1INH activity levels even before the onset of AFE; however, C1INH activity levels in the survivor significantly recovered after early replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that low C1INH activity levels are closely associated with the pathogenesis of AFE, which suggests that C1INH activity levels have potential as a prognosis factor of AFE.

The suppressive ability of regulatory T cells occurs through several mechanisms. Suppression by Tregs primarily requires cell-cell contact whereas Tr1 act mainly by the release of IL-10. Our results allow us to hypothesize that the first suppressive mechanism may fail for the small number of FoxP3 + cells. The decreased IL-10 production could depend, at least in part, by reduced presence or function of Tr1, which exert their immunosuppressive activity mainly through this cytokine. This might alter the decidual immune homeostasis, causing susceptibility to pregnancy loss.The Effects of Advanced Maternal Age on Placental Morphology and Function. Samantha C Lean, Linda Peacock, Jane Boscolo-Ryan, Alexander EP Heazell, Tracey Mills, Rebecca L Jones. Maternal and Fetal Health Research Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION: Advanced maternal age (AMA; >35 years)is associated with an increased risk of fetal growth restriction (FGR) and stillbirth. The aetiology is unknown; however these pregnancies are closely linked to placental dysfunction. Aberrant placental nutrient transport, hormone production, syncytial nuclear aggregate (SNA) formation and cell turnover are hallmarks of placentas from FGR pregnancies. Whether AMA affects placental development and function has not been investigated. We hypothesised that placentas from AMA pregnancies have altered placental morphology and function that leads to increased risk of poor outcome. METHODS: Placentas were collected from normal singleton pregnancies of 20-30 (control), 35-39 and \u226540 year old women (n=15 per group). Placental morphology was assessed by quantification of SNAs using standard histological techniques. Immunostaining quantified capillary number in terminal villi (CD31) and cell turnover for number of proliferating nuclei (Ki67). Placental nutrient transport was assessed by uptake of 14C-MeAIB and 3H-Taurine via System A and TauT respectively in fresh villous tissue. Secretion of placental hormones (progesterone, PAPP-A, hCG and hPL) was measured in 28 and 36 week maternal serum by ELISA (20-30y n=26, 35-39y n=29, \u226540y n=25). RESULTS: Higher placental uptake via System A and TauT was detected in women \u226540 compared to those aged 20-30 years (linear regression, p>0.05). Production of placental hormones was unaffected by maternal age. The number of SNA's increased in placentas from women \u226535 years compared to controls (p<0.05). Villous Ki67 positive nuclei appeared to decrease with increasing maternal age, but not significantly (Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.204). Number of vessels per villi and number of avascular villi did not differ with age. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence of aberrant placental function and morphology in placentas from AMA pregnancies. Ageing is associated with increased systemic inflammation and oxidative stress factors which have been found to increase system A and TauT activity. Increased SNAs indicates either increased placental pathology or accelerated ageing in placentas from older mothers compared to younger counterparts matched for gestation and outcome. An aged maternal environment may be responsible for these placental effects. Understanding the mechanisms underlying AMA and pregnancy complications may help improve outcome for these women.Seminal Plasma Fructose Assay Revisited. Brian A Levine, Daniel Ryan, Sinem Karipcin, Queenie V Neri, Zev Rosenwaks, Gianpiero D Palermo. The Ronald O. Perelman & Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA. INTRODUCTION: Seminal plasma fructose is the main carbohydrate energy source of spermatozoa and is secreted by the seminal vesicles and the accessory sex glands which are responsive to FSH & LH.In men with severely compromised sperm parameters, fructose may elucidate male genital tract patency and function. In this study we assessed seminal plasma fructose as a biochemical adjuvant to the standard semen analysis when interpreting sperm attributes, specifically in crypto-/azoo-spermia. METHODS: Patients undergoing male infertility screening were included in the study. After liquefaction, semen parameters such as volume, concentration, motility, and morphology were assessed according to WHO parameters (2010). The specimens were centrifuged and the cell-void seminal plasma was assessed for fructose concentration with a commercial kit (Abcam, ab83380, Cambridge, Mass.). The optical density was measured with a computerized microplate reader. The final fructose concentration was obtained from the linear regression of the standard curve. All P values were two-sided with statistical significance evaluated at the 0.05 alpha level. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were enrolled in the study and had a mean seminal volume of 3.8\u00b11.2 mL, concentration of 48.6\u00b126.5 x 10 6 , motility of 48.6\u00b17.6%, normal morphology of 3.4\u00b10.9% and a fructose concentration of 5.1\u00b12.9 mg/mL. When sperm parameters were plotted against fructose concentration, an inverse trend was identified for sperm concentration and morphology. No clear difference was noted for those with oligo-(5.3\u00b13.1 vs. 4.4\u00b12.2 mg/mL), astheno-(5.2\u00b12.8 vs. 4.5\u00b13.8 mg/mL) or terato-spermia (4.8\u00b13.3 vs 5.4\u00b12.5 vs mg/mL). However, a significant difference in fructose level was noted when a threshold sperm concentration of 65x 10 6 was used (3.1\u00b10.7 vs. 5.9\u00b13 mg/mL; P=0.006).When fructose values were adjusted on a per-sperm basis, patients with the most abnormal sperm attributes had a higher value (167\u00b175.4 vs. 625.2\u00b1133.9).",

Philip C Logan, 1 Anna P Ponnampalm, 1,2 Zoe L Vincent, 1 Murray D Mitchell. 3 1 The Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; 2 Gravida, National Centre for Growth and Development, Auckland, New Zealand; 3 Centre for Clinical Research, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. INTRODUCTION: DNA methylation may have a role in regulating decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells because the three main DNA methyltransferases(DNMTs), DNMT1, 3A, and 3B are dynamically regulated in a time-dependent manner by estradiol, progesterone, and cyclic AMP during decidualization. Recently, the TET hydroxylases of TET1, 2, 3, the mechanism of active DNA demethylation that converts methylated cytosine to hydroxy-methylcytosine (and back to cytosine), have been studied in development and cancer progression. The aim of this study was to characterise the expression of TET1, 2, 3 in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle, to determine the effect of the steroid hormones and cyclic AMP (cAMP) on TET1, 2, 3, during decidualization, and to investigate DNA hydroxymethylation. METHODS: Endometrial tissue biopsies from women of reproductive age with regular menstrual cycles were collected following informed consent. The human endometrial stromal cell-line (HESC) was treated with estradiol, medroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA), and dibutyryl cAMP in a time-course. Expression of TETs was characterised by real-time quantitative PCR.",

INTRODUCTION:Obesity is associated with ovarian intrafollicular alterations at multiple cellular levels including steroidogenic and inflammatory pathways. We hypothesize that granulosa cell (GC) dysfunction contributes to abnormal follicular maturation and subsequent corpus luteum dysfunction in obese women, and that overweight and obese women have altered GC gene expression compared to normal weight women. METHODS: 8 reproductive-aged women who underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation followed by oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilization were enrolled. Total RNA was extracted from GCs. For microarray analysis, biotinylated cRNA probes were hybridized to Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 chips. The chips were washed and stained using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400 Microarray analysis. Gene expression data were validated on GCs from biologically similar samples using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Comparisons were made between women with body mass index (BMI)<25 kg/m2 (Group 1; n=4) or \u226525 kg/m2 (Group 2; n=4). RESULTS: Groups 1 and 2 had different BMI (21.4 \u00b11.4 vs. 30.4\u00b12.7 kg/ m 2 respectively; p=0.02) but did not differ in age (30.5\u00b11.7 vs. 32.7\u00b10.3 years respectively; p=0.3). Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles by supervised clustering between Group 1 vs. Group 2 resulted in the selection of 8 differentially expressed genes: GAS7, SMAD6, FGF-12, PPM1L, IL1RL, ZFPM2, FOXM1, and CDC20. GAS7, CDC20 and FOXM1 were down-regulated while FGF-12, PPM1L, and IL1RL1 were up-regulated in Group 2 when compared to Group 1. As BMI increased, FOXM1 expression significantly decreased (r= 0.61, p=0.049). Validation with RT-PCR confirmed the microarray data. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that alterations in GCs are present in overweight and obese women. Adiposity is associated with changes in the expression of genes important for cellular growth, cell cycle progression, inflammation and proto-oncogenic changes. The upregulation of the metabolic regulator gene PPM1L suggests that adiposity induces an abnormal metabolic follicular environment, hence altering folliculogenesis. Future studies will focus on the analysis of protein products from these genes.Effect of Octanoic Acid on Timing of Mouse EmbryoDevelopment and Expression of Viability Genes. Dean E Morbeck, 1 Melissa Paczkowski, 2 Jolene R Fredrickson, 3 Rebecca L Krisher. 2 1 Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA; 2 Fertility Research Laboratory, National Foundation for Fertility Research, Lone Tree, CO, USA; 3 Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. INTRODUCTION:Octanoic acid (OA), a stabilizer added to human serum albumin (HSA), disrupts energy metabolism and induces oxidative damage in several cell types. We have previously reported lot-to-lot variation of OA in IVF-grade HSA and effects on mouse embryos(Leonard  et al., 2013). Studies with other cell types demonstrate effects of OA at concentrations that are currently used for embryo culture; however, the effect of OA at low concentrations that do not overtly affect blastocyst development has not been determined. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of OA on embryo development and gene expression using concentrations of OA that are commonly used for IVF. METHODS: One-cell mouse embryos from superovulated FVB mice mated with CF1 males were cultured in an EmbryoScope (5% O2, Global media) with recombinant albumin (AlbIX) containing 0 (control), 400 uM (OA400), 800 uM (OA800) and 1200 uM OA (OA1200). Variables measured included cell division kinetics, blastocyst development and expression of 8 viability genes after 96h of culture. RESULTS: Although blastocyst development was reduced (p<0.001) by OA1200 compared to control, OA400 and OA800 (39.4 vs 83.3, 71.0 and 71.9%, respectively), lower concentrations of OA affected precompaction embryo development. The length of the second cell cycle increased with increasing concentrations of OA (22.7\u00b11.6, 23.7\u00b12.1, 26.2\u00b13.7* and 27.9\u00b13.7* h; *p<0.001), resulting in a significant delay at the 4-cell (36.0\u00b11.9, 38.2\u00b13.0, 41.0\u00b14.9*, 43.1\u00b16.3* h; *p<0.001) and8-cell stage (47.2\u00b12.6, 49.7\u00b13.8, 52.9\u00b15.3*, 55.9\u00b19.3* h; p<0.001). Only Cox2 expression was affected by treatment, with a 2.8-fold increase for OA400 relative to the control (p=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Most clinics use HSA at 5-10 mg/ml, which corresponds to 400-800 uM OA. Using OA-free recombinant albumin, we show that clinically relevant concentrations of OA delay development by prolonging early cell cycles. These delays are not always manifest in lower blastocyst development and thus would not be detected by standard quality control assays. Time-lapse data of early cell cycle duration is more sensitive as a quality control measure and provides a model for studying culture-induced alterations at cell-specific stages of preimplantation development.Proteomic Regulation of hsa-miR-30d Over-Expression in HumanEndometrial Epithelial Cells (hEEC).

INTRODUCTION:The determinants of several events associated with ovarian follicular development, including stimulation of primordial follicles, follicular growth, and regression, are largely unknown. We sought to test the hypothesis that olfactory receptors may play a role in these processes by documenting their presence in human ovarian granulosa cells. Indeed, disorders of embryologic neuronal migration can cause reproductive disorders at the level of the hypothalamus, e.g., Kallman's Syndrome, where GnRH and olfactory neurons exhibit migratory failure resulting in infertility and anosmia. Olfactory receptors have been discovered in several tissues outside of the olfactory bulb. Activation of such receptors in prostate cancer cells decreases cellular proliferation. Olfactory receptors in spermatozoa play a role in their chemotaxis. METHODS: Luteinized human granulosa cells were collected from the USC Fertility Clinic after ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization.

INTRODUCTION:We have shown earlier that uterine growth during pregnancy is accompanied by the increase in expression of multiple extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in uterine smooth muscle, myometrium. We also reported that in vivo mechanical stretch of the uterine wall by the growing fetus(es) can modulate expression of ECM components during gestation. We hypothesize that myometrial ECMdegrading matrix metalloproteinases' (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of MMPs' (TIMPs) expression/activity is modulated during gestation, term labour (TL) and post-partum (PP) involution period. METHODS: Myometrial tissues were collected from normal bilaterally pregnant and unilaterally pregnant rats throughout gestation, TL and PP. Total RNA was extracted from gravid and non-gravid uterine horns and subjected to real-time RT-PCR analysis for MMP1-3, 7-13 and TIMP1-4. Total proteins were extracted and used for zymography, ELISA and western blot analysis. RESULTS: mRNA levels for MMP1, 2, 8-13 were low during most of gestation, slightly elevated one day prior to labour (d22), decreased during labour (d23L) and significantly induced during PP period (p<0.05). Expression of MMP7 was transiently up-regulated on d22, culminated during labour (p<0.001), and decreased PP. TIMP1-4 expressions were unchanged throughout gestation and TL. A similar trend for all MMPs/ TIMPs genes was observed in the gravid uterine horn of unilaterally pregnant rats, however very low expressions were detected in the non-gravid horn. In accordance with gene expression results gelatin zymography demonstrated an increase in MMP2 activity during PP period. Our preliminary analysis of MMP7 and MMP8 protein expression showed elevated levels during early and mid-gestation and a decrease at late gestation, TL and PP. In contrast, MMP11 protein expression was steadily increased throughout gestation and culminated during TL. CONCLUSIONS: Our gene expression data are consistent with MMPs and TIMPs playing a role in the remodeling of myometrial tissue to prepare the uterus for labour contractions and PP involution. Biological mechanical stretch of the uterine wall by the growing fetus can modulate the expression of MMPs and contribute to myometrial remodeling during late pregnancy and labour.Identification and Characterization of Membrane ProgesteroneReceptors in Fetal Membranes: Implications for PPROM and Preterm Birth. Peter Thomas, 1 Yefei Pang, 1 Jing Dong, 1 Serkalem Tadesse, 2 Victoria Snegovskikh, 3 Errol R Norwitz. 4 1 Marine Science Institute, University of Texas at Austin, Port Aransas, TX, USA; 2 Ob/ Gyn, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA; 3 Ob/Gyn, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA; 4 Ob/Gyn, Tufts University, Boston, MA, USA. INTRODUCTION:Recent studies have shown that progesterone (P 4 ) supplementation can prevent preterm birth (PTB) in some patients at high risk due to a prior PTB or cervical shortening. Since supplementation does not alter circulating P 4 levels and endogenous levels of P 4 in pregnancy far exceed the Kd of the nuclear progesterone receptor (nPR), the mechanism by which P 4 supplementation works is not clear. We have previously shown that P 4 can prevent apoptosis in fetal membranes and may thereby prevent PPROM-related PTB(Luo et al. Reprod Sci 2010;17:532), which accounts for one-third of all preterm deliveries. Here, we investigate the expression and functional characteristics of membrane PRs (mPRs) in fetal membranes. METHODS: Fetal membranes were collected from uncomplicated elective cesarean deliveries at term (n=5). Expression of nPR (PR-A, PR-B), mPR (mPRa, mPRb), and progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) protein and mRNA were examined by Western blot and RT-qPCR, respectively, using specific antibodies. Cells stably transfected with the various mPRs were used as positive controls. [ 3 H]-P 4 binding analysis was performed using cell membrane preparations from fetal membranes. Saturation and competition experiments as well as Scatchard plot analysis were used to characterize the binding sites. RESULTS: Western blot analysis showed the presence of PR-A (50kD), PR-B (100kD), mPRa",

METHODS: Day 15 pregnant CD-1 mice were injected intraperitoneal with combinations of LPS (TLR4 agonist) and poly I:C (TLR3 agonist), peptidoglycan (PGN, TLR2 agonist) and poly I:C, or LPS and imiquimod (IMQ, TLR7 agonist), The uteri were harvested at 2, 4, 8 or 18 hrs later. The tissue was placed in RNAlater (for mRNA studies) or snap frozen (for ELISA assays). Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent; and genomic DNA was removed using TURBO DNA-free. cDNA was prepared using the RT2 First Strand Kit. QPCR reactions were prepared with RT2 SYBR qPCR Master Mix and analyzed using a Mouse TLR Signaling Pathway Array (. Real time analysis was performed on an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System. Data was analyzed using the SABioscience data analysis website. RESULTS: The combination of bacterial and viral PAMPs resulted in a more than additive synergistic TLR response with significantly increased production of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.At 2 hours after injection, LPS alone produced a 259 fold increase in MCP1 mRNA expression vs. LPS plus poly I:C = 463 fold increase. For IP-10, LPS alone = 723 fold increase vs. LPS plus poly I:C = 3,145 fold increase; and for IL6, LPS alone = 1,059 fold increase vs. LPS plus poly I:C = 11,492 fold increase. The combinations of PGN plus poly I:C and LPS plus IMQ also resulted in markedly increased synergistic responses. ELISA assays to quantify protein expression are currently underway. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent systemic viral and bacterial infections often result in PTD. Our studies have demonstrated a marked synergistic proinflammatory response to viral and bacterial PAMPs within the mouse uterus. This response would enhance intrauterine inflammation and result in PTD. (Funded: March of Dimes Foundation 21-FY07-592 and the MGH VCRB).

Dept. of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ohio State University, College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA. INTRODUCTION: During decidualization, progesterone (P4)induces endometrial stromal cells to express tissue factor (TF), the primary mediator of hemostasis via thrombin (TH) generation. During pregnancy, decidual cells (DCs) express elevated TF levels. TH also induces inflammation by binding to protease activated receptors (PARs). Previously, we found that abruption (decidual hemorrhage), a leading cause of preterm birth (PTB) triggers functional P4 withdrawal via TH/ PAR mediated inhibition of decidual cell progesterone receptor (PRA and PRB) levels. Thus, we postulate that TH is an autocrine/paracrine factor that acts via PARs to promote labor-related functional P4 withdrawal. METHODS: Serial decidua basalis sections from gestational-age matched pre-laboring (n=9) vs laboring (n=9) uterus were immunostained for PAR1 or PAR3, or the DC and interstitial trophoblast (IT) markers vimentin and cytokeratin. The results were analyzed by histologic scoring system (HSCORE). RT-PCR measured PAR1 and PAR3 levels in RNA extracts from cultured leukocyte-free term DCs (n=3) treated with E 2 \u00b1 medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining found that DCs and adjacent ITs express PAR1 and PAR3. DC PAR1 expression is significantly higher in labor (HSCORE Mean \u00b1 SEM 113.8 \u00b1 13.7) vs non-laboring specimens (65.8 \u00b117.3;p<0.05). Increased immunostaining for PAR3 in DCs of labor vs non-laboring specimens was observed but did not attain statistical significance. In contrast with DCs, neither PAR1 nor PAR3 HSCORES differed in ITs from laboring vs non-laboring specimens. In term DC monolayers, PAR1 and PAR3 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in DCs treated with E 2 +MPA (0.46 \u00b1 0.10 and 0.38 \u00b1 0.07, respectively; p<0.006 and p<0.002) vs E 2 alone (1.03 \u00b1 0.04 and 1.03 \u00b1 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Previously, we showed that at the maternal-fetal interface at term, DCs are the highest expressors of thrombin generating TF and excess thrombin generated during abruption associated PTB inhibits PRA and PRB in DCs to induce functional P4 withdrawal. The current study reveals that: 1) the PAR1 and 3 thrombin receptors increase in DCs in labor vs non-laboring specimens. 2) progestin decreases PAR1 and 3 expression in cultured term DCs. Taken together, these observations suggest the steady state generation of thrombin acting on DC expressed PAR1 and 3 contribute to labor related functional P4 withdrawal.Na + Leak Channel Non-Selective (NALCN) Contributes to Leak Current in Human MyometrialSmooth Muscle Cells.

Previously we have shown that myometrial caspase-3 (CASP3) plays a role in regulating gestational length via cleavage of myocyte contractile architecture in a non-apoptotic manner. In this study we demonstrate that non-apoptotic CASP3 activation isolated to the peripheral nerves of the pregnant cervical stroma initiates local stromal collagen turnover via proteolytic cleavage. METHODS: Cervical samples isolated from pregnant mice at gestational day 10-19 and pregnant women at 36 weeks gestation were analyzed for CASP3 and anti-apoptotic proteins using Western blot, TUNEL assay, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and electron microscopy (EM).To determine the effect of CASP3 on collagen turnover, we utilized a 3D primary culture model of human cervical stromal cells isolated from pregnant women. CASP3 positive cervical stromal cells introduced to the 3D cultured cervical stromal cell model were assessed for their capacity to initiate local cervical stromal ECM remodeling. RESULTS: Western blot analysis revealed elevated cervical CASP3 levels at mid-gestation which decline towards term. IHC analysis revealed robust active CASP3 isolated to the peripheral nerves in both the human and mouse cervix. EM analysis defined that the peripheral nerve CASP3 activity was limited to the outer membrane of cervical nerve axons. IHC analysis revealed local ECM remodeling surrounding to the nerves containing active CASP3. Analysis of our 3D model confirmed the capacity of non apoptotic CASP3 positive cells to initiate collagen cleavage into the mature stromal matrix. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a distinct localization and regulation of CASP3 in the murine and human cervix during pregnancy. While remaining non-apoptotic, CASP3 is associated with the disruption of local collagen. Previous studies show upregulation in cervical innervation during gestation. We propose that activation of cervical CASP3 may initiate local collagen remodeling and disruption of the cervical stromal extracellular matrix thereby allowing in growth of nerves into the cervix during gestation.Essential Role for Macrophages in Late Gestation Pregnancy to Prevent Spontaneous Preterm Birth inMice.

INTRODUCTION:The myometrium undergoes profound changes in global excitability in preparation to parturition. These changes are infl uenced by spatial variations in the excitability of individual cells as well as the strength of their interconnections. Our previous work has shown that spatial heterogeneity is critical to enhancing global excitability of the uterine muscle (J. R. Soc. Interface, Sept. 2013). We now investigate the effects of voltage-dependent gap junctions on the excitability of the myometrial network. METHODS: A mathematical model of a myocyte network was developed. Each node of the network obeys FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics and neighbours are coupled through resistors representing gap junctions. This model is elaborated here by incorporating gap-junctional conductance as a function of voltage difference between neighbouring cells, and by subsequently introducing spatial heterogeneity in cell connections. The relationship between voltage difference and gap-junctional conductance is based on experimental data presented byMiyoshi et al in 1996 (shown  in",

Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA, USA; 2 Pathology, University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA, USA; 3 Obstetrics and Gynecology, Meharry Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. INTRODUCTION: Follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) hastraditionally been thought to act solely on gonadal tissues. However, recent studies report FSHR in extra-gonadal tissues such as bone, suggesting additional actions. We hypothesize that FSHR is present in extra-gonadal reproductive tissues and in placenta and that signaling through placental FSHR is necessary for normal placental and fetal development. METHODS: Human placentae from different stages of gestation and extra-gonadal reproductive tissues were immunostained for FSHR. Mouse placentae and fetuses heterozygous and homozygous for knock-out of the Fshr gene were compared to their wild-type littermates at midgestation. RESULTS: In non-pregnant women, endometrial FSHR localization differed between proliferative and secretory phases. Cervical smooth muscle also expressed FSHR. Myometrial smooth muscle expressed FSHR, but much less than myometrium from pregnant (term) women. In human placentae, FSHR was expressed in endothelial cells of chorionic villi, umbilical vein and artery, and amnion throughout pregnancy. FSHR expression in decidua occurred in distinct patterns throughout pregnancy especially near remodeling maternal blood vessels. In mice, fetuses and placentae lacking the Fshr gene were smaller than wild-type littermates and fewer number than predicted by Mendelian inheritance. CONCLUSIONS: FSHR is expressed in non-gonadal reproductive tissue in women. FSHR in myometrium of pregnant women may play a role in timing of birth. FSHR is expressed in endothelial cells and other layers of the placenta as early as 8 weeks of gestation (earliest time point examined) and throughout pregnancy. Decidual FSHR may play a role in coordinating maternal blood vessel remodeling. Finally, there are functional ramifications of the Fshr fetoplacental gene status on the developing fetus and placenta of mice. Further experiments should be performed to investigate these facets of extra-gonadal actions of FSHR on female reproductive physiology in non-pregnant and pregnant states.",

INTRODUCTION:The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the National Institutes of Health recommends initiating opioid maintenance therapy (OMT) to all pregnant women with opioid dependence to decrease the potential detrimental effects of illicit drug use in pregnancy. OMT can be achieved using either methadone (MTD) or buprenorphine (BPN). MTD has the risk of prolonging QTc intervals and leading to torsades de pointes. Women have a slightly higher QTc interval than men at baseline and thus are at a greater risk for arrhythmia. In addition, pregnancy prolongs QTc. Therefore, there remains a question of whether or not MTD maintenance therapy might further prolong QTc intervals in pregnant women and increase their risk of torsades. To date, there have been no studies assessing the QTc interval in pregnant women who are opioid dependent. The objectives of this study is to assess the QTc interval in pregnant women who are opioid-dependent and compare the change in the QTc interval prior to initiation of therapy to that at late pregnancy. METHODS: This study is a retrospective chart review of pregnant women who were started on OMT at Boston University Medical Center Early Pregnancy Dyslipidemia and Hypoadiponectinemia Are Risk Factors for Gestational Diabetes. Vanessa I Ramirez, Evelyn Miller, Theresa L Powell. Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA. INTRODUCTION: The incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is greater in obese mothers and GDM is associated with a range of adverse outcomes in the mother and the fetus. For example, GDM is linked to fetal overgrowth and children of GDM mothers are more susceptible to develop diabetes, hypertension and obesity. There is a clear need for early identification of women who will develop GDM in order to improve pregnancy outcomes. Adiponectin (ADN) is an insulinsensitizing hormone and is inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI). We have previously found a strong inverse correlation between maternal serum ADN and insulin sensitivity at 26 weeks gestation. This data suggests that low ADN contributes to the development of GDM and may explain the high rate of GDM in obese mothers. We hypothesized that low ADN in early pregnancy is predictive for the development of GDM. METHODS: We enrolled 70 women at 8-12 weeks gestation and measured serum metabolic parameters. At delivery we reviewed clinical records to determine pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: To date, 39 subjects have completed the study with term delivery. Women who were later diagnosed with GDM (n=6) had significantly higher A1C (P<0.02) in first trimester and lower ADN ratio (high molecular weight (HMW)/total) (P<0.05) compared to women who remained healthy during pregnancy (n=33). In women who later developed GDM, there were strong trends for higher triglycerides (TG, P=0.077), VLDL (P=0.074) and lower HMW ADN (P=0.062) in first trimester. Infants of GDM mothers had significantly higher ponderal index (P<0.05) with no change in birth weight compared to healthy mothers. In all subjects (n=70), first trimester maternal TG levels were inversely correlated with ADN (R=-0.361, P<0.01) and positively correlated with maternal waist/hip ratio (R=0.354, P<0.01), but not body mass index (BMI). Maternal A1C was negatively correlated with maternal ADN (R=-0.264, P<0.03) and HDL (R=-0.239, P<0.05). Maternal total ADN levels in early pregnancy were negatively correlated with BMI (R=-0.40), P<0.001), leptin (R=-0.257, P<0.04), and VLDL (R=-0.356, P<0.01) and positively correlated with HDL (R=0.386, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary data suggests that low maternal ADN and dyslipidemia in first trimester are linked to the development of insulin resistance and GDM which may prove clinically useful for early identification of women at high risk for GDM.Maternal Body Mass Index (BMI) Impacts Fetal-Placental Size atBirth and Umbilical Cord PO 2 Values: Implications for Regulatory Mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION: Our purpose was to examine linkages between maternal BMI, fetal-placental size at birth and oxygenation, with implications for regulatory mechanisms. METHODS: A tertiary centre Perinatal database was used to obtain birth and placental weight, umbilical cord gases/pH, and other information for all patients with validated pre-pregnant BMI values delivering viable, singleton infants between Jan1999 and Dec 2010 (N=29,212). BMI values were divided into: underweight (UW) <18.5, normal weight (NW) 18.5-24.9, overweight (OW) 25-29.9, and obese >30, while birth weights were divided into: small (SGA) <10%, appropriate (AGA) \u226510% and \u226490%, and large for gestational age (LGA) >90%. Significant BMI and birth weight category effects were adjusted for interactive effects and confounding variables, and used the maternal NW and fetal AGA groups as respective reference groups.

INTRODUCTION:Stroke and other cerebral vascular events (CVE) are rare in reproductive age women, but are associated with major morbidity and mortality. Because these events are rare, there are few data on the optimal management of these women during subsequent pregnancies. Our purpose was to compare outcomes in women with CVE who did and did not use anticoagulant therapy during pregnancy. METHODS: Ours was a retrospective cohort of women with CVE from 1999-2012. The treatment group included women who received thromboprophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation in the first pregnancy after CVE (P1); controls did not receive anticoagulant therapy. RESULTS: Fifty women met inclusion criteria; 17 (32%) were not treated. Eleven women (9 treated, 2 untreated) had their CVE during P1. In the remaining 39, CVE occurred prior to the index pregnancy (p = 0.20), with an average time in months from CVE to P1 that was similar in cases and controls (34.1+/-30.6 vs 34.1 +/",

Valentina Sacchi, 1 Marina Ravizza, 1 Antonella De Pirro, 1 Serena Dalzero, 1 Marco Floridia, 2 Anna Maria Marconi. 1 1 Dpt of Obstetrics and Gynecology -San Paolo Hospital Medical School, University of Milano, Milano, Italy; 2 Dpt Therapeutic Research and Medicines Evaluation, ISS, Roma, Italy. INTRODUCTION:Several studies have shown that the use of health services among pregnant women shows differences according to nationality. For HIV women, timely and adequate prenatal care has additional implications, because HAART, elective cesarean delivery and avoidance of breastfeeding reduce the risk of perinatal transmission. Women from migrant populations represent more than 50% of the reported cases of HIV pregnant women in Italy. Aim:To evaluate differences in pregnancy care, according to nationality, in HIV women in Italy. METHODS: Data from the Italian National Program on Surveillance on Antiretroviral Treatment in Pregnancy were used(period 2007-2012). Student T-test and X-square test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Among 759 women, 55% were of foreign nationality, mostly from Sub-Saharan Africa. Foreign women were younger (31\u00b15 vs 35\u00b16 years, p<0.01) and more frequently acquired HIV infection through sexual transmission (88% vs 79%, p<0.01). They had lower rates of preconception counseling and planning of pregnancy (24% vs 42%, p<0.01), more frequent HIV diagnosis in pregnancy (30% vs 12%, p<0.01) and later antenatal booking (first access before 13w, 65% vs 77%, p<0.05). As a consequence, foreign patients had lower rate of HAART assumption in the 1 st trimester (58% vs 70%,p<0.05) and they more often started their treatment in the 2 nd trimester (39% vs 28%,p<0.05). However, the whole rate of women taking HAART in the 2 nd and 3 rd trimester was similar (97.5% vs 97.1% and 99.2% vs 99.5%, p>0.05); as a result, gestational age at delivery was similar (37+3 vs 37+3w). No differences were observed in AIDS events (0%), mode of delivery (cesarean section rate 96% vs 99% p:0.06) and pregnancy outcome. The rate of perinatal HIV transmission was also comparable (0.8% vs 1.6%, p>0.05). Foreign women had infants with lower mean birthweight, although this difference was not significant (2920\u00b1494 vs 2840\u00b1449gr).CONCLUSIONS:Our data suggest that foreign HIV pregnant women have lower rates of preconception counseling and a later access to prenatal care. Specific interventions, like increasing the rate of HIV testing before pregnancy, promoting pregnancy planning and assuring the access to specific HIV programs, can lead to an additional improvement in health standards.Preoperative Predictors of Cesarean Section Hemorrhage.

INTRODUCTION:Many studies have shown that neonates born to women with diabetes mellitus (DM) in pregnancy have an increased risk of adverse outcomes, partly attributable to larger neonatal birthweight (BW). What remains unclear are the relative effects of DM, mode of delivery, and BW on these neonatal complications. METHODS: This is a retrospective birth cohort study using the California OSHPD PDD-birth linked database of women who had singleton vertex deliveries between 1/1/2006-12/31/2008. Women were divided into four groups: controls without DM, type I DM (DM1), type II DM (DM2), and gestational DM (GDM). Primary outcome was a neonatal composite including respiratory distress syndrome, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and meconium aspiration syndrome for all deliveries; plus shoulder dystocia, brachial plexus injury and clavicle fracture for vaginal deliveries only. Data were stratified by BW and mode of delivery after Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel testing. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess the relationships between DM and outcomes using appropriate confounders and effect modifiers. RESULTS: Regardless of mode of delivery, neonates born to women with DM1, DM2, or GDM had higher risk of composite adverse outcome; this was largely attributable to an increase in neonatal hypoglycemia(OR  42.25, for cesarean deliveries)",

INTRODUCTION:GDM is not only associated with a higher incidence of adult obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) later in life but also with a predisposition for cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders. Along with high rates of T2DM, GDM is particularly prevalent in certain minority populations: For example, Asian, Native American, Hispanic and African-American women are at higher risk for GDM than non-Hispanic white women. The local prevalence of T2DM in Hawaii is increasing especially among Asian and Pacific Islander (PI). These groups have demonstrated significantly higher rates of impaired glucose tolerance (15.5%) and T2DM (20.4%) compared to the overall U.S. population. The prevalence of GDM in Hawaii is the highest in Filipino women, followed by Chinese, Japanese and Native Hawaiian/ PI women. We therefore chose to investigate 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with T2DM in our local pregnant population. METHODS: OpenArray technology (Applied Biosystems) was used to screen maternal DNA for SNPs in women with GDM and ethnically matched non-diabetic controls (PI: 71 GDM and 197 controls; Filipinos: 162 GDM and 395 controls). We evaluated Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) by c\u00b2 tests, the homogeneity of the unadjusted OR among the 2 ethnic groups by Breslow-Day test and used Mantel-Haenszel to calculate the summary of unadjusted OR. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to further adjust for age, BMI, parity and gravida. RESULTS: After adjustment, four SNPs, KCNQ1 (rs2237892), MTNR1B (rs10830963), SLC30A8 (rs13266634), HHEX (rs1111875) were associated with GDM in Filipinos. MTNR1B was also associated with GDM in PI women. CONCLUSIONS: Few of the genetic polymorphisms previously associated with T2DM were also associated with GDM in Filipino and PI women from Hawaii. Of these, only MTNR1B was associated with GDM in both populations, demonstrating a significant diversion from homogeneity of OR among the two ethnicities. These results suggest that GDM is not a simple unmasking of a T2DM predisposition by the metabolic demands of pregnancy; rather it appears that different biological mechanisms are responsible for the respective diseases.Reproductive Outcomes Are Successful after Cervical Cerclage inWomen with Threatened Preterm Birth. Tessa van Kolfschooten, Olivier WH van der Heijden. Obstetrics and Gynecology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands. INTRODUCTION: Preterm birth (PTB) is a major determinant of neonatal morbidity and mortality. A cervical length less than 25mm is predictive for PTB, and painless cervical dilatation followed by prolaps of the membranes are suggestive for cervical insufficiency. Transvaginal cervical cerclage (TVCC) is a common therapeutic intervention to prevent threatened PTB occurring in the early second trimester of pregnancy. We determined the effectiveness of ultrasound-indicated (UI) and dilatationindicated (DI) TVCC in women with threatened PTB occurring before 26 weeks of pregnancy by evaluating their respective reproductive outcomes.METHODS:We conducted a retrospective observational study at the department of obstetrics and gynecology of the Radboud University Medical Center Nijmegen (Netherlands) between July 2002 and July 2012. RESULTS: 18 patients were included in the UI group and 10 in the DI group. UI cerclage were placed at 22 (range 16-26) weeks and DI cerclage were placed at 21 (range 17-25) weeks. Cerclage to delivery interval was 15 (range 0-23) weeks and 11 (range 1-19) weeks, resp. Mean gestational age at delivery was 37 (range 16-41) weeks and 32 (range 21-38) weeks, resp. While total births prior to 32 weeks of pregnancy were more frequent in the DI group than in the UI group (50% versus 27,8%, resp.), total neonatal survival was high in both groups(95,2% {95% CI 80,7}  and 75% {95%CI 51,5}, resp.). Pregnancy complications such as PPROM < 32 weeks was more frequent in the DI group than in the UI group (80% vs. 44,4% resp.). CONCLUSIONS: Reproductive outcomes in women undergoing TVCC for threatened PTB are successful. However, women with DI cerclage confer less benefit since 50% delivers before 32 weeks of pregnancy. TVCC remains an important therapeutic option for threatened PTB occurring before 26 weeks of pregnancy.Preventing Preterm Birth with Progesterone (The Triple P TreatStudy): A Randomized Controlled Trial.

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the effectiveness of vaginal progesterone in preventing adverse neonatal outcome in low-risk pregnant women with a short cervical length (CL) measured between 18-22 weeks of gestation.METHODS:We performed a multicentre randomised controlled trial (Triple P treat trial NTR-2078) in The Netherlands. Women at low risk for preterm birth (PTB) (women with a singleton pregnancy, without a history of PTB <34 weeks of gestation) underwent CL measurement at 18-22 weeks using transvaginal sonography. Women with a repeated CL \u226430 mm were randomly assigned to use 200mg vaginal capsules progesterone or placebo. Primary outcome was composite adverse neonatal outcome defined as RDS, BPD, IVH II B or worse, NEC, proven sepsis or death before discharge. Secondary outcomes included time to delivery, birth rates <32, 34 and 37 weeks of gestation. The required sample size was 1,920 due to unexpected low prevalence of women with a short cervix, the study was stopped after enrollment of 80 women. Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2013, we randomized 80 women. At the moment of writing, we have outcome data on 74 (93%) of randomized women. Adverse neonatal outcome occurred in 2/39 (5.1%) women in the progesterone group and in 3/35 (8.6%) women in the control group (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.1-3.1). Progesterone use led to a statistically nonsignificant reduction of delivery rates <32 weeks of gestation (3.0% vs. 9.0%; RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.03-2.6) and 34 weeks of gestation (8.0% vs. 12%; RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.15-2.6), while there was no reduction of PTB <37 weeks of gestation (15% vs. 15%; RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.34-3.03).",

INTRODUCTION: Fetuses that develop fetal growth restriction (FGR) show a decline in the growth velocity of the abdominal circumference (AC) as pregnancy progresses. Our study was performed to determine if AC<20th percentile (AC<20%) was predictive of FGR later in pregnancy and small for gestational age (SGA) neonates at birth. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of fetuses identified between 1/1/2010 and 6/30/2013 with AC <20% between 28 and 42 weeks' gestation. AC, estimated fetal weight (EFW) and birth weight (BW) were categorized by percentile based on Doubilet 1997. Fetuses <10th percentile were considered FGR and neonates <10th percentile for BW were considered SGA. Our practice is to follow FGR at term until another indication for delivery occurs (oligohydramnios, abnormal fetal testing, Doppler testing indicating brain sparing or absent diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery, no growth for 2 weeks). RESULTS: There were 1915 patients who received ultrasound between 28 and 42 weeks in the study period and 620 who met criteria.Maternal mean age was 29.5+5.4, median gestational age (GA) at diagnosis of AC<20% was 33 weeks (IQR 30weeks 3days to 37 weeks 3 days) and GA at delivery was 39 weeks 2 days (IQR 38 weeks 2 days to 40 weeks 2 days). Of infants with AC<20%, 208 (33.6%) were SGA at delivery and 138 (23.1%) were diagnosed as FGR on subsequent ultrasound. Only 2 (0.32%) were large for gestational age.CONCLUSIONS:The prediction of FGR in the literature has been limited to the calculation of EFW using equations that combine measurements of head circumference, AC and femur length. Our study documents a high rate of FGR and SGA in infants with AC<20%. Given that the expected rate of FGR and SGA is approximately 10%, following AC<20% during third trimester scanning may be useful in the prediction of FGR and SGA.PPROM inTwins: Gestational Age at Delivery and Maternal and Newborn Outcomes. Gustavo Vilchez, Anushka Chelliah, Eline Brantley, Michael Kruger, Ray Bahado-Singh. Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Wayne State University/Detroit Medical Center, Detroit, MI, USA. INTRODUCTION:There is limited data on the optimal timing of delivery for PROM in twins. We analyzed the impact of gestational age (GA) at delivery on maternal and newborn outcomes in an attempt to answer this question. METHODS: NationalCenter for Health Statistics Natality Data for the US was analyzed between 2004-2008. Qualifying twins with PROM between 32-37 weeks constituted the study group. Different GA categories in PROM group were compared to the term singletons without PROM between 37-40 weeks. Maternal and newborn outcomes were evaluated. OR 95% CI were reported for each GA interval in weeks with term singletons as the reference group. OR were adjusted for widely recognized confounders that affect perinatal outcome. RESULTS: There were a 19,010 twin PPROM cases between 32-37 weeks and 35,080 term non-PROM controls matched for year of birth and state reporting category. As shown in the table, a progressive and significant reduction of major maternal, pregnancy and newborn complications is achieved with advancing gestational age at delivery.Odds Ratios of Pregancy/Newborn Outcomes in PPROM TwinDeliveries by Gestational Age*. (N=54,090) CONCLUSIONS: We used national data , thus reducing bias due to relying exclusively on cases from high-risk centers. Twin PPROM show significant improvement in important maternal, pregnancy and newborn outcome with advancing gestational age. The improvements in newborn outcome did not occur at the expense of increased in maternal risks. The study results suggest the need to review the current clinical standard which calls for elective preterm delivery (34 weeks) in twin PROM cases that are running an uncomplicated pregnancy course.Pregnancy, Labor and Neonatal Outcomes and Optimal Timing for Induction of Labor in Gestational Diabetes.Gustavo Vilchez, 1 Anushka Chelliah, 1 Elaine Brantley, 1 Ray Bahado-Singh, 2 Robert Sokol. 1 1 Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Wayne State University/ Detroit Medical Center, Detroit, MI, USA; 2 Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Oakland University William Beaumont Medical School, USA. INTRODUCTION: Optimal timing for induction of labor (IOL) in Gestational Diabetes (GDM) is undetermined. Risks of prematurity, macrosomia, cesarean section, and post term pregnancy should be considered. The current data is inadequate to make an evidence-based recommendation. We performed a population-based study to identify the optimal gestational age(GA) for IOL. METHODS: The US Natality Database from 2007-2010 was reviewed. Inclusion criteria were:singleton deliveries, IOL, GA at 36-42wks, GDM. Exclusion criteria were:congenital anomalies, pregestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, previous cesarean, breech presentation, rupture of membranes. Non-GDM deliveries were selected as controls. Variables analyzed were:neonatal outcomes(low apgar score, assisted ventilation, NICU admission, antibiotic/surfactant use, seizures), labor complications(fetal distress, stained meconium, chorioamnionitis), delivery mode, and macrosomia(>4500g). Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios of variables by gestational age using 39wk control as reference. RESULTS: A total of 96,964 cases and 176,079 controls were included. GDM presents increased risks for all adverse outcomes compared to controls. The risk of neonatal complications and cesarean delivery are the lowest at 39wks; the risk of labor complications is the lowest at 38 wks (figure",

INTRODUCTION:  In current practice obstetric history is used as an important determinant of risk in a subsequent pregnancy and often influences clinical management. A large for gestational age (LGA) infant is associated with increased risks. Unfortunately antenatal detection is poor,and diagnosis can often only be made after birth. Also a universal definition of LGA is lacking. Our aim was to compare 4 most common definitions of LGA for their prognostic potential to predict recurrent LGA and associated maternal and neonatal outcome in subsequent pregnancy. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Netherlands Perinatal Registry between 1999 and 2007. A linked data set of first and second singleton deliveries between 36 and 43 weeks of gestation without congenital malformations was used. Four common definitions for LGA were applied: birth weight (a)\u226590th centile (b)\u226595th centile (c)\u22654,000 g (d)\u22654,500 g. Pregnancy outcome of subsequent pregnancies in women with and without a history of LGA according these four definitions were compared. Odds ratios of maternal and neonatal outcomes were calculated after adjustment for maternal age,interpregnancy interval,ethnicity,socio-economic status and diabetes. RESULTS: A total of 247,825 women were included of which 1.8%-12.3% had a LGA firstborn depending on LGA definition. A significant difference in recurrence risk for LGA was observed with the lowest recurrence risk in the \u22654,500 g definition: 25% (OR 8.6,95% CI 8.0-9.3) and highest for the \u22654,000 g definition: 51.8%(OR 5.3,). Women with a history of LGA had a higher risk of induction of labour in a subsequent pregnancy. The risk varied however from 26.1% (OR 1.6,95% CI 1.5-1.6) to 32.8% (OR 2.8,95% CI 2.7-3.0). The significant risk of birth trauma for the second child was similar for all definitions. There was a not statistically significant tendency to a lower risk for neonatal death of the subsequent child for all definitions. CONCLUSIONS: Women with a LGA first born have an increased risk of recurrent LGA, which is highest when LGA is defined as birth weight \u22654,000 g. Risk for other adverse maternal and neonatal outcome in subsequent pregnancy are not determined by the choice of the definition for LGA.Heterogeneity in the Causality of Perinatal Outcomes onNeighbourhood Level in 15 Municipalities in The Netherlands: A Population Based Study.

INTRODUCTION: To identify whether intrapartum factors during the 1st delivery at term are associated with PTB in a 2nd viable pregnancy.METHODS:Retrospective case-control cohort of women with their 1st two consecutive pregnancies (G1 & G2) carried to \u00b3 20wks gestation within a tertiary healthcare system, 2002-2012. Women whose 1st delivery was < 37wks, required a cerclage, had multiple gestation, or fetal anomalies/ aneuploidy were excluded. Those delivering G1 at term and G2 preterm \u00b3 20.0 & <37.0wks (term-PTB cases) were compared to women with a term birth for G1 and G2 (term-term controls). Data were extracted from computerized point-of-care programs; a portion were manually verified. Data were analyzed by c 2 , Student's t-test, and logistic regression. RESULTS: 38215 women met inclusion criteria. 1735 (4.5%) were term-PTB cases. Cases and controls were similar in race and maternal age. Intrapartum characteristics for G1 were compared (table). Cases delivered G1 at term, but on average 6 days earlier than controls. Cases also delivered G2 earlier (35.5 vs. 39.0 wks, p<0.001) and were more likely to have an interpregnancy interval < 1yr (4.2 vs. 1.2 %, p<0.001). In multivariable models, cesarean delivery (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2.4) and 2nd stage \u00b3 4 hrs (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8) were associated with term-PTB sequence.

INTRODUCTION:We sought to identify obstetric and social risk factors between a woman's 1st and 2nd pregnancy (P1 & P2) that may be associated with recurrent abruption. METHODS: Retrospective case-control cohort of women with their 1st two consecutive pregnancies carried to \u226520.0wks gestation within a tertiary healthcare system, 2002-2012. Women with multiple gestation, fetal anomalies, or aneuploidy were excluded. Abruption cases were identified by ICD9 codes. Women with abruptions in both P1 and P2 (cases) were compared to those with abruption only in P1 (controls). Data were extracted from computerized point-of-care programs; a portion manually verified. Analysis was by Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 40712 women, 453 (1.1%) had an abruption in P1. 18 (4.0%) had a recurrent abruption (cases). Demographics and interpregnancy interval were similar between cases and controls. Obstetric complications and potentially modifiable risk factors were compared between cases and controls(Table). Rates of preterm birth <37 wks for any indication and PPROM in P1 were similar between groups. Likewise, changes in tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use, insurance, and marital status between P1 and P2 were similar between groups. In multivariate analysis, women with interpregnancy interval < 1yr (OR 7.8, 95% CI 1.7-35.5), admission for threatened preterm labor in P1 (OR 6.4, 95% CI 1.4-30.2), tobacco use in P2 (OR 7.3, 95% CI 1.5-35.1), and hypertension in P2 (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.0-16.8) were at increased risk for recurrent abruption. CONCLUSIONS: Short interpregnancy interval, threatened preterm labor, and tobacco use are significant modifiable risk factors for recurrent abruption. Preconception counseling and prenatal care should be particularly focused on these women.Analysis of Placental Pathology in Infants Admitted to a NeonatalCare Unit.

OB/GYN, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA. INTRODUCTION: Estrogens are critical for development of female reproductive organs & adult function. Estradiol (E2) is predominant estrogen during reproductive years while Estriol (E3) is produced in significant amount only during pregnancy. It is unclear if E3 has any function in pregnancy. Effects of E3 on development of uterus & subsequent adult E2 responsiveness has not previously been investigated. METHODS: 8 pregnant CD-1 mice were treated w/ E3 (200ug/kg/d) or vehicle control via osmotic minipump beginning on day9 of gestation for 7days. At 6weeks, the female offspring (12/group) were oophorectomized & after 2weeks were treated w/ a single IP injection of either 300 ng E2 or vehicle. 6hours after injection the uteri were removed, & RNA, DNA & protein were isolated. A mouse BeadChip WG-8 expression microarray (Illumina) & DNA Methylation 3x720K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter array were performed using purified RNA or DNA. Select gene expression was verified by either quantitative RT-PCR & normalized w/ beta-actin, or Western blotting. RESULTS: E3 is the predominant estrogen produced during pregnancy.Effects of E3 on embryonic gene expression & subsequent adult E2 responsiveness have not previously been investigated. We treated pregnant mice w/ E3 & examined global gene expression, methylation profile, E2 responsiveness in adult female offspring. 611 utero genes demonstrated a permanently altered expression pattern after in utero E3 treatment compared to control group. 12 genes that are putatively associated w/ reproduction or carcinogenesis were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. In addition, over 4000 genes were either hyper-or hypo-methylated by E3 treatment. Most of the altered genes were those involved in development. Moreover in utero E3 treatment increased mRNA expression of 260 E2responsive genes in adult offspring. Interestingly, in utero E3 exposure also enhanced protein expression of a number of DNA/histone modifiers including SUZ12, EZH2, CBP, LSD1 & DNMT1, which regulate global gene transcription efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure of mice to E3 permanently changes global gene expression & methylation profiles & estrogen responsiveness of the uterus. A number of genes involved in reproduction & cancer are developmentally programmed by E3. We have identified a novel role for fetal E3 in epigenetic programming of adult gene expression, likely via regulating estrogen receptor signaling pathway & expression of some DNA/histone modifiers.",

Macarena Palominos, AnetaDobierzewska, Carlos E Irarrazabal, Marianela Sanchez, Yara Burmeister, Horacio Figueroa, Sebastian Illanes. Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Universidad de los Andes, Santiago, Chile.INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia is the major disorder of human pregnancy and is characterized by pregnancy-induced hypertension and proteinuria that affects 5 to 7% of all pregnancies. PE is associated with the increase in placental vascular resistance and oxidative stress. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of PE are still not fully understood. Previous studies have demonstrated that placental hypoxia plays a significant role in the pathophisiology of PE. The transcriptional factor NFAT5 is implicated in the regulation of expression of the genes involved in the osmotic stress response. To date, there is no published evidence linking NFAT5 with the development of PE. We hypothesized that in hypoxic placentas (human PE patients or rabbit model of IUGR) the levels of NFAT5 are higher than in controls, indicating that NFAT5 might be involved in the pathogenesis of PE, serving as a biomarker for placenta-originated disorders like PE or IUGR. The objective of this study was to compare the expression of NFAT5 in the in vitro cellular model of hypoxia, human PE and rabbit IUGR placentas. METHODS: The hypoxia was induced in JAR cells (human choriocarcinoma) by oxygen deprivation (1% O 2 ) for 3, 6, 8 and 16 hours.",

INTRODUCTION: Women who develop certain common pregnancy complications have a greater chance of developing cardiovascular disease later in life. However, most healthcare providers do not provide postpartum cardiovascular risk counselling or follow-up. The Maternal Health Clinic was established to address this gap in care. It targets women at increased risk of cardiovascular disease in order to inspire lifestyle changes, encourage long-term follow-up, and initiate primary prevention. Here we summarize results from the first 17 months of completed clinic visits. METHODS: Patients experiencing at least one relevant complication in their index pregnancy were referred to the Maternal Health Clinic through standard postpartum order sheets. Patients underwent a complete assessment including screening history, physical examination, fasting bloodwork, and urinalysis. Lifetime and 30-year cardiovascular disease risk estimates, along with a metabolic syndrome calculation, were determined for each patient. RESULTS: Complications most commonly leading to referral were gestational diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (32.7%), pre-eclampsia (29.3%), preterm birth (29.3%), and gestational hypertension (19.6%). The clinic analysis group (n=92) was compared to historical cohort groups from the Pre-Eclampsia New Emerging Team study. Patients in the clinic analysis group had significantly increased lifetime and 30year cardiovascular disease risk estimates compared to healthy controls (p<0.0001). Furthermore, 17.4% of the clinic analysis group had metabolic syndrome, compared to 6.78% of healthy controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the Maternal Health Clinic accurately identifies postpartum patients that have underlying cardiovascular risks which make them susceptible to cardiovascular disease. The clinic may serve as an effective primary prevention strategy.Continuous Sutures of the Uterine Myometrium as a Possible RiskFactor for Placenta Accreta in Subsequent Pregnancy.

INTRODUCTION: Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is one of the leading causes of maternal death. Besides medication to control uterine atony, a compression suture technique, reported by B-lynch et al. in 1997, is a known alternative to avoid hysterectomy. Although there are several reports of fertility potential after the use of B-Lynch sutures, no study has ever demonstrated its fertility potential in a long follow-up period. The objective of the present study was to investigate the method efficacy and long term fertility prognosis in patients after B-Lynch sutures for PPH. METHODS: [Study 1] A seven-year review (2005-2012) of all cases that underwent B-Lynch compression sutures for PPH in our hospital was conducted. [Study 2]",

INTRODUCTION: Mechanisms underlying the obstetrical complications and long-term outcomes of maternal obesity remain ill-defined, however placental dysfunction consequent to inflammation has been proposed as a possible contributing factor. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have recently emerged as important mediators of the chronic inflammation and oxidative stress that accompanies obesity and other metabolic disorders. Recent evidence suggests that saturated fatty acids (FA) and oxidized lipoproteins activate TLRs; and TLRs are expressed in the placenta. Thus, we aim to determine if TLRs mediate placental inflammation under conditions of maternal high fat (HF) diet.",

INTRODUCTION: Infection and/or inflammation are commonly associated with preterm delivery (PTD). Research has shown activation of the innate immune response triggers PTD in 24 hours or less in the pregnant mouse. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other pathogen associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPS) have been shown to stimulate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and trigger PTD. LPS, the ligand/agonist for theTLR4 receptor, is found in the membrane capsule of gram-negative bacteria. Previous studies have demonstrated TLR4 expression in whole uterine tissue; however, none of these studies have determined if functional TLR4 receptors are actually present on smooth muscle myocytes. METHODS: This study sought to assess if human smooth muscle myocytes express TLRs and are responsive when stimulated with PAMPs.",

Ob/Gyn, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Mononucleated cytotrophoblasts (CTB) function as placental \"stem cells\" that differentiate into multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (STB) via the villous pathway and invasive extravillous trophoblast (EVT) via the extravillous pathway. Shallow EVT invasion into the spiral artery and incomplete spiral artery remodeling are often seen in preeclampsia (PE). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding 21-25 nucleotide RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. We have shown that angiogenesis-associated miRNA-20b that targets on EFNB2 and both are upregulated in PE placentas compared to controls. Hypothesis: MiRNA-20b inhibits CTB syncytialization via the villous pathway and EVT migration and invasion via the extravillous pathway. METHODS: MiR-20b precursor was cloned into lentiviral pGIPZ vector, packaged and tittered in 293T cells. The lentiviral vectors were used for overexpressing miR-20b in both human extravillous trophoblast derived HTR-8/SVneo cells and human placenta choriocarcinoma trophoblast derived BeWo cells. BeWo cells were used as the cell model to study CTB syncytialization. Cell fusion was determined by counting the percentage of multinucleated STB-like cells that BeWo cells formed after culture for 2-3 days. Cell migration and invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells were assessed by transwell migration and matrigel invasion assays. RESULTS: Overexpression of miR-20b suppressed BeWo cell fusion along with EFNB2 downregulation. Overexpression of miR-20b in HTR-8/SVneo cells significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of preeclampsia-upregulated angiogenesis-associated miRNA-20b and downregulation of EFNB2 inhibit CTB syncytiolization via the villous pathway and EVT migration and invasion via the extravillous pathway.

INTRODUCTION: The etiology of preeclampsia (PE) is thought to involve poor placentation during early pregnancy. To explore causality, we obtained surplus chorionic villous samples (CVS, ~11.5 week) as reported before(Founds 2009). Microarray was performed on samples from 4 women that developed PE matched to 8 normal pregnant women. Intriguingly, differentially expressed genes (DEG) down-regulated in PE included putative decidualization (DEC) genes, like PRL, IGFBP-1, and PAEP. Thus, the objective was to test the potential link between PE and aberrant DEC during early pregnancy and pre-DEC of the late secretory endometrium (LSE). METHODS: We employed the Bioconductor software to re-analyze publically available microarray datasets: CVS as described above (GSE12767); menstrual cycle samples from proliferative through LSE (n=24; GSE4888, Talbi 2006; GSE6364, Burney 2007); confluent DEC obtained from early intrauterine pregnancy (IUP; n=7) and non-DEC endometrium (EM) (n=5; E-MTAB-680, Duncan 2011); and in vitro DEC EM temporally exposed to trophoblast-conditioned medium (DEC+TR; n=14; GSE5809, Hess 2007). CVS and DEC datasets were compared by t-test (limma package) to determine down-and up-regulated DEG in CVS-PE and DEC, respectively. Time course data from MC and DEC+TR were analyzed by Bayesian estimation (betr package) to identify clusters of genes increasing in expression by LSE or TR induction. The DEG (p<0.05)",

METHODS: We studied male OFF whose mothers ate either control (C) (20% casein) or restricted (R) (10% casein) isocaloric diet in P and L. After weaning all pups ate C diet. At postnatal day (PND) 108 male OFF were tested in the MWM.

Maternal and umbilical cord Vitamin D status may influence risk for development of childhood allergies. Vitamin D has a known immuno-modulatory effect on T cell differentiation, inhibiting Th1 and promoting Th2 response. We aimed to determine whether maternal or cord blood Vitamin D levels are associated with Th2/Th1-associated chemokine ratios that may precede the development of childhood allergies. We hypothesized that vitamin D levels would be directly related to Th2/ Th1 ratios. METHODS: We enrolled 126 women in a randomized controlled trial of prenatal supplementation with EPA-and DHA-rich fish oil or soy oil placebo for prevention of perinatal depression. Maternal blood was drawn at enrollment (12-20 weeks) and after supplementation (34-36 weeks). Umbilical cord blood was collected at delivery. Plasma samples from 117 women and 97 newborns (cord plasma) were analyzed for chemokines and 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Ratios of log-transformed chemokines [Th2 macrophage-derived chemokine, MDC (CCL22)]/ [Th1 interferon-inducible protein-10, IP-10 (CXCL10)] and [Th2 thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, TARC (CCL17)]/ IP-10 (CXCL10)] were modeled outcomes. Multiple linear regression was performed to examine associations between treatment group and vitamin D levels with chemokine ratios, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Mean cord blood vitamin D was 22.3 ng/ml. Cord blood vitamin D was significantly correlated with maternal vitamin D levels at enrollment (P<0.0001) and at 34-36 weeks (P<0.0001). We previously found that omega-3 supplementation was significantly associated with reduced umbilical cord MDC/IP10 and TARC/IP10 ratios, after adjusting for gestational age at delivery and mode of delivery. In this expanded analysis, there was no independent association between vitamin D levels and chemokine ratios in maternal or cord blood. Including vitamin D in these models did not alter the originally-observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal and cord blood vitamin D status was not associated with pro-allergic Th2 to Th1 chemokine ratios.",

In this study we (1) defined physiological significance of TRPV4 channels as a Ca 2+ entry pathway in the ECs of uteroplacental arteries, and (2) elucidated their contribution to ACh-induced EC [Ca 2+ ] i responses. METHODS: The diameters, SMC membrane potential (MP, microelectrodes) and [Ca 2+ ] i (fura 2) responses to activation of TRPV4 channels with GSK 1016790A were studied using pressurized arteries from pregnant rats. ACh-and GSK-induced EC [Ca 2+ ] i responses were characterized in small sheets of ECs. The effects of GSK on MP of ECs were tested using perforated patch clamp methodology. RT PCR was performed to quantify mRNA levels of TRPV4 in uterine vasculature. RESULTS: Activation of TRPV4 channels with GSK resulted in NOindependent endothelium-mediated vasodilation. The dilator responses at 10 nM GSK (78 \u00b1 7 %, n = 8) were associated with SMC hyperpolarization (by -22 \u00b1 3 mV) and SMC [Ca 2+ ] i reduction. GSK induced concentrationdependent elevation of EC [Ca 2+ ] i , that was 418 \u00b1 45 nM (n = 4) at 10 nM. HC067047, an inhibitor of TRPV4 channels, abolished GSKinduced responses. TRAM-34, an inhibitor of intermediate conductance Ca 2+ -activated K + (IK Ca ) channels markedly attenuated GSK responses. EC hyperpolarization (-25 \u00b1 6 mV, n = 5) to GSK was reversed by charybdotoxin. ACh-induced elevation of [Ca 2+ ] i in EC sheets was reduced by HC067047 by 76 % (n = 4). TRPV4 expression in uteroplacental radial arteries was two-fold higher compared to that in main uterine artery. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial TRPV4 channels are essential Ca 2+ entry pathway in ECs of uteroplacental arteries. TRPV4-mediated Ca 2+ entry hyperpolarizes ECs through activation of IK Ca channels resulting in SMC hyperpolarization, [Ca 2+ ] i reduction and vasodilation. Activators of TRPV4 channels may improve EC Ca 2+ signaling and uterine vascular function in complicated pregnancies. Supported by NIH HL088245.",

Miira M Klemetti, 1 Tea Kaartokallio, 1 Paivi Lakkisto, 2 Hannele Laivuori. 1 1 Department of Medical Genetics, Haartman Institute, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; 2 Department of Clinical Chemistry, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. INTRODUCTION: Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive pregnancy disorder, characterized by metabolic abnormalities similar to the metabolic syndrome. Prior PE increases cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) risk. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory stress-response enzyme. During pregnancy, HO-1 seems to be cytoprotective in the placenta, as the over-expression of HO-1 inhibits the production of antiangiogenic factors. HO-1 might also protect the maternal endothelium facilitating adaptation to pregnancy. The GTn short length allele (S, <25 repeats) of the HO-1 gene (HMOX1) is associated with increased HMOX1 expression compared with the long length allele (L, \u226525 repeats). The L allele has been linked to elevated T2DM and CVD risks. We studied whether the long GTn allele of the HMOX1 is associated with PE or its sub-phenotypes. METHODS: We genotyped the GT n repeat polymorphism in 759 PE and 779 control women using DNA fragment analysis. PE was defined according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' criteria. PE diagnosed at 34+0 gestational weeks or later was defined as late-onset. Birth weights <-2.0 SD units were classified as small-for-dates (SFD). The statistical methods used were the Mann-Whitney U-test and the Chi square test. RESULTS: There was no association between the long allele of the GT n repeat of the HMOX1 and PE. In subgroup analyzes, the LL genotype was associated with non-severe PE (p=0.037) and the L allele with non-severe (p=0.011), non-recurrent (p=0.046) and late-onset (p=0.019) PE, and with PE without a SFD infant (p=0.030). The LL genotype was associated with PE in women who smoked before (p=0.032) or during (p<0.001) pregnancy and the L allele with PE in women who smoked during pregnancy (p=0.013). CONCLUSIONS: According to one hypothesis, abnormal placentation typically characterizes early-onset PE while maternal metabolic risk factors may be more significant in late-onset PE. The association of the GT n long allele with the late-onset, less severe PE is in agreement with the previous associations of this polymorphism with T2DM and CVD and shared metabolic risk factors. Smoking could protect subjects with the S allele against PE by inhibiting the production of antiangiogenic factors. Pathogenesis of severe gestational complications as preeclampsia, eclampsia, HELLP-Syndrome, abruption of placenta, IUGR is associated with altered angiogenic biomarker levels. Aim of this study is to determine if maternal serum angiogenic biomarker ratio (sFlt-1/PlGF) can predict maternal and/or fetal, neonatal complications during pregnancy.",

We measured serum levels of sFlt-1 and PlGF by ELISA and calculated sFlt-1/ PLGF-ratio every 4-6 weeks from week 10 until the end of pregnancy. Maternal and fetal/neonatal complications were analyzed subsequently. We also evaluated effects of applied medication (acetylsalicylic acid, low molecular heparin) on gestational biomarker levels. RESULTS: sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was up to ten times higher in women with adverse pregnancy outcome, even without preeclampsia, i.e. early placenta abruption at 24 th week of pregnancy, compared to pregnancies without complications. Two to twelve weeks before clinical manifestation of gestational complications ratio-levels started to rise. Application of acetylsalicylic acid and/or heparin was associated with an immediate and constant strong decrease of the ratio after administration. CONCLUSIONS: Women with high risk to develop severe complications during pregnancy like abruption of placenta or severe preeclampsia showed strong increase of sFlt-1/PIGF ratio up to twelve weeks before clinical manifestation of these events. Protective effects of acetylsalicylic acid can be demonstrated once again by a decrease of sFlt-1/PlGF ratio levels in our study. Further results of this ongoing clinical study will be available in March.",

INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia is a systemic disease affecting about 5% of all pregnant women. The pathophysiology of preeclampsia involves systemic inflammation and antiangiogenic state. Lipid disorders are characterized by chronic inflammation and therefore, can act as precursors for preeclampsia. Additionally, some specific lipids can have different biological roles that may be related to the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. METHODS: Lipidomic analysiswas performed in plasma and placental samples from pregnant women with early-onset preeclampsia and controls (N=10, for each).Lipid extraction was performed using the Bligh-Dyer protocol and lipid profiles were obtained by mass espectrometry (MALDI TOF-TOF). R E S U LT S : P l a s m a s a m p l e s o f p r e e c l a m p s i a r e v e a l e d Glycerophosphoserines-PS as the most prevalent lipid (52.3%), followed by the Glycerophosphoethanolamines-Pet (24.03%), Glycerophosphocholines-PC (9.47%) and 39%) . This lipid profile was diferent from controls (P<0,0001). Placental samples of preeclampsia revealed Glycerophosphoserines-PS as the most prevalent lipid representing (56.28%), followed by the Polyketides-PLK (32.77%), The lipid profile of placental samples was also diferente from controls (P<0,0001). CONCLUSIONS: The identification of specific lipidic profile in plasma and placental samples of preeclamptic women suggest the participation of these molecules in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia.",

RESULTS: Women in the H-FGR group (n=72) were older, with higher BMI, and higher rate of preterm labor (<34 weeks) than in the N-FGR group (n=270), p<0.001 for all. Composite neonatal outcome was worse in the H-FGR than in the N-FGR group, 50% vs. 15.5%, p<0.001. Higher rate of maternal placental vascular lesions was detected in H-FGR compared with N-FGR, 82% vs. 57.7%, p<0.001. By using a stepwise logistic regression model, maternal BMI (1.13 OR, CI 1.035-1.227, p=0.006) and neonatal birth-weight (0.996 OR, CI 0.995-0.998, p<0.001) were independently associated with worse neonatal outcome.

INTRODUCTION: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is implicated in the development of vascular dysfunction in preeclampsia. Evidence in vitro and in vivo indicates that ET-1 attenuates vasodilatation in humans and in animal models. The mechanisms causing this attenuation and possible ways of alleviating this have not been investigated. METHODS: Human resistance arteries (HRA) were dissected from subcutaneous fat biopsies obtained from pregnant women (n=30) upon caesarean section. HRA were mounted for isometric force recording and contracted with 1mM norepinephrine (NE) or 10nM ET-1 and the relaxations to cumulative additions of Acetylcholine (ACh), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), bradykinin (BK), zaprinast (ZAP) or calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) were compared. The effects of Tempol, ascorbic acid (AA), L-NAME, indomethacin (IN) and CGRP added prior to the ET-1 and/or NE contractions were assesed on ACh-and SNP-relaxations. RESULTS: HRA contracted with similar amplitudes to ET-1 or NE but ACh-relaxations, which relaxed NE-contracted HRA to 100%, were reduced by half after ET-1 induced contractions. Similar results were obtained for BK and ZAP. Inhibiting NO-and Prostagladin (PG)-synthesis by combined addition of L-NAME and IN attenuated ACh relaxations to a similar extent in ET-1 and NA-contracted HRA. The attenuation by ET-1 was not counteracted by AA or Tempol. CGRP relaxed NEprecontracted HRA to 90\u00b15% and ET1-precontracted HRA to 71\u00b15% (n=8). The amplitude of contractions to ET-1 in the presence or absence of 10pM CGRP were similar, but the presence of CGRP increased the maximal relaxations obtained by both ACh and SNP. CONCLUSIONS: CGRP showed the highest resistance against the attenuating effects of ET-1 on HRA-relaxations, which were not due to interference with PG-or NO-release (either directly or through generation of oxygen radicals). CGRP at concentrations devoid of vasodilator activity, increased the endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxations in HRA. This study presents in vitro evidence on the paradigm of \"CGRP as the natural antagonist of ET1\" and opens up important perspectives for alternative avenues of treating pre-eclampsia.",

INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia is characterized by an increased level of S-nitrosylated protein and a decreased concentration of ascorbate (Asc), a compound required for the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nitroyslated proteins. This relationship suggests that reduced NO bioavailability contributes to preeclampsia. Mice lacking S-nitrosglutathione reductase (GSNOR), a denitrosylase that regulates S-nitrosylation, have increased levels of S-nitrosylated proteins and exhibit symptoms of preeclampsia, including hypertension and proteinuria. We investigated if these mice also show abnormal placental vascularization, one of the primary causes of preeclampsia, and whether ascorbate administration can rescue this pathological phenotype. METHODS: Pregnant GSNOR -\u00a4and control mice (N=5-7 mothers) were studied at late pregnancy (day 17.5). Ascorbate was provided in drinking water beginning at day 0.5. Umbilical venous blood velocity waveform and diameter were determined using micro-ultrasound. Flow was calculated from the mean velocity and vessel area. Fetoplacental capillary density was determined from placental sections stained for isolectin. RESULTS: GSNOR -\u00a4mice had fewer (4.5 \u00b1 1 vs. 8.1 \u00b1 0.5 in controls, P<0.01) and smaller (0.74 \u00b1 0.02 g vs. 0.83 \u00b1 0.02 g in controls, P<0.01) pups. Umbilical venous blood flow was lower in GSNOR -\u00a4fetuses (0.22 \u00b1 0.01 ml/min vs. 0.28 \u00b1 0.01 ml/min in controls, P<0.001) at late gestation. Fetoplacental capillary density was reduced by 19% in GSNOR -\u00a4fetuses compared to controls (P<0.001). Ascorbate treatment improved both umbilical venous blood flow (+36% in Asc treated, P<0.001) and fetoplacental capillary density (+10% in Asc treated, P<0.001) in GSNOR -\u00a4fetuses. Ascorbate treatment also improved fetal survival (4.5 \u00b1 1 vs. 7.1 \u00b1 1 pups per litter in Asc treated, P<0.01) whereas it did not affect fetal growth. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the tight regulation of S-nitrosylation during pregnancy by GSNOR plays an essential role in promoting placental vascularization and augmenting umbilical venous blood flow in pregnancy. These findings also demonstrate that ascorbate supplementation may serve to prevent or treat preeclampsia. Supported by CIHR and NIH.",

INTRODUCTION: RAS is one of the earliest hormone systems to recognise pregnancy and has been implicated in placentation 1 . Angiotensin II (AngII) increases NADPH oxidase via its type 1 receptors (AT1R) and is thus linked with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress, such as seen in PE 2 . AngII via its type 2 receptors (AT2R) balances this. The type 4 receptor (AT4R) may be involved in regulation of placentation and is reduced in PE 1 . The adenosine receptor A2aR is also known to regulate endothelial cell ROS production and enhances AngII's effects; blockade of A2aR protects these cells from acute AngIIinduced oxidative stress. METHODS: After written consent, placental samples were obtained from women undergoing elective surgical termination of pregnancy between 8-10 weeks' (Early TOP; n=8) and 12-14 weeks' gestation (Late TOP; n = 11). Samples were also collected from term NC (n = 11) and PE (n = 10) pregnancies. Protein expression of A2aR, HIF1a, AT1R, AT2R and AT4R was determined by immunohistochemistry; quantified by ImageScope (Aperio, UK).",

The heritable predisposition towards endometriosis motivates an interest in identify the genes and genomic variants involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to this disease. Here we investigated in Pakistani women the association of endometriosis and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in genes previously identified in the development of this disease. METHODS: DNA samples from fifty-two genetically unrelated endometriosis subjects with endometriosis and fifty-two randomly selected controls were analyzed by direct sequencing to determine polymorphisms in 4 genes. These included estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) (rs2234693 C/T, rs9340799 G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)), estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) (rs4986938 G/A SNP), progesterone receptor (PGR) (rs1042838 G/T, rs10895068 G/A SNPs) and interleukin 10 (IL10) (rs1800871 C/T, rs1800872 C/A and rs1800896 G/A SNPs).",

INTRODUCTION: Endometriosis is a complex disease with significant genetic predisposition that affects 6-10% of reproductive-aged women. GWAS offer valuable insight into complex diseases that carry genetic risk. Previous GWAS have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which contribute to endometriosis development. The majority of SNPs are located in non-coding regions of the genome, however, a few are found in close proximity to functional genes. Two such genes are WNT4 and VEZT. We hypothesize that expression of these genes are regulated by the SNPs of interest, and protein expression studies will provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of endometriosis. METHODS: Women undergoing laparoscopy at the Royal Woman's Hospital (Melbourne) were recruited for this study. A questionnaire, blood sample and eutopic endometrium were collected. Blood samples were genotyped and subsequently women were categorised as homogeneous for the risk allele (RA), homogeneous for the other allele (OA) or heterogeneous (Het.). Expression of Wnt4 and VEZT were investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot. RESULTS: Immunoreactive Wnt4 was present in the glandular epithelium and stroma of the endometrium.Expression is mainly cytosolic. Quantitative analysis of the Western blot 39kDa band from RA (n=5), OA (n=26) and Het. (n=14) women did not demonstrate any differential expression of Wnt4 protein. VEZT protein was expressed in the glandular epithelium and was largely restricted to the cytosol. Western blot analysis of the 89kDa band from RA (n=8), OA (n=26) and Het. (n=22) women did not demonstrate any differential expression of VEZT protein. CONCLUSIONS: Neither Wnt4 nor VEZT showed differential expression between women homozygous for risk alleles or other alleles.Further investigation of expression patterns of additional genes are required to develop insights into the functionality of endometriosis risk alleles identified by GWAS.",

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the analgesic effect of a new formulation for topical application during insertion of Intra Uterine Device (IUD). METHODS: SHACT is a proprietary 4 % L lidocaine formulation developed by Pharmanest AB. It is applied topically at the portio, in the cervical canal and into the uterus with a proprietary device developed by Pharmanest AB. SHACT is thermogelling and becomes a gel at body temperature, which minimizes the leakage after application. In a first study in women (Phase I) the pharmacokinetic properties of SHACT were investigated. The study showed that the majority of women had measurable levels of Lidocain after 5 minutes supporting a rapid onset of action. No toxicity concerns were observed during the study. A confirmatory efficacy and safety study with SHACT was a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial involving 218 nulliparous women between 18 and 45 years of age. All were planned for insertion of an IUD. RESULTS: Data from the study shows that women receiving SHACT during IUD insertion experienced an analgesic effect with less pain, measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), compared to patients who received placebo. This effect was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Overall this study clearly demonstrates significant reduction in pain during insertion of an IUD. The effect size is of clinical importance since on average 3 out of 4 patients will experience an advantage of SHACT compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: SHACT has proven to be an effective analgesia, easy to apply and with fast onset of action at IUD insertion. Pharmanest AB can also see significant potential for other clinical use and plans to further explore other indications in clinical trials.",

Megan D Whitham, 1 Qian Wang, 2 Meagan A Barry, 2 Hotez J Peter, 2 Heffernan J Michael. 2 1 Medicine, Virginia Tech Carilion, Roanoke, VA, USA; 2 Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. INTRODUCTION: Protein-based vaccines have great potential to treat cancer and intracellular pathogens, causes of obstetric and gynecological complications (HSV, HPV/CIN, Chlamydia). Proteins generate weak cellular immune responses alone and need adjuvants to boost TH1-type responses. This has spurred exploration of adjuvants able to drive a cellular response and microparticle platforms to enhance delivery to antigenpresenting cells. We investigated the immune profile for a vaccine formed with model protein ovalbumin (OVA) and TLR 7 agonist imiquimod (Imiq). OVA and Imiq were encapsulated in microparticles of poly(lacticco-glycolic) acid (PLGA). We hypothesized that this formulation would enhance the TH1-type response to OVA when compared to microparticles without adjuvant and soluble forms. METHODS: Microparticle formulation: Microparticles were formed by a double emulsion, solvent evaporation method of 2.5 mg OVA, 1.0 mg Imiq and 100 mg PLGA. In vivo immunogenicity: Microparticles in 100 \u00b5L were injected c.c. in C57BL/6 mice, boosted on day 14 and sacrificed at 6 weeks. Blood samples were taken on days 0, 14, 28, and 42, pooled, and analyzed for OVA-specific antibodies by ELISA. Collected splenocytes were restimulated with OVA and analyzed for IFN-g production. Statistical analysis of IFN-g production was by ANOVA followed by student's t test. RESULTS: IgG2b antibody titer was greatest for microparticles of PLGA[OVA] + PLGA [Imiq] . INTRODUCTION: Women with a previous pregnancy related disorder are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life. We investigated the relation of miscarriage and early preterm birth to the risk of future cardiovascular (CV) events. METHODS: We included 1625 women from the SMART study, a prospective cohort study among patients with clinically manifest atherosclerotic disease or risk factors for atherosclerosis. All women had a history of \u2265 1 pregnancy and had either symptomatic CVD(cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease or abdominal aortic aneurysm, n = 910) or were asymptomatic with a risk factor (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, n = 715). After enrolment, women were followed for the occurrence of (new) CV events. Hazard ratios (HR) for women with and without miscarriage (gestational age (GA) <14 wks, n = 420) and early preterm birth (GA 14-32 wks, n = 165) were estimated. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 5.1 years, 65 (5.9%) women without a previous miscarriage and early preterm birth, 24 (5.7%) women with miscarriage and 11 (6.7%) women with early preterm birth, had a (new) CV event. Compared to women without a pregnancy related disorder, those with an early preterm birth did not have an increased risk of CV events (1.16 (95% CI 0.61-2.20) but did have a significant increased risk of CV mortality (HR 2.41 (95% CI 1.01-5.75) (figure 1).

Akshata Naik, 1,2 Nakisha Rutledge, 1 Roberto Romero, 2 Sonia Hassan, 1,2 Nardhy Gomez-Lopez. 1,2 1 Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA; 2 Perinatology Research Branch, NICHD/NIH/DHHS, Detroit, MI, USA. INTRODUCTION: The two main strategies for the prevention of preterm birth are the administration of vaginal progesterone (P4) to women with a short cervix or 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17OHP-C) to women with a history of preterm birth. A recent randomized clinical trial suggested that vaginal P4 was superior to 17OHP-C (Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 2013; 92:215-22) . However, the mechanisms by which these agents prevent preterm delivery remain to be determined. Since progestogens have immunomodulatory functions, we conducted studies to investigate the effects of P4 and 17OHP-C on cells involved in parturition: decidual macrophages and T regulatory cells. METHODS: Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were treated with vaginal P4 (2mg/200mL, n=10) or 17OHP-C (2mg/100mL, n=10) from 13 to 17 days post-coitum (dpc). Replens (200mL, n=10) or castor oil (100mL, n=10) were controls. On 18.5 dpc, mice were euthanized. Thymus, spleen, inguinal and uterine lymph nodes, decidua and peripheral blood were harvested. Extensive immunophenotyping was conducted using flow cytometry for the following cells: CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ regulatory T cells (Tregs, CD4+CD25+ FoxP3+/ CD8+CD25+FoxP3+), monocytes/macrophages (CD45+F4/80+), dendritic cells (CD45+CD11c+), neutrophils (CD45+Ly6G+) and NK cells (CD45+CD49b+). Statistical analysis was performed with nonparametric statistics and a p\u22640.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: 1) The proportion of decidual macrophages was significantly lower after treatment with vaginal P4 than placebo (p=0.01) or 17OHP-C (p=0.014); 2) treatment with vaginal P4 was associated with a greater number of CD4+ and CD8+ Tregs in lymphatic organs than with 17OHP-C (p<0.05). Interestingly, treatment with 17OHP-C showed reduced proportions of CD8+ Tregs in inguinal lymph nodes compared to treatment with castor oil (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with vaginal P4 reduces the recruitment of macrophages to decidua, and causes an expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ Tregs in lymphatic organs -17OHP-C did not have any of these effects. This observation suggests that treatment with vaginal P4, but not 17OHP-C, promotes a maternal systemic anti-inflammatory response (as assessed by the number of Tregs in lymphatic organs) and reduces decidual macrophages. These novel findings may provide insight into the mechanism whereby vaginal P4 prevents preterm birth.",

INTRODUCTION: Placental mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been investigated in healthy placentas. Here we characterize placental MSC in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) compared to appropriate for gestational age (AGA) pregnancies. METHODS: Cells were isolated from amnion and chorion of 6 IUGR, 5 term AGA, 1 pre-term AGA human placentas at elective cesarean section. Cell viability and proliferation were assessed every 7 days over a 6-wk culture. Expression of hematopoietic (CD45), hematopoietic stem (CD133,CD34,CD117), endothelial (CD31,CD146,CD90) and mesenchymal (CD105,CD29,CD44,CD73,CD90) markers was evaluated by flow cytometry. To test differentiation potential, cells were cultured in appropriate media inducing differentiation into osteogenic (OS), adipogenic (AD), and chondrogenic (CHD) lineages at 30 days, and myogenic and endothelial lineages at 10 days. RESULTS: Cell viability was high in all samples. Proliferation rate was increased in amnion-derived cells compared to chorion, with no differences among IUGR, term and pre-term AGA. All samples presented a starting heterogeneous population, which progressively lost hematopoietic and endothelial markers and increased mesenchymal markers. This occurred earlier in IUGR than in term and pre-term AGA: at day 7 mesenchymal markers were 1.6-4 fold (amnion) and 2.3-5.8 fold (chorion) higher in IUGR. All cells differentiated into mesodermal-specific (AD,OS,CHD) lineages. However, IUGR cells showed lower endothelial and myogenic (mainly smooth muscle) differentiation potentials. CONCLUSIONS: We observed mesenchymal markers enrichment and multipotent differentiation abilities, confirming successful isolation and selection of MSC from amnion and chorion. In IUGR placentas the MSC population was more resistant and earlier selected, but showed lower myogenic and endothelial differentiation potentials, especially in chorion. Potentially, this may also indicate maternal decidual involvement and needs further investigation. INTRODUCTION: Perinatal brain damage as well as other neurodegenerative diseases that may lead to a hypomyelination of the brain's white matter still don't have an effective treatment. The use of Wharton's Jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSC) may be a promising approach to cure such diseases. Especially their soluble factors have shown in vitro and in vivo beneficial effects on neurogenesis and neuroregeneration. Therefore, the objective was to assess the effect of the secretome of WJ-MSC on neuroregeneration in vitro. METHODS: Hippocampal rat neural progenitor cells (NPC) were exposed either to treatment with human WJ-MSC-conditioned medium (CM), to direct co-culture or to indirect co-culture (transwell) with WJ-MSC. After exposure, their astro-and oligodendroglial expression profile was assessed by immunocytochemistry, real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Time points of measurement were after 48h, 96h and 144h. Furthermore, the differences between WJ-MSC harvested from term or pre-term pregnancies were evaluated. RESULTS: The expression of astroglial markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, p < 0.01) or oligodendroglial markers like myelin basic protein (MBP, not significant) were increased on NPC after being exposed to the different conditions. Interestingly, WJ-MSC from term pregnancies were able to induce more strongly the expression of glial markers when compared to preterm WJ-MSC whereas preterm WJ-MSC induced stronger neuronal markers. The co-culture had a more prominent effect on the expression of glial markers when compared to the CM. CONCLUSIONS: Paracrine factors of WJ-MSC from term or preterm pregnancies increase the expression of astroglial markers like GFAP and oligodendroglial markers like MBP in NPC. These findings indicate a possible supportive role of transplanted WJ-MSC in the neuroregenerative -notably remyelinating -potential of endogenous NPC.

Pathology, Leeds University, United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION: Cytokine-hormone network deregulations underpin many reproductive disorders but our understanding of how these function in vivo remains patchy. We used Bayesian networks to analyse cytokinehormone interactions in vivo using murine lactation as a dynamic, physiological model. METHODS: CD1 mice (8 pups/dam) were sacrificed on lactation days 1, 2, 4, 10, 16, 21 and 24. Two other groups of dams had their litters removed post partum and were sacrificed on days 2 and 4 (each group, n=8). Serum was isolated post cardiac puncture and circulatory estrogen, progesterone (ELISA), prolactin (radioimmunoassay) and twenty-three cytokine (multiplex immunoassay) levels were measured. MetaCore/ hand curation generated seeded networks which were combined with text mining results (Predictionet). Edges causing feedback loops were removed. z-score normalisations were applied to raw data (Matlab) prior to Bayesian network analysis. A machine learning algorithm (MeV) refined the seed network together with experimental data. For each iteration, the Tabu Search algorithm was used to optimise the Bayes score as the scoring metric. Model robustness was assured by high stringency bootstrapping (0.9). Directed acyclic graphs were created in Cytoscape. Validation was performed by constructing variational Bayesian state space models (VBSSMs) in Matlab. In silico perturbation of eotaxin, interleukin (IL)-3, IL-12 (p40), IL-13, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and prolactin was performed by altering their conditional probability bin allocations.",

These relationships were broadly conserved in VBSSMs. In silico perturbation suggested that IL-12 (p40), IL-13 and MCP-1 were primary network drivers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the merit of Bayesian networks in describing cytokine-hormone interactions (antagonism, synergy, redundancy) and the structural conservation of their networks across physiological scenarios. The fact that in silico lactation nodal perturbations could predict the qualitative network responses induced by abrogating lactation suggests that such Bayesian approaches may find uses in identifying novel pharmacological targets and foresee likely physiological responses to their exogenous manipulation. Recently soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE) has been identified and its levels are correlated with the severity of preeclampsia. However, it remains unknown whether RAGE is associated with recurrent pregnancy losses (RPL). In this study, we examined whether sRAGE was increased in PRL compared with age-matched control women who has no history of pregnancy loss and if it could be a potential biomarker for RPL. We further investigated which anthropometric, metabolic and inflammatory variables were independently correlated with sRAGE in women with idiopathic RPL.",

Additionally, various cytokines were measured by Luminex \u00ae . Resistance index of the uterine artery (Ut-RI) was measured by pulsed doppler ultrasonography. We statically analyzed the independent determinants of sRAGE levels by univariate and stepwise multivariate regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: sRAGE levels were significantly higher in RPL group than those of controls (1528.9\u00b1704 vs. 1149.9\u00b1447 pg/ml, P<0.01). The multivariate analysis revealed that insulin, PAI-1, Ut-RI and ratios of TNFa/IL10 producing T helper cells were significantly associated with sRAGE levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that sRAGE may be a novel biomarker for RPL.

Obese women have a substantially higher risk of developing complications during labour and are at increased risk of emergency caesarean section due to uterine dysfunction and prolonged labour. As contractile associated proteins (CAP's) are essential to spontaneous myometrial contractions, this pilot study investigated the effects of increasing BMI on CAP expression within human term uterine tissue. METHODS: All participants provided written informed consent to participate. BMI was calculated from height and weight measurements provided during 10-12 weeks pregnancy booking. Myometrial biopsies were collected from healthy singleton pregnant women (n=4) at planned caesarean section (term 37 weeks) following delivery and before administration of oxytocin. Myometrial samples were frozen and stored at -80 o C for western blot analysis of the CAPs caveolin-1 (Cav1), connexin 43 (Cx-43) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX2). Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between BMI and CAP expression at the P<0.05 level. RESULTS: Myometrial expression of Cav-1, Cx-43 & COX-2 all share an inverse relationship with increasing BMI (see Fig.1 ), however significant correlations were only observed with COX-2 (r 2 -0.94, P<0.03) and Cx-43 (r 2 -0.96, P<0.02) respectively.",

Cx-43 is a gap junction protein involved in synchronisation of electrical activity in individual myocytes and COX-2 is responsible for synthesis of prostaglandins that regulate uterine contractility. Decreased expression of these key CAP's may be a potential or contributory mechanism of uterine dystocia in woman with abnormally high BMI. (FOS, JUN) . We suggest that derepression of Cx43 during labor is mediated by change in the expression of AP-1 proteins and the proportion of JUN/FOS heterodimers vs JUN/ JUN homodimers. We hypothesize that PRA/B mediate Cx43 transcription by binding to FOS and JUN proteins at AP-1 sites and that PRA/B have differential affinity for FOS and JUN members which affects their ability to repress Cx43 transcription. METHODS: For in vivo studies, myometrial samples were collected from CD-1 mice throughout gestation, and during labor (n=6), total proteins were extracted, the expression of JUNs, FOSs, P54nrb and PRs was analyzed by western blot. In vitro protein-DNA binding assays were performed to examine the recruitment of PRs to the Cx43 promoter. Co-Immunoprecipitation and Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) were performed to determine the interactions of PR isoforms with AP-1 transcription factors and co-repressors. RESULTS: The protein expression of PRA, cFOS, FRA-1 and JUNB were significantly up-regulated during active labor as compared to late gestation. In contrast, protein expression of p54 nrb was significantly downregulated. Using the myometrial SHM cell line, we overexpressed different JUN/FOS members and examined the recruitment of PR isoforms to Cx43 promoter. We found that PRB failed to bind to the Cx43 promoter in the presence of cFOS and FRA-1, shows stronger affinity to JUN than to FOS family members and interacts with the transcriptional co-repressor protein p54 nrb . PRA was recruited to the Cx43 promoter in the presence of all AP-1 proteins, showed affinity for both JUN/FOS, and does not interact with p54 nrb . CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that the up-regulation of PRA and FOS proteins increases the probability of PRA-JUN/FOS heterodimer complex formation that, in the absence of p54 nrb , binds to the Cx43 promoter resulting in de-repression of Cx43 gene transcription and labor onset. (FIRS) has been reported to be as a cause of fetal injury that related with cerebral palsy of preterm neonates. Inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, which are shown to be increased in FIRS, are involved in fetal damage. Preterm birth has been increasing and it is a very significant problem for society to increase these handy-capped children. However, there remain no effective therapies from fetal damage. In this study, it is investigated whether the maternal administration of hydrogen water(HW) may be effective on the mouse model of FIRS.

INTRODUCTION: Preterm birth is a major medical concern, and grows in rate in spite of ameliorations in medical care. Tocolytic agents approved to prolong gestation have at best modest short-term efficacy. The PGF2a receptor (FP) is highly expressed in myometrium and decidua during labor; the absence of FP is associated with failure of labor induction and expulsion of the fetus. PGF2a induces expression of uterine activation proteins and exerts myometrial contractions . Antagonists to FP have been shown to be effective in arresting myometrial contractions ex vivo and in vivo animal models. Allosteric effects on FP may modulate the multiplicity of actions evoked by PGF2a. For example, we have previously reported that the indolizidinone analog PDC113.824 directs FP by potentiating PGF2a-induced PKC-Erk1/2 signaling while inhibiting PGF2a-triggered Rho/ROCK signaling. PDC113.824 inhibits myometrial contractions and in turn delays murine preterm birth induced by PGF2a as well as LPS. METHODS: Studying the structure activity relationships of PDC113.824 to better understand the factors controlling FP activity, we replaced the indolizidin-2-one by different aza-amino acyl proline residues: aza-glycine (termed CAR10.0), aza-propargylglycine (CAR10.1), aza-phenylalanine (CAR10.2), and aza-allylglycine (CAR10.3). RESULTS: In human myometrial cells (h-TERT-C3) CAR10.0 and CAR10.1, but neither CAR10.2 nor CAR10.3 inhibited PGF2a-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation; whereas only CAR10.0 and CAR10.2 reduced expression of FP and oxytocin receptor, and inhibited PGF2a-elicited myometrial contraction; latter was consistent with their effects on Rho/ ROCK signaling. To determine if ex vivo properties of CAR10.0-10.3 are reproduced in vivo, we tested their efficacy in a model of LPS-induced preterm labor in mice. CAR10.0 and CAR10.2, but not CAR10.1 nor CAR10.3, prolonged gestation by ~28 h in mice treated with LPS, which induces preterm birth within 12 h of its administration. The CAR analogs did not seem to exhibit (gross) adverse effects on fetuses. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, a) the structure of the aza-side chain of the CAR analogs is critical for modulation of FP and inhibition of myometrial contraction; b) CAR10.0 and CAR10.2 provide the essential structural requirements as prototypes for drugs to effectively treat preterm labor.",

INTRODUCTION: Inflammation plays a dominant role in triggering preterm labor. Numerous inflammatory mediators increase accordingly during labor. Among them, the major pro-inflammatory mediator IL-1 is prominent. Three IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) antagonists are approved for clinical use (e.g., Kineret, Canakinumab and Rilonacept); however, all are large proteins, which act as orthosteric antagonists of IL-1, resulting in inhibition of all associated receptor functions, including immuno-vigilant properties. Alternatively, allosteric modulators of IL-1R would provide pharmacological selectivity and potentially reduce undesired effects. We previously designed small stable peptides based on primary structure of IL-1R, which in turn have the potential of antagonizing the receptor. An all D-amino acid heptapeptide (rytvela) was found to be selective and specifically bound to IL-1R, but was not displaced by Kineret. In IL-1R-containing HEK blue cells, rytvela inhibited IL-1-induced NF-kB activation, and prevented induction of IL-1, IL-8, MMP-1 and iNOS, but had no influence on Erk1/2 phosphorylation and expression of IL-6. Moreover, rytvela inhibited IL-1-induced ear inflammation in a murine model. Collectively, rytvela exhibited negative modulatory allosteric properties with accompanied pharmacologic selectivity.",

Also, myometrial contraction ex vivo and preterm labor mouse model in vivo were used to examine the efficacy of rytvela. RESULTS: We proceeded to examine the efficacy of rytvela in myometrial cells. IL-1-induced expression of CCL-1, VEGF, and IL-6 (but not IL-8) in human myometrial cells were all attenuated by rytvela. IL-1-induced increase in PGF2a-triggered myometrial contraction was attenuated by rytvela. Concordantly rytvela significantly prolonged normal gestation by ~15 h. Moreover, rytvela significantly diminished the rate of IL-1-induced preterm birth by prolonging gestation on average by ~24 h. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, as the first small IL-1R antagonist described to exhibit anti-inflammatory and tocolytic properties, rytvela offers unique promise as a therapeutic candidate to arrest preterm labor. INTRODUCTION: Proteomic analysis has identified differentially expressed proteins in the second and third trimesters associated with recurrent preterm birth. The purpose of this study was to identify cervicalvaginal fluid (CVF) proteins associated with recurrent preterm birth (RPTB) in the first trimester. METHODS: Multiparous women with singletons and history of PTB in all prior pregnancies were enrolled prospectively from 2008-2013 and had CVF collected at regular intervals during prenatal care. Cases (n=5) of women with spontaneous RPTB and first trimester CVF sample were compared with controls (n=5) of women who delivered at term with matching gestational age (GA) of first trimester sample. Proteomic analysis was performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy using established techniques. Proteins were identified by database peptide matching. Protein quantification was performed by spectral counting. Pair-wise comparisons used c 2 and a Z-transformation of average spectral counts. Significance was set at p < 0.01. RESULTS: Case and control groups were similar with regard to demographic measures as described in table. Average GA of sample collection was 12.0 and 11.8, mean GA at delivery was 34.7 and 38.2 weeks, and mean birthweight was 2945g and 3341g in cases and controls respectively. There were 64 candidates at a Z-score p-value of 0.01 or less. Estimated false discovery rate is 19% at that cutoff. High levels of semenogelin and prostatic acid phosphatase were over expressed in RPTB group, indicating possible semen contamination in one of the RPTB samples. Apolipoproteins A, B, and c were also identified in RPTB samples suggesting a small amount of blood contamination in the RPTB pool. Additional informative candidates identified included Heat shock protein 90, Glycodelin, and Coactosin among others. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to identify differentially expressed proteins in the first trimester of CVF from women with RPTB. These candidate biomarkers may serve as the basis for first trimester prediction of RPTB in high-risk patients. INTRODUCTION: Premature birth following preterm labour is a common and critical health issue in fetal-maternal medicine with long-term consequences especially for early preterm neonates. The pathophysiology is poorly understood and the causal factors uncertain, but inflammatory mechanisms are clearly implicated. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) which binds Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to activate inflammation and induce preterm delivery (PTD) in mice. This project seeks to investigate (1) whether inhibition of the TLR4 signalling pathway using small molecule inhibitors of TLR4 signalling may prevent the parturition cascade caused by LPS-induced inflammation and (2) the consequences of in utero exposure to TL4 inhibitors for the resulting progeny.",

Pregnant B6 females were treated with LPS or PBS, with or without coadministration of TLR4 inhibitor, on gestational day (GD) 16.5 and were either killed on GD18.5, or allowed to deliver pups. RESULTS: LPS-induced PTD was successfully alleviated using TLR4 inhibitors in B6 mice, preventing fetal loss associated with death in utero and/or early delivery, resulting in on-time birth with normal perinatal characteristics and survival rates in pups. TLR4 inhibitors did not reverse the reduced fetal weight evident in late gestation after LPS administration. However progeny born after exposure to TLR4 inhibitor in late gestation, with or without concurrent LPS administration, showed no substantial adverse effects on growth trajectory (from birth to 20 weeks), body morphometry or health in adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that TLR4 is required for the precocious activation of the inflammatory response induced by bacterial LPS and implicates TLR4 as a key trigger for infection-associated preterm labour. Early intervention with TLR4 inhibitors can inhibit progression of the LPS-induced inflammatory cascade and prevent preterm birth without adverse perinatal or postnatal consequences in mice. The TLR pathway warrants further investigation as a potential target for new prevention or treatment options in women with infection-associated, threatened PTD. The timing and progression of normal term labour is associated with the onset of an inflammation-like response in the gestational tissues. The nature of the initiating events in term labour, and how these relate to the pathophysiological inflammatory events of preterm labour, is poorly understood. TLR4 is a receptor for several endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from the fetus and/or gestational tissues in late gestation. In this study we investigated the physiological role for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in normal term delivery. METHODS: Mice with a null mutation in the Tlr4 gene (Tlr4-/-mice) and wild-type Balb/c controls were mated with wild-type males and gestation length, duration of labor, and perinatal parameters were recorded. Expression of several inflammatory pathway genes was quantified by qPCR in gestational tissues recovered at day 17.5 in a second cohort of mice. In additional experiments, wild-type mice were administered small TLR4 antagonist or PBS control on gestational day (GD) 16.5-17.5 and the effect on perinatal parameters were recorded. All groups were 8-12 mice. Effects of treatments were considered significant when P<0.05. RESULTS: The time of normal term parturition was delayed by 12 h in <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Tlr4-/-mice compared with wild-type controls. Expression of genes encoding several proinflammatory cytokines and mediators including IL1A, IFNG and COX2 were reduced in the uterus, placenta and fetus of the <em style=\"msobidi-font-style: normal;\">Tlr4-/-mice, compared to wildtype Balb/c mice. Administration of TLR4 antagonist to wild-type mice in late gestation caused a 20 h delay in the time of pup delivery at term, but no adverse effects on pup weight or survival were seen. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply a critical role for TLR4 in initiation or progression of the events of parturition and delivery. DAMPs released from fetal, placental or uterine tissues in late gestation (such as known TLR4 ligands surfactant proteins, hyaluronan or high mobility group protein B1) may have a role in initiating the events of parturition through ligation with TLR4 or other Toll-like receptors. Since TLR4 is also implicated in infection-associated preterm labour, there may be substantial overlap may between the mechanistic pathways responsible for both term and preterm labour.",

Kristy Palomares, Joaquin Santolaya-Forgas, Lissa Francois, David Blitzer, Nicole Dalaya, Jacobo L Santolaya, Ashwin Jadhav, Paul Matta, William MacMillan. Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, USA. INTRODUCTION: Gaining insights into the normal and abnormal adaptation of the myometrium early in pregnancy could have potential for prediction of patients at risk for preterm delivery. Sonographic imaging allows for in vivo assessments of this adaptation. In this study we sought to analyze if the changes in uterine volume between 11-14 weeks gestation in Singleton and di-chorionic Twin pregnancies. METHODS: This was a nested controlled study performed in patients that were followed thought-out pregnancy and delivered at our Center. Pregnancies ending in stillbirth or a newborn with congenital anomalies were excluded. The uterine volume was calculated from the 3 largest sagittal, coronal and transverse diameters of the uterus measured by transabdominal sonography. Correlation between uterine volume and GA at delivery were determined and comparisons between Singletons and Twin pregnancies made using a parametric test and difference in the proportion test. RESULTS: At 11 weeks the mean uterine volume for Singletons was 357 cm3 and for Twins 652 cm3 (p<0.05). At 14 weeks the mean uterine volume in Singletons was 698 cm3 and in Twins 1026 cm3 (p<0.05). In twin pregnancies a significant trend was noted between the uterine volume (cm 3 ) / mean CRL (mm) ratio and the gestational at delivery. A summary of the patients demographics is shown in Table 1 .parameters examined were volume fraction and mean volume per smooth muscle cell of mitochondria in human term myometrium. A standard section is shown in fi gure 1.White arrows indicate mitochondria. RESULTS: The maternal ages ranged from 18-45 years. Comparison of the parameters were performed for women above and below the mean age of 32.7\u00b16.2 years (mean\u00b1SD, n=30). We found that the mean (\u00b1SD) volume fraction of mitochondria was 0.019\u00b10.015 and the mean volume per cell was 262\u00b1234 \u00b5m 3 . In the younger group (n=14) mitochondrial volume fraction and volume per cell were 0.023\u00b10.019 and 372\u00b1299 \u00b5m 3 respectively whereas in older group (n=16) these were 0.014\u00b10.009 and 166\u00b185 \u00b5m 3 . The difference in mitochondrial volume per cell was signifi cant (P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: These fi ndings outline a clear decrease in mitochondrial volume per cell in the pregnant myometrium of older mothers. This may explain, in part, the clinical problems related to advanced maternal age. The ultrastructure of human pregnant myometrium is not well defi ned in the literature. Dense plaques are aggregates of protein under the cell membrane upon which actin fi laments insert allowing transduction of force to the membrane. The aim of this study was to describe the surface to volume ratio and surface area of human term myometrial smooth muscle cells and the proportion of this area associated with dense plaques. The secondary aim was to study these values in association with maternal age. METHODS: Myometrial biopsies were collected from 30 women undergoing elective caesarean delivery with informed consent and institutional ethical approval. The range of maternal ages was 18-45 years, the mean age (\u00b1SD) was 32.7\u00b16.2 years. These were imaged with a transmission electron microscope and analysed using stereological methods.

Lynne Sykes, 1 Kacie R Thomson, 1 TG Teoh, 2 Phillip R Bennett. 1 1 IRDB, Imperial College London, London, UK, United Kingdom; 2 Obstetrics and Gynaecology, St Mary's Hospital, London, UK, United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION: NF-kB controls the expression of labour associated and inflammatory response genes and is activated in amnion and myometrium in labour. Since the majority of cases of early preterm labour are associated with infection/infl ammation which places the fetal CNS at risk, targeting immune activation is an attractive therapeutic strategy for its prevention. Although we have shown that cyclopentenone prostaglandins inhibit NF-kB in vitro and in a murine model, these compounds have not been used as drugs. We have therefore explored alternate potential compounds. Sulfasalazine (SASP) has been shown to inhibit NF-kB and reduce pro-infl ammatory cytokine concentrations in studies of fetal membrane explants. We examined the effect of SASP on the transcription factors NF-kB and AP1 in cultured amniocytes and myocytes and its effect on IL-1b induced pro-infl ammatory cytokine synthesis. METHODS: Amnion and myometrium were collected from women at term undergoing pre-labour elective caesarean section. Cells were cultured until confl uent and treated with SASP or medium vehicle control, with or without IL-1b stimulation. NF-kB and AP1 activity was measured by western analysis of p-p65 and p-c-jun respectively. mRNA expression of the pro-infl ammatory cytokines was determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: SASP (5mM) inhibited IL-1b induced NF-kB in amniocytes (p< 0.0001), but caused a rapid short lived activation of AP-1 (p<0.01). SASP also inhibited IL-1b induced production of IL-6, IL-8 (p<0.0001) and TNF-a (p<0.001) in amniocytes. However, it caused a rapid and transient increase in basal IL-6 (p<0.01), IL-8 and TNF-a (p<0.05) production. SASP also inhibited IL-1b induced NF-kB activity in myocytes (P<0.01), but had no significant effect on AP-1. At longer timepoints SASP was notably cytotoxic to myocytes as determined by the morphology of the cells and trypan blue test. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, it is unlikely that SASP could be used for the prevention of inflammation induced preterm labour, since the concentration required to inhibit NF-kB also activates AP-1, increases cytokine production, and has cytotoxic effects.",

            "text": "The events of parturition at term and preterm are similar to those of an inflammatory response. Local uterine and fetal membrane chemotactic factors are released prior to delivery that activates peripheral leukocytes causing them to extravasate into uterine tissues where they stimulate labor processes. Previously we demonstrated that uterine tissue homogenates contained increasing chemotactic activity as gestation progressed from term not in labor (TNL) to term in labor (TL). However, the issue of whether leukocyte responsiveness changes as pregnancy progresses was not addressed. We hypothesized that leukocyte responsiveness to a term chemotactic signal increases as gestation progresses toward the onset of labor at term and preterm. METHODS: Proteins were isolated from fetal membranes collected from patients who delivered spontaneously at term. Blood was drawn by venipuncture from 4 different groups of patients; TL, TNL, threatened preterm labor (contraction alone (TPTL) or with fluid leakage (TPTLL)) and preterm not in labor (PTNL), and leukocytes isolated. Leukocytes and chemotactic extracts were placed into their respective sides of a Boyden chamber. Migrated leukocytes were quantitated using flow cytometry. The expressions of chemokine receptor mRNA abundance (CXCR1, 2, 3, CCR1, 2, 5) in leukocytes were assessed using quantitative RT-PCR. ANOVA and Student's t-test assessed significance. RESULTS: Leukocyte responsiveness increased to term chemotactic signals as labor progressed (TL vs. TNL plus PTNL, p<0.0001). Subanalysis revealed spontaneous TL leukocytes migrated more than leukocytes from induction of labor with oxytocin (p<0.05). TPTL leukocytes migrated more than PTNL leukocytes (p<0.05). Moreover, TPTLL migrated more than TPTL (p<0.02). However, chemokine receptors expression did not change in any group. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that human peripheral leukocytes increase their responsiveness to term chemotactic signals as labor progresses. This approach can be used to establish a preterm labor prediction test indicating who to treat to reduce the risk for preterm delivery. Additionally, this approach may identify risk for preterm labor in asymptomatic patients. The lack of change in leukocyte chemokine receptor expression suggests the intriguing possibility of a different type of chemoattractant.

Epidemiological studies have identified associations between maternal DEHP exposure and increased risk for preterm birth; however, the biological mechanisms underlying these relationships are unclear. Because cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) dependent prostaglandin (PG) synthesis is integral to the initiation of parturition, we evaluated the effects of mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), the active metabolite of DEHP, on prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) synthesis and COX-2 expression in primary human placental macrophages (PM) and a human macrophage-like cell line, THP-1. METHODS: PM were isolated from placental tissue collected from normal, cesarean section deliveries at the University of Michigan Hospital. Human THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophage-like cells by culturing with phorbol myristate acetate for 24 h. Cultures were treated for 2, 4, 8, or 24 h with MEHP concentrations ranging from 10-180 \u00b5M. PGE 2 concentrations were assessed in culture medium using ELISA, and COX-1 and COX-2 expression was determined by western blot analysis. RESULTS: Treatment of PM with 180 \u00b5M MEHP for 24 h significantly increased PGE 2 synthesis by 1.7-fold. This was reproducible when THP-1 cells were used to model PM behavior. Co-treatment of PM and THP-1 cells with the COX-2 selective inhibitor NS-398 resulted in a significant decrease in PGE 2 synthesis of 70% and 57% respectively, compared with MEHP alone, suggesting that MEHP-stimulated PGE 2 synthesis is dependent on increased COX-2 expression. Co-treatment of PMs with the non-selective COX inhibitor indomethacin reduced MEHP-stimulated PGE 2 synthesis by 77%, compared to MEHP alone, confirming COXdependence. Western blot densitometric analysis revealed a significant increase in COX-2 expression of 2-fold in THP-1 cells treated with 180 mM MEHP and no significant changes in COX-1 expression, supporting the role of COX-2 in MEHP-stimulated PGE 2 synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study newly demonstrate phthalate-stimulated PGE 2 synthesis in human placental macrophages and warrant future studies into COX-2-dependent PG synthesis as a mechanism of toxicant-associated preterm birth. This work was funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (P42 ES017198). METHODS: Thirty day old C57BL/6 mice were fed normal and vit D deficient diet for 6 wks and vit D levels were measured by RIA. Mice were pair mated and presence of sperm plug was designated as D1 pregnancy. Mice (n=3) from each group were administered LPS (400 ug/kg body wt) on D15 of pregnancy and sacrificed 6h later. Myometrial rings isolated were placed in organ baths containing 5.0 ml Krebs solution bubbled with 95% O2-5%CO2 at 37\u00b0C. A resting force of 1.25 g was placed on each strip, and the tissues were allowed to equilibrate for 1 h. Mean force developed per unit time by the strips was determined by measuring the area under the contraction curves in the absence and presence of vit D (10,100 and 1000nM). In 2 nd experiment continuous infusion pumps either with saline or vit D (.25ug/kg body.wt/day/14d) were placed s.c in normal (n=5) and VDD (n=5) mice on D8 and LPS was administered i.p on D17of pregnancy. RESULTS: VDD mice had significantly lower levels of vit D (0.9\u00b10.5ng/ ml) compared to normal mice (6.9\u00b11.5ng/ml). Basal relaxation in myometrium obtained from VDD mice is significantly (P<.05) lesser (18%) than in control mice (26%). In the LPS treated VDD mice, vit D (100nM) caused 36% relaxation which is significantly higher compared to18% in untreated. In normal mice treated with LPS, vit D (100nM) caused 27% relaxation compared to 26% in untreated. Pregnant mice delivered at 18\u00b12h after LPS administration in normal groups with or without vit D pumps and VDD control group. In VDD mice with vit D pumps there was a significant delay (44.2\u00b17.8h; P<.05) in delivery after LPS administration.",

            "text": "Our results suggest that vit D can prevent LPS induced myometrial contractility and delivery in vit D deficient mice and therefore could be a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent infection induced preterm birth. Our earlier studies have reported that rats exposed to Benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] an environmental toxin exhibit preterm birth. Epigenetic chromatin modification enzymes PCR array revealed both upregulation and down regulation of various histone deacetylases(HDACs). Objective: Since downregulation of HDACs are reported to enhance the expression of NFkB, we assessed the expression of HDACs and their consequent effects on cytokines and contractile associated factors in uterine myometrium of pregnant Long Evan rats exposed to B(a)P versus vehicle treated controls. METHODS: Timed pregnant Long Evan rats were gavaged 150, 300 and 600ug B(a)P from D14 to D17 of pregnancy and euthanized after delivery. Myometrium isolated was stored at -70\u00b0C until analysis. cDNA prepared from myometrium was subjected to real time PCR analysis using specific primers to IL-1 b, IL-6, IL-8,TNF a, receptor activator of NFkB (RANK), prostaglandin F2 a( FP) receptor and Connexin-43. Western analysis was performed using antibodies for HDACs, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, Connexin-43, Cox2, pIKBa and IKBa. Data was analyzed using one way ANOVA. RESULTS: Western analysis of lysates obtained from myometrium of B(a)P treated rats showed a significant (P<0.05) decrease in HDAC 1, 3 and 4. HDAC2 and 6 expression did not differ between treatments. Real time PCR analysis showed a significant increase in mRNA expression of IL-1 b, IL-6, IL-8,TNF a, RANK , FP receptor and Connexin-43 (p<.05) in myometrium of rats exposed to B(a)P vs. control. Western analysis showed an increase (P<0.05) in Cox2 expression. The increase in RANK mRNA expression was further complemented by the increase and decrease (P<0.05) in the expression of pIKBa and IKBa respectively which are the key regulators of NFkB pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: This data suggests that exposure of rats to B(a)P, an environmental toxin, downregulates HDAC proteins. B(a)P treatment increases pro inflammatory cytokines, NFkB pathway proteins and contractile proteins probably via down regulation of Histone deacetylases. Further research is needed to assess the role of HDAC inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy to prevent inflammation induced preterm birth. Funding: RCMI 5G12 RR003032-27. The molecular mechanisms involved in human uterine quiescence during gestation and induction of labor at term or preterm are not completely known. Preterm delivery is associated with major morbidity and mortality and current efforts to prevent delivery until term are largely ineffective. Identification and semi-quantification of proteomic changes during pregnancy will allow for targeted research into how quiescence is maintained and what changes are associated with induction of labor.",

Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, UT Health University of Texas Medical School at Houston, Houston, TX, USA. INTRODUCTION: Rising primary cesarean delivery (CD) rates contribute to adverse outcomes in future pregnancies. Data reveal increased CD rates in private provider groups compared to academic practice. Our objective is to determine the provider groups within our institution contributing the highest to CD rates and identify the obstetric populations where interventions can potentially occur. METHODS: Retrospective review of CD rates from 2008 to 2013 at a tertiary care facility stratifi ed by the 10category Robson Classifi cation System (RCS) and provider group practices. The RCS examines CD among mutually exclusive obstetrical groups providing a mechanism of audit and feedback. CD rates among vertex, singleton, term \u2265 37 wks, nulliparous gestations (VSTN) and variations among academic versus nonacademic provider groups were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 10301 CD (40.6%) among 25374 deliveries during the study period. The largest contributing categories for CD were prior CD (n=3615, 35%) and VSTN (n=2996, 29%). Signifi cant variations in CD rates among providers occurred in RCS Category 1 (VSTN, spontaneous labor) and RCS Category 2 (VSTN, induced labor).The total CD rate was higher in nonacademic vs academic provider groups (42.7% vs 37%, p<0.001). CD rates in RCS Category 1 (36.7% vs 23%, p<0.001) and RCS Category 2 (40.5% vs 32.7%, p<0001) were also higher in nonacademic provider groups. In RCS Category 5 (singleton, vertex, term \u2265 37 weeks, prior CD), the CD rate among provider groups was similar (range: 87% to 98%). CONCLUSIONS: We found that fi rst and repeat CD accounted for 64% of all CD. Signifi cant differences in primary CD rates in VSTN among provider groups were reported, with two of the nonacademic provider groups having rates over 50%. However, overall repeat CD rates were similar among all groups. Since repeat CD rates depend on the fi rst CD, initial efforts should focus on provider groups diverging from accepted primary CD rates to decrease downstream effects. Umbilical cord cortisol concentrations are a known marker of perinatal stress and have been correlated to factors such as mode of delivery, neonatal sex and delivery analgesics. Stress responses in neonates born to pregnant adolescents have been less well characterized in spite of increased risk of adverse birth outcomes. The aim of this analysis was to identify maternal and fetal determinants of cord cortisol concentrations in a racially diverse group of pregnant adolescents. METHODS: A total of 171 pregnant teens (ages 13-18y) entering prenatal care at 12-30 wks of gestation were enrolled in a larger study of maternal / fetal bone outcomes. Cord cortisol measures were available for a subset of this cohort (n=48). Of these teens, 62.5% were African American, 37.5% were Caucasian, and 27.1% were Hispanic. At up to 3 study visit across gestation, maternal anthropometrics and fetal biometry measures were obtained. Infl ammatory markers (IL-10, IL-6, CRP, TNFa) were assessed in maternal serum at mid-gestation and maternal and cord serum at delivery. Neonatal characteristics were collected at birth. Wilcoxon rank sums and regression were used to assess group differences and statistical determinants of cord cortisol at delivery. RESULTS: Most (n=45, 93.8%) teens delivered vaginally while one teen underwent assisted vaginal delivery and 2 delivered via c-section. All infants but one (gestational age of 35.1 wks) were born full term (\u203a37 wks gestation). The mean cord cortisol concentration was 11.2 \u00b1 6.7 mg/dL (range 3.8 -27.1 mg/dL, n=48). Cord cortisol was positively associated with infant birth weight (R 2 =0.11, p\u20390.03) and birth length (R 2 =0.10, p\u20390.04) but not maternal race or ethnicity, fetal sex, maternal prepregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain, labor analgesics, labor duration, placental weight, or infl ammatory markers. Cord cortisol was negatively associated with APGAR scores at one minute following delivery (R 2 =0.13, p\u20390.02). When fetal size was assessed relative to gestational age, smallfor-gestational age babies (n=5) had signifi cantly lower cord cortisol compared to average size (n=40, p\u20390.02) and large-for-gestational age infants (n=3, p\u20390.04). Infl ammatory markers did not differ when assessed by average, small and large for gestational age infants. CONCLUSIONS: Infant birth size had a signifi cant positive effect on cord cortisol concentrations at delivery in pregnant teens.",

Delivery times and fetal weights were obtained following birth. Cervical collagen cross-links were assessed daily in vivo by collagen light-induced fluorescence (LIF) and cervical extensibility (gestation day 20) and uterine contractility was measured in vitro. Plasma progesterone (P4) measurements (day 20) were done by chemiluminescence immunoassay. Cytokines were analyzed with ELISA. RESULTS: Delivery is significantly (P=0.002) longer after high dose nicotine treatments (mean \u00b1 SEM hours after 8 a.m. on day 22 of gestation = controls 15.8 \u00b1 6.1 vs. nicotine 1 mg: 28.4 \u00b1 4.7; 2 mg: 31.4 \u00b1 5.3). Nicotine does not affect (P>0.05) the plasma levels (ng/ml) of P4 in control vs nicotine treated animals (controls =85.4 \u00b1 7.2 vs nicotine= 87.6 \u00b1 6.4). There are no significant (P>0.05) changes in pup weights (controls= 5.49 \u00b1 0.29 vs 1'mg nicotine = 5.66 \u00b1 0.23, gm \u00b1 SEM) and placenta weights (controls 0.39 \u00b1 0.02 vs 1 mg nicotine +0.44 \u00b1 0.03). Cervical LIF and extensibility progressively decrease throughout pregnancy in control rats. Nicotine-treated rats at days 16-20 of gestation show significantly (P<0.001) greater cervical resistance and higher LIF (P<0.001) compared with the control rats (LIF mean photons at day 20 \u00b1 SEM; controls= 1941 \u00b1 55 vs nicotine = 2108 \u00b1 39). Nicotine had little effect (P>0.05) on uterine contractility in dose/response studies. Serum cytokine analysis reveals a decrease in inflammatory response in nicotine-treated rats. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine exposure during pregnancy inhibits cervical ripening without suppression of uterine contractility and thus prolongs gestation without deleterious effects on fetuses. Nicotine possibly acts on the cervix by suppression of a cholinergic anti-inflammatory response to delay delivery. This inflammatory pathway may provide a new target for control of the cervix.",

METHODS: Live GR-1 bacteria (10 9 cfu, n=6) or saline (n=6) was given to pregnant CD-1 mice daily from gestational day (GD) 9 to 15 by oral gavage. On GD 16, DNA was extracted from vaginal and cecal tissues and bacterial DNA was amplified by PCR. The V6 region of 16S rRNA gene was sequenced (Ion Torrent). T test was used for comparisons between saline and GR-1 treated mice. q-values <0.1 (false discovery rate adjusted) were considered significant. RESULTS: We detected 65 and 43 bacterial families in the vagina and cecum of saline mice respectively. The most abundant families were Bacillaceae (12.0% of total bacteria), Streptococcaceae (5.7%) and Porphyromonadaceae (5.6%) in the vagina, and Porphyromononadaceae (28%), Lachnospiraceae (21%) and Bacteroidaceae (10%) in the cecum.

Jinying Yang, 1,2,3 Shao-Qing Shi, 1,3 Leili Shi, 3 Huishu Liu, 1,2,3 Dajun Fang, 1,2,3 Robert E Garfield. INTRODUCTION: Treatment with synthetic progestins during pregnancy often leads to masculinization of female fetuses or feminization of male fetuses. TMG is a potent progestin (6 X greater than progesterone) that might be used to treat preterm birth as it effectively inhibits preterm birth in animal models. However, the effect of TMG on fetuses is unknown. We examined if TMG would affect the viability of fetuses and alter the sex and fertility of the offspring of pregnant rats treated with TMG. METHODS: Timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 7/group) were treated with vehicle (benzyl benzoate/caster oil, controls) or TMG (Taizhou Jiakan Chemical Co. Ltd. Zheijiang, China; 1 mg/day s.c.). TMG was tested for purity by Evestra (San Antonio, Texas). TMG-treated pregnant rats were sacrificed on day 22 of gestation, because they do not deliver spontaneously, and the pups (PTMG) were removed from the uterus and placed with surrogate control rats that delivered pups the same day and the normal pups were sacrificed. Thereafter the PTMG were raised by the surrogate rats and sexed and separated after 21 days.To determine if TMG affects breeding and fertility mature female PTMG (MTMG, n=5) at 5 months age were randomly selected and placed with non litter mate MTMG males for 6 days. Pregnant normal control rats were also bred and both MTMG offspring and controls were allowed to deliver fetuses and the pups were weighed. RESULTS: Control rats delivered viable pups on day 22 of gestation (113 pups/7 rats). Similarly PTMG (108 pups/7 rats) were all viable. After 21 days PTMG demonstrated no significant difference (P>0.05) in the sex ratio of male to female pups (53/60) compared to control pups (51/57). All MTMG females became pregnant following breeding with nonlitter mate MTMG males. Similarly male and female MTMG bred with normal control rats delivered viable fetuses. There was no significant differences between the MTMG bred and the control groups for pup weight (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: TMG is a very potent progestin that inhibits birth but does not affect fetal viability, fetal sexual characteristics or function and fertility of mature offspring. TMG may be very useful for treatment of preterm birth.",

INTRODUCTION: As a critical gatekeeper for birth, prepartum remodeling of the cervix is associated with infiltration by macrophages (Mj), increased proinflammatory mediators, and extracellular matrix degradation. Of the significantly up-or down-expressed genes, this study compared the cervix from prepartum (day 21 postbreeding) and nonpregnant (NP) rats, with or without Mj, to determine if there is 1) differential-regulation of Mj-related molecules in common to both groups, and 2) a prepartum Mj phenotype reflected by functional and canonical pathway analyses. METHODS: Dispersed cervix from term D21 and NP rats were either flash frozen or processed to remove Mj (n=3 rats/group). RNA extraction from June of 2012 to September of 2013. EKGs were performed prior to initiation of therapy for all subjects. EKGs were repeated in the third trimester for those on MTD maintenance. The QTc interval was calculated using Bazett's formula. Data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Twosample t-test and paired t-test were calculated. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Fifty nine pregnant women were initiated on OMT. Thirty seven women were initiated on MTD while 22 were initiated on BPN. One patient was transitioned from BPN to MTD and thus was included in the analysis of MTD subjects. The mean QTc interval prior to initiation of therapy was 431.0 ms. The dose of MTD late in pregnancy ranged from 50 mg to 135 mg. The mean QTc interval in late pregnancy for those on MTD maintenance was 441.0 ms and it was not statistically different from prior to initiation of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be no significant change in QTc intervals from prior to initiation of OMT when the women are using illicit drugs compared to late in pregnancy while on MTD maintenance therapy. Furthermore, the QTc interval at late pregnancy of women on MTD does not seem to differ from those not on MTD as compared to a previously published study of QTc interval in pregnancy. Observational studies indicate that trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) is safe, with a relative low risk for maternal-fetal complications. The aim of this study was to compare maternal-neonatal outcomes between nulliparae and women with a previous CD in spontaneous labor.",

            "text": "We studied a retrospective cohort of 1450 patients who underwent a low-transverse cesarean section from May to November of 2011 at a tertiary care women's hospital. Maternal infectious morbidity was defined as a postoperative fever (temperature greater than 101.3), endometritis, UTI, pyelonephritis, postpartum administration of antibiotics or a wound complication such as seroma, hematoma, cellulitis or need for wound exploration. The postoperative period was defined as the time from cesarean section to the postpartum visit. All patients received preoperative antibiotics and had a low transverse cesarean section. Risk factors significantly associated with maternal infectious morbidity in bivariate analysis were used in the multivariate logistic regression model. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 1450 patients, 154 (10.6%) had a postoperative course complicated by a maternal infectious morbidity. In multivariate analysis, chorioamnionitis (OR 6.20; 95% CI 2.76-13.92), having the cesarean section performed by the resident teaching service (2.59; 1.67-4.03), and an operative time of greater than one hour (1.54; 1.01-2.34) were significantly associated with postoperative maternal infectious morbidity after adjusting for maternal medical comorbidities, previous cesarean sections, race, BMI and insurance status. CONCLUSIONS: Chorioamnionitis, an operative time greater than one hour and having the cesarean section performed by the resident teaching service are associated with an increase in maternal infectious morbidity following cesarean section. INTRODUCTION: Folate has been associated with a reduced risk of hypertension in non-pregnant patients and yet evidence relating folate to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HTD) has been conflicting. Our objective was to evaluate the independent association between maternal folate status at <16 weeks gestation and blood pressure across pregnancy. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective, observational cohort of 309 women with singleton gestations. Total serum folate was assayed by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry at <16 weeks. Blood pressure was recorded at each prenatal visit until delivery. Total folate was categorized into tertiles and mean systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure was aggregated into gestational age epochs (<16 weeks, 16-29.9 weeks, 30-36.9 weeks, and \u2265 37 weeks). ANOVA and logistic regression analysis were used as appropriate. RESULTS: The median gestational age at enrollment was 9.2 weeks (IQR:7.5 -11.3). None of the women were folate deficient (serum total folate concentration <3 ng/mL). There were no significant differences between the mean systolic, mean diastolic, or mean arterial blood pressures across folate tertiles in any gestational age epoch, p>0.05 for all. There were 33 cases (10.7%) of HTD (gestational hypertension n=29, or preeclampsia n=4) in this cohort. There were no significant differences in total folate concentrations between those with or without HTD (total folate:27.96 vs. 27.08, p>0.05). ",

Simona Cardaropoli, 1,2 Domenica Giuffrida, 2 Alessandro Rolfo, 2 Annalisa Piazzese, 2 Tullia Todros. INTRODUCTION: Admission of women in latent phase of labor is associated with higher cesarean section rates. Uterine electromyography (EMG) has been shown to predict delivery at term and preterm more accurately than other methods used in the clinic. The objective of our study was to determine whether uterine EMG differs between term patients in active vs. latent phase of labor. METHODS: EMG was recorded from the abdominal surface for 30 minutes in 28 patients: 7 in latent phase and 21 in active phase of labor at > 37 weeks of gestation. Latent phase was defined by contractions detected on tocodynamometry (TOCO) and no cervical change within at least four hours. Peak power frequency in \"bursts\" of uterine EMG activity and total power in bursts were compared in the active vs. latent labor group using the Student's T test (p\u22640.05 significant). RESULTS: Peak power frequency in bursts was significantly higher (P=0.05) in active labor (1.39e-010 \u00b1 2.65e-010 Hz) compared with latent labor (3.58e-011 \u00b1 4,38e-011 Hz). Similarly, total power in bursts was significantly higher (P=0.04) in active labor (1.01e-09 \u00b1 1.81e-09 V 2 ) compared with latent labor (2.61e-010 \u00b1 2.78e-010 V 2 ). CONCLUSIONS: Peak power frequency in uterine EMG bursts and total power in bursts are higher during active phase of labor compared to latent phase. Uterine EMG can identify myometrial activation characteristic of active labor and allow clinicians not to admit womenin latent phase labor regardless of the presence of contractions on TOCO.",

This may be explained by nuances in practice patterns or treatment of DM in pregnancy. INTRODUCTION: ACOG recommends planned preterm cesarean hysterectomy (CH) for women with placenta accreta. This precludes future fertility. We tested whether CH can be avoided without increasing maternal morbidity rates when intra-operative decision for CH is made post-hysterotomy (\"delayed\") versus pre-hysterotomy (\"early\"). METHODS: Secondary analysis of a cohort of women with ultrasonographic (US) signs of accreta. Patients were consented for CH, but CH decisions were based on clinical parameters , such as size and complexity of vascularity visible on the exterior anterior uterine wall at the time of surgery. The primary outcome was rate of CH when the decision was made post-hysterotomy (\"delayed\"). RESULTS: 99 women had suspected accreta (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) . Prehysterotomy \"early\" decision for CH was made among 26.3% women. \"Delayed\" decision was made for 73.7% women; among these 74% avoided CH. There were no differences in maternal demographics or obstetric characteristics between the \"early\" and \"delayed\" CH groups (table 1) . Patients undergoing CH had more blood transfusion, regardless of the timing of the decision. CONCLUSIONS: Decision for CH among women with suspected accreta who wish to retain fertility could be postponed until after delivery, and based on clinical parameters at the time of hysterotomy. ",

The expression and localization of PSGs in the placenta in FGR was assessed using RT-PCR and ISH. Putative PSGs were measured in maternal blood at 28 weeks gestation in women with preterm FGR (n=20, birthweight <5 th centile, delivery <34 weeks) and women who developed term FGR (bwt <5 th centile, delivery >37 weeks). Term FGR was studied in 2 stages: 1) 100 low risk women recruited at 28 weeks underwent serial ultrasound and maternal blood sampling and the expression of PSGs in those with term FGR (n=12) was studied across gestation 2) A large prospective study of 600 women compared PSG expression in maternal blood at 28 weeks in women who developed term FGR (n=40) Active management of the third stage (oxytocin, quick cord clamping, controlled cord traction) scored 39%, whereas oxytocin was given in 89% of the cases. For women with >500 ml blood loss, low scores were seen for monitoring vital parameters (14%) and taking blood samples (25%). In managing atony, uterus massage was performed in 33%, bladder catheterization in 58% and uterotonics given in 53%. For women with >1000 ml blood loss, measurement showed very low adherence in oxygen supply (9%) and ordering blood units (11%). The gynecologist was summoned in only 43% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed poor adherence to the quality indicators, clearly indicating an implementation problem of the evidence based PPH guideline and skills courses in The Netherlands. The additional video observations proved valuable as it gives a precise and accurate illustration of the factors that affect the quality of PPH-care. With these results a tailor made implementation strategy can be developped with the aim to improve quality of PPH-care.

Adverse MO effects on offspring metabolic outcomes are well documented but reproductive consequences are poorly understood. We investigated effects of MO during pregnancy and lactation on testicular and sperm oxidative stress and impact on male fertility. METHODS: Controls (C) ate normal chow (5%-fat) while MO female rats ate a high fat diet (25%-fat) from weaning through pregnancy and lactation. After weaning all rats ate C diet. We determined serum testosterone, malonaldialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity on testicular and sperm function at postnatal days (PND) 110, 450 and 650. RESULTS: At all ages testosterone was lower in the MO offspring group. At PND 450 and 650 testicular MDA concentration was higher in MO, ROS was elevated at all ages.

At PND 450 and 650, MO offspring sperm showed higher MDA and lower SOD and GPx activity with reduced sperm concentration, viability and motility.

Cleaved Srebp2 acts as a transcription factor for genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake from the blood. We hypothesized that IUGR combined with a maternal HFD would adversely program the miR-96 -Insig2 -Srebp2 pathway and increase hepatic cholesterol in neonatal and juvenile rats. METHODS: Female rats were fed either a regular diet or a HFD prior to mating through gestation and weaning. IUGR was induced by uterine artery ligation at E19. Offspring were killed at birth or postnatal day 21. This produced four offspring groups per sex: control, IUGR, HFD, and IUGR-HFD. Hepatic miR-96, Insig2 and Srebp2 protein were quantified using real time RTPCR and Western blot. Hepatic lipids were measured with a colorimetric kit. RESULTS: Compared to sex-matched control, IUGR, and HFD groups, both neonatal and juvenile female IUGR-HFD rats had increased miR-96*, decreased Insig2 protein*, increased cleaved Srebp2 protein*, and increased hepatic cholesterol*. In male rats, IUGR-HFD did not affect levels of miR-96, Insig2, or hepatic cholesterol in either neonatal or juvenile rats, but increased cleaved Srebp2 protein* in juvenile rats. *p<0.05.",

We speculate that a sex-specific response to in utero nutrient stressors such as IUGR and mHFD may reflect a hepatic sex-specific microRNA stress response. The sex-specific in utero microRNA stress response is an ongoing focus of our group. Ectopic lipid deposition, including visceral obesity and hepatic steatosis, increases mortality in humans. The risk of developing ectopic lipid deposition is modulated by the in utero nutritional environment, such as with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or a maternal high fat diet (mHFD). In developed countries, IUGR and mHFD often occur together. However, little is known about how IUGR and mHFD combined program increased ectopic lipid deposition. Ectopic lipid deposition is in part regulated by hepatic Pparg2, a transcription factor for lipogenic genes Acetyl CoA Carboxylase (Acc) and Fatty Acid Synthease (Fasn). We hypothesized that IUGR and mHFD combined would increase hepatic protein levels of Pparg2, Acc, and Fasn, hepatic triglycerides (TG), and serum free fatty acids (FFA) at birth, and would be associated with increased visceral adiposity in early adulthood. METHODS: Female rats were fed either a regular diet or a HFD prior to mating through gestation and weaning, and adult offspring continued on the maternal diet. IUGR was induced by uterine artery ligation at E19. Offspring were killed at birth or day of life (DOL) 60. This produced four offspring groups per sex: control, IUGR, HFD, and IUGR-HFD. Hepatic protein levels of Pparg2, Acc, phosphorylated Acc, and Fasn were measured with Western blot, hepatic TG with a colorimetric kit, and serum FFA with mass-spectroscopy. Abdominal MRI images were analyzed with ImageJ software to quantify visceral adipose tissue (VAT). RESULTS: Compared to sex-matched control, IUGR, and HFD groups, neonatal male IUGR-HFD rats had increased nuclear* and cytosolic Pparg2*, Acc*, pAcc*, and Fasn*, hepatic TG*, and serum saturated FFA (oleic*, stearic*, lauric*, eladic*, palmitic*, and palmitiladic*). IUGR-HFD increased hepatic TG*, but did not alter protein levels of Pparg2, Acc, pAcc, and Fasn, or serum FFA in neonatal females. Young adult male IUGR-HFD rats had increased VAT*. *p<0.05. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that IUGR combined with mHFD increases lipogenic proteins and ectopic lipid deposition in male but not female rats. Pparg2 increases expression of lipogenic genes. However, Pparg2 agonists improve ectopic lipid deposition. We speculate that treatment of IUGR-HFD male rats with Pparg agonists will decrease lipogenic gene expression and ectopic lipid deposition.",

Although a number of biochemical cascades have been implicated, the downstream targets at the level of transcriptional regulation still remain unclear. STAT3 is strongly upregulated following peripheral and central trauma and is thus a possible candidate. The aim of our study is to investigate the regulation and functional role of STAT3 in neonatal HI brain injury. METHODS: HI was induced based on the Rice-Vannucci model, in p7 mice, using 60 min exposure to 8% Oxygen. We used cell-specific conditional knock-out mice (n=6) where STAT3 was deleted in neurons using Synapsin-driven Cre-recombinase in STAT3-flox mutant mice. Littermate controls were homozygous for STAT3-flox but negative for Cre-recombinase (n=5). Pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation via Jak-2 was achieved with WP1066 in C57/Bl6 mice (n=8) compared to DMSO (vehicle) -treated controls (n=8). The assessment of outcome was based on size of infarct (Nissl), extent of cell death (TUNEL density), microglial activation (alphaM&X levels) and astroglial activation (GFAP immunoreactivity). RESULTS: At immunohistochemical level, HI resulted in transient upregulation of phosphorylated STAT3 (Y705) in cortical, hippocampal and thalamic neurons, with a peak at 1-2 hours after 60 min insult. Compared to controls, neuron-specific deletion of STAT3 resulted in a significant reduction in infarct size (50-80%), cell death (80-90%), microglial activation (80% alphaM & 70% alphaX counts), and GFAP immunoreactivity (25%) in hippocampus, cortex, striatum, and thalamus following severe, 60 min insult. A more moderate effect was also observed in the subcortical white matter. Pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 activation following severe 60min HI insult resulted in significant reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation (70% in hippocampus and cortex, p<0.05) and also reduced brain damage in all regions (40%). CONCLUSIONS: Since Y705-phosphorylation plays an important role in STAT3 function, the use of direct kinase inhibitors could serve as a candidate target for therapeutic intervention in neonatal brain damage. After a median split of the group based on maternal insulin sensitivity, fetuses of insulin resistant mothers showed a slower response to auditory stimuli (283 \u00b1 79ms) compared to fetuses of insulin sensitive mothers (178 \u00b1 46ms, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The latency of fetal evoked brain activity changes during OGTT. Lower maternal insulin sensitivity is associated with slower fetal brain responses 60 minutes after glucose ingestion. These findings provide first evidence that maternal metabolism has a direct effect on fetal brain activity and suggest that central insulin resistance may be programmed during fetal development.",

Cardiac NGF gene expression was higher in the hearts of the IUGR fetuses compared to Controls at 90d gestation. ACE1 gene expression was lower in the IUGR fetuses at 140d gestation, however there was a delay in the rise of ACE2 gene expression at 90d gestation in the IUGR fetuses. There was no effect of IUGR on cardiac gene expression of adrenergic receptor beta 1,but interestingly adrenergic receptor alpha 2 was higher at 55d, 90d and 140d gestation in the IUGR group compared to Controls. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that NGF expression is higher in the heart of the IUGR fetus when sympathetic innervation occurs in the sheep fetus. This may be related to the changes in local angiotensin II expression (to be measured) and result in altered sympathetic innervation of the heart. These effects may be amplified by changes in cardiac expression of AR and underlie an increased vulnerability to cardiovascular disease. We have shown that exposure to maternal overnutrition and obesity in the periconceptional period (PCON) is associated with an increased risk of obesity and a decrease in insulin signalling molecules in the liver of the offspring during adolescence 1,2 . It is not clear whether changes in hepatic insulin signalling are programmed from before birth, or emerge in postnatal life. We hypothesised that PCON would result in decreased abundance of insulin signalling molecules in liver of the fetus and that administration of an insulin sensitising agent, rosiglitazone to the PCON group would ablate these effects. METHODS: Donor ewes were allocated to 1 of 4 groups: 100% metabolisable energy requirements (MER) from 4mos before until 6d after conception and administration of vehicle from 7d before to 7d after conception (C-V); 100% MER and administration of rosiglitazone (C-Rosi); ~180% MER and administration of vehicle (PCON-V); ~180% MER and administration of rosiglitazone (PCON-Rosi). Single embryos were transferred into recipient ewes at embryonic day 6-7. Post mortem was conducted at 141d of gestation (term, 150d) and liver samples collected for determination of the abundance of insulin signalling molecules using Western blot analysis. RESULTS: PCON resulted in decreased IRb and Akt2 abundance in the fetal liver independent of fetal sex and rosiglitazone treatment. The abundance of PI3K-p110b and PI3K-p85 was lower in liver of female fetuses in the PCON-V compared to the C-V group. There was also an increase in the ratio of PI3K-p85:p110b in the PCON-Rosi group compared to the C-Rosi group. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, there was evidence that PCON resulted in an early programming of a decrease in the abundance of key insulin signalling molecules in the fetal liver. Administration of rosiglitazone in the PCON group did not ablate the impact of PCON on the abundance of insulin signalling molecules within the fetal liver. TNF-a and IL-10 mRNA levels were found in the HI group compared with na\u00efve group. In both the contextual test and tone test of fear conditioning, reductions of freezing time were found in the 15min HI group compared with the na\u00efve group. Interestingly, there is no statistically significant deference between CS and HI groups in the inflammatory cytokines levels and in neurocognitive outcome. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that perinatal hypoxia leads to neuronal damage and inflammation and that these cellular changes are associated with long-term neurocognitive abnormalities in CD1 mice. It is hoped to use this mouse model to improve long term outcome after perinatal hypoxia.",

Early pregnancy may be a time of increased placental sensitivity to maternal insulin as insulin receptors are abundant on the syncytiotrophoblast in the first trimester, but are far fewer at term. Thus, we hypothesized that maternal insulin secretory capacity in early pregnancy would be positively associated with placental weight. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cohort of women (n=40) recruited prior to pregnancy. An intravenous glucose tolerance test was administered pregravid and in early (12-14 wk), and late (34-36 wk) pregnancy (Catalano AJOG 1999). Placentas were trimmed, drained of excess blood and weighed. Neonatal fat mass was measured using skinfolds and total body electrical conductivity. Correlations between placental weight at term and 1 st (0-5 min), 2 nd (5-60 min) phase, total insulin secretory capacity before and throughout pregnancy were calculated. RESULTS: Fifteen women developed gestational diabetes (GDM) during pregnancy. We found no difference in the following relationships between GDM and normal glucose tolerant women, thus they were grouped together for subsequent analysis. The 2 nd phase and total insulin secretory capacity prior to (2 nd phase: r=0.344, p=0.024; total: r=0.338, p=0.0262) and in early pregnancy (2 nd phase: r=0.559, p=0.0001; total: r=0.536, p=0.0003), were positively associated with placental weight at term. Insulin secretory response in late pregnancy was not associated with placental weight. First phase insulin response before or during pregnancy was not associated with placental weight. Although neonatal fat mass was strongly correlated with placental weight at term (r=0.449, p=0.0003), maternal insulin secretory response was not related to neonatal fat mass at birth. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal insulin secretory response prior to and in early pregnancy was strongly related to placental weight at birth. Thus, in early pregnancy increased maternal insulin response as seen in obesity and GDM, may be a key influence on placental growth, possibly due to the enhanced presence of insulin receptors on the placental villi early in gestation. Furthermore, these data suggest that fetal adiposity is independent of maternal insulin concentrations per se but rather a function of increased maternal insulin resistance and subsequent nutrient availability for placental transfer.

Alexander Raw, Marcia Gallaher, Robert W Powers.Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Depression is a major health issue, with a twelve month incidence around 8% and a lifetime prevalence of approximately 18%. Women are nearly twice as likely to be affected by depression. In addition, women who are depressed during pregnancy are at elevated risk of several adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth, preeclampsia and postpartum depression. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a novel and independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among low-, medium-and high-risk patient populations. Elevated levels of ADMA and lower L-arginine are hypothesized to contribute to depression via adverse vascular effects. The objective of this study was to investigate differences in asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), and L-arginine among pregnant women with major depression. METHODS: Case-control study of 21 depressed pregnant women and 42 matched controls from the PEPP study. Maternal plasma ADMA, SDMA, and L-arginine were quantified, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), urine excretion of ADMA, SDMA, L-arginine, and Arginase I. ",

Michaela D Wharfe, Peter J Mark, Caitlin S Wyrwoll, Brendan J Waddell. School of Anatomy, Physiology and Human Biology, The University of Western Australia, Australia. INTRODUCTION: Maternal physiology undergoes major adaptations in pregnancy to ensure growth and development of the fetus and placenta whilst maintaining maternal wellbeing. Under normal conditions, many physiological processes (e.g. glucose homeostasis and oxidative metabolism), oscillate in circadian patterns driven by biological clocks entrained to the light-dark cycle.Clock genes (e.g. Clock, Bmal1, Per1) expressed within the suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral tissues (liver, kidney etc.), drive these metabolic processes in a circadian manner. How pregnancy impacts on clock gene expression and how this relates to changes in metabolic processes seen in pregnancy is currently unclear.Here we examined whether circadian expression of hepatic clock genes changes with the onset and progression of gestation. METHODS: Tissues were collected from C57Bl/6J mice (n=6 per group) at diestrus I in non-pregnant animals, or on day 10-11 or day 18-19 of gestation (term = day 19). Collections were performed at 6 circadian time points (0800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 0000, 0400h) throughout each 24 h period. mRNA expression levels for the core canonical clock genes were measured by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: While robust circadian rhythms in mRNA expression were evident for both Bmal1 (P<0.001) and Per1 (P<0.001) at all stages, pregnancy resulted in major changes in both their absolute expression and circadian patterns. Bmal1 expression increased dramatically (all circadian time points) between diestrus and day 10 (up to 14-fold; P<0.05), whereas Per1 increased 2-to 4-fold at 0800h (P<0.001), 2000h (P=0.027) and 0000h (P=0.011). Expression of both genes then fell between days 10 and 18 (Bmal1 by up to 96%; P<0.001; Per1 by up to 89%; P=0.002). Pregnancy also altered the circadian expression patterns of both genes; the amplitude of Bmal1 expression fell from 30-fold at diestrus to 12fold at day 10 before recovering by day 18. In contrast, Per1 amplitude increased from 13-fold at diestrus to 25-fold at day 10 of gestation, but then fell to only 3-fold by day 18. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data indicate that pregnancy induces major changes in the core circadian clock machinery of the maternal liver, an effect likely to drive key maternal metabolic adaptations. but subsequent studies did not confirm that association. This analysis has not been performed in maternal leukocyte DNA. We sought to determine whether subsequent mode of delivery (VD /CD) or the presence or absence of labor (+/-) prior to obtaining the sample were associated with differential methylation patterns in maternal leukocyte DNA. METHODS: Genome wide methylation profiles of maternal leukocyte DNA were evaluated in 29 women <24 hours prior to delivery of a term infant. Blood was drawn either during active labor (+) defined as painful contractions and dilation > 4 cm or in the absence of labor (-) prior to a scheduled cesarean or induction. Mode of delivery was ascertained by chart review. Bisulfite modified genomic DNA was run on the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Kit interrogating 450,000 CpG sites genome wide. Mean methylation at CpG sites were compared using a t-test, with correction for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR); sites with a p <0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: There were 12/29 + labor and 15/29 CD. After FDR correction, methylation patterns did not predict subsequent mode of delivery nor did the presence or absence of labor prior to blood draw alter methylation patterns in maternal leukocyte DNA. CONCLUSIONS: Acute events in parturition, such as the presence of labor, do not alter methylation patterns in maternal leukocytes. Nor does the maternal methylome predict mode of delivery. This can be contrasted with other factors like the presence of pregnancy alone (versus nonpregnant), the trimester of pregnancy, and the presence of preeclampsia at delivery which we have previously shown to impact the methylation pattern in maternal white blood cells. Our work suggests that labor and mode of delivery are not confounders in analysis of maternal leukocyte DNA methylome. Chronic hypoxia during gestation increases uterine vascular tone, which is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia and fetal intrauterine growth restriction. However, the mechanisms underlying chronic hypoxia-enhanced uterine arterial tone are not fully understood. The present study tested the hypothesis that chronic hypoxia increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inhibiting steroid hormone-mediated ERK signaling pathway and increasing uterine vascular tone in pregnancy. METHODS: Uterine arteries were isolated from nonpregnant (NPUA) and pregnant (PUA) (~140 day gestation) sheep maintained at either sea-level or high altitude (3,820m for 110 days, PaO 2 : 60mmHg). Uterine vascular function was determined in the 4 groups of animals. RESULTS: Long-term high altitude hypoxia increases ROS production in PUA but not NPUA. In pregnant sheep, pressure-induced myogenic tone of the uterine artery was significantly enhanced in hypoxic animals, as compared with the normoxic control. Pretreatment of uterine arteries with a ROS inhibitor, apocynin significantly inhibited vascular tone in hypoxic animals, and abrogated the difference in vascular tone between hypoxic and normoxic groups. In hypoxic animals, an ERK inhibitor, PD098059 had no effect on either pressure-dependent myogenic tone or PKC activator PDBu-induced contractions in the absence of apocynin. However, PD098059 significantly potentiated the vascular tone and PDBuinduced contractions of uterine arteries in the presence of apocynin. In nonpregnant sheep of hypoxic animals, treatment of uterine arteries with 17b-estradiol (E 2 ) and progesterone (P 4 ) for 48 h had no significant effects on pressure-dependent myogenic tone or PDBu-induced contractions in the absence of apocynin, but it significantly attenuated both pressureinduced vascular tone and PDBu-induced contractions in the presence of apocynin.",

This BK channel inhibition-mediated potentiation of PDBu-induced contractions was abrogated in uterine arteries of pregnant animals acclimatized to long-term high altitude hypoxia. In normoxic PUA, activation of both BK with NS1619 or SK with NS309 produced concentration-dependent relaxations, which were not altered by the addition of PDBu. However, in uterine arteries treated with chronic hypoxia (10.5% O 2 for 48 h), both NS1619-and NS309-induced relaxations were significantly attenuated by PDBu.

INTRODUCTION: Milk long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) arachidonic acid (AA) and DHA are produced 60% in maternal liver and 30% in mammary gland via desaturases (D5D and D6D) and elongase (Elovl 2 and 5) enzymes and constitute the major source of theses essential nutrients for the neonate. Arachidonic acid (AA) and DHA are essential LC-PUFA for normal development especially of the brain. METHODS: Female rats were fed control diet (C= 5% fat) or obesogenic (MO= 25% fat) during growth (21-120 days), pregnancy and lactation. At lactation day (LD) 20, milk was obtained and LD 21 liver and mammary gland obtained at necropsy, weighed and fatty acid profile measured by gas chromatography.

INTRODUCTION: Enhanced endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production via eNOS activation regulates vascular smooth muscle function contributes significantly to the dilatory effects of estrogens in the vasculature. However, whether smooth muscle regulates endothelial function is less studied. Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is primarily synthesized from L-cysteine by cystathionine b-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine g-lyase (CSE), which also dilates the vasculature. Hypothesis: Endothelial and smooth muscle derived H 2 S mediates estrogen activation of eNOS in endothelial cells. METHODS: Primary ovine uterine artery endothelial cells (UAEC) and uterine artery smooth muscle cells (UASMC) were cultured in MCDB 131 with 10% FBS. After starvation in phenol red-free M199 with 1% charcoal-striped FBS, UAEC were treated with 10 nM estradiol-17b (E2) or H 2 S donors for 5 min with or without specific CBS and CSE inhibitors for analyzing eNOS activation by immunoblotting and UAEC and UASMC were cultured for measuring H 2 S production by a novel H2S-specific fluorescence probe. UAEC were cultured in the bottom and UASMC were co-cultured on the membrane (pore size 1.0 mm) of transwell inserts to study endothelium-smooth muscle interaction in regulating endothelial eNOS activation in the presence and absence of CBS and CSE inhibitors. RESULTS: E2 and H 2 S donors stimulated rapid eNOS activation in UAEC and H 2 S production in both UAEC and UASMC. Pretreatment with either CBS or CSE or both inhibitors attenuated E2-, but not H 2 S donor-stimulated eNOS activation in UAEC. Co-culture with UASMC alone stimulated eNOS activation in UAEC, which was blocked by the presence of specific CBS and CSE inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial and smooth muscle cell production of H 2 S functions upstream of eNOS activation in response to estrogen stimulation, implicating a novel role of H 2 S in mediating endothelium-smooth muscle cross-talk.

INTRODUCTION: The sodium potassium pump plays an important role in the modulation of heart failure. We aimed to study the myocardial expression level of the sodium potassium pump (ATPase1a1 and ATPase1b1) in guinea pig cardiac myocytes in a model of cardiac pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in male and female GP. METHODS: GP subjected to TAC, male (n=15) and female (n=14). GP subjected to sham surgery, male (n=13) and female (n=5); Total RNA was extracted from left ventricles tissues using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen and the mRNA converted to cDNA. Copy numbers of ATPase-1a1, ATPase1b1 and GAPDH were measured by qPCR using a Rotor-Gene TM (Corbett Research, Australia). The results are presented as a ratio of GAPDH (mean \u00b1 SEM). For western blotting protein samples were denatured at 75 0 C, separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hertfordshire, UK). The membranes were incubated in 5% milk solution, washed with tris-buffered saline and tween 20 (TBS-T) and incubated with specific primary antibodies overnight at 4 0 C. Following this incubated with secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. Western Blotting Luminol Reagent (sc-2048 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA) was used to expose protein bands, which were expressed as a ratio of GAPDH. RESULTS: Aortic constriction increased ATP1a1 in both the female and male groups at 150 days following TAC. ATP1a1 was raised in the females from 25461 \u00b1 15205 to 10213011 \u00b1 10153573 and in males from 5.22 \u00b1 2.14 to 18.67 \u00b1 14.66. Interestingly, in the male group, there was a greater increase in ATP1a1 expression at 60 days following TAC than at 150 days (p<0.05 in all cases). Western blotting confirmed increased protein expression at cellular level. ATPase1b1 expression increased in the females from 14.56 \u00b1 7.86 to 105.68 \u00b1 48.81 and in males from 14.09 \u00b1 5.85 to 45.91 \u00b1 34.43. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate in this guinea pig model of heart failure that the sodium potassium pump is up-regulated. We also note gender differences. Currently the belief is that the sodium potassium pump functions inadequately during heart failure stage. Extension of this work will study the sodium potassium pump in heart disease during pregnancy. . Several normal chromosomes were present in 6 copies and 11 specific clonal chromosome rearrangements were present (fig 1) . In comparison, the composite karyotype of 3A-subE cells was 69~81, XXX[cp20] with several normal chromosomes present in 4 copies and 15 specific clonal rearrangements. A single population of SWAN-71 cells was observed with a DNA index of 5N. Both cell lines showed a high percent of cells in S phase (37-40%); however, SWAN -71 cells showed a higher proliferation rate. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that the most statistically significant difference in canonical pathways was inhibition of p53 signaling in SWAN-71 versus 3A-subE cells (p = 1.48E-07). CONCLUSIONS: Although SWAN-71 cells have been reported to retain similar features as primary first trimester trophoblast cells, extended growth in culture appears to have favored the appearance of aneuploid clones with genetic alterations in cell-cycle regulatory pathways. Thus, these findings emphasize the need to monitor for genetic instability in hTERT-immortalized cells and also the need for caution in the use of these cells to study normal trophoblast biology.",

Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand. INTRODUCTION: Maternal high-fat and/or salt intake is associated with developmental programming of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in adult offspring. There is significant evidence that inadequacies in placental nutrient transport may be responsible. We speculate that diet-induced inflammation may have detrimental effects on placental function leading to alterations in key nutrient transporters and angiogenic factors. The present study examined the effects of a maternal high-fat and/or salt diet on markers of placental nutrient transport, inflammation and angiogenesis. METHODS: Virgin Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to a) control (CD; 10% kcal from fat), b) high salt (HS; 4% salt, 10% kcal from fat), c) high fat (HF; 45% kcal from fat) or d) high-fat high-salt (HFS; 4% salt, 45% kcal from fat) 21 days prior to time-mating and throughout gestation. At embryonic day 18, placenta and fetuses were weighed, sexed and collected for molecular analysis. RESULTS: Maternal HS, HF and HFS consumption decreased weight of placenta derived from male offspring compared to CD; however weight of placenta derived from female offspring was only reduced with maternal HF diet. This was associated with increased expression of LPL and GLUT4 in placenta derived from male offspring indicating increased fetal exposure to free fatty acids and glucose. Maternal HS, HF and HFS dietary intake increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1b, TNFa and CD68 in placenta derived from male offspring. Furthermore DLK1, VEGF, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 expression was increased indicating altered angiogenic potential in placenta derived from male offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that placental inflammatory profile results in detrimental alterations in nutrient transport and placental angiogenesis which, in part, may contribute to the developmental origins of cardiovascular disease. We have studied singleton chorionic arterial and venous networks. Monochorionic twins have identical genetic makeup and so should share some of the genetic influence on angiogenesis and vascular networks. We explored the relationship of features of arterial and venous networks, and anastomosis type/number, in monochorionic twins delivered without laser ablation/modification of the vasculature. METHODS: 49 pairs of monochorionic twin placentas were injected post partum with colored dyes, and the larger and the smaller twins' (LT, ST) arterial and venous networks were traced according to a standard protocol. A total of 66 variables were extracted from LT and ST arterial and venous networks. Data reductions for variables related to the LT and ST arterial and venous networks were performed separately yielding 6,6,6, and 7 factors for the 4 networks, respectively. Regression adjusted birthweight discordance (BWD= larger-smaller/larger) for gestational age (GA), then added anastomoses type/number. Next the 4 factor sets were added separately, and point estimates of effect and significance compared. RESULTS: Extracted himfactors accounted for 83-87% of total data variance. Four of the 6 LT arterial network factors were correlated strongly with at least one ST arterial factor (p<0.001), 4 of 6 LT venous factors were more weakly associated with at least one ST venous factor (p<0.01). In regression with BWD and GA, only the presence/number of arterio-arterial (AA) anastomoses was positively correlated with BWD. Addition of LT or ST arterial factors or ST venous factors did not alter association with BWD, but inclusion of LT venous factors showed 4 of 6 factors associated with BWD with loss of correlation of type/number of AA anastomoses. LT venous factors were uncorrelated with AA presence/number. CONCLUSIONS: The LT venous network structure has the strongest correlation with BWD in unlasered monochorionic twins, by default with mild twin transfusion. Anastomoses may influence network structure, possibly preferntially in venous drainage networks. How LT venous structure alters the association of AA anastomoses with BWD remains to be determined. Although the placental volume growth pattern is known to be sigmoid, there does not exist a validated mathematical model that predicts placental volume growth over time. We developed a mathematical model that predicts placental volume growth at any gestational day. METHODS: We estimated the three parameters in the logistic growth model; the growth rate, the placental volume carrying capacity, and the 11-14 week placental volume (initial condition), from two placental volume data sets. We applied the placental volume measurements to algebraically determine the initial condition and the carrying capacity. By using the fact that the inflection point occurs at approximately 22 weeks, we calculated the growth rate by setting the second derivative of the placental volume model equal to zero and algebraically solving. We restricted parameter estimation to early measurements and then compared late gestation predicted to actual placental volumes.",

Exosomes are nanoparticle (40-100 nm) membrane vesicles that are released following the exocytotic fusion of multi-vesicular bodies with the cell membrane. The significance of exosomal signaling in diverse aspects of physiology and pathophysiology has only recently been recognized. Recently, we demonstrated that exosomes are released from first trimester placental mesenchymal stem cells (pMSC) and increased endothelial cell migration and vascular tube formation. The molecular mechanisms that mediate exosome effects are not well defined, therefore the aim of this study was to further elucidate potential interactions and pathways activated by exosomal proteins isolated from pMSC exposed to low oxygen tensions. METHODS: pMSC were isolated from placental villi (8-12 weeks of gestation, n=6) and cultured under an atmosphere of 1%, 3% or 8% O 2 . Cell-conditioned media were collected and exosomes (exo-pMSC) isolated by differential and buoyant density centrifugation using a sucrose continuous gradient. The presence of spherical vesicles was established using electron microscope and the expression of exosomes markers by Western Blot. Proteins captured with exosomes (exosomal proteins) and identified by LC-MS/MS on 5600 Triple TOF mass spectrometer (AB Sciex) were analysed using the Mascot and Protein Pilot search engines against the Swissprot-swissprot database with the species set as human (scores greater than 30). False discovery rate (FDR) was estimated using a reversed sequence database. Proteins identified were submitted to bioinformatic pathway analysis (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis [IPA]). RESULTS: Exo-pMSC were identified as nanovesicles with a typical cupshape and diameters around of 100 nm and positive for exosome markers: CD63, CD9 and CD81. MS analysis identified over 400 different proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization, development, immunomodulatory, and cell-to-cell communication. The IPA revealed oxygen-dependent changes in protein content and signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: pMSC-derived exosomes promote vasculogenesis and participate in vascular formation in the human placenta, the exosomal protein contents could potentially be used as molecular targets for futures studies. and toxicity studies in humans, but has not been applied to endocrine studies. We aimed to characterize and validate placental explants from both humans and mice for sex steroid studies. Mouse placental explants were evaluated in addition to humans, since mice are a common model in reproductive and developmental research. METHODS: Human and mouse placentas were collected by caesarean section, dissected and plated in Ham's F12 medium, then cultured for up to 96h. Explant viability and sex steroids were measured in media. Expression and activities of the placental steroidogenic (3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, aromatase), clearance (UDPglucuronosyltransferase (UGT), sulfotransferase (SULT)), and regeneration enzymes (b-glucuronidase (b-G), arylsulfatase C (ASC)) were determined in explants. RESULTS: Human and mouse explants were viable for up to 96h, but progesterone, estrone, and estradiol secretion decreased. Steroidogenic enzyme expression and activities were stable in mouse explants and similar to freshly isolated tissue. In contrast, steroidogenic enzymes in human explants were significantly lower than in fresh tissue (P<0.01). The ratio of UGT:b-G activities in human explants shifted towards less steroid elimination, SULT was detected in human but not mouse explants, and neither demonstrated ASC activity. CONCLUSIONS: In mice, steroidogenesis in culture remains accurate to the in vivo situation and may be useful for endocrine studies and associated fields, e.g., endocrine disruption. Human placental explant cultures are not useful for studying steroidogenesis, but are useful for studying short term metabolic clearance and transfer (<48h). Despite these discrete uses, neither mouse nor human placental explants are appropriate for studying sex steroid endocrinology in totality due to culture effects on endocrine pathways.",

HCG induced angiogenic molecules, such as HIF-1a via ELISA and downstream molecules, such as CXCL12 and CXCR4 via realtime PCR were determined. Functionally, the chemotactic properties of hCG were studied using Boyden chambers. RESULTS: The LH/hCG receptor was detected in lymphatic, uterine microvascular, umbilical vain, and circulating angiogenic cells. Furthermore, hCG induced key angiogenic molecules, i.e. HIF-1a, CXCL12, and CXCR4 and led to a dose dependent migration of cells that was specifically inhibited by LH/hCG antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to the importance of hCG as one of the first angiogenic molecules produced by the conceptus. HCG itself alters endothelial motility and recruitment, but is also involved in indirect mechanisms, like oxygen independent HIF induction, which might be crucial for vascular modifications and adaption in early placental formation, implantation, the development of an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome or tumor growth. INTRODUCTION: Impaired spiral artery remodeling is a major pathology of the human pregnancy-specific hypertensive disorder preeclampsia (PE). Corin is a cardiac protease important for regulating blood pressure. Placental corin deficiency perturbs mouse spiral artery remodeling, resulting in hypertension during pregnancy. However, whether placental corin expression is developmentally regulated and affected by preeclampsia during human pregnancy is not well-understood. Hypothesis: Human placental corin expression is developmentally regulated and downregulated in preeclampsia. METHODS: Normal placentas were collected from the first (5-11 wks, n=9) and second (14 -17 wks, n=8) trimester pregnancies of elective terminations and the third trimester at delivery (38 -39 wks, n=7). Placentas were also collected from C-sections of term severe preeclampsia with small for gestational age (PE-SGA, n=3) or appropriate gestational age (PE-AGA, n=6), severe preeclampsia with gestational diabetes mellitus (PE-GDM, n=4) and GDM (n=5) controls, as well as earlyonset (prior to 34 wks) PE with SGA (pre-SGA, n=3), AGA (n=6), and gestational age matched preterm controls (n=7). Total RNA samples were extracted for measuring corin mRNA expression by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and quantified by DCT algorithm using L-19 as the reference. RESULTS: Placental levels of corin mRNA increases with gestational age and are significantly greater in the third compared to the first and second trimesters (p<0.01). Placental corin mRNA levels in pre-PE-SGA did not differ from that of pre-AGA. However, the levels are significantly lower in the PE-SGA and PE-GDM compared to normotensive controls (p<0.05). No difference was found between the GDM and normotensive placentas. CONCLUSIONS: Human placental corin mRNA expression increases during pregnancy and is downregulated in some types of preeclampsia, suggesting a role of corin in placental development and the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (NIH HL70562 & HL98746).",

Hyun Sun Ko, 1 Sae Kyung Choi, 1 Hee Kyung Kang, 1 Ho Shik Kim, 2 In Yang Park, 1 Jong Chul Shin. Our previous studies have shown that OSM promotes trophoblast invasion activity via the increased enzyme activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9. Here, we further investigate OSM-induced intracellular signaling mechanisms associated with these events in the immortalized human trophoblast cell line, HTR8/SVneo. METHODS: The activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 induced by OSM were examined by western blot. To investigate the involvement of the STAT3 and ERK signaling pathway on OSM-induced MMP-2 and-9 expression, we pretreated HTR8/SVneo cells with STAT3 inhibitor (stattic) or ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126), prior to OSM treatment. In addition, the effects of STAT3 and ERK siRNA transfection on OSMinduced MMP-2 and -9 expressions were investigated by Western blot. The invasion activities of HTR8SVneo cells by OSM were measured by matrigel invasion assays, according to the STAT3 or ERK inhibition. RESULTS: OSM induced STAT3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and it was blocked by the inhibitors, respectively. OSM-induced MMP-2 and -9 protein expressions were significantly suppressed by STAT3 inhibition with stattic and STAT3 silencing, respectively (p< 0.05, both), while ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, and ERK silencing significantly suppressed OSM-induced MMP-2 protein expression, only (p< 0.05). The increased invasion activity by OSM was significantly suppressed by STAT3 or ERK1/2 inhibition (p< 0.01 and p< 0.05, respectively), which was more pronounced by STAT3 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that both of STAT3 and ERK signaling are related with the OSM-induced invasion activity via upregulating expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in trophoblast cells. The activation and upregulation of STAT3 appears to be critical for the OSMmediated increase in invasiveness of HTR8/SVneo cells.",

Adrianne L Stefanski, 1,2 Michael D Renecle, 1 Kristen K Rumer, 1 Virginia D Winn. 1 1 Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Colorado-AMC, Aurora, CO, USA; 2 Graduate Program in Reproductive Sciences, University of Colorado-AMC, Aurora, CO, USA. INTRODUCTION: Siglec-6 is a sialic-acid binding transmembrane receptor expressed on cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts of the human placenta. Interestingly, placental expression of Siglec-6 is unique to humans. Siglec-6 is overexpressed in the placentas of pre-eclamptic pregnancies. However, the function of Siglec-6 in the human placenta is currently unknown. Many structurally similar Siglecs become phosphorylated on intracellular tyrosine residues, recruit SH-2 phosphatases, and initiate downstream inhibitory signaling cascades. However, it is currently unknown if Siglec-6 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and signals in this manner. We sought to test the hypothesis that Siglec-6 can become tyrosine phosphorylated and recruit SHP-2 via intracellular signaling. METHODS: Site-directed mutagenesis was used to mutate residues thought to be important for Siglec-6-dependent signal transduction. Specifically, both intracellular tyrosine residues were mutated alone (Y413F, Y433F) or in combination (YFYF), and an intracellular truncation was created (ICtrunc). HTR-8/SVneo cells were transfected with Siglec-6, Siglec-6 mutants, or empty vector (pCDH). Cells were treated with or without pervanadate and cell lysates were (co)-immunoprecipitated (IP) using an anti-Siglec-6 antibody. (co)-IP lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Siglec-6, anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10), and anti-SHP-2 antibodies. RESULTS: Following pervanadate treatment, Siglec-6 becomes phosphorylated on both intracellular tyrosine residues (Y413, Y433). Pervandate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Siglec-6 was abrogated by mutation of both intracellular tyrosine residues (Y413, Y433). Phosphorylation of Siglec-6 recruited the downstream phosphatase SHP-2. CONCLUSIONS: Placental Siglec-6 has signaling potential via intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation and the SHP-2 pathway. Siglec-6, which is increased in PE, may contribute to signaling that impacts trophoblast function and contributes to PE pathogenesis. (Ecs) and functions as a negative feedback regulator of angiogenesis. Vasohibin-2 (VASH2) is a homologue of VASH1 and functions to promote angiogenesis. To date, few studies have investigated the role of Vasohibins in placental angiogenesis. In the present study we aimed to: i) investigate the spatial expression of VASH1 and VASH2 in human placenta; and ii) evaluate the functional role of VASH2 in murine placental development. METHODS: Human placental tissue was collected from normal pregnancies (n=4) and used for immunohistochemistry analysis. Timedmated vasohibin2 -/transgenic (Vash2null, n=19) and C57BL6 (wild-type, n=30) mice were euthanized on 12.5 (n=5/6), 16.5 (n=6/5) and 18.5 (n=9/5) eGA (estimate Gestational Age). We performed immunohistchemisry for CD31 antibody ,endothelial cell marker, and calculated the fetal vascular area covered with CD31 staining. We used quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to analyze placental expression of Glial-cell missing 1 (Gcm1, a placenta-specific transcriptional factor), differentiation-inducing factor for trophoblasts and syncytin B, a key regulator for trophoblastic fusion, regulated by Gcm1. The statistical significance of differences between groups was evaluated with Student's t-test .The ethics permission for these studies were obtained from the ethics committee of Tohoku University. RESULTS: In human placenta, VASH1 was expressed in fetal vascular ECs, and VASH2 was expressed in trophoblast cells. Placental weight in the Vash2null mice was significantly less than the control group at 18.5 eGA (72 \u00b1 3 mg vs. 82 \u00b1 3 mg, p<0.001).The fetal vascular area in the labyrinth layer in Vash2null placenta was significantly smaller than controls at 18.5 dpc (29 \u00b1 5 % vs. 36 \u00b1 6 %, p<0.01). The placental expression of Gcm1 was unchanged between groups. Interestingly, syncytin B expression in Vash2null placental tissue was significantly suppressed by 50% compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we have demonstrated differential expression of VASH1 and 2 in human placenta. Furthermore, we propose that VASH2 might play important role in murine placental morphogenesis through regulation of syncytin B expression.",

            "text": "Identification of Candidate Genes in Human Placenta Involved in the Development of Childhood Allergy. Astrud R Tuck, Annette Osei-Kumah, Zarqa Saif, Vicki L Clifton. Robinson Institute, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of childhood allergic disease has increased dramatically in developed countries. Modern environmental changes are hypothesised to be causing deviations in fetal programming, in which the placenta plays a central role, increasing the susceptibility and prevalence of disease throughout life. We hypothesised that susceptibility to childhood allergy is determined by changes in placental function that programs immune function in the fetus in a sex-specific manner. In this study we aimed to identify candidate genes and pathways in human placental tissue that may contribute to the development of childhood allergy. METHODS: Human placental tissue was obtained after delivery from women giving informed consent at the Lyell McEwin Hospital, Adelaide, and global gene expression was examined via microarray analysis. Placentae from pregnancies that gave rise to children with allergy by 4 years of age (n=45) were compared to placentae from children with no allergy (n=17), and sex-specific differences were also examined. Differentially expressed genes and pathways associated with allergy were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Immune genes with a fold-change greater than 1.5 were validated by qPCR. Statistical analysis was performed on males and females separately with significance set at P<0.05. RESULTS: Microarray analysis identified placental gene changes in dermatological and respiratory disease networks of male offspring, and immunological disease and immune cell trafficking networks of female offspring who developed an allergy. Specifically, qPCR validation showed increased expression of interleukin 13 receptor alpha 1 (IL13RA1) and decreased expression of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) (P<0.05). These immune genes were also expressed in a sex-specific manner. Cytokine growth factor kit ligand (KITL) and its receptor, kit, were not associated with allergy but expression was shown to be higher and more variable in female placentae compared to male placentae (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified genes known to be involved in inflammation that appear to be differentially regulated in male and female placentae, suggesting sex-specific roles in fetal development. The roles of each gene in placental function and fetal development are unknown, and may have sex-specific roles in the programming of fetal immune function and contribution of allergy susceptibility. To verify whether fetuses classified as adequate for gestational age (AGA) at birth and who showing a declined intrauterine growth curve, have an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome. METHODS: A group of singleton pregnancies (n=509) were prospectively evaluated: 1st trimester dating, excluding small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) fetuses, fetuses affected by intrauterine growth retardation, fetal malformations and preterm birth. Fetal growth parameters were evaluated by US routinary biometry in the mid trimester (22-24 weeks) and in the imminence of delivery (37-41 weeks). Each parameter of abdominal circumference (AC) was converted to Multiples of Median (MoM) according to the Local Reference Curve and a coefficient of variation was calculated between the two measurements (Delta MoM), to identify fetuses who showed a decreased intrauterine growth trend (Delta MoM<0 -cases) and fetuses who maintain or improve their intrauterine growth trend (Delta MoM \u2265 0 -controls). Neonatal outcome measures were: birth weight, Apgar",

PA and clinical outcomes were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. The cost of inpatient care was estimated from hospital charges. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) representing the association between PA and each adverse outcome. Generalized linear modeling was used to estimate the excess direct medical costs incurred by PA-affected pregnancies. RESULTS: There were 197,421 diagnoses of PA during the study period, representing a national prevalence of 354 per 100,000 delivery-related discharges. PA was associated with an increased risk of preterm labor (AOR=1.67; 95% CI=1.61-1.74), early onset delivery (AOR=2.32; 95% CI=2.24-2.41), poor fetal growth (AOR=1.49; 95% CI=1.40-1.60), stillbirth (AOR=7.81; 95% CI=7.38-8.26), prolonged hospital stay (AOR=1.29; 95% CI=1.22-1.37), and hysterectomy (AOR=13.69; 95% CI=12. 30-15.25 ). An inpatient discharge with a PA diagnosis costs, on average, $1,226 more than one without PA, translating into over $99 million in additional healthcare costs from 2001-2009. CONCLUSIONS: PA is associated with an increased odds of adverse maternal-fetal outcomes, and a significant increase in the cost of inpatient care. Since the major risk factor for PA is a previous cesarean section, interventions that effectively lower the primary cesarean section rate have the potential to reduce maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality, and realize substantial cost savings. and smoking effects on umbilical vascular dynamics, we measured catecholamine levels in umbilical cord tissues and correlated effects on catecholamines with METH use, tobacco smoking and clinical obstetric outcomes. METHODS: Umbilical cords (54) were collected prospectively at birth, washed of blood then immediately stored frozen at -80 \u00b0C. Cords were thawed and whole lysates prepared, protein normalized and catecholamine levels quantified with ELISA. Results were compared to pregnancy demographics, clinical outcomes, METH and smoking status. RESULTS: Catecholamine levels in umbilical tissues (arterial and vein endothelia) were not associated with maternal age, gravidity, parity, gestational age, neonatal or placental weight. Neither smoking nor METH affected dopamine or epinephrine. However, smoking (2-fold) and METH (4-fold) decreased norepinephrine levels in mono-drug mothers and had synergism (60-fold reduction, P = 0.025) in mothers who both smoked tobacco and used METH.",

Debra Goldman-Wohl, 1 Caryn Greenfield, 1 Iris Eisenberg-Loebl, 1 Galia Skarzinski, 2 Ronit Haimov-Kochman, 1 Tal Imbar, 1 Ilana Ariel, 2 Simcha Yagel. We established a fluorescent in situ hybridization system that enables detection of snRNA (small nuclear RNA) in the placenta. Based on this methodology we demonstrated reduced U2 and U6 snRNA in the syncytiotrophoblast throughout the course of pregnancy suggesting that while the placenta has evolved a large surface area for transport function a method evolved to control protein production in the massive number of syncytial nuclei. Using this RNA in situ system and qRTPCR we also showed reduced snRNA in primary trophoblasts and trophoblast cell lines cultured under fusion conditions. We have now extended our observations to placental pathologies where protein expression may be dysregulated, as well as to proteins of the spliceosome complex. METHODS: RNA in situ hybridization of U2 and U6 snRNA was performed on placental sections of pathologies including: molar pregnancies (n3), choriocarcinoma (n1) preeclampsia (n4) and trisomy 21 (n5) and normal controls. Analysis of proteins associated with splicing and the spliceosome complex of normal placental sections was performed using the Human Protein Atlas database. RESULTS: As in normal placenta, snRNA was reduced in syncytiotrophoblast of molar pregnancies, preeclampsia and choriocarcinoma. Inconsistent results were obtained in placenta of trisomy 21 (3/5 reduced). Proteins associated with splicing were generally not downregulated in the syncytium although RBFOX2 was downregulated. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptional downregulation, as detected by reduced snRNA in syncytiotrophoblast of placental pathologies, suggests that this mechanism is not defective in the protein dysregulation associated with these pathologies. However, in a subset of trisomy 21 the altered protein levels may be associated with altered transcriptional downregulation. Interestingly, RBFOX2, a protein involved with alternate splicing and epithelial to mesenchymal transition and interaction with estrogen receptor 1 transcription factor is downregulated in the syncytium. Thus the enigmatic reduced snRNA of the syncytium is preserved in most placental pathologies whereas most associated splicing proteins investigated are not downregulated in normal placental syncytium. Chorionic villi (CV) are essential for the transport of oxygen and metabolites in the maternal-fetal interface. Studies from our group demonstrated the upregulation of Ang II in the CV of preeclamptic (PE) women. We determined whether preeclampsia alters the expression of apelin or apelin receptor (APJ) in CV and whether Ang II reduces apelin release from the placental CV explants obtained from normotensive pregnant (NP) women and PE women at the time of delivery (36-38 wks of gestation). METHODS: Apelin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). APJ mRNA was determined by the real time RT-PCR. CV were incubated for 0, 2 and 16 hours (hrs) in DMEM/F12 media with or without Ang II (1 nM and 1 \u00b5M), and for 2 hrs with Ang II plus losartan (1mM) under controlled O 2 and CO 2 . RESULTS: Apelin levels were reduced in CV of PE vs NP (PRE: 15117 \u00b1 883.1 vs. NP: 19424 \u00b1 1309 pg/g of tissue, p<0.01). The levels of APJ mRNA in CV were not different in PE vs NP. The unstimulated release of apelin was significantly reduced in the conditioned media from PE vs NP villi at 2 hrs (PE: 181.1 \u00b1 31 vs. NP: 309.5 \u00b1 51.4 pg/ml, p<0.05). There was a significant increase in apelin release from both NP (267.8 \u00b1 34.8 vs.",

Ang II inhibited the release of apelin from CV of the NP at 2 hrs (p<0.05). At 16 hrs, Ang II inhibited the release of apelin from both NP (2 fold) and PE (1.8 fold) villi (p<0.05). AT1R antagonist losartan increased apelin release from CV of NP and PE (p<0.05). APJ was predominantly localized to syncytiotrophoblasts and fetal vascular cells of CV -areas associated with AT1R localization. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of immunoreactive apelin were reduced in the placenta of PE. Our data showing a negative influence of Ang II on apelin release from CV suggest an opposing interaction between these peptides in the human placental tissue. Reduced apelin activity would remove its counter-regulatory actions on Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular resistance, and inflammation -abnormalities which precede and sustain preeclampsia.",

INTRODUCTION: Trophoblast invasion into the maternal endometrium plays a crucial role in human pregnancy. Dysregulation of the finely controlled process of trophoblast invasion can lead to a wide spectrum of pregnancy abnormalities. Various studies have demonstrated that invasion process is facilitated by the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). However, the relationship between the expression of these invasion-associated proteinases and the abnormal trophoblast invasion-related diseases has not been elucidated so far.",

We evaluated the expressions of MMP-2, -8, -9, -11, -19, -15 (MT2-MMP), -16 (MT3-MMP), -24 (MT5-MMP), TIMP-1 and -3 by applying western blot and immunohistochemistry methods. RESULTS: In the five groups, we detected protein levels of eight MMPs and two TIMPs. Comparing to the normal pregnancies, MMP-2, -8, -9, -11, -19, MT2-MMP and MT-5-MMP were strongly expressed in hydatidiform mole tissues (p<0.05), while the expression of MMP-2, -8, -9 were down-regulated in villous tissues of pre-eclampsia and FGR cases (p<0.05). TIMP-1, -3 was increased in pre-elcampsia (p<0.05). Whereas MMP-11 was only down-regulated in pre-elcampsia (p<0.05). TIMP-3 was found only increased in FGR (p<0.05). No significant difference was found between normal vaginal deliveries and cesarean deliveries. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting alterations in MMPs and TIMPs that are related with varying degrees of local trophoblast invasion. We speculate that the change of invasion-associated proteinases expression will affect placental development and may thus contribute to the development of abnormal trophoblast invasion-related diseases of pregnancy such as complete hydatidiform mole, pre-eclampsia and FGR. Placental CRH expression increases in the third trimester resulting in an exponential rise of maternal CRH levels towards term. The increase is predictive of the time of labour suggesting that it is associated with the mechanism that determines gestational length. We have explored the possibility that epigenetic DNA methylation is involved in the gestational programming of CRH gene activity in trophoblast cells.",

CRH mRNA and peptide levels were measured with qRT-PCR and RIA, respectively. Methylation of the 9 CpG sites in the CRH proximal promoter was determined by bisulfite sequencing, and promoter binding of pol-II, TBP and phospho-(p)CREB was measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: CRH mRNA abundance increased 60-fold by 72 h relative to fresh cells and was further stimulated to 900-fold by 8-BrcAMP. CRH peptide cumulative output had similar kinetics. All CpG sites were partially methylated (17-70% of alleles) including CpG-2 located in the cAMP-response element (CRE), which is inactive when methylated. Methylation frequency was unaltered during culture and by 8-BrcAMP (Fisher's exact). Promoter binding of pol-II increased ~10-fold by 8-BrcAMP and the bound DNA had a characteristic high CpG methylation pattern. Phospho-CREB bound to the CRE region increasingly during culture and in response to 8-BrcAMP, but to a separate population of alleles with a distinct methylation pattern. TBP binding increased during syncytialisation, but not in response to 8-BrcAMP. TBP-bound alleles were enriched in methylation patterns recognizing pol-II and pCREB. CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation determines the transcriptionally active (pol-II-binding) population of CRH gene copies in the trophoblast. The pCREB-CRE interaction at the promoter is not involved in CRH gene regulation in native trophoblast chromatin. Chromatin opens up during syncytial differentiation allowing TBP binding to the CRH promoter, followed by pol-II-dependent transcription upon cAMP stimulation. We propose that conditions that influence gestational length abrogate DNA methylation in early pregnancy and program CRH expression epigenetically by altering the number of transcriptionally active alleles. Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world. Coffee consumption is associated with a significant decreased risk of CVD preeclampsia, however the mechanism is unknown. Caffeine is the most studied compound in coffee. Caffeine acutely activates 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (PKA) and acts as an adenosine receptor blocker. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase and metabolized primarily by the enzyme DDAH1. ADMA is an independent risk factor of CVD, and significantly elevated in hypercholesterolemia and preeclampsia. Recent data indicates activation of the PKA pathway increases DDAH expression and decreases ADMA. High circulating levels of circulating soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1) are associated with preeclampsia and its related complications. Circulating sFlt1 is largely derived from the placenta and drops dramatically after delivery. Our aim is to evaluate novel upstream pathways that regulate sFlt1 production.",

The reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) rats were used as animal models of pregnancy induced hypertension. RESULTS: 38 natural compounds showed inhibition of sFlt1 production >75% at nanomolar doses in primary cytotrophoblasts and villous explants. Three of these drugs were cardiac glycosides, including Ouabain, Gitoxigenin and Digitoxin. Ouabain inhibited sFlt1 protein synthesis and mRNA expression in human placental cytotrophoblast and explant cultures from normal and preeclamptic patients in a dose and time dependent manner. In vivo, ouabain administration in RUPP rats resulted in a decrease in placental sFlt1 expression and mean arterial pressure with no change in pup or placental weight. Ouabain inhibited hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1a) protein expression but not HIF-1\u00df through a non-ubiquitin dependent pathway and that this repression of HIF-1a was dependent on Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp 27) phosphorylation.

Obstetrics and Gynecology, lis Maternal Hospital, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center,Tel Aviv university, Tel Aviv, Israel. INTRODUCTION: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is characterized by pruritus, elevated transaminases and elevated total bile acid (TBA) occurs in the third trimester.Recently, we observed several cases where women presented with ICP followed by preeclamsia toxemia (PET) few weeks later. The aim of this study was to investigate whether ICP is associated with PET. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2012, 63 women (41 singleton and 23 twin pregnancies) were diagnosed with ICP, based on clinical presentation , elevated liver enzymes and elevated TBA (>10 \u00b5mol/ml).Severity of ICP was defi ned based on TBA level: severe (>40 \u00b5mol/ml), moderate (20-40 \u00b5mol/ml) and mild (10-20 \u00b5mol/ml) . The data on the incidence of PET in general population was obtained from a recent study in our institution (Laskov et al. 2013) . Mild and severe PET were found in 1.8% and 0.8% in singleton and 4 % and 1.7% in twin pregnancies, respectively.Similar data was presented by Day and Sibai et al. (AJOG 2005) . RESULTS: In singletons, the overall incidence of PET was higher than expected in the general population (7.8% vs. 2.6) mostly due to higher incidence of severe PET (4.8 %). In twin pregnancies the incidence of PET was 34.5 % (mild=13.5%, severe 21%), higher than in the general population. Importantly, we also found a correlation between ICP severity and PET incidence (fi gure1, 2).Interestingly, among 20 consequent women presented at 30-37 weeks of gestational age with PET, based on signifi cant proteinuria (1-4 grams/ 24hours) and elevated liver enzymes, no women had elevated TBA. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of severe PET was higher in ICP patients in both singleton and twin pregnancies. Furthermore we observed a correlation between ICP severity and PET. These fi ndings are novel and suggest that ICP might be a risk factor for PET.",

There were no significant differences in other demographic parameters. In our institution the current practice is to induce labor at 38-39 weeks in womenwith previous pregnancy complications and thrombophilia treated by LMWH .Therefore, 54.8% of the deliveries in the study group were induced compared to 21.1% in the control group (p<0.05). The cesarean section (CS) rate was similar in both groups (33.3% vs. 29.4%, p>0.05) as well as the rate of elective CS (20.1% VS 17%. P>0.05) and non elective CS (13.2% VS 12.4 %. P>0.05). Importantly, the incidence of placentamediated complications was similar in the study and control groups (5% vs. 4.5%, p>0.05). Neonatal outcome was also similar in both groups. A multivariate analysis revealed that the primary outcome was not affected by demographic parameters, the onset of labor or mode of delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Several studies have shown that women with previous placenta-mediated pregnancy complications and thrombophilia are at higher risk for recurrent complications in future pregnancy. Therefore, the similar rate of complications in the study and control groups supports the current policy that combines LMWH treatment and induction of labor at weeks 38-39 in this group of women in order to prevent reccurent pregnancy complications . Pre-eclampsia is an important gestational complication, which appears in 3-5% of all pregnancies and has a significant impact on maternal and infant health. Its pathophysiology is still not clarified but the placenta plays an important role in this disease. The current study deals with the influence of lipid mediators on the maternal circulation and placental function in pregnancy. The focus lies on certain members of the family of nonprostanoid eicosanoids, namely EETs (epoxyeicosatrienoic acids) and HETEs (hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids), which are mainly cytochrome P450 metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway and have already been shown to play an important role in cardiovascular disease. The hypothesis of the study is that altered regulation of EET and HETE metabolites is associated with pre-eclampsia. The aim is to elucidate altered levels of EET and HETE metabolites in human placental tissues and blood of pre-eclamptic compared to healthy women. METHODS: Pre-eclamptic women were identified according to definitions of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Placental and plasma samples were collected at matched gestations from 20 preeclamptic and 20 healthy pregnant women. A liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LCMS) method was developed and is being used to measure mediator concentrations in aforementioned tissues and plasma. RESULTS: An LCMS method was developed, which quantifies up to 40 lipids including EETs and HETEs with high sensitivity and specificity. Preliminary analysis of human plasma samples reveals detectable lipid concentrations including those of EETs and HETEs within the nanomolar to picomolar ranges. Quality controls showed reproducibility of the method (n=9). Work is currently underway to determine whether EET and HETE metabolite levels differ between pre-eclamptic and healthy pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: A method has been developed, validated and established for quantification of lipid levels. Further work aims to apply this method to a range of clinical samples in order to show the role of nonprostanoid eicosanoids in pre-eclampsia. Elaboration of our earlier findings, showing altered HETE levels in placental tissue, may enable novel possibilities of diagnosis or treatment. We hypothesize that abnormal angiogenic profile predicts severity of preeclampsia and illustrates differences in phenotype of normal pregnancies. METHODS: Plasma sFlt1 and placental growth factor (PlGF) concentrations were measured at a routine outpatient visit at 23-25 weeks' gestation in 1981 pregnant women, 214 with preeclampsia and 1767 with normal, uncomplicated pregnancy. High angiogenic profile was determined by sFlt1/PlGF ratio > median for preeclamptic pregnancies. A Z-score of birthweight was calculated, adjusting for gestational age at delivery. Preeclampsia was diagnosed by ACOG criteria. RESULTS: High second trimester sFlt1/PlGF ratio > 18.9 predicted significant growth restriction in both preterm (<37 weeks EGA) and term preeclampsia 2-3 months prior to clinical diagnosis (Z-score b= -0.3, p=0.0003). Similarly, high ratio predicted lower gestational age at delivery in all subjects with preeclampsia (b= -0.5, p=0.0001). In contrast, low second trimester sFlt1/PlGF ratio in preterm preeclampsia was associated with higher birthweight, corrected for gestational age, even in preterm deliveries. In subjects with term preeclampsia and low ratio, birthweight was similar to full-term uncomplicated deliveries. There were no differences in age or BMI between preeclamptic subjects with high ratio versus low ratio. In full-term, uncomplicated pregnancies, a high second trimester ratio predicted lower birth weight (Z-score b= -0.1, p=0.0001). Normal subjects with high ratio also had similar age and BMI as those with low ratio. CONCLUSIONS: High sFlt1/PlGF in the second trimester effectively identifies women at risk for growth restriction in both preeclamptic and normal pregnancies. This ratio may be a simple, effective method to identify patients with more severe disease and potential for worse neonatal outcomes. In this study we examined whether retrograde shear rate and endothelial function are related in healthy and formerly preeclamptic (PE) women and whether this relationship is altered by exercise training. METHODS: Formerly PE-women (32\u00b14 years, n=20) and controls (32\u00b14 years, n=20), all 6-12 months post-partum, performed a 12-week supervised aerobic exercise training. We measured brachial artery shear rate (SR) and endothelial function by flow-mediated dilation (FMD, echo-Doppler). We quantified resting autonomic activity using power spectral analysis and calculated low-frequency/high-frequency(LF/HF)-ratio. RESULTS: Antegrade SR was not different between groups, whilst retrograde SR was significantly higher and FMD% lower in PE-women compared to controls (both P<0.05). Retrograde shear correlated strongly with FMD% in PE-women and controls (P<0.05). LF/HF-ratio was strongly and inversely correlated with brachial artery retrograde SR and FMD% (both P<0.05) in PE-women and controls. Exercise training reduced retrograde shear, improved FMD%, and reduced LF/HF-ratios similarly in both groups (all P<0.05). Training-induced changes in retrograde SR correlated with changes in FMD and LF/HF-ratio. CONCLUSIONS: A higher brachial artery retrograde SR is related to elevation in sympathetic nerve tone and lower brachial artery endothelial function, in both controls and formerly PE-women. Exercise training improves retrograde SR, whilst the magnitude of this change correlated strongly with improvements in FMD and reductions in sympathetic dominance. Therefore, the impact of PE and exercise training on endothelial health may, at least partly, be related to retrograde shear rate.",

Whether this is true also in fetal membranes is not known. This is importance since PPROM/ preterm birth is more common in women with PE. We hypothesize that this may be due to increased oxidative DNA damage & apoptosis in the fetal membranes of women with PE leading to gradual weakening of the membranes and PPROM/preterm birth. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that fetal membranes from PE pregnancies have more DNA damage and apoptosis in vivo than those from gestational age-matched controls. In contrast, expression of the BER proteins (OGG1 & APE1) is low at baseline and unchanged in women with PE, suggesting that fetal membranes may have limited capacity to repair DNA damage. These data support the theory that PE is associated with increased oxidative DNA damage & apoptosis in the placenta/fetal membranes.",

Luigi Gonzaga, Orbassano, Italy. INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia and CKD, affecting 3-5% of all pregnancies, are both characterized by hypertension and proteinuria, leading to a difficult or impossible clinical differential diagnosis in pregnancy. The issue is important considering both the different pregnancy outcomes and the need for a different follow-up after delivery. Two retrospective studies by our group suggested a role of s-Flt-1/PlGF ratio and of the analysis of utero-placental Doppler flows in this challenging differential diagnosis: the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was significantly increased in PE relative to CKD and controls; normal utero-placental Doppler wave forms suggested CKD, altered wave forms PE. The aim of the present study was to test prospectively and conjunctly these two hypotheses on a large, homogeneously treated, population. METHODS: s-Flt-1 and PlGF levels were determined by specific and commercially available ELYCSIS assay (Roche) using an immunoanalyzer Cobas 601/2. We analyzed 59 singleton pregnancies (18 PE, 28 CKD and 13 patients with other hypertensive disorders), 18 twin pregnancies and a case of superimposed PE. When more serum samples were available, we selected the first sample available after 24 weeks of gestational age. Doppler velocimetry was performed by the same group of skilled operators, by standard methods, in 55 cases. We considered as pathological a RI\u22650.58 and referred to gestational-age adjusted reference tables for PI (Todros et al, Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand, 1996) . RESULTS: s-Flt-1/PlGF ratio was statistically different in the three groups: PE (median 334.77 (range: 45.4-2454.94)), CKD (median 7.46 (range: 1.43-270.74)) and \"other\" (median 57.89 (range: 1.46-800.24)) (p<0.001). Patients with altered flows had higher s-Flt-1/PlGF ratio (381.6 (9.5-921) vs 10. ",

Aim: To study the postpartum angII sensitivity after preeclampsia in healthy women and rat. METHODS: Human: eighteen healthy formerly pregnant women (fHP-women) and 18 healthy formerly early-onset preeclamptic women (fPE-women) were studied 1-10 years postpartum. After a week of standardized sodium diet (aim: 200mmol/24h), baseline blood pressure (BP) and BP-response to graded infusion of angII (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0ng/ kg/min for 1hour) were measured.

Further analysis revealed correlations between various key cytokines and circulating inflammatory markers and identified characteristic inflammatory patterns related to preeclampsia on heatmap cluster analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Mapping of the maternal inflammatory response postpartum reveals an underlying pro-inflammatory phenotype associated with previous preeclampsia. in HELLP rats (n=7; p=0.0004). Preproendothelin mRNA expression was significantly increased in placentas (p=0.02), livers (p=0.05) and the posterior cortex (p=0.03) from HELLP rats compared to NP rats. ET-1 secretion from endothelial cells (HUVEC) exposed to serum from women with HELLP was significantly increased (p=0.002) as was sVCAM (p=0.04). ET-1 secretion from HUVECs exposed to serum from HELLP rats (p=0.04) when compared to serum from NP women or rats. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that hypertension in both women and animals with HELLP is accompanied by activation of the ET-1 system. The increase in sVCAM coincides with the platelet dysfunction that occurs in HELLP syndrome. Future studies include examining placental ET-1 function in women with this devastating disease. Recently, podocyte injury and podocyte shedding has emerged as an important pathophysiological process of renal barrier dysfunction in preeclampsia (PE). In humans, loss of podocytes in glomerulosclerosis is a typical end-stage renal pathology. However, clinically renal barrier dysfunction is reversible in the majority of PE patients after delivery as evidenced by disappearance of proteinuria along with maternal blood pressure returning to normotensive levels. This phenomenon suggests that renal barrier must experience a unique recovery process after delivery. However, podocyte biology in PE is largely unknown. The purpose of the present study was to study the differentiation potential of shed podocytes from PE. METHODS: Shed podocytes were extracted from urine specimen from women with PE (n=8) and cultured up to 2 months in vitro. Presence or absence of Ki67 expression was used as marker of proliferation or differentiation. Expression and distribution of nephrin and podoplanin was used as markers of podocyte functional protein regeneration. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to examine ultrastructure of shed podocytes. In addition, expression of VEGF and CuZnSOD was also determined as functional recovery of differentiated podocytes.",

Shed podocytes exhibited cell-cell contact and foot processes were present in podocytes evaluated by TEM. VEGF and CuZnSOD expression were found to be co-localized with nephrin at the foot process area. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that shed podocytes from PE have the ability to differentiate into mature podocytes, suggesting that podocytes self-renewal may contribute to renal barrier functional recovery after delivery in PE. Currently, there is debate as to whether these sub-types refl ect the same pathophysiology, but with different severities, or different pathologies based on defective placentation and increased maternal susceptibility respectively. Here, we test between these possibilities by examining molecular markers of ER stress signalling pathways. METHODS: Placentas were collected from 24 PE pregnancies (26-38 wk) and 8 normotensive controls (39-40 wk), delivered by nonlaboured, caesarean section for clinical reasons. In addition, 7 ~18 wk, and 7 spontaneously delivered preterm control (~30 wk) placentas were obtained. All were collected with informed patient consent and local ethical approval. Levels and phosphorylation of proteins/kinases in ER stress, MAPK stress, and AKT survival/growth signalling pathways were analysed by Western blot, along with heat shock proteins. RESULTS: There were signifi cant negative correlations (p<0.05) between the ER stress markers P-eIF2a, ATF6, P-IRE1, XBP-1 & GRP78, and P-p38 and gestational age at delivery (Fig. A) , but not for other stress kinases/proteins.

METHODS: Ddx4-Cre mice were crossed with Rosa26 tomato/+ mice to drive tomato red expression in cells in which the Ddx4 promoter has been/ is activated. Ovaries were collected from recombined offspring at postnatal day 8 (PD8) and PD60. Each fraction of cells after crude dispersion of the ovaries (as per Liu and colleagues), or after dispersion coupled with an additional OSC purification step (Nature Protocols 2013 8:966-88) not performed by Liu and colleagues, was assessed by analysis of primitive germline markers and oocyte-specific markers. Additionally, colony formation and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays were performed to assess mitotic capacity of isolated germ cells. RESULTS: Crude dispersion generated cell fractions containing reporterpositive immature oocytes, which are incapable of proliferation and thus likely represent the mitotically inactive reporter-positive cells studied by Liu and colleagues. Dispersed ovaries further subjected to FACS, based on tomato red expression (reporter-positive) and externalized Ddx4 protein expression (ecDdx4-positive; characteristic of OSCs and not oocytes) revealed extensive 'leakiness' of the reporter in non-germline cells.However, a small fraction of reporter-positive cells were also positive for ecDdx4 expression. These cells expressed primitive germ cell markers but not oocyte markers, and could be established and expanded in culture, exactly as reported for adult mouse ovary-derived OSCs (Nature Protocols 2013 8:966-88). CONCLUSIONS: Crude dispersion of ovaries collected from Ddx4driven reporter mice alone (PNAS 2012 109:12580-5) is not a reliable approach to identify OSCs, whereas FACS-based sorting of the same ovarian dispersates generates purified fractions of OSCs that can be expanded ex vivo (Support: NIH R37-AG012279).",

L Pastore, 1 L Karns, 1 K Ventura, 1 M Clark. 2 1 OB/GYN, Univ of Virginia, USA; 2 School of Nursing, Univ of Virginia, USA. INTRODUCTION: 6.7 million women in the US have impaired fecundity. About 10% of infertile/subfertile women are diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), of which < 5% will become pregnant spontaneously. This diagnosis is generally a surprise to women because they have regular menses. We examined interview data from women diagnosed with DOR and their husbands regarding their experience with the medical system, primarily in terms of delay in referral to a specialist. METHODS: Seven women with DOR (subset of participants of a genetic testing study, ages 30-41 at diagnosis) from the US and the male partners of six of these women were separately interviewed about the experience of being given this diagnosis. The interviews followed phenomenologic theory. DOR was defined as elevated FSH and/or low AMH and/or low antral follicle count, with regular menses, and age < 42 years. RESULTS: Women commented that multiple primary care providers were seen before an REI referral. Husbands expressed frustration about the time spent prior to an infertility diagnosis, despite annual check-ups.Husbands talked about having asked their primary doctors over time about the lack of conception before a referral was made. Some men were accepting and others frustrated about the changing scientific knowledge over time, while the wives only expressed frustration. CONCLUSIONS: \"Lost time\" was a recurrent theme in these couples. These interviews add depth to existing knowledge about medical system delays for fertility treatment, and are enriched by the inclusion of the husband's experience. INTRODUCTION: Establishment of endometrial receptivity is vital for successful embryo implantation. Endometrial receptivity is marked by dramatic changes in the luminal epithelium and the stroma. Protein convertase 5/6 (PC6) is up-regulated in the human endometrium specifically at the time of epithelial receptivity. PC6 is a serine protease of the PC family that plays an important role in converting precursor proteins into their active forms by specific cleavage. Platelet derived growth factor A (PDGFA) requires PC cleavage for activation and the active form is secreted as a dimer (~30kDa). PDGFA is necessary for blood vessel development and actin cytoskeleton organisation; it is also involved in the communication between the mother and embryo. This study identified an important role of PC6 in cleaving PDGFA during endometrial receptivity. METHODS: PC6 was specifically knocked down in an endometrial epithelial cell line, HEC1A, by stable transfection with siRNA specific to human PC6 (PC6-siRNA) or scrambled sequence (control). PC6-siRNA cells are significantly less receptive than control. Western blot analysis with antibodies specific to the active and precursor of PDGFA examined the regulation of PDGFA by PC6. Immunohistochemical analysis determined the localisation of active PDGFA in the endometrium of non-receptive and receptive phases. PDGFAA ELISA detected PDGFAA levels in the uterine fluid. RESULTS: Western blot analysis showed an accumulation of the PDGFA precursor but a reduction of the active form in PC6-siRNA cells than control. Immunohistochemical analysis showed different localisation of PDGFA in the human endometrium in different phases. During the nonreceptive phase, PDGFA was localised to the basement of the glandular and luminal epithelium. In the receptive phase, PDGFA was present in the apical surface of the luminal and glandular epithelium. Active PDGFAA was elevated in the uterine fluid during receptivity.",

INTRODUCTION: Progesterone (P) is known to induce insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) production and decidualization in the primate endometrium. Here we provide evidence that IGFBP-1 is also strongly upregulated in the endometrium following induction of menstruation by P withdrawal in artificially cycling macaques and in the premenstrual/menstrual stage human endometrium. METHODS: Artificial cycles were induced in ovariectomized rhesus macaques by sequential treatment with subcutaneous implants of estradiol (E) for 14 days and E plus P for 14 days. P was then withdrawn to induce menstruation. Uteri (n=3) were obtained after 24-36 hrs (premenstrual), 2-3 days (menstrual), 5-6 days (early-proliferative) and 14 days (lateproliferative) after P withdrawal. In another set of animals, P was added after 14 days of E and tissue was sampled 7 (mid-secretory) and 14 (latesecretory) days later. Human endometrial samples were obtained from proliferative, mid-secretory, and premenstrual/menstrual phases of the cycle. In situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed in full-thickness endometrial sections to evaluate IGFBP-1 mRNA and protein localization, and IHC for CD45 was performed for identification of leukocytes. RESULTS: IGFBP-1 signals were not detectable by ISH or IHC in the proliferative and secretory phase endometrium in macaques. However, there was a dramatic increase in both mRNA and protein levels in the pre/ menstrual phase endometrium following P withdrawal. The signals were primarily evident in the stromal cells of the upper endometrial zones in a gradient, with highest expression in cells closest to the luminal epithelium.",

Furthermore, the results of this study and findings in earlier work, suggest that the influx of leukocytes into the secretory phase endometrium -induced by P withdrawal or other mechanisms, such as blastocyst implantation -and the resulting inflammatory signals produced by these cells may serve as the key stimuli for IGFBP-1 production and induction of decidualization.",

The cohort was stratified based on age (\u226435, 35<x\u226438, 38<x\u226440, >40), and then further stratified based on the number of CGG repeats (<29, 29/30, >30). Based on previous studies, repeats of 29 and 30 were considered a normal repeat pattern. AMH values of patients with repeats less than 29 and greater than 30 were tested for clinical significance compared to the normal repeat range. This was done for allele 1, allele 2, and the average of both alleles. RESULTS: Allele 1 and allele 2 repeats less than 29 in the 35<x\u226438 age group yielded higher AMH levels than the normal repeat pattern (p=.05 and p=.02, respectively). Allele 2 repeats greater than 30 demonstrated lower AMH levels in the age group of 38<x\u226440 (p=.01).

In addition, other organs of the female reproductive tract and major non-reproductive organs were collected for mRNA isolation and qPCR analysis. The expression of vasodilatory genes associated with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was also evaluated. Human endometrial stromal cells were induced to undergo decidualization in vitro. RESULTS: Mrgprg expression was restricted to the gravid endometrium and could not be detected in any of the other reproductive or nonreproductive organs tested. Within the uterus, Mrgprg expression remained spatially confined to the stromal compartment and temporally restricted to early gestation. Further, Mrgprg was up-regulated in response to the implanting embryo. Components of the RAS were also shown to be expressed at the maternal-embryo interface. Presumably through paracrine secretions, the embryo initiated a 6.4-and 7-fold increase in the expression of renin and Mrgprg, respectively, based on microarray analysis. Prolyl-endopeptidase was abundantly expressed in the decidualizing endometrium, but was not regulated by the embryo. In vitro decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells resulted in upregulation of MRGPRF, the most closely related member of the human MRG superfamily to murine Mrgprg. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the restricted expression pattern of Mrgprg to the gravid decidualizing stromal compartment, we propose that this gene is functionally important for early pregnancy. Given that other members of the MRG family are known to play a role in vasodilation, it is hypothesized that MRGPRG mediates the provasodilatory actions of ANG-(1-7). That human MRGPRF was found to be regulated during in vitro decidualization suggests that this presumptive provasodilatory pathway may also function in humans. Ongoing studies in our laboratory are centered on evaluating MRGPRG protein expression and establishing a functional role for Mrgprg during early gestation. Supported by NIH ES012070 and OD010488. , an inhibitor of fatty acid (FA) beta-oxidation, and Glucosamine (GlcN), an inhibitor of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and in turn glucose utilization, have been shown to inhibit decidualization and subsequent embryo implantation.Simultaneous intrauterine delivery of RAN and GlcN followed by optic artery dye injection to stain the implantation sites confi rms this effect. METHODS: On day 1.5 of gestation, 33 ng RAN and 250 ng GlcN were injected into one uterine fat pad of pregnant female ICR mice 8-9 weeks. One uterine fat pad of control mice was injected with 5 uL of ethanol.On day 5.5 of gestation, the optic artery was injected with 100 uL 1% Evans blue dye in order to stain the implantation sites.Mice were then sacrifi ced and the uteri were dissected out.Number of implantation sites were noted in both the control and experimental horns. RESULTS: Blue dye staining of embryo implantation sites demonstrated signifi cantly fewer numbers when the uterine fat pad was injected with RAN and GlcN-number of implantation sites ranged from 3-4, compared to 7-9 in the non-injected horn.Control mice showed a similar number of implantation sites in the horn injected with ethanol when compared to the non-injected horn.",

Many of the signaling molecules involved in the dialog between the oocyte and the somatic compartment of the ovarian follicle belong to the transforming growth factor-b (TGFb) superfamily.

We used isolated intact rat follicle cultures to further demonstrate that the LH-induced elevation of Vasn is sensitive to EGFR and MEK1 inhibitors, suggesting a mediatory role of these signaling molecules in its regulation.Finally, preliminary results also indicate down regulation of Vasn mRNA in aged mice ovaries (10 months old).

In detail we aim to assess if LDA administration could improve ovarian response, reducing the gonadotropin administration, and if its administration could increase the number of follicles greater than 16mm at pick-up, the number and quality of oocytes retrieved, the number and quality of embryos, the chance to achieve a pregnancy and to carry it on. RESULTS: 106 LDA-treated patients (Group-A) and 100 not-treated ones (Group-B) were homogeneous for age and BMI. The Group-A, respect Group-B, showed higher gonadotropin request, higher number of ovarian follicles at pick-up, more follicles bigger than 16 mm in diameter and higher number of oocytes retrieved (despite higher number of immature and at germinal vesicle stage oocytes) but lower quality of obtained embryos. The comparison between 2 Groups in term of oocytes retrieved/ number of follicles, mature oocytes/retrieved oocytes, fertilized oocytes/ mature oocytes and good embryos quality/mature oocytes showed a ratio strongly advantageous for Group-B. For every considered outcome, we found a dose-related effect. CONCLUSIONS: It is mandatory to define what patients could benefit of LDA administration and the adequate timing to administer it since the empirical administration could negatively affect both the oocytes and embryos quality during IVF cycles. Advanced maternal age is consistently associated with increased risk of congenital heart disease even after excluding cases of chromosomal abnormality. We observed a similar risk in an Nkx2-5 +/mouse model of congenital heart disease. Surprisingly, the biological basis of the risk resides with the mother rather than the oocyte. To characterize the mechanism, we explore here the genetic basis of the maternal age effect.

Influenza infection in pregnancy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and risk of prematurity. Immunization during pregnancy reduces the likelihood of prematurity. We aimed to characterize T-cell functional and phenotypic changes in response to vaccination in pregnancy. METHODS: Healthy pregnant patients (n=15) and non-pregnant controls (n=14) were recruited prior to influenza vaccination. PBMC were isolated before, 1 month, and 2 months after vaccination. ELISpot assays for IL-10, IL-4, IFN-g and Granzyme-B were undertaken to determine functional responses to influenza A and other common recall antigens. Flow cytometry was performed for T-cell, NK cell and DC surface phenotype. Statistical analysis used Graphpad 5.0; significance defined as p<0.05. RESULTS: T-cell maturation in pregnant patients post vaccination show a shift towards greater central memory (CD4: p=0.0043, CD8: p=0.0022), reduced na\u00efve (CD4: p=0.0015, CD8: p=0.0050) and terminally differentiated effector memory CD8 (p=0.0026) subtypes. Activation marker expression (CD38, HLA-DR) was unchanged. Mean fluorescence intensity of PD-L1 on CD4 (p=0.0043) and CD8 (p=0.0247) T-cells were reduced. CD95 expression on CD8 T-cells was increased (p=0.0367). Treg (CD4+CD45RO+CD25+CD127low) proportions were unchanged, but their expression of CCR5 reduced (p=0.0411) and HLA-g increased (p=0.0043). CD4 TCRgD proportions and PIBF (progesterone induced blocking factor) expression were unchanged but CD8 TCRgD percentage showed an increasing trend. Proportions of tolerant DC (CD3-CD19-CD11c+HLA-DR+CD14+CD16+CD123+ILT4+CD83+HLA-g+) were reduced (p=0.0012). No changes were seen in NK proportions or PIBF expression. Proportions of T-helper subtypes (Th1, Th2 and Th17) were unchanged. Functional ELISpot data showed longitudinal increases in IFN production in response to EBV (p=0.0238), influenza A (Flu, p=0.0008) and tetanus toxoid (TTOX, p=0.0078), IL-10 production in response to CMV (p=0.0070), flu (p=0.0277), HSV (p=0.0146), purified protein derivative (p=0.0129) and TTOX (p=0.0445). IL-4 showed no changes but granzyme production increased with TTOX stimulation (p=0.0454). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination in pregnancy is associated with increased antigen responsive memory subtypes with concurrent reductions and alteration of tolerant cell types and inhibitory receptor expression. IFN and IL-10 responses are enhanced without an altered T-helper dominance. Progesterone induced decidualization is accompanied by marked morphological and biochemical changes in the endometrium including edema, and increased vascular permeability. Decidualization is also associated with enhanced human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) expression of tissue factor, the primary initiator of hemostasis by thrombin generation, and dramatic changes in the HESC extracellular matrix (ECM). Thus, we analyzed ECM protein expression in the secretome of cultured HESCs treated with ovarian steroids \u00b1 thrombin by Mass Spectrometry analysis (MSA). METHODS: HESCs were treated with thrombin alone or with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), a mixed glucocorticoid-progestin agonist, Etonogestrel (ETO), a predominately progestin agonist, or the pure progestin agonist, Organon 2058. Cell lysates were collected in Trizol for microarray analysis and supernatants processed for MSA by trypsin treatment. Peptides in the secretome are analyzed using a hybrid Orbitrap Elite ETD mass spectrometer. Peptide counts are determined using the Mass Matrix search engine. RESULTS: More than 300 proteins/sample were identified by MSA. Statistical analysis of peptide counts, which are proportional to protein expression, revealed numerous proteins that were either over-or underexpressed following thrombin treatment (p<0.05). Scrutiny of thrombin up-regulated proteins demonstrated a preponderance of ECM proteins (n=19, p<0.05) in the HESC thrombin treated secretome. In addition, 12 unique collagen isotypes were minimally affected by thrombin treatment p>0.05). Comparison of mRNA expression from microarray data of thrombin treated HESCs demonstrated a high correlation with proteomic data. Unlike the marked response to thrombin, incubation with the specific progestins exerted only minimal effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal that thrombin exerts striking effects on HESC ECM composition. Previously, we showed that at the maternal-fetal interface, DCs are the highest expressors of thrombin generating TF. Thus, thrombin regulated ECM expression may mediate decidual matrix remodeling and affect decidual trophoblast invasion and/ or play a role in post-menstrual repair of the endometrium. (LD) have been identified in the ovary and may serve as reservoirs of cholesterol for estradiol (E2) production during folliculogenesis. Perilipin 2 (Plin2), a LD-associated protein that moderates cellular lipid metabolism and storage, is reported to be expressed in mouse granulosa cells (GC) and oocytes. Our objectives were to evaluate the utilization of LDs in the follicle, E2 levels, and alternate Plin presence in Plin2-null mice during induced folliculogenesis.",

(3)The status of acetylation of histone-H3 lysine-27 (H3K27ac) and trimethylation of lysine-4 (H3K4me3), which are active chromatin markers, and trimethylation of lysine-27 (H3K27me3), which is a repressive chromatin marker were examined in the C/EBP b binding sites of the promoter or enhancer regions by ChIP assay. The effect of C/EBP b knockdown on the H3K27ac status of the C/EBP b binding sites was examined. RESULTS: (1) cAMP increased mRNA expressions of IGFBP-1, PRL and Mn-SOD, and the stimulatory effects of cAMP were inhibited by C/ EBP b knockdown. Basal Mn-SOD expression in non-decidualized ESC was also decreased by C/EBP b knockdown.(2) cAMP increased the C/ EBP b binding to the promoter or enhancer regions. In non-decidualized ESC, the C/EBP b binding activities in the Mn-SOD enhancer region were higher than those in the IGFBP-1 and PRL promoter region.(3)In non-decidualized ESC, the Mn-SOD enhancer region showed the higher levels of H3K27ac and H3K4me3 and lower levels H3K27me3 than those in IGFBP-1 and PRL promoter region. The H3K27ac level of the IGFBP-1 and PRL promoter regions was increased by cAMP and this effect was abolished by C/EBP b knockdown.CONCLUSIONS: IGFBP-1, PRL and Mn-SOD expressions were upregulated by cAMP through the recruitment of C/EBP b to the binding sites of the promoters. High H3K27ac levels of the C/EBP b binding site of the Mn-SOD enhancer in the absence of cAMP make the promoter accessible to C/EBP b to keep basal Mn-SOD expression.

INTRODUCTION: Macrophages in the uterus are implicated in mediating the maternal immune response, secretion of cytokines and in promoting angiogenesis. Our goal was to characterize expression of VEGFR-1 on macrophages and endothelial cells of the peri-implantation uterus and determine if VEGFR-1 function is required for macrophage recruitment, decidual angiogenesis, and/or the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. METHODS: VEGFR-1 expression on CD31 + endothelial cells (EC) and F4/80 + macrophages in the peri-implantation uterus was characterized with immunohistochemistry. Intraperitoneal injections of VEGFR-1 blocking antibody (AF471, R&D Systems) were administered every 3 days to adult CD1 female mice. After 6 doses, females were mated and a final dose of AF471 was given by embryonic day (E) 3.5. Macrophages and EC were quantified at E7.5. Pregnancy was analyzed at E7.5 and E10.5. RESULTS: Macrophages are observed throughout the stroma and are abundant adjacent to the lumen and glands prior to implantation. VEGFR-1 is not expressed on macrophages, but is expressed on adjacent stromal EC (Fig. 1A) . EC are abundant in the peri-implantation uterus and VEGFR-1 is expressed on EC in the primary decidual zone at E6.5 (Fig. 1B, D) .Macrophages are scattered throughout the decidua and are found adjacent to cells expressing VEGFR-1 (Fig. 1C) .",

The proliferative potential and differentiation W5C5+ cells were assessed by colony forming unit CFU assays and differentiation-induction media culture. EMSC surface markers were determined using flow cytometry. RESULTS: In post-MP+E 2 Passage 1 (P1) stromal cultures, 3.7\u00b11.8% (n=7) of the cells were W5C5+ cells and 7.7\u00b16.3% (n=8) in post-MP cultures (p=0.69). The cloning efficiency for post-MP+E 2 W5C5+ P1 cells was 3.41\u00b12.71% (n=6), and comparable to post-MP W5C5+ cells (3.73\u00b11.19%; n=8) but statistically lower than P1 Pre-MP cells (p>0.05) (n=6). W5C5, CD140b, CD146, CD29, CD44, CD73, CD105 surface markers were present in both PostMP groups. PostMP W5C5+ cells differentiated into chondrocytes, adipocytes, myocytes and osteocytes, but to a lesser degree than PreMP W5C5+ cells. CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal endometria possess eMSC at similar frequency and potency irrespective of whether or not it is regenerated with estrogen. Human endometrium is a promising source of MSC independent of a woman's age or menopausal status.",

INTRODUCTION: Several cumulus cell transcripts have been identified as potential non-invasive biomarkers of human embryo development and implantation. Embryonic poly(A) binding protein (EPAB) is expressed exclusively in Xenopus, mouse, and human oocytes and early embryos, and is required for translational activation of maternally-derived transcripts and oocyte maturation. Importantly, although EPAB is not expressed in cumulus cells, cumulus expansion and ovulation are also impaired in Epab -/mice. We therefore asked whether the oocyte-specific EPAB is required for the optimal expression of cumulus cell biomarkers of embryo viability. METHODS: Epab knockout mice (Epab -/-) were generated by targeted deletion of Epab exon 2. Cumulus cells were collected from Epab -/and Epab +/+ mice 4 hours after hCG injection and three pooled samples were generated for each group. Microarrays were performed for each of the six samples using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array platform. Probe level expression values were extracted and background adjustment, inter-array quantile normalization and probe set summarization were performed according to the Robust Multi-Chip Average algorithm. Genes that have been previously associated with human embryo viability and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome have been identified by analysis of previously published microarray data. RESULTS: 663 genes were up-regulated and 1205 genes were downregulated in Epab -/mice. The expression levels of 47 target genes that were previously identified as potential biomarkers of human embryo viability were cross-analyzed in Epab-driven mouse cumulus microarrays. Among those, 13 were found to be differentially expressed in Epab -/mice, and confirmed by qRT-PCR. These transcripts were previously shown to be associated with oocyte maturation (HAS2, PTGS2), fertilization (HAS2, GREM1, PTGS2, PTX3), early cleavage (HSPB1, TNFAIP6, CCND2), blastocyst development (PTGS2, SDC4), pregnancy (HIST1H4C, CAMK1D, SDC4), and live birth (PTGS2, CAMK1D). CONCLUSIONS: Cumulus cell transcripts identified as biomarkers of human oocyte and embryo viability demonstrated altered expression in Epab-deficient female mice, where diverse regulations remain to be further investigated. HLA-G expressed on trophoblast cells favours protolerogenic interactions with maternal leucocytes. We recently described that also maternal HLA-G + T lymphocytes and CD14 + CD16 + monocytes express HLA-G in the early decidua of physiological pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to investigate their role in first trimester spontaneous miscarriage. METHODS: Decidual tissue was obtained from 27 women affected by first trimester spontaneous miscarriage, and processed within 2 hours after collection. Leucocytes were separated by density gradient centrifugation and stained with the following human monoclonal antibodies: CD45, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD16, CD56, CD1c, BDCA-1, CD83, DC-SIGN, CD11c, HLA-G, ILT4. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results were compared with those obtained from n=10 patients undergoing elective termination of pregnancy. RESULTS: Compared to normally progressing pregnancies, the decidua of spontaneous abortions included a higher proportion of HLA-G + CD8 + T cells (13.94 \u00b1 2.5% vs 5.90 \u00b1 1.4%, p<0.05) and the MFI of both HLA-G and its ligand ILT-4 were increased on CD14 + CD16 + monocytes (1692 \u00b1 188 vs 882 \u00b1 129, p<0.001 and 1672 \u00b1 176 vs 528 \u00b1 58, p<0.001 respectively). Women with a pathological obstetric history (one previous abortion) showed both reduced HLA-G and ILT4 expression on CD14 + CD16 + monocytes (1110 \u00b1 326 vs 1938 \u00b1 206, p<0.05, and 924 \u00b1 361 vs 1960 \u00b1 660 respectively, p<0.001) . No correlation between HLA-G expression and fetal aneuploidy was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal CD8 + T lymphocytes and CD14 + CD16 + monocytes over-express the regulatory molecule HLA-G during spontaneous first-trimester miscarriage, irrespective of fetal chromosomal content. These data hint for HLA-G up-regulation as a response to the onset of a pathological environment at the fetal-maternal interface. A pathological obstetric history was related to reduced expression of HLA-G + in the decidua, with possible implications for exogenous modulation of HLA-G expression in the treatment of early reproductive failures. The parallel ongoing analysis of specific HLA-G haplotypes will be correlated with the expression of decidual HLA-G + cells. There is a lack of targeted therapies. Incretin hormone glucagon like peptide-1(GLP-1) is useful in glucose homeostasis in Type 2 diabetes mellitus and also on cardiac function. GLP-1 levels are low in the later phase of OGTT in PCOS. Hence we hypothesized that a GLP-1 agonist would improve both cardiovascular and metabolic phenotypes in PCOS. To test this hypothesis we used an established rat model of PCOS. METHODS: A 7.5 mg (90 day release) dihydrotestosterone (DHT) pellet was implanted in 4 week old rats (n=8). Studies also were conducted on littermate matched controls with no DHT implant (n=6). Vaginal cytology was performed. Rats were weighed weekly and OGTT (n=4 per group) at 12 weeks and 24 weeks done. Radiotelemeters were inserted at 12 weeks. A subgroup of the rats (n=4) received a 0.2 mg/kg dose ofliraglutide (GLP-1 R agonist). Cardiac echo were conducted. RESULTS: The DHT treated rats had irregular cycles compared to control rats. There was a significant increase in weight in the DHT treated group at 16 weeks (273.25 grams+/-9 vs 245.25 grams +/-5.3; p-value= 0.02). This weight increase was prevented by liraglutide treatment in the DHT group (264 g +/-10) (compared to control p>0.05).The mean arterial pressures (103 mmHg liraglutide: 101 mmHg DHT vs 104 mmHg control) between the groups were not statistically significant. There was improvement in glucose excursion during OGTT in the liraglutide treated DHT rats (30 min 103 mg/dl +/-10 vs 134 mg/dl +/-11 p-value 0.04, 120 minutes 69 mg/dl +/-5 vs 101 mg/dl +/-9; p-value 0.02 post glucose load). There was increase in left ventricular internal diameter in diastole in the DHT treated rats over control (7.96 +/-vs 6.74+/-p-value 0.04), which was not reversed by Liraglutide. CONCLUSIONS: DHT induced PCOS rats were significantly heavier then control rats and this was prevented in the liraglutide treated DHT group. Liraglutide also improved glucose tolerance. However we were unable to replicate the changes in blood pressure reported by others using the DHT model, so were unable to establish a cardiovascular protective effect of GLP-1 agonism in experimental PCOS. We did see cardiac changes in the DHT model of PCOS that were not reversed by Liraglutide.",

To confirm fidelity of the reporter, we also evaluated transgenic mice engineered to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of the Stra8 promoter (pStra8-Gfp mice). Ovaries were collected from adult (2-3 months of age) pStra8-Gfp mice, and subjected to FACS for purification of GFP-positive cells. Adult female Stra8-R26R mice were treated with Dox for 21 days, housed with wild-type male mice in mating trials, and all offspring generated were assessed for YFP expression. RESULTS: GFP-positive cells purified from ovaries of pStra8-Gfp mice expressed primitive germline markers and endogenous Stra8, but no oocyte markers, confirming specificity of the promoter. Ovaries collected from adult female Stra8-R26R mice after 21 days of Dox induction possessed a 'chimeric' pool of follicles composed of both YFP-positive and YFP-negative oocytes enclosed in resting and growing CONCLUSIONS: Myeloid cells may contribute to maternal immune alterations during early pregnancy and placental development. Reductions in the myeloid population in allogeneic pregnancies suggest that a \"foreign\" fetus may trigger immunosuppressive cascades to support fetal tolerance. Thus, understanding myeloid cell maturation and differentiation in blood and the placenta may help elucidate the mechanism underlying pregnancy disorders, such as preeclampsia and preterm birth.",
