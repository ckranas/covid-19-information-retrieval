The immune system was presumably evolved by animals during evolution as a means of self-preservation in a world teeming with microorganisms.

Thus we could say that allergic diseases have plagued mankind since the beginning of life on earth. The prophet Job was affected by a condition that following the rare symptoms described by the Holy Bible might be identified as a severe form of atopic dermatitis (AD). The earliest record of an apparently allergic reaction is 2621 B.C., when death from stinging insects was first described by hieroglyphics carved into the walls of the tomb of Pharaoh Menes depicting his death following the sting of a wasp. In 79 a.d., the death of the Roman admiral Pliny the Elder was ascribed to the SO 2 -rich gases emanating from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Hippocrates (460-377 b.c.) was probably the first to describe how cow's milk (CM) could cause gastric upset and hives, proposing dietetic measures including both treatment and prevention for CM allergy. He also coined the term \"asqma,\" meaning breathlessness. Subsequently, Thucydides described that during the plague afflicting Athens from 430 to 429 b.c., \"those people who recovered from the disease rarely developed the illness a second time and never mortally,\" an observation that was verified by Panum in 1847 [407] . The Roman poet Lucretius (98-55 b.c.) stated that \"what is food to one, is a bitter poison to others.\" Galen was the first to describe allergy to goat's milk and also evidenced the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation, that is the loss of function or functio laesa not previously described by Celsus (first century b.c.). Perhaps an example of tolerance could be that of Mithridates (132-63 b.c.) , who reportedly acquired immunity against poisons by assuming progressively increasing doses of each poison, a precursor of the oral desensitization by taking small incremental amounts of noxious foods. The concept of immunity, deriving from the Latin immunitas (meaning being exempt from), a century ago was linked by early immunologists to the resistance of an individual to infections; therefore immunology probably began its march as acquired immunity [33] . The concepts of immunology have a long history and began primarily as a branch of microbiology. Fracastoro wrote in De conta-Immunology called cytokines, adhesion molecules, chemokines, and the like. Related cells and cell products are consequently a defense system designed to interact with foreign agents to protect the host from any external injury [34] . \u2211 Immunity is the complex of cellular and/or humoral events following the entry of foreign substances (nonself) into the host. These events are overall free of adverse effects for the majority of subjects, therefore defined as normal. \u2211 Immunology is the study of the ways used by the host to maintain homeostasis in the internal environment when confronted with non-self. \u2211 Allergy currently implies all forms of hypersensitivity with detrimental consequences for the host and type I, IgE-mediated or cell-mediated reactions. \u2211 Atopy is a term underlining the personal or familial hereditary aspects of allergic reactions and is associated usually in childhood or adolescence with increased production of IgE antibodies and/or altered specific reactivity in response to ongoing exposures to allergens, usually proteins.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 878, "end": 892, "text": "(460-377 b.c.)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1388, "text": "[407]", "ref_id": "BIBREF407"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1428, "text": "(98-55 b.c.)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1773, "end": 1786, "text": "(132-63 b.c.)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2248, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2603, "end": 2607, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Historical Milestones"}, {"text": "A thoroughly functioning immune system serves three main functions: (a) defense against invasion of microorganisms and foreign substances, ingested, inhaled or achieved by mucosal contact, or by parenteral injection; (b) homeostasis fulfilling universal requirements of multicellular organisms to preserve uniformity of a given cell type, as well removing worn-out \"self \" components; and (c) surveillance devoted to perception and destruction of mutant cells [33] . Therefore, inability to relate to unum is intrinsic to atopic diseases that depend on hyperproduction of IgE antibodies being IgE-mediated. This is a genetic characteristic, although the mode of transmission is still a matter of debate, and the fact of being atopic does not result automatically in the development of clinical manifestations.Atopy is also polymorphous, manifesting in various forms, starting out as AD or food allergy (FA), to further develop into allergic rhinitis (AR) and/or asthma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 460, "end": 464, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Historical Milestones"}, {"text": "According to the classic theory of clonal selection (Chap. 2), the crucial function of the immune system from the first days of life is to distinguish self from nonself, for example, between what belongs to or is closely correlated to the organism (tolerance to self antigens) and what is foreign, with the goal of eliminating the latter, independent of its potential pathogenicity. This is the quintessential dichotomy of immunology: the self versus non-self discrimination. We shall see in Chap. 2 that theories regarding self/non-self are still valid (as long as they are not interpreted literally), with the exception of some recent studies that have clarified how the so-called neonatal window period represents an ontogenetic window only as far as tolerance induction is concerned [60] . Immunity is acquired at the first contact with non-self (antigen recognition), it is specific for a given foreign substance and acquired, since it is able to respond to molecules not encountered before. Following an initial antigen stimulus, finally familiar with self and non-self, a series of reactions results, sometimes as if it were reacting to invaders. In virtue of such events, the integrity of the organism, which becomes protected from successive entries of potentially pathogenic substances, is maintained. This is put into practice by the immune memory enabling the immune system to memorize previous exposures to a particular antigen, in a way analogous to natural memory that recalls past experiences. Amongst all defense mechanisms put into action by the host against any external aggressor, we find a network of organs, tissues, cells and molecules responsible for immunity: the integrated immune system [36] . The interconnected and coordinated responses following the entry of foreign substances are globally known as immune reactions. Relatively small modifications in the delicate and complex molecular and cellular structures of the immune system may cause a functional disequilibrium that is responsible for a cascade of organic perturbations that may become evident alterations, such as atopic diseases varying in nature and severity and primary immune deficiency (PID) [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 787, "end": 791, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1714, "end": 1718, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2191, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Historical Milestones"}, {"text": "Ideally, the immune reactions determine schematically ordered responses articulated on six levels: processing, presentation and recognition of non-self, cellular activation, elaboration of biologically active chemical substances, mediators, and cellular cooperation. The final outcome of the encounter between host and a foreign invader is now recognized as dependent upon an integrated network of multidirectional communication pathways and signaling, where the mechanisms of memory, effector responses and consequent regulation of secretory proteins and soluble molecules such as the interleukins (ILs) are clarified [34] . Antigen contact starts to form those elements necessary for its recognition, including the cells emitting signals, ILs transducing such signals and target cells receiving them by binding to appropriate receptors; following transduction and amplification of signaling, a detectable physiological response occurs [34] . Thus, immune responses usually culminate in the elimination of provoking agents. The specificity of antigen recognition, as defined in molecular terms, is entrusted to three structures: the variable (V) region of Igs (immunoglobulins), MHC (major histocompatibility complex) V regions and TcR (T-cell receptor) chains.

This specific immunity is transferable by lymphoid cells and not by serum, where T lymphocytes play a fundamental role [481] . every living organism, present at birth, that is, before exposure to foreign agents and consisting of several nonspecific factors. Innate responses occur to the same extent as the infectious agent is encountered. Not significantly modified after an encounter with non-self substances, it is void of both a fine-tuned discrimination of such substances and an increased activity following repeated encounters, thereby demonstrating that it does not possess memory. The phagocyte cells (macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes) and alternative complement pathway, although void of specificity, are essential as primary elements of defense against a large number of infectious agents. \u2211 Acquired immunity, also called adaptive immunity, becomes involved when the first level of defense fails to fully prevent infection, exemplifying a recent evolutive process, distinct by a particular specificity for offending antigens and by memory. Unlike innate immunity, it is elicited or stimulated by exposures to intruders that escaped early elimination by the innate immune system, insofar as it is armed with a versatile discriminating capacity and potentiated by a successive encounter with such agents. Table 1 .1 [114, 184] shows the major differences between these two types of immunity: the effector mechanisms of innate immunity are activated immediately after infection and rapidly control the replication of infecting pathogens, so the infection is restrained until lymphocytes can accomplish their action. It takes 3-5 days for a sufficient number of clones to be produced and differentiated into effector cells, which allows time for pathogens to damage the host [353] . The greatest difference is that acquired immunity, to compete with genetic variability of microorganisms, has lost the cardinal characteristic seen in innate immunity, that is, the ability to distinguish between potential pathogens and harmless substances. However, innate immunity may have an additional role in determining which anti-Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) is a typical CMI reaction [33] , first discovered by Jenner [237] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 426, "end": 431, "text": "[481]", "ref_id": "BIBREF480"}, {"start": 1639, "end": 1644, "text": "[114,", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 1645, "end": 1649, "text": "184]", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 2096, "end": 2101, "text": "[353]", "ref_id": "BIBREF353"}, {"start": 2502, "end": 2506, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2536, "end": 2541, "text": "[237]", "ref_id": "BIBREF218"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1628, "end": 1635, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Acquired Immunity"}, {"text": "Several organs and tissues participate in the host defense and are classified into [33, 36, 47] : \u2211 Primary lymphoid organs (forming the central lymphoid organs) where both T and B lymphocytes mature into antigen-recognizing cells and developing lymphocytes acquire antigen specific receptors. These cells develop from pluripotent stem cells (SC) in bone marrow and only during fetal life in the liver and then circulate throughout the extracellular fluid. B cells reach maturity within the bone marrow, but T cells must travel to the thymus to complete their development. An important and key role in homing-related responses and in the regulation of cell trafficking of stem/progenitor cells (SPC) is played by SDF-1 (stromal cell derived factor-1) bound to G-protein-coupled CXCR4 (chemokine recep-tor4). Supernatants of leukapheresis products activate SDF-dependent actin polymerization and significantly enhance the homing of human cord blood (CB) and bone marrow-derived CD34 cells in a NOD (nucleotidebinding oligomerization domain)/SCID mouse (severe combined immunodeficiency (ID). CXCR4 plays a critical role in the trafficing of other tissue/organ specific SPCs expressing CXCR4 on their surface, such as during embryo/organogenesis and tissue/organ regeneration [277, 654] . They are represented in mammals by the thymus, bone marrow and only during fetal life by the liver. \u2211 Secondary lymphoid organs (forming the peripheral lymphoid organs) including lymph nodes, spleen, tonsils and linings of the digestive, respiratory and genitourinary tracts, skin, conjunctiva and salivary glands. These organs of different size, disseminated throughout the organism, build structures where antigen-driven proliferation and differentiation occur and lymphocytes circulate and recirculate. There T cells interact with foreign configurations by cytotoxicity or releasing nonspecific mediators, with the non-complementary help of ILs, and store, amplify, and disseminate information about macromolecules encountered in various parts of the body [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 83, "end": 87, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 88, "end": 91, "text": "36,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 92, "end": 95, "text": "47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1279, "text": "[277,", "ref_id": "BIBREF277"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1284, "text": "654]", "ref_id": "BIBREF653"}, {"start": 2046, "end": 2050, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Organs and Cells of the Immune System"}, {"text": "The primary lymphoid organs include the thymus and the bone marrow.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Organs and Cells of the Immune System"}, {"text": "The thymus is a lymphoepithelial organ located in the anterosuperior region of mediastinum deriving from the endoderm of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. In the 6th week of fetal life, primitive mesenchymal and neural crest cells seed epithelial structures. Remarkably, parathyroids develop about the same time as the same pouches. During fetal development, the thymus size increases, then reaches its greatest relative weight shortly after birth, and its greatest absolute weight at puberty when contrary to other lymphoid organs, it progressively involutes and is replaced by adipose tissue. However, even if lymphocyte numbers pro-gressively decrease, they do not disappear altogether. Apparently, a few fragments are adequate to ensure a compatible T cellularity in peripheral lymphoid tissues. By 8 weeks of gestation, CD7 + hematopoietic SCs migrate from the yolk sac and fetal liver and later from the bone marrow via the bloodstream and enter the thymus through the epithelial cell linings of the cortex. The hematopoietic SC activity is regulated by C/EBPa (CCAAT-enhancer binding protein a) [679] . It has not yet been clarified whether these traveling stem cells are already committed to differentiate along the T-cell (T = thymus-derived) lineage or become committed only after entering the thymus and what excites them to such a gland. It has been hypothesized that these precursors may express certain as yet unidentified surface markers that selectively bind to their corresponding ligands on the thymic vascular endothelial cells. For this reason, the thymus is the central organ where the precursors, bone marrow-derived prothymocytes, undergo intense proliferation and differentiation, as well as do macrophages, epithelial and dendritic cells (DCs) [454] . The gland consists of two lobes surrounded by a thin capsule of connective tissue extending into the lobe, thus forming septa, partially dividing parenchyma into lobules ( Fig. 1.1, a) [454] . The peripheral zone of each lobule forms the cortex with immature proliferating cells. The cortex is further subdivided into a superficial and a deeper zone, with a more central area forming the medulla containing more mature cells and Hassall's corpuscles, an aggregate of epithelial cells. While the thymus has a cortex and a medulla, there is no germinal center (GC), or plasma cells, as in normal situations [33] . The thymus, independent of antigen stimulation, may be viewed as a lymphoid organ controlling all peripheral lymphoid organs, by means of expanding immunocompetence of the lymphocytes associated with CMI. The thymus exercises its function in time by secreting several soluble hormones (thymosin, thymopoietin, etc.): in fact, epithelial thymic cells secrete a series of polypeptides (thymic hormones and ILs), contributing to the maturation of T lymphocytes, with which they can interact directly, influencing their differentiation [33] . During fetal cell development, the requirement for STAT5 (signal transducers and activators of transcriptions) in thymopoiesis is developmental stage specific. STAT5 is required for IL 7 R-regulated TCR gene transcription, but it is not necessarily essential for TCR gene rearrangement, denoting that factors other than STAT5 activated by the IL 7 R-JAK pathway control TCR locus accessibility to VDJ recombinase [246] . One of the major roles of STAT3 in the G-CSF signaling pathway is to augment the function of C/EBPa (CCAAT enhancer binding protein-a), which is essential for myeloid differentiation. Moreover, co-operation of C/EBPa with other STAT3-activated proteins is required for the induction of some G-CSF responsive genes [386] . The close connection between epithelial cells and lymphocytes is confirmed by the presence of large epithelial cells (nurse cells) in the superficial cortex, each containing 20-30 blasts in division. Prothymocytes (pro-T) express CD2 and CD7, immature T cells of the cortex, smaller (pre-T), such as CD1 and once migrated into the medulla, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD38 and CD71 (transferrin receptor) present not only on T cells, but also on cells of other lineages undergoing proliferation. A low number of CD4 + 8 + (DP, double positive) T cells located in the medulla learn how to discriminate self from non-self in a process known as education; they interact with stem cells expressing MHC molecules, then CD4 -8 -(DN, double negative) T cells acquire a CD4 + 8or CD4 -8 + (MP, mono-positive) phenotype. Targeted mutations of CD80 and CD86 substantially reduce the proliferation and survival of DN T cells in the thymus, since the DN development in the thymus is subject to modulation by the CD80-CD28 costimulatory pathway [682] . The earliest immune maturation of any lymphocyte compartment in humans is represented by ab and gd TcR and most likely reflects the importance of these cells in controlling pathology due to common environmental challenges. A significant difference between the gd and ab T cell lineages is the much earlier activation and conversion to memory of the gd T cells, which illustrates the central role that gd T cells have in adressing Ag challenge from birth onward. gd T cells are distinguished by expression of Vd1 vs Vd2 d-chains. The majority of Vd2 cells display signs of early activation in neonates. Even in infants <1 year most of Vd2 nonnaive cells stain for perforin and produce IFN-g after short-term stimulation, yet nearly all naive Vd2 cells disappear from blood by 1 year of life.Vd1 cells predominate during fetal and early life, but represent the minority of gd cells in healthy adolescents [111] . As regards TcR, only cells with an abTcR-CD4/CD8 coreceptor combination that is able to bind the same MHC class I or class II molecules will fully mature. Cells with a mismatched combination will die [263] . Positive selection is conditioned by activation of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascade, although it does not involve CD4 -8 -(DN) T cells [10] . Most lymphocytes not surviving the thymic selection process die by apoptosis (from \"apwptosis,\" cellular suicide): they are engulfed and digested by macrophages of the corticomedullary junction within 3-4 days of their last cell division [192] (Fig. 1.1 b) . In the deep cortex, T cells interact with macrophages, FCDs and epithelial cells, which during a differentiation process modify expression of cytokeratins such as skin keratinocytes; medullary T cells are found in Hassall's corpuscles [225] . Several immune deficiencies are characterized by selective deficiency of T cells [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1109, "end": 1114, "text": "[679]", "ref_id": "BIBREF690"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1119, "text": "It", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1781, "text": "[454]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1974, "text": "[454]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2389, "end": 2393, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2928, "end": 2932, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3348, "end": 3353, "text": "[246]", "ref_id": "BIBREF246"}, {"start": 3670, "end": 3675, "text": "[386]", "ref_id": "BIBREF367"}, {"start": 4697, "end": 4702, "text": "[682]", "ref_id": "BIBREF670"}, {"start": 5608, "end": 5613, "text": "[111]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 5816, "end": 5821, "text": "[263]", "ref_id": "BIBREF263"}, {"start": 5978, "end": 5982, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 6223, "end": 6228, "text": "[192]", "ref_id": "BIBREF192"}, {"start": 6479, "end": 6484, "text": "[225]", "ref_id": "BIBREF206"}, {"start": 6568, "end": 6572, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1956, "end": 1968, "text": "Fig. 1.1, a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 6229, "end": 6241, "text": "(Fig. 1.1 b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Organs and Cells of the Immune System"}, {"text": "The bone marrow is a structure present in man and in higher mammals considered to be a primary lymphoid organ functionally equivalent to avian bursa.

This zone contains lymphoid cells aggregating in lymphoid follicles or lymph nodules, and in periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS), which are similar to the cortex of lymph nodes. The pulp surrounding periarteriolar sheaths is called the marginal zone. In the peripheral area, cortical lymphocytes aggregate into follicles (as can be found in all peripheral lymphoid organs), distinguished into two types, primary and secondary follicles, also designated as GCs (see also \"B Lymphocytes\"). GCs also contain B cells and macrophages; B cells can also be found in red pulp, which is formed by venous sinuses, reticular fibers (Billroth's cords) and vessels [454] .

There are two major sets of lymphocytes. The antibodies produced by B lymphocytes play a crucial role in interacting with extracellular antigens, when found outside the cell (for example, when viruses are encountered in the blood), whereas these antibodies are ineffective against endocellular antigens, because overall they are unable to penetrate the cells. Accordingly, T lymphocytes are probably originally derived to ensure a high specificity in the critical phase of immune responses to pathogens of various sources. Antigen recognition takes place in a different way for each phenotype, since T cells respond to antigens only when encountered inside or on the target cell surface, thereby showing that T-cell antigen recognition is fundamentally different from B-cell antigen recognition.

Zola pers. com., March 5, 2005) . Abbreviations are in the list. whose deficiency is responsible for one form of SCID; affected patients are unable to produce functional lymphocytes bearing antigen receptors [508] . The next cells in the B-cell lineage bearing monomeric surface IgM (IgMs or mm) are referred to as immature B cells. In the following stages of maturation, a mature B cell expresses IgM, IgD, and Fc receptors (FcR) for IgGs. Up to this point, all maturative steps take place in the bone marrow and are antigen-independent (Chap. 2). It has been suggested that bursal epithelial cells might produce polypeptides, triggering maturation of lymphoid stem cells into immunocompetent B cells, similarly to what occurs in the thymus. These short-lived lymphocytes colonize typical zones of lymph nodes and the spleen. Each cellular clone synthesized in a GC produces isotypes of the same class, specific for a given antigen. During the evolution of immune responses, there is a switch in Ig classes from IgM to IgG, IgA and IgE. If IgG and IgA antibodies are produced last, this could account for an associated defect of the two Ig classes. Babies with Xlinked Hyper-IgM Syndrome (HIgMS) have little or no IgG and IgA [96, 544] . The Igs are structurally similar. A typical antibody molecule has a Y-shaped configuration when viewed schematically ( Fig. 1.6 ) and consists of a basic unit of four polypeptide chains, two identical L and two identical H (heavy) held together by interchain -S-S bonds also present on single chains and by hydrogen bonds. As the figure shows, NH 2 and COOH indicate amino and carboxy terminals, respectively. L chains are common to the diverse Igs, which instead differ from their H chains that determine class type, hence IgA H chains are a, those of IgG are g, etc. Each L chain is made up of two domains: a V region that varies from antibody to antibody and a constant (C) region, essentially identical among L chains of a given type ( Fig. 1.7) . For this reason, the molecules are practically identical, except in amino-terminal domains where variability differentiating V domains of both L and H chains is most pronounced [18] . In man, C regions are encoded by one of four C H genes for H chains and by one of two C L genes for L chains (Ll and Lk). H chains therefore consist of four C and one V domains and L chains of one C and one V region. Both chains, organized in sequence, are distinguished by their succession of amino acids: L chains consist of 211-217 amino acids and H chains of 450 for g and a chains, and of 614 for m and e chains [3] . One noteworthy characterization of Igs lies in their bifunctional aspects, in that they bind antigens and, in addition, elicit biological processes that are independent of antibody specificity. Each of these functions is localized to a different part of protein: C domains have various effector activities (complement activation, opsonization, etc.) via IgG, IgE and IgG 4 FcRs, while V do- Fig. 1.6 .

This machinery, known as gene rearrangement, necessary for transcription of gene information (mRNA synthesis) is employed only for genes dictating Ig L and H chains or TcR. After genes are transcribed into RNA, introns are removed from transcripts and exons are joined together by RNA splicing. As will be seen later, this rearrangement is the core of the capability shown by the immune system to recognize an incredible variety of antigen structures in nature [18] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 444, "end": 449, "text": "[691]", "ref_id": "BIBREF679"}, {"start": 459, "end": 462, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 463, "end": 465, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 466, "end": 469, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 470, "end": 473, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 474, "end": 477, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 478, "end": 481, "text": "47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 482, "end": 485, "text": "70,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 486, "end": 489, "text": "82,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 490, "end": 493, "text": "85,", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 494, "end": 498, "text": "102,", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 499, "end": 503, "text": "103,", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 504, "end": 508, "text": "109,", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 509, "end": 513, "text": "112,", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 514, "end": 518, "text": "120,", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 519, "end": 523, "text": "132,", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 524, "end": 528, "text": "147,", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 529, "end": 533, "text": "158,", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 534, "end": 538, "text": "175,", "ref_id": "BIBREF174"}, {"start": 539, "end": 543, "text": "242,", "ref_id": "BIBREF223"}, {"start": 544, "end": 548, "text": "262,", "ref_id": "BIBREF262"}, {"start": 549, "end": 553, "text": "343,", "ref_id": "BIBREF343"}, {"start": 554, "end": 558, "text": "407,", "ref_id": "BIBREF407"}, {"start": 559, "end": 563, "text": "428,", "ref_id": "BIBREF427"}, {"start": 564, "end": 568, "text": "437,", "ref_id": "BIBREF436"}, {"start": 569, "end": 573, "text": "442,", "ref_id": "BIBREF464"}, {"start": 574, "end": 578, "text": "484,", "ref_id": "BIBREF483"}, {"start": 579, "end": 583, "text": "501,", "ref_id": "BIBREF500"}, {"start": 584, "end": 588, "text": "515,", "ref_id": "BIBREF514"}, {"start": 589, "end": 593, "text": "559,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 594, "end": 598, "text": "571,", "ref_id": "BIBREF570"}, {"start": 599, "end": 603, "text": "584,", "ref_id": "BIBREF583"}, {"start": 604, "end": 608, "text": "608,", "ref_id": "BIBREF626"}, {"start": 609, "end": 613, "text": "688,", "ref_id": "BIBREF676"}, {"start": 614, "end": 618, "text": "691]", "ref_id": "BIBREF679"}, {"start": 708, "end": 722, "text": "March 5, 2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 899, "end": 904, "text": "[508]", "ref_id": "BIBREF507"}, {"start": 1918, "end": 1922, "text": "[96,", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 1923, "end": 1927, "text": "544]", "ref_id": "BIBREF523"}, {"start": 2859, "end": 2863, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3283, "end": 3286, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 4354, "end": 4357, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 4985, "end": 4989, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2049, "end": 2057, "text": "Fig. 1.6", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 2670, "end": 2679, "text": "Fig. 1.7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 3680, "end": 3688, "text": "Fig. 1.6", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "B Lymphocytes"}, {"text": "Antibody molecules are encoded by three independent groups of genes.

V regions within any group are not uniformly variable across their whole 110 amino acid span. Instead, the greatest amount of variability of V domains of each chain (genes V H and V L ) is concentrated in three regions of both L and H chains called hypervariable regions: the less variable stretches interspersed within these hypervariable regions are called framework regions (FR) of 15-30 amino acids. The six hypervariable regions, which are each 9-12 amino acids long, participate in antigen binding and form a region that is complementary in structure to antigen epitopes, accordingly designated complementarity determining regions (CDRs) principally involved in antigen contact, three in V H domains and three in V L domains [86] .

Eventually, exons coding for V domains may be broken down in still smaller segments, each lacking some features needed for proper RNA splicing and unable to function separately [470] .

H chains are dictated by V H , J H , D H (diversity) and C H exons; the D exon, absent in L chains, dictates a few amino acids and is in charge of the Cells of the Immune System The hypervariable regions  that form the antibody combining site  or paratope correspond to the loops  around positions 26, 53 and 96 tion sites of receptors expressed on B and T lymphocytes are generated during early development via somatic assembly of component gene segments [128] . During maturation of B and T lymphocytes, the first rearrangement involves H locus with the juxtaposition of D and J genes (DJ rearrangement) by the deletion of intervening DNA. This rearrangement occurs in a very early stage of maturation, when precursors are not yet clearly committed to B lineage; indeed it is also observed in 20% of T cells [474] . The second rearrangement involves subsequent translocation of DJ segments to selected V region genes (VDJ rearrangement) ( Fig. 1.9 ), which occurs in pre-B cells, already committed to B lymphocyte family. As a consequence, the VDJ segment joins the C H gene [591] . However, recombination can be somewhat imprecise, since during this process several nucleotides may be removed from or added to a junction, so combination of VDJ segments of H chains results in a large number (10 D H \u00a5 4 J H \u00a5 200 V H ) of possible sequences (that is, antibodies). This reshuffling process, known as combinatorial joining, is the prevalent source of protein diversity. For example, when organizing k genes, as there is only one Ck exon, all k proteins must have identical C domain sequences, while cells can choose among several Vk and Jk segments, with the result of joining such segments in diverse combinations. Thus, a large number of different V region sequences can result and when combined with 50 k chain V domains could form 400,000 different V H genes. Considering a necessary heterogeneity of gene segments and combining 400,000 with 200 V k and four J k genes (200\u00a54) \u00a5 10 equal to flexibility of VJ rearrangement, we have at least 3\u00a510 8 different antigenbinding sites. Such an outstanding recombinant capacity is further increased by somatic mutations to 10 10 -10 15 [18] . Nonetheless, even using a relatively small amount of gene segments, the immune system can secrete an impressive antibody diversity through combinatorial joining [414] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 658, "end": 663, "text": "[470]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 942, "end": 947, "text": "[414]", "ref_id": "BIBREF414"}, {"start": 1406, "end": 1411, "text": "[128]", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1765, "text": "[474]", "ref_id": "BIBREF454"}, {"start": 2027, "end": 2032, "text": "[591]", "ref_id": "BIBREF590"}, {"start": 3134, "end": 3138, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3302, "end": 3307, "text": "[414]", "ref_id": "BIBREF414"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1128, "end": 1261, "text": "The hypervariable regions  that form the antibody combining site  or paratope correspond to the loops  around positions 26, 53 and 96", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1891, "end": 1899, "text": "Fig. 1.9", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Genetic Rearrangements for Ig Synthesis"}, {"text": "In the most common scenario, a VDJ segment joins first with C m genes, and subsequently with C g , C e , C a genes, with synthesis of a complete H IgM chain, etc. Without an associated L chain, surface expression is not possible and only cytoplasmic m is found (pre-B cells). Isotype switching requires DNA rearrangements. Consequently, a single V gene is associated in successive phases with different C genes on the same chromosome, thereby allowing each cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes with the same paratope. Several components that are involved in this process have been identified. Among them, a complex system of enzymes and other proteins jointly known as recombinase activity appear to be necessary for gene rearrangements. Thus the enzyme VDJ recombinase catalyzes recombination processes, during which intervening DNA is usually excised. However, since similar sequences are found also nonproductive k rearrangement.

Another very important mechanism generating variations is somatic mutations, which are able to introduce a heterogeneity even higher in nucleotide sequences. Insertions of such nucleotides are carried out by the enzyme terminal-deoxynucleotidyl-transferase (TdT), a terminal-independent DNA polymerase expressed in B lymphocytes early during their development, but also in thymocytes of all species. The variations in gene sequences resulting from imprecise joining or from insertion of N regions, via addition of nucleotide sequences, absent in germline, provide a supplemental diversity at VDJ junctions designated \"N-region diversity.\" Moreover, these processes affect sequences within each VDJ exon coding for CDR3 of L-or H-chain V domain. Hence, TdT can be viewed as another component of the VDJ recombinase system [263] .

In this way, the VDJ complex becomes joined to C region genes of other isotypes located downstream on the same chromosome.

Another major function of CD4 and CD8 is to act as signal transducers in T cells due to their intracellular portions linked to specific kinases; thus CD4 and CD8 are phosphorylated following antigen binding to TcR [36] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 307, "end": 311, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 795, "end": 800, "text": "[414]", "ref_id": "BIBREF414"}, {"start": 1019, "end": 1023, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1146, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1416, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1643, "end": 1648, "text": "[481]", "ref_id": "BIBREF480"}, {"start": 2030, "end": 2034, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "T Lymphocytes"}, {"text": "Unlike B cells, T cells can interact with antigens directly, even in solution.

Th0 cells represent a heterogeneous population of effector cells, mostly naive lymphocytes that in the absence of signals clearly driving differentiation into Th1/Th2 T cells have never before been activated and thus have not acquired the ability to secrete a mature profile of ILs, modulating their effects with respect to fetal liver. Unlike B cells, maturation does not occur in situ, but from bone marrow-derived progenitors undergoing maturation in the thymus, where the greater part of cells multiply and differentiate into immunocompetent lymphocytes. In the thymus, functionally competent cells are exported into peripheral lymphoid compartments in accordance either with thymus ability to produce different soluble factors or with particular intercellular interactions. Early in development, thymocytes express several cell surface molecules, including CD2 and CD7 (CD7 deficiency is described in Chap. 22 ), but lack both DN CD4/CD8 and CD3. Precisely in the thymus, via a series of intermediate steps, DN cells change into DP CD4 + 8 + thymocytes. As thymocytes mature into T cells, they express increasing levels of TcR, finally turning into CD4 + 8and CD4 -8 + , becoming MP. Therefore, during early stages of thymus phases, thymocytes express indifferently both CD4 and CD8; the association of either subset with TcR will show whether cells recognize MHC class I or II molecules, thus regulating subsequent differentiations [255] . IKK (inhibitor of kB kinase)-induced NF-kB (nuclear factor kB) activation, mediated by either IKK1 or IKK2, is a pivoral factor for the generation and survival of mature T cells, and IKK2 has a crucial role in regulatory and memory T cell development [503] .

The molecules expressed on lymphocyte membranes, characterizing diverse phases of the differentiation process of T subsets, allow their identification and are overall assayed by means of lymphocyte differentiation antigens designated with CD terminology (CD1-CD342) defining cellular antigens. Such markers also distinguish nonhematopoietic cells involved in both innate and acquired immunity, permitting their recognition via analysis of cell surface molecules expressed on lymphocytes during stages of cell development and/or activation. CDs constitute a group still under definition and classification [470, 501] and recently revisited [4, 262, 343, 604] .

Briefly, a hybridoma can readily be formed by fusing a single normal B jects [278] . A specific factor triggering differentiation into Th1 lymphocytes has been identified in IL 12 , which in a dose-dependent manner increases IFN-g levels in TcR of antigen-specific T cells while antagonizing an IL 4 -induced B-cell switch to IgE production. It also appears that IFN-g IL 12 -mediated production is necessary to stimulate complete expression of Th1 phenotype [105] . For the outcome of CD4 T cell differentiation, the balance between T-bet (TFs T-box expressed in T cells) and GATA-3 is critical [665] . However, T-bet initiates Th1 lineage development from naive Thp (Th precursors) cells, both by activating Th1 genetic programs and by repressing the opposing Th2 programs [556] . CD4 T cells coming from thymus, although they can differentiate either into Th1 or Th2 T cells, are not predestined to IL production [644] : the current theory is that only at the moment of antigen presentation do uncommitted cells begin to secrete ILs, with polarization of immune processes into a model of type I or IV reactions [290] . As yet, it is not clear how CD4 T cells distinguish the antigens they encounter, because there is no proof that such antigens are endowed with specific structural features allowing CD4 to recognize them [469] . Since T-cell antigen specificity is prearranged in the thymus apparently at random, it is challenging to imagine how CD4 cells on the point of recognizing a given antigen can be programmed at this stage of development, so that they can express a defined set of ILs at the subsequent encounter. To undo the Gordian knot, the present dogma is that in any inflammatory site both Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes differentiate from common post-thymic antigen-specific ThP, while an intermediate point between ThP from one side and Th1/Th2 T cells from the other is represented by Th0 [473] . Hitherto, cell surface marker analysis for Th1-Th2 T-cell subset identification has yielded unconvincing results. Recent studies show that Th1-Th2 T cells differentiate in conformity with CD30 expression, with CD27, CD40, CD95/Fas, OX40 and other molecules belonging to the receptor superfamily of TNF/NGF (TNF-R = CD120a, CD120b and NGF-R), with low or hardly noticeable levels of Th1 and high levels of Th2 cells (and of CD8) [388] . CD30 is therefore viewed as a specific marker and if stimulated as a cofactor of T lymphocyte differentiation, preferentially toward the Th2 T-cell phenotype, which expresses CD30 on its membrane [113] . An interesting observation is that a biologically significant number of CD30 markers are present in the bloodstream of patients allergic to grasses (and not in controls) in concomitance with pollination periods [113] . A soluble CD30 (sCD30) (88 kD) is increased in serum of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) seropositive patients [4] . Recent data show that the LAG-3 molecule (lymphocyte activation gene-3), an IgSF member binding to the nonpolymorphic part of HLA class II molecules, is selectively transcribed into activated Th1 and NK cells, since its expression is correlated with IFN-g production by Th1 cells and not with that of IL 4 [457] .

Th1 cells secrete IFN-g but do not secrete IL 4 , whereas Th2 cells secrete IL 4 but not IFN-g. T cells secreting neither IFN-g nor IL 4 are neither Th1 nor Th2 cells [470] . A subset of CD4 + T-cell lines, which secrete TGF-b but not IL 4 or IFN-g, has been termed a Th3 cell [470] . In addition to Smad-2/4 of TGF-bRI, there is Smad-7 which blocks activated receptors and interferes with phosphorylation of both Smad-2 and Smad-3 (G. Monteleone, pers. comm. 15. 2. 2005) [156] . An IL 10 -producing subset has been termed Tr1 (T-regulatory 1) [470] . Another family, that of T-cell Ig domain and mucin domain (TIM) proteins, is identified to be expressed on T cells [320] . The quantitative difference of ILs synthesized by T cells is remarkable, as demonstrated either by production of high levels of IL 4 and IL 5 by Th2 T cells (GATA-3 is critical for expression of the IL 5 gene in Th2 cells) [678] , while that of IFN-g is significantly lower, or by nearly specular IL secretion by gd Th1 T cells [665] . Thus, either GATA-3 or single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL 18 gene might be relevant in inducing the very broad Th2 phenotype observed in atopic sub-Cells of the Immune System interest is the role of the STAT family of molecules, including SH2 and SH3 (src homology 2, 3) [248] , activated by an additional TF, PTK (protein tyrosine kinase) [224] . Two classes of SH2-containing inhibitory signaling effector molecules have been identified: the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and the inositol phosphatase SHIP (SH2-containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase) interacting with the immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motif (ITIM) [446] . STAT6, activated by IL 4 and IL 13 , plays a crucial function related to genes regulating differentiation into Th2 T cells [248, 523] , similarly to STAT4 phosphorylated by IL 12 for Th1 T cells [523] . Th2 T cells are thought to have a defect of STAT4 phosphorylation [401] . Thereby STAT4 and STAT6 appear to control Th1 T-cell differentiation [523] , while IL 2 and IL 15 activate phosphorylating STAT3 and STAT5, and IL 4 and IL 12 activate phosphorylating STAT3 [240] . CD 8 T cells. IL 7 and IL 15 are crucial for the development of CD8 -T cells within the thymus, and SOCS1 (supressor of cytokine signaling-1) regulates this process by regulating both ILs [441] . CD8 T cells are the main type of effector T lymphocytes, as suppressor and cytotoxic cells. In the first case, they bind one HLA class I/peptide molecule also contacting b 2 -microglobulin (b 2 -m).A flexible loop of the a3 HLA domain is clamped between the CDR-like loops of two CD8 subunits in the classic manner of an antibody-antigen interaction, precluding the binding of a second HLA molecule [170] . The binding of CD8 to HLA can prime CD8 T-cell precursors that depend on IL 2 (cytotoxic T-cell differentiation factor) (Table 1.5) produced by Th1 cells to be transformed into active cells [349] . CD8 T cells thus activated secrete soluble factors suppressing both Th1 and Th2 T cells, as well as growth of Th2 T cells enhanced by IL 4 , thereby down-regulating immune responses and inhibiting activation of B cells [255] . Consequently, eliminating CD8 T cells in immunized mice, the synthesis of IgE antibodies was amplified, whereas it was inhibited when CD8 T cells were deleted prior to treatment, suggesting that there are two different subsets of T suppressors, also because IL 4 inhibits CD8 T cells producing IL 2 and IL 6 and stimulates those secreting IL 4 and IL 5 [255] . CD8 T cells have two distinct patterns with different effects: type 1 of Th1 T cells (Tc1) and type 2 of Th2 T cells (Tc2) [456, 469] . CD8 Tc1 produces IFN-g, so the highest production of IL 4 is supported by CD8 absence and anti-IFN-g presence [349] and IL 4 may encourage Tc2 [470] . Animal data suggest that functionally distinct subsets of CD8 Tc2 T cells may play a significant role in IgE regulation [255, 349] ; also in humans, such CD8 trigger isotype switching of B cells to IgE antibodies [105] . In addition, virus-specific CD8 can eventually generate IL 5 with an implicit increase of eosinophilia in airways [100] , thus providing key elements to explain clinical links between viral infections and asthmatic exacerbations [105] .

There are additional NKRs specific for HLA class I antigens, also IgSF membrane proteins and encoded by genes in human chromosome 19q13.4 [91] , including the NKAT 1-4 (NK associated transcripts 1-4) family encoding transmembrane (TM) proteins with an extracellular region characterized by 2-3 IgSF domains and one cytoplasmic associated with ARAM (antigen recognition activation motif) [91] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 206, "end": 211, "text": "[460]", "ref_id": "BIBREF440"}, {"start": 471, "end": 476, "text": "[412]", "ref_id": "BIBREF412"}, {"start": 577, "end": 582, "text": "[193]", "ref_id": "BIBREF193"}, {"start": 603, "end": 608, "text": "[289]", "ref_id": "BIBREF308"}, {"start": 756, "end": 761, "text": "[313]", "ref_id": "BIBREF293"}, {"start": 913, "end": 918, "text": "[667]", "ref_id": "BIBREF666"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1047, "text": "[381]", "ref_id": "BIBREF399"}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1192, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1193, "end": 1197, "text": "667]", "ref_id": "BIBREF666"}, {"start": 1447, "end": 1450, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1455, "text": "381]", "ref_id": "BIBREF399"}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1574, "text": "[427]", "ref_id": "BIBREF426"}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1719, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 1964, "end": 1968, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "T Lymphocytes"}, {"text": "HLA class I molecules may deliver negative signals protecting from lysis cells attacked by NK cells, and may resume cytotoxicity if target cells have reduced class I expression or abnormal peptide-HLA complexes impair recognition [320] . Thereby, NK cells are subjected to a delicate balance between activatory and inhibitory signals: only upon HLA molecule loss or reduction in number is inhibition dampened and killing enhanced [443] . A system of recognition that is characteristic of NK cells relies on the NKARs and NKIRs of these cells. The NKARs recognize a number of different molecules present on the surface of all nucleated cells, whereas the NKIRs recognize MHC class I molecules, which are also usually present on all nucleated cells. If the NKARs are engaged, a \"kill\" instruction is issued to the NK cell, but this signal is normally abrogated by an inhibitory signal sent by the NKIR on recognition of MHC class I molecules [287, 365] . Even if several issues remain to be adequately explained, for example, regarding specific functions of receptors so far identified and distribution of their activities, it is likely that different receptors may be used depending on the NK-cell activation state, thus releasing a negative signal that recognizes polymorphic HLA class I determinants on potential targets [667] . NK cells and CTLs may regulate functions of each other, in addition to the role of NK cells in CTL differentiation [273] , but CTLs down-regulate NK-cell action expressing their inhibitor NKB1 [428] , also complemented by TcR-ab [273] . However, NK cells can express inhibitory receptors such as C-type lectins (CD94), while rodent NK cells may express those of IgSF [320] . together with HLA-restricted CTLs, naturally occurring NK cells lyse a variety of targets with no prior specific sensitization of the host (unlike T cells), regardless of HLA gene restrictions and of antibody or complement. NK cells are thus enabled, along with macrophages and leukocytes, to act as a first line of defense playing a critical role in natural resistance against a variety of infectious diseases [289] . NK cells and CTLs are mutually self-regulated: NK-cell limitation of viral replication is higher in the first 3 days, contrary to CD8 lymphocytes developing from their precursors within 5-6 days. Accordingly, there is a complementary balance between innate and acquired immunity, since NK-cell cytotoxicity is temporally accomplished and replaced by that of CD8 T cells [273] . NK cells share with cytolytic cells of lower vertebrates and invertebrates both killing activity and lack of TcR and memory, thus suggesting that they are innate and primitive components of the vertebrate immune system [193] . Identified in humans, several CDs possess Fc receptors (FcR) that bind IgG (FcgR) and are activated by membrane receptors such as CD2R, CD16 (FcgRIII), CD39, CD69, and NKRP-1 (natural killer receptor = CD161) and CD94, a product of a gene in human chromosome 12p12-p13, both members of C-type lectin superfamily [225, 320, 460, 470] . In addition to displaying cytotoxicity against autologous tumor cells, triggered by IFN-a, IL 2 , IL 12 and IL 15 , NK cells release GM-CSF, M-CSF, IFN-g, and TNF-a. Both activated IFN-g and TNF-a are important for immune resistance against pathogens and regulation of hemopoiesis and immune responses, and IFN-g also generated by other cells in response to microorganisms enhances NK cell cytolytic activity [25, 339, 460] . Increasing evidence shows that NK cells play a cardinal role in the control of microbial agents and with natural cytotoxicity of viral infections, also in absence of T and B cells, as in SCID mice [25, 130] . More precisely, the NK cell kills the abnormal target cell by inserting the pore-forming molecule perforin into the membrane of the target cell, and then injecting it with cytotoxic granzymes [115] . Furthermore, NK cells produce IL 2 , necessary for their proliferation, IL 12 [77] , IFN-g induced by IL 15 generated by activated human monocytes [68] , and VLA-4/ VLA-5 (very late antigens 4 and 5) (CD49d/CD29 and CD49e/CD29) mediating NK-cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN) [64] . IL 12 (NK cell stimulatory factor) primes in vitro Th1-specific immune responses and inhibits development of IL 4 -producing Th cells [339] . IL 2 increases expression of adhesion molecules on their cell membranes [193] . Lastly, the MCP chemokines (monocyte chemotactic protein) are NK-cell major attractants, also inducing their chemotaxis [317] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 230, "end": 235, "text": "[320]", "ref_id": "BIBREF300"}, {"start": 430, "end": 435, "text": "[443]", "ref_id": "BIBREF465"}, {"start": 940, "end": 945, "text": "[287,", "ref_id": "BIBREF306"}, {"start": 946, "end": 950, "text": "365]", "ref_id": "BIBREF383"}, {"start": 1322, "end": 1327, "text": "[667]", "ref_id": "BIBREF666"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1450, "text": "[273]", "ref_id": "BIBREF273"}, {"start": 1523, "end": 1528, "text": "[428]", "ref_id": "BIBREF427"}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1564, "text": "[273]", "ref_id": "BIBREF273"}, {"start": 1697, "end": 1702, "text": "[320]", "ref_id": "BIBREF300"}, {"start": 2116, "end": 2121, "text": "[289]", "ref_id": "BIBREF308"}, {"start": 2494, "end": 2499, "text": "[273]", "ref_id": "BIBREF273"}, {"start": 2721, "end": 2726, "text": "[193]", "ref_id": "BIBREF193"}, {"start": 3041, "end": 3046, "text": "[225,", "ref_id": "BIBREF206"}, {"start": 3047, "end": 3051, "text": "320,", "ref_id": "BIBREF300"}, {"start": 3052, "end": 3056, "text": "460,", "ref_id": "BIBREF440"}, {"start": 3057, "end": 3061, "text": "470]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3473, "end": 3477, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3478, "end": 3482, "text": "339,", "ref_id": "BIBREF339"}, {"start": 3483, "end": 3487, "text": "460]", "ref_id": "BIBREF440"}, {"start": 3687, "end": 3691, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3692, "end": 3696, "text": "130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 3891, "end": 3896, "text": "[115]", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 3977, "end": 3981, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 4046, "end": 4050, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 4174, "end": 4178, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 4315, "end": 4320, "text": "[339]", "ref_id": "BIBREF339"}, {"start": 4395, "end": 4400, "text": "[193]", "ref_id": "BIBREF193"}, {"start": 4523, "end": 4528, "text": "[317]", "ref_id": "BIBREF297"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "T Lymphocytes"}, {"text": "One of the more intriguing aspects of NK-cell function is its possible recognition of foreign substances as non-self, allowing their recognition system to discriminate between self and non-self, to start cytotoxic activities and to produce ILs [289] .

Stem cells, after reaching the thymus or bone marrow via the bloodstream and maturing into B or T cells, enter the systemic circulation, peripheral lymphoid organs, and MALT, never traveling in opposite directions. Both phenotypes migrate electively between corresponding thymus-dependent and thymus-independent areas. Memory T cells leave the bloodstream via peripheral efferent vessels, especially to inflamed sites, and subsequently enter regional afferent lymphatic channels that eventually direct cells to a draining regional lymph node, circulating by lymphatics or via cortical venules into lymph node parenchyme (hence the high percentage of memory T cells) [634] . In contrast, naive cells move across afferent postcapillary HEVs into lymph nodes, directly through the HEV barrier. HEVs originate from pre-existing capillary venules ( Fig. 1.3) , differentiating under the influence of IFN-g secreted by local Th1 T cells [226] . A particular feature of T lymphocytes is that they selectively bind to specific HEVs in lymphoid tissues and appear to completely ignore normal vascular endothelium, unlike in inflamed sites [226] . Moreover, between HEVs and distinct subsets of T cells there is a selective binding of finer specificity, further regulating lymphocyte homing into various lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues [522] . In lymph nodes, encounters take place between novel antigens coming from afferent draining tissues and virgin cells. Lymphocyte traffic is not a random mixing of cells in varying tissues of the body. Yet this distinctive migration is directed by lymphocyte cell surface molecules that are receptors for ligands expressed on endothelial structures on HEV cell membranes (homing receptors) (Figs. 1.5, 1.11) [62] . As a result of these interactions, T lymphocytes transmigrate into mucosal tissues with immune memory of antigen sensitization, hence regulating local immunity [326] . Leaving secondary lymphoid organs and entering efferent lymphatics, lymphocytes of either phenotype recirculate via mesenteric lymph nodes and return to the blood via the thoracic duct, emptying into the superior vena cava, and crossing HEV endothelial vascular linings; they are eventually exported back to mucosal sites as memory T cells via the subclavian veins [591] . It is believed that lymphocytes migrate nonrandomly to their home: for example, naive T cells expressing CD62E that binds HEV can also migrate into skin T cells, as well as memory T cells, if they are equipped with CLA (cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen), which binds to CD62E on endothelium of skin venules [634] . The contribution of adhesion molecules should be pointed out: for example, a E b 7 integrin is equal to CD103 inducible by TGF-b1 (transforming growth factor b1), binding to E cadherin directs T lymphocytes to the IEL (intraepithelial lymphocytes) group, >95% of which expresses it, thus mediating lymphocyte adhesion to mucosal epithelial cells [76] . These meaningful data provide an immune basis to analyze reactions triggered in distant target organs, so that lymphoid cells stimulated, for instance in GALT, migrate into the bloodstream and then to the gut lamina propria: this traffic is very important for maintaining the immune surveillance within the MALT system [326] . This also elucidates why some T lymphocytes appear to from PPs, have a preferential migration into the gut, mediated by b 7 integrins [615] , and to a lower extent into other sites, and likewise for other preferential localizations ( Fig. 1.12 ) [534] . Memory cells, once activated in specific tissues, depend on unending antigen stimulation and with remarkable selection home in to tissues related to initial exposure to foreign antigens [226] . The selective pattern of recirculation has a prerequisite of preventing inappropriate competitions between T and B cells and migrations into nonlymphoid organs [62] . Similar discrepancies involve specialized subsets making use of preferential routes, such as gd and IEL cells, which can migrate into skin and/or gut [62] . Studies have hypothesized that an important role may be entrusted to gut-derived IELs homing preferentially to mucosal lung tissue, also effective in preventing airway infections [454] . Because of lymphocyte circulation, B IgA cells of PPs following antigen sensitization home in to regional lymph nodes, where they differentiate, activate, and then return to colonize electively the lamina propria of various compartments [548] , including mammary glands, where they transform into IgA-se-patrol throughout the body (recirculation) and their traffic is greatly enhanced if an inflammatory response develops. The toxic action carried out by viruses can alter both homing and recirculation of T cells until inactivation, notably of lymphocytes specific for that particular virus (Chap. 22). The immunocompetent memory cells recirculate uninterruptedly, since encounters with particular antigens and triggering of immune reactions are facilitated on the one hand, and on the other localization of specific cells in elective areas is supported [634] .While naive cells recirculate almost exclusively via lymph nodes and other secondary lymphoid tissues, where priming may take place, traffic of memory and effector lymphocytes is also directed to nonlymphoid tissues, including gut lamina propria, lung tissues, as well as inflamed skin, and joints ( Fig. 1.11 ). More precisely, naive cells are excluded from effector mucosal sites because their HEVs lack MAdCAM-1, expressing inadequate levels of a 4 b 7 to bind it [62] . Sophisticated studies on animal models have observed that homing receptors direct traffic with a specific migratory behavior of the cells: those coming from GALT, for example, Cells of the Immune System Fig. 1.11 . Recirculation of lymphocytes: differential distribution of naive versus memory cells. Unlike naive cells, memory and effector T (and probably B) cells can efficiently extravasate in tertiary or extralymphoid tissues (see text). Antigen-activated B cells may home to specialized environments in the outer T zone during primary responses, or may colonize germinal center sites of hypermutation, affinity maturation, and memory cell differentiation. Less numerous, specialized lymphocyte subsets, such as gd T cells or IELs, may be targeted from their origin in the thymus or bone marrow directly to reproductive, cutaneous, intestinal, or other tertiary sites. Extralymphoid tissue sites of selective homing include skin, lung, intestinal lamina propria, and synovial tissues. Ag antigen, IEL intraepithelial lymphocytes, PALS periarteriolar lymphoid sheath. (Modified from [62]) creting plasma cells (enteromammary axis; Chap. 2). Analysis of B lymphocytes is limited: naive B cells are the great majority of cells recirculating between blood and lymphoid tissues [635] . As regards the volume of cell traffic, human circulating blood contains \u00aa10 10 lymphocytes, with a blood transit time of 25\u00b16 min, resulting in a 40-fold daily exchange (\u00aa5\u00a510 11 lymphocytes) [635] . In the human thoracic duct, there is a recirculation of only \u00aa3\u00a510 10 lymphocytes, that is about 6%-7% of the daily migration via peripheral lymphoid tissues: in rats the rate of naive and memory cells is nearly equivalent [636] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 749, "end": 754, "text": "[634]", "ref_id": "BIBREF614"}, {"start": 1014, "end": 1019, "text": "[226]", "ref_id": "BIBREF207"}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1218, "text": "[226]", "ref_id": "BIBREF207"}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1415, "text": "[522]", "ref_id": "BIBREF541"}, {"start": 1824, "end": 1828, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1991, "end": 1996, "text": "[326]", "ref_id": "BIBREF326"}, {"start": 2364, "end": 2369, "text": "[591]", "ref_id": "BIBREF590"}, {"start": 2686, "end": 2691, "text": "[634]", "ref_id": "BIBREF614"}, {"start": 3040, "end": 3044, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 3366, "end": 3371, "text": "[326]", "ref_id": "BIBREF326"}, {"start": 3508, "end": 3513, "text": "[615]", "ref_id": "BIBREF633"}, {"start": 3620, "end": 3625, "text": "[534]", "ref_id": "BIBREF553"}, {"start": 3814, "end": 3819, "text": "[226]", "ref_id": "BIBREF207"}, {"start": 3982, "end": 3986, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 4139, "end": 4143, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 4325, "end": 4330, "text": "[454]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4570, "end": 4575, "text": "[548]", "ref_id": "BIBREF527"}, {"start": 5188, "end": 5193, "text": "[634]", "ref_id": "BIBREF614"}, {"start": 5662, "end": 5666, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 6756, "end": 6761, "text": "[62])", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6947, "end": 6952, "text": "[635]", "ref_id": "BIBREF634"}, {"start": 7147, "end": 7152, "text": "[635]", "ref_id": "BIBREF634"}, {"start": 7378, "end": 7383, "text": "[636]", "ref_id": "BIBREF635"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 927, "end": 936, "text": "Fig. 1.3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 3608, "end": 3617, "text": "Fig. 1.12", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 5495, "end": 5504, "text": "Fig. 1.11", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 5872, "end": 5881, "text": "Fig. 1.11", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Lymphocyte Recirculation"}, {"text": "T and B lymphocytes can recognize an extremely wide range of disparate foreign antigens because of the high variability of their membrane receptors, stemming from the ability of developing cells to arrange and modify genes encoding antigen receptors, even if single B cells express only one type of specificity, and the same is probably also true for T cells [225] . There are \u00aa10 14 TcR and 10 18 BcR [353] (Fig. 1.13 ) playing a central role in antigen recognition and activation, with structures complementary to those of specific antigens; epitope recognition by receptors is a critical event triggering immune responses. In contrast, the human genome contains 75,000-100,000 genes, most of which have no role in immune recognition [353] . Molecules coded for by HLA molecules regulate B-and T-cell differentiation, because they are involved in the host's ability to set humoral or CMI responses. More prominently, HLA molecules are necessary to signaling and their intercellular interactions contribute to distinguishing between self and non-self [470] . Specificity dominates in the molecules induced in every individual in one or two versions, dictated by maternal and paternal genes, whereas TcR and BcR are produced in millions of copies that, although adhering to a common structural plan, are different in V domains [115] . If each lymphocyte bears receptors with a unique specificity, coordinately expressed by progenitor stem cells via processes of genetic recombination, there must necessarily exist a great variety calling on the immune system to recognize an extensive spectrum of antigens. Doubtless, clonal selection interferes to naturally eliminate receptors destined to die via PCD [276, 510] . Both TcR and BcR are able to recognize a given antigen due to their unique molecular structures, which are spatially and chemically complemen- ovum contain gene fragments that via subsequent phases of rearrangement, reorganize genome sequences so that new genes can be created in immune cells to continue the cycle [18] . The basic principles governing the genetic mechanism to create such a variety can be focused on DNA somatic rearrangement, versatile and casual, accompanied by deletion and an evolutionary mechanism with reference to active engagement and frequent combinations [185] . Antibodies and T-cell clones thus achieved are specific not only for antigens present now in the microenvironment, but are also able to develop different specificity to antigens not yet present, to be encountered in the future [326] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 359, "end": 364, "text": "[225]", "ref_id": "BIBREF206"}, {"start": 402, "end": 407, "text": "[353]", "ref_id": "BIBREF353"}, {"start": 736, "end": 741, "text": "[353]", "ref_id": "BIBREF353"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1057, "text": "[470]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1327, "end": 1332, "text": "[115]", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 1703, "end": 1708, "text": "[276,", "ref_id": "BIBREF276"}, {"start": 1709, "end": 1713, "text": "510]", "ref_id": "BIBREF509"}, {"start": 2031, "end": 2035, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2299, "end": 2304, "text": "[185]", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 2534, "end": 2539, "text": "[326]", "ref_id": "BIBREF326"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 408, "end": 418, "text": "(Fig. 1.13", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "T and B Cell Receptors"}, {"text": "While nearly all developing TcRab thymocytes express a single TcRb protein, many thymocytes rearrange and express two different TcRa chains and, thus, display two abTcRs on the cell surface.

The immature TcR consists of a b chain identical to that found in the mature TcR and a pre-T chain that contains only a C region. This segment is replaced by an a chain to form the mature TcR, and each chain consists of a V and a C region [115] . The PTK signaling and coreceptor involvement may be operating in normal thymocytes [284] .

CD3-TcR complex is the unity of mature T cells: TcR is able to recognize and discriminate among different foreign antigens, CD3 polypeptides have long intracytolastic tails necessary to TM transduction of activation signals [222] . Each TcR molecule is formed by two pairs of heterodimers, ab and gd, each a, b, g, and d chain containing a V domain and a C domain, and a CD3 complex by three distinct invariable chains known as g, d, e correlated between them. Antigen-specific T cells have a TcR similar to membrane Igs (mIg) of B cells. CD3-TcR complex is the unity of mature T cells: TcR is able to recognize and discriminate among different foreign antigens, CD3 polypeptides have long intracytoplasmic tails necessary to TM transduction of activation signals [225] . Each TcR molecule is tary to one another, fitting together in a \"lock-and-key\" relationship, thus giving the starting signal to cellular replication. The progeny of cells derived from any naive cell originate as a lymphocyte clone with cells morphologically identical to one another in nearly all respects, while each BcR or TcR expressed by cells of a given clone are also identical [185] . Lymphocytes, already triggered by binding to their specific antigens and activated, proliferate and deliver specific effector functions, thereby recognizing the intruder and successfully inactivating or eliminating it: evidence exists that cells with a specific receptor that fits better to binding sites may differentiate selectively, thereby predominating over other cells [47] . Receptor molecules mediating specific recognition have heterodimeric structures: L and H Ig polypeptides behave as BcR, while a and b chains are related to TcR. L, H, a and b chains possess V domains arranged in a specific spatial contour on available antigen surfaces and also C domains interacting with receptors on host tissues and transmitting signals to cell cytoplasm. Therefore, BcR and TcR genes share many features and both undergo similar DNA rearrangements [18] . In addition, genes coding for BcR and TcR use a unique strategy to achieve the degree of diversity required. The set of human BcR and TcR genes is complete for all the seven loci -the three Ig loci: IgH (after the H chain), IgK (after the k L chain) and IgL (after the l L chain); and the four TcR loci: TcRa/d on chromosome 14, TcRb (on chromosome 7, and TcRg on chromosome 7. The IgH cluster (431 human genes and 798 alleles) corresponds to 4 types of gene segments: V, D, J, and C. The Igk and Igl clusters lack D segments. All these segments contain multiple genes; in the IgH cluster, for example, there are \u00aa50 functional V segments. The TcR genes have a similar organization and in the 4 TcR loci there are 242 human genes and 443 allels [115, 183] . In contrast to the TcRb and TcRd loci, the TcRa and TcRg loci do not contain D segments. And, as in the case of Ig genes, each TcR locus contains multiple V, D, and J genes; on TcRa, for example, there are 70 to 80 V genes and \u00aa60 J genes [115] . To such genes is committed a molecular control to increase variability via somatic and evolutive processes, but inheritable chromosomes, as discussed earlier, contain no Ig genes at all: otherwise there would be several million of these genes. For example, spermatozoon and T and B Cell Receptors formed by two pairs of heterodimers, ab and gd, each a, b, g, and d chain containing a V domain and a C domain. CD3 complex by three distinct invariable chains known as g, d, e correlated between them. As in the antibody molecule, the V domains contain three CDRs, where the highest degree of amino acid variability is concentrated. The CDRs in the case of the ab TcR recognize a complex formed by a peptide seated within the groove of an MHC molecule [171] . Each TcR has a single extracellular Ig-like C domain, a TM segment, a cytoplasmic tail (44-81 amino acids in length), and is completed by z and/or h chains. zh chains also are invariable molecules, derived by conjunction of alternative transcripts of the same gene, and form homodimers linked by a -S-S (z-z and/or h-h) bond, or heterodimers (z-h), not covalently associated with five subunits (abgde) to form the heptameric complex. The human chain MWs are as follows: g 25-28 kD, d 21 kD, e 20 kD, z 16 kD and h 22 kD [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 283, "end": 288, "text": "[284]", "ref_id": "BIBREF284"}, {"start": 530, "end": 535, "text": "[115]", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 621, "end": 626, "text": "[284]", "ref_id": "BIBREF284"}, {"start": 972, "end": 977, "text": "[222]", "ref_id": "BIBREF242"}, {"start": 1512, "end": 1517, "text": "[225]", "ref_id": "BIBREF206"}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1909, "text": "[185]", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 2287, "end": 2291, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 2762, "end": 2766, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3514, "end": 3519, "text": "[115,", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 3520, "end": 3524, "text": "183]", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}, {"start": 3766, "end": 3771, "text": "[115]", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 4523, "end": 4528, "text": "[171]", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 5051, "end": 5054, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "T-Cell Antigen Receptors"}, {"text": "Two T structures recognize antigen peptides bound to HLA molecules: \u2211 In 90%-95% of T lymphocytes is found a TcR formed by two polypeptide chains a and b (ab) (MW of 45 and 40 kD) expressed on the cell membrane in the form of 90-kD heterodimers and linked by -S-S bonds, associated on the cell surface with CD3, a clonally invariable protein, and encoded by gene segments organized in a discontinuous way on chromosomes (V, D, J and C); hence gene rearrangements are necessary.

A remarkable degree of independence seems to dominate in the generation of ab and gd lineage cells from progenitor cells that, in theory, could simultaneously express a TCRgd and a pre-TCR [180] .

Therefore interactions between CD4 and CD8 and respective HLA class molecules increase efficiency of T-cell and APC interactions.

The immature pre-B cells (and pre-T cells) express preliminary versions of the antigen receptor. At this stage, the BcR comprises a pair of H chains, each with a V and a Cm region identical to those found in the mature receptor, and a pair of surrogate L chains, termed Vpre-B and g5. As the B cell develops, the surrogate L chains are replaced by conventional L chains, each with a V and a C region [115] . BcR consists of mIgs, more common proteins critical for antigen recognition, differing from antibodies only for an extra sequence of amino acids at C-terminal domains of H chains [214] . During embryonic and fetal life, mIgs of different isotypes alternate in B-cell populations; similarly, this occurs during clonal maturation in their adult life [3] . Igs of all classes can exist in either membrane-bound or secreted forms. Membrane forms combine with Ig L chains to make mIg; however, mIgs are retained in ER, unless associated with Iga and Igb [414] . B cells comprise: \u2211 Specific mIgs: IgM (5%-20%) and IgD (5%-10%) more frequently than IgG (1%-7%) and IgA (<5%) antibodies.

The much earlier activation and conversion to memory of the gd T cells is a significant differnce between the gd and ab T cell lineages, and illustrates the central role that gd T cells have in adressing Ag challenge from birth onward [111] , substituting for ab cells that are scarce in mice [587] , and protecting epithelia from damage caused by inflammations via selective suppression of IgE responses [279] . This effect is endorsed by normal levels of gd cells [80] : reduction to only 500 cells [350] or suppression of gd cells, as reported in atopic babies [495] , could imply an increase in IgE levels [80, 350, 495] . As gd TcRs develop normally in mice deficient in HLA class I and II molecules, these cells could be present in HLA defects.

The two polypeptide chains (similarly to Ig chains) are delineated by a C-terminal C region, the same for each TcR, and an N-terminal V region, different for each TcR. Such wide variability enables various TcR clones to recognize a practically infinite number of invaders [225] .

The nonreceptor PTK syk is widely expressed and has an important role in intracellular signal transduction in hemopoietic cells. It displays a leading role in BcR spectrum of activities, as demonstrated by BcR complete activation via PLCg1 (phospholipase Cg1) linking.

H chain regions corresponding with V H and C H 1 domains and whole L chains forming Fab ( Fig. 1.6 ) are closely located to form paratope walls. In conclusion, one H and one L chain together form a paratope, therefore a single four-chain unit is bivalent, since it contains two combining sites [469] . The paratope is positioned in the NH 2 -terminal Fab region, whose shape changes to recognize and ensure a close fit between antibodies and complementary epitopes [459] . A paratope is a molecule portion determining antibody specificity, making contact with an antigen-related part, a binding pocket allowing peptides to be accommodated, thus suggesting the picture of a key in a lock [1, 470] ( Fig. 1.16 ). Paratope specificity depends on amino acid sequences of hypervariable loops, an effect of minute variations of genes encoding for this antibody portion. Analyses of antibody terminal parts have demonstrated a three-dimensional flexibility of the paratope calling antigens for binding, with spatial conformational changes made on peptide binding, absent in unliganded Fabs. As Fig.1.17 illustrates, in liganded Fabs a prominent groove connected to a deep pocket is formed to fit peptides, adding a prominent channel to encompass extended portions of bound peptides [459] . Affinity between these two structures depends on the strength of attraction and repulsion existing between them. Mutation of an amino acid residue forming part of an epitope or paratope can greatly increase or weaken such affinity [459] . Structurally, there is also flexibility in epitopes, permitting antigens to interact with antibodies, thus widening the likelihood of antigen-antibody encounters of sufficient affinity to generate immune responses [459] . The immune system utilizes such properties to (from the Greek \"aptein,\" to fasten) or ligands, small molecules with a restricted number of identical epitopes. Haptens are therefore antigenic but not immunogenic, and can combine with only one type of antibody, but are unable by themselves to elicit immune responses, owing to their low MW. To become an immunogen, the free hapten must bind a carrier, either serum proteins or epidermal proteins: for a single hapten more than one carrier may exist [185] . Anti-hapten antibody responses require cooperation between subsets of B and T cells first recognizing the hapten and second the carrier. Current examples are drugs, metal contaminants such as Ni, Cr, Cu and b-lactamines, natural constituents of vegetable origin, including balsams, fucomarins, lactones and terpenes, to be found in fruits, vegetables and aromatic plants [18] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 792, "end": 797, "text": "[469]", "ref_id": "BIBREF449"}, {"start": 963, "end": 968, "text": "[459]", "ref_id": "BIBREF439"}, {"start": 1185, "end": 1188, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1193, "text": "470]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1773, "end": 1778, "text": "[459]", "ref_id": "BIBREF439"}, {"start": 2012, "end": 2017, "text": "[459]", "ref_id": "BIBREF439"}, {"start": 2234, "end": 2239, "text": "[459]", "ref_id": "BIBREF439"}, {"start": 2740, "end": 2745, "text": "[185]", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 3119, "end": 3123, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 588, "end": 596, "text": "Fig. 1.6", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 1196, "end": 1205, "text": "Fig. 1.16", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 1585, "end": 1593, "text": "Fig.1.17", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}], "section": "Immunogens, Antigens and Allergens"}, {"text": "Antigens are soluble or corpuscular substances, mostly made up of proteins, each formed by one, two or more chains composed of different combinations of about 20 amino acids linked to one another.

The term \"antigen specificity\" refers to antigen binding only to antibodies thereof activated. This specificity has a crucial value in the immune system: notwithstanding complexity of molecular structure, any given antibody including IgE will recognize and bind not to the whole molecule, but to the epitope, a limited portion of such a molecule formed by a few amino acids arranged in sequence or close by because of chain folding. Antigen-antibody reactions always denote a primary, dynamic fixation, based on noncovalent forces; hence they are relatively low and dependent on steric complementarity between epitopes and antibody.

A part of the epitope reacts with Fab of L chain, the other with antibody H chain, being the fundamental part of a protein molecule recognized by binding either to T cells or Fab fragments [1] . Another molecule, the agretope, also formed by amino acid residues interspersed in primary sequences, binds to both TcR and paratope [11] and to a HLA-DR molecule of new synthesis localized in a hypervariable b1 region, the desetope ( Fig. 1.15 ) [577] .

B-epitopes are recognized by B cells and binding sites of specific antibodies, whereas T-epitopes correspond to small peptide fragments (8-12 amino acids) recognized by TcR in the context of HLA molecules on antigen linear surfaces [368] . Several B-and T-epitopes have been characterized, but antigen-specific T cells appear to be distinct from those individuated by IgE antibodies [672] . The total number of separate B or T epitopes on antigen molecules, identical or different, is called valence, overall proportional to foreignness, molecular size and chemical complexity, which represent the factors influencing immunogenicity of a given antigen [185] . We shall see that an immune response also depends on the dose and mode by which foreign invaders enter the body. As a rule, macromolecules are the strongest immunogens, usually having more epitopes; however, in a given subject and under the influx of particular circumstances, only one or a few are recognized by BcRs and/or TcRs, since they are targets of immune responses. Macromolecules with one type of epitope are case of atopy, IgE antibodies recognize one specific Bcell epitope in peptide tertiary structures, whose threedimensional conformation can mask additional epitopes that will not bind to antibodies. On the contrary, T lymphocytes recognize sequential epitopes with a few amino acids located on antigen linear sequences [368] . T-and B-cell epitopes are distinct by their topographical position being located at different points, with T-cell epitopes positioned in primary structures, whereas B-cell epitopes lie in secondary and tertiary structures. Due to such differences, following heat denaturation, conformational shifts may eliminate certain epitopes on a protein, not affecting the integrity of sequential ones, and enzyme hydrolysis may alter both types. Physicochemical manipulations therefore do not alter all conformational epitopes, yet they may unmask epitopes hidden within a native protein three-dimensional structure, which may become immunogenic and accessible to IgE antibodies for binding while causing new ones to form [1, 12] . Actually, polypeptides without flanking amino acids can originate from hydrolysis, apt to combine with antibodies [591] . Instead, hydrolytic reduction of -S-S bonds of b-lactoglobulin (bLG) does not influence reactivity with IgE antibodies of native molecules or of fragments of tryptic hydrolysis, but reduces IgG reactivity [351] . These studies have revealed the structural bases of bLG antigenicity and immunogenicity: bLG immunogen epitopes are comprised in a relatively restricted part of the molecule, while those reactive with IgG appear to be correlated with conformational sites [351] . However, the distinction between immunogen and antigen epitopes is as yet scarcely known [402] . Individual residues within single epitopes, due to characteristics of either antigens or those specific to patients, are called immunodominant, thus are recognized named monospecific, but their greatest part has many independent epitopes with different specificities. Some large proteins have been found to contain as many as 50 separate T-cell epitopes. However, even small molecules can have bivalent structures: for example, the human hormone glucagon, which is only 29 amino acids long, contains separate B-and T-cell epitopes [185] . In addition to the events described, T-cell epitopes show the exquisite specificity required to activate CD4 T cells, which in turn are needed for B-cell responses against nearly all antigens. The first requirement for a molecule to be an immunogen is to contain at least one T-cell epitope: consequently, molecules comprising only B-cell epitopes (such as haptens or amino-terminal parts of glucagon) may serve as targets for antibody responses, being unable to elicit such responses autonomously [185] . Even if, in theory, T-cell epitopes do not bind to IgE antibodies, small peptides may do so and subsequently block (as monovalent haptens) or stimulate basophils [496] . These observations are of substantial importance, since identification of IgE-binding B-cell epitopes may: 1. Increase both specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic tests by including molecules with epitopes of this type 2. Distinguish B-cell from T-cell epitopes 3. Elucidate trigger mechanisms of IgE-sensitized metachromatic cells [496] The epitopes of a protein are of two types [12, 185] : \u2211 Sequential, or linear, or segmental epitopes (usually T-cell epitopes), determined by primary structures, wholly positioned sequentially in linear sequences of a protein or PS antigen, a segment of amino acid sequences: immunogenicity is the result of covalent linkage of these residues to one another, which cannot move significantly apart. By definition, such epitopes are more resistant and generally remain unchanged following heat or enzyme denaturation and may be left untouched by enzymes not specific for amino acid bonds present within epitopes. \u2211 Conformational, or discontinuous epitopes (usually B-cell epitopes), are far apart in primary sequences and critical residues are brought close together via folding of antigen chains in normal three-dimensional steric configurations, so that they may encompass residues widely distant from one another along protein sequences, positioned also nearby, but juxtaposed in tertiary structures. Immunogenicity is due to molecular configuration. Normally, such epitopes are scarcely resistant; hence they are lost when antigens are denatured and fail to refold appropriately [13, 414] (Fig. 1.18 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 287, "end": 292, "text": "[368]", "ref_id": "BIBREF386"}, {"start": 438, "end": 443, "text": "[672]", "ref_id": "BIBREF683"}, {"start": 707, "end": 712, "text": "[185]", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1457, "text": "[368]", "ref_id": "BIBREF386"}, {"start": 2172, "end": 2175, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2176, "end": 2179, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2296, "end": 2301, "text": "[591]", "ref_id": "BIBREF590"}, {"start": 2509, "end": 2514, "text": "[351]", "ref_id": "BIBREF351"}, {"start": 2772, "end": 2777, "text": "[351]", "ref_id": "BIBREF351"}, {"start": 2869, "end": 2874, "text": "[402]", "ref_id": "BIBREF402"}, {"start": 3408, "end": 3413, "text": "[185]", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 3914, "end": 3919, "text": "[185]", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 4084, "end": 4089, "text": "[496]", "ref_id": "BIBREF495"}, {"start": 4427, "end": 4432, "text": "[496]", "ref_id": "BIBREF495"}, {"start": 4476, "end": 4480, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 4481, "end": 4485, "text": "185]", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 5616, "end": 5620, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 5621, "end": 5625, "text": "414]", "ref_id": "BIBREF414"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 5626, "end": 5636, "text": "(Fig. 1.18", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}], "section": "Epitopes and Paratopes"}, {"text": "Consequently, since B epitopes are mostly conformational, they can be more easily eliminated, while sequential T epitopes are more resistant. Epitopes of this type have acquired relevance for their use in specific immunotherapy (SIT) and preparation of protein hydrolysates. Spatial conformation plays a key role, since accessibility of epitopes is a prerequisite for binding to immunocompetent cells and for immunogenicity. In the Immunogens, Antigens and Allergens However, certain immunodominant, linear epitopes are represented by peptides with four to nine amino acids [511] . A single antibody may also react with an antigen other than the one causing its formation, as well with different epitopes on the same molecule or carried by different molecules: this is called cross-reactivity. Consequently, allergenicity does not depend on the size of a given protein, but on the number of immunoreactive epitopes, similar or not [185] . In practice, the same molecule can bind several different epitopes, either two combining with and cross-linking the same IgE molecule, or six, eight, or even ten nonidentical epitopes; whereas sIgE can bind more strongly to an allergen different from the one that stimulated its synthesis, but with characteristics similar to the first one [1] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 574, "end": 579, "text": "[511]", "ref_id": "BIBREF510"}, {"start": 931, "end": 936, "text": "[185]", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 1279, "end": 1282, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epitopes and Paratopes"}, {"text": "In this context, children sensitive to Der p (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus), for example, may produce sIgE binding to allergens of a species they have never met in the environment.

Additional studies support that different proteins may have common epitopes, thereby explaining cross-reactivities between different proteins within a given food as well as between different related foods, or between pollens, vegetables and fruits [1] (see p. 164). Likewise, if there are epitopes common to different substances with the same amino group in p (para) position on the benzene ring, patients sensitive to a drug with such a group should prudentially avoid other substances within the same chemical group. In conclusion, epitopes identical or nearly identical can be found on antigen molecules of different origin or species: an epitope common to two or more allergens triggers cross-reactions between substances with a similar structure, or between metabolites alike from an immunochemical point of view.

All Igs are glycoproteins and contain 3% to 13% of carbohydrates, depending on the class of antibody. The carbohydrate is essential in maintaining the Ig structure [115] . Tables 1.13 and 1.14 [544] summarize their main characteristics, including MW and half-life, and Table 1 .15 [545] presents Ig levels at various ages compared with adult values; other authors prefer geometric means (GM). Isotype switching has an indubitable final significance, with every isotype having specialized biological properties, as follows: \u2211 IgG comprise 75%-80% of serum Igs, being the only class crossing the placenta from mother to fetus, where it is found and is responsible for neonate protection during the first months of life. The levels decrease progressively, leading to a transient hypogammaglobulinemia at approximately 4-6 months of age, while normal adult values are attained only at about 4-6 years. Molecules are further divided into four subclasses: IgG 1 (70%), IgG 2 (20%), IgG 3 (8%), IgG 4 (5% of total). Besides the Hg chain, subclasses have different properties, regarding for example, binding to serum complement and activating its alternative pathway, and adhesion to macrophages. IgG 2 has a lower placental passage, and IgG 4 is the only IgG unable to fix complement by the classic pathway, in addition to having a poor affinity for phagocytes. Abnormal levels of one or more IgG subclasses have been reported in children with severe chronic asthma, or recurrent respiratory infections (RRI) whether associated with asthma or not, of allergic type or not, with selective IgA deficiency (IgASD) or other PIDs, but not in otherwise healthy subjects (Chap. 22). Therefore, IgG antibodies represent the more differentiated phase of antibody responses with variations of subclasses according to encountered pathogens (or persistence of antigen stimuli). IgG is also an opsonizing antibody, although with lesser potency than IgM, reacting with epitopes on microorganisms via its Fab portions. However, the Fc portion for which many phagocytes bear (short-term sensitizing IgGs) has been credited a sensitizing activity mostly belonging to IgG 4 , that turned out to mediate similar-reaginic reactions but not of the IgE receptors delivers opsonizing properties; similarly it plays a critical role in ADCC, focusing NK cells on their targets [36] .

In allergen molecules, IgE antibody binds to sIgE epitopes, while IgG antibody can bind to IgG-specific epitopes localized in the same point of the molecule or elsewhere: namely, IgG may react with the same epitope as IgE antibodies or the two Igs may react with two quite different epitopes on the same molecule [401] . IgGs are erroneously called blocking antibodies since they inhibit effects of IgE antibodies in the Prausnitz-K\u00fcstner test [1] : IgGs probably act as such, without interfering with sIgE epitopes to provoke an in vivo synthesis of IgE antibodies to a given allergen. However, not being reagins, IgG antibodies cause diagnostic perplexities due either to negativity of allergic tests in individuals with typical symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity or to a paradoxical situation of the same antibody acting in pathogenic and protective ways [1] , an issue to be dismissed among the hypotheses put forward [13] . In summary, no direct challenge can reproduce clinical disease or tissue reactivity ascribed solely to specific IgG 4 antibodies to challenged allergens [13] . From a clinical point of view, in FA diagnosis measurement of IgG antibodies is superfluous because healthy subjects following a prolonged allergen exposure also have frequent elevations of serum IgG antibodies [13] , while in respiratory allergy such levels are identical in patients whether they be atopic or not (Chap. 11). Characteristically, IgGs increase during SIT, although correlations between their rise and clinical results are unstable (Chap. 13). A high amount of IgG 4 was found in complexed IgG anti-IgE antibodies, recognizing at least two epitopes located within Ce2-Ce3 and Ce4 domains.

Administered intravenously (IV), Ig are highly beneficial to children with PIDs and several other affections. \u2211 IgA antibodies prominent in the MALT are the sole antibodies in secretions (aside from a small percentage of IgM), hence it is called sIgA. IgA occurs as monomers, dimers, trimers and polymers. IgA monomers have no agglutinating properties (unlike sIgA) but can bind to antigens, predominant in serum, while dimeric IgA is quantitatively the most abundant in secretions. Two dimers are held together by the same J chain and associated with a polypeptide, called secretory component (SC), localized on the long arm of chromosome 1. SC is a fragment of epithelial cell poly Ig receptors and a component of high significance because it protects mucosal sIgA from proteolytic degradation, literally wrapping round C a 2 domains of both sIgA subunities, even if -S-S bonds are for only one subunit [186] . The two subclasses, IgA 1 and IgA 2 , represent 12% and 3% of total serum Igs, respectively. sIgA is actively transported across epithelial cells, covering as a film and protecting mucosal surfaces from microorganisms, preventing organism attachment to cells and clearing them off by phagocytosis. IgA can activate complement via the alternative pathway, not inducing bacterial lysis mediated by the classic pathway, and possess bactericidal activity against Gram-organisms, but only when lysozyme is present, interestingly, in the same secretions containing sIgA [36] . Table 1 .15 shows IgA levels slowly ascending, and sIgA levels quickly produced. IgA antibodies present in colostrum and breast milk protect at-risk infants (Chaps. 2 and 24). IgASD is the most frequent PID. \u2211 IgE (in which the E is erythema), also termed reagins with a half-life of 2-4 weeks on metachromatic cell membranes, are normally present in serum at the lowest concentration, <0.001%, of total circulating Igs. For this reason, IgE concentration is expressed in international units (IU), one IU being equal to 2.4 ng/ml. IgE levels increase considerably in atopic diseases, hyper-IgE syndrome (HIgES), infections with parasites [471] , pediatric AIDS, and other diseases. High levels saturate mast cell receptors and pass into the circulation, where detectable levels are extremely elevated compared to normal subjects [471] . IgE antibodies come from plasma cells distributed primarily in lymphoid tissues of respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, derived from pre-B cells from a differential lineage originating from IgM B lymphocytes and via the following passages: B IgM-IgD -B IgM-IgD-IgE become IgE B lymphocytes. Like other Igs, IgE has four polypeptidic chains, but two chief immunobiological characteristics: an e chain 11 kD greater than homologous chains, with five domains, one V and four C, one more than other Igs, and is cytophilic, having a propensity to bind to metachromatic cells with Fc fragment, of which FceRI is a receptor (Table 1. 3). FceRI extends from the C-terminal part of Ce2 to the N-terminal sequence of Ce3 domains, while the FceRII binding site, the second receptor, is localized in the N-terminal part of the Ce3 domain close to FceRI [553] . Since IgE molecules have a bent form, their convex surface nearest the membrane (Ce3) binds to FceRI, thereby making remote a binding site for another receptor ( Fig. 1.19 , showing also FceRII). This explains why FceRI has only an a chain, its affinity for only an e chain, and why there is only one receptor [553] . IgE molecules have no subclasses, similarly to IgM and IgD molecules [186] . \u2211 IgM is present early in primary immune responses to most antigens. Small IgM amounts in secretions (sIgM) also contain SCs. Being a pentamer, covalently linked by -S-S bonds with J chain, it does not pass through the placenta. Moreover, the IgM molecule is the most efficient agglutinating and complement-fixing Ig (by classic pathway). Because of their pentameric form, IgM antibodies can form macromolecular bridges between epitopes that may be too distant from each other to be \u2211 Recognizing, with the paratope, one or more epitopes present on an antigen or on different antigens \u2211 Acting as an antigen with an idiotype leading to antiidiotype antibodies [18] Such antigen functions are committed to idiotypes, present in V H and V L regions of antibody molecules.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 348, "end": 353, "text": "[513]", "ref_id": "BIBREF512"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1266, "text": "[186]", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1837, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2478, "end": 2483, "text": "[471]", "ref_id": "BIBREF451"}, {"start": 2669, "end": 2674, "text": "[471]", "ref_id": "BIBREF451"}, {"start": 3522, "end": 3527, "text": "[553]", "ref_id": "BIBREF532"}, {"start": 3840, "end": 3845, "text": "[553]", "ref_id": "BIBREF532"}, {"start": 3917, "end": 3922, "text": "[186]", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 4585, "end": 4589, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1840, "end": 1847, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 3298, "end": 3307, "text": "(Table 1.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 3692, "end": 3701, "text": "Fig. 1.19", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Antibodies"}, {"text": "Definitions \u2211 Public or cross-reacting idiotypes, expressed by antibodies produced by all individuals of the same race, are directed against a single epitope or against nonidentical antigens.

The foreign antigen approach, disturbing pre-existing homeostasis sustained by an equilibrium between idiotype and antiidiotype, generates an immune response by T and B cells, activating anti-idiotype responses [238] , either humoral (antibodies against idiotypes of soluble Igs) or CMI (T cells with TcR specific for hypervariable regions of both TcR and BcR) [474] (Fig. 1.20) . Some anti-idiotype antibodies may competitively block binding to paratopes of corresponding antigens, interacting with epitopes or directly with paratopes (associated idiotypes), thus eliciting an antigen-antibody reaction wholly similar to classic reactions induced by antigens [454] . Other anti-idiotypes, without such selective inhibition, bridged by monomeric IgA antibodies. Also, because of their multiple valences, they are best suited to combine with antigens containing more epitopes, as related to PS or cellular antigens [36] . Together with IgD, IgM is the most common Ig expressed on B cell surfaces (and virgin B cells). IgM is the first Ig class synthesized by both the fetus and newborn: high fetal IgM levels are indicative of congenital or perinatal infections [186] . IgM is the isotype synthesized in noticeable amounts by children and adults as a primary antibody response after immunization or exposure to T-dependent and T-independent antigens; therefore a role of IgM as regulator of immune responses via a specific receptor of Th lymphocytes has been postulated. IgM antibodies are significantly increased in IgASD and particularly in HIgMS. \u2211 IgD is present in serum in very small amounts.

The other chains have been omitted to simplify the diagram may instead bind to amino acid sequences of the paratope FR region, which do not contribute to antigen binding (not associated idiotypes) [454] . As it was demonstrated, anti-idiotype antibodies can bind directly to Ig idiotype determinants, regulating their expression [58] . Also for T cells there is evidence of T-cell idiotypes (clonotype markers) and of interactions between B-cell and T-cell idiotypes [58] . In addition, anti-idiotype antibodies specific for TcR clonotype markers have been observed, in turn interrupting the network of antiidiotype antibodies produced in certain diseases during a normal immune response: since T cells can have varying phenotypes, a potential exists for augmenting or suppressing immune responses via idiotype networks involving T cells [58] . For example, T-cell idiotypes may be recognized by B cells (antibodies) or by peptides associated with T cells (TcR) presented by HLA class I or II molecules. Similarly, T cells can recognize B idiotypes presented as HLA-associated peptides [236] (Fig. 1.20) . Additionally, although antibody responses to target antigens are characterized by formation of several hundred different antigen-antibody molecules, idiotypeanti-idiotype reactions are much more restricted depending on common amino acid sequences, in close contact with paratopes of different antibodies. According to these studies, cross-reactivity is frequently observed among various antibodies in anti-idiotype responses to target antigens. In other words, if paratopes able to recognize a given idiotype exist, classic epitopes should present it together with idiotypes already existing in the molecule [236] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 450, "end": 455, "text": "[454]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 582, "end": 586, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 720, "end": 724, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1095, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1339, "end": 1344, "text": "[236]", "ref_id": "BIBREF217"}, {"start": 1967, "end": 1972, "text": "[236]", "ref_id": "BIBREF217"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 29, "end": 38, "text": "Fig. 1.19", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 1345, "end": 1356, "text": "(Fig. 1.20)", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Idiotypes and Anti-idiotypes"}, {"text": "Anti-idiotypes can regulate sIgE responses but cannot cause antibody responses; however, miming functionally original epitopes, the so-called idiotypes internal image of antigen or network antigens (in the sense given by Kohler) [268] can behave as surrogate antigens, or as epitopes in terms of structural affinity, like antigen molecules, thus increasing antibody responses. Figure 1 .21 [58] shows another of Jerne's theories, in which idiotypes can mimic structures of apparently unrelated antigen molecules, binding to receptors specific for that antigen and inhibiting immune responses or, on the contrary, up-regulating them by replacing some antigen functions. The paratope of antibody 1 is complementary to a structure on the immunizing antigen; in turn the paratope of antibody 2 is complementary to that of antibody 1, and thus antibody 2 can resemble a structure on the immunizing antigen. In the case of insulin and of anti-insulin antibodies ( Fig. 1.21 ), the paratope of antibody 1 is complementary to the epitope, antibody 2 is an anti-idiotype vs anti-insulin antibodies (antibody 1), and can bind to the insulin receptor and even stimulate glycolysis [58] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 229, "end": 234, "text": "[268]", "ref_id": "BIBREF268"}, {"start": 390, "end": 394, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1174, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 377, "end": 385, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 958, "end": 967, "text": "Fig. 1.21", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Idiotypes and Anti-idiotypes"}, {"text": "The circuit thus far described may have envisioned an idiotype network.

It is striking that murine monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies, specific for the rye grass pollen allergen Lol p 4, are able to inhibit binding of murine, rabbit, and even human antiserum. Since anti-Lol p antiserum can inhibit idiotype-anti-idiotype interactions, accordingly the monoclonal antibody in question has been characterized as an internal image anti-idiotype of the antigen [683] . Further experiments have demonstrated that immunizing adult mice with anti-idiotype antibodies against poliovirus are activated antibodies that effectively neutralize upcoming viruses. An interesting study (Chap. 2) following this line of research has revealed that the CB of offspring of agammaglobulinemic mothers or with IgASD was able to inhibit binding of poliovirus antigens to anti-poliovirus antibodies: a suggested rationale is a probable reactivity against CB anti-idiotype anti-antigen antibodies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 852, "end": 857, "text": "[683]", "ref_id": "BIBREF671"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1251, "text": "[683]", "ref_id": "BIBREF671"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Idiotypes and Anti-idiotypes"}, {"text": "Current acquisitions on immune system regulations are still a matter of debate. At least two control systems are concerned, one provided by the suppressor cell network and the other by the idiotype cell network. The first network can be activated by original immune stimuli that regulated the system. CD8 T cells may be specific for a given clone or may down-regulate T-cell responses in a nonspecific way. Consequently, the same complex molecule can trigger helper T cells, effector T cells, and specific or nonspecific suppressor T-cell responses. Several ILs can also contribute to these results, modulating CD4 or CD8 T cells [469] . Idiotype regulation depends on recognition by the immune system that an immune reaction took place. In this event, antibody production in response to an antigen stimulus and pertinent antigen-antibody interactions trigger a response by a second series of IgE-producing B cells. The secondgeneration antibodies react with idiotypes on the original paratope producing the first-generation antibody and block its production. Anti-TcR antibodies are also formed and down-regulate T-cell responses in a similar way, while CD8 T cells can operate against idiotypes. Such intervention of cells and responses is essential to avoid that a failure, even partial, of any regulatory systems may result in active immune responses [469] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 630, "end": 635, "text": "[469]", "ref_id": "BIBREF449"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1360, "text": "[469]", "ref_id": "BIBREF449"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Idiotypes and Anti-idiotypes"}, {"text": "If a thymocyte fails to produce any functional a chain, it cannot be selected and eventually dies of apoptosis; if a T-cell cannot be activated because the second signal is absent, it may be a target of a distinctive event known as clonal anergy ( Fig. 1.22a) [138, 160, 177, 457] . Consequently, mature lymphocytes are rendered functionally unresponsive, resulting in tolerance, for example because CD28/CD80-CD86 [446] or CD40-CD154 (CD40L) costimulatory signals are lacking, which instead amplify such signals [37, 160] . Signaling via the CD122 g chain can prevent induction of T-cell anergy stimulating the cell to secrete antibody 2: in this way an idiotype secreted during immune response to a given antigen can yield a corresponding anti-idiotype. In several idiotype-anti-idiotype systems, anti-idiotypes can act as anti-receptor antibodies. Among hormones, besides insulin, we find thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, glucagon, etc.; among neurotransmitters are found acetylcholine, catecholamines, endorphins, reovirus, etc. In all these instances, the V region of antibody 2 represents the internal image of the external antigen. It may seem odd that an antibody is disguised as an antigen, but among 10 8 three-dimensional V regions there must be a kind of mimicry of other molecules [58] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 260, "end": 265, "text": "[138,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 266, "end": 270, "text": "160,", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 271, "end": 275, "text": "177,", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 276, "end": 280, "text": "457]", "ref_id": "BIBREF437"}, {"start": 415, "end": 420, "text": "[446]", "ref_id": "BIBREF468"}, {"start": 513, "end": 517, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 518, "end": 522, "text": "160]", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 1301, "end": 1305, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 248, "end": 259, "text": "Fig. 1.22a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Apoptosis or PCD"}, {"text": "Interesting applications of these studies are observed in laboratory animals: the basic principle is that in different species immune responses elicit formation of antibodies expressing a common idiotype. For example, oral immunization with heterologous antibodies modulates both systemic and mucosal anti-Ig responses: after administering murine IgA antibodies to rabbit females, murine anti-idiotype anti-antibodies are found in the [4] . Clonal deletion applies to particular clones of autoreactive, immature T cells that are physically destroyed during ontogeny to maintain self-tolerance [30] . Figure 1 .22b shows that a CD4 T-cell associated with a HLA molecule recognizes a self-antigen and is eliminated instead of being activated (PCD) [138, 185] . Costimulatory signals are crucial also for T naive cells: when such signals are absent, the first stimulation by TcR renders them ignorant, refractory to further stimuli, and following a likely second stimulation, they are exposed to an inappropriate activation; therefore they may remain functionally inactive (anergy) or die (PCD) ( Fig. 1.22c ). Clonal deletion and negative selection also take place in immature B lymphocytes. For example, limitin (IFN-w) (Table 1.5) produced by mature T lymphocytes in spleen and thymus as well as by bronchial epithelial and salivary duct cells suppresses the proliferation of pre-B cells [402] . Figure 1 .23 shows positive and negative selections developing in GCs [309] . PCD occurs during embryogenesis, in the thymus during cell im-mune maturation, and at the end stage of immune responses [115, 276, 510] . It was also shown that PCD is an active form of genetically programmed cell suicide, not provoking inflammatory reactions [192] . More precisely, PCD is a physiological apparatus essential for normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms, a sophisticated defense mechanism to remove potentially dangerous cells, including self-reactive cells, virus-infected cells, and tumor cells, aiming at restoring a previous equilibrium [542] . CD4 and CD8 T cells, after their maturation into effector cells, die in 95% of cases, not only for precise regulation of cell numbers, or to maintain cellular homeostasis, but to protect T cells from continued secretion of potentially harmful amounts of ILs [400] and to leave a stable pool of longlived memory cells [7] . Apoptosis occurs by ex novo activation of specific genes acting as PCD inducers/activators, or whose expression coincides with cell entry into apoptotic pathways (Tables 1.16, 1.17) [192, 400] . Here Fas/Apo 1 (CD95)-induced apoptosis is an important regulatory mechanism in T cells. CD95 is in the first place as well as additionally involved proteins, including ICE (IL 1 b-converting enzyme), and other proteases of the family, which may be common effectors of cell death [400] . Other genes code for products preventing cell entry into PCD pathways or regulate cell survival (Table 1. 18) [192] . A third option is the inhibition or induction mediated by viral genes (Table 1. 19) [192] , clearly a strategy to ensure virus survival until the genome has replicated to establish a successful infec-tion. More recently, the protein kinase RIP (receptorinteracting protein) has been included. Although the best role of RIP is in TNF signaling and NF-kB activation, it contains a death domain and it is capable of causing apoptosis upon cleavage [26] . From the picture shown by the tables, this multiform apoptosis pattern is unfolded: at variance with necrosis, cells shrink, both nucleus and cytoplasm condense, dying cells often release intercellular elements bound to membrane fragments, rapidly phagocytosed and engulfed by neighboring cells to remove possible noxious contents, and activated nucleases extensively degrade chromosomal DNA into small oligonucleotide fragments [542] . Studying cell-death defective (ced) species, three genes were shown to play a central part in PCD: ced-3, ced-4 and ced-9. The first two promote cell suicide; instead, ced-9 prevents the process started by ced-3 and ced-4, thus inhibiting apoptosis [542] . The mammalian counterpart of ced-3 is ICE, and that of ced-9 is protooncogene bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma-2), mainly located within outer mitochondrial membranes, the ER, and nuclear membranes [267] . The bcl-2/ced-9 gene prevents If B cells receive a FasL signal from GC T lymphocytes they will die. c Even if CD40L from GC T lymphocytes can rescue GC B cells from spontaneous death, FasL, which may be expressed on the same GC T cell, will kill CD40-activated GC T cells,so that rescued B cells will also die.d GC B cells can survive when their BcR are triggered, their survival can be extended by the T cell signal = CD40L (with or without FasL).The B cell's ultimate fate will be determined either in the absence of T cell help, or if BcR and CD40 engagement is prolonged for 5 days; therefore the GC B cell may need to receive another signal, X, to survive [114] . In a recent study, CD43 ligation led to membrane translocation and boosted the levels of membrane-bound PKC isoenzymes, mainly of the PKCz, PKCa/b, PKCe and q, and PKCm isoforms. Following CD43 ligation PKCq activation induced CD69 up-regulation via an ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)-dependent kinase pathway, promoted the AP-1, NF-kB activation and an ERK independent pathway promoting NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) activation. Consequently, PKCq was found to play a key role in the co-stimulatory functions of CD43 in human T cells [114] . bcl-2 was identified as a mammalian homolog to the antiapoptotic ced-9 in Caenorhabditis elegans, but mutations in the bcl-2-like gene ced-9 as well as DRP-1 (dynamin-related protein-1) and BH3-only protein EGL-1 may block its mitochondrial fragmentation [235] . Studies on this nematode by the 2002 Nobel laureates have shown that it has a fixed number of cells, 959, and if the number is altered, it is because too many cells die or, conversely, too many proliferate. In humans, AIDS could be provoked by excess PCD and autoimmune disease by insufficient PCD. At least 19 bcl-2 family members have been identified in mammalian cells, which possess at least one of four conserved motifs (BH1-BH4) [684] . The bcl-2 family members can be subdivided into three categories according to their function and structure: antiapoptotic members, such as bcl-2, bcl-XL, bcl-w, Mc1-1, and A1 (Bf1-1); proapoptotic molecules, such as Bax, Bak, and Bok (Mtd); and the BH3-only proteins, Bid, Bad, and Bim, which are called BH3-only proteins because of 4 bcl-2 homology regions, and share only the third [684] . Galectin-1 (Gal-1) and galectin-3 (Gal-3) are C cytochrome mitochondrial release, necessary to start apoptosis, and interacts with ced-4 inhibiting its function [661] . Expression of gene product par-4 correlates with severe impairment of cell proliferation and apoptosis via inhibition of PKCz (protein kinase Cz) enzymatic activity more probably of atypical PKC isoforms, also impairing MAP kinase (mitogen-activated protein) activation [655] , whereas PI3K (PI-3-kinase) generates survival signals [412, 684] . The PKC family consists of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that transduce a cascade of signals especially derived from the hydrol- Modified from [193] . b-galactoside-binding proteins with pro-and antiapoptotic properties, respectively (Chap. 18). Some CTLs play a role of effector cells during apoptosis, as we have seen: this is the result of perforin action [69] or of activation and concurrent transcription of Fas and its counterreceptor CD178 or Fas ligand [388] . In humans, Fas gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 10, spans 12 kb, comprises nine exons, and in mice is expressed in tissues enriched by mature lymphocytes, except for DN [388] . A further study documented a TNF role in the apoptosis of activated CD8s [681] , thereby confirming the higher inclination of Th1 T cells to effectively modulate killing by Fas binding [69] .A main pathway involves the signaling pathway of TNFR/CD95 activating both PCD and TF nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) (also activated by IL 1 ), the two events occurring independently [599] , via recruitment of multifunctional FADD (Fasassociated death domain) and TRADD (TNFR-1-associated death domain) molecules [82] . PCD provides death receptor 3 (DR3) that most likely participates in lymphocyte homeostasis [82] . Activation of NF-kB is also regulated by the NF-kB phosphorylation via the IKK complex. The IKK complex, consisting of two kinases, IKK1/a and IKK2/b, and the NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO)/IKKg regulatory subunit, mediates NF-kB activation by most known stimuli [503] . Another essential component of NF-kB activation is NIK (NF-kB-inducing kinase) whose interacting protein, TNAP (TRAF or TNFR-associated factor and NIK-associated protein) specifically inhibits NF-kB activation induced by TNF-a, TNFR1, TRADD, RIP, TRAF2, and NIK but does not affect IKK1-and IKK2-mediated NF-kB activation [217] . Overexpression of a new molecule, NIBP (NIK and IKKb-binding protein), potentiates TNF-a-induced NF-kB activation [218] . TRAF6 interacts with TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-b (TRIF) through the TRAF domain of TRAF6. However, disruption of TRAF6-binding motifs of TRIF impaired its association with TRAF6, thus resulting in a reduction in the TRIF-induced activation of NF-kB [491] . TRAFs as components of the IL 1 signaling pathway mediate signaling by interacting with TNFR, rather than with TLR, thus playing a role in cellular processes such as apoptosis [327] . The scenario is not complete, since TRAF2 and TRAF3 have been shown to play opposing roles: a positive one in the standard pathway that activates NF-kB through IKKb, but a negative role in the uneven pathway that activates NF-kB via IKKa, roles of TRAF proteins possibly linked to their ability to synthesize different forms of polyubiquitin chains [656] . The apoptosis-associated induction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway components and the proteasome activity shows that the proteasome plays an important role in the successful execution of apoptosis. Inhibiting either the proteasome activity or the increase in proteasome 26S gene expression or its upstream PI3 kinase activity results in an inhibition of NF-kB translocation thereby suppressing apoptosis [527] . There are many Fas vari-ants: soluble Fas (sFas) can block apoptosis induction [600] as well as crmA -inhibiting ICE/ced-3 (Table 1.19) . A second pathway depends on mitochondrial participation by releasing apoptogenic factors: cytochrome c catalyzes the oligomerization of APAF-1 (apoptotic protease activating factor 1), which recruits and promotes the activation of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) such as procaspase-9. These proteins interact via CARD-CARD (caspase recruitment domain interactions) [599] . Procaspase-9, in turn, activates procaspase-3, leading to apoptosis, but is prevented by members of the bcl-2 family, but cells also contain natural IAP inhibitors, the caspases (aspartate-specific cysteine protease), a family of cysteine proteases, which were found both in baculovirus and in human cells (XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2). IAPs can act as direct inhibitors of the two death effectors, caspase-3 and caspase-7, and are able to suppress the activation of two initiator caspases, caspase-8 and caspase-9 [418, 599] . Studies performed on the activity of effector caspase 3 and on the initiator caspases 2, 8, and 9 revealed that, in the absence of RIP, the activity of these caspases decreases, indicating that RIP-associated apoptosis is caspase-dependent [26] . Thus, Fas, TNFrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TNFRs can initiate cell death by two alternative pathways, one based on caspase-8 and the other dependent on the RIP kinase [211] . NF-kB is an essential regulator of immune cell survival, critical for the activation of T and B lymphocytes, and is a central coordinator of innate and adaptive immunity [470] . The apoptosis machinery in B lymphocytes may be different, generally immature cells with IgMs or IgDs or cells that have formed an extra paratope [37] .

HLA, first discovered in the 1950s, was recognized by its major influence in transplant rejection. Subsequent studies have revealed that HLA is in mammals a single gene region with a pivotal role in antigen recognition and control of immune response (Ir); some Ir genes are also mapped within its structure [329] . The chromosome region containing genes coding for self/non-self discrimination is a highly polymorphic complex region of about 4,000 kb located on chromosome 6 short arm (6 in region p21.3) (Fig. 1.24 ). HLA is accepting cells or tissue grafts between individuals [329] . Because of their close linkage, the combination of alleles at each locus on a single chromosome is usually inherited as a unit, except for infrequent cases of recombination, and is referred to as the haplotype. Although during evolution there may have been variations, the haplotypes of various mammals and birds hitherto studied are fundamentally similar. A key task referred to as complex because its genes are located on a single chromosome, and all genes can therefore be transmitted to children as one unit [18] . In humans this is the best known histocompatibility system as defined at the genetic level, comprising hundreds of genes connected together (>40% of which encode leukocyte antigens) and characterized by structural and functional diversions [264] . Histocompatibility is the property of carried on by these molecules is to present antigens or peptides deriving from enzyme cleavage to TcRs. That peptides associate with HLA molecules and are recognized as a single entity demonstrates either the phenomenon of restriction [688] or the genetic control mediated by products of HLA genes present on all nucleated cells. HLA class II genes, expressed in a constitutive way in some cells, including B and T cells, macrophages, and DCs, stimulated by specific activators such as IFN-g in endothelial and epithelial cells, form a trait with high genetic variability, so that proteins encoded by the above-mentioned genes usually differ from one individual to another [329] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 373, "end": 378, "text": "[329]", "ref_id": "BIBREF329"}, {"start": 645, "end": 650, "text": "[329]", "ref_id": "BIBREF329"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1169, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1417, "text": "[264]", "ref_id": "BIBREF264"}, {"start": 1693, "end": 1698, "text": "[688]", "ref_id": "BIBREF676"}, {"start": 2131, "end": 2136, "text": "[329]", "ref_id": "BIBREF329"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 571, "end": 581, "text": "(Fig. 1.24", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "The HLA System"}, {"text": "In mice, chromosomal segments controlling immune phenomena are divided into five regions: K and D regions encode serologically defined (SD) antigens, found in all nucleated cells and called HLA class I molecules.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The HLA System"}, {"text": "Ir genes (in mice antigen-associated with the I region of the H2 complex and in man DR-and D-related) are present on APCs, more restricted as regards their distribution and defined as HLA class II molecules; the S region controls synthesis of complement components.

Each locus is composed by a series of alleles determining the corresponding gene products (HLA antigens) on cell membranes. According to recent nomenclature, alleles with confirmed sequences of amino acids or nucleotides have a specific designation, including the name of locus and four arabic numbers: the first two designate more closely related specificity and the last two the allele number (Appendix 1.1) [640] . The number is preceded by an asterisk: e.g., HLA-DRB*0401 stands for allelic variant of 0401 of gene 1 [264] . The nomenclature of different HLA specificities has grown very large, including more or less completely defined locus numbers of alleles: 287 HLA-A, 527 HLA-B, 147 HLA-C, 6 HLA-E, 1 HLA-E, and 15 HLA-G, making a total of 980 class I alleles, 454 HLA-DR, 79 HLA-DQ, 128 HLA-DP, 10 HLA-DM, 16 HLA-DO, for a total of 649 class II alleles [640] .

A molecular three-dimensional structure shows H chains divided into six regions: three extracellular globular domains, a1, a2, an Ig-like domain, a3, a short extracellular connecting peptide N-terminal, a hydrophobic TM region (25 amino acids), and a hydrophilic intracytoplasmic C-terminal tail (30 amino acids), while L chain forms only an extracytoplasmic Ig-like domain. A molecular part furthest from the membrane embraces a deep groove or cleft, the peptide-binding site, made up of segments of a1 and a2 domains with a-helical sides and an irregular b-sheet base. A single a3 domain has sequences interacting with CD8 cells. \u2211 Class II genes, positioned in a more proximal region to the centromere, controlled by at least three HLA-DR, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ subloci, consist of two polypeptide domains, a 33-kD a and 28-kD b, noncovalently linked. This pattern resembles that of class I, but with five domains, since each chain contains two extracellular globular regions (a1 and a2, or b1 and b2), not covalently linked. The peptide binding groove has a structure similar to that of class I molecules. Also in this case the cleft chemical surface, distinct from class II molecule GPM, determines specificity of antigen binding. Class II is restricted to immunocompetent cells presenting processed antigens to CD4 cells and is necessary for interactions between immunocompetent cells. Additional class II-related molecules are eight HLA-DOA alleles [469] . The designation of class II loci on chromosome 6 consists of three letters: the first (D) indicates the class, the second (M, O, P, Q, or R) the family and the third (A or B) the chain (a or b, respectively). \u2211 Class III genes, placed between classes I and II loci, encompass a heterogeneous mixture of genes, including classic pathway complement components (C2, C4a, C4b), properdin factor P of the alternate pathway, enzyme b-21 hydroxylase, molecules of the heat shock protein family (HSP70-1 and -2), and TNF-a and TNF-b.

Owing to allelism of the above-mentioned molecules, different individuals respond differently to the same antigen when responses are HLA-restricted, that is, only when antigen presentation is in the context of class II specific molecules. In the absence of Ir alleles, there is no production of antibodies against specific antigens; hence individuals have inherited HLA antigens that in peptide presentation to TcR are markedly effective in eliciting synthesis of antibodies different from IgE antibodies. It was speculated that Ir genes are expressed on macrophages and not on T cells. Actually, the genetic control related to interactions between T cells and macrophages is localized in HLA I regions and products encoded by genes of such regions are defined as HLA-DR [198] . Only 10%-50% of macrophages isolated from peritoneum and spleen are provided with these antigens, and it seems that only HLA + cells look after antigen exposure [12] . To better define genetic restriction, it refers to different specificity for different HLA molecules, since not all T-cell subsets use the same HLA molecules, each having a capacity of response limited to some HLA components, since both class I and II contain recognition sites for CD8 and CD4 coreceptors on T cells [463] . that the majority of subjects are heterozygous (HZ) for different loci. Therefore, an extensive GPM makes wholly different HLA molecules expressed by genetically distinct individuals, that is each one has his own genetic set of HLA molecules, shared only by a few individuals of the same population. GPM is also the basis for rapid graft rejection between genetically different individuals. \u2211 Association means that all genes are transmitted en bloc by HZ parents to their children. When paternal haplotypes are a and b and maternal ones c and d, each child inherits from both haplotypes, that is ab, ac, bc and bd; thus the chances of a child having the same two haplotypes are =25%. A recombination between two haplotypes (cross-over) can be in germ cells, paternal or maternal, creating a new haplotype. The recombination rate is 1% in HLA-A and -B and between -B and -D. \u2211 Codominance means that each cell expresses HLA proteins transcribed from paternal and maternal chromosomes. One point worth noting is that only one chromosome is used to form Ig and TcR molecules, the unique occurrence of allelic exclusion. Each individual is commonly HZ for each locus and her/his HLA group is composed by several letters as described above, plus two numbers corresponding schematically to the alleles transmitted by both parents. \u2211 Moreover, some gene combinations can have an unexpected frequency, because individuals of a heterogeneous population can have two genes segregating together, with a frequency markedly different (higher or lower) than the predicted frequency. Linkage disequilibrium is a phenomenon common to almost all complex genetic systems, the tendency of specific alleles of linked genetic loci to be inherited together (as a unit or haplotype) on the same chromosomal region far exceeding that expected by chance association, functionally interacting between themselves. \u2211 GPM is a strategy for generating diversity of HLA molecules; hence it contrasts with the unique strategy of gene rearrangement of TcR and BcR. Accordingly, each lymphocyte expresses only slightly different receptors, whereas every cell of an individual expresses the same HLA molecules, but different from HLA molecules expressed by genetically unmatched subjects. GPM also contrasts with principles of allelic exclusion and thus with the genetic principles governing receptors: class I and II molecules are codominant, that is, each cell expresses HLA proteins transcribed from both maternal and paternal chromosomes, consequently confirming GPM [36] . \u2211 As regards the respective functions and properties, class I and II molecules have a similar general structure, although not identical: both seem to have a wide GPM and bind to peptide fragments subsequently recognized by TcRs. Perhaps due to different types of processing, class II molecules appear to present a heterogeneous group of peptides for a given epitope, instead of only one well-defined epitope as is normal for class I molecules. \u2211 GPM of HLA loci and some alleles of different loci tend to associate between themselves; this inclination has been understood as necessary for human immune system diversity or functioning [463] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 916, "end": 921, "text": "[198]", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1089, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1409, "end": 1414, "text": "[463]", "ref_id": "BIBREF443"}, {"start": 3954, "end": 3958, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4595, "end": 4600, "text": "[463]", "ref_id": "BIBREF443"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The HLA System"}, {"text": "Several ILs can stimulate HLA molecules: IFN-g is one of their most potent activators, whereas TNF-a, TGF-b and IFN-a and -b functions remain obscure [579] .

The set of HLA alleles inherited by an individual is exceedingly tiny compared to diverse TcR repertoires. In theory, TcRs are 1.28 a,b . A viral peptide buried in a HLA class I molecule (a), and together with another peptide (b) in the extended configuration they assume when complexed with HLA class I molecule [161] a b molecules with cytotoxic CD8 cells ( Fig. 1.29 ) [591] . These mechanisms entail recognition of peptide fragments deriving from intracellular microbial antigens, which sometimes expose native proteins to the host surface, and thus to a cytolytic attack [591] . Some viruses in particular can infect every type of human cell, so that to respond to aggressions T cells must recognize viral peptides associated with class I molecules. When other pathogens degraded via phagocytosis are active, this process implies T cells being reactive with exogenous peptides associated with class II molecules [337] . Such programming has a remote ontogenetic origin, since TcRs were planned by the immune system to recognize even small fragments of viral antigens, sometimes of only eight to ten amino acids, hence virtually indistinguishable from the related peptides of human cells. Consequently TcR was diversified to react with such fragments only if associated with HLA products [457] . Prerequisites are therefore processing outside peptides and assembling molecules for one or more HLA alleles. To degrade a protein into small fragments, both endogenous and exogenous antigens should be first broken down into vesicles with acid pH, to be associated with HLA alleles on the cell surface. Processing clarifies why T cells, unlike B cells, fail to recognize protein conformational epitopes, but only linear ones, and why they cannot distinguish between native and denatured proteins of the same antigen [474] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 300, "end": 305, "text": "[579]", "ref_id": "BIBREF578"}, {"start": 621, "end": 626, "text": "[161]", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 680, "end": 685, "text": "[591]", "ref_id": "BIBREF590"}, {"start": 884, "end": 889, "text": "[591]", "ref_id": "BIBREF590"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1230, "text": "[337]", "ref_id": "BIBREF337"}, {"start": 1600, "end": 1605, "text": "[457]", "ref_id": "BIBREF437"}, {"start": 2124, "end": 2129, "text": "[474]", "ref_id": "BIBREF454"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 435, "end": 443, "text": "1.28 a,b", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 668, "end": 677, "text": "Fig. 1.29", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "The HLA System"}, {"text": "restricted to recognize a very limited subset, while HLA molecules can bind to a large collection of foreign and self-derived peptides: this issue appears to be paradoxical since HLA molecules can bind a multitude of peptide fragments in a very restricted way, with an affinity at least 1,000-fold higher than that of TcR. Of course, each HLA molecule could bind this large group of peptides, but what governs the ability of a peptide to bind one HLA haplotype rather than another? [18] . It might also be that a very small number of HLA-peptide complexes are required at the APC surface to generate immune responses [36] . As we see from Fig.1 .28 [161] , class I molecules in concomitance with the encounter with molecules to be scrutinized present, as previously described, the special conformation with binding grooves destined to reception of already processed peptide fragments [161] . In particular, as evidenced by crystallographic studies, conserved pockets at both ends of the peptidebinding groove accommodate their N-terminals via extensive H 2 binding, thus warranting a correct orientation of peptide-binding and its closed nature at both ends [264] . In the middle of the groove there is a deep pocket providing structural complementarity (like a gem in a ring) for one of the peptide amino acids called the anchor (the amino acid residue recurring more frequently). The peptide antigen appears to be anchored by residues either at or near the end of the peptide, thus enhancing the specificity of HLA-peptide binding [344] . The single substitution of an amino acid of an exposed peptide residue, although changes do not seem to be critical for the above binding, is sufficient to abrogate TcR recognition. Since HLA molecules are very unstable, only peptides with an allele-specific anchor residue may provide sufficient stability, while a small decrease in affinity has the wide biological effect of increasing the dissociation rate of bound peptides, hence preventing adequate time for presentation to T cells [161] .

A remarkable contribution to understanding this step of immune responses comes from studies on related viral attitudes. As discussed in the preceding section, HLA class II molecules interact with CD4 cells, class I Initial Phase of the Immune Response Fig. 1.29 . Antigen processing and presentation to T lymphocytes Various methods are employed by cells for antigen processing as follows: \u2211 Phagocytosis delineates the most prominent function of mononuclear phagocytes at the point of assuming such denomination, and antigen processing has a pivotal role in inducing immune responses: during the different steps, among fragments subjected to processing, those cleaving in the endosomes and with affinity for HLA molecules escape a complete denaturation, bind to HLA alleles, and are then transported to macrophage surfaces [540] . On the contrary, after an exhaustive proteolytic cleavage in lysosomes, peptides with no HLA association are excreted outside the cell surface through a process of exocytosis. \u2211 DCs and B lymphocytes cannot use phagocytosis, but a more common process called pinocytosis, by which fluids or very small particles (diameter <10 nm = 100 \u00c5) are taken into the cell. \u2211 B cells can employ antigen-specific Igs (IgMs or IgDs), a much more effective procedure because the antigen concentration necessary is 1,000-fold less than that required by pinocytosis. However, despite the advantage of close linking with B lymphocytes, this process is really restricted to a comparatively limited number of these cells [384] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1232, "end": 1237, "text": "[540]", "ref_id": "BIBREF519"}, {"start": 1941, "end": 1946, "text": "[384]", "ref_id": "BIBREF365"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 660, "end": 669, "text": "Fig. 1.29", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Functions of HLA Molecules and Antigen Processing"}, {"text": "Exogenous peptides generated in acid vesicles bind to class II restricted T cells [391] , whereas endogenous peptides synthesized by cytosol and ER are recognized by class I restricted T cells [372] . When processing of a non-virus-infected cell (modified, for example, in a vaccine) takes place in acid vesicles, the resulting peptides are presented to CD4 lymphocytes associated with class II molecule. However, if the same antigen infects the cell, processing moves over the cell cytosol/ER, then antigens are presented in association with CD8 lymphocytes and HLA class I molecules. Following these two different procedures, CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes of an individual can recognize different epitopes of a given antigen [47] . Moreover, as a number of experiments have demonstrated, the structural characteristics of peptides do not determine the binding to one or to another HLA class, but it can be hypothesized that distinctions arise from two different ways of processing and presentation [369, 391] . Now the way by which HLA molecules acquire peptides is the center of attention, rather than the origin of peptides presented by HLA products. As regards class I molecules, before entering an exocytic system, processing of antigen material in the cytosol is usually attributed to proteasomes, an ATP-dependent complex of peptidases, proteolytic enzymes encoded by LMP2 and LMP7, a pathway probably operative in converting native antigens into peptide fragments then translocated into the ER to associate with class I molecules [377] . Unfolded or worn-out polypeptides in the ER are retrotranslocated into the cytosol where the SC factor (SCF) (Fbs1, 2) proteins distinguish native from unfolded glycoproteins and ubiquitin targets the worn-out pro-teins for dumping [648] . These proteins unfold with the help of other specialized molecules, the chaperones, and the polypeptide chains are then fed into the proteasomes, where unassembled or defective proteins in the cytosol are degraded into peptides [264] . The ubiquitinproteasome system is a fundamental machinery in the cell [520] and has been shown to be involved in the virion budding process of several viruses, particularly of rhabdoviruses [198] . In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, the entering viruses accumulated in both the endosome and denser lysosome, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in the virus transfer from the endosome to cytoplasm during the virus entry step. Understanding the sensitivity to the ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitors may be used to distinguish the early steps of viral entry [656] . Studies of Thermoplasma acidophilum [316] have shown that proteasomes, with a barrel-shaped structure, consist of two inner rings, each consisting of seven b subunits, and two outer rings, each made up of seven a subunits, all different [316] . Proteasomes interact with either ER membranes or TAP-1 and TAP-2 [293] encoded by polymorphic genes of class II and associated with H chain a1 and a2 domains [443] (Fig. 1.30 ). TAP-1 and TAP-2, closely located to genes encoding LMP2 and LMP7 inducible by IFN-g [293] , import into the ER lumen selected peptides, which may attach to a newly synthesized b chain of the class I molecule encoded by the b 2 -m gene [263] . Possibly the peptide NH 2 terminus is also trimmed [361] . The peptides are necessary for a correct assembly of HLA class I molecules. Class I molecules first assume a peptide-receptive conformation, then release peptides to be delivered to the cell surface for antigen presentation to CTLs with CD8 markers [337] . However, subsequent analyses have shown the polymorphism of TAP and LMP genes that map between DPB1 and DQB1 within class II genes [372] . So it seems reasonable to imagine that different epitopes of the same antigen are presented to T cells of different subjects. Support for this hypothesis will lead to evident implications, such as individual differences in immune responses to specific antigens [28] , in addition to differences in tolerance induction, predisposition to autoimmunity, and disorders associated with HLA molecules [28] . HLA class I molecules could also bind to exogenous antigens loaded by macrophages and DCs [39] . The principal routes are as follows: release of antigens acquired from endocytic or phagocytic vesicles returning immediately to normal pathways, or antigen digestion in a vesicle by using normal class I mechanisms; pertinent examples in support of both hypotheses derive from inhibitors of processing pathways such as brefeldin A and chloroquine [39] . When TAP-2 is deficient, assembly of class I molecules cannot be completed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 82, "end": 87, "text": "[391]", "ref_id": "BIBREF372"}, {"start": 193, "end": 198, "text": "[372]", "ref_id": "BIBREF390"}, {"start": 721, "end": 725, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 994, "end": 999, "text": "[369,", "ref_id": "BIBREF387"}, {"start": 1000, "end": 1004, "text": "391]", "ref_id": "BIBREF372"}, {"start": 1533, "end": 1538, "text": "[377]", "ref_id": "BIBREF395"}, {"start": 1773, "end": 1778, "text": "[648]", "ref_id": "BIBREF647"}, {"start": 2009, "end": 2014, "text": "[264]", "ref_id": "BIBREF264"}, {"start": 2087, "end": 2092, "text": "[520]", "ref_id": "BIBREF539"}, {"start": 2207, "end": 2212, "text": "[198]", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}, {"start": 2610, "end": 2615, "text": "[656]", "ref_id": "BIBREF655"}, {"start": 2654, "end": 2659, "text": "[316]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2855, "end": 2860, "text": "[316]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2928, "end": 2933, "text": "[293]", "ref_id": "BIBREF312"}, {"start": 3021, "end": 3026, "text": "[443]", "ref_id": "BIBREF465"}, {"start": 3125, "end": 3130, "text": "[293]", "ref_id": "BIBREF312"}, {"start": 3276, "end": 3281, "text": "[263]", "ref_id": "BIBREF263"}, {"start": 3335, "end": 3340, "text": "[361]", "ref_id": "BIBREF361"}, {"start": 3592, "end": 3597, "text": "[337]", "ref_id": "BIBREF337"}, {"start": 3731, "end": 3736, "text": "[372]", "ref_id": "BIBREF390"}, {"start": 4000, "end": 4004, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4134, "end": 4138, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4231, "end": 4235, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 4585, "end": 4589, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3027, "end": 3037, "text": "(Fig. 1.30", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Functions of HLA Molecules and Antigen Processing"}, {"text": "As reported by studies on the routes of class II molecule intracellular traffic, newly synthesized HLA products are collected in the ER where they are delayed for with foreign peptides occurs in endosomal or prelysosomal compartments where peptides are internalized, then extruded in intra-and extracellular compartments [378] .

The TNF and IL 12 induction was dramatically increased in IFN-gprimed monocytes [49] . The release of these ILs by monocytes can be modulated by different infectious and noninfectious stimuli. Monocytes also yield MCP 1-3 (see later) several ILs, such as IL 1 RA, IL 8 , TNF-a and -b [73] , and MIF (monocyte migration inhibiting factor) [73, 609] . As IgE antibodies bind to their receptors, they acquire bactericidal and cytotoxic properties producing O 2 \u2022-(superoxide), apparently due to activation of NADPH (reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate)-oxidase [115] . They are endowed with CD23 [115] and FceRI, with a stronger binding to IgE [347] , also becoming capable of engulfing complexed IgE-peptides subsequently presented to T Cells of the Immune System Participating [445] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 12, "end": 17, "text": "[540,", "ref_id": "BIBREF519"}, {"start": 18, "end": 22, "text": "593]", "ref_id": "BIBREF592"}, {"start": 67, "end": 77, "text": "(15-50 mm)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 328, "end": 332, "text": "[68,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 333, "end": 337, "text": "540,", "ref_id": "BIBREF519"}, {"start": 338, "end": 342, "text": "609]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1103, "text": "[540]", "ref_id": "BIBREF519"}, {"start": 1420, "end": 1424, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1673, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2170, "end": 2175, "text": "[608]", "ref_id": "BIBREF626"}, {"start": 2338, "end": 2340, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2387, "end": 2391, "text": "[73,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2392, "end": 2396, "text": "609]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2479, "end": 2483, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2683, "end": 2687, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2737, "end": 2741, "text": "[73,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2742, "end": 2746, "text": "609]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2973, "end": 2978, "text": "[115]", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 3008, "end": 3013, "text": "[115]", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 3056, "end": 3061, "text": "[347]", "ref_id": "BIBREF347"}, {"start": 3191, "end": 3196, "text": "[445]", "ref_id": "BIBREF467"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 23, "end": 33, "text": "(Fig. 1.32", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 314, "end": 322, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Cells of the Immune System Participating in Immune Responses"}, {"text": "Macrophages are versatile secretory cells: they have \u00aa 100 receptors on their surface, including complement proteins, active O 2 radicals, bioactive lipids such as PGE 2 , PAF (platelet-activating factor), nucleotides and arachidonate metabolites and several enzymes including lysozyme, acid hydrolases, neutral proteases, and enzyme inhibitors (Table 1. 20) . Macrophages generate CCL chemokines, including MIP-1a and -1b (macrophage inflammatory protein-1a and -1b) and MCP-1 [540, 609] . Like monocytes, they are activated by IFN-g and MIF, in certain conditions acquiring cytotoxic or suppressive properties, in addition to contributing to lymphocyte responses as accessory cells, releasing ILs such as TNF, IL 6 , IFN-g via IL 1 and IL 12 , as well as IFN-a and TGF-b [488] . Macrophages synthesize IL 18 as an IFN-g induction factor [669] . In turn, IFN-g induces in macrophages IL 12 and IL 12 R, whose activity depends on Th1 T-cell activation [124] . IL 15 can also be a macrophage endogenous product [67] . Four ILs instead deactivate these cells: IL 4 , IL 10 , IL 13 and TGF-b [124] . Correspondingly, macrophages are pluripotent cells supporting opposite actions depending on their local microenvironment: for example, the response to IL 2 can activate T-cell proliferation or suppression and CMI [124] . Probably, CD28 expression by IL 12 -producing macrophages can lead to generation of Th1 T-cell responses [387] , anticipating that CD28 binding to CD80 represents a costimulatory signal for T lymphocytes. Because the number of monocytes and macrophages can increase 3-to 100-fold at a site of inflammation, the regulatory and effector roles of these cells become even more prominent after an inflammatory response has begun. Also prominent is the portfolio of chemokines that attract these cells to a site of inflammation, which include CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CCL13, CCL17, and CCL22 [87] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 355, "end": 358, "text": "20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 478, "end": 483, "text": "[540,", "ref_id": "BIBREF519"}, {"start": 484, "end": 488, "text": "609]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 773, "end": 778, "text": "[488]", "ref_id": "BIBREF487"}, {"start": 839, "end": 844, "text": "[669]", "ref_id": "BIBREF668"}, {"start": 952, "end": 957, "text": "[124]", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 963, "end": 965, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1014, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1078, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1089, "end": 1094, "text": "[124]", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1315, "text": "[124]", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1428, "text": "[387]", "ref_id": "BIBREF368"}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1913, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 345, "end": 354, "text": "(Table 1.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Cells of the Immune System Participating in Immune Responses"}, {"text": "Granulocytes live only a few days; have the main function of ingesting and kill any non-self substance. C/EBPa is essential for their development [678] . Cells of granulocyte lineage, PMNs, eosinophils, and basophils are distinct according to cytoplasmic granule staining. Granulocyte surface markers are shown in Table 1 .21 [470] and compared with metachromatic cells. Neutrophils ( Fig. 1.32 , d, f, g, h) are the most numerous leukocytes in the bloodstream (half-life, 4-10 h), with a normal adult having >100 billion PMNs present daily, a number that can increase to almost 1 trillion when the host is stressed by infections. PMNs carry on [135]. The secondary granule proteins (SGP) are secreted in a hierarchical manner: first gelatinase-containing granules, then specific granules, and last azurophilic ones [135] (Table 1. 23 [315] , Fig. 1.32 g) . In the later stages of myeloid development, the SGP genes are coordinately upregulated, and members of the C/EBP family of TFs, in particular C/EBPa and C/EBPh, play specific and unique roles in upregulating their expression [257] . Among the many granule enzymes (>20), MPO (myeloperoxidase), elastase, collagenase and gelatinase play a prominent role in cytotoxicity, also attacking and degrading above all connective tissues [630] . The mature granules also contain Igs, complement proteins, clotting factors, cationic proteins and defensins (see \"Innate Immunity\" p. 152). The CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family of nuclear TFs is implicated in the regulation of terminal myeloid differentation. In particular, C/EBPa and C/EBPh play specific and unique roles in upregulating SGP expression [257, 646] . The abnormal PMN accumulation in states of acute inflammation consists of several processes taking shape in sequence: the following activities: chemotaxis, phagocytosis, degranulation, and opsonization [360] . PMNs are involved in the immune inflammation in concert with eosinophils and platelets, also determining within such processes the delayed phase of allergic reactions. Prolonged ADAM17 (a disintegrin and a metalloproteinase 17) expression during neutrophil effector functions and apoptosis may play a role in both the induction and downregulation of neutrophil activity [617] . Primed PMNs in the presence of tissue injury due to microbial agents produce factor(s) which inhibit some of the cell's antimicrobial functions contributing to immune dysfunction, while the factor(s) produced by unprimed PMNs facilitate antimicrobial countermeasures [407] . High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein increases the nuclear translocation of NF-kB and enhances the expression of proinflammatory ILs in human PMNs. These effects appear to involve the p38 MAPK, PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), and ERK1/2 pathways. However, the mechanisms of HMGB1-induced neutrophil activation are distinct from endotoxin-induced signals [407] . [73, 315] . During acute inflammations, IL 1 enhances T-cell activation, also inducing IL 6 , IL 8 and GM-CSF. Recruited early to injured sites, PMNs release M-CSF, hence activating the more slowly invading monocytes [315] . PMNs are activated by NAP (neutrophil activating factor)/IL 8 released by PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and then recruited to inflamed sites by NCF (neutrophil chemotactic factor) and LTB 4 , utilizing CD11/CD18 integrin ligands of CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD102 (ICAM-2, intercellular adhesion molecule 1,2) to adhere to vascular endothelium (margination) [23] . PMNs infiltrate injured sites ingesting whatever foreign protein or cellular debris they encounter, including bacteria and CIC (circulating immune complexes)-IgG by virtue of specific receptors, releasing enzymes with lytic action responsible for the maintenance of immune inflammation [135] . When activated, the enzyme NADPH oxidase attached to the cytoplasmic membrane produces monovalent hydroxyl radicals with oxidant properties and oxidized metabolites [663] . During phagocytosis and especially when antigens adhere to the PMN surface and are therefore not phagocytosed, PMNs undergo a respiratory burst, degranulate and fully mobilize their secretory vesicles. Their cytoplasmic membrane fuses with the intracellular granules, finally emptying their enzyme content into the cell lumen Cells of the Immune System Participating endothelium and PMN activation, adhesion, diapedesis and phagocytosis [315] . Besides their essential defensive functions, PMNs are coming under scrutiny whereby they may cause excessive injury to host cells, since a potent cytotoxicity in acute inflammation is potentially damaging. PMN persistent accumulation involves an excessive secretion of O 2 toxic radicals and proteases, with amplification of tissue injury following LTB 4 , LTC 4 (leukotriene C 4 ) and TXA 2 (thromboxane A 2 ) synthesis [630] . It has been suggested that such negative regulation is favored by the density reduction observed in allergic subjects [364] . Aged neutrophils undergo apoptosis [276] : endogenous activations of endonucleases allow PMNs to be recognized and engulfed intact by macrophages to avoid dispersion of cytotoxic products [510] (Fig. 1.34) . Early neutrophil influx into the airways after allergen challenge is mediated by IL 1 , IL 18 and p38 MAPK and can be reduced by inhibiting either IL or p38 MAPK. However, both the neutralization of these ILs and reduction of PMN number do not modify the later development of eosinophilic airway inflammation or the BHR (bronchial hyperreactivity) insurgence, thus suggesting that the early and transient neutrophil response fails to play a direct role in the development of allergen-induced BHR. The effects of inhibiting p38 MAPK in decreasing BHR indicate activities independent of its prevention of PMN accumulation [569] . Eosinophils ( Fig. 1.32f, 1.35a ) [680] , present in peripheral blood at a mean concentration of 300-400 cells/m 2 from 0 to 2 years and of 200-250 cells/m 2 from 4 to 21 years, survive longer than other granulocytes (half-life, 6-12 h). Eosinophils migrate into the thymus during the neonatal period, localize to the corticomedullary region and attain maximum levels by 2 weeks of age. A second influx of eosinophils to the medullary region is observed at 16 weeks of age, when the thymus begins to involute [477] . Even after leaving the bone marrow together with CD34, they continue the synthesis process and can return into the bloodstream from tissues; however, compared to PMNs, they are inconclusive as phagocytes and less efficient at intracellular killing [631] . Eosinophils are present in allergic, immunological, parasitic disorders and hypereosinophilic syndromes. They can be activated either in vivo or in vitro gy diverse agonists, such as Igs, lipid mediators, and ILs [371] and from CD69, CD44, and CD54 [670] . On activation, they probably kill parasites mainly by releasing cationic proteins and reactive O 2 metabolites into the extracellular fluid [623] . Eotaxin induces a rapid concentration-dependent activation of ERK2 and p38 in eosinophils, and the activation of these kinases is required for eotaxin-induced eosinophil chemotaxis, actin polymerization, and degranulation. It is therefore proved that eotaxin plays an integral role in the development of eosinophilic inflammation in asthma and allergic inflammatory diseases [247] . Key eosinophil regulatory ILs such as IL 5 and the eotaxin subfamily of chemokines regulate eosinophil production and localization at baseline and during inflammatory responses [573] , making them capable of diffusing their cationic proteins. [477] . In vitro studies and those on BALF (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) show that the regulation of eosinophil production is highly dependent on GM-CSF, IL 3 and IL 5 [550] . Such ILs play a pivotal role in promoting eosinophil maturation, remarkably influencing both differentiation in the bone marrow and activation in the tissues [61] . GM-CSF and IL 3 particularly increase the number of precursor cells prolonging their survival, IL 5 acting primarily as a selective chemotactic factor mediates their maturation and triggers degranulation and adhesion [34] . GM-CSF and IL 5 further activate eosinophil cytotoxicity and oxidative metabolism and, added to culture with CD34, increment notably their number, making the cells functionally mature on the 21st day [515] . Since during intense responses eosinophils can undergo cytolysis, the detection of cationic Cells of the Immune System Participating Modified from [197] .

All of them yield toxic actions at the cell level, directly damaging host cells and tissues. MBP (MBP-1 and MBP-2; major basic protein) of 14 kD, elaborated also by basophils and rich in reactive sulfydryl groups, has no inflammatory property, but via a direct cytotoxic mechanism, has adverse effects extended to mono-and multicellular parasites and to human cells, including bronchial epithelium. MBP produces pomphoid reactions, induces ciliostasis, activates neutrophils and platelets and neutralizes heparin, pro-change is not synonymous with activation [680] , of which a more sensible parameter is LTC 4 synthesis under GM-CSF, IL 3 and IL 5 stimulation [631] . Eosino-vokes degranulation of metachromatic cells and histamine release, making a relevant contribution to the perpetuation of inflammation. A likely cause of its accumulation in AD lesions is the IgE-mediated delayed reaction [593] . In asthmatic patients, it provokes BHR, inhibited in vivo in animal studies by a specific antiserum [294] . MBP is the crystalloid core of secondary granules, while the matrix surrounding it contains other cytotoxic proteins: all are among the more destructive mediators, not released by extrusion from the entire granule (as in the case of mast cell reaction), but following a process of granule exocytosis, unlike PMNs, to kill foreign substances internally [337] . About 90% of granule proteins are represented by EDN (eosinophilderived neurotoxin), or EPX, of 18.6 kD, cytotoxic and neurotoxic, interfering with CMI. EPO (eosinophil peroxidase), consisting of two 15-to 55-kD polypeptides, carries on the same routine as EDN, interferes with coagulation and fibrinolysis, degranulates metachromatic cells and has ribonuclease properties. ECP (eosinophil cationic protein), 18-21 kD, more cytotoxic than EDN and up to tenfold more potent than MBP, degranulates mast cells and has a peroxidase activity [631] . Release of such proteins is selective, because EPO release takes place subsequently to the others, perhaps in different stages of activation. The remaining 10% of proteins are formed by hexagonal and bipyramidal Charcot-Leyden crystals (CLC), present also in basophils. CLCs, first observed in 1872, belong to the type-S lectin superfamily; they can neutralize natural lung surfactants, causing atelectasis [631] . Both eosinophil activation and release of cationic proteins are IgA-mediated [581] , via production of IgA antibodies endorsed by IL 5 , SC binding, and consequent IgA-mediated eosinophil degranulation [572] . If ECP reduces IgA production and alters oral tolerance this could confirm that eosinophil detrimental activity is a prominent pathological feature at the expense of mucosal surfaces. Evidence suggests that eosinophil damaging activity is also committed to their oxidative products, such as reactive O 2 radicals, triggered by PAF and to a higher extent by C5a, while EPO will oxidize a variety of substrates in the presence of H 2 O 2 ( Fig. 1.35b ) [680] , with resulting production of other potent O 2 radicals, among which is singlet O 2 ( 1 O 2 ) [680] . PAF deriving from T lymphocytes is also active on mature cells and on the most potent chemotactic factor for eosinophils also due to O 2 uptake, O 2 \u2022release and iC3b increase in binding capacities [673] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 686, "end": 691, "text": "[680]", "ref_id": "BIBREF691"}, {"start": 788, "end": 793, "text": "[631]", "ref_id": "BIBREF611"}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1028, "text": "[593]", "ref_id": "BIBREF592"}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1136, "text": "[294]", "ref_id": "BIBREF313"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1496, "text": "[337]", "ref_id": "BIBREF337"}, {"start": 2036, "end": 2041, "text": "[631]", "ref_id": "BIBREF611"}, {"start": 2451, "end": 2456, "text": "[631]", "ref_id": "BIBREF611"}, {"start": 2536, "end": 2541, "text": "[581]", "ref_id": "BIBREF580"}, {"start": 2661, "end": 2666, "text": "[572]", "ref_id": "BIBREF571"}, {"start": 3120, "end": 3125, "text": "[680]", "ref_id": "BIBREF691"}, {"start": 3221, "end": 3226, "text": "[680]", "ref_id": "BIBREF691"}, {"start": 3427, "end": 3432, "text": "[673]", "ref_id": "BIBREF684"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3107, "end": 3117, "text": "Fig. 1.35b", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Adhesion molecules"}, {"text": "Recent studies have critically revisited eosinophil phenotypic changes, showing that peripheral cells may be distinguished on the basis of their hypodensity (of sedimentation), chiefly under GM-CSF, IL 3 , IL 5 [631] , C5a and PAF effects [680] (Fig. 1.35c ), but such cells are also found in normal nonatopic subjects [649] . Furthermore, in addition to speed cell survival, the hypodense phenotype can more easily bind to IgE antibodies, thereby appearing more metabolically active with IL 3 intervention and above all with IL 5 [367] . Certainly such Cells of the Immune System Participating phil exposure to activating ILs leads to the development of these hypodense eosinophils, with a specific gravity of <1.085 g/ml. Increased numbers of hypodense eosinophils are found in many allergic disorders, including AR and asthma [46] . In children these hypodense cells may be truly immature (Chap. 11): these findings could explain why ECP levels, activation markers, are not augmented in children compared to adults [367] .

Immature progenitors of human mast cells (SCF=c-kit=CD117) are present in fetal liver cells, bone marrow and CB, enter a peripheral tissue still without secretary granules and cell surface FceR1, and then complete their differentiation probably with multipotential capabilities in connective tissues and mature beneath epithelial tissues and in areas adjacent to blood and lymph vessels, and near or within nerves [168, 509] . Basophils differentiate and mature in the bone marrow and circulate in the bloodstream (CDw17), but only rarely in connective tissues [341] . Basophils develop largely under the influence of IL 3 , a process that is increased by TGF-a [509] . IL 3 present in cultures with CD34 promotes basophil and mast cell development up to 16%-28.5%; however, addition to the medium of GM-CSF and IL 5 reduces the rate to 3%-15% in favor of eosinophils [515] . Mast cells, which Ehrlich called \"overfed cells\" because their cytoplasm is filled with granules [136] , abound in lymphoid organs, connective tissues of most organs, in particular on the epithelium and airway lumen, sensitive to IgE-dependent stimuli, while in blood and lymph there are instead basophils [593] . Mast cells and basophils migrate toward the chemokine gradient at a site of inflammation but stop and accumulate at the site where allergen concentration is high [580] . Both cell types, real biochemical \"powderkegs,\" interact with allergens, degranulate and release mediators with different pharmacological actions, and provoke clinical manifestations of immediate hypersensitivity, such as vascular permeability increase, smooth muscle contraction, epithelial mucus secretion, chemotactic action on eosinophils, and platelet aggregation. Costimulation via FceRI engagement with IgE/antigen and CCR1 engagement with human rCCL3 synergistically enhance the degranulation of metachromatic cells at the site where the cells accumulate, thus playing important roles in the orchestration and focusing of the allergic response. The progression toward chemoattractants requires actin cytoskelton rearrangement and polarization such as formation of leading edge and membrane ruffles [127] . However, FceRI engagement affects CCL3-mediated actin reorganization and chemotaxis of CCR1 cells [580] . Moreover, Rac signaling and/or phos-phatidylinositol (PI)4,5-bisphosphate synthesis by PI 4phosphate 5-kinase I was required for membrane ruffling [127] . Only inflammatory cells provided with cytoplasm granules containing histamine and FceRI [358] , together with other cells, also express FceRII a and b and can up-regulate and aggravate tissue inflammation [509] . Both cells are important sources of CD16 (FcgRIII), C5aR and CD35 [470] . In concert with adhesion molecules and receptors, they mediate the binding to other cells and to ECM gps, including CD49d and 49e/CD29 (b1 integrins), basophils add CD11a, CD11b, CD11c/CD18 (b2), and mast cells CD51/61 (b3) [196] . Metachromatic cells possess high-affinity receptors for IgE (FceRI) and thereby become coated with IgE antiboidies [175] . Activated metachromatic cells produce IL 4 and express CD154, with the immediate consequence that IgE antibody synthesis may also occur in peripheral tissues [174] , even independently of T cells. Therefore these cells are important in AD, asthma, and AR in which allergen binding to the IgE cross-links the FceRI [347] . Several differences call for distinguishing these cells from functional, ontogenetic, histochemical points of view, and the quantity and quality of released mediators: Table 1 .25 [166, 168, 340, 567] shows that differences prevail over analogies also regarding the immune stimuli activating them (Table 1. 26) [340] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 639, "end": 644, "text": "[168,", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}, {"start": 645, "end": 649, "text": "509]", "ref_id": "BIBREF508"}, {"start": 786, "end": 791, "text": "[341]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 887, "end": 892, "text": "[509]", "ref_id": "BIBREF508"}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1098, "text": "[515]", "ref_id": "BIBREF514"}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1203, "text": "[136]", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 1407, "end": 1412, "text": "[593]", "ref_id": "BIBREF592"}, {"start": 1577, "end": 1582, "text": "[580]", "ref_id": "BIBREF579"}, {"start": 2391, "end": 2396, "text": "[127]", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 2497, "end": 2502, "text": "[580]", "ref_id": "BIBREF579"}, {"start": 2652, "end": 2657, "text": "[127]", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 2748, "end": 2753, "text": "[358]", "ref_id": "BIBREF358"}, {"start": 2865, "end": 2870, "text": "[509]", "ref_id": "BIBREF508"}, {"start": 2939, "end": 2944, "text": "[470]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3171, "end": 3176, "text": "[196]", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 3294, "end": 3299, "text": "[175]", "ref_id": "BIBREF174"}, {"start": 3343, "end": 3344, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3460, "end": 3465, "text": "[174]", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}, {"start": 3616, "end": 3621, "text": "[347]", "ref_id": "BIBREF347"}, {"start": 3804, "end": 3809, "text": "[166,", "ref_id": "BIBREF165"}, {"start": 3810, "end": 3814, "text": "168,", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}, {"start": 3815, "end": 3819, "text": "340,", "ref_id": "BIBREF340"}, {"start": 3820, "end": 3824, "text": "567]", "ref_id": "BIBREF566"}, {"start": 3935, "end": 3940, "text": "[340]", "ref_id": "BIBREF340"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3792, "end": 3799, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 3921, "end": 3930, "text": "(Table 1.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Adhesion molecules"}, {"text": "Circulating basophils (Fig. 1.32 than TC and T mast cells) and \u00aa1 pg/cell of histamine, 25% of mast cells [341] .

Despite their short life span and their reduced percentage, they characteristically increase in number in delayed-type responses, matching the rise of histaminemia [46, 332] . Circulating human basophils co-operate with eosinophils by playing a significant role in promoting allergic inflammation through the release of proinflammatory mediators [including ECP, MBP, histamine-releasing factor (HRF), IFN-g, IL 4 , and IL 13 ], capable of potentiating or priming histamine and LTC 4 release [46] , as well as CD203c on blood cells exposed to recombinant allergens (RAs) [200] and represents a ba-sis for a sensitive novel allergy test (Chap. 6). Basophils have several receptors (Tables 1.25, 1.26), and ILs as well as adhesion molecules regulate their chemotaxis [567] . Several chemokines induced chemotaxis at different potencies: eotaxin > SDF-1 > RANTES MCP-1 >> MIP-1 [239] . Their passage from blood vessels to inflamed tissues is correlated with the availability of specialized chemotactic factors, among which are factors of leukocyte derivation, kallikrein, C5a, specific antigens [528] and CD62L [625] . CD44 and CD54 are constitutively expressed on basophils, CD69 expression is preferentially and strongly upregulated by IL 3 [670] . Exposure of basophils to priming stimuli increases their sensitivity to FceRI mediated-activation [46] . Basophil recruitment and activation may be facilitated by the CXCR4-SDR-1 receptor ligand pair [239] . The action of source of IL 4 , above all considering that IL 4 stimulates peripheral monocytes to synthesize IgE antibodies and maybe also additional ILs regulating immune responses of other cells, thus amplifying inflammation. The role of IL 4 produced by basophils is also reflected at the Th2 Tcell level [507] . IL 4 present on endothelial surfaces participates in regulating eosinophil adhesion and selective transmigration as well; therefore eosinophil accumulation in inflammatory sites can be propitiated by activated basophils [506] . A recent study shows that the ability of TLR2 ligands to target basophils not only for IL 4 but also for IL 13 secretion could have relevance to in vivo findings [41] , yet IL 13 early in ontogeny [182] so that they could play an important role in promoting and amplifying the Th2-dependent responses manifest in allergic disease [506] . The best characterized TRL2 ligand, peptidoglycan, directly activated basophils for IL 4 and IL 13 secretion and greatly increased IL and mediator release in response to IgE-dependent activation [41] .

An IgE molecule binds to one FceRI receptor and vice versa: as a result, parallel to a high number of receptors, only one or a few ng of IgE are enough to start mast cell activation. Mast cells are also capable anti-IgE, and in sequence by growth factors including GM-CSF, IL 3 , IL 5 , NGF, IL 8 , IL 18 , IFN, PAF and C3a, drive basophils to release histamine [46, 567, 669] .

In this process, the PAF role is Ca ++ -dependent and -independent of GM-CSF and IL 3 , which up-regulate PAF activity [92] .

Mast cells are stategically located at perivascular sites to trigger inflammatory responses [343] . Increased vascular permeability induced by mast cell-derived tryptase and chymase, and degradation of ECM components by enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) which has been shown to be released from mast cells on activation by T cells also following a possible autocrine regulation by mast cell TNF-a, may further expedite cell migration through barriers including the vascular wall and the blood-brain barrier [347] . These cells, usually absent from blood, are scattered in connective tissue sites throughout the body, and especially around blood vessels and nerve endings in a variable number, between 7,000 and 20,000 cells/mm 3 of tissue [168] . Molecules such as HLA class I and II, CD28, CD54 (ICAM-1), CD154, b 2 -integrins, and TLRs (TLR1 to TLR4, TLR6 and TLR9 [333] ) allow mast cells to interact with other inflammatory cells, thus orchestrating an immune response [347] . MIP-1a may be a costimulatory signal operating via CCR1 for mast cellmediated immediate hypersensitivity reactions [357] . A unique role for mast cells is to produce and release a vast array of mediators such as vasoactive amines, products of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, and several proinflammatory, chemoattractive, and immunomodulatory ILs that may contribute to immune reactions by affecting cell growth, recruitment, and function [476] (see also Innate Immunity). By using complementary DNA microarrays 1-2 hours after cross-linking with FceRI, 2,530 genes exhibited 2-200-fold changes in expression and mast cells were shown to produce 18 ILs, including 130-529 pg of IL 11 /10 6 cells and TNF-a, 13 chemokines, including two CXCL (IL 8 , Gro2) and lymphotactin), ten CCL chemokines and several adhesion molecules [494] . Every human cell isolated from nose, lung, skin and intestine contains on average 2, 2.5-10, 4.6 and 1-2 pg of histamine, respectively [402] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 196, "end": 201, "text": "[347]", "ref_id": "BIBREF347"}, {"start": 387, "end": 392, "text": "[347]", "ref_id": "BIBREF347"}, {"start": 487, "end": 492, "text": "[343]", "ref_id": "BIBREF343"}, {"start": 919, "end": 924, "text": "[347]", "ref_id": "BIBREF347"}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1156, "text": "[168]", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}, {"start": 1279, "end": 1284, "text": "[333]", "ref_id": "BIBREF333"}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1390, "text": "[347]", "ref_id": "BIBREF347"}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1513, "text": "[357]", "ref_id": "BIBREF357"}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1838, "text": "[476]", "ref_id": "BIBREF456"}, {"start": 2218, "end": 2223, "text": "[494]", "ref_id": "BIBREF493"}, {"start": 2361, "end": 2366, "text": "[402]", "ref_id": "BIBREF402"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Adhesion molecules"}, {"text": "Mast cells have been identified as a potential source of MBP [376] . Moreover, IL 11 mRNA was co-localized with MBP in inflammatory cells in the subepithelial layer of the airway in subjects with severe asthma [354] . This raises the possibility that both mast cells and eosinophils represent sources of IL 11 in asthma [354, 494] . Studies in rodents have revealed two mast cell phenotypes, called T or TC, being associated either with mucosal and connective tissue or with both tryptase and chymase (35 and 4 pg/cell) or, respectively, only tryptase (10 pg/cell) [168] . Apparently, T mast cell maturation, but not the TC phenotype, requires the help of IL 3 [509] and in vitro IL 1 , IL 3 -IL 6 , GM-CSF, IFN-g, which do not elicit histamine release as for basophils, as well as chemokines such as MIP-1a and -1b [168] . IL 1 , IL 3 , GM-CSF, MCAF (monocyte chemotactic and activating factor), = MCP-1 and RANTES; IL 4 and TNF-a induce adhesion molecules on vascular endothelium in injured sites, a first step for inflammatory cell migration such as lymphocytes and granulocytes [420] . Also, the expression on the mast cell surface of integrins linked to the FN receptor causes their activation [420] : FN binds to b1 integrins including CD49a, CD49c, CD49d, CD49e, and CD49f/CD29, playing a fundamental role when both IgE and antigen levels are low in local microenvironments [420] , whereas FceRI aggregation to cells adherent to FN specifically amplifies the phosphorylation of such proteins [195] . Signal transduction obtained in such a way by FceRI looks like that of TcR/CD3 in T cells. We mention that antigen binding to FceRI-IgE brings about the degranulation of metachromatic cells, thus initiating reactions of immediate hypersensitivity; however, mast cells can undergo forms of non-IgE-mediated signals from their environment (Chap. 10). Table 1 .27 [227] summarizes several differences between T and TC mast cells on the basis of tissue prevalence. In humans, somewhat different phenotypes have been recognized; in addition, mast cells residing in the airways contain mostly tryptase, and those of other locations both proteases [227] . Their predilection to occupy tissues that interface the external environment makes them well represented in inflamed tissues under T-cell functional control through IL 3 (proliferation) and IL 4 (maturation) [593] . Under the influence of IL 3 , IL 4 and NGF, T mast cells may assume characteristics of the TC phenotype; therefore, one may consider the distinction into two types nearly obsolete, with both phenotypes potentially coexisting in the same site, although in different proportions. Furthermore, it has been suggested that mast cells in unrelated locations respond to allergens with the same pattern of mediators [227] . As a consequence, mast cells are strategically positioned to [680]. Platelets interact with the immune system via FceRII (in 10%-30% of healthy and in 50%-60% of atopic subjects), FcgRII (CD32), the VLA-2, -5 and -6 integrins, ensuring adhesion mechanisms among immunocompetent cells and CD62P [65] . Activation of FceRII elicits PAF production and an IgE-dependent platelet activation, which is not expressed as the classic aggregation, but by secretion of O 2 toxic radicals, triggered by SP, CRP (C-reactive protein), IFN-g and TNF.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 61, "end": 66, "text": "[376]", "ref_id": "BIBREF394"}, {"start": 210, "end": 215, "text": "[354]", "ref_id": "BIBREF354"}, {"start": 320, "end": 325, "text": "[354,", "ref_id": "BIBREF354"}, {"start": 326, "end": 330, "text": "494]", "ref_id": "BIBREF493"}, {"start": 565, "end": 570, "text": "[168]", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}, {"start": 659, "end": 660, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 661, "end": 666, "text": "[509]", "ref_id": "BIBREF508"}, {"start": 816, "end": 821, "text": "[168]", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1087, "text": "[420]", "ref_id": "BIBREF419"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1204, "text": "[420]", "ref_id": "BIBREF419"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1386, "text": "[420]", "ref_id": "BIBREF419"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1504, "text": "[195]", "ref_id": "BIBREF195"}, {"start": 1868, "end": 1873, "text": "[227]", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 2148, "end": 2153, "text": "[227]", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 2364, "end": 2369, "text": "[593]", "ref_id": "BIBREF592"}, {"start": 2405, "end": 2406, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2780, "end": 2785, "text": "[227]", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 3082, "end": 3086, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1856, "end": 1863, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Adhesion molecules"}, {"text": "Also prominent is the portfolio of chemokines that attract these cells to a site of inflammation, such as a-chemokines (CXCL), b-family (CCL), including eotaxin, Gro-a, RANTES, TARC, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), and SC-derived factor 1 (SCDF1), and chemokine receptors, such as CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CCL13, CCL17, and CCL22, activate platelets to give Ca(++) signals, aggregation, and release of granule content [87] . The inappropriate platelet activation materializes with eosinophil recruitment on the sites of immune inflammation, TGF-b secretion with mitogen activity towards bronchial smooth muscles, PF4 released during asthmatic attacks and PDGF triggering fibroblast proliferation. So platelets can be involved in the onset and perpetuation of structural alterations underlying subepithelial fibrosis, which contribute to emphasize BHR. Two series of experiments account for what we discussed earlier: platelets from patients with asthma from ASA (acetylsalicylic acid) or NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) incubated with SP, PCR, IFN-g and TNF start the release of O 2 radicals.

Classically thought to originate in the bone marrow from cytoplasm of megakaryocytes, it has recently been suggested that actually megakaryocytes travel to lung vessels, where they are physically fragmented into small clumps of granules, each of which is a platelet. These are the smallest blood cells, anucleated (2 mm in diameter), with a half-life of about 10 days. Platelets have been shown to express HLA class I molecules on their surface, IgG receptors (CD32), IgE (CD23), vitronectin (CD51), CD9, CD17, CD31 (GPIIa), CD36 (GPIIIb), CD41a (GPIIb/IIIa), CD42a-d (platelet antigens), CD49f, CD60, CD61 and CD63 (Table 1. 2). Human platelet antigens (HPA) are at least 15: PHA 1-15 [298] . When activated, together with aggregation they undergo morphological modifications, secrete PAF, cytotoxic cationic proteins and free radicals. Moreover, platelets release 5-HT from dense bodies, which like histamine produce contraction of smooth muscles, increase vascular permeability and produce proteolytic enzymes and cationic substances from a granules with equal effects on blood vessels, in addition to chemotactic factors including PF4 (platelet factor 4), PDGF, 12-HETE, NO (nitric oxide), TGF-a and -b, albumin, b-thromboglobulin, eicosanoids (PGG 2 , PGH 2 , TXA 2 , and CD62P), allowing binding to fibrinogen, FN and CD51. Consequently, platelets, although confined in the vascular compartment, also acting by diapedesis, can release mediators active in inflammatory extravascular foci. However, their specific role in inflammatory reactions is not well defined as it is for other cells: if activated, they also have chemotactic and phagocytic properties and contribute to immune reactions, releasing growth and coagulation factors, vasoactive amines and lipids as well as acid and neutral hydrolases. Following platelet aggregation, abnormal agglomerates develop and recruiting and entrapping leukocytes may contribute to the start of an endovascular occlusion. The human PMN adhesion to vascular endothelial cells was increased by the platelet presence. This effect was endothelial cell dependent and involved platelet activation. Thus platelet participation in cell recruitment occurs at the circulation level and might involve leukocyte priming for subsequent adhesion and transmigration into tissues [430] . Platelets produce enzymes cleaving C5, thus resulting in C5a, with a marked chemotactic activity for neutrophils: this is most likely the establishment of an active form of cooperation for the production of new mediators. C5a can prime mast cell degradation, while C5b-9 participate in the non-lytic platelet activation", "cite_spans": [{"start": 74, "end": 79, "text": "[405]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 824, "end": 829, "text": "[298]", "ref_id": "BIBREF317"}, {"start": 2450, "end": 2455, "text": "[430]", "ref_id": "BIBREF429"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 754, "end": 763, "text": "(Table 1.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Additional Cells"}, {"text": "Myeloid DCs are crucial APCs for primary T-cell responses: tissue-resident immature DCs are excellent at internalizing and processing antigen, but they exhibit a low ability to stimulate naive T cells [88] . DCs encompass a heterogeneous group of cells present either in lymphoid tissues such as thymic DCs and FDCs or in parenchymal organs such as IDCs, circulating and/ or cutaneous LCs. Moreover, several chemokine receptors in CD4 + lymphocytes are primed by DCs (see Chemokines) [88] . LCs arise from bone marrow precursors that colonize peripheral tissues through the blood or lymph, according to recent data, a line common to macrophages [424] , which modulated by GM-CSF and TNF-a [221, 546] leads to two precursors identified by CD1a and CD14, both maturating into LCs and, respectively, DCs or macrophages depending on IL influence [74] . Activation causes DCs to up-regulate the CSMs expression (CD80 and CD86) on their surface. CSMs provide the signals necessary for lymphocyte activation in addition to those provided through the antigen receptor [115] . Circulating conventinal DCs coexpress and IFN-g most potently favors activating CD32a, whereas soluble anti-inflammatory concentrations of monomeric IgG express inhibitory CD32b, both isoforms of IgG FcgR II (CD32). Ligating complexed human IgG to CD32a matures and activates DCs in proportion to the frequency of CD32a expression. However, coligation of CD32b significantly abrogates all of these immunogenic functions. These findings have important implications for understanding the pathophysiology of CIC disease and for optimizing the efficacy of therapeutic mAbs [48] . DCs produce a wealth of ILs: immature DCs exhibited higher amounts of IL 1 , TNF, TGF-1, and MIF mRNA/ protein than mature DCs. After differentiation, DCs up-regulated the levels of IL 6 and IL 15 mRNA/protein and synthesized de novo mRNA/protein for IL 12 p 30 and p 40 and IL 18 . CD1a precursors generate cells expressing Birbeck granules and E cadherin characteristic of LCs, while CD14 progenitors mature into CD2, CD9, CD14, CD68 and factor XIIIa, specific of dermal DCs [74] . DCs, described as localized in the suprabasal layer of epidermis, represent in the adult only 2%-8% of epidermal cells, sharing with dendritic lymph nodes several phenotypic and functional features [454] . Although immature bone-marrow-derived DCs did not stimulate naive allogenic T cells, mature DCs elicited a mixed population of Th1 (mainly) and Th2 cells. The DC subset may contribute significant polarizing influence on Th differentiation and the CD subset 1 may exert Th1 polarization by IL 12 production and STAT4 activation [366] . Growth and differentiation of LCs and their migration delineate a crucial step in the immune surveillance of foreign antigens invading the host [221, 546] . LCs via afferent lymphatics reach the paracortical areas of regional lymph nodes as FDC with APC function; thereby they are the first cells to trap antigens, which are then internalized and processed at the level of target cells [541] , then presented in draining lymph nodes to upcoming T cells stimulated by the same DCs [546] . In comparison, DCs are strategically located below the M cells of PPs, thus sampling antigens in vivo and migrating to T-cell areas of the same PP or mesenteric lymph nodes, where they present antigen to naive T lymphocytes [253] . LCs migrate quite rapidly after having taken up a peptide, present a rounded phenotype with long cytoplasmic protrusions rhythmically moved, hence assuming the aspect of veiled cells [541] (Fig. 1.38 ). FDCs returned in paracortical areas as APCs, having a poor expression of HLA class II molecules, present the same peptide processed over several days [541] or months [37] , also contributing to long-term maintenance of memory B cells [37] . FDC maturation due to an increased presence of CD80 or CD86, and enhanced by CD40, is stimulated until FDCs encounter T cells [424] . To understand the role of DCs in antigen presentation and processing, we mention that DCs select potential antigens taking up microbial glycoconjugates by means of specialized receptors. An in vitro model has demonstrated that PBMCs, in GM-CSF and IL 4 -dependent cultures, develop into DCs that are extremely efficient as APCs, a property lost when treated with TNF-a [487] . LCs are thought to play a key role in enhancing immunogenicity since their first identification, because they express FceRI binding to IgE, and pick up antigens in vivo even before presentation, and like they other APCs process antigens, degrading them into peptides that become approximately six to eight amino acids in size with a low MW [384] . The evidence that LCs also possess FceRII [40] implies a major role in view of their significant activity shown in atopic diseases [546] . Table 1 .28 [208, 424] summarizes their markers, denot- [34] . This picture is integrated by a variety of actively trafficking cells such as lymphocytes, APCs, adhesion molecules, etc. [28] . T lymphocytes cooperate in the induction of immune responses influencing the up-regulation of B cell progenitors of IgE-secreting cells (Fig. 1.39) .

CGRP calcitonin gene-related peptide. [47] . HLA-G has been recently characterized as TAP-associated, which directs its expression and binding to nonameric peptides [293] ; HLA-G expression on target cells protects from NK-mediated lysis interacting with NKR [419], of special significance pertaining to maternofetal tolerance. Classic studies have shown that immune responses consist in the production of antibodies, up-regulated stimulating CD4 lymphocyte activation, but may be down-regulated when CD8 cells predominate. Non-self substances that have gained access to sites patrolled by the immune system enter automatically in contact with it, thus activating a complex mechanism of cellular activity aimed at its destruction and at restoration of preexistent homeostasis. Therefore, immunogen peptides encountering lymphocytes of an atopic individual for the first time trigger a multiple pathway of cell interactions ensuring that B lymphocytes differentiate into antibody-secreting cells [601] . As soon as an invader is identified by two different immune effector mechanisms, antibodies (humoral effector limb) and TcR (cellmediated effector limb), the foreign antigen is captured by APCs, the peptide-HLA complex is recognized by TcR, then internalized and processed in fragments subsequently exposed on the cell surface in association with class II HLA molecules. Thus the interaction between antigen-specific T and B cells (cognate interaction) and consequent IL release result in the activation of lymphocytes [290] . A theory of two signals is suggested also for the T cells: accordingly, Th0 T cells receive the first signal from the TcR triggered by pathogen-derived antigenic peptides bound to HLA class II molecules on APCs, which indicates the peptide molecular identity. Signal 2 delivered from costimulatory molecules (CSM) comprises contact-dependent and humoral signals and transmits the information about the DC-activating property of invading pathogens, reflecting its pathogenic potential. The combination of signal 1 and signal 2 results in Ag-specific activation of naive Th cells and their development into effector/memory cells [290] . A Th0 signal might provide a further refining cadence, whereby the IL milieu produced by DCs provides naive T helper cells with a Th1-or Th2-polarizing signal at the time of priming [212] .Activated T cells differentiate into Th2 T-cell clones, which secrete low amounts of IL 4 , thought to play a crucial role in IgE isotype switching. The resulting IgE low levels can be captured by highaffinity receptors on the mast cell surface [290] . Thereby the first exposure to an immunogen leads to the production of antigen-specific IgE and priming of the immune system (primary immune response), an event preventing a second encounter via the CD8 + class I HLA-restricted immune deviation (Fig. 1.40 ) [212] . In immunologically healthy neonates and infants, such initial responses, an integral part of normal immune responses, are self-limited and gradually resolve, after weeks or months, despite continuous allergen exposures, due to the development of tolerance [250] . In healthy, uncommitted subjects, membrane-bound IgG forms immune complexes with allergens. IgG is tethered to the membrane by binding the Fc fragment of FceRIIb. When an allergen binds both IgE and IgG, the activating FceRI is brought together with the inhibitory FceRIIb, thereby silencing the FceRI-mediated activation pathway [259] . According to this model, following subsequent exposures, CD4 clones from nonatopic individuals have a Th1 profile, whereas in atopic patients they can lead to an immediate hypersensitivity reaction (secondary immune response). Antigen persistence or reexposure leads to ongoing antibody production, which is outstanding, rapid, more specific Fig. 1.40 .

(Modified from [212] ) pressed on the cell membrane in the fitting pocket of HLA class II molecules (a genetic restriction mechanism) (Fig. 1.22 ). Such complexes are as firm and as high as the peptide affinity for the hypervariable part of HLA molecules; such adhesion is mediated by CD2, CD11a/ CD18, CD54, CD58, and other integrins and selectins [534] . The cells expose peptide fragments assembled with HLA class I or II molecules, so that they are examined by circulating T cells, which, although relatively few in view of the great number of potential antigens, and of their great diversity, are conditioned to recognize those they encounter [34] . The affinity for peptides depends on the amino acid sequence of hypervariable regions and consequently on the HLA molecules that everybody inherits. TcR and HLA interactions are characterized by a high-sensitivity and low-affinity paradox, which is only a small number of TcRs that interact with APCs [595] . On the contrary, APCs are fit for almost any foreign invader encountered by the immune system, thus raising a very intriguing question of how so few receptors can transduce an activation signal [225] . It remains to be elucidated how as few as 80-100 HLA-foreign peptide complexes on the cell surface (which may express as many as 10 5 HLA molecules) are sufficient to trigger a T-cell response [47] : the answer lies in the capacity of a single peptide-HLA complex to serially engage and trigger up to \u00aa 200 TcR, amplifying the signal according to T-cell biological responses [595] . C3b plays a critical role in at least two phases of recognition, as shown by the T clone response to presentation of C3b-Ig complexes. The uptake of such complexes is helped by the interactions with complement receptors virtually present on all APCs; furthermore, C3 covalent binding to specific antigen peptides can define, during the processing, which part of the molecule is selected as epitope presented to T cells [359] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 197, "end": 202, "text": "[208]", "ref_id": "BIBREF228"}, {"start": 227, "end": 232, "text": "[424]", "ref_id": "BIBREF423"}, {"start": 273, "end": 277, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 400, "end": 405, "text": "[293]", "ref_id": "BIBREF312"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1235, "text": "[601]", "ref_id": "BIBREF619"}, {"start": 1757, "end": 1762, "text": "[290]", "ref_id": "BIBREF309"}, {"start": 2392, "end": 2397, "text": "[290]", "ref_id": "BIBREF309"}, {"start": 2582, "end": 2587, "text": "[212]", "ref_id": "BIBREF232"}, {"start": 2834, "end": 2839, "text": "[290]", "ref_id": "BIBREF309"}, {"start": 3099, "end": 3104, "text": "[212]", "ref_id": "BIBREF232"}, {"start": 3363, "end": 3368, "text": "[250]", "ref_id": "BIBREF250"}, {"start": 3701, "end": 3706, "text": "[259]", "ref_id": "BIBREF259"}, {"start": 4374, "end": 4379, "text": "[212]", "ref_id": "BIBREF232"}, {"start": 4708, "end": 4713, "text": "[534]", "ref_id": "BIBREF553"}, {"start": 5007, "end": 5011, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 5315, "end": 5320, "text": "[595]", "ref_id": "BIBREF594"}, {"start": 5517, "end": 5522, "text": "[225]", "ref_id": "BIBREF206"}, {"start": 5718, "end": 5722, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 5900, "end": 5905, "text": "[595]", "ref_id": "BIBREF594"}, {"start": 6327, "end": 6332, "text": "[359]", "ref_id": "BIBREF359"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3086, "end": 3096, "text": "(Fig. 1.40", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 4051, "end": 4060, "text": "Fig. 1.40", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 4493, "end": 4503, "text": "(Fig. 1.22", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Antigen Processing and Presentation"}, {"text": "Recognition of immunogenic proteins in their natural configuration is not sufficient to stimulate B lymphocytes to differentiate into plasma cell IgE, since switching steps requires T lymphocyte cooperation, which materializes via IL 2 production; so B cells and APC interaction within TcR presentation of peptide-HLA complexes involve antigen specificity and consequently B lymphocyte capacity to bind to and present peptides, even if their extracellular number is reduced. At the level of peripheral lymphoid tissues, where antigen concentration is greater, other APCs are involved in antigen processing and presentation background. The first step of B-cell activation requires signals generated upon recognition of antigen by the BcR as well as additional signals provided by cognate interaction with T cells, including the CD40-CD154 interaction [201] . Following peptide-HLA complex recognition on the B-cell surface by TcR, T cells deliver appropriate activating signals to B cells (cognate help); hence T cell-B cell cooperation begins, class II-restricted and antigen-specific, with formation of tightly associated conjugates [457] . Such conjugates result from peptide-HLA complex presentation from B cells; fur-and enduring with different functional features, dominated by Th2 T cells and IgE, an expression of immune memory [212] .

To proliferate, the cells must re-enter the G 1 phase, where several proteins undergo a substantial process of biosynthesis, so these cells grow in size and prepare for DNA synthesis. In the S stage, DNA synthesis and replication of each chromosome bring about two matching sister chromatids. The subsequent G 2 and M (mitotic) phases involve the two sister separations, generation of two new nuclei, and final division of the cytoplasm to produce two daughter cells: growth factors and different environmental stimuli are required for cell cycle progression, depending on the cell type [337] . There are several functional differences between T and B cells and recent work has focused on their mutual interactions: T lymphocytes have a variety of signals allowing them to leave the circulation and enter tissues to reach the site of antigen exposure, both because they constitute the prevalent portion of peripheral lymphocytes and they have the central feature to recirculate. Instead, B cells encounter preferably native macromolecules in situ, in specialized organs and tissues; however, in an antigenindependent phase of B-cell development, it is likely that B cells do not require interactions with antigens, which will be ultimately recognized by soluble antibodies subsequently synthesized [481] . Both T and B cells need to be stimulated before acquiring the capacity of responding to specific antigens, T cells by their clonally restricted TcR and B cells by Igs, or in T-independent polyclonal systems or molecules with mitogenic properties, both experimentally and physiologically [326] . We also note some biochemical similarities in B and T cell activation: as an antigen binds to an APC, a series of defined events occur over a period of several hours. Within a few seconds, the phosphorylation of cell proteins takes place, mostly associated with CD3e and z and CD79a and b receptors and membrane phospholipid cleavage. A cascade of protein activation in regulated sequence and the rise of Ca ++ levels occur. As a result of these early activation events, TFs such as NFAT 1, 2 and NF-kB are activated to enter the B cell nucleus and promote transcription of nontranscribed specific genes. In ther enhancement of cognate interactions depends on CD54 binding to CD11a/CD18 and CD4 to monomorphic domains of class II proteins [391] . Engagement of both the BcR and CD40 results in synergistic activation of B cells [201] . CD4 T cells bind to antigen-specific B lymphocytes; the associative recognition induces B-cell activation, clonal expansion, and differentiation, while cell division goes on as long as T cells stimulate it. Mature plasma cells are generated and secrete specific receptors, the mIgs, which bind to antigens present in the bloodstream [457] . Previous studies suggested that binding to TRAF2 and/or TRAF3 but not TRAF6 is essential for CD40 isotype switching and activation in B cells [232] . More recently a model was presented in which Btk contributes to the enhancement of the CD40 response by TRAF2 in a BCR-activated protein kinase D (PKD)-dependent manner [201] . Superantigens (SA) are antigens able to select subsets of T cells during thymic ontogenesis, playing an important role in T cell development: an example is given by bacterial toxins, some of which can be mitogen for some T cell subsets. Such SAs bypass key antigen processing and recognition steps in T cell activation, by binding more or less exclusively to lateral exposed surfaces of HLA class II molecules and TcR determinants of the Vb region (HVb-4), that is, not to a normal paratope. As a result of this sidestep they are able to activate greater proportions of lymphocytes, not 1/10 4 or 1/10 5 , as with usual antigens, but whole clones up to 30% of T lymphocytes, thus amplifying their activity, and functioning as a bridge between T cells-HLA and accessory cells [275] . Figure 1.41 shows a polyclonal activation of T cells, which recognize both conventional peptides with Va and Vb regions, and SAs essentially with an area of the Vb region [275] .

Due to TcR binding to extracellular V regions, modulated by CD3z, also following second-messenger generation, TcR transduces signals initiating biochemical and conformational changes. Intracellular signals generated by TcR and transmitted to T cells appear, therefore, to be critical for proper T cell maturation and activation [276] . Transduction of activating signals by CD3-CD28 costimulation initiates multiple signaling cascades that lead to the activation of several TFs, including the activation of NF-kB family members [276] . TcR-CD3 stimulation alone is not sufficient to optimally activate NF-kB because its requires Bc110, a CARD associated with CARMA1 (CARD11) [504] , a member of the CARD family also including CARMA2 (CARD14) and CARMA3 (CARD10) [621] . The CARD family also encompasses CARD/NOD a member of the ced-4 superfamily also including APAF-1, mammalian NOD-LRR (leucine rich repeat) proteins and CARD15/NOD2, which in turn act in LPS recognition and activate NF-kB [79] that is depressed in patients with Crohn's disease [621] . Prominent in this context is G protein participation with a manifold role in cellular signal transduction coupling an array of receptors at the cell surface with a variety of intracellular effectors exposed to the plasma membrane's inner surface that couple a large family of receptors to effectors, such as adenylcyclase, PLC, and ion channels [292] . The large heterotrimer G proteins have 21 Ga subunits, which are related to small G proteins, plus five Gb and six Gg that exist as a single complex (Gbg). Gas are stimulated by GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins) and Gbg by RGS (regulators of G protein signaling) [231] . In the resting state, guanosine diphosphate (GDP) is tightly bound to Ga. When a membrane receptor is activated by binding of a first messenger, this causes GDP to dissociate from Ga and be rapidly replaced by guanosine triphosphate (GTP). GPT binding leads the Ga subunit to dissociate from Gbg, each of them can independently transmit signals, hence activating effector cells (active state). In a subsequent phase, hydrolysis of GTP to GDP inactivates Ga, allowing it to reassociate with Gbg (inactive state) and reset stable heterotrimers. Gbg subunit binding to several components of the Ga subfamily could open up a new communication pathway among second messengers [292] . Considering this activity, G proteins oscillate between GPT-and/or GDP-bound states, and regulate diverse processes, including signal transduction [24] . G proteins also belong to a superfamily comprising a number of receptors; however, the amount of G proteins bound by a given receptor is reduced, practically restricting to one G protein signaling to one receptor. One of the best characterized among signal transduction systems is an increased formation and accumulation of intracellular cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) as a result of b-adrenergic receptor stimulation; further receptor/ligand interactions enhance Ga3 activity due to Ga3/GTP dissociation from Gbg. Correspondingly, the activation of the enzyme chain of membrane adenylyl cyclase catalyzes cAMP synthesis in Mg ion presence. Returning G protein to its initial conformation the enzyme is inactivated, while cAMP is converted to noncyclic inactive 5-AMP by cAMP-PDE (phosphodiesterase) constitutive activity; otherwise other receptors activate another G protein, Gi, which binds to adenylyl cyclase to block enzyme activity [326] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 494, "end": 499, "text": "[276]", "ref_id": "BIBREF276"}, {"start": 694, "end": 699, "text": "[276]", "ref_id": "BIBREF276"}, {"start": 841, "end": 846, "text": "[504]", "ref_id": "BIBREF503"}, {"start": 928, "end": 933, "text": "[621]", "ref_id": "BIBREF601"}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1161, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1218, "text": "[621]", "ref_id": "BIBREF601"}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1571, "text": "[292]", "ref_id": "BIBREF311"}, {"start": 1837, "end": 1842, "text": "[231]", "ref_id": "BIBREF212"}, {"start": 2516, "end": 2521, "text": "[292]", "ref_id": "BIBREF311"}, {"start": 2671, "end": 2675, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3623, "end": 3628, "text": "[326]", "ref_id": "BIBREF326"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of T Lymphocytes"}, {"text": "Direct evidence suggests that, depending on the type of related cells, cAMP, a second messenger present only inside the cells, plays a role in enzyme phosphorylation, Ca++ levels increase, also affecting both gene expression and further endocellular processes [292] . In addition, the CD3z cytoplasmic domain interacts with two families of tyrosine kinases such as PTK of the src and syk (intracytoplasmic) families (Tables 1.31, 1.32) [157, 214, 222, 240] . Some PTK src are associated via the SH2 domain with ARAM or ITAM sequences of intracellular regions of g d e chains of CD3 as well as a and b (CD79a and CD79b) of BcR and z or g of CD16. To fulfill G protein effects on CD4/CD8 T cells [292] , within a few seconds GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP; a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, ZAP70 (z-associated protein 70), belonging to the syk family, becomes active upon attachment to the TcR-CD3 complex [213] and in turn activates PLCg1 [462] . The important result of PKC is PLCg1 activation, which then acts to hydrolyze PIP2 into IP3 (inositoltrisphosphate) and DAG [462] . IP3 and DAG serve as second messengers of the T-cell activation process: IP3 with a short half-life rapidly increases cytoplasmic Ca++ levels; however, in the absence of additional signals there is no activation [337] . DAG has been shown to activate PKC, a process leading to its translocation to the activate members of the src family of kinases, a likely basis for the requirements of antigen-induced receptor signaling [395, 584] .

CN also regulates NFAT activity and contains a binding site for one of its components ( Fig. 1.42 ) [457] . In particular, CD3z phosphorylation appears to be the signal for ZAP70 binding to CD3 ARAM [462] . The significance of ZAP70 in such processes is demonstrated by its deficiency in a form of SCID characterized by the absence of CD8 T cells [544] , emphasizing its prominence in T lymphocyte intrathymic selection and not only in mature cell activation. CD45 (CLA) is associated with T-and B-cell activation processes: for example, CD4-mediated signals are enhanced by cross-linking to CD45, with a rapid rise in Ca++ levels, an effect mediated by Ca++-independent PTPase activity of two domains within the CD45 cytoplasmic tail [584] . On the contrary, CD45 direct interactions with the TcR-CD3 complex could lead to dephosphorylation of CD3z and a down-regulation of the response [337] .

CD2 enhances antigen recognition drawing TcRs into zones of cell-cell contacts also arranging the opposing cell membranes of both T cells and APCs at the optimal distance, thus promoting TcR-peptide-HLA interactions. Thus CD2 can allow lower affinity TcRs to be utilized, thereby increasing the size of the mature T-cell repertoire [109] . CD58 for B cells stimulated by IL 4 and CD2 for T cells can provide a second signal for isotype switching to IgE; CD58 can only cross-bind to anti-CD58 lower than that of CD40 [243] . CD2 could also mediate an alternative pathway of T activation if aggregated to the TcR-CD3 complex [109] : it is postulated that molecules different from CD40L are involved in IgE synthesis. Further molecules are CD28 (expressed by the B-cell majority and CD4 as well as by \u00aa 50% of CD8 T cells) and CD152 is = CTLA-4 (present only on activated T cells), whose interactions with CD80 and CD86, main ligands for CD28/CD152, represent a very important costimulatory membrane signal for T-cell activation and are crucial for both proliferation and differentiation of T-cell effector functions [243] . Studies have also hypothesized that both ligands could follow a different model in regulating T-cell differentiation, CD86 to Th2 T cell production with IL 4 predominance and CD80 to Th1 T cell phenotype [279] . Skin CSMs are keratinocytes coming on stage when external factors shift the immunological balance toward an epithelial sphere of influence. Cells expressing CD80 can have a pivotal role in triggering immune responses, delivering costimulatory signals to resting T cells and modulating their maturation into Th2 T cells [279] . Lack of such a strategy can depend on intrinsic differences of class II HLA molecules (that is, li reduction), rather than on defects of CSM potential [381] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 440, "end": 445, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 624, "end": 629, "text": "[243]", "ref_id": "BIBREF243"}, {"start": 731, "end": 736, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1227, "text": "[243]", "ref_id": "BIBREF243"}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1439, "text": "[279]", "ref_id": "BIBREF279"}, {"start": 1761, "end": 1766, "text": "[279]", "ref_id": "BIBREF279"}, {"start": 1920, "end": 1925, "text": "[381]", "ref_id": "BIBREF399"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Costimulatory Molecules"}, {"text": "At first glance, the B cell first stage of activation is in the T cell area, the splenic PALS, then proliferating cells form GCs (Fig. 1.43 ). In the superficial cortical zone there are primary follicles, lymphoid aggregates of uniform cellular density, with mature resting B lymphocytes probably not yet stimulated by antigens, and secondary follicles containing GCs, proliferated in response to antigen stimulation. GCs are characterized by a central dark zone proximal to T areas, containing many rapidly dividing B cells failing to express surface Igs, the centroblasts [37] , and a basal light zone filled with centrocytes, non-dividing B Ig + lymphocytes [254] . The GC reaction reaches a peak volume by day 10-12 after immunization, when PALS ( Fig. 1.11 ) start to decline; without further antigen stimulation GCs also gradually regress until they wane around 4 weeks after immunization [37] . In GCs there are macrophages with phagocytic activity and IDCs deriving from tissue homologous cells, among which are also DCs. Naive B cells come into contact with antigens presented by DCs in the GC light zone: within a few hours B cells interact with specific CD4 cells; their proliferation reaches the apex by day 5, followed by their migration into lymphoid follicles or other peripheral sites [454] . Exponential proliferation of a given B clone leads to thousands of antibodies/min in 3-4 days that are secreted outside GCs [254] . During the course of primary response, isotype switching occurs in centroblasts, and somatic mutations accumulate in V H and V L regions [63] ; by day 10 of the response, GCs are clearly divided into dark and light zones [37] . In the dark zone, at about 2 days B blasts differentiate into mIg-negative centroblasts which collect at one pole adjacent to the FDC network, which a little later fills up with centrocytes [37] . Studies suggested that in the apical light zone centroblasts differentiate into memory cells (small lymphocytes) or plasma cells with T-cell cooperation [256] . When FDCs form their protrusions embracing B cells to present bound antigens to BcR, the process is exhausted and plasmocytes migrate into the medulla and eventually the bone marrow, where they undergo a terminal differentiation [256] . Interestingly, light zone centrocytes re-enter the dark zone, join the centroblast population and reinitiate proliferation, with high affinity for phosphorylate tyrosine residues, binding those from CD79a and CD79b [453] . Two pathways are involved in IL 4 -mediated Ce transcription: the one associated with PLCg1, leading to PKCd translocation with cooperation of IP3, PIP2 and DAG, and the other based on PIK3 and PKCz [659] . A growing body of evidence indicates that FcgR in B cells inhibits their activation and Ig production [337] . If properly glycosylated, CD45 may interact with CD22, an important step for cell-cell adhesion [395] , which has been shown to regulate the B cell phosphatases, also regulating T cell activation. As a result of this sequence of events, 12 h after the antigenic stimulation, the blasts increase in size and, if they receive appropriate signals from T cells, proliferate and differentiate in plasma cells [36] . As we have mentioned, B cells can be at the center of antigen-independent responses, which occur early in the B cell developmental pathway and can be induced by the association of H chains with CD79b in B cells that develop to the pre-B cell stage even in the absence of L chain synthesis [408] . whereas T-B collaboration in the light zone is necessary to maintain active GC reactions [256] . A principal purpose of GC formation is to direct VDJ rearrangement, and mutated Igs are first observed on day 7-10 of primary responses, coincident with GC polarization and CD86 expression on centrocytes [254] . T-cell-B-cell interactions involve signaling via CD40 and CD154 (CD40L), found in the outer zone of tonsillar GCs [71] . Inhibition of this signaling pathway also impairs GC formation [71] . Markers and/or participants in the activation process are CD19 and CD20 expressed at all stages of differentiation, CD21 (CR2) and CD22 expressed only by mature B cells; IgE + antibodies instead express CD5 ligand of CD72, CD32, CD38, CD45RA and CD45RO (Table 1. 2). CD19 interactions with BcR markedly lower the threshold (100 antigen receptors per cell, 0.03% of total) to enable B cell activation [70] , as they are consequently processed, degraded into peptides, and transported to the cell surface associated with HLA molecules [384] . Independently of signals mediated or not by T cells, BcR internalization does not require ITAM participation [453] . B cell activation by CD79a and CD79b involves triggering src and syk, which form molecular mechanisms able to transduce activation signals generated by interactions between antigen and epitope [408] . However, so that the B cell functions as an effective APC, CD80 and CD86 coexpression is necessary, while it is absent in resting B cells. Upon BcR cross-linking, PTK src are activated, tyrosine residues are phosphorylated in the ITAM, while syk is required for BcR communication with PLCg1, IP3 generated via PIK3 activation, and Ca ++ release [453] .

GATA-3 is expressed primarily in T lymphocytes and in the embryonic brain. Functionally important GATA-3-binding sites have been identified in TcR genes and the CD8 gene [342] . Significantly, Th2 cells contain GATA-3 protein in a constitutive fashion, which increases upon stimulation of the cells by antigen or cAMP, whereas Th1 cells express very little or no GATA-3 at the basal level [678] . T-bet, a TF member of the T-box family expressed in T cells is necessary to induce T cells to differentiate into Th1 cells and for Th1 cells to produce IFN-g. Since IFN-g induces T-bet expression, it is possible that IFN-g affects T-bet expression by Th1 cells. Mice lacking T-bet do not have a functional Th1 response in vivo [556] , and recent studies stress that T-bet expression is downregulated in asthmatic patients [155] . Further, T-bet enhances IFN-g secretion and suppresses IL 4 secretion in gd cells, and GATA-3 fails to counterbalance T-bet-mediated IFN-g production, accounting for the default synthesis of IFN-g by these T lymphocytes [665] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 74, "end": 79, "text": "[342]", "ref_id": "BIBREF342"}, {"start": 252, "end": 257, "text": "[342]", "ref_id": "BIBREF342"}, {"start": 471, "end": 476, "text": "[678]", "ref_id": "BIBREF689"}, {"start": 806, "end": 811, "text": "[556]", "ref_id": "BIBREF535"}, {"start": 901, "end": 906, "text": "[155]", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1134, "text": "[665]", "ref_id": "BIBREF664"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Expression of Genes and Transcriptional Activity"}, {"text": "The importance of post-receptor signals transduced by members of the IL receptor superfamily attached to JAK (Janus-family kinase) 1-3 and Tyk-2 activated family members connecting the receptors with the STAT factors is now apparent [214] . The STAT family in turn also includes erythropoietin, G-CSF, and the IFNs [214] . In the Tables 1.32, 1.33 we show two aspects of IL interactions with both JAK and STAT proteins. STAT specificity, phosphorylated and activated by different ILs, is mediated by STATs present within target cells and by affinity of such proteins to the JAK-Tyk complex [222] . In addition, IL 4 -mediated expression of pertinent genes activates the JAK modulating STAT phosphorylation, three exons of which dictate the SH2 region necessary to its activation, of IL 4 -NFAT (NFAT activated by IL 4 ), and other signaling pathways: in particular STAT6 binds to DNA sequences controlling the expression of IL-4-induced Th2 T cell response [562] (Fig. 1.44 ) [457] , absent in mice with disrupted STAT6 genes [523] . Mice devoid of STAT6 fail to produce both IgE antibodies and Th2 lymphocytes in response to IL 4 or IL 13 [248] . A differential expression of the IL 4 gene in Th1 and Th2 T cells is associated with a diverse regulation of NFAT binding to IL 4 CLE0 (consensus lymphokine element-0), mediated via a different TF regulation in Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes [642] . GATA-3 protein is expressed in both immature and mature T cells, but in a constitutive fashion in Th2 cells, which increases upon stimulation of the cells by Ag or cAMP. In contrast, GATA-3 is selectively suppressed in Th1 cells; thus GATA-3 may function as a more general regulator of Th2 ILs expression [678] . An alternative signal transduction system in activated T cells, formed by JAK-1, JAK-3, STAT3 and STAT5, is asso-FceRI [35, 195] . Aggregation of polyvalent antigens to the FceRI-IgE complex results in tyrosine phosphorylation of several protein substrates, including b and g subunits of FceRI, and proteins such as p72 syk , p53/56 syn , pp60 sc-src , PKCg, p95 svav , paxilline, pp105-115 and pp125 FAK : FN adhesion of cells of basophil lineage, when FceRI is absent, reduces phosphorylation to only the last three proteins [195, 196] . Another example is NF-kB associated with IkB-a (inhibitory kBa), an inhibitor and multiform protein induced by Bc110 [24, 621] , probably to prevent inadvertent tissue detriments [303] . In vitro studies show that IkB-a phosphorylation by PKCz [118] , since it does not lead to protein degradation [224] , allows the NF-kB-IkB-a complex dissociation and NF-kB activation by PKCz translocation [118] into the nucleus and fixation on kB regulatory sequences [54] . TRAF6 is thought to activate a member of the MAPK family, which directly or indirectly leads to the activation of IKK1 and IKK2. Both kinases phosphorylate IkB on serine residues, thus targeting IkB for degradation and releasing NF-kB [345] . A TF of the NFAT family, including c-jun and c-fos dimers that together form a potent transcriptional activation complex, binds via NF-kB to specific DNA-regulatory sites of many IL genes in T cells [252] . CN then dephosphorylates NF-kB, passing from a pre-existing state, NFATp, to the cytosolic state, NFATc, beyond which there are NFAT3, NFAT4 genes, etc. [207] . NFATc is then translocated into the nucleus and binds to regulatory sequences in position 5' of the promoter region of some genes, for example of IL 2 [252] . During the 30 min following ligand interactions with membrane receptors, there is the expression of protooncogene c-fos, c-jun and c-myc: their products bind to regulatory structures [454] . The association of c-jun and c-fos dimers, products of immediate-early genes, generates the heterodimer TF AP-1 (activating protein-1) [252] . At the T-cell level, the coordinated fixation of several TFs on regulatory elements, such as NFATc, NF-kB, the fos/jun proteins and AP-1 disposed upon a site from -300 to -63 bp upstream of the IL 2 promoter leads to the pertinent gene transcription and IL synthesis [444] . IL 2 -IL 2 R binding yields a progression signal allowing the complex internalization and lymphocyte progression from G 1 stage to S stage of cell cycle and DNA replication, accompanied with CD71 and HLA-DR expression [444] . Similar processes regulate IL 2 R a chain and other receptor transcription, IL 4 , IL 7 , IL 9 , IL 13 , IL 15 , whose a chain is a functional component of IL 2 -Rg [99, 269, 395, 483, 693] and of IL 5 , IL 6 , IL 10 , the IFNs, GM-CSF and TNF-a [222, 444] . In particular IL 2 , IL 4 , IL 5 and TNF-a are under NFAT influx stimulated by calmodulin [588] . Recently, the GATA family of transcription factors has been characterized, which bind to DNA sequences through a highly conserved C4 zinc finger domain. Six members (GATA-1-GATA-6) of this family have been identified in avians, with homologs in mammals and amphibians [342] . Based on their expression profile, the GATA proteins may be classified func-ciated with IL 2 and IL 15 [240] , JAK1 and -2, STAT1, -2, -3 and -5 by IL 27 [245] , also including IL 2 R, IL 15 Ra and -b [557] as well as the receptors sharing the IL 2 R g chain [404] . Studying intracellular signals has led to the identification of three immunosuppressors of T lymphocyte activation: cyclosporine A (CsA), FK-506 (tacrolimus), and rapamycin (RAP) [505] . CsA and FK-506 bind, respectively, to a cyclophilin and the proteins binding to FK-506 (FKBP): the complexes thus formed bind to CN-dependent phosphatase 2B activity [505] . The CsA/FKBP/RAP-mediated inhibition of NFAT-dependent IL 2 gene transcription is overcome by CN overexpression [341] . CN is therefore essential in the lymphocyte signal transduction pathway, also leading to metachromatic cell degranulation [341] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 233, "end": 238, "text": "[214]", "ref_id": "BIBREF234"}, {"start": 315, "end": 320, "text": "[214]", "ref_id": "BIBREF234"}, {"start": 590, "end": 595, "text": "[222]", "ref_id": "BIBREF242"}, {"start": 957, "end": 962, "text": "[562]", "ref_id": "BIBREF561"}, {"start": 976, "end": 981, "text": "[457]", "ref_id": "BIBREF437"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1031, "text": "[523]", "ref_id": "BIBREF542"}, {"start": 1140, "end": 1145, "text": "[248]", "ref_id": "BIBREF248"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1388, "text": "[642]", "ref_id": "BIBREF641"}, {"start": 1696, "end": 1701, "text": "[678]", "ref_id": "BIBREF689"}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1827, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1832, "text": "195]", "ref_id": "BIBREF195"}, {"start": 2231, "end": 2236, "text": "[195,", "ref_id": "BIBREF195"}, {"start": 2237, "end": 2241, "text": "196]", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 2361, "end": 2365, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2366, "end": 2370, "text": "621]", "ref_id": "BIBREF601"}, {"start": 2423, "end": 2428, "text": "[303]", "ref_id": "BIBREF322"}, {"start": 2488, "end": 2493, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 2542, "end": 2547, "text": "[224]", "ref_id": "BIBREF205"}, {"start": 2637, "end": 2642, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 2700, "end": 2704, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 2942, "end": 2947, "text": "[345]", "ref_id": "BIBREF345"}, {"start": 3149, "end": 3154, "text": "[252]", "ref_id": "BIBREF252"}, {"start": 3310, "end": 3315, "text": "[207]", "ref_id": "BIBREF227"}, {"start": 3469, "end": 3474, "text": "[252]", "ref_id": "BIBREF252"}, {"start": 3660, "end": 3665, "text": "[454]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3803, "end": 3808, "text": "[252]", "ref_id": "BIBREF252"}, {"start": 4078, "end": 4083, "text": "[444]", "ref_id": "BIBREF466"}, {"start": 4304, "end": 4309, "text": "[444]", "ref_id": "BIBREF466"}, {"start": 4420, "end": 4422, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 4477, "end": 4481, "text": "[99,", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 4482, "end": 4486, "text": "269,", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 4487, "end": 4491, "text": "395,", "ref_id": "BIBREF376"}, {"start": 4492, "end": 4496, "text": "483,", "ref_id": "BIBREF482"}, {"start": 4497, "end": 4501, "text": "693]", "ref_id": "BIBREF681"}, {"start": 4558, "end": 4563, "text": "[222,", "ref_id": "BIBREF242"}, {"start": 4564, "end": 4568, "text": "444]", "ref_id": "BIBREF466"}, {"start": 4602, "end": 4603, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 4661, "end": 4666, "text": "[588]", "ref_id": "BIBREF587"}, {"start": 4937, "end": 4942, "text": "[342]", "ref_id": "BIBREF342"}, {"start": 5048, "end": 5053, "text": "[240]", "ref_id": "BIBREF221"}, {"start": 5099, "end": 5104, "text": "[245]", "ref_id": "BIBREF245"}, {"start": 5133, "end": 5135, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 5146, "end": 5151, "text": "[557]", "ref_id": "BIBREF556"}, {"start": 5204, "end": 5209, "text": "[404]", "ref_id": "BIBREF404"}, {"start": 5391, "end": 5396, "text": "[505]", "ref_id": "BIBREF504"}, {"start": 5565, "end": 5570, "text": "[505]", "ref_id": "BIBREF504"}, {"start": 5685, "end": 5690, "text": "[341]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5815, "end": 5820, "text": "[341]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 963, "end": 973, "text": "(Fig. 1.44", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Signal Transduction"}, {"text": "The lectins, carbohydrate-binding gps, are active either substituting IgE antibodies on mIgs or cross-linking their H chains to carbohydrates expressed on various cells, and activating mast cell degranulation by an aspecific binding, and are also known as mitogens (proliferation inducers).

IL 4 , similarly to IL 13 [437] is sufficient to trigger in B cells the expression of e germline transcripts containing one exon located upstream of the e switch region, and spliced to the C H region codified by Ce genes [176] . According to this model, such transcripts are thought to play a critical role in IgE isotype switching by increasing the e locus opening, which thereby becomes accessible to recombination enzymes [296] . Furthermore, IL 4 acts by altering the chromatin structure of the Sg1 region inducing g1 and e transcript accumulation, and B cells activate TFs binding DNA in the region 179 bp upstream of germline e. IL 4 can therefore be sufficient to regulate some events of recombination machinery at the B lymphocyte level [177] , initiating with IL 13 transcription of the C e gene of Ig H chain [250] . Besides, IL 4 contributes to Fce receptor increase on B cells and LC, increases the expression of class II HLA molecules on macrophages, inhibits their IL 1 production and primes them to differentiate into DCs [296] . IL 4 R (CD140), of which IL 13 R is a component [64] , assists with appropriate signals inducing Ce germline transcripts and increasing their role via PLCg1 and PI3K, which also modulates isotype switching leading to mature Ce transcription and to IgE synthesis [659] . Moreover, CD140 evokes Th2 T cell differentiation and IL 4 production mediated by CD8 lymphocytes [4] . IL 4 and IL 13 are in some way independent, since anti-IL 4 abrogates the effects charged to IL 4 , but not those that are IL 13 -triggered [125] . Likewise, immune responses to IL 13 can also be mediated by IL 4 , whereas the contrary is not known [64] ; however, cells not expressing the gc chain, as is the case of X-SCID, respond to both IL 4 and IL 13 [64] . [205, 473, 606] . Besides IL 4 , several ILs take part in IgE synthesis [34, 296] . When an antigen is encountered, both macrophages and accessory cells following a signal delivered by IFN-g release ILs starting to secrete IL 1 , with a substantial effect on thymocyte proliferation stimulated by a lectin, further enhancing T-lymphocyte increase, chiefly Th2 T cells. However, on antigen recognition, IL 1 binds to Th1 T-cell-specific receptors, priming them to produce IL 2 growth factor for T cells and express mRNA for IL 2 molecules [457] , although IL 7 is more powerful than IL 1 and IL 6 [470] . IL 2 receptors (IL 2 -R) appear on the CD4 T-cell surface. At this stage, the role of IL 2 is played by its receptor equipped with a high, mean and low affinity: the highaffinity receptor, necessary for IL 2 proliferation, consists of three subunits: a, b and g, of 55, 75 and 64 kD, respectively [172] . The a subunit (CD25), not expressed on resting cells, with a synthesis that does not depend on antigen signals, amplified from IL 1 , TNF and IL 5 , controls the production of the high-affinity receptor on T cells; preventing its synthesis is inhibited by IL 2 proliferation [34, 172] . Picomolar IL 1 levels are sufficient to drive IL 2 transcription, synthesis and secretion, as well as expressing membrane receptors.

Therefore, in humans, a greater part of Th1 T cells could be active within DTH reactions, while Th2 T cells could promote preferential IgE, IgA, IgG 1 and IgM production (with B-cell help) and stimulate IgE antibodies with IL 4 , mast cells with IL 3 and IL 4 and eosinophils with IL 5 . Th1 clones carry on even cytotoxic activities against APCs, including B cells: these data suggest that such Th1 T cells eliminate not only B cells functioning as APCs, but also Ig production, hence demonstrating poor helper activity. The studies discussed above have been further emphasized by recent observations in healthy individuals on Der p 1-specific Th1 clones' cytolytic potential, but not in Th2 clones from atopic subjects [456] . The data implicit from an increasing amount of experimental results underline that activated T cells produce factors useful for B-cell growth and differentiation and a parade of ILs crucial in immune responses [421] . As a consequence, the selection of ILs to be secreted and T subsets to be involved is determined by the pathway of immune response. These studies appear to suggest that chronic allergen stimulations may select IL 4 predominant intervention under allergen-specific Th2 cells influx in individuals whose T cells are intrinsically prone to secreting large amounts of IL 4 on activation [176] . IL 4 , strongly supported by highly IL 4 -producing CD4 clones, directs B lymphocyte isotype switching to IgE production, inducing in B cells the gene recombination that represents the critical premise for B-cell differentiating activation within IgE-secreting cells (Fig. 1.22) .Allergen concentration can control Th1 or Th2 phenotype development from Th0 T cells [643] : actually, in animal models low-mean doses of peptides determine IFN-g production from Th1 T cells and almost nonexistent IL 4 levels, whereas increasing the doses implies IFN-g vanishing and IL 4 -producing cell release [215] . Therefore, in allergen-specific T cells there will be a fine balance between APCs (DCs) producing IL 12 and Th2 T cells of IL 4 : the antigen dose will result in critically establishing the outcome to either IFN-g or IL 4 [401] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 53, "end": 58, "text": "[606]", "ref_id": "BIBREF624"}, {"start": 286, "end": 291, "text": "[473]", "ref_id": "BIBREF453"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1020, "text": "[456]", "ref_id": "BIBREF478"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1238, "text": "[421]", "ref_id": "BIBREF420"}, {"start": 1624, "end": 1629, "text": "[176]", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 1997, "end": 2002, "text": "[643]", "ref_id": "BIBREF642"}, {"start": 2225, "end": 2230, "text": "[215]", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 2334, "end": 2336, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2455, "end": 2460, "text": "[401]", "ref_id": "BIBREF401"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1899, "end": 1910, "text": "(Fig. 1.22)", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Role of ILs"}, {"text": "According to previous explanations, several gps with affinity for IgE and the capacity to regulate its synthesis (IgE-BF) could be implied, such as the inducer factor stimulating T cells to IgE-BF synthesis, EFA (enhancing factor of allergy), analogous to GEF (glycosylation enhancing factor), SFA (suppressive factor of allergy ), IgE-PF (IgE potentiating factor) and IgE-SF (IgE suppressive factor). Apparently, lymphoid cells should be able to synthesize and release IgE-BF and to develop an isotype-specific regulatory function, acting directly on B cells. IgE-PFs demonstrate affinity for lectins, for their content in mannose-rich oligosaccharides, while IgE-SFs do not have affinity for IFN-g is a major IL 4 antagonist and suppresses IgE production by normal human lymphocytes induced by IL 4 , either directly or by reducing FcR expression for IgE antibodies from B lymphocytes. IFN-a and PGE 2 also block IL 4 -induced IgE production in a dose-dependent way [421] . The IFN-g suppressive mechanism is indirect, since no inhibition of e germline transcripts has been reported [296] , therefore suggesting that IFN-g may prevent recombination events without affecting e-mRNA transcript expression [205] . IL 4 down-regulates IFN-g production, but when this is driven by T cells stimulated with allogenic cells, and in mixed lymphocyte cultures, IL 4 fails to initiate IgE synthesis. By contrast adding IL 4 early to the culture, there is IgE synthesis and suppression of IFN-g synthesis.

IFN-g, IFN-a, TGF-b, IL 1 and IL 12 evoke antigenspecific T-cell differentiation into Th0 or Th1 T cells [401] , whereas IFN-g absence or low levels and IL 4 promote Th2 T-cell expansion, while IL 2 supports all three subsets [606] . T-cell stimulation directed by IL 12 is IFNgor IFN-a-dependent [401] ; similarly DCs drive Th1 T-cell expansion from virgin DC + in an IL 12 -dependent scenery, in the absence of IL 4 [387] , with the help of CD80 [401] or CD16 [339] . IL 1 directs T cells stimulated by SEB (staphylococcal enterotoxin B) SA to differentiate into Th1 T cells [504] . Instead, IL 4 , IL 10 , and IL 13 not only inhibit Th1 T cell growth, but also considerably reduce IL 12 production from macrophages [606] , while IL 10 blocks IL production from Th1 lymphocytes at a transcriptional level and induces LC toleration [139] . The IL local setting therefore takes a decisive role in selecting the predominant subset: IL 4 modulates Th2 T cell differentiation, IFN-g that of Th1 cells [644] , taking into account that NK-cell deficiency, quantitative or functional, can promote poor IFN-g production [77] . In this setting, the Th2 T cell prevalence could be the key of aberrant and increased IL 4 and IL 5 production, and of high IgE levels specific to severe atopic subjects [413] . This approach is confirmed by IL 13 presence only in atopic individuals [219] . However, severity of atopic disease is not a necessary prerequisite, since the same dichotomy is observed in patients with less severe disease [219, 318] , but only in patients with high IgE levels [318] . A rationale could be the CLE0, CLE1, and CLE2 presence shared by IL 3 -IL 5 and GM-CSF genes expressed coordinately after antigen stimulation [588, 645] .We stress that in the CB of at-risk newborn babies an IFN-g deficient differentiation is operative, paralleling an excessive IL 4 lectins, but bind peanut agglutinins. IgE-PFs are produced by T cells when GEF is present and IgE-SFs when GIF (glycosylation inhibiting factor) is present: indeed the serum of healthy, nonatopic individuals contains IgE-SFs, while IgE-PFs were found in patients with HIgES. Post-transductional glycosylation is regulated by two factors: GIF, released by CD8 cells, which inhibits both glycosylation and IgE synthesis, and GEF, released by CD4 cells, with opposite actions. GEF is a 25-kD peptide kallikrein-like enzyme, released after stimulation with Bordetella pertussis, Al salts or parasite antigens, and produces a kinin activating IgE-BF production. GIF is a 15-kD derivative of phosphorylated lipomodulin capable of inhibiting PLA 2 (phospholipase A2), produced by T lymphocytes stimulated in the presence of CSs (corticosteroids) or after treatment with Freund's complete adjuvant, inhibiting glycosylation of IgE-BFs secreted from T lymphocytes expressing, therefore, an antagonist activity for GEFs. GEF should be present in atopic subjects and GIF in healthy, nonatopic subjects, a surplus of IgE-PFs and a lack of IgE-SFs foster IgE production. IgE-PF is detected when GEF is formed, with which GIF competes, whereas IgE-SF counters with IgE-PF for lymphocyte differentiation with membrane IgE in B cell IgE producers. IgE-PFs were described in the murine model, primed by T cell FceRII + : in humans they can be produced by B-lymphocyte-FceRII + , breakdown products of FceRII (soluble FceRII or sFceRII) [469] . Glycosylation does not appear to be a crucial moment for the binding of FceRII-IgE but, on the contrary, nonglycosylated IgE bind to FceRII with an affinity tenfold greater than that of native IgE. Also, receptor glycosylation influences its activity, because carbohydrates interfere with sFceRII release from proteases. IgE glycosylation and its affinity with FceRII seem to act in the same direction in precluding the receptor state of solubility: IgE glycosylation interferes with its binding to FceRII, preventing proteolytic enzyme intervention, receptor glycosylation disguises its binding site; therefore IgE glycosylation appears to be in vivo a heterogeneous process, probably subjected to regulative laws present in rodents [553] . (Fig. 1.19) is a high-affinity receptor for IgE antibodies, with 325 amino acid residues, thus another key player. A tetrameric complex (4 TM polypeptides), it consists of four chains, one a, mainly extracellular containing two domains characteristic of IgSF and most closely resembling that of FcgR, FcaR and poly-Ig receptor, one b with four TM segments and two identical g domains, mostly intracellular with evident analogies with CD3 z chain [553] . The cytoplasmic regions of a and b chains contain, as the z chain, more binding sites with tyrosine kinases, the a chain binds IgE, the b and g are membrane proteins; the g chains are required for signal transduction and metachromatic cell activation after their interactions with IgE. FceRI is monovalent, each one binds only one IgE molecule and such binding triggers mast cell and basophil degranulation and release of mediators responsible for immediate hypersensitivity reactions [176, 358] . PBMCs of nonatopic individuals express the receptor in, on average, 18% of non-IgE-binding cases; the reverse is true for atopics: such differences depend on IgE levels [452] . Zhu et al [684] have reported a strategy that takes advantage of the natural capacity of FceRIIb to inhibit the allergenic activity of FceRI. The FceRI-mediated activation pathways are modulated by an inhibitory receptor such as the IgG receptor FceRIIb. The allergen-specific IgGs produced in response to immunization have formed complexes with allergens, which can, in turn, form a bridge between FceRI and FceRIIb with 320 amino acid residues. Both receptors are expressed on mast cells and basophils; the Fc fragment of IgG in the immune complex binds to FceRIIb, whereas the allergen binds to IgE, which is already bound to adjacent FceRI. The formation of this bridge induces the aggregation of activating FceRI with inhibitory FceRIIb, which inhibits the activation pathways activated by FceRI [259, 684] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 127, "end": 132, "text": "[644]", "ref_id": "BIBREF643"}, {"start": 455, "end": 460, "text": "[401]", "ref_id": "BIBREF401"}, {"start": 576, "end": 581, "text": "[606]", "ref_id": "BIBREF624"}, {"start": 647, "end": 652, "text": "[401]", "ref_id": "BIBREF401"}, {"start": 768, "end": 773, "text": "[387]", "ref_id": "BIBREF368"}, {"start": 798, "end": 803, "text": "[401]", "ref_id": "BIBREF401"}, {"start": 812, "end": 817, "text": "[339]", "ref_id": "BIBREF339"}, {"start": 927, "end": 932, "text": "[504]", "ref_id": "BIBREF503"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1073, "text": "[606]", "ref_id": "BIBREF624"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1188, "text": "[139]", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}, {"start": 1348, "end": 1353, "text": "[644]", "ref_id": "BIBREF643"}, {"start": 1463, "end": 1467, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1640, "end": 1645, "text": "[413]", "ref_id": "BIBREF413"}, {"start": 1720, "end": 1725, "text": "[219]", "ref_id": "BIBREF239"}, {"start": 1871, "end": 1876, "text": "[219,", "ref_id": "BIBREF239"}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1881, "text": "318]", "ref_id": "BIBREF298"}, {"start": 1926, "end": 1931, "text": "[318]", "ref_id": "BIBREF298"}, {"start": 2076, "end": 2081, "text": "[588,", "ref_id": "BIBREF587"}, {"start": 2082, "end": 2086, "text": "645]", "ref_id": "BIBREF644"}, {"start": 3737, "end": 3742, "text": "[469]", "ref_id": "BIBREF449"}, {"start": 4479, "end": 4484, "text": "[553]", "ref_id": "BIBREF532"}, {"start": 4933, "end": 4938, "text": "[553]", "ref_id": "BIBREF532"}, {"start": 5426, "end": 5431, "text": "[176,", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 5432, "end": 5436, "text": "358]", "ref_id": "BIBREF358"}, {"start": 5608, "end": 5613, "text": "[452]", "ref_id": "BIBREF474"}, {"start": 5626, "end": 5631, "text": "[684]", "ref_id": "BIBREF672"}, {"start": 6417, "end": 6422, "text": "[259,", "ref_id": "BIBREF259"}, {"start": 6423, "end": 6427, "text": "684]", "ref_id": "BIBREF672"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 133, "end": 142, "text": "(Table 1.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 4487, "end": 4498, "text": "(Fig. 1.19)", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "IL Role in T-Cell Preferential Activation."}, {"text": "FceRII ( Fig. 1.19 ) or CD23 [259] , a counter receptor of CD21 [16] , is a low-affinity receptor different from FceRI for its structure, MW (70-83 kD) and affinity of binding IgE antibodies; it is the only known antibody receptor not belonging to IgSF.

Before this interaction, an IL profile including IL 4 in the microenvironment cannot stimulate B IgM precursors to switch into B IgE . However, conjugated T-B cells increase IL 4 receptor expression on B cell membranes. Consequently, Th2 lymphocytes release IL 4 and other ILs, inducing B lymphocytes to synthesize IgE [473] .

CD154 or CD40L is similar to a 30-to 39-kD membrane gp, formed by 263 amino acids, homologous to TNF and expressed by activated CD4 T cells [446] . Subsequently to this interaction, activated B cells proliferate and acquire APC activity, generating CD80 and CD86 surface molecules, counter receptors of CD28 of T cells, which in turn also express CD152 [243] . However, CD86, because of an earlier expression, its higher levels and pro-Th2 T cells and -IL 4 orientation, may play a key part in IL 4 production. CD40-CD154 binding amplified by CD80 and CD86 binding [446] is the prime stimulus for the second signal, which plays a crucial role in responsive B cells in IgE synthesis. The ensuing IL 4 secretion and BcR binding directs gene transcription and isotype switching from IgM to IgE [132] : if CD40-CD154 are expressed on activated T cells, IL 12 is also synthesized [524] . After the significant identification that mutations of the gene encoding CD154 on chromosome Xq26.3-q27.1 are responsible for HIgMS, with absent IgE synthesis in the presence of IL 4 [442] , studies have shown that decreased expression of CD154 inhibits the switching from IgM to IgG in 77% of patients with CVID [147] and HIgMS [442] . CD2-CD58 binding, as described above, fulfills a role in IgE induction independent of CD40-CD154: indeed the role of this pair assumes great importance in IgE production at the level of the lamina propria, where T and B lymphocytes have a major expression of CD2 and, respectively, of CD58 in comparison with their subsets in peripheral blood [600] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 425, "end": 430, "text": "[600]", "ref_id": "BIBREF618"}, {"start": 573, "end": 578, "text": "[446]", "ref_id": "BIBREF468"}, {"start": 786, "end": 791, "text": "[243]", "ref_id": "BIBREF243"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1003, "text": "[446]", "ref_id": "BIBREF468"}, {"start": 1224, "end": 1229, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1313, "text": "[524]", "ref_id": "BIBREF543"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1504, "text": "[442]", "ref_id": "BIBREF464"}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1634, "text": "[147]", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 1645, "end": 1650, "text": "[442]", "ref_id": "BIBREF464"}, {"start": 1996, "end": 2001, "text": "[600]", "ref_id": "BIBREF618"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 155, "end": 167, "text": "(Fig. 1.22a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Second Signal"}, {"text": "Second-type B-cell activating signals act in synergy with IL 4 and T cell-independent systems in the induction of IgE synthesis [205, 383, 437] . \u2211 IL 4 -dependent IgE synthesis by non-cognate T-B-cell interactions has been reported in which TcR fails to recognize the HLA-peptide complex, for example, an inducible molecule associated with membranes of T CD4 + clones is apparently capable of directing the B lymphocyte differentiating process toward IgE synthesis [455] . However, a latency time of 2-4 days is necessary for T-cell-activated IL 4 to deliver the signal to undergo class switching to B cells, which can drive B cells to secrete IgE independently of T cells [205] . Such data indicate that metachromatic cells select ILs able to stimulate B cells activated by T cells to produce other ILs as well as Th2 lymphocytes. Similarly, splenic non-T-non B cells produce IL 4 as a result of cross-binding to FceRI or of exposure to IL 3 [205] . The T-cell role has been emphasized by their ability to produce ILs, thus stimulating IgE-mediated reactions by a direct action on metachromatic cells [496] . \u2211 Stimulation with EBV and IL 4 has been shown to elicit IgE synthesis in human B cells. B IgE cells obtained by activation with EBV and IL 4 contain both mature and germline Ce transcripts, whereas IL 4 alone yields only sterile m transcripts [233] . \u2211 IgE production can also be promoted by direct activators of B cells, which, costimulated with rIL 4 and CD40, or anti-CD40 mABs mimicking in vitro CD154 interactions, are able to synthesize high IgE levels [233] . In nonatopic subjects, IgE synthesis is stimulated after addition of anti-CD40 and rIL 4 [294] and accelerated by adding IL 10 simultaneously to IL 6 production [590] . However, IL 4 and anti-CD40 alone produce IgE in modest amounts (<0.1 ng/ml) [590] , and IL 4 antagonizes IgE synthesis induced by B cells activated by anti-CD40 [400] . Proliferation of preactivated B cells is positively affected by IL 10 also inhibiting Th1 cells and related ILs [480] : such processes, independent of gene restriction, could explain polyclonal IgE formation, in addition to sIgE during, for example, strong allergic reactions [176] . CD40 effects are likely to be important under physiological conditions, considering that soluble CD40 (sCD40) inhibits in vitro T-cell-dependent IgE synthesis after an appropriate second signal [132] , while CD154 drives IgE production in IL 4 -treated B cells [132] (Fig. 1.46 ) [456] . In this scenario, crucial data appear to play a significant role, since it is well known that CD154 expressed by circulating basophils and mast cells also of skin and lungs [174] and from eosinophils [175] together with CD40 [407] modulate IgE synthesis with the immediate implication that it takes place not only in germinal centers of lymph nodes, but also in peripheral tissues. \u2211 IgE may also be involved in indirect mechanisms such as enhancement of APC antigen-capturing capacity: IgE-mediated presentation of a great number of allergens by interacting with FceRI and FceRII can activate the immune system in a continuous way, even with low allergen concentrations, thus leading to an overproduction of both IgE and Th2 cells, which in turn will induce more B cells to a switch recombination, also explaining why certain atopic patients worsen from a monosensitization to a multiple sensitization [383] . \u2211 PBMCs in the presence of IL 4 and hydrocortisone trigger IgE synthesis [205] and by means of FceRI can be involved in an IgE-mediated presentation with a T-independent mechanism [384] . \u2211 IL 13 is known to enhance IgE synthesis even in the absence of IL 4 [437] , thus demonstrating that additional soluble mediators, as yet not well defined, are potentially involved in IgE regulation. bly respective markers for reversible resting and activated states; CD29 is expressed two to four times more on several adhesion molecules in addition to CD45RO cell surface than on CD45RA [23] . This cellular basis consists in antigen-specific lymphocyte expansion during primary responses, so that sensitized cells play a specific function, announcing in the bloodstream the occurred recognition, leaving a greater number of T and B cells [101] . Other memory cells undergo a rapid turnover: activated after stimulation by antigen-specific CD4 + T cells are engaged to respond to a wide spectrum of APCs, and to secrete ILs and high IgG levels [326] . Memory T and B cells recirculate via peripheral blood and lymphoid organs ( Fig. 1.11) , and besides some cells with a short life span there are others with a long life span: their characteristics are summarized in Table 1 .42 [688] . Since cytopathic viruses cause damage to fetuses and neonates when the immune protection necessary to survive is absent, particularly during a critical immunoincompetent period, mothers protect their babies passively transferring neutralizing antibodies [688] . Which signals lead to memory cell development at birth vs effector cells? One possible answer is that large antigen amounts plus costimulation in an environment dominated by inflammation may result in differentiation to effector cells, whereas the absence of an inflammatory milieu or ILs favor memory cell generation: according to this model, T cells activated in early stages of an infection would differentiate into effectors, whereas during later stages with a reduced antigen load memory T cells would prevail [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 128, "end": 133, "text": "[205,", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 134, "end": 138, "text": "383,", "ref_id": "BIBREF364"}, {"start": 139, "end": 143, "text": "437]", "ref_id": "BIBREF436"}, {"start": 466, "end": 471, "text": "[455]", "ref_id": "BIBREF477"}, {"start": 674, "end": 679, "text": "[205]", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 944, "end": 949, "text": "[205]", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1108, "text": "[496]", "ref_id": "BIBREF495"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1360, "text": "[233]", "ref_id": "BIBREF214"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1576, "text": "[233]", "ref_id": "BIBREF214"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1673, "text": "[294]", "ref_id": "BIBREF313"}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1745, "text": "[590]", "ref_id": "BIBREF589"}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1830, "text": "[590]", "ref_id": "BIBREF589"}, {"start": 1910, "end": 1915, "text": "[400]", "ref_id": "BIBREF400"}, {"start": 2030, "end": 2035, "text": "[480]", "ref_id": "BIBREF479"}, {"start": 2194, "end": 2199, "text": "[176]", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 2396, "end": 2401, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 2463, "end": 2468, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 2482, "end": 2487, "text": "[456]", "ref_id": "BIBREF478"}, {"start": 2663, "end": 2668, "text": "[174]", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}, {"start": 2690, "end": 2695, "text": "[175]", "ref_id": "BIBREF174"}, {"start": 2715, "end": 2720, "text": "[407]", "ref_id": "BIBREF407"}, {"start": 3393, "end": 3398, "text": "[383]", "ref_id": "BIBREF364"}, {"start": 3474, "end": 3479, "text": "[205]", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 3581, "end": 3586, "text": "[384]", "ref_id": "BIBREF365"}, {"start": 3659, "end": 3664, "text": "[437]", "ref_id": "BIBREF436"}, {"start": 3979, "end": 3983, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 4231, "end": 4236, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 4436, "end": 4441, "text": "[326]", "ref_id": "BIBREF326"}, {"start": 4671, "end": 4676, "text": "[688]", "ref_id": "BIBREF676"}, {"start": 4933, "end": 4938, "text": "[688]", "ref_id": "BIBREF676"}, {"start": 5456, "end": 5459, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2469, "end": 2479, "text": "(Fig. 1.46", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 4520, "end": 4530, "text": "Fig. 1.11)", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 4659, "end": 4666, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Second Signal"}, {"text": "One theory on long-lived memory cells admits a constant stimulation of T-cell clones, according to three procedures: contact with antigens (and/or pathogens), new encounter with antigens, then with antigens bound to DCs with reconstitution of supplies [101] .

About 50%-60% of CD45 isoforms are associated with the 180-kD form, CD45RO, memory cells, and 40%-50% with the 220-kD form, CD45RA, virgin cells that are functionally inactive in the absence of antigen-driven stimulation. The RA isoform of CD45 is expressed on newly formed T cells that have not yet encountered specific antigen; during activation by exposure to specific antigen, the RA isoform is stably modulated to RO, a process that involves differential, post-transcriptional processing of the CD45 mRNA turning into CD45RO after IL 2 -dependent T-cell activation.

(Modified from [456]) to another hypothesis, which is gradually being widely received, memory cells do not require further contacts for their survival [7, 56, 216, 385] ; hence, if a memory cell prerequisite is a persistent stimulation, one could argue that T-cell memory may not exist [56] . As a consequence, these studies have not proved that there are two types of memory, one short-term and one long-term memory, even if in 1847 a measles epidemic spared the aged infected 65 before years are the Faroe Islands [407] , thus confirming earlier observations made by Thucydides. New findings are supported by demonstrations that memory CD8 CTLs persist indefinitely when associated with CD44 homing receptor, ensuring long-type memory also independently of steady antigen stimulation [291] . CD8 CTLs from a previous reaction to a given virus may in the future be reactivated and contribute to natural resistance by cross-reacting to another putatively unrelated infectious agent [512] . CD8 T-cell memory stimulation, long persisting also in the absence of the original antigen, can thereby depend not on a new encounter with known antigens, but with wholly different antigens, only if they have a cross-reaction with the first ones. Therefore CD8 long-term memory persists without antigen stimulation [216, 385] . Differential expression of memory phenotype markers CD44, CD122, and Ly6C by SOCS-1 (suppressor of cytokine signaling) IL 15 -CD8 + lymphocytes suggests that multiple signals contributed to the memory cell differentiation program.

ILs can exert a real hemopoiesis, that is, an action also on the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cell progenitors in the area of immune inflammation where they are released, assuming a role of endogenous mediators. ILs are produced by cells exposed to inflammatory stimuli or bacterial products, or even not belonging to the immune system. They are involved in diverse stages of immune response and inflammatory reactions, greatly regulating their amplitude and duration, interacting at the cell surface with membrane receptors for which ILs have a high affinity, which transduce signals inside the cells. ILs act at picomolar concentrations and are therefore very potent, while their action is of short duration and self-limited.

Both SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 can desensitize primary bone marrow-derived macrophages to IFN-g and IL 6 signaling, respectively effector machinery for activated lymphocytes and regulate their proliferation and growth [23] . At least 70 soluble molecules and ILs are involved in lymphocyte activation and differentiation after antigen presentation.

In this respect it is helpful to consider the relationships between ILs and adhesion molecules, which are based on vascular endothelial cells: indeed the leukocytes, when guided into circulation, must interact with such cells, which regulate leukocytes and are regulated by them. Leukocytes adhere to endothelial cells via a binding increase between leukocyte surface receptors and their co-receptors or ligands on the endothelial cell surface, which therefore plays a fundamental role in leukocyte migration from vascular to inflammatory sites in interstitial tissues [65] . Leukocyte adhesion to endothelial walls, chiefly of lymphocytes, is also of great magnitude for their compartmentalization and recirculation [209, 328, 534] , as shown by Figs. 1.5, 1.11, and 1.58. Apart from new insights on the connections between ILs and leukocytes, the bidirectional relationships between ILs and endothelial cells are intriguing. Indeed, in addition to being targets of the action of soluble mediators of immunity, activating in vascular endothelium a large spectrum of functional interactions, endothelial cells are able to produce several ILs, some of which direct leukocyte extravasation from the circulatory system [534] . High vascular cells, the HEVs, are specialized for lymphocyte extravascular emigration into peripheral lymph nodes: lymphocytes bind selectively to HEVs, as shown by studies on the inhibition of lymphocyte-HEV adhesion done in the animal model and in humans by means of monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, it was possible to point out the role of surface structures present on HEVs.

This preliminary stage, definite and representative, is related to antigen recognition from CD4 T cells (adhesion to APCs) or to effector activities (adhesion to target cells). Eight subfamilies of leukocyte integrins are as yet known, each made up of 24 different a subunits and a common b chain with 8 subunits distinct in b1-b8, noncovalently linked, forming many combinations [65, 534] . The a integrins play a key role in inflammatory processes, including leukocyte adhesion and migration. Their genes are located on the p arm of chromosome 16 [164] . b1 Integrins (CD29) are heterodimers composed of a common b chain, which can bind to variable a chains. They are the VLA proteins, very late antigens, because the first two appear on lymphocytes 2-4 weeks after antigen priming and are variably expressed on the leukocyte surface. VLAs are divided into various types, as is seen in Table 1 .45 [4, 23, 226] . They are chiefly receptors of ECM components such as FN (VLA-5), fibrinogen, laminin (VLA-6), collagen (VLA-2), vitronectin, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and IgSF members [65, 534] . VLAs interact with a wide range of other cells: epithelial (VLA-3), mesangial (VLA-1), activated T (VLA-1, VLA-2), skin fibroblasts (VLA-1), hemopoietic lines (VLA-3), thymus, bone marrow, monocytes, leukocytes (VLA-4 and VLA-5), basement membranes (VLA-3), platelets (VLA-2, VLA-5), and liver sinusoids (VLA-1).

Thus they are important in lymphocyte homing, transendothelial migration to sites of inflammation, and interactions with ECM [226] .VLA-4 has distinct sites for VLA-5 and CD106, while a 4 b 1 could mediate pro-thymocyte migration from bone marrow to thymus [614] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 785, "end": 789, "text": "[65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 790, "end": 794, "text": "534]", "ref_id": "BIBREF553"}, {"start": 954, "end": 959, "text": "[164]", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1308, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1309, "end": 1312, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1313, "end": 1317, "text": "226]", "ref_id": "BIBREF207"}, {"start": 1490, "end": 1494, "text": "[65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 1495, "end": 1499, "text": "534]", "ref_id": "BIBREF553"}, {"start": 2066, "end": 2071, "text": "[226]", "ref_id": "BIBREF207"}, {"start": 2198, "end": 2203, "text": "[614]", "ref_id": "BIBREF632"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1293, "end": 1300, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Integrins"}, {"text": "b2 Integrins (CD29), characterized by a b2 common chain, and a higher immunological and immunopathological interest, are heterodimers formed by two covalently bound peptide chains expressed on PBMCs for the most part; hence they are called leukocyte integrins and regulate adhesion for PBMCs [226] . b2 Integrins have four receptors, each with two chains, a distinct and b common (Table 1. 46) [4, 23] , while a d b 2 is expressed by tissue macrophages [209] .

As their name suggests, chemoattractant cytokines play the role of chemotactic molecules interested in integrin activation. Chemokines may be defined as small but potent leukocyte pro-inflammatory chemoattractants, cellular activating factors, and HRFs, that bind to specific G-protein-coupled seven-span TM receptors present on plasma membranes of target cells, which makes them particularly important in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. Chemokines are major regulators of cell trafficking and may also modulate cell survival and growth [280, 687] . Chemokines IL 8 , MIP-1, MCP-1 and RANTES are known to recruit neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages and T lymphocytes to the site of inflammation. MIP-1, MCP-1 and RANTES are direct chemoattractants of Th1 cells. These chemokines are promiscuously used by several receptors, but all three are ligands for CCR5, which is preferably expressed in type 1 cells. Therefore, it is of interest to note that the CCL-chemokines and their receptors are coexpressed in Th1 cells. The coexpression is not only Th1-cell-specific, but the similar expression pattern applies to Th2 cells that express CCR4 bearing thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) receptor. Structurally related, chemokines are divided into three groups based on the chromosomes by which they are coded: a = 4, b = 17, depending on whether the first two cysteine residues are separated by an amino acid (CXCL) or are adjacent (CCL), g = 1, and d is an exception on chromosome 16, interacting with receptors different from G proteins [9, 22, 178] (Tables 1.54, 1.55) [2, 9, 19, 22, 178, 247, 479, 574] . The proposed chemokine nomenclature is based on the nomenclature currently in use, derived from the one already assigned to the gene encoding the 4 families of chemokines [687] , and includes CC, CXC, XC, or CX3C followed by L (ligand) or R (receptor) and then a number [667] : \u2211 CXCL a chemokines: for neutrophils there are many specificities (Table 1 .54), GROs are specific even for basophils [178] . Moreover, NAP-1/IL 8 chemoattractant of eosinophils can activate also basophils ( Fig. 1.49 ) and act as a potent inducer of T-cell chemotactic and activating responses. From PBP (platelet basic protein) b-TG, CTAP-III and NAP-2 originate [19] . A further subdivision might be introduced, since mig, IP-10 and PF-4 lack the E-L-R (glutamic acid-leucine-arginine) residues [19] . \u2211 CCL b chemokines: (Table 1 .55) RANTES is produced by fibroblasts to attract and activate eosinophils. LPS is known to induce RANTES and cause protein tyrosine phosphorylation [658] . RANTES is a chemoattractant selective for activated and resting T cells, including memory cells [552] . CD45RO, macrophages and eosinophils. MIP-1a and MIP-1b and MCP-1 are chemotactic for T subsets, macrophages, eosinophils and basophils; while macrophages in turn elicit several CCL chemokines [540] . In particular, MIP-1a favors activated B cells and CD8 migration and MIP-1b-activated T cell infiltration; both direct T-cell adhesion to endothelial cells, the former of CD8 and the latter of CD4 T cells.

RANTES in IL 5 -stimulated cells is an effective inducer of eosinophil transendothelial migration by a single mechanism, CD49d/CD106-dependent [133] . Although RANTES and IL 5 are elevated 24 h after antigen challenge, eosinophil recruitment and degranulation is associated only with IL 5 [552] . Unprimed mast cells are influenced to migrate by MCP-1 and RANTES, while IgE-activated cells respond to MIP-1a and PF4, but do not degranulate in response to chemokines [568] .

Positive correlations link the level of Syk expression and MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3 are also major attractants for monocytes, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [317, 609] . MCP-1-4 bind to specific G-protein-coupled receptors, initiating a signal cascade within the cell. CCR2 is considered the major G-protein-coupled receptor for MCP-1 [616] . MCP-5, a 9.2-kD peptide that consists of 82 amino acid residues, has been identified in the mouse [614] . MCP-1 is efficacious nearly as much as C5a and, in conjunction with RANTES and MIP-1a, stimulates basophils to release histamine, even more so if IL 3 , IL 5 and GM-CSF interfere. Furthermore, MCP-1 turns into a powerful chemoattractant of eosinophils, similarly to IL 8 if it loses the N-terminal region [628] . MCP 1-3 are active chemoattractants for NK cells [316] , MCP-1 also for T cells of memory phenotype [67] , whereas MCP-3 appears to be involved in the regulation of early b-TG b-thromboglobulin, CK-a1 a1 chemokine, CTAP-III connective tissue activating protein-III, DC dendritic cells, ELC EBI1 ligand chemokine, ENA-78 epithelial cell-derived neutrophil-activating protein, GCP-2 granulocyte chemotactic protein 2, GRO-a, GRO-b, GRO-g growth-related gene, IP-10 Inflammatory protein-10, I-TAC interferon inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant, MAD-2 monocyte adhesion dependent protein-2, MCP 1/5 monocyte chemotactic protein-1/5, mig monokine inducible by IFN-g, MIP-1a, -1b, 2 macrophage inflammatory protein-1a, -1b, 2, NAP-1 neutrophil activating factor-1, PBP platelet basic protein, PF4 platelet factor 4, SDF-1a/1b stromal cell-derived factor.

TARC, constitutively expressed in the thymus and produced by monocyte-derived DCs and endothelial cells, is a ligand for CCR4 and CCR8 and serves for the recruitment and migration of these receptor-expressing cells, and is thus responsible for the selective trafficking of Th2 lymphocytes into sites of allergic inflammation [393] .

RANTES production from nasal fibroblasts stimulated with LPS is enhanced by overexpression of wild-type Syk gene transfer [658] . Several CXCL and CCL chemokines alone or together release 11%-43% of basophil histamine [283] and have similar activity: for example, GRO a, g and MCP-1 are constitutively produced in human airway epithelium and bronchoalveolar macrophages [32] , while IL 8 and CCL chemokines manipulate IL 2 -activated NKcell chemotaxis [334] . The eotaxins have a great significance in the atopic march: STAT-6 is required to up-regulate eotaxin-1 and eotaxin-2 expression by chronic IL 4 stimulation [687] . Multiple other STAT molecules (STAT-1, STAT-2, and STAT-3) can be recruited to various other chemokine receptors after JAK recruitment.

Recent studies have clearly demonstrated a key role for PI3K in chemokine receptor signaling [396, 554] . This leads in turn to activation of PIP-specific PLC, PKC, small GTP-ases, Src-related tyrosine kinase, PI3K, and PKB. PLA delivers two secondary messengers, inositol-1,4,5 triphosphate, which releases intracellular calcium, and DAG which activates PKC. Multiple phosphorylation events are triggered by chemokines. PIP-OH-kinase can be activated by the bg subunit of G protein, small GTP-ase or Src-related tyrosine kinases [687] . The membrane tyrosine phosphatase CD45 has also been shown to regulate CXCR4-mediated activation and phosphorylation of TcR downstream effectors Lck, ZAP-70, and their different ligands: 15 for CXCL (CXCL 1-18), 28 for CCL (CCL 1-28), 1 for CX3CL chemokines and other unclassified ones [2, 4, 690] . All have seven G-protein-linked TM-spanning domains and their signaling can be typically inhibited by pertussis toxin [2] , in addition to two virally encoded chemokine receptors that may be used, together with IL 8 R and IFN-R, by viruses to subvert the host immune system [2] by altering the local conditions in favor of viral persistence and replication [11] . The inhibition of chemokine receptors by pertussis toxin (PT) suggests that Gi proteins are key to the transduction of signals. Gi proteins physically associate with multiple chemokine receptors, but there is also evidence that other PT-resistant Gi proteins, such as Gq or G16, might also associate with certain receptors [465] . AA release Chemokine receptors SLP-76.Activation of the RAFTK (related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase), a member of the related kinase family, has been shown to be induced by signaling via CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 [151] . Mitogen-activated protein kinases have also been shown to be phosphorylated and activated within 1 min after exposure of leukocytes to CCR3 ligands [247] . CXCR4 is predominantly expressed on inactivated naive T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, DCs, and endothelial cells. SDF-1 is the only known ligand for CXCR4 [239] . The principal biological function of chemokines is contributing to leukocyte recruitment, firstly by activating integrins, as described above, and secondly by promoting leukocyte migration across endothelium and through ECM [2] . Additional functions consist in the antiviral immunity (innate immunity), hematopoiesis and angiogenesis regulation, growth and cellular metabolism [9] . The existence of so many characterized chemokines with overlapping targets is not surprising, since it is also possible that certain chemokines may have a restricted tissue expression, although their large number can actually result in a degree of redundancy [2] . However, the strong expression of IL 8 and MCP-1 by epithelial cells could also suggest that they might be key factors in leukocyte recruitment to counteract invading pathogens [141] . This notion agrees with the priming of cytotoxic CD8 T cells and NK cells by RANTES and MIP-1a [569] , which can provide substantial costimulatory signals for T-cell proliferation and promotion of effector functions, also by enhancing CD80 and CD86 expression on APCs and IL 2 production from activated T lymphocytes [20] . In addition, CCL chemokines direct basophil and eosinophil migration for activation and response at DTH sites, where ILs of Th2 T cells surround and in turn stimulate the above cells, amplifying their negative effects.

By binding to sIgE, monocytes and basophils, HRFs can perpetuate histamine release, thereby inducing allergic reactions too late or too prolonged to be classified as IgE-mediated reactions. The observation that IgE of atopic subjects bind HRFs at variance with the IgE of nonatopic individuals suggests that these molecules have an unequivocal clinical weight. There is a factor inhibiting HRF (HRIF) in relation with NAP-1/IL 8 (at the same time an HRF and an HRIF), a protein of 8,000 Da derived from PBMCs, B and T lymphocytes and possibly alveolar macrophages, whose generation is augmented by normal histamine concentrations, hence suggesting a feedback mechanism inhibiting the histamine itself, which can thus regulate HRF activities.

Transendothelial migration of activated lymphocytes from the blood into the tissues is an essential step for immune functions, which may be arrested by Zap-70 deficiency (Chap. 22). Preceded by inflammatory mediator release, causing vasodilation and blood flow deceleration, this preliminary step allowing the cascade to proceed, as mentioned in the preceding section via HEVs, influences leukocyte rolling [23] . Up-regulated CD62s, mainly CD62P, with a long molecular structure that extends above the surrounding glycocalyx, have the task of capturing passing leukocytes expressing appropriate receptors ( Fig. 1.59) [209, 230, 328] ; moreover, CD62L is localized on the tips of microvilli, a first point of contact with the endothelium [348] . Ensuing passages are orchestrated by chemokines and integrins, preceded by T-cell rolling with selectin interactions (CD15, CD62L Fig. 1.59 . Leukocyte trafficking and adhesion cascade. Sequential steps in leukocyte recruitment, their adhesion to endothelium and transendothelial migration (see text). (Modified from [209, 230, 328]) brane and migrate across lymphoid tissues [522] . A recent study indicated that activation of integrin avidity to endothelial ligands by endothelium-displayed chemoattractants (or chemokines) can take place within fractions of a seconds and can promote both reversible rolling adhesions or immediate conversion of leukocyte rolling to firm arrest on vascular ligands [187] . Obviously the adhesion required is not too strong, otherwise it would lead to cell immobilization [226] (Fig. 1.61 ). In step 4, lymphocytes cross intercellular HEV junctions, allowing them to enter HEVs: the entire process of lymphocyte sticking to HEVs takes only 1-3 s and step 4 10 min [454] . In humans, as many as 5\u00a510 6 lymphocytes leak from blood via HEVs every second [454] . Even if the equilibrium among variables stabilizes with speed, relatively small changes in integrin expression or integrin-ligand affinity, or cell-substratum adhesiveness, can lead to substantial changes in migration speed [406] . Several integrins govern interactions: the initial ones are mediated by CD62L recognizing CD34 and Gly-CAM-1 (Table 1 .50). After activation, lymphocytes firmly adhere to endothelial cells since b2 integrins interact with IgSF members on both endothelium and G-protein-coupled receptors [162] . During stage 3, CD11a/ CD18 inhibit lymphocyte migration via CD54 and CD102 HEV counter-receptors, playing the major role [534] . Then lymphocytes migrate, using b1 integrins, to and CLA of lymphocytes, CD62P and CD62E on endothelium) and by integrin stimulation (activated by CD31 and chemokines). Functional activation of integrin receptors on lymphocytes, above all CD2, CD28 and PDGF, and signal transduction regulating adhesion point to a PI3K primary role, in turn activated by chemokines and receptors sensitive to G proteins [521] . After conformational modifications of the cells and integrins ensure a strong adhesiveness, lymphocytes undergo diapedesis (Fig. 1.60) , and their migration between endothelial cells in extravascular spaces is followed by directional cues from chemoattractants ( Fig. 1.61 ) [534] . The process continues within the inflamed tissues, generating additional mediators and ILs. The initiation of endothelial activation, which modulates selectins binding carbohydrate ligands, often displayed on mucin-like molecules, is responsible for the initial tethering of a flowing lymphocyte to the vessel wall and for a transient rolling along the endothelial cells (step 1). Tethering contributes to chemoattractantmediated adhesion, resulting in integrin triggering and binding to endothelial ligands (step 2). The sound T-cell adhesion is modulated by G proteins, whose signals activate strong integrin adhesiveness, which binds IgSF on endothelium (step 3) and the transendothelial migration (step 4).

CD62E governs PAF production, which together with other endothelial cells with activating properties, expresses IL 1 and integrins such as CD11a/CD18, CD11b/CD18, etc. [65] . As a consequence, the CD106/receptor CD49d/29 duo represents the greater association of adhesive molecules in eosinophil recruitment and extravasation, to be directed to in vivo inflamed sites [624] . Eosinophils, following what is outlined by Fig. 1.59 , supported by CD49d/CD29, adhere to endothelial cell membranes supplied with CD106 and are activated; expressing CD11a/CD18 bind to CD54 and CD102, then transmigrate into the underlying mucosa. In brief, the key points are as follows [230] : \u2211 Cell recruitment mediated by T cells by means of IL 4 , IL 5 , RANTES and MIP-1a. \u2211 Selectin (CD62E, CD62P and CD62L) and ligand (CD34, GlyCAM-1) selective expression on endothelial cells produced by ILs and mediators. \u2211 Integrin (CD11a/CD18, CD11b/CD18, CD49d/CD29) selective activation induced by ILs, CCL and CXCL chemokines and chemoattractants. \u2211 IgSF (CD54, CD102, CD106) selective expression induced by ILs: above all CD106 specifically expressed by ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 209, "end": 214, "text": "[624]", "ref_id": "BIBREF604"}, {"start": 385, "end": 389, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 585, "end": 590, "text": "[624]", "ref_id": "BIBREF604"}, {"start": 881, "end": 886, "text": "[230]", "ref_id": "BIBREF211"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 636, "end": 645, "text": "Fig. 1.59", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Leukocyte Trafficking and Migration"}, {"text": "Several observations clearly show that the immune system interacts with other communication systems of our organism such as the endocrine apparatus and central nervous system (CNS). There are important correlations between ILs and neuropeptides: after its release from nervous tissue termination, SP is able to increase transcriptions at the gene level and synthesize and secrete IL 1 , IL 6 and TNF-a, with an effect on stromal cells, GM-CSF, G-CSF and M-CSF, and consequent neutrophil, basophil, macrophage and eosinophil adhesion and activation, thus modulating the effector stages of type I and type IV reactions. Interconnections with neuroendocrine circuits are complex: SP and VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) are involved in the control of IL 2 production by T lymphocytes, while IL 1 and IL 1 R are present in neurones and endocrine glands. IL 2 and IL 6 alter the proliferation pattern of anterior pituitary cells, as well as GH,ACTH and prolactin secretion, while IL 5 , IL 7 , IL 9 and TGF-b are involved in the regulation of neurodifferentiation [493] . Indirectly, an initial event such as an infection or a tissue lesion of less impact can trigger polysaccharide or ECM protein release, which stimulates tissue macrophages to release TNF-a. TNF-a-exposed endothelial cells express adhesion molecules to attract first PBMCs and then T cells to recognize APCexpressed antigens. TNF-a acting on these cells mediates IL 1 start-up, inducing phagocytes, T lymphocytes and endothelial cells to produce IL 6 [326] . The integrinlinked kinase (ILK), colocalizing with the b1-integrin subunit, is expressed in various regions of the CNS. ILK staining revealed that it is enriched in neurons and is an important effector in NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth [353] . Some ILs induce the acute-phase response (APR) in the liver, and CSs stimulate APP production, whereas they block TNF-a, IL 1 and IL 6 actions. These ILs act independently on the hypothalamus-hypophysis-adrenal (HPA) axis, but also display synergic effects: TNF-a and IL 6 act on the hypothalamus inducing fever. In addition IL 6 causes a concentration of cortisol and corticotrophin that is higher than the levels obtained with the greatest stimulation of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH). How IL 6 can reach the CRH hypothalamic neurones is not known; however, it is possible that IL 6 is produced by endothelial and glial cells stimulated by TNF-a and IL 1 . CNS and the endocrine system also mount inflammatory responses: for example, they generate b-endorphin endowed with a local analgesic action. CRH and probably also arginine-vasopressin have a pro-inflammatory activity; in particular CRH is found in inflamed areas, most likely produced locally by postganglionic sympathetic neurones [326] . Appendix 1.4 [326] concludes the issue of neuroendocrine interactions with the immune system: for example, prolactin amplifies IL 2 production, b-endorphins, and melanotonin, which are active on T and B lymphocytes. IL 4 on epithelial cells is an important regulatory moment in eosinophil adhesion to epithelium and antigendriven migration [578] . \u2211 TNF-a has been demonstrated to have an important role in the expression of adhesion molecules that induce transendothelial migration of eosinophils [534] . Neutrophils in normal conditions are absent or poorly represented on endothelium, being expressed after activation. These cells in the early phase roll on activated endothelial vessel walls, accompanied by a mast cell histamine-modulated increase in vascular permeability, a process mediated by CD62P expressed on neutrophils [154] . PAF is released at these sites and in perspective can elicit, together with SP, the chemotactic movement of parallel activated neutrophils, which strongly adhere to endothelium and proceed to transendothelial migration. Lipoxin A4 modulates transmigration of human neutrophils across intestinal epithelial monolayers [90] (see also Chap. 11). In the late phase, LPS and ILs (IL 1 , IFN, TNF, etc.) with inflammatory action stimulate CD62P on endothelial cells, expression of CD54, IL 8 release, and CD62L and CD15s activation on neutrophils which, via CD15s, CD62E and CD62P specific binding, continue their rolling along vessel walls, adhesion modulated by CD11b/CD18/CD54, activation and diapedesis [19, 154] . However, cell migration can be different as a consequence of an eicosanoid exposure, although neutrophil retention in a specific anatomical site could play an important role in mucosal defense [90] . Selectins mediate the initial rolling contacts of monocytes with the endothelium. Firm adhesion to the endothelium is the second step and involves other adhesion molecules such as CD11a, CD11b, CD18, and VLA-4 on monocyteds and CD54 and VCAM-1 on endothelial cells. The adherence to endothelial cells is modulated by endothelin-1 via the involvement of Src (p60src), JAK1-like kinases, and vascular endothelium growth factor by an increased flt-1 expression by monocyes. The final step is monocyte transmigration into the subendothelial space [609] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1062, "end": 1067, "text": "[493]", "ref_id": "BIBREF492"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1524, "text": "[326]", "ref_id": "BIBREF326"}, {"start": 1763, "end": 1768, "text": "[353]", "ref_id": "BIBREF353"}, {"start": 2772, "end": 2777, "text": "[326]", "ref_id": "BIBREF326"}, {"start": 2793, "end": 2798, "text": "[326]", "ref_id": "BIBREF326"}, {"start": 3120, "end": 3125, "text": "[578]", "ref_id": "BIBREF577"}, {"start": 3278, "end": 3283, "text": "[534]", "ref_id": "BIBREF553"}, {"start": 3612, "end": 3617, "text": "[154]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 3937, "end": 3941, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 4321, "end": 4325, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 4326, "end": 4330, "text": "154]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 4526, "end": 4530, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 5076, "end": 5081, "text": "[609]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interrelations with Other Organs"}, {"text": "A primary function of epithelial cells is to maintain vascular integrity.

This immunity is based on the genetic constitution of individuals. To avoid infections and prevent access of pathogens or potentially pathogenic microorganisms, present in the environment and on the body surface lying in direct contact with the environment, the host has evolved a series of sophisticated defense systems, closely integrated among themselves. The achievement of protective immunity against invading pathogens relies on sensing specific molecular features expressed in microorganisms and depends on the ability to elicit the pertinent type of immune response to fight a specific pathogen. Germline-encoded receptor molecules enable the cells of the innate immune system to recognize structural components conserved among classes of microorganisms [449] . The recognition of microbial products by the host innate immune system rapidly triggers appropriate responses to contain the infection and regulate the development of adaptive immunity. The exposure to microbial antigens primes several ILs and proinflammatory mediators that affect T cell differentiation and are rapidly produced by APCs, such as DCs and macrophages [366, 447] . Recent data show that IL 1 R and IL 18 R are key molecules in both the innate and acquired immunity and are members of a larger family of related receptors, some of which contribute to host defense [526] . Table 1 .1 shows the differences between innate and acquired immunity, which is instructed by soluble and cellular components of innate immunity to select the appropriate antigens coincidentally with strategies devised for their elimination (Fig. 1.62 ) [148] . Natural immunity is realized by skin, mucosal barriers and secretion protective effects, phagocyte cells, complement, and additional biological activity of nonspecific factors.Among them there are proteins coded in the germline, employed by innate immunity to recognize potentially noxious substances [148] . Such proteins are either soluble or have the form of surface receptors: for example, macrophage phagocyte particles or soluble glycoconjugates linked with the mannose receptor, a C-type lectin with a wide specificity for carbohydrates, and in addition an LPS receptor, LBP (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein) [536] . Bacteria coated with innate immune surfactants or MBP (mannose-binding protein), often including complement activated by the alternate (innate immune) pathway, are opsonized and more readily phagocytosed. In this process the receptors for antibodies and complement of macrophages and neutrophils are important, so that the coating of microorganisms with antibodies, complement, or both enhances phagocytosis. The engulfed microorganisms are subjected to a wide range of toxic intracellular molecules, including O 2 \u2022-, hydroxyl radicals, hypochlorous acid, NO, antimicrobial cationic proteins and peptides, and lysozyme [115] . LCs become activated and behave as APCs when pattern-recognition receptors on their surface recognize distinctive pathogen-associated molecular patterns on the surface 1. Anatomic barriers, or physicochemical barriers, offer not only a mechanical, but also chemical protection, performed via production of biological molecules with antibacterial activity, including lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, lipase, spermine and fatty acids with bactericidal power. Skin is provided with the stratum corneum, which by means of its physiological desquamation resists penetration of a great number of microbes. In addition, it is normally impermeable to the greater part of infectious agents, because of bacteriostatic, bactericidal and fungicidal effects of triglycerides, free fatty acids and lactic acid, present in sebaceous secretions and sweat, which also contains lysozyme. As a compensation of the thinner epithelial stratum, mucus-capturing microorganisms are present on mucosal surfaces, subsequently removed from airways by the mucociliary apparatus. The secreted mucus layer overlays the epithelium in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts, and the epithelial cilia sweep away this mucus layer, permitting it to be constantly refreshed after it has been contaminated with inhaled or ingested particles. Invaders are transported with a continuous cycle from bronchioles to the pharynx, a protective action that extends to the stomach HCl with bactericidal action. Saliva, swallowing, peristalsis and defecation mechanically expel microorganisms from the gastrointestinal system [353] . Salivation, lacrimation, and coughing, are further mechanisms that are very effective in reducing bacterial assaults: patients presenting with severe changes in lacrimation and salivation (Sj\u00f6gren syndrome) suffer from severe eye infections and tooth caries. Nasal secretion and saliva contribution are significant, provided with mucopolysaccharides inactivating some viruses of anaerobic germs associated with the normal intestinal bacterial flora, both preventing pathogen attachment via competition for essential nutrients and/or production of inhibiting substances as well as urinary flow ensuring unremitting cleansing. Basic proteins, such as lysine, arginine, spermine, spermidine and particular gps, among others transferrin, make additional contributions [47] . 2. PAA, important associates of innate immunity, integrate mechanisms that rapidly come into play, with a notably crucial result when the innate system faces the first encounter with infectious agents, since it will take from 4 to 15 days before elaborating antibodies and cytotoxic cells. Not all germs are assaulted with identical means and proportions: in biological fluids and interstitial spaces, the intervention of factors bound to antibodies and complement is more germane, unlike parenchyma where phenomena of cell immunity prevail (ILs, cytotoxic cells). 2a. Lysozyme, produced by macrophages and neutrophils, is found in salivary, lacrimal, nasal secretions, intestinal and respiratory mucus, lymph nodes and spleen. It is able to split b-glycoside bindings, in particular b 1-4 links between N-acetylglucosamine and of microorganisms [345] . Such common constituents of Gram-bacteria external membrane signal infectious agents triggering IL 1 , IL 6 , IL 12 and TNF-a synthesis, thus eliciting an APR [31] , stimulate macrophages and other cells, as well as CD4 differentiation and growth [148] . Current data show that IL 1 R and IL 18 R are key molecules in both the innate and adaptive immunity, and are members of a larger family of related receptors, some of which contribute to host defense [525] and that IL 22 directly promotes the innate, nonspecific immunity of tissues [650] . IL 22 induces APRs in the liver, which suggests that IL 22 plays a role in innate immunity via induction of an inflammatory process [129] . Attractive data support the concept that potential prophylactic and therapeutic results are expected from IL 17 A and IL 17 F in host defense against bacterial infection. The IL 25 activity associated with systemic and localized Th2 responses offers an experimental basis to modulate Th2-associated allergic diseases [249] . Some NK cells posses lectinlike membrane receptors involved in the recognition of target cells destined to cytolysis [289] . Complement is activated when the alternative pathway interacts with particles rich in carbohydrates but lacking sialic acid, or the classic pathway is stimulated by collectins, which bind to specific carbohydrates [210] . It is understandable why, unlike acquired immunity, its innate immunity has a more complex organization: constituents are soluble cells and factors with different structure and function, sometimes acting on different targets, but on the whole often become in turn integrated [148] . Recent studies have individuated the TcRgd, which also in natural immunity precedes an ab in antigen responses, thus influencing ab-expressed IL pattern, discriminating between pathogens [152] . In this way, gd could begin to supervise ab responses to infectious agents due to their much earlier activation and conversion to memory [210] . A similar control could be extended to NK cells [287] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1000, "end": 1005, "text": "[449]", "ref_id": "BIBREF471"}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1380, "text": "[366,", "ref_id": "BIBREF384"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1385, "text": "447]", "ref_id": "BIBREF469"}, {"start": 1586, "end": 1591, "text": "[526]", "ref_id": "BIBREF545"}, {"start": 1848, "end": 1853, "text": "[148]", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2162, "text": "[148]", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 2475, "end": 2480, "text": "[536]", "ref_id": "BIBREF555"}, {"start": 3103, "end": 3108, "text": "[115]", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 4705, "end": 4710, "text": "[353]", "ref_id": "BIBREF353"}, {"start": 5477, "end": 5481, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 6330, "end": 6335, "text": "[345]", "ref_id": "BIBREF345"}, {"start": 6497, "end": 6501, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 6585, "end": 6590, "text": "[148]", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 6793, "end": 6798, "text": "[525]", "ref_id": "BIBREF544"}, {"start": 6811, "end": 6813, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 6876, "end": 6881, "text": "[650]", "ref_id": "BIBREF649"}, {"start": 6887, "end": 6889, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 7016, "end": 7021, "text": "[129]", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 7341, "end": 7346, "text": "[249]", "ref_id": "BIBREF249"}, {"start": 7466, "end": 7471, "text": "[289]", "ref_id": "BIBREF308"}, {"start": 7688, "end": 7693, "text": "[210]", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 7971, "end": 7976, "text": "[148]", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 8166, "end": 8171, "text": "[152]", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 8311, "end": 8316, "text": "[210]", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 8367, "end": 8372, "text": "[287]", "ref_id": "BIBREF306"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1594, "end": 1601, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1835, "end": 1845, "text": "(Fig. 1.62", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Innate Immunity"}, {"text": "The natural defenses, the skin and mucosal barriers, are strengthened by mucosal secretions containing sIgA, able to complex with antigens and to identify antibodies capable of their recognition, and to complex in turn with antigens. Activation of the complement cascade can lead to directly destroying undesired hosts or to facilitating their phagocytosis. Complement and phagocytes are the first to activate when an infection approaches, supplying host defenses with notable contributions by means of a nonspecific protection against invasive pathogens, also without antibodies and/or T CTLs intervening [531] . Therefore specific immune mechanisms act in concert with those of innate immunity. We will examine: 1. Anatomic barriers: skin, mucus, and secretions 2. Proteins with anti-infectious activity (PAA): a) Lysozyme b) IFN c) Complement d) APP or pentraxins 3. Phagocytes: neutrophils and macrophages N-acetylmuramic acid, a normal constituent of several bacterial cell walls. 2b. IFN a, b, g, have several effects, including a timely antiviral activity, especially IFN-l1-3 (IL 28a , IL 28b , IL 29 ) [377] . All IFN-a, -b, -w, and -l subtypes are expressed in influenza-virus-infected monocyte-derived DCs and PDCs [88] . It is significant that IFN-g induce in murine B cells the IgG 1 isotype switch that increases phagocytosis, activating the complement classic pathway and linking macrophage Fc receptors [148] . 2c. Complement [241, 633] represents, together with antibodies, the main component of the humoral defense system against microorganisms. If activated it participates in host protection in a specific and nonspecific way, intervening, besides phagocytosis, with functions divided into lytic and nonlytic, such as chemotaxis, opsonization and anaphylactogen activity (Table 1 .59) [241] . In addition, with its receptors, it acts on B-cell antibody synthesis, immune memory, and CIC solubilization and clearance [159] (Tables 1.60, 1.61) [241, 260, 474] . From a simplistic viewpoint among immune reactions, complement is comparable to a motor vehicle, while antibody is an ignition key: indeed, once antibody has recognized the non-self molecule, it has specific functions, including complement activation and its fixation on the cell surface [633] . Complement components, provided with defensive and immunoregulatory properties, are normally present in the bloodstream in an inactive state and all act in concert, but each must be sequentially activated and in suitable conditions (a relatively small starting signal is sufficient), so that the typical mechanism of cascade reaction is triggered [633] . The primary source of such proteins is the liver, with smaller contributions from tissue macrophages, epithelial cells of the gastroenteric tract, and PBMCs. Like Igs, it is hypothesized that they arose late in evolution and are found only in vertebrates [36] . Complement is formed by >25 serum proteins interacting with nine functional components, designated C1-C9, reflecting the orderly sequence of their activation, with the exception of C4, which is activated after C1 and before C2. As regards nomenclature, a horizontal bar over a component denotes active enzyme activity of either a protein or a protein complex; proteins that become inactivated either by enzymatic cleavage or internal rearrangement are prefixed a small i (iC3); small postscripts a and b (C3a, C3b) indicate the biologically active fragments of a component; C1 subunits are designated q, r, s. The C1 complex consists of C1q, two molecules of C1r, and two molecules of C1s which bind to antibodies bound to an anti- gen on the surface of a bacterial cell [345] . Letters of the Latin alphabet, P, B, D (initials of properdin, factor B, factor D), designate the alternative pathway; factor B is divided into a small fragment (Ba) and a larger one (Bb) [648] .

This pathway is so called because it was described first, it is more effective, but to be activated requires the presence of acquired immunity. The initial seed is C1q, the first component, with a MW of 400 kD, which inter-acts with antigen-antibody complexes, or with IgM or IgG 1-3 . To activate IgM, with a much higher MW, a single pentameric IgM is sufficient, with IgG 3 ,IgG 1 and IgG 2 following in an orderly fashion. IgA, IgD, IgE, and IgG 4 cannot bind to C1q; consequently no such antibody is able to activate this pathway. Complement interactions with natural antibodies are of crucial significance for the host, being inhibited complement-mediated autoimmune reactions [350] . More rarely, activation may be mounted by various substances, including bacterial LPS, CRP, certain viruses, etc. Activated C1q activates C1r, which, in turn, activates C1s, with MWs of 95 and 85 kD, respectively, to form a C1 complex. C1s, if activated, is able to act on its natural substrates, namely C4 and C2 [633] . above substances initiate the alternative pathway. There is evidence that thioesters are present in the native forms of complement proteins C3 and C4 and that their molecular conformational changes dramatically on activation [122] . C3b is a 77 amino acid residue polypeptide and following the above-mentioned changes exposes the thioester bond, which is very reactive, and interacts with amine (-NH 2 ) and hydroxyl (-OH) on proteins and carbohydrates, allowing C3b a rapid covalent link to other biomolecules, since the thioester halflife is 60 ms while that of native C3 is >200 h [470] . Therefore, thioester hydrolysis ensures that activated molecules do not diffuse away from the activation site to bystander cells of the host [122] . As is seen in Tables 1.60, 1.61, C3 is distributed to different receptors (CR1, CR3, CR2) through its ligands (C3b, iC3b, C3dg), thus being capable of interacting with different cell types and bringing about a large spectrum of biological functions (Table 1 .59), considering that C3b also has opsonizing properties [18] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 205, "end": 210, "text": "[618]", "ref_id": "BIBREF598"}, {"start": 895, "end": 900, "text": "[350]", "ref_id": "BIBREF350"}, {"start": 1217, "end": 1222, "text": "[633]", "ref_id": "BIBREF613"}, {"start": 1450, "end": 1455, "text": "[122]", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 1809, "end": 1814, "text": "[470]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1958, "end": 1963, "text": "[122]", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 2282, "end": 2286, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2215, "end": 2223, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Innate Immunity"}, {"text": "When the common final pathway is activated, C5-C9 assembly and activation constitute the lytic activity of complement on target cells.

This complex acts as a C3 convertase and, similarly to the classic pathway, releases C3a and C3b from C3, allowing C3b to resume its properties, increasing C3 convertase and C3 activated levels.A closed circuit is established, where the alternative pathway acts as a positive feedback loop with active amplification; therefore more substrate is cleft, more C3b results.

Consequently, this amplification is balanced by a rapid C3bBb complex dissociation. The P binding stabilizes this enzyme.

Complement thereby plays an essential role in each humoral defense system against external aggressions. A particular characteristic of this system is the lack of action specificity and intervention against harmful agents of varying nature, although antibody responses form a substantial way of activation; however, such aspecificity, if on the one hand it allows notable savings of selective defense systems, on the other hand it can foster an aggressive response against host components [159] . Table 1 .59 and Fig.1 .64 [18] document how complement actively participates in host defense and inflammation, and Tables 1.60 and 1.61 summarize both features and functions of complement receptors and regulatory proteins. Several cells are expressed, namely, known integrins including CR3 (CD11b/18) and CR4 (CD11c/18) [53] , CR2 (CD21), able to activate B lymphocytes, and CR1 (CD35) distributed to human red cells. Some proteins act as regulators, just to control undesired activities: CR1, DAF (decay accelerating factor), CD55 and MCP (membrane cofactor protein), or CD46, prevent the formation of a full C3-splitting enzyme and related biological effects; CD59 or MACIF (membrane attack complex inhibitory factor) and C8 bp (protein binding C8) or HRF (homologous restriction factor) preclude a full MAC development [241] . During the activation C3a, C4a, C5 anaphylotoxins are up-regulated, genetically correlated, but also efficient in different ways (C5ak C3ak C4a), for which phagocytes, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells express receptors, also mediating infectious germ contact with antibodies, complement and phagocytes. C5a, generated by activa-tion of both complement pathways, is the most chemotactic for PMNs, also inducing their microbicidal activity [648] . Anaphylotoxins are active but with a negative role in inflammation, causing aspecific release of histamine and other mediators from metachromatic cells and their consequent degranulation, increasing vascular permeability. C5a is much more active in provoking bronchoconstriction and smooth muscle contraction, it binds to specific receptors on bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, vascular smooth cells, endothelium, etc., delivering an unexpected up-regulation to various target cells. C5a also couples with a G protein transducing signals to the cell [637] . Additional active complement fragments deliver biological activity: macrophage distension by Bb fragment, Ba fragment is chemotactic, C2 kinin (C2 fragment) increases vascular permeability, and C3e (Table 1 .59) increases circulating leukocyte titers mobilizing medullary reserves [18] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 439, "end": 444, "text": "[260]", "ref_id": "BIBREF260"}, {"start": 935, "end": 940, "text": "[159]", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 969, "end": 973, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1263, "end": 1267, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1765, "end": 1770, "text": "[241]", "ref_id": "BIBREF222"}, {"start": 2220, "end": 2225, "text": "[648]", "ref_id": "BIBREF647"}, {"start": 2785, "end": 2790, "text": "[637]", "ref_id": "BIBREF636"}, {"start": 3074, "end": 3078, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 943, "end": 950, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 959, "end": 964, "text": "Fig.1", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 2991, "end": 2999, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Innate Immunity"}, {"text": "To confirm such collaboration of two levels of immunity, we mention that CD19, a component of acquired immunity, is associated with CD21 receptor of C3d and thus is part of innate immunity [571] .

Regarding infectious diseases, recent studies have demonstrated the substantial defense capabilities of C3 and C4. Fixation of PSAs, with C3d support, to FDCs and B cells of the marginal zone equipped with CD21 on their surface shows that an important anti-infective function is played by the spleen [423] , scarce in babies tions, promote the repair of damaged tissue, and thus participate in the humoral machinery that makes up a second defensive strategy.

Further capsules containing sialic acid are very poor activators of the alternative pathway in the absence of antibody, in addition to representing an effective defense barrier [159] . Endotoxin (an LPS) and its receptor CD14 [537] is a cell-wall component of the outer membrane of Gram-bacteria, which can thus be protected, either because they activate complement at a safe distance from their outer walls, disposing of long lateral polysaccharide chains, or because they are released directly from bacterial walls in a soluble form [97] . Early in life, endotoxin promotes the development of Th1 CD4 + T cells at the expense of proallergic Th2 CD4 + T cells. Evidence suggests that the lack of endotoxin in the environment might lead to a higher incidence of asthma [537] . A further protective technique employed by bacteria is to release enzymes activating complement proteins adherent to their walls, or borrowing molecules regulatory of their function from host cells, namely, CD55 and CD59, utilized for protection from lysis, as is the case of HIV isolated from cells of patients with current AIDS [484] .

Phagocytes fulfill basilar functions of nonspecific defense: one of their main assignments is to present selected antigens to T and B lymphocytes. The cells are divided into circulating, including granulocytes, macrophages and eosinophils, and nondividing, the macrophages ( Fig.1.32 c, d, e) distributed throughout body tissues and assuming specialized structures and functions related to the different locations where they operate such as Kupffer's cells and splenic macrophages in the red pulp (clearance of corpuscular elements and soluble factors), LCs and splenic macrophages in the white pulp and lymph nodes (processing and presentation of the antigen to T cells), and finally bone marrow macrophages (growth and differentiation of hemopoietic cells) (Table 1 .63) [352] . IFN-a sensitizes macrophages to microbial recognition by up-regulating the TLR3, TLR4 expression also enhancing the MyD88 (myeloid differentiation protein gene), TIR (Toll/IL 1 R), TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-b (TRIF), IKKh, RIP-1, IL 28 and IL 29 genes expression [529] . Mast cells are provided with phagocytic activity [348] and therefore able to orchestrate, for host protection, inflammatory responses against invading microbes, in addition to tissue damage by antibody-independent activation [168] . Mast cells are to-day seen as a sentinel in host defense against bacterial infections, and evidence for their involvement in early responses to viral and fungal pathogens is growing. Mast cells are activated during innate immune responses by multiple mechanisms, including well-established responses to complement com-ponents. Changes in vascular permeability induced by early release of preformed mediators and lipid mediators enhance the availability of complement components and some initial inflammatory cells to the site of infection [332, 347] . Mast cell proteases have also been demonstrated to play critical roles in vivo in the recruitment of both neutrophils and eosinophils to sites of inflammation [502] and an immune complex hypersensitivity reaction in the synovium [347] . Circulating and nondividing cells, PMNs (Fig. 1.32 ) have CR1, CR3 receptors, for IgG Fc fragments and several others (Table 1 .64) [18] . PMNs recruited to the site of injury ingest the intruders, bacteria, foreign materials or damaged tissues: IgGs and C3b are dedicated to coating infecting particles, promoting both opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis. Prominent is the role played by monocytes, numerically inferior to PMNs, but with the advantage of not being terminal cells and changing into tissue macrophages, two to three times larger than PMNs, readily recruited during local inflammatory or degenerative processes [345] . When the inflammatory process initiates, macrophages instigate a bit of a delayed maneuver, whereas PMNs, more mobile, are the first to accrue, perhaps facilitated by IL 5 augmenting IgA production (Table 1.5), but above all by IAPs (integrin associated proteins, CD47), which activate PMNs, even in extravascular sites [302] . Such cells are also termed professional phagocytes, because they are provided with membrane receptors for IgG 1 and IgG 3 Fc fragments and C3b fragment. Nonspecific inflammatory reactions are the first components of innate immunity to appear in the phylogenesis, and it seems likely that such primitive responses have influenced the immune responses' evolution. In this sense, Th response polarization could have been an evolutive consequence of nonspecific responses of a divergent sign directed to counteract different types of infection [470] . Macrophages and NK cells exemplify the primitive limb of IFN-g-dependent immune responses required for defense against infection with virus and other intracellular invaders, whereas metachromatic cells could have evolved to combat extracellular parasites [470] . Macrophages, perhaps the phylogenetically more ancient immune cells, can secrete IFN-g due to their IL 18 synthesis [669] . Stimulated, moreover, by bacterial and viral contact and primed by CD14 a receptor that functions with TLR4 in LPS responses [194] and gd T cells [111] , in the first stages, macrophages release TNF-a and IL 12 , which synergize with T-cell generated IL 2 and macrophagegenerated IL 15 [68] , and both prime NK cells [583] to express IFN-g [146] . IFN-g and IL 18 form two potent stimuli to suppress IgE responses [421, 669] , enhancing macrophages' microbicidal power. This power is necessary for macrophages to combat invasions by endocellular facultative microorganisms, particularly resistant to the phagocyte microbicidal action despite Igs opsonization. Microorganisms duplicate within the macrophages; however, the trapped intruders are not killed: CD8 T cells, as if NK-cell and IFN-g protective activity should be hampered to avoid unwelcome effects for the host [43] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 776, "end": 781, "text": "[352]", "ref_id": "BIBREF352"}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1036, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1069, "text": "[529]", "ref_id": "BIBREF548"}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1126, "text": "[348]", "ref_id": "BIBREF348"}, {"start": 1297, "end": 1302, "text": "[168]", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1849, "text": "[332,", "ref_id": "BIBREF332"}, {"start": 1850, "end": 1854, "text": "347]", "ref_id": "BIBREF347"}, {"start": 2016, "end": 2021, "text": "[502]", "ref_id": "BIBREF501"}, {"start": 2086, "end": 2091, "text": "[347]", "ref_id": "BIBREF347"}, {"start": 2226, "end": 2230, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2725, "end": 2730, "text": "[345]", "ref_id": "BIBREF345"}, {"start": 3053, "end": 3058, "text": "[302]", "ref_id": "BIBREF321"}, {"start": 3601, "end": 3606, "text": "[470]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3864, "end": 3869, "text": "[470]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3988, "end": 3993, "text": "[669]", "ref_id": "BIBREF668"}, {"start": 4121, "end": 4126, "text": "[194]", "ref_id": "BIBREF194"}, {"start": 4142, "end": 4147, "text": "[111]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 4279, "end": 4281, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 4282, "end": 4286, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 4313, "end": 4318, "text": "[583]", "ref_id": "BIBREF582"}, {"start": 4336, "end": 4341, "text": "[146]", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 4357, "end": 4359, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 4410, "end": 4415, "text": "[421,", "ref_id": "BIBREF420"}, {"start": 4416, "end": 4420, "text": "669]", "ref_id": "BIBREF668"}, {"start": 4868, "end": 4872, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 278, "end": 286, "text": "Fig.1.32", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 762, "end": 770, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 2134, "end": 2144, "text": "(Fig. 1.32", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 2212, "end": 2220, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Innate Immunity"}, {"text": "To adhere to microbes, neutrophils engage CD11b/ CD18, potentially playing a vital role in cell activation and triggering the oxidative and nonoxidative apparatus in an attempt to destroy the invader (or the host tissues), while adhesion mechanisms provide an environment where killing can progress protected by tissue fluids [154] .

Differently from tissue eosinophils, present at the level of epithelial surfaces and in contact with the environment, fixed and circulating PMNs are absent from tissues until they are recruited from the bloodstream as a result of tissue damage. To meet this demand, a variety of chemotactic factors can potentially regulate PMN recruitment and migration to the site of inflammation: these stimuli yield chemotaxin production and, in ever greater concentrations, attract circulating PMNs to capillaries around the site of injury, where they actively insinuate themselves between endothelial cells. Studies have verified that if PMN migration is delayed as little as 2 h, their capacity to localize the inflammatory process is severely jeopardized [311] .Among the more known chemotactic factors, we enlist FMLP, LTB 4 and C5a, which certainly play the most important role [345] .

CGD especially results from genetic defects in the various components of NADPH-oxidase, a potent enzyme that is central in the respiratory burst.

Opsonization (from the Greek \"ojwnein,\" acquire foods and therefore prepare for eating) is a not immunological contact between cells and bacteria, mediated by the opsonin family comprising Igs, CR3, CR4, and FN. Igs contribute chiefly via IgM, IgG 1 and IgG 3 with CD23 or CD64, interacting with epitopes on bacteria via its Fab portions, while C3b and iC3b -induced by both classic and alternative pathways -adhere to the bacterial (or other intruder) surface to approach neutrophils. Antibody fixation also allows activation of the complement classic pathway so that the Fc portion, Clq and C3 act synergically to facilitate the capture of bacteria from phagocytes. Complement proteins exercise an important conclusion of Ig-mediated opsonization, because CR and FcR concurrent involvement often fulfills a marked synergic action in activating phagocytes and stimulating their functions. In this context, addition of complement to Ig-opsonized bacteria promotes phagocytosis, in parallel reducing the Ig number necessary for an efficient ingestion of bacteria [345] . An additional, potent opsonizing stimulus is supplied by tuftsin, a tetrapeptide (Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg) produced by the spleen. Its action appears to be indispensable, as demonstrated in patients with familial deficiency of this peptide and in splenectomized patients, who suffer from severe infections occurring with Candida, S. aureus, and Staphylococcal pneumoniae [311] . Macrophages, IgA and IgE receptors also play a striking role in opsonization. Lectins have been identified on different cell membranes, mainly macrophages, as receptors of mannose-fucose, galactose binding laminin, sialic acid or sialoadhesine, and b-glucan with specificity for CD11b/CD18. However, there are bacteria blocking opsonization or deviating C3b covalent binding and MAC adhesion to a position on the cell surface distant from the cell membrane where no defense mechanism can be invader. A roughly tenfold increase in the activity of the hexose monophosphate shunt is provided by an increase in the NADP/NADPH ratio, determined in turn by activity of the same oxidase and a chain of redox reactions involving glutathione. This enzyme system has the goal of transforming into H 2 O and O 2 the H 2 O 2 produced in excess and potentially toxic for cells. Catalase-positive bacteria cannot be killed by the phagocyte MPO/halide system, since they synthesize catalase destroying any excess H 2 O 2 they produce, whereas catalase-negative bacteria are killed, since they fail to stop H 2 O 2 production and trigger the MPO/halide system: for this reason in CGD patients they play the role of scavenger bacteria. Two oxidoreductive groups involved in the electron transport chain, namely flavine and cytochrome b558, are defective in the X-linked from (\u2248 60% of cases), but not in autosomal recessive CGD (\u2248 30%). Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), inherited as an X-linked disorder, also leads to impaired intracellular killing via the reduced glucose oxidation. MPO deficiency, inherited with an autosomal recessive pattern, is associated with susceptibility to systemic candidiasis, since intracellular killing is reduced and/or delayed (also greatly) as a result of impaired halide system function. MPO deficiency has a greater incidence than in the past, frequently as a casual laboratory finding in healthy subjects. The underlying basis of such defects is that the oxidative metabolism requires a notable O 2 consumption: O 2 \u2022is generated, reacts with two NADPH molecules and acquires an electron; the reaction takes a few seconds and is followed by bacteria adhesion and phagocytosis via PMNs.

This highly oxidant enzyme reacts in turn with halide (predominantly iodine and chloride) ions present in phagocytic vacuoles, catalyzing the halogenate reaction (iodination or chloruration), which is as toxic for microbial wall proteins. It should be noted that PNMs undergo apoptosis following an excessive necrotizing activity [630] (Fig. 1.34) . During oxidoreductive metabolism, additional O 2 radicals are generated (normally imprisoned within phagolysosomes), including 1 O 2 and OH radicals.

Human defensins stimulate IL 1 ,IL 8 , TNF-a release and decrease IL 10 release [489] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 333, "end": 338, "text": "[688]", "ref_id": "BIBREF676"}, {"start": 720, "end": 725, "text": "[169]", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}, {"start": 966, "end": 971, "text": "[660]", "ref_id": "BIBREF659"}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1059, "text": "[489]", "ref_id": "BIBREF488"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 150, "end": 158, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "O 2 -Independent Mechanisms"}, {"text": "Thus, like the cathelicidins, defensins can participate in immune defense in at least 2 ways, both killing bacteria and influencing the cellular innate and adaptive immune response [169] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 181, "end": 186, "text": "[169]", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O 2 -Independent Mechanisms"}, {"text": "Cathelicidins are a class of small cationic peptides that are an active component of mammalian innate immunity and are expressed at high levels in neutrophils, in skin and in other epithelial cells and can act as natural antibiotics by directly killing a wide range of microorganisms [118, 676] . About 30 different cathelicidins have been described in mammals, but so for only one has been identified in humans and one in mice. The human cathelicidin (LL-37) and the murine cathelicidinrelated antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) are both expressed by mast cells [118] . Recent findings suggest that their function is to disrupt the integrity of the microbial membrane, which is mediated by their cationic and amphipathic properties, which enable them to bind to negatively charged microbes and insert into their membranes [118] . Thus, after proteolytic cleavage the cathelicidin-like domain can contribute to innate host defense via inhibition of bacterial growth and limitation of cysteine-proteinase-mediated tissue damage, both functions being complementary to LL-37. LL-37 also represents a multifunctional effector molecule for innate immune defense of the skin [676] and for the local treatment of pulmonary infections [622] . In addition to the antimicrobial effects, LL-37 has been shown to have chemotactic effects on mast cells, which might aid in the migration and accumulation of mast cells at the site of inflammation in several diseases [382] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 284, "end": 289, "text": "[118,", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 290, "end": 294, "text": "676]", "ref_id": "BIBREF687"}, {"start": 558, "end": 563, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 818, "end": 823, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1169, "text": "[676]", "ref_id": "BIBREF687"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1227, "text": "[622]", "ref_id": "BIBREF602"}, {"start": 1448, "end": 1453, "text": "[382]", "ref_id": "BIBREF363"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O 2 -Independent Mechanisms"}, {"text": "A defensive role could be assigned to scavenger receptors, defined by their ability to carry on the following functions: \u2211 Macrophage activation and homing \u2211 Clearance of LPS, microbes and toxic substances \u2211 Phagocytosis of cells undergoing apoptosis \u2211 Antigen uptake and/or processing in the acquired immunity [420] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 311, "end": 316, "text": "[420]", "ref_id": "BIBREF419"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O 2 -Independent Mechanisms"}, {"text": "Macrophages use CD36, vitronectin and thrombospondin receptors to engulf cells undergoing apoptosis [165] . Eosinophils are additional cells active in innate immunity, since they arm against parasites and some forms of tumor cells the cytolytic activities of MBP and ECP their cationic proteins. ECP is able to perforate the tion of apoptosis mediated by viral genes (Table 1. 19) , to guarantee the species survival until genome replication and to counteract host responses to infection [192] . Several viral genes have binding sites either for NF-kB, which can assure their replication, as demonstrated for HTLV-I (human T-cell leukemia virus), or for IL and chemokine receptors (Table 1 .57) [688] , interfering with their activity and modulating virus evasion strategies [11] . Poxvirus proteins are able to block different arms of the host response against infection (complement activation, IL function, antigen presentation to T cells) or mimic host growth factors [11] . Thus, members of the family activating NF-kB have a key role in the induction of immune responses in mammals, including TLRs [353] . More positively, pathogen recognition, whether mediated via the TLRs or via the antigen-specific TcR and BcR, initiates the activation of distinct signal transduction pathways that activate NF-kB. Activation of NF-kB by these pathways is necessary for lymphocyte activation, expansion, and effector function in response to infection. However, IL 10 and CSs inhibit NF-kB [470] . Chemokines play a versatile role in the defense against infections, even viral: a rapid inflammatory response is expected to counteract bacterial and fungal pathogens, and in this context the fast chemokine induction was observed in several animal models and in clinical studies. Deletion of endogenous genes for MIP-1a in knockout mice provoke a great delay in influenza episode resolution, as well as a reduced CD8 T cell recruitment in infected airways [95] . Above all, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 are in the first line against AIDS, highly expressed in the lymph nodes of these patients [9] , and when some receptors (CXCR = a and CCR of b chemokine receptor) act as cofactors for HIV entry to macrophages (CCR3 and CCR5) and T cells (CXCR-4) [9, 83, 150] , chemokines have an anti-HIV effect primarily competing for receptor binding; thus MIP-1a, MIP-1b and RANTES bind to CCR5 and SDF-1 CXCR-4 [405] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 100, "end": 105, "text": "[165]", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 377, "end": 380, "text": "19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 488, "end": 493, "text": "[192]", "ref_id": "BIBREF192"}, {"start": 695, "end": 700, "text": "[688]", "ref_id": "BIBREF676"}, {"start": 775, "end": 779, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 971, "end": 975, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1108, "text": "[353]", "ref_id": "BIBREF353"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1459, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1482, "end": 1487, "text": "[470]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1946, "end": 1950, "text": "[95]", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 2074, "end": 2077, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2230, "end": 2233, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2234, "end": 2237, "text": "83,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2238, "end": 2242, "text": "150]", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 2383, "end": 2388, "text": "[405]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 367, "end": 376, "text": "(Table 1.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 681, "end": 689, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "O 2 -Independent Mechanisms"}, {"text": "Human TLRs belong to a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that aid to recognize microbial products derived from several classes of microbes, as well as endogenous ligands that represent a danger signal [448] . Transcripts for TLR4 and TLR2 were expressed in whole tissue extracts of fetal gut and skin [243] . The TLR7-, TLR8-, and TLR9-dependent induction of IFN-a/b and -l is strictly IRAK-4 dependent and plays an important role in protective immunity to most viruses in humans. IRAK-4-deficient patients may control viral infections by TLR3-and TLR4-dependent and/or TLR-independent production of IFNs. Thus 5 TLRs seem to play a crucial role in this innate immune response [662] . However, children who had defective signaling in the molecule IRAK-4 had a greatly increased risk for pyogenic infections [431] . TLRs are structurally characterized by a cytoplasmic TIR domain that, via the signal transduction factor essential for several TLR-mediated responses MyD88, connects the receptor to the intracellular signaling machinery shared by IL 1 and IL 18 [448] . LPS are associated with TLRs. TLR4 and TLR3 recognize LPS from Gram-bacteria [345] . The recognition of microbial components by TLRs leads to activation of innate immunity: progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms for LPS tolerance has been made through the analysis of TLR-mediated signaling pathways [491, 561] . So far the TLR family includes 11 members that have been identified [677] , which bind to microbial products, activating host defense responses. These TLRs and their signaling pathways are represented in such diverse creatures as mammals, fruit flies, and plants, and several of them appear to recognize specific microbial products, including LPS, bacterial DNA. TLR signaling represents a key component of the innate immune response to microbial infection [299] . The analysis of DC and PBMC activation has shown that TLR2 agonists are able to block the induction of IP-10, IL 12 p35, and IFN-g, but not IL 15 and IFN-b by TLR3 and TLR4. TLR2 stimulation led to rapid release of IL 10 that is responsible for inhibition of IP-10 and IL 12 p35 induction [448] . TLR4 agonist specifically promoted the production of the Th1-inducing IL 12 p70 and IP10, which is also associated to Th1 responses. Instead, TLR2 stimulation failed to induce IL 12 p70 and IP-10 but resulted in the release of the IL 12 inhibitory p40 homodimer, producing conditions that are predicted to favor Th2 development. TLR2 stimulation also resulted in preferential induction of IL 8 and p 19 /IL 23 [449] . Thus TLR primary responses to their agonist may be modified by cross-talk between different TLRs [448] . The receptor superfamily also includes IL 18 R [131] . Ligands and chromosomes [537] for 10 TLRs, such as TLR1 (4p14), TLR2 (4q32), TLR3 (4q35), TLR4 (9q32-33), TLR5 (1q32-33), TLR6 (4p14), TLR7 (Xp22.3), TLR8 (Xp22) TLR9 (3p21.3) and TLR10 (4p14), have been characterized [50, 191, 333, 448] .

TLR10 is notably expressed in lung tissue, where involvement in the innate immune responses of the lung to common respirable exposures such as allergens may be a potential asthma candidate gene [285] , thus suppression of TLR responses may reduce excessive inflammation in chronic diseases [185] . All TLRs with the exception of TLR3 can signal via MyD88, TLRs 2 and 4 utilize MyD88, and TLR3 and 4 can engage TRIF and TRAM (TRIFrelated adaptor molecule) under certain circumstances [188, 658] . TLR4 recognizes LPSs and lipoteichoic acids from Gram-and Gram+ bacteria, respectively, and TLR9 is critical for recognizing bacterial DNAs [345] . A CpG oligonucleotide, a TLR9 agonist, also stimulated TLR9 expression in B cells [50] . TLR4 and TRAF6 [374] were shown to induce the activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway: by this pathway, TLR4 activation NOD2-S can abolish residual NOD2 signaling by the CD-associated R702W variant. However, interfering with the delicate balance of NOD2 signaling in inflammatory bowel disease, e.g., by changing the ratio of NOD2 splice variants, may have detrimental effects on the CD course [475] . Until recently, most TLR/ligand interactions had been shown to favor Th1-like responses rather than promoting the Th2 responses commonly associated with allergic disease. However, this concept was recently challenged in rodent models, in which both TLR ligand concentration and the route of immunization were shown to induce a Th2 immune response [450] . How might this shift be achieved? [537] . Depending on the early environment of the individual, this might lead to Th cells that are dominated by allergyprone Th2 cells, which support the production of antigen-specific B cells. The increase in the Th2 cells comes at the expense of Th1 lymphocytes [450] . The synergistic interactions of TLR ligands and antigen might have relevance to the exacerbation of IgE-mediated allergic diseases by infectious agents [438] . In addition to host defense against pathogens, the TLR-dependent pathways are involved in a variety of immune responses [560] . Therefore, an important challenge for the future will be to develop suitable suppression of TLR responses to reduce excessive inflammation in chronic diseases [187] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 196, "end": 201, "text": "[187]", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}, {"start": 398, "end": 403, "text": "[285]", "ref_id": "BIBREF304"}, {"start": 494, "end": 499, "text": "[185]", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 687, "end": 692, "text": "[188,", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 693, "end": 697, "text": "658]", "ref_id": "BIBREF657"}, {"start": 840, "end": 845, "text": "[345]", "ref_id": "BIBREF345"}, {"start": 930, "end": 934, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 952, "end": 957, "text": "[374]", "ref_id": "BIBREF392"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1338, "text": "[475]", "ref_id": "BIBREF455"}, {"start": 1688, "end": 1693, "text": "[450]", "ref_id": "BIBREF472"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1735, "text": "[537]", "ref_id": "BIBREF516"}, {"start": 1994, "end": 1999, "text": "[450]", "ref_id": "BIBREF472"}, {"start": 2154, "end": 2159, "text": "[438]", "ref_id": "BIBREF460"}, {"start": 2282, "end": 2287, "text": "[560]", "ref_id": "BIBREF559"}, {"start": 2449, "end": 2454, "text": "[187]", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O 2 -Independent Mechanisms"}, {"text": "A prominent role in innate immunity is played by keratinocytes expressing both TLR2 and TLR4 at the mRNA and protein levels; TLR2 and TLR4 are present in the normal human epidermis in vivo and their expression is regulated by microbial components [432] .

However, everything can be modulated by ILs, their number [31] and chronology of intervention. Th1 and Th2 T cells are potentially activated by signals deriving from phagocytes and NK-CMI. Moreover, we speculate that Th2 T cells act only in immune reactions independent of phagocyte cells: several ILs generated by both T cells inhibit macrophage functions potentially provoking severe damage to the host [471] . IL 12 establishes a bridge with acquired immunity and provides defense against infections at different levels: it influences rapid IFN-g production from T and NK cells, modulates virgin T-cell differentiation into Th1 lymphocytes due to their capacity for up-regulating IFN-g titers and reducing IL 4 production from virgin T cells, and is also necessary for the optimal proliferation of IFN-g producing Th1 cells in response to antigens and APCs [181] . Thus, IFN-g and IL 12 form a positive feedback system amplifying IFN-g levels to activate macrophages and IL 12 to promote proliferation and activation of NK and Th1 cells [181] . Recently, the primary function of IL 12 has been shown to up-regulate adhesion molecules, and IL 28 and IL 29 medi-induces the expression of a variety of ILs and CSMs [345] . IFN-g up-regulates TLR4 expression, and was shown to counteract the LPS-induced down-regulation of TLR4 [50] . Recently the TIR domain-containing adaptors have increased in number: they include MyD88, TIRAP (TIR domain-containing adaptor protein), TRIF, and TRAM [491, 560, 658] . These TIR play essential roles in TLR signaling. MyD88 is essential for inflammatory IL production via all TLRs, whereas TRIF is involved in TLR3-and TLR4-mediated MyD88-independent induction of IFN-b [560] . These findings confirmed that TLRs may function as receptors of the innate immune system [345, 560] . Moreover, the activated TLR4 recruits the MYD88/IRAK signaling pathway. Further downstream, IRAK and IRAK-2 interact with the adapter molecule TNRF6 that bridges them to the protein kinases TAK1 (transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase) and NIK [261, 372] . Once activated, the MyD88/IRAK signaling cascade bifurcates and leads to the activation of a TF NF-kB and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which initiate the transcription of proinflammatory IL genes that subsequently drive the transcriptional induction of several IL genes (see above) [374, 563] . However, a dominant-negative version of MyD88 specifically inhibited TLR4-induced NF-kB activation, lending functional credence to the interaction occurring between TLR4 and MyD88 [373, 374] . Genetic, gene transfer, and dominant-negative approaches have involved TLRs 2 and 4 in LPS recognition and signaling [374] . The new IFN, FLN29, is a negative feedback regulator of TLR signaling in innate immunity; FLN29 may thus play an important role in endotoxin tolerance [335] . Two members of the NOD family, NOD1 and NOD2, together with TLRs, have also been shown to be involved in the innate immune response as sensors of specific bacterial components [429] . Genetic variation in the genes encoding the NOD-LRR proteins, and NOD2 in humans and Naip5 (neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein 5) in mice, is associated with inflammatory disease or increased susceptibility to bacterial infections [79] . NALPs [NACHT (neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein)], LRR-and pyrin domain (PYD)-containing proteins 1-14 have been defined in the human genome. NALP1 protein forms a large, signal-induced molecular platform, the inflammasome, resulting in the activation of proinflammatory caspases [582] . Instead, IL 32 synergized with the NOD1-and NOD2-specific muropeptides of peptidoglycans for the release of IL 1 b and IL 6 via a caspase 1-dependent mechanism; the marked expression of IL 32 in colon mucosa suggests a role of IL 32 in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) [379] . NOD2-S is preferentially expressed in the human colon and is up-regulated by the antiinflammatory IL 10 . Overexpression of NOD2-S down-regulates NOD2-induced NF-kB activation and IL 8 release. NOD2-S also interferes with the maturation and secretion of pro-IL 1 b downstream of NOD2 and its adaptor molecule receptor-interacting protein kinase 2. Increased levels of ate antiviral activity in cells in response to viral infection [519] . In addition, activated T cells generate additional ILs with a multitude of functions, including the widening of antimicrobial activities of immune cells, macrophages, neutrophils and NK cells [299] . Most CTLs are CD8 and also a CD4 T cell subset and HLA class I or II restricted. Similarly, T cells can directly kill microorganisms not expressing HLA molecules: this direct antimicrobial activity can also occur when HLA restrictions are absent [299] . CD8 T cells, unlike NK cells, also attack Candida albicans and show a direct antiparasite activity, although several of their activities are played together with NK cells [299] . Loss of direct T-cell activity could contribute to AIDS and other severe PID infections [299] . Mice lacking T-bet fail to control a Th1-dependent infection, yet interesting evidence suggests a pathogenic role of Th1 cells in autoimmunity [556] . Also suggestive is an antibacterial defense achieved via the innate immune system, such as innate opsonins, complement components, and certain antimicrobial peptides, leading to a polyvalent machinery formation presumably yielding a lymphocyte pathway of recognition and activation [194] . For example, opsonins, by binding to microbial cell walls and flagging them for recognition by the complement system and phagocytes, could be effective antibacterial agents [345] . As a corollary, pathogens with components capable of inducing phagocytes to produce IL 12 already in the early events of infection elicit Th1-like responses [106] .

These differences extend to a range of TLR agonists, including bacterial lipopeptides (BLPs), and are due to differences in soluble factors present in blood plasma. The suppressed TLR-induced TNF-a release from monocytes by soluble factors in neonatal blood plasma is likely to alter both innate and adaptive immune responses in neonates profoundly. Thus, neonates are at increased risk of overwhelming infection, yet the mechanisms underlying this susceptibility are incompletely defined [297] . Moreover, exposure to reduced levels of sCD14 in the fetal and neonatal gut is associated with the development of atopy, eczema, or both.

By increasing the dose 100-fold, the inhibition increases up to 95% [437] . Moreover, the addition of an IL 4 binding protein, a sIL 4 R, blocked the IgE enhancement by CD8 + T cells [346] . However, if the peripheral blood of atopic patients contains long-lived B cells with a previous isotype switch to IgE, these antibodies cannot be directly influenced by ILs [125] . \u2211 The intervention of a potential suppressive factor of transcriptional events, inversely regulating IL 4 transcription of a not yet identified protein, determines a high capacity of binding to Th1 T cells at the moment of T-cell activation, coupled with a virtual absence of IL 4 after 16-24 h; instead, the high binding capacity of Th2 T cells is expressed with not yet stimulated cells. However, it is decreased when Th2 are activated. Such events are correlated with high inductive signals for IL 4 after the same time span [206] . \u2211 Increasingly, soluble sIL 4 R may be able to block in vitro IL 4 -mediated B cell activation, proliferation and differentiation in human PBMCs and therefore both IL 4 -dependent IgE synthesis and CD23 induction on B cells. The clinical basis of using sIL 4 R is the location in the blood, rendering sIL 4 R a potentially stimulating candidate. Moreover, IL 4 -deficient mice obtained via gene targeting do not display immune abnormalities, except for their inability to produce IgE [172] . A contrary effect has been assessed [492] . \u2211 An interesting subject is the demonstration that anti-CD23 antibodies block IgE synthesis in an isotype-restricted fashion, that is, inhibiting B lymphocyte differentiation in IgE-producing cells under the IL 4 influx [16] . \u2211 STAT6 is phosphorylated by IL 4 , so any agents that block STAT6 function may be useful for treating atopic disease [562] . \u2211 Even more interesting is the likelihood of inducing a peptide-mediated IL 4 anergy. Using a clone of T cells incubated in a culture medium or with a specific peptide in either an immunogenic or nonimmunogenic dose, and stimulating again with a nonimmunogenic specific peptide and the related APCs, it was elucidated that T cells becoming unresponsive completely lose the ability of secreting IL 4 , but fully maintain the ability of producing IFN-g [138] . \u2211 In the animal model, the concerted action of IL 12 together with IL 18 and anti-CD40 inhibits IL 4 and IgE synthesis by induction of IFN-g production from activated B cells, however, without inhibiting B cell proliferative response [669] . \u2211 A significant series of experiments in the animal model with synthetic peptides assure relevant implications for SIT. Administering a peptide along with an adjuvant in APCs induces T-cell proliferation and development of immunity. If a peptide able to activate T cells is administered, but disregarding the adjuvant (or CD28/CD80 interaction is missing), the 2nd signal is abrogated. T-cell clonal anergy ensues as does the eventual apoptosis that drives to tolerance, as discussed in \"Apoptosis\" [138] (Fig. 1.22c) . A similar option could prove successful in atopic patients [276] . \u2211 Ongoing studies on single amino acid substitutions have paved the way to assemble a peptide with a T epitope possibly able to interrupt T/B interactions and the consequent isotype switch to IgE, exciting IFN-g production or inhibiting CD4 proliferation. However, skin prick tests (SPTs) with a modified allergen failed to drive immediate reactions [223] . \u2211 A potentially promising candidate is clonal deletion [138] , a process of negative selection following, for transcription [394] : since TFs are alike for diverse ILs, it is probable that further studies will report the inhibition of additional ILs. \u2211 As outlined in Chap. 22, atopic children, some with HIgES, have been successfully cured with intravenous IgGs (IVIgs), suggesting that IVIgs inhibited IgE production of PBMCs (T cells) cultured in vitro and stimulated by IL 4 , without influencing IgA and IgM levels, and also of normal B cells stimulated by IL 4 + anti-CD40. \u2211 The significance of CSMs results from their ability to block antibody production following in vivo administration of CD152-Ig and anti-CD86 [115] . CD152-Ig specifically abates IL 4 production and if administered early after the start of an infection blocks its progression [242, 685] . \u2211 A new strategy to inhibit or, depending on the case, to cause apoptosis (Tables 1.68, 1.69) [576] acts on NF-kB as well as TNF-a [599] , or modulates bcl-2/ced-9, or alternatively ICE/ced-3 [267, 661] , or ced-4: if a mammal homolog is identified the issue could encompass all changes deriving from apoptosis dysregulation. \u2211 A recent approach could be aimed at eliminating eosinophil influx into airways, which has been achieved treating animals with anti-MIP-1a, anti-RANTES and anti-MCP-3. So the rationale to focus CCR3 antagonists is available, a potential mediator of CCL chemokine effects on eosinophils [9] . \u2211 Another strategy is the blockade of chemokine receptors: CCR3, CCR4 and CCR8 are the most obvious targets for therapeutic investigation. \u2211 Attention is also turning to small molecular weight (SMW). SMW IL 4 inhibition seems to decrease IgE synthesis, lung eosinophilia and mucous production and could be used to treat asthma and other atopic disorders. \u2211 The development of new therapies for atopic allergy is now focusing on local Th1-driving IL 12 -promoting substances to target both the development of new Th2 cells and the persistent population of established allergen-specific Th2 cells to revert established effector example, a self-HLA-antigen complex interaction, an event leading to apoptosis and thereby a powerful mechanism aimed at inducing tolerance to self-antigens ( Fig. 1.22) . \u2211 The armamentarium of T epitopes has intriguing repercussions for SIT, based on the switching of immune responses from Th2 to Th0 T cells. A prominent feature, however, is a feasible switch to Th1 and DTH (Chap. 13). \u2211 Administration of peptides corresponding to T epitopes (at least 10-12 amino acids) elicits a T cell tolerance to a complete antigen in humans [404] , hence immunodominant T cell epitopes of an allergen actually also function as high inducers of T-cell nonresponsiveness [619] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 429, "end": 434, "text": "[437]", "ref_id": "BIBREF436"}, {"start": 544, "end": 549, "text": "[346]", "ref_id": "BIBREF346"}, {"start": 725, "end": 730, "text": "[125]", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1266, "text": "[206]", "ref_id": "BIBREF226"}, {"start": 1753, "end": 1758, "text": "[172]", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}, {"start": 1797, "end": 1802, "text": "[492]", "ref_id": "BIBREF491"}, {"start": 2025, "end": 2029, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2150, "end": 2155, "text": "[562]", "ref_id": "BIBREF561"}, {"start": 2609, "end": 2614, "text": "[138]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2716, "end": 2717, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2851, "end": 2856, "text": "[669]", "ref_id": "BIBREF668"}, {"start": 3358, "end": 3363, "text": "[138]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3438, "end": 3443, "text": "[276]", "ref_id": "BIBREF276"}, {"start": 3796, "end": 3801, "text": "[223]", "ref_id": "BIBREF204"}, {"start": 3859, "end": 3864, "text": "[138]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3928, "end": 3933, "text": "[394]", "ref_id": "BIBREF375"}, {"start": 4526, "end": 4531, "text": "[115]", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 4660, "end": 4665, "text": "[242,", "ref_id": "BIBREF223"}, {"start": 4666, "end": 4670, "text": "685]", "ref_id": "BIBREF673"}, {"start": 4767, "end": 4772, "text": "[576]", "ref_id": "BIBREF575"}, {"start": 4804, "end": 4809, "text": "[599]", "ref_id": "BIBREF617"}, {"start": 4865, "end": 4870, "text": "[267,", "ref_id": "BIBREF267"}, {"start": 4871, "end": 4875, "text": "661]", "ref_id": "BIBREF660"}, {"start": 5286, "end": 5289, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 6453, "end": 6458, "text": "[404]", "ref_id": "BIBREF404"}, {"start": 6581, "end": 6586, "text": "[619]", "ref_id": "BIBREF599"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3364, "end": 3376, "text": "(Fig. 1.22c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}, {"start": 6077, "end": 6087, "text": "Fig. 1.22)", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Therapeutic Perspectives"}, {"text": "What was summarized above on sCD40 makes it feasible to consider an isotype switching inhibition after the second signal expressed by ILs, to stop T-B interactions via CD40 and CD154 thus far achievable in vitro [132] .

Actually only major and minor allergens are taken into account. However, not all patients recognize all major allergens and some patients only recognize allergens that are not recognized by the majority of allergic patient sera (Chap. 13).

Table 1 .76 [601] summarizes the T epitopes of many allergens and Table 1 .77 [601] the association of single allergens with HLA molecules and IgE responses, with several factors of relative risk. We show the foods derived from genetically modified organisms (GMO) or crop plants in Tables 1.78 and 1. 79 [110, 348] . In GMOs, insect protection is achieved by means of plants producing insecticide proteins not toxic for human beings, while herbicide tolerance is mediated by plants provided with enzymes disarming herbicides. A prerequisite is that such products be subjected to extensive assessments to ensure food safety and digestibility [348] : however, it is feasible that genes of a given plant are transferred to a nearby one and that other genes damage the so-called useful insects, also including fish deriving from monosexualization or maternal DNA doubling. Therefore, verification of potential allergenicity of transgenic food modified with genetic engineering now appears to be necessary, such as in the case of soy (Fig. 1.81 ) [42] .
