            "text": "have been familiar in human societies since the beginning of recorded history. Alcohol is no longer viewed as a threat to all people, but rather to a small subclass of ''alcoholics'' or, in today's technical terms, people who are ''alcohol-dependent''. Ethanol is primarily metabolized in the liver by the multiple isoenzymes of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and microsomal ethanoloxidizing system (MEOS) and by other ethanolmetabolizing enzymes such as catalase. About 90% to 95% of ethanol is eliminated by oxidation. The rest is excreted by the kidneys, the lungs and the skin. Oxidative stress is a well recognized key step in the pathogenesis of ethanol-associated liver injury. Oxidative stress and associated cellular injury promote inflammation. TNF\u03b1 and its inducible cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, are associated with alcoholic fibrosis.TGF-\u03b2 1, one of the most powerful profibrogenic mediators, plays a major role in the development of liver cirrhosis and regulates ECM gene expression and matrix degradation. It is believed to be a potent activator of hepatic stellate cells resulting in ECM synthesis and correlates well with the presence of fibrosis in patients with ALD. Among a variety of blood tests used to aid the diagnosis of alcohol consumption and related disorders, laboratory tests are particularly useful in settings where cooperativeness is suspected or when a history is not available. Antioxidants could have beneficial effects in reducing the incidence of ethanol-induced changes in lipid, proteins and nucleic acids. Preventive measures were more effective than curative treatment. Glutathione replacement would seem to be an obviouschoice in view of the extensive evidence implicating glutathionedepletion in the pathophysiology of alcohol-inducedliver dysfunction. Indeed, cytokinedirected therapy has been shown to prevent liver injury in a rat model of ALD, autologous bone marrow cell infusion (ABMI) therapy is a candidatemodality in the treatment of decompensated liver cirrhosis. However, abstinence is the foundation of therapy for an alcohol problem.",

We next examined the signaling pathways involved in the activation of autophagy and results showed that Baicalein induced autophagy in OA chondrocytes through activation of mTOR signaling via AMPK/TSC2/mTOR/P70S6K axis. Additionally, Baicalein treated OA chondrocytesalso showed enhanced activity of Nrf2/ARE as revealed by Nrf2/AREluciferase reporter assay.In silico molecular docking studies indicated that Baicaleinactivates Nrf2 by disrupting the Keap-1/Nrf-2 interaction by blocking the Nrf-2binding site in the Keap-1 protein.Additionally, OA chondrocytes treated with Baicalein, and in a dose dependent manner,showed enhanced expression, both at mRNA and protein levels, of Nrf2 target genes HO-1, NQO1, and SOD2. We next determined the molecular events involved in Baicalein mediated activation of Nrf2 and it was found that treatmentof OA chondrocytes with Baicalein activated MEK1/2-ERK1/2-ELK-1 signaling in a time dependent manner. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation or inhibition of autophagy using small molecules or siRNA mediated depletion of target genes expression abolished the protective effects of Baicalein in OA chondrocytes under pathological conditions. CONCLUSION:The present study indicates that Baicaleinexert the anti-inflammatory effect, at least in part, by activating Nrf2/autophagy axis through activation of MEK1/2-ERK1/2-ELK1 and AMPK/TSC2/ mTOR/P70S6 Kpath-waysin human OA chondrocytes under pathological conditions.This property indicates that Baicaleincould be developed as an effective adjunct therapyfor the suppression of OA pathogenesis.",

Following an expedition that measured blood gases near the summit of Mt. Everest at 8400m, the calculation of acid-base balance using the sea level Van Slyke equation has misled scientists.Changes in arterial blood gases (O2 and CO2) and in acidity or alkalinity (changes in H+ ion concentration) are discussed in terms of base excess (BE) and base deficit (BD). The mathematical relations between them are expressed by the well-known Van Slyke equation. In his quest for a precise measurement of the factor causing variation, Siggaard-Andersen changed these terms to \"titratable hydrogen ion in extracellular fluid\" (with an inverse sign). We later renamed it as \"titratable hydrogen ion difference [from the normal]\" (THID). The normal for any altitude is zero. That is the perfect homeostatic environment for cells from the acid-base point of view. As the altitude increases, the barometric pressure decreases exponentially and so do the arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) andthe arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2). Hence the acid-base values also change accordingly, inducing changes in the mountaineer's blood chemistry (CO2, bicarbonates, pH). Likewise with time at high altitude, hemoglobin increases as an adaptive process and acts as an additional buffer. Consequently, under hypoxic conditions at the very high (extreme) altitudes of Mt Everest (PaO2: 28 mmHg), using the Van Slyke equation for sea level conditions without corrections is invalid and, hence, inappropriate.TheCauldwell expedition that sampled blood gases at 8400m, calculated a BD of -6.9 mM.We have previously created the correction factors for the Van Slyke equation for different altitudes. Upon applying them at the summit of Mt. Everest, we found that the true THID of the four subjects was 0.7 mM. One can appreciate that the optimal acid-base balance (close to zero) is fundamental for the conquest of such extreme altitude. All cells and biochemical reactions in the organism, require an optimal pH and acid-base balance for optimal function, transcendental for survival. The remarkable adaptation to chronic hypoxia leads unequivocally to survival even at the extreme hypoxic levels of the summit of Mt. Everest, supporting the concept that man can adapt to life even on the summit of Mt. Everest as proposed by the late Prof. Dr. GustavoZubieta-Castillo (Sr), over 14 years ago.",

The metabolic syndrome includes central obesity, insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure, impaired glucose tolerance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and dyslipidaemia; these signs are due to chronic low-grade inflammation combined with oxidative stress. We have shown that a diet high in fructose and saturated/trans fats induces these cardiovascular, liver and metabolic signs in rats. We have shown that components of foods can reverse all these symptoms in diet-induced obese, hypertensive and insulin-resistant rats. In particular, tocotrienols from palm oil, dietary fibre from tropical seaweeds, anthocyanins from tropic Australian native fruits such as Davidson's plums, and polyphenols from Garcinia fruits such as achacha lowered blood pressure, prevented inflammatory cell infiltration into the heart, liver and fat pads, improved plasma lipid profiles and decreased plasma inflammatory biomarkers. All these interventions, especially tropical fruits and seaweeds, could be produced commercially, sustainably and costeffectively in many tropical countries, with the aim of reducing the incidence of metabolic syndrome, and decreasing the risk of costly cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.",

            "text": "Institute for Cardiovascular Research, VUM, University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands P atients with total coronary artery occlusions are known to have more developed collateral circulation compared to patients with stenosis and consequently, we hypothesised, that they may represent the ideal human model to examine endogenous, local growth factor production in vivo.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a heparin-binding homo-dimeric peptide mitogen with target cell specificity to vascular endothelial cells and it promotes growth of blood vessels i.e. angiogenesis in vivo. Using molecular cloning, we have shown earlier that VEGF exists at least as four different species of 121, 165, 189, and 206 amino acids due to alternative splicing of mRNA. We have elucidated the expression and regulation of VEGF in the heart of various species. Using human specific oligonucleotide primers in RT-PCR, we have cloned and characterized porcine heart derived cDNA molecules encoding VEGF121 as well as VEGF165. We have examined the expression pattern and cellular distribution of VEGF in the porcine heart during ischemic ventricular dysfunction achieved by two cycles of short coronary occlusions and followed by reperfusion. Myocardial expression of VEGF mRNAs (1.7 and 3.9 kb) was increased by 2 fold in the reperfused myocardium. Immunoreactive VEGF was localized mainly in cytoplasm of myocytes in a diffused pattern as well as in smooth muscle layers of the coronary blood vessels. We have shown that the expression of VEGF (both at mRNA and protein level) is up-regulated by adenosine in microvascular endothelial cells in vitro and that tumor necrosis factor-\u03b2 (TNF-\u03b2), a potent cytokine mainly secreted by macrophages in the ischemic myocardium is involved in upregulating the VEGF expression in cultured cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, endogenous VEGF and bFGF concentrations were prospectively examined in the coronary circulation and periphery of 14 male patients (seven with mean diameter stenosis 83% , mean age 63, and a further seven with total coronary artery occlusion, mean age 64 undergoing elective left coronary system intervention.VEGF concentrations were significantly higher in the coronary sinus samples of patients with occlusions compared to those with stenoses (400.2 (176.7) v103.3 (19.8) pg/ml, p = 0.026). In contrast, no significant differences between local and systemic concentrations of bFGF for either the whole cohort of patients or those with occlusions were observed. Taking together, our results clearly show that the cardiac myocytes are the major source of VEGF in the heart, of which the expression can be regulated by a number of factors. Increased local VEGF but not bFGF production in the diseased coronary circulation in patients with total coronary occlusions suggest a potential paracrine role for this growth factor in pathophysiologic collateral formation and supports its use as a therapeutic tool for angiogenesis, particularly in patients with inoperable coronary heart disease. Since then the objective is to suggest the specific cardiac markers, its role, its appropriate use to establish the diagnosis in different clinical scenario. The role of cardiac troponins as diagnostic biomarkers of myocardial injury in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is well established. More than a decade journey from 1stgeneration assays, now 5th-generation high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays as changed the diagnostic capability. During acute ischemia (STEMI or NONSTEMI) Troponin is released from the cytosolic pool of the myocytes. Its subsequent release is prolonged with degradation of actin and myosin filaments. Isoforms of the protein, T and I, are specific to myocardium.The CK-MB isoform ofcreatine kinase is expressed in heart muscle. It resides in the cytosol and facilitates movement of high energy phosphates into and out of mitochondria.",

Due to ethical constraints, elaborate experimental protocols and inter species differences associated with animal-based DNT models, the need for their appropriate substitute became necessary. Hence, we utilize the pluripotency potential of human umbilical cord blood stem cells (hCBSCs) to convert them into neural subtypes and subsequently as the tool to evaluate the DNT. Our studies provide deeper insights into the complex processes involved in neuronal development, injury and repair and demonstrate the mapping of cellular and sub-cellular events of differentiation of hCBSCs into morphological and functional neuronal cells. We discovered that how the master regulator signalling molecules/ cascades are critical to convert hCBSCs into functional neurons and what exactly happens when things go wrong during the intricate process of neuronal development. We also uncovered novel links between the xenobiotic metabolizing capabilities and their regulators in hCBSCs derived neuronal cells all through the differentiation. We further attempted to create functional three-dimensional (3D) neuronal niche organoid using cells combined with scaffolds that facilitate cell growth, organization and differentiation. The results are promising for the development of 3D network niche of proliferating and non-proliferating stem cells, progenitor cells, differentiating neuronal and fully differentiated cells in hydrogel scaffolds initiated by hanging drop cultures. The hydrogel scaffolds were found to be capable of affirming the culture and axonal outgrowth and migration of multilayered cells. The ultrastructural studies confirm the neurite outgrowth and synaptic conjunctions in 3D cultures. The data generated thus far not only proposes a much sought after framework for screening the newly developed drug candidate molecules for their safety assessment for developmental neurotoxicity, but as well to evaluate the neuroprotective potential in developing brain in a high throughput fashion.",

T he exciting world of research with RNAs, has to its credit some breakthrough findings that havesignificantly affected multiple strategies of disease research and treatments. circRNAs are a class of noncoding RNAs, which are produced by scrambling of exons at the time of splicing. These molecules are known to act as miRNA sponges thereby modulating the repression function carried out by miRNAs; thus a single molecule affects hundreds of its target genes. Considering the multi-factorial nature of Parkinson's disease, we hypothesize presence of a commoncircRNA/microRNA trigger for the multiple manifestations of the ailment. We endeavored to study these interesting molecules employing transgenic C. elegans strain expressing 'human' alpha-synucleinalong-with YFP reporter gene. Using the approach of RNAseR-exonuclease treatment of total RNA, followed by amplification using divergent primers, we validated the presence of two very well expressing circRNAs in C. elegans. We further went on to validate the sequence of identified circRNA4 and carried out functional genomics studies with its synthesizing gene zip-2. Employing RNAi of zip-2 we studied the associated endpoints of alpha-synuclein aggregation in transgenic C. elegans model followed by whole transcriptome analysis employing NextGen sequencing on IlluminaNextSeq 500 platform, which revealed a number of interesting targets that are affected vis-\u00e0-vis circRNA4 down-regulation. We further carried out global microRNA profiling of all known and novel microRNA molecules of C. elegans, using NextGen sequencing. Highly conserved microRNA molecule, let-7, known to regulate important functions of development and viability, was studied via creation of let-7 loss-offunction modeltowards studying the downstream effects on known associated molecules. Employing Timmons and Fire feeding vector L4440, we cloned let-7miRNA and quantifiedlet-7 levels. We further went on to study the whole transcriptome profile of PD model of C. elegans under let-7 silenced condition. Our studies identify circzip-2 as an interesting target and reveal novel set of genes that are affected under let-7 silenced condition in the PD model.",

During carcinogenesis, global hypoacetylation of histone H4 is evident and interestingly, loss of acetylation of histone H4 andhypoacetylation of histone H3has emerged as a hallmark of malignant transformations. Increasing acetylation level of histones by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition promotes cell death, differentiation and growth arrest of cancer cells. In cancer cells, an imbalance exists between histone acetylase(HAT) and HDACactivities and current research focuses actively on seeking competitive HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) for chemotherapeutic intervention.During the last decade, four HDAC inhibitors have been approved by FDA as drugs against various cancers. However, in spite of clinical advantages like high specificity towards cancer cells and less drug resistance, the toxicity associated with HDACi is mainly due to their pan-HDAC inhibition activity and may be addressed by designing the class and isoform specific inhibitors. We rationally designed and synthesized a library of novel HDACi molecules and discovered one potential molecule targeting Class I HDAC's and evaluated its mechanism of action on chromatin state at the specific histone residues with characteristic modifications during leukemogenesis. From findings ofinvitro studies, we analysed the effect of this novel inhibitor on different in vivomurine models of leukemiaandour findings indicate that,this class I specific inhibitor have significant potency in checking leukemia.",

There is diurnal variability of either late evening/ overnight or early morning symptoms which significantly compromises nocturnal sleep, daytime productivity, and overall quality of life, and thus knowledge of variable clinical presentation is of great relevance to patient management. Lung function of asthmatic patients frequently worsens between midnight and early morning. Thus peak flow meter should be used as an objective tool in determining an individual patient's day to night changes in lung function. As we continue to learn more about circadian changes, better approaches to treating the disease with the same medications will emerge. T emporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a chronic neurological disorder constituting about 60% of adult epilepsies and most often refractory to medication. Spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) are the hallmark of TLE and are often associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments. The mechanisms of generation of SRS, epileptogenesis and associated cognitive deficits are yet to be understood. Accordingly, we have used an animal model of TLE to assess the seizure characteristics, neurodegeneration, spatial learning, memory and depressive-like behaviour. We have also evaluated the effect of levetiracetam (LEV) treatment, exposure to enriched environment (EE) and the combination of EE and LEV for 14 days on TLE-induced deficits. Epileptic rats were video-monitored A ccelerated glycolysis ensures ATP levels meet the demands of highly proliferating cancer cells. Cancer cells significantly differ from the normal cells in producing as much as 50% of the cellular ATP by anaerobic glycolysis. This differential metabolic profile is recently perceived as a target of novel therapeutic strategies. However, current therapeutic agents targeting glycolytic enzymes lack specificity, have off target effects and limited clinical potential. The glycolytic inhibitor, 2-Deoxy Glucose (2-DG) has been used as a therapeutic agent targeting hexokinase2 (HK2) enzyme in cancer. However, 2-DG treatment is known to induce prosurvival Akt /HIF1\u03b1 signaling. Enhanced therapeutic efficacy has been observed with the combination of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt inhibitors in 2-DGbased chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Cardiac glycosides induce potent anticancer activities by modulation of Src kinase signaling, induction of TRAIL, TNF \u03b1, NF\u03b1B induced cell death, Topoisomerase II and HIF1\u03b1 inhibition. Therefore, we studied the effects of a cardiac glycoside Digitoxigenin (DGX) in an effort to counter 2-DG induced pro-survival HIF1\u03b1 signaling in Glioblastoma cells. Digitoxigenin enhanced cytotoxicity of 2-DG in a dose dependent manner showing synergistic effects. Combined treatment with subtoxic doses of 2-DG (1mM) and DGX (0.5\u03bcM) significantly reduced colony formation, invasion and migration in U87MG and LN229 glioblastoma cells. Protein profiling studies showed significant reduction of 2-DG induced HIF1\u03b1, HK2 and other pro-survival protein expression. Thus, these results collectively suggest that the combined treatment of 2-DG and DGX inhibits proliferation, invasion and migration by targeting pro-survival HIF1? signaling in glioblastoma cells. In conclusion, this study revealed that in glioblastoma cells digitoxigenin augments 2-DG induced toxicity by targeting HIF1\u03b1.",

For this we measured plasma levels of CoQ10 in patients of FMS and in healthy control subjects (n=20), suggesting the presence of decreased levels of antioxidant in this disease. However, plasma level of CoQ10 was significantly decreased in FMS relative to healthy controls, suggesting that FMS is associated with coenzyme Q10 deficiency and increased oxidative stress. Moreover, plasma level of oxidative stress parameters was significantly higher in FMS patients than in controls, suggesting increased tissue oxidative damage in FMS. Moreover, to compensate for the loss of quality of life (QOL),next, we examined the effect of ubiquinol-10 supplementation (200 mg/day for 30days) in FMS patients. This resulted in an increase in coenzyme Q10 levels and a decrease in oxidative stress parameters.

Human antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), the first line of defense against invading microbes, acting either by direct antimicrobial activity or by stimulating the immune system, can be promising targets against TB. In the present work, the potentially active human AMPs and their biologically active motifs were screened out and identified by in silico approaches. On the basis of in silico analysis, HBD-1, having highest antimicrobial score by using AntiBp2, CAMP and AMPA web servers, was selected for further analysis. Scanning of HBD-1 by in silico tools led to identification of Pep B (ACPIFTKIQGTCYRG) as active motif having antimicrobial and immunomodulatory potential respectively. Another defensin, HNP-1, which has already been reported as a potential antimycobacterial agent from our lab was also screened for its antimicrobial motif that resulted into identification of a sequence Pep H (RRYGTCIYQGRLWAF). Activity of HBD-1,Pep-B and Pep-H was determined against actively growing M. tb in vitro, inside monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) and dormant bacilli in in vitro potassium deficiency and human PBMC granuloma models using colony forming unit enumeration. HBD-1 ,Pep B and Pep H not only displayed bactericidal activity against in vitro growing M. tb but also inhibited intracellular mycobacterial growth at concentrations lower than in vitro MICs asindicated by significant (p<0.001) reduction (more than 1 log) in bacillary load in infected MDMs as compared to control infected cells. Also combinations of (HNP-1 + HBD-1) and (Pep H + Pep B) showed significant (p<0.001) activity in restricting the mycobacterial growth in MDMs at 1/4th and 1/8th of their individual effective concentrations. Further, antimicrobial activity of AMPs and their motifs against intracellular bacilli was supported by significant increase (p<0.001) in IFN ? and NO release by infected MDMs. Although at higher concentrations, HBD-1, Pep-B, HNP-1 and Pep H led to decrease in dormant mycobacterial load both in vitro as well as inside human granuloma model.The antimycobacterial activity of both AMPs and their motifs was also significantly higher (p<0.01; p<0.001) than rifampicin and isoniazid against latent TB models.

Medical errors have gained significance due to their increased prevalence which is detrimental to the safety of patients.Failure to inform the patient of adverse events caused by a medical error compromises the autonomy of the patient. It also jeopardizes the opportunity to improve the quality in health care. Disclosure of an adverse event is an important element in managing the consequences of a medical error. Physicians should seek to disclose medical errors to patients and their families on both ethical and pragmatic grounds. By following an open disclosure policy, patient's autonomy can be preserved and malpractice claims can be reduced effectively. The complexities of medical error disclosure to patients present ideal opportunities for medical educators to probe how learners are balancing the ethical complexities involved in error disclosure. The designing of an error disclosure policy requires integration of various aspects including bioethics, physician-patient communication, quality of care, and team-based care delivery. There are many policies and procedures proposed by the national and international regulators to have consistent and standard medical error disclosure and reporting policies. The majority of provinces in Canada have adopted some form of a disclosure policy while others are in the process of developing such policies. These Canadian provincial initiatives, though similar in content, remain isolated because of their non-mandatory nature and absence of federal or provincial laws on disclosure. We suggest a uniform policy centered on addressing errors in a nonpunitive manner and respecting the patient's right to an honest disclosure should be a standard of care.",

Besides this, adults also face the occupational exposure to lead which also accounts to the 'take home lead' with their clothes.It was documented that in case of adults, 20-70% of the ingested lead enters the blood while almost 100% of the inhaled lead finds its way into the bloodstream.Because it is nonbiodegradable and has a slow rate of elimination, it tends to accumulate in body and this chronic or acute accumulation of even small quantities of lead leads to the condition termed as lead poisoning (plumbism).

Inorganic lead is defined as lead oxides, metallic lead, and lead salts.The organic lead compounds include the tetra-alkyl lead compounds mainly tetraethyl lead and tetramethyl lead which have been incorporated into gasoline as anti-knock additives.Based on the BLL, the different effects of lead on individuals have been observed. Despite the interesting fact that no normal physiological role for lead could be found, lead toxicology causes numerous serious pathophysiological manifestations in the patients.Oxidative stress understandably the major mechanism of lead poisoning is caused when generation of free radicals is more than ability of the system to readily detoxify the body from them, as their accumulation results in cellular damage.Lead exposure leads to hematological changes that result due to the poisoning of three enzymes of heme biosynthesis pathway: ?-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase(ALAD), ferrochelatase, and ?aminolevulinic acid synthetase. Also, RBCs become more fragile as their membrane is damaged because lead disrupts the maintenance of the cell membrane.Most sensitive organ to lead exposure is brain. Neurons may be directly or indirectly harmed byaccumulation of heme precursors, such as ALA, due to influence of lead on ALAD. Lead also hinders the development of neurotransmitters and organisation of ion channels.Bones are the primary site for the deposition of lead in our body. Lead is thought to be deposited in two segments in the bones. Cortex, the site for deposition of the nonexchangeable pool is present deep in the bone and the exchangeable pool is found at the bone surface. Lead from exchangeable pool is actively re-absorbed and may get easy access to plasma. After this mobilization, lead from the non-exchangeable pool is shifted to the surface.In women, lead toxicity leads to miscarriage, pregnancy hypertension, infertility, premature membrane rupture, premature delivery and pre-eclampsia. Increased BLL are associated with delayed puberty in girls.Lead interaction with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) indicated that lead acetate changed the secondary structure of HCG by loosening and destruction of the HCG skeleton and by increasing the hydrophobicity around Tyr residues, which results in decreased bioactivities of HCG, suggesting a direct interactions of lead with sex hormones and suggesting a possible mechanism of lead induced reproductive toxicity at molecular level. Metabolic changes during pregnancy mobilise the lead from bones into the blood, thus increasing the toxic effects of lead.Lead toxicity leads to histopathological changes in the renal proximal tubular epithelium and results in interstitial nephritis, which is usually related to high blood pressure.Lead is projected to alter the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis.In order to justify the carcinogen status of organic lead compounds, it must be noted that these compounds are metabolized in the body into a number of metabolites including inorganic lead (Group 2A carcinogen) prior to excretion in the urine.ALAD gene polymorphismsare known to influence the BLL and thus directly affect the susceptibility of individualstowards lead poisoning. Lead stronglyinhibits ALAD enzyme stoichiometrically and at the molecular level, displacing a zinc ion at the metal binding siteproduces inhibition through a change in the enzyme's quaternarystructure.",

We characterized plasma samples of antiretroviral na\u00efve HIV-1 infected donors for the presence of bnAbs. Pooled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from select donors whose plasma antibodies exhibited cross neutralizing activity were used to construct a phage recombinant single chain variable fragment (scFv) library with high diversity. The library was panned and screened by phage ELISA usingtrimeric recombinant proteins to identify viral envelope specific clones. Three scFvmonoclonals D11,C11 and 1F6 selected from the library cross neutralized subtypes A, B and C viruses at concentrationsranging from 0.09 \u03b1g/mL to 100 \u03b1g/mL.

We have found that inhibition of Fatty acid Synthase (FAS), which plays an important role in de novo fatty acid synthesis, was protective as it reversed pulmonary vascular remodelling and reduced right ventricle pressure associated with pulmonary hypertension. Further, there was increased FAS expression and activity and increased level of palmitate, product of FAS catalyzed reaction, in hypoxic cardiomyocytes and RV of Monocrotaline treated pulmonary hypertensive rats. In our study, we observed the elevated level of cellular ROS and oxidative stress markers, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-\u03b1, and decreased anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, along withincreased expression of p65 subunit of NF\u03b1B in hypoxic cardiomyocytes and RV of Monocrotaline-treated rats. FAS inhibition either by siRNA or C75 (2 mg/kg weekly, i.p.), a pharmacological FAS inhibitor, decreased FAS activity and expression, oxidative stress and inflammation. In our study, we found the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced levels of NAD and ATP in hypoxic cardiomyocytes and RV of MCT-treated rats. Inhibition of FAS attenuated the mitochondrial dysfunction as evident by restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased ATP and NAD level in hypoxic cardiomyocytes and RV of MCT-treated rats. We also found that markers (LC3BII and p62) of autophagy, which plays a role in hypertrophic remodelling of ventricles, were also reversed by FAS inhibition. In conclusion, this study shows that de novo fatty acid synthesis gets modulated in pulmonary hypertension and inhibition of FAS is protective in pulmonary hypertension. C olon cancer is the third most common cause of death in the worldwide. Therefore, new preventive strategies are warranted for preventing colon cancer. Nexrutine (NX), an herbal extract from Phellodendron amurense, has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-cancer activity for various tissuespecific cancers, but its chemopreventive efficacy has not been evaluated for colon cancer. Here, we explored the mechanism of chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic efficacy of NX against colon cancer. It was observed that dietary exposure of NX significantly reduced the number of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) (*p<0.005) in rats. In addition, significant inhibition of AOM-induced cell proliferation and reduced expression in inflammatory markers COX-2, iNOS as well as proliferative markers PCNA and cyclin D1 were also seen. Along with these, NX exposure significantly enhanced the apoptosis in the colon of AOM treated rats. Furthermore, in vitro studies, NX (2.5, 5, 10\u03bcg/ml, 48h) decreased the cell survival and colony formation while induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in colon adenocarcinoma cells COLO205 and HCT-15. However, NX had the minimal cytotoxic effect on IEC-6 normal rat intestinal cells, suggesting its high therapeutic index. NX treatment also modulates the level of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins along with cytochrome c release, enhanced cleavage of poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase as well as the catalytic activity of caspases 3 and 9 in both COLO205 and HCT-15 cells. Based on these in vivo and in vitro findings, we suggest that NX could be a useful candidate agent for colon cancer chemoprevention and treatment. M etabolic disorders are essentially single gene disorders. In such disorders, there is a defect in the normal metabolic process in the body, in most occasions arising from a defective enzyme, encoded by a mutated gene. Most such disorders are inherited as autosomal recessive manner, where both the copies of a gene (alleles) get mutated, producing a very low level of enzyme, resulting in manifestation of the disease. Some of these are X-linked disorders where mainly males manifest the disease.",

Exome sequencing, based on NGS technique is a very useful technique and widely used these days. Through exome sequencing, we tend to see all the coding regions (exons) of the known genes of the genome, thereby reducing the cost and time of analysis. NGS is a very powerful technique; but it is important to note that there are limitations as well. NGS cannot detect large deletions and duplications and various complex rearrangements.

The anticancer efficacy of these promising compoundsare due to modulation of the cell viability, induction of intrinsic and extrinsic ROS production, nuclear fragmentation/ condensation, depolarisation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cell cycle check-points, caspases induction and expression of various oncogenic genes.These findings provide a mechanistic role and mode of action of these potent compounds on proliferation and apoptosis of various cancer cells. Understanding the effects of various nutraceuticals on cancer cells may enhance their usagesin the prevention and treatment of various cancers without adverse effect.Further studies are needed to validate cancer preventive and curative efficacy of potent nutraceuticals at clinical level. P roprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) is a serine protease of the proprotien convertase (PC) family that has profound effects on plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, the major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD), through its ability to mediate LDL receptor (LDL-R) protein degradation and reduced recycling to the surface of hepatocytes. Thus, the current study was premeditated not only to evaluate the role of lycopene in targeting the inhibition of PCSK-9 via modulation of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis in HFD rats but also to examine a correlation between HFD induced inflammatory cascades and subsequent regulation of PCSK-9 expression. Besides the effect of lycopene on hepatic PCSK-9 gene expression, PPI studies for PCSK-9-Lycopene complex and EGF-A of LDL-R were also performed via molecular informatics approach to assess the dual mode of action of lycopene in LDL-R recycling and increased removal of circulatory LDL-C.We for the first time deciphered that lycopene treatment significantly down-regulates the expression of hepatic PCSK-9 and HMGR, whereas, hepatic LDL-R expression was significantly up-regulated. Furthermore, lycopene ameliorated inflammation stimulated expression of PCSK-9 via suppressing the expression of inflammatory markers. The results from our molecular informatics studies confirmed that lycopene, while occupying the active site of PCSK-9 crystal structure, reduces the affinity of PCSK-9 to complex with EGF-A of LDL-R, whereas, atorvastatin makes PCSK-9-EGF-A complex formation more feasible than both of PCSK-9-EGF-A alone and Lycopene-PCSK-9-EGF-A complex. Based on above results, it can be concluded that lycopene exhibits potent hypolipidemic activities via molecular mechanisms that are either identical (HMGR inhibition) or distinct from that of statins (down-regulation of PCSK-9 mRNA synthesis). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that lycopene has this specific biological property. Being a natural, safer and cost effective agent, lycopene could be used as a complete regulator of cholesterol homeostasis and ASCVD.",

KEY WORDS: Biomarkers; Clinicopathological variables; Clinical relevance; Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT); Non-muscle invasive and muscle invasive bladder cancer BACKGROUND: High glucose concentrations alter the nitric oxide (NO*) bioavailability resulting in accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to endothelial dysfunction.Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients have a reduced ability to generate Nitric oxide (NO*),whose synthesis is catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Endothelial NOS (eNOS) is activated by insulin-signaling pathways. Severalvasodilator and constrictor molecules involved in the pathogenesis of macrovascular diseases are synthesized by cyclooxygenase (COX)enzyme. COX2 is the inducible form associated with inflammation and is also the target of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), commonly used in diabetic treatment. The aim of present study was to understand the correlation, if any, between COX2 and eNOS gene variants and their expression in T2DM cases as compared to normal healthy controls.",

C hronic kidney disease (CKD) being asymptomatic often remains undiagnosed or is diagnosed at an advanced stage. Specific symptoms of CKD usually develop at advanced stage or may be detected by chance following routine blood and urine examination. The disease is often associated with old age, diabetes, hypertention and cardiovascular disease etc. It describes abnormal kidney function and/ or structure. Urine and blood tests are used to detect and monitor kidney disease. Currently the key markers being used are abnormal urinary albumin (>30mg/g creatinine) and a persistant reduction in estimated glomerular filteration rate ( e GFR < 60ml/min/1.73m2) for three months or more irrespective of clinical diagnosis . Another way of assessing kidney functions has been by using a combination of e GFR and albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) . Increased ACR and decreased eGFR have been shown to be associated with increased risk of CKD. Accordingly patients with CKD have been staged from Stage 1 to Stage 5. Another important aspect is that kidney functions tend to decline with age and such people with age related decline in kidney functions may not progress to kidney failure. Under such circumstances staging of CKD may not work as the prognosis for a 75 year old patient with eGFR of 55 ml/min/1.73m2 may be different than that for a 45 year old patient with same e GFR . In addition eGFR may be too narrow a basis for assessing the risk of progression of CKD. Such findings potentiated the need for fairly comparable biomarkers for early detection of less severe cases of CKD.",

Therefore, there is anurgent need to identify new therapeutic strategies to treat this deadly disease. Glycolysis is substantially elevated inmany tumors including sorafenib resistant, prompted us to screen several drugs with anti-glycolytic activity. Wedemonstrate that the combination of glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) and sorafenib drastically reducestumorigenesis of sorafenib sensitive and resistant cells. However, other drug combination does not showany synergistic effect. Since only the combination showed promising results. We extended our study to test naturalcompound zerumbone; a monocyclic sesquiterpene. We observed that this compound reduced proliferation andclonogenic survival of HCC cells by altering metabolic reprograming, arrested cells at G2/M phase of cellcycle and by inducing apoptosis. To uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms, first, we performed profiling ofphosphokinases that showed significant inhibition in activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and STAT3 in HCC cells treatedwith zerumbone, pathways associated with worst patient survival. Gene expression profiling using microarray and analysis of microarray data using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that zerumbone treatment resulted in significant deregulation of genes regulating apoptotic, cell cycle and metabolism. Indeed, tracing glucose metabolic pathways by growing HCC cells with 13C-glucose and measuring extracellular and intracellular metabolites by 2D-NMR showed a reduction in glucose consumption and reduced lactate production, suggesting glycolytic inhibition. Additionally, zerumbone impeded shunting of glucose-6-phosphate through the pentose-phosphate-pathway, thereby forcing tumor cells to undergo cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. So, combined inhibition of glycolysis and mTOR signaling disrupted metabolicre-programming and thereby cell cycle and apoptosis in HCC and inhibited their growth. Thesefindings reveal novel therapeutic strategies to realize the potential benefit from targeting the Warburg effect. The occurrence of different cell death modalities in cells exposed to the same toxicant render mitigation strategies less effective.

Type 2DM (T2DM) is a disorder of insulin secretion and insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to use insulin properly, sometimes combined with an absolute insulin deficiency.Under physiological conditions, there is a balanced release of endothelialderived relaxing and contracting factors, but this delicate balance is altered in DM and atherosclerosis, thereby contributing to further progression of vascular and endorgan damage.DM produces disturbances of lipid profile, especially an increased susceptibility to lipid peroxidation, which is responsible for increased incidence of atherosclerosis. An enhanced oxidative stress has been observed in increased free radical production, lipid peroxidation and diminished antioxidant status.Studies indicate that risk is detectable in childhood, though these disorders may not emerge until adulthood.",

Theseversatile molecules can be a factor in aging and in the development or worsening of many degenerative diseases, such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, and Alzheimer's disease. A high consumption of AGEs through the diet has been directly linked to all of these chronic diseases.Modern diets are linked to high levels of AGEs. Certain foods, such as animal foods high in fat and protein, are more susceptible to AGEs formation during cooking. Several animal and human studies have shown that eating a low-AGE diet results in lower levels of AGEs in blood and tissues by up to 53%, plus a lower risk of heart and kidney disease, as well as increased insulin sensitivity. This is because AGEs adversely affect the body's cells, promoting oxidative stress and inflammation.High levels of inflammation over a long period of time can cause damage to every organ in the body. Decreased clearance of serum AGEs may further increase tissue AGEs accumulation. Evaluation of AGEs and their accumulation has been difficult because their structure is complex and heterogeneous. Non-invasive skin autofluorescence (SAF) measurement serves as a proxy for tissue accumulation of AGEs. Diabetes, hypertension and obesity all showed strong association with SAF, particularly when gender differences were taken into account. Further research using large number of samples will clarify the association between AGE's and their relationship with chronic diseases in different racial groups. A lzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that impairs learning, memory and cognitive judgment of an individual and is accompanied by mood swings, disorientation and finally delirium. The complex pathology of the AD is characterized by loss of neurogenesis, synaptic damage accompanied by substantial neuronal loss. Therefore, the most important eventin neuroregeneration and neuroprotection in AD is the selection of drugs that can act on multiple targets involved in the degenerative process and can induce neurorestorative/neuroprotective activities to produce fully functional neurons that can restore brain functions. For that reason neurogenesis is an attractive research avenue for therapy in AD since it is easily modifiable. Ethosuximide (ETH), is an anticonvulsant drug used for the treatment of epileptic seizures. However, the effects of ETH on endogenous neurogenesis and associated cellular and molecular mechanism(s) remain unexplored. Therefore, we studied the effects of ETH on rat multipotent neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation, differentiation adult hippocampal neurogenesis by generating amyloid beta (A\u03b21-42) toxin-induced rat model of AD-like phenotypes. ETH potently induced NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the hippocampus-derived NSC in vitro. Moreover, ETH enhanced NSC proliferation and differentiation in the rat model of the AD by activating the PI3K\u00b7Akt and Wnt\u00b7\u03b2-catenin transduction pathways leading to behavioural recovery in a rat model of AD. However, inhibition of the PI3K\u00b7Akt and Wnt\u00b7\u03b2-catenin pathways effectively blocked the mitogenic and neurogenic effects of ETH. In addition to this, in silico molecular target prediction docking studies suggest that ETH interacts with Akt, Dkk-1, and GSK-3\u03b2. This collectively indicates that ETH augments structural plasticity in rat hippocampus by stimulating endogenous neurogenesis via PI3K\u00b7Akt and Wnt\u00b7\u03b2catenin signalling pathways to reverse the behavioral changes associated with AD.",

Adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids has been shown to improve mortality however treatment regimen has number of drawbacks, which include longer treatment schedule of almost 18-24 months, associated toxicity and limited ability to cross the blood brain barrier. It necessitates the development of improved formulations of these drugs that can specifically target the desired sites. Nanomedicine based strategies have been successfully employed to address these shortcomings of conventional therapy.Double coated PBCA nanoparticles can be a promising vehicle to deliver anti tubercular drugs to brain and for drug targeting to the brain, our work suggest possibility of using nanoparticle formulation through oral route which is more convenient and patient friendly mode of drug delivery.Pharmacokinetic analysis showed sustained release of drugs in the plasma and brain for up to six days. Successful generation of murine model was confirmed by increased and stable bacillary loads in mice as well as histopathology of mouse tissues showing meningitis in brain, granuloma in lungs and tuberculous pathology in spleen.

The regulation of redox homeostasis is vital for maintaining cellular health and normal functions. The cells have intrinsic as well as extrinsic inducers of ROS including mitochondrial ETC, metabolic defects, ER stress, oncogenes, hypoxia, xenobiotics and ionizing radiation. The scavengers of ROS in the cells include a battery of antioxidant genes controlled by NRF-2 and small molecules reduced glutathione, NADPH anddietary antioxidants. Modulation of cellular redox is a promising anti-cancer strategy. Thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase system regulated by NRF-2 also play a vital role in maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis. We have used in-silico docking and high content screening to identify novel modulators of NRF-2 and TRX/TRXR system which disrupt cellular redox homeostasis. Docking studies revealed that baicalein (5,6,7 trihydroxy flavone) isolated from dried roots of Scutellariabaicalensis (Arjuna) could bind to the active site of thioredoxin reductase. Baicalein treatment led to significant reduction in the activity of thioredoxin reductase and nuclear levels of thioredoxin-1 thereby increasing ASK1 levels in lymphoma cells. We established a causal role of cellular redox modulation in potent anti-cancer efficacy of baicalein using CRISPR-Cas9 based knock-out of ASK1 and over-expression of thioredoxin-1. Besides showing anti-tumor efficacy, baicalein exhibited anti-inflammatory action via inhibition of NF-KB transactivation through modulation of TRX without inhibiting the DNA binding efficacy of NF-kB. Baicalein also activated Nrf-2 via inhibition of MKP3 and activation of ERK. The activation of NRF-2 was associated with increased abundance of hematopoietic stem cells and mitigation of ionizing radiation induced toxicity in vivo. We have established a causal role of NRF-2 using chemical inhibitors and knockout mice. Taking clues from the efficacy studies and its mechanism of action, we are preparing nanoformulations for increasing the therapeutic potential of this candidate drug.",

Therefore, indirectly the haemoglobin also affects the process of glycation and the recommendation is to interpret HbA1c with caution in presence of anemia. Many studies have evaluated the correlation between average blood glucose and HbA1c, but there are very few studies that have assessed the alteration in HbA1c with haemoglobin levels; there are no guidelines to help the clinician in interpretation in the presence of anemia. Hence, this study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between Hb and HbA1c when there is anemia.

Lifestyle modification with the diet and exercise adjustment is the core therapeutic approach for NASH. GDF-15 has pivotal role and their expression has been linked with oxidative stress, protein glycation, and inflammation changes in various diseases state conditions.Non alcoholic fatty liver disease has become a common cause for the chronic liver disease and recently it has been observed that diet, genetics and lifestyle contribute to the onset and progression of NASH which may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Blood samples were collected from the OPD of Gastroenterology, and department of Medicine AIIMS, New Delhi. Each of them was screened for serology and subsequently patients were sub-grouped for NASH (n=42), HBV (n=56), HCV (48) and non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (n=44). Forty five healthy subjects were also included and screened for anti HCV, HBsAg and HBeAg in the study. Clinical, biochemical, haematological investigations were done for all subjects. Evidence suggest that various biomarkers such as adiponectin, leptin, Insulin Resistance, BMI, proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine,oxidants stress index, micronutrient antioxidants, genetic polymorphism such as SNPs and GDF-15 are associated in metabolic abnormalities. GDF15 levels were significantly higher in NASH subjects than in controls (P = .014). Among NAFLD patients, the highest quartile of GDF15 levels was significantly associated with a risk of higher viral loads even after adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, aspartate aminotransferase, platelet, albumin, insulin resistance and low HDL but not with NASH risk. Multivariate analysis may provide the significant information with the association between age, genders, waist circumference, hypertension, insulin resistance. GDF-15 levels have some hidden relation to changes in body weight, waist hip ratio, BMI and HOMA IR. Our finding suggests that high circulating GDF-15 levels may serve as a novel biomarker of NAFLD hence there is a need to develop anti-fibrotic micronutrient antioxidant that can improve the quality of life.",

The plant kingdom is a wide field to search for natural effective oral anti-hyperglycemic agents that have minimum side effects. More than 1200 plant species have been recorded to be used empirically worldwide for their alleged anti-hyperglycemic activity.Recently, considerable research has been focused on postprandial hyperglycemia apart from fasting glycemic control because it doubles the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Therefore, phytochemicals (natural compounds)showing improvement in post-prandial hyperglycemia via alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibition from plant sources offer an attractive strategy for the control of type 2 diabetes. Guanidium compounds have been reported to possess anti-diabetic activities from last 3 decades. Metformin, a biguanide, is a widely used drug against diabetes and was derived from medicinal plant. This study highlights the novel anti-diabetic compound isolated and purified from aqueous extract of germinated Glycine max seeds. The compound contains guanidine groups and has been designated as Glynide (patent filed) which was found to be beneficial in controlling both fasting and post prandial hyperglycemia by showing salutary effects on glycemic index and inhibition of alpha-glucosidase and alphaamylase.Postprandial hyperglycemia is characterized by hyperglycemic spikes that induce oxidative stresswhich increases the risk of atherosclerosis in diabetics. Glynide also showed significant antioxidant activity as well as potential in correcting dyslipidemia in STZ+NAD induced diabetic rats.",

It exhibits seroprevelance of ~60% in the United States and as high as 100% in developing countries of lower socioeconomic environments. HCMV is a DNA virus, belongs to ?-Herpesviridae family having genome of size 230-240Kb. Upon primary infection it establishes lifelong latency in its host, i.e., Humans. HCMV evolved with humans and exhibits various strategies to counter the human antiviral mechanisms for its survival in the human. The discovery of viral miRNAs and their spectacular biological roles,attracted us to investigate the role of HCMV miRNAs on human antiviral mechanisms. HCMV reported to encode 26 mature miRNAs from 16 precursor miRNAs, reported to exhibit immune evasive roles. By using various bioinformatic tools, we attempted to speculate the HCMV miRNAs role on apoptosis, autophagy etc. Our in silico results show HCMV miRNAs target the apoptosis and autophagy, HCMV miR, UL-70-3p & UL-148D target the apoptotic pathway. They target the mRNAs of extrinsic/intrinsic and ER-induced apoptotic pathways. In this paper, we discuss our in silico results, how HCMV uses its miRNA machinery in overcoming the antiviral mechanisms in benefitting its survival in the host. M olecular medicine holds great promise to improve patient care by increasing the precision and predictability of diagnostic procedures, and by individualizing and targeting therapeutic approaches. Recent technological advancements and biological discoveries have given a tremendous boost to the development of molecular medicine-based approaches. These developments have unprecedented possibilities to impact the fundamentals and practice of medicine, however, certain challenges needs to be overcome before that could happen. We, in the department of Molecular Medicine & Biotechnology department at Sanjay Gandhi PGI, are using some of these approaches with the ambition to predict development of human diseases in a non-invasive/ less-invasive manner. My talk will highlight findings from some of these studies. In addition, recent advancements in Molecular Medicine, and associated challenges in their clinical implementation will also be discussed. D iarrhea is the second biggest killer of children globally, with more than 800,000 under-fives dying every year according to Unicef. A quarter of these deaths occur in India. Vaccines can effectively control the morbidity and mortality due to diarrheal diseases. Availability of multivalent vaccines for common diarrhoeal diseases is highly desirable. The prerequisite for developing multivalent vaccines is the availability of a safe vector. Genetically constructed live attenuated bacterial vectors may be derived from pathogenic bacteria or the commensal bacteria. This presentation describes the construction of a Vibrio cholera chassis which can be made to deliver the antigens of common mucosal pathogens. The implications of using such vaccine vectors on the mucosal immunity will be discussed ",

            "text": "Biological systems regulate their internal environments as well as their relationships to the outside world. The regulatory mechanism usually involves negative feedback, which always generates oscillations since there is bound to be delay in the feedback loop. The period of these rhythms can be from minutes to several months. In all vertebrates, the circadian (circa = about; dian = day) organization, showing rhythmicity of about a day, is driven by a central oscillation generating system. There are also circadian oscillators in the peripheral tissues. Long livedspecies also appear controlling the time and duration of the different life-history stages in the year using another clock system, called the circannual (circa = about; anuum = year) system. Modern human lifestyle with extended hours of wakefulness and associated extended frequent feeding and exposure to light significantly and chronically perturbs the circadian system, profoundly enhances risk factor for diabetes, obesity cancer and early aging. Also, humans like many vertebrates show robust seasonal rhythms in their health and wellbeing; the birth month has been suggested to have the effects that might persist throughout life. Human lifestyles under artificial conditions of 'eternal summer' provide the most extreme example for disconnects from the natural season, and this in the long-run may make humans vulnerable to increased morbidity and mortality.In this lecture, I intend to emphasize the need for a better understanding of the daily and seasonal biology against the backdrop of rapid changes in the climate and lifestyles and other anthropogenic impacts in the surroundings. Interestingly, the lecture is to arouse enthusiasm among medical scientist, since for most part my lab continues to work in the area of basic science research using diurnal birds as the model system. Like humans, birds are diurnal, have invaded almost all walks of the ecosystems, and hence offer an excellent experimental system to understand the mechanism of temporal adaptation without pre-disposition to the metabolic syndrome and early agingas in humans. For example, migratory birds show hyperphagia, body fattening and gain weight up to 200%, and exhibit concurrent gonadal growth under long days. This isspontaneously followed by decrease in food intake, body fat store with total loss of gained body mass, and gonadal regression. However, surprisingly, there is no report of any metabolic diseases including diabetes or early aging in these birds. C ardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have now become the leading cause of mortality in India. 30 million heart patients are residing in India, where 14 million are in urban areas and 16 million in rural areas. More than 80% of sudden cardiac deaths in the world are caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD), and the remaining 20% of cases are caused by other diseases including congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, aortic valve disease, left ventricular hypertrophy and other cardiac disorders. One of the major challenges in cardiovascular disease is the identification of reliable biomarkers in serum/plasma. In the past few years, the crucial role of different micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in the cardiovascular system has been widely recognized. Recently, it was discovered that extracellular miRNAs circulate in the bloodstream and that such circulating miRNAs are remarkably stable. This extracellular miRNA stability is due to packaged with lipid vesicles or by being associated with protein or lipoprotein complexes. Although the precise cellular release mechanisms of miRNAs remain largely unknown. The identification of stable circulating miRNAs challenges a number of concepts and launches a new generation of potential biomarkers. Various circulatory miRNAs like miR-1, miR133, miR122, miR-126, miR-129 and miR-155 are known to be stable blood based biomarkers for cardiovascular disease. These findings have raised the possibility that circulatory miRNAs may play a role as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in cardiovascular disease. I mpairment of spermatogenesis and defective sperm function is the most prevalent cause of male infertility. Recent reports indicate that increasing male infertility could be due to genomic abnormalities. The etiology of sperm DNA damage is multi-factorial and compromised due to nuclear defects, protamine deficiency and oxidative stress. In present study, we aim to assess sperm DNA integrity, protamine-1/protamine-2 ratio, oxidative stress markers and semen characteristics in infertile and fertile men.",

Superoxide anion is critical for host defense against fungal and bacterial pathogens and efficient immune responses; however, uncontrolled monocyte-derived O2.-may contribute to chronic inflammation and tissue injury. We have previously identified several pathways that regulate the activity of NADPH oxidase in human monocytes; however, the receptor(s) responsible for the activation of NADPH oxidase in primary human monocytes have not yet been determined. This study shows that pattern recognition receptors, namely Dectin-1 and Complement Receptor 3, are essential for regulating NADPH oxidase activity in Zymosan-activated human monocytes. We show that TLR2 and TLR4 are not required for NADPH oxidase activation by Zymosan. In addition, this study focuses on Dectin-1 downstream signaling and complex formation with intracellular signaling proteins. Our findings in human monocytes are supportive of the prior recognized role of Src and Syk tyrosine kinases in regulating Dectin-1-mediated ROS production in murine macrophages. Our data also shows that Src and Syk are tyrosine phosphorylated in Zymosan-treated cells and that they both regulate each other's activity. Furthermore, we focused on Dectin-1 complex formation with intracellular signaling proteins including Syk, Src and PKC\u03b4, protein kinases that regulates NADPH oxidase activity in human monocytes. This is the first study to show the involvement of PKC\u03b4 in Dectin-1 signaling. We found that the activity of PKC\u03b4 is required for its own complex formation with Dectin-1 as well as Syk-Dectin-1 interaction. In contrast, Src and Syk inhibitors had no effect on PKC\u03b4 association with Dectin-1. Blocking the activity of Src inhibited phospho-Syk/ Dectin-1 complex formation which supports the role of Src in regulating Syk tyrosine phosphorylation/ activation. Our data confirms that Dectin-1, a pattern recognition receptor, is a key player in the regulation of NADPH oxidase in Zymosan-activated human monocytes and we introduce PKC? as a novel player in Dectin-1 signaling. To expand on this project, the study also includes data reporting an endogenous pathophysiological protein, osteopontin, as a novel ligand for Dectin-1. We show here that osteopontin induces the oxidative burst in monocytes through Dectin-1. We also show data supporting binding of osteopontin to Dectin-1.",

Our studies have shown that variant genotypes of drug metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) modify the risk to tobacco induced squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (HNSCC) and lung. Prevalence of certain CYP haplotypes (haplotypes of CYP1A1, 1B1 and 2E1) and combinations of genotypes of CYPs and GSTs in cases demonstrated the importance of gene-gene interactions in determining the risk to these malignancies. Likewise, several fold increase in the risk in tobacco users (both in the form of chewing or smoking) have indicated the importance of interaction of environmental risk factors in determining the risk to the malignancy of head & neck or lungs. To determine if the susceptible genotype changes are associated with phenotypes of increased resistance or susceptibility, studies were initiated to identify the expression and regulation of PAHmetabolizing CYP1A1 and 1B1 isoenzymes in freshly prepared rat peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) isolated from the control and cases suffering from lung cancer. RT-PCR studies demonstrated significantly higher mRNA expression of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-responsive CYP1A1 isoenzyme in the freshly prepared PBL isolated from lung cancer cases. This increase in the mRNA expression was found to be associated with an increase in the catalytic activity of CYP1A1 in freshly prepared PBL. Interestingly, the variant genotypes of CYP1A1 in the controls were found to be associated with much higher increase in the expression of blood lymphocyte CYP1A1 when compared to those with wild type genotypes. Further, the cases with variant genotypes of CYP1A1 showed much higher increase in the mRNA expression of CYP1A1 and its associated activity in the freshly prepared PBL when compared to the controls. These studies have led us to conclude that CYPs could not only be used as a tool to predict susceptibility to environment induced malignancies but, importantly, integrating expression and functional data with genetic deficiencies may allow more precise identification of biomarkers that may help to identify true risks of exposure and diseases.",

Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu 180001, India P lacental development involves a complex structural and physiological reorganization during pregnancy, directed towards the establishment of a continuous nutrient supply to the developing fetus and proper maintenance of pregnancy. Placentation, thus, resembles tumourigenesis in many aspects like rapid cell division, migration and invasion, overlapping gene expression profiles and escape from immune detection and is hence referred to as pseudomalignant tissue. Regulation of placental development involves a highly complex differential global gene expression profile varying with gestational age.The importance of these intrinsic molecular controls become increasingly evident in abnormal pregnancies that are characterized by aberrant trophoblast proliferation/invasion like preeclampsia and hydatidiform mole. However, the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms involved in the regulation of various malignancy and invasion related genes during the advancement of gestational period and their aberrations in pregnancy related disorders have largely been unknown. Therefore in this study, we sought to examine the epigenetic regulation of various molecular events during normal pregnancy and their dysregulation in pregnancy related disorders.

Metal and metal oxide nanoparticle with encapsulated anticancer proteins or biomolecules, bioconjugated with highly potent single or multiple drugs (who have severe side effects) have been found highly effective against cancer at very much low concentration. In the given investigations the enzymatic gold nanoparticles have been synthesized by using a natural anticancer agent bromelain (a cysteine protease) as a reducing as well as a capping agent. Eventually, these NPs were used to bioconjugate with cisplatin alone, cisplatin along with doxorubicin, and cisplatin in combination with doxorubicin and Methotrexate. These combos were found highly effective against osteosarcoma at much lower concentration with minimum side effects due to the synergistic effect of bromelain with these bioconjugated drugs. Further, glucose encapsulated Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles (G-CdO NPs) have been synthesized chemically by using glucose as a capping agent. The inhibitory role of G-CdO NPs against Human Cervical cancer cell line-HeLa and Human osteosarcoma cell line-Saos-2 by preventing early and lateglycation was also explored. These nanoparticles were found effective antiglycating agents and they were found to be highly effective against AGEs intervention.

T he development of resistance mechanism by cancer cells to the existing drugs is a major roadblock to the cancer therapy. Therefore, agents that can sensitize the cancer cells to the existing drugs are needed.Accumulating evidence over the past several years has indicated that Mother Nature has been a \"gold mine\" for drug discovery. Here, we provide evidence that bharangin, a diterpenoid isolated from Premnaherbacea exhibit activities against multiple cancer types including breast cancer. Bharangin sensitizes cancer cells to doxorubicin and gemcitabine. The pro-inflammatory cytokine induced NF-B activation in cancer cells that was suppressed by bharangin.The diterpenoid also suppressed phosphorylation and degradation of I B, I B? kinase activation, p65 nuclear translocation and p65 phosphorylation all of which are required for NF-B activation. Immunoprecipitation and molecular docking studies indicated that bharangin can directly inhibit binding of p65 to DNA. The diterpenoid also suppressed the expression of proteins involved in tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis. Interestingly, the genetic deletion of p65 abolished the effects of bharangin.The diterpenoid also induced expression of tumor suppressor lncRNAs (MEG-3, MHRT, NEAT, GAS-5), while down-regulating oncogenic H19 expression. Furthermore, an abundance in the p65 expression was observed in breast tumor tissues. The pro-inflammatory transcription factor, NF-?B is known to be regulated by H19 lncRNA. Overall, the suppression of H19 expression and NF-?B activation by bharangin may contribute to its anti-cancer activities. INTRODUCTION: Cripto1 (CR1), a member of the EGF-CFC protein family which differentially expresses during early embryogenesis, is involved in the regulation of different signaling pathways during fetal development. CR-1 is also an oncogenic growth factor involved in tumorigenesis through influencing cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasion. Over expression of CR1 is detected early embryonic life and in various cancers but how the expression of CR1 in cancer tissue is regulated is not clearly known. There are reports that CR1 auto-regulates its own expression but it does not explain the differential expression of CR1 in different phases of life. We proposed that CR1 is regulated by epigenetic regulations viz promoter DNA Methylation and histone modifications, like other oncofetal proteins. In this study, we analyzed the CR1 expression and concurrent CR1 promoter Methylation pattern in tumor tissue collected from OSCC patients as well as in immortalized cancer cell lines.",

T he well characterised endocrine pathway of vitamin D metabolism and its activities are solely responsible for vitamin D regulation of plasma calcium and phosphate homeostasis under control of serum 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D, the biologically active metabolite of vitamin D. This pathway protects against the metabolic bone disease of rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults. The critical level for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D to maintain adequate serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is 20 nmol/L (8 ng/ml) and is synthesised by the kidney.In contrast adequate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D protects against osteoporosis and reduces risk of fracture at a higher level becausethis activity depends on 1,25dihydroxyvitamin Dbeing synthesized bybone cells. This protective effect against fracture is only observed in combination with adequate dietary calcium intake. Similar metabolism of vitamin D protects against cancer death and infectious disease. Metabolism of 25hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by macrophages has been well described to enhance killing of microorganisms. The critical level for serum 25hydroxyvitamin D for metabolism by non-renal cells is 50 to 75 nmol/L (20 to 30 ng/ml). Such autocrine actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D have now been demonstrated in skin, prostate, breast and colonic tissues, in these latter tissues to protect against cancer. In these tissues activities of vitamin D include reduction of cell proliferation and stimulation of cell maturation, activities which reduce the risk of cancer.The critical level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D for optimal health of these tissues is dependent on the level of the enzyme which converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (CYP27B1) and therefore may vary for different tissues. There is general international consensus that screening for vitamin D status is of limited value but a number of high risk groups warrant evaluation of serum 25hydroxyvitamin D levels.

The high systemic oxidative stress in CRD and DM is considered as a major pathogenic mechanism leading to CVDs as demonstrated in ourstudies and publications. OSAS is a condition characterized by-cessation of respiration due to bstruction of the upper air-way during sleep. Its prevalence is approximately 4% in males and 2% in females in the adult population. Persistent system icinflammation in OSAS plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of CVDs such as systemic arterial hypertension, coronary artery diseases, and heart failure. In OSAS, each episode of air way obstruction is followed by a decreased arterial O2 saturation. Intermittent hypoxia and hypoxia/reoxygen at ion sequencesin OSAS are believed to be the major reasons to increase cardiovascular risk by enhanced sympathetic activation and oxidative stress. There is limited and conflicting information in the literature investigating risk predictors for CVDsin OSAS patients. In order to identify potential risk biomarkers for CVDs in OSAS, we measured plasma soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (sTNF-R1), myeloperoxidase (MPO)as markers of persistent systemic inflammation; total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidativ estatus (TOS), ischaemia-modified albumin (IMA) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) as markers of oxidative stress and copept in as a new marker of CVDs. Increased systemic inflammation as indicated by elevated plasma MPO activity and sTNF-R1 levels in the OSAS patients might contributeto-the higher incidence of CVDs. High systemicoxi-dativestress as indicatedbyincreased TOS and decreased TAC levels is reflected by increased AOPP with out causing an increase in IMA. In contrast to high copept in levels in CVDs, our finding of low copept in levels in the OSAS patients might be due to low secretion of antidiuretichormone. Therefore, we consider plasma MPO activity, sTNF-R1, TOS, TAC and AOPP levels in the OSAS patients as potential risk predictors for CVDs.

Sometimes with a flexible and feasible national program, laboratory quality systems can be gradually improved of the whole laboratory management system and laboratories that demonstrated outstanding performance in the quality management process will be strongly encouraged to enroll in an established ISO 15189 accreditation scheme.

The present study was conducted with the objective to find out the sensitivity and specificity of GPBB over other cardiac markers i.e. myoglobin and CKMB in patients of AMI within 4 hour after the onset of chest pain. The study includes 300 AMI patients and 100 normal healthy individuals as controls. In all the cases and controls, serum GPBB and myoglobin concentrations were measured by ELISA where as CKMB was measured by diagnostic kit supplied by ERBA. The sensitivity and specificity of glycogen phosphorylase BB (GPBB) were greater than CKMB and myoglobin in patients of AMI within 4 hour after the onset of chest pain. Hence, glycogen phosphorylase BB (GPBB) can be used as additional biomarker for the early diagnosis of AMI.",

Male adult 36 Wistar NIN rats were taken from the National Centre for Laboratory Animal Sciences, National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India and were randomly divided into six groups (Group I: control, group II: Fluoride 5 mg/L, Group III: Fluoride 10 mg/L, Group IV: Fluoride 15 mg/ L, Group V: Fluoride 50 mg/L and Group VI: Fluoride 100 mg/L). Group I served as control and Group II to VI were administered respective F concentrations in their drinking water. Animals from each group were examined after 30, 60 and 90 days for F toxicity changes. It was observed that F induce dose and duration dependent diet intake, body weight gain, signs of dental fluorosis, urinary, serum, bone and teeth fluoride levels along with histopathological changes in liver and kidney tissue. Results of the study revealed that there was a significant decrease in diet and water intake in the Group VI compared to Group I, II, III. The significantly increased exposure of F through water in group V and VI as compared to other groups has shown alterations in their food conversion ratio, body weight gain, and significant increase in the urinary and serum fluoride levels. Increased fluoride dose dependent development in dental fluorosis was observed. Significant increase in bone and teeth fluoride levels in the Group V and VI compared to Group I, II, and III was observed. Histopathology of kidney showed focal fibrosis in medulla with few dilated tubules in the kidney of 100 ppm fluoride group compared to control, 5, 10, 15 and 50 ppm fluoride groups. Whereas histopathology of liver showed microvacuolation in 33-66% liver in 50 ppm fluoride group compared to control, 5, 10, 15 ppm fluoride groups. Microvacuolation in >90% liver was observed in 100 ppm fluoride group compared to control, 5, 10, 15 and 50 ppm fluoride groups. However, there was no significant differences between the body organ ratio of brain, kidney, heart, testes and liver among all the groups. In conclusion the dose dependent effect of F starts at 15mg/L at third month and the effect of 50 mg/L starts from second month onwards.",

Similar results were obtained with serum ALP & serum total bilirubin. CONCLUSIONS: ?-tocopherol (200 mg/kg bw, oral) was found to have hepatoprotective effect against antitubercular drugs induced hepatotoxicity in albino rabbits. P rotective role of curcumin in arsenic induced cognitive deficits involving NMDA receptor dysfunctions has been investigated. Treatment with curcumin ameliorated arsenic induced alterations in NMDA receptors, its receptor subunits and synaptic proteins -pCaMKII\u03b1, PSD-95 and SynGAP both in vivo in rat hippocampus and in vitro in primary hippocampal cultures. Curcumin was found to protect arsenic induced changes in hippocampus by modulating decreased levels of BDNF, pAkt, pErk\u00bd, pGSK3\u03b2 and pCREB. Treatment of hippocampal cultures with pharmacological inhibitors for Erk\u00bd, GSK3\u03b2 and Akt individually was found to inhibit levels of CREB and proteins associated with PI3K/Akt/GSK3\u03b2 pathway. Arsenic induced learning and memory deficits in rats assessed by water maze and Y-maze were found to be improved on treatment with curcumin. The findings are interesting and exhibit that curcumin exercises its neuroprotective effect through PI3K/Akt pathway which could affect NMDA receptor and downstream signalling through TrK\u03b1 and BDNF in arsenic induced cognitive deficits in hippocampus.",

The cationic charge of nanoparticles subsequently facilitated the endosomal escape and promoted the nuclear accumulation of DOX. Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial membrane depolarization studies supported the enhanced efficacy of NP in comparison to free DOX and non-modified. Intravenous pharmacokinetics and bio-distribution investigations indicated that pH sensitive nanoparticles can significantly prolong the blood circulation time of DOX in biological system and increase the drug accumulation to tumor site. Consequent to this NP also exhibited much enhanced therapeutic efficacy and lower toxicity in tumor-bearing rats compared to free DOX.

Mitogenic cell signalling pathway Sonic-hedgehog Gli1 (Shh-Gli1) has substantial contribution in the tumoriogenesis. Although, mitogenic pathway Shh roles in brain tumour drug resistance is not thoroughly investigated. Interestingly, we found that Shh-Gli1 signalling pathway regulates the expression of novel stem cell marker, BMI1 (B-Cell specific Moloney-Murine Leukemia Virus), in brain tumour. Noteworthy, we also demonstrated high expression pattern of Multidrug resistance protein in brain tumour. MRP expression was decreased by BMI1 siRNA and Shh cell signalling specific inhibitor Gli antagonist 61 (GANT61). Intriguingly, GANT61 inhibited brain tumour in vitro cell colony compared to temozolomide, common drug for brain tumour treatment. Moreover, a synergic effect of GANT61 and temozolomide significantly decreased the LD50 of temozolomide in the cell colony experiments. Therefore, our results suggest that there is a potential network of Shh-Gli1-BMI1 cell signalling to regulate MRP and to promote chemoresistance in glioma. INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results from an outside force traumatically injure the brain secondary to falls, vehicle accidents and violence. It is known to affect cognitive, physical and psychological skills. Frontal lobes play an essential role in attention, long term memory and executive functions. Most of the quantitative DTI studies are based on region of interest (ROI) analysis and may not represent the true extent of Diffuse Axonal Injury(DAI) in these patients. Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) helps to demonstrate structural abnormality of the whole fiber tracts and is proposed for DAI quantification in patients with frontal lobe injury to assess DAI in various fiber bundles and to look for correlation of these fiber bundles measures with various neuropsychological tests (NPT).",

Inhibitor of DNA binding (Id1-4) proteins are helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors. Id proteins are often deregulated in human cancers, where they contribute to tumor growth, invasiveness and metastasis, and have been linked to the self-renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Thus, a complete understanding of the function of Id genes in normal adult stem cells and CSCs could lead to the development of novel therapies. Id1 is induced in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote HSC proliferation and differentiation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that Id1 may function during stress hematopoiesis. Id1-/-HSCs show increased self-renewal in serial bone marrow transplantation (BMT) assays, which is correlated with decreased proliferation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and ROS production. As a result, Id1-/-HSCs harbor less DNA damage, show increased quiescence and reduced aging. Mechanistically, we found cytokines and other pro-inflammatory stimuli present in the hematopoietic microenvironment after ?-irradiation induced Id1 expression. Id1-/-HSCs fail to properly respond to cytokine-induced proliferation, suggesting that HSC exhaustion is mediated, in part, by chronic proliferative stress. Id1-/-HSCs are protected from other chronic proliferative stresses including chronic genotoxic and inflammatory stress, and ageing. Thus, targeting Id1 inhibition may be therapeutically useful to improve HSC survival and function during BMT, chronic stress and ageing.",

A total of 300 subjects (150 T2DM and 150 NHC) aged between 25-75 years were recruited in the study. Various anthropometric and clinical parameters were investigated. Circulatory adiponectin levels were also evaluated. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was used for genotyping. Mean levels of anthropometric and biochemical parameters were significantly raised in T2DM than NHC. While, the levels of circulatory adiponectin was found significantly lower in T2DM as compared to NHC (p=0.02). Genotyping analysis of rs17846866 of ADIPOQ gene variant shown that there were no significant association of TT versus TG genotype (p=0.13) as well as TT versus GG genotype (p=0.11) with T2DM patients and NHC. However, T and G allele frequencies of the rs17846866 had significant association with T2DM cases as compared to NHC (p=0.02). There was significant impact of rs17846866 on circulatory adiponectin level, PPBS, HbA1c and serum creatinine (p<0.001, 0.04, 0.03 and <0.001, respectively). Circulatory adiponectin level was significantly lower in GG genotype as compared to TG & GG genotypes (p<0.001). Haplotype frequency analysis in T2DM and NHC of ADIPOQ gene; variants -11377C/G and +10211T/G showed that C allele of -11377 was negatively correlated with T allele of +10211, i.e. CT was protective haplotype while CG haplotype increased the risk for T2DM.",

INTRODUCTION: -HPV is associated with more than 95% of invasive cervical cancers.High risk types such as HPV type16 and type 18 are among most common types found in cervical cancers and are the main factors implicated in cervical carcinogenesis. HPV encodes two proteins E6 and E7 which together promote cellular proliferation, prolong cell-cycle progression, and prevent apoptosis. HPV Virus maintains these cellular processes by abrogating the function of two key tumor suppressors retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and p53 by E7 and E6 respectively. One of the least studies area is the folding, assembly and remodeling of these two tumor suppressors.",

It is involved in the assembly/ remodeling/activation of large protein or protein-RNA complexes. R2TP complex is composed of four proteins: RUVBL1, RUVBL2, RPAP31 and PIH1D1. Notably PIH1D1 component of R2TP complex binds to phosphorylated proteins, these proteins in turn brings clients to R2TP -HSP90 complex for assembly and remodeling. The phosphorylation site recognized by PIH1D1 component of R2TP complex is phosphorylated by evolutionary conserved Enzyme kinase CK2 on a motif DSDD/E. We recently found human Ecdysoneless (ECD) contains this motif and interacts with R2TP complex.Interestingly Human ECD was discovered during the interactome analysis of E6 proteins from high risk HPV 16 and 18. ECD has been shown to interact with tumor suppressors retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and P53.Based on our preliminary data and published studies we hypothesize that HPV E6 protein may prevent recruitment and remodeling of tumor suppressor pRB and P53 by blocking ECDs binding to PIH1D1 component of R2TP complex.",

Up on further exploration lysate prepared from the cells transfected with HPV E6, PIH1D1 component of R2TP complex was unable to pull down ECD from these lysates. Based on the previous studies that pRB interacts with ECD we suspect ECD may act as a bridge between R2TP complex and pRB and HPV E6 might block this bridge. To test this hypothesis, we employed various biochemical techniques, intriguingly ECD turned out be bridge between ECD and pRB and HPV E6 is blocking this bridge by directly interacting with ECD. To elucidate the biological significance of pRB recruitment to R2TP complex, knockdown of ECD and PIH1D1 component of R2TP complex component leads to inactivation of pRB and thus increase the proliferation of these cells.

A major challenge in modern obstetrics is early identification of pregnancies at high-risk of preterm PE and undertaking of the necessary measures to improve placentation and reduce the prevalence of the disease. Early PE (requiring delivery before 34 weeks) rather than late PE is associated with an increased risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity and both short-term and long-term maternal complications. Early identification of women at highrisk for PE could potentially improve pregnancy outcome as intensive maternal and fetal monitoring in such patients would lead to an earlier diagnosis of the clinical signs of the disease and the associated fetal growth restriction and avoid the development of serious complications through pharmacological interventions starting from the first trimester. The underlying mechanism for PE is thought to be impaired placentation, documented by the findings of abnormal blood flow in the uterine arteries and reduced maternal serum levels of placental products.PlGF (Placental Growth Factor) has been shown to be the most discriminating biochemical marker for pre-eclampsia, and early-onset pre-eclampsia in particular. The patient-specific risk of developing PE in the first trimester can be predicted by a combination of factors in the maternal history, prior or family history of PE, and the maternal blood pressure(MAP), uterine artery pulsatility index (UtPI), PAPP-A, PLGF. The antiangiogenic factor soluble fmslike tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1) and the sFlt-1:PlGF ratio has shown promise in clinical research as a biomarker for predicting and diagnosing preeclampsia in the second and third trimester.",

In order to maintain a strict control over the results generated in clinical chemistry laboratories, a number of procedures are followed to maintain the quality of results. The procedures followed in order to compare the performances between different laboratories are known as external quality assessment (EQA). Separate EQA programmes for different analysers are recommended as the methods and principles may be different for them. BACKGROUND: Quality in a clinical laboratory is defined as the degree of excellence and conformance to requirements leading to a reliable system. QC in a clinical laboratory is a statistical process used to monitor and evaluate the analytical process that produces patient results. The QC programme is primarily concerned with the identification of errors and the procedure to recognize and minimize them. The role of an effective QC system in these laboratories is to ensure that not only are medically significant errors detected, but no false rejections occur since retesting associated with these rejections attracts a high cost. An external quality monitoring scheme is a technique to challenge a laboratory's internal QC methods and procedures. It involves the principles of cooperation and coordination between the organizing laboratory and participants.",

IL-33 also resulted in increased proliferation of MCs in vitro, as explored by WST assay. Cell cycle analysis further confirmed this result by showing increased G2 cell populations in MCs stimulated with IL-33. We found that IL-33-mediated MC proliferation requires ST2 and MyD88, is independent of Kit, and is mediated through a p38 MAPK-dependent pathway. IL-33 did not induce degranulation and was not cytotoxic for MCs. CONCLUSION: we report here a novel role of IL-33 as an inducer of mast cell proliferation through ST2/ Myd88 and p38 MAPK-dependent pathway. This novel mechanism for increasing MC proliferation and numbers further defines the role of IL-33 in MC-dependent diseases including allergies and may help to develop novel approaches for the treatment of these disorders.

Pesticides have become an integral part of ecosystem and their widespread use in public health programs and agriculture have resulted in severe environmental pollution leading to potential health hazards, the extent of which depends upon the amount of residue and its toxicity. The general population is subjected to low dose chronic pesticide exposure through food and environment. The residue analysis of human samples shows an increasing trend in pesticide levels in serum, adipose tissue, breast milk, urine and others. Implications on human health of pesticides residues following subchronic exposure have yet to be comprehensively answered.Exposure to pesticides may be associated with neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, genotoxicity and adverse reproductive outcomes, and their effects have been attributed to increased oxidative stress. Pesticides cause reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in significant quantities, which has been suggested to result in oxidative stress and a signal for apoptosis. Findings from our studies have revealed a concomitant genotoxic and apoptotic effect of the pesticides in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Since the long-term genotoxic effects of pesticides on humans cannot be ignored and it is therefore the need of the hour to search for protective measures to minimize their harmful effects. We havereported that PBMC undergoes dose-dependent apoptotic cell death following pesticide exposure and also highlights the effectiveness of cucumin in counteracting pesticide induced cytotoxicity. HSPs have emerged recently as an antiapoptotic molecules and functions to modulate the engagement or progression of apoptosis induced by pesticide. The inducible expression of HSPs could render the human PBMCs to withstand and recover from the toxic effects of subchronic pesticide exposure. Though the linkage between cellular events induced by stress and cell death is known, yet the molecular mechanism highlighting the specific role of heat shock protein (HSP) in pesticide-mediated cytotoxicity is not clear. To better understand the mechanism, we employ curcumin an HSP inducers, and also highlighting their attenuating effects against the apoptotic ability of these pesticides. We emphasizes that antioxidants protects cells efficiently, suggesting their possible therapeutic intervention as well as underscoring the mechanism of pesticide-induced toxicity at cellular level. Also, such studies will provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms behind pesticide poisoning and might suggest new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for their toxicity and remedy. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most serious microvascular complications and remains the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD). The persistent albuminuria has been considered to be central hallmark of DN. However, albuminuria has the capacity to indicate kidney damages for clinician, microalbuminuria is not a specific biomarker for prediction of DN prior to the onset of devastating complication. There are numerous cellular and molecular defects persisting prior to appearing clinical symptoms. Therefore, need to look for easy and accurate way to detect DN before its beginning. Moreover, better understanding of disease pathogenesis might be helpful to identify new biomarkers and novel mechanism underlying DN to improve existing therapeutic regime. It is now accepted that initiation and progression of DN are result of complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors that could be explained by epigenetic modifications. Environmental signals could alter the intracellular pathways by chromatin modifiers and regulate gene expression patterns leading to diabetes and its complications. However, our knowledge about the epigenetic mechanisms linking environmental factors and pathophysiology of diabetes and its associated complications is very limited. A hyperglycaemic environment in diabetic patients causes an imbalance in metabolic homeostasis that may alter gene expression. Recent epigenetic studies have focused on how gene transcription controls cell behavior in response to environmental changes. It will help to recognize novel approaches to inhibit, attenuate, or reverse the persistent deleterious consequences of diabetes in the kidney.",

INTRODUCTION: Pre-eclampsia in pregnancy is a common disease. The incidence of pre-eclampsia in India ranges from 5-15%. It is the major cause of low birth weight, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery of the child and morbidity and mortality both in mother and child. Proteinuria is a major component of pre-eclampsia. Since the collection of urine for 24 hourperiod is cumbersome and delays diagnosis, the albumincreatinine ratio (ACR) is used to measure proteinuria. Many of the postulated pathophysiology of preeclampsia, one of the pathophysiology includes dyslipidemia due to endothelial dysfunction. There is a positive correlation between dyslipidemia and systolic blood pressure in pre-eclampsia cases. RESULT: Itis found that there is asignificant increase in thelevel of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in case of pre-eclampsia in comparison to normal pregnant women. Dyslipidemia in the form of significantly increased triglyceride and VLDL concentration and slightly increased total cholesterol and LDL concentration is conspicuously evident in thesubject of pre-eclampsia as compared to normotensive pregnant women.",

The biochemical action of lipase enzymes in presence of phospholipids degrades the adipose or fat tissues suitable to preparemesenchymal stem cells. The purity of stem cells is characterized by protein expression on cell surface in specific cell phenotype. These cells differentiate in presence of specific lipogenic inducer in cell cultures. In vitro stem cell culture is a technique to develop controlled cell proliferation and maintain specific phenotype. In adipose stem cell cultures, phenoltyping and controlled cell differentiation both are determined by stem cell surface marker CD105 proteins. Moreover, stem cells display multi-differentiation potential and serve as 'Obesity molecular bioinformatics tool' or molecular differentiation protein fingerprints. The database of cell differentiation proteins is very significant in decision making of obesity treatment and drug development. The concept is based on the fact that stem cell surface proteins involved in cell differentiation might be adipogenic or drug targets. In this paper, adipose tissue engineered stem cell isolation and characterization by different stem cell surface proteins as bioinformatic tool to search adipogenesis inhibitors and differentiation blockers is described retrieved from MMDB (Molecular Modeling Database) and PDB (Protein Data Bank). Different polymeric scaffold materials serve as potential breast and thorax extracellular matrices suitable for human use under clinical practice regulations. In conclusion, adipose stem cell isolation from fat tissue, stem cell surface protein markers as bioinformatics tools with current practices and future perspectives are addressed in the light of adipose tissue engineering matrices.",

Our study provides evidence that the concentrations of serum SFRP4 inprediabetic obese subjects were increased and correlated closely with pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and obesity (chronic lowgrade inflammation). Hence, SFRP4 may participate in the development of pancreatic beta cell dysfunction in prediabetic obese subjects. BACKGROUND:Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects around 1% of the population worldwide.Even though its pathophysiology remains elusive several studies have hypothesized that it could be the result of deregulation of synaptic plasticity and alterations of inflammatory processes.Neurotropin-3and Matrix metalloproteinase-9 which play a role in the growth and differentiation of neurons are known to be associated with aberrant synaptic plasticity.Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug used in the treatment of schizophrenia. Till date there are limited, but inconclusive data available in the literature about the effects of Risperidone on Matrix metalloproteinase-9(MMP-9), Neurotropin-3(NT-3), Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and Interleukin-17(IL-17) levels in schizophrenia AIM OF THE STUDY:The present study was designed to assess the effect of Risperidone on IL-10, IL-17,NT-3,MMP-9 in patients with Schizophrenia spectrum of disorder.",

At the cellular level, magnesium also serves as a cofactor for many intracellular enzymes that generate energy via hydrolysis of ATP and are involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. It also assists the action of insulin. The effects of magnesium on obesity are crucial to women's health, since women are more likely to be obese than men.

However, new assays measuring holotranscobalamin (active vitamin B-12) are said to reflect actual vitamin B-12 status in body. In this study levels of these two assays were measured and analysed for deciphering the correlation between the two. METHOD AND MATERIAL:Serum samples were selected from 83patients at ACTREC-TMC who had been referred to Biochemistry Laboratory for assessment of vitamin-B12 status.For each patient serum total vitamin-B12 level and active vitamin-B12 level were determined by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay on Architect1000i analyzer (Abbott). RESULTS:R score by pearson correlation analysis is 0.652 with a high statistical significance (P < 0.0001).

INTRODUCTION: Epilepsy is a second most leading neuronal disorder received much less attention. We review evidence supporting a link between vitamin D and epilepsy including those coming at RIMS medicine OPD as well as ecological studies. Vitamin D and its receptor have important regulatory effects during brain development such as cell differentiation and apoptosis. It has been shown that vitamin D deficiency poses a risk for neurological diseases such as epilepsy etc. The synthesis of nerve growth factor is regulated by 1, 25( OH)2D3. It was shown at molecular levels that rat with low vitamin D3 have persistently low level of NGF. In the literature, several studies and hypothesis suggested an association between low vitamin d level and seizures;--Vitamin D may positively modulates brain neuromodulators and neuroreceptors viaGABA-A receptors. -vitamin d may affect seizures via acting through VDR to induce certain genes in the brain encoding cytokines and enzymes which involve in metabolism of neurotransmitter.",

During last decades, the incidences of CVD in Nepal increases drastically throughout the country. Lipid profile tests are the basis for the prediction of CVD. The number of medical laboratory is growing day by day in every part of the country but all most all of the laboratory are using the reference values supplied in the reagents kits which is mainly for either American or European population. Therefore, the interpretation of laboratory values with kit values is not the proper way for the prediction of CVD for the Nepalese population. Every lab should have their own reference values for each test in the contest of their locality. For this reason, this study has been designed to establish the reference range for the lipid profile test for healthy adult Nepalese population.",

Transaminases were found to be higher in dengue fever( SGOT-158.25 U/L \u00b1 77.14U/L , SGPT-89.87 U/L \u00b1 32.5 U/L ) than Chikungunya [SGOT-45.37U/L \u00b1 18.82 U/L , SGPT-42.63 U/L \u00b1 18.22U/L] CONCLUSION:-Dengue and Chikungunya infections continue to co-exist in many tropical countries. Our study has shown that it is possible for clinicians to use simple laboratory tests to predict these infections for appropriate management even if there is substantial overlap in clinical presentation.",

Zinc deficiency can increase susceptibility to TB because the cell-mediated immunity plays a major role in the disease.Zinc is the only cofactor necessary for activity, which is located in the deepest recess of the ADA active site, which may cause low level of serum Zinc. Even it may likely due to the redistribution of zinc from plasma to other tissues, decrease of zinc-carrier protein ?2-macroglobulin and rise of Metallothionin a protein that transports zinc to the liver.

Individuals of group 2 were homozygous for both the genes, thus riskof developing CHD was high. Individuals of group 1 and group 3 had mixed genotypes and were at intermediate risk.Our data indicates that APOC3 and FABP2 polymorphisms are associated with Dyslipidemia in individuals with polymorphic genes particularly in group 2. In group3 insulin intolerance and lifestyle factors were responsible for Dyslipidemia. Group 3 individuals were carriers.

Rats were fasted for 24 h when no food but de-ionized water was supplied ad libitum. Each rat was then placed in single cage. Limbs of the rat were put together and tightened with adhesive tapes so that the animal could not move. Under this condition rats were kept for 24 hours.

With this clinical scenario in mind we tried to find out the incidence of type 2 diabetes in young adults of our locality. The study group comprises of first year MBBS and BDS students admitted to our medical college.The diagnosed cases will be followed throughout their medical career till they leave the institution. Fasting blood sugar, plasma insulin and lipid profile will be estimated to measure HOMA-IR and dyslipidemia in both cases of controls. In the diagnosed cases early treatment modalities in form of life style modification and pharmaco-therapeutic approaches can prevent the future complications.",

Inadequate diagnosis of patients with chest pain often leads to inadequate admission of patients without acute myocardial infaction (AMI) and vice versa Cardiac markers are used in the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS).The troponins are regulatory proteins found in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Three subunits have been identified: troponin I (TnI), troponin T (TnT), and troponin C (TnC). The genes that encode for the skeletal and cardiac isoforms of TnC are identical; thus, no structural difference exists between them. However, the skeletal and cardiac subforms for TnI and troponin TnT are distinct, and immunoassays have been designed to differentiate between them.According to European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF)/American Heart Association (AHA)/ World Heart Federation (WHF) guidelines, MI refers specifically to myocardial necrosis due to myocardial ischemia. However, although elevations in the serum levels of TnI, TnT, and CK-MB indicate the presence of injury-associated necrosis of myocardial cells, such elevations do not point to the underlying mechanism of the necrosis. While myocardial necrosis occurs in MI, it can also be a product of predominantly nonischemic myocardial injury, as occurs in association with heart failure, arrhythmia, myocarditis, renal failure, pulmonary embolism, and percutaneous or surgical coronary procedures.The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB) working with the ACC/ ESC guidelines has recommended adoption of the 99th percentile upper reference limit as the recommended cutoff for a positive troponin result. Ideally, the precision of the assay at this cutoff level should be measured by a CV that is less than 10%. Copeptin may be useful to rule out MI rapidly when used along with troponin.",

P, India H ematopoiesis is the process by which all lineages of blood cells are generated in a stepwise manner from immature cells present in the bone marrow and subsequently released into circulating blood peripheral organs for further maturation steps and effector function. At the apex of this hierarchy are hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are the only self-renewing cells capable of life-long production of all lineages of blood cells. In response to differentiation cues, HSCs give rise to nonself renewing multipotent progenitors (MPPs), which then progressively differentiate into an array of more lineagecommitted progenitors and ultimately produce all of the highly specialized and differentiated into fully-grown mature blood cells. A large body of work has shown an essential role for two major categories of molecular networks in the maintenance of HSCs function, cellintrinsic process and cell extrinsic development pathways. As essential components of these regulatory networks are often deregulated in cancer, it is not surprising that improper control of HSCs maintenance is intimately tied to the development of hematological malignancies. Hematological malignancies are heterogeneous group of diseases that can globally be viewed as aberrant hematopoietic (stem cells) process initiated by a population of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that are able, like normal HSCs, for both self-renewal and differentiation in an aberrant fashion thereby propagating themselves and giving rise to differentiated progeny that represent the bulk of cells found in the tumor. Knowledge of this would help researchers and clinicians better chance of understanding the pathogenesis of relevant blood diseases and to develop new strategies for therapeutic manipulations of HSCs.",

In 2016, an estimated 1,685,210 new cases of cancer were diagnosed in the United States and 595,690 people died from cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22 nucleotides in length, non coding RNA speciesand play an important role in regulation of many aspects of cancer biology including proliferation, differentiation, metabolism and apoptosis. The miRNAs predominantly bind to 3\u00b4untranslated regions (3\u00b4-UTR) and sometimes to 5\u00b4UTR, codons of the transcribed mRNAs through specific seed sequences. This binding eventually results in either translation repression of target mRNAs to protein or induces their exonuclease-mediated cleavage, thereby regulating the expression of target genes. Moreover, their deregulated expression is also linked to the onset and progression of many diseases including cancer. Aberrant expressions of many miRNAs have been associated with cancer progression, metastasis as well as chemoresistance and are therefore classified as tumor suppressor miRNAs or oncogeneic miRNAs (OncomiRs). The our data suggested that targeting miRNAs in cancer can be a novel approach in area predictive biomarker which may be used as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic outcome. ",

Research efforts have increased and many reports on various aspects of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in women have been published highlighting sex differences in pathophysiology, presentation , and treatment of IHD . Women largely share similar (CVF) cardiovascular risk factors for IHD with men; however, women with suspected or confirmed IHD have less coronary atherosclerosis than men, even though they are older and have more cardiovascular risk factors than men.In young women who have undergone early or surgical menopause, who do not take estrogen, their risk for heart disease is also higher. This is because during menstrual cycle the estrogen level maintain the integrity of the pericardium. Hence after menopause the estrogen level falls down and thereafter integrity of the pericardium is no longer maintained by the estrogen. Thereafter, the risk of CVD increases after menopause. And this is how till menopause women are not that susceptible to CVD, but after menopause share the same risk factors as that for men.",

GGT, ALP activity and Magnesium levels were estimating till 10th day of post LTxin males (n= 31, females (n=4) in IP & 40 day in op. Total patients are divided in to three groupsbased on Mg RESULTS: Mg was supplemented in hypomagnesaemia patients and we observed no complications after post LTx. In one case of normal group we observed complications of ACR on 38 day of Post LTx due to developing of hypomagnesaemia who was not given Mg supplementation based on this observation we have started giving Mgsupplementation. After LTx 1.0 gm of Mg was supplemented per day to patients having Mg normal levels 1.5-2.0 mg/dl in serum pre LTx even in normal group to overcome the complications of hypomagnesaemia. And 2.0 gm of Mg was supplemented per day to patients had Mg levels below 1.5 mg/dl in serum pre LTx. The results showed lower prevalence of post-operative hypomagnesaemia in patients administered Mg supplementation post LTx the Mg has increasing trend up to 5th day of post LTx after that it reaches to normal range and maintain stable in both groups In hypermagnesaemia group no complications were observed after post LTx Severe hypermagnesaemia can exert an anti-calcium effect on the cardiovascular system, causing vasodilatation, which is deleterious during reperfusion that the reason we are not supplement Mg to the hypermagnesaemia pre LTx group.CONCLUSION: Low levels of Mg post LT x may cause ACR maybe due to antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs. Hence magnesium levels has to be maintain at normal level. Mg levels are also used to monitor dosage of immunosuppressive drugs.In response to the observation of significant pre LTxhypomagnesaemia in LTx patients, we recommend the practice of magnesium supplementation post LTx inhypomagnesium group and group with normal levels by monitoring Mg levels.KEYWORDS: Hypomagnesaemia, preLTx, post LTxFP-23 A Very Rare Case of Carbonate-Apatite Stone In 31 Years Old Male PatientRajeev Gupta, Nitin Dayal, Anupama Arya, Dilip Kimar, Poonam DasMATERIAL AND METHODS:The morphological studies were made with the whole calculus. Qualitative chemical analysis was done on pulverized calculus using clean pestle and mortar to obtain finely ground powder using kit provided by Biolabo Reagents, France. The results were confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) method.RESULTS:Chemical Analysis results of Kidney stone showed mainly calcium Carbonate along with struvit (Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate) and FTIR method gave the composition of carbonate Apatite 100%.CONCLUSION:Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate (Struvite) forms stones at alkaline pH, where the ammonium level is high. Struvite stones have been referred to infection stones and \"triple Phosphate\" stones. Carbonate ions were also commonly identified; they were assumed to be associated with calcium carbonate (CaCo 3 ). Calcite (CaCo 3 ) is extremely rare (1 in 20,000 stones). Numerous clinical reports attest to the association of urea -splitting bacteria, struvite and carbonate (apatite) stones. All strains of Proteus and both strains of Staphylococcus split urea, and the stones formed were composed of struvite and Carbonate-apatite.Relation of Catalytic Iron With The Cell Free Hemoglobin Resulted From The Dialysis Pump Injury of Rbcs In Patients on Maintenance HemodialysisMukhopadhyay B, Hegde U, Chakurkar V, Konnur A, Gang S, Rajapurkar M.",

Homozygous mutants of C3435T (TT versus CC, P\u00bc0.034) and G2677T/A (TT 1 AA versus GG), P \u00bc 0.030) were significantly higher in patients with NS compared to controls. The frequency distribution of homozygous mutant TT1AA compared to wild genotype GG was significantly higher in SRNS than SSNS patients (P \u00bc 0.011) for G2677T/A, while the mutant genotypes for C3435T and C1236T were not differentbetween SRNS and SSNS patients. The combination-bearing mutant genotype either of C3435T or G2677T/A exhibited a significantly higher frequency of mutant genotypes distribution in SRNS patients. MDR-1 haplotypes did not differ significantly between SSNS and SRNS patients.CONCLUSIONS:-Patients with NS carrying homozygous mutants of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) G2677T/A are prone to develop SRNS. The synergistic effect of mutant genotypes of SNPs G2677T/ A and C3435T in different combinations increase the risk of developing steroid resistance in patients with NS.

This is one of the most-common serious illnesses in the industrialized world. Laboratory medicine now plays a crucial role in identifying risk factors, early events and conditions triggering plaque rupture in coronary ischemic disease. Progress in laboratory research has resulted from the discovery of new and more-promising biochemical markers of myocardial damage. Blood testing for biomarkers of myocardial injury plays an increasingly important role for the evaluation, diagnosis and managing triage of patients with chest pain.AIM-Since it is crucial to identify the proper guide lines and new test parameters in secondary primary health sector in India this is small attempt to give brief about history, development in cardiac biomarkers merging biomarkers new guide lines and protocolMATERIAL-The guidelines for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) have recently changed and prominently incorporate the results of cardiac marker testing in the clinical definition of MI. We review these updated guidelines for MI definition as it pertains to cardiac biomarker testing and further compare the differing biology and release kinetics of clinically relevant biomarkers. Finally, we define the contemporary use of cardiac biomarker testing for patients with chest pain, including appropriate integration of point-of-care testing into day-to-day clinical use. The measurement of multiple biomarkers and the use of point of care markers may accelerate current diagnostic protocols for the assessment of such patients. We also highlight the role of new cardiac markers as future cardiac biomarkers. Protocol for small lab.",

Statistically Compared at the end of 3 Months. Unpaired T Test and MannWhitney Test were applied to compare the Results. RESULT AND DISCUSSION: In Our Study, in the 24 Hour UrinaryOxalate Levels was reduced significantly (P = 0.0001) this reduction was Higher in the Interventional Group as Compared to the Control Group. Also, TheMean Change in 24 Hour Urinary Oxalate Levels, showed asignificant difference (P =0.0001) when comparison was done between Interventional Groupand Control Group..Hyperoxaluria Is an Important factor for Urinary Stone formation.Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) is acofactor in the Alanine-Glyoxalate-Transaminase Pathway; which converts Glyoxalate To Glycine and reduces Oxalate production by inducing the Enzyme. CONCLUSION: Oral Pyridoxine Supplementation in the dose of 40 mg/Day inaddition to Dietary restriction of Oxalate Rich Foods results instatistically significant reduction of Urinary Oxalate Excretion,by decreasing the precipitation of Calcium Oxalateand thereby reducing the chances of recurrent Calcium Oxalate Stone formation. It can be used as asimple, cheap and easy to implement prophylactic measure for prevention of recurrence Of Calcium Oxalate Urolithiasis.

Hepatitis viruses' induced chronic liver diseases are also on the rise in the country. Although IR levels depend on viral etiology, a little information is available on IR in liver diseases caused by hepatitis viral infections. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of level of IR in patients with different liver disease and relate its level to viral etiology and cytokines IL-6 and IL-2 levels to understand the underlying mechanism. HCC) of both gender and in adult age groupwere included in this study plan.IR level was calculated using HOMA-IR formula. Bloodanalysis for insulin, C-peptide, IL-6, IL-2 and hepatitis serology were done using EIAprocedure. Data were analyzed using appropriate statistical tests.RESULTS: IR levels were raised in all the disease groups than healthy controls. IR was significantly high in CVH patients (p<0.01). Accordingly, C-peptide also showed a strong tendency to be elevated in CVH patients (p=0.06). However, analyzing IR and C-peptide levels across Hepatitis B and C viruses revealed that HCV and HBV had comparable effect in rising IR in CVH and HCC patients. In cirrhosis patients, however, HCV markedly increased IR levels while IR levels in HBV infected patients were comparable to controls (p<0.01). Serum IL-2 was undetectable in almost all of the patients except for few patients in CIR group. Serum IL-6 was remarkably increased in all the disease groups compared to healthy controls (p<0.05). Within disease groups, IL-6 level were highest in HCC patients followed by CIR and CVH. Further, IL-6 level was remarkably elevated in HCC patients infected with HCV as compared to HBV (p<0.001) only. No difference in IL-6 levels between viral etiologies was observed in CVH and CIR patients.CONCLUSION:Raised IR and IL-6 in chronic liver disease is not associated with viral etiology.P140Evaluation of Antioxidant, Lipid Peroxidation And Toxic Effects After Apple Intake In Healthy Human VolunteersFaizal.P 1 , R.

Recently we have isolated a compound from the leaves ofA. rivularis. In this study, we evaluated the role of the compound in restraint induced gastric ulceration and anti-oxidant defense indices in rats. ) is a medicinal plant. Leaves, root, stem and flower of A. conyzoides L. are widely utilized in traditional medicine.The plant is specially known for its antibiotic efficacy, analgesic, anti-oxidative and hepato protective effects as well as blood booster. In this study we evaluated seasonal variation in hepatoprotective activity of A.conyzoidesL. leaves on antitubercular drugs induced hepatotoxicity in rats METHODS: A.conyzoides L.leaves were collected from the Medicinal Plants Garden of the University of North Bengal, Dist. Darjeeling, West Bengal, India in January -February, March-April, May -June, July -August, September -October, November -December. Wister strain albino rats(average body weight, 168.86\u00b1 1.24) were divided into eight groups of 6 each.First group of animals (control) received normal diet and de-ionized water while animals of the second group, in addition to normal diet and de-ionized water, took isoniazid (27 mg/ kg/day) + rifampicin (54 mg/kg/day) + pyrazinamide (135 mg/kg/day) suspension orally for one month fordevelopment of hepatotoxicity in rats. Other groups of rats received powdered leaves of A.conyzoides L. of different seasons in addition to hepatotoxicity inducing drugs. On 30th day blood samples were collected from the rats by cardiac puncture under ether anesthesia. Serum total protein, serum bilirubin and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were estimated.",

INTRODUCTION: Asingle base substitution (G'A) is the basis for rs671 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of ALDH2 gene, in which the 'A' allele (formerly known as ALDH2*2) encodes a non-functional or inactive enzyme, whereas the 'G' (ALDH2*1) allele codes for a functionally active enzyme. This SNP has been found to be associated with various disorders including alcohol dependence, diabetes, cancer, lead toxicity in various populations. But apart from real time PCR, the reported PCR-RFLP or PCR-CTPP methods are either not easy or cost effective and often provides inconclusive results. The objective of this study was to design a costeffective and easy method of genotyping rs671.",

In clinical applications, till now there is no specific diagnostic/prognostic marker. Metallothioneins (MTs) are intracellular proteins containing the highest amount of thiol groups which binds to severalcytotoxic agents such as alkylating agents and platinum compounds. The involvement of MT in many physiological and pathophysiological processes such as apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, and detoxification of heavy metals suggestive of vital role of MT in carcinogenesis as well as chemotherapy.MT in tumor cell plays an important role in defense mechanism against the effect of radiation by inhibiting the processes that lead to apoptosis. In bone tumors, MT levels were found to be increased in sera from patients with osteosarcoma compared with healthy patients and in tumor biopsies compared with non-malignant bone biopsies. Increased MT2A contributes to chemotherapy resistance in osteosarcoma. Therefore, increased MT level in serum might be a novel potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarker or also will be the therapeutic target for the treatment of osteosarcoma patients.Increased MT levels could provide a zinc cofactor reserve that increases the cell's reparative potential when faced by DNA damage by cytotoxic agents. Although the physiologic role of MT in resistance to the cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs remains unclear, a better understanding of the interaction between MT and chemotherapeutic agents is important and may open new horizon in the treatment of cancer.",

It is caused due to the mutation of the ABCD1 gene which impairs the peroxisomal Very Long Chain Fatty Acid (VLCFA) degradation resulting in accumulation of VLCFA in the cytosol. Accumulation of one of the VLCFAs-C26:0 VLCFA, has shown to result in accumulation of C26:0-lysophosphatidylcholine (C26:0-LPC) in X-ALD patients. Estimation of plasma VLCFA by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) is cumbersome, expensive and invasive. The advantage of using dried blood spots (DBS) for newborn screening has been well established but alternate non-invasive, less expensive and simple method for VLCFA estimation for screening of X-ALD has not been developed in India so far.",

It is very popular from ancient times by using in various traditional systems of medicine like Unani and Tibb, and Ayurveda. Nigellasativa seed and its oil are known to contain many active components to include thymoquinone (30%-48%), thymohydroquinone, dithymoquinone, p-cymene (7%-15%), carvacrol (6%-12%), 4-terpineol (2%-7%), t-anethol (1%-4%), sesquiterpenelongifolene (1%-8%) ?-pinene and thymol etc. Seeds contain two different types of alkaloids; i.e. isoquinoline alkaloids e.g. nigellicimine and nigellicimine-N-oxide, and pyrazol alkaloids or indazole ring bearing alkaloids which include nigellidine and nigellicine. Moreover, Nigellasativa seeds also contain alpha-hederin, a water-soluble pentacyclictriterpene, and saponin. Bioactive components are reported to possess very useful pharmacological effects to include analgesic (painkilling), anti-bacterial, anticonvulsant, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, antianxiety, antimalarial, anti-ulcer,anticancer,anti-cholinergic, anti-fungal, anti-hypertensive, antioxidant, antispasmodic, antiviral, bronchodilator, gluconeogenesis inhibitor (anti-diabetic),antipyretic, antipakinsonism,hepatoprotective (liver protecting), hypotensive, insulin sensitizing, interferon inducer, leukotriene antagonist, renoprotective (kidney protecting), tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor, and neuroprotective. Most of the therapeutic properties of this plant are due to the presence of thymoquinone, which is a major active chemical component of the essential oil. Because of various pharmacological activities of Nigella sativaseeds it is considered as one of the greatest forms of healing medicine and it is also believed that the Islamic prophet Mohammed stated that it is \"a remedy for all diseases except death.\" ",

Both males and females fetuses in F1 generation were given same diet as fed to their mothers for 6 weeks. Mating was performed within same groups and fetuses born were denoted as F2 generation. Folate, homocysteine and vitamin B12 levels were analysed in serum. The mRNA expression of some imprinting genes Igf2, KCNQIOT1, H19, Igf2Rand folate transporters RFC, PCFT, FR? were analyzed by Real-Time PCR. Global DNA methylation levels were analyzed by using ELISA kit.RESULTS:Folate and Vitamin B12 levels were significantly decreased and homocysteine levelsincreased in folate and B12 deficient groups. In B12 deficiency,abnormal growth was observed in fetuses born in F2 generation. In maternal and fetal tissues overexpression of H19, a negative regulator of growth,was observed in case of folic acid and B12 deficiency conditions in maternal as well as fetal tissuesand loss of expression of IGF2, (a growth promoting gene)was observed under folate deficient conditions and in all groups of B12 deficiency.Igf2R was down-regulated in both maternal as well as fetal tissues in case of deficient conditions of folate and/or B12.

Homocysteine can prove to be good, early diagnostic marker in idiopathic DVT. BACKGROUND : The use of clinical and radiographic guidelines to predict a patient's skeletal maturation is a routine practice for healthcare practitioners. These findings help in assessing the pubertal or adolescent growth spurt and also define whether it is imminent, present or complete. Such information is useful for treatment planning and evaluation of treatment progress in patients with skeletal and growth related disorders. As chronologic age is not reliable for evaluation of growth status, the biologic age needs to be determined. The use of radiographs to assess skeletal and dental maturation and evaluation of biomarkers for osteoblastic activityare of help in this regard. These Biomarkersare measureable in blood and other body fluids like saliva, gingival crevicular fluid and urine. As radiographic methods are highly subjective and involve radiation exposure and blood assay are invasive requiring patient co operation, saliva can be used as a diagnostic medium. It harbours a wide spectrum of proteins/peptides and ",

Gestational hypertension( GH) is often considered as a transitional state developed wherein the majority of the women who develop the condition between 24-35 weeks of gestation progress to pre-eclampsia. PE and GH are the primary cause of maternal and fetal/neonatal mortality and morbidity across the globe.
